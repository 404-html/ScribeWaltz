1
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.600
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.790
August 11th,

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.670
2014 Jesus fucking Christ.

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.100
I was going to record this thing Sunday night.
It's Sunday afternoon.
You know,

5
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.290
all of a sudden,
uh,
you know,

6
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.860
I got invited to a fucking pool pie

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.100
now.
I love the pool.
I love the Sun.
I love swimming and all that,

8
00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:32.230
but I don't like going to pool parties.

9
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.400
I like going to a pool with his offense and no one could see me and my pasty

10
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:37.234
body.

11
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.710
So I'm going to go over there and it look like a fucking giant piece of chalk

12
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.190
and a pair of fucking swim shorts.
But,
uh,

13
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.980
so I figured maybe I'll have a couple of beers at which point,
you know,

14
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.130
old man like me sitting in the sun drinking some beers.
Um,

15
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.140
this podcast would be an absolute shit show.
And some of you probably thinking,

16
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.330
Oh,
you know,
that you should've done it,
dude.
Dude,
that would've been an epic.

17
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.590
Make a complete ass of yourself as opposed to the usual,
go fuck yourself.

18
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:10.080
Get some God damn French.
You know,
get some fucking friends and,

19
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:13.630
and in and watch them make an ass of themselves.
Not this guy,
not this guy,

20
00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:18.460
not this week is he points to himself slapping himself in the chest.

21
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.120
Um,
I actually,
you know,
a lot of people don't realize this.

22
00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:24.870
I could have been an Olympic swimmer,
but,
um,

23
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.650
I just couldn't get over the embarrassment I had in the shame of standing in

24
00:01:29.651 --> 00:01:30.550
front of a crowd of people

25
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.190
with my pasty torso and legs,
my giant head.
But,
uh,
you know,

26
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.970
and my,
my little Tommy Lee leather underpants,

27
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.360
then I'm going to fucking where as your fucking swimming across the pool.
But,
uh,

28
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.680
I was actually a really good swimmer.
You know,
I was a really good swimmer.

29
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.650
Oh,
I could have been a professional swimmer.

30
00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:55.870
Is fucking Versie still going off on this shit,

31
00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.400
that classic Versie I didn't know where I'm minding my own business.
Paul Versey,

32
00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:05.290
by the way,
from the Versie effect podcast.
Um,
he just,

33
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:09.310
out of nowhere,
he makes it classic Versie statement,
which is it's just,

34
00:02:09.311 --> 00:02:14.170
it's through the fucking roof,
through the stratosphere,

35
00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:17.530
right out into the Goddamn a milky way.
He said,

36
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:22.531
no sport in history will ever be as psychological and as mental is.

37
00:02:23.861 --> 00:02:27.850
Golf,
he could have just said is a psychological was Gulf,

38
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.600
but he was trying to sound smart.
So we had and as mental,

39
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.470
<v 0>okay.</v>

40
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.470
<v 1>Nothing could be as sugary and sugar ish as a sugar cookie.</v>

41
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.570
Thank you Paul.
So of course I got to knock them down.

42
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.660
I got to knock down the statements and this is what I wrote back.

43
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:50.640
I wrote Pussies,
a sissy,

44
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:54.830
a sport ever complete waste of time.
And uh,

45
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:59.420
I just started going off on it and he was trying to defend it.
He goes,
well dude,

46
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.800
you know,
maybe if you played it,
if you'd played it,
you've understand.
It's like,

47
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:07.390
I've played it.
I caddied for three summers,
you know,
it's fucking,

48
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:11.260
it's exercise for nerds.
That's all it is.

49
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.530
I'm not saying that the people at the top fucking level that some of them aren't

50
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:22.290
good athletes.
Okay.
But I think the average professional golfer,

51
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.750
would you want to see Phil Mickelson throw a football?
You know,
I'm not,

52
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:29.320
maybe he could,
maybe he could surprise some people,
but just generally speaking,

53
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.730
look at that guy.
That guy is a champion in that sport.

54
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.620
Look at them with the fucking token man.
Tits,

55
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:39.454
sweat.

56
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.633
<v 2>You know</v>

57
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.270
<v 1>you ever go down to a fucking golf course,
right?</v>

58
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:49.260
And you just look at the average for some that's sitting there waiting to tee

59
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:50.910
off.
Does anybody,

60
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.840
anybody even look remotely athletic?

61
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.150
They're not.

62
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.960
You got to stick and you hitting a fucking ball that isn't moving because

63
00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:05.570
baseball was too difficult.
He's going to throw it fast and try to get pregnant.

64
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.310
Even baseball,
fucking wiffle ball was too difficult for you.
So you went down,

65
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.820
you bought some three stooges,

66
00:04:11.821 --> 00:04:16.800
silly ass fucking outfit and you go down there with the cleats for whatever

67
00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:17.790
fucking reason.

68
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.750
You know like you're cutting back against the grain trying to pick up a couple

69
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.010
extra yards.
You're not,

70
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.660
you could go to home and fucking flip flops and you could go play a round a

71
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:35.040
fucking golf,
you know,
getting a ball.

72
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:38.670
It isn't moving.
That's,
and I'm not saying it's not fucking difficult.

73
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.380
Who gives a shit?
Do it so mental,
it's all mental.

74
00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:47.700
You walk up,
you standing over the ball,
you got all that time to think about it.

75
00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:49.050
Think about what

76
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.130
golf is on the same level is trying to catch a fly with chopsticks.

77
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.800
Yeah,
it's difficult.
But who gives a fuck?
Dude,

78
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:04.100
I got a syncness Putt.
If I don't sick this plot,
if I sink this puddle,

79
00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:09.050
break a hundred.
What if you'd doubt who gives a shit?

80
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.040
Nobody cares.

81
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.790
Nobody cares.
Nobody cares.

82
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.220
But other unathletic fuck,

83
00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:24.221
or former athletes who had too many fucking hoagies and now this is their id or

84
00:05:24.621 --> 00:05:28.160
their in a miserable marriage.
So they go down to this fucking men's club.

85
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.210
They go down there and have a couple of beers and they stand around,
right?

86
00:05:32.211 --> 00:05:35.360
Scratching their balls through the pocket of their fucking pants.

87
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.680
House keys Jingling,
right?
Just psyched to be out of the house.

88
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.690
It's a fucking reason to get away from your wife.
That's all it is,
okay?

89
00:05:44.691 --> 00:05:47.840
But enough with this horse shit.
Okay.

90
00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:50.600
And I know I'm not saying that there aren't people out there,

91
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.990
you know that are in great shape,
that are professional golfers and all of that.

92
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.000
I'm not saying that,
okay,
but you look at the champion and golf.

93
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:02.300
Look at Bubba Watson.
Does that guy look like he's ever done it?
Like curls,

94
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.520
a pushup,
anything?
He just looks how he looks.
You know,
he uh,

95
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.220
he's got that,
you know,
sort of sunken in chess with,

96
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:12.230
I have a couple of donuts every once in a while.

97
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:14.090
A little fucking flab around the middle,

98
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.273
<v 3>okay?</v>

99
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.750
<v 1>I know I'm going to get a ton of shit for this,
but I don't care.</v>

100
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.510
I am so fucking sick of everybody who plays golf.

101
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.980
Rich Vos is good at golf from the rich and Bonnie,

102
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.260
my wife hates me podcasts.
I'm out this way.

103
00:06:32.261 --> 00:06:36.310
I'm hyping all the podcast this week I'm shitting on golf.

104
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.590
Rich Vos is actually,
from what I heard,
not only good at golf,

105
00:06:41.591 --> 00:06:43.120
he is an excellent Golfer.

106
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.600
Rich Vos with his little hands.

107
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.550
You wouldn't want to see rich vos go over the middle and try and catch a

108
00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:52.180
football.

109
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.050
Do you think those little hands could go up and grab it as some cornerbacks

110
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.650
coming in?
Timing it to knock his fucking head off.

111
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.630
He probably stopped slurring if it happened,
but anyways,

112
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.950
if fucking come in and and hit him right.
That's not a mental game.

113
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:14.420
That's not a mind fuck.
Jumping up in the air,
looking the other direction,

114
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:18.830
trying to catch a flying object as somebody else who's trained and knock you out

115
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:23.330
is coming in.
Give me a fucking break.
This is what I love about golf.

116
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.260
The average fucking cunt who plays that game is such,

117
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.060
is so horrible,
so fucking bad.

118
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

119
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.070
<v 1>At deck to go to a golf course.
It is a fucking shit show.</v>

120
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.860
Fucking shit show.
You go down to play,
pick up hockey.

121
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.860
You go down and play pickup hope.
You see athletes,

122
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.310
you see athletic people,
you go to a golf course.

123
00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:51.010
It is a fucking shit show.

124
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.910
It looks like one of those fat camp shows you wait for somebody comes stepping

125
00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:58.270
out of the bushes telling everybody what house they're going to live in over the

126
00:07:58.271 --> 00:07:59.200
next three months.

127
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:01.853
<v 0>Okay.</v>

128
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.240
<v 1>Here's another thing about fucking golf.
Oh,
I'm on a tear here.</v>

129
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.830
Here's another thing about golf.

130
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:10.370
I've never seen a fucking sport where every year they're trying to win.

131
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:15.550
There's so many non athletic on coordinated fuck heads play in that game that

132
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:20.210
every year they got to try to improve the equipment,

133
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:24.200
the equipment to make up for how bad everybody sucks.

134
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.920
Somehow make the fucking golf ball go further.

135
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:32.921
Somehow build a club to compensate for somebody is fucking man tits as they come

136
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:37.660
around.
Did they?

137
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.520
Did they redesign a football every year so you can throw it farther?

138
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:49.360
When did they finally going to get the equipment to catch up with how unathletic

139
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:52.930
the average golfer is in so many could actually keep it on the fucking course.

140
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.560
Look,
I'm not,
you know,
go out to have a couple of beers and smoke some stone.

141
00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:02.610
It's a,
it's great guy time away from the ladies or whatever.
I'm not saying that,

142
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.910
but I am so fucking fed up with everybody trying to justify it first as a sport.

143
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.700
All right,
let's get into this dumb argument.
Like what makes a sport a sport?
Um,

144
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.650
my thing is if there's not somebody across from you trying to beat the living

145
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:22.060
shit out of you,
um,

146
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.650
I just stop you.
I don't,

147
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.800
I don't think it's a sport and I don't want to hear golfers.
Yeah.

148
00:09:29.801 --> 00:09:33.130
The person trying to stop you is yourself,
man.

149
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.310
That happens in every fucking sport.
Okay?

150
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

151
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.640
<v 1>Every fucking sport.
Okay.</v>

152
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.300
You want to go up there against Roger Clemens at the height of his Roy roided

153
00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:48.320
out fucking period and the and the guy in front of you just before you went up

154
00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:49.280
went yard and the guy,

155
00:09:49.281 --> 00:09:53.360
you want to be that next guy fucking digging into the box is that guy's out

156
00:09:53.361 --> 00:09:55.010
there fucking grinding his teeth.

157
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.150
You want to talk about a mind fuck.
Trying to guess.
Yeah.

158
00:09:59.151 --> 00:10:01.830
I'm going to guess which side of my fucking head he's going to throw at.

159
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.210
You're telling me standing over that Goddamn ball is a bunch of other fat flux.

160
00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:10.320
Is staring at you is difficult

161
00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:16.330
with your space.
Age designed fucking driver.

162
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.690
He's fucking cuts.
This is what you know,
you suck every year.
You got a new drive?

163
00:10:20.691 --> 00:10:23.220
I dude,
I got a new one.
Yeah,
the even bigger Bertha.

164
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:25.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

165
00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.850
<v 1>Out of the fucking lazy fucks that can't even carry their own bags.
You know,</v>

166
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.910
they got some fucking little fucking Taiwanese kid carried double bags as they

167
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:39.660
walked down and they drive around in their little golf carts driving right up to

168
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:43.020
the ball and then the mind game starts again.

169
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.880
Give me a fucking break.

170
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

171
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:51.060
<v 1>All right.
Fuck Golf.
All right.
That's all I'm saying.
Okay.</v>

172
00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:53.880
This is the Monday morning podcast,
everybody and uh,
you know,

173
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.790
I say a lot of dump things and they go on for a long time,

174
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.650
which basically what happens here,
uh,
I want to thank everybody last week,
uh,

175
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:05.760
that enjoyed the fact that I called Orange is the new black,

176
00:11:05.761 --> 00:11:07.080
I called it Clam Oz.

177
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

178
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.120
<v 1>I just think the title's a little long.
Um,
I,</v>

179
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.920
I've actually tried to watch a couple episodes of that show and I just,

180
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:20.290
I dunno,

181
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.650
I just think that w that white girls should be getting the living shit kicked

182
00:11:23.651 --> 00:11:24.640
out of her a lot more.

183
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:25.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

184
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:26.930
<v 1>Like she,
she and I,</v>

185
00:11:26.931 --> 00:11:31.630
I've started to watch the pilot and she just didn't have enough of a,

186
00:11:31.631 --> 00:11:34.930
uh,
I can fucking handle myself background that,
you know,

187
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.490
every time I drop in I just feel like she should be Peyton somebodies toenails.

188
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.530
She never is.
She's fucking having arguments with people.

189
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.090
They would just grab a buyer fucking hair and spin her around the head,

190
00:11:49.091 --> 00:11:52.410
like a helicopter thrower in the fucking corner and then just do unspeakable

191
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.120
things to her.
She'd be having a horrific time.

192
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.970
She wouldn't have the time to give monologues.
You know,

193
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.190
I'm shitting on a show I barely watched and uh,
you know,

194
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:06.100
which goes good cause I'm shitting on a sport I've barely played.

195
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:10.930
I tried playing,
it was fucking bored shitless.
I used to caddy at this,
uh,

196
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.160
this country club when I was a youngster.
I did it.
Uh,

197
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.530
I did it a couple times and there was a handful of people that were actually

198
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.980
athletic.
They were actually,
uh,
guys,

199
00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:26.500
guys social and they were good.

200
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.040
They were good golfers and the rest of them,
uh,

201
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.080
with their stope at fucking thigh high argyle horse socks with them matching

202
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:42.391
fucking I'm selling newspaper hats coming out there with their big puffy in a

203
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:47.140
way we go pants.
Oh,
those guys were the fucking worse.

204
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:50.920
You didn't make any money.
Sometimes you try to go out again,
but you know,

205
00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:55.630
half the time you go out with such a fucking hack and it had nothing to do with

206
00:12:55.631 --> 00:12:58.750
golf.
Just blaming the sport.
It's like,
oh,
you suck at golf.

207
00:12:58.751 --> 00:13:02.350
What sport are you good at?
Accounting.

208
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.400
Fucking asshole.
You'd be better at counting.

209
00:13:08.401 --> 00:13:10.350
How many devils are on that golf ball then?
Actually,

210
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.380
why don't you start with fucking,
uh,
I dunno what I don't,

211
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.550
I don't know.
I think if you're going to play golf,
you shouldn't,

212
00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:21.060
you should have to be able to play polo first.
If you could handle a horse,

213
00:13:21.061 --> 00:13:23.220
it'd be hand eye coordination to fucking whacked.

214
00:13:23.221 --> 00:13:27.270
That ball is you're riding on that fucking based in his nostrils flaring.

215
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.920
Then I'll entertain that.

216
00:13:28.921 --> 00:13:32.010
Maybe your athletic when you go to walk out on the course,
but other than that

217
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:38.310
with the hazards in the dumb ass fucking rules,
you know,

218
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.020
here's another thing too.

219
00:13:40.021 --> 00:13:44.010
And then everybody goes out and they fucking cheat all the time in this gimmes

220
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.020
and all of that Yak.
Go Fuck Yourself.

221
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:53.430
Fuck all of that.
I do like golf courses.
I liked them from the air.

222
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.040
It gives planes and helicopters a place to land.

223
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.630
Do you ever get in trouble?
Other than that it's just a complete,

224
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:04.130
it's just a fucking waste of time.
Um,
all right Phil,

225
00:14:04.131 --> 00:14:07.940
you've made your goddamn point.
Um,
fuck.

226
00:14:07.941 --> 00:14:12.710
What was I just going to talk about?
I'd started to go into something else.
Yeah.

227
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.560
I don't have any questions for this week.
I don't want,
I don't have anything.

228
00:14:15.561 --> 00:14:19.340
I'm just trying to fuck.
I'm trying to energy my way through this thing.
Uh,

229
00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:22.880

ah,

Okay.

230
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.830
If you thought that that was horrific.
Wait,

231
00:14:24.831 --> 00:14:28.950
Try and read out loud how many we got this week.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.580
Why is that?

256
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.240

I would take that 35 grand and I would go buy a watermelon patch,

and I make 40 grand selling those watermelons.

back to the podcast.
Did any of that last part make any sense?

315
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.860
Um,
all right,
let's get boy,
what other,

316
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:51.600
more moronic shit can I talk about?
Um,
well,

317
00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:54.780
what did I do this week?
I went on a long hike this morning.

318
00:19:54.781 --> 00:19:59.520
Somebody sent me a nice article about,
uh,
the,
the health benefits of hiking,

319
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.930
which is just like golfing without all the Douche bags.

320
00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.540
You don't have to keep score everybody if you just want to go walk and just go,

321
00:20:10.541 --> 00:20:11.374
just go hike.

322
00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.930
Do you know what's weird is they actually issued a warning out here for certain

323
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.340
parks that,
uh,

324
00:20:18.341 --> 00:20:22.270
that women should not be hiking alone because evidently there's one or two

325
00:20:22.271 --> 00:20:24.820
perverts that are riding by on bicycles,

326
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:29.850
grabbing ass and titties as they go by.
And uh,

327
00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.360
I know that that's wrong,
but like what,
what do you,

328
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:39.880
what do you think,
like what kind of a fucking game plan?
I mean,

329
00:20:39.881 --> 00:20:44.560
we all like ass and titties,
right?
Why wouldn't you just walk up and say hello?

330
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.330
Try and opening line,
say,
oh,
beautiful horizon.

331
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.980
<v 1>I hated going to school,</v>

332
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.190
but if I could go to school and become a psychologist and just,

333
00:20:56.191 --> 00:21:00.360
or a cop who when they finally catch this hunk of Shit,
um,

334
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:04.050
whose kid hope this damaged child that now has become an adult,

335
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.880
you know,
they can afford a bicycle.
I'm

336
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:11.880
like,
I don't understand.

337
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.123
<v 2>Okay.</v>

338
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.780
<v 1>Are they fat now?
Because that wouldn't work because they're on a bike.</v>

339
00:21:18.781 --> 00:21:22.710
I'm thinking like they just,
I've met the person small.

340
00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.580
If I'm going to try to break down what I think this person looks like here.

341
00:21:26.581 --> 00:21:28.080
Let me do a little police work.
All right.

342
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:33.170
I think the dude is small because he's worried that after he sexually assaults

343
00:21:33.391 --> 00:21:36.750
the woman by grabbing her boob or,
uh,
but uh,

344
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:41.020
<v 4>she's,
she has the chance of beating the shit out of him.</v>

345
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.060
So I think he's a smaller fella.

346
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.453
<v 2>MMM.</v>

347
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.450
<v 4>Just coming right down the fucking hill,</v>

348
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.440
riding down the hill with his dick standing up.

349
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.520
That's one of the scariest things.
I think I can have a thicker,

350
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.153
<v 2>yeah.</v>

351
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.010
<v 4>I wonder if he yells as he goes by,</v>

352
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.550
he just reaches out,
grabs her ass titties.

353
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.230
I mean that's fucking horrible.

354
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.580
What is now when they catch this guy and he goes to jail.

355
00:22:17.581 --> 00:22:18.990
Anybody who goes to jail

356
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.340
<v 1>for,
uh,
for,
you know,
you know,</v>

357
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:26.660
any pedophiles or rape,
anything sexually fucked up.

358
00:22:26.661 --> 00:22:29.270
They have a rough time.
So like what would they do with him?

359
00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:34.790
<v 4>You know,
what would be the,
uh,
the punishment.
I mean,</v>

360
00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:37.220
he doesn't deserve an ass rape and for that,
does he,

361
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:38.510
<v 2>okay.</v>

362
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.420
<v 4>Cause if he deserves an ass rape and then what,</v>

363
00:22:40.421 --> 00:22:43.820
what the fuck does the ass rape and deserve?
Maybe it's a very slippery slope.

364
00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:45.960
It's almost like,
you know,
doing your stand up back.

365
00:22:45.961 --> 00:22:48.620
He can't start with the closing bit.
You got nowhere to go.

366
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

367
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.310
<v 4>You can't be on 10.
This guy deserves like what?
I'm going to ask the lady,</v>

368
00:22:53.311 --> 00:22:55.080
it's like,
what do you think this guy deserves?

369
00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.760
<v 1>God knows what them,
it's never enough.
Right?
It's never enough.</v>

370
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.910
<v 4>Like when they suspended Steven A.
Smith after he said,</v>

371
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.760
I'm going to keep talking about that because it was such bullshit when he said

372
00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:07.810
you shouldn't hit a woman.
Right.

373
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:09.523
<v 2>MMM.</v>

374
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.280
<v 4>And they still suspended them.
They went and they cut to this woman,
right?</v>

375
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:18.340
This lady.
And she's like,
you got suspended like three days or some shit custom,

376
00:23:18.341 --> 00:23:19.980
like fucking half a million dollars,

377
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.550
<v 1>you know.
And uh,</v>

378
00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.880
<v 4>because he said you should never hit a woman.</v>

379
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.310
And then he had the audacity to say,

380
00:23:28.311 --> 00:23:32.900
let's try to examine the problem from 360 degrees,
you know,
um,

381
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:37.130
he gets suspended like three days and this fucking woman comes on TV.

382
00:23:37.131 --> 00:23:40.730
And she goes,
I don't think it's enough.
I don't think it's enough.

383
00:23:40.731 --> 00:23:45.020
I so wanted to be on TV.
It just be like,
is it ever enough with you bitches?

384
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:52.430
<v 1>See that's right.
That's exactly,
yeah.
You call it stop bitches.
No,</v>

385
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:56.870
I'm not your fucking cunt.
Oh.
Calling you a bitch.
All right.
That's all.

386
00:23:56.871 --> 00:24:01.580
It's a joke.
Lighten the fuck up,
dude.
I swear to God,

387
00:24:01.581 --> 00:24:04.820
you could go out
the average woman,

388
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:09.821
you could go if you went out and you bought her a fucking Mercedes Benz for door

389
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.850
hard top or whatever.
You know what they'd say?

390
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:18.820
How come you didn't get to convert?
I'm not saying all of them,

391
00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.200
but enough of them.
I guess we do shit too.

392
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:27.190
You didn't hear any noise that got my hair cut.
Oh,

393
00:24:27.191 --> 00:24:30.840
I thought you go shut.
I mean,
we're morons,
I guess.
Um,

394
00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.870
I'm trying to be more empathetic as I get older,
but it's never enough.

395
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.010
It's like they're treating the guy like he hit somebody.

396
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:47.060
Uh,
I dunno.
I guess I've exhausted,
exhausted that topic.

397
00:24:47.061 --> 00:24:50.000
What do you do when you have an hour long podcast and you don't have any fucking

398
00:24:50.001 --> 00:24:54.260
emails?
Andrew was supposed to send me of these motherfucking

399
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.070
things,
but he's on a hiking excursion,

400
00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:02.510
which I understand cause I would not be fucking send emails either plus of doing

401
00:25:02.511 --> 00:25:03.170
it way early.

402
00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:06.160
So I'm just going to have to sit here and just fucking deal with this goddamn

403
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:10.850
silence.
Um,
what am I going to bring to the pool party?

404
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:16.640
Other than my lack of pigment?
I don't want to fucking drink in the sun,

405
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:22.160
you know.
Hey,
I'm doing another one of those.
Uh,

406
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.230
what is it?
The uh,
the goddamn comedy jam.
I'm doing another one of those.
Uh,

407
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.280
Nah,
I'm not going to tell you the song that I'm playing,

408
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:33.650
but I have to go down to the fucking drum.

409
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:35.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

410
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.760
<v 1>Whatever the fuck it is.
I know.
I'm not going to give anybody,</v>

411
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:42.670
I wish it was a private.
When I know
professional drum shop,

412
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.620
I'll go down there on vine.
I got to get a,
uh,

413
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.390
I got to get a cow bell.

414
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:55.600
I just had to pause and wait for somebody yelled more cow bell for the umpteen

415
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.430
thousand times.
Like it's still funny.
Um,

416
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.473
<v 0>okay.</v>

417
00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.630
<v 1>I got to get the cow bell.
You know,
you,
you actually hit it with the bass drum.</v>

418
00:26:03.631 --> 00:26:05.550
I'm the can put it right next to the fucking high hat.

419
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:10.400
I'm going to try to do a note for note cover this fucking song.
And uh,

420
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:14.670
this is my new leg.
This is,
this is my golf.

421
00:26:14.671 --> 00:26:16.640
This is how the fuck I have to get out of the Goddamn House.

422
00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:20.940
I probably shouldn't have gone off like that.
Hard on golf.
Right?
Is that right?

423
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.330
Oh,
before I get,
before I get off,
totally off the subject here.

424
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:29.430
A thank you to everybody who helped up Benny grip a raise some money for his DVD

425
00:26:29.431 --> 00:26:32.090
project.
Um,
drum video,
uh,

426
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.000
thing that he's trying to put together.
I'm the worst at promoting shit,

427
00:26:36.001 --> 00:26:40.230
but I appreciate it.
Um,
all right.
And back to the,
uh,

428
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.920
the golf shoes,
I probably shouldn't have been that difficult.
Know people go out,

429
00:26:43.921 --> 00:26:44.010
they

430
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.843
<v 4>have a good time,</v>

431
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.030
<v 1>you know,
I don't fucking know.</v>

432
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.440
I'm just already anticipating the amount of shit people are going to give me for

433
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:53.320
that.
Um,

434
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:55.320
<v 4>anyways,
you know what?
Let's talk about,
you know,</v>

435
00:26:55.321 --> 00:26:57.960
this is something I haven't talked about in a minute because I took off the

436
00:26:57.961 --> 00:26:59.300
fucking summer.

437
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.840
<v 1>MMM.</v>

438
00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:04.181
<v 4>Yeah,
that's what I did.</v>

439
00:27:04.181 --> 00:27:08.210
I took off the summer and then my whole fucking downstairs go.
Al went to Shit.

440
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:09.480
<v 0>Okay.</v>

441
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.720
<v 4>Do you know some Weirdo chick emailed me?
She goes,</v>

442
00:27:11.721 --> 00:27:13.640
stop referring it to your downstairs.

443
00:27:13.641 --> 00:27:16.160
Like she was getting something weird sexually out of that.
Like,

444
00:27:16.161 --> 00:27:21.110
that was my issue and I need to stop saying that.
It's just like,
it's like,
ah,

445
00:27:21.111 --> 00:27:23.780
okay.
Yeah,
I guess that's on me.
That's not on you.

446
00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.890
And I'm talking about my house and I say that downstairs and you somehow are

447
00:27:27.891 --> 00:27:32.120

I clicked on it.

481
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.510
My Internet's working really slowly lately.
I don't know what that means.

482
00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.691
Hey,
did you hear like,

483
00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:01.600
like Google and all these other fucking guys and they're trying to buy up the

484
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:04.750
whole Internet and then you're going to have to fucking pay them a vig every

485
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:08.820
month.
Are they going to make your website super slow?

<v 0>Okay.</v>

Back to the,

506
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.510
back to the podcast here.
Um,
all right.
You know who gives a fuck?
I'm just,

507
00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.250
I'm just gonna,
I'm gonna just start reading just random

508
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.790
emails that I got off my,
uh,
of my web,
my web,
a toad there.

509
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:41.040
Uh,
hey bill.
Hi.
How are you?
Huge Fan.
I haven't read any of these things.

510
00:31:41.041 --> 00:31:45.660
I just,
I sort of glanced at me.
He made me lands on me time.

511
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:51.510
Um,
I recently saw an is small interview in which you said buying a house,

512
00:31:51.511 --> 00:31:53.400
unless you are buying it straight up with money,

513
00:31:53.401 --> 00:31:56.820
you have meaning without alone I guess is a stupid move.

514
00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.510
Could you please elaborate because I think you're out of your mind.

515
00:32:00.511 --> 00:32:01.620
That's not what I said.

516
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.640
And also that was part of a longer interview and they took a 50 minute

517
00:32:05.641 --> 00:32:09.810
conversation and made it a minute and a half.
Uh,
this is what he says.

518
00:32:09.811 --> 00:32:11.730
Let me tell you my situation.

519
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.840
My wife and I had been renting a condo for $1,000 a month,

520
00:32:17.971 --> 00:32:22.320
not including utilities,
a three bedrooms,
garage,

521
00:32:22.321 --> 00:32:24.900
great neighborhood,
all that jazz.
The American dream.

522
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:29.580
The American dream is all about after a year of renting total spent 12 grand,

523
00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:34.980
I decided I'm going to buy a place in the same neighborhood.
Uh,

524
00:32:34.981 --> 00:32:39.300
I gave a 10th out.
I gave 10% down payment of Jesus.

525
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:44.640
Oh Jesus,
God,
Dude,

526
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:48.680
you can have that dick in your ass forever.
Um,

527
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.920
and my mortgage is now $870 a month.

528
00:32:51.921 --> 00:32:56.000
Taxes included while my rent was a thousand for the same place,

529
00:32:56.001 --> 00:33:00.320
like the one I just bought.
Now the rent money I am never going to see again.

530
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.120
Um,
that's 12,000 gone forever in only one year,

531
00:33:05.121 --> 00:33:09.740
which I obviously don't regret spending cents.
It was a necessity.
However,

532
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.010
let's say I pay for my house for 10 years,

533
00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:18.080
I would have paid roughly a hundred thousand dollars off for it.
What?

534
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.800
Sure.
I will get raped on taxes,
interest rate from the bank,
Yada,
Yada.

535
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:27.820
Then I go sell it.
Even if the price of the house didn't go up at all,

536
00:33:27.821 --> 00:33:31.120
I'm going to see some of that money back.
Sure.
Not all of it,

537
00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.070
but even if it's half of it,

538
00:33:33.071 --> 00:33:36.610
that's still way smarter than red tick for 10 years and seeing none of it,

539
00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:42.340
uh,
blah,
blah bubble,
you're going to present the usual argument.
All right,
dude,

540
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.600
you're paying $1,000 a month to rent because you don't have like a 500 grand

541
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.820
hanging over your head and you can fucking leave whenever you want.

542
00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:56.620
And if anything goes wrong and the Condo,
somebody else has to fix it.

543
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.850
<v 2>Okay?</v>

544
00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:03.440
<v 4>So you're sitting there acting like you got this condo and it's eight 70 a
month,</v>

545
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:08.270
and that is,
um,
$870 a month.

546
00:34:08.271 --> 00:34:11.360
And that is like,
you're only expenses.
It isn't,

547
00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.150
you're easily paying at least a thousand bucks.

548
00:34:14.151 --> 00:34:16.190
Let's do you want to talk about throwing money away?

549
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:20.570
If you just make the monthly payment,
that 870,

550
00:34:20.571 --> 00:34:23.150
like 860 that is right in the toilet.

551
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:28.480
That just goes to the bank.
You don't own $870 more.

552
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.410
Your House,
she owned like $9 more.

553
00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.473
<v 2>MMM.</v>

554
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.360
<v 4>They slowly bleed you for 30 fucking years.
I,</v>

555
00:34:36.361 --> 00:34:41.361
and what I was basically saying is that I'm buying a house that you can afford

556
00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:47.770
is a stupid move because all you're doing is staying in it,

557
00:34:47.771 --> 00:34:50.950
paying interest on it,
while it increases in value,

558
00:34:50.951 --> 00:34:55.150
the only person making money when you go to sell it is going to be the bank and

559
00:34:55.151 --> 00:34:59.380
the real estate agent.
Those are the only two people.
And um,

560
00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.330
I don't understand that whole fucking thing.

561
00:35:01.331 --> 00:35:06.100
Like say you bought at the right time and then the fucking thing shoots through

562
00:35:06.101 --> 00:35:06.881
the roof,
right?
Yeah.

563
00:35:06.881 --> 00:35:11.200
House doubles in price and then you sell it and then you've doubled your money.

564
00:35:11.201 --> 00:35:14.710
But now you need a place to live.
So you have to go buy,

565
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:17.590
go back into this market where everything's doubled.

566
00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:21.010
So it's just the lateral fucking move.
All the money you made,
you,

567
00:35:21.011 --> 00:35:22.510
now I got to put it into this other house.

568
00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:26.380
Unless you somehow downgrade your life.
Why?
Why would you want to do that?

569
00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.053
<v 2>MMM.</v>

570
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:33.440
<v 4>The only way to make money,
I think really in a,
in a house is a,</v>

571
00:35:33.441 --> 00:35:37.470
if you can afford it and you can pay it off quickly,
do,

572
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:42.030
you could pay it off quickly.
Then as the house increases in value,

573
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.780
it's increasing in value for you because what happens,

574
00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:47.940
I feel over the years when you're paying the interest,

575
00:35:47.941 --> 00:35:51.330
the interest is always slightly ahead of how much the house is appreciating in

576
00:35:51.331 --> 00:35:54.840
value.
And that's when you didn't get completely fucked over a few bought at the,

577
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:59.250
at the height of a bubble,
like so many other people.
Um,

578
00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:03.420
you're upside down on your house and you could stay in it for 30 fucking years

579
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:09.330
and you still might,
it still might not be worth as much.
I mean the,
I dunno,

580
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.720
I don't really understand what you're trying to ask me.
It's just like,

581
00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:16.510
I guess,
yeah,
you

582
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.070
<v 0>okay.</v>

583
00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:21.190
<v 4>After 10 years you could sell your house and you would get some money,</v>

584
00:36:21.191 --> 00:36:25.030
but you're not adding them.
You're not adding this money properly.

585
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:29.270
Like,
let's say,
okay,

586
00:36:29.271 --> 00:36:32.660
you were throwing 12 grand a month,

587
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:36.290
a 12 grand a year into the toilet,
you said,

588
00:36:36.291 --> 00:36:39.800
but you had the luxury of not having a half a million dollars in debt hanging

589
00:36:39.801 --> 00:36:40.634
over your head.

590
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.540
You also had the luxury of Veekan basically give a month's notice and fucking

591
00:36:45.541 --> 00:36:48.150
leaf.
Okay?
Um,

592
00:36:48.151 --> 00:36:52.110
you don't have to go through the trying to sell the fucking House and Oh my God,

593
00:36:52.111 --> 00:36:55.890
is this the,
uh,
you know,
the wrong time to be selling it and blah,
blah,
blah.

594
00:36:55.891 --> 00:37:00.300
And I'll fuck though.
Watermain broke.
I have to pay for that.

595
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:04.020
You don't have to pay for any 12 grand.
Bing,
Bang,
boom.
It's all done.
Condo thing.

596
00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:05.910
People come by,
trim the hedges,
mow the lawn.

597
00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:10.200
You don't have to pay for any of that fucking shit.
12 grand a year.
Done.

598
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.920
That's a beautiful fucking thing.
Now owning a house,

599
00:37:13.921 --> 00:37:17.400
it's a beautiful fucking thing.
If you buy a house that you can afford,
okay?

600
00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:19.500
If you can just kick the shit out of the principal,

601
00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:24.230
but if you're going to go in there and just pay eight 70 a month,
um,

602
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:29.160
as that house appreciates in value,
it's appreciating in value for the bank,

603
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:33.090
not for you.
I hate to tell you that sir,
but that's basically it.
Okay.

604
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:36.660
So let's say now you're throwing eight 70.
Okay.

605
00:37:36.661 --> 00:37:40.530
$8,700
a year,

606
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:46.710
okay.
To,
we'll just say roughly we'll say $8,500 a year in interest.

607
00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.200
Over 10 years.
You're talking about,
you know,

608
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.560
it starts to go down at the more you've paid in interest at first 10 years is

609
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:55.920
mostly interest.
So you're going to give them like $75,000.

610
00:37:55.921 --> 00:37:59.220
You're going to throw into the fucking toilet,
all right?

611
00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:02.070
Plus all the expenses,
all the taxes,

612
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.250
all the bullshit of own and a fucking house.

613
00:38:05.251 --> 00:38:10.080
All the shit that I'm going through right now.
Um,
it,

614
00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:15.390
it makes paying $1,000 a month and not owning way better,
way better.

615
00:38:15.391 --> 00:38:18.180
The fact that you can just fucking leave whenever you want to.

616
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.540
And if there's a problem,
you can call somebody.
Up and be like,
yeah dude,

617
00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.180
you know,
you need to fix this.

618
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:29.940
I will not stand for this,
me and my thousand dollars a fucking month.
So,
um,

619
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.120
you're paying way more than 870 bucks a month is all I'm saying.

620
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.180
And I'm not saying like,
that's great that you actually,

621
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.610
what you should do is,

622
00:38:39.611 --> 00:38:44.611
are you taking that extra hundred $30 a month that you're saving and throwing

623
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:47.140
that,
at least throw that at your principal.

624
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.200
Anything to somehow start sawing away at the chains around your fucking ankles.

625
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:58.030
Um,
because it is a fuck over.
Do this or do this,

626
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:00.790
whatever your fucking principle is.
Okay?

627
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.580
Multiply your monthly payment times 12 and then multiply it times 30 and it's

628
00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:11.290
going to be roughly two and a half,
two and a half times.
What the fuck?
Uh,

629
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.490
your loan was.
Okay?
So if your loan was safe for 500 grand,

630
00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:20.491
you're going to pay them back probably anywhere from one point $2 million to 1.5

631
00:39:21.371 --> 00:39:24.400
depending on what your fucking interest rate was.
Okay?

632
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:27.370
And I don't think in 30 years you're going to get a million.

633
00:39:27.371 --> 00:39:30.880
And a half dollars for that fucking thing.
And let's say you do forget it.

634
00:39:30.881 --> 00:39:34.180
You paid all the taxes and all the bullshit and had to put a new roof and fix

635
00:39:34.181 --> 00:39:38.290
the fucking driveway and the electrical and the pipes and the water damage and

636
00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:42.820
the fucking God knows what else.
The termites and all this shit that happened.

637
00:39:42.821 --> 00:39:46.840
I mean,
you'll,
if you break even,
you fucking crushed it.
That's all I'm saying.

638
00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:52.670
All right.
Now I might be a dick.
I might be raining on your fucking parade there.

639
00:39:52.671 --> 00:39:53.504
But uh,

640
00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:58.940
that's why I feel like if you can buy a house that you can just pay off,

641
00:39:58.941 --> 00:40:02.210
even if it's a shit hole,
if you can just pay it off in five years,

642
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:05.900
you're better to keep renting and buy a house in another fucking state.

643
00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.150
You don't want to live in just by that thing.

644
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:12.080
Get people in there paying the fucking mortgage and then you,
you pay,

645
00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.210
pay down the fucking principal.

646
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:19.190
You better to do that and then sell that fucking thing and use the equity in

647
00:40:19.191 --> 00:40:23.580
that to then get into a fucking house where you live,
what you want to live.
Uh,

648
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.060
try to kick the shit out of the principal.
But,
uh,

649
00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:30.100
that whole thing getting into a house and all you're asking is what is the

650
00:40:30.101 --> 00:40:31.390
monthly payment going to be?

651
00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:36.310
You're going to get fucked in the ass seven ways to Sunday as they say.

652
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.190
That's what I was trying to say,
but they cut out a ton of what I was,
uh,

653
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:45.940
what I was talking about sir.
Okay.
So there you are.
Was that boring?

654
00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.060
All the kind of board May to,
um,
let's,

655
00:40:49.061 --> 00:40:52.900
let's steer into the boring and let's do a little more advertising.
How Jesus,

656
00:40:52.901 --> 00:40:57.430

slow fucking death.

657
00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:02.170
Um,
no,
that's just like off you fucking kill it on the front and I shut up.

658
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:08.160
Oh,

dollar shave club.
Everybody,
uh,
ever wonder why razors are so expensive.

660
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:18.300
Big shape companies are charging you for,
uh,
for ridiculous shave tech.

661
00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:23.130
You don't need first vibrating handles,
then flashing lights.
Now pivot ball.

662
00:41:23.131 --> 00:41:27.690
Flex heads.
What next?
The MPN fee.

705
00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:04.450
it helps us keep the lights on and gives you a better deal.

706
00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:07.750
One more time for the I extended for that extended free trial.

707
00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:09.730
Hulu plus.com/bill.

708
00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.150
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

709
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:15.230
<v 4>All right.
There you go.
They,
you go,
um,
hey bill,</v>

710
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.900
I need some advice about what a girl did to me.

711
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:22.400
What this fucking broad did to me over [inaudible].
Uh,

712
00:44:22.401 --> 00:44:26.870
he see this person says,
okay.
So I started talking to this girl and we hung out.

713
00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:31.240
You know what?
We had some fun.
She's beautiful.

714
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.170
<v 0>She</v>

715
00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:35.070
<v 4>has a great personality.
Fyi,</v>

716
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.950
what pisses me off is the way she led me on by telling me how lucky she was to

717
00:44:40.951 --> 00:44:43.710
have met me and all this other bullshit.

718
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:48.090
So I started to fall for this broad over there.
Uh,

719
00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:52.440
she's the first girl that I ever fell in love with a,
this is way,

720
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:57.840
oh wait,
this is,
she's the first girl that I ever felt this this way before.

721
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:02.760
Now was that Mia,
him,
she's the first girl that I ever felt this way before.

722
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:06.180
Now that's him.
And it's both our first year in college.

723
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.190
So out of fucking nowhere,

724
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.240
she tells me that she's got a fucking boyfriend,

725
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.790
which got me fucking Matt guys dropping the F bomb them.
I'm,

726
00:45:15.791 --> 00:45:16.624
I'm believing it here.

727
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.480
So my question is why did she lead me on just to drop me for some mother Fucker,

728
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.590
uh,
as this Guy Mexican for some other fucker.
Uh,

729
00:45:25.591 --> 00:45:29.640
I'm stupid because I still liked her,
sent me straight pill.

730
00:45:29.641 --> 00:45:33.000
And tell me what you would do in that situation and if that ever happened to you

731
00:45:33.001 --> 00:45:37.950
before.
Thanks.
Um,
oh,
Jesus didn't ever happen.
Absolutely.

732
00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:42.600
I've been both of those people.
I've been the Dosha and I've been you.

733
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:48.030
Um,
all right,
let's see here.
Why did she do that?

734
00:45:48.031 --> 00:45:52.020
Because she's young.
You're both young.
Let it go,
man.
She could have,

735
00:45:52.021 --> 00:45:56.760
she could have done what could have happened to you is so much worse.

736
00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.780
Okay.
She could've,
uh,
I dunno,

737
00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.380
you could have married,
had a couple of kids with her and then,

738
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:07.260
then you find out that she wants to be with somebody else that could happen and

739
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:12.030
you got off easy.
You're young,
you're in the prime,
uh,
your fucking life.

740
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.600
You know,
you're in your first year of college,
Dude.
You're,

741
00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:19.590
you're a number one draft pick.
You got your whole life ahead of you.
You know,

742
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:21.450
I mean like,

743
00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:26.450
like the level of fucking that you could be bang and right now just out of she,

744
00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:27.750
she the,

745
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:32.730
the sheer potential that you life still has and what's great about at your age,

746
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:34.110
you don't really have to prove anything.

747
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.140
All you have to do is be majoring in something that sounds like there's a bunch

748
00:46:37.141 --> 00:46:40.860
of cash at the end of the rainbow.
You tell a fucking couple jokes.

749
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:44.550
You're in there.
Okay.
So whatever,
you know,
look,

750
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:47.470
here's one way to look at it.
You know,
you got it.

751
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:50.910
Let's just say that she isn't just young and immature cause that's what that

752
00:46:50.911 --> 00:46:54.780
sounds like.
Um,
that's,

753
00:46:54.781 --> 00:46:56.010
that's best case scenario.

754
00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:01.040
She might be an absolute psycho at which point you totally got off easy because,

755
00:47:02.041 --> 00:47:06.500
uh,
she's out of your life.
So when I would do is,
uh,

756
00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.150
what I always say,
this is what you want to do.
Next time you see it,

757
00:47:10.151 --> 00:47:11.880
you're going to look great because you're going to go to the gym,

758
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.440
you're going to get fucking jacked.
All right,

759
00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.590
I'm going to get in the best shape of your fucking life.

760
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.830
And you're going to start hitting on ass fucking two,

761
00:47:19.831 --> 00:47:23.250
three levels above her and one of them's going to say,
yes,

762
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.530
it's a law of averages.
Then someday you'll run into her and be like,

763
00:47:28.531 --> 00:47:32.770
would you look at that fucking broken down hunk of shit that I actually was

764
00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:35.170
worried about?
You know,

765
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:39.790
now look at me and I'm not saying this new girl isn't going to crush your toe.

766
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.670
<v 2>Okay.</v>

767
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:44.180
<v 4>That's,
that was bad for me to say that.</v>

768
00:47:44.181 --> 00:47:47.120
I'm going to get you in the point where you can't trust people.
But,
uh,
you know,

769
00:47:47.121 --> 00:47:50.720
so it's,
uh,
it's one of the,
uh,

770
00:47:50.721 --> 00:47:55.220
one of the growing pains of finally finding whoever the fuck he supposed to be

771
00:47:55.221 --> 00:47:58.940
with.
I guess,
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm sorry she did that to you.
This sucks.

772
00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:02.030
Um,
I have had that happen to me.
I was,
uh,

773
00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.040
how can I tell this story without getting anybody in trouble?
Um,

774
00:48:07.041 --> 00:48:10.790
it was one of my earlier relationships.
Uh,
this woman was a musician.

775
00:48:10.791 --> 00:48:14.600
She was a lot older than I was,
and she was in a band.

776
00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:17.990
Uh,
and there was another dude in the band,

777
00:48:17.991 --> 00:48:22.580
was married to another chick that was in the band.
And um,

778
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:24.300
you know,

779
00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.990
she quit her day job and started spending a lot of time over this guy's house

780
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:31.290
writing.
I'm doing the air quotes right now,
writing,

781
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.110
working on music,
writing.

782
00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:36.960
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

783
00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.590
<v 4>Uh,
the dude's wife was getting upset,
was saying,</v>

784
00:48:40.591 --> 00:48:44.250
I don't like you spending all this time with this other woman.
He said,

785
00:48:44.251 --> 00:48:46.950
it's innocent.
We're just writing.

786
00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:51.420
We're over here writing.
And um,

787
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.990
<v 0>okay.</v>

788
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.730
<v 4>My girl came home to me and said she was upset that this other broad whatever,</v>

789
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.680
think that,
oh my God,
how the fuck,
you know,
uh,

790
00:48:59.681 --> 00:49:01.960
that she would have a do something like that.
She's like,

791
00:49:01.961 --> 00:49:05.230
I would never do something like that.
I love the guy.
But as a friend,

792
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:07.420
I'm just over there writing.

793
00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.240
Long story short,
me and this woman breakup,

794
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:21.500
I start a comedy career and about a year and a half later I'm doing a show

795
00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:26.360
and uh,
who comes up to,

796
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:28.280
who comes up to me at the end of the show,

797
00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:33.850
the wife of the guy that my old girlfriend was writing with and I say,

798
00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:37.760
good to see Ya.
She's like,
yeah,
I can't believe you're doing comedy.

799
00:49:37.761 --> 00:49:41.540
That's awesome.
Hey,
it's great to see and all that type shit.
And I was like,
hey,

800
00:49:41.541 --> 00:49:44.810
where's so and so?
And she goes,
oh,

801
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.620
she's with your girl,
your ex girlfriend now in our,
uh,

802
00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:51.970
and I was just like,
Jesus Christ.
And uh,

803
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:57.790
I realized that they probably were not writing when we were dating.

804
00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:07.190
And I would love to tell you that I only had one of those stories,
but I,

805
00:50:07.191 --> 00:50:09.510
I had a number of those.
I had like a,

806
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:11.390
<v 0>okay,</v>

807
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:15.680
<v 4>I had like three women that I know of that did that,
you know,</v>

808
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.250
and then I fucked around two in relationships.
Simon,
where are you going to go?

809
00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:23.150
Wait a little,
give some,
you take some more.
What are you going to do?
It happens.

810
00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:27.440
It happens.
People,
human beings,
they fuck up.
They make mistakes,
you know,

811
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:30.530
but you got off easy.
You got it easy.
Jesus Christ.

812
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.370
I told you that fucking story didn't I?
I know I told this one before that time.

813
00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:39.140
Um,
uh,
oh my God,
that was right when I knew I was going to be a comic.

814
00:50:39.141 --> 00:50:44.060
I was,
I went to one of her shows and they were in this band.

815
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.060
I can't say the name of the band.
All right.

816
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:48.620
I'm not trying to get anybody in trouble.

817
00:50:48.621 --> 00:50:51.740
But they made these sweatshirts for the band that they were selling after the

818
00:50:51.741 --> 00:50:56.210
show and they were all white and they said the name of the band in like this

819
00:50:56.211 --> 00:50:59.210
Miami Vice Pastel.
Okay.

820
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.990
And it's the early 90.
So the Pastel look,
his fucking,

821
00:51:02.991 --> 00:51:06.170
at least that was mid eighties this is early nineties.

822
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:10.160
So they're going to sell these after the show.

823
00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:15.220
And the woman I was dating said she wanted me to wear the sweat shirt during

824
00:51:16.491 --> 00:51:20.010
their fucking shell.
And I was,

825
00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:23.370
everything in me was screaming,
going,
I don't want to do this.

826
00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.760
I don't want to do this.
But for some reason,
I was at that age,
I was,

827
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:29.310
I was afraid of having a confrontation.

828
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:31.873
<v 2>MMM.</v>

829
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:38.890
<v 4>And I,
I fucking did it anyways.
I sat in the crowd at their fucking show.</v>

830
00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:43.540
They had an outdoor show during the day and I sat there with a sweatshirt on,

831
00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.630
written in Pastel with the name of their band.

832
00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:53.170
Ugh.
All right.
You know,

833
00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:59.820
that's unfuckable why didn't I just say that was so much of my adult life was

834
00:51:59.821 --> 00:52:02.640
learning to just say,
no,
I don't want to do this.

835
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:04.363
<v 2>MMM.</v>

836
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:08.270
<v 4>You know,
cause I,
I had like more of a,
uh,
you know,
yeah.</v>

837
00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:13.410
My childhood upbringing was like,
shut the fuck up.
You know,

838
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:18.750
when that is,
like the communication that is going on as you're growing up,

839
00:52:18.751 --> 00:52:23.751
like you will find yourself sitting at a show wearing a sweatshirt with pastel

840
00:52:25.741 --> 00:52:30.480
riding on it and not knowing that you have all the power to be like,

841
00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:35.280
I don't want to do this and take it off.
Um,
or just not put it on.

842
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:36.910
<v 2>Okay.</v>

843
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:37.360
<v 4>You know,</v>

844
00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.260
but I'm glad I didn't say no because the only way I knew how to say no then was

845
00:52:41.261 --> 00:52:44.770
I really would've hurt her.
I couldn't just say,
listen.
Um,

846
00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:50.770
I'm not wearing it.
It's to a feminine.
Okay.
Do you have any guy ones?

847
00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.160
You know,
you got a black one in there with like,

848
00:52:54.161 --> 00:52:59.140
it's written in something other than pink and Aqua fucking blow.

849
00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:05.290
All right.
I always getting no vital.
If I really loved her,

850
00:53:05.291 --> 00:53:08.950
I wouldn't,
wouldn't add a problem if I was really comfortable too.
Why was,

851
00:53:08.951 --> 00:53:13.120
I would have fucking,
I would've cut the sleeves off.
I would have tied it off,

852
00:53:13.121 --> 00:53:16.630
right.
Just fucking skip right down the aisle.
Professing my love.

853
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:17.740
But I didn't love her,

854
00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.920
so I don't give a shit that she banged that guy in the band.
Good for her.

855
00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:24.250
Good on you,
lady from my life.

856
00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:29.190
Fucking 25 fucking years ago.
Oh,
Jesus.

857
00:53:29.191 --> 00:53:33.720
That was an old Jesus one right there.
That was another yet a zillion oh,
Jesus.

858
00:53:33.721 --> 00:53:38.130
Moment in my life.
Love it.
I had a rough one,
I'll say,
you know,
um,

859
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.220
anyways,
football season's coming up.

860
00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:46.840
I'm so fucking excited,
man.
I'm actually more excited for the,
uh,

861
00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:51.760
I'm more excited for college football.
I can't fucking wait.
Oh,
let me tell you,

862
00:53:51.761 --> 00:53:55.000
I can't fucking wait.
You know,
and I don't have any dates.

863
00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.750
I don't have that many dates.
This,
uh,
this fall,

864
00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:02.500
I'm just in town building up my new hour cause I'm not going to go out in the

865
00:54:02.501 --> 00:54:06.340
road and fuck people over and do the same shit I did the last time.

866
00:54:06.341 --> 00:54:08.080
And then I'll,
I just fuck myself over.

867
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:09.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

868
00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:11.800
<v 4>That's not the way to do it.
Um,</v>

869
00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:12.750
<v 0>okay.</v>

870
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:17.390
<v 4>And I'm also a,
I got a little project and I'm writing that you guy,</v>

871
00:54:17.391 --> 00:54:21.710
it might see the light of day at some point,
you know?
Oh,

872
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.120
fucking freckles.
Oh,
freckles.
You know,

873
00:54:24.121 --> 00:54:26.700
you're hanging around Hollywood long enough.
They might give you something.

874
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.260
I'll tell you,
be careful what you wish for.
Um,

875
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:36.210
what did I want to talk about?
Oh by the way,
if you,
if you enjoy this podcast,

876
00:54:36.211 --> 00:54:40.710
if you enjoy the ramblings of a man sitting in his boxers in the middle of a

877
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:44.490
Sunday afternoon about ready to go to a pool party,
um,

878
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:49.030
and you want to donate,
but you don't really want,
just want to give me money,

879
00:54:49.031 --> 00:54:50.470
you want to get something out of it,

880
00:54:50.471 --> 00:54:54.430
just go to [inaudible] dot com you click on the podcast page and you go over to

881
00:54:54.431 --> 00:54:57.700
the Amazon,
uh,
banner and you click on that.

882
00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

883
00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:02.360
<v 4>And go buy yourself something doesn't cost you any extra money.
And Amazon goes,</v>

884
00:55:02.361 --> 00:55:06.440
Hey,
is a couple of bucks to sending them our way.
We appreciate it.
And that Nice.

885
00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:10.820
Isn't that lovely?
Isn't that how the world work?
Um,

886
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:16.160
I actually last week said underrated and I said it was Amazon's fucking iTunes

887
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:18.370
thing that they have and these cunts,

888
00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:23.330
I just want the music and now they're trying to set up this cloud thing for me.

889
00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.193
It's just like,

890
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.320
<v 0>okay,</v>

891
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.860
<v 4>like welcome to Amazon music.
Here's a few tips to get you started.</v>

892
00:55:28.861 --> 00:55:32.160
Please don't exit the APP while we load your library.

893
00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:33.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

894
00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:37.300
<v 4>And then they got this little circle thing with that fucking cloud switch</v>

895
00:55:37.301 --> 00:55:41.140
between your cloud and your computer libraries.
Go Fuck Yourself.

896
00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:42.200
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

897
00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.090
<v 4>Why do you have to have my music?</v>

898
00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:48.050
This is what I don't like about all these fucking,
this computer shit.

899
00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:51.200
I just can't walk in and buy something and leave.
They got,

900
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:54.140
they got to take a piece of me.
They got to figure out what's he into.

901
00:55:54.141 --> 00:55:55.310
What's he doing,
man?

902
00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:59.450
They're like some psycho chick your banger one fucking time and she's got a

903
00:55:59.451 --> 00:56:04.020
fucking at least get a tee shirt out of it.
You know why?

904
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:09.080
Why does my music have to live on your site?
I hate that fucking word.

905
00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.910
They're just to try and to hang onto you to just keep getting more fucking
money.

906
00:56:13.911 --> 00:56:15.260
They like,
they like leeches.

907
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:21.910
I'm just gonna go back to buying records.
I swear to God.
No,

908
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.350
the only thing I do like about

909
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:27.340
the iPod and the iPhone is that you can listen to all that music.

910
00:56:27.341 --> 00:56:29.440
Why you fucking walk around are you in the car?

911
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:33.310
That's tremendous that you can actually do that.
But um,

912
00:56:34.410 --> 00:56:35.160
<v 0>yeah.</v>

913
00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:39.990
<v 4>Other than that,
the fucking trade off these fucking assholes.</v>

914
00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.560
I hate when I,
like I even,
I even go into stores now and I'm just like,
yeah,

915
00:56:43.561 --> 00:56:47.190
I'm just paying cash.
I'm just paying cash and they still scan something.

916
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:51.120
They,
we scans it.
Oh,
do you want to make sure you get the discount?
It's like,

917
00:56:51.121 --> 00:56:51.870
let me get this straight.

918
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:56.870
You just went out of your way to to have your company make less money and

919
00:56:57.451 --> 00:57:00.540
they're okay with that.
There's no fucking way.
That's all that is.

920
00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:02.580
That is somehow trying to collect data.

921
00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:04.920
At the very least effect that I paid cash.

922
00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:09.900
They're at least doing some sort of moving like a inventory of their shit,

923
00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.180
but if I use like what I hate is I go,
hey,

924
00:57:12.181 --> 00:57:14.220
you got a little savvy save fucking card and I go,

925
00:57:14.221 --> 00:57:17.010
no I don't and I don't want you don't scan anything.

926
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:22.180
I'll swipe my card and then they fucking stay.
Stay scan something.
I'm like,

927
00:57:22.181 --> 00:57:24.340
what the fuck did what?
Why did you just do that?
Oh,

928
00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:26.890
you're putting me in the system.

929
00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:32.440
I just want to get my fucking tooth paste and leave.

930
00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.500
What do you then watch me from a fucking satellite?

931
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.980
He switched brands of toothpaste.
What does that mean?

932
00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.310
How can we get more money out of him?
He's fucking assholes.

933
00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:49.880
I swear to God they'd done that to me at at,
at the pharmacy like two times.

934
00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:54.710
And is is it?
As you can see,
it's driving me up the fucking wall.
You only need,

935
00:57:54.711 --> 00:57:57.590
that drives me even more up the wall is the people that don't,

936
00:57:57.591 --> 00:58:01.540
that are so fucking dumb.
They don't care.
Let me,
well,

937
00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:04.840
why do I give a fuck?
Where did fuck if you'd figured,

938
00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:06.970
it's like they're making money off of you.

939
00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:13.130
They're taking your private information and then what they do with that is they

940
00:58:13.141 --> 00:58:17.760
then sell it.
They share it with other businesses as they build a file on you.

941
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:20.010
Shouldn't your private information

942
00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:20.950
<v 0>okay</v>

943
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:25.710
<v 4>or information on you.
Okay.
Maybe because you bought it in the store,</v>

944
00:58:25.711 --> 00:58:29.310
it's not private,
but like shouldn't you get a cut of that?

945
00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:32.860
This setting up this behind the music thing,

946
00:58:32.861 --> 00:58:35.530
where are they going to own the rights to everything that you fucking do and

947
00:58:35.531 --> 00:58:38.440
what shouldn't you get a cut of like a

948
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:39.820
<v 0>yeah.</v>

949
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:40.640
<v 4>You know,
we,
we,</v>

950
00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:44.750
we shared this information or what kind of toothpaste you like with fucking arm

951
00:58:44.751 --> 00:58:47.950
and hammer over here and they gave us,
you know,
eight bucks for that.
Good.

952
00:58:47.951 --> 00:58:51.890
Well give me two bucks.
Cause if I didn't walk into your fucking store,

953
00:58:51.891 --> 00:58:54.410
you got know you had nothing to sell this.
I walk into your store.

954
00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:55.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

955
00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:58.900
<v 4>I'm bringing something of value and I would like my fucking $2 at least pay me.</v>

956
00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.510
It's the principle of the thing.
Jesus,
look at that.
I made it.

957
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:07.830
I made it coming up on an hour.
Fucking tremendous.
Um,

958
00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:10.910
all right.
Speaking of downloads,

959
00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.890
I was talking last week about that Aretha Franklin,
Ohio.

960
00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:17.390
I want to try to download her early albums like ink,

961
00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:22.700
like complete albums because uh,

962
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:23.720
you know,

963
00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:28.250
cause she's a refill and all they do is just play a fucking her greatest hits.

964
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:33.290
You know what I mean?
They don't have shit like this.
You know this one,

965
00:59:33.291 --> 00:59:37.590
listen to this shit.
Yeah.

966
00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:46.403
<v 6>Say,</v>

967
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:51.043
<v 5>Oh,</v>

968
00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:56.990
<v 4>come on.
Where was that song?
They always play respect.</v>

969
00:59:58.050 --> 01:00:01.650
You better think they never play this song,
you know,

970
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:04.860
wanting to be free.

971
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:14.460
C'Mon.
It's saying to the world.
She's the shit.

972
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.280
I was thinking,
you know,
I chose,
didn't have it.
I can go over to Amazon.

973
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:25.110
This is the more mom and pop place.
I'll fucking dumb am I,
you know,

974
01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.660
I just realized I'm bitching about this thing and I actually have a banner of

975
01:00:28.661 --> 01:00:33.530
them on my site.
I'm in bed with these horse.
Yeah.

976
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.220
Um,
oh Jesus.
You know what that is?

977
01:00:36.221 --> 01:00:41.100
That's hypocritical behavior or am I just that stupid?
We'll let you decide.
Well,

978
01:00:41.101 --> 01:00:44.280
that's the podcast for this week.
Everybody.
I'm really excited about football,

979
01:00:44.281 --> 01:00:49.160
college football coming up.
Um,
baseball playoffs.
I was playoffs.

980
01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:53.000
I liked those.
You know,
October,
uh,

981
01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.780
the red sox have completely shit the bed.

982
01:00:54.781 --> 01:00:57.360
I guess they let everybody go and you know,
it's weird.
That's when I get into it.

983
01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.150
That's what I love them.
We'll sit in their rooting for form against the angels.

984
01:01:00.151 --> 01:01:02.980
Every time I looked up,
they will fucking lose it,
you know?
But,

985
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.170
but Troy is still getting up there,
swinging for the fences.
Yeah.

986
01:01:07.171 --> 01:01:11.640
What are you going to do?
Any football predictions,
bill?
Uh,
no,

987
01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:14.350
no.
I have no idea what's going on.
I don't want you to draft.

988
01:01:14.351 --> 01:01:17.800
I don't play fantasy football.
I don't collect football cards anymore.

989
01:01:17.801 --> 01:01:21.630
I am completely out of the fucking loop.
I have no idea what's going to happen.

990
01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.170
I think the,
uh,
I think the jet's got a little stronger.

991
01:01:25.171 --> 01:01:28.140
I think we got a little weaker.
I think buffalo got a little stronger.
I think,

992
01:01:28.141 --> 01:01:31.560
you know,
we're,
we're kind of in our swan song of Tom Brady.

993
01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:34.110
He's in the final third of his career.

994
01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.050
He has the ability to win another Superbowl,

995
01:01:37.051 --> 01:01:40.130
but I just don't know if we're going to be able to get them the right players in

996
01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.280
time.
Uh,
what I'm kind of feeling.
But at the end of it,

997
01:01:44.281 --> 01:01:47.770
he won three of them,
you know,
can't get mad about that.

998
01:01:47.771 --> 01:01:51.520
And he's also one of the legends right up there with Larry Bobby Teddy Ballgame,

999
01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:55.900
Bill Russell and all those motherfuckers.
MMM.
And okay,
that's it.

1000
01:01:55.930 --> 01:02:00.040
That's the podcast for this week,
ladies and Gentlemen,
Gentlemen and ladies.

1001
01:02:01.330 --> 01:02:05.230
Okay,
let's be fair to the women here.
Okay.
They want equal rights.

1002
01:02:05.231 --> 01:02:08.230
So every once in a while you'd have to go second.
Gentlemen and ladies,

1003
01:02:08.231 --> 01:02:13.150
I am off to a fucking pool party.
Uh,
I hope I'm not going to be sunburned.

1004
01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.750
Um,
uh,
it's just the worst.
I want to feel like the boy in the bubble.

1005
01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.980
I'll be the guy like under the umbrella with my knees up in my chest.

1006
01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:27.830
It doesn't make any sense that my skin is this fucking light and that sun does

1007
01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:32.940
what it does to my skin.
I've been to Ireland,
I've been there.
It's sunny.

1008
01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:38.500
I don't get it.
I guess Scandinavia when you get out,

1009
01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:42.010
but I don't have any Scandinavian blood.
The fuck did that come from?

1010
01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:43.380
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1011
01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:48.070
<v 4>Scotland,
I guess it rains all the time.
I Dunno.</v>

1012
01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:51.010
I think I'm just weird.
All right,
everybody,
that's a podcast this week.

1013
01:02:51.011 --> 01:02:55.450
Go fuck yourselves.
Have a wonderful week and I will talk to you next Monday.
