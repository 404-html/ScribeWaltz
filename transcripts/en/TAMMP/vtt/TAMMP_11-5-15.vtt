1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.650
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr.
Did I say that too quickly?

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.620
Did I not wait till it turned on?
I don't fucking know.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.350
All I know is I don't have time to do this shit today because I've got to run to

4
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:13.850
the airport.
So this is bill burr and this is time for the Thursday afternoon.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.280
Monday morning plowed kits just before Friday.
And just checking,

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.010
just checking in on you.
Um,
my wife is still sleeping downstairs and um,

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.350
I don't even think I have time to do a half hour,

8
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:30.090
so I'll tell my guy to tack on a little more.
Mr Mullis to tack on,

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.140
uh,
you know enough time so it fucking works out.
All right.

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.540
I'm on my way out to a Philadelphia.
Um,

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.430
and uh,
I actually didn't know American Airlines flew director.
Now you know why?

12
00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:48.210
Cause they bought fucking USA.
Eh,

13
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.140
it's like fucking nine airlines left.
That's like the race right now.

14
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.630
You know who's going to own everything.

15
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.320
Like all the airlines first are all the banks.
Either way,

16
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:00.180
you're not going to have any fucking options,
right?

17
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:01.770
It's going to be all American Airlines.

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.120
Is this is what the prices would you rather walk?
Yeah.

19
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.080
Won't shut your fucking mouth thing gets done.
It's a plane.

20
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.470
We'll put you down by say luggage.
Um,

21
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.080
so anyways,
um,

22
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.300
I actually got a few more suggestions about a cheese steaks when I go to,
um,

23
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.480
Philly of course I don't have them in front of me because I just had to take my

24
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:29.010
fucking dog out.
He's been up all night.
She had the shits.
So,
uh,

25
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.640
I'll be looking at him up.
So I think I'm going to get to one in the afternoon,

26
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:33.930
one at night,
you know,

27
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.930
just gradually give back all the fucking weight that I took off.

28
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.370
I'm up to a buck 73,
uh,
brutal,
but,
um,

29
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.720
I just got to hang in there and maintain like once 71 to [inaudible] 73.

30
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.760
You know,
I worked out yesterday,

31
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.450
I just took my dog for a hike and it's going to maintain this shit and I just

32
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:56.160
got to make it to November 16th cause then I'm basically off for the rest of the

33
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.210
fucking year.
My years done,
it winds down and uh,
you know,

34
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.340
and I'll just work out like a madman and then it's great.

35
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:06.840
Last time I was like one 87 when I had to drop down.
Now I'm just one 73.

36
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.880
That's all right.
Right.
Ooh.
Um,
so anyways,
yeah,

37
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:15.960
my dog last night
fucking thing.
I don't know what happened.

38
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:19.920
It just was just,
I dunno,
it's starting to get old man.

39
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:21.120
It's kind of freaking me out man.

40
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:23.430
It's kind of having like if I don't take it out enough,
it started,

41
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.480
it's bladder is a little bit weak I guess when you get them spayed or neutered

42
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.990
that that can be a side effect,
which it never was.

43
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.640
And I took her out in the morning and I gave her a bath cause I knew I wasn't

44
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:39.180
going to see her for a few days.
So you know,
wanting to have her up on the couch,

45
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.680
you know,
watching the Hawks fucking blues game.
Right.

46
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.880
That was the game plan.
What ends up happening,
you know,

47
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:50.790
I forgot I didn't take her out for,
you know,
I waited too long.

48
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.300
She ended up fucking tinkling on the goddamn couch.

49
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.620
And then I had to take a route and then my wife is just like,
you know,

50
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:00.760
we're not going to see each other for a couple of days.

51
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:05.410
So there goes the fucking hockey game,
right?
One of the great ones of the year,

52
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.470
black cocks go up five to two in the first period,

53
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:12.220
scored five fucking goals in the first period.

54
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.310
And you would think the blues,
all that shit for them.

55
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.980
Thanks for playing.
Go get yourself some deep dish,
right?

56
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.480
All of a sudden it's five to three,
right?
Five to four,
I think after two.

57
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.000
And then they tie it up.
Five,
five and then an overtime.

58
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.950
Vladimir data's Tech Goals scored the game winner.
Um,
I actually,

59
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:37.180
all I did was watch the highlights.
Um,
just fucking,
just,

60
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.640
it just seemed like a fucking dog.

61
00:03:38.641 --> 00:03:42.820
That's one of those games like a basketball fan could enjoy like a true hockey

62
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:45.540
purist would be like,
you know,
there was no goaltending.

63
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.940
There was no d or whatever the fuck they would start fucking whining about.

64
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.050
You know,
like those kinds of people in baseball that enjoy a pitcher's duel?

65
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.920
I don't mind a pitcher's duel if they just mowing people down and they keeping

66
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:57.401
it moving,

67
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:00.430
but if they're grabbing than nuts and tugging on their fucking shoulders,

68
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.540
you know,
and it's taking nine fucking hours basically.

69
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.220
If it doesn't happen in October or in April,
I don't give a shit.

70
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.690
Like,
uh,
I'm really country towards baseball.
I don't know what happened.

71
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.230
I used to be that guy that could watch a game in May,
June,
July,
and August.

72
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:20.890
I'm just not anymore.
It's got to be April.
Like,
oh the summer's coming.

73
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:23.380
Take me out to the ball game,

74
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.100
take me out to that crowd.
Pay In full park.

75
00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.040
And they've blocked off all the streets.

76
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.480
So they own everything and they can compete with the Yankees.
And then I,

77
00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:39.790
I liked it to get an October.
That's basically it.
Oh,
by the way,
by the way,

78
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.970
respect to the fucking Kansas City royal fence.

79
00:04:41.971 --> 00:04:46.870
You just see how many fucking people showed up.
Jesus Christ.
I mean,
granted,

80
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:50.560
they hadn't won it 30 years.
So,
you know,
there's a bunch,
you realize,

81
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:51.670
think about that 30 years,

82
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:56.350
how quick that fucking goes by 30 fucking years goes by.

83
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.300
That means if they want it when you were like fucking 18,

84
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.350
how was I was 17 the last time they want it.
You're thinking how they want it.

85
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.570
You know,
they came close to 1980.
They fucking,
you know,

86
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.110
did great and 76,
77,
78.
This is what it's going to be like.
And then it,

87
00:05:15.111 --> 00:05:19.510
they just drop off the fucking table.
And next thing you know,

88
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:22.030
you're 47 years old going,
oh yeah,

89
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.330
I remember when they won that in high school.
It was,

90
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:30.100
I like 2030 years ago,
one of those deals,

91
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.080
you just feel like you're fucking 9,000 years old.
Um,
but anyways,

92
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:37.540
yeah,
a bunch of people showed up.
I mean,

93
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:42.040
that looked like that rivaled the red sox won when,
uh,
when they broke the curse.

94
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.760
And that was only 30 years.
So a great baseball fans,
as you knew they would be,

95
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.460
were incredible football fence.
So,
um,

96
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.010
and I don't know why dude,
I actually kind of became a fucking mets fan,

97
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.870
which goes against everything.
You know,
I'm supposed to,

98
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:04.400
you know,
hate every team from fucking New York.
But,
uh,
Mike Price,

99
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.130
one of the cocreators F is for family from the Simpsons,

100
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.230
a sweetheart of a guy.
He's just such a fucking sweetheart.

101
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.910
I just wanted him to be happy
and I said he's not happy.

102
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.810
I wanted them to see a championship because he was watching.

103
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.000
Remember last year when we started writing the show,
like they,

104
00:06:24.001 --> 00:06:24.860
they met,

105
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:29.861
swore in a good physician and they just started tanking and he,

106
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.620
and he had seen,
he had like,
you know,
I was like,
how did they do last night?

107
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:38.060
He goes,
they lost.
And he laughed.
I go,
Oh man,
that's,
I'm sorry,
Yoga.

108
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.730
You're gonna Watch them again tonight.
And he laughed and he goes,
yeah.
He goes,

109
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:44.840
we'll probably blow it again.
Like,
that's,
that's a real fan,
you know what I mean?

110
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.070
Like,
um,
when forsee was given,
um,
was talking shit about,

111
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:51.400
I'm not shit,
he was just talking to me going to,

112
00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:56.210
do you see how few mets fans were left last night when Casey clinched it?

113
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:59.570
That's a disgrace and blah,
blah blah blah blah.
And it's like,
it really isn't.

114
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:03.140
That's actually the norm because when your team sucks,

115
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.580
your stadium is half full.
All right?

116
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.770
When they get good it's full.

117
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.300
And then when they start to suck again and they start losing its,

118
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:17.990
it looks like they're definitely going to lose like half the stadium empties
out.

119
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:22.991
So really every team only has enough fans to fill up true fans to fill up half

120
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:28.100
the stadium.
All right.
All those extra seats are for when they're good.

121
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.240
Does that make sense?
Especially the ones down around home plate,

122
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.500
the ones that you see on TV,
cause those are all hookups.
You know what I mean?

123
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.150
Have you ever walked up to the gate to buy baseball tickets?
And they're like,

124
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:45.650
yeah,
hey,
can I,
yeah.
Can I get two tickets for,

125
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:47.150
uh,
for the fucking whatever.

126
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:49.070
Whoever the fuck they playing for the pirates or whatever,

127
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:51.680
what do you got available?
Then they got like two right behind home plate.

128
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:54.830
Never happens.
Those are Illuminati tickets,
right?

129
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.040
Those are the people who work at like Nabisco,
right in blue.

130
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:00.230
Some guy from Nestle,
you know,

131
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:03.140
and gave money to Hillary Clinton is something that,
those are the people,

132
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.610
the kids,
the kids are those people that suck.
Some of the register.

133
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.760
Their kids get to sit down there.
Right.
And they don't appreciate it.
You know,

134
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:15.470
they show up in their fucking Ferrari,

135
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.470
they got an eight ball and they're fucking shirt pocket.

136
00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:21.960
The second eight oh three stiff down by three runs,
they're out of there.

137
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.050
They're already craving to do another bump.
You know,

138
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.970
either that or you're fucking,

139
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.110
you like a hundred years old and you got your bottom way,
way,

140
00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:39.890
way back in the day.
But even then,
once they'd fucking build a new stadium,

141
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.760
they end up squeezing out.
Right?
And when it comes out,

142
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:48.320
the local newspaper write some article about Joe Sixpack an hour.

143
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:53.300
Now he's at the top of the stadium and the fucking ownership goes,
well,

144
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:58.230
they're going to look into that at this day and age in order to maintain a

145
00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:02.390
competitive table.
But we have to look at the lake,
look at our phone,
right?

146
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.390
And then the whole story goes away.
And then those,
those,

147
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.680
those people up there that Bruce Springsteen and John Cougar Mellencamp boy he's

148
00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:13.460
singing about,
right.
Then Al Gore talks about when he talks about,

149
00:09:13.461 --> 00:09:18.200
I tilled the land I held,
I held,
held that tobacco between my fingers.

150
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.160
I don't know why he sounds like George Bush probably because I'm limited when it

151
00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:25.130
comes to a impersonations.
Right?

152
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

153
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.510
<v 0>Those people,
they're all up there.
Those people,
right.</v>

154
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.430
People that work for 11 people is still tell racist jokes,
you know,

155
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:39.140
at an inappropriate time.
Those people,
the backbone of this country,
you know,

156
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:45.170
the silent majority
anyway,
fuck,
I'm talking about.

157
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.030
Yeah.
So my dog woke me up like three,

158
00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:50.870
four times last night and I remember thinking like,
wow,
this must be like what?

159
00:09:50.871 --> 00:09:54.440
It's like to have a new born baby.
And I thought about it for a second.

160
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.460
I was just like,
wow,
parents are still pussies because this isn't that bad.

161
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.820
You know?
As much as she got me up four times last night,

162
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:06.680
I'm deliberately just tea in the suffering.
Four toes.
Uhhh,
Troy for Toby.

163
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.950
I hate parents.
You know,
I fucking hate him.

164
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

165
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:19.130
<v 0>I is there anything worse than watching two people make a conscious fucking</v>

166
00:10:19.131 --> 00:10:23.960
decision to change their life and then whine about it or one of fucking metal

167
00:10:23.961 --> 00:10:26.640
for the rest of that God damn life.
All right.

168
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.140
You weren't diagnosed with the child.
There's no tragedy here.
Yeah.

169
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.190
You decided to have one or maybe it didn't,

170
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.940
but you knew how they were made so that your own fucking recklessness.

171
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.460
You got a fucking kid quit your fucking whining and just cause you got a fucking

172
00:10:43.461 --> 00:10:48.440
kid doesn't mean everything on TV has to turn into two fucking muppets throwing

173
00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:51.110
a beach ball around.
All right.

174
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.780
People who are adults who don't have kids should still be allowed to watch

175
00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:59.840
quality entertainment.
Alright,

176
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.640
how fucking hard is it to not have your kid watch that shit?

177
00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:06.050
Especially when they're really young.

178
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:11.840
You can't just walk up and turn on the TV like you could as a toddler walking
up,

179
00:11:11.841 --> 00:11:14.240
sucking your thumb.
You know,
coming in,

180
00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:16.910
dragging your blankie and you're fucking wearing your diaper.

181
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.550
He just come walking up.
He just reached up.
Stand on your tippy toes.

182
00:11:22.551 --> 00:11:25.550
Right?
And turn the fucking thing on.
Nine the remote,

183
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.890
all of those fucking buttons.

184
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.130
All you do is you just don't show the little maniac how to turn it on.

185
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.940
And then even if he knows how to turn it on,

186
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:35.840
you just keep the remote on top of the fridge.
Right.

187
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

188
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.730
<v 0>And you show him where you put it too.
Is there,
maybe I'll try to climb up.</v>

189
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.810
He falls down.
He hits his big head,
right.
Gets his first concussion.

190
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.200
Break them in.
You know,
like the way they used to break in a new car.

191
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:49.971
People used to think,

192
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:52.280
you go out there and you drive like a hundred fucking miles an hour.

193
00:11:52.281 --> 00:11:56.210
That was the way to break an engine to evidently it wasn't.
No,
it deadly.

194
00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.160
Toddlers fallen off a stool trying to get a remote control off the top of

195
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.410
refrigerator.
Banging their little soft heads isn't a good thing either.

196
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.620
It's not bad if a kid gets a concussion,
it's just sucks.

197
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:08.650
If they go bald later on in life,
could you see that flat side of their head?

198
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.173
You know what I mean?

199
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:19.540
I don't want to talking about,
um,
I had a great,
a great time being backyard,

200
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:24.010
unbelievably fucking tired by the way.
And uh,
I had a benefit to do,
uh,

201
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.000
Rhonda is kiss,

202
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:30.010
which is a great benefit that raises money for people who are diagnosed with

203
00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:33.640
cancer yet do not have the money to,
um,

204
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.180
to afford treatment because we don't have nationwide healthcare in this country

205
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:41.470
for whatever fucking reason.
It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

206
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.920
You know what I mean?
I love people who are against it.
It's like,

207
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.640
I so want to have nationwide health care because at least I'll get something for

208
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:51.300
my tax dollars.
I don't understand what it,

209
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.820
what are they doing with all the fucking money other than overpaying the

210
00:12:54.821 --> 00:12:58.860
constant,
put them in the office to go build a fucking bridge.
Ah.

211
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.370
So anyways,
um,
and this was put together by,
uh,

212
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.960
by Dave Cushner who's doing the music for a fourF is for family.

213
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.820
And Him and his wife Christine put the thing together and,
uh,

214
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.160
was I going to say the,
uh,
you know,
he's,
he's,
you know,

215
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:27.940
former guitarist of velvet revolver.
So there was all these fucking rock stars.

216
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:30.970
Arie asked me to come down and,
uh,

217
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:35.920
open the show and then of course he said,

218
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:38.050
hey,
do you want to play a song?
And that's my rule.

219
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.700
I won't force my hobby on anybody,
but if you ask me to play,
I will play.

220
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.460
You have been warned.
So,
um,

221
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.050
we ended up playing a whole lot of love and I somehow was able to fake my way

222
00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:54.940
through it.
And I got to play with a duff mckagan.
I swear to God.

223
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.470
Gilby Clarke and Cassia and then it was me.

224
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.860
It's fucking awesome.
And um,
what was funny was,

225
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.490
you know,
I kept bugging Dave going,
Dave,
what song am I going to play?

226
00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:10.600
What song am I going to play?
You know,

227
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:14.730
and he's so busy putting together the fucking event,
him and his wife are that,

228
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.110
uh,
you know,
he didn't get back to me until like three days before.
And he goes,

229
00:14:17.111 --> 00:14:21.460
you want to play a whole lot of love?
And I typed back,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Too difficult.

230
00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:25.090
And then I just said,
I fucking stop being a pussy.
So I write yes.
And he goes,

231
00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:28.900
all right,
cool.
So,
uh,
the event was Tuesday night and Monday.

232
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:30.191
You know,

233
00:14:30.191 --> 00:14:33.850
I came back basically Sunday after two weeks of fucking drinking and having not

234
00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:36.220
played drums in forever.

235
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.310
And also being a standup comic who really isn't even that good of a tremor.

236
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.440
And I went into the,
uh,

237
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.120
we went into rehearsal and I probably played the worst I've played in its,

238
00:14:46.121 --> 00:14:49.690
he was even bad for a comedian who sorta plays,

239
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.230
I was fucking up to fill that,
um,
entered the song.
You know,

240
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:58.610
those don't dump.
But that a dad,
a dad,
a dad,
God to go,
I was fucking that up.

241
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.920
And uh,
and I was just,
um,
I go,
dude,
it was fucking,

242
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:05.960
it was horrific.
It was fucking horrific.
I mean,

243
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:10.040
they would totally cool helping me a longer everything.
But,
uh,

244
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.120
the night before the Gig,
I couldn't sleep.
I was just laying there in bed going,

245
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:18.320
I'm going to fuck this up.
I'm going to fuck this up.
And I remember,
uh,

246
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.530
uh,
Gilby said,
hey,
just,
just make sure tomorrow that totally cool and supportive.

247
00:15:24.531 --> 00:15:27.350
He just goes to it.
Just make sure tomorrow when you come out,
he goes,

248
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:30.310
just really hit him,
hit him,
don't tickle them,
hit him.
And I'm thinking,
Oh God,

249
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.230
this guy thinks I hit like a bitch.
He thinks I'm a little girl.

250
00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:37.430
And I just sold the day of the fucking Gig.
When we were in Carson,

251
00:15:37.431 --> 00:15:39.070
there was no singer.
And I,
uh,

252
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.180
that was messing me up even more aside from the fact that I suck.
Right.
So,

253
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.620
um,
I ended up,
uh,
I went on,

254
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.280
I went online and I just looked up whole lot of love,
no drums,

255
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.440
and someone had just like,
you know,

256
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:57.260
put together this track where it wasn't Robert Plant's singing.

257
00:15:57.261 --> 00:15:59.750
So it's different phrasing than Robert did.

258
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.150
So all of it was enough to be a little bit different.

259
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.560
And I just played to that like a thousand fucking times.
And,
uh,

260
00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:11.390
we went down and did the Gig and I somehow pulled it off.
And,
uh,
you know,

261
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:16.550
I,
I don't think I fucked up too bad.
I didn't see anybody trashing me on the,

262
00:16:16.551 --> 00:16:19.160
uh,
on the Internet,
but a

263
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.100
duff was nice enough to walk over and stare at me during the,
that,

264
00:16:25.101 --> 00:16:30.060
those dunk.
Dot.
And he was just going,
one,
two,
three,
four,
one,
two,

265
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.580
three,
four.
Literally had to hold my hand through that.
And,
uh,

266
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.620
it was fucking great.
It went,
it went great.
And,
uh,
I still can't believe it.

267
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.240
I still can't believe I got to do that shit.
And,
um,
and it was the,

268
00:16:43.241 --> 00:16:47.360
one of the sickest fucking lineups.
I mean,
it was,

269
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:52.130
everybody was there,
man.
It was like a Dave Navarro,

270
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.780
duff mckagan,
Gilby Clarke,
Steve Stevens,

271
00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:58.591
Billy Morris.

272
00:16:58.591 --> 00:17:03.591
And Billy idol came out like his whole band came out with Josh Freese on drums.

273
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.730
I got to watch him the whole fucking night.

274
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.000
And then Billy Gibbons showed up out of fucking nowhere.
I swear to God,

275
00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:12.830
it was like a rock and roll hall of fame night.

276
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:18.170
Mark Mcgrath was hosting the thing was fucking killing me.
He was,

277
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.730
that guy is so fucking funny.

278
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:23.570
He was standing there and he was given everybody the intros and making everybody

279
00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:25.370
laugh,
you know,
as he was bringing out the bands.

280
00:17:25.371 --> 00:17:29.450
And at one point he just pointed out to nobody in the crowd and he just goes,

281
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:34.340
what did you say,
sir?
Did you just say,
hey mark,
why don't you sing a song?

282
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.570
A number one hit that you wrote in 1997.
Is that what you just said?
Well,

283
00:17:38.571 --> 00:17:41.630
absolutely.
And then he goes into that.
I just want to fly.

284
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:48.530
He was fucking hilarious.
So,
um,
I'm sure I'm leaving some people out.

285
00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.100
Uh,
oh,
Juliette Lewis fucking murdered it.
Fucking murdered.

286
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:57.780
It sank dirty deeds.
Um,
and accreted song,

287
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.330
it was fucking insane.
That's all I got to say.
We should,

288
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.750
it was absolutely fucking insane.
Um,
and uh,

289
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:09.060
I got to slip in there for like five seconds

290
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.830
and I just remember after I watched like the first,
you know,

291
00:18:13.831 --> 00:18:17.640
five or six songs go down in my jaws on the fucking ground.

292
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:21.760
Like I was literally like a,
I think I was speaking in falsetto like,
no,

293
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.980
you should have put me on first.
Um,
but whatever.

294
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:29.850
I survived it and it was a,
it was awesome.
So,
uh,
oh,

295
00:18:29.851 --> 00:18:34.260
but I didn't tell you about my,
the set I had,
I did walk out and do,
um,

296
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.510
I had to do stand up like I had,
they wanted me to do a half hour and like,

297
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.080
do you need to open for bands?
Man,
that shit.
Nine Times out of 10,

298
00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:47.670
that goes sideways.
It's like you show up this fuck everybody's standing up.

299
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.270
People that talking and you know,
they,

300
00:18:50.271 --> 00:18:52.140
they had to see music and that type of shit.

301
00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:55.680
So what I learned at that event is you just,

302
00:18:55.681 --> 00:18:59.670
you just sort of play to the pit the first four to 10 rows,

303
00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:02.540
he just played to them and then you just start going,
you know,

304
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.770
all people in the back,
if he,
if he could talk a little louder,

305
00:19:04.771 --> 00:19:05.401
that would be great.

306
00:19:05.401 --> 00:19:09.240
He just throw those in some self deprecating shit I probably shouldn't ended

307
00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:11.880
with go fuck yourself at a benefit.
You know,
looking back,

308
00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:16.860
I wish I didn't say that,
but uh,
other than that it was a,
uh,
an amazing night.

309
00:19:16.861 --> 00:19:20.940
So I want to thank everybody that Ron is kiss for having me on that thing.

310
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.700
I will obviously obviously do that.

311
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.720
I would have done in any ways if I could just do standup on it,

312
00:19:26.721 --> 00:19:29.130
forget about letting me sit in and all that type of stuff.

313
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:31.980
It was just a fucking incredible night.
Um,

314
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.430
I had fucked up to right before the show is starving and I won.

315
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.370
I walked down the street,
it was down,
it was at the El Rey theater,

316
00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:43.260
so it was on a wheelchair and I walked down.
And La is not a,
a walkable city,

317
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.320
so I'm just walking down the street and it's just like,
all right,

318
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.770
I hop five guys burgers and fries,

319
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.860
which by the way is so fucking overrated.
It's ridiculous.

320
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.550
But they're stupid bags of potatoes laying around like,
Ooh,

321
00:19:56.551 --> 00:19:58.020
look how healthy it is,
right.

322
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:06.130
You know,
and the fucking,
uh,
I ended up going to a chipotle.
I,

323
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.340
Ugh,
what a mistake.
I get three fucking tacos over.

324
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.270
I was really just walking down the street going,
all right,
what,

325
00:20:12.271 --> 00:20:14.160
what am I going to poison myself with?

326
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.250
There was some Japanese place who was all and no barbecue.

327
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.130
So I was joking like,
oh,
no bar.
Oh no barbecue.
We don't automate this.

328
00:20:26.131 --> 00:20:30.480
Right.
I was just like,
I'm not fucking eating there.
Right.
So I,
uh,

329
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.500
ended up going with chipotle lay and then that's not,
that's not good.

330
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.960
That's not good.
That's not a good look.

331
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.740
You don't want to shove three fucking tacos down you fucking pie hole before you

332
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:43.260
do a half hours of stand up.
You know,

333
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.870
and you know what's funny about Chipo lays how fucking guilty they are.

334
00:20:45.871 --> 00:20:47.440
I don't know what the fuck happened to them,

335
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.240
but I came walking in there and they had a giant,

336
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.140
I was talking to somebody with the show about this at a giant sign that just

337
00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:57.480
said food with integrity and they show all these natural in all this,

338
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.640
all this beautiful looking food and the food with integrity with the fuck.

339
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.560
Does that even mean?
Yeah.
What did he get busted for something.

340
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.880
It didn't drop a dime on it on it's other food,

341
00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:11.260
friends to fuck food with integrity.

342
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.440
Then it was just a picture of a bunch of food,
healthy food.

343
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.300
I don't recall anything else up there.
And then next to everything up there,

344
00:21:19.301 --> 00:21:23.050
it had how much calories it was tacos three,

345
00:21:23.051 --> 00:21:25.930
anywhere from three 80 to 600 Burrito,

346
00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:29.470
anywhere from fucking this up to fucking a thousand or 1500.

347
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.520
And I was just looking,
I was looking at the menu going like,
dude,

348
00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:38.230
this is like a fucking sex offender that has to announce that he's in the

349
00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:38.801
neighborhood.

350
00:21:38.801 --> 00:21:42.850
The fact that they have to give out this much information about how much

351
00:21:42.851 --> 00:21:45.190
Catholic,
what kind of shit is in this food.

352
00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.010
And then they got that stoop food with integrity.

353
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.710
There was like the food version of a member,

354
00:21:50.711 --> 00:21:54.990
that Obama poster when he was running,
it was all those different colors.

355
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:58.060
He was just sort of looking up and it didn't say anything like what,
what,
what?

356
00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.860
I don't understand what that means.
Um,
it worked out right?
Eight years,

357
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.700
man.
Got eight years.
Um,
so anyways,

358
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:11.300
you know what I did miss as I thought I had my recorder set to uh,

359
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:16.090
record the Bruins for the season this year.
And for some reason,
um,
it's weird.

360
00:22:16.091 --> 00:22:19.180
It's like I went on the road and all of a sudden it stopped working.

361
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:24.250
It's almost as if my wife was recording too many reality shows and when she had

362
00:22:24.251 --> 00:22:26.530
to make a decision,
she shut off the Bruins thing.

363
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:31.710
Now I could never get her to admit that,
you know,
I,

364
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:36.720
but come on,
you know,
she does that shit to me.

365
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.583
I'm telling you.

366
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.040
And you know why I know she does that shit to me cause I do it to her if I'm

367
00:22:41.041 --> 00:22:45.510
taking,
if I'm taping too fucking football games and uh,
like,
you know,

368
00:22:45.511 --> 00:22:49.260
keeping up with the cons is coming up to stop me from tape and things like I'm

369
00:22:49.261 --> 00:22:52.190
shutting that thing off.
I'm shutting it off.

370
00:22:52.191 --> 00:22:56.380
I don't give a fuck right
now.

371
00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.450
Um,
so anyways,

372
00:22:58.451 --> 00:23:01.980
so I thought my fucking recorder was going to record the Bruins stars.

373
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:07.500
You know Tyler Sagan,
Jamie,
Ben,
Jason Spencer,
right.

374
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.470
I that Spencer was at the second line center.

375
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.340
Tyler Sagan has Jamie been on one side.

376
00:23:14.341 --> 00:23:17.850
Jason spits on and others on the other side and the fucking motherfucker comes

377
00:23:17.851 --> 00:23:22.260
back.
It comes back and scores of fucking hat trick against this.

378
00:23:22.261 --> 00:23:25.740
I've even seen a highlight of it yet,
but uh,
I'm happy for him.

379
00:23:25.741 --> 00:23:27.600
I don't know what happened to him with us.

380
00:23:27.601 --> 00:23:32.070
There was a whole bunch or the usual rumors that they tell the fan base,

381
00:23:32.071 --> 00:23:35.280
you know,
whenever,
uh,
whenever they get rid of somebody they always say,

382
00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:38.070
oh he was partying too much.

383
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.540
Oh he banged the owner's daughter,
he fucked one of the other players wives.

384
00:23:42.541 --> 00:23:46.370
It's always the same three fucking,
you know,

385
00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:50.240
the same three fucking rumors.
I don't know what happened.

386
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.590
I have no idea what happened.
But um,
whatever,
you know,

387
00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.000
there was rumors going like,
oh,

388
00:23:56.001 --> 00:24:00.710
we showed up like fucking three games in a row wearing the same clothes,

389
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.430
you know,
cause he's out partying.
And I was just thinking like,
you know,

390
00:24:04.431 --> 00:24:08.450
I think I did that at his age when I wasn't playing for a professional hockey

391
00:24:08.451 --> 00:24:13.100
team.
I think that's part of being 20,
19 and 20.

392
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:15.440
Right.
Um,
so anyways,

393
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.680
so we traded him and like I predicted that was going to be a wake up or my

394
00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:23.180
prediction was he that he's just going to take what they're saying is true.

395
00:24:23.181 --> 00:24:25.940
He is either going to tail spin out and then write a book about being a complete

396
00:24:25.941 --> 00:24:30.260
fucking [inaudible] or he's going to fucking whatever he was doing wrong.

397
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.070
He's going to fucking,
you know,

398
00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:38.660
this can be a swift kicked in his ass and he's going to start fucking,
you know,

399
00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:39.500
buckle and down,

400
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.280
which is what he seemed to do and it just instantly second he got over there,

401
00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:46.700
all of a sudden he's fucking scoring goals.
God dammit.

402
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.530
I said that the other day.
The,
I think the Blackhawks are the only guys,

403
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:56.540
Blackhawks have a bunch of guys that they had to get rid of for salary cap

404
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:57.680
reasons or whatever.
They,

405
00:24:57.681 --> 00:25:01.610
I think they might have the most guys around the league that they got rid of

406
00:25:01.611 --> 00:25:03.140
that are either a,

407
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.880
they're on the first or second line of every fucking team out there.

408
00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:12.170
It seems like it says like a form of black cock on like fucking like seven or

409
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:16.520
eight different teams out there.
Uh,
even the stars,
Patrick Sharp,

410
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:20.610
who was on their first line is now in the second line.
Right.
A daily face off.

411
00:25:20.611 --> 00:25:23.780
Who's been watched?
Who's been looking,
I fucking love daily face off.

412
00:25:23.781 --> 00:25:27.260
Anytime that Bruins have a game and my wife hasn't shut off the fucking
recorder,

413
00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:30.530
I could actually watch it all you do,
you just go to daily face off.

414
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.300
You Click on the fucking team that you play in.

415
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.350
And do they have them all lined up there?
First Line,
Second Holloway does fourth.

416
00:25:36.351 --> 00:25:38.810
All the defense spends,
they got all the jerseys,
all the numbers.

417
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.550
I know I'm geeking out about this shit,

418
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:45.140

419
00:25:45.141 --> 00:25:48.590

All right?
Not stock calm everybody.

426
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:15.080
All right.
This is an important message for all the nut mantras in my audience.

427
00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.120
Why did,

Burr B,
u,
r.
R.

471
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.910
That's nuts.com that's dot com.
All right,

472
00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:55.800
one more boll and branch ball and branch B,
o l l and branch.

473
00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.360
You probably spend more time with your bedsheets than any thing else you own.

474
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:02.700
You really shouldn't skimp on your bedding,
you know,

475
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:07.500
but most people do because great sheets of very expensive thanks to boll and

476
00:29:07.501 --> 00:29:11.580
branch,
that's not the case anymore.
Boll and branch a two brothers.

477
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:15.840
And when you spend the big bucks on sheets with a super high thread count,

478
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.700
you think you're getting the best value.

479
00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:20.940
But what you're really getting is to marketing Mumbo jumbo.

480
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.600
Thread counts have nothing to do with quality and don't get me started on so

481
00:29:26.851 --> 00:29:31.140
called Egyptian cotton.
That's just the name of a plant grown in Pakistan.

482
00:29:31.141 --> 00:29:36.000
In China,
you value your sleep,
but whenever you,
you had to a department store,

483
00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:40.290
you're forced to pay a huge a markup for sheets that aren't even that great.

484
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.990
Jesus Damn fucking blowing the lid off the sheet industry,
aren't they?

485
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.480
Boll and branch sheets are different.
First of all,

486
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:51.130
you can only get them@bollandbranch.com so you know you're paying for quality

487
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:53.050
sheets and not for overhead.

488
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.040
I don't know anything about you yet other than you shitting on every other buddy

489
00:29:57.041 --> 00:30:00.020
that everybody else had makes shakes and see what you're doing.

490
00:30:00.021 --> 00:30:03.500
He hit Boll and branch talking a lot of trash.
Yeah,

491
00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.370
I mean won a game yet and quite frankly,

492
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.670
they're the most comfortable sheets in the world.
Oh,
here we go.
They make,

493
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:14.890
they're made with entirely organic cotton and a night sleeping on boll and

494
00:30:14.891 --> 00:30:17.620
branch sheets.
Make your makes your day so much better.

495
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.760
Which it made my reading better.

496
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:23.890
Three US presidents sleeps on Boll and branch.

497
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:28.150
Well,
Shit.
Who's left?
One of the bushes.

498
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:32.110
Jim Economy Bill Clin.

499
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.510
I bet he does.
If he banged some fucking broad right,
did our soil,

500
00:30:37.511 --> 00:30:41.260
those comfortable seats shakes it off.
Anyways,

501
00:30:41.261 --> 00:30:43.420
three US presently bump boll and branch.

502
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.420
These are people who can afford to sleep on any brands of sheets in the world

503
00:30:46.421 --> 00:30:48.880
and they choose boll and branch.
They really can't afford to.

504
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.730
They don't get paid a lot.
The only made four grand a fucking year,
didn't they?

505
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.320
Oh,
that's right.
Afterwards.

506
00:30:53.321 --> 00:30:56.470
Then they go around giving speeches for $1 million a whack that and they watched

507
00:30:56.471 --> 00:30:59.110
the bribe money.
Then they get the nice sheets.

508
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.580
They even cut out all the middlemen department stores markups,

509
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:07.590
which by the way are up to 800% so you're getting amazingly luxurious seats for

510
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.810
a couple hundred bucks.
Boll and branch is so convenient.
You'll love the sheikhs.

511
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.530

It's yes,</v>

531
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:48.750
for a premium cable,
it's a hit and a lot of people who,
uh,

532
00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:53.070
are into retro porn cause it's mostly about the Harry seventies,

533
00:32:53.071 --> 00:32:57.270
early eighties porn of yesteryear before Twitter.
I've said this a million times,

534
00:32:57.271 --> 00:33:01.470
but before the web and all that kind of stuff,
you know,
old VCR top loading,

535
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.720
you know what I mean?

536
00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:08.490
Just to let the listeners at home data just to,

Well a,

539
00:33:13.921 --> 00:33:17.040
it's kind of the mystery science theater of porn where I bring out comics like

540
00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.270

Bill burr himself will be there and we will be sampling,

542
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:28.770
jumping from clip to clip through Nina Hartley,

543
00:33:28.771 --> 00:33:33.570
one of the greatest living legends of porn.
Nina Hartley Delight.
Super Cool Lady.

544
00:33:33.571 --> 00:33:36.450
And we watch your clips.
Did you have fun watching her stuff?

545
00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.780
<v 3>Yeah,
I was,
I was absolutely a star struck that she showed up.
Yeah.</v>

546
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:45.880
Didn't believe it.
I sat on a couch is me,
Nina and Dave watching,

547
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:50.900
uh,
and literally watching old porn and sitting there commenting on it.
And uh,

548
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:55.780
I thought she was cool as hell.
I was really,
uh,
like definitely,

549
00:33:55.781 --> 00:33:59.050
I don't know how to like just she,
I don't know,
porn stars,

550
00:33:59.051 --> 00:34:02.350
they just don't judge anything when you've just gone through all of that stuff,

551
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:05.040
they'd done,
they just kind of like,
hey,
you know,
whatever.
It,

552
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.840
I freaked out at one point.
You had a,
you had given away.
No,
I'm not just,

553
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:10.270
we'll be posting a little bit of that

554
00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:15.230
<v 2>please.
[inaudible] dot com
what I realized is that like,</v>

555
00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:15.980

556
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.460
first of all watching porn with women is different than watching porn with too.

557
00:34:19.461 --> 00:34:22.100
It's like,
you know,
sausage fest,
Bachelor Party,
you know,

558
00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.440
let's watch a couple of stag films,
get drunk.

559
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.950
Everyone with their legs crossed trying to get hard on your younger.
Right,

560
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:32.870
exactly.
We brought some of the funniest ladies,
two ladies,
uh,

561
00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:36.650
Whitney Cummings,
Chelsea handler,
Margaret Cho,
and uh,

562
00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:39.920
it's cool watching it with a woman because they'd get the woman's perspective on

563
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:43.880
sex and porn and on the whole thing and they like it,
but they don't like it.

564
00:34:43.881 --> 00:34:44.840
Like we like it,
you know.

565
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.540
<v 3>Right.
That actually,
yeah,
that immediately was fascinating to me.
What,</v>

566
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:48.770
what did you find was different?

567
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.220
<v 2>Well,
uh,
they definitely do not like double penetration,
anal tonky punch,</v>

568
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.530
anything that you,
any kind of,
any kind of just,

569
00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.820
you know,
uh,
which were called facials and money shots.

570
00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.590
All that stuff is really not in their bucket list stuff.
Ah,

571
00:35:04.591 --> 00:35:06.170
I hope one day to do this with my

572
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:09.610
<v 3>charmed.
It all depends on,
I think for most women that is like that.</v>

573
00:35:09.611 --> 00:35:13.930
But then every once in a while you'll meet a real thoroughbred and they'll

574
00:35:13.931 --> 00:35:18.150
actually be,
will be relating to it the way you do.
Um,

575
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.930
it's hard to tie it.
Actually,

576
00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.810
I actually saw I was messing around with this girl a long time ago and I want

577
00:35:24.811 --> 00:35:28.060
one watch,
one of those Max hardcores.
Yes.
I love that guy.

578
00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.560
And they were at,
I remember saying to her like,
uh,
yeah,

579
00:35:32.561 --> 00:35:35.260
you're not going to want my point.
I'm watching at this point is really twisted.

580
00:35:35.261 --> 00:35:37.800
You don't want to watch this shit.
And she says like,
now I got put on,

581
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.720
I put it on at,
and she was actually,
uh,
I actually got self conscious.

582
00:35:43.721 --> 00:35:46.730
I shut it off.
And I was like,
I can't watch this with you now.

583
00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:50.080
And then she was just like,
what?
She,
you know,
she,
what did she say?

584
00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:53.020
She said she wanted it is the way she said it,

585
00:35:53.021 --> 00:35:57.580
which was just the classic accused line.
And uh,

586
00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:58.990
I had a lot of fun with that girl diff.

587
00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.290
<v 2>Oh,
good for her.
I really don't,
you know,
I really did.
You're an honest,</v>

588
00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.610
unassuming type.

589
00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.630
So I never even thought you like porn cause I think cause some of it I,

590
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.830
I don't think he really understood what we were doing.

591
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.220
But then I think once you got into it you really like,
you know,
dug in.

592
00:36:12.221 --> 00:36:15.880
And I liked that because at first we were watching this movie that Nina made

593
00:36:15.881 --> 00:36:16.750
with Tracy Adams,

594
00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:20.230
who is another legend of porn called the ultimate lover with Eric headboards and

595
00:36:20.231 --> 00:36:23.880
it's kind of a Frankenstein ask film and we try and jump through the whole film.

596
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.810
It was really difficult,
wasn't it?
To Watch an entire movie.
Yeah.

597
00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:28.570
I mean like you never do that in real life.

598
00:36:28.571 --> 00:36:31.180
Watch a whole porn from beginning to end.
You just go right to the point.
Yeah,

599
00:36:31.181 --> 00:36:33.310
exactly.
Or fast forward or whatever.
You know,

600
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:36.560
the phone rings or your boss walks in,
it's okay.
You know?

601
00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.700
<v 3>Well you know what it was about.
I got this way.
I think it's,</v>

602
00:36:39.701 --> 00:36:44.701
it's the being raised Catholic thing as crass as I am on,

603
00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.820
on this podcast,

604
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.320
all the shit that I say in some of the stuff I talk about on stage,
you know,

605
00:36:51.321 --> 00:36:54.740
I curse a lot,
but I do stay away from sex for some reason.

606
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.690
I can say cunt on stage,
I can do all that type of trash,

607
00:36:59.691 --> 00:37:03.470
women misogynistic stuff if arguably I don't think so.

608
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:07.490
I like to think I have a point,
but uh,
but for some reason when I,

609
00:37:07.491 --> 00:37:09.260
if I talk about sex on stage,

610
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:14.500
I'm always really self conscious and I feel like I'm being crass.
Uh,
I don't,

611
00:37:14.501 --> 00:37:15.231
I don't know why and it,

612
00:37:15.231 --> 00:37:19.190
and I'm not judging someone who talks about sex is just personally I think it

613
00:37:19.191 --> 00:37:20.990
has to do with that,
that,
that sort of upbringing.

614
00:37:20.991 --> 00:37:25.220
So probably the episode I did with you though,
that was the initial,

615
00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.370
you know,
going out,
God,
I'm talking about this,

616
00:37:28.371 --> 00:37:31.890
this is on TV cause I had no idea what the show was.
Um,

617
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.180
I was all how hardcore you were going to do it or the way you guys were going to

618
00:37:35.181 --> 00:37:38.510
edit around stuff,
which I saw a clip,
which is fucking genius by the way.

619
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:42.860
It's really funny.
And um,
we've floated on the couch,

620
00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.270
<v 2>hey bill,
three weeks in.
They know,
I'm sorry.
I'm like Lucas,</v>

621
00:37:47.271 --> 00:37:50.540
I don't want to give away secrets.
George Lucas,

622
00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.160
<v 3>we're working with an actual comedian and a human being and not having me</v>

623
00:37:54.161 --> 00:37:54.994
digitally put it in.

624
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.560
<v 2>Oh yeah,
exactly.
Well let me tell you something.
It rocked out cause we had the,</v>

625
00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:03.930
we had great comics like you and Jim Norton and Adam Carolla and has Norton's

626
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.770
aired yet?
No,
not yet.
But Norton to porn is like,
he's the soccer Julia.

627
00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:13.240
He could find a threeway.
He could find a threeway at a church picnic.

628
00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.960
I mean he is the best.
I mean he really liked gets into it.

629
00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:18.220
We have these great closeups of him,

630
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.700
but I can see for yourself it's a little better.
Analysts on ESPN except for,

631
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.900
and that's why I want to watch,
that's why I was asking when is Jim's like,

632
00:38:25.901 --> 00:38:29.140
I got to,
Jim's is coming out.
He's towards the end of the run,
but right now,

633
00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.360
last week show for those who did watch,

634
00:38:31.361 --> 00:38:33.580
and I think your crowd kinda would dig this,

635
00:38:33.581 --> 00:38:37.040
like the people listening to his podcast,
his pocket,
Dave's old porn,
well known,

636
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.870
uh,
was uh,
the young porn stars,
Bella,
Donna,
Christina Rose,
Bobbi Starr,

637
00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:46.080
watching the old retro Harry Porn.
And you'll never believe this bill.
But,
uh,

638
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:50.300
they found the quaint.
They were like,
look at this.
This is adorable.
The hair,

639
00:38:50.301 --> 00:38:53.270
they didn't really dig,
but they like hair a little bit,
but,
but the sex,

640
00:38:53.271 --> 00:38:55.730
they were like,
look how adorable.
They're cuddling and kissing.

641
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:58.100
They don't do that in today's porn.
It's really like,

642
00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:01.580
like you said it in the show,
I'm not gonna give it away,
but it's like a workout.

643
00:39:01.581 --> 00:39:06.020
It's like,
like a p nine zero x video.
It's like fucking hardcore and extreme.
So,

644
00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.330
<v 3>um,
am I talking too much?
No,
no,
not at all.</v>

645
00:39:08.331 --> 00:39:11.040
But I possible on a podcast to talk too much.
Not at all.
Okay.

646
00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:15.110
But you got to give me credit being 15 minutes in and I've yet to go.
So Dave,

647
00:39:15.111 --> 00:39:19.230
what is the inspiration for your cereal?
Did you always want him?
What,

648
00:39:19.231 --> 00:39:22.250
what were some of the jobs you had before?
I don't think we've said this.

649
00:39:22.251 --> 00:39:26.930
She had Thursday 1130 on showtime.
Dave's old porn,
the new hit show.

650
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:31.940
<v 2>All right,
well it's a hit.
It's doing really well.
It's right after a Gigolos,</v>

651
00:39:31.941 --> 00:39:35.630
which is about a couple of male escorts,
right?
There you go.

652
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:38.090
It's the late night block.

653
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.680
<v 3>And then the Twitter account is at old porn.
And these,
the,
the,</v>

654
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:46.140
the letter o and porn is actually not the letter.
Oh,
it's,
it's the,

655
00:39:46.141 --> 00:39:48.030
it's zero number zero.

656
00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:50.270
<v 2>Cause that's Twitter.
But let me tell you this bill,</v>

657
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.200
if they go to the Dave's all porn.com website,

658
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:56.510
they'll be able to see pictures and clips of upcoming shows.

659
00:39:56.511 --> 00:40:00.500
Your share will be this Thursday and other stuff that we,
uh,
have a shot.
So,

660
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.820
but um,
it,
it's really,
uh,
it's when you say like,
how did I come up with the idea?

661
00:40:04.821 --> 00:40:06.710
It's like I've been working on this idea for like four years.

662
00:40:06.711 --> 00:40:10.330
I think I've told this to you like three or four times.
Drunkenly whatever.
Yes.

663
00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.040
<v 3>Sober this like a year ago.</v>

664
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.140
<v 2>Yeah.
I shot some,
yeah,</v>

665
00:40:14.141 --> 00:40:17.290
we shot this last summer and it took so long to edit cause it's all about

666
00:40:17.291 --> 00:40:20.530
postproduction you saw and uh,
but besides that,

667
00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:22.620
like I've been working on it for years and years and uh,

668
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:25.660
I came up with the idea it was co by a Stuart B.

669
00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:30.160
I don't use his last name cause he is in television,
but Stuart Bailey and uh,

670
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:34.060
he,
uh,
he's helped,
you know,
helped me shape and guide it.

671
00:40:34.061 --> 00:40:36.640
And like a showtime is the best place for it cause you know,

672
00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.800
we're allowed to show everything up to penetration.

673
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:42.790
So everything isn't that crane.
Yeah.
And I thought when I was in,
there's always,

674
00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:45.310
the one guy was like,
where's the penetration?
It's like,
I'm with you dude.

675
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.930
I'm totally went to sky.
It's like,
I feel like I cannot save this man.
You know?

676
00:40:49.931 --> 00:40:52.750
It's like,
I know you got to you.
You're like,
I love porn,
so what time of day,

677
00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.790
<v 3>but what you're doing is you're kind of doing it the way they do movie trailers</v>

678
00:40:55.791 --> 00:40:57.590
right now.
When they show a movie trailer,

679
00:40:57.591 --> 00:41:00.400
they show the entire movie except for the,

680
00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:03.440
the basically the conclusion of the third act.

681
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:07.010
They show you right up until how the hero salts and I think that that's what

682
00:41:07.011 --> 00:41:10.070
you're doing with porn because it gets,
if you actually showed the penetration,

683
00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.230
then there's no point.
You want people to laugh.

684
00:41:12.231 --> 00:41:14.070
You don't want people rubbing one out.
Is there watching?

685
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.070
<v 2>I like a,
I'd like a little of both.
I'd like people to go like,
you know,</v>

686
00:41:17.071 --> 00:41:20.250
that was funny and now I'm hard.
What do I do?
You know,

687
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:23.310
like that kind of a thing and the dog runs out of the room,
you know?

688
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.580
<v 3>Is this how you pitched the show when you came in?</v>

689
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:42.250
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

690
00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.010
<v 3>all right,
what else do we got?
We got dilemmas.
He a day.
Would you like to try it?</v>

691
00:42:01.011 --> 00:42:05.460
Dilemma.
Let's write a dilemma,
a dilemma.
Let's see if we can ancient align metal,

692
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.380
like have a,
you know,
a man stands on one foot and now this,
this is more just,

693
00:42:09.381 --> 00:42:13.730
this is sophomore.
Okay.
Hey,
you fucking horse pill.
You don't even,
uh,

694
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.430
is this the first time you're seeing this stuff?
Oh yeah.
I don't spray shit.

695
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:19.820
I don't read.
I just totally wing it.
All right.
Uh,
let me,

696
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.200
it was a really brutal one here.
All right.
All right.
We'll give this to you.
Dave.

697
00:42:24.201 --> 00:42:29.180
Would you rather eat a tablespoon of Kim Kardashians shit or suck and entire

698
00:42:29.181 --> 00:42:33.770
fart directly out of Rosie O'donnell,
sucking directly on her,
uh,

699
00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:38.570
obese balloon?
Not.
Wow.
You know,
it's such when you want to do both.

700
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.880
Well,
I don't know.
I would say that I would go.
Hm.
I Dunno.

701
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.450
That's a definitely coin toss if he asks me.
Cause I mean,

702
00:42:50.451 --> 00:42:52.850
if anybody's shit's going to taste good,
you got to think,
I mean,

703
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:56.390
she's so printed proper.
You know what I mean?
I think she,

704
00:42:56.410 --> 00:43:00.130
she gets some sort of ass pedicure,
I would think.
Like,
okay.
Yeah.

705
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.070
Once a week or something.
We hold is insured by something in way to London,

706
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.070
but ah,

707
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:08.520
<v 2>no,
she's super hot.
So everybody would go with her.
But you know what,</v>

708
00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:10.890
I'm going to take her to the other direction.
Go with the rosy,

709
00:43:10.891 --> 00:43:13.200
whatever the hell you said.
Oh look at that left turn.

710
00:43:13.201 --> 00:43:17.160
And I'll even take it a step further because to show you how much I really have

711
00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:18.030
no self esteem,

712
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:22.650
I would eat Susan Boyle's box if it granted wishes.

713
00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.120
And even everybody goes,

714
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.940
what if one of the wishes was you never remember eating or box.
It's like,

715
00:43:26.941 --> 00:43:31.290
I don't even give a shit.
I'm sure it's as sweet as her beautiful voice

716
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.210
<v 3>bill.
Bill,
in your hypothetical world noises,</v>

717
00:43:35.211 --> 00:43:38.660
she would make hot wash the noises she would make.
Can you imagine?

718
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:43.610
I think she would pass up the sweet.
That'd be great to get there on of those,

719
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.710
those uh,
children's novel,
pasty thighs,
it's really like,

720
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.220
she has like fairy tale legs,
I would think.
You know what I mean?

721
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:56.760
<v 2>Cheers.
Angel forts.
She's the,
she just queefs Angel Freres</v>

722
00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:01.580
<v 3>I gotta tell you,
I think I would go,
I would go with Rosie O'donnell.</v>

723
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:05.420
I would do that.
At the end of the day,
it's air.
It's just,

724
00:44:05.421 --> 00:44:09.200
it just doesn't seem as bad.
I'm going to go,
I'm going to get so hot though.

725
00:44:09.201 --> 00:44:12.830
I'm going to get science.
Yeah,
but you're not really experiencing her.

726
00:44:12.831 --> 00:44:16.550
She just gonna Shit on a plate.
Like basically how you got to see her do it.

727
00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:19.840
She doesn't like,
like an assistant brings that ain't right.
You get serious.

728
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:24.330
She's very busy.
She's,
she's out.
But she's,
she's done.
She's dodging the,
uh,

729
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:28.310
everyone who was outraged that her sham of a marriage was a sham of a marriage.

730
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.130
But you know,
I don't understand brill.
Who felt,

731
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.080
who felt they got fucked in that one.
Who Do you feel bad for?

732
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:38.580
The poor people at People magazine that have $1 million to pay for those dumb

733
00:44:38.581 --> 00:44:39.370
photos.

734
00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:44.260
<v 2>I honestly could not give a shit about any of that bullshit or whatever,</v>

735
00:44:44.261 --> 00:44:45.640
but I'm just going to say this right now.

736
00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:51.090
Don't you think just from just living in America of like pumping gas and like,

737
00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.790
uh,
you know,
using the cash machine that like you've,

738
00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:59.530
you've liked somehow over,
over your entire life,

739
00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:04.740
just the contact of like people of other people touching shit that you've eaten

740
00:45:04.931 --> 00:45:08.110
a shit.
Oh absolutely.
Yeah.
I think that like if you add collectively,

741
00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.430
collectively it's like a probably like a nice big turn.

742
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:14.860
I mean you get your stomach pumped when he went to heaven.

743
00:45:14.861 --> 00:45:18.070
Like they show you like this is how much shit you've actually eating.
You know,

744
00:45:18.071 --> 00:45:19.170
like cock gives you a hotel.

745
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:22.610
Like how much change you've given to homeless people I guess at the chart here,

746
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.560
<v 3>you know,
I had somebody in,
in Saint Louis did that,
you know,</v>

747
00:45:25.561 --> 00:45:27.680
you shake hands afterwards and you always have like that,
that,

748
00:45:27.681 --> 00:45:29.220
that the hand sanitizer afterwards.

749
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:33.810
And I actually had an audience member denied a shake my hand,
he goes,
he goes,

750
00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:36.990
I'm not to cause of everything.
And I was just like,
yeah,
you know,

751
00:45:36.991 --> 00:45:38.160
that's actually that.
Totally.

752
00:45:38.161 --> 00:45:40.590
I totally understand why you wouldn't want to at this point.

753
00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:43.980
And that always makes sure I,
I,
if I'm going to scratch my face,

754
00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:47.970
it's always with my left hand.
Like I totally get why,
you know,

755
00:45:47.971 --> 00:45:51.510
why we Mandela is probably the most famous for it doesn't want to shake hands.

756
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:53.190
And if you,
and people thought it was weird,

757
00:45:53.191 --> 00:45:57.240
but if you're really honest with yourself and you think about the last 24 hours,

758
00:45:57.241 --> 00:46:01.110
some of the things that you've done to yourself and you may be,
we're in a hurry.

759
00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.240
He didn't quite clean up,
you know,

760
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.420
<v 2>but think about it this way.</v>

761
00:46:04.421 --> 00:46:08.260
I've been to third world and like they can all have to real about it.
Yeah.

762
00:46:08.261 --> 00:46:10.660
And they can only dream of like a,
you know,

763
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:14.400
like wet wipes and pure hell and shit like that.
I mean,
you know,
they're,

764
00:46:14.401 --> 00:46:17.530
they're filthy all the time and they love it and they always have big smile,

765
00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:18.910
you know,
like,
Hey,
what's up?

766
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:20.750
<v 3>Don't they like shit on the side of the road.</v>

767
00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:25.820
Sometimes my squat and the one fountain that's in their country because some of

768
00:46:25.821 --> 00:46:29.750
that,
yeah,
I've actually seen that they have like the people's bud day,

769
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:32.460
<v 2>the people's good day.
Is that a new show?</v>

770
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:38.340
That sounds like a new show on a new network.
We do it differently here at home.

771
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.320
<v 3>All right,
advice bill and Dave will add that I need your help.</v>

772
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:15.060
I dated this chick and a and I feel for,
I think I love her.

773
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:19.470
What's wrong was that I feel for you.
I think I love you.

774
00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:21.430
<v 2>I don't know Bobby Darin.</v>

775
00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:25.480
<v 3>No,
no.
Come on man.
It was 80s.
I'm going to keep singing so you know it,
uh,</v>

776
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:27.940
feel free to say about any song white snake.

777
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:32.590
I think I love what fucking jaws going to kill me all day.

778
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.690
All right.
Uh,
well anyways,

779
00:47:34.691 --> 00:47:39.550
he said what split us apart is that she didn't like porn and I promised her I

780
00:47:39.551 --> 00:47:40.850
wouldn't watch it.
Uh,

781
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:45.310
she had self esteem problems and like an idiot,

782
00:47:45.311 --> 00:47:48.400
I broke it.
I guess he broke her self esteem.
I was just kind of a dick.

783
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.510
I tried fixing it and for a while things went back to how they were,

784
00:47:52.511 --> 00:47:54.850
but she wanted a,
she wanted a break.
I agreed,

785
00:47:54.851 --> 00:47:56.740
but later she started to like another guy.

786
00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:59.020
I didn't like that and tried to get back with her.

787
00:47:59.021 --> 00:48:00.820
We had sex and things were going great.

788
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:04.900
I thought everything would go back to the same,
but Lee it later,
she said,

789
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.340
we can't have sex.

790
00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:11.820
After I felt depressed because I knew she didn't like me anymore and she started

791
00:48:12.221 --> 00:48:15.460
liking this other guy.
When I was depressed,
I didn't talk to her much.

792
00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:18.430
It lasted for three days.
This gift must be young.

793
00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:23.140
It lasted for three days and during that time she started dating the guy,

794
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:28.150
brutal spelling errors.
So forgive my already bad reading out loud skills here.

795
00:48:28.151 --> 00:48:29.770
This is almost,
we're about halfway through here.

796
00:48:29.771 --> 00:48:31.770
If you want to start lighting a cigarette.
Uh,

797
00:48:31.771 --> 00:48:35.980
I asked her why she went off and dated a guy she doesn't know.
She said,

798
00:48:35.981 --> 00:48:39.980
because I was detaching myself.
I want to get over.
I want to get over,

799
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:40.990
but I'm having trouble.

800
00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:45.740
Only time I am happiest when I listened to standup comedy and your podcasts.
Uh,

801
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.950
no.
He goes,
am smooching your ass there?
Um,

802
00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:54.430
I feel bad for breaking her heart and because I feel like she didn't love me.

803
00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:58.870
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
This guy's,
he make it sense.
I was always there for her.

804
00:48:58.871 --> 00:49:03.250
She had many problems when she was alone.
A stuck up for,
she got me.
I know.

805
00:49:03.251 --> 00:49:05.050
I know.
I screwed up.

806
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:10.900
<v 2>Oh,
this is like a sad note and what I can honestly see.
All right.</v>

807
00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:16.310
<v 3>Anyways,
he's basically asking how can I get over her and move on?</v>

808
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:20.510
Well,
what do you say,
Dave?
What is what I say your formulas,

809
00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:25.150
<v 2>porn will help you,
um,
in the immediate thing.
But uh,</v>

810
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.940
in the long run,
yeah.
You gotta you gotta just a,

811
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:32.030
there's a whatever you've got to get out there.
I mean,
this kid,

812
00:49:32.031 --> 00:49:35.180
he's still trying to,
I'm trying to like get this chick,

813
00:49:35.181 --> 00:49:38.810
but she's already moved on because we all know one thing guys got porn,

814
00:49:38.811 --> 00:49:41.750
but women can fuck any guy they want.
I mean,
honestly,

815
00:49:41.751 --> 00:49:44.120
I mean like if you don't treat a woman right,

816
00:49:44.121 --> 00:49:47.120
she will go out and like fuck your twin brother just to show you that.

817
00:49:47.121 --> 00:49:49.880
Like you gotta,
you know,
whatever.
They're vicious.

818
00:49:49.881 --> 00:49:54.370
They are be vicious or they can be amazingly cool.
So either way,
he,
uh,

819
00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:58.820
you know,
he should just say like,
you know,
what,
chalk this one up for experience,

820
00:49:58.821 --> 00:50:03.470
move on next chapter in my life and uh,
use the porn and the booze sparingly,

821
00:50:03.471 --> 00:50:06.770
but keep it in the back pocket.
And there are chicks that like porn.

822
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.820
So maybe the next one won't have such a big problem about it,
but this girl,

823
00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.800
it's called the dead end.
Move forward.

824
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:17.620
<v 3>I have a,
I have,
one of my theories is when you break up with,
uh,
with,
uh,</v>

825
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:21.540
someone is you get the fuck away from them.
Good idea if you can.
Yeah.

826
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:26.170
Because women got that.
They're just fucking geniuses.

827
00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:28.310
They own it to just knowing,

828
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.760
<v 2>right.
Where they could just sense like,
wait a minute,
he's getting over me,</v>

829
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:35.600
and then they'll fucking call you up and just spin your shit around and then

830
00:50:35.601 --> 00:50:37.550
just hang up and bi mission accomplished.

831
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.070
And they just do that until they're over you.

832
00:50:40.071 --> 00:50:44.540
And then they just leave you in a puddle in the corner.
So my thing is you just,

833
00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:47.810
you just fucking,
you break it off and that's it.
Exactly.
You're right.

834
00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:49.910
Maybe this kid,
he,
uh,
works with this,

835
00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:52.400
this chick where she lives in the room or something like that.
But you're right.

836
00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:56.330
He's got to clear the decks,
move forward,
new experiences.

837
00:50:56.750 --> 00:51:00.200
Like it's scary,
but you've got to just get out there and do shit,

838
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:03.710
but the poor and we'll help you honestly,
and it's corroding,
shopping,
such a,

839
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:06.770
such a press about the porn thing and uh,
you know,

840
00:51:06.771 --> 00:51:08.400
it's amazing how she got over here at some point.

841
00:51:08.401 --> 00:51:11.120
You're not going to marry this girl.
He can't watch.
Exactly.
Yeah.

842
00:51:11.121 --> 00:51:14.690
Watch porn with that.
This isn't your wife emotionally dead as an old man here.

843
00:51:14.691 --> 00:51:18.600
And let me tell you,
what did you look back and laugh at this?

844
00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:26.610
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

845
00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.073
<v 2>let's get into</v>

846
00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:02.600
<v 0>some of the listener feedback for the week.
I got something from,
uh,
from,</v>

847
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:08.000
from uh,
Germany.
It said,
hi billion.
I'm a,

848
00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:12.230
a black Tunisian born and born and raised in Germany.

849
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:18.020
So I guess he's from Tunisia,
which I don't know where that is.
If I had to guess,

850
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:23.290
I would say Tunisia is right next to,

851
00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:29.150
uh,
uh,
let's see.
We're not in Vietnam

852
00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:35.270
and he was just laughing at me.
Um,
what the fuck,

853
00:52:35.271 --> 00:52:37.100
what was that place when we were in Vietnam?

854
00:52:37.101 --> 00:52:39.620
We weren't supposed to be in the other country next to it.

855
00:52:39.621 --> 00:52:43.870
Like Laos or something.
Jesus.

856
00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:49.700
Yeah.
Oh,
that cab driver.
What a Douche.
What did those right think the Maca.

857
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:53.810
Just so still with the geography.
Really.

858
00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:58.760
You fucking Goddamn scientists driving a god damn cab.
Yeah.

859
00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:01.280
Fuck him motherfucker.
Um,
so anyways,

860
00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:05.870
after listening to your incredibly rule to t regarding last week's listener from

861
00:53:05.871 --> 00:53:06.704
Hong Kong,

862
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:11.960
I decided to finally write you and show you that it ain't no thang for non

863
00:53:11.961 --> 00:53:15.080
native speakers to talk the talk.
See,

864
00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.070
I kind of went African American jive slang on that sentence.

865
00:53:19.770 --> 00:53:23.180
Oh Jesus.
He goes,
it ain't no thang.

866
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:28.300
Maybe maybe he's trying to be funny or maybe he just saw an episode of a Sanford

867
00:53:29.431 --> 00:53:34.400
and son.
I Dunno.
English is not that difficult to language to master.

868
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:36.050
Why are they such arrogant?

869
00:53:36.051 --> 00:53:40.280
Because English is so simple to master your magic and just so stupid.

870
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:42.680
First of all,
you fucking moron.

871
00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:47.830
If Germany was running shit like you'll want it to like your trash and me

872
00:53:48.321 --> 00:53:53.000
yelling this shit here like you tried to for the last for two fucking world

873
00:53:53.001 --> 00:53:57.140
wars.
Do you think I wouldn't have a problem master in Germany?
You fucking cunt.

874
00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:01.220
All you fucking cunt over there who think you're so God damn brilliant because

875
00:54:01.221 --> 00:54:03.560
you can speak English.
The reason why you're running,

876
00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:07.790
you're speaking fucking English is because for a while there America was running

877
00:54:07.791 --> 00:54:12.020
shit.
All right.
That's why you speak it.

878
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:17.090
Not because you fucking smarter.
You dumb cunts.
You just fucking stupid as I am.

879
00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:21.020
I been over here.
I've seen,
yeah,
I watched your riding your bikes.

880
00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.630
I see you're breathing with your mouths open.

881
00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:27.650
Stop acting like just so fucking brilliant.
I'm not saying I'm better than you,

882
00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:32.690
but you have this same cunt that I am.
Okay.
You just in a different situation,

883
00:54:32.691 --> 00:54:36.920
go fuck yourself.
That's like if some white kid is born in Harlem,
right?

884
00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.790
All of a sudden he knows how to dance and can pop luck because he's hanging out

885
00:54:40.791 --> 00:54:42.670
with fucking African Americans.

886
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.590
Does that make any sense?
Well,
it does.
In my world.
Go Fuck Yourself.

887
00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:53.180
I have had it with you fucking people from other countries talking down to me

888
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:56.540
like you're not just as dumb as I am.
All right.

889
00:54:56.990 --> 00:55:00.290
I am on a whirlwind tour of fucking Europe right now.

890
00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:03.230
I am traveling as an American and I got to tell you,

891
00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:05.120
the architecture was brilliant,

892
00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:08.450
but I gotta tell you I'm not exactly blown away by the intellect.

893
00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:10.700
I'm not talking to people going,
wow,

894
00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:14.570
this guy understands and can explain black holes.

895
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.840
You guys are doing the same shit that we're doing.
You're downloading music,

896
00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:23.590
you're trying to get laid.
You want a sandwich when you're hungry,

897
00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:28.810
go fuck yourself.
So anyway,
so he then goes on to say

898
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.660
English is just not that difficult a language to master a hell.

899
00:55:34.661 --> 00:55:39.070
Everything else here in Germany is a cheap knock off of American lifestyle,

900
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.250
entertainment,
fashion,
music,
et cetera.
Uh,

901
00:55:42.251 --> 00:55:46.930
you think we wouldn't somehow learned to talk American English?
Um,

902
00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:49.690
oil,
excuse me for giving you a fucking compliment.

903
00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:51.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

904
00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:56.490
<v 0>You've Tunisian born Germany cunt.
All right.
From the Ukraine.</v>

905
00:55:57.060 --> 00:56:00.240
Hi Bill.
I just really want to let you know that how late,
you know,

906
00:56:00.241 --> 00:56:01.470
how famous you are.

907
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:05.340
I'm living in a fucking Ukraine,

908
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:10.410
not even a capitol of Ukraine in a very small town,
more like a village.

909
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:13.890
And I'm listening to your podcast every Monday.
How cool is the Internet?

910
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:16.860
There's some guy in the Ukraine,

911
00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:20.280
yet another place that I don't really quite know where it is once you get into

912
00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:24.510
eastern Europe,
because when I was growing that was all fucking Russia.

913
00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:29.190
Why isn't it once you got beyond Poland and Germany,
shit,

914
00:56:29.191 --> 00:56:32.550
once you got to fucking East Germany,
it wasn't that Russia Ukraine.

915
00:56:32.551 --> 00:56:37.110
Is that near Romania or is that a lettuce?
I'm sorry,

916
00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:41.700
that was just a silly salad joke.
Um,
I'm living in the fucking Ukraine.

917
00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:45.300
Um,
and I'm listening to your podcast every Monday.
Also,

918
00:56:45.301 --> 00:56:47.520
I heard all of your podcasts since you started.

919
00:56:47.521 --> 00:56:51.690
I was born here and never live in an English speaking country.

920
00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:55.350
I learned a little bit of English in school and pick up the restaurant,

921
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:59.850
your TV shows.
See,
I gotta admit that fucking blows me away.

922
00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:01.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

923
00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:04.380
<v 0>You just sit there and watch a TV show and you can pick up English.</v>

924
00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:05.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

925
00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:10.890
<v 0>I want to talk to you like what of what English do you just like walk around</v>

926
00:57:11.951 --> 00:57:13.660
going,
hey,
hey,
hey,

927
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:18.100
up your noses with rubber hoses.
Oh,

928
00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:22.860
Mr cat that does that.
What you do,
do you do just speak like American,

929
00:57:22.861 --> 00:57:23.694
uh,

930
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:28.770
television characters whose given hill?
This is one of these things up.

931
00:57:28.771 --> 00:57:31.840
Jealous of these people's abilities to pick up languages because I want to be

932
00:57:31.841 --> 00:57:35.860
bilingual,
but I,
I don't,
I,
you know what it is.
I don't have to be,

933
00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:39.930
you know what it's like,
it's like climbing up a rope.

934
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.360
Doesn't everybody want to be able to do that?

935
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:45.390
Just grab a rope and without using your fucking legs,

936
00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:50.900
just go right up at like a James Bond who doesn't want to be able to do that.

937
00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.810
But the thing is is to get through life.
You don't have to be able to do that.

938
00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.610
So most people never,
never pick up.
That sort of strength.

939
00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:02.730
Language is the same thing.
If I don't have to learn how to speak it,

940
00:58:02.731 --> 00:58:06.720
I mean to sit there and actually just sit down and give yourself a fucking

941
00:58:06.721 --> 00:58:11.220
homework assignment.
I don't know.
I'm failing miserably and my Spanish

942
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:17.510
and uh,
oh,
go fuck yourself.
You know what you got?

943
00:58:17.511 --> 00:58:20.120
You know what you guys,
when this is like a game,

944
00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:23.220
your special teams are better than ours in the lane.

945
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:24.103
<v 1>Which department?</v>

946
00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:32.360
[inaudible].
