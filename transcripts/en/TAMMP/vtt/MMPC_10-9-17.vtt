1
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.140
Hey,
what's going on?
Yay.

2
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:08.430
Baby is due Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.870
Um,
for October eight,
2017.
What's going on?

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.730
Yes,
I'm singing a little bit of Tom Petty.
Um,

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.850
I was lucky enough to be at the Florida gators game in the swamp against the Lsu

6
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:24.160
tigers and a bear bear bear.
Bye Bye.

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.110
Fucking SCC football.
80,000 people,

8
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.390
whatever the fuck it is going.
Absolutely ape shit.
And uh,

9
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:36.360
they had this great tribute,
which I'm sure somebody saw the clips,
uh,

10
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.040
online of a,
the whole stadium saying,
I won't back down.

11
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.290
It was fucking on,
you know,
it sucks the guy died,

12
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.303
<v 0>you know,</v>

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.370
<v 1>but he leaves all that great music and all of that.
What I want to,
yeah,</v>

14
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:52.470
it's a great fucking,
that's a great life.
You know what I mean?

15
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.220
Considering all this shit that fucking happens nowadays,

16
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.040
the fact that that guy was able to make it into his sixties,

17
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.360
the very least still sucks.
He died,
you know?
But whatever,
it was a great,
it was,

18
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.390
it was fucking awesome.
You know what's hilarious is if you were there,

19
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:08.670
everybody sang the shit out of that first.
First.

20
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.810
And then when the second verse came along,
you,

21
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.250
you saw the radio fans and then the real Tom petty fence.
Right?

22
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.430
Now everybody knew the first birds.
Xylella well back,

23
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.160
Damn Noah Stam I don't have the worst day,
my grant.

24
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:24.990
And then all of a sudden the fucking everybody knew

25
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.780
<v 2>or is it Yay.</v>

26
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.870
<v 1>Right?
And then it gets to the second verse,
listen to it.</v>

27
00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:33.620
Everybody's just kind of,
well,
ah,
how's that been

28
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.120
<v 2>for that?
Hey,
there ain't no</v>

29
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.690
<v 1>easy way out.
Right?
So,
um,
anyways,</v>

30
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:47.310
we went to the swamp out there in,
uh,
in,
uh,
Gainesville,

31
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:50.150
Georgia,
where a Tom Petty is from.
Evidently,
I didn't know,

32
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.340
I didn't know that until he died.
And,
uh,
I knew he was from Florida.
Um,

33
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.370
yet another great musician from Florida,
right?

34
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.100
You get all the fucking Allman brothers from down there.
He got Tom Petty,

35
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.810
I don't know where the heartbreakers or front,
but you know,
I mean,
he met him,

36
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:05.290
so they had to be somewhere near Florida,
right?

37
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.310
Somewhere in that fucking lower 48.
But,
um,
Jesus Christ did,
uh,

38
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.650
did that stadium,
Ben Hill Fucking Stadium,

39
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.180
the Aka the swamp.
Did that thing ever live up to its fucking name?

40
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.650
My God.

41
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.300
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

42
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.030
<v 1>we had upper deck seats and um,</v>

43
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.050
it was a,

44
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.830
<v 0>okay.</v>

45
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.060
<v 1>It was,
uh,
it was just fucking,
it was ridiculous.</v>

46
00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:33.300
So we go up there and they had like the aluminum seats up top,

47
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:35.250
just like the old Patriot's stadium,
you know?

48
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.980
And if you stood up during the wintertime when everybody had the big winter

49
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:38.431
coats on,

50
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:41.790
if you stood up too long after a good play or most likely disappointing play

51
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:45.590
back then when you went to sit back down,
you lost your seat and then you,

52
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.800
it was just sort of standing up.

53
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:49.630
You couldn't sit down and then people would pelt you with hot dogs and fucking

54
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.140
snowballs and all that shit.
And you know what you did,

55
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.390
you laughed and all your friends laughed at you.
You didn't make a fucking,

56
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.190
you didn't have a cell phone and make a video and turn yourself into a victim,

57
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.130
you know.
So,
um,

58
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.470
anyways,
um,

59
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.760
we were sitting up there and you literally had to just walk back into the
tunnel.

60
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.480
And with all that heat coming off the field and all those people,

61
00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:18.990
they're like literally where you walked into the stadium became like a wind

62
00:03:18.991 --> 00:03:23.430
tunnel.
So,
and I was going out there,
man,

63
00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:24.480
and I'm gonna tell you right now,

64
00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:29.010
there was a bunch of people just fucking sitting down all shapes and sizes,

65
00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:33.720
all ages from kids all the way to old people just sitting down like,
yell,

66
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.240
I got to take a good fucking 10 minute break here,

67
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.590
or I think I'm going to fucking die.
And then mercifully,
the sun started to go,

68
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.760
by the way,
it's October,
it's October,
felt like fucking August.

69
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.260
And,
um,
the sun finally went down and a,

70
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:52.530
it was a great game.
I know,
you know,
the gators were missing there,

71
00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:55.500
a starting quarterback.
And I also know,

72
00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:59.790
obviously Lsu had that horrible fucking loss last week to the Trojans,
Troy.

73
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.230
And um,
so it was a big win for them.
It was just a fucking,
it was a great game.

74
00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:07.380
Unfortunately,
the kid missed that field goal.
Everyone's Shannon's name,
Eddie,

75
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.120
Eddie.
You know,
I don't know what happened to fucking kid.
Missed the extra point,

76
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.360
which kind of sucked because I would love to see an overtime.
But,
uh,

77
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.190
there was this one Lsu Fan,
this old guy just,
he was fucking hilarious.

78
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.530
Even like glade gator fans.
This is annoying as he was,

79
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.750
he was just this old guy and he would do these stupid dance's whenever Lsu had

80
00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:30.330
like a big play.
He looked ridiculous.

81
00:04:30.331 --> 00:04:34.050
It was making a complete ass of himself all the while having the best time of

82
00:04:34.051 --> 00:04:38.820
his life.
And uh,
and everybody,

83
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.391
it was just,

84
00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:42.270
it's one of those just one of those great fucking moments why you go to sports

85
00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:47.100
and all that shit.
And uh,
you know,
we had a great time.

86
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:50.850
We didn't pay for fucking parking either and then we found out why afterwards

87
00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:55.620
because we were so buried in.
Um,
but,
uh,

88
00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:58.650
it was just awesome to finally go.
They're legendary school,

89
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.120
legendary fucking field.

90
00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:05.121
And I actually learned this about that field is that that field is what is in

91
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:09.600
like the top 20 biggest stadiums in the United States.
Um,

92
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.760
here they are right here.
Michigan number one,
number two,

93
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:19.590
Penn state than Ohio state,
Texas a and M,
Tennessee.
Uh,

94
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.850
Lsu,
Alabama,
University of Texas,

95
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.820
USC,
Georgia as the top 10.

96
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.840
Then Ucla,
the cotton bold Nebraska,

97
00:05:30.841 --> 00:05:35.550
Florida comes in at number 14,
and I was pretty psyched as far as the top 10.

98
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.640
I've been to every fucking one of those stadiums except for Penn state.

99
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.320
And uh,
let's see,
other one,
Michigan,

100
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:45.930
Texas and Tennessee.
I haven't been in Tennessee,

101
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.380
so I got to fucking knock those out.
All right,
I've got to try to do that shit.

102
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.170
I know it's fucking stupid shit.
But this is what this podcast is.

103
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:55.320
His podcast is stupid shit.
All right,

104
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.330
stupid shit that doesn't matter.
And then listen to me,

105
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.950
you know,
all these fucking assholes.
You know,

106
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.790
I've been getting letters lately of really heavy variety and it's,

107
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.380
I don't fucking do that on here.

108
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.890
You're the listening to the wrong fucking podcast is enough of that out there.

109
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.380
This place is to forget you fucking troubles

110
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.210
fuckin ass or some Douche bags sent me this fucking email.

111
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.460
The name of the email was fuck America.

112
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.680
And then he goes on to present his argument about gun control.
It's like,
buddy,

113
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.520
you started it off with fuck America.
Like,
well,
how would you,

114
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:35.660
how is the people that you want to listen to this going to listen to it after

115
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:39.440
that?
So I won't be reading that one.
You know what I mean?

116
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.920
At least fucking people screaming and fucking yelling about this,
about that.

117
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.450
You know what I mean?
Every time there's a big fucking tragedy,

118
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.260
you know what I love now?
I love how everybody's got a fucking way in now,
right?

119
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.360
And then like,
it becomes,

120
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.830
my favorite things is celebrities react to the hurricane.

121
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.860
You know what I mean?
Like,
oh good.

122
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:04.950
I need to know what j Lo thinks about a category five.
Oh,
was she,

123
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.810
was she upset that that happened to Houston?
Who wouldn't be?

124
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.970
Who the fuck wouldn't be?
I don't fucking idol.

125
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.790
I just don't understand why they do that.
I've never fucking understood.

126
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.820
There'll be like a fucking earthquake.
And then it's always like Hashtag,
uh,

127
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.770
fucking,
uh,
thinking about,
you know,
wherever the fuck earthquake hit.

128
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.070
And you know what's funny about those fucking accounts?
Most of those,

129
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.240
like if you're smart,
I guess you don't,
you don't do your own account.

130
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.050
You have somebody else do it.
So whenever anything bad happens,

131
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.200
they actually had somebody else doing it for the person so they don't get in

132
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:48.650
trouble.
They don't say the wrong fucking thing.
I just,

133
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.240
everything is just become that.
I missed that whole story about Cam Newton.

134
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.540
He said some smart adequately thing to a fucking female reporter.

135
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.480
Right.
And rather than her just settling with them,
being like,

136
00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:06.040
hey cam,
why don't you go fuck yourself?

137
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.550
And then they laugh it off and they both drink a bud light or something.

138
00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:12.460
A Miller lite like they used to,
how it used to go down.

139
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.670
All of a sudden now he showed ups to the game today for some reason dressed like

140
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:23.720
a pimp,
like a,
I dunno what.
And then he's got like a fucking Rosie the riveter.

141
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.810
I can think of that.
He's going to say all these positive shit about women.

142
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.400
I don't care.
I just,
I don't fucking,
I don't under,
like,

143
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.280
it's just one fucking apology after another.

144
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.501
Meanwhile,

145
00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:44.640
the world is going to hell in a fucking hand basket and I got to fucking sit

146
00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:49.560
here and,
and I'm going to watch that.
I need to see the resolution of that.

147
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.160
Like these two fucking adults cannot solve this

148
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.470
amongst,
I swear to God,

149
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:01.170
I was half listening to Cam Newton.
I,
I swear to God,

150
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:04.500
he was talking to Rosie the riveter as if it was a real person.

151
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.570
Am I out of my mind or that wasn't that like a,

152
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.570
a like a caricature that represented women working in World War II?

153
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.180
Was it really a woman named Rosie and her middle name was the,

154
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:23.010
and the last name was reverter.
Um,
I might be wrong,
you know,

155
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:24.991
by all means.

156
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:28.200
Let me look this up before I have to have a press conference and fucking

157
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:32.370
apologize to somebody.
Here we go.
Wow.
Uh,
a row

158
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.680
<v 4>Z</v>

159
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.720
<v 1>riveter.
Rosie the riveter.</v>

160
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:43.190
All right.
Rosie the river as a cultural icon.
Yes.
I swear to God,

161
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:47.750
he was fucking talking like it was
my Paula.
Maybe he wasn't.

162
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.240
That would be fucking hilarious.
And then lastly,

163
00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:54.470
I'd like to apologize to Rosie the riveter.
I know she did a lot of eggs.

164
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.880
She Rev or did a lot of rivets back down there by the river.

165
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.700
And uh,
I apologize.

166
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.083
<v 3>MMM,</v>

167
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.530
<v 1>here's something I wish people in the press could do.</v>

168
00:10:06.531 --> 00:10:08.570
I wish they could get their balls broken a little bit more,

169
00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:10.700
especially if you've got,
if you kind of go in the locker room,

170
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.670
you know what I mean?
If you're going to fucking go in there,

171
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.300
people are going to bust your chops like the athletes.

172
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.790
Like they should be able to sit there and be like,

173
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.900
what did you say you bald fat fuck who couldn't run 30 yards without having a

174
00:10:23.901 --> 00:10:27.890
heart attack?
What was your question about my,
my decision in the second quarter?

175
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.390
Why can't they do that?

176
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:31.890
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

177
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.510
<v 1>I don't understand why they can't do that.</v>

178
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:34.860
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

179
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.250
<v 1>What'd you say lady?
Um,</v>

180
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.250
you addressed me as Ms Sports reporter.

181
00:10:43.251 --> 00:10:45.260
I'll go fucking fuck yourself.

182
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.540
That's stupid ass story.
It has,

183
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:54.810
we'll get more fucking coverage then pharmaceutical companies basically being

184
00:10:54.931 --> 00:10:55.890
heroin dealers.

185
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.170
<v 3>Okay.</v>

186
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.003
<v 1>You know what I mean?</v>

187
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.430
They're not gonna fuck with that because they advertise on that channel,

188
00:11:01.431 --> 00:11:06.431
but God forbid somebody throws one high and tight at somebody with a fucking

189
00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:10.460
clam and all of a sudden all Jesus,
the whole fucking world stops.

190
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.480
I'm not saying he shouldn't apologize.
They should fucking handle it this thick.

191
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.140
He didn't say it to me.
The fuck am I sitting there watching it for,

192
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.313
<v 3>I dunno.</v>

193
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.920
<v 1>He lost like advertising money.
I mean,</v>

194
00:11:26.921 --> 00:11:28.800
who can even fucking remember like what?

195
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:30.860
What did you know you only one thing I can ever remember.

196
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.160
This is some of the greatest advertising I guess because I can remember was

197
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:35.990
Shaquille O'Neal did it,

198
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:41.020
did a bunch of Buick ads and that was the funniest fucking thing ever because in

199
00:11:41.151 --> 00:11:42.950
a lot of people,
instantly when they saw that,

200
00:11:42.951 --> 00:11:45.020
it's like Shaq doesn't drive a fucking Buick.

201
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.230
It's one of the top 50 NBA players of all time.

202
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.500
The fuck did he do with his money that he's driving a Buick?
He would be,

203
00:11:51.501 --> 00:11:55.510
he blew all his God damn from being a player.
He's still got a TV gig.

204
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.210
He's not driving a Buick.
You can't even fucking fit in one.

205
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.470
Maybe though that fucking Roadmaster for back in the 50s.

206
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.990
Cut the roof off of Riviera.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Take out the front seat.

207
00:12:08.991 --> 00:12:10.610
He could sit in the back end.
I Dunno.

208
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.943
<v 0>MMM.</v>

209
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.480
<v 1>Actually Shaq is memorable.</v>

210
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:21.110
I Dunno why he does that.
And then he has the one with the little monopoly guy,

211
00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.740
that general,
which just looks like the cheesiest fucking insurance ever,

212
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.790
you know,
and then check does that,
you know,
I'm not really smiling.

213
00:12:31.791 --> 00:12:33.440
I'm just smiling because I'm going to get paid.

214
00:12:33.441 --> 00:12:35.750
You know where he has the under ran the overbite?

215
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.550
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

216
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.680
<v 1>He just puts his top teeth on his bottom teeth.</v>

217
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.733
<v 0>MMM.</v>

218
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.150
<v 1>I Dunno what the fuck I'm talking about.
I use,
like I said,</v>

219
00:12:45.151 --> 00:12:47.880
I usually don't fucking do these when I fly in the same day.
I just,

220
00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:52.720
of course I have no fucking time.
I have a million fucking things to do.
Uh,

221
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.580
but pop up a bar.
What else?
What else?
What else?
How should I address this?

222
00:12:56.581 --> 00:12:58.300
I will address this,
uh,

223
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.070
the big fucking story that everybody's talking about out there.

224
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.270
I am of the firm fucking belief.
I am of the firm fucking belief.

225
00:13:06.271 --> 00:13:08.280
This is a new theory.
I'm not saying I'm right,

226
00:13:08.281 --> 00:13:13.281
but I am of the fucking belief that the fucking attention that they give to

227
00:13:13.381 --> 00:13:18.060
these fucking lunatics is why more than ever people do that lunatic shit.

228
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.470
Like do you remember when Kim Kardashians,

229
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.760
she made that sex tape and then all of a sudden somebody got ahold of it and

230
00:13:25.761 --> 00:13:30.761
then it went out there and then it became like this porno tape and up until then

231
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.530
that was unbelievably embarrassing and it fucking ruined you.

232
00:13:34.531 --> 00:13:36.540
And then that was it.
That was fucking it.

233
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.190
But some out she came out the other side with the TV show and is now like a

234
00:13:41.191 --> 00:13:45.330
fucking again icon,
multi fucking millionaire.
And right after that happened,

235
00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:46.164
what happened?

236
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.790
A bunch of women who wouldn't have done that shit went out and tried to do that

237
00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:55.060
shit cause they saw it
and what stopped it was none of it.

238
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.240
None of them fucking made it.

239
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:57.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

240
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.001
<v 1>However,</v>

241
00:13:58.001 --> 00:14:00.700
if they started fucking making it and started getting attention the way these

242
00:14:00.701 --> 00:14:04.030
lunatics do,
I saw on the cover of people magazine,

243
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.710
they are like going,
this is the deadliest Yada,
Yada,
Yada,
of all fucking time.

244
00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.430
You're given these,
these fucking lunatics a number to now shoot for.

245
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:18.060
Cause the same way I sat on TV and uh,
sat at home on TV and I'm saying,
oh,

246
00:14:18.061 --> 00:14:19.950
look at that.
Stand up [inaudible] stand up comedy.
That looks cool.

247
00:14:19.951 --> 00:14:23.100
I want to fucking do that.
Lunatics want to do this other shit.

248
00:14:23.101 --> 00:14:26.670
I am of a from fucking belief.
They should not fucking

249
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.750
shouldn't say the dude's name.

250
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.863
<v 0>That's it.</v>

251
00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:33.950
<v 1>You go in,
you're whacked the guy,</v>

252
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.730
you throw him in a fucking incinerator and then you throw his ashes in a fucking

253
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.870
sewer.
That's it.
The right and then you take care of where it got fucking hurt.

254
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.220
That's what you do.
All right?

255
00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:48.580
But all this fucking shit that you then put it on the top and then,
you know,

256
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.050
one of these fucking channels they're going to,

257
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:53.270
they're going to begin to do like they do with the serial killers.
You know,

258
00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:54.530
you'd never know the victims names.

259
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:57.290
You just know that those fucking people and all the fucking celebrities,

260
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.690
you know who,
if they even run their goddamn accounts,

261
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:01.520
then they got to fucking comment about it.

262
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.740
The celebrity reaction to the tragedy where they weren't at,

263
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.280
you know something else.
I fucking,
I'm going to rent.
You know what else I liked?

264
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.030
I liked all these douche bags who are taken videos of themselves.

265
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.830
They weren't anywhere near it.
Who?
Just letting everybody know that Amar,
right?

266
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:18.620
It's like,
yeah,
Dude,
you're 20 fucking miles down the street.

267
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.990
Who the fuck even knew you were there?
Who are you making this for?

268
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:26.300
You can't just text your friends and be like,
yeah dude,
I'm cool.

269
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.753
<v 2>I Dunno.</v>

270
00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.760
<v 1>Everything has gets gotta be about,
everybody's got to make it about themselves.</v>

271
00:15:32.761 --> 00:15:36.690
I fuck it drives me up the fucking wall drives me up the fucking wall.

272
00:15:36.691 --> 00:15:38.270
I have no solution for this shit,
but I,

273
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:43.271
I do firmly fucking believe that they have to stop making these,

274
00:15:44.311 --> 00:15:49.080
these fucking lunatics famous and ranking.

275
00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:54.390
You know,
the body count.
I might be wrong.

276
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.500
The fuck do I know.
I'm a comedian.
Okay,
I'll,

277
00:15:56.501 --> 00:16:01.501
I'll apologize next week I'll wear a fucking a Ted Bundy button on a pimp hat

278
00:16:01.861 --> 00:16:05.640
and I'll fucking apologize to somebody.
I guess.
I don't know what I'm all right.

279
00:16:05.641 --> 00:16:08.280
There you go.
I'm done.
I'm done with my fucking rant there.

280
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:14.480
Anyways,
what else?
What else saw?
Yes,
I went to the fucking,
uh,

281
00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.080
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers game.
Um,

282
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.650
that just fuck that shit just drives me nuts.

283
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.230
It's not about so and so's fucking reactions.

284
00:16:25.231 --> 00:16:28.230
But the people that were there and then the people came in and fucking help the

285
00:16:28.231 --> 00:16:31.350
people.
It's not about the lunatic that did it.
It's about those people.

286
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:35.560
That's what it's about.
So then how about you down the street?
Now he's fucking,

287
00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:38.880
they're in a fucking the DJ stop playing records and I was like,
well,

288
00:16:38.881 --> 00:16:43.770
what's going on?
Um,
anyways,

289
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.680
I had a,
I went to,

290
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.950
I went to the fucking Buccaneers game,
the pirate ship one,

291
00:16:52.951 --> 00:16:55.950
not the Choo Choo trains.
Very confusing for Boston sports fans.
Okay.

292
00:16:55.951 --> 00:16:58.110
We got one with a pirate ship,
one with a Choo Choo train,

293
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:02.010
and our fans will fucking great,
great goddamn fans.

294
00:17:02.011 --> 00:17:04.620
Love the stadium and uh,
you know,

295
00:17:04.621 --> 00:17:09.600
it's funny you could tell that they built the pirate ship first and then they

296
00:17:09.601 --> 00:17:10.830
put the flat screen,

297
00:17:10.831 --> 00:17:15.831
that giant screen afterwards because the Buccaneers won a Superbowl.

298
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.660
I believe that 2002 season.

299
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.650
And I remember vaguely remember them.

300
00:17:22.651 --> 00:17:26.100
They brought the flag up and they put it up on the ship,
which was cool.

301
00:17:26.101 --> 00:17:28.170
You know what I mean?
That bucket is there pirates or whatever.

302
00:17:28.171 --> 00:17:32.190
They got to ship or whatever.
Right.
But now they got this giant flat screen,

303
00:17:32.191 --> 00:17:35.790
so the fucking championship flag was blocking the TV screen.

304
00:17:35.791 --> 00:17:39.660
So now they're super Superbowl flag is made at a mesh.

305
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.450
It's difficult to see.
It's like you won a super bowl.

306
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.200
Should be a giant fucking flag,

307
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.840
move the ship or fucking put the f,
the championship flag somewhere else.

308
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.140
Maybe they have another one.
I couldn't see it,
but that struck me as funny.

309
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.380
You know what I mean?
It also made me like Tampa Bay,

310
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.930
but I'm just gonna look at these fleas.
Fuck going on.
You.

311
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:03.300
They don't have a zillion dollars to just add on to this thing.

312
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:05.760
Like somebody bought a house,
then they got a little money,

313
00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:07.370
they put a fucking addition on it,
you know,

314
00:18:07.371 --> 00:18:11.340
and somebody bought a boat than a recession happened,
you know,

315
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.200
then he came back to the good times.

316
00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:16.290
He bought a big fucking TV and then they got adjust the sails.

317
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.271
You know,
it's white.

318
00:18:20.271 --> 00:18:23.790
You ever see like a degenerate gamblers sitting there playing cards you always

319
00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:28.680
see like,
like signs of when they want.
They'll have like a really shiny bracelet,

320
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.410
you know,
dirty hat,
but like $500 sunglasses.
It's just like,

321
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.800
it's up and down,
up and down,
up and down.
Look the whole fucking wardrobe.

322
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.233
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

323
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.010
<v 1>Dirty jeans with like a fucking wearing a mink.
Um,</v>

324
00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.560
anyways,
so we went there,
had a great time.

325
00:18:47.561 --> 00:18:50.620
It was embarrassed by this one patriots fan who just would not sit down.

326
00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.080
It was just fucking,
you know,

327
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.650
this guy with like 140 pounds and he never got the shit kicked out of him

328
00:18:56.651 --> 00:18:59.820
clearly.
And he just wouldn't sit down.
And people will argue,
well,

329
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.650
is his right if he wants to stand up,
it's like,
but this,
you know,

330
00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:06.160
this is this guy.
He brought his girlfriend,
she short,
she can't see around him.

331
00:19:06.161 --> 00:19:10.000
There's nobody standing in front of them.
And there's patriots friend was like,

332
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.370
you know,
threatening to punch him in his,

333
00:19:12.371 --> 00:19:14.020
forgot when I punch you out your fucking,

334
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.690
it was really like patriots fans arguing with patriots fifth.

335
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.590
It was fucking hilarious.
I saw that.
We even won the game.

336
00:19:20.591 --> 00:19:22.060
We came out of the stadium when I saw it,

337
00:19:22.061 --> 00:19:25.630
it was a group of fucking patriots fans and they were like arguing with each

338
00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:27.540
other and I just heard it vaguely or this guy going to,

339
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.340
why can't I wear a Teddy Bruschi Jersey,
but the,

340
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.950
if you go fuck away by eight and then they just kind of walked by.
Um,

341
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:35.770
<v 2>yeah.</v>

342
00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.350
<v 1>But anyways,
it was a,
it was a great time and I,</v>

343
00:19:38.351 --> 00:19:40.780
we had a great show out there and then the next day,

344
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.610
all sober bill 53 fucking days in,
uh,

345
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.240
we wrote up to the swamp and,
uh,

346
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.630
listening to Ozzy on the way up because of the way up there,
you kind of go,

347
00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.110
not you get like within like 10 miles.

348
00:19:56.111 --> 00:20:01.111
I think if you take the 75 north of where Randy Rhoads died.

349
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.670
So we listened to some early Ozzie,

350
00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:08.620
barely a solo Ozzy I should say on the way up.

351
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.780
And uh,
just had a great time,

352
00:20:10.781 --> 00:20:15.160
pulled in fucking smoked a cigar at a great fucking time,

353
00:20:15.161 --> 00:20:17.890
got to go to another SCC game.
It was a,
it was a great time.

354
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.990
Definitely a great time.
So thank you to everybody came out.
I will definitely,
uh,

355
00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.610
definitely be back.
I think the next time I come back,

356
00:20:24.611 --> 00:20:28.810
maybe I'll go back for a Florida state.
I've been to Miami,

357
00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:30.310
I've been to a,

358
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.350
I been to the gate or I only thing left really is Florida state and then they

359
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.340
sent one,
like,
is it central Florida?

360
00:20:37.341 --> 00:20:41.750
There's another one that always has a lot of NFL players.
Is it southern Florida?

361
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.760
Something like that.
I can't remember.
Whatever,
whatever.
I'll figure it out.
Um,

362
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:48.400
no,
the Patriots Fan,
it wouldn't sit down.

363
00:20:48.401 --> 00:20:52.260
He had a Tom Brady fucking jersey on in salmon shorts and everyone's going to

364
00:20:52.261 --> 00:20:53.770
judge you.
Sit down and sit the fuck down.

365
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.230
First time somebody said sit down and he goes,
turns around,
he goes,

366
00:20:56.231 --> 00:20:59.380
you won't ask me nicely.
Little Shit.
Little fucking guy.

367
00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:01.283
<v 0>MMM.</v>

368
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.340
<v 1>And now like a stocky now to get tied Domi built little guy.</v>

369
00:21:05.341 --> 00:21:09.300
This was just a slight man and uh,
I dunno,

370
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.570
was taken sports way too seriously.
I remember we've,
we've,

371
00:21:11.571 --> 00:21:12.690
we've got a first down,

372
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.570
like a big first down at the end of the game and he did like that,
you know,

373
00:21:15.571 --> 00:21:17.760
that mimic that Jordan thing that he would do.

374
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.860
We'd make a festinating fucking bringers arm up.
You know,

375
00:21:21.861 --> 00:21:26.000
when he sank the fucking shot and it was over,
he fucking did that.

376
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:31.870
You know,
when,
when the Patriots got a first down,
he had fucking lower,

377
00:21:31.871 --> 00:21:34.630
just sticking out and shit has asked that.
I didn't know what the fuck,

378
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:36.590
just looking at him,

379
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.250
a lunatic and he just wouldn't sit down and finally Barden and got them to sit

380
00:21:39.251 --> 00:21:42.970
down.
I can't tell you what he said.
I can tell what it started with.
He said,
hey,

381
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:46.780
Jazelle
sit the fuck down.

382
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:48.790
And I can't say the risk is everybody.
You know,
everybody,

383
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.650
everybody gets all fucking uptight now.
Uh,
but you know what?
It was effective.

384
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.460
He sat the fuck down and did not get up for the rest of the game.

385
00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:58.010
And when he dead,

386
00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:00.850
he's a few times he got up on big plays and everyone else got up and they sat

387
00:22:00.851 --> 00:22:02.590
down.
Then he was finally a fucking gentleman above.

388
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:04.933
<v 0>MMM.</v>

389
00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.670
<v 1>Here's an interesting question.
Paul Versey asked me on the ride back,
he goes,</v>

390
00:22:10.671 --> 00:22:12.140
do you believe in destiny?

391
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:18.500
And I told him no.
He goes,
no,
I'm just asking like,

392
00:22:18.501 --> 00:22:23.300
do you believe like Michael Jordan was destined to be the greatest basketball?

393
00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:24.470
And it's like,
no,
I don't.

394
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.253
<v 0>I don't.</v>

395
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.770
<v 1>And he was saying that he did that he believed that it's just you,</v>

396
00:22:31.771 --> 00:22:36.580
you have your destiny in one of your destiny is like that's what the fuck your

397
00:22:36.581 --> 00:22:41.140
destiny is.
And I,
I just don't believe that.
I don't,

398
00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:42.490
you know what I mean?

399
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:47.320
I think you're born with the talent and if you work your fucking ass off,

400
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:48.730
you can make it happen.

401
00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.313
<v 0>However,</v>

402
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.060
<v 1>how fucked up the world is,</v>

403
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.760
does a bunch of people that can take your destiny away from you.

404
00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.610
Like you can fucking have a,
you know,

405
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.170
your destiny is to be whatever you're going to be a doctor and fucking blah,

406
00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.013
blah,
blah,
blah.

407
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.040
And then you go out one day you drive down the street and you get hit by a drunk

408
00:23:08.041 --> 00:23:11.070
driver and you die.
So like that was your,

409
00:23:11.071 --> 00:23:14.120
that your destiny was to get hit by a drunk driver.
I know.
I don't think that,

410
00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.410
I don't think it is.
I don't think it is.

411
00:23:16.411 --> 00:23:20.490
I think if the world was a perfect place,
everybody would reach that potential.

412
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.300
But,
um,
you know,
I've said this before,

413
00:23:24.301 --> 00:23:27.300
like the world doesn't give a shit about your dream whether it comes true or
not.

414
00:23:27.301 --> 00:23:31.680
It fucking sucks.
And even if you make all the right choices and all that shit,

415
00:23:31.681 --> 00:23:36.210
you know,
some fucking lunatic can,
you know,
take it away from you.

416
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.620
So,
um,
see,
this is why I don't talk about that shit.

417
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:46.210
All you cuts asking me about it.
I don't want to fucking talk it.
It's world's

418
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.430
<v 5>depressing enough as it is.
Um,
all right,</v>

419

424
00:24:10.101 --> 00:24:11.630
if I'm just going to come walking out,
if I'll,

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:12.920
I don't know what I'm going to fucking do.

426

437
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.380
It's really going to be fun as hell.
Uh,

438
00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.950
I know this has been like a fucked up podcast cause I'm trying to talk around a

439
00:25:00.951 --> 00:25:05.120
lot of shit in it,
you know,
and yet another one of my fucking friends died,

440
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.830
coworkers died and uh,
it's just fucking fucking sucks.

441
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.510
It sucks.
You know,
Ralphie make the great,

442
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:19.511
Ralphie may unfortunately passed away this weekend and uh,

443
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.980
just legit,
legit,
legit fucking murderer.

444
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:30.720
That guy just fucking killed it.
Killed him the first time I saw him,

445
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.320
I think it was,
um,

446
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.900
was it the late nineties when he came out?
Okay.

447
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.380
I believe it was the late nineties.

448
00:25:40.381 --> 00:25:44.550
He came out and there was already another comic there.
Bigger guy,

449
00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:48.150
Ron Lester,
who also is since fucking passed away unfortunately,

450
00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:51.810
which I didn't even realize he died last year.
So rest in peace to him.

451
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.130
And um,
you know,

452
00:25:55.131 --> 00:25:57.920
those big guys had to deal with like clubs.

453
00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.840
They kind of had this thing where they just,
you know,

454
00:25:59.841 --> 00:26:03.440
they had their big guy comic and um,

455
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.600
so it was like weird.
They almost were like,
we're in competition with each other.

456
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.380
And um,

457
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.220
then Ron ended up getting all this acting work and he's just sort of stopped

458
00:26:12.221 --> 00:26:15.250
doing standup.
But Ralphie came in and just was just a fucking,

459
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:20.560
was a force to be dealt with.
And um,
you know,

460
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.120
it just fucking sucks.

461
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.870
Remember you always telling me he was gonna teach me how to yeah.

462
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.850
Smoked meat or whatever like that,
you know,
cause he was just going,

463
00:26:28.851 --> 00:26:31.280
you don't know how to do a bill.
He's like,
you from fucking Massachusetts.

464
00:26:31.281 --> 00:26:33.620
I'm from Tennessee,
I'm going to show you how to do it,
blah,
blah,
blah.

465
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.340
And of course we both got busy.
We never got around to doing it.
And a,

466
00:26:37.341 --> 00:26:41.240
I know he's got two little kids.
So,
um,

467
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:44.400
I imagine someone's putting together a benefit somewhere for it.

468
00:26:44.401 --> 00:26:48.810
So I imagine I'll be doing that.
But um,
yeah,

469
00:26:48.811 --> 00:26:52.560
it was just a fucking stairs.
The fucking sad,
sad time.

470
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:56.420
God dammit.
Um,
I remember I did,

471
00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.020
if I did the traveling virus tour with him,
I did a lot of gigs with that guy.

472
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.610
Like a lot of those,
uh,
sort of,
you know,
I dunno,
he was,

473
00:27:05.611 --> 00:27:08.070
you're much younger than me.
What,
how much?
I'm 49.

474
00:27:08.071 --> 00:27:11.280
He was 45 we came up roughly.

475
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.980
He started younger than I did.
That's what it was.
Cause he,

476
00:27:13.981 --> 00:27:18.750
we both kind of started at the same time,
I want to say.
So,
um,

477
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.100
he was always as seasoned as I was.
So I always felt,

478
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.460
I felt like we were the same age,
even though I was older than he was.

479
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.270
So as we went up,
I just,
a lot of comedy festivals,

480
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:35.700
a lot of tours,
the tours always got better.
He was the guy that told you this.

481
00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:38.310
He was,
Ralphie may was the fucking guy.

482
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.260
I remember I did this Gig Chew Chilkoot Charlie's,
which is a great Gig,

483
00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:45.120
but they're fucking accommodations.

484
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:50.121
Where was the worst accommodations I ever had was up in Alaska and I showed up

485
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.420
in the bed,

486
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:56.421
literally was broken and it looked like it looked like the bedbugs like left.

487
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.620
Like they,
they couldn't hack it.
We're like,
fuck this.

488
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.980
And I remember the boards were busted in the,

489
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:13.040
the mattress was like fucking and had a giant crease in it and shit.

490
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:15.930
And I was,
you know,

491
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.780
raised Catholic or whatever.
So rather than expressing that you didn't like it,

492
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:26.070
you just just took it and just was like,
alright,
I gotta be tough.

493
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.210
I got a fucking,

494
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.230
I told you the first night he spent in fucking my walkthrough bedroom,

495
00:28:31.231 --> 00:28:34.200
my first night in New York City,
I've felt this thing on my chest and I,

496
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.730
I turned on the light and there was a roach crawling across my chest and I

497
00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:41.670
flicked it off my fucking chest.
I didn't even kill it.

498
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.400
I just thought it was like,
oh,
this is what I got.
Gotta I got to like a,

499
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.420
I got to get myself tough enough to handle this.

500
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:52.830
Like I'm gonna live with bugs crawling over me.
Yeah.
I'm a fucking loan,
a tech,

501
00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:55.770
I don't know what.
So anyway,
so I do the Gig and I stay in that shit hole.

502
00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:01.590
So I end up going down to the laugh factory like a week or 10 days later and I

503
00:29:01.591 --> 00:29:05.910
walk in.
Raffi was always hanging out,
always did the work,
you know,

504
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.090
and I came down and he was just like,
hey bill,
what's up?
I say,
hey man,
he goes,

505
00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:12.810
wait,
you coming from,
that's what we always asked each other.
Um,

506
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.390
there was certain guys,
you know,
that were just road dogs.

507
00:29:15.391 --> 00:29:20.391
Hedberg Ralphy Stan Hope Giraldo,

508
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.810
like these were,
these were the guys.
Every time I went to a fucking club,

509
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.513
um,

510
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:33.290
they either were just there or they were going to be there the next week.

511
00:29:33.331 --> 00:29:37.290
I just,
when I was coming up,
we were all kind of close in the same rooms.

512
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:42.460
Like headboard was.
I had a little bit ahead of me as was Stan hope.
Um,
and those,

513
00:29:42.461 --> 00:29:42.821
but those,

514
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:47.320
they were roughly my age and those are guys that I really looked up to as far as

515
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:51.340
like,
you know,
they were just,
they were like,

516
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:55.180
they started a few years before me,
so they were just sort of cutting this

517
00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:01.240
path and they end their style is like,
I want to do that.

518
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.850
I want to say what the fuck I want to say on state.

519
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.910
I don't want to do what they're doing.
I want to,
you know,

520
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.080
be who the fuck I am the way they are was basically it.
So anyways,

521
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.990
we used to always ask each other where you come from,

522
00:30:13.991 --> 00:30:16.600
where you're going or whatever,
right.
Whenever I rent to any of those guys.

523
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:22.300
And um,
so I run into Ralphie and he goes,
where are you coming from?

524
00:30:22.301 --> 00:30:25.750
I was like,
I did that Gig up in Alaska.
Chilkoot Charlie's like,
oh fuck.

525
00:30:25.751 --> 00:30:28.680
I did that Gig.
Great Gig.
I was like,
yeah,
great gig.
And I said,

526
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:33.220
Jesus Christ ago about that comedy Condo and Ralphie got this serious look on

527
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:38.020
his face.
He goes,
he goes,
I didn't stay.
There.
I go,
what do you mean?
He goes,
man,

528
00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:40.540
he goes,
I took one look at that place.
He goes,
I'm not staying here.

529
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.860
And they got me a hotel room and I just looked at him and I said,

530
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:48.520
you can do that.
And he laughed.
He goes,
yeah.
He goes,

531
00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:51.190
what the fuck are they going to do?
He goes,
it's Alaska.

532
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:53.830
They're going to get another fucking comedian,

533
00:30:53.831 --> 00:30:55.750
the fly six hours all the way up there,

534
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.960
have some lumber jack on stage and tell some street jokes.
It's like,

535
00:30:58.961 --> 00:31:03.120
just just say no.
And uh,
that was one of those things I,

536
00:31:03.121 --> 00:31:07.150
I fucking learned that.
I was just like,
all right.
And after that,
after that,

537
00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:11.380
if I went someplace,
I just,
and it was a shit.
All I just said no.

538
00:31:11.381 --> 00:31:14.410
And if they just said,
we're not paying for a hotel room,
I said,
you know what,

539
00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:17.680
I'm going to,
I'm going to pay for a fucking hotel room.

540
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:24.090
And it was worth it to just be able to go back to a fucking place where you felt

541
00:31:24.581 --> 00:31:27.970
safe and you didn't feel like there was going to be bugs crawling on you or

542
00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:30.000
somebody's just all over the fucking bar.

543
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.530
God knows what fucked some chicken a period.

544
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:34.570
Nine even going to tell you that fucking story.

545
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:39.490
Every comedian knows that fucking what the Goddamn fucking crime scene cleaning

546
00:31:39.491 --> 00:31:40.324
lady quit.

547
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:44.410
And the big rumor was the bloodstains was still on the fucking windows self.

548
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.180
Swear to God.
This is all,

This is not myths.
I'm

549
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.230

Ralphy I'm going to mess your body.

550
00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:59.830
Uh,

551
00:31:59.831 --> 00:32:03.670
let's get into some now that talked about another dead friend.

dude.
All right,

America.
I'm not reading that one.

681
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:26.170
Um,
are my mom and her boyfriend being selfish or am I,

682
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.630
uh,
by the way,
that person wrote,
fuck you.
America.
I'm not saying that you,

683
00:40:30.631 --> 00:40:32.020
that you didn't make some decent points there,

684
00:40:32.021 --> 00:40:35.110
but it's a waste of time for you to write that for me to read it after you write

685
00:40:35.111 --> 00:40:35.531
that.
All right,

686
00:40:35.531 --> 00:40:38.950
why don't you grow the fuck up and come up with a more mature title?

687
00:40:38.951 --> 00:40:42.880
And I'll read that one.
How about that?
How about that?
How about that?

688
00:40:42.881 --> 00:40:47.320
And then I'll wade into the topic of gun control is if I know a fucking thing

689
00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:48.880
about it or even have a solution,

690
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:52.900
are my mom and her boyfriend being selfish or a my dear bill,

691
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:57.990
I'm 19 and live at home working to get this carpenter's apprenticeship with the

692
00:40:58.361 --> 00:41:01.970
local union.
And please don't say my name on the podcast.
Well,

693
00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:05.890
why would you give me your name?
You fucking moron.
Um,

694
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.180
about two months ago,

695
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:11.200
my mom's boyfriend started coming over and staying over to a point where he was

696
00:41:11.201 --> 00:41:15.310
practically living there.
Grows a,

697
00:41:15.311 --> 00:41:18.160
they would stay here and this place exists.

698
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.390
They would stay here in his place.
Exactly half the time.

699
00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.410
The first few days he was here,
I heard their headboard day and night.

700
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.010
I was like,
who the fuck is this guy?
Oh my God,

701
00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:33.980
boy.
Oh boy.
My

702
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.910
<v 1>mom said they had been friends for a year now,
but only went on two dates.</v>

703
00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:42.590
I asked her to have him not be here as much and if she could just come home

704
00:41:42.591 --> 00:41:44.300
without him.
I don't want him.

705
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:49.150
I don't want to talk to my mom with this guy right fucking there.
Uh,

706
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:52.670
nothing changed until one night I snapped and went on a rampage.

707
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:57.770
My mom called the cops on me that night and now the half the time they would,

708
00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.660
they would have spent here is just my mom now.
Uh,
but here's the kicker,

709
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.150
so that's good.
You got them out of the house but is the kicker.

710
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:08.630
Two weeks later he proposed,
oh boy.

711
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.970
When my mom talked to me about it,

712
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.850
she asked if I had a problem with her wearing the ring.

713
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:17.390
Literally the question was only about the ring,
not the engagement.

714
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.680
I feel totally disrespected by him and my mom for not seeing that this guy has

715
00:42:21.681 --> 00:42:23.150
no respect for her son.

716
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:27.920
I've decided to join the coast guard because the union stuff is taking too long.

717
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.710
I would have just moved in with my dad if every day.

718
00:42:30.711 --> 00:42:34.810
He didn't just bring out how much of a bitch my mom is.
Jesus Christ.

719
00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:35.840
This is awful,
man.

720
00:42:35.841 --> 00:42:39.740
I'm sorry you're going through this and I was life sucks in a kit and I can't be

721
00:42:39.741 --> 00:42:41.360
around that.
Uh,

722
00:42:41.361 --> 00:42:45.740
I'm ready to walk away and just drop my family and Tyree.
Tyree.

723
00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:48.500
My mom swears this guy's a super,
super nice,

724
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.550
but he doesn't give a fuck about her life as a mother and subsequently me.

725
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.690
Or maybe I'm wrong.

726
00:42:53.691 --> 00:42:57.500
I just wanted to get another opinion because I'm ready to just cut off everyone

727
00:42:57.501 --> 00:42:59.930
in my family and walk away.
Thanks to go fuck yourself.
Well,

728
00:42:59.931 --> 00:43:03.770
it's your mom and your dad.
You don't want to do that.
Um,
you know,

729
00:43:03.771 --> 00:43:06.050
I could see why you want to get out of the house when he gets to somebody

730
00:43:06.051 --> 00:43:11.000
banging your fucking mother.
I mean,
Jesus Christ a mom.
How about doggy style,

731
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:14.960
you know what I mean?
You always got to be in the fucking missionary position.
Um,

732
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.590
something for,
for Christ's sake.
Can you slide down the bed a little more?

733
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.073
<v 0>Uh,</v>

734
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:23.490
<v 1>all right.
Well until you move out,</v>

735
00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.950
I would recommend getting some wireless headphones.

736
00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:29.300
Maybe those Bose ones that block out the fucking noise.

737
00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:32.210
I don't know what to tell you dude.
Um,

738
00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:37.040
I wouldn't join the coast guard unless you wanted to.
Uh,

739
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.930
or the coast guard sounds.
That sounds like a great fucking job to me.

740
00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.660
Although I did fuck a talk about that.
You know,
that time I went on,

741
00:43:43.661 --> 00:43:46.800
the thing about like,
whenever a fucking hurricane's coming or everybody's,

742
00:43:46.801 --> 00:43:47.634
you know,

743
00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:48.700
<v 0>okay.</v>

744
00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.880
<v 1>Going to safety,
like how everybody in the coast guard is just like,</v>

745
00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.550
they gotta be on pins and needles because they know some dumb fucks going to

746
00:43:54.551 --> 00:43:58.060
take this stupid boat out there and then when they fuck up and then they call to

747
00:43:58.061 --> 00:43:58.780
rescue them,

748
00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.990
these poor men and women are going to have to go out and go fish them out.

749
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:03.060
<v 0>MMM.</v>

750
00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:06.390
<v 1>All right.
So what are you asking me here?</v>

751
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:11.060
I would not cut out your mother and your father.
Uh,
I would talk,

752
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.870
I would communicate to your mother how you feel about that guy.

753
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.240
And now you don't feel that he respects you.
Okay.

754
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.160
And that's the reason you're leaving,
I guess.

755
00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.410
And then I want to talk to your dad saying,
you know,
dad,

756
00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:22.280
I would love to stay with you,

757
00:44:22.281 --> 00:44:24.650
but all you do is bitch and say what a bitch my mother is.

758
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.770
And she's my mom and I am sick of listening to it.
All right?

759
00:44:27.771 --> 00:44:32.280
Just try to say it in a nicer fucking way.
But,
um,
I don't,

760
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:36.870
it doesn't sound like they're here when you
a fuck.

761
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:38.970
But here's the thing,
dude,
if you're going to be,
you can't,

762
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.820
you gotta fucking clear the air with them because you can't go into the coast

763
00:44:41.821 --> 00:44:44.130
guard in angry fucking lunatic.

764
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.770
Cause what's going to happen is you're going to get to a fight or something

765
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:48.390
because you're pissed off at that fucker.
Do.

766
00:44:48.391 --> 00:44:52.530
She was banging your mom and then that's going to affect your career.
So,

767
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:56.730
uh,
this is something that I've been working on.
This is fucking brutal.

768
00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.710
A forgiving people,

769
00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:04.610
like that guy you got to somewhere in your head and just forgive the guy for

770
00:45:04.611 --> 00:45:09.560
being a fucking moron and you get that off of you.

771
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:16.100
And uh,
you know,
when you forgive somebody,
it does,

772
00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.160
it does a lot for you.
It gets it off of you.

773
00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:23.000
And then what you should be focusing on is trying

774
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.560
<v 3>yeah.</v>

775
00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:29.560
<v 1>Figure out what your dream is and start walking towards it every day and uh,</v>

776
00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:31.370
and creating a life.

777
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:32.910
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

778
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:34.620
<v 1>That isn't like what you grew up with</v>

779
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:39.720
so your kids someday doesn't have to fucking deal with what you dealt with.

780
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.080
And uh,
you know,
and that doesn't happen overnight.

781
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:47.400
And the mistakes I made was I went out thinking,
all right,
I want to,

782
00:45:47.401 --> 00:45:50.880
I want to change all this about what I didn't like about growing up.

783
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:52.570
But then what happens is you grew,

784
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.530
you gravitate towards what's familiar and you end up reading.

785
00:45:55.590 --> 00:46:00.540
I think he kind of go out and recreate it.
Um,
inevitably,

786
00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:03.150
and then you have to dismantle that,
start over again.

787
00:46:03.151 --> 00:46:04.080
At least that's what happened to me.

788
00:46:04.081 --> 00:46:06.780
I'm up super imposed and whatever the fuck happened to me.
But uh,

789
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:12.420
uh,
I wouldn't come at your mother or your art or your dad with anger.

790
00:46:12.421 --> 00:46:17.130
I would just say,
listen,
I,
uh,
um,
I,
I forgive you.

791
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.070
I forgive you.
I'm not happy with this.
I forgive you.

792
00:46:20.071 --> 00:46:22.260
I understand you got to try to do what's right for you.

793
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:27.300
But this bothered me because x,
y,
and Z.
And just say,
Tell Your Dad said,
dad,

794
00:46:27.301 --> 00:46:29.940
you know,
so I got to forgive you for something and now got his attention.

795
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.080
I forgive you for every time that I came over here and you went on and on about

796
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.340
what a fucking bitch.

797
00:46:35.341 --> 00:46:40.341
My mother was all right and did a lot of damage and it did so much damage that I

798
00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:44.250
have to sit here and try to figure out how to forgive you for that.

799
00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:48.640
And then just stop talking and listen to what he says.
Okay.

800
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:49.780
If he's any sort of a man,

801
00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.200
his head's going to drop and he's going to fucking apologize to you.
And you can,

802
00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.600
you know,
and I'm not saying that it,

803
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:58.350
all the anger you're going to have towards them goes away.
Right.
Then it,

804
00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:03.360
you start that and if you guys work on starting over from that point and really

805
00:47:03.731 --> 00:47:07.720
fucking work on it and really fucking communicate,
uh,

806
00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:11.320
hopefully you can go out into the world and not be an angry young man like I was

807
00:47:11.321 --> 00:47:15.610
because I heard a lot of people.
Um,
all right.
There you go.
All right,

808
00:47:15.611 --> 00:47:18.870
problem with girlfriend.
Dear billion.

809
00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:21.720
I have a big problem with my girlfriend,
with my

810
00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.450
<v 8>lady.</v>

811
00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.010
<v 1>It's coming to me.
I</v>

812
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.010
<v 5>am a big problem with my girlfriend.
If we'd been date,</v>

813
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:37.570
well we'd been dating for the past three years and I think I might want to marry

814
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:42.850
her.
But for the last month or so we've been having a fight.

815
00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:48.190
My sister and I are very close and since my parents died last year in a car

816
00:47:48.191 --> 00:47:52.930
crash,
we moved in together,
which for some reason pissed her off.

817
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.730
I don't know why.
Well,
I mean,
where were you living before that?

818
00:47:57.731 --> 00:47:59.730
She probably half to three years.
Wanted you to marry,

819
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:04.520
move in with her probably once a God damn ring.
Um,

820
00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:10.290
then for some reason the fact that my sister and my best friend still smoked pot

821
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.840
and that they are doing it.
Then for some reason,

822
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:18.220
the fact that my sister and my best friends still smoke pot and that they are

823
00:48:18.221 --> 00:48:22.300
dating as well.
Oh,
she doesn't like that either.
Um,

824
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:26.590
I would admit it was weird for me at first,
but I got used to it anyway.

825
00:48:26.591 --> 00:48:29.470
The fight was about the fact that she wants to move in,

826
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.800
that she wants me to move in with her.
Yeah.
Obviously,

827
00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:37.540
but I don't want to and she refuses to move in with me as long as my sister is

828
00:48:37.541 --> 00:48:39.550
there.
I do love her and all that stuff.

829
00:48:39.551 --> 00:48:41.650
But this is something that I just can't do.

830
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:46.860
My sister is in a very fragile place right now and my girlfriend can't get that

831
00:48:47.021 --> 00:48:50.260
or won't,
I don't know what to do if possible.
Can you ask me?

832
00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:52.480
I feel like women would understand better.
Well,

833
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.520
she's downstairs dealing with my daughter.
Um,

834
00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.880
here's the deal with women that they work on a different clock than we do,

835
00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:05.680
all right?
So you just took three years of her life.
All right.

836
00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:07.900
And all she's hearing is,
you know,
you know that story,

837
00:49:07.901 --> 00:49:11.620
that telltale heart under the floorboards that their,
that's their fucking womb.

838
00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:16.990
All right?
They have a finite amount of time where they can have kids all right.

839
00:49:16.991 --> 00:49:19.810
Before you still have to start doing some buck Rogers shit.
Okay.

840
00:49:19.811 --> 00:49:23.200
And women do not want to go through that if they don't have to.
All right?

841
00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:27.670
So what she needs out of you is some sort of fucking commitment.
All right.

842
00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.040
And she was looking for that after three years.

843
00:49:30.041 --> 00:49:33.730
The fact that all she wanted to do is move in,
she's been pretty cool.

844
00:49:33.731 --> 00:49:36.940
She should probably be gone for the fucking ring depending on how old you are.

845
00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.760
Um,
and what I would do with,
if I was you,
dude,

846
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:42.880
I would man the fuck up and either commit with tour,
I break up with their,

847
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:43.743
one of the other.

848
00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:45.420
<v 0>MMM.</v>

849
00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.070
<v 5>Although the wildcard is,</v>

850
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:52.760
is that your parents died last year in a car crash.
So,

851
00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:54.420
<v 0>okay.</v>

852
00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:57.840
<v 5>You probably not in a place emotionally to make that fucking decision.</v>

853
00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.553
<v 0>MMM.</v>

854
00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:05.770
<v 5>Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
You know what?
Fuck everything that I just said.</v>

855
00:50:05.771 --> 00:50:07.990
Your parents died in a fucking car crash last year.

856
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.180
You got to look out for your family members,

857
00:50:10.181 --> 00:50:12.630
and if she can't fucking understand that,
then uh,

858
00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:14.170
<v 0>yeah,</v>

859
00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:15.280
<v 5>I know.
I don't know what to tell you.</v>

860
00:50:15.281 --> 00:50:17.470
I guess she got to figure out how many you're going to find out how much you

861
00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:18.304
love her.

862
00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:20.550
<v 0>Okay.</v>

863
00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:25.110
<v 5>You know,
if,
if she got to let it go,
maybe you've got to let it go.
I Dunno.</v>

864
00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.610
I have no fucking idea.
Um,

865
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:31.190
but I understand her side.

866
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:35.660
I've invested three years in this and you moved in with another woman and it's

867
00:50:35.661 --> 00:50:40.280
your sister.
That seems like a step backwards to her.
And then she has to move in.

868
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:45.210
She wanted to fucking cheat.
Let's,
this chick wants to marry you.

869
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.550
So she wanted to move in and then have you guys have a bunch of communal stuff

870
00:50:49.551 --> 00:50:52.190
because women think that if you do that,
that you're not going to the end of,

871
00:50:52.191 --> 00:50:54.290
there's a less of a chance that you're going to break up with them.

872
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.740
They feel like it's moving in a positive direction and you went left,

873
00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:01.790
took a left hand turn,
but life gave you a fucking lefthand turn.

874
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:06.440
So you're both not wrong.
Why don't you try that?

875
00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.860
Just say to her,
look,
you're not wrong for being mad at me

876
00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:15.560
and I'm also not wrong for taking care of my sister.

877
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.420
And then just stare at her and whoever talks first loses

878
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:26.210
something along those lines.
You're not wrong.
And she's not wrong.

879
00:51:26.211 --> 00:51:28.910
She's not wrong after three years to fucking be like,
what the fuck?

880
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.510
And you're not wrong for looking out for your sister when something tragic like

881
00:51:32.511 --> 00:51:34.940
that.
They just fucking nothing but tragedy nowadays.

882
00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:41.120
Jesus Christ.
Sorry that happens for you sir.
Uh,
two years,
sir.

883
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:45.770
Alright.
Geographically locked by marriage.
Jesus.
There's just,

884
00:51:45.771 --> 00:51:49.130
there's just no ray of light here.
A high bill.
Love your work.

885
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:52.520
Thank you for the laughter.
Hey,
some positive.

886
00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:58.660
I've been in a relationship since 2011 with a European woman that became a

887
00:52:00.321 --> 00:52:02.810
marriage.
I am originally from South America,

888
00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:07.070
educated in the u s went to fancy school.
They're MIT.
Look at you.

889
00:52:07.071 --> 00:52:10.580
You smart bastard.
Then got my phd in Europe.
Whoa.

890
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.630
Lottie de spread your brain all around the fucking world here.

891
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:17.480
Uh,
we've been in a solid couple.

892
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:22.690
Our glue was out of love from mountaineering mountain climbers.

893
00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:26.990
I went a mountaineering.
I didn't know what the fuck that is.

894
00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.830
There's a weird sex shit or does that mean you fucking,

895
00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:34.990
it's not rock climbing mountaineering.

896
00:52:34.991 --> 00:52:38.680
You just walk up a mountain yodeling and outdoor sports.

897
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.420
Fuck his mountaineering

898
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:46.920
jeep had a wagon here.
I remember that.

899
00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:51.420
I remember a mountain here bout to nearing.

900
00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:53.270
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

901
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:56.950
<v 5>Wikipedia.
You always have the answers.</v>

902
00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:01.660
The term mountaineering describes the port,
the,
the sport of mountain climbing.

903
00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:07.680
Also rock climbing is what people do at gyms now in mountaineering is if you

904
00:53:07.901 --> 00:53:09.700
actually go up a mountain,
okay,
I get it.

905
00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:15.480
While some scholars identify mountaineering related activity as climbing,

906
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:19.390
parentheses,
rock and ice and trekking up mountains.

907
00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:24.010
Others are also adding backpacking,
hiking,
skiing.

908
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:29.880
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
I already see these groups were were mountaineering too.

909
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:36.130
We just take a ski lift.
All right,
mountaineering.
All right.

910
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.850
Jesus Christ.
Dude,
what are you fucking James Bond,

911
00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:45.280
born in Africa and went to MIT.
Got Your Phd in Europe.

912
00:53:45.281 --> 00:53:48.580
Your fucking client.
You climb mountains,
other outdoor sports.

913
00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:53.480
How do you top mountaineering?
Huh?
What are you do?

914
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.690
I'm trying to think how you talk to as far as outdoor sports.
Uh,

915
00:53:58.691 --> 00:54:02.860
but now things are a,
what else do you do?

916
00:54:02.861 --> 00:54:05.740
You grab cobras by the fucking tail and kiss him on the back of their head.

917
00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:10.180
By now things are a bit sour but happened.
We are working way.

918
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.750
We'd always been a solid cup or our glue was out.

919
00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:18.190
Our love for mountaineering outdoor sports.
But now things are a bit sour.

920
00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:23.020
I don't see how I can have a career here in this continent and she's a working

921
00:54:23.021 --> 00:54:25.630
class lady who would suffer a lot from moving.

922
00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:29.350
I also have a good business possibility in my home country.
Brazil.

923
00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:35.510
Oh,
South America,
I think he said Africa.
South America.

924
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:40.480
Okay,
so you simply can't let that go.
I developed somewhat,

925
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:45.490
somewhat of a scorned for the paperwork required to simply exit exist in Europe

926
00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:50.030
and would rather be on my own,
live up to my own country,

927
00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:52.220
uh,

928
00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:56.750
make my money and have the freedom to explore my vast underdeveloped continent,

929
00:54:57.230 --> 00:55:01.250
but she wouldn't be able to come along.
Also for my high tech education,

930
00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:05.120
most good jobs are in the great us of a,

931
00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:10.050
but I'm also burnt out with visas and permits and red flags.
Uh,

932
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:13.220
I don't think I have the strength to beg for a high tech job.

933
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:16.730
They will pay me less than my business in Brazil.
Other than that,

934
00:55:16.731 --> 00:55:18.860
we get along fine.
She's a solid partner,

935
00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:23.480
but not the type who would survive the third world.
I think it's a no brainer,

936
00:55:23.481 --> 00:55:28.150
but I'm lost homebound and we'd love your thoughts.
Thank you.
Ah,
Jesus.
Damn.

937
00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.600
Until that's a huge fear going out.

938
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:32.480
You're going to ask a fucking comedian who doesn't know you to make that

939
00:55:32.481 --> 00:55:33.314
decision.

940
00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:42.380
I think at the end of the day,
whenever it comes down to stuff like this,

941
00:55:42.381 --> 00:55:46.730
you have to make decisions that are going to make you happy,
all right?

942
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:48.560
If you don't,

943
00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:50.810
you're not going to be happy and then you're going to make the person you're

944
00:55:50.811 --> 00:55:53.570
with miserable.
However,
if there's kids involved,

945
00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:57.290
then you know you got to man up and suffer.

946
00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:00.710
It doesn't sound like you got any fucking kids.
All right?

947
00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:03.950
If you're married to this woman and you don't have any fucking kids,

948
00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:08.470
then you know if you're going to start getting resentful and he just going to

949
00:56:08.471 --> 00:56:10.120
argue and argue and argue and argue,

950
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:14.630
all you guys are going to do is take great years,

951
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.420
young,
healthy,
fucking years of your life.

952
00:56:17.421 --> 00:56:20.630
We should be having a good time and you're going to just make each other fucking

953
00:56:20.631 --> 00:56:24.070
miserable.
All right?
So either you figure out to fuck to stay with

954
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.670
<v 1>her or she comes along with you or you go your separate ways,
but</v>

955
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:30.063
<v 0>mmm.</v>

956
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:32.230
<v 1>If you need to,
you know,
cause guys were not,</v>

957
00:56:32.231 --> 00:56:36.170
could sometimes expressing ourselves.
Maybe you sit down before you talk to her,

958
00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.360
you write down what would make you happy.

959
00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:43.460
You write down the points you want to make.
I used to do this shit so I could,

960
00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:44.870
I still haven't mastered this,

961
00:56:44.871 --> 00:56:48.020
but so I could figure out how to fucking have a productive confrontation.

962
00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.960
And I would list all the points that I wanted to make.

963
00:56:50.961 --> 00:56:54.710
I would list what I wanted and then I draw a big stupid smiley face reminding me

964
00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:59.660
not to be an angry cunt.
Um,
so I dunno if that helps you.
I hope it did.

965
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:01.343
<v 0>MMM.</v>

966
00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:03.490
<v 1>So anyways,</v>

967
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:09.130
as if there weren't enough tragedies this month,
my fucking,

968
00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:14.950
my fucking a,
I don't want to happen.
They didn't record the f one race today.

969
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:20.320
So I missed that.
Japan one.
I did see the clip where for whatever reason,
uh,

970
00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:24.880
Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel where like in some meeting in front of all

971
00:57:24.881 --> 00:57:28.960
the other drivers,
like telling on each other,
you know,
Ooh,

972
00:57:28.961 --> 00:57:32.860
he took his steering wheel off the guys.
I go,

973
00:57:32.861 --> 00:57:37.861
he took his seat pell abos loose that just maybe I should just slide.

974
00:57:37.961 --> 00:57:39.790
Just I swear to God,
man,

975
00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:44.820
I is like f one is that like the soccer of of motor sports.

976
00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:50.900
I can't believe what kind of have a fucking,
I don't understand people who they,

977
00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:55.930
they have the balls to drive 200 miles an hour on each other's fucking bumpers

978
00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:02.560
staring death in the face and then they go in there and they fucking tell on

979
00:58:02.561 --> 00:58:05.020
each other.
I just,
that was really disappointing to see.

980
00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.593
<v 0>MMM.</v>

981
00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:11.040
<v 1>I still love the sport.
It's such a great fucking sport,
but I don't know,</v>

982
00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:14.070
you know what it is.
Maybe it's just,
maybe that's just,
it's too much access.

983
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:18.930
I don't need to see that shit.
You know what I mean?
I don't need to see that.

984
00:58:18.931 --> 00:58:21.000
Fuck.
I don't need to know all the fucking ins and outs.

985
00:58:21.001 --> 00:58:24.510
The Rosie the riveter Susko fucking complaining about this or that.
But anyways,

986
00:58:24.511 --> 00:58:26.940
come back.
Congratulations to Lewis Hamilton.

987
00:58:26.941 --> 00:58:31.110
Despite the fact you're telling on people in meetings shamelessly.

988
00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:32.910
Maybe that's like a fucking European thing.

989
00:58:32.911 --> 00:58:37.170
Like they just have different fucking rules over there.
You know what I mean?

990
00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:38.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

991
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:40.990
<v 1>You can walk around in a banana hammock fucking Speedo,</v>

992
00:58:40.991 --> 00:58:44.420
and that's just totally acceptable fucking telling on people.
I mean,

993
00:58:44.421 --> 00:58:46.630
that was just,
I was embarrassing.

994
00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:48.253
<v 0>MMM.</v>

995
00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:53.550
<v 1>I Dunno.
I don't fucking know.
Why did I bring up how much I love boozing now.</v>

996
00:58:53.551 --> 00:58:57.420
I'm just thinking about getting one of those custom mattresses,
number,

997
00:58:57.421 --> 00:59:01.050
that thing where they used to have the lady jumping up and down on the mattress

998
00:59:01.051 --> 00:59:03.540
and the guy would have the glass of red wine and it wouldn't spill.

999
00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:10.320
That's where I need,
uh,
anyways,
I start,
uh,

1000
00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:16.230
I got some acting work coming up here over the next,
uh,
I dunno,

1001
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:17.850
four or five weeks.

1002
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:23.600
So I got in at least another 20 days on whole not booze and think and um,

1003
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:28.220
I'm actually really enjoying it.
I've dropped some weight and shit.
I,

1004
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:31.310
I do enjoy not drinking,
but I will tell you this,

1005
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:35.930
it's just nighttime right now and it's fucking difficult.
Oh,
look who's here.

1006
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:40.900
Hey Baby.
There ain't no easy way.
Yeah.

1007
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.740
I won't back down.

1008
00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:45.620
And I was one of the great things I've ever seen in this sporting event.

1009
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:51.350
<v 9>Right.
Could you please say that again?</v>

1010
00:59:51.351 --> 00:59:54.880
It's do your impression to me again a bit rate.

1011
00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.720
They her see it at a sporting event.

1012
00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.620
The lovely mia.
Everybody.
Okay Dad,

1013
01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:10.040
how you doing?
Good.
I'm doing,
I'm great.
Baby's asleep.

1014
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.510
Oh God.
What's going on?
It's been awhile.
Yeah,

1015
01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.150
I got her all amped up today,
didn't it?
Yes,
she did.

1016
01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:23.360
She had one nap for 30 minutes all day.
That's ridiculous.
We just,

1017
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:27.350
we were excited to see each other.
Yeah.
She was excited to see you.
It was cute.

1018
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.570
You guys are cute.

1019
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:34.320
<v 1>Yeah,
it's ridiculous.
I love that kid,
obviously.
Um,
Ooh.</v>

1020
01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.300
What do we got here?
Oh,
I already read this one.
Whoa.
This guy won it.
All right.

1021
01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.540
I,
I'll just paraphrase these two things.
All right.
Oh,
you already did them.

1022
01:00:42.541 --> 01:00:47.350
You don't have to go back.
Well,
there was one guy,
right?
His,

1023
01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.710
his,
his mom.
He's like 19.

1024
01:00:49.711 --> 01:00:52.890
He lives at home and his mom has a new boyfriend and he could literally hear the

1025
01:00:52.891 --> 01:00:57.600
headboard getting fucking,
yeah.
Terrible.
Terrible.
Right?
Yeah.
And then if he'd go,

1026
01:00:57.601 --> 01:01:00.900
he'd go stay with his dad,
but his dad is always talking about what a bitch is,

1027
01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:04.110
you know,
a divorce.
Oh,
that's brutal acts.
Yeah.

1028
01:01:04.111 --> 01:01:07.980
So now he's thinking of just like joining the fucking coast guard just so he

1029
01:01:07.981 --> 01:01:08.140
didn't

1030
01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.990
<v 9>not,
well,
I mean if you want to,</v>

1031
01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:13.180
but that seems like an awfully extreme.

1032
01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.050
<v 1>What'd she get?
A job and like child world maybe?</v>

1033
01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:21.550
<v 9>Yeah,
definitely.
Try to find his own place.
Try to stay on land and work it out.</v>

1034
01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:24.490
Yeah,
I think so.
I don't think that you'd have to join nothing.

1035
01:01:24.491 --> 01:01:25.840
There's anything wrong with the coast guard.

1036
01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:29.240
<v 1>I think the coast guard you going,
he's gotta be ran in Pussy.
Scotty,</v>

1037
01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.750
how you get,
you walk around a uniform,
you're on a boat.

1038
01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:37.920
You bunch of other dudes.
Yeah.
Then you,
but you,
you're not like,

1039
01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.800
you're not out to see you.
Just anytime.

1040
01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:45.580
<v 9>Oh,
does it?
Does it not count if you're on a boat?
What do you mean?</v>

1041
01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.850
Just this whatnot count.
I don't know what you're saying.
I mean,

1042
01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:57.640
you know.
Oh,
right.
You know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking of the navy.

1043
01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.250
The coast guard is not the same as the navy.
No,
it is w.
W what do you,

1044
01:02:03.251 --> 01:02:06.220
when you said,
when you said it doesn't count,
what do you,
what do you mean?

1045
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.240
What doesn't count?

1046
01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:12.880
Like you know like when guys go to jail and stuff,
like it doesn't count.

1047
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.560
Like you're not like necessarily you're talking about guys banging other guys.

1048
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:24.870
How did you get
and what does it mean?
It doesn't count

1049
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:32.100
to see who said where.
Did you ever hear that?

1050
01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.300
I feel like you have a bang of guy.
Yeah.
I didn't count.
I was out on a lake.

1051
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:38.460
No,

1052
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:43.460
I feel like for sexually flexible men or whatever,

1053
01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:49.040
like if you're in an extreme situation like jail or out to see what in God's

1054
01:02:49.651 --> 01:02:54.000
name are you talking about?
Like it doesn't know these people,

1055
01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:58.080
they go out so many tips over and an inner too.
There's a drug dealer coming up.

1056
01:02:58.081 --> 01:03:00.390
They'd go out and they fuck him up and then they come back.
Yeah,

1057
01:03:00.391 --> 01:03:04.410
they go on a patrol.
But this isn't like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I got confused.
I was,

1058
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.840
I was thinking that it was like the navy.

1059
01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:11.540
Why you like out on a boat like for months?
Yeah,
but the navy,
then I went,

1060
01:03:11.541 --> 01:03:12.690
they're fucking each other.

1061
01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.590
They come into port and then they bang a bunch of mine was there.

1062
01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:21.330
Not In the navy.
You can help your fellow man.

1063
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:28.470
That was the village people.
All right.
Do you think native Americans are gay?

1064
01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:32.940
Cause I,
one guy with the head dress was going macho,
macho man,

1065
01:03:32.941 --> 01:03:37.941
but they were singing about like guy stuff like this where there's groups of men

1066
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.390
together.
Listen,
I've been to the YMC,
I never fucked another guy.

1067
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:49.470
I went there and I used their unbelievably old workout equipment.

1068
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:54.960
I played some pickup.
Oop.
I didn't see any gay sex happening there.

1069
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:59.190
All right,
well fine.
Obviously the coast guard is not as same as the navy,

1070
01:03:59.191 --> 01:04:01.230
but I was just saying that if it was,

1071
01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:06.320
it would be fine because it doesn't care how could steer out to sea and like

1072
01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:12.720
normal element and it's like you like high right now.

1073
01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.950
I swear to God,
I'm not,
I know it sound really high right now,

1074
01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.110
but I'm not,
but like you can,
she's getting over being sick.
By the way.

1075
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.590
This isn't like some smoker thing with her.
Um,
yeah.

1076
01:04:25.591 --> 01:04:29.910
Cause they're going to be like,
oh,
she's got a smoker's cough.
Um,
no,
I just,

1077
01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:35.370
uh,
I don't know.
My point is,
I don't know what my point was.

1078
01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:39.510
I was saying my thing is the navy.
No,
I feel like,
oh,

1079
01:04:39.511 --> 01:04:41.880
he's doing in the coast guard.
He's joined the coast guard.

1080
01:04:41.881 --> 01:04:43.800
I figured that that's like a fucking,
uh,

1081
01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:46.010
like if you meet somebody in a bar would think as a woman.

1082
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:49.050
The Guy said he's in the coast guard.
It's like being like,
you know,

1083
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:53.160
women like fireman.
It's like you're a farm and except you're fucking on a boat.

1084
01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:58.560
Yeah.
And you like going,
there you go.
Yeah,
it's hot.
That's what it,

1085
01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:01.170
that's what I was talking about.
You have to go and talk about jail.
Sex.

1086
01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:06.090
I don't want to fuck that came from,
isn't enough.
This kid has to think of,

1087
01:05:06.091 --> 01:05:08.420
we hear his mother getting banged up against the fucking headboard.

1088
01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.020
You've got to bring up fucking prison sex.

1089
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:18.430
You know,
this podcast has taken a lot of left turns throughout

1090
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:20.680
<v 5>the years.
That was one of the bigger ones.</v>

1091
01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.181
<v 9>All right,</v>

1092
01:05:23.181 --> 01:05:27.230
well you don't have to join the coast guard just to get away from your,

1093
01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:30.590
but maybe you do.
I don't know.
What does the Coast Guard do?

1094
01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:33.690
Their like the cops of the water,
right?
Okay.

1095
01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:36.980
<v 5>The zoo.</v>

1096
01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:41.570
I married everybody is when you thought she was the brains of the outfit.

1097
01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:46.610
We have a child,
but we're going to raise,
what is the coast guard?
Oh wait,

1098
01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.870
that's right.
Um,
aren't they like the cops of the water?

1099
01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:52.790
Hey,

1100
01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:56.180
do they get upset when there's like a tornado in a tornado or look how dumb I
am.

1101
01:05:56.181 --> 01:06:00.590
A fucking hurricane.
Hey,
settle down water.
That'll be enough of that.

1102
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:06.650
No,
they actually do a lot of bad ass shit.
But people,
they save people's lives.

1103
01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:09.290
They fly out there and fight all these fucking dopes.

1104
01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.350
But they are the cops of the water.
I mean,

1105
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:15.350
they would be insulted to hear me say that in a nicer way to say is they guard

1106
01:06:15.351 --> 01:06:19.850
the shores of this great country.
Can they,
oh,
that's nice.
Can they arrest?

1107
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:24.700
Oh,
so like fucking that guy from a Christian male.
Yeah.

1108
01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.210
Oh good.

1109
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:32.230
<v 9>Um,
do,
can they arrest you?
The coast guard?
Yes.</v>

1110
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:35.503
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1111
01:06:41.970 --> 01:06:45.480
<v 5>I would love to see you with a giant shipment of drugs and they pulled up.</v>

1112
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:49.530
Who are you guys?
Do you guys like have sex with each other?

1113
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:52.560
Oh,
you're the coast.
I'll wait.

1114
01:06:52.561 --> 01:06:55.870
You're like the cops of the water weight.

1115
01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:57.660
Can you arrest me?

1116
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:03.640
<v 9>I would pay him fucking mill all the money in the world just to see the look in</v>

1117
01:07:03.641 --> 01:07:06.660
their fucking face.
I know.
I'm insulting.

1118
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:09.440
So many coast guard members,
officers.

1119
01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:12.893
Wow.

1120
01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:18.680
<v 5>No,
no.
There's all different ranks.
I imagine this,
there's semen.</v>

1121
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:23.860
Keep your mind out of the gutter all the way up to officers,
his captains.

1122
01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:27.790
[inaudible] you want me?
Hey,
why don't we do this?
You know,
Nia,
when,
when,

1123
01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:32.680
when I don't know stuff.
I just ask the Internet and whoever made a page on it.

1124
01:07:32.681 --> 01:07:36.610
Then I just go,
oh,
that's what it is.
That's what it is.

1125
01:07:36.611 --> 01:07:40.000
Okay.
The coast guard.

1126
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:45.630
Let's get it.
Let's get a,
I gotta go Wiki on this,

1127
01:07:45.631 --> 01:07:48.990
so they'll actually help me out here.
All right.

1128
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.590
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1129
01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:53.380
<v 5>Okay.
The United States Coast Guard is a service,</v>

1130
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:57.370
a chief and highest ranking member.
Oh,
this is the commandant of the code.

1131
01:07:57.371 --> 01:07:58.600
The United States Coast Guard.
Sorry.

1132
01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.630
Your phone is vibrating over the United States.

1133
01:08:01.631 --> 01:08:06.160
Coast Guard is a branch of the United States armed forces and one of the

1134
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:10.880
countries.
Yeah,

1135
01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:15.800
you,
you,
you,
you can't save everything by saying the water.

1136
01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:21.140
Nia,
you've been watching the Kardashians show way too fucking much here.

1137
01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:27.950
All right,
Jesus.
All right.
Wait a second.

1138
01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:33.040
The coast guard is a maritime military multi-mission service unique among the u

1139
01:08:33.111 --> 01:08:37.490
s military branches for having maritime law enforcement's.

1140
01:08:37.491 --> 01:08:42.491
Can they arrest people with jurisdiction in both domestic and international

1141
01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:45.830
waters?
Now there's a big one I didn't know international,

1142
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:49.880
so you can't like outrun these fuckers and then just sit there and make faces at

1143
01:08:49.881 --> 01:08:53.510
him the second you get out in international waters.
I didn't know that.

1144
01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:55.100
And a federal regular.

1145
01:08:55.101 --> 01:08:58.280
I thought once you went out and entered a international waters,
it was captains,

1146
01:08:58.550 --> 01:09:01.730
captains,
law,
right.
Captain's log,
uh,

1147
01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:05.240
in a federal regulation and mission as part of the mission.
It's mission set.

1148
01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:08.780
It operates under the US Department of Homeland Security during peacetime and

1149
01:09:08.781 --> 01:09:11.060
can be transferred to the u s department of the Navy.

1150
01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:15.590
All right,
I'm going to stop.
No,
no,
see,
right.

1151
01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:17.930
So I didn't realize that they would then activated.

1152
01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:22.040
I thought they were like the sort of the farm team,

1153
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:27.560
like AAA of the navy.
I love the water.
Yes.

1154
01:09:29.790 --> 01:09:30.050
You know,

1155
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:32.120
there's a lot of people laughing at us right now and they didn't know that they

1156
01:09:32.121 --> 01:09:36.170
can be activated to the navy.
Um,
all right.

1157
01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:39.740
My point is,
I was just saying this has happened twice,

1158
01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:44.030
that they made part of the navy once in 1917 during world war one and another

1159
01:09:44.031 --> 01:09:46.940
time during World War II.
And that's obviously,
you know,

1160
01:09:46.941 --> 01:09:50.120
Pearl Harbor happened and then German u boats and I dunno what the fuck happened

1161
01:09:50.121 --> 01:09:54.260
in world war one where they're wooden ships off our coast.

1162
01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.620
Right?
No,
they weren't.
Wouldn't ships at that point,

1163
01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:03.020
although the fucking biplanes are made or like Kleenex I think.
All right.

1164
01:10:03.021 --> 01:10:08.020
I think that we've shown how dumb we are.
A blue,
a blue but,
but,
but,

1165
01:10:08.210 --> 01:10:12.740
but um,
all right.
That's the podcast.
Everybody,

1166
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:18.830

1172
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:44.480

So I don't know if that happens.
I don't know about that.

1173
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:46.280
Where is it?
It's an Arizona.

1174
01:10:46.281 --> 01:10:49.790
You want to fly to Arizona to do a podcast for free?

1175
01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.980
Hey,
how funny was it the other day?
I swear I'm not.

1176
01:11:00.981 --> 01:11:04.490
The other day when you are getting sad and you were starting to cry and I just

1177
01:11:04.491 --> 01:11:05.960
kept making that sad face,

1178
01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:08.990
which would then make you laugh and then you couldn't cry.

1179
01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.560
I hate when Nia Christ cause I don't know what to do.
I told you that story.

1180
01:11:12.561 --> 01:11:14.160
Big Tears.
Big Tears.
Right.
So

1181
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:16.103
<v 9>she was talking,</v>

1182
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.260
I didn't know what the fuck she was talking something about our kid.
Yeah,

1183
01:11:19.261 --> 01:11:23.100
you don't even know what it is and I'm talking about like you don't even care.

1184
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:26.490
You're just like make it stop.
Don't do that.

1185
01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:31.190
All I did was she just started tearing up.
She's like,
you know what,

1186
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.370
to talk to you about something.
I'm just worried in the future.

1187
01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.230
She started doing that and when she did that I just made this.

1188
01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:41.310
I just looked at me a little sad face and then she looked up and saw me and then

1189
01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:42.930
you just started fucking laughing.

1190
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:46.830
It was funny as you had tears in your eyes when you were laughing and then she

1191
01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.710
kept trying to go back to crying again.
No,
listen to me.

1192
01:11:49.711 --> 01:11:53.460
I'm just trying to stay and then I would make the sad face again.
Guys,

1193
01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:56.110
you got to do that to you woman next time she gets.
No,

1194
01:11:56.111 --> 01:12:00.650
they look at if it's something fucking serious.
He was,
you know,

1195
01:12:00.651 --> 01:12:05.290
it wasn't,
it was,
it was silly.
It was,

1196
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:08.790
I thought it was trivial,
not,
yeah,
exactly.
See,

1197
01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:11.250
not everyone is going to be as you know.

1198
01:12:11.251 --> 01:12:14.640
I thought it was trivial because it was coming down again.
Denim head.
Exactly.

1199
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:17.370
Exactly.
You don't even know when it was and I was concerned about,

1200
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:19.470
you're concerned about the cops of the water,

1201
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:26.520
eh?
You left at like you baked.
Wait a second.

1202
01:12:27.170 --> 01:12:29.340
So just the coast guard.

1203
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:36.450
The ship has sailed.
No Pun intended.
It's over.

1204
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:37.650
Maybe Cuba.

1205
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:44.250
All right,
fine.
No,
don't,
don't,

1206
01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:48.660
don't give someone the pouty face when they're coming to you crying about an

1207
01:12:48.661 --> 01:12:51.120
emotional issue that they're feeling.
That's a terrible,
all right.

1208
01:12:51.121 --> 01:12:53.930
Then tell me what you were concerned about.
I'll be a mature now.
Go ahead.

1209
01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:55.950
What were you concerned about?
Ah,

1210
01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.150
it was about you too.

1211
01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.770
It's a good move because it keeps you happy.
All right.
That's the podcast.

1212
01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:08.400
That's the podcast.
I know we have the creepy surveillance.

1213
01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:17.220
So you shot her with like a dart or something
facedown.

1214
01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:21.270
She's out.
It's like some discovery channel when you want to tag an animal.

1215
01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.550
Um,
all right,
that's the podcast for this,
uh,
Monday.
Uh,
go fuck yourselves.

1216
01:13:26.551 --> 01:13:29.490
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
Thank you to everybody.

1217
01:13:29.491 --> 01:13:33.930
Came out to the shows this weekend,
this weekend,
and Saint Petersburg and a,

1218
01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:35.550
I had a great time.
Once again out there.

1219
01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:41.150
A cigar capital of the u s Nini was fucking tremendous.

1220
01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:43.650
It was tremendous.
All right,
I'll see you guys.
