00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.920
Hey,
what's going on is bill,
it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:09.420
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and fucking pissed.

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.150
And I'm checking in on you.
God Damn,
Internet's not working.
I can't get,
I,

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.700
I swear to God,
I swear to God,
you know,

5
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.930
I want to go back to 1995 right before all of the laptops and all of that shit

6
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:29.100
came in,
didn't have a cell phone,
right?
Just walking around,

7
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.070
you know,
with my dad down to efficient whole,
but up up.
Uh,
but up,
up,
boop,
boop,

8
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:39.960
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop.
Like how long has this casino for?

9
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.020
Like fucking a week.
My phone wasn't ringing.
I couldn't figure it out.

10
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:45.540
I went on the Internet,
I found,
I looked for all of this shit.

11
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:49.590
Go into your settings,
click on this,
and I could never find fucking anything.

12
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:53.130
And I found out I somehow put it on do not disturb,

13
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.520
which involves swiping your screen up somehow.

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.420
And I'd have to hit a button and I,
you know what probably happened,
I probably,

15
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:04.800
I dunno what lifted my leg to tie my shoe while my phone was in my pocket.

16
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:08.310
And then there's that bullshit for the whole frigging week,
you know,

17
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.120
and the overall scope of global problems.
It's probably not that big before.

18
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:16.680
I'm sitting
on this spinning marvel that the God and Shit,

19
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:17.620
when people talk about,
wait,

20
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.450
what am I fucking asshole comes up to me and talks about some space thing that

21
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:26.451
they watched and how small insignificant the fucking earth is.

22
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.230
One more person tells me that shit.
I get it.

23
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.900
Space is big and we're small.
All right,

24
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.790
so what do you want to do,
Dee Dee Dee

25
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.810
getting kicked in the balls still hurts,
right?

26
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.310
So what's the point anyways?
The lovely Nia is he of Nia pickup on microphone.

27
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.920
All right.
Hey,
how are you?

28
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.840
You and I got into when

29
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.240
I can get it to you today from Amazon.
What?

30
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.070
The bar that you won't let me have,
you won't share with me.
I won't.

31
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.570
And it's an uneasy when you can't share with me.
I'm your wife.

32
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.970
Like why wouldn't you show that you don't share?
You just take,

33
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.670
I asked you if I could through no,

34
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.030
cause this is okay.
This is what happens whenever I go on a diet.
All right.

35
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.840
I start looking like go shredded red face over here.
She's like,
Ooh,

36
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:28.560
what are you doing?
Oh.
And then she fucking,
rather than getting on the Diet,

37
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.170
she just picks it all this shit that I bought.

38
00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:35.430
And you know when you're on a fucking diet you got it all mapped out for the

39
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.470
week.
So you don't have to think,
you know,

40
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.140
you can't wait until you're hungry cause then your body's going to be like,

41
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:44.100
go on a cheeseburger.
You're man and you got to do it in the handbag.
It,
no,

42
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.160
what did cheeseburger?
I want a chocolate shake.
You'll have nothing.
Um,

43
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.700
he says how it works for me.
So some meal prep,
I get it.
All right,
so,

44
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.200
which I just have a bar,
like we just came from a walk,
like why can't I have a,

45
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:03.201
a bar like to refuel to find and it was the last one.

46
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.960
And you just want to have one,

47
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:07.450
not because you're on the diet because it's convenient.

48
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.390
And then I'm going to come that tomorrow there's going to be an empty box.

49
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:14.760
So now I got to go online.
You're going to get me that tomorrow today.

50
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.340
Cause it's prime.
Yes.
And how much does that cost?

51
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.560
49 for the box.
But here's the thing,
Nia,

52
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.790
the thing,
if I didn't make such a fucking stink about this,

53
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.750
I don't know why you had to make a distinct period,
but like it's my last one.

54
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.180
Yeah.
And I,
it's hard to find.
Okay,
let me see if I can buy.
Hey,

55
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.530
I can get some for you.
That'll be delivered today.
Can I have one now?

56
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.730
You're telling me that that would have worked?
Yeah,
you're full of shit.

57
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.640
We'll never know because you'll always pop off.
So who knows what'll pop off?

58
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.140
I'm white.
Flip out.

59
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.150
No,
that's plenty.
Thank you.

60
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.480
Every once in a while I do have a good one.
No,

61
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.630
the same thing I've learned about you,

62
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.060
which I then translate to implementing it and I'm pointing right at you,

63
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.830
which I then of course transfer to all fucking women because that's how simple

64
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:15.664
my brain is,

65
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.510
is you have to make a fucking scene for you guys to finally do the right thing.

66
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.860
That's what it is.
Cause you might cause she,

67
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.580
you aren't just dramatic and like overly,

68
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.740
what's the word I'm looking for?
I Dunno,

69
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.080
overly interrupting me every time I go to make a point.

70
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:33.340
That's the second time you've done it.

71
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.630
One more time and I'll tell you your Audi and I'm out of the ballgame.

72
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.450
Yeah,
you're going to do that.
Can I know woo woo.
You can stack like this,

73
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:46.390
a little pound puppy and then I'm going to give it to you and you're going to

74
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.710
say that you're going to fucking do it.

75
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.860
You're going to say that there's going to be followed through like this fucking

76
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:55.060
autumn and over here that has a stuffing coming out of it and left a message.

77
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.340
He was supposed to take care of that like three fucking months ago.
Okay.

78
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.800
All those little balls are coming out.
We got a kid around here.

79
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:04.720
I don't want you to start to eat.
I'm thinking that they're,

80
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.030
they're the little things.
A fucking cous cous or something.

81
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.890
But she knows what that is.
So this,
this leaky fucking piece of shit that,

82
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:15.370
I don't know where you got it from.
West Elm.
West Elm.
So how much was that?

83
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.400
A zillion dollars right now.
It was like 45 bucks or something.
All right.

84
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.870
Well then throw it out.
I don't know what to tell.

85
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:28.660
You can just leave it leaking all over the place.

86
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.590
All you gotta do just find some fucking no,
cause this is what it is.

87
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:36.340
And you know,
I have to take care of all of this shit.

88
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.270
That's why you don't get a fucking power bar because she wouldn't have done it.

89
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.030
You would've said you were going to do it and then you wouldn't have done it.

90
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.210
And the amount of time would have taken me to figure out the fucking Internet

91
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.050
and how to get some fucking look at me.
So fucking,
uh,
what a,

92
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.950
this dress.
I'm like,
now I'm going of dress like fucking Hitler.

93
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:58.300
Youth with the lumberjack must beard and mustache.
Right?
The Conor Mcgregor,

94
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.470
but like Zach Galifianakis.
Okay,
beard.
Who was the originator?

95
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.790
They all owe him money.
He brought them back.
The Martin van Buren beard.

96
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.750
Um,
he's like the Eddie van Halen,
right?

97
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.700
You're throwing out the names of a lot of white guys.

98
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.560
Inhaling up the beard and the loss and all these surfaces that came along where

99
00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:21.580
all those guys that ripped off Eddie van Halen.
Oh,
speaking of that,

100
00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:24.690
the next season of baskets is coming out with Lou.
You had to sit there.

101
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.460
I love that show.
Anyway,
that's why.
That's why you don't get,

102
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.800
you don't get a,
you know what's so funny about Uni,
right?

103
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.960
Is I'm trying to communicate with you and you're on your phone.

104
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.440
I'm on Amazon ordering the Goddamn thing for you,
and I said,
well,

105
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.920
you're not going to happen.
My fucking freckled arbs.

106
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.890
This is what I have to do.
This is why you actually don't.

107
00:06:49.891 --> 00:06:54.120
You actually don't have to have this reaction.
Okay?

108
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.280
Okay,
let's do a little role play.
All right.
I'm going to be you.
Oh,

109
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.530
I'm going to be you.
Wow.
Okay.
Okay.

110
00:07:01.531 --> 00:07:04.970
And then you can be me and you tell me how to do it.
Okay.
Oh,
what am I,

111
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.440
where are we talking?
We're talking about what the fuck just happened.

112
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.700
So I'm you and you're okay.
Here we go.

113
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.070
Well,
you have I tonight

114
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.250
I object to this and let me like,
he was just going to be worse.

115
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.480
It's what you like and you have something.
I want something.

116
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.490
I'm a fucking five year old.
Can I hit it?

117
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.510
<v 2>I have to take care of it three months ago.
Wow.</v>

118
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.083
Fair enough.

119
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.540
I busted my ass on the road every weekend so we can afford this fucking house.

120
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.220
<v 0>That's a good point.
Are there care was always an unflattering impression.</v>

121
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.920
I agree with you.
A version of me.

122
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.510
Every time you talk like that,
I swear to God,

123
00:08:07.511 --> 00:08:12.511
like part of my soul to Blake's off that I know that's what you do.

124
00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:17.860
Do I have gone why?
By the time it goes into my head,

125
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.500
God with my fucking childhood and all my experiences,

126
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.620
or you need an eye processing.
Oh God.
So it's,
you know,

127
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.070
you've got a guy every excuse in the book while I was popping off and you know

128
00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:30.940
what,
slipping out,
whatever,
whatever.

129
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.390
And it's just like you don't have a point right now.

130
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.390
I just saw that you started that searching for word.

131
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:41.500
You've got every thing and it's just like,
hey man,

132
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.500
that would be more of this bandage and this Sunday that way saying I need to be

133
00:08:47.501 --> 00:08:51.340
out.
That was three quarters,
three quarters of a fucking point.

134
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.100
You just made that cause you know man,
it's like shit is crazy.

135
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.720
Need to do there and start the the,
the lady fake crying.

136
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:03.020
I hope you know that your shit is coming today and look what I had to do.

137
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.840
But how high my blood pressure had to go off and didn't have to do all that.

138
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:10.650
I could have figured it out for you if you were nicer to me if you were like,

139
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.710
you know what?
This is,
it's role play.
Let's role play.
Let's start over again.

140
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.280
And this time rather than insulting each other rather than insulting each other

141
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:19.730
from the essay that you had,
goddammit.
To supply points.

142
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.570
I'll take your fucking purple sock off right now.

143
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.150
You could have said it's my last one and I,
okay.

144
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.790
The way I would have liked you to do it,
we're going to do this.

145
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.330
We're going to finish this fucking thing.
Okay.
All right.
I'm going to be you.

146
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:38.220
I want to try to do a flattering version of you.
Okay?
Go ahead.

147
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.030
Can I have
you?
Oh,

148
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.650
it's my son.
Yeah,
I can

149
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.880
see you can't do it.
No Kid.
Uh,
alright.
Do,
what did you tell me?
How?

150
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.570
Tell you tell me.
You tell me.

151
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.530
I wasn't really told me how the fuck I'm supposed to do that.

152
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.470
You weren't supposed to say I only have one lot and they're really hard to find.

153
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.880
And I said,
okay.
So
that's what you would've said.

154
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.951
I would've been like,
well,

155
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:17.280
let me see if they have any online on Amazon like I did just now.

156
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.590
Like it's literally coming before the end of the day.

157
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.690
Chocolate bar is more important than me.
I'm just saying.

158
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:28.870
I think your reaction was a little over the top and unwarranted.
It wasn't,

159
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.430
I stayed calm.
I stayed calm and as you said,
can I have a chocolate bar?
What?

160
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:36.920
I said,
no.
I said,
no.
Yeah,

161
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.240
and you can put the thing and you're like,
I can't.
And I said No.
He said,
why?

162
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:44.130
I go because they're mine.
I'm on this diet.

163
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.800
I kind of said that you okay,
but it's your tone and it's your approach.

164
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:54.030
You often saying from Massachusetts,
I always sound like I'm in a bad mood now.

165
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:55.230
Not as not true.

166
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:58.260
All my family's from Massachusetts and they don't always sound like they're in a

167
00:10:58.261 --> 00:10:58.771
bad mood.

168
00:10:58.771 --> 00:11:03.290
So that's a bullshit excuse my white people from Massachusetts.

169
00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:04.740
So we sound like the right and that's fair.

170
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.930
It's okay to blame a race when we return more hate speech from Nia hill.

171
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.390
We're doing an episode.
We did an episode of crushing.
Yes.

172
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:19.590
We want to share before anybody asks.
No,
that's not our baby.
Okay.

173
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.670
People have already asked me,
this is how Hollywood works.
Okay.

174
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.420
You can't have a baby on set.
Do you have to have twins?

175
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.940
Because they're only allowed to work in three hour shifts.
Right?

176
00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:32.380
So you need to one,
Z,

177
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.500
two Z EBA and baby B as they call all.
Other than that,

178
00:11:36.501 --> 00:11:39.840
I have that story that I told the time I did that acting Gig when I was working

179
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:43.470
with the baby and one baby was catatonic and the other one was flipping out.

180
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:48.360
We'll say one's name was Bob,
the other was bill.
Bill was catatonic.
Right.

181
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.870
So we use him for three frigging hours during rehearsal.

182
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.090
Now we're going to switch to the,
but the maniac won't

183
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:54.691
<v 3>stop crying.</v>

184
00:11:54.691 --> 00:11:58.860
So the guy switches the names right in front of me and starts calling the baby

185
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:03.150
Phil who already worked,
starts calling him Bob.
Nothing weeks of me.

186
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.200
And now it's like I'm driving the getaway car.
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

187
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.140
So of course by the time we live,

188
00:12:10.141 --> 00:12:14.190
audience gets loaded in the old catatonic is six hours id.

189
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.680
Yeah,
he needs,
he needs a drink.
Can feel that.
Yeah.

190
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.480
So the fucking thing was crying his ass off and right before I walked through

191
00:12:21.481 --> 00:12:22.980
the fake door to do the scene,

192
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.870
he took like a giant yellow like sugar corn pop and with his thumb pushed it to

193
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.160
things mouth and I walked out and I walked up.
They was like

194
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:36.170
<v 0>spit it out.
Yeah.
Okay.</v>

195
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.140
<v 3>If I was a feminist that would have been enough to make me quit the business.</v>

196
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.350
<v 0>Ho,
Ho,
Ho,
Ho,
Ho,
Ho,
Ho Ho Ho.</v>

197
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.960
You know what BV Tom's.

198
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:52.360
The homes are bullshit Hashtag me too.
Um,

199
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.240
but yes,
we did an episode of crashing airs this Sunday.

200
00:12:56.241 --> 00:13:00.960
I'm very excited to see it.
Um,
yeah.

201
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:05.610
Yeah.
Wait,
promotion.
This is me for money

202
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.920
<v 3>and it's entertaining.
I was actually one of the most fun acting gigs I've had.</v>

203
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.750
I took great acting gigs last year.
Right.

204
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.370
<v 0>You're,
you're,
I'm really,
exactly.
Obviously you're in it more than I am.
Like wow,</v>

205
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.330
<v 3>we're both self involved.
So you're really excited about your scenes.</v>

206
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.230
<v 0>I seen they got it done.</v>

207
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:26.400
They cut two of my three seasons down or you'll be on the DVD.

208
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:32.010
Is that how it works?
Laser disk or something.
I know now.
Well anyway,

209
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:36.480
Pete Holmes was kind enough to give me the heads up that they were seeing that

210
00:13:36.481 --> 00:13:41.220
they had to cut for time purposes.
And I understood even though they were really,

211
00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:42.240
really,
really,
really,

212
00:13:42.241 --> 00:13:45.780
really great scenes between me and Pete and then me and Pete and one other

213
00:13:45.781 --> 00:13:50.460
person.
This isn't the way you promote a show.
You talk about what's there.
Yeah.

214
00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:53.970
Well what's,
there is a fabulous as well.

215
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.950
Chaises and I can't wait.
What are you behaving about this?

216
00:13:57.951 --> 00:13:58.790
You tell me you would've,

217
00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.650
we would've ordered these fucking chocolate bars unless like flipped out.

218
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.370
I would have helped you if you had asked in the polite way.

219
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.560
That's my philosophy arguments sentence at the end of it was young man.

220
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.180
If you would ask me in a polite way.
Young man.
No,
I'm excited for,

221
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.780
uh,
for,
for crashing.
Shout out to Pete Holmes,

222
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.640
Greg Fitzsimmons

223
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.420
and uh,

224
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:34.000
the always loved Snelling who was there on set,

225
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.980
but a Judd Apatow.
Absolutely.
Ah,
the director's name.

226
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.840
I can't remember cause I'm a jerk.

227
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:44.870
But he was so nice and they just made me feel so comfortable and it was great.

228
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.380
It was really fun show which works guys.
Check it out man.

229
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.280
Tweet me about it man.
It's going to be on this Sunday.

230
00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:57.780
It was fun already lags in it.
Uh,
Joe Bay.
Maybe.

231
00:14:57.781 --> 00:15:01.440
Am I supposed to say all this shit but it's uh,
it was fun.
[inaudible] Lord.

232
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.930
I know,
I know.
I'm really see various joy.

233
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.680
Joy was fucking hilarious.
Um,

234
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.520
I'm excited to see that scene that you're talking about.
Um,
no,

235
00:15:12.521 --> 00:15:15.460
it felt like we were doing like a talk show.
Yeah,
it was great.
Yeah,

236
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.001
that's the thing.

237
00:15:16.001 --> 00:15:19.690
They really let you kind of Improv and just kind of feel your way through the

238
00:15:19.691 --> 00:15:22.990
scenes with guidelines of course.
But I appreciate that,
you know,

239
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.020
cause it just gives you a chance to have a little creative freedom.

240
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.900
What I wish that you would do some Improv and get that that frigging autumn and

241
00:15:30.901 --> 00:15:34.210
like resewed can we just can,
you can't be telling me out here.

242
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.010
Like you can't find someone in the valley.

243
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.790
It's all we do are of course all upholstery.
It's upholstery in porn.

244
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.220
Tired.
Valid.
It's a couple of smart people value the idea again,

245
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.950
see what industry is born.
Oh street doesn't your only option.

246
00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:57.250
Car Washes were places.
I love the valley may too.

247
00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.330
I like,
I like it.
I like it a lot.
I like it.
I like it a lot.

248
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.270
So what are we doing here?
It's Thursday.
Like what's happening?

249
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.080
What are we talking about?
What's going on?
It's going on a worldwide.

250
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.430
I don't know what's going on the world cause I don't have,

251
00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.200
I don't have the fucking internet anymore and I don't know what channel the news

252
00:16:11.201 --> 00:16:15.190
channels are cause I don't watch them.
Ooh,
I don't,

253
00:16:15.191 --> 00:16:18.370
why aren't you just a rebel?
I'm not a rebel.
I'm uninformed.

254
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.560
I didn't mean like how'd that podcast with Joe de Rosa and so I did not inform

255
00:16:24.821 --> 00:16:27.010
no reading,
no research,
just strong opinions.

256
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.790
I do remember the early days of podcasting.
Was that a podcast?

257
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.320
It's not a podcast and I had already been doing my podcast.

258
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:39.040
Have you talked about how you first started doing podcasting?
Like,

259
00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:43.810
what does that story,
did someone say,
hey,
hey there young man,
you know,

260
00:16:43.811 --> 00:16:47.080
the needle or one of my retiring and this,
this,
this,
this is the last phrase.

261
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:53.100
It's called podcasts.
Like what's that blog?
Yes.
No,

262
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.220
I've told the story of Bobby Kelly.
I was like,
hey mister,
how was it?

263
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:59.100
I was over his,
uh,
apartment anyway,

264
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.830
and I was like,
what's a project?

265
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.213
<v 4>Because it's</v>

266
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.040
<v 0>all right.
You called the number,
you called some little hotlines,
Samsung Gig.</v>

267
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.040
You know what's funny is Bob doesn't even remotely talk like that,

268
00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:23.570
but the impression I got more and more exact layer.
PUCCI did it first.

269
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:29.120
Who was Larry wrote,
g Larry when Pooch Pooch Gucci.
Great Comedian,
Boston guy.

270
00:17:29.121 --> 00:17:33.740
And he was just,
he just would kind of be like,
Hey Mary,
can you kind of,

271
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.850
I don't even know how to do it,
but he,
he,
he,
it was great and impression.

272
00:17:36.851 --> 00:17:40.220
So then we did an impression of his impression and then it just kept getting

273
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:44.660
more and more exaggerated.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He sounds nothing like that,
but it's fun.

274
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:49.710
It's fun.
You walk into the room and everybody just goes,
alright,

275
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.850
but you used to call a phone number.
I'd call in and I would drive around.

276
00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:57.180
I'd be in the airport and I make fun of fat people and all this stuff you used

277
00:17:57.181 --> 00:17:59.520
to be able to do before everybody got all sensitive.

278
00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.930
Say you call and you can still kick a ginger but you can't make fun of a fatty

279
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.380
when we return,
but it wouldn't be like at the tone,

280
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.090
please leave your broadcasts.

281
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:12.840
I forget how you did it.

282
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.390
You called up the number and then you punched in your code.

283
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.330
I mean they exist somewhere.

284
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.190
I used to have that picture on my podcast page me with my flip phone,
which was,

285
00:18:23.191 --> 00:18:27.940
oh so cool.
Flip phone was the shit.
2006 Simon,

286
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.400
one of the first iPhone came out and Jim Norton and Bobby,

287
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.120
they all got them and they fucking hated them.

288
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.730
Like everything on it was amazing except the phone part Ram and then they,

289
00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:45.930
then they made the unholy matrimony with Verizon and then they just,

290
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.790
they took over everything.
Like sprint was a viable option back then.

291
00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.870
And with that.
Yeah.
I mean,
people still have sprint.

292
00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:00.210
He's talking about look at these fucking Internet in nothing.
Had nothing.

293
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:02.520
I'm going to sit here all fucking day.

294
00:19:02.521 --> 00:19:05.340
Wait for this to stupid fucking thing to load.

295
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.920
Then I got to have some nerd come over here.
You know what I miss?

296
00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:12.480
I miss the Geek squad before best buy bought it and ruined it and act like they

297
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:16.170
was still the geek squad.
It's like no your best buy,
right?

298
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.500
Yeah.
I know that

299
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:27.300
we can reset the um,
the router.
It'd be like,

300
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.850
yeah.
Does that make it work?
I guess?
Yes.

301
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.290
You hit the Brian and I literally have to go into your room.
I have to hit pause.

302
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:44.220
I have to walk into the other room so this fucking page will load.
Hang on.

303
00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:49.780
All right,
I'm back.
Uh,
Internet just not working at all on the house.
Just be,

304
00:19:49.781 --> 00:19:51.540
they won't be able to upload the fucking podcast.

305
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:53.970
So I don't know when that was going to come out.
Uh,

306
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.470
finally gone to Google News on my,
on my phone.
Yeah.
There you go.

307
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:02.690
Who needs a laptop when you got a phone.
All right,
Google cancels,
$30 million,

308
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.830
civilian moon mission price.

309
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.580
They're going to just send some regular person to the fucking moon.

310
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:14.310
I would have donated to that sense of jerk off up there and watch them freak out

311
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.110
again.
You want to space and all you're going to be on this podcast.
He said,
yes,

312
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.330
I will.
Look at your phone.
What he you don't?

313
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.250
He's still ordering chocolate bars over there flailing the,

314
00:20:23.251 --> 00:20:26.280
I don't have the Internet.
It's like somebody shut off my lights

315
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.930
so I have a question.
Just see any good movies lately now?
Yes.

316
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.760
Ladybird I started watching that and I fell asleep.
It get out.

317
00:20:38.761 --> 00:20:43.290
Doesn't win every single fucking Oscar that they've been nominated for like I'm

318
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:44.124
done.

319
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:48.340
Why can't every single every single fucking Oscar?

320
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.300
Well everyone that it's been nominated for it.
Yeah,

321
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.940
I mean my mom think you've slightly biased.
It should definitely,

322
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.370
you should definitely want directive without a doubt.

323
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:05.140
And I think that kid should win.
Right,
and then what else?

324
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:09.410
Costumes.
No,
let's,
every single Oscar and I'm talking about everything.
Yeah,

325
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.880
this is a slippery slope.
I'm start talking about a war.

326
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.950
Everyone that they were nominated for,

327
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.770
I can't tell you something you which by the way,

328
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:21.960
I did all the categories that I predicted that they would be nominated for him.

329
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.170
Oh,
you did?
So I'm glad I was.
So you see things?

330
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.950
Yeah.
Okay.
I see things and see,

331
00:21:28.951 --> 00:21:33.910
even with Google dangling millions of dollars in prize money.
It was a moonshot.

332
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.060
No one could land to get it.
Oh Jesus.

333
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:41.710
I don't think people in this effort in the press get away with these pumps.

334
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:47.170
There was a moonshot pause.
No one could land more than a decade.

335
00:21:47.171 --> 00:21:50.830
Would you get off the Internet?
I need your comedic brain here.
Oh,
sorry.

336
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.390
Oh yeah.

337
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.670
I was going through my Twitter to look at news and I thought might be

338
00:21:57.671 --> 00:21:59.050
interesting to throw into the

339
00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.980
fucking worst liar ever more than a decade after Google announced it would ward

340
00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:13.111
$30 million to the first company that could launch to the moon by March,

341
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.360
2018 the company has officially canceled the prize.

342
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.900
Who the fuck would waste their time doing that?

343
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:27.370
You can give me $30 million to special fucking $1 billion to get somebody to the

344
00:22:27.371 --> 00:22:28.204
moon.

345
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.260
I'll give you 20 bucks if you build me a house.

346
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.260
Thanks to me to the moon.

347
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:43.030
The reason none of the five finalists,
we're on track to meet the fast approach.

348
00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.740
The reason none of the five finalists,

349
00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:49.420
we're on track to meet the fast approaching deadlines.
A while.

350
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.160
While we did expect a widow by doubt due to the difficulties of fundraising,

351
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.700
technical and regulatory challenges,
the grant,
but nobody gives a shit.

352
00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.460
Wait a minute.
Is this what you do on their sayings?

353
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:03.500
He just like read news stories or
no,

354
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.010
you'd be like Rehab.
I you see read advertising.

355
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:08.780
I usually have spells Asia had the internet and I have stuff that I can look at

356
00:23:08.781 --> 00:23:12.880
to start to talk about and riff on.
Why don't you look at your,

357
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.290
uh,
none of that isn't an ed at the little momentum.
I just had.

358
00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:22.110
You just literally stepped on.
I'm sorry.
Keep going.

359
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.340
Yeah.
There was so many.
There was so many angles you could have gone.

360
00:23:24.341 --> 00:23:27.110
This is some white shit.
You ain't ever going to,

361
00:23:27.111 --> 00:23:30.370
you never get to see black astronaut,
you know,
fucking def jam shit.

362
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.030
I don't personally,
white table likely after got out of the mode.

363
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:40.420
Do you want to go to the moon?
Like would you ever want to go to space?

364
00:23:40.421 --> 00:23:45.290
That's so many.
I don't want to go to the beach.
I'm terrified of the beach.

365
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:50.060
I would never want to go into space ever.
Ever in my life.

366
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.060
I never want to leave this.
No,
because I'm afraid of being alive.

367
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:58.850
I don't want to burn it,
but it's such,
I know like safe or whatever now,

368
00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:02.990
but I'm just not,
I dunno.
I was traumatized by the challenge.
Like I'm done.

369
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.470
I'm like,
wait,
where did you read that?
It's safe now.
I Dunno.

370
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.210
So people go up there all the time,
you know,
I don't want to have,

371
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:19.170
I don't want to have a Sandra Bullock,
you know,
in outer space situation,

372
00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:21.600
like all alone,
you know,

373
00:24:21.601 --> 00:24:25.050
George Clooney's voice and then he's not there anymore,
you know?

374
00:24:25.051 --> 00:24:28.530
And he was content to just float off into space.
Nonchalant.
He was,

375
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.890
he was so nonchalant about it.
He was just like,
hey man.
Oh yeah,
hey,

376
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:35.250
is that the Serengeti?
He's like,
I don't have anything going on down there,

377
00:24:35.251 --> 00:24:39.270
but you do.
You do man,
and I need you to fight.
Oh,
see,
let me just sort of,

378
00:24:39.271 --> 00:24:42.900
let's go.
Like,
dude,
if you have a floating off into space like that,
you'd be like

379
00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:49.980
making one hero noise.
Right?
So I'm,
I'm definitely afraid of space.

380
00:24:49.981 --> 00:24:53.340
I think it's amazing,
but I have no interest in going in.
Is that,

381
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.250
what was that thing you don't do?
The Med guy did the red bull jump,

382
00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.330
you know what?
He was basically jumping from space.

383
00:25:00.331 --> 00:25:04.140
Do you know if the shield is one of his little face mass there?

384
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:09.510
If that broke his face would melt off within two seconds to saliva in his mouth

385
00:25:09.961 --> 00:25:14.110
would have reached boiling point.
Oh my God.
Is that true?
Yes.

386
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:18.150
I Dunno.
I read it.
I don't know why anyone would go to space.

387
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.220
I don't know how to talk to women,

388
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.690
but I appreciate those who do they need a good story to space?

389
00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.140
No.
All those scientists and astronauts and things,

390
00:25:28.141 --> 00:25:31.110
they're doing good work up there,
but I'm not interested in doing it.

391
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:32.890
And yet you have no idea what they're doing.

392
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:38.790
Just you're speaking and fucking,
is it a hyperbole?
Is that they're up there.

393
00:25:38.791 --> 00:25:39.890
They're doing good work.
Yeah.

394
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.900
Talk about some of the good work the astronauts are doing up there.

395
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.510
<v 2>You know that they're researching that state</v>

396
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.090
running spirit

397
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.270
<v 0>or I don't want to be like Sam Rockwell's character and mood does it all by</v>

398
00:25:56.271 --> 00:26:00.620
herself going crazy.
Like,
and that was a fucking grant movie was amazing.

399
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:05.770
Shout out to Sam Rockwell getting nominated for an Oscar.
Yay.
Yeah,

400
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.620
this her family.

401
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.480
I love when he was sitting there and that one scene where he just looks over,

402
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:13.160
he goes,
who's that guy?
Yeah.
That's probably,
I don't want to ruin it.

403
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.040
I didn't want to,
yeah.
Do you get,
you got to see movie.

404
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.200
If you haven't seen the moon,
you know all you people lined up to six star.

405
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:23.010
Once you,
if you're making a major error,
I want to go see moon.
They can see.

406
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:27.860
But yeah,
I dunno why I shouldn't state,
you know why it's just,
it's fun to do.

407
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.190
It's,
I trashed feminists because anything that's like take it so seriously.

408
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:36.140
You have to shit on a lie.
You have a classic comedian brain.

409
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:40.510
You can't just like be nice about something like good for them and then standing

410
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.320
up for what they believe and I think that's great.

411
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:47.070
You just have to shit on it like you and positivity or just like something that

412
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:49.920
a lot,
I don't know.
I don't get to take it all the way to his positivity.

413
00:26:49.921 --> 00:26:51.660
You guys just don't Mesh.

414
00:26:51.661 --> 00:26:55.770
Like you just refuse to allow positivity into your life.

415
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.740
You're just don't think it's funny and oh it's just you have to break the

416
00:26:58.741 --> 00:27:03.430
tension of somebody telling us storage what sedges someone sharing their story

417
00:27:03.431 --> 00:27:04.800
of why is it tense for you?

418
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.450
You just can't deal if the attention is not on you so you have to turn it around

419
00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:13.110
and make a joke and like make fun with everything up until then.

420
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:17.460
Okay attention on me when I'm on stage off stage,

421
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.760
I'm not a fucking lampshade on my head Guy am I?
No,
you're not.

422
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.160
Don't try to take over fucking conversations at parties.

423
00:27:23.161 --> 00:27:25.500
I usually am standing at the wall and you're like,

424
00:27:25.501 --> 00:27:29.500
if everything okay are you're having a good time,
the arresting bitch face.

425
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.130
And I'm like,

426
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.330
you do have resting bitch face bow.

427
00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.810
It's handsome but it's a bitchy.

428
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:49.290
I know I'm not good at parties.
Did he like the dance?

429
00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.230
I'm like,
I don't know.
Like Ooh,

430
00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:01.560
heightened energy.
I am energy bothers you.
Yeah.
Know

431
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:08.600
celebratory vibes.
Relaxed people getting along.
No,

432
00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.150
not relaxed.
Not relaxed.

433
00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.780
It's like the heightened,
like when people say

434
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:22.250
doing that or when they're clapping applauding somebody who's saying what they

435
00:28:22.251 --> 00:28:25.250
did was brave and there was no guns involved.

436
00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.180
There was no life or death situation.
But you know,

437
00:28:28.181 --> 00:28:32.000
it's just sort of your only definition of bravery.
Yeah.

438
00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.130
Like I think it has to be like,
you know,

439
00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:42.290
they used to be a good for you slap on the back.
That is now brave.

440
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:47.090
Hey,
this kid,
I,
he fucking,
you know,
he punched me in the face.
I punched him back.

441
00:28:47.091 --> 00:28:49.590
Oh good for you.
Now it's all that was so brave.

442
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.340
The way you stuck up to that bullied no window.

443
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:56.820
No.
Well,

444
00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:00.000
what happened now as he gets punched in the face and then he makes a video that

445
00:29:00.001 --> 00:29:02.380
goes viral about that,
but you know,
I've been,

446
00:29:02.381 --> 00:29:05.710
the bully makes one and cries and then they delve into that fucking thing.

447
00:29:05.711 --> 00:29:09.580
And meanwhile there's a swirl of trash two miles deep.
Twice,

448
00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:12.940
two and a half times the size of fucking Texas out there,

449
00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.140
out in the Pacific Ocean number,
the first tooth brush you have a fucking used.

450
00:29:16.141 --> 00:29:19.090
It's in there swirling around.
Did you see that story about,

451
00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:24.070
I forgot where this fish was.
Costa Rica maybe,
but they caught a fish.
Um,

452
00:29:24.071 --> 00:29:24.251
you know,

453
00:29:24.251 --> 00:29:28.030
they were fishing and I guess this guy saw one fish and he thought it looks sick

454
00:29:28.031 --> 00:29:28.864
and just weird.

455
00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.710
So he cut it open and there was all this garbage and sign of the fish.
Yeah,

456
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.210
I was pretty depressing.
It's horrifying.

457
00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:42.130
And everybody's walking around calling everybody I like and enjoy life

458
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.990
<v 2>and bill here to let you know</v>

459
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.080
what.
That's my face.

460
00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.230
I want to bring you back down to earth cause that's what I do.

461
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.590
Build Bird Truth Speaker about what?

462
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.340
Osei or killer killer life.

463
00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:02.960
Ruiner Jesus Christ.

464
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.580
Do you really think I'm that bad?
Huh?

465
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.033
<v 0>Huh?</v>

466
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:13.940
<v 2>You and your dark
get my rainbow.</v>

467
00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.630
No,
I'm just kidding,
Lord.

468
00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:21.970
<v 0>Yeah.
I don't know Nigga.</v>

469
00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.270
How the fuck can you see something like that and then watch some fucking act of

470
00:30:25.271 --> 00:30:29.270
being called brave because they didn't wear makeup in a movie.
Yeah,
no,
of course.

471
00:30:29.271 --> 00:30:30.990
The perspective is like,
yeah,

472
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.010
we're all going to wear all black tonight and like nobody thinks about,
hey,

473
00:30:34.011 --> 00:30:35.270
who sold that shit together?

474
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:40.310
There's some fucking little kid and like El Salvador,
he was all blacks.
Right?

475
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:42.170
Let's fucking beaten him with the other yard

476
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.460
and everybody's Oh,
high five and about what great people they are.
Wow.

477
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.160
It's just funny.
That's all I'm doing here.
Okay.
That's all it is.

478
00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.850
I look at TV and I shit on everything that I see.
It makes me laugh.

479
00:30:55.851 --> 00:30:59.060
That's how I do it.
I bet.
Probably dysfunctional.

480
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.750
I've been doing really well this year.

481
00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.990
You've watched reality TV and I don't shit on it.
Right.

482
00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:10.010
I just sit there oddly quiet and I feel you looking out of the corner of your

483
00:31:10.011 --> 00:31:13.940
eye.
Like why isn't he saying anything?
Well,

484
00:31:13.941 --> 00:31:17.720
I appreciate you being able to let me enjoy my life and peace.

485
00:31:17.721 --> 00:31:21.720
I know it's hard for you,
but uh,
cause nothing is more important than the lap.

486
00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:27.080
Um,
you're really just feeling yourself right now.
I'm on,

487
00:31:27.081 --> 00:31:30.350
now I'm awake now I'm going to,
okay,
let's do two more hours.

488
00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.190
Why can't I have to get the fuck out of here?
But I also,

489
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:36.390
I have to go for it.

490
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.440
Yeah,
no,
this is one of these classic things with I was younger,

491
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:50.040
I would bring up all the shit that you do and what it's like to live with you.

492
00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:53.070
But I am,
I am an older,
wiser man and I know that there,

493
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.610
there is no fucking real estate to be gained in that.

494
00:31:56.611 --> 00:31:59.690
So I'm just going to sit here in the pocket and just be like,
okay.
Yeah,

495
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.040
I am the Gospel to live with.
I have a question.

496
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.170
Would you like to go to Paris again?
He spoiled Brat.
Um,

497
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.150
why don't I get it?
Is that a headphones?

498
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:15.220
How come you're the only one that gets 10 phones?
Aspire has 99% of the time.

499
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.950
I fucking do it by myself.
You have head phones.

500
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:21.490
You could go out and buy a little Jackie could fucking plug it in and you'd be

501
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:25.340
fine.
Plug it in,
plug it in.
Okay.

502
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.140
How many times I've gone on somebody else's podcast?
I didn't get headphones.

503
00:32:29.141 --> 00:32:33.040
I never went like,
why do you have stuff?
Do you want these headphones?

504
00:32:33.041 --> 00:32:34.390
You could order some more headphones.

505
00:32:34.391 --> 00:32:39.360
It'll get here in time with the chocolate bars now.
That's okay.
I'm fine.
Thanks.

506
00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:46.970
All right.
This has been bill getting trashed by his lovely wife.
No,
it's great.

507
00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:52.720
You enjoy it then.
I did look at peanut.
Huh?
Why?

508
00:32:52.721 --> 00:32:57.721
I like to say that I was a good sport about it just because it was the

509
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.770
microphones and rotten.
But in about three seconds

510
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:07.220
he says it'd be shut off if you'd think I was a tyrant tyrant before I'm

511
00:33:07.221 --> 00:33:09.170
supposed to reach some sort of advertising.
I don't have it,

512
00:33:09.171 --> 00:33:12.170
so I guess these people will live.
So me doing it on my cell phone at some point.

513
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.610
All right.
That's it.
Enjoy your weekend.
You conch and uh,
I'll check in on your,

514
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:21.611
on Monday please watch this week's episode of a crashing on Hbo.

515
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.360
Yup.
And anyways,
all of that stuff.

516
00:33:26.361 --> 00:33:31.361
It's going to be on a Sunday night on HBO and I'm sure it'll be streaming

517
00:33:31.821 --> 00:33:35.990
everybody's streams now and I can check it out then.
Please check it out.

518
00:33:35.991 --> 00:33:38.570
I had such a great time and it was so much fun,
you know,

519
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.190
get to act with you again.
Yeah.
Awesome.
That was good.

520
00:33:42.191 --> 00:33:45.230
As a nice positive experience.
Yeah,
it was.
It was,
it was,
wasn't it?

521
00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:50.180
I was in the middle of it.
Yes.
It's very positive.
What was the other,

522
00:33:50.181 --> 00:33:54.770
the first time we ever acted together?
Oh my gosh.
I remember this.

523
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:59.690
A failed pilot.
Your pilot?
Yeah,
the bill burr projects,
the untitled bill,

524
00:33:59.691 --> 00:34:00.590
whatever it was,

525
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:05.270
but we had a whole huge negative cause I thought about the first time you worked

526
00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:09.110
together and I was like,
I don't want to bring it up because it didn't work.
Oh,

527
00:34:09.111 --> 00:34:13.860
but know,
okay,
well all right.
But it was so nice.
Sweater.

528
00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:17.220
A nice time together.
All right.
That's it.
Uh,

529
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:22.190
I'm going to do a little pop included me creatively.
If you start crying,

530
00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:26.630
I swear to God and I appreciate that.
I really do.
I love you for that.

531
00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:31.600
I love you for having me on.
I said,
shut up.
This isn't,

532
00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:35.170
this isn't this kind of a podcast.
I'm making a moment.
Let me have it.

533
00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:39.580
Thank you so much for including me on your podcast and all your creative

534
00:34:39.581 --> 00:34:42.880
endeavor is all these years.
I love you so much for that.

535
00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:46.930
Very nice.
But you did it whales.

536
00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:51.070
And I just feel like it's a way that you show me that you love me and I

537
00:34:51.071 --> 00:34:54.350
appreciate that.
That's how I keep you from bitching at me.
That does.

538
00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:03.860
He can't play gate me in that way,
but I really do a pretty good,

539
00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:05.500
you take like an arrogant till today.

540
00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:10.510
You were just like talking all kinds of shit.
All right.

541
00:35:10.511 --> 00:35:13.540
Got My mojo going from that walk.
All right,
positive and negative.

542
00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:18.720
I'm going to have a sardine bar after this because there's more coming later

543
00:35:19.721 --> 00:35:23.590
today.
No,
it's funny.
You're going to bite into that routine.
Food can flux.

544
00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:26.680
That's what you're going to do it does it suck?
Yeah,
of course it does.
Healthy.

545
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.300
Um,
but it doesn't like,
I don't know,

546
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:34.270
have at least a little bit of good flavor to it and just imagine your chocolate

547
00:35:34.271 --> 00:35:39.100
covered sand.
Oh No.
That's what it tastes like.
Okay.

548
00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.670
Like the amount of water that you need to drink or like a half of it will be

549
00:35:42.671 --> 00:35:47.650
stuck in your teeth.
Oh,
gross.
It's disgusting.
But she wanted one.

550
00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:51.000
Can I still have it?
Huh?
Can I still have that last one?

551
00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:54.610
This is all like to some insecurity about whether I still love you or not.

552
00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:59.500
Are you willing to give up what you eat will be the last why you are just you

553

Oh Gel bringing the sunshine on a rainy day.
Dead Silence.
How are you man?

647
00:42:36.671 --> 00:42:37.690
It's been a long time.

648
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:40.630
We haven't done an uninformed for a while and we were going to do one this week,

649
00:42:40.631 --> 00:42:45.400
but we can't,
which is because,
because we're shooting the movie.
Yeah.

650
00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:49.140
You know,
you've made like three kickoffs.
Number four annoying sounds already.

651
00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.180
What are they?
Come on here and get kicked around today.

652
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:55.960
Not to get kicked around you.
Yeah.
My way of saying that I'm fond of you.

653
00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.130
Uh,
I noticed by the way,

654
00:43:00.131 --> 00:43:03.190
you're not using your user won't wind sock on the mic.

655
00:43:03.191 --> 00:43:06.390
You switched over to a black wind sock.
You usually have that right blue one.

656
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.790
Well,
you know what happened was I,
uh,

657
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:12.960
Mike Dog chewed up the orange one was the orange one that I had and then you

658
00:43:12.961 --> 00:43:16.500
know something,
well,
I use the blue one.
Everybody ended up having the orange one.

659
00:43:16.501 --> 00:43:19.740
I went on a couple other people's podcasts.
Jimmy Dore had the orange one.

660
00:43:19.741 --> 00:43:23.790
Everyone had the orange one.
And I thought I was all fucking hip and cool.
Like,

661
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:28.170
like they didn't make 9 million of them and put them out in every guitar center

662
00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.580
around there and not know.
I thought I had the original,

663
00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:33.850
like I went on Ebay but a vintage windscreen.
I didn't,
that's a bummer.

664
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.390
It's a bummer.
Yes,
it is.
Joe.
Joe,
let's tell our raw already.
You know,

665
00:43:37.391 --> 00:43:41.380
you and I are,
have,
uh,
very,
uh,
similar attitudes towards people.

666
00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:46.330
What we're big into charities
helping out others.
Yup.

667
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:50.770
Um,
I went over to a,
decided I was gonna eat healthy.
All right Joe.

668
00:43:50.771 --> 00:43:51.870
So I go over to the,
uh,

669
00:43:51.871 --> 00:43:55.030
the little market over there that will remain nameless so you can keep your

670
00:43:55.031 --> 00:43:59.560
anonymous life here.
Thank you.
You pick level of celebrity.

671
00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.910
I walked in there right in this,
this,
you know,
I'm trying to find some milk.

672
00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.660
So I'm sitting there looking,
they had like strawberry flavored blueberry flavor.

673
00:44:07.661 --> 00:44:10.750
I'm like,
so I asked the guy that works there.
I'm like,
dude,
what?
Uh,
where's,

674
00:44:10.751 --> 00:44:15.220
where's the regular [inaudible] led to my friend.
I'm like,
where is the regular,

675
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.300
the regular milk?
And he goes,
this is not to know this is all yogurt.

676
00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:23.290
But it was in these big milk,
like,
like court sort of,
uh,

677
00:44:23.291 --> 00:44:25.580
I've never seen yoga in there.
And he goes,
this is all yogurt.

678
00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:29.250
And then just this big exaggerated suite to the other side of the owl.

679
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:32.300
The milk is over here.
Yeah.

680
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.360
So then I just paused and I looked at him.
I go,
oh right.

681
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.410
That's all I was asking you.
And then he breaks into this big smile.
Oh,
okay.

682
00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:43.740
My friend.
I didn't know.
Fuck you.
You passive aggressive.

683
00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:47.760
Kentucky hates your fucking job and you think just because I don't fucking work

684
00:44:47.761 --> 00:44:49.620
here,
I don't have the Goddamn store memorized.

685
00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:53.100
And you're standing in the aisle with your,
I work here fucking apron.
Yeah.

686
00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:55.290
I'm going to ask you a question where this shit is.
You don't like it.

687
00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:59.880
You quit your fucking job.
I don't want to get either how he acts like it's,

688
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:04.830
he acts like it's normal that every store sells flavored drinkable yogurt.

689
00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:09.060
That's a product you see everywhere.
It looked like a court.
It was like,

690
00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:14.160
but it was shaped like sort of a bottom heavy broad with no tits shape.

691
00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:18.240
Like
you know what I mean?
Now he's acting like,

692
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:21.070
well obviously one of those gymnast.
Gotcha.

693
00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:24.510
A Cup chick who rides a bike too much.
I know what you're talking about.

694
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.350
You know I've seen it bill,
cause I'm a cultured man who seemed drinkable yogurt.

695
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:31.980
But you know,
I wouldn't blame a guy.
They have drinkable yogurt.

696
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:36.390
That's what that shit was.
When did that come up?
I Dunno,
a couple of years ago.

697
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.920
I don't know when it came out.
I mean,
I knew it existed though.

698
00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:43.590
He was like a game show host with that.
The men is over here.

699
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:48.210
Like this big sparkly curtain was gonna fucking what a dickhead.
Exactly.

700
00:45:48.211 --> 00:45:50.540
You know what?
I'm glad he fucking stocks the milk shelves.

701
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.770
You know the yogurts show y'all get shit.
No,
he didn't.

702
00:45:52.771 --> 00:45:56.040
He was actually over by the eggs cock sucker.
Yeah,
I was in the right area.

703
00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:58.350
You had guide did that to me today.

704
00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:01.320
I had to call the guy and ask him for information and he goes,
well,

705
00:46:01.321 --> 00:46:05.070
this was all in the email that I'd sent you.
It's just like that.
And I go,

706
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.250
passive aggressive.
I can't call you a moron.
And then I was like,
I'm sorry.

707
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:13.170
I must have missed that.
I didn't,
I didn't see it.
I apologize.
And he goes,
uh,

708
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:17.310
he goes,
oh,
well no worries.
I need to do this for you anyway.

709
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.900
So it's not really a big deal.
It's like,
well,

710
00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:22.440
if you needed to do it for me anyway,
shut the fuck up.

711
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:23.910
If you needed to do,

712
00:46:23.911 --> 00:46:27.380
why do you got to get you a little jab in if you needed to do this for me anyway

713
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:29.430
to begin with.
Okay,
let's be honest here.

714
00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.920
We're both a couple of morons in both those situations.

715
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.460
I wasn't reading the label.
Both of them have jobs and they want to say,

716
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:39.090
why don't you read the label?
You'd dumb cunt.
Why don't you read your email?

717
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:43.830
But they can't.
So they have to go passive aggressive.
Well that's what you get.

718
00:46:43.831 --> 00:46:47.160
You're in the service industry.
I am not serve me.

719
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:54.210
Sorry.
You just have zero tolerance Joe.
He's had zero tolerance.

720
00:46:54.211 --> 00:46:54.841
I'm actually,

721
00:46:54.841 --> 00:46:58.320
you're probably wondering Cibele why you on the road on a Monday beginning,

722
00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:00.850
you usually come back from my,
my,
my stalker.

723
00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:04.000
So listen to this fucking thing every week as I basically,
uh,

724
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.430
I was just thinking,
you know,
I'm basically documenting my life,
you know,

725
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:11.380
one week at a time.
Like if I imagined,
if I just kept doing this,

726
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.410
it's like that and Michael Keaton movie where he's dying.

727
00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:18.540
He was videotaping everything.
What'd he say?

728
00:47:18.541 --> 00:47:23.400
My podcast is like an awful movie that no one can remember.
I liked that movie.

729
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:27.000
It's called my life.
It's very sad.
Very Sad.
Actually.

730
00:47:27.001 --> 00:47:29.500
I learned about young Joe to Roseanne.
And for those of you going,

731
00:47:29.501 --> 00:47:32.920
who the fuck is Joe to Rosa?
Um,
that's a normal question.

732
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:34.660
Who Need Care would ask that question?

733
00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:37.810
People who don't watch a comics unleashed this before.

734
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:41.560
What else have you been on?
I had a Gotham comedy.

735
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:47.310
I had my premium blend.
I had a presents half hour presents.
Ooh,

736
00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:51.530
the Nacelle shows Iraq,
Iraq.
Uh,

737
00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:55.490
I had been on Carson daily several times.
Several.
It's a regular performer,
uh,

738
00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.130
New York City for Christ sakes.
Goddamn regular.
Oh,
that's right.

739
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:04.870
I forgot I moved away and you took my slot.
They never even miss me.
I was,

740
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.740
that's when I realized when I went to La and just how fucking unbelievably

741
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.740
replaceable I am.
Not that they got somebody else,

742
00:48:11.741 --> 00:48:14.590
but that they replaced me with you,
Joe,
or what I learned,

743
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:20.650
but I learned was all I had to do was go in and start trashing the guy that was

744
00:48:20.651 --> 00:48:22.210
there before me,
which was you.

745
00:48:22.211 --> 00:48:25.610
And they immediately would stab you in the back and laugh.
Well,

746
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.270
that's what that whole show is about.
Just evil.

747
00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.960
As long as I brought a little evil and it didn't give a shit if they're good

748
00:48:31.961 --> 00:48:33.880
guys,
that's what's the greatest part of that show.

749
00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:38.200
He smile at your friend is you see the bus coming up behind them and at the last

750
00:48:38.201 --> 00:48:40.230
second you step out of the way without warning them.

751
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:41.620
Just watch them get run over.

752
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:46.510
But starting from good photos and see your killer cost killers come with a

753
00:48:46.511 --> 00:48:50.710
smile.
What's the line?
It's that.
It's that line.

754
00:48:50.711 --> 00:48:55.570
Wherever that line is.
Ah,
any algae.
So anyways,
wait,
what did you learn about me?

755
00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:59.190
You said you learn something about me.
Uh,
you shake your foot.
Oh,

756
00:48:59.191 --> 00:49:02.570
I'm reason that this is what I've learned about you gel is that,
uh,

757
00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:07.030
Joe is actually a big fan of romantic comedies.
I love him.

758
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:12.820
You don't like them?
Do you know why?
Because I,

759
00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.190
they make me uncomfortable.
They make me not Joe,

760
00:49:15.191 --> 00:49:17.350
with all your failed relationships.

761
00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:22.530
I thought we lined up here with like hating that Sorta cheeseballs stuff.

762
00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:26.170
Why are you fucking twitch in your foot?
What I do,
it's how I sit.

763
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:29.830
It's what I do when I sit.
What do you,
what do you care?
It's just,
it was fucking,

764
00:49:29.831 --> 00:49:33.420
it's in my peripheral vision here.
It's like,
it's that distracting me.
Well,

765
00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:38.330
it's my apartment.
Is that,
uh,
is,
is that,

766
00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:43.040
no,
whatever that serviceness yeah,
it's nervousness.
You're,

767
00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.910
you're a friend of the show here.
Opiate ethics.
I feel like a power either

768
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.940
compounds.
You trash me.
You think it's not going to happen.
Okay.
So,

769
00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.380
but he just crossed his right foot back.
Oh,
I'm a nervous guy.

770
00:49:56.381 --> 00:50:01.000
I shake my legs a lot.
Seriously.
I understand that.
And I want to,

771
00:50:01.001 --> 00:50:03.130
I want to find out that I had that restless leg syndrome,

772
00:50:03.131 --> 00:50:05.110
but that's not what that is.
That's when you're laying down.

773
00:50:05.111 --> 00:50:07.150
Your legs won't stop moving.
I don't have that.

774
00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:10.840
I'm like the 18 hundreds who has restless leg syndrome or they were just talking

775
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:14.920
about it recently.
Giant fucking fairy tale warts on your face,

776
00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:19.970
living under a bridge.
So yeah,
I look,
here's why I like romantic comedies.

777
00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:24.190
Hundred and 20,000 people died from restless leg syndrome.
He can't die from it.

778
00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.980
You just,
you know,
Bill,
I think now you're taking the joke a little too,

779
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:32.240
but a fun personality just fits this fucking rain there.

780
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:36.650
You know?
You know what this asshole did.

781
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.240
This asshole.
This is what Joe,
just classic dirty white boy,
right?

782
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:44.480
It's fucking pouring out.
He fucking sits down.

783
00:50:44.481 --> 00:50:47.540
He's putting on a brand new pair of sneakers.
They look great.
I'm like,
Joe,

784
00:50:47.541 --> 00:50:50.360
what are you doing?
You're going to wear those outside?
He goes,
yeah,
you know,

785
00:50:50.361 --> 00:50:54.640
I just,
I don't like new sneakers.
I got to muck them up a little bit.
Yeah,

786
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.380
I can look a little worn in.
That's all.
Why Joe?

787
00:50:57.381 --> 00:51:00.650
So you can look like you know you're the real deal.
No,
they're just,

788
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:03.500
you're worried that people are gonna think that you're rich.
They are new.

789
00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.470
They're nice.
They're not new.
But y'all,

790
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.970
when you buy it new from when you buy a new car,

791
00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:11.120
someday you're going to sideswipe different muck it up a little bit.
Oh,

792
00:51:11.121 --> 00:51:14.420
that's different.
See my beautiful wardrobe in there.

793
00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:17.660
I keep my sport coats very crisp and clean.
I keep my ties iron.

794
00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.280
Some things you like to look new.

795
00:51:19.281 --> 00:51:22.060
Some things you like to look a little worn and it's like a buck when you get it.

796
00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:23.720
What do you get when you get a baseball hat?

797
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:25.550
You don't want it to look brand new off the shelf.

798
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:29.480
Do you want it to have to the creases in the fucking face so that shit when they

799
00:51:29.481 --> 00:51:33.500
walked down the street,
they can like smell you're sweaty hair now dude.

800
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.850
You like a brand new hat.
Have you ever seen when they,

801
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:40.760
they now sell the hats that look worn in for that very reason.

802
00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.750
When I was in college,
I don't like those when I was in college.
What does the,

803
00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:46.970
for those that are make it seem like you supported the team for years and

804
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:50.470
they're not.
They just look cooler.
That's it.
That's all it is.

805
00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:55.010
That they're filthy.
They're not filthy.
They look worn in.
When I was in college,

806
00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.580
guys would buy baseball hats.
We put them in the first,

807
00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:01.930
he did put it in the Washer.
You'd wash it immediately to get it loose and,

808
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:04.130
and creased up a little bit cause it looked better.

809
00:52:04.131 --> 00:52:07.400
Now then you take your brand new sneakers and run around in the rain because it

810
00:52:07.401 --> 00:52:11.690
looked better.
Brandon,
who can make well they were new enough job,
nice shiny,

811
00:52:11.691 --> 00:52:14.660
fucking lazy and they're not,
they're not getting that warning and look,

812
00:52:14.661 --> 00:52:18.440
they still look puffy and like to like,
dude,
they look great.

813
00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:23.390
All right to you.
My opinion doesn't mean you don't.
Good,
cool.
You look,

814
00:52:23.391 --> 00:52:26.940
if he came out on on on a on stage with a nice new pair of sneakers and it's

815
00:52:26.941 --> 00:52:30.560
been a coming out there with the fucking Mike Birbiglia wardrobe.

816
00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:33.910
What are you talking about?
This is all frumpy.
That his book,
I don't,

817
00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:37.490
you're stealing from Mike Birbiglia.
I'm not on stage.
I wear a tie.

818
00:52:37.491 --> 00:52:40.740
I wear goddamn sweaters.
It look fucking fantastic when I'm on stage.

819
00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:45.770
You know why Joe?
You say,
dude,
what ruins his suit?
Cheap shoes.
And You my friend,

820
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:50.270
we're cheap.
Youtube.
How do your mind,
no,
I'm not.
I'm totally competent.

821
00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:53.390
You know what dress shoes cost.
That's not cut into it because that's tacky.

822
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.040
How much,
how much do they cost?
They cost enough.
My show,

823
00:52:56.041 --> 00:52:59.590
they're almost see through.
I can watch you wiggle your toes.

824
00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:02.900
You want me to go in there and pull out the dress shoes I'm wearing these days?

825
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:04.280
All these days.

826
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.810
Well they kicked it up a notch because the other days all meaning all the days I

827
00:53:08.811 --> 00:53:09.710
ever worked with you,

828
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:13.860
you came out with some shit that meaning two years ago they look like you will

829
00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:17.750
see.
I always will.
Years show is dressing your God Damn Hudson or uh,

830
00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:21.380
whatever theater show you did hear town hall,
whatever.
Theater show,

831
00:53:21.381 --> 00:53:24.980
town hall.
You mean the word?
Remember the name of it.
I'm saying like,

832
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:28.200
well nice to know was a big night and your life and it was a big night of my

833
00:53:28.201 --> 00:53:31.140
life and I,
and I strolled in.
I looked like fucking sharp.

834
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:33.480
Everybody was going look at those fucking shoe.
They weren't,

835
00:53:33.481 --> 00:53:36.480
they were talking about Liggett face cause you weren't all bloated with booze

836
00:53:36.481 --> 00:53:39.330
for once.
They'll,
that's what we were talking about bill.

837
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:44.190
I had seven 15 fucking people come up to me that night and go,
dude,

838
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:46.620
those shoes or everybody who is listening right now,

839
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:51.240
you know when somebody's lying when they 17 people,
I counted them.

840
00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:55.590
I tell quite say kick your butts in my shoes.
Okay fine,
my fault,
my fault.

841
00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:56.610
But up until then Shell,

842
00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.660
the shoe shoe wearing on stage looked like they were a combination of

843
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:03.870
fresh shows and dress shoes and slippers.

844
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:06.180
I know a pair of shoes you're talking about.

845
00:54:06.181 --> 00:54:10.750
I wore them one time with you and you made fun of me and I never wore them again

846
00:54:10.751 --> 00:54:13.670
because they didn't feel like hearing it from you and for your advice and that's

847
00:54:13.671 --> 00:54:14.870
where you wore them on that in that whole tour.

848
00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:18.990
Let's fight for your advice after that,
after that,
uh,

849
00:54:18.991 --> 00:54:21.870
after that weekend I got emails from people going,

850
00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:23.430
I thought your shoes were really nice.

851
00:54:23.431 --> 00:54:26.160
I don't know why bill was fucking with your shoes so much on stage when you were

852
00:54:26.161 --> 00:54:26.994
up there together.

853
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:31.050
Now the phantom emails of people who agreed with you and you're doing your day

854
00:54:31.051 --> 00:54:33.760
with me.
I'm taking a note on it.
I'm not yelling.

855
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:36.750
I thought it was gonna be a funny conversation.
I didn't know.
You know Joe,

856
00:54:36.751 --> 00:54:39.660
you're really,
your mood is really affected by the weather.
I'm really understand.

857
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.490
You know I,
I find,

858
00:54:41.491 --> 00:54:44.670
I find myself to be quite presentable and I get a little offended when somebody

859
00:54:44.671 --> 00:54:48.210
says that I that I looked like a bum.
I don't look like you look like a bum.

860
00:54:48.211 --> 00:54:52.740
You said.
I said it was.
I said,
that's perfectly as look.
Yeah.

861
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.380
And I don't dress that way.
I don't know what you're talking about.

862
00:54:55.381 --> 00:55:00.240
I dress very parents show you're a fucking fashion plate.

863
00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:02.640
Thank you Jesus Christ.

864
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:05.090
All I told you to do is not wearing brand new sneakers in the fucking rain.

865
00:55:05.091 --> 00:55:08.520
Just asked why you do it and muck them up a little bit and then you come in 10

866
00:55:08.521 --> 00:55:09.354
minutes later,

867
00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:14.100
pissed off how wet you got out there with your pants draped over the fucking

868
00:55:14.101 --> 00:55:17.040
fan.
You want to wear a brand new sneakers out net salary.

869
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:20.970
Sorry for me giving a shit about your map brand new from the eighties time.

870
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:24.540
Then little,
they look brand new compared to the stuff that you usually wear.

871
00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:25.790
Sorry Joe.
Well,

872
00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:28.860
because Chuck's you're not supposed to wear to resent the fact that you say
that.

873
00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:31.740
I'm not a nice dresser right now sitting around doing a podcast.
Well,

874
00:55:31.741 --> 00:55:34.770
you know I am not,
but when I joined I look present.
I'm old school too.

875
00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:39.270
I go on stage,
I look presentable,
dude.
I,
I wear fucking ties.

876
00:55:39.271 --> 00:55:41.610
There were sport coats or sweaters or wear dress shoes.

877
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.030
I'm telling you something dude.
What that $120 a fucking

878
00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:50.450
word that that gap suit that you wear gap.

879
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:53.580
You look like you're selling encyclopedias.
I didn't want to say that,

880
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.450
but when you go,
oh,
I didn't know that.
You're fucking with me.
Fucking,
you know,

881
00:55:57.451 --> 00:56:01.140
this got all serious,
this is serious.
I know.

882
00:56:01.141 --> 00:56:04.770
I just said you're baiting me of taking the bait.
Congratulations.
Yeah,
no,

883
00:56:04.771 --> 00:56:08.610
it's the congratulations part.
Uh,
I'm say congratulations.

884
00:56:08.611 --> 00:56:11.880
I'm glad you haven't fun.
I fell for it.
All right.
What do you weren't for me?

885
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:15.490
I always fall for it.
All right.
I don't,
I don't,
I don't want the test.

886
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.360
So this is Joe to Rosa and I think,
uh,
every,

887
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:21.090
every once every six months we do an uninformed Joe,

888
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.520
tell our listeners why we're,
uh,

889
00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:26.530
we're not doing an uninformed this week considering we're sitting here next to

890
00:56:26.531 --> 00:56:31.120
each other because we're doing a movie.
We're shooting a movie,
uh,

891
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:34.750
that I am,
if I can say so.

892
00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:39.970
Directing and producing and acting in and you are also acting in it and

893
00:56:39.971 --> 00:56:43.750
producing it.
And it's a little crazy and busy right now.
So it's Robert Kelly,

894
00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:47.200
Robert Kelly.
So we wrote a short film,
believe it or not,

895
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:52.870
us three shitheads actually are going to complete something.
Yes.

896
00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.150
Yes.
Incredible.
It is.

897
00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:57.910
I was blown away last night when we're sitting here rehearsing and like,

898
00:56:57.911 --> 00:57:02.500
this is actually fucking funny.
And we're actually going to ship this.
Yes.

899
00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:04.870
And then what happens?
One rainy day,

900
00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:08.590
a couple of comments about your wardrobe and all that fucking love and feeling.

901
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:12.990
I've been a little stressed with all the responsibilities I've,
uh,

902
00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:15.610
to waken on.
It's so fucking loud.

903
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:19.610
Probably because you didn't check it before.
Now I'll be,

904
00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:21.460
I have them on the same level.
Dude.
You have,

905
00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:25.750
you have a fucking booming voice job.
It's here.
We can't be at the same level.

906
00:57:25.751 --> 00:57:28.330
We were always at different levels when we do this.
Thanks Joe.

907
00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:34.570
Thanks Joe.
Thank you for basically stating what I said.

908
00:57:34.571 --> 00:57:37.630
I kind of use your shit and say you always wanting to be nerves ready around on

909
00:57:37.631 --> 00:57:39.100
12 o'clock.
That's exactly what it,

910
00:57:39.101 --> 00:57:40.770
and that's how you sound in my head by the way.

911
00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:44.770
You adjust the trim and I always tell you that you adjust the trim.
All right,

912
00:57:44.771 --> 00:57:48.670
Joe,
you know something that people recommend movies.
All right,
here's something.

913
00:57:48.671 --> 00:57:51.850
Here's somebody recommended this movie and I've never heard of it because it's a

914
00:57:51.851 --> 00:57:55.630
romantic comedy.
Okay?
And I want to know what you think about and said,
uh,
movies.

915
00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:59.260
Um,
some of the listeners will call me a fag,

916
00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:02.860
but a watch the movie 500 days of summer.

917
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.220
It's by definition a romantic comedy.

918
00:58:06.221 --> 00:58:11.221
But this one is really funny and pretty much for me sums up relationships in our

919
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:16.710
twenties and thirties.
I've heard it's a tremendous film.
I've never seen it.
What,

920
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.600
five,
500 days.
Why are there 500 days?
Because they're so in love that it,

921
00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:24.820
the summer seems endow cause I think the girl's name is summer and the total

922
00:58:24.821 --> 00:58:28.960
time that they're together as 500 days.
Ah,
I get it.

923
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:33.550
So 500 days.
So this person spends,
how much is 500 days?
About a year and a half.

924
00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:37.720
Yeah.
So he sent 500 days with summer.
And what happens in the end?

925
00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:41.210
God think he marries her and then it's the fall.
I don't think so.
I'm a,

926
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:42.430
I think it's a,

927
00:58:42.431 --> 00:58:45.770
I think it's something where there's a little bit of a twist where one character

928
00:58:45.771 --> 00:58:48.370
abortion doesn't believe in love and the other one does.

929
00:58:48.371 --> 00:58:51.940
And then that sort of shifts,
you know what I mean?
Oh,
okay.

930
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:53.890
Is there an abortion or anything like that?

931
00:58:53.891 --> 00:58:57.670
And I think there's a brutal rape scene.
It's fine.

932
00:58:57.671 --> 00:59:01.240
I was going to see this hobby calc tells him jerking off in her face.
Yeah.

933
00:59:01.241 --> 00:59:05.440
He comes in,
he shows his Dick.
That's right.
And that,
uh,
and he starts crying

934
00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:11.290
that Harvey got with,
actually,
you want a great recommendation for a movie,

935
00:59:11.291 --> 00:59:15.070
speaking of Harvey Cartel crying and jerking off that new bad lieutenant was

936
00:59:15.071 --> 00:59:18.940
fucking amazing.
Nicolas Cage was off the charts in it.
I thought it was funny.

937
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:20.910
It was hilarious,
but it didn't,

938
00:59:20.911 --> 00:59:23.750
it was that like a snakes on the plane thing where they'd started to make it

939
00:59:23.751 --> 00:59:24.201
seriously.

940
00:59:24.201 --> 00:59:27.080
Then they realize they actually had a comedy and they just went with it.
No,

941
00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:32.160
it's supposed to be funny and creepy and it's both and it's fucking amazing.

942
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:36.350
Okay.
I think it was off to fucking meter in it meant all right.

943
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:39.920
He plays 500 days of summer is first.
I'm gonna check that out.

944
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:42.050
Just very brutal rape scene.

945
00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:47.780
Do you know,
it's amazing.
Is just like,
you know,

946
00:59:47.781 --> 00:59:52.520
every movie's been done that hasn't been done in a romantic comedy.

947
00:59:52.521 --> 00:59:55.510
There's never been a brutal rape scene,
you know,

948
00:59:55.511 --> 01:00:00.080
so it's funny is that that adjective with,
uh,

949
01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:03.320
rape has been used so much that that's actually an expression,

950
01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.600
brutal rape scene.
It's never a horrific rape scene.
You know what I mean?

951
01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.980
Like whenever you look in,
uh,
like the movies and they review something,

952
01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.830
they'll say a woefully miscast.

953
01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.310
You're never horrifically miscast or another awful word,

954
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.340
another adjective that means an awful,
can you please help me do it?

955
01:00:22.341 --> 01:00:27.140
I've just really talk myself.
Yeah,
I know what you mean.
It's always,

956
01:00:27.141 --> 01:00:30.630
it's always brutal rape.
It's,
uh,
it's,
uh,

957
01:00:32.050 --> 01:00:35.060
Carlos men see on that fuck you adjusted it.

958
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:39.170
Maybe I'm just cause it looks fine on the meter or your headphones turned away

959
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:42.500
when you start talking in my head.
You know what it sounds like.
You know,

960
01:00:42.501 --> 01:00:46.880
like when a fucking black dudes back in the day had the hatchback and the stereo

961
01:00:46.881 --> 01:00:50.010
from the bumper,
we're going to tell you what pill.
I hate to break it to you.

962
01:00:50.011 --> 01:00:52.820
You're,
you're a little low as the problem.
What do you mean I'm a little low?

963
01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:56.330
You're not going up.
Oh,
that's yours,
dude.
That's yours.
I turned you down.

964
01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.120
I don't know when you're talking.
You're a little low.
I'm looking at the meter.

965
01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.450
No,
I'm not.
I'm fine.
I'm right here,
dude.
I don't,

966
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:04.670
I don't want to get up in the red.
Okay.
Are you were you weren't a second ago.

967
01:01:04.671 --> 01:01:06.670
That's the only reason I show.
It's called,
it's called dynamics.

968
01:01:06.671 --> 01:01:07.640
Sometimes you bring him down,

969
01:01:07.641 --> 01:01:11.960
you pull the listener's closer to their shop radios.
All right.
What happened?

970
01:01:11.961 --> 01:01:15.200
Talk Radios.
Oh,
I got you a clock radio,
by the way.

971
01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:18.380
I know you gave it to me already.
Thank you.
Yeah,
the old fashioned one.

972
01:01:18.381 --> 01:01:21.230
Just thank you Juan with batteries.
Thank you.
In the shower.

973
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:24.790
I said thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
All right,

974
01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:28.060
let's do it anyways.
When making a fucking movie making a fucking movie,

975
01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:30.650
I feel like it's like citizen Kane.

976
01:01:30.651 --> 01:01:34.430
I'm going to do a big speech tomorrow before we shoot the first thing.

977
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.700
What do you think my speech should be?
No.
Everybody's thinking.
What is it about?

978
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:44.750
It's a romantic comedy and believe it or not,
there's a brutal rape

979
01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:50.480
and we're going to get Harvey cartel to come down and show his cock and it's

980
01:01:50.481 --> 01:01:53.990
going to be the greatest.
Uh,
how long has this film?
About 20 minutes.
Yeah.

981
01:01:53.991 --> 01:01:56.570
I mean hopefully it will be down the 15 when we're all done with it,

982
01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:59.120
but we can't tell you what it's about.

983
01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:03.080
You're just going to have to wait for it to come to your local AMC 20 minute

984
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:06.140
movies theaters.
Yeah.

985
01:02:06.141 --> 01:02:11.141
Look for it on Netflix on some sort of best of short films of 2010 or maybe they

986
01:02:11.781 --> 01:02:15.730
can show it,
uh,
maybe they can show it.
Uh,
you know,

987
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:18.320
in the beginning when they tried to get you to buy popcorn and that type of
shit.

988
01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:19.130
Well,

989
01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:23.120
what I was thinking is we can maybe shop it around to some theaters like some of

990
01:02:23.121 --> 01:02:26.120
these art house theaters and see if they'll show it before the features.

991
01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.760
I think some theaters do that sort of thing near bill.

992
01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:31.650
And the last thing you want to do is put it up on the Internet.

993
01:02:31.651 --> 01:02:34.880
So all these clients get it for free and we just have more free up.

994
01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:38.430
But you have to do it now.
Isn't that what it is?
Yeah,
you have to.
Yeah,
I have to.

995
01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.100
Who the fuck are you to charge people?

996
01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:44.030
What do you get after we invested all this money in the movie and I like when

997
01:02:44.031 --> 01:02:45.410
people send you emails and letters.

998
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:48.180
<v 7>Yeah,
I downloaded you held him.
Sorry Dude.</v>

999
01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:52.680
<v 5>Lol.
Like you think it's funny.
You know what I mean?
It's like it's not funny.</v>

1000
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.950
It isn't.
You can't,
you're cheap fox.
Yeah.
Af.
Whenever it happened I do that.

1001
01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:01.830
So next week everyone's going to send me emails telling me that they illegally

1002
01:03:01.831 --> 01:03:03.990
downloaded my shit,
thinking that they're totally original,

1003
01:03:03.991 --> 01:03:08.070
that they sent me the newer,
there's a band called spoon.
I'm a big fan of them.

1004
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:12.080
Their new album just came out and the last thing it says in the liner notes is a

1005
01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:17.010
buying,
buying records in record stores is cool.
Like,

1006
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.800
you know,
I don't know why everybody has turned their back on this,

1007
01:03:19.801 --> 01:03:23.850
but it's still awesome to go in and actually buy an album and read the liner

1008
01:03:23.851 --> 01:03:27.210
notes and look at the hard work and all that shit.
So I gotta be honest.

1009
01:03:27.211 --> 01:03:31.380
If I was young and I had no money and I never paid for music,

1010
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:32.940
like think of something you never paid,

1011
01:03:32.941 --> 01:03:34.680
but what they were able to do that with water.

1012
01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:39.030
I never paid for water when I was a kid.
Oh,
I know.
We have to scare them.

1013
01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:42.600
That free music is actually going to give you cancer or something like that.

1014
01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:45.070
They tried like they did with the water.
They try it.

1015
01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:45.651
<v 7>They said,</v>

1016
01:03:45.651 --> 01:03:49.400
they said you're going to get viruses and all and everybody downloading files

1017
01:03:49.401 --> 01:03:51.290
was going to get caught.
And then what happened?

1018
01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:55.910
Fucking hipster Mack came along and apple said,
uh,

1019
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:59.630
hey guys,
you don't get viruses with our computers.
Have a fucking field day.

1020
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:04.090
<v 5>Viruses on this thing is cause the,
uh,</v>

1021
01:04:04.091 --> 01:04:07.210
the virus makers haven't decided to attack it.
Isn't that why?

1022
01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:11.170
I don't understand why because everybody likes the underdog.

1023
01:04:11.171 --> 01:04:14.740
But eventually these,
these guys aren't going to be the underdog,
the apples,

1024
01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:17.500
and then,
and then when they catch up with pcs,
you don't,
it's like,

1025
01:04:17.501 --> 01:04:20.110
it's like the Red Sox,
you know,
if it was red sox,

1026
01:04:20.111 --> 01:04:23.650
Yankees and the red sox hadn't won in so long,
a lot of people,
you know,
ah,

1027
01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.960
go with the fucking red sox just cause they're the underdogs.

1028
01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:28.890
And then once we won and then we were walking around,

1029
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:33.160
go fucking champions man.
Everybody immediately fucking hated us.

1030
01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.590
And now I would say arguably we are,
uh,

1031
01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:41.530
just about as hated as the Yankees,
I would think,
oh wait,
I'm talking sports,

1032
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:45.280
dub tuned out sports.
I'll talk sports.

1033
01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:47.170
This is how much I don't give a shit about sports.

1034
01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:50.890
You were talking about that and you see that empty plastic container over there.

1035
01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:56.370
I literally zoned in on that and just was focused on that 100% we know some

1036
01:04:57.341 --> 01:05:00.190
Joel,
I don't like romantic comedies either,
but when you talk about them,

1037
01:05:00.191 --> 01:05:01.760
I at least have the decency to listen to her.

1038
01:05:01.761 --> 01:05:05.380
Did you though the underdogs I got with you.
You heard that?
A couple of nouns.

1039
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:06.940
I'm with Ya.
I'm breaking your balls back.

1040
01:05:06.941 --> 01:05:09.740
A little fucking fresh roommate fresh with me.
All right,
Joey,

1041
01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:13.090
we got something here.
A another,
a segment on my podcast.

1042
01:05:13.091 --> 01:05:15.460
We've got segments on this podcast.
Julia.
Bill.
Yes I do.

1043
01:05:15.461 --> 01:05:18.300
You would like to hear another one?
Yes.
Should I want called?
Unacceptable.

1044
01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.710
All right.
This is the one I learned.

1045
01:05:19.711 --> 01:05:22.980
That's the word I use now instead of you fucking cunt.
When I'm,

1046
01:05:22.981 --> 01:05:27.210
when I'm mad at corporations,
I keep my cool.
I try to,
unless I get,

1047
01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.670
I forget myself at halftime speech before I call up and I just,

1048
01:05:29.671 --> 01:05:34.510
I just keep telling them whatever is going on is unacceptable.
Yeah.
Well they,
I,

1049
01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:37.530
there's no one above me.
Uh,
you can't talk to him.
That's unacceptable.

1050
01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:40.890
I have to talk to someone above,
you know,
you're not running the company.

1051
01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:43.200
I know you just doing your job,
man.
You do the nice thing.

1052
01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:44.580
He just keeps saying it's unacceptable.

1053
01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:48.000
So here's an unacceptable one that has to do with Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1054
01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:53.370
All right.
Let me see if I can get to the state of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1055
01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:57.150
I know.
That's why I decided to read this.
I'm like,
Joe likes to eat that slop.

1056
01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.180
Stylish.
You're that Christmas song.
Uh Huh.

1057
01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:05.010
<v 7>Did you hear it know?
It was ridiculous.
It sounded like a Saturday night.</v>

1058
01:06:05.011 --> 01:06:06.450
Live sketch is ridiculous.

1059
01:06:06.570 --> 01:06:10.950
He's literally did songs like here comes Santa Claus and it's Bob Dylan going,

1060
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:14.340
it goes there to close here.
Hosanna.
Close Down Santa.

1061
01:06:14.341 --> 01:06:19.130
It was re dickless rolling stone gave it.
I didn't,

1062
01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:22.440
I don't know.
Did they say he?
He redefined Christmas.
He probably,

1063
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:25.530
I am not a fan of Bob Dylan's work.

1064
01:06:25.531 --> 01:06:28.380
I appreciate the man's abilities and his skill and his talent.

1065
01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:31.800
I do not ever want to listen to any of his music ever like that.

1066
01:06:31.801 --> 01:06:34.560
Tangled up in blue.
He's got a couple songs that how's that want to go?

1067
01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:38.260
<v 8>He does him and his either day,
but he gave it to Dubai blue.</v>

1068
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:43.270
Where did the day of his [inaudible] hair.
But today with the dealer,

1069
01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:49.670
<v 7>I like Lay lady lay lay across my big brass band.
Oh,
I hate that one.</v>

1070
01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.770
I like that word.
Hey,
can you guys vote out there and just say,
well,

1071
01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.130
which one of us is more tone deaf when we sing

1072
01:06:58.190 --> 01:07:02.840
the,
uh,
yeah,
I like that.
I want,
I like a hurricane.

1073
01:07:02.841 --> 01:07:04.820
I know that's a cheesy when the lake,
but I like it.
Yeah.

1074
01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:05.850
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1075
01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:09.260
That's the one they end up making the movie with Denzel and everybody flipped

1076
01:07:09.261 --> 01:07:12.020
out because Denzel didn't win a uh,
an Oscar,

1077
01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:14.720
which obviously meant that it was racist.
Right?

1078
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:18.110
Forget about the fact that Martin Scorsese,
fucking

1079
01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:22.920
<v 7>good fellows,
raging bull and like fucking whatever,</v>

1080
01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:25.120
taxi driver,
all these other,
and he never won one,

1081
01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.740
but it's racism because he gets it because he got passed over.
Well,

1082
01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:32.590
the fair point they make is no black guys ever win them.
I agree with that.

1083
01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:34.690
I agree that they would go for Christ shakes.

1084
01:07:34.691 --> 01:07:37.780
Denzel is the guy that's made it to the top.
You know what?

1085
01:07:37.781 --> 01:07:39.550
You need to give the guy in act and ask her.

1086
01:07:39.551 --> 01:07:41.440
It's not like you're giving it to tons of black dudes.

1087
01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:44.900
I think it was him and shitty poured yet.
That's kind of like that.
That's,

1088
01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.510
but that is in a way

1089
01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:50.960
<v 5>not necessarily racist and I got to wait till everybody goes,
oh geeze,</v>

1090
01:07:50.961 --> 01:07:53.560
is flipping out.
Because still,
you know what is people,

1091
01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:57.610
you know what I've learned to stand up is people give a fuck about themselves

1092
01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:02.290
and not in a bad necessarily,
always 100% in a bad way.

1093
01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:07.060
People are focused on themselves and what appeals to them in their fucking
group.

1094
01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:12.330
So they're not going to be like the fact that a bunch of white people continue

1095
01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:16.680
watch white movies and go,
oh my,
it made me cry.

1096
01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.290
I totally could relate is not racist.
Right.
It's like when like,
okay,
I did,

1097
01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:23.370
I was talking about this last week.
I'm doing standup,
right?

1098
01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:27.830
I'm telling jokes said,
show.
I'm out there.
I'm,
I'm killing the room.
Alright.

1099
01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:29.520
I come out.
One of the first things I did,

1100
01:08:29.521 --> 01:08:33.390
I was talking about swine flu and the gist of the joke is I'm wishing a plague

1101
01:08:33.391 --> 01:08:36.060
on the world.
Everybody's laughing,
everybody's having a great time.

1102
01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:40.470
Then I came around to that bid.
What do you have fig making fun of Homophobia.

1103
01:08:40.650 --> 01:08:44.970
But there was I guess a,
at least one gay dude or someone who had a gay brother.

1104
01:08:44.971 --> 01:08:46.020
I don't know if there was four of them.

1105
01:08:46.021 --> 01:08:48.840
And I guess in the middle of it someone went fucking homophobe.

1106
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:52.440
But I couldn't hear what he was saying because of a,
you know,
I don't know.

1107
01:08:52.441 --> 01:08:54.630
My ears are fucked up.
I couldn't hear it.
So I said,
what'd you say?

1108
01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:57.150
And I guess they stormed out.
And I found out later that he said,

1109
01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.380
you fucking homophobe.
First of all,
the joke was making fun of Homophobia.

1110
01:09:01.381 --> 01:09:03.480
And not only that too,
I made fun of fat people.

1111
01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:06.300
I wish plagues and everybody and everything was fucking fine.

1112
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:07.441
Everything was funny.

1113
01:09:07.441 --> 01:09:10.380
Everything is a fucking joke until it comes around to that shit because that's

1114
01:09:10.381 --> 01:09:15.060
what the fuck that do give a fuck about because that's his daily existence being

1115
01:09:15.061 --> 01:09:17.970
that guy.
So what I'm saying,
it's just because a bunch of white people,

1116
01:09:17.971 --> 01:09:22.530
k a forties and 50s alright,
you got us sixties you got us,

1117
01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:24.570
but seventies eighties nineties and all the way through.

1118
01:09:24.690 --> 01:09:29.220
If a bunch of white people are paying attention to white movies,
you know,

1119
01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:32.110
<v 7>I know what you mean man.
I know what you mean.
People just,
you know,</v>

1120
01:09:32.530 --> 01:09:35.800
I got grown up the other night at Piss me off because I was talking about

1121
01:09:35.801 --> 01:09:40.000
America help in Haiti out and I was like,
you know,

1122
01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:42.250
you don't understand.
You tell you,

1123
01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:46.030
you're telling me we need to stay out of Iraq but we need to go into Haiti.

1124
01:09:46.031 --> 01:09:49.540
And I was like,
don't you see how one can't happen without the other?

1125
01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:54.400
We have to steal the oil so we can be the super power so we can help Haiti.

1126
01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:55.600
Then you know,
it's great.

1127
01:09:55.601 --> 01:09:58.400
It's already talking about putting a permanent base down there so we can protect

1128
01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:00.920
them,
build our empire.
Let me,
let,
let us help us out.

1129
01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:04.750
I'm going to do is build a best buy.
So I go,
don't you get it?
I go,

1130
01:10:04.751 --> 01:10:09.230
I go where the,
where the celebrity,
like this is how celebrities work.
We're,

1131
01:10:09.231 --> 01:10:13.030
we're like Angelina Jolie,
like she probably,
you know,

1132
01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:18.240
fucking threw coffee in some intern space once I'm burn the skin off his skull

1133
01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.500
and she's like,
I feel shitty about that.

1134
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:25.400
Let me go adopt a black kid and just bring it all full circle and I go adopt a

1135
01:10:25.401 --> 01:10:29.550
black kid.
Everybody goes,
oh.
And it's like,
what?
What do you groaning at it?

1136
01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:32.540
<v 5>Right.
I'll tell you what,
they're grown in that because they want to believe Joe.</v>

1137
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:37.930
People want to believe that people are good and that they do things because for

1138
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:40.370
good reasons only.

1139
01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:43.360
<v 7>But if I would've said poor kid,
they wouldn't have grown.
I should black kids.</v>

1140
01:10:43.361 --> 01:10:44.194
So they groaned.

1141
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:48.300
<v 5>It was a black kid was at that and not only was it a black kid who was the best</v>

1142
01:10:48.301 --> 01:10:50.040
looking black kid she could find over there.

1143
01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:52.730
I know they get that little blue fucking Mohawk.
Yeah,
she gets,

1144
01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:57.570
she got the American idol,
a black kid.
Shit,
I can't take this.
I got Lou.

1145
01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:00.960
She keep that she could get pick up the phone,
Huh?
Yes.
Let it ring.
You.

1146
01:11:00.961 --> 01:11:01.794
Don't give a fuck.

1147
01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:06.660
The fact that I was adjusting the levels as we were doing the shelf that didn't

1148
01:11:06.661 --> 01:11:10.190
give it away,
that this thing was kind of fly by night.
All right,
so yeah,
you,

1149
01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.960
you made it,
you made a point.
But that's the thing like you have to learn to,

1150
01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:16.700
if you are the group that is kind of running shit,
you,

1151
01:11:16.701 --> 01:11:19.440
you do have to have some empathy and you do have to let every once in a while

1152
01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:23.040
you got to toss somebody in Oscar.
I get,
is that my point?
I'm just saying,
I mean,

1153
01:11:23.041 --> 01:11:26.040
do you think like the,
all those Arab cab drivers give a fuck that they,

1154
01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:28.430
that they pushed out a,
you know,
you know,

1155
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.570
fucking patty make overwork or whatever.

1156
01:11:30.571 --> 01:11:33.420
He doesn't get to drive a fucking cab anymore.
What about all these Irish guys?

1157
01:11:33.421 --> 01:11:34.800
Hey,
hey Mac way you're going,

1158
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:37.890
those guys all get kicked out and you think they give a fuck.
They don't,

1159
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.780
but do they,
does that mean they hate Irish people?

1160
01:11:39.781 --> 01:11:42.390
They don't give a shit that just fucking hooking each other up.

1161
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:46.050
You're gonna feel bad for it.
They like each other and I feel bad for Indians.

1162
01:11:46.450 --> 01:11:49.500
Did I just compare black people not getting an Oscar do an Irish guy not being

1163
01:11:49.501 --> 01:11:53.040
able to drive a cab that fucking moron.
But I feel bad for Indians,

1164
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:55.260
not American Indians.
I mean,
I feel bad for them too.

1165
01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:58.650
But India Indians that real because they had,

1166
01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:03.240
they had the seven 11 industry locked down.

1167
01:12:03.241 --> 01:12:06.630
That was their shit.
And now it's all Arab dudes and I'm Arab.

1168
01:12:06.631 --> 01:12:08.100
So good for good for the Arabs.

1169
01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:13.810
But they just got shoved out of that businessman habitat that they got shoved.

1170
01:12:13.811 --> 01:12:16.590
They also had the whole world locked down at one point and then England went

1171
01:12:16.591 --> 01:12:20.730
over there and took them over.
Yeah.
That's kind of what happened to them a lot.

1172
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:25.230
We all,
man,
they England take anything over.
I like him to England,
but you know,

1173
01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:28.920
I dunno Joe.
I've read switching and I bullied by an English kid.

1174
01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:32.370
I read like a third of a book that about Winston Churchill and Gandhi.

1175
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:34.800
And then I,
uh,
I don't know what I did after that.

1176
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.550
I started reading this book about Rick Flare after that.
All right.

1177
01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:41.490
I love what ric flair he wanted me to.
Let me,
let's get back to the,
uh,

1178
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.640
unacceptable story here.
Um,

1179
01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:50.480
we just sound so fucking stupid dude.
Oh,
by the way,
and this is this,

1180
01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:55.410
this is why we do the radio show.
Uninformed.
Absolutely.

1181
01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:56.633
I,
you know,

1182
01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:59.670
and you know what's great about is the fucking people who listen to this,

1183
01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:02.430
it makes them feel better about themselves.
Like they're not fucking morons too.

1184
01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:05.390
That's my fear.
That's my favorite part of this shelf.
These guys are folk and ut.

1185
01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:09.330
I said,
I felt sorry for aiding the Indians.
There you go.
They ruled the world.

1186
01:13:09.331 --> 01:13:10.710
So the English took over.
Then I said,

1187
01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:13.860
how do you let it English guy who push you around?
And then you said,

1188
01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:16.720
so that about Rick flare,
it was just

1189
01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:22.640
stream of stupidity.
There was not one worthwhile,

1190
01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:27.930
my fantasy,
Joe,
that I'm actually,
that my listeners are just as dumb as I am.

1191
01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:30.780
I hope so.
I just throw it out there because I don't have to have,

1192
01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:31.710
one of the great thing Joe,

1193
01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:35.510
about free art is you don't have to be nice to the people who listened to me

1194
01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.700
because I've had people complain and I've just been like,
hey,
look,

1195
01:13:38.701 --> 01:13:41.160
y'all don't listen.
You don't mind fantasy.
Am I going to make,

1196
01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.730
how do you make less than zero?
I guess you can make you can lose money.

1197
01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:50.090
My fantasy is that the people that listened to the uninformed show are actually

1198
01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:54.700
smarter than us and cultured and build us up.
Like it's,

1199
01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:00.320
it's a brilliant commentary on the thought process of the average American and

1200
01:14:00.451 --> 01:14:03.720
we,
it's that what they actually think that we're smart and the genuine article,

1201
01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:05.790
it's like one of those movies where the,
you know,

1202
01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:08.640
where the guy doesn't know what the fuck he's doing becomes famous because of
it.

1203
01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:12.110
They're just like,
yeah,
sure.
Everybody,
I'll play along.
Then there's a brutal

1204
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:17.000
<v 3>rape scene.
All right.
His Unacceptable
Kentucky Fried Chicken.</v>

1205
01:14:17.001 --> 01:14:20.690
Here we go.
Uh,
would've fucked.
Did we start anyways?

1206
01:14:20.691 --> 01:14:25.520
I want to share with you my unexpect unacceptable experience at KFC.
Uh,

1207
01:14:25.521 --> 01:14:28.130
there is a KFC by my house that,
uh,

1208
01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:31.940
at least three quarters of the time I visited does not have any crispy chicken

1209
01:14:31.941 --> 01:14:32.774
available.

1210
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:37.790
And last night when I went there at six fucking 30 pm right in the middle of the

1211
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:39.020
dinner hour,
now my computer just shit,

1212
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:42.770
I'm right in the middle of the dinner hour,
they again told me,
sorry,

1213
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:47.060
no crispy chicken at this time it will take 16 minutes to cook more.

1214
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:51.440
Um,
I had enough,
did not respond in any ways that the pumps,
pumps,

1215
01:14:51.441 --> 01:14:55.280
could not turn anything around on me.
And I just left,
went down to a,

1216
01:14:55.281 --> 01:14:57.320
I don't know if you've got a chili dog or some shit.
Anyways,

1217
01:14:57.590 --> 01:15:02.300
so today after work I found myself craving crispy chicken breasts and a wing

1218
01:15:02.301 --> 01:15:05.810
combol again and against my better judgment,
I went back to this fucking place.

1219
01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:08.300
They gave me my meal and I started to leave.
But before I left I was like,

1220
01:15:08.301 --> 01:15:10.520
you know what?
These people don't exactly have a great track record.

1221
01:15:10.521 --> 01:15:13.910
So I opened the bag and Lo and behold,
the breast lift,
the little small,

1222
01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:15.730
I lifted the skin.
So it was dark meats.

1223
01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:18.860
So I went back to the drive through window and waited five minutes while blowing

1224
01:15:18.861 --> 01:15:22.130
my horn for someone to at least give a shit.
When the girl came to window,

1225
01:15:22.131 --> 01:15:25.730
I said very nicely.
I asked her breasts and a wing and I got a thigh.

1226
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:29.990
She said to me,
now,
I made it my thought,
it's a breath.
Uh,

1227
01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:33.350
like I'm too retarded to know the difference between white and dark meat and the

1228
01:15:33.351 --> 01:15:36.830
sizes as well.
So I said,
no,
I eat breasts a lot.

1229
01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:42.320
I know what a breast is.
She began to spew some crap about,

1230
01:15:42.321 --> 01:15:46.190
it was just some sort of small breast or something.
Uh,

1231
01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.460
but because I didn't let her finish,
I just said it's a thigh.

1232
01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:53.540
So finally she decided to realize I wasn't taking any crap.
So she said,
okay,

1233
01:15:53.690 --> 01:15:57.260
five minutes later they bring my food back asking me if I need any sauces,

1234
01:15:57.261 --> 01:15:59.600
like nor they're too little,
too late.
Attempt to customer service,

1235
01:15:59.601 --> 01:16:02.810
took the food and left.
When I got home,
they hadn't closed the mashed potatoes.

1236
01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.690
All the gravy was spilled all over the side of the box.
Not only that,

1237
01:16:05.691 --> 01:16:09.440
but the breast they gave me was only partially cooks.
Obviously,
once again,

1238
01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:12.740
they were ill prepared,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Um,

1239
01:16:12.741 --> 01:16:13.880
so for the first time in my life,

1240
01:16:13.881 --> 01:16:16.610
I find myself writing a letter of complaint to the company's corporation

1241
01:16:16.611 --> 01:16:20.210
headquarters in which I described the situation above with the word
unacceptable,

1242
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:22.130
intermittently dispersed throughout the letter.

1243
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:26.000
Not sure how long it will be before I receive any responses,

1244
01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.940
but their website feedback only allowed 1800 cares.

1245
01:16:28.941 --> 01:16:31.370
This is where it goes off the rails because he hasn't found out what happened.

1246
01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:35.250
<v 7>Well,
this is your problem.
Number one,
why don't don't run.
First of all,</v>

1247
01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:40.500
you did the right thing by,
by making an account of all the mishaps.

1248
01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:42.390
Don't write a letter,

1249
01:16:42.450 --> 01:16:47.310
just call the play shop called the customer service line on the website.

1250
01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:51.270
Complain and demand compensation before you hang up.

1251
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:55.170
And they'll probably send you a bunch of free coupons and shit like that so he

1252
01:16:55.171 --> 01:16:58.460
can go back to this completely inept KFC.
The thing about this is raised,

1253
01:16:58.550 --> 01:17:03.480
you know free.
Fuck it.
You know
some serious you.

1254
01:17:03.481 --> 01:17:07.260
Please say that again,
Joe.
It's free.
Fuck it here.
There you go.
Okay,
well,

1255
01:17:07.261 --> 01:17:08.970
Jonathan Rosen,
this is what I brought Joe in.

1256
01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:11.660
Every once in a while I bring an expert in just like Oprah.

1257
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:15.770
You should be sitting here in scrubs right now.
Dude,
I know some,

1258
01:17:15.771 --> 01:17:19.500
I got admit when it comes to food,
I don't really,
I don't complain.
Like I,

1259
01:17:19.501 --> 01:17:23.180
I would ask them my money back and I would go that route,

1260
01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:26.840
but I would not be like,
you know,
listen,
you know it's a thigh.

1261
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:30.860
I know what a thigh is.
Get me a thigh and then they disappear and come back.

1262
01:17:30.861 --> 01:17:34.190
I mean,
I'll tell you what he needs to do because that,
dude,

1263
01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:35.990
I've done this show many times.

1264
01:17:35.991 --> 01:17:38.330
I've been in these situations that I always complained.

1265
01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:44.170
I would go to the manager of the restaurant,

1266
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.520
right and go and be like,

1267
01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:49.820
I don't mean the night shift manager.

1268
01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:53.780
I want the guy that runs this shop,
that guy,

1269
01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:58.700
he's not here Wednesday.
Here,
I'll be back and go back.

1270
01:17:58.701 --> 01:18:01.160
And then you go to that guy and you go,
listen to me buddy.

1271
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:04.910
Here's all the shit you guys fucked up.
Don't curse.
But you know,

1272
01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:06.650
however you got to say,
yeah,
no,

1273
01:18:06.651 --> 01:18:11.030
I like this fantasy calm Joe that you're creating.
No,
trust me,
I did.

1274
01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:14.720
This is what I would,
you've actually been able to,
when I have to do this,
yeah.

1275
01:18:14.721 --> 01:18:18.800
If I collect myself,
I can do this.
If I call in the moment,
that's when I fuck up,

1276
01:18:18.801 --> 01:18:22.400
but if I,
if I get my shit together,
I can do this.
You go and calm and you go,

1277
01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.860
listen,
here's the deal.
These are all the mistakes you've made.

1278
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:28.790
I'm a loyal customer.
I spend a lot of money here.
I keep coming back.

1279
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:30.020
I'm telling you right now,

1280
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:34.220
either you give me compensation and you really got to play up.

1281
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:36.950
This is the angle you got to play up.
You can't just say,

1282
01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:40.150
I ordered this and I got that because then it's just going to be like,
well,

1283
01:18:40.151 --> 01:18:43.430
they made a mistake.
You got to play up.
Every time I order,

1284
01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:44.900
they gave me the wrong thing,

1285
01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:49.850
but what's worse than that and what's truly unacceptable?
People make mistakes.

1286
01:18:49.851 --> 01:18:53.540
Okay,
fine.
Get to the point Gel.
The fact that your staff,

1287
01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:56.960
the fact that your staff is unable to live up to their mistakes.

1288
01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.960
And when I asked for them to rectify them,

1289
01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:04.910
they give me an attitude like I am somehow wrong for the,
for what they,

1290
01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.380
what they screwed up.
Oh you know what?

1291
01:19:06.381 --> 01:19:09.570
You're 100% right cause I'm about ready to give you a refund just to not listen

1292
01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:10.140
to the rest of it.

1293
01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:13.550
Then you go and you go work with me here and with the guy gives you any problem.

1294
01:19:13.551 --> 01:19:15.110
Then you go,
well I'm going to go to corporate.

1295
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:20.800
I want your store number and I want your full name Jesus and try and go and go.

1296
01:19:21.111 --> 01:19:23.240
And if the guy gives you any trouble,
go really,

1297
01:19:23.241 --> 01:19:25.310
you're not going to give it to me.
Why know your first name?

1298
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:26.690
Because they've seen your name tag.

1299
01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.810
You think I'm not going to figure out what this is because some of them won't do

1300
01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:32.540
that.
Like I've had people walk away from it.
I'm not giving you information.

1301
01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:37.700
Threatened a man showed Rosa says to make threats.
I liked that.

1302
01:19:37.710 --> 01:19:41.930
But after,
I'll call it corporate.
Alright,
here's overrated unrated.

1303
01:19:41.931 --> 01:19:45.110
We got to start wrapping this thing up here.
Jump seats.
I got to actually,

1304
01:19:45.111 --> 01:19:46.660
I've got to go now.
Actually.
I got trust.

1305
01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:51.080
Thank you for rod dropping in and dropping by.
I got to go into the other room.

1306
01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:56.060
Help your cancer dry on the fan.
I fucking missed this place man.
Thanks a lot.

1307
01:19:56.090 --> 01:20:00.230
All right.
Chuck something?
Yeah.
Why not show or your cell phone.
Thanks bill.

1308
01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:02.180
By a whore out your sneaker contract.

1309
01:20:02.181 --> 01:20:06.590
My album is coming out on comedy central records.
It will be out very soon.

1310
01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:08.020
Uh,
what,
what'd you

1311
01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:11.320
<v 5>call it?
Did you call it?
What I wanted you to call it.
No,
I call,</v>

1312
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:15.520
it's called the depression auction,
which I think is a great title.
Uh,

1313
01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.650
so why are you shaking your head?
You don't like it?

1314
01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:21.580
I liked your other one better.
It's fuck time at the ship.
Party dickhead.
Yeah.

1315
01:20:21.610 --> 01:20:26.350
They won't let me name it that cause to me curses and the title.
Ah,

1316
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:28.870
did that and that promotes curiosity.
Is this,

1317
01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:32.920
the next one would have been the look on your face.

1318
01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:34.990
Like something was about ready to happen.

1319
01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:40.090
It looks like it'd be [inaudible] Shit Party dickhead.
Elegant.
Great.
Um,

1320
01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:40.960
anyway,

1321
01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.230
it's called the depression auction will be on comedy central records and a

1322
01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:47.950
couple of months and uh,
I got some headlining dates coming up.

1323
01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:49.960
I'm doing Jesus.
Joe,

1324
01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:54.370
you've got a night at winii brand stress factory in February I think.

1325
01:20:54.371 --> 01:20:59.110
Is that like Tyler Perry's stress factory?
Vinnie brands?
Yeah.
Stress Factor.
Yeah,

1326
01:20:59.170 --> 01:21:01.780
New Brunswick,
New Jersey.
It's on Thursday,
I believe.

1327
01:21:01.781 --> 01:21:06.780
The 11th I think she'll come out to that.
All right.
All right.
Yeah,

1328
01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.730
that was some of the worst typing average Jonah rose,
everybody,
I swear to God,

1329
01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:14.020
you know,
he's what happened?
You just lost your ra,
your momentum there.
No,

1330
01:21:14.021 --> 01:21:14.854
I was trying to,

1331
01:21:14.890 --> 01:21:17.800
because I thought I wanted you to be happy when my album title and you kind of

1332
01:21:17.801 --> 01:21:20.620
shook your head and I,
you know,
he might not,
I like it.
I like it.

1333
01:21:20.621 --> 01:21:21.880
But I'm just saying like,
I this shit.

1334
01:21:21.881 --> 01:21:24.090
Tell him what the fuck party I was kind of wishing you know,
fuck time.

1335
01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:26.830
It's a shift.
Whatever the fuck it is.
It's funny.
I know.
I just,

1336
01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:29.020
it was like it couldn't happen.
I had to call it something out.

1337
01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:32.350
And Depression auction is a bit I do and it says they won't let you,

1338
01:21:33.090 --> 01:21:36.150
which is why we're making our own fucking movie.
Exactly.

1339
01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.240
Cause that's what this business is.

1340
01:21:37.241 --> 01:21:40.300
You come up with an idea and then you go up to these people who aren't funny and

1341
01:21:40.301 --> 01:21:45.280
you go,
is it okay if we do this?
And they're like,
no,
no,
it isn't.
And you go,
okay,

1342
01:21:45.281 --> 01:21:47.770
and you've got to come back with some other stuff.
I actually never even asked.

1343
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:52.190
<v 3>Very cool.
I'm disappointing.</v>

1344
01:21:52.191 --> 01:21:55.640
And you like a parent.
All right.
Okay.
So now it's back to the regular podcast.

1345
01:21:56.060 --> 01:22:00.620
Me Just babbling.
I'm marine underrated.
Overrated.
Um,
over the week,

1346
01:22:00.621 --> 01:22:01.970
here's a question.
Do I,
have,
I asked you guys,

1347
01:22:01.971 --> 01:22:06.530
what do you think is more a overpriced,
okay.
Just little cunty fucking items.

1348
01:22:06.531 --> 01:22:11.531
When he thinks more overpriced disposable razors or orange juice cause both of

1349
01:22:11.691 --> 01:22:14.180
those products they've somehow,

1350
01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.730
like if I was in the corporate world and I was trying to decide how to make more

1351
01:22:19.731 --> 01:22:22.460
money off of our product,
that would be my,

1352
01:22:22.730 --> 01:22:27.730
my presentation that we somehow have to have our product to be perceived the

1353
01:22:29.721 --> 01:22:33.620
same way.
Disposable razors in orange juice,
orange juice.

1354
01:22:33.650 --> 01:22:34.790
I always say that we're on orange,

1355
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.240
orange juice are perceived and that would be my presentation.

1356
01:22:38.241 --> 01:22:41.030
I have like this fucking buildup of music and I would be like,

1357
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:44.930
it would be like disposable razors,
orange juice,
and then Bam,

1358
01:22:44.931 --> 01:22:48.440
whatever the fuck we was selling,
you know,
fucking Koolaid,

1359
01:22:48.441 --> 01:22:52.970
just like orange juice.
It is,
it is drank and it's a different color than water.

1360
01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:57.260
All right,
now I know why I'm a comic and I'm not in the corporate world.

1361
01:22:57.261 --> 01:22:59.060
All right,
let's get to overrate.
Underrated.
Overrated.

1362
01:22:59.090 --> 01:23:03.890
I'm drinking under the age of 21 I've always been a good kid.
Good kid,

1363
01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.450
quote unquote.
What does that,
that meant you didn't drink but you,

1364
01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:11.080
you fucking vandalized places and never started drinking.
Even now that I'm 19.

1365
01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:11.861
Ah,
however,

1366
01:23:11.861 --> 01:23:16.280
all the guys I knew who had been getting wasted since 14 are,

1367
01:23:16.281 --> 01:23:19.780
are all huge losers.
Ah,
Jesus Christ.

1368
01:23:19.781 --> 01:23:22.810
Isn't that true if you start at 17 year,
okay.

1369
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:26.980
That's what I'm advocating under age drinking from 17 on a yeah.

1370
01:23:26.981 --> 01:23:28.990
Those people who if you start drinking at 14,

1371
01:23:28.991 --> 01:23:31.990
you have a terrible home life or you're just a,
you're a,

1372
01:23:31.991 --> 01:23:36.460
you're a follower and a,
yeah.
All those kids,
that's basically a,
the,
yeah.

1373
01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:38.110
The kids had started drinking in eighth grade.

1374
01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:43.330
If you can't make it to fucking out of junior high,

1375
01:23:43.331 --> 01:23:47.830
if you can't make it to high school without needing a fucking scotch to take the

1376
01:23:47.831 --> 01:23:52.570
edge off from,
you know,
adding and subtracting fractions,
you know,

1377
01:23:52.571 --> 01:23:55.750
you're just on your way to the gutter.
Um,
anyways,
he said,

1378
01:23:55.751 --> 01:23:59.500
I still have fun and I still meet girls.
Uh,
by the way,

1379
01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:02.200
I don't think booze is a bad,
is bad or anything.

1380
01:24:02.201 --> 01:24:05.650
I do plan on getting hammered on my 21st birthday,

1381
01:24:05.651 --> 01:24:09.880
which is actually on Saint Patrick's Day,
but it's not essential to having fun.

1382
01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:13.870
Like most people think.
Um,
you know something,

1383
01:24:15.610 --> 01:24:19.330
I'm not trying to fuck up what you're doing here because I think what you're

1384
01:24:19.331 --> 01:24:22.810
doing here is great,
but,
um,

1385
01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:26.230
until you've gone out and get in,
gotten shit face,

1386
01:24:26.231 --> 01:24:30.070
you really don't know which is better.
Okay.

1387
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:33.340
But it's great that you have it because what you haven't done is you haven't

1388
01:24:33.341 --> 01:24:37.630
opened up Pandora's box.
It's Kinda like me,
you know,
sitting here going,

1389
01:24:37.631 --> 01:24:40.660
you know what?
I don't need heroin.
You know,
I feel great.
You know,

1390
01:24:40.661 --> 01:24:44.620
if I go to the gym,
I feel fucking awesome.
You know?
That's all I need.
You know,

1391
01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:48.100
why?
Because I've never felt how awesome heroin feels.

1392
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.870
Does that make any sense?

1393
01:24:49.871 --> 01:24:52.300
This is a really a fucking irresponsible thing that I'm doing here.

1394
01:24:52.301 --> 01:24:56.120
I'm almost like encouraging you to go drink.
I'm just saying,
you know what,
I,

1395
01:24:56.130 --> 01:24:58.360
you know,
if you don't drink until then,
you might not want it.

1396
01:24:58.361 --> 01:25:02.140
You just never fucking do it.
It's not good for you.
Dries out your joints,

1397
01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.290
you drink enough of it.
You need like a fucking hip replacement.
I actually,

1398
01:25:05.291 --> 01:25:10.270
I think that's more like if you do like cocaine,
crystal meth.
I,
yeah.
Why do,

1399
01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:12.310
why do I even try?
I don't even have to fuck.
I'm talking writer,

1400
01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:15.010
underrated girls who wink at you.

1401
01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:17.950
I was introduced to a girl by my friend last night.

1402
01:25:17.951 --> 01:25:20.560
She winked at me and I almost creamed right there.

1403
01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:29.620
Ah,
dude.
You know what?
I'm jealousy.
You,
you are a,

1404
01:25:30.630 --> 01:25:33.760
you ever hear that thing how you can't,
you can't go back.
He can never go back.

1405
01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:37.450
He can't recapture your innocence.
Like I just wish I could somehow,

1406
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:39.281
um,
you know,

1407
01:25:39.281 --> 01:25:42.760
like when you get an external hard drive and you take all this shit off your

1408
01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:47.500
laptop and then you just drag it into the hard drive so you're fucking laptop

1409
01:25:47.501 --> 01:25:51.310
runs smoothly again.
I wish I could do that with my brain and I,

1410
01:25:51.311 --> 01:25:56.311
and the first thing I would do is I would take all the porn that I ever watched

1411
01:25:56.561 --> 01:26:00.010
and I would just eliminate that,
you know?

1412
01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:03.500
And I would just put that on the fucking,
uh,
you know,

1413
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:06.090
I bet we're about five years away from being able to do that shit.

1414
01:26:06.091 --> 01:26:07.440
That would be great.
I do that.

1415
01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:09.123
<v 6>MMM.</v>

1416
01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:13.730
<v 3>Couple of chicks,
the memory of a couple of checks I fucked up in life.
Fuck it.</v>

1417
01:26:13.731 --> 01:26:15.580
Download that.
Put that shit there.

1418
01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:17.950
<v 6>MMM.</v>

1419
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:21.920
<v 3>What other dumb shit?
What else has been fucking me up?</v>

1420
01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:23.220
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1421
01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:25.560
<v 3>Oh,
whatever.
I don't fucking know.
I wish I could do that Shit</v>

1422
01:26:27.150 --> 01:26:30.750
for girl winked at me now I'd be like,
Oh God,
what a fucking cheese ball.

1423
01:26:31.630 --> 01:26:31.980
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1424
01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:35.080
<v 3>but she can't kiss who fucking winks.
I said,
I would think,</v>

1425
01:26:35.081 --> 01:26:39.250
but if I was your age and I hadn't drank yet,
some fucking,
uh,
winked at me.
Yeah.

1426
01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:43.270
I would have fucking,
that would have been it.
That would've been it.
Um,

1427
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:45.730
that was really depressing.
What I just fucking said.

1428
01:26:45.731 --> 01:26:48.280
I think more so for me to do,
you know what?
You're doing the right thing.

1429
01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.890
You live in life the right way,
Dona.

1430
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:56.270
Yeah,
don't do it.
Don't do it.
Don't do whatever everybody else does.
Okay.

1431
01:26:56.271 --> 01:26:57.440
You go out,
you get shit faced.

1432
01:26:57.441 --> 01:27:00.920
And then you move on to fucking weed and then you fucking bang as many fucking

1433
01:27:00.921 --> 01:27:04.400
chicks as she can and you think that you're accumulating all this shit and all

1434
01:27:04.401 --> 01:27:08.060
you're doing is taking a hammer and a chisel to your fucking soul,

1435
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:11.390
and you're just moving further and further away from fucking do you know?

1436
01:27:11.391 --> 01:27:14.600
I think true happiness is,
it's,
it's being,

1437
01:27:14.890 --> 01:27:15.723
<v 6>uh,</v>

1438
01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.260
<v 3>I dunno,
uh,
not ignorant.
Just fucking,
yeah,
you didn't,</v>

1439
01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:26.410
you didn't indulge.
I just,
I don't know.
Um,
uh,

1440
01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:27.750
you know what?
I'm glad Joe was here.

1441
01:27:27.751 --> 01:27:29.910
I didn't realize I was just fucking depressed this week.

1442
01:27:30.810 --> 01:27:31.150
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1443
01:27:31.150 --> 01:27:32.560
<v 3>It's just all the bullshit.
You know what I mean?</v>

1444
01:27:32.561 --> 01:27:35.800
It's like if she takes a minute to fucking eat a donut,
right?

1445
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:37.840
But it takes you an hour to burn it off.

1446
01:27:37.841 --> 01:27:40.380
You know that all that fucking Goddamn treadmill is just said,

1447
01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:44.140
am I really giving you guys a whiny?
It isn't fair speech,
Joe.

1448
01:27:44.141 --> 01:27:46.960
This whole fucking thing just went off the,
uh,
off the rails.

1449
01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:51.400
What happens when I leave?
Is that what happens?
Do you need me around?
Well,

1450
01:27:51.401 --> 01:27:56.110
why don't you help me wrap this up.
I gotta get my rides downstairs.
You'll ride.

1451
01:27:56.230 --> 01:28:00.760
This is New York City equipment for the big film though.
Okay.
Jesus show you can,

1452
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:05.710
you know what my odds of somebody snapping on set tomorrow.
Oh,
you're a,

1453
01:28:05.711 --> 01:28:08.590
I'm guessing,
you know,
that was me.
I'm just trying to be funny.

1454
01:28:08.591 --> 01:28:11.630
I wasn't standing up,
but there's a tension in your voice.
I was gone.

1455
01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:14.590
We got to pick up the equipment there,
Phil.
Oh,
try to be funny.
All right.

1456
01:28:14.610 --> 01:28:19.130
Your face is a little tight.
I'll always is bill
Sanders?

1457
01:28:19.150 --> 01:28:23.230
Not a general.
Okay.
This,
this podcast.
It's just been an absolute cluster fuck.

1458
01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:27.130
But you know something,
I dragged a mixer across the goddamn country.
Few people.

1459
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:30.790
All right.
And um,
I want the first of all,
you know,

1460
01:28:30.791 --> 01:28:33.580
I know I kind of Shit on you guys this week calling you morons in that type of

1461
01:28:33.581 --> 01:28:37.060
thing.
And uh,
if you don't have listen to this again,
I'd fucking understand.

1462
01:28:37.150 --> 01:28:38.830
And uh,
you know,

1463
01:28:38.831 --> 01:28:43.240
I'll learn my lesson and I'll come back on next week under a disguise.

1464
01:28:43.241 --> 01:28:47.090
Name is someone else.
I think I found a new place where I'm going to be,
uh,

1465
01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:52.150
doing these podcasts.
I have time to do one more podcast on g cast.

1466
01:28:52.210 --> 01:28:56.290
Uh,
I'll do it next Sunday for when I'm in Tampa.
I will be in Tampa,

1467
01:28:56.291 --> 01:29:00.490
Florida and a at the Improv.
So please come out.

1468
01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:03.330
And,
uh,
all the last thing too,
by the way,

1469
01:29:03.331 --> 01:29:07.230
that theater I'm playing in England I guess is the Lester Theater for some

1470
01:29:07.231 --> 01:29:12.180
reason.
It's,
it's,
I don't even know.
It's pretty,
it's fucking written like l e.

1471
01:29:12.181 --> 01:29:17.100
I.
C.
E.
S.
T.
E.
R maybe that's like some of their history.
You know,

1472
01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:20.310
Europeans always talking about America,
how there was no history over here,

1473
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.560
you know what I mean?
No documented history,
you know what I mean?
I mean,

1474
01:29:25.561 --> 01:29:29.610
I'm sorry we didn't build some fucking castles that you guys don't even want to

1475
01:29:29.611 --> 01:29:30.970
visit unless you're in the fifth grade.

1476
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.630
They make you take a fucking field trip over there and do a report on it.

1477
01:29:34.110 --> 01:29:38.640
But anyways,
I'll be over there.
Um,
the Lester Theater in London,

1478
01:29:38.641 --> 01:29:43.050
England on the 18th and the 19th.
I'm in Dublin,
Ireland,

1479
01:29:43.051 --> 01:29:46.920
I believe at the sugar club.
And then I'm at Glasgow.

1480
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:51.670
I thought it was glass Gal,
but it's Glasgow,
g o w uh,

1481
01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:55.500
I guess it's said like slow Glasgow,
Scotland.

1482
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:58.130
And it was a couple of places like that,
like,
um,

1483
01:29:59.490 --> 01:30:01.950
Oregon people read it and they,

1484
01:30:01.951 --> 01:30:03.960
and that's a big thing that people in the state of Oregon,

1485
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:09.540
Joe's walking out there like it's not Oregon.
It's Oregon.
Really.

1486
01:30:09.541 --> 01:30:14.400
Then why don't you spell it?
Gin.
Wow.

1487
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:18.990
I'm actually doing bits now about the dual wacky names of states.

1488
01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:23.310
I'm going to fucking end this.
I don't know what happened.
Anyways,
I'm frazzled.

1489
01:30:23.670 --> 01:30:24.750
We're shooting a movie this week.

1490
01:30:24.751 --> 01:30:27.630
I'll let you guys know when that thing comes out and uh,

1491
01:30:27.690 --> 01:30:31.650
where you can purchase it and then one of you will purchase it and then you'll

1492
01:30:31.651 --> 01:30:36.390
put it up on youtube and then everybody will take it for free.
Lol.
Oh my God.

1493
01:30:36.391 --> 01:30:40.480
Laughing my ass off.
Oh,
by the way,
I actually,
uh,
got it.

1494
01:30:41.370 --> 01:30:44.250
That fucking band laughing my fucking ass off.

1495
01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:48.900
L M a o F as that.
ESL laughing my LM.

1496
01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:52.800
I don't fucking know.
Whatever work it out.
Um,

1497
01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:56.310
have you heard that song that they do that shot's song?

1498
01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:59.160
I'm sure you've heard of those guys.
When I first heard that song,

1499
01:30:59.161 --> 01:31:02.560
I'm in Miami Bitch.
I thought that they were idiots and that,

1500
01:31:02.561 --> 01:31:06.900
that that was the end of music and now I realize the fucking genius of what

1501
01:31:06.901 --> 01:31:07.770
those guys are doing.

1502
01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.800
If I was fucking 1920 2122 in that fucking song came on in a bar in a club,

1503
01:31:16.770 --> 01:31:20.640
people must be just going absolutely out of their fucking minds when that comes

1504
01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:25.420
on.
And then did the fucking hot bartenders jump up like our net,

1505
01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:28.470
that fucking coyote ugly and they start pouring shots.

1506
01:31:28.471 --> 01:31:31.680
If I was a club owner right now,
that's the fucking song I would be playing.

1507
01:31:31.890 --> 01:31:35.850
And I pour out shots to all you youngsters and then I would hire a couple of

1508
01:31:35.851 --> 01:31:40.020
more illegal aliens with mops and buckets to wipe up all your puke.

1509
01:31:40.230 --> 01:31:43.020
You inexperienced vox.
But that's a great fucking,

1510
01:31:43.050 --> 01:31:46.830
that's a great God damn song that actually made me want to go out and drink.

1511
01:31:46.831 --> 01:31:50.820
But I haven't,
if you're wondering,
I still haven't drank.

1512
01:31:50.821 --> 01:31:54.870
What in the fuck is today is the 25th.
So I'm 24 fucking days in.

1513
01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:58.620
And uh,
this is my Catholic school upbringing.

1514
01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:00.790
I'm on punishment right now.

1515
01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:05.860
I sinned on January 1st and I just want Jesus to forgive me.

1516
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:09.880
Um,
that's it.
That's it for the podcast.
I know it was all over the place.

1517
01:32:09.970 --> 01:32:14.560
I know it's sucked and uh,
so you know,
I already know.

1518
01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:19.340
Oh fuck.
I forgot to tell us story.
This one's going to be long.
All right.

1519
01:32:19.341 --> 01:32:21.220
Real quick.
I went to a lot of the Ucla,

1520
01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:27.080
Ucla Bruins for uh,
at uh,
the poly pavilion.

1521
01:32:27.230 --> 01:32:29.990
This'll be funny.
This is worse hanging out for all right.

1522
01:32:29.991 --> 01:32:34.100
And I was sitting down and I was down in the front row right behind the basket

1523
01:32:34.101 --> 01:32:35.570
and it,
because it's college sports,
you know,

1524
01:32:35.571 --> 01:32:40.040
you can get that for like fucking 65 bucks,
you know.
So we show up,

1525
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:45.200
meet a buddy of mine and there's this guy in the,
in the,
in a blue UCLA blue,

1526
01:32:45.201 --> 01:32:48.740
like Afro Wig saw my guy,
right?
He's the crazy guy.

1527
01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:53.240
And right off the bat that was just something off about the guy and I couldn't

1528
01:32:53.241 --> 01:32:56.540
figure out what he started clapping and rocking back and forth.

1529
01:32:56.541 --> 01:33:01.010
And I just thought it was the typical white dude with no rhythm.
And uh,

1530
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:02.870
it just got progressively,

1531
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:08.480
it first it was funny and then you realize that the guy was mildly,
uh,

1532
01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:12.830
what is the politically correct term for a target?
Mildly mentally challenged.

1533
01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:18.230
And uh,
every once in a while a cheerleader,
a male cheerleader,

1534
01:33:18.231 --> 01:33:22.880
would come by.
By the way,
what's worse,
a male stewardess or cheerleader,

1535
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:26.250
if you were a father,
which one would you be more disappointed?
Um,

1536
01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:30.930
male cheerleader comes by and he goes,
all right,
we're going to do an eight clap.

1537
01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:34.440
And I guess they got this chair and they just go,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,

1538
01:33:34.441 --> 01:33:39.000
seven,
eight.
You see,
Eh,
like you see la fight,
fight,
fight.

1539
01:33:39.001 --> 01:33:40.530
That's like that,
that fucking Shit,
right?

1540
01:33:40.710 --> 01:33:44.040
So he comes out and he brings this sign and he goes,
all right everybody,

1541
01:33:44.041 --> 01:33:45.330
we're going to do an eight count.

1542
01:33:45.450 --> 01:33:49.410
And this fucking dude who's like literally almost 50 years old and he has this

1543
01:33:49.411 --> 01:33:53.180
really high pitched voice with the Blue Afro.
He just gets up.
He goes,
I know.

1544
01:33:53.181 --> 01:33:58.181
And I know and I know and I know it starts doing the chair with the male

1545
01:33:59.371 --> 01:34:03.930
cheerleader and uh,
what is the word for that?
That laugh,

1546
01:34:04.170 --> 01:34:08.220
that auto political correctness.
You're not laughing because the person is uh,

1547
01:34:08.221 --> 01:34:12.870
you know,
got some issues.
You know,
they have a,
for the grace of God go,
I,

1548
01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:16.080
but what he's doing is fucking hilarious.

1549
01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:19.830
Like when the other team would go to take a foul shot,
you know,
people,

1550
01:34:19.831 --> 01:34:21.210
if they yell and they scream,

1551
01:34:21.450 --> 01:34:25.110
he would get up and he would that we would like 10 feet behind the bucket like

1552
01:34:25.111 --> 01:34:27.180
that.
And that whole area was wide open for the cheerleaders.

1553
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:32.510
He would walk up there and just be like jumping up and down like an absolute

1554
01:34:32.731 --> 01:34:37.440
fucking spectacle.
And I swear to God,
he was actually,
he was so fucked up,

1555
01:34:37.441 --> 01:34:40.650
he was actually making people miss their shots.

1556
01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:44.220
Well cause this old lady was like really annoyed because she had season tickets.

1557
01:34:44.221 --> 01:34:45.990
She's like,
he comes here every game,

1558
01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:50.820
he's here every game and he thinks he takes credit when they miss.
And I wasn't,

1559
01:34:50.821 --> 01:34:52.410
you know,
I respect old people too.

1560
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:56.280
And I also don't like making fun of people who are mentally,
uh,
you know,

1561
01:34:56.340 --> 01:35:00.110
challenged.
But,
you know,
it was,
it was a fucking situation there,
right.

1562
01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:01.340
I'm trying not to fucking laugh,

1563
01:35:01.341 --> 01:35:04.940
but the guy was hilarious and he was literally making people miss their shots.

1564
01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.081
And,
uh,

1565
01:35:06.081 --> 01:35:10.370
you know what the fun of the whole thing was was when he would walk up to people

1566
01:35:10.670 --> 01:35:13.840
that they,
that you know,
didn't know him.
It just watching them,

1567
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:18.200
the look on their faces as they slowly figured it out.
Like they're like,
well,

1568
01:35:18.201 --> 01:35:22.400
what's with this guy?
Is he drunk?
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
okay.

1569
01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:26.270
And then they would sort of look down and some people would engage and they

1570
01:35:26.271 --> 01:35:28.790
would shake his hand and be like,
hello.
But then it was,

1571
01:35:28.791 --> 01:35:32.090
became this conversation that you couldn't get out of a,

1572
01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:34.340
but I have to admit to one of my ears is fucked up.
And his,

1573
01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:37.100
his voice was so fucking loud.
Um,

1574
01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:40.090
I think he actually furthered my fucking tinnitus.

1575
01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:45.470
So if you go to a UCLA game and,
uh,
even if they lose,

1576
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:49.100
um,
you,
you're going to get a fucking show because that dude is,

1577
01:35:49.101 --> 01:35:51.830
he's absolutely hilarious.
I think his name is Steve.

1578
01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:54.830
I don't know why I'm not making fun of the fucking guy.
I guess I kind of was,

1579
01:35:54.831 --> 01:35:57.830
but I don't know.
I should,
I should have tapped out like 10 minutes ago.

1580
01:35:57.831 --> 01:36:00.050
I probably shouldn't have told that fucking story cause I actually had a good

1581
01:36:00.051 --> 01:36:00.800
time.

1582
01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.830
<v 6>Legendary or Nina
just talking to my son at this point.</v>

1583
01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:32.170
Sure.
