17
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.970
It's like a Johnny Cash song.

18
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.200

So that's why.
So now,

24
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.150

I got some shit to talk about it then,
then I got to,

25
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.560
you don't want me fucked up.
You know when you get the thing,
you know,

26
00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:47.440
you get the registration every year for your car and then you get the little

27
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.350
sticker to put on your plate.
I'm usually so good about that.

28
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.150
I can't find the fucking stickers.

29
00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:56.250
And today's the day to day is the cradle it,

30
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.200

I'll get a fucking,
oh,

31
00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:03.850

So,

32
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:04.570
Jesus,

33
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.650
if I gotta go back down to the fucking TMV I know it's somewhere under that

34
00:02:08.651 --> 00:02:12.160
mountain of shit on my,
my,
my desk right now.

35
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.840
Did you guys have used to read that fucking

36
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.800
comic strip about that fat bird shoe?
Boom.

37
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.670
Mumord his desk looked like that's what my desk looks like right now.

38
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.730
So I got a Wa I gotta get that fixed.
You guys check that out,

39
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:29.731
that fucking cartoon check comic Strip from newspapers that nobody even fucking

40
00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:34.600
reads anymore.
It's good.
That's,
that's a nice,
that's a nice visual.

41
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.310
You know when you were in a visual medium bill,

42
00:02:36.311 --> 00:02:41.110
it's always good to bring up a comic strip from 30 fucking years ago.
Sorry,

43
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.550
I'm a little grumpy from a little grumpy from flying here.
Um,
oh.

44
00:02:45.551 --> 00:02:46.600
Speaking of flying,
right.

45
00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:51.270
So I flew to Chicago and then had to get on a puddle jumper,
um,

46
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.600
for the funeral.
And uh,
I was sitting next to this guy,
he had a hat on that said,

47
00:02:55.601 --> 00:03:00.080
I love Jesus.
He had on Pete Carroll,
Khakis is old guy,

48
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.520
<v 2>thin as a rail.</v>

49
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.940
And he was reading this religious book and I swear to God he was underlining

50
00:03:04.941 --> 00:03:08.720
almost every fucking sentence.
And then he was writing shit down next to me.

51
00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.750
Right.
We'll like shoulder to shoulder and this little,
uh,

52
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.960
this little puddle jumper.
Hang on,
hang on one second.
What's the matter?

53
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.110
You got to ask me something.
I'll hit pause.
Hold on.
Hang on.
The lovely Nia.

54
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:20.944
Hold on.
Okay.

55
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.000
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.850
<v 2>All right.
I really wish I recorded that because I actually was right for once.</v>

57
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.170
Um,
anyways,
so anyways,
the guys get to Pete Carroll,

58
00:03:30.171 --> 00:03:34.550
fucking dark is on thin Israelis underlying this religious thing.
Okay.

59
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.910
And I'm just sitting there.
The old me would be like,
we'll all JJ,
as you know,

60
00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:40.370
this guy with his religion.
I was actually sitting there going,
you know what?

61
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.120
I bet he's a great guy.
I mean,
he's a decent human being and a,
this keeps him,

62
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.220
keeps him that way.
So God bless him.
And right as I had that positive thought,

63
00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:53.840
all of a sudden this fucking guy,
I know it was him.
I don't know it was him,

64
00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:58.200
but I'm pretty sure it was him.
He just fucking just lets this old man Fargo,

65
00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.650
<v 3>yeah.</v>

66
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.210
<v 2>Dead.
It just smells like,</v>

67
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.600
just imagine farting in an attic is the only way.

68
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.220
The only way to describe it.
It was like moth balls,

69
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.250
old toys [inaudible] greatest generation fart.

70
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.310
And I'm like,
oh my God.
Like I didn't even try to hide it.

71
00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:25.030
I just put I s I literally said,
Oh my God.
And I put my shirt over my nose.

72
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.913
Right.

73
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.660
<v 3>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.050
<v 2>In a fucking goes away.
He doesn't even address,</v>

75
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.480
this is a 50 minute fucking flight.

76
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.113
<v 3>All right?</v>

77
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.140
<v 2>We're going up.
We're coming right back down.
It's like we're going to Vegas,</v>

78
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:40.930
except I'm going to a funeral,
so it's not a fucking fun time.

79
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.310
And this fucking guy,
all right.
Right.
As we reached cruising altitude,

80
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.600
he does it again.
He rips another one.

81
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.080
<v 3>Okay.</v>

82
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.710
<v 2>And I'm like,</v>

83
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.250
I'm staring at the side of his head and I know we can feel me and he won't

84
00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:58.040
fucking look at him and he's still underlining all this,
you know,

85
00:04:58.041 --> 00:05:02.860
fucking Jesus Shit.
And I like that.
You gotta be fucking kidding,
Dude.

86
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:04.090
It was ungodly.

87
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.880
<v 3>Okay.</v>

88
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.240
<v 2>Hard boiled eggs in a fucking outhouse.</v>

89
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.980
All right?
It was fucking horrific.

90
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.850
<v 3>Okay.</v>

91
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.890
<v 2>And I know it was him,
you know,</v>

92
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:18.290
I know it was him because the smell was so fucking bad and he was sitting and

93
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.120
not reacting to shit.
All right.
I don't know if he was turning the other cheek,

94
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.040
some religious shit,
no pun intended there.

95
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.360
I don't know what the fuck he was doing,

96
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.110
but I am 99% sure that it was him and I'm like,

97
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:33.630
what the fuck to her,
this would be unacceptable in a cross country flight,

98
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.260
New York to La.
This guy has done this on a puddle jumper.
50 minute flight.

99
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.410
<v 3>Okay.</v>

100
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.760
<v 2>Leaving Chicago.
Right.
Then we started to descend and this motherfucker.</v>

101
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.493
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

102
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.610
<v 2>three fucking times and at this point,
50 minutes now I got to Fart and I'm like,</v>

103
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:54.760
God,
you want,
you want to fucking play?
Oh Man.
Do you want to dance?

104
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.090
I'm ready to fucking rip two bike.

105
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.590
<v 0>I couldn't get myself to do it cause I'm like,
what if?
What if it is in him?</v>

106
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.190
What if he's so fucking old?
He can't smell anything anymore.

107
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.630
Oh my God.
It had to have been him because the people in front of me,

108
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.440
a young dude,
this fucking guy,
man,
Jesus Christ,

109
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.570
Jesus fucking Christ,
this guy like

110
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.030
three times in a 50 minute fucking flight.

111
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.630
Do you know what that reminded me of?
I remember this guy one time,

112
00:06:27.631 --> 00:06:32.631
I did this showcase down at the comedy store to do,

113
00:06:33.121 --> 00:06:36.660
be able to do a half hour on showtime or HBO was huge.

114
00:06:36.661 --> 00:06:40.380
This was like 12 years ago,
and I'm living in New York and I'm like,
oh my God,

115
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.720
this is it.
This is getting a make or break me.
So it's a fucking showcase.

116
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.230
All right?
First of all,
I got to fly myself out there.

117
00:06:49.231 --> 00:06:52.230
So already I'm out of pocket already.

118
00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:54.990
This is something that I totally won and now I'm out of pocket.

119
00:06:54.991 --> 00:06:56.700
I got to pay for this fucking plane ticket.

120
00:06:56.701 --> 00:07:00.720
I had to cancel money gigs and I fly out to do this fucking thing.

121
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.810
I've got to put myself up,
get the rental car,
the whole fucking thing,

122
00:07:03.811 --> 00:07:08.250
hemorrhaging cash.
But this is big pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,
right?

123
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.180
So it's down at the comedy store in the early two thousands and I fucking show

124
00:07:14.461 --> 00:07:18.120
up and this like fucking five people in the crowd.

125
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.303
All right?

126
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.030
There was two white people and then there was this black guy sitting in between

127
00:07:24.031 --> 00:07:27.120
these two white girls,
and I go on first,

128
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.590
I fucking go up there and I'm up there and the whole time up there,

129
00:07:31.591 --> 00:07:34.970
the black guy is talking to the two white girls and they laugh and,
and Blah,

130
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:39.270
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
So you know,
I'm addressing it.
I'm addressing it going,
Oh,

131
00:07:39.271 --> 00:07:39.961
this is great,
man.

132
00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:43.590
Flew all the way across the country to do a half hour in front of five people.

133
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.500
How I did a few more jokes,
little bits of laughter.

134
00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:48.210
I'm just addressing what's going on,
right?

135
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.310
So I get off completely like,
yeah,
Jesus Christ,
like this is fucking rhythm.

136
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.580
It's not,
it's not even a fucking showcase.

137
00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.790
Who's fucking bullshit is what it was.

138
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.290
I go to the back and I stand out a little hallway and the guy running the thing

139
00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:08.850
comes out to me,
all right,
the big shot running the thing and he just goes,

140
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.110
he goes seven times,
said,

141
00:08:13.111 --> 00:08:14.520
this is how it remind me of the far thing.

142
00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:16.950
When I said three times in a 50 minute flight,
this guy fired.

143
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.020
This guy goes to me cause seven times,

144
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:25.020
seven times and a and had whatever it was,
10 minutes said 15 minutes set,

145
00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:26.130
whatever the fuck I had to do.

146
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.720
I can say it didn't have to do the whole half hour.

147
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.760
I probably just had to do with shit.
It's a showcase,
right?
Yeah.

148
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.290
Probably like 10 15 minutes.
He could seven times.
He did 15 minutes set.

149
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.310
You addressed how few people were in the crowd,

150
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.940
you know you say that enough time,
the people in the crowd like,
yeah,

151
00:08:41.941 --> 00:08:44.730
I mean what are we doing here and they're going to leave.

152
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.200
It's like we're in the back.
We can hear the material.
Who?
Blue,
blue,
blue,
blue,

153
00:08:49.201 --> 00:08:53.640
blue and he's just fucking sitting and I'm just looking at the guy and he goes,

154
00:08:53.641 --> 00:08:55.610
don't worry,
don't worry.
He goes,
she's still in the running.

155
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.360
You still in the running to get a special and that's what I wanted to grab him

156
00:08:59.361 --> 00:09:01.980
by the throat and rip out his fucking voicebox.

157
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.160
Do you mean I'm still in the running you fat con?

158
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.100
Do you think I'm fucking stand in here.

159
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.120
Wait for you to tap me on the head with your magic wand.
You can make it now.

160
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.830
Sprinkle your little fairy dust on me.
Oh,
now I'm valid.
You stupid cunt.

161
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.340
This is your fucking showcase.
You fucked up.

162
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.840
You should have packed the fucking room.

163
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.200
Aren't supposed to do stand up in front of five.
Fuck,
I wish I said that,

164
00:09:24.201 --> 00:09:25.034
but I did.

165
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.300
I just sat there and took it the same way I took it from that fucking old man.

166
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.590
I don't give a shit if he fought in world war two,

167
00:09:32.591 --> 00:09:36.790
if he wasn't on the front fucking lines with a flame thrower,
fuck him.

168
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:38.930
<v 3>Okay.</v>

169
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.460
<v 0>Fucking people into Jesus.</v>

170
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.050
Is that what Jesus teaches you the fucking far three times on a 50 minute puddle

171
00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:50.010
jumper and not even address it?
You was fucking funny to.

172
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.250
The air is pressurized to it's a lot fucking thinner when you're up there,
right?

173
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:57.360
So I bet I was spreading out even further.
Wasn't all packed in,
you know,

174
00:09:57.361 --> 00:10:00.420
you're fart.
You're fired if fucking sea level.
You know what I mean?

175
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.600
You got a little
there.

176
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.230
The little more compact,
right?
I might be off here,

177
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.680
but you know that you don't think when you have an empty water bottle with the

178
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:14.190
cap on it,
right?
As you start to descend,
it starts to implode,
right?

179
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:17.980
Cause cause the air and the outside is more fucking dance.

180
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.430
It's got to fill up that space.

181
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.200
So this guy farted like inside that fucking dead fucking bottled water.

182
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:26.310
Empty bottle of water.

183
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:28.280
<v 3>Okay.</v>

184
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.630
<v 0>Nothing but open fucking lanes.
Oh God.
It's so fucking gross.</v>

185
00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:37.631
Do you realize when you're smelling somebody far that was air that was trapped

186
00:10:38.061 --> 00:10:42.260
in there?
Fucking guts.
That's what the fuck.
And now it's in you.

187
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.053
It's in you.

188
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.260
It went into your bloodstream and it's fuel in your fucking body and going up to

189
00:10:48.261 --> 00:10:52.690
your brain.
This fucking guy's Korean wharf,

190
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:57.770
Korean conflict farts three fucking times.
And every time I'd look at him like,

191
00:10:57.771 --> 00:11:01.130
what the fuck I'd see on the corner of was on the corner of his brill.
It said,

192
00:11:01.131 --> 00:11:02.270
I love Jesus.

193
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.670
<v 3>Okay,</v>

194
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.930
<v 0>I love Jesus.
What do I know?
Fucking farden.</v>

195
00:11:08.931 --> 00:11:12.770
Here you go.
Go.
Oh my God.
You know,
I actually wanted to do,

196
00:11:12.771 --> 00:11:15.590
I wanted to reach down and pretend like I was going to tie my shoes like in

197
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.470
Schwartzenegger in a raw deal when he elbowed dead fucking black dude and they

198
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:21.650
put the fucking Panama Jack Hat on his head.

199
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.650
Dante interrupt my friend,
he's dead tired.
You don't remember that.

200
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.740
Then he climbed down the landing gear.
I would have done that.

201
00:11:29.741 --> 00:11:32.500
Landed right and fucking Lake Michigan.
You know,

202
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.580
I don't give a fuck hypothermia.
Then I sink to the bottom.

203
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.210
Michigan doesn't give up its dead Lake Michigan does not give up.
It's dead.

204
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.750
You go down.
That's it.
They never see again.
But you don't get eaten by a shark.

205
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.300
You just sorta teeth chatter for awhile.
Then you get that warm,
peaceful feeling,

206
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.120
you know
and you wish like,
oh,

207
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.810
<v 4>you know,
maybe I didn't kill that.
I love Jesus guy.</v>

208
00:11:57.811 --> 00:12:01.770
Wish I read that book and I had that hat and I had those fucking pants on and

209
00:12:01.771 --> 00:12:03.690
that's stupid old man jacket he had.

210
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.170
God knows he's going to go to the pearly gates he's getting in second.

211
00:12:07.171 --> 00:12:09.100
He walks in.
Yeah.

212
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.290
<v 0>You know,
it's funny,
he probably has like a fucking</v>

213
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.390
lining at Jack was probably made out of some fucking big girls back skin.
Right.

214
00:12:18.391 --> 00:12:22.240
Some fucking serial killer.
Maybe that's what I was smelling.

215
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.060
We're going to fucking body partners.
God Damn fucking suck.
Um,
anyways,

216
00:12:27.061 --> 00:12:29.010
so I'm back from the Midwest.

217
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:30.450
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

218
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:34.260
<v 0>Um,
yeah.
My uncle passed away as I match of what of what a great guy man.</v>

219
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.200
What an absolute,
so it was weird.

220
00:12:37.201 --> 00:12:39.690
It's one of those funerals that was sad and uplifting because you knew the guy

221
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:40.620
lived a great life,

222
00:12:40.621 --> 00:12:42.840
but everyone was so sad that we weren't going to see him again.

223
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.460
And a and enough time had passed between me sit next to the Guy Fart in his

224
00:12:47.461 --> 00:12:50.700
fucking brains out.
Maybe he's so old.

225
00:12:50.701 --> 00:12:52.500
He couldn't control it and he was embarrassed,
you know,

226
00:12:52.501 --> 00:12:53.880
when he had like those depends on,

227
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.090
I know he didn't shoot himself if he shit himself,

228
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.880
like the fucking goddamn windows would have blown out on the thing.

229
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.630
So anyway,
so let's,
let's get on with the Thursday.
How's your week going?

230
00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.140
That's how my week was going,
you know.
Um,

231
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.980
<v 4>okay.</v>

232
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.450
<v 0>I'm getting ready to do this fucking tour,</v>

233
00:13:12.451 --> 00:13:15.570
get some acting work next week and I can't find the stickers to put on my

234
00:13:15.571 --> 00:13:19.440
license plate.
So,
uh,
we've got a lot of bullshit going on.
But,
uh,

235
00:13:19.441 --> 00:13:21.360
you know what I did get a chance to do when I was flying back,

236
00:13:21.361 --> 00:13:25.770
I got to watch the uh,
the Astros and the royals series.

237
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.220
Um,
it's always hard to tell in the first game when it's going to be like,

238
00:13:29.221 --> 00:13:32.700
cause somebody is usually bring it.
There's usually one unhittable fucking guy.

239
00:13:32.701 --> 00:13:37.350
Right?
And you have no idea.
But you know what was great was Fox sports,

240
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.120
they got Pete rose doing the analysis.
He was fucking crushing it.

241
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.850
Just totally be in Pete rose.

242
00:13:44.851 --> 00:13:48.260
He's like the guy I met when I ever tell you guys that story when I had him a

243
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.800
sign,
those photos,
you know,
he,
he's usually,
it's Caesar's.
Any sides.
Right.

244
00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:57.300
And I was with La head and I was like,
fuck man,
it's greatest hitter of all time.

245
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.220
Right.
And how much does he wish that he created?

246
00:14:01.221 --> 00:14:06.180
Draft Kings or fan duel,
you know,
awesome.
That would be,

247
00:14:06.181 --> 00:14:10.670
and then he became a fucking billionaire.
Unbelievable.

248
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.730
You know how fan duel and draft kings are fucking up right now?

249
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.540
If they just admitted that they were gambling,
the whole thing would go away.

250
00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:21.020
Other than that,
there's no story.
That stupid scandal where they go,

251
00:14:21.021 --> 00:14:23.690
they had inside information and people,

252
00:14:23.691 --> 00:14:27.320
he'd fucking draft kings gambled,

253
00:14:27.321 --> 00:14:29.750
true fan duel and made hundreds of thousands of dollars.

254
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.330
What insight information could you have?

255
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.180
Did they pay off a referee?

256
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.370
How do you get inside information?

257
00:14:38.371 --> 00:14:41.070
Are they talking to somebody there or who plays in a league?

258
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.330
Some quarterback for some team,
they pay him off to win a couple hundred grand.

259
00:14:46.331 --> 00:14:48.670
Doesn't make any.
If they didn't have any fucking inside information,

260
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.680
there's no fucking way they did.
They didn't.

261
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.300
They just had the decency to not gamble within their own site.

262
00:14:56.301 --> 00:15:00.800
They went to another one and they fucking one.
That's all right.

263
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.750
I saw the guy who runs draftkings.

264
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:07.040
He was on TV trying to explain why draft kings is a game of skill versus betting

265
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:09.920
against the line.
He goes,
well,
if you bet against the line,

266
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:12.960
it's 50 50 you know you either win or you lose.

267
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:17.060
It's like it's not 50 50 have you ever gambled in your life?

268
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.070
You bet against the spread.
You loose,
you can win that week.

269
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:25.260
But if it's 50 50 why would there even be a sports book?

270
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:29.240
So we keep handing back the same fucking hundred bucks over and over again.

271
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.690
And then he was like,
Whoa,
this thing,
you know,
if,

272
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.210
if you just go pick a bunch of players,
you don't know what you're doing.

273
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.140
Someone who has better skill than you will win every time.

274
00:15:39.141 --> 00:15:41.600
Like that's the loophole,
which is fucking true.

275
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:45.590
But it's still gambling because in the end it's like,
yeah.

276
00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:47.630
And then when I lose to that guy,

277
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.250
I lose money because I wage heard that I was going to be better than them.

278
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.920
What an all comes down to is why they gave me shit and why they stopped

279
00:15:57.921 --> 00:16:00.560
advertising on here is they didn't want me to call it gambling even though they

280
00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:04.730
knew it was fucking gambling because they fucking want to stay in business with

281
00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:07.340
the leaks.
And the leagues,

282
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.760
the fucking whores that they are,

283
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:15.680
are trying to scoop up all this easy fucking money through gambling as they brow

284
00:16:15.681 --> 00:16:20.150
beat their own fucking players about it,
that we know,
which,
whatever.

285
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.910
I mean that's,
that's the American fucker.
It's actually the human way.

286
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.900
But to sit there has to be,
to be as transparent assistance.

287
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.250
It's just obviously be what the fuck it is.
And this,

288
00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.910
they sit there and be an apple and sit there.
But yeah,
no,
no,
I'm a,

289
00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:36.740
I'm a fucking banana.
You're not,
none of it's,

290
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.990
it's,
I'm,
I'm not a fruit.
I'm a banana.
Apple,
you know,
you just,

291
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:45.740
you use can bite right into it and you're right to the fruit,
a banana,

292
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:49.970
you got to appeal it,
the fruits on the inside.
So it's,
it's,
it's not a fruit.

293
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.090
Um,
you know,

294
00:16:56.091 --> 00:17:00.470
I really think the biggest problem with fan duel and draft kings is that they,

295
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.950
uh,
the young people that all of us that came up with this thing,

296
00:17:03.951 --> 00:17:06.440
and now both those companies are worth $1 billion each.

297
00:17:06.441 --> 00:17:10.550
And I think this is so young and so came out of nowhere that they didn't know

298
00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:15.551
what palms to Greece when you're in a national gambling site,

299
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.721
you know what I mean?

300
00:17:17.721 --> 00:17:21.440
There's all kinds of fucking town cars that have to pull up and you gotta be

301
00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:25.430
handing them a little packages of fucking money and blah blah blah blah blah.

302
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:29.510
So everybody will look the uh,
the fucking way,
you know what I mean?

303
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:33.850
Cause his bad is what fan duel and draft kings are doing.
What the,

304
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:38.120
what those fucking cancer awareness people are doing.
All right.

305
00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:41.990
And people that get in bed with them and they sell it to you as though by this

306
00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:46.420
pink Jersey and all the money from this,
the,
when they say a portion,
I mean you,

307
00:17:46.421 --> 00:17:49.010
you think more money than not,

308
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:53.460
it's going to go towards actual cancer victims.
Right.

309
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:58.950
Then you find out it's like fucking 8% and then that 8% goes to the pink,

310
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.253
right?

311
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.400
And then she's got to make her 650 grand a fucking year and they got all their

312
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:09.350
infrastructure and it all trickles.
It's not even research,
it's just awareness.

313
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.840
The whole fucking thing is perverted.
So I don't know.

314
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:16.930
I still don't think it's as bad as what the pink ladies still with.

315
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.070
But I'll tell you right now,
the NFL man,
the walls are closing in.

316
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.830
You've got that pink horse shit going on.
On one side.

317
00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:27.240
You're in bed with the sports book,
right?
And nobody say shit.

318
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.820
Nobody's saying shit because you make ESPN so much fucking money and ESPN is

319
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:33.550
going to sit there.

320
00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:38.340
What are they going to talk about Tom Brady and fucking air pressure.
All right,

321
00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:41.250
I'd beaten that to fucking death.
Oh Jesus Christ.

322
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.110
Who would know better about hypocrisy?
That a fucking hypocrite like me.
Um,

323
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.720
how far into this?
All right,
let's read a little bit of advertising here.
Um,

324
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.740
the little that I have left,

325
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.430
the little that I have left on this show,

326
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:02.160
I have to hum my password.
I fuck it up.
There we go.
All right.

327
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.490
By the way,
is anybody wants to that show?
Uh Oh wait,

328
00:19:05.491 --> 00:19:08.550
I forgot the Pete rose story.
Sorry.
Let me get back to the Pete rose story.

329
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:12.990
Like three old guys just went
thought he was going to forget it.

330
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.510
Um,
all right.
The Pete Rose Story.
So he signing in Vegas,
Mila,

331
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.400
they were like,
that's the greatest hitter of all time.

332
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:21.810
We got to go talk to the guy.

333
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.660
So it works as you got to buy something that he then signs and then we'll

334
00:19:25.661 --> 00:19:30.570
fucking talk to you.
Fair enough.
You've got 4,100 more hits than I do.

335
00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:34.980
Apps a fucking lowly,
let's do it.
Right.
Um,
or whatever the fuck he has.

336
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.380
So there's two fucking,

337
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:42.650
almost identical pictures from the 1975 1976 world series with the big red

338
00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:45.120
machine.
Went back to back titles.

339
00:19:45.121 --> 00:19:48.630
They beat the red sox is seven games and then they beat the Yankees in four

340
00:19:48.631 --> 00:19:50.520
games.
And both of them,

341
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.330
like anybody who watched Pete rose play in his hay day,

342
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:58.140
the classic of him is him rounding second base.

343
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.320
His batting helmet flies off and then he dives headfirst into third base.

344
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.820
So the two photos,
one was of him doing it against the red sox.

345
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.880
Helmut was already live.
He's like superman in the air.

346
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.000
Diving in safely for a triple or whatever,

347
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.740
or first to third on a single to write.

348
00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:19.500
God knows Charlie Hustle probably did that.
What?
I don't know what it is.

349
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.580
All he know,
he's sliding into third safely.
The Yankees won same thing,

350
00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:28.320
helmet off,
diving in through the air,
going to be safe.
So I said,
hey man,

351
00:20:28.321 --> 00:20:31.380
I'm a red sox fan.
I got the red sox and the Yankees won.
I go,

352
00:20:31.381 --> 00:20:36.270
I'm on the red sox won.
Can you write bill?
I'm sorry,

353
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.163
Pete rose.

354
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:42.000
And he immediately just looked up at me with that fucking game seven look in his

355
00:20:42.001 --> 00:20:45.240
eyes when I said,
can you say I'm sorry.
He just looked at me and he goes,
I'm not,

356
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.050
and I laughed and he still wrote it.
And then when I wrote,

357
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.710
I told him to write on the Yankees won to write bill,
you're welcome.

358
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.280
Then he laughed and he understood the joke and then we started,

359
00:20:57.281 --> 00:21:00.080
we actually got to talk to him a little bit and uh,

360
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.650
that nobody likes talking baseball,
like a guy like that,
man.

361
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.730
I mean to be able to hit the way that guy fucking hit you are literally an

362
00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:11.710
encyclopedia.
Him,
Tony Gwynn,
Ted Williams,
Wade Boggs,

363
00:21:11.711 --> 00:21:14.620
all the great hitters of all time.
That's what kills me about each year.
Oh Man.

364
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:17.430
Like I wish I can understand the guy better cause I would love to listen to
that.

365
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.440
Like to me it's Badass is,
is hitting a home run.

366
00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:22.630
Hitting for fucking average is the coolest fucking thing ever.

367
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.853
You know what I mean?

368
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.700
Those big guys that fucking hit home runs and everybody stands on the same side

369
00:21:27.701 --> 00:21:29.680
of the field because they know we can't do anything else other than,

370
00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:31.660
than pull the fucking ball.
You know?

371
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:36.790
I like those guys sprayed all over the fucking field.
Um,

372
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:41.770
like they're like,
they're like the porn stars
of hitters,
right?

373
00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.950
Just fucking spray sprayed all over the place.
So anyways,

374
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.400
we actually got to talk to them about,
I'm like,
you know,

375
00:21:48.401 --> 00:21:51.970
who's the toughest guy you've ever had to pitch against?

376
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:56.410
And he actually asked us to guess because it's the same time,
you know,
he's,

377
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.140
he's just like,
well,
I'm not going to tell his fucking story again.
You know,

378
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.690
when I have a little fun with this,
let me test you baseball knowledge.

379
00:22:01.691 --> 00:22:05.710
So we were trying to think of everybody.
We like,
uh,
uh,
Don Drysdale,

380
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:11.150
Nolan Ryan,
uh,
fucking uh,
what's his face?
Tom See,

381
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.380
oh,
I guess the guy,
uh,
fuck's his name from Saint Louis,
Bob Gibson.

382
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.650
And he was like,
nope,
nope.
Went through the whole fucking thing and be like,
who?

383
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.000
And he said,
Sandy Kofax.
And we like,
really?
And he goes,
Oh yeah man.
He goes,

384
00:22:25.001 --> 00:22:26.270
his curve ball and then he,

385
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:31.270
he just imitated the flight of the ball and he hadn't basically almost on like

386
00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:34.810
an arch and then just fucking,
just,
just dropping off the table.

387
00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:38.740
And he did it like on both sides.
Like it was like,
it didn't matter if you will,

388
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:41.110
right handed or left handed.
And Pete was a switch hitter,

389
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:42.460
if I remember correctly.
It's like,

390
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:44.470
it didn't matter what side of the plate he stood on.

391
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.700
The shit came in like it was in your fucking wheel house and then it just

392
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:51.370
fucking disappeared.
So,
um,

393
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.920
as much as I know,

394
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.060
anytime I cannot watch ESPN just to give somebody else a chance,

395
00:22:58.061 --> 00:23:00.760
even though Fox is fucking huge.
It's not like there's some mom and pop,

396
00:23:00.761 --> 00:23:03.520
I'll do it,
but I love that he's on there.
Um,

397
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.500
even though they got that big weird dragnet looking guy who's just going like,

398
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.130
hello people,
this is a TV show.
He does like that type of humor.
It's like,

399
00:23:12.131 --> 00:23:15.790
you know,
God,
he looks like a fucking,

400
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.680
he looks like a,
a beat cop from like 1955.

401
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:25.690
He should be outside Ebbets field.
Um,
just really loud.

402
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.680
That's like those two guys that come on and the camera's fucking move in.
Like,

403
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:34.060
oh,
something exciting is happening.
We got,
we got to be beyond the highlights.

404
00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:34.660
Everybody,

405
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:38.140
we've got to put her own stamps on the sports shelf that doing that fucking

406
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:41.720
thing.
So,
um,
I dunno,

407
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.070
or at least comes on late and I'm like halfway pass it out and they're fucking

408
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.310
screaming and yelling

409
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.010
<v 2>like Trey Wingo at his worst.
You know,</v>

410
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:52.800
Trey Wingo has got Sarah fucking sound in his voice.
We just like,
dude,

411
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.570
you're relaxed.
You're not playing.
Just,
just read the fucking highlights for you.

412
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.160
Um,
or whatever the fuck it is.
You do not read the highlights.
What is,
what is,

413
00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.970
is it that they do?
What is it that I do?
Well,
what does anybody fucking though?

414
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.760
Um,
Oh,
before I do the advertising here,
I got to go off on this fucking thing.
Uh,

415
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:14.200
my wife has gotten me to start watching that shark tank thing and uh,

416
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.240
I fucking hate that show.
All right.
And He'd have these young,

417
00:24:17.241 --> 00:24:20.300
fresh faced kids come in and these fucking jerk offs act like they're the

418
00:24:20.301 --> 00:24:24.080
biggest geniuses ever.
You know what I mean?
They're all billionaires,
right?

419
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.190
They in then just the shit that they say is so fucking evil,
you know?

420
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.840
First of all,
Mark Cuban's sits there and it looks like the not shark tank.

421
00:24:32.841 --> 00:24:34.940
I was joking.
I go,
this looks like drunk tank.

422
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.520
The Guy fucking sits there and when he's listening,

423
00:24:37.521 --> 00:24:41.600
he's slouching and he's got that fucking a full metal jacket.

424
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:44.210
I am in a world of Shit.

425
00:24:44.211 --> 00:24:48.410
He like looks up to his eyebrows and his mouth is like half open.

426
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.280
Um,
although it's funny,
I love how heartless they are where they're just like,

427
00:24:52.281 --> 00:24:55.640
okay,
this is a security thing.
And he goes,
what's your background in security?

428
00:24:55.641 --> 00:24:58.370
He goes,
oh,
I don't have a background.
And he just goes,
I'm out.

429
00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:03.620
I love when they do shit like that.
But the,
uh,
the bald con there when he goes,

430
00:25:03.621 --> 00:25:07.670
um,
these two fresh face girls come on,
right?

431
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.620
And uh,
they come on and they say that the,

432
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:12.750
I don't know what the fuck they make it,

433
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.320
but all I know is whatever they're making cost four bucks,

434
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.600
that's what they sell it for.
And it costs $3 to make it.
And then baldy comes in.

435
00:25:20.601 --> 00:25:25.340
He's like,
oh,
hey,
well,
let me know how do we get it?
$1,

436
00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.330
make it for $1 and then I get three fucking dollars,
you know,

437
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:33.590
and they put that pressure on the kids and that right there is how fucking

438
00:25:33.591 --> 00:25:35.360
factories leave this country.

439
00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.860
And you've got some crying eight year old making it for fucking 2 cents,

440
00:25:38.861 --> 00:25:40.940
that God damn month that.

441
00:25:40.941 --> 00:25:44.720
And also unions totally took advantage of their position.
We're miserable.

442
00:25:44.721 --> 00:25:48.500
Cons to fucking have to deal with both of those things.
So I don't like,

443
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.880
I don't like the whole fucking thing.
Hey,

444
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:52.350
we're going to come up with a great idea and a,

445
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:56.840
you're going to fucking buy in and basically own the thing in the,
the whole,

446
00:25:56.841 --> 00:25:59.960
the shark tank,
like,
like they're not on some level,

447
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.970
reprehensible human beings taking advantage of fresh faced kids.
You know,

448
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:07.460
I really oversimplified all of that.
And you know what?

449
00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:12.200
I love that I did very little information,
very poor business background.

450
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.520
You know,
Mark Cuban's my favorite part on the show,

451
00:26:16.521 --> 00:26:21.290
just w I don't know what his resting faces,
but uh,

452
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.730
I can't believe he's not going,
Eh,
Eh,
Eh,

453
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.420
when he's sitting there,
cause that's what his face looks like.
Um,
all right,

454
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.900
so let's read some advertising.

455
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:40.940
Uh,
all right,
blue apron,
everybody.
Blue Apron.

456
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.740
How much is the apron?
How much?
How can we make it

457
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.990
<v 0>be fucking 2 cents to make the apron and then I,
I get eh,
Eh,</v>

458
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:53.910
I get all of the rest of it.
All right.
Blue Apron.
It's okay.

459
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:55.740
It's okay.
You can admit it.

460
00:26:55.741 --> 00:26:59.190
The last thing anybody wants to do after work is wait in line at the grocery

461
00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:02.970
store,
Schlep home and cook a complicated meal and expensive,

462
00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:06.720
unhealthy takeout is hardly better.
Tell me about it.
And I was on the road.

463
00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:09.900
I ate steak and shake.
Oh,
Billy is going in the wrong direction.

464
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.630
I could have turned this around.
Maybe I should use blue apron.

465
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.570
That's where the new servers,
blue apron comes in.
Yeah.

466
00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:19.440
If you come home and you're tired and you sat next to some old guy fart and next

467
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:22.500
to you for the whole time,
you're going to end up at steak and shake.
Right?

468
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.940
But who wants to do that?

469
00:27:23.941 --> 00:27:28.070
Then you stare at your white alabaster freckle belly the next morning and you're

470
00:27:28.071 --> 00:27:31.590
actually contemplate doing a sailor dive right on into the fucking scale.

471
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.960
If you want to avoid that,
go to blue apron.

472
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:38.990
Blue Apron delivers farm fresh ingredients and step by step recipes to your

473
00:27:39.331 --> 00:27:39.931
home.
By the way,

474
00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:43.140
sailor dive is when you jump in headfirst with your hands to your sides.

475
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.100
That's what I was taught down at the pool.
Um,

476
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.990
allowing you to back when they actually had deep ends in pools,

477
00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:54.000
allowing you to create healthy handcrafted meals at home without going to the

478
00:27:54.001 --> 00:27:54.670
grocery store.

479
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:59.040
Now it's just like deep enough or your man tits there under the surface for less

480
00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:03.690
than $10 per meal.
Blue Apron sends you fresh ingredients,
perfectly proportioned,

481
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.570
making,
cooking healthy meals,
really easy and fun.

482
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.070
No trips to the grocery store and no waste from unused ingredients.

483
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.130
Plus you'll learn to cook with special ingredients.

484
00:28:14.131 --> 00:28:17.100
Specialty ingredients accuse me that are normally hard to find.

485
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.720
Blue Apron is perfect.

486
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:24.210
It's perfect for date night cooking with friends and they even offer family

487
00:28:24.211 --> 00:28:27.840
plants with kid friendly ingredients so the whole family can eat well and have

488
00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:29.280
fun preparing the meals together.

489
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:34.170
Each balanced meal is 500 to 700 calories per serving and so tasty.

490
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.870
You'd never know.
Cooking takes half an hour.

491
00:28:36.871 --> 00:28:41.400
Shipping is flexible and free and the menus are always knew they won't send the

492
00:28:41.401 --> 00:28:42.480
same meal twice.

493
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.740
They work around your schedule and dietary preferences and blue apron experts

494
00:28:46.741 --> 00:28:51.000
source only the best seasonal ingredients for incredible meals like Parmesan

495
00:28:51.001 --> 00:28:56.001
crusted chicken with roasted heirloom potatoes and tomato [inaudible] salad and

496
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:02.640
10 dory spice chicken with green lentils is,
fuck it sounds delicious.

497
00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:06.540
I don't even know what that is.
Oh wait.
Oh wait.

498
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:10.470
Don't jump on the mix of Buddy eggplant and cucumber mint yogurt.

499
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.070
You'll cook incredible meals and be blown away by the quality and freshness.

500
00:29:14.071 --> 00:29:16.020
Blue Apron.
It's a better way to cook.

501
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:20.880
Check out this week's menu and get your first two meals for free by going to

What's their treat?

503
00:29:25.561 --> 00:29:30.370
Really the first two meals are on me when you go to blue apron.com/birth all

504
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.860
right,
we've got somebody new here.
We've got somebody new here.

505
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.210
Um,

506
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:41.210
club w club w don't you hate when wine looks like it's a 10 but winds

507
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.250
<v 2>up tasting like a six a that's what he said.
Huh?</v>

508
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:49.750
Away or even worse when you walk into the store to pick out your wine,

509
00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:54.030
you could easily be fooled into a situation just like this.
Well,
there's an,

510
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:58.060
there's this new wine club called Club dubby club.

511
00:29:58.061 --> 00:30:02.500
Dubby tear to find tear.
They change everything.

512
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:03.550
No more full,

513
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.510
no more being fooled by winds that pretend to be hotter or tastier than they

514
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:10.390
actually are.
It's easy.
You Go to club w.

515
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:14.560
Dot com and answer six simple questions their algorithm creates,

516
00:30:14.561 --> 00:30:15.610
I can't believe I said that right.

517
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.900
Their algorithm creates a palate profile just for you.

518
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.390
Then they send wine directly to your door,

519
00:30:22.391 --> 00:30:24.280
perfectly customized to match your tastes.

520
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:28.510
Club w is the leak is leading the grape to glass wine revolution.

521
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.510
They worked directly with vineyards to cut out the middleman,

522
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:35.440
which saves you money.
So with club Debbie five and tear,

523
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:36.821
uh,

524
00:30:36.821 --> 00:30:41.380
you get premium wine customized to your taste and a third of what you would pay

525
00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.540
at the store.
They even have a no risk,

526
00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:46.810
a hundred percent guarantee that you'll love what they send you.

527
00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.680
And right now clip Debbie buying land.

528
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:54.700
It sits on an aquifer because the population controls out of control.

529
00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.910
The populations out of control I'll get better at this,

530
00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:02.560
is offering my listeners 50% off your first order when they go to club.
Debbie,

531
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.540

Berg.

532
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.470
So stop wasting time and money messing around at retail stores and start

533
00:31:11.471 --> 00:31:14.320
drinking wine.
You know,
you're going to love.
Just go to club Debbie,

534
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.500
fool me once.
You're not going to fool me again.

535

Dot com slash Berg at 50% off your first order.

536
00:31:23.411 --> 00:31:28.411
That's club debbie.com and I'm just going to be toast club w.com/.

537
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.890
Bar.
That's actually great man.
Because you know something like at this point,

538
00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:37.891
like literally like the guy who directed after like a back to school has,

539
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.240
has his own wine.
You know what I mean?

540
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.450
The best wine that I ever had is a,

541
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:48.520
is a Barolo and a not the one that's more acidic.
It's more the,

542
00:31:48.521 --> 00:31:50.930
the fruity or one.
And um,

543
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:55.150
if you get a great bottle of the lab as for a Barola,
that's what I can tell you.

544
00:31:55.151 --> 00:31:56.800
Or you can go to blue apron.
Tell,

545
00:31:56.801 --> 00:32:01.801
tell him that you like a Barolo when you go to club Debbie Club W.

546
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:07.660
Um,
anyways.
All right,
let's,
let's,
let's finish up this podcast here.
Um,

547
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:13.030
where am I going here?
Oh,
let's talk hockey.
Hockey just started,
right?

548
00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:18.580
Hockey just started an hour.
Hey,
how about Rafi Torres setting the tone early.

549
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.680
Jesus Christ.
I wonder if they did that on um,
PTI.

550
00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.190
The best thing on ESPN.
I want to,
if they did,
happy Torah,
epic tours,

551
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.760
happy trails to Rafi Torres.
Jesus Christ.

552
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.360
Did he think because he glided the last 40 feet that he,
that,
that,

553
00:32:34.361 --> 00:32:38.530
that wasn't like 14 strides when he knocked that dude out.
Um,

554
00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:44.200
if you guys don't like Rafi Torres,
watch Adam McQuade first,
Rafi Torres,

555
00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:47.380
he handled his fucking business against that guy.
Um,

556
00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.340
and if you want to listen to somebody go off on Rafi Torres,

557
00:32:50.341 --> 00:32:55.050
listened to Joe Barton Ix.
Puck off.
I'm sure he had an epic rant on him.

558
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.320
And um,
oh,

559
00:32:58.321 --> 00:33:02.880
I wanted to talk about end zone celebrations when I put the,
put it,
put it on.

560
00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:06.690
I guess I don't hate ESPN because I like watching Steven A.
Smith and uh,

561
00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:12.150
uh,
what the fuck's his name there?
Willie.
The Wipper.

562
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.910
What the fuck's his name there?
Ah,
fuck.

563
00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:20.080
It's a little tick game show host name.
Great head of hair.

564
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:22.540
The fuck's his name?

565
00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.220
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

566
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.410
<v 2>Well I can think of,
is Chuck Light Dell?
I know it's not that.</v>

567
00:33:27.411 --> 00:33:30.590
What the fuck is his name?
Steven.
A Smith and

568
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:37.760
it's like,
whoa.
Wipie it's one of those fucking thing.

569
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.600
Yahoo one of those fucking names.
Take some yell on a rollercoaster,

570
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.490
but you don't,
if you would draw on it,
you would.
Anyway.

571
00:33:44.491 --> 00:33:47.420
So we're talking about end zone celebrations and Steve,
Steven A.

572
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.970
Smith was dancing around the fact that that,

573
00:33:49.971 --> 00:33:53.720
that there's a cultural racial race thing underneath there and a control by the

574
00:33:53.721 --> 00:33:58.480
NFL.
And uh,
the other fucking guy there,
I zippity Doo Dah,

575
00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.680
whatever his fucking name is,
was saying that it wasn't,

576
00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:05.860
and I think at 100% is 100% is all right when it comes to white and black people

577
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.090
like white people,
like when you score a touchdown,

578
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:13.960
you supposed to act like an astronaut and be like,
well,
ah,

579
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.020
I had a lot of help that now this is one small step.

580
00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:21.140
Provide team loud giant step for everybody else.
That's what you supposed to do,

581
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:25.910
Eh,
uh,
generally speaking,
black people more look at it like,
yeah,

582
00:34:25.911 --> 00:34:30.650
I did that shit.
Fuck you.
I'm unstoppable.
Right?

583
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.380
That's the opposite ends of the spectrum,

584
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.800
which I think if there was more white people that were unstoppable in sports,

585
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.180
the white people that ran the league would have less problem with the end zone

586
00:34:44.181 --> 00:34:48.380
dancing.
That's,
I mean I'm over simplifying the whole fucking thing.
But uh,

587
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:50.623
you know,
that is,

588
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:55.430
that is kind of a cultural difference where it's socially acceptable or the

589
00:34:55.431 --> 00:34:59.120
African American community that if you are the shit to say that you are the
shit.

590
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.720
If for some reason in the white community you supposed to tone it down,

591
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.200
even if you are the shit he supposed to be humble.
And I,

592
00:35:06.201 --> 00:35:11.201
what I think that really comes from is the opera 1% of white people that take

593
00:35:11.781 --> 00:35:14.180
all the fucking money,
you know what I mean?

594
00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:18.200
And back in the day they were celebrities,
the Rockefellers,
the Vanderbilts,

595
00:35:18.201 --> 00:35:18.801
the Astors,

596
00:35:18.801 --> 00:35:22.100
you knew what they fucking look like and they had all the money and all the

597
00:35:22.101 --> 00:35:25.130
resentment went their way.
So they are like,
well,
we got to pull back.
Here we go.

598
00:35:25.131 --> 00:35:28.010
We've got to stop the end zone dancing coming down the street with their fucking

599
00:35:28.011 --> 00:35:29.030
top hats.
And Shit,

600
00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.660
we gotta be a little more humble so nobody comes over to our house and takes all

601
00:35:32.661 --> 00:35:36.530
our shit.
Right.
So then they came up with corporations,
right?

602
00:35:36.531 --> 00:35:39.780
And they could hit and those things and then they came up with the whole,
yeah,

603
00:35:39.781 --> 00:35:42.060
the family sold it off to this corporation.

604
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:43.920
We don't have the money that we'll use to have,
you know,

605
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:45.960
the Rockefellers and all of those fucking people.

606
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:50.350
And I think that that's just sort of filters down,
you know,

607
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.710
where if you're,
if you're running shit,
you,
you,
you're,
you want to like,
ah,

608
00:35:55.711 --> 00:35:57.750
that didn't make any sense,
did it?
But I definitely,

609
00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:00.310
I think there's definitely some race they get in there,
you know what I mean?

610
00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:05.530
I think it is,
you know,
and it's also a time issue too.

611
00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:06.771
What I mean,

612
00:36:06.771 --> 00:36:09.830
like if a white person sings the national anthem has hackey is this is,
you know,

613
00:36:09.831 --> 00:36:11.240
it's going to be over and fucking,
you know,

614
00:36:11.241 --> 00:36:16.241
basically about what a minute 58 seconds is even take that long.

615
00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.830
Right.
And then you're going to be able to go to commercial and sell your Fritos.

616
00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.970
All right.
Generally speaking,
you don't have somebody black come say,
hey,

617
00:36:22.971 --> 00:36:26.570
you know,
you might have to cut a couple of commercials.
Whoa.

618
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:31.310
Hey.
Right.
You know,
it's going to be that we're a white guy.

619
00:36:31.311 --> 00:36:35.870
He's just going to get out there and I go,
oh shea,
he's already to the se,
right.

620
00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.010
He gets their fucking two thirds of the time quicker.

621
00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:45.710
Alrighty.
There you go.
That's me checking in on you.
Um,
you,

622
00:36:45.711 --> 00:36:48.020
I hope you have a great weekend and uh,

623
00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:50.630
everybody's been freaking out about the musical interludes here.

624
00:36:50.631 --> 00:36:53.670
This is a all Andrew feminists.
Um,

625
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:58.010
he's a younger fella,
so he knows all the hip new stuff.
If I was doing it,

626
00:36:58.011 --> 00:36:59.720
it would be like a tie,

627
00:36:59.721 --> 00:37:03.530
a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree.

628
00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.480
That's been three y'all gears.
This is the music of linear though.
Dead yet.

629
00:37:08.481 --> 00:37:09.920
Still Watch still on me.

630
00:37:09.921 --> 00:37:13.980
If I don't see that ribbon round at old oak tree,

631
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:17.120
I'll get on the bus.
Forget about us.
Put the blame off

632
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.520
Tony,
Orlando,
everybody.
If you want to put that on your little iPods,

633
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.510
listen to it.
Ironically,
I don't,

634
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.920
I listen to it emotionally and I cry and think about how old I am.

635
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.580
Go fuck yourselves a see on Monday.

636
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.240
Enjoy it the second half of the Thursday afternoon just before Friday,

637
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.500
Monday morning podcast that came out on Friday.

638
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:18.763
<v 3>All</v>

639
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.890
right.
Hi Bill.

640
00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:30.520
<v 2>How are you?
Um,
I'm a big fan out of Edmonton,
Alberta,</v>

641
00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:34.530
Canada.
I've been up there Northlands call the same,

642
00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.100
the greatest hockey team on the greatest thing was going to say,

643
00:38:37.101 --> 00:38:40.940
I've heard you talk about it in regards to hockey.
Edmonds.
Uh,
okay.

644
00:38:40.941 --> 00:38:44.750
You got fans up here.
So pull a Louis CK and come up.
Uh,

645
00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.510
I guess Louie was just up there.
Uh,
some good food,

646
00:38:47.511 --> 00:38:52.280
some good beer that you no longer drink in some women that I feel put Montreal

647
00:38:52.281 --> 00:38:55.970
the shame.
Oh Shit.
I liked that.
Huh?
I liked the ladies.

648
00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:01.520
Need some advice and if you felt like bringing in the lovely Nia lady,

649
00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:06.050
uh,
then by all means do so as a woman's thoughts would be very welcomed.

650
00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:10.670
All right,
here we go.
My fiancee,
my fiancee,
my fiance

651
00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:17.360
from Virginia told me recently that one of her fantasies as a threesome with

652
00:39:17.361 --> 00:39:21.740
another lady,
a thing is whenever I bring it up,
she gets squeamish about it.

653
00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.700
I've come across two separate women that have said they're interested in her as

654
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:29.300
an I is a couple,
but when it was time to meet my fight,

655
00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:34.070
my fiance pretty much said she didn't want to once was due to my fiance being

656
00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:35.600
three months pregnant

657
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.370
<v 1>with our authors horn.</v>

658
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:44.210
We don't judge on the podcast.
Even so you know you're not a dirt bag.

659
00:39:44.211 --> 00:39:48.170
That's actually really hilarious,
but how inappropriate would it be to have a,

660
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.480
well,
I'm sure people who have done,

661
00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:53.180
I wonder how that would damage the kid is damaged.
The kid,

662
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:57.010
the kid is in there and he can hear like,
you know,

663
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.253
you know,

664
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.740
<v 2>maybe the kid would become a porn star.</v>

665
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.830
You never seen that day when people read books to the womb

666
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:14.120
and the kid comes out and all of a sudden he can do calculus,
calculus,

667
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:19.010
<v 1>you never seen that.
You'll be a play music to the kid.
He comes out,</v>

668
00:40:19.011 --> 00:40:23.870
he's like fucking Moza wait a minute.
Babies.
Not that anyway,

669
00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:27.460
<v 2>just keep reading.
Just keep reading.
What's it like a little tadpole in there.</v>

670
00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:29.240
Just can't understand it.

671
00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:32.450
<v 1>It's not going to be affected by a three,
seven.</v>

672
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:36.330
Is that what it looks like a peer during her three months

673
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:38.310
<v 2>being pregnant.
That's when the baby,</v>

674
00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:43.250
the baby looks like a little t rex within one of those fucking alien heads.

675
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:43.611
All right.

676
00:40:43.611 --> 00:40:46.820
Once it was due to my fiance being three months pregnant with our first born and

677
00:40:46.821 --> 00:40:51.230
the second time was because I had a crush on said woman.
Well Jesus Christ,

678
00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.670
give me self a dog in the fight sir.
Um,
so what gives?

679
00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:57.310
<v 1>This guy's a moron.</v>

680
00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:06.880
I don't get what's going on.
Wow.

681
00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.980
<v 2>Fond of girl,
girl pro porn when she rubs one out.</v>

682
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:16.780
Makes comments when we're in public about other women being attractive sexually.

683
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:21.250
So she portrays herself as into them,
yet she doesn't pursue her.

684
00:41:21.251 --> 00:41:25.840
Suppose it fantasy and when I bring it up she seems put off about the whole

685
00:41:25.841 --> 00:41:29.230
thing.
Should I keep trying to make it happen or just throwing the towel?

686
00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:34.070
<v 1>Oh yeah,
cause it's going really good so far.
Hey,
we give help during</v>

687
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.790
<v 2>the advice section and she's most likely doing it cause your methods are</v>

688
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:42.080
obviously amazing and she's most likely saying,
well,

689
00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:44.000
if he didn't need it,
didn't need help,
he wouldn't,

690
00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:44.960
he wouldn't have read wrote in.

691
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.370
And she's most likely saying she's into the three way to appease me and some

692
00:41:49.371 --> 00:41:54.260
work twisted woman way.
Thanks for the advice.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Ah.
All right.

693
00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:57.440
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
All right dude.
Um,

694
00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:01.430
there's a bunch of stuff going on here.
Um,
first of all,

695
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:06.431
yet I can't really say that those were attempts when you tried to have a

696
00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:11.441
threesome when your fiance was three months pregnant with a baby.

697
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:15.560
And then secondly,
uh,

698
00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:20.200
the fact that you're attracted to the other yet,
you're not,

699
00:42:20.201 --> 00:42:22.550
not attracted.
You had a crush on the other woman.
This,

700
00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:27.230
there's rules to having a fucking threesome.
Uh,

701
00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.680
you know,
you can't,
yeah,
you can't have feelings for the other woman.

702
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.360
And for the most part you can't climax with the other one.
That's also a problem.

703
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:41.060
Um,
from what I've heard,
I've never had one.
I never had.
I never had I,

704
00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.910
you know what?
Twice in my life I could've had a threesome when I was younger,

705
00:42:43.911 --> 00:42:46.430
but I was too fucking stupid to realize it was going on.

706
00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:49.700
I just remember seeing that going,
like,
why,
when her girlfriend leave,

707
00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.670
I'm trying to get laid here.

708
00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:57.830
Then another time I was working in buffalo and these girls just put it on the

709
00:42:57.831 --> 00:43:02.570
table.
They put it on table.
They basically said we're like a coalition.

710
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.350
I remember they used that word and one was hot and the other one looked like a

711
00:43:06.351 --> 00:43:09.890
three story brownstone.
She was a fuck.
She like a building.

712
00:43:09.891 --> 00:43:14.690
She was looking at the grenade.
She know she was like six,

713
00:43:14.691 --> 00:43:15.524
three.

714
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:21.290
There was a guy used to play for fucking the Portland Trailblazers.
A duck worth.

715
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:24.290
That's what she looked like with the vagina.
And I was just,
I,
you know,

716
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.240
I never had,
you know what,
I never had that ability.

717
00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.240
I never had that ability to just bang something that I wasn't attracted to.

718
00:43:31.241 --> 00:43:35.240
It was just always disgusting to me.
So there you go.
So,
from what I've heard,
sir,

719
00:43:35.241 --> 00:43:39.770
I am not speaking from a,
a,
a place of experience here,
but,

720
00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:44.870
um,
I will tell you this,
if you're going to have a fucking threesome,

721
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.600
I wouldn't do it with someone who you're in a relationship with.

722
00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:52.490
I don't think the relationship is ever the fucking same.
And,
uh,
I dunno,

723
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.250
it's just,
it's just a,
it's a weird

724
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.860
<v 1>thanks.
Well,
I think they,
the issue that he's having with his,</v>

725
00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:59.420
his wife now

726
00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.380
<v 2>fiance,
he's just Marriner cause he knocked her up.</v>

727
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:05.140
<v 1>Um,
Jesus,
um,</v>

728
00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:08.680
is that she talks about wanting to be with women but is not acting on it.

729
00:44:08.681 --> 00:44:10.150
But a lot of times,
you know,

730
00:44:10.151 --> 00:44:13.860
people have these sexual fantasies and they're just meant to be fantasy.
Yeah.

731
00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:17.620
They're not really necessarily going to be a reality.
Like just because you,

732
00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.530
you know,
in your mind's eye or like,
Ooh,
that would be interesting.

733
00:44:20.531 --> 00:44:22.000
It doesn't mean that you're actually going to go through,

734
00:44:22.001 --> 00:44:24.400
like a lot of women have the gang bangers fantasy.

735
00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:27.840
<v 2>That doesn't mean they're going to go into a fucking loading dock and lay down</v>

736
00:44:27.841 --> 00:44:32.190
and be like,
who wants it?
All right.
Sorry,
I have male.
I have to get to the point

737
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:36.630
<v 0>here.
Sure.
You have female listeners to,
you know,
um,</v>

738
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:38.161
yeah,

739
00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:41.010
so that doesn't necessarily mean that she's actually going to want to do it.

740
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:44.640
And your methods of trying to go about it are just so off the mark.

741
00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:49.200
It's like laughable.
You know I wanted to have a threesome with you.

742
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.360
Alright.
Yup.
Which I do.
I don't,
I do in my head,
but I don't,

743
00:44:54.361 --> 00:44:56.190
I don't want to do it because it's going to fuck everything up.

744
00:44:56.490 --> 00:45:01.350
You really think so?
Yes.
It's going to be fucking weird.
It's going to be weird.

745
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.720
It's,
you know what it is the,
you fucking,
you cross too many,

746
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.050
you open too many Pandora's box,
whatever the fucking expression is.

747
00:45:10.051 --> 00:45:13.830
You never come back.
You don't come back.
Yeah.
And it's,

748
00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:18.300
and it's like you have to start over again.
You'd have to,
yeah,
I dunno.

749
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:23.160
You know,
it's like we were talking about Madonna,
Madonna when they were playing.

750
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.830
Like that was another thing too,
to add to the gayness,
to that bar.

751
00:45:25.831 --> 00:45:29.850
They were playing Madonna videos and you were talking about her getting fucking

752
00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:34.460
divorced.
He have his and helped her taste in men.
How she likes those.
Uh,

753
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:37.260
I was saying like,
when she wants a husband,

754
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:41.580
she goes for like that the Alpha male white guy,

755
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:45.780
you know,
a usually very like a macho strong man.

756
00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.820
But then when she has her lovers,

757
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:52.200
that's when she has a 20 something year old Latino boy that no one's ever heard

758
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.660
of her little boy toy.
So here's the thing,

759
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.510
this girl is sold out fucking Madison Square Garden.

760
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.790
She's already done the fucking astronaut tour.

761
00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:01.740
You know the astronauts that go around the fucking world,

762
00:46:01.741 --> 00:46:04.320
they see how beautiful it is and then they start crying at a stop light.

763
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:08.070
You don't see too much.
It's the same thing with her if she's seen too much.

764
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:10.740
So if there's no way she's ever going to be able to keep a marriage going,

765
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:12.840
because at any moment as,

766
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:17.310
as she has to sit there and be unselfish and listen to this fucking square

767
00:46:17.311 --> 00:46:21.780
headed white guy that she likes,
she wants to do like swear headed white guys.

768
00:46:21.781 --> 00:46:25.890
Right?
So it's the guy's going like you not fucking giving me what I need at any

769
00:46:25.891 --> 00:46:27.660
moment.
She can pull the rip cord,

770
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:32.810
still sell out Madison Square Garden and then go bang some fucking stud it

771
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.750
fetish guy.
If I had those options near you,

772
00:46:37.751 --> 00:46:40.940
think I'd be listening to you at any point.

773
00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:45.980
I could go in and fucking trade your acid for some fucking 22 year old and I

774
00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.870
just start blowing me immediately.
Please.
I'd be out of here in a second,
ma'am.

775
00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:57.570
Right.
I'd like to see you try it anyway.
Ah,
the worst shit.

776
00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:01.530
Talking of every card Yas,
they,
I'd like to say you try it.

777
00:47:01.531 --> 00:47:04.530
Why I Yada.
Yeah.
Why don't you let your Max,

778
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:08.820
why don't you stop having a jerk tone to this guy and help him out.
I was,
well,

779
00:47:08.821 --> 00:47:10.950
I was going to say,
well,
why don't you let your,

780
00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.020
the person that you are in the relationship with that,

781
00:47:13.021 --> 00:47:15.300
why don't you let her lead the way on this?

782
00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:18.060
Because now you're just becoming like that advice.

783
00:47:18.061 --> 00:47:20.640
That's guy that's putting all this pressure on her.

784
00:47:20.641 --> 00:47:24.720
Just let her just let her open the door to it if she wants to.
If not,

785
00:47:24.721 --> 00:47:28.440
leave it alone.
There's no need to keep pushing it.
This is what you do.

786
00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.370
This is what that bad advice again,

787
00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.960
because you don't know what you're talking about.
Yes,

788
00:47:31.961 --> 00:47:35.220
I do know what I'm talking about.
You know a lot of people value my advice.

789
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:40.140
Here's the,
I have self esteem and I like myself.
That's right.
Hi,

790
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:43.510
this is the deal.
All right.
Fuck this.
You want this to happen,
sir.

791
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.240
This is what you gotta do.
All right.
If you will.

792
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:49.960
If you listened to Nia and you let her lead the way,
it's never going to happen.

793
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:50.620
Okay?

794
00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:54.940
Because she's not going to act on it the next time you find someone who finds

795
00:47:54.941 --> 00:47:59.500
you guys attractive as a couple,
do not tell you fucking fiance about it.

796
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:02.440
All right?
You tell the girl that's into it.
Listen,

797
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:04.480
you got to fucking make it look natural.

798
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:07.030
SORTA coerce her into it and that type of thing.

799
00:48:07.031 --> 00:48:09.350
He just make it seem like it's natural.
She goers,

800
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:13.600
you go up to the bar and they just make it seem like it happened naturally and

801
00:48:13.601 --> 00:48:16.360
then you never tell her the fucking secret and then that's it.

802
00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.480
That's how you do it.
Because she's not going to take the lead.

803
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:21.850
And this guy is all fucking knees and elbows.

804
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:26.890
She was pregnant and I had a crush on the other girl.
What?
Gibbs?
Yeah,

805
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:30.910
no,
just the next time that there's a girl that's fucking interested in you as a

806
00:48:30.911 --> 00:48:32.200
couple,
don't tell your wife about it.

807
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:36.340
And then go up there and just have her fucking strike up a conversation and just

808
00:48:36.341 --> 00:48:39.430
say,
listen,
do not flirt with me at all.

809
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.790
Just flirt with her and get her fucking motor running.

810
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.500
And then maybe it'll go down.

811
00:48:44.501 --> 00:48:47.620
And then what you want to do is try to start the kissing there at the bar.

812
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:53.050
It's actually not bad at rice.
Thank you.
Thank you.
See that's how you do it.

813
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:57.700
Because this,
I'm telling you,
it's not going to happen.
She's like,

814
00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.270
I like,
if I get scared,
it's not going to happen.

815
00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:04.510
So you gotta you gotta make it seem like it's natural.
Yeah.
That's how you do it.

816
00:49:04.511 --> 00:49:08.020
You got to get sneaky there,
sir.
That's what I just advocated.
Fair enough.

817
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.810
Fair enough.
Look at that,
Huh?
Every once in a while she agrees with me.

818
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.990
<v 4>All right,
let's go on to fat Gi function.</v>

819
00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.270
I felt I wanted to let you know that people hate fat people to,

820
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:00.760
I want it to send it and

821
00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:05.020
<v 0>use some thoughts.
Not Too many from a considerate citizen of Fat America.</v>

822
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:10.240
Yeah.
I've noticed that since I went off on the fat guy on the,
on the airplane.

823
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:14.080
Uh,
I've,
I've had fat people,
just tall people,
general goal.

824
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.900
I try to be real considerate of how big I am.

825
00:50:16.901 --> 00:50:19.630
I try to make sure I get an aisle seat.
I leaned out in the aisle.

826
00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:22.420
You shouldn't have to deal with that.
And it actually,

827
00:50:22.421 --> 00:50:26.140
you know what's great about this now?
I can't really make fun of fatties anymore.

828
00:50:26.141 --> 00:50:30.560
No one that's so many them are,
they seem like decent people.

829
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.240
I'll fucking one kind of a backhanded compliment was that,
you know,

830
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:38.870
I thought they were all pieces is shit,
but it turns out most of them are.

831
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:43.280
Most of them are right.
All right,
here we go.
He says,
I'm a big fat guy.

832
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:48.070
I'm usually the fattest guy in the room no matter where I go.
Uh,

833
00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:51.290
do you get intimidated when,
when you're not the fattest guy,
you know,

834
00:50:51.291 --> 00:50:54.290
sort of like the toughest guy in town,
all of a sudden goes to another town,

835
00:50:54.291 --> 00:50:59.130
realizes that somebody can kick his ass and his whole world crumbles.
Um,

836
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:03.620
anyways,
he says,
my whole family's fat and I've been fat since I've been born.

837
00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:09.410
Uh,
not to make any excuses.
I'm just naturally predisposed to it.

838
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:14.240
And I eat like a typical middle American,
uh,

839
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:18.740
Middle American,
not vegetarian,
but not 24,
seven beer and broths either.

840
00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:23.260
Anyway,
I'm fat and I just wanted to let you know that not,

841
00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.910
not all of us fatties or inconsiderate assholes.

842
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:30.350
The stereotype of the jolly fat man has been replaced by the selfish asshole

843
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:34.040
who's fat.
Uh,
when I fly,
which isn't frequently,

844
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:38.930
I buy two seats.
Nice.
My sister is with me.

845
00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:44.050
We by a row of three and always bring along our own seat belt extenders.

846
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:48.560
Yes,
they sell them.
Okay.
This is,
uh,

847
00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:52.060
this is hilarious and fucking sad all at the same time.
Uh,

848
00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:56.930
the plane only carries two to three extenders and you never want to be the guy

849
00:51:56.931 --> 00:52:00.380
who holds up the plane because you can't buckle or worse.

850
00:52:00.381 --> 00:52:04.340
Get kicked off that Jesus has got to be embarrassing.

851
00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.430
Oh my God,
this is,
this guy's killing me right here.
This guy is,

852
00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:11.570
this is a brilliant email.
He's going to make me never make fun of fatties again.

853
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:15.170
I'm actually,
he's now,
he's bringing me into their world.

854
00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.020
He goes,
those things costs $80,

855
00:52:18.021 --> 00:52:22.400
but it's worth $80 to avoid public embarrassment.
Right?
Absolutely.

856
00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:26.240
If they told me to tone down the color of my hair,

857
00:52:26.241 --> 00:52:30.380
I would buy a fucking swimming cap rather than have them stop the flight.

858
00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:32.663
Just so you know,

859
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:37.100
fat people like me don't get to buy clothes in the same stores as normal people.

860
00:52:37.101 --> 00:52:41.420
Yes,
I did know that.
The selection slash style suck and they cost more.

861
00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:44.480
We pay more for bigger cars,
extra plane tickets,

862
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:47.900
and bigger clothes among other things.
I haven't done the math,

863
00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:52.100
but I figured we burned through through furniture faster.
Two

864
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.450
it's the price we pay for the life we lead.
Even if it's not a conscious choice.

865
00:52:59.451 --> 00:53:02.090
Believe me,
no one wants to be fat,

866
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:05.810
but that's the cost of doing business.
This guy's fucking hilarious.

867
00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:10.550
Just like how they are added,
there are added costs of being a woman,
bras,
makeup,

868
00:53:10.551 --> 00:53:15.230
pills,
et Cetera,
or gay or being gay.
He writes question mark,

869
00:53:15.231 --> 00:53:19.970
chaps,
Lube,
I dunno,
or a parent or a paraplegic or whatever.

870
00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:24.350
Not that it's a disability.
Uh,
it's just our lot in life,

871
00:53:24.351 --> 00:53:28.280
but you know what accepted it.
I live my life accordingly.

872
00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:32.990
I'm not an asshole who imposes on others.
I stayed in the back of any pack,

873
00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:37.250
make sure no one will ever have to walk or sit behind me when I can help it.

874
00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:42.410
It's the fat guy.
Funkshway how do you,
how do you dislike this guy?

875
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:47.690
When I enter a room or a situation,
I always ask where do I fit in?

876
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:49.550
Literally and figuratively,

877
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:54.740
whenever I have to eat lunch with my work group,

878
00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:57.770
about 20 people and we're seated at a long table.

879
00:53:57.771 --> 00:54:02.630
I never sit between the table in the wall and I usually sit at the end.

880
00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.520
No.
Why?
I don't want,

881
00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:09.440
I want to make as few people uncomfortable as possible.
Uh,

882
00:54:09.441 --> 00:54:13.490
I don't want anyone to have to squeeze behind me to get out and sitting between

883
00:54:13.491 --> 00:54:16.160
two people just pisses them both off or so.

884
00:54:16.161 --> 00:54:20.180
I assume Jesus Christ,
this guy's like a fat Gandy.

885
00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.780
Um,
when I have to Carpool with a group,

886
00:54:23.781 --> 00:54:28.730
it helps to drive or have shotgun because then I'm not squeezing the other

887
00:54:28.731 --> 00:54:33.050
people in the back seat.
The thing that makes me hate fat people,
capital letters,

888
00:54:33.051 --> 00:54:36.980
hate fat people,
is that they don't seem to realize that they're fat.

889
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:42.140
They are impulsive and selfish and don't seem to consider that what a normal guy

890
00:54:42.141 --> 00:54:46.630
eats.
That when a normal guy eats a giant Turkey leg at Disneyland,
it's a,

891
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:50.570
it's a lame and kind of funny,
oh,
it's layman kind of funny.

892
00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:53.150
But when a fat guy does it,
it's disgusting.

893
00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:57.650
Or maybe they just got fat and haven't figured it out.
Hey,
fatty,

894
00:54:57.651 --> 00:55:01.160
don't sit there because now everyone has to squeeze past you.
I like this guy.

895
00:55:01.161 --> 00:55:03.320
He's trashing fat people know,
or Hey,

896
00:55:03.321 --> 00:55:07.230
don't act like you're entitled to that to put your arm around your airplane seat

897
00:55:07.231 --> 00:55:09.830
mate,
because it makes you more comfortable for you.

898
00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:14.060
It makes it more comfortable for you.
You asshole.
He just keeps going here.

899
00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:15.650
Or Hey,
if you got to eat in public,

900
00:55:15.651 --> 00:55:19.820
don't smear barbecue sauce all over your face at the church picnic or written

901
00:55:19.821 --> 00:55:23.450
more than two donuts in a sitting parentheses airport.

902
00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:26.120
And you know what?
When I swim in public,

903
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:31.150
rarely I keep my shirt on until the second before I get in the pool.

904
00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:36.020
I don't ride the elevator from my hotel room and walked down the hall to the

905
00:55:36.021 --> 00:55:41.000
Hampton Inn pool shirtless because I'm a fat fuck and no one wants to see that.

906
00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:45.380
I used to swim with my shirt on,
but somehow that's even worse.

907
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:50.180
Uh,
anyways,
for what it's worth,
have a good week.
Thank for the hilarity.
Ah,

908
00:55:50.181 --> 00:55:53.120
you know what,
that guys,
all right.
You know what?

909
00:55:53.121 --> 00:55:56.000
I bet there's more people like that then.
Then there's not.

910
00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:59.870
So maybe I ought to lay off the fatties for half a second.

911
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:04.340
I'm just doing this just to fucking,
you know,

912
00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:06.230
this is what this podcast is.

913
00:56:06.231 --> 00:56:08.810
It's like a smoker and every once in a while you just,
you gotta,

914
00:56:08.811 --> 00:56:11.510
you gotta I don't even know what you gotta do.

915
00:56:11.511 --> 00:56:14.000
You gotta throw a little wet wood in there.
That's what that was.

916
00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:15.530
I think I'm gonna leave the fatties alone.

917
00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:18.850
I think they were actually really considering,
I think I was wrong about it

918
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:19.743
<v 4>the entire time.</v>

919
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:06.450
I have been happy.

920
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:11.920
All right.

921
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:17.980
<v 0>I flew into lax,
Los Angeles International Airport,
that for some reason,</v>

922
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:20.560
if you go beyond Colorado,

923
00:57:20.561 --> 00:57:24.070
you just can't get a fucking direct flight anywhere.
I don't,
I don't get it.

924
00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:27.550
When I was in New York City,
I could fly to all these places directly.

925
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.720
Maybe it's cause I was in New York and it was only an hour and a half away.

926
00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.070
<v 4>Okay.</v>

927
00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:36.680
<v 0>I don't,
I don't fucking know.
It just doesn't seem like he can fly anyway.</v>

928
00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:41.060
So anyways,
I've got to fly to La,
to Phoenix,
Phoenix to Columbus,

929
00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.540
all right.
On us.

930
00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:51.520
So I get on the plane and there's two empty seats next to me and it's getting

931
00:57:51.831 --> 00:57:55.220
close to the point where they're going to close the door to the plane and I'm

932
00:57:55.221 --> 00:57:58.610
like excited.
Like Holy Shit,
I'm going to have this whole fucking road in myself.

933
00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:01.730
Just be nice.
I could stretch out a little bit.
Take my carry on,

934
00:58:01.731 --> 00:58:03.770
stick it under the other chair.
This is going to be great.

935
00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.500
Right before the close the door,
low and behold,

936
00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:11.210
this fat tub of shit gets on the fucking plate.
All right?
And I'm thinking,

937
00:58:11.211 --> 00:58:15.380
Oh God,
not me,
please for the love of God.
Don't pick my row.

938
00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.490
You don't want to do that shit.

939
00:58:16.491 --> 00:58:21.170
You just fucking willing to guide to sit down as he waddles his fat ass down the

940
00:58:21.171 --> 00:58:25.550
fucking aisle,
it's him in his fucking lady,
right?

941
00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:29.950
So he fucking comes all the way up,
comes to my row,

942
00:58:29.951 --> 00:58:33.070
and he's just standing there and I'm hoping he's just standing there because

943
00:58:33.071 --> 00:58:34.960
he's putting his stuff in the overhead compartment.

944
00:58:34.961 --> 00:58:39.961
I can literally feel the fucking heat radiating off of his body from the 22

945
00:58:41.381 --> 00:58:45.850
years of mistakes that he's putting his goddamn stomach.
All right,

946
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:50.520
and what is he doing?
Oh yeah,
I'm in that role.
I'll meet your role.

947
00:58:50.521 --> 00:58:52.960
So I got to get up and what does he do?
His feet,

948
00:58:52.961 --> 00:58:57.610
let's his fucking girls sit by the window and then he sits in the middle seat

949
00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:01.600
and this fat fucking Tba fucking shit.

950
00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:03.570
<v 4>Okay.</v>

951
00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:07.230
<v 0>This dude was so fat.
I was sitting behind his back fat.</v>

952
00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:08.920
<v 4>Okay.</v>

953
00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:11.580
<v 0>You know what I mean?
He was like fat and round.</v>

954
00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:16.440
It was like sitting next to a planet with a head,
you know,

955
00:59:16.441 --> 00:59:20.910
it was like you could the roundness of this guy.
Okay,

956
00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:23.680
so he's trying to be less fat.
God bless him.

957
00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:29.040
So he crosses his arms when all it does is just causes fat lat to fucking bulge

958
00:59:30.161 --> 00:59:34.600
out even more into my airspace that I fucking paid for

959
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.960
and sundry.

960
00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:41.600
All I'm thinking is why the fuck did he take the window seat and then post up

961
00:59:41.601 --> 00:59:45.970
against his girlfriend?
My shoulder was getting hot from his arm.
It was,

962
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:51.020
he was on me.
It was fucking guy was on me.
If I was claustrophobic,

963
00:59:51.021 --> 00:59:52.310
they would've had to turn the plane around.

964
00:59:52.311 --> 00:59:56.930
This is how much this guy was in my chair
and I'm thinking,
why the hell?

965
00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:59.660
Why didn't you just take the fucking window seat?
You Fat,
fuck.

966
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:04.010
Have a little bit of fucking consideration.
Your tub of Shit.

967
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:05.490
<v 3>Okay.</v>

968
01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:07.950
<v 0>You know with your basketball shorts,
like you actually,</v>

969
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:10.740
her played a goddamn day in your life.

970
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:16.220
It's fucking legs spread out.
Like he was going to give birth to a baby calf.

971
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.890
You know,
why don't you sit near the window?
You know?

972
01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.840
I realized after awhile he didn't sit near the winner because he's so fucking

973
01:00:24.841 --> 01:00:29.490
fat.
He can't,
he can't be sat by the window.

974
01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:32.370
His other fat lat would a blown out the window.

975
01:00:32.371 --> 01:00:35.850
We all would have got sucked out unless it's tough as shit.

976
01:00:35.851 --> 01:00:40.320
Body fucking somehow got stuck in the fuselage,
which if you saw him

977
01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:45.450
wouldn't,
wouldn't be be a possibility.

978
01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.760
Unfucking believable and he's sitting there,
this is what kills me.

979
01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.860
He's sitting there and he's,
he's biting his nails and I just want to be like,

980
01:00:56.861 --> 01:01:01.000
dude,
do you ever stop eating?
Is there a moment and you'll,

981
01:01:01.001 --> 01:01:05.980
you'll literally consuming yourself right now.
I know,

982
01:01:05.981 --> 01:01:09.550
I know.
I know what you guys think.
Well,
hey bill,
why don't you fly first class?

983
01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:13.060
Oh yeah.
Well,
hey,
why don't you go fuck yourself.

984
01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:17.430
Hypothetical person who said that,
okay,
I understand.

985
01:01:17.431 --> 01:01:19.320
I bought a coach seat.
I know what that means.

986
01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:22.140
That means my fucking knees are going to be in my chest.

987
01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.410
That means if I'm even slightly lean forward and the guy in front of me reclines

988
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:30.990
he's going to hit me in the head.
I understand that.
Okay,
I get it,

989
01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:33.090
but that doesn't mean that this type of shit,

990
01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.750
I shouldn't have to pay an extra couple of fucking grant,
uh,
or whatever,

991
01:01:36.751 --> 01:01:41.550
1500 bucks.
So somebody else's Lard isn't in my lap.

992
01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:48.500
I am full on 100% behind you having to buy two seats when you're on an airplane.

993
01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:53.700
Okay?
I'm sorry.
You're fat.
Okay,

994
01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:58.710
but you made your choices.
This is one of the things,
this is a good thing.

995
01:01:58.711 --> 01:02:01.740
You got to buy two seats.
You got less money for cookies.

996
01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.730
Maybe that'll be a goal.
Maybe that'll be your bottoming out,
but it's,

997
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:11.620
it's absolutely ridiculous that I have to say,

998
01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:14.510
I literally leaning out into the fucking aisle.

999
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:20.190
My giant microwave oven head is out there and then I to deal with the stewardess

1000
01:02:20.221 --> 01:02:24.620
going,
Steve,
me skews.
We share.
Can you not sharing you share.
Please share.

1001
01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:28.860
Right.
I gotta watch him Houma.
I can't start yelling here.

1002
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:31.980
I'm in a hotel room again.
I already got one strike against me.

1003
01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:38.040
They probably build a fucking file on me.
Um,
yeah,
I'm leaning out there.

1004
01:02:38.041 --> 01:02:40.140
That was,
this is the best part.
The food cart comes.

1005
01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:41.650
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1006
01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:45.940
<v 0>Okay.
They asked me what I,
you know,
they asked to do what he wants to drink.</v>

1007
01:02:45.941 --> 01:02:49.690
He goes,
can I have a coke?
Can I have a coke?

1008
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.300
I just want to be like,
dude,
how about a water?
How about a salad?

1009
01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:56.820
You trying to make yourself even fatter during the flight.

1010
01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.520
Do you know what that's sold is going to do?

1011
01:02:58.521 --> 01:03:00.420
Do you already distended fucking belly.

1012
01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:02.850
You already can't even put the fucking tray down.

1013
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.730
He still couldn't put the tray down.
He tried.
He tried to put the train.

1014
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:12.000
Oh my God,
this fucking guy.
I swear to God,
the thoughts.

1015
01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:15.870
I was thinking it was embarrassing.
I was sitting there thinking like,
you know,

1016
01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:19.560
I'm so glad this dude's going to die young.
Can you believe that?

1017
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.800
I'm not happy in real life that that's going to happen,

1018
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:28.010
but that's how fucking uncomfortable I was and that's how fucking mad I was at

1019
01:03:28.011 --> 01:03:28.844
this guy.

1020
01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:31.880
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1021
01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.490
<v 0>absolutely.
You got to buy two seats people,
he got to do it.</v>

1022
01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:36.950
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1023
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:39.800
<v 0>I love when they try to leave the fucking arm up to,
I don't play that.</v>

1024
01:03:39.801 --> 01:03:44.030
I fucking shave that ham right down.
Open a fucking dead right the fuck down

1025
01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:50.460
fucking city and making me uncomfortable and you,
you want to relax.
If I could,

1026
01:03:50.461 --> 01:03:52.890
I put my foot on your chest to make your belt even tighter.

1027
01:03:52.891 --> 01:03:55.380
If that's what I do to you cut off you circle your license or your legs,

1028
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:59.620
maybe you'd get up and take a walk.
There's no excuse for it.

1029
01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:02.580
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1030
01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:04.890
<v 0>You know,
and I know this is probably coming off in sensitive,
but you know,</v>

1031
01:04:04.891 --> 01:04:08.190
something had been a red head my whole life.
Nobody gives a shit we don't get,

1032
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:12.840
we don't,
we're not considered handicapped capped.
We're not considered.
He kept,

1033
01:04:12.841 --> 01:04:16.020
this always happens when I scream all weekend.
We're not considered handicapped.

1034
01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.690
We don't get our own parking spaces.
These tubs is shit.

1035
01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:23.850
They getting their own parking spaces now,
making a shorter walk to the store,

1036
01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:25.560
making them even fatter.

1037
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.560
The only positive thing I can say about this guy was he only went to Phoenix and

1038
01:04:33.561 --> 01:04:36.950
he didn't smell.
I got to give him that.
He didn't smell,

1039
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:41.270
I don't know if he fucking jumped in a God damn pond,
you know,

1040
01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:44.720
killed 200 fish before he got onto the flight.
I don't know what he did,

1041
01:04:44.721 --> 01:04:46.020
but he didn't smell right.

1042
01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:48.210
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1043
01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:49.310
<v 0>But I swear to God,
you know what?</v>

1044
01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:54.380
You know what kills me is I ranted about this on the radio here in Columbus and

1045
01:04:54.871 --> 01:04:57.860
somebody called up the radio station set out.
I'm five,

1046
01:04:57.890 --> 01:05:01.530
eight 300 pounds,
and I love to fly.

1047
01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.290
I'm never listening to this radio station again.

1048
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:08.100
Can you believe that this dude actually felt like he was the victim?

1049
01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.100
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1050
01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:14.640
<v 0>You know,
that'd be like if some wife who got the shit kicked out of her,</v>

1051
01:05:14.641 --> 01:05:18.240
ranted about her piece of shit for slapping the shit

1052
01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.610
<v 2>out of her and then some guy calls up,
hey,</v>

1053
01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:26.160
I got issues with women and I slapped the shit out of my wife and I'm never

1054
01:05:26.161 --> 01:05:29.850
listen to this radio station again.
You know,

1055
01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:37.100
<v 0>give me a fucking break.
You know,
you know what you need to do?
Eat a salad,</v>

1056
01:05:37.101 --> 01:05:40.030
go for a walk.
You don't have to put money down for it,
for the gym.

1057
01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:43.760
Just go for a walk.
It's actually easier to do cardio.

1058
01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1059
01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:47.300
<v 0>When you're not at the gym,
cause we had to Jim,</v>

1060
01:05:47.301 --> 01:05:49.100
at any point you can just get off.

1061
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:50.430
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1062
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:54.210
<v 0>And walk a hundred yards to your car.
Your car is always a hundred yards away.</v>

1063
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:57.540
When you walk out your front door and you walk a mile away,

1064
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:59.000
<v 3>okay,</v>

1065
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.830
<v 0>what are you going to just quit and lay down on the ground?</v>

1066
01:06:00.831 --> 01:06:03.200
You've got to walk back.
There's two miles,
easy as two miles.

1067
01:06:03.201 --> 01:06:04.050
You all have a fucking deal

1068
01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:11.060
<v 2>or our,
our be a tub of shit.
Be Fat that that's your right.
Okay.
But by two seats,</v>

1069
01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:13.610
it's all I'm going to say.
All right.

1070
01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:17.913
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1071
01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:20.280
<v 2>Do I wear short shorts shown off my milk?</v>

1072
01:06:20.281 --> 01:06:24.880
White legs offending everybody's eyeballs?
No,
I don't.

1073
01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:25.714
I'm considerate.

1074
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:30.820
I with the Jordan once they come down right off my little white.
Nice.

1075
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:36.220
Um,
you're listening to the Monday morning podcast and yes,
it is insensitive.

1076
01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:42.320
It doesn't mean it's wrong.
I'm right.
I'm right on this one.

1077
01:06:42.321 --> 01:06:45.590
I'll fucking a fatties who listened to this podcast?
God bless you.

1078
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:49.130
Have yourself a Sunday on a Monday,
right?

1079
01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:54.920
I understand it.
Your emotional leaders,
something fucking bad happened to you.

1080
01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:58.550
So food is your friend and then you go in there.
I get it,
I get it.

1081
01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:01.580
I want you to lose weight.
I want you to feel good about yourself.

1082
01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:05.880
But until you're at that weight,
well you're not,
you know,

1083
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:09.500
spilling into my seat.
You got to buy two seats.

1084
01:07:10.790 --> 01:07:14.600
I shouldn't have to suffer because you ate all the cookies in the house.

1085
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:18.380
That's not my fucking fault of Jesus.
Bill.
We got it.

1086
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.380
I actually tweeted this week that fat people are the new secondhand smoking.

1087
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:31.550
Hey,
you want to be fat?
Go outside.

1088
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:19.090
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>
