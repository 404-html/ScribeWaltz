1
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.280
Hey what's going on is Bill Bird.

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.250
<v 1>It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday June 12 2017.</v>

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.300
What's going on.
Why you and I know what you're thinking.

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.780
Yeah you probably saying you me it's time for the Monday morning podcast.

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.090
Bill it's so late.
What the fuck.

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.980
It's like the sweet one here.
You're never late.

7
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.080
<v 2>Keith I had your show up in your wife's psych.
Where were you.
We were waiting.</v>

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.350
Well it's all cold now
you know.

9
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.030
<v 3>You want to look at her the way Vince McMann looked at that guy in the sports</v>

10
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.040
show and go oh oh fucking slap a piece of paper out of her hand but you can't

11
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.930
because all your relatives are there watch.

12
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.510
So then he got to sit there and make excuses.

13
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.200
The street like down the street was busted.

14
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.940
So it's just blinking red or blinking yellow so it was real slow and there was

15
00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:59.220
water coming out of the sewers.

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.120
And some guy I could believe is some guy in a hang glider square that kind of

17
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.310
got hand God.

18
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.210
<v 4>He he got blown off course and he landed right right on the side of the</v>

19
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:13.044
supermarket.

20
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.330
<v 3>Yeah.
Hit the side of it.</v>

21
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.140
<v 5>He went down in the boat why can't you just admit you were late because you</v>

22
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:20.780
don't care about me.

23
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.850
<v 6>It's not that I care about you.
It's just I just don't give a shit about this.</v>

24
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.590
<v 7>And I thought maybe if I showed up a little later then it'd be less minutes I'd</v>

25
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:35.090
have to spend it this way.
You don't like by reality.

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.990
<v 6>Yes.</v>

27
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.180
<v 1>No I'm kidding
or I'm safe.</v>

28
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.670
God forbid any my relatives listen to this.
I like all my relatives.
I got lucky.

29
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.440
I came from.
I came from a cool family and I married into a cool family.

30
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.400
You know what I mean.
So there you go.
Now I might just covering my bases.

31
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.430
Nobody knows why can't I get the fucking internet here.

32
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.540
I don't know why because I spend 9 million.
I mean I'm like this.

33
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.980
Do you know I said I still have cable I have a dish whatever and I get all the

34
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:13.700
packages and I know at this point you have these cord cutters.

35
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.270
They just cut the cord and they're they saying fuck network TV.

36
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.490
Fuck 60 Minutes fuck all of that shit.

37
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.400
I guess it's all just going to end up on the computer and just every TV show is

38
00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:30.350
gonna have an app or every network is gonna have an app within the app will be

39
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:31.100
all the shows.

40
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.100
I'm sure that already exists because I know there's HBO hot take or online or

41
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.690
streaming now.

42
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.580
Whatever the fuck it's called Summer Slam Showtime Summer Slam whatever the fuck

43
00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:46.590
they're calling it.
So I'm old school.

44
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.840
When I am old school is not because I'm down to earth and it's because I do not

45
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:59.421
want to waste one second of my fucking life trying to figure out how the new

46
00:03:00.031 --> 00:03:03.730
shit works all right.
That's the reason.

47
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.130
I've always bought cars and I drive them for a decade.

48
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.170
I just keep changing the fucking oil.
That's what I do.

49
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.660
The only reason why I went from the Prius to the JAG is just because my daughter

50
00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:19.494
was coming.

51
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.020
And I was just like I better buy a cool car before she gets here or I'm gonna be

52
00:03:24.021 --> 00:03:26.900
fucked.
And I never bought myself a cool car.

53
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.510
Because I don't know.
I've always been a frugal son of a bitch you know.

54
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.840
<v 8>I didn't want that stupid fuck you know when I was an idiot drive down the</v>

55
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:40.720
street with your whole fucking coolest car and everybody turn around looking at

56
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:43.400
you I like blending in the background you know.
Leave me alone.

57
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.690
<v 1>Dive Bar dive bar.</v>

58
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.820
<v 9>Night not VIP now down there at the fuckin sushi restaurant where all the</v>

59
00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:53.050
fucking cons hang out with the cameras you know

60
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.410
whatever that fucking show is.

61
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.310
<v 8>So anyways you know I had I had like a really bad cab driver back from L.A..</v>

62
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.390
I take cabs.

63
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.800
Because I'm not downloading that fucking app on my phone.

64
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.680
And then you track me and see what the fuck I am.

65
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.160
<v 9>Those Uber cuts all right.
Fuck them.</v>

66
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.840
So.
Yeah I just take the taxi so I get in a cab.

67
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.350
<v 8>And we're drive and it goes how do you want to go I go let's take the fucking</v>

68
00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:25.110
highways right.

69
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.120
It's the middle of the day here so you know I was peek out the windows would

70
00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:33.080
come into land to see what the floral fizzy looks like.
And

71
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.190
so whatever we get on the goddamn thing.

72
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.980
I know the guy's not the H villain I'm like Buddy there's two of us here.

73
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.050
<v 1>We are the world we're safe and we're thinking locally and acting globally
right.</v>

74
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.290
This is Greenpeace here.
We have two people in a car.

75
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.740
<v 10>We get to use the diamond lane and he's like oh da da da da the fuck.</v>

77
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.020
oil costs money and his accent costs money.

78
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.700
Q What is your fucking job is driving people around you asshole if you had that

79
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:12.640
thing you could get people to and from where they're going.

80
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.960
<v 11>And you could you could pick up more people right.
You could make more money.</v>

81
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.660
<v 1>So I'm in the back you know big Hollywood phony getting all grumpy trial look at</v>

82
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:28.690
look at look at Bill Oh look at him.
He's getting in a taxi cab.

83
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.440
He didn't forget where he came from.

84
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.460
Two seconds later I'm fucking bitching out this fucking poor old bastard

85
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.050
in my own passive aggressive way.

86
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.960
Just mumble in the back seat out of fucking out of the fucking thing.

87
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.840
That's what the fuck you mean.
This is on me right.

88
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.240
He should have said that as you pulled up or whatever right.

89
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.940
So then he just had no instincts.

90
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.770
You know we gotta get off our exit you know on to another fucking highway.

91
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.840
So there's the long line that all these shitheads weighed in and then there's

92
00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:05.841
Tory Ray Ray Liotta lying right fuck you pay me going in through the kitchen

93
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.560

That was fish hooks right.

94
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.500
We didn't ask anything we want and we just we just took it.

95
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.060
<v 3>And then when it was all said and done Yeah busted join out right.</v>

96
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.430
You take that fuck you go round everybody like you're still going straight in

97
00:06:23.431 --> 00:06:27.000
the last seconds you put on your right hand directional you get in somebody's

98
00:06:27.001 --> 00:06:29.180
beep say yeah.
Who gives a shit.
Now you are.

99
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.923
<v 12>All right.</v>

100
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.390
<v 3>There was a basic skills that a cab driver should have and he gets in to the</v>

101
00:06:36.391 --> 00:06:41.391
fuckin soccer mom line and I was just like this guy is the worst and I was just

102
00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:43.260
like you know what is an old man.

103
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.520
<v 13>He drives a cab.
OK.
Who gives a fuck.</v>

104
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.410
So then I just said you know what.
Who gives a fuck.

105
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.820
<v 1>So and he goes which way do you want me to go.</v>

106
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.720
Which highway I go does it even matter at this point.

107
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.430
It's like you're gonna sit in the longest.

108
00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.230
I didn't say this pioneer sit in the longest line.

109
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.230
You don't have the fucking HIV thing.
I mean.

110
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.620
You want to just pull over get some lunch.
I mean.
Oh fuck begonia.

111
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.680
So anyways we get up to that my house.

112
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.750
He goes ape and I say credit card.

113
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.780
So he takes my credit card and he does the whole thing reach it through the

114
00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:21.130
little fucking divider window there and then he hits no tip.

115
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.570
And I go to why you had no tip because he goes.
No I don't know that.

116
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.430
Thing he goes I deserve to be punished.
That's what he said.
I said Jesus Christ.

117
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.860
I'm not taking it to that level.
I was upset.
Half an hour.

118
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.150
I'm gonna fuckin tip you.
He goes No I don't deserve a blah blah blah.

119
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.420
I got off the phone.
It just made me sad.
Don't ever say that.

120
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.320
So I gave him twenty bucks.
Cash.

121
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.790
<v 14>And he's all fucking me and I gotta get you change and change.</v>

122
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.530
<v 15>Win.
Is this how you do it.
Maybe that's his scam.</v>

123
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.710
<v 1>He doesn't have the thing and then in the end he fucking just puts his head down</v>

124
00:08:01.711 --> 00:08:06.460
and goes I don't deserve a tip.
And then a fuckin softie goes No.
Yes you do.

125
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.120
And then he gets twenty dollar tip even though he's stunk of what he was doing

126
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.190
and he still doesn't have to pay for the thing.

127
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.290
I think you know what I think I got.

128
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.650
<v 16>I think I got scammed</v>

129
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.590
I think I fell for it I think I bought it I bought a

130
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.400
you know a VCR and I opened it up and it's just a brick in the box.

131
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.040
Remember that one that was the old scam back in the 80s.
Hey kid you want a VCR.

132
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.480
Fifty bucks.
Fuckin Hannity and you've run away with the box.

133
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.870
You open it up.
There was a brilliant.

134
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.640
Brilliant brilliant fucking scare you know because even if they asked to open up

135
00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:48.690
the box you know what's in there.
So all you got to do is they got to open it.

136
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.470
You just grab the brick before they do and you smash them over the head.

137
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.920
<v 17>Then you take everything in his wallet sort of fail safe.</v>

138
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.680
<v 16>You know unless the guy's bigger than you.</v>

139
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.430
Then as he goes to open his you call cops cops cops and you grab the box and you

140
00:09:04.431 --> 00:09:05.264
get the fuck out of.

141
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.110
<v 8>I don't know I'm talking about so anyways I had a great weekend.</v>

142
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.110
I went up to the

143
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.880
I went up to Montreal Morrill with Sir Paul Versace and Andrew feminists and we

144
00:09:23.331 --> 00:09:27.380
did the Olympic theater on my birthday Saturday night.

145
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.350
You probably wanted Hey Bill why did why would you do stand up on your birthday.

146
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.940
It's because I wanted to go to the formula one formula one race on June 11th and

147
00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:38.490
when I booked it I wasn't thinking June 10th is my birthday.

148
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.140
<v 18>I just saw June 11th and that's not an important day to me.
You know.</v>

149
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.280
How dumb I am it didn't dawn on me that my birthday was the fucking day before.

150
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.610
So anyways I go up there.
And.

151
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.730
<v 1>I go out when Andrew brought me up he goes keep a go for the birthday boy and he</v>

152
00:09:57.731 --> 00:10:01.660
brought me out in the crowd sang me happy birthday was awesome.

153
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.130
<v 18>He had a fun show.</v>

154
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.480
<v 8>I get off stage and I walk down to the greenroom and some people from just for</v>

155
00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:15.600
laughs were there and they got me this this unbelievable cured meat from some

156
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:19.300
place with bread and they had all like the what's that kid's movie

157
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.800
you know with the cast talk what is that.
Is

158
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.670
<v 9>it called cars.</v>

159
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.810
<v 8>I don't know.
I don't know I just.</v>

160
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.780
<v 1>I'm new to the kid game whatever so they add those all up there like I was a</v>

161
00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:38.781
five year old and then my lady sent me up a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue which

162
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.990
funny because I was trying to be Billy no fund and I was telling her how great I

163
00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:49.800
felt not drinking to get eight hours sleep talking on a birthday and she goes

164
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.080
hey you ought to have a couple tonight you have a couple tonight.

165
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.650
I was like Why do you always do this to me.
I'm trying to do the right thing.

166
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.550
We're trying to go to bed early and you always like Bill you're not an alcoholic

167
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.170
stop being so dramatic you know.

168
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.430
And then I realized oh it's because she got me the Johnny Walker Blue so I

169
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:08.040
called her up and that she you know we had a good laugh about that.

170
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.730
So I had a little shot of that before I did the second show.

171
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.880
And then the second show at the end of that.

172
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:20.370
Versace demo was brought out a cake with candles on it and shit and everyone was

173
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:25.580
singing happy birthday again so fourteen hundred seater I had twenty eight

174
00:11:25.581 --> 00:11:26.414
hundred people.

175
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.140
Most people didn't like my act towards the end sing me Happy Birthday was one of

176
00:11:30.141 --> 00:11:33.590
the best birthdays I've ever had.
So I'm an asshole.

177
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.150
I go to blow out the candles and I go I gotta make a wish I got to make a wish.

178
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:43.210
I'm in Montreal I go I wish for a Bruins Stanley Cup championship next year

179
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:44.444
they're all like.

180
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:46.873
<v 19>That.</v>

181
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.140
What was funny though was their reaction made me laugh when I blew out part of

182
00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:54.830
the candles without the rest of them so I guess we're not winning next year but

183
00:11:54.831 --> 00:11:59.180
I really want to thank everybody that came out I had such a fucking great time

184
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.190
both shows and that really is one of the great cities

185
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:07.860
that I've ever been to.

186
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:08.723
<v 8>I love that place.</v>

187
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:13.730
I wish I had more time to spend there but you know I kind of flew up and I was

188
00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:20.571
just tired from that whole week of running around running my yap promoting this

189
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.850
show so I just sort of went into the fetal position before the show I didn't get

190
00:12:23.851 --> 00:12:25.140
to walk around to see anything.

191
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.500
<v 1>Then I did the two shows and then I went right back to bed</v>

192
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:37.580
went right to bed and got eight hours sleep and then woke up and went to my

193
00:12:37.581 --> 00:12:42.581
first Formula One race which I have to tell you lived up to the hype.

194
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.850
<v 20>I don't even know where to begin.</v>

195
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:56.110
As far as like going out to just see seeing this event that I don't even know

196
00:12:56.181 --> 00:12:59.690
what a year and a half ago I I sort of knew the sport existed.

197
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.040
I mean I knew about it but I wasn't you know doing all this shit.

198
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.700
Yeah I've.
Been watching every single race.

199
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:12.080
<v 1>So now to finally show up you know with that going on was like</v>

200
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.510
I don't know how to explain it like the cars fumes just seen the cars alone was

201
00:13:18.511 --> 00:13:21.990
like seen a celebrity to me like oh that's a Ferrari.

202
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.330
That's that's the fucking that's the Mercedes team.

203
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.400
Ah there's the fuchsia the force India team you know.

204
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.160
<v 16>It was.</v>

205
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.160
It was just an incredible experience we get there we you know we park and you

206
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.600
take a little boat over.
And

207
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.750
I know it was crazy you know Doug the guy does all the wrap up shit you know the

208
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.480
interviews and everything before and after well bucks and he came out to the

209
00:13:50.481 --> 00:13:54.320
show he was telling us she got to come down to the pit area whatever the fuck

210
00:13:54.321 --> 00:13:55.320
they call it the.

211
00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.940
I forget what the fuck they call it we had these sick ass passes and we had just

212
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:06.970
under a luminosity level seats you know every time you think you're in the best

213
00:14:08.001 --> 00:14:11.720
place she could watch and you find out there's another more air conditioned area

214
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.040
with even older manicured looking dudes with the younger hotter looking chicks

215
00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:23.740
every time you think you're at the feet of yet the final level of Dante's

216
00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:29.531
Inferno there's another fucking level it's incredible you know there was a hope

217
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:35.060
there was one other level above where the hell we were at and that's where the

218
00:14:35.061 --> 00:14:40.061
guys look like you knows what Celine Dion's husband used to look like you know

219
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:46.660
that guy and he was a bald dude he basically looked like Rob Reiner but he was

220
00:14:47.811 --> 00:14:52.811

222
00:14:57.341 --> 00:15:00.970

223
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.980

They're always on the French Riviera no he's in a fucking yard they got private

227
00:15:23.651 --> 00:15:28.360
jets and then there's always some mirror cat look and chicks sit next to him

228
00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:33.780
that's like fuck and like you know 21 22 and you're like Oh my God

229
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.920
did you pull up in your fucking world cup sailboat you know go into a town and

230
00:15:44.731 --> 00:15:48.480
just walk up to these broke people just you know genetic you know they hit the

231
00:15:48.481 --> 00:15:53.481

know the open toed fuckin sandals

233
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:04.360
I remember that guy Celine Dion's husband I just remember he not only was he Bob

234
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.300
but his head was perfectly tanned so it didn't even look bad and then he just

235
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:13.301
had this angelic white hair on this side same thing with like the his beard

236
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.990

237
00:16:21.991 --> 00:16:25.500

238
00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:30.501
know what was in there but you can see why so Celine was just so in love that

239
00:16:31.561 --> 00:16:36.180
she was punching herself in the fucking chest every night couldn't get way to

240
00:16:36.181 --> 00:16:37.014

241
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:43.600
I mean if that's what is fucking hair and then side of his head and his beard

242
00:16:43.601 --> 00:16:48.400
look can you imagine this guy's pubes must adhere to like a.

<v 1>Perfectly tanned junk you know what this fucking angelic winged pubes I can't</v>

244
00:16:56.511 --> 00:17:01.511
even imagine that that yeah we didn't get to that level we got to the level

245
00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:07.080
where was a bunch of people like just fucking real race fans we got to the level

246
00:17:07.081 --> 00:17:11.560
where we had a canopy and I still got a fuckin sunburn that's how what I am you

247
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:15.560
know cause the sun wasn't on my head but it hit my fuckin chest so get off I can

248
00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:20.561
read and but I want to thank everybody at the F1 race everyone was so fucking

249
00:17:21.851 --> 00:17:22.360
cool.

250
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.650
<v 20>So long story short</v>

251
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:30.430
I'm gonna make it funny man I had such a good time so we're sitting like if you

252
00:17:30.461 --> 00:17:35.461
watch a replay of the race when right when they come out of the pit you know to

253
00:17:36.971 --> 00:17:40.750
rejoin the race right where they hit the acceleration you know they've got to

254
00:17:40.751 --> 00:17:44.080
drive like fucking two and a half miles an hour and then they get to this point

255
00:17:44.081 --> 00:17:45.350
where they can fucking take off.

256
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:50.400
Right right where they take off was where we were sitting and we could see turn

257
00:17:51.491 --> 00:17:53.470
1 and then turn 2 and

258
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.540
it's a whole other game trying to watch the race.

259
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.690
When you're there if you don't have like I mean I wish I bought like a radio so

260
00:18:04.691 --> 00:18:08.200
I could have figured out what the fuck was going on because I didn't know what

261
00:18:08.201 --> 00:18:09.130
happened to Vettel.

262
00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.000
<v 8>I didn't know that the Red Bull guy you know.
Who was it.</v>

263
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:18.750
<v 17>Max Max Maximilian there Max for a stamp and right he clipped the front of his</v>

264
00:18:20.831 --> 00:18:21.100
car.

265
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.890
<v 1>I had no idea what was going on.
I know he paid it really early.</v>

266
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.040
I was like What the fuck.

267
00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.680
And all of a sudden he went from second place to like 15th or last in the race.

268
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.590
So I kind of knew but I had no I had no idea what happened.

269
00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.710
I didn't know that that fuckin what's his face there.

270
00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.560
KIMMI Reagan and I didn't know that he had problems with his brakes.

271
00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.860
<v 8>We had no fucking idea no idea</v>

272
00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:47.730
and it was so fucking loud yet ear plugs in and the guy's talking over but it's

273
00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:51.840
just so goddamn loud
I'm jumping all over this story.

274
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.400
We took a little boat over.

275
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.330
We parked in the garage and then you get this little boat takes you over there.

276
00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.130
And then we'll hook this up.

277
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.630
<v 1>Down in the hole fucking whatever the fuck they call it because of the pee and</v>

278
00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.440
we got to look at the garages and all that shit in and we went into the Red Bull

279
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:13.450
one Jimmy Verde and families got to meet Daniel Ricardo who I famously called

280
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:20.690
rigger Ricky Reagan or some shit Daniel Ricardo nicest fucking guy ever.

281
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.800
And by the way I want to be in the shape of an F1 driver.

282
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.300
This guy's a fucking ridiculous.
This guy was like I don't know.

283
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.350
He's like five elevens he's got me by an inch.

284
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.370
So he was probably 30 pounds lighter than me.

285
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.260
Fucking amazing.

286
00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.040
And he goes yeah we get weighed twice a day right before the Reno during the

287
00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:49.041
race week or whatever it was joking about some fucking broccoli thing that drink

288
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.610
he just drank and how much weight they lose when they're in the car and all that

289
00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:54.444
type of stuff.

290
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.800
I really want to thank Red Bull Racing how for how cool and nice they were and

291
00:19:58.801 --> 00:19:59.634
everything.

292
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.080
They were kind of the exact opposite of this fucking cunt we met from the

293
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:05.100
Ferrari team.

294
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:09.480
Granted it was after the race and I thought it was one of the guys was cool.

295
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.560
He was really really nice.

296
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.610
But the first guy we met was a cunt but I think he thought we were being cunts

297
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.810
because I didn't understand.

298
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.390
I knew that Ferrari was having a nightmare of a day but I didn't realize the

299
00:20:21.391 --> 00:20:22.224
level.

300
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.460
I mean I thought was so cool that you know Vettel was able to work his way back

301
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:28.470
up to the field I was kind of paying attention to him.

302
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.510
I wasn't paying attention to Kimi so when I went down there I didn't know what

303
00:20:33.511 --> 00:20:36.270
to say the guy was like after the race all this Ferrari guys are like smoking

304
00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:39.750
cigarettes too it's fucking hilarious I'll stand up fucking smoked cigarettes

305
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.360
and I just walked up and I was just like

306
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:45.560
I was just like a man is it OK.

307
00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.100
First he gets a picture with you because you want a picture with somebody from

308
00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:50.950
Ferrari you know he's half Sicilian you know.

309
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.990
So the guy Sicily is like yeah yeah and I said hey you know you know good race

310
00:20:55.991 --> 00:20:59.290
today you know you're the guys at least you got power the forced India guys.

311
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.670
And his face just dropped and

312
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:10.310
I swear to God in his face I understood the entire history and the pressure of

313
00:21:12.431 --> 00:21:17.090
working on Ferrari like he just looked as I can't even.

314
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:22.260
<v 21>He didn't say anything and then he just went and I said I was trying to make it</v>

315
00:21:22.511 --> 00:21:24.750
nice again I was I don't need a good race.

316
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.850
When they had a terrific race he probably thought they didn't know this was my

317
00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:30.820
first event so you probably thought I was fucked with a prize probably not a

318
00:21:30.821 --> 00:21:33.960
cunt but you could have seen this guy's face fucking drop it.

319
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.630
I'd say if an actor ever did with this guy's face did in a movie you'd win an

320
00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:41.140
Oscar and now first he's got to stand next to him and first he can read people

321
00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:43.810
better than me.
You know he's half Sicilian half Greek it's fucking over right.

322
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.850
So he feels uncomfortable so I'm trying to make it nice going like all right

323
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.750
this is gonna be a legendary picture or whatever.

324
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:54.730
And then he goes on and takes a picture and then the fuckin the guy we thought

325
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:56.650
it was a cunt but probably thought we were a cunt.

326
00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:01.540
He goes No you just missed the legend go by go he goes out Vettel Vettel just

327
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:03.130
walked by.
We're like really Where'd he go.

328
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.520
He goes I went right now and we believed him.

329
00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.990
And then Andrew figured out later that he was just fucking with us.

330
00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.530
<v 8>And then we met somebody else in the fryer team which was really nice.</v>

331
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.550
<v 17>But
anyways it was a</v>

332
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.330
it was just an amazing fucking time.
I really no.

333
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.170
<v 8>I don't I don't know how to do it justice it's it was too much to try to</v>

334
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.570
put all into why I guess I started at the fuckin middle and then went back to

335
00:22:32.571 --> 00:22:35.390
the beginning and then I went to the end of the fucking race just know in the

336
00:22:35.391 --> 00:22:40.391
end we were sitting outside of Lewis Hamilton's garage you know after everybody

337
00:22:42.151 --> 00:22:46.270
left and there was all these fans there and they introduced the whole team.

338
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:51.290
The crowd goes crazy like racing's really big with the fans like they do all

339
00:22:51.901 --> 00:22:55.740
this extra stuff they're great so then they would chant Lewis's name and Lewis

340
00:22:55.741 --> 00:23:00.150
comes out again with another bottle of champagne he sprays it on his team and

341
00:23:00.151 --> 00:23:03.840
then sort of whipped around in our direction and we actually got hit with the

342
00:23:03.841 --> 00:23:08.070
champagne from Lewis Hamilton That's how fucking close we were so I don't know

343
00:23:08.071 --> 00:23:12.510
how to ever top that experience but like I'd like to say again thank you to

344
00:23:12.511 --> 00:23:16.830
everybody who you know Bruce Hales and all those guys from just for laughs for

345
00:23:16.831 --> 00:23:19.710
hooking us up we had a great time and

346
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.340
yeah I don't know what to tell you but I kind of realised just going through

347
00:23:25.341 --> 00:23:28.070
talking to everybody and like the garages and shit just how

348
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.040
it's like Mercedes won't give Red Bull.

349
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.260
<v 1>They try to buy an engine I guess from Mercedes and they're like Yeah.</v>

350
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.250
Now we're not giving you that basically because Daniel Ricardo's too good of a

351
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:41.200
fuckin driver we don't need that competition.

352
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.960
However they will sell it to other fuckin teams like I think.
Force India.

353
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.760
They gave them but it's not the same Mercedes engine that they have.

354
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:55.910
It's really fucking weird like it's like Ah well we'll sell an engine to a team

355
00:23:55.911 --> 00:23:56.870
that we know we can beat.

356
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.180
So we can make the money and help pay for the fucking team.

357
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:00.960
But we're not going to give it to a good team.

358
00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:07.290
But I don't get how like Red Bull when when what's his face

359
00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:14.010
Vettel was driving for one like fucking three in a row four in a row and nobody

360
00:24:14.231 --> 00:24:15.064
could catch him.

361
00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.420
It's like what what what the fuck happened to Red Bulls engine over the last

362
00:24:19.421 --> 00:24:23.440
four years.
You know I don't.
I got my fuckin program here

363
00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.440
and I hope I'm not boring you guys to shit.

364
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.190
I'm going to get off this quickly because I know that for me to start talking

365
00:24:30.191 --> 00:24:34.510
about driving for fucking 20 God well at taxing one was a taxi was a nice

366
00:24:34.511 --> 00:24:35.950
mainstream story wasn't it.

367
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:41.620
<v 22>Doesn't that count for anything you fucking assholes
know.</v>

368
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:46.710
If I look up the Mercedes team they've only been around since

369
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:49.980
2010.

370
00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:55.260
<v 3>Now I know Mercedes has been racing cars since the 1950s.</v>

371
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.380
I don't get how the Ferrari team's been around since 1950.

372
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.970
<v 1>Is this like some AMG shit.</v>

373
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.080
I don't have to look up the history of these teams because I found it

374
00:25:04.081 --> 00:25:06.330
fascinating because after a while I was like You know what.

375
00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.240
I'm not gonna root for Mercedes and fucking I'm gonna join this sport and then

376
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.450
root for the fucking Yankees or Red Sox.

377
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:14.460
<v 3>Mean that's too easy right.</v>

378
00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:18.370
So I kind of like I like Red Bull and I like fucking the.

379
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.070
Force India.

380
00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.040
<v 8>Does because I had a great time when I did that gig in Mumbai.</v>

381
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.780
Comedians over there were fucking hilarious breaking balls and stuff but.

382
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.340
<v 3>But then I saw the owner of the team or wherever the director is is just some</v>

383
00:25:32.341 --> 00:25:33.420
fuckin white dude.

384
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:40.260
<v 15>Force India is there like a fucking Ozzy's looking dude anywhere in there.</v>

385
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.390
That's fucking you know you figure with a name like that.

386
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:47.500
There's gotta be an Indian dude.

387
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.730
<v 9>You know
I don't fucking know.
Anyways</v>

388
00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.190
what am I talking about.

389
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.670
<v 1>So I had a great fucking time.
How about that.
I'll leave it at that.</v>

390
00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:01.060
I'll leave it at that and what's his face.

391
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:06.080
Lewis Hamilton got twenty five fucking points and now he's only what like 12

392
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.080
behind.

393
00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.920
<v 23>He was twenty five behind that was the one exciting thing was watching Vettel</v>

394
00:26:10.921 --> 00:26:15.921
work his way through the field oh and I forgot to say oh the fuckin force India

395
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:21.120
guys even if you're not into this sport they were going back and forth with one

396
00:26:21.121 --> 00:26:22.350
another.
Right.

397
00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:26.280
The young kid was trying to get through and the Perez guy wouldn't let him throw

398
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.560
would not let him throw right was the other guy's name all Conde wanted to get

399
00:26:31.561 --> 00:26:33.270
through and he wouldn't get him through.

400
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.160
So while they were fighting with each other right in fourth and fifth place

401
00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.630
Vettel you know divide and conquer conquer went by both of them in the last

402
00:26:42.631 --> 00:26:46.770
couple of fucking laps and ended up getting into fourth place which was fucking

403
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:51.771
huge you know and in a way fucked over the Mercedes team you know and I bet they

404
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:56.310
called him up and say Hey next time you fucking fuchsia cunts want one of our

405
00:26:56.311 --> 00:26:57.300
fucking engines.

406
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.710
All right we give you one of our goddamn engines is the Zagat treat us you block

407
00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:06.240
the goddamn Ferraris we'll get you a faster car out front.

408
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:10.800
<v 24>The fuck are we doing here.</v>

409
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.630
<v 3>I'll give you a fucking Volkswagen engine you do that shit to me again right.</v>

410
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:21.810
<v 9>That must have happened somewhere along the line that that had to have happened.</v>

411
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.850
So
is the heist team the American team.

412
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.580
<v 3>It's so fucking confusing.</v>

413
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.090
I'm sitting here looking at McLaren Honda McLaren and me fucking worked on

414
00:27:33.091 --> 00:27:36.360
Mercedes and Honda used to dominate the sport.

415
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.260
Now this poor bastard every time he goes around the fucking lap dude it's like

416
00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:41.320
he's driving a whoop de.

417
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.340
That thing just shits the fuckin bed every time he he took a fuckin race off one

418
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:50.770
of one of those guys Fernando Alonso I think he said you know fuck this I wanna

419
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.310
go I'm going to take a race off that's how bad your engines are and I'm going to

420
00:27:54.311 --> 00:27:58.220
go drive the Indy 500 and I believe when he went there is cause engine quit too.

421
00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:02.450
<v 20>I'm not sure I've been flying all over to help all over the hill all over Dale.</v>

422
00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.800
So we went to the race.
I got sunburned.

423
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:08.740
We saw this stuff do what we were set and we literally saw them pull their cars

424
00:28:08.741 --> 00:28:11.920
and in the end whereas both Mercedes

425
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:18.570
Hamilton and both us and then Daniel Ricardo we saw em all shake hands.

426
00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.160
They walked up the stairs and then we saw them.

427
00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:26.250
You know on the podium we were like to the side you know by the way that fucking

428
00:28:28.151 --> 00:28:31.090
trophy that you get for winning that race.

429
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:36.120
<v 3>Jesus Christ that that is one of the worst fucking trophies I've ever seen in my</v>

430
00:28:36.341 --> 00:28:37.174
life.

431
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:43.280
I think it's just the Toronto the Toronto the Canadian maple leaf.

432
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:48.050
<v 11>They just sort of have it elevated with all this stuff but it's just such a
bland</v>

433
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:54.480
they should make it like gold or something with the red outline of Canada.

434
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.343
You know what I mean.

435
00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.170
Red white for Canada and then you put a bunch of gold in there.

436
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.450
You shine it up a little bit.

437
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.350
<v 3>Jesus Christ candidate all your imagination go into the Stanley Cup.</v>

438
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.800
I was really disappointed with that.

439
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.390
What's funny was the one that Lewis Hamilton got was bad enough.

440
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.410
The one that Daniel Ricardo again I swear to God he's probably using the prop

441
00:29:15.411 --> 00:29:16.850
open some door in his house.

442
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.970
<v 25>That's how I got to look this thing up.
I really have to.</v>

443
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:24.640
I got to trash this fuckin thing.
Fuck it.

444
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.820
Come on.
Bill can you believe that cab driver.
I deserve to be punished.

445
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:32.580
I mean that's the kind of mindset that's I end up driving a fuckin Cabinet's 70

446
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.090
years of age.
He's probably an immigrant.

447
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.880
People are fucking racist and they probably never got an opportunity.

448
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.720
I mean that's another thing.

449
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.910
But that's that's that always can happen to you know.
All right fair enough.
Hey.

450
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.540
Fair enough.
You know who knows.

451
00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.560
All right Montreal can I can I can add Bluetooth candidate.

452
00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:54.203
Grand.

453
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.190
<v 1>Prix.
You know he's enjoying</v>

454
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.620
me talking about this right now is Nashville Predator fans

455
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.770
because the last thing maybe it looks a little bit better it's got some fuckin

456
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.230
it's got a little gold in there

457
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:15.700
yes it's sitting on like rebar it's just there's just no imagination

458
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.280
I mean could you please put like a red outline around the gold.

459
00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:23.730
You do something the fucking dress this up.

460
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.170
I swear to God if for some fucked up reason I ever won that race I don't know I

461
00:30:32.171 --> 00:30:37.171
got so into this game this this fucking sport and I somehow lost 90 pounds so I

462
00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:42.541
could actually not be you know causing the car to lose and I somehow beat Lewis

463
00:30:43.421 --> 00:30:48.421
Hamilton and Vettel in a non Mercedes non Ferrari engine car if they brought

464
00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:52.840
that trophy out to me you know and I just lost fuckin five pounds.

465
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:57.280
Pierce and myself as I'm driving around the goddamn track I would I just would

466
00:30:57.281 --> 00:31:01.450
be like yeah you keep that thing you keep it why don't you go back and finish

467
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.580
making that trophy and then I'll accept it.

468
00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:10.960
I'm sure that wouldn't cause any any international incident.

469
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:16.650
<v 3>Speaking of an international incident what the fuck the Nashville Predators of</v>

470
00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.440
the dreaded.
I lost sight of the puck and blew the whistle.

471
00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.480
Welcome Nashville Predator fans.

472
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.380
<v 1>Welcome.</v>

473
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:31.380
You guys are now officially been baptized as hockey fans OK.

474
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:38.250
Up until now you were expansion expansion of.

475
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.580
<v 3>Hockey fans.</v>

476
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.800
I didn't respect you even with your chance even with Smash ville even though how

477
00:31:44.801 --> 00:31:45.820
far you've come.

478
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:51.060
I could not fully accept you as fans of the National Hockey League until I saw.

479
00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:57.800
Your team in a Stanley Cup Final score a goal.

480
00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.750
But the ref lost sight of the puck and it's waved off.

481
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.730
Now you've earned your stripes.
Now you have a ref that you hate.

482
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:11.430
You know now you got someone people are going to send letters to and fucking

483
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.410
make death threats and all the other people take it too fucking seriously.

484
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.630
Can you imagine that poor fucking referee.

485
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:21.910
Listen that Nashville Predator fans somehow figuring out his phone phone number.

486
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.070
<v 14>Yeah but let me tell you what.</v>

487
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:29.100
You fucking French mother fucker five kids want to see you again I swear to God

488
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.190
I swear to God.

489
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:36.520
<v 3>I swear to God buddy I've got some farming equipment I'll figure out how to</v>

490
00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:41.521
unrest it just to run you over with that after I shoot you in the book and face.

491
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.040
I can't imagine the threats he's getting like I shouldn't even talk about it.

492
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:50.900
<v 1>It's probably not even funny.
Unbelievable.</v>

493
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:56.110
Un fucking believable but I told you guys I fucking told you I picked the

494
00:32:56.151 --> 00:32:58.800
penguins.
I can think I have.
I don't know somewhere around the first round.

495
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:02.630
I know all these guys look I don't see every staffer.
I didn't see anybody.

496
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.560
That's what you know after Webb wants the Blackhawks got knocked out.

497
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.540
I was just like yeah fuck that's over.
They're going to win.

498
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.730
And then I lost faith with them.

499
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.140
You know what their goaltending towards the end of the auto series.

500
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:15.630
They prove me wrong.
And then there was that game.
There was that game.

501
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:18.190
Game for that the predators won.

502
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.370
But that fucking look on Crosby's face when he scored that goal and he didn't

503
00:33:22.371 --> 00:33:25.430
put his hands up.
Like I scored a goal.

504
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:30.230
He put them out to the side you know gathering his fucking teammates in like

505
00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:35.231
that's 1 like total fucking business look on his face and

506
00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:43.140
congratulations to the penguins you fuck non flights dirty birds you did it

507
00:33:44.201 --> 00:33:48.550
again.
That's Crosby's third that's Malkin stirred.

508
00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:53.660
They now have one more than the fuckin great duo of Mario Lemieux and ya Amir

509
00:33:54.631 --> 00:33:56.630
Jago.
So that's that's really saying something.

510
00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:00.710
<v 26>They got five they got fucking five.</v>

511
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:06.440
<v 3>You know I don't want to start anything but they almost have twice as many as</v>

512
00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:08.210
the fuckin flyers.

513
00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.900
<v 15>Twice as many as the flyers.
Philadelphia.</v>

514
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:16.610
You're gonna sit there you're gonna take that shit.

515
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.660
You're gonna have to during the off season.

516
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.050
Same way same way I do as a brown fan.

517
00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:26.710
I believe we have six Stanley Cups but we've been around since like Charles

518
00:34:26.711 --> 00:34:28.630
Lindbergh.
So it's different.

519
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:31.780
Although the penguins have been around for 50 years already.

520
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:34.680
<v 1>Just like Dent who would have thought</v>

521
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:41.310
anyways let's talk about old Billy no fun no fun Billy what's the deal.

522
00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:43.540
No fun Billy.

523
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:49.900
So after telling you I was going to have no fun you know it was my birthday.

524
00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:55.020
I was in Montreal but even then I didn't go fucking nuts like the last night we

525
00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:59.200
went to my favorite cigar bar up in Montreal.

526
00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.630
<v 27>We went to stockings and</v>

527
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.780
they and a couple of fucking Grey Goose.

528
00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:10.060
<v 13>Even though I like Belvedere.
Grey Goose is the Pepsi of of</v>

529
00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:12.550
vodka.

530
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:16.750
You what I mean I always like Coca Cola had the bite you know give you your

531
00:35:16.751 --> 00:35:21.230
fuckin right dear friend you know oh speaking of that.

532
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:26.260
What about cold lotion cold lotion of the week would have to be they.

533
00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.820
The Nationals for predators scored a legal goal and the guy lost the fucking

534
00:35:30.821 --> 00:35:31.510
side of the park.

535
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:36.510
<v 18>That is that is that is NHL referee called lotion right there.</v>

536
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:43.600
That's exactly what the fuck that was.
But yeah.
So I'm not a big grey goose fan.

537
00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.560
<v 1>You know I feel like I'm much like that cab driver that feels like he should be</v>

538
00:35:49.561 --> 00:35:50.394
punished.

539
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.970
I feel like when I'm drinking that I should be feeling the effects of what I'm

540
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:57.750
doing to my body.
I don't want it watered down.
You got to drink the gas.

541
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:59.070
You know I like Belvedere.

542
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.550
It's got a little more of a kick to it although I'm not a big Vodka guy.

543
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.610
So I had that I fucking smoked a cigar after the race.

544
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:10.260
Ten thirty or freckles was in bed.
OK.

545
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:15.120
So when my alarm went off at five thirty in the morning from my early flight to

546
00:36:15.121 --> 00:36:19.680
get back to my lovely wife and daughter
I was fine.

547
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:25.010
I was packed I was ready to fucking go.
Everything was fine.

548
00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:30.590
And
but now it's official now back and it's just like

549
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:36.620
my big thing this year as a 49 year old is eight hours sleep.

550
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:41.350
I gotta do it I gotta do it because as much as I like going out and partying and

551
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.210
doing all that shit.

552
00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:47.620
<v 18>Nothing at my age feels better than fucking eight hours sleep so I'm hoping that</v>

553
00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:53.630
I can latch onto this lifestyle and have that be my new fucking drug.

554
00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:00.820
Eight hours sleep
Yeah I gotta do it.

555
00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:03.970
<v 8>I don't know how to drink recreationally I gotta be honest with you I just don't</v>

556
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:09.520
know.
I just if I'm doing it I'm fuckin doing it's like I got into F1.

557
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:12.520
<v 1>Now look at me I'm spending half the fucking podcast by driving you guys up the</v>

558
00:37:12.521 --> 00:37:17.521
goddamn wall talking about this shit and now you know I went to my first race

559
00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:20.920
I'm going to the one in Austin and then immediately I just go Well that's this

560
00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:24.610
that's two down to down on a 20 if I do two a year in ten years I can fucking go

561
00:37:24.611 --> 00:37:29.110
to all of a you know sometimes that works for me sometimes it doesn't.

562
00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.140
You know it works for me as far as like trying to succeed in life because I just

563
00:37:32.141 --> 00:37:33.760
get into something and I fuckin do it.

564
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:36.740
And next thing you know I crossed the finish line.

565
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:42.270
But you know when you apply that same sort of philosophy to drinking it it

566
00:37:42.521 --> 00:37:43.354
doesn't work.

567
00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:49.300
It's all about after you have the drink if you have the water afterwards and

568
00:37:49.301 --> 00:37:52.460
you're sort of sober yourself back up again.
I don't know.

569
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:55.560
I don't think I'm cut out for it.

570
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:59.760
So I need to take I need I've been needing to take time off for a good fucking

571
00:37:59.761 --> 00:38:00.594
year.

572
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.340
<v 25>So that's what I'm doing right now.</v>

573
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.070
I'm not saying I'm not going to drink for a fucking year but I'm definitely.

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:56.130
<v 1>Good lord these fucking people holy shit insane the fucking stories.</v>

587
00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:04.470
Waking up with no teeth get bailed out of jail and fucking walking out with no

588
00:39:05.231 --> 00:39:09.210
shoes right across the street to a liquor store I mean

589
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.040
maybe that's like an extreme version.

590
00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.790
<v 8>I don't fucking know.
Where's Leslie.</v>

<v 9>Where the hell is it.

594
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.040
God somebody's got to correct me on Kryptonite this week

595
00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.440
you guys just don't fucking let up do you.

596
00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.860
<v 6>Unreal real Lance we call it I guess the fuckin superhero people they take it so</v>

597
00:39:34.861 --> 00:39:37.020

All right.

598
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:42.080
<v 1>I have advertising if this thing ever loads come on loaded up I never even</v>

599
00:39:42.371 --> 00:39:44.620
finished talking about the cable's shit.
I watch.

600
00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:49.330
You know I pay so much fucking money for the Internet and I pay so much fuckin

601
00:39:49.331 --> 00:39:51.760
money for cable.
This shit doesn't work.

602
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:54.220
You know that the F1 race didn't even record

603
00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.300
it started to record.

604
00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.630
There was a stat shaking commercial that you can't fast forward past.

605
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.990
Because I wanted to see what would happen at the beginning of the race and then

606
00:40:03.991 --> 00:40:05.940
you know when I went online and just found it.

607
00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:10.350
So maybe that's what I need to do to do that.
I have no idea.

608
00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:14.400
Oh and I think you bring up the fucking Cavaliers.

609
00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:19.300
Holy shit what a game.
What a fucking game.

610
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:24.220
48 first quarter points eighty six points in the first half.

611
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:27.060
Un fucking believable.

612
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.240
And it was still it took him halfway through the fourth quarter that's how

613
00:40:32.241 --> 00:40:33.560
little competition there is.

614
00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:37.430
But you know something I think when that little fucking fellow there goes shoots

615
00:40:37.431 --> 00:40:40.370
the three pointers is probably a foot taller than me but he looks like a little

616
00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:44.390
fellow on the NBA court when he fucking pretended to take a shit.

617
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:48.560
<v 3>That was one of the most classless things I've ever seen.</v>

618
00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:54.100
He pretends to take a shit and then runs up the court wipes his ass and then

619
00:40:54.711 --> 00:40:59.220
wipes it on the cavalier logo and then afterwards like yeah I was in the moment.

620
00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:02.330
<v 1>I don't remember what I did.
Get the fuck out of here.</v>

621
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:05.610
Get the fuck out of here.
You don't matter what you do.

622
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:09.680

You fucking mind shitting on the floor.

623
00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:14.090
<v 6>I don't know why I got a hit pass.</v>

624
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:18.630
I get it applies to get open this fucking thing.
All right I'm back.

625
00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:19.523
I'm back.

626
00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:23.010
<v 9>Went out the kitchen as you saw my dinner salmon</v>

627
00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:29.170
salad with salmon.
Good

628
00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:32.930
<v 6>Was a tragedy about salmon is how many salmon get killed a year.</v>

629
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.450
People aren't even appreciated.

630
00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:40.380
You know it's like tuna minus the personality it's just like a fucking choker

631
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.470
with Keith Robinson about that.
We went out to dinners.

632
00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:48.400
You know the fish option one of was just salmon.
And he's just like ag.

Jesus Christ.

<v 1>It's like salmon is salmon is a fuckin middle act.
You know.</v>

635
00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:58.920

<v 30>You know it's just another thing that's harder for women you know you have no</v>

718
00:47:32.731 --> 00:47:36.390
idea how difficult things are for us somebody write an article

719
00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:43.060
like whether you're reflecting on the day or with someone you love when you have

720
00:47:43.071 --> 00:47:47.570
a great glass of wine it enhances the moment.
Wink understands this.

721
00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:52.720
<v 3>It's why they started they're going to give you access to exceptional wines from</v>

<v 1>You know what I like a fucking borrow.</v>

724
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:04.980
If you don't know shit about wine go to wink and get a burro get one that's a

725
00:48:05.691 --> 00:48:06.524
little fruity.

726
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:09.010
<v 6>That's the one I like I don't like those acidic ones.</v>

727
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:14.420
That's a nice one and then there's one that's sort of off the same vine begins

728
00:48:14.421 --> 00:48:19.100
with an end.
I can't remember Newbury Street in Napoli.

729
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:20.143
I don't fucking know.

730

733
00:48:30.381 --> 00:48:31.310
interesting wines.

734
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:35.030
Actually customize to your palate to be shipped directly to your door.

735
00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:39.800
Every month is a great way to learn about wine by the way you know because it's

736
00:48:39.801 --> 00:48:40.880
a very intimidating thing.

737
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:44.930
I found that Borrello and I've stuck with that ever since then I haven't dared

738
00:48:44.931 --> 00:48:48.830
fuck with anything French or anything I would do this if I wasn't gonna be

739
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:51.460
boring Billy here.

779
00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:33.330
<v 20>Oh my God.
Oh my God dude.
Can you imagine if they fucking win this one.</v>

780
00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:37.870
Then they going back to Cleveland.
This is how quickly it can turn around.

781
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:43.600
This is how fast it can fucking turn around.
It would be amazing.

782
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:46.780
I am not.
I even enjoyed a fucking game in a long time like that.

783
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:50.440
I was at a bar of course.

784
00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:55.680
Who's kidding who I haven't met Billy no fun I've been Billy less fun today and

785
00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:57.130
by start Billy no fun.

786
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:04.280
<v 34>It's just the Cavaliers have to do what they did the other night.</v>

787
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:08.880
Again tonight.
You know.
And then again and then again.

788
00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:11.830
But each game I think would be less.

789
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:17.370
And then you know do you realize that at the Cavaliers come back and do this

790
00:52:17.371 --> 00:52:19.320
they'd be the first NBA team to ever do it.

791
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:24.830
And then secondly Steph Curry taking a shot miming taking a shit wiping his ass.

792
00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:29.690
<v 1>And does have one of the most classless fuckin things you've ever seen in your</v>

793
00:52:29.691 --> 00:52:31.960
life.
It's like fucking how it goes.

794
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:36.210
<v 12>Dad
you know what I mean.</v>

795
00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:40.460
<v 1>I don't understand.
I don't.
I just.</v>

796
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:45.430
It just makes me feel old like when he does the no look pass and then he fucking

797
00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:49.990
eat he starts miming like you know he has like binoculars on it he looks at the

798
00:52:49.991 --> 00:52:51.390
crowd doesn't even look at the end of this.

799
00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.040
It's like did Magic Johnson ever do that.

800
00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:59.160
I just I for the fucking life of me I will never understand that.

801
00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:03.480
That's like that dance and I told you when I was at the game and there was some

802
00:53:03.481 --> 00:53:06.360
six year old kid dancing which should have been adorable but he had a look on

803
00:53:06.361 --> 00:53:08.180
his face like he wanted to beat the shit out of me.

804
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.680
Societies don't understand what's going on with people

805
00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:16.810
just a complete lack of class and humility is you know and this is coming from a

806
00:53:16.811 --> 00:53:19.020
drunk.
And even I'm noticing

807
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:23.850
anyways kryptonite everybody.

808
00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:28.670
Here we go let's do some of these these these letters here.
Hello Bill.

809
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.130
Hello person.
I don't know.

810
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:37.660
I know you don't give a shit but I refuse to stand by and watch you be an idiot.

811
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:43.770
But the story of Krypton is the planet.
Last week I was talking about kryptonite.

812
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.170
I go isn't it like fucking natural to his planet.

813
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:51.290
How can Superman be allergic to kryptonite from his planet.

814
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:55.980
So this guy says Krypton.

815
00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:00.890
The story of Krypton is the planet exploded from nuclear.

816
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:05.670
From a nuclear chain reaction that's nice and vague from the family back east

817
00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:11.060
caused by the planet's unceasing unstable radioactive core all right I guess

818
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:15.250
there was a little more of an explanation.

819
00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:20.550
Kryptonite being pieces of the radioactive planet that somehow reach Earth.

820
00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:26.950
OK well then shouldn't those things also affect the humans that go and get it.

821
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:32.700
<v 35>You know what I mean.
I don't understand that.</v>

822
00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:38.680
<v 34>My phone's fucking ringing.
God damn it I gotta take this</v>

823
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:41.270
I'll call back.

824
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:44.130
<v 1>OK so that's what it is.
All right.</v>

825
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:50.230
So if the vice somehow got off Earth and I went to Krypton and the Earth

826
00:54:52.041 --> 00:54:54.720
exploded they would then be our Earth.

827
00:54:55.040 --> 00:55:00.040
<v 36>Tonight and then Superman could sit right next to that radioactive rock.</v>

828
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:05.410
I know it is some point but like Bill can you just fucking play along.

829
00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:07.150
<v 3>And you just play.</v>

830
00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:11.470
You know why I'm not playing along because this guy said I can't watch you be an

831
00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:16.190
idiot.
Watch me be an idiot like Kryptonite is an actual thing.

832
00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:23.950
This is like you think I'm an idiot because I can't name all the broads on sex

833
00:55:23.951 --> 00:55:27.310
and the city and this is just so fucking made up buddy.

834
00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:32.320
<v 1>All right.
Sorry I don't know the origins of kryptonite.</v>

835
00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:34.240
What the what is that got you in life.

836
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:39.280
<v 28>Huh.
Other than a girlfriend with a retainer.</v>

837
00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:44.890
<v 1>In her 30s.
All right sex everybody I see that people should be slower to.</v>

838
00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:50.080
I think that people should be slower to jump into bed friendship and respect go

839
00:55:50.081 --> 00:55:50.914
a long way.

840
00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:55.630
Please have Nia and yourself encourage young people to respect each other more

841
00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.710
before sex.

842
00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.560
Listen I don't give public service announcements.

843
00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:04.530
I mean I just complain about it.

844
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:09.130
Look if you want to go on get fucking let go and get laid.
All right.
Use use it.

845
00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:13.570
Use a fucking protection but if you actually are looking for somebody

846
00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:19.580
to have more than that then you know.

847
00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:25.670
I think you know something.
Who I am so emotionally shut down.

848
00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:30.170
I can't even speak on this.
I don't know how I lucked out into being near.

849
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.380
It's just fucking happened all right.
But this book.

850
00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:37.160
I just love that somebody like this actually wrote in.
This is very conservative.

851
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:38.120
This is really interesting.

852
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:42.080
I think that people should be slower to jump into bed friendship and respect go

853
00:56:42.081 --> 00:56:42.914
a long way.

854
00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:48.500
Please have me and yourself encourage young peoples to respect each other more

855
00:56:48.501 --> 00:56:49.200
before sex.

856
00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:54.110
Like how many listeners do I have on my podcast that the Catholic Church is now

857
00:56:54.111 --> 00:56:57.650
trying to slip in public service announcements

858
00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:01.003
last week.

859
00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:03.830
<v 8>Well I.
Why don't I give everybody a southern accent.</v>

860
00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:08.000
Have the really the pope in a southern accent say well after we fucked all those

861
00:57:08.001 --> 00:57:09.320
kids no one's listening to us.

862
00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:14.390
<v 1>Probiotics everyone.
Hi Bill.</v>

863
00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:18.890
I was just listening to some videos on YouTube on the YouTube channel.

864
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:20.180
Bill Burr archives.

865
00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:25.160
Not sure how long ago this one was from but you are asking for more information

866
00:57:25.161 --> 00:57:28.310
from anyone on how to get clean probiotics.

867
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:34.080
And I just want to say look up Kaffir Katie F I R.

868
00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:38.740
<v 13>Camphor is really a racial slur.</v>

869
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:44.330
I believe it's a racial slur in some country for a group of people.

870
00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:48.290
<v 25>Travels so much I forget with its flying I looked it up.</v>

871
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:52.320
I hope I'm not saying that wrong.
You have to fucking apologize.

872
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:54.543
<v 12>Hang on a second.</v>

873
00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:58.420
<v 25>Clever racial slur.</v>

874
00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:00.720
I spelt it like what they just said.

875
00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:04.050
<v 16>Oh and my internet doesn't work.</v>

876
00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:08.550
<v 1>Why won't you fucking work Now why won't you work.</v>

877
00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:11.190
Yeah that ad had an

878
00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:20.780
O that's K A F F I R the word Kaffir is the term used in South Southern Africa

879
00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:30.500
to refer to a black person.
All right see that.

880
00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:35.400
I knew I wanted some sad show on how people treat each other so I must be saying

881
00:58:35.401 --> 00:58:39.270
that wrong.
I'm going to say Kiefer Sutherland.
Kiefer.

882
00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:45.500
You can buy the grains and you just add them to your organic milk milk and then

883
00:58:46.381 --> 00:58:47.640
two days later.

884
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:51.710
Approximately you have Keifer yogurt.

885
00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:56.120
Much better than the store bought ones because they get pasteurized and hence

886
00:58:56.121 --> 00:59:00.590
you lose a lot of the bacteria.
OK.
Cheers fuckface have a good one.

887
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:02.563
<v 12>All right.</v>

888
00:59:04.310 --> 00:59:05.430
<v 36>But then what about the milk.</v>

889
00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:07.800
Where do we get the milk get the milk from an organic cow.

890
00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:13.320
<v 9>What I just lay off the booze.
I just do that.
Would that be easier.</v>

891
00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:20.060
<v 36>All right lady needing advice don't want to go to a male friend's wedding.</v>

892
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:25.170
<v 1>Oh this is great.
I can give you advice on this.</v>

893
00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:30.200
My girlfriend's ex was gross lady needing advice don't want to go to male

894
00:59:31.621 --> 00:59:36.230
friends wedding my girlfriend's ex was gross.

895
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:40.540
<v 8>I don't care.
Okay.
Hi Bill.</v>

896
00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:42.220
<v 37>I'm a 23 year old guy.</v>

897
00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:48.580
What the fuck is this.
I think.

898
00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:54.650
<v 1>The lady needing advice somehow got cut off.
So this is a different one.</v>

899
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:56.660
My girlfriend's ex was gross.

900
00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:00.500
Always the lady needing advice don't want to go to a male friend's wedding.

901
01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:04.550
I will get to the bottom of that by Thursday.
All right.
Hi Bill.

902
01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:09.110
I am a 23 year old guy and I recently moved in with my 23 year old girlfriend.

903
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.990
Everything was going awesome until one drunken night.

904
01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:15.250
She starts to tell me what her ex-boyfriend was like

905
01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:18.380
OK.

906
01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:23.380
<v 36>She explains that when she was 20 she dated this guy who will call Joe who is 11</v>

907
01:00:25.401 --> 01:00:29.330
years older than her which already fucks with my head.

908
01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:33.500
So being insecure the next day I decided to look them up online and he's

909
01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:34.334
disgusting.

910
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:40.090
He's fat with an unkempt beard and really short and a pudgy face.

911
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:44.830
I just can't wrap my head around the fact that my girl being so hot young bang

912
01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.840
this slob of a man picturing the two the two together doing what we do now is

913
01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:55.991
really messed up messing me up to the point we stop having sex a week ago.

914
01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.220
I just can't get it out of my head.

915
01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:04.930
I mean at one point that disgusting mess really turned around gross Am I just

916
01:01:05.421 --> 01:01:07.760
being an asshole to I break up with her.

917
01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.430
Honestly I just don't look at her the same way anymore.

918
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:15.730
I can handle her vast sexual history buff before me but not with that mess.

919
01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.740
It's really screwing me.
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
All right.

920
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:23.120
Here's one of these things that if you were a woman they would be like well you

921
01:01:23.121 --> 01:01:24.540
have to honor that.

922
01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.220
<v 29>You have to know.
No means no.</v>

923
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:32.390
If you don't like this then you should honor that that's what you're feeling and

924
01:01:32.391 --> 01:01:37.391
your partner should if they really love you should understand this and wait

925
01:01:37.701 --> 01:01:39.950
until you're able to perform again.

926
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.990
<v 36>But that's not how it works with guys.</v>

927
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.970
You would be judged for being so fucking superficial and blah blah blah blah so

928
01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:50.690
fucking superficial writing the amount of young whores that I saw with these old

929
01:01:50.691 --> 01:01:53.580
fucking guys at that F1 race.
You know.

930
01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.100
<v 1>I don't know what you do to be honest with you but I mean this is what I would</v>

931
01:02:01.101 --> 01:02:03.710
do in the future I wouldn't Google people she used to fuck.

932
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.700
That's probably a bad thing but I'm thinking you're only twenty three years old.

933
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:12.230
How did you know.
So she used to fuck this troll probably under a bridge.

934
01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:15.020
Yeah that's kind of gross.

935
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:19.400
Probably it's some fucking one of those short but fat dicks you know.

936
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:24.470
<v 3>Peeking out of his pubes.
It's so disgusting.</v>

937
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.070
<v 38>I would talk to her about it.</v>

938
01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:32.800
<v 1>I would just say listen</v>

939
01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.880
you know I was insecure that you.

940
01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:41.860
That you were with an older man and was you know not confident about what I was

941
01:02:41.861 --> 01:02:43.000
doing with you in bed.

942
01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:46.100
And my curiosity got the best of me and I googled that guy dude.

943
01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.950
For all you know you got the wrong guy.

944
01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:50.110
<v 17>By the way might be someone with the same name who knows</v>

945
01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.170
you know I don't know but it's I don't know.

946
01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.050
<v 1>In a week's time you can't get past that.</v>

947
01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.440
I mean she's probably looking at you like you're a champion.

948
01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:07.540
DEC I was a 34 year old fat disgusting fuck and you're twenty three imagining

949
01:03:07.541 --> 01:03:12.100
and shape right.
I don't know.

950
01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:14.470
I don't think it's weird that you looked at the guy and then obviously you just

951
01:03:14.471 --> 01:03:17.110
pictured and fucking your girlfriend that's disgusting I don't think that's

952
01:03:17.111 --> 01:03:17.944
weird at all.

953
01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:22.210
Women would say it is because they always defend each other for some reason yet

954
01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:25.270
they fucking go at each other like alley cats when we're not around.

955
01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:29.963
I don't know.

956
01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:35.130
I guess it's like some female like union you know they act like union men or not

957
01:03:35.131 --> 01:03:37.480
unionized which just every man from fuck itself.

958
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.350
<v 22>Although I am sticking up for you.
So who knows.</v>

959
01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:46.730
Yeah I would know.

960
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.980
I think I talked to about just say you know do you think this makes me

961
01:03:52.981 --> 01:03:56.790
superficial she's gonna be like yes I can't believe you charge me like that I

962
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:57.763
just

963
01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:03.450
I don't judge people on looks I know you judge them on their wallets.

964
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:09.780
<v 29>If he has a nice personality and a private jet you know I don't mind a little</v>

965
01:04:09.781 --> 01:04:10.614
extra weight.

966
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.080
<v 1>You know what was going on with that guy.</v>

967
01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:16.740
Maybe that federal was taken out to a nice restaurant every night so he could

968
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:18.270
keep her and that's how he got fat.

969
01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:23.450
I don't know if have a giant head to those big fucking butcher block heads all

970
01:04:25.011 --> 01:04:26.310
right.
Jealousy issues

971
01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:32.940
jealousy issues Dear Billy rosy cheeks.
First up I'm a huge fan.

972
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:34.920
<v 36>Keep up all the great work anyway.</v>

973
01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:38.940
Me and my girlfriend of four years just moved to France.

974
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.790
She is French and all her family is here.

975
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:45.150
We lived in Australia and planned to go back to Australia in 11 months.

976
01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:53.160
<v 1>Sorry had to get that your know.
Our relationship is very serious.
We never laugh.</v>

977
01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:55.830
Not kidding.
I love this girl so much.

978
01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:58.470
They plan on popping the question soon.

979
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.500
<v 0>We were at a local bar last night.
I'm not lingual enough to talk.</v>

980
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.880
Well at a bar yet.

981
01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:10.170
So when we go out it's hard to follow what's being said but I still have a

982
01:05:10.171 --> 01:05:11.100
pretty good time.

983
01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:15.750
<v 36>After I had a few drinks with her and her friends this guy my girlfriend works</v>

984
01:05:15.751 --> 01:05:20.100
with sits with us while it's just me and her about 3 a.m.

985
01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:22.060
and I immediately felt bad.

986
01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:27.060
I'd never met this dude but when he sat down my girlfriend didn't look at me for

987
01:05:27.061 --> 01:05:32.061
10 minutes and was 100 percent focusing focused on him leaning in laughing etc

988
01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:38.610
while I sat on my phone or looking up at the sports.
Yeah dude that's not good.

989
01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:40.573
<v 24>That's not good.</v>

990
01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:45.180
<v 39>Repeat that is not good.</v>

991
01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:48.840
I couldn't understand what they were talking about and there wasn't a way I

992
01:05:48.841 --> 01:05:52.770
could be a part of it.
I didn't like the way this guy was looking at me as well.

993
01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:57.780
Twice during the time after 10 minutes she shrugged only puts her hand on my

994
01:05:57.781 --> 01:06:01.800
knee and after five more minutes I tell her we should leave.

995
01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.380
I say goodbye to her friends and walk outside.

996
01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:06.540
I smoke a cigarette and wait a bit longer.

997
01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:11.250
Go back inside and she is still at the bar with this guy paying her bill.

998
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:13.950
<v 1>Same on Beyonce's before.</v>

999
01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:17.610
When we leave to walk home I mean I'm immediately cold with her.

1000
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:21.540
You should have been she fucking embarrassed you.

1001
01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:23.300
<v 36>You absolutely should have been.</v>

1002
01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:25.140
You do what you wouldn't do that to her would you.

1003
01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:30.330
I was pretty drunk so I expressed my dislike for this situation in an overly

1004
01:06:30.331 --> 01:06:31.950
angry and and impatient manner.

1005
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:35.430
Yeah you should away t was so this one of these things where you were right and

1006
01:06:35.431 --> 01:06:37.470
then you were drunk so then you became wrong.

1007
01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:41.070
By the way you said it 20 minutes into a 30 minute walk home.

1008
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:46.050
She was tearing up pretty bad and told me she was talking about me and other

1009
01:06:46.051 --> 01:06:46.980
harmless shit.

1010
01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.920
<v 1>Bull fuckin shit</v>

1011
01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:55.680
she was talking about her dog and her dog was sitting next to it at some point

1012
01:06:55.681 --> 01:07:00.440
she will look at his face she would have done that.
She's full of shit.

1013
01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.970
<v 36>This is my gut anyways.</v>

1014
01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.250
Well the feeling stayed between us when we woke up this morning.

1015
01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:11.690
I don't get to socialize much here and I really like this bar where everybody

1016
01:07:11.691 --> 01:07:13.880
goes to.
But this felt particularly bad.

1017
01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:18.830
My girlfriend acts more natural in this country so this is awesome for her to be

1018
01:07:18.831 --> 01:07:22.880
with her fellow countrymen but we've never in four years had a conflict where

1019
01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.290
jealousy is an issue.

1020
01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:28.790
Have you ever had an issue where your girls talking to a dude and it crosses a

1021
01:07:28.791 --> 01:07:33.310
line.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
And I was drunk and I said something

1022
01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:37.050
yeah.
And that didn't end well.

1023
01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:41.850
Can I deal with this without affecting the relationship or how my girl acts

1024
01:07:41.851 --> 01:07:42.420
socially.

1025
01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:46.800
Deep down she is an absolute sweetheart and really sensitive so it's a bit

1026
01:07:46.801 --> 01:07:47.634
delicate.

1027
01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:51.840
Also there's a part of me that says maybe it's all in my head Anyways hope you

1028
01:07:51.841 --> 01:07:56.340
can help Bill any advice be great love to the birth family.
Go fuck yourself.

1029
01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:59.310
All right.
Well there's so many factors.
Yeah you could be jealous.

1030
01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:03.690
But you know if it was actually 10 minutes and she didn't look at you and then I

1031
01:08:03.691 --> 01:08:07.260
said I'll meet you outside and she said she's still in there talking to him

1032
01:08:07.261 --> 01:08:08.880
about what a fucking great guy you are.

1033
01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:12.780
At some point to you your gut doesn't lie.

1034
01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.240
<v 1>Unless your head's FUCKED UP.
ALL RIGHT.
IF IT'S COME ANY from your gut.</v>

1035
01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:22.400
If it's not coming from between your ears and it's all this fearful thoughts

1036
01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:25.640
that she had and you need to quiet that down.

1037
01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:28.910
But if it's coming from your gut you judge guts just saying this just isn't

1038
01:08:28.911 --> 01:08:32.840
fuckin right.
And who's kidding who.

1039
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:36.650
The French have different ideas about that type of shit.

1040
01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:41.090
Where you know I'm not saying everybody over there but they did that they're the

1041
01:08:41.091 --> 01:08:44.780
whole fucking having a image mistress.
You know.

1042
01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:50.270
It's not looked down upon.
It seems sort of accepted as the resentment builds.

1043
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:51.530
I don't fucking know but

1044
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:56.630
I just don't

1045
01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:03.410
that whole situation is bad and I actually think her reaching over and pat you

1046
01:09:03.411 --> 01:09:06.920
on the fucking leg to keep to keep you at bay there.

1047
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:09.590
I even think that that makes it that made it even worse.

1048
01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:16.940
Now haven't said all that you should have waited till the next morning

1049
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.800
or at least when you walked back and I just say listen I'm a little drunk right

1050
01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:26.810
now so I don't want to have a big conversation but I would like to talk to you

1051
01:09:26.811 --> 01:09:30.330
about what just went down with that guy.

1052
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.600
<v 8>Like that ever works with a woman.</v>

1053
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:37.060
<v 40>No you.
Yeah.
Knowing you can argue about you know</v>

1054
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:42.500
I don't know what to do.

1055
01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.570
<v 8>Who knows.
Who knows what the fuck that was.</v>

1056
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:47.400
<v 12>I would be like All right.</v>

1057
01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:50.400
<v 1>So is she only</v>

1058
01:09:51.930 --> 01:09:55.080
the way she is because she's in my country and she doesn't know anybody.

1059
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:57.000
But this is out.
This is how she really is.

1060
01:09:57.870 --> 01:10:02.790
Is this just a cultural thing that she used to fuck this guy and she's psyched

1061
01:10:02.791 --> 01:10:06.000
to see him and this is going to be her little fucking fling on the side when we

1062
01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:08.290
get married.
I would know what the fuck they think

1063
01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:14.140
but I would try to regroup and just be like you know.

1064
01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:21.030
<v 3>I find it hard to believe that if I was at a bar and I started speaking a</v>

1065
01:10:21.031 --> 01:10:24.870
language with another woman that you didn't know and I didn't even look at you

1066
01:10:24.871 --> 01:10:29.220
for 10 minutes and then gave you a pandering pat on the fucking leg and then

1067
01:10:29.221 --> 01:10:33.780
tried and then I went outside for a smoke and I came back and you was still in

1068
01:10:33.781 --> 01:10:35.670
there talking this person this woman.

1069
01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:40.770
If I was talking I'm saying if I was talking to this woman that I was somehow be

1070
01:10:40.771 --> 01:10:43.840
able to convince you that I was talking about you the whole time.

1071
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:50.660
<v 1>I don't know what to tell you sir other than the practice upon your French</v>

1072
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:54.530
practice up when you're French and do it without her knowing

1073
01:10:56.130 --> 01:11:01.130
get that Rosetta Stone should get you a French game in order and learn all their

1074
01:11:01.581 --> 01:11:06.560
Minaj a trois fuckin was Watts ass over there.

1075
01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:09.620
Gross.
Jiro is something like that.

1076
01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:12.050
You gotta know what the fuck he's saying.

1077
01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.510
<v 8>To your girlfriend so I don't know.
I don't want to tell you.</v>

1078
01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.280
My gut says that that was fucked up.

1079
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:22.010
I could just tell you that I'm not trying to drive you away from this woman but

1080
01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:23.180
that's that seemed fucked up.

1081
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:27.630
<v 16>If that was coming from your gut sir.
God damn it I would go with it.
All right.</v>

1098
01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:17.480
My condolences to Nashville fans.

1099
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:20.120
<v 1>Thank you to everybody.</v>

1100
01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:25.120
The Formula One race and I can't wait to watch the next race.

1101
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:28.610
I don't even know where the hell is that but I will be watching and I actually

1102
01:12:28.611 --> 01:12:33.611
finally watch the Italian Gramp Moto GP by the way trying to tape those fucking

1103
01:12:33.681 --> 01:12:38.681
races is so difficult every time I go to click it's the fuckin Moto 3 Moto 2

1104
01:12:38.831 --> 01:12:42.650
it's the fuckin time trial I always gonna click every single fucking one of a

1105
01:12:42.651 --> 01:12:43.910
before I finally get to the race.

1106
01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:47.840
I got to see the Italian when these motherfuckers were going like 220 miles an

1107
01:12:47.841 --> 01:12:52.841
hour on motorcycles and I finally figured out the KM thing every 50 miles an

1108
01:12:53.271 --> 01:12:54.760
hour is 80 kilometers.

1109
01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:00.940
So you just keep adding 80 every 50 so 50 100 miles an hour when 50 to 80 miles

1110
01:13:01.911 --> 01:13:04.660
an hour is 80 160 240.

1111
01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.510
What the fuck would that be 320 roughly.

1112
01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:11.660
<v 30>All right there you go.
Here's a little metric system for you.</v>

1113
01:13:11.690 --> 01:13:14.340
Go fuck yourselves I'll see you on Thursday.
