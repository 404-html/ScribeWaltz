00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.730
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:06.750
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for mines.
You,
Hey,

3
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.300
February 26 2018 how's it going?
How,

4
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.820
<v 0>Oh yeah.</v>

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.390
<v 1>Are you enjoying your February of 2018?
Well,</v>

6
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:21.610
you should cause you never know.

7
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.140
You never know if there's going to be another February of 2018 nothing is

8
00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:27.190
promised.

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.730
Just remember to look up at the clouds today and smile.

10
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.783
<v 0>Okay,</v>

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.260
<v 1>sorry.
Um,</v>

12
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.110
I'm threatening to get on Instagram once again and I'm going to get on there and

13
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:45.090
I'm going to be come as someone who's in the public eye that inspires you.

14
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.770
So I just want to try out some of my inspiring words,
you know,

15
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.550
uh,
my,
my wife,
my laugh,
she's on Instagram and I always look at those things.

16
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:58.380
It always cracks me up.
People sit there,

17
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.100
they act like they're trying to inspire you and it's really just an excuse.

18
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:05.430
So they can take their shirt off and show you like how great a shape Darren.

19
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.080
<v 1>Always set goals beyond your own belief in yourself.</v>

21
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.470
Because even if you fall short,
you're still in the money round,

22
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.840
whatever the fire king of a finish up.
You know what I mean?

23
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.040
Then they're just sitting there with like fucking eight pack abs,
you know,

24
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.950
but like with a hat on,
like a fucking knitted hat,

25
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.090
it's like,
dude,
I thought your cold when you put a shirt on him.

26
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.330
All right.

27
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.010
He starts off being conti and it's only gonna get mocked country from there.

28
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.260
So I was out in,
um,

29
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.910
I was out in Santa Monica and I was coming back towards Hollywood,

30
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.510
you know,
to get my,
uh,
my botox injections.
Um,

31
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.960
a lot of people don't know that about myself that I am actually,
yeah,

32
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:56.730
I've lied to you all of these years.
I'm actually 63 years old and um,

33
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.230
I take a very high quality botox injection every,
uh,

34
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:06.090
every third day,
sorta like the patrones silver of like botox,

35
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.020
you know,
I don't know shit about to Keel.
I'm sure somebody is going to say,
oh,

36
00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:13.510
actually this Cleveland mid range to Qi Lu,
you move,

37
00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:18.480
would you move the Goodie?
No one cares.
No one cares about you.

38
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:21.640
And your fucking Tequila connoisseuring so anyways,

39
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:25.530
so I'm driving into Hollywood,
right?
Um,

40
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.220
and uh,
I stopped at a red light and there's all these,

41
00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:32.220
these pro second amendment people standing there,
right.

42
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.190
What's like megaphones and shit and they just keep you out on it.

43
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.710
<v 2>Oh,
whoa.</v>

44
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.123
<v 1>Right.</v>

45
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.020
Like literally some of the dumbest fucking people I've ever seen in my life.

46
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.080
Uh,
and that my friend is what always now,
now,

47
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.410
now if I was a moron,
which I am.
MMM.

48
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.760
I would look at those people would be like,
yes,

49
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.910
that's what people who defend the second amendment look like.

50
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Rather than being like now people who fucking are going to stand at a fucking

51
00:03:11.581 --> 00:03:13.110
red light with a bull horn,

52
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.700
there's a certain level of intellect that that's going to have.
And there it is.

53
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.133
You know what I mean?

54
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.620
It's kind of like when like the left goes out and they protest something.

55
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.740
Like remember that I always bring this shoe,
that checkup,

56
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.150
who fucking sat there when Trump was getting a sworn and she has good,

57
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.333
<v 3>yeah,</v>

58
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.370
<v 1>that fucking</v>

59
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.360
like what sort of balanced conversation could you have with a human being?

60
00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:49.780
Like that.
And it's just saying like these Blm,

61
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.410
I just,
it was fucking hilarious.

62
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.140
And then people were beeping at them.
Yeah.
I don't,

63
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.370
you can't tell when someone hits so horn,
whether it's they don't have like the,

64
00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:03.950
uh,
the positive beeping.
I guess that's like a peep.

65
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.720
You can't tell if they were beeping,
like,
yeah,
keep yelling that shit.

66
00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:12.680
That doesn't make any sense.
I don't understand America.
Love it or leave it.

67
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.510
So if you want to,
uh,
adjust anything,

68
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.530
then you need to get the fuck outta here.
Like,
it's just like,
I mean,

69
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.190
that's what the flyers did for the last fucking 40 years and that's why they

70
00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:29.330
have yet to win another cup because whatever they did,
the 74 and 75,

71
00:04:29.331 --> 00:04:33.530
they continued to fucking do up until about maybe six or seven seasons ago,

72
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.100
you know?
Oh,
we're just going to beat the shit out of people.
Right.

73
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.340
That worked in [inaudible] 74 and 75 before social media,

74
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.170
before millennials were even born.
You could do that.
All right.

75
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.180
And they didn't adjust and look at them now.
Couplets.

76
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.280
They won the Stanley Cup since Gerald Ford was an office.

77
00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:54.830
And that's fucking unbelievable,
right?
Actually it really isn't.

78
00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:58.130
When you look at it is there is 30 teams.

79
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.480
If you win one once every 30 years,
that's pretty much average.

80
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.360
So they're a little behind the little behind the curve.

81
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.190
They need to stay off the class,

82
00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:11.090
get a little extra help on how to cycle it around.

83
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.793
<v 3>MMM.</v>

84
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.790
<v 1>Yeah.
And I love how they did and they go,
those,</v>

85
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.400
these fucking morons are going to love it or leave it.

86
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.940
And what the defending was an amendment to the constitution,

87
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.710
which is a change.

88
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.180
<v 3>Okay.</v>

89
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.720
<v 1>Fucking unbelievable.
And the look on their face too,</v>

90
00:05:29.721 --> 00:05:32.330
when they were pissing people off because like these fucking morons,

91
00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:33.830
we're actually looking at him getting mad.

92
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.650
I actually rolled my window down because I want to call one of the guys fat.

93
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.170
I just looked at it like this is,
this is going to be,

94
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.720
how mad can I make this guy?
It's so childish.

95
00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:43.460
But that's how it kind of looked at it.
But,
um,

96
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.613
<v 3>yeah,</v>

97
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.860
<v 1>I,
they th the look on their faces of them just pissing people off.</v>

98
00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:52.080
They had total joy in their faces.
So it's just like,

99
00:05:52.081 --> 00:05:56.700
you're not making it any better.
You're actually making it worse.

100
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.920
I Dunno.
Why can't people just,
just sit down and just be like,
like,
you know,

101
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.030
the people are the defendant ar 15,

102
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.331
<v 4>look man,</v>

103
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:13.331
I fuck fucking spoon and shot myself in the Far East.

104
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.590
<v 1>And then the people on the left can be like,</v>

105
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.290
<v 5>excuse me,
a set up butterfly.</v>

106
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.680
We're just saying that maybe a shitty little about difficulty,
one of,

107
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.960
<v 1>um,
maybe that's what we need to do.
Maybe.</v>

108
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.480
Maybe that's a way that each side can hear each other,

109
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.350
each side performed as a stereotype,
you know,

110
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.180
or wait,
maybe you present your liberal opinion.

111
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

112
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:54.550
<v 1>And your,
your,
your viewpoint of what you think the right sounds like.
You know,</v>

113
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.580
<v 4>I real raise my daughter gender neutral.</v>

114
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.700
<v 1>Right.
And then they have to my neighbor a few,
they had to be like,</v>

115
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.930
<v 5>do fucking liberal snowflake.</v>

116
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.100
<v 1>Um,
anyways,
I've,
oh my God,
I've never gotten more goddamn responses.</v>

117
00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:19.680
So when you start bringing up fucking guns,
um,

118
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.620
just gotta be,
how can you do it?
Like,
you know,

119
00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:26.970
you gotta let these fucking people still have their machine guns so they can get

120
00:07:26.971 --> 00:07:29.850
out there and then four wheelers or you know,
who,
who knows,

121
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.720
who knows what's going to happen.
I am curious too,
as far as,
um,

122
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.450
uh,
well before I finished it,
how,

123
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.310
how do you figure out who's a fucking lunatic and who is it?

124
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:40.730
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

125
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.450
<v 1>You know what I mean?
Because I haven't done any research on this,</v>

126
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:48.830
but I would be willing to bet that at least 98% of registered gun owners are

127
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:50.570
fucking responsible.
You know,

128
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.830
they're out there shooting squirrels off their balconies.
Right?

129
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.700
What that gun you can you see at the end of Scarface?
So whatever the fuck it is,

130
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:02.570
I don't know.
It gives a shit.
That's all they're doing.
Jazz,
the fucking Squirrel,

131
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:06.840
man.
God Damn cute racks as far as I'm concerned.
Good eight.
No,
it's good.

132
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.300
And it's like a game of chicken for the little bit of a captain crunch in it.

133
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:16.370
Um,
it's gotta be a way to a dean off,

134
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.513
you know what I mean?

135
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.330
I don't think anybody who owns a gun thinks that some fucking lunatic should get

136
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.260
a gun like that.
So why don't we just work on,

137
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.513
<v 0>okay.</v>

138
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.270
<v 1>Uh,
we'll work on that.
How would you do,
how would you possibly fucking do that?</v>

139
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.063
I Dunno.

140
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

141
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.010
<v 1>I actually got into it with somebody,
you know,</v>

142
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.360
they were trying to tell me that silencers were legal in New York and I'm like,

143
00:08:42.361 --> 00:08:46.950
dude,
they're not.
He's like,
yes they are.
And I said,
dude,
I lived at,

144
00:08:46.951 --> 00:08:49.620
they're not,
and then he like,
immediately he goes,
they are,

145
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.150
you just have to register.

146
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.110
So then I Google it and it says that suppressors are legal in like some like 42

147
00:08:57.111 --> 00:09:00.440
different states.
And one of the states they weren't legal in was New York.

148
00:09:00.441 --> 00:09:03.020
And then the guy gets his rather than being like,
oh,
okay,
I'm wrong.

149
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.350
He gets like fucking mad.
And he goes,
well,
is that a new law?

150
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.810
It's like now,
I dunno.

151
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.560
I Dunno when it came from far as I know,
whenever I fucking live there,

152
00:09:14.561 --> 00:09:16.870
you can't have a silencer and fucking New York City.

153
00:09:16.871 --> 00:09:20.680
That basically means that I'm going to go assassinate.

154
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.480
It's not like we have a bunch of fucking coyotes and shit running around

155
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.020
alligators and that top shit because in Florida they would just like,

156
00:09:30.021 --> 00:09:32.600
well you know,
cause we shot guns with silences in Florida.

157
00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:35.600
They would just go and we were laughing at first.
He said,
yeah,

158
00:09:35.601 --> 00:09:38.810
having a salad suit in New York means I basically want to kill somebody and I

159
00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:41.990
don't want anybody to hear it.
And they laughed.
And down here they were like,

160
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.010
oh that just down here,

161
00:09:43.011 --> 00:09:45.620
that just means there's an alligator on your yard and you don't want to wake up

162
00:09:45.621 --> 00:09:50.330
your neighbor,
you know?
So it's like,
oh,
all right,
I get it.

163
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.770
Plus my ears a junk.
I think if I had a fucking gun,
I would,

164
00:09:53.771 --> 00:09:55.910
I wouldn't want to have a,
a suppressor,

165
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.373
<v 3>you know?</v>

166
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.670
<v 1>I mean,
that's gotta be,
it's gotta be the best.</v>

167
00:10:00.671 --> 00:10:02.260
If somebody breaks into your house,

168
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.000
all right and your gun is readily available and you have a suppressor on it,

169
00:10:07.001 --> 00:10:07.241
right?

170
00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:11.740
And you just fucking stand up and your jam jam scratching your ass and you just

171
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:19.180
clean that up in the morning.
He just go right back to bed,
you know,

172
00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:23.470
and you just lay in there,
you know,
you did something fucked up the night before.

173
00:10:23.471 --> 00:10:25.300
You're not,
you know how you wake up.
Well,

174
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.400
you don't just sort of gradually wake up.
You fucking eyes just come open.

175
00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:32.990
I just don't fucking shoots there.
I have to shoot somebody to watch that.
Ah,

176
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.460
God damn it.
The bloods all dry them a floor plan.

177
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.780
Um,
anyways,
I find the whole fucking thing fascinating.

178
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.940
I also find it fascinating that it,
you know,

179
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.900
as much as I'm a believer that you shouldn't,
uh,

180
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.790
the government shouldn't be the only one that has guns.

181
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.860
It's like too much powers considering what the fuck they're doing.
Uh,

182
00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.000
I also don't,
I think we're,
as far as technology goes in owner of media,

183
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.660
I just don't think that a bunch of people with like guns in their houses is

184
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:05.100
going to stop any sort of fucking,

185
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.270
<v 3>you know,
if we went,</v>

186
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.180
<v 1>I don't know how much crazy where could get in this country,</v>

187
00:11:11.181 --> 00:11:13.070
but if we really went totally fucking crazy,

188
00:11:13.071 --> 00:11:18.071
I really don't think a bunch of armed citizens who are not organized or even

189
00:11:19.791 --> 00:11:24.680
remotely have the training or the weaponry of what the,
you know,
the martial law,

190
00:11:24.681 --> 00:11:28.460
whatever the fuck would be enacted,
would it even be able to stop it?
You know?

191
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:33.560
And then the people that took over in power would also control the media and

192
00:11:33.561 --> 00:11:35.690
then they would,
they would,
um,

193
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.650
put out information to make those patriotic citizens look like they were fucking

194
00:11:41.651 --> 00:11:46.600
Nazis and the whole thing would fall apart.
Um,
however,

195
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.570
you know,
for a lot of people,
I think it would be a fun way to go out.

196
00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.660
You want my guns come and kill them going get them.

197
00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.520
Do you want my soul cycle?
Well,

198
00:11:59.521 --> 00:12:03.120
I'm going to put it up on craigslist next week.
Um,
all right,

199
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.490
let's get out of this fucking topic.
We'll talk about it later.

200
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.820
I'm trying to be even here,

201
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.730
like sort of trashing both sides and seeing both sides.

202
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:18.360
You know,
this is my Instagram inspirational thing on gun control.

203
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.010
I'm trying to see both sides of this.

204
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.020
In the end of this I will take my shirt off.

205
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.430
It's not even that people in the public.
I do that.

206
00:12:32.431 --> 00:12:34.230
It's the people that follow them.

207
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.960
I guess if they are inspiring them,
I guess they are doing something,

208
00:12:39.961 --> 00:12:43.110
but it is just so clearly,
it has nothing to do.

209
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.850
Even if they inspires somebody that's even more for that person that took their

210
00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:50.000
shirt off to fucking feed their ego.

211
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.093
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

212
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.300
<v 1>Um,
anyways,</v>

213
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.740
or maybe I just never looked good with my shirt off in shape.

214
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.770
Errata shape because I was so pasty white,
you know,

215
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.340
I felt bad for fucking,
there was,

216
00:13:03.341 --> 00:13:06.750
this is a fellow celebrity or red head and he had his shirt off on a boat and

217
00:13:06.751 --> 00:13:07.650
everyone was,
you know,

218
00:13:07.651 --> 00:13:10.740
and he's in great shape and that's all everybody talked about was how fucking

219
00:13:10.741 --> 00:13:12.390
Whitey was.
You know,

220
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.070
if redheads ever had a bodybuilding contest,
what it would,

221
00:13:17.071 --> 00:13:19.230
basically they would do it for the blind.

222
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.670
The blind would just come up like touching their torso and be like,
okay,

223
00:13:23.671 --> 00:13:27.240
you could be,
this could be a little more defined,
you know?

224
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.910
Then we'd sit there with her angry freckled fingers,
you know,

225
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.970
giving them the finger.
Maybe.
I have no idea.

226
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:38.280
All I know is that,
uh,
since I've become a dad,

227
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.990
I've,
I,
you know,
I don't have time to fucking watch games the way I used to,

228
00:13:42.991 --> 00:13:47.640
especially like hockey and basketball,
how,
how many games there are and all that.

229
00:13:47.641 --> 00:13:50.280
Every time I fucking start to get caught up on the Bruins,

230
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.120
I look at my little thing and it says,
you have five new games to watch.

231
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.930
And I know they're playing great and they're making all these moves.

232
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.900
I don't know if this trade went through,

233
00:14:00.901 --> 00:14:05.901
but we got fucking Rick Nash from the Rangers and I was thinking,

234
00:14:06.841 --> 00:14:07.410
Oh God,

235
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:12.410
like who the fuck did we give up for this guy?

236
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.620
And,
uh,
we gave up a first round draft pick.

237
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.860
Who the hell is it here?
And we gave up,
uh,

238
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.470
we gave up Ryan Spooner and Matt Volesky.

239
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.730
Uh,
I don't know.

240
00:14:29.731 --> 00:14:33.930
Rick Nash is 33.
I loved Ryan's phone.

241
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:38.700
Um,
ah,
well what are you going to do?
Where are you going to do it?
But I,
I'd say,

242
00:14:38.701 --> 00:14:41.720
Oh,
who knows?
I like what Sweeney's don't,
he's just like,
all right,
fuck it.
We're,

243
00:14:41.721 --> 00:14:44.820
we're like right there.
Let's push this over the top.

244
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.610
It gives us a physical presence.
A guy that gives you 30 calls to say,

245
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.030
should I take the approach,
Jeff?
We got better.
They're going to put them on the

246
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:56.390
<v 6>second line with David Cray.
Gee,
now you got Bershee Rod.
Yeah.</v>

247
00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.420
You got Pasternak,
Eh,
you got,
you got,

248
00:15:01.421 --> 00:15:03.340
you got Marshawn and the first slide,

249
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:05.370
<v 0>okay.</v>

250
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.740
<v 1>That gives us two really solid lines</v>

251
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.990
and I haven't watched that many games issues,

252
00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.640
but the game at games I'd been watching,

253
00:15:12.641 --> 00:15:16.840
our fourth line actually kinda contributes quite a bit.
Um,
we're young,

254
00:15:16.841 --> 00:15:20.170
we're fast now.
We got this guy and he's a,
he's a big presence out there.

255
00:15:20.171 --> 00:15:21.460
He doesn't really drop the gloves,

256
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.030
but I mean that's combined completely taken out of the game.
By the way,

257
00:15:25.031 --> 00:15:28.990
people who always talk about how much they love Olympic hockey and if they could

258
00:15:28.991 --> 00:15:32.770
just get the fighting of the NHL that they would actually sit down and watch it.

259
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.200
While all I want to say is fuck you,

260
00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:39.490
you lie and cons because you ruined the game that I loved because they've pretty

261
00:15:39.491 --> 00:15:41.230
much got fighting out of the game.

262
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.660
Certainly in the playoffs you get in the playoffs,
the goons are gone,

263
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.290
the goons go home,
all the goes go home at night,

264
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.270
the goats go home at night,

265
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:57.300
they go home and during the fucking playoffs plas you send them all home.

266
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.710
And every year I get a little sad.
You know when I see that,

267
00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:05.520
and I think back to the eighties when the fucking Bruins played the,

268
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:10.740
the fucking buffalo Sabres and it was standing room only in the penalty box.

269
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.250
It's like two guys sitting down.

270
00:16:15.251 --> 00:16:19.600
Three people standing up behind them look like they were stuck in an elevator

271
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.830
back then.
That was called setting the tone.

272
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.250
That's not what happens anymore.
Is it

273
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.800
all these people out there trying to take away my guns and my four whalers,

274
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.030
sorry.
Oh,

275
00:16:35.031 --> 00:16:39.260
he's people out there trying to take my gun and my four wheeler.

276
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.970
You fucking liberal snowflake.
I don't,

277
00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:47.270
you just skip to some socialist country.

278
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.410
Well,
we have a teddy sharpie.
There is no room for violence seeing hockey.

279
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.950
It just shows ignorance.
Um,

280
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.390
okay.
That's what I'm gonna do from here on out.

281
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.060
Whenever I present the liberal side,
I'm going to try to do,

282
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.180
I'm going to do a fucking,
I need another good liberal argument.

283
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.673
You know what I mean?

284
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.830
I don't know why the fuck we just don't switch over to solar power.

285
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.710
All these stupid fucking rednecks role in Cole.

286
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.170
I should have solar power.

287
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.070
So he's fucking oil companies and corporations.
They don't want to do it.

288
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.690
Um,

289
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.570

Going well,
I guess that's it for us.

294
00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.730
I guess.
We can't kill any bought people.
They're not,

295
00:18:01.731 --> 00:18:06.470
they're hitting the gym that drinking that shit up and they get an even stronger

296
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.700
and there's,

297
00:18:10.701 --> 00:18:13.340

303
00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:38.480
I'm just saying some adjustments maybe need to be made.
You know,

304
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.550
I don't remember.

who's the guy who said the British should come or Paul Revere?

306
00:18:44.331 --> 00:18:46.670
I don't remember his kid going into a log cabin,
you know,

307
00:18:46.671 --> 00:18:50.720
shooting it up with a musket.
All right.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.960

create a super bug.

317
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.470
Hand sanitizer.
Dispensers are mounted everywhere in office buildings,

318
00:19:35.471 --> 00:19:39.580
restaurants,
schools,
and hospitals.
In case you didn't know what everywhere meant,

319
00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:44.920
we can carry bottles of it and our purses and on our key chains there,

320
00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.970
we'd covered male and female behavior,
but we,

321
00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.890
but are we using it correctly?

322
00:19:50.891 --> 00:19:55.891
And Kenny use be used to make a super bug bug bug USA Today,

323
00:19:56.321 --> 00:20:00.100
network reviews,
facts and fiction surrounding hand sanitizer

324
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:05.730
myths.
Kids who suck their thumbs shouldn't use hand sanitizer.

325
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.550
It's generally okay to apply hand sanitizer on a child.

326
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.270
Oh cheese that just covered themselves legally.
Generally it's okay.

327
00:20:14.271 --> 00:20:15.470
My kid just died.
Well,

328
00:20:15.471 --> 00:20:19.610
we didn't say totally a taste.

329
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.030
A taste amount from the hand.

330
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.730
There's not usually a problem.
Nicole,

331
00:20:27.731 --> 00:20:32.731
we'd a registered nurse and a certified specialist in poison information told

332
00:20:33.011 --> 00:20:36.460
USA Today network
at most.

333
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.090
There may be some irritation in the mouth from the alcohol based products.

334
00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:45.200
Do keep an eye on kids though.
Fuck you.
Goddamn advertising.

335
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.810
There we go.
Um,

336
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:51.480
hand sanitizers often smells good and comes in bright colored packages that's

337
00:20:51.481 --> 00:20:52.500
attractive to children.

338
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.220
Ingesting a large amount of but could make them very sick she said,

339
00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:01.500
or shit faced depending on what brand you use.
Myth sort of myth,

340
00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:06.150
sort of using hand sanitizer can use the create can lead to the creation of

341
00:21:06.151 --> 00:21:08.490
super bugs.
The concern about Sukkot,

342
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:12.630
superbugs centers around a chemical ingredient found in many antibacterial

343
00:21:12.631 --> 00:21:17.150
products called try.
CEO said try a sale.

344
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.150
Sad is not found in most hand sanitizers,

345
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.370
but it is found in many antibacteria hand soaps and cleaners.

346
00:21:23.371 --> 00:21:27.690
Recent studies have found that the chemical may alter the way hormones work in

347
00:21:27.691 --> 00:21:31.200
the body.
According to federal drug admin.
The FDA.
All right.

348
00:21:31.201 --> 00:21:35.620
And may also contribute to bacterial resistance to antibiotics or superbugs.

349
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:41.340
Should I say [inaudible] is not considered an essential agree for many products

350
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:45.780
and its use is currently under review by the FDA and the environmental

351
00:21:45.781 --> 00:21:46.800
protection agency.

352
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.850
The FDA is also made up of a bunch of people that used to work in the industries

353
00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:53.370
that they're supposed to be policing.
So who knows.

354
00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:02.160
All right,
this this morning I am a moron because there's a bunch of other facts.

355
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.810
I don't even know what the facts,
I just get bored.
But listen,

356
00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:09.890
this is why I don't read a lot of Shit because I'm reading this on USA Today and

357
00:22:10.141 --> 00:22:12.180
then USA today just has a bunch of

358
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:19.620
like clickbait
like underneath.

359
00:22:19.621 --> 00:22:23.640
Remember Catherine Bell from Jag?
See where she is now.

360
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.130
Google may not show you this.
Enter any name.

361
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.560
This is on the USA does today site.

362
00:22:31.561 --> 00:22:34.020
This is supposed to be like a fucking reputable newspaper.

363
00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:42.160
Top five local solar companies.
Check out best and worst reviews.

364

Plowing ahead.
You okay?
You want.

366
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.290
The greatest thing about my daughter is right now,

367
00:22:52.291 --> 00:22:56.460
besides everything is she gives hugs now,
like legit hugs,

368
00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.970
right?
Like I opened the door to a room today.

369
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.660
She was in there talking to herself,
open the door to room shifts,
goes hi.

370
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:08.640
So I start cracking up.
I'm like hi.
And I walk over to pick her up.

371
00:23:08.641 --> 00:23:13.470
I pick her up,
she grabs like around my neck and behind my neck.

372
00:23:13.471 --> 00:23:17.280
She grabs like a handful of my shirt,
like I owe her money,

373
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.020
you know?

374
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.240
And then the other hand it's just sorta on my shoulder and she pulls herself in

375
00:23:23.241 --> 00:23:27.860
to meet with their head right up against my head and I'm standing like,
yeah,

376
00:23:27.861 --> 00:23:31.110
you kidding me.
This is the greatest thing ever.

377
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.430
And then after like just squeezing me for like a good five's,

378
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.490
the best five seconds of my life,

379
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.150
she then lets up and then gave me a kiss and then went and hugged me again.

380
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:48.490
It was so awesome.
Literally reenacted it to my laugh.
I was like,

381
00:23:48.491 --> 00:23:49.690
this is what she did this morning.

382
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:55.660
The best part is the handful of this shirt or maybe the feeling of this decided

383
00:23:55.661 --> 00:23:56.950
that face on yours.
I don't know what,

384
00:23:56.951 --> 00:23:59.620
but all I can tell you this the greatest thing ever.
It's becoming a dad.

385
00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:05.170
It's awesome.
You know,
I know there's the lack of sleep.
I know you.

386
00:24:05.171 --> 00:24:09.050
Sex life goes out the fucking window,
but it's worth it.

387
00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.050
It's totally fucking worth it.
Um,
all right.

388
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.020
Oh Geez.
Here we go.
We got,

389
00:24:17.021 --> 00:24:21.460
we have one read one race in the barren landscape.

390
00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:26.950

392
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.293

394
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.910
it just did not work.
Oh,
it was inefficient way.

395
00:24:42.911 --> 00:24:44.860
Or the other day I was at a red light.

396
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.690
I saw about faith or sat around megaphones.
I was like,
Whoa,

397
00:24:48.691 --> 00:24:53.540
there you got to say it.
I'm like,
hello related.
And I was like,
oh my God,

398
00:24:53.541 --> 00:24:56.180
what dumb luck.
I just thought a bunch of talented people,

399
00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:02.420
but I had to get in my car to do it.
I had to get him a truck to go do it.

400
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:07.380
A four door truck

Every outdoor recess,

422

424

430
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.190
take some x rays,
checkout my heart.

431
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.990
I'm doing all of that shit right after a half a fucking century or running

432
00:27:15.991 --> 00:27:19.170
around eating fucking burgers and Bologna sandwiches and shit.

433
00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:23.310
I'm going to see how much damage I've done to myself and uh,

434
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.130
hopefully they won't find anything and if they do,

435
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:30.210
hopefully they can fix it and dead out.
That'll be good.

436
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:35.160
I'll get a little,
uh,
you know,
get a little fresh and up here,
you know.

437
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.710
Got My teeth all straightened out here.
Ready to read the fucking nose.

438
00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:42.880
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

439
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:47.020
<v 1>Telling you right now,
Connie Chung has nothing on me that she had nice teeth.</v>

440
00:27:47.021 --> 00:27:51.670
I don't fucking remember.
Um,
anyways.
Yeah.

441
00:27:51.671 --> 00:27:56.000
So I'm going to go in there.
I'm going to get my heart.
Liver.
Oh,
Jesus.
Stomach,

442
00:27:56.001 --> 00:28:00.410
pancreas,
the whole God damn thing.
Kidneys,
the whole fucking thing.

443
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:04.850
Right?
Hey,
what was that movie?
That guy we said,
well,

444
00:28:04.851 --> 00:28:07.430
they flew this space ship around inside the person's body.

445
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:09.963
<v 3>MMM.</v>

446
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.350
<v 1>The fuck was that called?
Come on,
ed.</v>

447
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.480
You're just not.

448
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:17.243
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

449
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:23.250
<v 1>All right.
All right.
I'm gonna get my ears checked out too.
What is,
hey mia,</v>

450
00:28:23.251 --> 00:28:26.300
what's the name of that movie that,
that Dennis Quaid was in?

451
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.180
Where do you keep was flying around inside somebody's body.

452
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:35.490
Inner space.
Yeah.
I got to get that fucking procedure.

453
00:28:35.491 --> 00:28:37.830
You know when you turned 50,
now they got to do that,
right?

454
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.970
They got to do the fucking imax up your ass.
Camera up your ass.
Inner space.

455
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:52.050
I have to do all of that shit.
It fucking,
you know,
how did this happen?

456
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:58.230
I used to be a young man,
but whatever.
I'm going to go fucking do it because,

457
00:28:58.231 --> 00:29:01.890
uh,
because I get the little kid,
if I didn't have the kid,
you know,
I,

458
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.520
I think I just sort of drink myself to death,
you know,

459
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.870
you know what I would love to do if I didn't have any responsibilities when I

460
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:13.860
was seeing those people staying in there doing that America love it or leave it.

461
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:17.130
I wish it just had a lunch here and I could've just sat under a tree across the

462
00:29:17.131 --> 00:29:21.930
street,
you know,
with a nice fucking adult beverage,
you know,

463
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:28.360
and I have to have a mixture though,
right case the cops came by officer,

464
00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:29.650
I'm just drinking lemonade.

465
00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.890
It's gluten free and just sit there watching the most part of me that actually

466
00:29:35.891 --> 00:29:37.540
enjoyed watching them come down.
Like,
Hey,

467
00:29:37.541 --> 00:29:42.340
let's go down there and piss off a bunch of liberals and they come down and um,

468
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.910
I just don't think that they made the problem better.

469
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.680
They didn't make anybody on the left and want to listen to what the fuck they

470
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:51.880
had to say,
but they were morons.
And I don't think it,
everybody on the right,

471
00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:56.080
it's like that.
And I don't think everybody on the left is a fucking lunatic.

472
00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:58.570
One of them here.

473
00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:02.550
You leg it takes over the trying to fucking change everything that we hold dad.

474
00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:07.090
Um,
who knows when they'll fuck no,
sorry,

475
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.750
we're a half hour in here.
I get a bunch of bull shit to do today.

476
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.880
Um,
dude,

477
00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:17.860
my drum room is done and I can't even fucking tell you.
Well,

478
00:30:17.861 --> 00:30:18.481
I'm going to tell her,

479
00:30:18.481 --> 00:30:22.150
I'm going to try to tell you about how fucking awesome it is the first time in

480
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:22.660
my life.

481
00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:27.660
I can play drums as loud as I want and not piss anybody off.

482
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.790
Okay?
If you liked me,
okay.
If it's just a hobby,
any,

483
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:34.300
and every time you go to place,

484
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.580
somebody tells you to shut the fuck up and you always think,

485
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.230
why didn't I just play the Ukulele?
Why did I have to pick this instrument?

486
00:30:41.231 --> 00:30:44.750
I'm going to tell you right now,
you need to,
you need to get a drum room.

487
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:46.270
I don't give a fuck how you do it,

488
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.123
<v 0>okay?</v>

489
00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:51.190
<v 1>You know,
I was actually thinking,
you know,
if,
if this thing didn't work,</v>

490
00:30:51.191 --> 00:30:52.090
what I was going to do,

491
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:56.350
I was just going to pay somebody to literally dig a fucking hole in the ground

492
00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:59.050
like a bomb shelter,
all right?

493
00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:03.490
And just stick the whole fucking thing under the ground,
right?

494
00:31:03.491 --> 00:31:05.410
Put some cinder blocks,
make a little room,

495
00:31:05.411 --> 00:31:09.070
and you'd literally have to go down a ladder into the fucking thing.

496
00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:11.560
And then of course I don't stop there.
I'm like,

497
00:31:11.561 --> 00:31:14.740
well what if I had a tunnel going from the fucking house like Al Capone?

498
00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:19.120
And I could just walk in like that.
You have it underneath,
you know,

499
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.260
the tax man can't see it,
so he can't tax your forte,
you know?

500
00:31:23.261 --> 00:31:27.550
And then this is saying someday you sell a house and you don't tell anybody that

501
00:31:27.551 --> 00:31:28.384
it's there.

502
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.350
Then one day somebody discovers it and then they're filming it and they're all

503
00:31:35.351 --> 00:31:38.260
fucking excited to see all what it's going to be down there as they going to be

504
00:31:38.261 --> 00:31:40.090
as safe as it can be.
A dead body.

505
00:31:40.091 --> 00:31:43.370
Is there going to be a terror Adacta leg from prehistoric times?

506
00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:48.990
Yeah.
They go down there and it's just some big stupid drum room,
right.

507
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.010
Pictures of Fred Curry and Ricky rocket,
Tommy Lee,

508
00:31:56.070 --> 00:32:00.780
Nicko,
mcbrain,
all these people that I grew up watching,
Phil Rudd,

509
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.910
I lead the posters.
I don't have posters of any of those people.
Um,
all right,

510
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.640
let's do a,
and I've actually,
because of,
because of my shoulder,

511
00:32:10.641 --> 00:32:11.660
which I'm telling you man,

512
00:32:11.661 --> 00:32:15.590
I got it up to about 85% here and I just can't fuck it up by wailing on the

513
00:32:15.591 --> 00:32:19.700
drums.
I've just been working on my feet and,
uh,

514
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.000
just the fucking bands and I'm getting into,

515
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.210
because I'm just been listened to a lot of double bass now.
And,
uh,

516
00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:30.680
my younger brothers were always into like Pantera and shit and I was just like,

517
00:32:30.681 --> 00:32:34.160
that's too heavy for me.
Um,

518
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:36.160
<v 0>yeah,</v>

519
00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.250
<v 1>I,
I can't believe I didn't get,
I couldn't,
you know,</v>

520
00:32:38.251 --> 00:32:43.130
I was old enough I could saw that band and I didn't.
Uh,
but I've,

521
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.770
she's gone fucking got like everything that they have doubt.

522
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.460
And I always knew Vinnie Paul was a fucking great Dharma,
but Jesus Christ,

523
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:57.980
just incredible,
incredible fucking drummer and a cowboys from hell.

524
00:32:57.981 --> 00:33:01.400
And I'm broken.
Uh,
probably my two favorites.
And,
uh,
somebody,

525
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.340
my drum teacher told me about their live album,

526
00:33:04.341 --> 00:33:09.341
that 101 proof and just how they end up broken with that little double bass

527
00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:12.800
fucking riff there in the end.
It's just like,

528
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:17.620
I wanted to learn how to fucking learn how to fucking do that and I'm going to

529
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:21.440
do that in my drum room
and,
uh,
that's it.

530
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.950
That's what the fuck I've been doing.
I've been doing that and working on the,
uh,

531
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:30.960
that much sugar bleed song.
That's what I do.

532
00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:34.830
I want to start double bass with the probably the most difficult double bass

533
00:33:34.831 --> 00:33:36.450
song you could possibly have.

534
00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.990
I'm up to about a 70 BPM,

535
00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:46.860
being able to play that lick,
uh,
with playing eighth notes,
like,

536
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.160
like that.
Um,
it's not going that fast.
It's more like they did the digital,

537
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:58.710
digital.
Um,

538
00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.800
and that's what I do.
Okay.
Now that you've,

539
00:34:02.801 --> 00:34:06.870
you learned how fucking boring my actual life is other than when my kid gives me

540
00:34:06.871 --> 00:34:07.880
a hug in the morning.
All right.

541
00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.460
34 fucking minutes and let's see if I could fucking bullshit for another 26

542
00:34:11.461 --> 00:34:14.670
minutes here.
Oh,
by the way,
uh,
they added a show.

543
00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:19.320
There's the third show that I'm trying to sell up there in Vancouver.
Um,

544
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:24.000
I'm going to be up there on March 7th and March 8th,

545
00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:29.370
which is going to be a,
it's going to be so much fucking fun.
I can't wait.
And I,

546
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:34.290
I,
I'm like chomping at the bit to start my road gigs,
first of all.

547
00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:38.790
Uh,
you know,
I haven't worked that much this year so far.
And,
um,

548
00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:44.470
do you know the bills keep coming in,
if you know what I mean?
You know,

549
00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:48.880
the wife keeps spending money,
the kid needs something.
Everybody's fucking,

550
00:34:48.881 --> 00:34:51.250
you know,
here's this fee for this.

551
00:34:51.251 --> 00:34:55.510
Here's this fee for fucking that this is a processing fee and all that next

552
00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.900
scene,
they just deplete your fucking five.

553
00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.820
I have no fucking idea how anybody ever retires.

554
00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:02.123
<v 0>Okay?</v>

555
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.910
<v 1>But I understand why when you do you eat fucking dog food.</v>

556
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.720
Just trying to stretch every God damn nickel you can't go.

557
00:35:09.721 --> 00:35:12.480
And how long am I going to live?
How long do I have to stretch this out?

558
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.430
All right,
sheriff dip shit.
This is what says,
this is what somebody wrote in.

559
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:21.150
Okay.
Now that I've,
I've brought up,
you know,

560
00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.100
talking about guns and that type of thing,

561
00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:28.130
trying to keep everybody calm and relaxed and have a nice conversation or we can

562
00:35:31.021 --> 00:35:36.021
somehow try to find a solution because God knows if smart people couldn't come

563
00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:37.950
up a solution,

564
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:43.940
I think it's time for someone of my intellect with the podcast laying here

565
00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:48.810
talking to nobody to come up with a solution.
Um,

566
00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.530
it's just like when a celebrity says that they're going to run for president,

567
00:35:52.531 --> 00:35:56.790
what I'm doing here,
this is what happens.
All right,
sheriff,
dip shit.
Bill.

568
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:01.200
I'll tell you who's a fuckup.
The sharer from that town,

569
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.140
you got to see this guy doing interviews.

570
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:07.680
I love how this person writes the sheriff from that town.
Like what town?

571
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.060
You just literally you,

572
00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:14.550
you fucking had half the conversation already in your head.

573
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:18.930
Bail up.
Tell you who's a fuck up the sheriff from their fucking tap.

574
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:20.340
<v 3>Okay.</v>

575
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.030
<v 1>You gotta see this guy doing interviews?
He talks,
oh my God,</v>

576
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:28.800
he talks like a long island Jew who runs a deli.
Yeah.
Boy.

577
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.390
How dumb is this person is a great way to make a point.
Say something.

578
00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:35.880
Antisemetic um,

579
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:38.830
right out of the gate that'll make people listen to,

580
00:36:38.831 --> 00:36:42.940
he went on CNN is started calling for gun control to take away attention from

581
00:36:42.941 --> 00:36:47.230
the fact that he had deputies push out and not engage the shooter.

582
00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:52.160
Um,
all right,
I did read that there was stuff like that.

583
00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.990
There was allegedly stuff like that going on and let me guess buddy.

584
00:36:55.991 --> 00:37:00.130
You would have ran right in there,
right?
With your fucking nine millimeter,

585
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.150
would you?
Would you,

586
00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.900
would you fucking pull a nine millimeter on a guy who had a fucking ar 15?

587
00:37:04.901 --> 00:37:07.210
Would you fucking do,
I'm just asking you that.

588
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.393
<v 3>Uh Huh.</v>

589
00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.690
<v 1>And if you would that,
what do you need?
An Ar 15 four.</v>

590
00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.720
You're evidently not afraid.
Um,

591
00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:19.450
there's a lot of people that fucking freeze up and you never know what you're

592
00:37:19.451 --> 00:37:21.970
going to do in that time.
All of a sudden you start thinking of your kid.

593
00:37:21.971 --> 00:37:24.160
Who knows?
It's very easy to sit there and be like,
well,

594
00:37:24.161 --> 00:37:26.260
these fucking people who fucking good,
good,
good.
You know,

595
00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:31.780
you know what I would've done?
Uh,
they did the same thing.

596
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.610
A cop who shoots an innocent black guy did in the sense that they were not ready

597
00:37:36.611 --> 00:37:37.630
for the job.

598
00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:42.010
They had the uniform and an idea that they were someone who could handle this.

599
00:37:42.011 --> 00:37:44.500
They weren't too.
This is all a legend.

600
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.850
<v 3>Okay?</v>

601
00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:49.870
<v 1>The Sheriff Office and the Shitty FBI fucking blew it when it came to all the</v>

602
00:37:49.871 --> 00:37:54.190
warnings.
I've read that too.
I don't believe in taking every gun,

603
00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:58.780
but how about not letting a delinquent kid by a fucking semiautomatic rifle

604
00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.020
along with some stricter shit in place.

605
00:38:02.021 --> 00:38:05.740
We need people who can do their fucking job.
You know,

606
00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:10.240
if you take away the antisemitism,
um,
in that

607
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.110
I actually agree with most of that.
Yeah.
Like if,

608
00:38:14.111 --> 00:38:16.330
if everything that they're saying is true,
that the people,

609
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:19.990
people like literally said this kid is threatening to shoot up a school,

610
00:38:19.991 --> 00:38:24.340
he's taking pictures of themselves with guns on,

611
00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.000
um,
and so I just can't believe yet another kid did that.

612
00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.780
There was all these warning signs and people were still allegedly ignoring it.

613
00:38:31.781 --> 00:38:35.870
If that is the case.
Um,
you know what I mean?

614
00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.810
Is it cause it's guns?
I don't know what it is.

615
00:38:38.811 --> 00:38:41.300
If somebody was on Instagram going,
you know,

616
00:38:41.301 --> 00:38:43.010
I'm going to take my deck out at school.

617
00:38:43.011 --> 00:38:46.340
They was standing there with told in their fucking Dick shaking it.
Right.

618
00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.320
I mean,
how fucking long would you last year will be over

619
00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:57.830
the fucking over when it mean,
what are these people have to do in a way?

620
00:38:57.831 --> 00:39:02.660
Isn't that like a cry for help.
Um,
all right.
Guns are fun.

621
00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:05.930
Exclamation point.
My dare is Mr. Byrd.

622
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:10.370
I grew up in rural Washington state with guns in the house and went to school

623
00:39:10.371 --> 00:39:14.690
with kids who had gun racks in their trucks and went hunting after school.

624
00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:19.100
It sounds like the beginning of red,
dawn.
As an adult.
I never owned a gun.

625
00:39:19.101 --> 00:39:22.430
Since I don't hunt and I live in a city with policemen,
it's away.

626
00:39:22.431 --> 00:39:25.040
So I feel like I can see both sides of the issue now.

627
00:39:25.041 --> 00:39:29.600
There's a great fucking point with police minutes away,

628
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:33.860
provided your white there are minutes away and they will help you provide at

629
00:39:33.861 --> 00:39:37.030
your way.
Um,
I'm,
I'm fucking around

630
00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:37.923
<v 7>before we</v>

631
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.660
<v 1>shut the fuck up.
I'm allowed to make jokes here.
Um,</v>

632
00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:45.780
yeah,
I get that.

633
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:51.150
I get that because that is the feeling I always understood owning a gun whenever

634
00:39:51.151 --> 00:39:54.480
I did like college gigs and road gigs that were in the middle of nowhere.

635
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:59.000
Like you just drive by some little farmhouse,

636
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.540
some little fucking house in the middle of nowhere and you're just like this.

637
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:05.580
What is to stop anybody from just driving up that driveway,

638
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.830
no matter how loud you scream for help,
no one was going to hear it all right.

639
00:40:10.831 --> 00:40:13.620
Anyways,
he says anyway,
the guy goes.
That being said,

640
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.150
I don't think the system of rules we have now is working and I think we could do

641
00:40:18.151 --> 00:40:20.460
better now.
I don't think anybody can argue that

642
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.960
whatever system we have is not working.

643
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:28.350
And because I'm saying it's not working doesn't mean I'm saying that they now

644
00:40:28.351 --> 00:40:32.490
have to fucking outlawed certain guns of whatever.
I'm just saying that,
you know,

645
00:40:32.491 --> 00:40:37.290
if somebody is literally saying I'm going to shoot up a fucking school or making

646
00:40:37.291 --> 00:40:40.830
threats like that while with taking pictures of themselves with guns and then

647
00:40:40.831 --> 00:40:45.210
people bring that to the authorities allegedly and nothing was done,

648
00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:50.490
uh,
yet this something not working.
All right.
My ideas are as follows.

649
00:40:50.491 --> 00:40:54.930
One people who want to hunt can have bolt,
bolt action,

650
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:58.860
a hunting rifle.
One shot,
one kill by by Bambi.

651
00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.100
Mommy wants some venison steaks.
All right.

652
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.210
You went a lot there with the reference.
Uh,
two references there.

653
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.490
Why Bambi?
You know,
why wouldn't you shoot the mother?
So then Bambi has no mom.

654
00:41:11.491 --> 00:41:14.230
Isn't that how it's supposed to?
That's the way Disney did it.
Oh,

655
00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.820
let's fuck fucking Hollywood liberal.
All right.

656
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:21.780
People who want to protect their homes can have shotguns for the spread,

657
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.660
obviously.
Well,
the one thing about the spread is like,

658
00:41:24.661 --> 00:41:29.250
what if they've already grabbed your fucking kid?
You know?

659
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:35.240
I Dunno.
That's a tough fucking thing too.

660
00:41:35.241 --> 00:41:37.070
Like you to shoot a gun in your house.

661
00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:39.740
You want enough fire power to kill somebody,

662
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:43.190
but you don't want it to go through them through a wall and then does somebody

663
00:41:43.191 --> 00:41:46.490
else that you actually like or maybe tolerating.
You know,

664
00:41:46.491 --> 00:41:49.950
if you have inlaws live in with you right into the other room and then you got

665
00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.580
to deal with that for the rest of your life.
Shod.
My mother in law,

666
00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:57.750
I didn't know she's on the other five shot the fucking,

667
00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:02.780
I'll tell you know something.
Your whole fucking family crazy.

668
00:42:02.781 --> 00:42:07.280
I Dunno why Hawaii.
I ever married into these people.

669
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.560
I should have known it,
man.

670
00:42:09.561 --> 00:42:14.360
You're fucking whole family had one pair of fucking shoes.
All right,

671
00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:18.340
number three.
Um,
alright.

672
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:19.970
Pistols only for cops,

673
00:42:19.971 --> 00:42:23.510
security guards or other people who have a credible reason that involves the

674
00:42:23.511 --> 00:42:28.100
need to occasionally shoot someone.
I think that's how they do it in Australia.

675
00:42:28.101 --> 00:42:31.820
Not sure too lazy to confirm.
All right.

676
00:42:31.821 --> 00:42:36.500
I like the honesty of that.
Uh,
this all makes sense,
but it's also like,

677
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.130
uh,
what about bad people

678
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.120
who don't give a shit about loss?
And then everybody turns in there,
I don't know.

679
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.730
And you live in the middle of nowhere and you turn in your fucking gun and then

680
00:42:49.731 --> 00:42:54.170
the Douche bag or wants to rob you doesn't then one.
All right.
Number three,

681
00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:59.171
people who want to have fun and blow shit up can own whatever the fuck they

682
00:42:59.361 --> 00:43:00.050
want,

683
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:05.050
but it has to be delivered and kept at a licensed gun range and all times,

684
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:11.180
uh,
gun rages could become the new golf course.

685
00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:16.490
It's guys get some interesting ideas that show up with your buddies or the

686
00:43:16.491 --> 00:43:19.730
ladies ran a fucking machine gun and have a blast.

687
00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:23.960
Shoot up a bunch of paper targets dummies that look like monsters or even shoot

688
00:43:23.961 --> 00:43:27.200
up some burned out cars.
It doesn't matter you having fun,

689
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.800
safety and responsibility in a controlled environment.
Just some ideas.

690
00:43:30.801 --> 00:43:35.150
Nothing too crazy.
I hope.
Go Fuck yourself safely and responsibly.
Of course.

691
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:37.700
Uh,
I like a lot of that.
The,
the flying,

692
00:43:37.701 --> 00:43:40.940
the fucking ointment in all of this is people that aren't going to comply with

693
00:43:40.941 --> 00:43:41.774
it.

694
00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:46.290
<v 3>Um,
you know,</v>

695
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.660
<v 1>and then everybody is going to turn in their fucking guns and comply with all of</v>

696
00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:52.580
that except for a

697
00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:55.930
my criminals or whatever.

698
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:59.020
But then it doesn't say anything that you can have a sword.

699
00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.220
What did she booby trap you house.
I don't know.
What are the,

700
00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.860
what are the odds that someone's going to come into your house?

701
00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.600
I have no idea.
I don't fucking know.
I'm,
I'm,

702
00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:12.520
I kind of believe that now that they're out there,

703
00:44:12.521 --> 00:44:17.280
I don't know how you fucking bring it back.
All this is doing,
it's just,

704
00:44:17.281 --> 00:44:17.821
you know what it is.

705
00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:22.821
Cause there's always like the what if and all of that because if we did have it

706
00:44:23.861 --> 00:44:28.390
like that,
like you know,
you go to England,
the cops don't even have guns.

707
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.010
You just come up and they swarm around you and

708
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.870
<v 0>they just sorta Columbia.
But the,</v>

709
00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:36.180
the people walking around don't really have guns

710
00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:42.390
<v 1>as far as I know.
I don't know.
Isn't it funny that I,</v>

711
00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.010
I just don't look anything up and I just start talking.

712
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:48.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

713
00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:49.620
<v 1>Gun violence.</v>

714
00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:50.960
<v 0>Okay.</v>

715
00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.410
<v 1>In England,
let's see what this brings up.</v>

716
00:44:55.130 --> 00:45:00.130
Gun Crime in London increases by 42% gun violence rare and UK compared to the u

717
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:04.640
s well,
it's because we're the best at everything.

718
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:15.140
If London was better at get fucking England was better at gun violence,

719
00:45:15.141 --> 00:45:18.230
we'd still be under their fucking rule,
right?
All right.

720
00:45:18.231 --> 00:45:23.231
Gun Crime in London increases by 42% this is a BBC news.

721
00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.660
Oh wait.
They get,
you know,
something because of terrorism.

722
00:45:26.661 --> 00:45:27.740
Now they have all the good,

723
00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.400
the met police said there was complex social reasons why more young people are

724
00:45:31.401 --> 00:45:34.310
carrying knives.
All right.

725
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:38.660
We went from Gunster knife gun crimes in London surge by 42% in the last year.

726
00:45:38.661 --> 00:45:41.810
According to official statistics,
the met police,

727
00:45:41.811 --> 00:45:46.811
his figures shows that there were 2,544 gun crime offenses from April 26 2016 to

728
00:45:48.741 --> 00:45:49.940
April,

729
00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:54.940
2017 compared to 1,793 offenses from 2015 until 2016.

730
00:45:56.150 --> 00:46:00.080
All right.
So I mean,
essentially a,
you know,
that's Kinda like fucking,

731
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.300
what would that be?

732
00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.380
<v 0>Okay.</v>

733
00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.330
<v 1>That's about six incidents a day.</v>

734
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

735
00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.810
<v 1>No less than that.
Five,
four and a half.</v>

736
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:12.210
That's pretty good for a whole city though,
right?

737
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:17.840
Knife crime also increased by 24% with 12,074 recorded offenses from 2016 2017

738
00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:21.870
the med said all low crime rates were rising.

739
00:46:21.871 --> 00:46:26.160
They remained at a much lower level level then five years ago.
Scotland.

740
00:46:26.161 --> 00:46:30.660
Yeah.
Registered annual rises across a number of series,

741
00:46:30.661 --> 00:46:35.530
offensive category,
offense,
offense categories in the past 12 months,
blah,

742
00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.720
blah,
blah,
blah.

743
00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.660
Uh,
okay.
All right.
I don't know what I just learned there.
I have no idea.

744
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.840
Oh,
and then on the side,
they have a blind MMA champion,

745
00:46:51.841 --> 00:46:54.180
takes on a new takes on new fight.

746
00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:59.200
The American who fled gay conversation in Africa.

747
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:05.870
Everybody just has clickbait mum's bullying campaign leads to honesty,

748
00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:07.870
honesty,
app band.

749
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.880
Immigration dominates the Italian election.

750
00:47:11.881 --> 00:47:16.881
There's a decent story breakthrough breakthrough's take time to sell

751
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.600
rare photographs that changed lives.

752
00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:28.830
Boy.
All right.
What are we doing here?
Okay.
Uh,

753
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:32.810
let's back to whatever the fuck I was just really,
all right.

754
00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:37.840
A radiologist explains why a bullet from an ar 15 is so lethal.

755
00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:44.240
Was anybody questioning?
I just thought that kind of bounced off.
Yeah.

756
00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.600
Um,
okay.
Hey Bill,

757
00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:51.230
love what you do and you are an amazing asset to the community.
Oh yeah.

758
00:47:51.231 --> 00:47:53.030
Buttered me up.
I'm definitely going to read this.

759
00:47:53.031 --> 00:47:57.080
I recently found this article from the viewpoint of a radiologist concerning the

760
00:47:57.081 --> 00:48:00.470
power of an ar 15 a year.

761
00:48:00.471 --> 00:48:03.020
Usually you don't hear the viewpoints from people in the medical field.

762
00:48:03.021 --> 00:48:06.980
It's the viewpoint that makes this piece unique and joy.

763
00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:11.540
All right,
go to the page.

764
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:15.140
Okay,
here we go.

765
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:18.543
<v 0>Okay.</v>

766
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:23.950
<v 1>What I saw treating the victims from parkland should change the debate on guns.</v>

767
00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.860
They weren't the first mass shooting victims.

768
00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:31.200
The Florida radio floater radiologist saw,

769
00:48:31.201 --> 00:48:33.060
but the wounds for radically different.

770
00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:37.080
As I opened the CT scan last week to read the next case,

771
00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:40.680
I was baffled the history,
simply red gunshot wounds.

772
00:48:40.681 --> 00:48:44.190
I had been a radiologist and one of the busiest trauma centers in the United

773
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:47.400
States for 13 years and have diagnosed thousands of handgun injuries to the

774
00:48:47.401 --> 00:48:52.320
brain,
lung,
liver,
spleen,
bowel,
and vital Oregon.
Oregon's,

775
00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:56.820
uh,
I thought that I knew that all that I needed to know about gunshot wounds,

776
00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:01.290
but this specific pattern in injury injury on my computer screen was one that I

777
00:49:01.291 --> 00:49:05.220
had only seen once before.
In a typical hand gun injury,

778
00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.380
which I diagnosed almost daily,

779
00:49:07.381 --> 00:49:12.381
a bullet leaves a laceration through an organ such as the liver to radiologists.

780
00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:16.590
It appears as a linear thin gray bullet tracked through the Oregon.

781
00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:20.640
There may be bleeding and some bullet fragments.
Um,

782
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:26.640
I was looking at a CT scan of one of the mass shooting victims from them.
Uh,

783
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:30.240
Marjorie Stoneham,
Douglas high school.
Oh,
I said that right.

784
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:32.280
Did I say majority earlier?

785
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:36.390
Who had been brought to the trauma center during my call shift?

786
00:49:36.391 --> 00:49:41.391
The Oregon look like an overripe Mellon smashed by a sledge hammer and was

787
00:49:41.881 --> 00:49:46.110
bleeding extensively.
How could a gun shot wound caused this much damage?

788
00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:48.810
The reaction in the emergency room was the same.

789
00:49:48.811 --> 00:49:52.110
One of the trauma surgeons opened a young victims in the operating room and

790
00:49:52.111 --> 00:49:53.910
found only shreds of the Oregon

791
00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.100
that had been hit by the bullet from an ar 15 is semiotic rifle that delivers a

792
00:50:00.101 --> 00:50:03.340
devastatingly lethal high velocity bullet to the victim.

793
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:06.580
Nothing was left to repair and utterly devastating.

794
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.470
Nothing can be done to fix the problem.

795
00:50:08.471 --> 00:50:12.970
The injury was fatal a year ago when a gunman opened fire at the Fort Lauderdale

796
00:50:12.971 --> 00:50:17.410
airport with a nine millimeter semiautomatic handgun hitting 11 people in 90

797
00:50:17.411 --> 00:50:19.450
seconds I was on call.

798
00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:23.410
It was not until I had diagnosed the third big third of the six stress victims

799
00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:26.710
who were transported to the trauma center that I realized something out of the

800
00:50:26.711 --> 00:50:28.920
ordinary must've happened that gun shots,

801
00:50:28.921 --> 00:50:33.200
wounds where the same low level of velocity handgun injuries that I diagnosed

802
00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:33.721
every day,

803
00:50:33.721 --> 00:50:38.721
only rapid succession set them apart and all six of the victims who arrived at

804
00:50:39.811 --> 00:50:41.550
the hospital that they survived.

805
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:46.140
Routine handgun injuries leave entry and exit wounds and linear tracks through

806
00:50:46.141 --> 00:50:48.660
the victim's body that are roughly the size of the bullet.

807
00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:53.520
The bullet does not directly hit something crucial like the heart or the aorta.

808
00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:57.390
The victim does not bleed to death before being transported to care at the

809
00:50:57.391 --> 00:51:01.380
trauma center.
Chances are that we can save them.
The bullet is fired by an air.

810
00:51:01.381 --> 00:51:02.400
15 are different.

811
00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:06.600
They travel at a higher velocity and for far more lethal than routine bullets

812
00:51:06.601 --> 00:51:08.070
from five from a handgun.

813
00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:12.270
The damage they cause is a function of the energy they impart as they pass

814
00:51:12.271 --> 00:51:13.104
through the body.

815
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:18.180
Typical air 50 bullet leaves the barrel traveling almost three times faster and

816
00:51:18.181 --> 00:51:21.510
in party more than three times the energy of a typical nine millimeter bullet

817
00:51:21.511 --> 00:51:25.920
from a handgun in ar 15 rifle outfitted with the magazine with 50 rounds allows

818
00:51:25.921 --> 00:51:30.600
many more lethal bullets to be delivered quickly without reloading.
All right,

819
00:51:30.601 --> 00:51:34.230
that's,
yeah,
that's a machine gun.
I've seen a handful of air,

820
00:51:34.231 --> 00:51:35.580
15 injuries my career.

821
00:51:35.581 --> 00:51:40.581
Years ago I saw one from a man shot in the back by a swat team.

822
00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:45.120
The injury along the path of the bullet from the air 15 is vastly different from

823
00:51:45.121 --> 00:51:47.960
a low velocity velocity handgun.
The bull.
Okay,
I get it.
I get it.

824
00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:49.803
<v 3>MMM.</v>

825
00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:55.170
<v 1>All right,
so there you go.
So there's that fucking viewpoint.</v>

826
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:58.500
I feel like all of a sudden we're doing like an NPR show here.

827
00:51:58.501 --> 00:52:02.520
Like there's nothing funny anymore.
This is all ar 15 stuff.

828
00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:07.470
All right.
Here's one.
Should we move to California?
Hey,
Billy leprechaun.

829
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:12.240
My girlfriend and I are sick of the winters in Ontario,

830
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.170
a half the year.
It's cold,
snowy and gloomy.

831
00:52:16.171 --> 00:52:19.980
My girlfriend and I fantasize about moving somewhere that's warm year round.

832
00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:21.870
Should we move to California?

833
00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:26.440
Is it all it's cracked up to be looking forward to seeing you in Kitchener in

834
00:52:26.441 --> 00:52:29.730
March?
Um,
you know,

835
00:52:29.731 --> 00:52:31.620
the grass is always great.

836
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:35.550
This sand is always brown.

837
00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:38.250
Um,

838
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:40.400
<v 3>okay.</v>

839
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.570
<v 1>You know,
uh,</v>

840
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:46.490
I don't think California needs any body else to move here.

841
00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:51.491
It's really overpopulated and there's a lot of advantages to living where you're

842
00:52:53.541 --> 00:52:54.374
living.

843
00:52:55.060 --> 00:53:00.020
I pen to Ontario a bunch of times.
It's God's country up there.

844
00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.870
I know it gets cold and that type of shit,

845
00:53:02.871 --> 00:53:07.670
but the fact that you live where there's a water supply,

846
00:53:07.671 --> 00:53:08.350
you're not cutting.

847
00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:11.330
I mean if you want to just live in a constant state of drought,

848
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:14.350
I always feel like when you live in Los Angeles,

849
00:53:14.351 --> 00:53:17.570
you're like eight years ahead of the curve as far as like environmental

850
00:53:17.571 --> 00:53:21.650
disasters because Los Angeles is an environmental disaster.

851
00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:24.830
Never should have existed.

852
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:30.970
We had to steal water to be here and they're building all these skyscrapers and

853
00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:32.621
you know,

854
00:53:32.621 --> 00:53:37.140
it was kind of Nice for a minute or a little bit after those fucking banker
cons.

855
00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.150
Cook the economy.

856
00:53:38.151 --> 00:53:43.130
A bunch of people left La and now they're all being driven back into the city.

857
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:46.130
And the,
uh,
we,
we won,

858
00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:50.150
we won the most congested city in the United States.
And that's saying something.

859
00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:55.180
So if that's what she wanted to become a part of,
um,

860
00:53:55.730 --> 00:54:00.730
San Francisco is more expensive than a New York City at this point.

861
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.840
I got to tell you,
it's breathtakingly beautiful state though,

862
00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:09.710
when you go a little north of where I'm at and if you can appreciate the desert

863
00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:13.800
desert is also very beautiful,
but uh,
to be living in it is,

864
00:54:13.801 --> 00:54:18.530
is a little unsettling if you read up on it.
Um,

865
00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:22.730
but you know,
I'm in the business I'm in,

866
00:54:22.731 --> 00:54:27.200
so I got to fucking live out here.
I don't know what business you're in,

867
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:32.300
but,
um,
I dunno,
you know what I would do?

868
00:54:32.301 --> 00:54:36.710
I would just take an awesome vacation every year with your girlfriend and just

869
00:54:36.711 --> 00:54:41.540
break up the winner,
you know,
take a week and like

870
00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.720
a weekend or like a week,

871
00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:47.420
whatever the fuck you want to do and just get the fuck out of dodge.

872
00:54:47.421 --> 00:54:51.650
Just break it up till it's all you really need to do because the trade off is

873
00:54:51.651 --> 00:54:55.970
what you're going to be doing is now you're going to live in a climate where

874
00:54:57.590 --> 00:55:01.430
it's like people come here to go on vacation to go out to like Santa Monica and

875
00:55:01.431 --> 00:55:03.770
shit.
So,
um,

876
00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.590
once you kind of live in where there's palm trees and shit,

877
00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:11.940
which are not indigenous to here and I've learned,
uh,

878
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:18.130
it's not really exciting to go to a lot of places after that.
You're like,
Oh wow,

879
00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:22.300
this looks like where I live.
You know,
I actually get excited by the winter.

880
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:27.220
It's weird.
I Dunno.
I can't make these decisions for you.
I don't know.

881
00:55:27.221 --> 00:55:31.270
I don't fucking,
I don't pretend to know.
Um,

882
00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.940
all right,
back to the gun shit.
And this is,

883
00:55:33.941 --> 00:55:35.170
this is the last time I'm doing the gun shit,

884
00:55:35.171 --> 00:55:37.510
cause I'm not sure this is not going to become the gun podcast.

885
00:55:37.511 --> 00:55:41.890
I just find people's opinions really interesting here because I don't,

886
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:46.060
uh,
you know,
I don't,

887
00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:50.770
I don't own guns and that type of shit.
So I find it interesting.
All right,
Bill.

888
00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.440
I own multiple air fifteens eight,

889
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:58.970
that they are being used for mass shootings.
Contrary from what you hear,

890
00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:04.070
they're best for use is for hunting mostly varmints,

891
00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.730
Fox,
coyotes,
prairie dogs,
et cetera.
Now,

892
00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:12.530
Pharma is the proper word by the way.
Um,

893
00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:13.641
you sending me,

894
00:56:13.641 --> 00:56:17.180
Sam ruined that word that made it made everybody who uses the word farm.

895
00:56:17.181 --> 00:56:21.170
It's sound like a fucking moron.
Let me look up the exact definition here.

896
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:22.913
[inaudible]

897
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.840
farming a troublesome wild animal,
a troublesome and mish.
Mish,
devious person,

898
00:56:30.841 --> 00:56:34.620
especially a child.
Uh,
an animal considered a past,

899
00:56:34.621 --> 00:56:39.621
specifically one classified as vermin and unprotected by game law.

900
00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:45.300
A varmint hunting is the practice of hunting.
I hate when they do this.

901
00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.233
Affirming,

902
00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:51.990
generally small mammals targeted as a means of pest control rather than for
food.

903
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:56.520
Varmints or may refer to a varmint hunter or describe hunting.
Okay,

904
00:56:56.521 --> 00:56:59.730
so this guy is using this correctly.
Before everybody who

905
00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:03.390
thinks this is you sending me Sam writing it,

906
00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:06.810
they are extremely accurate and have very little recoil.

907
00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:11.400
I'm able to shoot holes in quarters at a hundred yards.
Jesus,

908
00:57:11.401 --> 00:57:15.630
that's fucking impressive.
They are very fun to take to a range and shoot.

909
00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:18.450
With that said at gun shows and stores,

910
00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:24.080
there's a really sad culture of losers that talk about tactical situations like

911
00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:28.410
their real life.
John Rambo's.
Uh,
yeah,

912
00:57:28.411 --> 00:57:33.360
they're basically like the fantasy football players,
you know,

913
00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:37.290
acting like they know how to run a fucking football team except their gun
owners.

914
00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:41.370
Uh,
they usually look like vermin.
Oh,
oh,

915
00:57:41.371 --> 00:57:45.040
virgin basement dwellers.
Uh,

916
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:49.230
the thing a lot of people don't understand about the ar 15 is that it's a

917
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:52.020
modular rifle,
modular rifle.

918
00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:54.600
I buy them in parts and assemble them on my own.

919
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:58.230
There's billions and billions of parts that would be available forever through

920
00:57:58.231 --> 00:58:03.030
private parties to make more rifles stale.
They will never go away.

921
00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:05.760
We need to get more security in schools.

922
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:10.080
There should be no way anyone should be able to walk into a school with a gun.

923
00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:12.953
<v 8>MMM.</v>

924
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:18.790
<v 1>It's okay.
So what then if you have a metal detector at the school,</v>

925
00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:23.140
no one could get in with the gun,
which sounds good,
but then you know,

926
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:24.370
we used to fucking,

927
00:58:24.371 --> 00:58:27.700
they used to let you run around and play outside the school before you went in,

928
00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:33.220
so when the kid just show up there.
All right.
A metal detector on the bus.

929
00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:34.570
No,
I actually agree with that.

930
00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:37.840
I think that that would be smart because there's billions and billions of parts

931
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:42.900
of avoid Google Ruger mini 14 I t a mini 14 it does the same thing.

932
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.910
Does it look scary?
The problem isn't the guns.

933
00:58:48.911 --> 00:58:53.911
My guns will never be used for hunting humans in Minnesota where I live,

934
00:58:54.041 --> 00:58:58.930
to where I live to get parts or complete a ours,

935
00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:02.800
you have to go to the county sheriff and get a permit to purchase card.

936
00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:06.910
They take about four weeks to get and have a pretty stringent background check.

937
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:10.420
I think it would be great if the entire country had the same process.

938
00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:13.330
I think the second amendment is just as important as the first.

939
00:59:13.331 --> 00:59:15.670
I wish we could all have an honest conversation about it.

940
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:20.410
I would say a calm conversation about it.
I'm the last one I'll read here.

941
00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:24.130
Fucked up country a there.

942
00:59:24.131 --> 00:59:26.500
Billy Strong jaws saw this on reddit.

943
00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.450
It's a story about how a 15 year old girl with learning disabilities and severe

944
00:59:31.451 --> 00:59:36.451
ADHD got in prison for throwing apples at a mailman.

945
00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:40.840
I went to prison was center president,
you mean?

946
00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:45.220
She continued to struggle with the offers officers through the entire process

947
00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:50.520
and ended up doing five years until she hung herself after the first shitty

948
00:59:50.531 --> 00:59:51.850
prison transfer.

949
00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:53.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

950
00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:55.450
<v 1>Transferred her to a federal prison for women.</v>

951
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:59.750
Is this true?
This sounds fucking crazy.

952
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.340
They interview a girl she knew in prison who said she would talk back to the

953
01:00:04.341 --> 01:00:08.960
guards because she thought it was funny the whole time she was in there.

954
01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.350
She thought it was silly that she was in prison for throwing apples,

955
01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.720
whatever side of the spectrum she's on.

956
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:17.930
She had the mentality the whole time she was in there.

957
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.670
She had that mentality a whole time.

958
01:00:21.671 --> 01:00:24.880
She was in there at one point they put her in this harness thing.

959
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:29.830
That is the most ridiculous dehumanizing thing you've ever seen as well as

960
01:00:29.831 --> 01:00:31.160
putting on a hockey helmet.

961
01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:35.710
So she couldn't swing her head around while tied down because they didn't want

962
01:00:35.711 --> 01:00:37.720
her to be a danger to yourself.

963
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:43.260
It's at the 12th 33 Ma,
I don't wanna watch this.
This sounds horrible.
Anyways,

964
01:00:43.261 --> 01:00:46.470
I'm thinking,
man,
our country present system is fucked up.

965
01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:52.250
Then they said that it was somewhere in Ontario and let me tell you,

966
01:00:52.261 --> 01:00:54.990
Bill Canada hides behind the shitty prime minister.

967
01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:59.370
Minister do good Douche who just said the right thing all the time.

968
01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.860
Meanwhile they had mental health protocol.
Yeah.
Oh boy.

969
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:08.890
Meanwhile they had mental health protocol than anything I've seen in a duck.

970
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.301
You mean worse?

971
01:01:10.301 --> 01:01:13.940
You kind of left a word out about the US prison system that I can recall.

972
01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:17.330
Fair enough.
Oh,
so Canada did all of this shit.

973
01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:24.830
Let me see here.
Clicking on the link.
What we've got here,

974
01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:29.413
<v 0>right?</v>

975
01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.390
<v 1>I,
I don't,
I don't want to do,
I don't want to watch this.</v>

976
01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:40.980
I don't want to watch that.
Um,
anyways.
All right,

977
01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:41.761
well there we go.

978
01:01:41.761 --> 01:01:46.740
So that's going to be the end of the gun debate on this fucking podcast.
Um,

979
01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:48.480
I dunno,

980
01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.930
I helping people just understand that people who live out in the air quote

981
01:01:51.931 --> 01:01:54.570
middle of nowhere,
you know,

982
01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:59.860
like how they're living and how they have to defend themselves as different than

983
01:02:00.301 --> 01:02:03.480
you like living in a city.
Um,

984
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:05.560
<v 0>okay.</v>

985
01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.500
<v 1>You know,
and then they can also go out and hunt and they know how to hunt,</v>

986
01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.230
which is a,
you know,

987
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:13.410
<v 0>okay.</v>

988
01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:15.630
<v 1>Probably the most important skill you can have.
You know,</v>

989
01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:16.800
if the shit hits the fan,

990
01:02:16.801 --> 01:02:21.801
the fact that you know how to fucking go out and get something to eat without

991
01:02:21.981 --> 01:02:25.370
going to a supermarket.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

992
01:02:25.371 --> 01:02:29.780
I think Ravin listened to all of you guys there has the,

993
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:32.900
we just have to have a better system of a,

994
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.380
I don't know how to do it.
How do you,
how do you make sure,

995
01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.560
how do you make sure that crazy people don't get guns?

996
01:02:39.561 --> 01:02:44.180
So then regular people who just want to enjoy them and fucking hunt or just

997
01:02:44.181 --> 01:02:45.350
shoot up a bunch of shit.

998
01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:46.623
<v 0>Okay,</v>

999
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:48.880
<v 1>oh,
whatever.
Or they just don't trust the government,</v>

1000
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:51.220
which I don't think it's paranoid.

1001
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1002
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:54.920
<v 1>Uh,
considering what has been done to our food supply,</v>

1003
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:58.280
the pharmaceutical companies,
bankers,
insurance companies,

1004
01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:02.390
how they just kind of are able to do whatever the fuck they want to do.

1005
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:07.670
And if you really look at a lot of this shit that they've done
to this country,

1006
01:03:07.671 --> 01:03:08.130
it's,

1007
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:12.980
it's acts of terrorism that a lot of terrorists groups would fucking jerk off
to.

1008
01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:18.230
Okay.
Poisoning the food supply,
uh,
you know,

1009
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:23.630
making American sick,
cooking the economy,

1010
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:28.670
all of that type of shit.
Uh,
putting shit in the water supply.
I mean,
that's,

1011
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:33.620
those are all terrorists.
That's shit the terrorist fucking jerk off to.
Um,

1012
01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:37.880
so I understand why people would not trust the government at that fucking point.

1013
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:38.390
I Dunno.

1014
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:42.950
I Dunno what all I know is that after awhile it gets overwhelmingly depressing

1015
01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:46.760
and I don't know what to do about it.
And uh,
and that's it.

1016
01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:50.210
I'm going to go play with my kid and go play some drums.
That's it.

1017
01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:54.230
God bless all of you.
God bless all you responsible fucking gun owners out there.

1018
01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:56.970
God bless all you people out there who feel like,
yeah,

1019
01:03:56.971 --> 01:03:59.180
if we just got rid of all of them,
Hey God,
you know what?

1020
01:04:00.110 --> 01:04:03.560
God bless everyone and go fuck yourselves.
Each and every one.
Again,

1021
01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.580
those of you who have guns and those you don't,
all right,

1022
01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.860
this has been a fucking moron who to try to get to the bottom of something and

1023
01:04:11.861 --> 01:04:12.950
he failed miserably.

1024
01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:17.800
I'll check in on Thursday and I got to start watching some Bruins games.

1025
01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:19.760
I got to figure this out.
Okay?

1026
01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:25.220
Every morning I'm watching puppy dog pals and fam arena with my daughter.

1027
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:27.710
Uh,
maybe I can get her,
watch her a little,
maybe just,

1028
01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.740
maybe I'll just start watching the first period.
That's better than no period,

1029
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:34.250
right?
I fucking know.
All right.
I'll talk to you on Thursday.
