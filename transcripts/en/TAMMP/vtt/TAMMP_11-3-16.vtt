1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.500
Oh

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon?</v>

3
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:07.900
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and,
Huh?

4
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.670
Just checking in on you.
Sorry Cleo.

5
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.450
My dog just popped up like what the fuck dude?
What's going on everybody?

6
00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:24.230
How are Ya?
How's it going?
Do you guys watch any sports lately?
Go Jays,

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.440
baseball there.

8
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.990
<v 0>Um,
Jesus Christ.
What a difference.</v>

9
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:35.991
A couple of fucking days makes my god the fucking Cleveland Indians up three

10
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:40.840
games to one looking to end their streak.
Do,

11
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.460
did I call it or did I fucking call it?
Ah,
what did I say?

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.500
Did I say it to you guys?
I thought I said that.
This is just fitting.

13
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.160
They say that on Monday cause I think it was three games to two by then I said

14
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:56.970
that whatever team was going to fucking win was going to look like they were

15
00:00:56.971 --> 00:00:57.661
going to lose.

16
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:00.870
So they taught you the shit out of their fans or whatever team was going to
lose,

17
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:02.220
was going to look like they were gonna win.

18
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.460
Cause they'd take their emotions right through the fucking stratosphere and then

19
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:10.461
slam 'em right down on the pavement and gain seven was literally the microcosm

20
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.570
that Delta,
what they'll weigh.

21
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.010
That whole fucking game played out was basically,

22
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:20.700
if you ever wanted to know what it was like to be a Chicago cub or a Cleveland

23
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:24.750
Indian fan and the only reason why they both didn't face plan each other is

24
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.090
because mathematically it was not an option.

25
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.690
Somebody had to win the fucking thing,
but neither team was just get,

26
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:36.690
neither team was just going to win this fucking series.
That was basically it.

27
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:38.490
That was the point I was trying to make the other day.

28
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.870
They were going to torture the fuck out of their fans to the point that even if

29
00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:44.130
they did win the thing,

30
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.450
he'd still have some sort of nervous fucking twitch or a tick for like three

31
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:52.500
days afterwards.
Jesus Christ.
What a game.
If you didn't watch game seven,

32
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:56.130
I feel bad for you as a fucking human being,
you know,

33
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:58.890
as it's fucking 71 degrees in Cleveland,

34
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:01.320
Ohio in November,

35
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.500
<v 1>that no reason to be concerned.
Let's play it off.</v>

36
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.940
<v 0>Oh,
Jesus.
Okay.</v>

37
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.840
<v 1>Enjoy it.
Enjoy.
While last people,</v>

38
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.960
before we get to the tipping point where this global warming thing isn't a fun

39
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:16.580
thing in November anymore.
Anyways,

40
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.170
back to bread and circus.
Let's talk a little baseball here.
Dot.
The base fault.

41
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.480
Um,
congratulations.

42
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.460
<v 0>Two,</v>

43
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.020
<v 1>2016 world series champions.</v>

44
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.700
The fucking Chicago.

45
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.800
<v 0>I never thought I'd died.
Yeah,
I didn't.
I mean,</v>

46
00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:38.470
I guess I thought I'd say that at some point when it finally saw the red sox

47
00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:43.180
winning.
Congratulations to the cubs fans.
I've been there,
you know,

48
00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:47.620
and I only,
I only last,
you know,
out of the 86 years,
I only saw 36 years of it.

49
00:02:47.621 --> 00:02:49.750
Right?
Of course,
you know,
whatever the first 10,

50
00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:53.980
you're just a kid running around fucking sticking shit.
It fucking,
you know,

51
00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:56.950
you're poking dead skunks and stuff.
You don't give a fuck about a curse.
Right.

52
00:02:56.951 --> 00:03:01.440
Some for my teen years on,
I,
I've suffered 20 fucking years.
If I'm honest.
Uh,

53
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.810
I vaguely remember 78 and know 86 was my,

54
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.390
was my christening as a red sox fan.
Like,
hey bill,

55
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:12.970
this is what it's going to be like.
Buckle up.
Right?

56
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:17.620
So I've been there and Cleveland Indian fans,
my condolences.
I been there too.

57
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.990
I've fucking been there too.
But what a fucking game that was Jesus Christ.

58
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.600
And you knew what?
The cubs had to go out early.
They had a score,

59
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:28.390
a bunch of fucking rungs because as the game went on,

60
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.630
it was going to tip in favor of the Indians because they had,

61
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:36.610
they had fresh or arms and everybody was fucking shitting on all fucking,

62
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.490
uh,
the guy from the devil rays.
I don't know anybody's names,
by the way.

63
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.130
I don't know anybody's name.
So just fucking deal with it.

64
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.770
And they were all shitting on him for putting Chapman in there.

65
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.220
I'm on the depth chart now so I can look at the face and know who the fuck I'm

66
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:51.410
talking about.
Right for keep putting Chapter Julian.

67
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.210
It's like,
dude,
they've played three elimination games in a row.

68
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.920
You got to use the guy.

69
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.320
<v 3>Don't you think he brought a middle to early?</v>

70
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.130
<v 0>I love when people say that they haven't even coached a little league fucking</v>

71
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:09.280
team to a victory yet.
And they're questioning what a major league,

72
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.700
I mean I guess she can question it but,
and it's always like,

73
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:15.370
well the guy who I would have put in who didn't go in and see,

74
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.040
you have no idea what would happen would have happened if you put him in.

75
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:21.460
I'm going to hypothetically say that we then would have won the fucking game or

76
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.290
already gone smoother.
So I look smarter.

77
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.610
They had to put that guy in there and um,
what was,

78
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.360
what was the big problem you put the fucking guy in instead of throwing 105 he

79
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:35.770
was throwing 98 I mean,
well what are you gonna do?
You had to do it.

80
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.010
Cubs go up.
I can't remember what the fuck happened.

81
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:43.150
There was so many goddamn twists and turns.
What was it?
It was like five to one

82
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.320
then like a wild pitch or whatever and fucking lie ahead.
Cheese.

83
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.700
You want to see the funniest fucking,
if you want to see the funniest,
like,

84
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.560
like run a tweets.
Go look at Jason Law heads,
Twitter,
that fucking guy,

85
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.780
he quit in the fifth inning.

86
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.830
You know I was just going to wait to the pitchers and catchers report,
right?

87
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:07.300
And then fucking two seconds later,
wild pitch.
It's five to fucking tree.

88
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.280
It's still a game.
Oh,
I never saw a guy.
He just what?

89
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:16.190
He was packing it in,
packing it in packing it in.
Um,

90
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.970
and you said he wasn't going to tweet anymore until the catcher's pitcher's

91
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.730
reported and then all of a sudden they fucking tie it up.
That home run.

92
00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:26.350
Who the fuck can I got to get his name right though?

93
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:29.830
It's Cleveland step stepchild.
Davis,
right?
Was that oh it was the left fielder.

94
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.860
Holy Shit.
I gotta tell you something right now.
I flip flopped so many times.

95
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.810
Who the fuck I wanted to see when I initially I was with Cleveland cause

96
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:42.160
everybody wanted the cubs fans.

97
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.190
I saw that 30 for 30 with Bartman and I was just like,
you know,

98
00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:49.360
at these guys did not the fucking salt of the earth people that they try to make

99
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:53.290
them out to be the happy go lucky,
take his shirt off.
Maybe we win,
maybe we lose.

100
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.650
As long as we enjoy the America's pastime,
these aren't who these are.

101
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.300
They're just like me.
Every red sox,
every Yankees,
that'd be Philly Fan.

102
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:04.670
I actually argued with the,
a Yankee fan today was going like,

103
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:08.300
fuck the cubs that Steve Bartman Shit.
They ruined that kid's life.

104
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.270
That wouldn't have happened in New York.
I was like,
get the fuck out of,

105
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:13.580
you know when that happened in New York,
what happened in New York,

106
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.720
it would have happened in Boston.
But you know what,
in fairness to cubs fan base,

107
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:20.870
what that really was was the morning,
you know,
the shock jock guys.

108
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.440
And what they did was they stirred up the lower 10% 15% of people,

109
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:29.000
you know,
it was pissed as I would be or whatever.

110
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:33.110
There's no fucking way what you really get on a phone and start making depth,

111
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.861
death threats.

112
00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:38.000
I mean really think about the level of mouth breathing more on that you would

113
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:42.350
have to be to take it to that level.
Um,
so I don't,
so whatever.

114
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:46.130
So initially that's kind of,
I was,
I'm a contrary and everyone's for the cubs.

115
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:48.620
So I was rooting for the fucking Indians.
And then what happens?

116
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:51.590
They went up three games to one and I'm texting with a couple of my Indian

117
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:54.530
buddies and one of them is a cheat.
She's just so fucking like,

118
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:58.500
we know when they were winning a game four and it was like,
you know,

119
00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.370
I don't know nine to something.
And he was going through it.
I,
I hope,

120
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:04.430
I hope it goes all the way up to like fucking,
I always go 19 runs.

121
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:07.850
I hope they run out of pitchers.
And immediately I was thinking like,

122
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:12.050
Jesus Christ,
how quickly the suffering forget.
Why would you wish that on them?

123
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:16.250
You just want to win.
Right?
And then he was going like,
now we've got Lebron.

124
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:18.440
This is just the beginning.
We're going to go on a run,

125
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.140
like they were going to stick and somebody tweeted or texted Cleveland title

126
00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:27.350
town after two fucking titles.
You don't even have a fucking hockey team.

127
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:33.020
And you end up in the Brown and study.
You lost your fucking team.

128
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.930
You know,
the city treated him so shitty.

129
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.710
They thought Baltimore was a better fucking option.
All right,

130
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.770
you're far from fucking.
So then they started bugging me.

131
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.630
I'm just a contrarion cunt.

132
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.260
I didn't have a dog in the fight and I was happy that one fee.

133
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.260
It'd be honest with you.
I was happy for Cleveland or Chicago that went teams.
Uh,

134
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:56.030
misery was going to end,
right.
So at that point then I was like,
well,
fuck this.

135
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:57.380
I'm going to root for the cubs.
Right.

136
00:07:57.381 --> 00:08:00.200
I've got a couple of relatives that cubs fans and I got to say,
I'm fucking,

137
00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:02.600
you know,
I'll,
I'll go to shit.
Then I was kind of like,
yeah,

138
00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:05.840
but I like the Indians Fan.
I like,
I like Cleveland,
you know,

139
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.210
Cleveland needs a fucking hand dude,
that downtown area.

140
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:11.660
It's gradually coming back.
Every time I come there,
it looks better.

141
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.830
I love the Midwest.
Well Chicago's Midwest too,
but I don't know,

142
00:08:14.831 --> 00:08:17.730
that's kind of so like the New York City of the Midwest,
um,

143
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.420
tremendously underrated city still.
But anyways,

144
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.690
so it's still kind of hanging in there for them.
And uh,

145
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.850
you know what the final tipping point was when Mike Friends Saska trashed the

146
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:32.720
fucking cubs for showing Bill Murray Goldman Udl,
sue her,
you know,

147
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:36.560
the whole dual Marijo Durfee talk thing.
You know,
it didn't work for me.

148
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.480
Mike Francesca,
who gives a fuck what works for you and what does it,

149
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:46.120
your team's not in the playoff.
All right,
you're a nonfactor.

150
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.660
Your team's a nonfactor.
It the funniest fucking thing,
man.
I Yankee fans,

151
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:55.350
they cannot handle the fact that other people are winning championships and a

152
00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:56.250
good fucking time.

153
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.340
And it's sort of the unwritten rule because whenever the Yankees won a world

154
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:04.080
series,
which God knows is quite a bit like ESPN there,
their stock line is,

155
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:07.830
they'll go in all is right in the baseball world again.
It's like,

156
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.490
aren't you guys supposed to pretend that you're kind of rooting for any,

157
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:16.170
you're not really rooting for anybody.
Um,
so anyways,

158
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:17.820
fuck Mike Francesco,
Francesco.

159
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:20.910
He's one of those fucking guys who doesn't realize that he's just as stupid as I

160
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:25.230
am.
He's one of those guys where he's just been doing it so fucking long that he

161
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.440
really,
he forgets that he's just commenting on shit.

162
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:32.310
That doesn't matter dude.
You're talking about a baseball game.

163
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.990
Okay.
All the shit that has happened even in New York,
fucking New York City,

164
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:38.460
all this shit that's fucking happened there.

165
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.540
The cataclysmic world events that have happened there and the level of

166
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:46.530
seriousness that that guy takes himself.
Oh,
with his stethoscope,

167
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:48.900
fucking headphones.
That guy,
he drives me up the fuck.

168
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:51.630
I haven't never been more happy that for fucking mad dog when he got the fuck

169
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:55.050
out of there.
Jesus Christ to be looking across from that pompous ass.

170
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.700
Is there anything worse than the box seats fucking sports fan that is just so

171
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:04.050
fucking impressed with themselves and their dumb sweaters and shit?
I Dunno.

172
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.900
You give them a little more fancy as seat,
and I'm telling you it's,

173
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:10.860
it's like the space shuttle for their ego and they just go right up over here.

174
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:13.590
The daffy duck thing didn't work for me.
Oh God.
Well maybe,

175
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:15.630
maybe the cubs out of fucking,
you know,

176
00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:20.550
rethink their relationship with Bill Murray.
Hey Mike,

177
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.510
are you the fucking Bill Murray of,
of,

178
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.690
of sports broadcasters fucking Jack off.

179
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.930
He's just another guy who watches sports and never gets on a treadmill.

180
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.900
I don't understand.
How can you look at all those guys in that level of shape?

181
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.080
And when you're at the end of the game,
when you go into brush your teeth,

182
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.420
you don't look at yourself like Jesus Christ.

183
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:43.320
Can I at least need a fucking salad?
Every once in a while?
Oh,
this feels right.

184
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.340
This feels great to totally overreact to what he said.
It's a fun thing.

185
00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:52.080
So anyways,
um,
congratulations to the Chicago cubs.

186
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.880
You got the fucking goat off your back.

187
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:56.790
Whatever the fuck you want to call it was the dumbest curse ever.
Okay?

188
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.690
You can't bring livestock to a baseball game.
All right?
You know,

189
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.260
what she really did is you did not have a curse the same way the red sox didn't

190
00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:04.800
have a curse.

191
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.800
What it really was was you were fans of an unbelievably inept franchise for a

192
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:14.730
long fucking time.
And uh,
thank God,
you know,

193
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.090
we finally got Theo Epstein,
we finally got Terry Francona,

194
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.960
we finally got the ownership that the red sox have and it all came together and

195
00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:26.520
we finally did what teams like the fucking Yankees,

196
00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:30.120
the cardinals,
the Patriots,
teams like that,
that know how to fucking win.

197
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.120
I actually can't say the Patriots.
That's even modern modern era.

198
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.540
The Celtics back in the day,
um,
you know,

199
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:39.750
as much as I hate the fucking Yankees like that,
their,
their front office,

200
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:43.650
their ownership,
their franchise,
their farm system,
it's the shit is the shit.

201
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.731
I mean,

202
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:47.550
you can't get mad at them for starting her own network for being smart enough to

203
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:49.290
do that.
I don't,
I don't hate on any of that shit,

204
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:52.810
but that whole fucking thing where all is right,
if,
if they win it is,

205
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.990
that's a little,
it goes a little beyond.
But other than that,

206
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:59.400
I don't begrudge their fucking 27 championships.
I really don't.
Um,

207
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:04.060
having said that,
we finally got the right people in place.

208
00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:08.290
So you finally got the right people in place.
And having said that,
um,

209
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.210
whoever was going to win last night,

210
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:15.211
the cubs or the Indians was an automatic one way fucking a ticket for either

211
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:22.360
Theo Epstein or Terry Francona into,
uh,
into the hall of fame.

212
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:26.530
So congratulations to Theo Epstein.
Um,
without a doubt.

213
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:29.590
I mean that guy ended the curse of the baby and the curse of the goat.
I mean,

214
00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:32.470
he needs a nickname at this point,
something right.

215
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.670
I can't think of it right now,
but I'm just saying that guy and 86,

216
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.010
[inaudible] 86 and 108,

217
00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:43.570
that's 186 and 894 years of suffering.
That fucking guy just ended,

218
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.850
you know,
it was like a champ too.
You see the guy in his forties,

219
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:50.620
he still looks like he used to be an astronaut.
I mean,

220
00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:52.600
the guy's just crushing it as somebody fucking levels.

221
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:57.310
You can really see how people would try to root against him and um,
whatever,
man,

222
00:12:57.311 --> 00:12:59.560
the Indians will definitely be back.
I gotta be honest with you,

223
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:02.170
I'm still more of an Indians fan than I am a cubs fan,

224
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:05.500
but it was so fucking great,
like seeing the look of joy on,

225
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:10.210
on a bill Murray's face.
And by the way,
uh,
what Fred says,
God like,

226
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:14.560
did you not enjoy seeing that?
Watching him?
She's fucking Lens,

227
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:19.240
however old he is,
was all just fucking coming out.
It was tremendous.
So,
um,

228
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.780
it was great.
It was what a fucking gay man,
Jesus Christ,
what a go.

229
00:13:23.781 --> 00:13:27.250
And then I forgot the fucking rain delay and then they tie it up.

230
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.680
They fucking tie it up.
And I was like,
oh my God,
this is on.
It's,

231
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.460
it's going to reverse again.
Like the way everyone's,
like,

232
00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:38.530
everyone just kind of thought the cubs are going to win it.

233
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.900
And then the Indians got three games to one.
They're like,
oh my God,

234
00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:42.370
the Indians are going to win it.
Then in reverse,

235
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.020
then it looks like the cubs are gonna win it.

236
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.140
And then the Indians tied fucking back up again and you're like,
fuck,

237
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.240
I know I'm getting hyped up here.
But Dude,
when,

238
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.370
when is baseball get this fucking exciting,
right?

239
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.300
And then it starts fucking raining and they bring out the fucking tarp.

240
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.610
That's the funniest shit.
And that's one of the great,

241
00:13:57.611 --> 00:14:01.510
that's like the sport within the sport of baseball is the fucking rain delay.

242
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.760
And they got to put a book.

243
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:08.500
If there's never been a book put out yet about people just talking about what

244
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:11.500
goes through your head as you're going through a fucking rain delay and you have

245
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:15.880
to sit there and fill up three hours of fucking broadcast time telling you

246
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:19.060
stories.
I mean,
that's when you got to hope that you got like a,
uh,

247
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.730
a Pete rose there.
You know what I mean?

248
00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:24.940
You got to have some guy with a zillion fucking stories that knows how to tell a

249
00:14:24.941 --> 00:14:28.840
story.
Um,
dude,
he,
how great was he?
He was fucking phenomenal.

250
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.570
A rod was great.
The big heart,

251
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.780
all of those guys when you got like hall of famers sitting there,

252
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.970
you know,
just the way they break down for nobody breaks it down like Pete Rose,

253
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.780
Jesus Christ,
you know all the games that that guy has played,

254
00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:46.990
all the experiences he's had and then you combine gambling on it.

255
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.770
So he took it to a whole other level of the way he looks at numbers.

256
00:14:50.771 --> 00:14:54.500
I mean the is like second to none with his analysis.

257
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.890
By the way,
Jason Heyward,
huge fan,

258
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.330
that fucking catchy made,

259
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.470
I forget what game where he leapt up and then had to reach back and then when he

260
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:07.304
fired the,

261
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.930
the through that strike like Dave Parker and the all star game grant,

262
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:14.780
Dave through it from the warning track to the home plate when he threw in a

263
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.680
second to get that guy out kill the fucking momentum is great.

264
00:15:18.681 --> 00:15:23.540
As that was the worst at bat of the fucking s of this series was his one of his

265
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:28.370
lasted bats.
Dude,
did you see the two pitches?
He fucking swung out.

266
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:29.810
I mean,
Jesus Christ,

267
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.430
50 cent could've struck him out at that a bad,
I mean it was,
it was like,

268
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.830
look where they just stayed.

269
00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.590
Take some fucking guy like 50 cent out of the crowd and the,
Oh my God,

270
00:15:39.591 --> 00:15:43.100
it's 50 cent and he just goes out and throws the ball.
You're like,
oh my God,

271
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.930
he really is an artist.
Um,
you got to look that up by the way.

272
00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:50.540
I think I tweeted when he did that,
I said,
50 cent didn't throw that ball.

273
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:55.110
Curtis Jackson did.
You have to see him and it's just like,
it was a,

274
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.220
I dunno,
it was like watching Jon Lester trying to throw to first base,

275
00:15:58.221 --> 00:16:02.690
which I had no idea that he,
he won't even do it.
I'm nuts.
Is that,

276
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.780
that's like a,
it was like chuck,

277
00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:10.730
not Chuck Knob locked Steve Sax Times fucking to at least one of the videos that

278
00:16:10.731 --> 00:16:15.320
I saw and thank God that he didn't.
But um,
anyways,

279
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.560
uh,
my condolences to the city of Cleveland,
man.
I,
I really,

280
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.170
I love that city and a municipal stadium.

281
00:16:21.171 --> 00:16:24.530
I'll let shit back in the day that I grew up watching.
Like I said,

282
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:27.710
one of my relatives lived out there when I was a kid and he kind of would always

283
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:30.680
be rooting for them and you know,
he was cool.

284
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.980
So I would fucking route for him to a buddy,
of course,
red sox first.

285
00:16:33.981 --> 00:16:36.830
So I always kind of had that thing with them and the Tigers that kind of like

286
00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:40.790
the surrogates if the,
uh,
the red sox aren't in it.
Um,

287
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.270
and I also liked the royals and I like the A's.

288
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.920
I don't know.
I like the pirates.
I like the cardinals.

289
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.340
I like the giants and I liked the Dodgers back in the day.

290
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.310
So I know there's a lot of teams that I fucking thing,
you know,

291
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.720
they all take a deep second to fucking,
the red sox aren't in it,

292
00:16:59.721 --> 00:17:02.150
you know what I mean?
So anyways,

293
00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:06.700
I even rooted for the Yankees in 2001 after nine 11,
I was like,
I fucking,

294
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.480
I got to set this shit aside and then the fucking diamond back speeding.

295
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.250
It's like,
fuck,
I should have been rude for these guys the whole time.

296
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:18.080
I wouldn't jinxed him.
So anyways,
congratulations.
Uh,
and Cleveland.
Amen.

297
00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:18.914
Your next,

298
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.550
or I guess I should be rooting for the Arizona cardinals cause they have the

299
00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:23.840
longest drought,

300
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:28.870
I guess with the championship since 1947 when they were the Chicago cardinals.

301
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.920
Um,
and then they went to,
uh,
I don't,

302
00:17:32.921 --> 00:17:34.790
I can't remember what the fucking lineage of that team is,

303
00:17:34.791 --> 00:17:38.000
but like I don't give a fuck about them because they've lived in so many fucking

304
00:17:38.001 --> 00:17:42.860
cities.
Like the city doesn't carry the pain.
Does that make sense?

305
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.680
Middle of Arizona cardinals right now.
Uh,

306
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.510
I'm surprised it didn't just pop up on my thing.

307
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:49.990
You know your computer like listens to you now I actually

308
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:53.160
<v 1>get did Arizona cardinals,
you have to do that.
You just say,
yeah,</v>

309
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:57.770
fucking a pumpernickel bread.
Oh,
what's in pumpernickel bread?
You break,

310
00:17:57.771 --> 00:18:00.950
you break like p you and then it says pumpernickel bread.
Like your phone.

311
00:18:00.951 --> 00:18:03.570
I'll do that.
Like who,
what the photo fucking odd.
Zach came up,

312
00:18:03.571 --> 00:18:04.404
you'll listen to me.

313
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.790
Said fucking robot lady in the phone.
She listens,
right?
She listens to,

314
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.720
Oh yeah,
she's listening to you.
Let's see here.
Official site.
No,

315
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.950
it's pretty sad case.

316
00:18:14.951 --> 00:18:19.110
She got to go to Wikipedia to find out their fucking history the quickest.

317
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.470
Actually.
Maybe it isn't.
All right,
here we go.
The cardinals,
let's see.

318
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:24.720
They were the Chicago cardinals,

319
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.040
1920 to 1943 they took a year off during the war.

320
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:34.610
1945 the 1959 uh oh they were the cardinals card pit in 1944 I thought they had

321
00:18:37.771 --> 00:18:41.980
the eagles in Pittsburgh and made the struggles.
Anyway,

322
00:18:41.981 --> 00:18:42.960
St Louis Cardinals,

323
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:47.961
1960 to 1987 Phoenix cartels 88 to 93 94 to present Arizona.

324
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:49.860
So they've been all right.
They've been cheated.

325
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.520
They've been in Phoenix for fucking almost 30 years.
Wow.

326
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.970
They've been there longer than they weren't St Louis.
How Jesus,
how about that?

327
00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:02.100
And they were in Chicago
basically for 29 years.

328
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:07.440
Isn't that something?
So they weren't being Arizona the longest,
then Chicago,

329
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:10.560
then Saint Louis.
So anyways,
I don't really count that fucking shit.
Let's see,

330
00:19:10.561 --> 00:19:12.090
the longest stretch.
I got to see the next person.

331
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:14.670
I give a fuck about pass Cleveland,
right?
Let's see.

332
00:19:14.671 --> 00:19:18.930
Longest sports droughts,
Big Bang,
boom,

333
00:19:18.931 --> 00:19:23.590
drought sports.
Uh,
longest active droughts in sports.
When was this?
May,

334
00:19:23.591 --> 00:19:28.320
this was done three hours ago.
Okay.
So they should be fairly accurate.

335
00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:33.270
Correct.
So it goes the Arizona cardinals,
then the Cleveland Indians.

336
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.170
Just give me the fucking list.
All right.

337
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:41.070
The Arizona cardinals shut up.
All right.

338
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.900
69 years.
Cleveland Indians,
68 years.
Sacramento,

339
00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:50.280
kings 1951.
They will like to Rochester royals I think,

340
00:19:50.281 --> 00:19:54.490
or some shit like that.
Uh,
they have a one in 65 years to Troy lion,

341
00:19:54.491 --> 00:19:56.640
seven one since 1957.

342
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:01.020
The Atlanta Hawks when they were the Saint Louis Hawks,
1958,

343
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:05.670
uh,
then the Philadelphia Eagles,
1960,

344
00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:10.680
uh,
Texas rangers.
Never 1955,

345
00:20:10.681 --> 00:20:14.070
never won a championship.
Tennessee titans,
they used to be the Houston Oilers.

346
00:20:14.071 --> 00:20:18.750
They want an AFL title in 1961.
It's a couple more here.
Houston Astros,

347
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.490
never 54 fucking years.
Um,

348
00:20:23.491 --> 00:20:27.540
San Diego chargers,
1963 53 years since your AFL title,

349
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:32.460
and then the Toronto Maple leafs.
So if we're going to go sport by sport,
uh,

350
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.510
the longest drought and football's the Arizona cardinals baseball is the

351
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.511
Cleveland Indians.

352
00:20:36.511 --> 00:20:41.511
Basketball is the Sacramento Kings in hockey is the Toronto Maple leafs.

353
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.070
There you go.
69 years,
68,
65 at 49.
So there you go.

354
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.913
Toronto

355
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.350
<v 0>Shit.
These other guys,
they got,
they got fucking 20 years on you.</v>

356
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.670
And actually nowadays when there's that many fucking teams,

357
00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:59.560
you want to get 32 teams to go 50 years considering one of them's going to,

358
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:04.000
you know,
when a couple,
two,
three if not four or five over 30 years.
Right.

359
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.400
It's very easy now to go 40 years.

360
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.390
<v 5>Okay.</v>

361
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.520
<v 0>All right,
Bill,
I think we've had enough of the sports talk.
All right,</v>

362
00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:15.900
well maybe I have to,
let's talk about flat top grills,
shall we,

363
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.920
by the way,
I have not called law head yet.
I'm going to wait three days.

364
00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:25.230
I'm going to run and run into him.
I'm going to give him a hug.
You know,

365
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.920
tell him,
you know,
you still got the NBA title,

366
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.850
you've got a little hyped up there.
Oh my God.

367
00:21:32.851 --> 00:21:36.670
The agony j law.
Remember that?
The agony of defeat.

368
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:39.300
Do you remember when the ski jump Guy went off to fucking ski jump?

369
00:21:39.301 --> 00:21:43.110
If you look at j law had his Twitter feed,
dude,
it's fucking hilarious

370
00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.850
because if he's not joking,
he's literally,

371
00:21:46.851 --> 00:21:51.150
he goes off to ski jump like five times every game.
You know,
when,

372
00:21:51.151 --> 00:21:53.930
and he's just laying face down and you're like,
is he dead?
Is he dead?

373
00:21:53.931 --> 00:21:57.590
And then he somehow pops his head up,
shakes his hair out,

374
00:21:57.591 --> 00:22:01.610
he puts the fucking goggles back on and he fucking gradually walks back up the

375
00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:02.444
stairs again.

376
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.230
I'm telling you,
man,
it's,
it's really entertaining.

377
00:22:08.231 --> 00:22:10.030
Anytime there's a big Cleveland game,

378
00:22:10.031 --> 00:22:14.380
I recommend following Jay law had Jason Law head on,

379
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.410
um,
on Twitter.
You know,

380
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.100
just sit back and just watch the fights.
It's tremendous.
It's,

381
00:22:21.101 --> 00:22:25.210
it's an amazing thing.
It's,
it's a great sports book.
Every fog and just,

382
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:27.450
just in tweets.
It's incredible.
All right.
So anyways,

383
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.050
let's talk about a flat top grill.
Everybody.
Oh,
I want to get a flat top grill.

384
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:37.010
Um,
I told you a few weeks ago when,
um,
John Fabulous,
you know,

385
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.250
was shooting some stuff that possibly,
I don't know,

386
00:22:39.251 --> 00:22:41.800
he might do some footage with,
uh,

387
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.740
cooking at his place.

388
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.790
And I went over to the taping mean the lovely Nia and we got to hang out with a

389
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.870
chef Roy Choi who started the whole gourmet food truck thing.
A,

390
00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.150
they cooked on a grill,
which is something I never did.

391
00:22:55.151 --> 00:22:58.240
Even when I worked in a restaurant.
I cooked on a mesquite grill.
I did burgers,

392
00:22:58.241 --> 00:23:02.120
shrimp,
brochette chicken sandwich whenever the fuck you want.
Right.
Um,

393
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.940
but I never worked with uh,
on,
on a griddle before and now,
uh,
I am,

394
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.760
I am so fucking into those things.
It's ridiculous.

395
00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:13.210
And I found this one on the Internet.
I'm not going to tell you the name of it.

396
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.780
Just look up flat top fucking grill.
There's two.

397
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.200
It's not the Blackstone one.
This is like a smaller one.

398
00:23:20.201 --> 00:23:23.500
It's more compact from my little la backyard.

399
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:26.500
And I'm trying to convince my wife to let me get it,
man.
You know,

400
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:30.580
cause we're re we're redoing the kitchen and so we went to go do the stove,

401
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.640
like the one that had the little griddle on it was just going to take up too

402
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.540
much counter space.

403
00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:38.950
We have a small kitchen area and the number one thing was I hated the,

404
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.450
there like no prep area in the kitchen and I hate,
I hated the island.

405
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:49.120
Have ever told you guys how much I hate a fucking island in a kitchen.
I,
I don't,

406
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.620
I don't care if it can fit in my kitchen.
It couldn't fit.

407
00:23:51.621 --> 00:23:55.040
They just put an island in there because it was like the fucking thing to do and

408
00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:58.850
you just walk.
It's like having a fucking hippo that passed out on booze and it,

409
00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.150
you just kind of walk around like the worst fucking thing is whatever you're at

410
00:24:02.151 --> 00:24:05.270
the stove and whatever you need is diagonally across the other side of the

411
00:24:05.271 --> 00:24:07.280
fucking hell.
You've got to walk all around it.
Okay.

412
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.130
Now for all my friends around the world in war torn countries,

413
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.060
this is what she complained about in the United States of America,

414
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.960
that God damn island in your fucking brand new kitchen.
Right.

415
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.590
Sorry.
But anyways,

416
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.910
so we didn't get the griddle and now I'm already kicking myself because we end

417
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:27.860
up going with this stove as six burners.
I'm like,

418
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.720
well there's two of us were like,
what the fuck do I want?

419
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.750
Even when we have Thanksgiving dinner,

420
00:24:32.751 --> 00:24:35.660
I've never had more than three going at a time.

421
00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:36.870
<v 5>Okay.</v>

422
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.060
<v 0>You know what I mean?
You got something in the oven,
you've got something else.</v>

423
00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:43.710
And so you've got two sides,
maybe three sites,
right?
That's it.

424
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.940
You don't need six.
I should have got the fucking Gretel.
But then I saw this,

425
00:24:47.941 --> 00:24:50.460
this attachment that you can get that you put the griddle on top,

426
00:24:50.461 --> 00:24:53.730
but it's not the same cause now you kind of control on the heat with like the

427
00:24:53.731 --> 00:24:57.810
burners.
So what I would do is I put one on simmer,
right or low,

428
00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:00.120
and then the other one I'd cook,
put it up on the cook and heat.

429
00:25:00.121 --> 00:25:03.990
So I can do that whole fucking thing of moving the food around.
You know,

430
00:25:03.991 --> 00:25:06.700
if it's going too fast,
if it needs to chill,
if the,

431
00:25:06.701 --> 00:25:09.210
that the bread's brown and up,
but the cheese hasn't melted yet.

432
00:25:09.211 --> 00:25:12.750
All that shit that I learned.
If,
if Fabro ever puts that shit out,
dude,

433
00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:13.770
I'm telling you,
man,

434
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.660
I learned more goddamn shit about cooking just with that,

435
00:25:18.661 --> 00:25:23.030
controlling the heat and moving it around and actually looking at the stuff I

436
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.780
can't even,
I'm beside myself.

437
00:25:24.781 --> 00:25:28.890
I immediately became 15 to 20% better cook than I was,

438
00:25:28.891 --> 00:25:32.250
which isn't hard because I suck.
But,
um,
anyway,

439
00:25:32.251 --> 00:25:36.240
so I started watching this guy.
You guys got to check this guy out on,
on,

440
00:25:36.241 --> 00:25:37.940
on Youtube.
Um,

441
00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.490
he actually promotes the grill that I wasn't going to get.

442
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.020
It's just a little too big for me,

443
00:25:43.021 --> 00:25:47.580
but it's the Blackstone grill and there's this guy,
uh,

444
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.060
what the fuck does he call himself?

445
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:57.260
He goes by Todd Tovan,
T.
O.
D.
D.
T.
O.
V.
E.
N.

446
00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.980
And m.
What does he call himself?

447
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.950
Although Rocky Mountain meet hunter.

448
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.440
<v 5>Okay.</v>

449
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.080
<v 0>All right.
He's on twitter@rockymountainmeethundred.com.</v>

450
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.840
But you don't need to go to Twitter unless you want to just tell him you like

451
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:16.010
his videos,
but just watch this guy fucking Cook,
you know?
Uh,

452
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:20.090
I know he's hyping all these barbecue sauces and rubs and all that ship a good

453
00:26:20.091 --> 00:26:21.470
fam.
The man's got to make a living,

454
00:26:21.471 --> 00:26:26.240
but the shit that he makes is fucking unbelievable and a too,

455
00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:29.210
when you see this griddle,
there's no fucking way,
just to let you guys know,

456
00:26:29.211 --> 00:26:32.690
they make a smaller one,
um,
that I'm thinking about getting.

457
00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:37.220
But a dude is fucking ridiculous.
He's making fucking cheese steaks.

458
00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:40.610
He's making case of d is he made pizza in this other fucking thing.

459
00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.680
He's toasting up the bonds.
He's got his onions,
peppers go,

460
00:26:43.681 --> 00:26:46.740
and he's got elk on the grill.
Whatever the fuck you want.

461
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:50.580
I actually watched this guy was so inspired by a man in a frying pan.

462
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.190
I took some of that elk that Rogan gave me and I made late at night.
I made a,
um,

463
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.830
sort of my version of an elk cheese steak.

464
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:02.130
I had some peppers and onions going with a little bit of mushroom.
Right.

465
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.880
And then,
uh,
the meat that he gave me is more like hamburger.

466
00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:08.850
So it was more of the consistency of hamburgers.
So I couldn't really lay it in.

467
00:27:08.851 --> 00:27:13.170
I had to kind of poured into the urban,
but it put the,
uh,
you know,
the fucking,

468
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.160
uh,
uh,
the provolone on top.
I don't like the Wiz Dude.

469
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.350
I don't like the Wiz provolone on top.

470
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.650
I could have seasoned the meat a little bit more of just my salt shaker.

471
00:27:22.651 --> 00:27:24.780
I don't know what it is.
I can't see it coming out.
It comes out.

472
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:28.740
So finally I was tasting it and I didn't want to oversalt it,
but I needed to,

473
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.370
I probably should put like,
I don't garlic salt or something like that in there,

474
00:27:32.371 --> 00:27:35.640
but a little cheese on top with the mushrooms and then the peppers.

475
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.770
And then I had the best fucking role ever.

476
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.180
And I made this thing like one in the morning,
you know,

477
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.280
I was coming off from doing my spots and I made it.
And you know,

478
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.570
Nia sitting there going,
what are you,
two days too late?
Oh,

479
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.970
and then I made the thing,
I came walking in and she was like,
what is that?
Right.

480
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:53.730
And I gave her a bite and then of course,
you know she does that fucking shit.

481
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.620
I want one.
I'll look.
Oh it is.
Oh,
she just called and I missed a call.

482
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:02.190
Um,
anyways,

483
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.770
so I am crazy and to doing that.

484
00:28:04.771 --> 00:28:09.600
So I'm thinking about getting that for the backyard.
We'll see.
We'll see.

485
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.230
He's already given me,
you know,
she,
she knows what she's doing.
She just sorta,

486
00:28:13.231 --> 00:28:15.450
you know,
like when you really excited about getting something,

487
00:28:15.451 --> 00:28:18.090
your wife just sort of just,
you know,
it was quiet and nods.

488
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.820
That means they don't want you to get it and they're just waiting for it.

489
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.630
Hoping that your excitement will go away after a couple of days.

490
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:29.190
But I do the same thing to her.
What's up buddy?
You,

491
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.500
you totally know how to work the angles,
don't you cleo?

492
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.680
Sometimes when she wants something rather than coming over and being crazy,

493
00:28:34.681 --> 00:28:38.490
she just comes over and she just put her head on my leg and then just sort of

494
00:28:38.491 --> 00:28:43.440
look at me,
you know,
how do you resist that Cleo kitchen?
Not Thank you.
Come on,

495
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.880
go lay down.
Go lay down.
Go lay down.
Go on.
All right.
Um,

496
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:52.100
maybe read a little bit of advertising here for the week.
Um,

497
00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:57.510
<v 1>oh,
on it.
Speaking to Joe Rogan,
Joe Rogan's company on it.
I'm on.</v>

498
00:28:57.511 --> 00:28:59.010
It has a new product.

499
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.790
It's called a MOLST suffice MCT oil.

500
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:08.090
Mct Oil is one of the fastest sources of clean fuel for the body and the brain.

501
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.280
It's one of the best ways to power up your performance.
A kickstart,

502
00:29:11.281 --> 00:29:16.080
a weight management program.
There are lots of MCT oil brands out there,

503
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.970
but there's none like emulsified MCT oil from Onnit available in three delicious

504
00:29:20.971 --> 00:29:24.240
flavors,
coconut,
Vanilla and strawberry.
As I said,

505
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.540
that's all my three flavors.

506
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:33.230
I got a coconut and vanilla skin and strawberry emulsified MCT oil mixes like a

507
00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:38.770
cream easily in your morning.
Coffee without the need for a blender.

508
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:43.570
No mess.
No,
you can even mix it right into your favorite foods right now.

509
00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:46.300
If you go to onnit.com/bill you can get on,

510
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:49.420
it's emulsified MCT oil for 12% off.

511
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:54.420
That's o n n I t.com/bill to get emulsified MCT oil for 12% off.

512
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.600
And for any reason,
if you don't like it,
they'll give you your money back.

513
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.210
No questions asked.
No biggie.
You got nothing to lose.

514
00:30:01.211 --> 00:30:05.260
Go to onnit.com/bill and get on it.
All right.

515
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:09.510
[inaudible] Ltd genes.
Jesus Christ,
uh,

516
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:15.160
Delta Sierra Lima,
Tango,
Delta genes.

517
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.500
The problem with jeans is that they're really,

518
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.440
that the really good pairs cost two to $300.
Isn't that the truth?

519
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:24.190
Easily in the bargain brands just fall apart.
It look terrible.
That's also true.

520
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:28.420
So you,
they have no money,
right?
Or,
uh,
you know,

521
00:30:28.421 --> 00:30:31.150
your ass is hanging out with people.
Beat the shit out of you.
I mean that,

522
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.010
those are your two options.
You know,
unless you're,
you,

523
00:30:34.011 --> 00:30:37.240
I know you're one of those fucking son's of a Saudi Arabian prince,
right?

524
00:30:37.241 --> 00:30:39.970
And you just rolling barrels oil down the fucking stairs every morning.

525
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:44.890
Dst LD pronounced distilled.
I didn't know that actually I did,

526
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:45.730
but I forgot.

527
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:49.900
Has revolutionized the fashion industry by creating timeless luxury grade denim,

528
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:54.340
so you get genes that would cost you hundreds of dollars starting at just $65

529
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.910
this was my question.
How do they do it?
Let's see how they do it.

530
00:30:57.911 --> 00:31:01.330
By refusing to work with department stores in retail middlemen,

531
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:05.200
there's no markup,
no bullshit,
just Greg chains at an unbelievable price.

532
00:31:05.201 --> 00:31:09.880
Just go to distill.com spelled DST LD,
Delta,
Sierra,
tango,
Lima,

533
00:31:09.881 --> 00:31:13.930
delta.com find the perfect pair with the perfect fit.

534
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.630
They'll ship them to you for free and guarantee the fit.

535
00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:21.340
Or we'll send you a new pair till they are perfect or it doesn't say they'll

536
00:31:21.341 --> 00:31:21.941
take it back.

537
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:23.800
They'll just keep shipping you and you ain't getting your money back.

538
00:31:23.801 --> 00:31:26.080
You're going to get more jeans.
See for yourself.

539
00:31:26.081 --> 00:31:31.030
Why a list celebrities have been spotted and magazines like vogue and Gq wearing

540
00:31:31.031 --> 00:31:33.250
distilled jeans while you're fucking paid them too.

541
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:39.190
If you just spot them out back,
you know,
making a fucking hotdog without the bun.

542
00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:43.120
Of course they got to keep the abs there.
Even c list celebrities like me,

543
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.010
I don't like how they made me trash myself.

544
00:31:45.011 --> 00:31:49.150
I will do the trashing of me and I'm a c plus celebrity.

545
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:52.600
I got a cartoon on Netflix that makes me see,

546
00:31:52.601 --> 00:31:56.410
plus I got a pair of raw denim and it,
the fit is amazing.

547
00:31:56.411 --> 00:31:58.840
You know what's funny about this?
I have not gotten that yet.

548
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.460
You know my fucking producer on the show he's wearing and he said they're

549
00:32:03.461 --> 00:32:07.660
fucking unbelievable and he wears them all the time.
All right,
so I never,

550
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.240
you know,
I got too much shit in my house.
So whenever these advertisers say,

551
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:12.040
we'll send you some stuff,
like I never take it,

552
00:32:12.041 --> 00:32:14.410
but he's wearing them now and he's been raving about them so much.

553
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.920
Now I want a fucking pair.
And that's how it works.
That's how America works.

554

That's how you defeat isis.

555
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:23.230

557
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:32.290

Why won't you let your friends know what's going on and y'all get a crate?

573
00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:35.000

Hey,
I like your wonder woman outfit.

577
00:33:43.731 --> 00:33:47.390
Well thank you.
I like your Flash Gordon fucking wig.

578
00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:52.610
I'm on a quest for epic gear,
housewares and collectibles.

579
00:33:52.611 --> 00:33:54.380
Is that what you want to do?
Well,
loot crate has it.

580
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:59.380
Loot crate offers an epic range of pop culture items for less than $20 a month.

581
00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:03.200
Uh,
if you're a more of a fan fanatical,

582
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.980
I just want to know if they wonder woman's fucking drawers,

583
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.450
if one of those nerds,
they can put it on their fucking,

584
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:13.010
they can sleep next to it,
you know,
sniffing her and visible pussy.
Well,

585
00:34:13.011 --> 00:34:15.470
she's done invisible issue her is,

586
00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:21.470
it never made any sense.
Um,
if you're more of a fantastic,
but you can still,

587
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.500
every community did that big and still see her.
She should be invisible in it.

588
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:29.490
But then just for animation purposes,
then you'd have to be like,
you know,
well,

589
00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:34.010
where is it would just showing clouds going by.
You know what's funny,

590
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.180
like this is probably like a 40 minute argument in the writer's room at Hannah

591
00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:41.270
Barbera,
one of those fucking places a long time ago.
Back to the advertising.

592
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:42.860

fantastic beasts and where to find them.

603
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.010
Sorry.
They just ended and then it went to the next sentence,

604
00:35:22.011 --> 00:35:24.890
but there was a gap there.
A big trouble in little China.

605
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:27.320
I love that movie and so much more.
Do not wait.

Hang.
Well,
how much time is left me?

612
00:35:50.311 --> 00:35:53.160
They'll fuck around a little more and then I'll read the last of these.

613
00:35:53.161 --> 00:35:57.720
All right,
we'll fuck around a little more.
Um,
all right.

614
00:35:57.721 --> 00:36:00.600
What did I want to talk about?
Oh,
fucking who's playing this week?

615
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.510
Who's playing this week in college football?
Anything?

616
00:36:03.511 --> 00:36:07.170
Do I actually have anything else that I want to talk about other than the fact

617
00:36:07.171 --> 00:36:10.050
that I liked making Hash Brown snuff.
Oh boy.

618
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:13.320
I tell you guys how much I enjoy making fucking Hash and take your breakfast to

619
00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:18.180
the next level with the griddle.
Make it some.
Fuck that.
You know something.

620
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.230
If he is ever just want to shut people the fuck up,
just make some hash browns.

621
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.540
Start them off.
The cheesy ones,

622
00:36:24.541 --> 00:36:28.770
and then you bake them in the oven and just shut everybody the fuck up.

623
00:36:28.771 --> 00:36:33.000
If you want to shut me the fuck up.
That's basically what you can do.
Hey,

624
00:36:33.001 --> 00:36:36.990
shout out to Steve Bartman everybody.
Hey Dude,
stay in hiding,
man.
Don't,

625
00:36:36.991 --> 00:36:38.880
don't let those cons draw you back out.
All right?

626
00:36:38.881 --> 00:36:42.390
They had the chance to be friends with a great person like you.
All right?

627
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:46.210
You know they're going to try to ask you to go to the parade,
you know?
Oh,

628
00:36:46.211 --> 00:36:49.530
all is forgiven.
All is forgiven.
You know,

629
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.870
it was just fucking 13 years of health.
Um,

630
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.970
do you guys think he goes,
do you think he goes back?
I don't think he does.

631
00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:00.270
He said no to 30 for 30 kind of.
Seems like he would just,
he,
you know,

632
00:37:00.271 --> 00:37:01.530
he's a very commendable person.

633
00:37:01.531 --> 00:37:06.360
He was somebody that has no desire for fame in this century,
which is a,
you know,

634
00:37:06.361 --> 00:37:09.870
more than I can say for myself in 90% of the other people out there.

635
00:37:09.871 --> 00:37:12.250
So God bless them.
All right.
Actually,

636
00:37:12.251 --> 00:37:15.390
I have one questionnaire usually don't read questions on the Thursday afternoon

637
00:37:15.391 --> 00:37:20.250
podcasts.
All right.
Tom Steele.
Yo Billy Ginger tits.
Yes,

638
00:37:20.251 --> 00:37:23.100
I did enjoy the two hour podcasts,
but you're wrong about one thing.

639
00:37:23.101 --> 00:37:27.150
It's not illegal for women to show their titties or even go topless in most of

640
00:37:27.151 --> 00:37:29.610
the United States.
I didn't know that.
In fact,

641
00:37:29.611 --> 00:37:34.470
33 states have laws specifically allowing it.
However,
certain towns,

642
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.011
cities,

643
00:37:35.011 --> 00:37:40.011
and municipal areas within each of these states prohibits to practice a sighting

644
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:43.080
disturbing the peace as a misdemeanor,

645
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.950
as interpreted by law enforcement sometimes incorrectly.

646
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.630
Uh,
if you're digging it,
okay.
I,
I,
this is the deal dude.

647
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.530
Like I guess,
you know,
in Africa and some of these other countries,

648
00:37:55.531 --> 00:37:56.970
they walk around with their titties out.

649
00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:00.360
I guess people don't give a shit about it.
It's like not a big deal.

650
00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:02.850
They get used to it like seeing a woman's legs or whatever.

651
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.000
If women want to do this shit,
I've come full circle.
Fuck it.

652
00:38:06.001 --> 00:38:07.980
You want to walk around with the Goddamn titties out?

653
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:10.170
I don't know why you'd want to,
I gotta be honest with you.

654
00:38:10.171 --> 00:38:12.300
Most men should not be walking around with his shirt off.

655
00:38:12.301 --> 00:38:14.940
Like this should be a rule.
Okay.
You want to have your shirt off.

656
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:16.740
Either you're at the beach,

657
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:20.820
you're in your own backyard or you're working on a chain gang fucking digging a

658
00:38:20.821 --> 00:38:22.350
trench in the side of the road.
Okay.

659
00:38:22.351 --> 00:38:25.140
If you're actually working for a fucking live and you want to take your goddamn

660
00:38:25.141 --> 00:38:29.670
shirt off and risk skin cancer,
by all means do it.
Okay?
Believe me,

661
00:38:29.671 --> 00:38:31.200
there's a lot of guys with their shirts out there.

662
00:38:31.201 --> 00:38:34.380
They've got big tits than most of the women out there.
So,
um,

663
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.390
I just think it's a funny thing that like,

664
00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:38.870
<v 4>yeah,</v>

665
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:43.310
<v 1>I just don't understand why women were just like,
why can't we do it?
They just,</v>

666
00:38:43.311 --> 00:38:43.580
they,

667
00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.030
they just have that fee maybe cause it's the position they are in society the

668
00:38:47.031 --> 00:38:52.031
way men kept them down for so fucking long that every last fucking thing that we

669
00:38:52.041 --> 00:38:56.150
do,
they want to do regardless of how fucking stupid it is.

670
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:58.520
<v 4>You know what I mean?</v>

671
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.660
<v 1>Who Fuck wants to walk around with their shirt off.</v>

672
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:03.850
<v 4>Okay.</v>

673
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:07.220
<v 1>Matthew mcconaughey,
people like that.
People don't like p nine zero x shape,</v>

674
00:39:07.221 --> 00:39:09.970
like walking around without this shirt.
How,
which makes sense.
She did the work.

675
00:39:09.971 --> 00:39:13.930
God bless you.
I've never had a desire to walk around with my fucking shirt off.

676
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.040
Yeah.
Why would you be half?
Especially past a certain age,

677
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.700
you got to start covering up 48 fucking years old.

678
00:39:25.701 --> 00:39:29.240
You don't want to see a half naked anything.
There's a few out there.

679
00:39:29.241 --> 00:39:31.760
Madonna kept herself in great shape.
You know what I mean?

680
00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:36.200
There's a few people out there.
They've kept themselves,
you know,

681
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.550
and in phenomenal shape.
They can take their fucking shirts up.

682
00:39:39.551 --> 00:39:43.970
But for the most part,
most people by 23,
24,
by all means,
man.
A man,
a woman,

683
00:39:43.971 --> 00:39:44.960
keep the fucking shirt on.

684
00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:46.840
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

685
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.030
<v 1>I don't know.
That's just one of those things.
I don't know.
I mean,</v>

686
00:39:49.031 --> 00:39:52.000
it's like listening to somebody complain about the island in their kitchen.

687
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:56.020
It's just like,
don't you have anything better to focus on?
All right.

688
00:39:56.021 --> 00:40:00.040
The hypocrite continues.
Um,
so I guess,
uh,
let's see.

689
00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:03.100
Claiming equal topless rights for men and women go topless.

690
00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:06.040
There's something here.
Uh,

691
00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:10.090
go topless claims that women have the same constitutional right,

692
00:40:10.091 --> 00:40:13.510
that men have to go bare chested and public.
Uh,

693
00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:16.690
I'd really disagree with that to try to say like,

694
00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:20.530
our titties are the same as your titties might my titties can't get me around a

695
00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:21.610
drinks.
You know what I mean?

696
00:40:21.611 --> 00:40:26.380
If I show half a fucking man peck hair that doesn't get me anything,

697
00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.850
or maybe I'm just in the wrong bars,
maybe I need to go into a gay bar there too.

698
00:40:30.851 --> 00:40:32.260
That's a great youtube video.

699
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.910
Go into a gay bar and dress like a man or and see how long you can drink for

700
00:40:36.911 --> 00:40:37.744
free.

701
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.620
There would be fucking hilarious.
Then at the end of the night,
the guy's like,

702
00:40:45.621 --> 00:40:47.570
hey man,
see,
you want to get out of here?
Be like,
yeah,

703
00:40:47.571 --> 00:40:49.160
but I'm not going home with you and be like,
dude,

704
00:40:49.161 --> 00:40:53.500
what the fuck about show his drinks?
We were like,
yeah,
well,
I'm straight.
Well,

705
00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:56.200
what the fuck are you doing here?
I just want,
I wanted to drink for free.

706
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.820
Then he goes to swing.
You just go,
no,
me.
Right,

707
00:41:00.821 --> 00:41:05.821
and you get out of their drinking a bunch of Budweiser's simply safe.

708
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.870
It's crazy what engineers are coming up with these days.

709
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:15.360
The engineer invented the simply safe home security system was attending Harvard

710
00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.150
University.
When his friends got robbed,
he wanted to help them out.

711
00:41:18.151 --> 00:41:20.280
So they started shopping around for home security.

712
00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:23.280
But all the security companies at the time were just awful.

713
00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:24.600
They'd sell these clunky,

714
00:41:24.601 --> 00:41:28.620
expensive systems that required all sorts of drilling to install and to get
them,

715
00:41:28.621 --> 00:41:32.820
you had to sign it.
Huge longterm contract.
That's what I did.
So this guy,

716
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.200
simply safe to try and fix all the problems with the security industry.

717
00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:40.100
Simply safe is wireless.
There's no drilling.

718
00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.530
I did all of this to my house.

719
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.250
You don't have to put a bunch of holes in your walls to keep your family safe.

720
00:41:46.251 --> 00:41:51.090
Got dammit.
This is why.
Why buy anything?

721
00:41:51.091 --> 00:41:54.750
Because then they always come up.
Oh,
just hovers in the fucking air.
Anyway.

722
00:41:54.751 --> 00:41:59.160
Simply safe is wireless.
All right.
Um,

723
00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.130
there's no longterm contract.
You don't have to pay for something.

724
00:42:02.131 --> 00:42:05.850
You're not using 24,
seven monitoring.
It's just 1499 a month.

725
00:42:05.851 --> 00:42:10.320
That's three times less than other security companies.
Fucking cock suckers.

<v 1>No,
Jesus.
Well,</v>

733
00:42:30.261 --> 00:42:33.380
what do I feel like everything in my house is the technological equipment of a

734
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:35.180
fucking laserdisc player.

735
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:38.910
I'm going to look into those guys and see what the fucking deal is.
All right.

736
00:42:38.911 --> 00:42:40.490
Seek everybody.
This is the last thing.

737
00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:45.491
Buying tickets online for sports and concerts has been a confusing process for a

738
00:42:45.711 --> 00:42:47.120
long,
long time.

739
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.860
It's always been hard to find the best deal for that game or show you want to go

740
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:56.600
to and none of those older tickets sites want to charge that.
Change that sorry,

741
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:57.950
but seek is different.

742
00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:01.220
They've come along and created an amazing APP and website that makes it easier

743
00:43:01.221 --> 00:43:04.190

744
00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:08.300

745

760
00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.230
Micah dawn says to Cleveland fans,
you did get the calves this year.
Uh,

761
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:11.360
you do have Terry Francona,
you've got great players and uh,
yeah,
I mean,

762
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:12.890
I dunno,

763
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:16.820
we won one with Manny Ramirez and everybody else to so many like the Phillies,

764
00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:18.590
Yankee fans,
red sox fans,

765
00:44:18.591 --> 00:44:22.580
all should have been rooting for Cleveland because we all use your fucking CCS,

766
00:44:22.581 --> 00:44:24.760
your Manny Ramirez,
your Jim Tommy's.

767
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:28.130
We all use those guys to get our championships and uh,

768
00:44:28.131 --> 00:44:31.650
also that Petrou fucking pitch for everyone and forgot his fucking name wasn't

769
00:44:31.651 --> 00:44:36.390
curt Floyd.
Was it Cleo?
How's it?
Can I get a whole of here before we go?

770
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:39.090
That's kind of the sign off now.
Hey Cleo,

771
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:42.840
you want to go outside?

772
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:45.283
<v 5>Okay.</v>

773
00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:48.770

No jumping.
Cleo.</v>

774
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:53.210

775
00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:01.590
to you.
Oh,

She just got up.

776
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:05.240
Come on.
Come on you guys.
You know your commute is long enough.

777
00:45:05.241 --> 00:45:08.510

778

780
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:26.323

782
00:45:35.231 --> 00:45:37.990
Congratulations to the cubs.
My consultants is the Cleveland Indians and I'll,

I'll see you on Monday.
Have a great weekend.
You can listen to.

784
00:45:40.601 --> 00:45:44.080
These are greatest sets after this music.
Oh,
Jesus.

785
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:50.063
<v 5>Okay,</v>

786
00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:54.620
well the dust.

787
00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.160
Hey,
what's going on?
It's still Ba.
It is

788
00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:37.280
<v 6>Monday morning podcast for Monday,
October 27th,</v>

789
00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.470
2008 and the Year of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Uh,

790
00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.520
what is this,
the year four?
Are you Catholic?
What do we do?

791
00:46:46.521 --> 00:46:50.030
I know that the Chinese people,
he always got,
you know,
the year of the Yak.

792
00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:55.640
And why is it,
that's always my default animal Yak.
It's just funny.
I'm sorry.

793
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:58.490
I don't even,
what the fuck it is.
What is a Yak?

794
00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:01.060
That's your homework for this week.
If you're a regular listener,

795
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:04.700
let me know what a Yak is and what,
where are they indigenous to?

796
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:08.620
Okay,
I'm going to go out on a limb and I'm going to say,
uh,

797
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:12.600
I'm going to say Scotland.
I don't think there's any JAKKS over here.

798
00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.190
The raw JAKKS over here,
they were brought here against their will.

799
00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:19.190
Much like those people from Africa.
And you know,

800
00:47:19.191 --> 00:47:24.120
I think it's high time that they made an Omnistar for fucking JAKKS.
You know,

801
00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:28.100
what about all the livestock?
What about the fucking Dodo Bird?
You know,

802
00:47:28.101 --> 00:47:30.520
what about the,
the fucking lamaze here.

803
00:47:30.521 --> 00:47:33.580
We just shouldn't be in the middle of nowhere and somebody has a fucking Lama,

804
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.120
you know,
how did it get there?
That thing doesn't have a story.

805
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:39.910
That thing doesn't it need to go,
you know,

806
00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:44.170
check out his family tree and figuring out where the fuck it came from.

807
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.960
What the hell was I?
I was in,
no,
I was in Richmond,

808
00:47:49.961 --> 00:47:54.961
Virginia and I'm driving down the street with the guy who works over there,

809
00:47:55.660 --> 00:48:00.550
buzz with one Z who was one of my favorite people in comedy.

810
00:48:00.551 --> 00:48:05.170
The guys literally 60 years old and he's still hits on like 22 year olds and he

811
00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:08.410
creeps them out every time he does it and he doesn't give a shit.

812
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:12.460
And uh,
you know,
I've got to respect them for that.
But anyways,

813
00:48:12.461 --> 00:48:14.290
we're driving in the radio station and there,

814
00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:17.920
there's a fucking Lama in the middle of Richmond,
Virginia.

815
00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.650
And uh,
you know,

816
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:26.590
I really wanted to know why.
You know,

817
00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.780
what exactly,
what do people do with llamas?

818
00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:32.380
They would tell you guys that I love goats if ever told you that shit.

819
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:36.610
Like the goat is the perfect pet for me because I have,

820
00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.210
I like to fuck and I have a tendency to fuck with animals.
You know what I mean?

821
00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:44.680
I fuck with people and it doesn't stop there.
You know,
I don't know what it is.

822
00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:48.850
I started playing with the puppy and then eventually I roll him over on his
back.

823
00:48:48.851 --> 00:48:53.050
I semi sorta hold him down,
which gets him all fucking,
uh,

824
00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:57.610
you know,
all aggressive.
And next thing you know,

825
00:48:57.611 --> 00:49:01.210
they take a bite out of my hand,
you know,
take a chunk out of me.

826
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:04.170
So that's why I don't have a fucking dog because I turned them into a,

827
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.240
those dogs you see on the news that need to get put down.

828
00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:13.090
So I found goats actually enjoy that shit.
Then when you look in,

829
00:49:13.091 --> 00:49:17.020
you know,
when you're,
when you're looking the other way,
I'd go to take a run at.

830
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:22.030
Yes.
You know,
they're like a dirty player and uh,
it was,

831
00:49:22.031 --> 00:49:25.660
it was a classic dirty player from way back in the fucking day.

832
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.980
I even Chris [inaudible] and Chris Island,
you know,
he would do some shit.
He did.

833
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.590
Rick Milton in the mouth with is the butt end of his stick.

834
00:49:32.591 --> 00:49:34.930
That's kind of a dirty,
but I know he was never really into boarding.

835
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.020
I'll Samuelson.
That's what it goes.

836
00:49:38.021 --> 00:49:42.430
Is that the goal is the all Samuelson a fucking farm animals.

837
00:49:42.431 --> 00:49:45.370
Every time you got your head down and you're facing the bar and the thing,

838
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:46.360
I'll take a run at ya.

839
00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:50.200
And the problem is it never gets suspended from the league.
All right.

840
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:53.080
This is the Monday morning podcast.
My name is bill burr.

841
00:49:53.081 --> 00:49:57.760
I mentioned that earlier.
And uh,
currently I am in the midst of the uh,

842
00:49:57.761 --> 00:50:02.410
the uninformed a radio tour,
which a is uninformed,

843
00:50:02.411 --> 00:50:05.830
the radio show I do with Joe to Rosa and the two of us around on tour right now

844
00:50:05.831 --> 00:50:10.660
to hype the show and things are going great.
And our next stop is going to be in,

845
00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:15.670
uh,
Washington DC.
The weekend of,
uh,
you know what,

846
00:50:15.671 --> 00:50:17.110
I don't know what fucking weekend it is.

847
00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:18.880
I think it's the first weekend in November.

848
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:23.860
Let me go here and go on to my new fancy website.
If you guys checked it out yet.

849
00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:28.050
If you're not on my website right now and you're on my myspace page,
you know,

850
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.830
don't do it now cause you lose the fucking podcast.
But at the end of it,

851
00:50:30.831 --> 00:50:33.180
go to [inaudible] dot com and a,

852
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:37.410
it's a brand new sleep website with a bunch of sexy photos of me,
um,

853
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:40.570
that make me look like I'm a lot cooler than I am.
All right.

854
00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:42.320
November 6th through the eighth,

855
00:50:42.321 --> 00:50:45.380
I'll be at the Improv in Washington DC on the uninformed tour,

856
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:49.270
me and Joe to Rosa and on,
uh,

857
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.530
the 11th November or sorry,

858
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.190
November 13th through the 15th,

859
00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:00.110
we'll be at Zany comedy club in Nashville,
Tennessee.
And uh,

860
00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:03.920
the next big data after that is going to be a Caroline's in New York City,

861
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.370
uh,
December 4th through the seventh.

862
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:11.600
And if anybody cares on December 8th,
I will be at the La Forum.

863
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:15.920
Am I going to be doing stand up?
No,
I'm not.
I'll be watching ACDC.

864
00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:20.870
ACDC at the La Forum.
Did I tell you guys my pumpkin died?

865
00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.900
My pumpkin?
I mean technically,
I don't know.
Well,
when does a Pumpkin Pie,

866
00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:31.370
this is going to get like the pro life pro choice pumpkin people up in uh,

867
00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:35.420
up in an uproar here when,
when exactly does a Pumpkin,

868
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:40.550
like what,
what's going,
you know,
that's just so much shit I don't know in life.

869
00:51:40.551 --> 00:51:44.900
Is this stem was that was that it's fucking umbilical cord and you set it free.

870
00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:48.260
Now it goes off to live a life and hopefully not marry the wrong person,

871
00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:49.191
you know,

872
00:51:49.191 --> 00:51:53.620
and get divorced and end up on a Fuckin futon or the second you snip that the

873
00:51:53.621 --> 00:51:58.100
does is the function.
The function is the fucking pumpkin dead.
The function.

874
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.470
It's a good name for a band.

875
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.840
Come up on stage playing fucking P funk with Pumpkin's on your heads.

876
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:08.580
And you know,
if he had a catch phrase,

877
00:52:08.581 --> 00:52:12.740
you could be a huge comedian and you could play the La Forum.
Now,
seriously,

878
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:15.530
this is what I learned with Pumpkins.
All right?

879
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:20.060
Don't call him three weeks before because they die in your refrigerator and it

880
00:52:20.061 --> 00:52:24.470
makes you sad and you got to throw them out and nobody even got to see him.
So,

881
00:52:24.471 --> 00:52:28.160
uh,
so I got to make another one.
I have to make another one.
You know what?

882
00:52:28.161 --> 00:52:31.040
This is just classic me and my fucking podcast.

883
00:52:31.041 --> 00:52:34.580
I started talking about some shit and I forgot where the fuck I was going.

884
00:52:34.581 --> 00:52:38.960
And now here I am.
Here I am pulled over the side of the road,

885
00:52:38.961 --> 00:52:42.790
looking at the map,
trying to figure out,
all right,
let's go to the questions.
Uh,

886
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:47.690
you're new to my podcast.
Um,
I do,
uh,
answer questions every week.

887
00:52:47.691 --> 00:52:48.620
People email me,

888
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:53.650
they email me at bill at [inaudible] dot com or they go to my myspace page and I

889
00:52:53.931 --> 00:52:58.310
try to answer as many as I can.
And,
um,
you know,

890
00:52:58.311 --> 00:53:02.270
people try to enlighten me like a,
you know,
what is a Yak?

891
00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.880
You know,
what does a Yak?

892
00:53:04.881 --> 00:53:09.080
Is that like a fucking druggie cow with its hippie hair?

893
00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:12.260
You don't want to fucking Google a fucking Yak right now.

894
00:53:12.261 --> 00:53:15.590
And I'm looking at the image.
How do you spell yak?

895
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:19.490
It's not why a c k that means you puked.
Speaking of which two,

896
00:53:19.491 --> 00:53:23.390
you know when I was looking at all the different pumpkin pictures,

897
00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:27.270
you know ideas for Pumpkin.
That one where you,

898
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.710
where you carve a pumpkin faced with its mouth open and then you take the inside

899
00:53:31.711 --> 00:53:35.640
of the Pumpkin and place it around the mouth and it looks like it puked is very

900
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:38.870
hacky.
They must've been 80 pumpkin's like that,

901
00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:44.850
that Jesus Christ.
Look at that.
That's a fucking Yak.

902
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:51.180
Wow.
Okay.
It's got some Ma don't fuck with me.
Horns.

903
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:56.040
Looks like a,
looks like a Texas longhorn that needs a haircut.

904
00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:02.010
He is a Guy Melkin one.
I was that a woman.
Hang on a second.

905
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:06.030
Yak uses.
You guys want to learn about JAKKS.
Here we go.

906
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:10.770
Statue of Golden Jakks in downtown Tibet.
Exactly

907
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:14.580
the fuck are JAKKS doing over here.

908
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:20.100
The YAC is truly the treasure of the plateau.
Well,

909
00:54:20.101 --> 00:54:21.600
why don't you let me be the judge of it.

910
00:54:21.601 --> 00:54:24.270
I hate when people make up my mind for me.
All right.

911
00:54:24.271 --> 00:54:27.870
Evidently this Douche bag says it's the treasure of the plateau.
Well,

912
00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:32.130
what is its competition?
I'm the gopher.
All right.

913
00:54:32.131 --> 00:54:33.870
As the inscription reads below,

914
00:54:33.871 --> 00:54:37.920
the Golden Statue of Jakks is in a busy intersection in downtown La,

915
00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:39.900
Hoffa in the mountain,

916
00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:43.380
Tundra and ice desert of the Tibetan plateau with altitude,

917
00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.900
altitude soaring over 19,000 feet.

918
00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:51.320
Jakks flourish where other domestic DCE die because of this.

919
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:55.560
People inhabiting this region use the Yag for everything.

920
00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:59.250
Okay.
That's an open ended sentence.
Okay.

921
00:54:59.251 --> 00:55:03.720
So they obviously use it as a food source.
There's a girl milking one,

922
00:55:03.721 --> 00:55:08.430
some to Ben Lady and uh,
they use it for everything.

923
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:09.180
Okay.
Uh,

924
00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:13.170
you lifting the tail up and doing something disgusting that's on Youtube or is

925
00:55:13.171 --> 00:55:16.920
it more tube eight?
The AKC is in escapable in La Hasa.

926
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:18.681
The acrid,

927
00:55:18.681 --> 00:55:23.550
slightly sour smell of yak butter permeates the streets.

928
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:26.730
Okay.
I guess I'll never be going to lots of,

929
00:55:26.731 --> 00:55:31.731
who the fuck wants to smell sour butter at 19,000 feet?

930
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:33.631
I,
you know,

931
00:55:33.631 --> 00:55:37.740
something I would not be able to keep the look of disgust off my face.

932
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:41.310
And then they all start speaking in Tibet and thinking that I was some American

933
00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:44.430
who thought they were above people rather than,
dude,

934
00:55:44.431 --> 00:55:49.431
there's a fucking pungent smell you over at pungent into the mainstream was will

935
00:55:49.561 --> 00:55:53.420
Ferrell in a anchorman.

936
00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:59.340
Pungent stings the nostrils.
Um,
all right,

937
00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:00.430
so it's,

938
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:05.430
it permeates the streets and temples where pilgrims burn the whitish yellow fat

939
00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:11.010
and innumerable altars and carry smoking candles through the streets.

940
00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:17.160
You have me just think a live in like death.
It was lady milk at a Yak,

941
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.001
no laptop,

942
00:56:18.001 --> 00:56:22.660
no iPhone dress like an Apache everyday.

943
00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:26.710
Just reach underneath some fucking Jakks UTR.
And then you go,

944
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:30.610
you don't have to go down to,
uh,
go down and get a smoothie.

945
00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:37.110
Yak Milk is golden in color and very rich and fat at 70 to 80%.

946
00:56:37.111 --> 00:56:40.870
And why the fuck is she so skinny and as a Swedish taste?

947
00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:45.280
Then why did you just describe it?
You know,
you know what?
Fuck this website.

948
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:51.070
He said sour smell and now you're saying it's a sour smell with a Swedish taste.

949
00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:55.060
Maybe that's why their eyes are so squinty.
It's not because their eyes.

950
00:56:55.061 --> 00:56:58.210
I like that because it confused is there.
It doesn't make sense.
You know,

951
00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.780
it's not sour that they fell asleep.
No.

952
00:57:01.781 --> 00:57:06.450
Protection from Jakks is seasonal hybrid JAKKS oh good.
Okay.

953
00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:10.050
Everybody's on the global warming and I want to,
I want to far to,

954
00:57:10.051 --> 00:57:14.770
they have like 90% less.
Uh,
uh,
goddamn.
It's on the tip of my tongue.

955
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:18.400
What the fuck kind of gas is in cow's gas

956
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:24.730
against with an m methane.
Maybe JAKKS have less methane gas.

957
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:28.690
Is that the green people?
They're going to do that.
Eat a Yak Burger instead.

958
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:34.090
All right.
I think I'm sick of yaks at this point.
You guys take a good,
you know,

959
00:57:34.091 --> 00:57:38.380
and I felt that you were like,
all right,
bill enough with the fucking JAKKS.
Um,

960
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:38.990
so anyway,

961
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:42.730
they're in Tibet and next time I do a road gig and like fucking Austin or

962
00:57:42.731 --> 00:57:45.280
something,
I swear to God on a drive by and be like,
what the fuck is that?

963
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.380
And some guy names,
you know,

964
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:51.610
fuck with oneF is going to be like a,
that's a Yak.

965
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.830
What is it doing here?
I don't know.
Body.
I don't know about you.

966
00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.620
I'll just take you the radio station.

967
00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:58.780
Why don't you just focus on that being funny.

968
00:57:58.870 --> 00:58:01.600
It's spelled sell some more fucking tickets.
You know what I mean?

969
00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:05.230
How many fucking specialty you need to have before he can fill up a fucking

970
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:07.480
comedy club?
Why don't you get a catch phrase?

971
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.690
Why don't you just go on stage and just talk about JAKKS for fucking hour and

972
00:58:10.691 --> 00:58:13.690
then you can be the fucking Yak guy and I wouldn't have to drive you to the

973
00:58:13.691 --> 00:58:16.600
fucking radio station because you would have sold out second.

974
00:58:16.601 --> 00:58:17.890
They put your fucking name up.

975
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.310
You ever think about that will then shut the fuck up then.
Okay.

976
00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:24.310
Um,
all right,

977
00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:28.750
so let's get on with the podcast questions.
Hey Bill,

978
00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:33.250
have you ever auditioned for SNL when you lived in New York City?

979
00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:36.400
That group seems to be clickish,

980
00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:40.150
but I wondered if Lauren Michaels ever gave you a chance to be on the show.

981
00:58:40.151 --> 00:58:44.710
You know what?
I can't remember if I auditioned for a SNL or mad TV,

982
00:58:44.711 --> 00:58:48.760
but it was about nine years ago and I know I bombed because I went in there with

983
00:58:48.761 --> 00:58:52.050
jokes rather than characters I had.

984
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.670
I would have like a quick care,

985
00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:58.570
I'd have a character and then just do a quick joke about them and then move on

986
00:58:58.571 --> 00:59:01.810
to something else.
Like I remember one of my characters,

987
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:06.010
I played a guy who was in the Klan who had a speech impediment.

988
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:11.490
He gets blocked on Edwards and I just remember part of the audition and me

989
00:59:11.501 --> 00:59:11.981
staying there,

990
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:16.300
going new noon to noon and then that just sort of ended and everyone was looking

991
00:59:16.301 --> 00:59:20.800
at me like I had fucking 12 heads.
So,
uh,
yeah,

992
00:59:20.801 --> 00:59:25.100
I mean don't think the reason why I'm not on SNL is because it's clickish.

993
00:59:25.101 --> 00:59:29.360
It's probably because Lauren has watched that tape at some point and projectile

994
00:59:29.361 --> 00:59:31.550
vomited.
All right,
go.

995
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:36.020
Me and a friend at work run a celebrity death pool.

996
00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:40.580
If you don't know what this is,
here it is in a nutshell.
You put an x,

997
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:45.640
you put x amount of a month and then you get a list of randomly picked potential

998
00:59:46.371 --> 00:59:50.330
people who may die very soon.
You know what I noticed?
Celebrity depth full is,

999
00:59:50.331 --> 00:59:54.130
and you didn't really describe it.
Well,
basically you a,

1000
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:58.130
you pick not random people.
You pick,
you pick random celebrities,

1001
00:59:58.131 --> 01:00:00.500
famous people who you think are going to die.

1002
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:02.480
I thought it was in a calendar year.

1003
01:00:02.481 --> 01:00:05.990
I guess they do it every month because these guys have a gambling promise that

1004
01:00:05.991 --> 01:00:07.460
basically you'd be like,
you know what?

1005
01:00:07.461 --> 01:00:12.461
I think a fucking Lisa Lu c or whatever the fuck her name is,

1006
01:00:12.531 --> 01:00:14.540
Lucy Lu.
I think she's going to uh,

1007
01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:18.450
eat some bad Sushi and a,
yeah,

1008
01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:20.720
it's we filming over in Japan and what's,

1009
01:00:20.721 --> 01:00:22.880
what's that Sushi that they eat over there?
Some sort of,

1010
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:25.250
if you eat the wrong part of it,
you could fucking die.

1011
01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.970
And there's some macho thing to eat it.
She's going to go do that,
you know,

1012
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:32.630
to prove she's one of the guys and she hangs out with the crew when she's going

1013
01:00:32.631 --> 01:00:34.670
to die like that.
That's what you would do.
All right.

1014
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.620
The payout happens only when cnn.com announces it.
Oh,
this is the,
their rules.

1015
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:41.120
Okay.
I'm back to the question now.

1016
01:00:41.121 --> 01:00:44.870
The obvious favorites or people like Fidel Castro,
Barbara Bush,

1017
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.370
Amy Winehouse,
that midget from Austin Powers.
That's a good one.

1018
01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:52.130
Patrick Swayze,
et cetera.
Well,

1019
01:00:52.131 --> 01:00:56.330
every month everyone in the pool gets to pick a wildcard who wasn't on the

1020
01:00:56.331 --> 01:01:01.310
original roster.
Well,
I took a lot of shit this past week.

1021
01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.660
Ah,
I don't want to read this.

1022
01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.150
I don't want to read this because I don't want to put ideas in people's heads.

1023
01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.330
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I just,
you know what?

1024
01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:13.220
I got you guys all excited and don't know.
I'm not fucking reading that one.
Um,

1025
01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.070
all right,
Bill.
I recently grew a beard.

1026
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.720
There's a lot of social commentary on this.
Uh,
these questions this week.
Bill,

1027
01:01:20.721 --> 01:01:25.250
I recently grew a beard and had an argument with a gay guy that I work with.

1028
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:29.120
He told me that all men with beards are gay.

1029
01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:38.360
That must've really killed your fucking idea growing a beard.
So,
uh,
he says,

1030
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:42.410
and my whole argument was where to gay people get off just claiming something as

1031
01:01:42.411 --> 01:01:44.600
their own just because they like it.

1032
01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:49.580
Am I the only one who thinks that they can get away with this logic that they

1033
01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:52.520
can get away with?
His logic is fucking crazy.
You know,

1034
01:01:52.521 --> 01:01:56.510
wax eyebrows and going can't to tanning salons.
I'll give him that one.

1035
01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:00.350
But a beard,
when I think of people with beards,
I don't think gay,

1036
01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:05.440
I think lumberjacks swinging axis that's kind of gay bent over his tree thumb.

1037
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:12.600
Did you ever see that Monty python sketch?
I'm a lumberjack and I don't care.

1038
01:02:12.601 --> 01:02:15.530
Have a good [inaudible] but uh,
and eventually it gets gay or,

1039
01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:20.531
and dare and float out of fucking dresses and dress just like me.

1040
01:02:20.911 --> 01:02:23.880
Mom,
he's on my jacket.
He don't care.

1041
01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.480
He fucking sucks cock and he likes the Bulls.
Um,
anyways,

1042
01:02:27.481 --> 01:02:28.910
when he thinks of a beard,

1043
01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:32.940
he thinks of lumberjacks swinging access like that job still exist.

1044
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:36.840
Don't they have fucking chain sounds at this point?
Playoff hockey.
Yup.

1045
01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:41.570
I'll give you that.
And I think that's some gay people.
Some in quotes,

1046
01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:46.200
gay people have gotten way too comfortable in society.

1047
01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:50.250
Those bastards.
Where do they get off being uncomfortable?

1048
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:54.000
Cause if he lived in the south and not New York City,

1049
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:58.200
he'd be dragged behind a truck for saying that all men with beards are gay.

1050
01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:03.150
And not that I condone that behavior,
but maybe some gays have it coming to them.

1051
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.720
Jesus Christ.
Then he writes.

1052
01:03:06.721 --> 01:03:10.920
That's all really.
Is that off?
Uh,
you know,
you pop off at the mouth.

1053
01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:15.180
There are consequences if you would your thoughts please.

1054
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:16.890
I'll tell you what happened.

1055
01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.920
I think you're a little uncomfortable with gay people and you wanted to grow a

1056
01:03:22.081 --> 01:03:24.270
beard and you are all set on growing it.

1057
01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:28.950
And then some Gig I came up maybe realizing that you are homophobic decided to

1058
01:03:28.951 --> 01:03:31.980
fuck with your head.
And he said,
all men with beards are gay.

1059
01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:36.630
And it pissed you off because you thought this was going to be some rugged shit

1060
01:03:36.631 --> 01:03:39.480
that was going to get you some pussy.
And as you grow in it,

1061
01:03:39.481 --> 01:03:44.050
you can't get that guy out of your head going all men with beards again.

1062
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:48.910
So here's my number,
sweetie.
Um,

1063
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:53.520
I don't know.
I don't think all men with beards are gay.
Um,

1064
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.230
and I think a lot of times when you see a guy with a beard who is gay,

1065
01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.500
you can tell because it's too manicured.

1066
01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:05.070
Just to George Michael ask,
you know what I mean?

1067
01:04:05.071 --> 01:04:10.071
But you gotta you gotta you do have to manicure it to a certain point manicure.

1068
01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.140
That's such a [inaudible] that's fucking nails,
whatever.

1069
01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:17.370
You know what I'm saying?
You got to trim it.
It's two landscapes,
but you know,

1070
01:04:17.371 --> 01:04:21.330
you've got to keep it off.
Your neck hurts.
It's just itchy is fucking hell.
Uh,
no,

1071
01:04:21.331 --> 01:04:23.500
I don't think beards are gay.
Um,

1072
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.960
I think I thought more like hipster guys do it,
you know,

1073
01:04:27.961 --> 01:04:30.470
and all these hipsters are trying to dress like they're,
uh,

1074
01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.140
they're in the Beastie boys sabotage video.
You know,

1075
01:04:34.141 --> 01:04:36.870
they're trying to dress that way,
but there's this air of,
Oh,

1076
01:04:36.871 --> 01:04:38.460
I didn't even notice.
You know,

1077
01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:42.390
I just accidentally dressed like I was in the 70s.

1078
01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:46.890
Um,
what are my thoughts?
My thoughts are basically,
dude,

1079
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.530
I think that if you want to grow a beard,
you should grow a beard.

1080
01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:54.030
And I think if a gay guy in down south said all guys who have beards are gay,

1081
01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:59.010
I would like to think that people would just laugh and still grow a beard if

1082
01:04:59.011 --> 01:05:04.011
they want it to rather than get all uncomfortable to the point that they'd want

1083
01:05:04.081 --> 01:05:07.710
to drag a gay guy behind the truck and beat the shit out of him.
Uh,

1084
01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:11.910
I don't think anybody has a comment on in that instance.

1085
01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:16.110
You know what I mean?
Um,
but if I was gay,

1086
01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.730
I would probably be careful of who I said that to.

1087
01:05:18.731 --> 01:05:22.030
Considering there are people out there who feel that people who do that should

1088
01:05:22.031 --> 01:05:24.100
be dragged behind a truck and get,
you know what?

1089
01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:27.910
You know what in a way the person is right.
When you do run your mouth,

1090
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:31.510
there are consequences cause you don't realize who the psychos are.

1091
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:36.400
This guy seems a little psychotic,
a little psychotic.

1092
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:38.590
He doesn't condone the behavior,
but he's just saying,

1093
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.430
Jesus,
can we have a lighthearted question here where I don't have to,
you know?

1094
01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:48.250
Okay.
Question a bill.

1095
01:05:48.251 --> 01:05:52.210
I was having a cigarette outside a restaurant last week and a guy who is missing

1096
01:05:52.211 --> 01:05:57.211
both arms comes over telling me to put it out because I was disturbing him with

1097
01:05:58.781 --> 01:06:01.750
my secondhand smoke.
All right,
you guys just making this shit up.

1098
01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:05.620
This really seems made up,
but you know,
just for the comedy of it,

1099
01:06:05.621 --> 01:06:08.500
I'll go with it.
He was wearing a muscle shirt.

1100
01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:12.480
Okay.
I'm guess I'm still going to believe this.

1101
01:06:12.481 --> 01:06:15.820
He was wearing a muscle shirt completely exposing his nubs.

1102
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:21.460
I jokingly told this guy,
I'll put it out if he beats me at a game of rock,

1103
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:24.580
paper,
scissors and it's questions bullshit.

1104
01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:27.010
You didn't say this eight is it bullshit?

1105
01:06:27.011 --> 01:06:29.680
This is even if he had a muscle tee shirt on,

1106
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:34.710
even if he had no arms and even if he fucking came over and told you to put out

1107
01:06:36.161 --> 01:06:40.330
the cigarette,
it is no way you said it.
If you beat me,
if I'd be,

1108
01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:44.390
if he beats you had a game of rock,
paper,
scissors,
you know this.

1109
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:48.880
That's like the shit you wish you said when he left.
But I will go with it.
Okay.

1110
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:52.900
You know,
far be it for me to say and the people align to me.
All right.

1111
01:06:52.901 --> 01:06:56.320
Or exaggerating.
So evidently after he did this,

1112
01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:00.970
I'm the guy went off,
the guy went off on me and I felt bad.

1113
01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:05.710
So I put it out,
oh,
after you destroy the guy

1114
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:09.970
and I put it out,
I pissed him off and I was like,
all right,
there you go.

1115
01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:11.050
There's the question.

1116
01:07:11.051 --> 01:07:16.051
Should amputees or people with horrific physical deformities warn you about it

1117
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:20.800
before starting starting you with they're terrifying.

1118
01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:24.880
Handicap.
All right,
that's hilarious.
What was he supposed to do?

1119
01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:29.940
Like be on the other side of whatever building dairy queen you were sitting on

1120
01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:33.550
and be like,
why?
God is like,
you know,

1121
01:07:33.551 --> 01:07:37.750
I don't have any items that I'm wearing a tank top,
bottom color out of the car.

1122
01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.560
So if you want to finish your soft serve and not get startled,

1123
01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:47.200
you know,
you got three seconds to close your eyes.
Um,
you know,

1124
01:07:47.201 --> 01:07:50.800
something that is a,
that is,
yeah,
it's,
it's,

1125
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.680
it's one of those things where you're not trying to be mean.
I don't know.

1126
01:07:53.681 --> 01:07:57.730
I can't speak for you,
but for me personally,
you know,
you're not trying to be,
uh,

1127
01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.330
you know,
insensitive.
But you know,

1128
01:08:01.331 --> 01:08:05.560
if you haven't been to war or you don't work in an emergency room,
they,
yeah.

1129
01:08:05.561 --> 01:08:09.670
There are shit that you're not expecting,
but you know,
you kind of roll with it.

1130
01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.390
Um,
I don't think that they should have to warn you about it,

1131
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:18.990
but I don't know what you have to do as a person to become more used to it.

1132
01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:24.220
I don't know.
You know what?
Sometimes sometimes I don't have the answers.

1133
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.851
I'll tell you.
It's fucked up.

1134
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:30.350
Have you guys seen the new show on MTV called scarred?
It's insane.

1135
01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:35.420
It's basically footage of people trying to do tricks on bikes and skateboards

1136
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:43.070
and on rollerblades and it's not the funny,
Oh,
when he lands on his nuts,

1137
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:47.270
it's bones popping out of the skin.
And I'm going to tell you something,

1138
01:08:47.271 --> 01:08:50.420
dude is fucking unwatchable.

1139
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.750
And uh,
it was so twisted and sick.

1140
01:08:53.751 --> 01:08:58.751
I actually sent a text message to ob from the OPN Anthony show to tell him to

1141
01:08:59.481 --> 01:09:04.370
get footage of it because it just seemed like such an opiate Anthony show clip,

1142
01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:08.680
you know,
they already did two girls,
one cup.
Now they could do a thing where,

1143
01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:13.310
you know,
can you sit here and watch bones come out of somebody's fucking hand?

1144
01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:18.020
Oh,
brutal.
All right.
Um,
okay.

1145
01:09:18.021 --> 01:09:22.160
Real quick.
Overrated.
Underrated.
Overrated.
Neal.
Pert of rush.
Awesome drummer.

1146
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:25.700
But he gets way too much credit.
You know what?
I would,
uh,

1147
01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:30.440
I would definitely say he's an awesome drummer,
but yeah,
he's too robotic.

1148
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:33.950
I don't hear the,
uh,
I don't hear a groove.

1149
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:36.950
I liked John Bonham like I'm way better.
All right.

1150
01:09:36.951 --> 01:09:41.951
Underrated Comic Louie Ck saw him about three times and he kills each and every

1151
01:09:43.311 --> 01:09:45.950
time.
Oh Louise.
One of my favorite comics of all times.

1152
01:09:45.951 --> 01:09:49.370
I think he's fucking unbelievable and he blows me away.
So,

1153
01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.930
um,
if somebody is saying he isn't,
then yeah,
he is definitely underrated.

1154
01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:57.830
All right.
But not amongst Comedians,
I can tell you that.
All right,
last question.

1155
01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:02.690
Bill.
Here's a podcast question for Ya.
Uh,
your business is comedy,

1156
01:10:02.691 --> 01:10:05.090
right?
So let me ask you,

1157
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:10.430
do you run the business or does the business run you hope?
You know what I mean?

1158
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:13.430
Chairs.
I gotta be honest with you.
I don't know what you mean.

1159
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:19.450
Do I run the business as you mean my personal business or show business?

1160
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:23.040
I definitely do not run.
Show business.
Are you,

1161
01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:28.090
do you mean do I take the time to fly a kite each day and reflect on the fact

1162
01:10:28.581 --> 01:10:33.581
that I'm alive or do I just sit here and do podcasts and fucking tried to

1163
01:10:35.421 --> 01:10:39.470
attempt to finish blogs and shit?
Um,
I don't know.
It depends on the day.

1164
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:41.810
Depends on the day.

1165
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:47.780
I got my first massage and about eight months and legal,
by the way.

1166
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:51.650
And,
uh,
I felt great after it and I've,

1167
01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:55.880
I've decided that I was going to start doing that.
You know,
you know me,
you know,

1168
01:10:55.881 --> 01:11:00.290
I have fucking OCD,
so I was like,
I want to do it every week.

1169
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:06.290
You know,
I'll spend 50 grand a year on
massages,

1170
01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.970
which would cause stress.
You know,
I really gotta do something about my,
my,

1171
01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:15.030
I,
I'm just like,
I just realized that I'm going to be in Nashville,

1172
01:11:15.031 --> 01:11:18.840
Tennessee and before I do Nashville,
the Wednesday before I do Nashville,

1173
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:23.610
I'm going to do the Bob and Tom Show in Indianapolis.
And I was thinking,
well,

1174
01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.880
you know,
I'm trying to go to every sports fucking team for some dumb reason.

1175
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:31.950
And I'm literally contemplating driving down to go to a Memphis grizzly game

1176
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:36.150
after I do Bob and Tom.
It's like a 400 mile drive.

1177
01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:39.840
And then after the game I would then have to drive over to Nashville and get

1178
01:11:39.841 --> 01:11:43.650
there in time to check in,
fall asleep,
and then do the radio in the morning.

1179
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.670
And,
uh,
I'd like to tell you that I'm not going to do it,

1180
01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:52.671
but I think I'm going to do it and possibly hang around and drive up to the

1181
01:11:52.861 --> 01:11:55.830
Cincinnati Bengals game on a Sunday.

1182
01:11:58.170 --> 01:12:02.130
It's pathetic,
right?
But,
uh,
I dunno.

1183
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.450
I think I'm going to do it.

1184
01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:08.190
Am I running from something or am I just a fucking maniac?
I Dunno.

1185
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:10.980
I Dunno what,
but I can tell you this.
Um,

1186
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.680
you guys don't need to worry about my fucking problems.

1187
01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:17.480
Let's wrap up this podcast.
I think it was a very good podcast.
We learned,
uh,

1188
01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:23.220
and some social commentary and,
uh,
we learned about Jakks,

1189
01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.680
learned about my OCD.

1190
01:12:25.681 --> 01:12:28.200
We learned about Pumpkin and you guys will learn about pumpkin carving.

1191
01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.050
Something that I learned when I was watching Martha Stewart,

1192
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:32.760
who I can't stand watching.

1193
01:12:32.761 --> 01:12:35.820
It just so happened that I wanted to carve a pumpkin and I was flipping through

1194
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:40.620
and I saw pumpkin and I stopped and she sat there with her cold demeanor.

1195
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:44.040
When you're poor Korea,
one of the things you want to do,

1196
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:48.390
cause she just seems like she'd be the worst mother ever.
Like couldn't hug you,

1197
01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:52.950
couldn't,
she couldn't show love and would just,
you know,

1198
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:57.390
could never admit when she's wrong and Oh Geez,
I'm fucking projecting right now.

1199
01:12:57.630 --> 01:12:59.910
Um,
so basically what you want to do with the Pumpkin,

1200
01:12:59.911 --> 01:13:03.870
what I learned is you want to Lee area the side where you're going to be carving

1201
01:13:03.871 --> 01:13:06.660
into.
You want to make that as thin as humanly possible.

1202
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:11.580
That way when you light the candle inside of it,
it glows this bright orange.

1203
01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:15.960
So if you carve something
scary or something like that,

1204
01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.220
it's the shit.

1205
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:22.350
I really got to figure out how to upload pictures from my cell phone onto my

1206
01:13:22.351 --> 01:13:25.530
computer cause you gotta see this ACDC pumped.
And then I met,
you know what?

1207
01:13:25.531 --> 01:13:27.330
Now I'm going to hype it up so much and be like,
dude,

1208
01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:31.410
it really didn't live up to the hype and then I'll be hurt.
And uh,

1209
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:33.570
which would be the reverse of what I wanted to do.

1210
01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.070
The reverse of the exercise of carving a Pumpkin was for me to be a happier

1211
01:13:38.071 --> 01:13:42.160
human being,
more peace.
Um,
all right,

1212
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:46.860
let's,
let's fucking wrapped us up.
I say this every week and then I keep going.

1213
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:51.270
Let's,
let's re hype the gigs I rights I have.
Um,

1214
01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:54.930
I'll be at the Improv,
Washington DC November 6th through the eighth.

1215
01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:00.380
After that I'll be at xannies comedy club November 13th through the fucking

1216
01:14:01.141 --> 01:14:05.070
15th.
And,
um,
hey,
you know what?

1217
01:14:05.071 --> 01:14:07.530
I'm going to go to that God damn Bengals game.
What do you think about that?

1218
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:11.320
Any listeners in Cincinnati,
you got an extra fucking ticket.

1219
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.930
Let me know.
I'll come up to your tailgate.

1220
01:14:13.931 --> 01:14:18.390
We'll fucking eat some ribs that you cook out so you don't have,
I'll be like,
uh,

1221
01:14:18.610 --> 01:14:23.530
I'll be like a,
has been celebrity.
How'd you show up?
Like,
this is what my,
uh,

1222
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.900
my career has come to you.

1223
01:14:25.901 --> 01:14:29.680
Gotta you gotta pay me an in fucking smoked ribs and I'll show up to your

1224
01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:33.810
tailgate.
Um,
and,
uh,

1225
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:35.170
all I know one last thing,

1226
01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:39.850
we're going to be taping another episode of uninformed.
We always,
uh,
pre,
uh,

1227
01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:40.810
pre-taped these things.

1228
01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:44.350
I'm going to try to get some clips of it up on a uninformed radio,

1229
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.270
my face.com/uninformed radio and a big news,

1230
01:14:49.271 --> 01:14:51.970
our guest is going to be Joe Perry from Aerosmith.

1231
01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:57.600
It's a long story how I ended up meeting somebody who was related to him and uh,

1232
01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:03.960
somehow it all came together and I'm hoping I don't make an ass of myself when I

1233
01:15:04.211 --> 01:15:08.170
interview him because I'm a huge fan and uh,
so whatever.

1234
01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:12.250
So I will let you know when that episode is going to air and we will definitely

1235
01:15:12.251 --> 01:15:16.480
start trying to get a audio clips from the show because people seem to like the

1236
01:15:16.481 --> 01:15:20.650
very special,
uh,
what was it,
Thursday,

1237
01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:23.020
Monday morning podcasts that I taped before this one,

1238
01:15:23.021 --> 01:15:25.660
if you want to go into the archives.
All right,
that's it.
I'm babbling.

1239
01:15:25.661 --> 01:15:28.030
It's not funny anymore.
It's just torture.
All right.

1240
01:15:28.031 --> 01:15:29.440
Hope all you guys have a good week.

1241
01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.380
Please keep the questions coming and I'm really enjoying them.
The,

1242
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:35.210
the underrated overrated.
And,
uh,

1243
01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:38.840
if there's anything that I said that you felt was wrong and you'd like to

1244
01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:43.930
educate me,
or if I asked any questions,
I know I asked about JAKKS.

1245
01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:47.620
Why don't you,
why don't you tell me about llamas?
How about that?
Where,

1246
01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:51.940
where they're indigenous to for some reason,
I'm thinking the Arab community.

1247
01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:57.220
Um,
all right.
That's it.
That's it.
I'm rubbing my face,

1248
01:15:57.221 --> 01:16:01.060
which means I'm exhausted.
Or is that stress?
Maybe it's stress.

1249
01:16:01.061 --> 01:16:02.230
Maybe I got too much shit to do.

1250
01:16:02.231 --> 01:16:05.020
So thanks for listening to the Monday morning podcast.
As always,

1251
01:16:05.021 --> 01:16:09.970
keep all this stuff coming in and,
uh,
please come out to my shows and,
uh,

1252
01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:13.410
that plus all your hope.
Y'All have a good week.
All right.
Take it easy.

1253
01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:55.053
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1254
01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.060
<v 6>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

1255
01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:05.140
It's the Monday morning podcast.
You know,

1256
01:17:05.141 --> 01:17:09.320
I realize I start every podcast by saying,
hey,

1257
01:17:09.321 --> 01:17:14.000
what's going on?
I got to come up with something else.
Well,
maybe I should,

1258
01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:18.240
maybe I should brand that.
Like that guy,
uh,

1259
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:21.980
Michael buffer or,
uh,
the,
uh,

1260
01:17:21.981 --> 01:17:26.300
the big bouncer looking guy from the UFC,
you know,
when he goes,

1261
01:17:26.301 --> 01:17:28.760
are you ready?
Are you ready?

1262
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:34.500
Who's good if for some reason he's the only one I think.

1263
01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.330
I don't even fucking the typical,
I didn't research this,
but as far as I know,

1264
01:17:38.331 --> 01:17:40.640
I think legally he's the only one who can say,

1265
01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:43.370
let's get it on before UFC match,

1266
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:47.660
which is fucking ridiculous because he didn't come up with let's get it on.

1267
01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.310
You know
what's his face?

1268
01:17:52.311 --> 01:17:55.940
That fucking guy with the beard who got shot by his dad used to wear the red
hat.

1269
01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:59.390
Marvin Gaye.
Marvin Gaye wrote a song,

1270
01:17:59.391 --> 01:18:04.391
let's get it on Ben in his seventies evidently he was singing to some fucking 14

1271
01:18:04.491 --> 01:18:07.280
year old girl.
16 son,
make him a freak.

1272
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:12.080
16 in the studio trying to convince her to fuck him,

1273
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:17.960
you know,
so I'm able to get up to a whole nother can of worms.

1274
01:18:17.961 --> 01:18:20.510
The whole r Kelly thing that uh,
I dunno,

1275
01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:24.800
it was acceptable back then or was it,
was there a double standard?

1276
01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:29.150
Wait a second.
I'm going to say Rupert Murdoch wasn't Rupert Murdoch.

1277
01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:33.660
Who Know what the fuck was that name?
Who's that fucking guy he was,

1278
01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:36.180
he was from France.
Any.

1279
01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:41.360
He drugged up the 14 year old and a Jack Nicholson's hot tub,
Roman Polanski.

1280
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.240
It's funny how he got in trouble for that shit.

1281
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:45.950
He had to literally leave the country.

1282
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:51.130
Marvin Gaye is really singing a song about how he wants to fuck a 16 year old

1283
01:18:51.501 --> 01:18:55.730
and nothing ever happened to him till his dad shot him.
But I think,

1284
01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.270
I don't think that that was related.
Um,
so anyway,

1285
01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.860
I want to fucking 16 year old.
Ooh,

1286
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:11.150
let's get it on sugar.
That's what he was giving her.

1287
01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.370
That's how young she was.
And you couldn't even bribe him with money.

1288
01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.240
She didn't know what it was.

1289
01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:18.530
He was giving them those little fucking little Halloween candies.
Oh,

1290
01:19:18.531 --> 01:19:22.460
did I carve a pumpkin this year?
I tried.
I took a fucking picture of it.

1291
01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:27.200
I called the,
I called this awesome pumpkin.
One of them suck,

1292
01:19:27.201 --> 01:19:29.810
but the other one,
the ACDC one,
and for the life of me,

1293
01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:32.750
I cannot upload it onto my fucking myspace page.

1294
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:37.040
A good friend of mine heard my problem on my last podcast.

1295
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:39.860
She showed me how to do it on my phone.

1296
01:19:39.861 --> 01:19:42.020
I was able to email the picture to myself.

1297
01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:47.320
I was able to save that picture in my fucking eye photo

1298
01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.530
thing,
whatever the fuck that is.

1299
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:54.590
And then I went to upload it on my space and then they're like,
oh,
we have a,

1300
01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:59.120
we have an error.
There's an error.
I hate it.
My space,
how they go,

1301
01:19:59.330 --> 01:20:03.380
sorry.
There was an unexpected error.
It's like,
you know what Tom,

1302
01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:08.340
there's nothing unexpected about it at this point.
Okay.
If it went through,

1303
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:12.470
that would have been unexpected.
All right.
I've got a little look at it.

1304
01:20:12.471 --> 01:20:17.090
A little fucking up,
piss and vinegar in me this week.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

1305
01:20:17.091 --> 01:20:19.890
I do this podcast once a week here.
Um,

1306
01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:25.350
I do it on a billboard.com and simultaneously simultaneously here on my myspace

1307
01:20:25.351 --> 01:20:28.160
page and you can download these on,
uh,

1308
01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:33.870
was it iTunes and a,
yeah,
I do one of these every single week.

1309
01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:37.560
People ask me questions.
I answered the questions to the best of my ability.

1310
01:20:37.561 --> 01:20:42.540
And other than that,
I rant about shit and like I'm doing right now.
And,

1311
01:20:42.541 --> 01:20:45.440
uh,
before we get started on the podcast,
um,

1312
01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:49.920
I want to congratulate the Philadelphia Phillies,
but when in the world series,

1313
01:20:49.921 --> 01:20:54.390
look at that,
they got this second one.
What a relief that is.

1314
01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:55.800
I know the feeling right now.

1315
01:20:55.801 --> 01:20:59.760
No one can talk shit to you and no one can say shit to you for a long time.

1316
01:20:59.761 --> 01:21:00.001
You know,

1317
01:21:00.001 --> 01:21:04.620
you realize how long you have to suck now in baseball for anybody to give you

1318
01:21:04.621 --> 01:21:08.880
shit,
you know.
And had you fucking done that a couple of years ago,

1319
01:21:08.881 --> 01:21:11.510
I would've been in trouble in Camden because there there's nothing I would have,

1320
01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:15.990
I could have said about you
actually.
I,
I could have,

1321
01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:19.170
I still could've come up with something,
but I don't want to get into that.

1322
01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.890
I'm trying to mend fences.
Um,
yeah,
the silly fucking wanting,

1323
01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:27.750
you know,
Pete the God Damn Double Race and look at myself,

1324
01:21:27.751 --> 01:21:31.320
I talked myself into a corner because I have nothing mean to say about that

1325
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:36.210
other than congratulations and the second year nice,
all comedy stops.

1326
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:41.410
Um,
anyways.
You know what?
Let me,
let me see what,
let's,
let's hype what I Have Co.

1327
01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:46.230
What's hype,
what I have coming up this week.
Um,
I have,

1328
01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:50.670
uh,
I have to open a fucking window to know what the hell I have coming up.
Oh,

1329
01:21:50.671 --> 01:21:54.800
I know where I'm going to be.
I'm going to be at the,
uh,
the Improv in DC.

1330
01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:59.010
And let me tell you something.
Boys and girls tickets are going fast.

1331
01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:00.480
Um,

1332
01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.920
I get unbelievable support in DC and uh,

1333
01:22:05.730 --> 01:22:08.970
the fuck is wrong with my website.
Don't start this.

1334
01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:13.020
Don't start this.
Oh,
there it is.
I clicked on the wrong page.
No,

1335
01:22:13.021 --> 01:22:17.370
I get unbelievable,
uh,
support in DC.
Um,
last time I went there,

1336
01:22:17.371 --> 01:22:19.860
all show sold out before even got there.

1337
01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:25.260
I didn't have to get up and do fucking radio,
but I still did it.
I still,
Oh,

1338
01:22:25.261 --> 01:22:28.670
look who's Collin and it's showed a Rosa Jody Rosa.

1339
01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:34.170
I'm in the middle of doing my podcast.
Let me call you right back.

1340
01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.190
I'll be done in about 20 minutes.
All right,
sweetie.

1341
01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.270
Um,
Joe Rosa,
my cohost on uninformed,

1342
01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:47.360
we're gonna be doing it this Friday and our in studio guest is going to be a,

1343
01:22:47.371 --> 01:22:49.710
actually,
he's calling is going to be Joe Perry from Aerosmith.

1344
01:22:49.711 --> 01:22:52.590
So we're really excited and I'll let you guys know when it's going to air

1345
01:22:52.591 --> 01:22:56.760
because we,
uh,
we prerecorded.
But getting back on topic this week,

1346
01:22:56.761 --> 01:22:58.950
I'm going to be at the Improv in Washington DC.

1347
01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:03.660
Last I heard there was about 150 tickets left and a,

1348
01:23:03.661 --> 01:23:07.570
so if you want to go,
uh,
go to,
uh,

1349
01:23:07.630 --> 01:23:11.500
what does it improv.com I know I got to write down on my myspace page.

1350
01:23:11.501 --> 01:23:14.540
You can click on it or if you're on my,
uh,
my webpage,

1351
01:23:14.650 --> 01:23:17.740
if you just click on upcoming appearances,
there'll be a link right there.

1352
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:22.030
I'm going to be there November 6th,
November 7th,
November 8th.

1353
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:24.270
And uh,

1354
01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:29.340
it's part of the uninformed comedy tour hyping my radio show with Joe to Rosa

1355
01:23:29.411 --> 01:23:33.640
who just called in.
Isn't that ironic?
Isn't it ironic?
I don't know.

1356
01:23:33.970 --> 01:23:38.560
I don't even know what irony means anymore.
I don't even know what fucking,

1357
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:42.520
you know,
was that serendipity?
You know,

1358
01:23:42.521 --> 01:23:47.230
who ruined irony would the fucking hipsters,
you know,
everything became ironic.

1359
01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:51.880
I'm wearing an ACD,
she shirt,
but I'm wearing it ironically.
How do you do that?

1360
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:55.870
How do you wear something?
Ironically,
you are wearing it.

1361
01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:58.900
You fuck something ironic about it.

1362
01:23:58.901 --> 01:24:01.990
It's covering your awful unworked out torso.

1363
01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:07.720
I thought irony was,
I think I've discussed this before in podcasts.

1364
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:08.680
You know what we did?

1365
01:24:08.681 --> 01:24:11.110
And people sent me definitions and I still don't understand it.

1366
01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:16.270
I thought irony was when the,
the fucking fire chief's house burns to the ground.

1367
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:20.260
Isn't that ironic?
Don't you think?
Right.

1368
01:24:20.261 --> 01:24:24.160
And then you walk around with Alannis Morissette you don't want her career went

1369
01:24:24.161 --> 01:24:28.810
off the rails is when she did that fucking video naked and she had her long,

1370
01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.250
uh,
fucking likes.
You just crawl out of that.
Well,

1371
01:24:33.251 --> 01:24:36.730
like that chick from the ring when she had that hair hanging down over a titties

1372
01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:40.660
and I don't,
I don't know what it was.
It was like,

1373
01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:44.020
she had a very pancake

1374
01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:50.260
shaped cheat.
She looked like a gingerbread man with long hair.

1375
01:24:50.261 --> 01:24:55.210
And tidies
as what it was.
What you want with a woman.

1376
01:24:55.211 --> 01:24:57.940
You want the curves,
right?
That little hourglass thing going on,

1377
01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:03.280
you know not to give women a bad fucking body image.

1378
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:06.130
Women do so much shit to just fuck with their own heads.

1379
01:25:06.131 --> 01:25:09.190
If you ever do you ever talk to a girl and there'll be like,
you're like,
hey,

1380
01:25:09.191 --> 01:25:12.040
why don't you get that?
That'll look cool.
I can't wear that.

1381
01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:17.410
Why can't you wear that cause cause I'm a spoon.
You're a what?

1382
01:25:17.550 --> 01:25:21.500
I'm a spoon.
The fuck is a spoon now.

1383
01:25:21.501 --> 01:25:26.050
That's my body shape.
I'm a spoon.
Well why did you just say that?

1384
01:25:26.051 --> 01:25:28.060
Like that was a common term sweetheart.

1385
01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.860
And you find out that they actually go to these,

1386
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:37.690
these fucking people and they tell them like what their body shape is.

1387
01:25:37.691 --> 01:25:42.550
And I guess his spooned means you don't have much in a way of of chest,

1388
01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:46.360
but you have a booty.
So that means you're a spoon.
You know,

1389
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:50.330
if you look to hold the spoon sideways evidentaly that looks like a chick with

1390
01:25:50.331 --> 01:25:52.450
an ass.
Which I don't think it does.

1391
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:56.980
Cause personally I am an ass man and I've never had the desire to fuck a spoon,

1392
01:25:57.130 --> 01:26:00.760
even though he eats cereal every morning for breakfast.
Okay,

1393
01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.070
and you just tidies.

1394
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:09.770
What is that on the capital t?
I can't wear a hoop skirt.

1395
01:26:09.771 --> 01:26:13.330
I'm a capital.
I mean,
I don't know what the fuck it is.
They just come up,

1396
01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.990
you know?
I don't,
I don't know what I am.
You know?
Actually,

1397
01:26:17.991 --> 01:26:20.990
one time I actually looked at myself standing sideways,

1398
01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:24.470
completely naked in a mirror,
right?

1399
01:26:24.650 --> 01:26:29.650
I was in a hotel and I realize that I am shaped like the pink panther.

1400
01:26:33.190 --> 01:26:36.620
Pink Panther has a big head and he's,

1401
01:26:36.710 --> 01:26:40.400
and he's got big feet and they use his body that just goes straight,

1402
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:43.730
straight down.
That's,
that's how I'm shaped.
I like to think my,

1403
01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:48.170
I have better shoulders than the pink panther,
but I don't know.
You know,

1404
01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:52.070
that's not for me to judge.
That's for the poor woman who's hooked up.

1405
01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:56.840
You know what?
Fuck this.
Let's get to the podcast questions.

1406
01:26:56.841 --> 01:26:59.740
Why am I telling you guys about looking at myself?
Make it an a fucking man.
Yo,

1407
01:26:59.750 --> 01:27:04.040
I'll do it with everybody.
Does it?
Um,
Eh,
the,

1408
01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:07.940
the elections tomorrow.
By the way,
if you're listening to this on Monday,
uh,

1409
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:10.250
as of tomorrow,
um,
you know,

1410
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:15.910
maybe we're going to have a new president if Bush doesn't declare martial law in

1411
01:27:16.341 --> 01:27:20.810
the last second being that's going to come down to Florida again and they're

1412
01:27:20.811 --> 01:27:24.800
going to be trying to count fucking votes.
I Dunno.

1413
01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.470
I'm really nervous that they're going to leave,

1414
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:30.770
that Obama's going to win and they're going to leave him

1415
01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:36.730
to try and clean up this unclean appealable mess.
I don't know.

1416
01:27:36.731 --> 01:27:40.040
It was just too fucking depressing to think about.
I do.
Whoever wins.
Okay.

1417
01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:43.760
You know what the great thing about this election is if McCain winds or Obama

1418
01:27:43.761 --> 01:27:46.580
wins,
at the very least,
we're going to have a president again,

1419
01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:49.790
that can actually make a speech without you having to look away.

1420
01:27:51.230 --> 01:27:54.230
And I think that's good.
I think that's good.

1421
01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:57.440
Even though they both worked for the Rothschilds and we're on our way to one

1422
01:27:57.441 --> 01:27:59.450
world government,
one World Bank.
Fuck.

1423
01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:02.180
I was trying not to say that you guys seen that commercial out where they're

1424
01:28:02.181 --> 01:28:06.020
going to make it easier for us to travel between Mexico,
the Co,

1425
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:07.850
the Caribbean and Canada.

1426
01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:13.580
If we all have enhanced driver's license,
wink link,

1427
01:28:13.581 --> 01:28:17.300
enhance microchip in it so they can track your whereabouts cause they're trying

1428
01:28:17.301 --> 01:28:20.330
to get the cherish trying to get terrorist.
What?

1429
01:28:20.331 --> 01:28:23.480
I'm trying to see what you're doing.
We're trying to get terrorist.
Hey man,

1430
01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:26.830
he ain't doing nothing wrong.
He shouldn't have fucking time with it.

1431
01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:32.750
People who say that should be processed,
you know,

1432
01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.580
I don't think they should be killed.
I,
you know,

1433
01:28:34.581 --> 01:28:36.350
I don't know what to do with them.
Should I go with the Hacky,

1434
01:28:36.351 --> 01:28:39.980
stick them on an island and give him some big fucking cotton candy machine.

1435
01:28:40.410 --> 01:28:43.740
Most of those fucking people in government can listen to your phone calls.
Well,

1436
01:28:43.741 --> 01:28:45.110
if you ain't doing nothing wrong,

1437
01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:51.940
the government can fuck you in the ass.
Well high.
If you got little boy,

1438
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:56.150
you ain't got no fucking morons.
Yeah,

1439
01:28:56.151 --> 01:28:59.870
just keep giving away more rights.
People just keep doing that,
you know,

1440
01:28:59.871 --> 01:29:03.810
and I'm going to keep bitching about it as I don't join any groups to prevent it

1441
01:29:03.811 --> 01:29:08.040
or organize or show up at anywhere.
Alleys.
I'm that guy.

1442
01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:09.900
I'm that guy who sits there and goes,
hey,

1443
01:29:09.901 --> 01:29:12.120
you know what the problem is and then I don't do anything about it.

1444
01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:17.670
I'm an asshole.
All right,
question number one of the week.
Uh,
number one bill.
Uh,

1445
01:29:17.671 --> 01:29:18.960
we need nicknames.

1446
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:24.010
And who better to ask than one of the commentators from the racetrack?

1447
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:26.730
The fuck does that mean love the podcast?

1448
01:29:26.731 --> 01:29:29.430
Just thought it would be something to talk about.
What uh,

1449
01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:34.460
what's the funniest nicknames for a fighter and what would you name the four

1450
01:29:34.951 --> 01:29:39.570
guys on our main picture?
What,

1451
01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:47.280
how do you think he would fair as a fighter or was a corner man also who's the

1452
01:29:47.431 --> 01:29:48.330
best fighter ever?

1453
01:29:48.331 --> 01:29:50.970
I'll answer those last three cause I don't understand the first.

1454
01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:52.680
I mean I'm probably fucking it up.

1455
01:29:52.681 --> 01:29:55.200
I mean sometimes people write sentences that make sense.

1456
01:29:55.201 --> 01:30:00.060
But I read so poorly that when I read them out loud I pause and weird areas and

1457
01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:02.100
then they don't make sense to me or the listener.

1458
01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:06.540
And it's one of the reasons why I was never successful when I ran for student

1459
01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:10.080
government.
I didn't run for student government.
Um,

1460
01:30:10.090 --> 01:30:14.070
I was too busy flunking every class that I had.
I was too busy doing that.
Um,

1461
01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.900
all right,
bill,
what a c,

1462
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.040
how do you think you would fare as a fighter?

1463
01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:23.910
I'm into it depends cause the other person know how to fight.

1464
01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:27.600
Is that one of those brother to brother headlock Nogi fights?

1465
01:30:27.690 --> 01:30:32.010
I always did well in those.
Um,
how would I fair as a fighter?
I think,

1466
01:30:32.011 --> 01:30:35.400
I think I'm all right.
I think I'm on as long as the other person isn't trained.

1467
01:30:35.401 --> 01:30:37.860
If anybody has any sort of training or any sort of background,

1468
01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:42.510
I'm fucked because I don't have any training and have a huge head and that's a

1469
01:30:42.511 --> 01:30:47.220
big target.
In fact,
I was voted most likely to be assassinated and uh,

1470
01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:53.530
I think I've used that joke before.
I just love that one.
Anytime you see anyone.

1471
01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:57.210
The big head and the crowd.
That's what I always think like you could,

1472
01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:59.070
you wouldn't even need to put that guy in a convertible.

1473
01:30:59.090 --> 01:31:02.190
You could hit them with a slingshot from the other side of a fucking cotton

1474
01:31:02.191 --> 01:31:07.140
field.
Like I actually know the size of a cotton field like anybody does,

1475
01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:11.310
you know,
other even cotton fields anymore.
Did that go out with NAFTA?

1476
01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:14.340
See what we're gonna do is we're going to,
we're going to sand a cotton for you.

1477
01:31:14.341 --> 01:31:14.880
We have other,

1478
01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:19.420
you pick our cotton and then we're going to buy the shirts back from them.
Um,

1479
01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:23.220
anyways,
how I think I would fare as a fighter.

1480
01:31:23.221 --> 01:31:26.220
I think if somebody is a no background,

1481
01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:30.300
basically angry cycle like me,
I think I can hold my own,

1482
01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:33.900
although I'm getting a little advanced in age,
40 years old,

1483
01:31:33.901 --> 01:31:37.320
wake up with aches and pains.
Um,

1484
01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:40.350
I think I would fare okay as a professional fighter.

1485
01:31:40.351 --> 01:31:43.530
I would not make it out of the cubs scouts,

1486
01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:46.020
whatever that version is of being a boxer.

1487
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:49.530
I have a complete inability to,
I don't know.
It's weird.

1488
01:31:49.531 --> 01:31:52.230
I have good hand eye coordination.
I can catch things very easily,

1489
01:31:52.231 --> 01:31:55.950
but I'm not fast,
which basically means you can be like,
Bill,
I'm going to,

1490
01:31:55.951 --> 01:32:00.150
you could tell me what fist you're going to hit me and what punched you were

1491
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.530
going to throw an 80% of the time.

1492
01:32:02.531 --> 01:32:07.240
You'd still fucking hit me in the head because I,
I don't know.
By the time I,

1493
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:08.680
I know what you're doing.

1494
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:13.930
The only thing I have left to do is close my eyes and lift my shoulders as if

1495
01:32:13.931 --> 01:32:17.080
that does anything.
You know,
you know that move.
When are you going to get hit?

1496
01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:20.620
You ever see that guy?
You look away,
close your eyes and lift your shoulders.

1497
01:32:21.130 --> 01:32:23.890
That's always a good deal.
Why would you and why?
Why would,

1498
01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.830
why wouldn't you rather lift your hand up and try to fucking,

1499
01:32:26.831 --> 01:32:31.510
you know how boxes do and block it?
What I do is I close my eyes.

1500
01:32:31.511 --> 01:32:33.060
I looked the other way and I lift my shoulders.

1501
01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:38.410
I'm basically trying to protect my,
from my juggler up to my ear lobe,

1502
01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:44.050
but my jaw and my temple and all that other stuff.
That's all for you.

1503
01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:49.030
You can have that all day long,
baby.
I'll fucking eat it up.
All right.

1504
01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:53.890
Um,
how would I fair as a corner man?
Uh,
you know,
if you don't know how to fight,

1505
01:32:53.891 --> 01:32:57.370
how can you tell somebody how to fight and who's the best fighter ever?

1506
01:32:58.410 --> 01:33:02.410
All right.
That's some really speaking in general terms.

1507
01:33:02.411 --> 01:33:05.950
How about my favorite fighter ever?
My favorite fighter ever.
We're all,

1508
01:33:05.951 --> 01:33:09.580
all the middleweights from the 80s,
except for Sugar Ray Leonard.
I don't know.

1509
01:33:09.581 --> 01:33:14.020
He was just too cute.
I like Tommy Hearns and Marvin Hagler was my favorite.

1510
01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:18.520
I love Roberto Duran.
I like,
I love boxing.

1511
01:33:18.521 --> 01:33:19.930
Back then Alexis are Gwalia,

1512
01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:26.370
Aaron Pryor giving the bottle now the one that I mixed.

1513
01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:31.510
Um,
that's a fight.
Fans.
Um,

1514
01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:37.210
and who else did I like back then?
Larry Holmes.
I liked

1515
01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:43.240
Mike Tyson.
I love,
but he scared the shit out of me.
I like Michael Spinks.

1516
01:33:43.810 --> 01:33:48.220
I like Leon Spinks.
That was it.
There you go.

1517
01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:50.230
Those are the guys I liked.
None of that was funny.

1518
01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:53.620
I'm really boring the shit on myself.
Okay,
let's ratchet up the funny here.

1519
01:33:53.650 --> 01:33:56.980
Number two,
Bill,
you ever come into,
you ever going to come to Dallas?

1520
01:33:57.430 --> 01:34:00.260
How about this?
Are you ever going to come to the show?
When I go to Dallas,

1521
01:34:00.261 --> 01:34:01.540
they go to Dallas every year.

1522
01:34:01.630 --> 01:34:06.610
That's one of my pet fucking peeves is when people send me fucking emails.
Right.

1523
01:34:06.611 --> 01:34:10.090
Like I just got back from Austin and I got a letter this email this week.

1524
01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:15.070
Do you ever call me to Texas?
You know,

1525
01:34:15.071 --> 01:34:18.580
just look at my website.
I got all the dates.
Okay.
And speaking of which,

1526
01:34:18.610 --> 01:34:21.340
I got a slew of dates,
which means a lot.

1527
01:34:21.370 --> 01:34:23.710
I have a plethora of dates.

1528
01:34:23.711 --> 01:34:26.440
I have a fuck load of dates coming up.

1529
01:34:26.441 --> 01:34:31.441
Then I'm gonna be putting up on my website [inaudible] dot com and um,

1530
01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:36.390
yeah,
I'm going to have a whole bunch of dates for a January.
Um,

1531
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:41.470
January,
2009,
right?
Two December,
2009 or as other people like to say 2009.

1532
01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.410
And um,
Houston,

1533
01:34:44.411 --> 01:34:47.650
Texas is going to be there for all you fuckers who keep asking me to come to

1534
01:34:47.651 --> 01:34:50.950
Houston,
even though every time I go there,
11 people show up.

1535
01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:54.970
And you guys with your empty promises.
Do you come out?
I,

1536
01:34:54.971 --> 01:34:59.600
I'm good to bring 20 and I up and there's 18 fucking people and I'm standing up

1537
01:34:59.601 --> 01:35:04.280
there,
you know,
feeling like I'm giving away ruble.

1538
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.721
I'm seriously,

1539
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:08.590
I got a whole bunch of dates coming up and I'm going to be posting them and I'm

1540
01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:13.280
have a trip to Europe and Australia in the works in the work.
So England,

1541
01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:15.590
Sweden,
Norway.
All right.

1542
01:35:15.591 --> 01:35:19.960
Put on your fucking comedy hats cause I'm coming your way and uh,

1543
01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:25.610
also coming to Australia I believe next year.
Anyways,
here we go.

1544
01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:31.220
Continuing on the next question.
What do we got here?
Uh,
but the,
okay,
bill,

1545
01:35:31.221 --> 01:35:35.420
I've subscribed to your podcast on iTunes since the beginning and you are now

1546
01:35:35.630 --> 01:35:37.940
over a day of talking straight.

1547
01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:42.941
You know what I noticed that I've done over 24 hours of podcast minutes anyways.

1548
01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:47.540
How is the podcast affected you since you started it?
Um,

1549
01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:48.540
see I just did that.

1550
01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:54.380
The sentence was how has the podcast affect affected you since you started it?

1551
01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:55.580
And I read it this way,

1552
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:59.690
how has the podcast affected you since you started it?

1553
01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:02.870
That's exactly how I hit this weird pause.
And then I said,
oh my God,

1554
01:36:02.871 --> 01:36:05.630
there's another word.
Because I was already thinking of the answer.

1555
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:09.980
How has it affected me?
Um,
I don't know.

1556
01:36:09.981 --> 01:36:13.850
I think my ability to talk to myself on a phone for 40 minutes has really

1557
01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:17.420
improved.
Um,

1558
01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:22.010
it's helped me with my radio show to the point that I really feel like I could

1559
01:36:22.011 --> 01:36:24.590
do an hour of radio by myself,

1560
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:29.960
just as long as I wasn't in a panic state of,
oh my God,

1561
01:36:29.961 --> 01:36:32.320
there's nobody else in here.
What am I going to talk about half?

1562
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:36.440
As long as I didn't go to that place and I just had a couple of subjects I can

1563
01:36:36.441 --> 01:36:41.441
sort of subject surf through my huge head and uh,

1564
01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.320
you know,
I think it's affected me that way.

1565
01:36:45.321 --> 01:36:49.490
I'm know maybe I can improv a little bit better or maybe the standup has helped

1566
01:36:49.491 --> 01:36:51.950
me,
I don't know.
But,
uh,

1567
01:36:51.951 --> 01:36:55.370
I've had a lot of people come up to me and shows and tell me that they now that

1568
01:36:55.371 --> 01:36:57.050
it's on Itunes,
that,
you know,

1569
01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:00.370
they listen to it at work or they have like a designated time when they listened

1570
01:37:00.371 --> 01:37:02.060
to it and they've gone back.

1571
01:37:02.061 --> 01:37:06.050
And I had one person tell me one night they sat there and they listened to like

1572
01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:08.720
all the way back to the summertime,

1573
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:11.570
stayed up for like six hours listening to my podcast,

1574
01:37:11.571 --> 01:37:14.480
which was really flattering because I think I'm boring as shit a lot of the

1575
01:37:14.481 --> 01:37:18.280
times.
Look at me searching for a compliment now you are,

1576
01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:22.550
you're not boring,
blah,
blah blah.
Um,

1577
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:25.950
no,
I think it's been a great thing and it's something that,
uh,

1578
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.850
last week when I did the very special one and I had Joe to Rosa,

1579
01:37:28.851 --> 01:37:32.650
I think I'm going to be doing more of those.
I enjoy,
uh,
I dunno,

1580
01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:35.750
I like working with other people in problem with them fucking around.

1581
01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:40.850
And if I could figure out a way to block my,
uh,

1582
01:37:41.690 --> 01:37:42.580
my podcasts,

1583
01:37:42.610 --> 01:37:46.310
maybe I could do one where I could actually call someone a regular listener

1584
01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.140
or have somebody call in.
I don't know how the fuck I could do,

1585
01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.440
but then it would just be awkward.

1586
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:55.230
I always feel like that those things never live up to the hype.

1587
01:37:55.231 --> 01:37:58.470
Someone's like all excited and then it just turns into that member that Chris

1588
01:37:58.470 --> 01:38:02.190
Farley character they used to do,
you know,

1589
01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:06.530
the really bad interviewer or he would just be like interviewing Paul Mccartney

1590
01:38:06.531 --> 01:38:10.170
and be like,
I remember,
I remember the time when it's time you guys,

1591
01:38:10.171 --> 01:38:14.840
you guys did the sergeant pepper pepper album and then Paul Mccartney,

1592
01:38:14.841 --> 01:38:17.580
he's like,
yeah,
yeah,
I do remember that night.

1593
01:38:17.970 --> 01:38:21.000
And he just feel like that was awesome.

1594
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:24.810
Like I worry that it will just become that like a fucking staring contest.
I,

1595
01:38:24.811 --> 01:38:27.000
you know,
I actually worry,
I worry that would actually,

1596
01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:32.420
the podcast would be as bad as the awful recreation of that Chris Farley bid.

1597
01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:35.730
Did you like my really bad English accent than I did in there?

1598
01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:40.290
It was so bad that I literally had to throw in mate at the end of it so you'd

1599
01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:43.350
know that Oh,
he is doing an English accent.

1600
01:38:43.351 --> 01:38:48.000
I thought he just raised his voice and octaves.
Okay,
let's,

1601
01:38:48.001 --> 01:38:50.730
let's plow ahead.
Okay.
Well,
um,

1602
01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:53.550
you should start writing a book on your stadium travels.

1603
01:38:53.551 --> 01:38:57.990
You can give yourself the excuse that you're doing it to make money.

1604
01:38:58.170 --> 01:39:02.730
Oh yeah.
Rather than being a loser and get on that new sports soup show,

1605
01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:05.280
you would be excellent on it.
Um,
yeah.

1606
01:39:05.281 --> 01:39:07.950
For those of you who weren't listening in the past couple of weeks,
I'm actually,

1607
01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:12.180
um,
I'm not going home for the holidays.
Thanksgiving,

1608
01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:15.820
I'm not going home on Christmas and I'm not working new years.

1609
01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.080
I'm tapping out fuck the masses.

1610
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:23.610
I'm taking a break and a,
instead,
I'm actually going to Calgary,

1611
01:39:23.611 --> 01:39:28.150
Edmonton and Vancouver with a buddy of mine and we're going to watch,

1612
01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:30.570
I know I'm going to go,

1613
01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:35.780
go fucking go to some hockey games and get absolutely shit faced with their

1614
01:39:36.211 --> 01:39:38.850
extra alcohol beer.
And,
um,

1615
01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:42.930
that's so I'm going to do and people have called me a fag,

1616
01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:48.540
you know,
dual.
How are you doing that?
Where are you,
you know,

1617
01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:51.150
that kind of stuff.
But I don't care.
I like doing it,

1618
01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:55.770
but I know I'm also a psycho when it comes to,
I have like OCD like big time.

1619
01:39:55.771 --> 01:40:00.330
Like I've so gotten into hockey that I just ordered the NHL package and I am

1620
01:40:00.331 --> 01:40:03.540
literally watching like three hockey games a night.

1621
01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:07.500
Like I watched what the one hockey game that interests me and then I taped to

1622
01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:11.700
others and then I watch them like literally like a fucking assistant coach.

1623
01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:17.160
And uh,
I dunno,
I've been thinking about doing like a book on it,

1624
01:40:17.161 --> 01:40:17.994
but you know something,

1625
01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:21.120
the whole reason why I became a comedian is cause I don't want to have a job.

1626
01:40:21.150 --> 01:40:24.210
I don't want to do work.
I just want to do this.

1627
01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.010
Like I don't prepare for these podcasts.

1628
01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:29.820
I just laid down on the bed and I run my fucking mouth for 45.

1629
01:40:29.850 --> 01:40:32.190
That's how I like doing shit.
I don't like rehearsing.

1630
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:34.170
I don't like organizing shit.

1631
01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:38.400
I don't like coming up with business models and you know,

1632
01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:41.850
I don't want to write a book about my stadium Shit.
I just want to,

1633
01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:46.380
I just want to go to them and get drunk and talk to some,

1634
01:40:46.890 --> 01:40:51.570
the oldest guy I can find with the oldest looking Jersey of the team and to ask

1635
01:40:51.571 --> 01:40:55.600
them,
what was it like years ago when you went to the fucking stadium?
You know,

1636
01:40:55.601 --> 01:40:59.290
like I love going to Pittsburgh and talking to fucking,
you know,

1637
01:40:59.291 --> 01:41:02.380
the guy driving me from the airport.
I look at him like,
okay,

1638
01:41:02.381 --> 01:41:06.880
that guy's like in his fifties so that means 30 years ago he was in his
twenties.

1639
01:41:07.090 --> 01:41:08.950
If I was in my twenties in Pittsburgh,

1640
01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:12.610
I would've gone to three rivers stadium and I would've watched Franco,
Terri,

1641
01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:16.270
Lynn Swann and all those guys.
And I asked him,
do you ever go over there?

1642
01:41:16.271 --> 01:41:19.840
And He'd be law.
Yeah,
it was fucking awesome.
Then you hear these great stories.

1643
01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:24.850
I was at that game,
Fred Biletnikoff from the Raiders and yeah,
you can just,

1644
01:41:24.851 --> 01:41:28.330
I know I whatever.
I'm a fucking nerd.
Okay,

1645
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:31.000
so next question.
I noticed the trend.

1646
01:41:31.001 --> 01:41:34.870
You have a loving to rag on either crazy or stupid people.

1647
01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:40.750
Um,
hold,
Geez,
aren't you perceptive?
Well,

1648
01:41:40.751 --> 01:41:44.770
I noticed you're kind of angry.
I'm going to go on a limb here because of this.

1649
01:41:44.771 --> 01:41:49.771
I was wondering how you feel about Sarah Pailin given the fact that she is both

1650
01:41:50.081 --> 01:41:53.560
of these things crazy and stupid.
I don't think she's stupid.

1651
01:41:53.561 --> 01:41:58.240
I just think she's not ready.
You know,

1652
01:41:58.241 --> 01:42:00.640
I think she's really green.
You know what I mean?

1653
01:42:00.641 --> 01:42:04.930
She's more comes off as somebody David Letterman would,

1654
01:42:04.931 --> 01:42:07.480
would talk to in a bit,
you know,

1655
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:11.440
because they make their own jam and they put it in a jar.
I'll tell you.
Well,

1656
01:42:11.441 --> 01:42:13.270
you know what,
I really don't like.

1657
01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:18.300
I don't like how Obama and John Mccain and all these fucking guys are like on

1658
01:42:18.551 --> 01:42:21.790
ESPN and they're going on Saturday night live.

1659
01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:26.740
And I think it really trivializes what they're doing.
You know what I mean?

1660
01:42:26.770 --> 01:42:27.860
I think,
uh,

1661
01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:31.300
that they should be on shows like meet the press and they should be doing

1662
01:42:31.301 --> 01:42:34.230
debates.
And I think that,
you know,
you know,

1663
01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:36.070
you're not supposed to combine church and state.

1664
01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:40.330
I don't think you should combine political figures and sketch comedy shows that

1665
01:42:40.331 --> 01:42:44.380
make fun of them.
And then they go on there and they're all in on the joke,
like,

1666
01:42:44.381 --> 01:42:46.210
yeah,
yeah,
I'm a fucking idiot.

1667
01:42:47.530 --> 01:42:50.920
That doesn't really make me confidence.
And either Mccain,

1668
01:42:50.921 --> 01:42:55.150
Obama and,
uh,
you know,
I don't know.

1669
01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:57.490
I gotta I gotta tell you something though.

1670
01:42:57.510 --> 01:43:01.210
I really want to get a John Mccain shirt and just wear it around La just because

1671
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:05.920
I love annoying people,
you know?
And uh,

1672
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:06.310
you know,

1673
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:11.310
I just think that would be funny just to have people that can't fucking get this

1674
01:43:12.941 --> 01:43:17.500
John Mccain.
Shit,
shut up.
Why don't you just shut up?

1675
01:43:17.501 --> 01:43:20.590
Why don't you stop?
I just want to give me people's noses.
I can get to wrinkle,

1676
01:43:21.650 --> 01:43:24.480
um,
about tie right now.
I'm gonna tell you I'm,

1677
01:43:24.481 --> 01:43:29.050
I'm voting for Ron Paul and vote for Ron Paul and I don't give a fuck.

1678
01:43:29.170 --> 01:43:32.710
I vote for guys from here on out who questioned the Federal Reserve.

1679
01:43:33.610 --> 01:43:35.920
And other than that,
if you don't do that,
then you're,

1680
01:43:35.921 --> 01:43:40.030
you're just another company guy and I have no use for you.
All right?
Underrated.

1681
01:43:40.031 --> 01:43:42.610
Overrated.
Um,
somebody said,

1682
01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:46.930
oh look at this underrated Doug Davidoff and uh,

1683
01:43:46.931 --> 01:43:51.070
I believe that he's in my top 80 friends there on the page.
Hilarious comedian.

1684
01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:54.680
This Preston says he's underrated.
He's a great and really under,

1685
01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:59.420
under the radar comedian.
So checkout Doug Davidoff everybody.

1686
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:03.830
Um,
and this is a,
I love this one.
Underrated the cable guy.

1687
01:44:04.850 --> 01:44:08.420
It was a good movie.
You know what?
I love that movie.

1688
01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:14.320
I think there's just one too many music montage us.

1689
01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:19.610
You know what I mean?
But I have to admit that I downloaded that song,

1690
01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:24.620
uh,
that hey man,
nice shot when a Jim Carrey goes out,

1691
01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:27.290
you know,
dressed old school with the short shorts and the,

1692
01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:28.710
does he have a headband?
Don't.
Anyways,

1693
01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.980
he puts in the mouth guard and he's playing basketball,

1694
01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:35.390
but there's just one too many of those.
But I loved that movie.

1695
01:44:35.391 --> 01:44:37.280
I thought it was really dark and really creepy,

1696
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:39.710
which is probably why it didn't do as well.

1697
01:44:39.711 --> 01:44:44.150
It didn't perform as well at the box office as they want it to because people

1698
01:44:44.151 --> 01:44:48.440
like to go to the movie theater and forget their problems.
Um,

1699
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:51.410
overrated.
Splenda,
it's disgusting.

1700
01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:54.620
What the fuck is Splenda again?
Is that,

1701
01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:58.000
that stuff that makes Doritos not make you fat but your ass leaks?

1702
01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:04.430
Is that what that is?
Um,
overrated.
Pink Floyd prison tee shirts.

1703
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:08.240
Uh,
it's a great one.
I Love Pink Floyd,
but there,

1704
01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:12.710
there are way too many dumb teenagers wearing that shirt that don't know what

1705
01:45:12.711 --> 01:45:16.880
the hell it is.
And I have to ask you a question person who wrote that in.

1706
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:19.130
When you say they don't know what that is,

1707
01:45:19.131 --> 01:45:22.400
do you mean they don't really know what pink Floyd is or they don't know what

1708
01:45:22.401 --> 01:45:24.110
the prison is?
Cause I got to tell you,

1709
01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:28.340
I've owned dark side of the moon forever and I don't know what the prison means

1710
01:45:28.341 --> 01:45:28.820
either.

1711
01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:33.710
I don't even know what a prison is other than a triangle that makes you go,

1712
01:45:33.711 --> 01:45:38.090
wow man,
look at the colors and freaking out.
Um,

1713
01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:41.450
I do want to tell you this.
I,
uh,
let me,

1714
01:45:41.451 --> 01:45:45.290
let me check the time of the podcast here.
28 minutes.
That's decent.

1715
01:45:45.291 --> 01:45:48.500
We're going to wrap this up at about 30.
That's a good one.
Um,

1716
01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:49.620
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1717
01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:53.520
<v 6>one of the best musical experiences I ever had was I bought pink Floyd.</v>

1718
01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:58.800
God dammit,
the phone's ringing.
And who's this?
Greg Fitzsimmons.

1719
01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:01.200
Hang on a second.
Greg.
Fitzsimmons.

1720
01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:05.650
<v 4>Hello Gregory.</v>

1721
01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:10.760
<v 6>Oh wait a minute.
He pocket dialed me.</v>

1722
01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:12.590
Let me listen to see if he's talking about me.

1723
01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:20.210
Uh,
no,
he's not.
No such luck.
You know what?
And now he's,

1724
01:46:20.211 --> 01:46:22.120
he's going to call me back like 19 times,

1725
01:46:22.121 --> 01:46:25.290
cause I'm the last guy he calls and every time he reaches over,

1726
01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:26.740
just scratch his right ball.

1727
01:46:26.741 --> 01:46:30.760
His left ball is going to hit send on his cell phone and he's going to call me.

1728
01:46:31.450 --> 01:46:34.210
Anyways,
getting back to the,
uh,
pink Floyd,

1729
01:46:34.270 --> 01:46:38.650
a musical experience,
I bought that,
uh,

1730
01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:40.450
I believe on cassette tape

1731
01:46:42.610 --> 01:46:47.610
and I had headphones just like in dazed and confused and I listened to that in

1732
01:46:47.741 --> 01:46:49.230
the dark for the first time.

1733
01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:52.830
That is for all you youngsters out there who are not jaded and as long as you

1734
01:46:52.831 --> 01:46:56.070
haven't watched his face as a death or any of that type of shit is still

1735
01:46:56.071 --> 01:47:00.030
relatively innocent.
Like I was back then pre internet days,

1736
01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:03.180
even though the Internet existed,
but it only existed for fucking nerds.

1737
01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:07.830
I listened to that album in the dark and that album scared the living shit out

1738
01:47:07.831 --> 01:47:10.260
of me.
It's incredible music.

1739
01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:15.030
But that shit with people running down the halls and heartbeats and all that

1740
01:47:15.031 --> 01:47:17.790
type of crap,
that really,
really scared the hell out of me.

1741
01:47:17.791 --> 01:47:22.560
And it's a fucking masterpiece.
So if you get a chance,
get some headphones,

1742
01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:27.330
if you can buy it on vinyl,
off of Ebay,
you know you don't even need drugs.

1743
01:47:27.450 --> 01:47:31.140
That's how good pink Floyd is.
And a,
and then you go,

1744
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:36.840
all right,
the original pink,
pink Floyd and I got a question,

1745
01:47:36.841 --> 01:47:38.070
would you guys want anybody out there?

1746
01:47:38.071 --> 01:47:39.840
Would you like to hook up with that girl pink?

1747
01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:42.730
There's something really hot about her.

1748
01:47:42.731 --> 01:47:47.400
But then she's also kind of built like a full back
like you know,
like she,

1749
01:47:47.401 --> 01:47:50.850
I dunno
not to use the classic,

1750
01:47:50.851 --> 01:47:55.800
I think she rip your Dick off man.
Uh,
anyways,

1751
01:47:55.801 --> 01:47:57.930
that's the podcast for this week.
Half Hour.

1752
01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:59.820
They had gone furniture and back a little bit.

1753
01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:03.480
These podcasts will becoming a little too long,
kind of like jam band shit.

1754
01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:06.270
Um,
so anyways,

1755
01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:11.160
I'm going to be at the Improv in Washington DC this week.
Uh,

1756
01:48:11.190 --> 01:48:14.730
the eighth ninth,
I can't even fucking read it,

1757
01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:19.710
cause know the sixth,
seventh and 8th of November.

1758
01:48:19.770 --> 01:48:22.080
And uh,

1759
01:48:22.110 --> 01:48:25.680
the following week I'm going to be uninformed tour with Joe to Rosa.
Once again,

1760
01:48:26.190 --> 01:48:30.850
we'll be at Nashville's Nashville common disease in Nashville to,

1761
01:48:30.851 --> 01:48:35.310
I can't read November 13th,
14th and 15th.
Um,

1762
01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:39.090
just click on the link if you're on the mindspace page,

1763

1764
01:48:44.581 --> 01:48:49.020
link.
Please keep the questions coming.
Please keep underrated,
overrated coming.

1765
01:48:49.021 --> 01:48:50.700
And please answer my question.

1766
01:48:50.730 --> 01:48:55.560
What a a prism is and what the fuck it is,
whatever that triangle is,

1767
01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:57.330
I don't fucking know.
All right.

1768
01:48:57.331 --> 01:49:01.320
Now I've got a headache and I've lost total momentum on this podcast.

1769
01:49:01.321 --> 01:49:05.670
It's not funny anymore and it needs to fucking stop.
All right,

1770
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:09.780
everybody go out and vote tomorrow.
Go with your gut and a,

1771
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:12.480
actually try to read the questions.
That's what I'm going to do today.

1772
01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:17.600
You know those stupid little science people have voted no on a man and then you

1773
01:49:18.241 --> 01:49:21.810
keep a running tally.
Wow.
Everybody keeps saying vote nos.
And then you vote no.

1774
01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:25.920
And you read that little paragraph.
Can anybody explain to me why those,

1775
01:49:25.950 --> 01:49:28.200
when they have those questions,
it's never clear.

1776
01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:33.420
It's always no means yes and yes means no.
You know what I mean?
It's like,
why?

1777
01:49:33.421 --> 01:49:36.780
Why can't they just fucking just say what the questions mean?

1778
01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:39.810
Why can't we just live in a perfect world?
Hey Bill,

1779
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:42.750
why don't you just shut the fuck up and in the podcast?
All right.

1780
01:49:42.751 --> 01:49:46.620
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'll talk to you guys next Monday.
Um,

1781
01:49:46.650 --> 01:49:50.380
that is God bless all you.
And uh,
they,
the time.

1782
01:49:50.381 --> 01:49:53.050
Next week we'll have a new president.
Isn't that exciting?

1783
01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:57.400
Someone who can make a speech.
All right.
Who are you voting for?

1784
01:49:57.401 --> 01:49:59.590
The white guy or the off white guy.
Thank you.

1785
01:49:59.710 --> 01:50:03.700
I'll be at the fucking DC Improv this week.
Please come out to the show.

1786
01:50:03.870 --> 01:50:05.080
All right,
mother fuckers.

1787
01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:06.631
<v 5>Have a good week.</v>

1788
01:50:06.631 --> 01:50:11.631
So,

1789
01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:21.400
so

1790
01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:02.820
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1791
01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:48.710
uh.
