00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.060
Hey,

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:05.400
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.323
<v 1>Dan,</v>

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.280
<v 0>just checking in on you,</v>

5
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.600
seeing how your week's going as you slogging your way through your cubicle life,

6
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.020
something you never wanted,
you know,
but who are you going to blame?

7
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.130
You can't blame society like all of these people on social networks.

8
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.940
Is it ever their fault?
Anyways,

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.570
I have a special guest as promised on the Monday morning podcast.
I said,

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.780
God damn it.
And I delivered.
We have the amazing,

11
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.080
the unbelievably talented and hilarious Bill Hader,

12
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.060
star of the new incredible show on Hbo,

13
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.860
Barry Starring Henry Winkler.
Stephen Root.
I was my cheat sheet,

14
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:47.280
which was the one place your girlfriend,
she crushes it.
Sarah Go,
oh my God,

15
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:50.190
she's amazing.
Yeah,
she's,
she's amazing.
She's amazing.
And uh,

16
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.460
it's eight incredible episodes.
Thank you.

17
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.470
I saw the first two and then my link expired and then I couldn't get it to play.

18
00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:00.960
I got a new link and then I melted down and my wife said,

19
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:01.930
you're bringing tension.

20
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.760
<v 1>That was,
that's been my experience so far.
But having said that,</v>

21
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.880
I absolutely loved,
loved the first two weeks

22
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.030
<v 0>that I saw.
And there's another ad,
the other actor,
they with the alopecia there.</v>

23
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.800
Uh,
Anthony.
Yeah,
Anthony Carrigan.
Oh my God,
no hoe.
Hank [inaudible].
Great Name.

24
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.690
Incredible actor.
So,
um,
I was actually tips to give people background.

25
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.400
I was going to interview all of you guys at the now defunct nerd melt.

26
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.610
Yeah.
That's gone because of that incident I believe.
Yeah.

27
00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:35.700
Because what happened to me,
hey,
yeah.
So you,
you,

28
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:38.640
you were supposed to come down there with 10 re Steven and uh,

29
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.380
the other guys and uh,
you have a peanut allergy,
has a nut allergy and they gave,

30
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.870
they gave me,
well,
here's the thing,
it's my own.

31
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.050
I blamed myself so I can have almonds.
I'm okay with almonds,

32
00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:53.440
but all the other nuts I'm bad with.
So like all of coffee and Oh,

33
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:57.010
can I have almond milk in it?
And again,
like a racist,
but with just like nuts.

34
00:01:57.011 --> 00:01:57.844
Right.
Just nuts.

35
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.040
<v 1>No.
So those are the,
you stay with your own,
you stay with the almonds.</v>

36
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:07.000
All of these other ones.
Get them out of my house.
All right,
here,

37
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.180
you're a peanut supremacy.
I've never heard of that.

38
00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:13.490
I thought if you had like a peanut allergy,
I

39
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.840
<v 0>found that out on a movie.
I had something and Whoa,</v>

40
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.210
that has almonds in it and I had it and I go,
I'm fine.

41
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:23.211
And then I went home and I did an Epi pen and sat there with almonds and ate it

42
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.290
and empty pin.

43
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.130
That's what you take in case you haven't jabbing motion and to do what I do is

44
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:33.350
stabbing motion into,
you're like,
yeah,
I stat you stab yourself with the Epi pen.

45
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.720
So it takes what?
Like your blood pressure.
So like no,

46
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:39.540
it just shoots you full of adrenaline basically and then you just,

47
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.990
you're able to breathe.
It gets a big shot of that.
So when you drank the,

48
00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:46.830
so you were supposed to come in and all of a sudden somebody basically gave the

49
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:50.250
equivalent to you of a couple of days.
They gave me will almond milk,

50
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:54.400
but it was this fancy coffee place and they were like,
well we have an almond.

51
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.930
The cashew blend that comes in.
I can't have cashews.

52
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.540
So I had that and I took a drink of it backstage,

53
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:06.010
excited about to go on and I went,
I got to go.
When you drink that,

54
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.830
how quick do you know it's like getting the Cobra?
Yeah,
yeah.

55
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.410
It's like you just know.
You're like,
all right,
that wasn't good.

56
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.590
I need the [inaudible].
You don't get,
you don't get bit by a Cobra and go,

57
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:18.940
I'm going to wait.
We can do the 20 minutes.
I can do the podcast.
I'm fine.

58
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.260
My legs all black and blue and I can't really feel my feet anymore.
And Yeah,

59
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:25.870
you bet.
I'm fine.
It was just one Fang.
Yeah,
I'm fine.

60
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:29.420
And my dad was the biggest bomb.
It was.
My Dad's a giant fan of yours.

61
00:03:29.421 --> 00:03:31.000
So my dad was really excited too.

62
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.750
And he flew in because we had the premiere and so he wanted to see it and I go,

63
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.890
I gotta go.
And he was like,
what?
Oh,
no.
And he's like,
he goes,
you're fine.

64
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.510
Shake it off.
And I go,
no,
no,
no.
And he's like,
you're fine,
you're fine.
I go,
what?

65
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.630
I want to see bill burr?
And I'm like,
well,
I gotta go,
I gotta go.

66
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.180
You can stay here,
go.
And he's like,
oh,
I'll go,
you know,

67
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.310
let's get you some Benadryl and all that stuff.
Okay,
so,

68
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.690
so what happens is you with your throat closes up guy.

69
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.070
Someone ran out and got me Benadryl and that,
that was fine.
And then I got home.

70
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:04.840
Did he plan bad is like how much are you laboring?
Breathing?
I'm breathing fine.

71
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:06.030
It's just like I,

72
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.310
it was in my mouth for only a couple of seconds and then I spit it out.

73
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.370
But it was enough to make everything start to kind of,

74
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:19.810
it was like hives inside your mouth and your throat.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
It was awful.

75
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.340
When you take the Benadryl,

76
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:24.250
how long does it take that out and then you get groggy.

77
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.840
And then I did the Epi pen,
which then makes you all jacked up.

78
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:32.460
And then I went and did the premiere and yeah.
Sucks.

79
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.980
I'll see you [inaudible] worked on that night.
Yeah,
I had to,
yeah.

80
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:38.410
It was like HBO was like,
we need you.

81
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.650
So do you travel when you travel?
Do you have those things with you?

82
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.050
At my backpack out right there.
Yeah.
And that's the whole reason I yeah,

83
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.060
you can go.
Yeah.
You get a
prescription for it.
Yeah.

84
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.650
Cause like the writer's room on f is the family,
you know,

85
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.970
when you just get like burned out,
like I can't think of any more funny shit.

86
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.870
Epi Pen.
Just stab you.
Yeah,
let's just do Epi pens.
Yeah.
Well No,

87
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:08.770
it's like this dumb thing though.
When you do it,
everyone thinks it's,
but it's,

88
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:12.070
it's,
it's just more,
the motion of it looks more severe than it actually is.

89
00:05:12.071 --> 00:05:15.640
It's just like a little pin prick,
but it's like buried into this.

90
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:17.460
You go through your pants.
No,

91
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.490
you kind of pull your pants down and go right on your leg and then,
but uh,

92
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.180
so you stab it and then you push,
push the thing down at the same time.
Yeah.

93
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.080
You can't tell me you don't feel a little bit like John Rambo when you do.
Yeah.

94
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.940
No,
you totally do.
Yeah.
You station yourself up.

95
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.280
That's awesome.
But I'm such a wimp that,
um,
you know,

96
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.870
I want you to know you not being there really threw me off my game because I've,

97
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:44.380
I've never hosted one of those before.
So it was an honor that I got to do it.

98
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.730
And one of my goals was like,
I was just like,

99
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.750
I am not asking Henry Winkler about playing Arthur funds are rally right.

100
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.130
I am going to,
if I'm going to do anything,
I'm going to talk about night shift.

101
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.040
I left you and

102
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.290
<v 1>nothing,
which,
and then by the end I was just like,</v>

103
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.410
they were helping me through the interview and then somehow I just said,

104
00:06:07.411 --> 00:06:10.620
I go,
you know,
I'm running out of stuff,
but my goal is,
is I'm not bringing up,

105
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.970
you know,
who,
and then he just broken to the character.
Just say it like,
you know,

106
00:06:14.971 --> 00:06:17.370
that character maybe a lot of money and put my kids through college.

107
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.820
I can't do the fonts.
And then I was all excited.
Like,
oh my God,

108
00:06:20.821 --> 00:06:22.580
he did the fonts and he does it.

109
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.080
<v 0>You.
It's like the,
it's like,
uh,</v>

110
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.440
you know Mickey Mouse showing I have John Malaney said it's like Mickey mouse

111
00:06:28.441 --> 00:06:30.450
showing up or something.
It's like a thing I grew up like,
oh,

112
00:06:30.451 --> 00:06:33.360
that's television is character and heal.

113
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.440
He said it to Alec Berg and I once and Alec cocreative Barry,

114
00:06:37.441 --> 00:06:42.441
he's not a very effusive guy and he was standing behind me and Henry told this

115
00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:44.130
story.
We're getting emotional.

116
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.080
<v 1>Yeah,
he's,
he's,
he's Swedish.
Neither of my Swedish</v>

117
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.150
Swedish,
you know,
it's like,
Oh,
I've done stand up.

118
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.480
I've done staying up through the hole.
Uh,
that whole region up there.

119
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.900
Finland was the funniest one.
Well,
I would just sitting there,

120
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:02.140
they were trying to solve the problem of the jail.

121
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.970
Like I would sit there and I'm doing the joke and it was just quiet and quiet

122
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:09.800
and quiet.
And then if somebody is just fine,
it goes,

123
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.520
why didn't you just blah blah blah.
And I was just like,

124
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.670
is that what you fucking guys are doing?
I go,
you don't need to solve these.

125
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:18.110
This isn't like a self help thing.

126
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.320
It's just she'll just kick your wife out of the house.
Yes.

127
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.720
Battery out in the backyard and say she went to a mother's going to do that.

128
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.300
Yeah,
that was Finland go by.

129
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.690
Definitely noticed it was a huge difference was at the Baltic Sea,

130
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:38.290
like Norway and Sweden as a certain level of emotionally disconnected and then

131
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:44.711
when you go to the over there with this spoon with Russia and they actually

132
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:49.100
defeated Russia and had to give up part of their land because they paired up

133
00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:51.450
with Hitler and that was it,
you know?
Yeah.
They had,

134
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.370
they would between the two craziest people in the last century.

135
00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.050
It's like who went to the crazier one?
Which who lost.
Yeah.

136
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.560
Don't ever go there.
I don't know if he,
they went to the crazy one.
They,
they,

137
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.400
they were equals they were peers.
They were
like,

138
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:10.660
if there was a way that they both could have won the war and lived,
yeah.

139
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.220
I guess the other guy lived right style live.
I don't know shit about history.

140
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.980
Like they could sit back,
like,
you know,
old NBA players,

141
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.500
like when wilt and Bill Russell get together,

142
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.530
they could be talking about murdering people and their knees are bad.

143
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:25.910
They can't really walk around much.
They're exaggerating their stats.
Yeah.

144
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.770
But no,
they,
yeah,
it was this,
yeah,
no,
Alec is that

145
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.340
<v 0>hilarious.
I mean,
he wrote on Seinfeld and curb your enthusiasm.
He's,</v>

146
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.770
he's a very funny guy,
but he's not,
he's very kind of quiet and,
and uh,

147
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:43.180
Henry did the Fonz,
he just told a story and I said,
Oh,

148
00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:44.800
I had to tell all these people,
you know,

149
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.710
because Henry and life is very kind of hello.

150
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.900
<v 1>Oh,
that's what makes it when you meet them or you see him just taught.</v>

151
00:08:50.901 --> 00:08:53.660
And that's what makes it even more incredible because that guy came out of this

152
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:55.990
guy.
Yeah.
He's like,
I was on the phone in

153
00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.640
<v 0>my car,
hands free.
And I'm like,
okay,
being safe,
being safe.</v>

154
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.700
And then you know,
and then it'd be like,
Oh,
you know,
the funds would say,
hey,

155
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.510
but like the Red Sea,
you know,

156
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:10.120
he would do something and Alec was behind me and he went,
oh my God.

157
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.460
It was the most,
he just went,
I can't,
I can't believe why he,

158
00:09:15.461 --> 00:09:18.900
it was the most diffusive I've ever seen Alex.
He just went,
oh,

159
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.930
I can't believe that.
It gave us chills,
you know?
Well,
because it,
it it like,

160
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.520
like you said,
when you talked to the guy,
it's nowhere.
It's like Mel Blanc.

161
00:09:27.521 --> 00:09:29.890
When Mel Blanc with voices like you,
you'd be like this,

162
00:09:29.891 --> 00:09:32.650
there's no way this guy does bugs bunny or does you send me Sam?

163
00:09:32.651 --> 00:09:36.880
I couldn't hear him.
In any event,
I feel like with him when he's just talking,

164
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.930
it's just like this can't be the guy that played that guy and all of a sudden he

165
00:09:40.931 --> 00:09:43.670
does the voice.
This is hilarious.
Now I'm going to sit here and talking about it.

166
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.350
<v 1>Fonts for this whole of an interview.
Sorry,</v>

167
00:09:47.351 --> 00:09:50.770
I left you with nothing though because I left and then you were stuck with that.

168
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.000
It sounds to me like you blew off the interview and I'm not buying this whole

169
00:09:55.001 --> 00:09:59.170
fucking stab and yourself than some,
you made the fire.
It was a premiere.

170
00:09:59.171 --> 00:10:03.380
There was no,
there was no fucking nerd melts.
Talk Taco,

171
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.900
some jackasses podcast.
I get it.
Those supermodels,

172
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.600
<v 0>he's be Oprah premiere for Barry.
No,
it was all like cast group.
Who does checks?</v>

173
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:16.690
They weren't done.
How have they were working there?
No,
no,
but I,
they had me,
um,

174
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:17.901
no,
I,

175
00:10:17.901 --> 00:10:21.120
that was a thing where it was one of those things when you leave and then Hbo is

176
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:25.320
going,
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Well,
you know,
the thing is,
it's his show.
You gotta,

177
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.070
you know gotta be,
well,
what do we got to,
can we send a doctor over there?

178
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:30.660
Can we do anything?
What can we do?

179
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:33.900
And they're going old school sending hookers and eight balls.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

180
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:35.940
yeah.
This is Dr feelgood and yeah,

181
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.080
<v 1>it's my Bajic briefcase.
All right.
You're going to be up in no time</v>

182
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.100
<v 0>dining buddy.
Well,
everybody I know that has been watching.
It is just been like,</v>

183
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.670
you know what I love about it and what I wanted to talk to you about is I love

184
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.970
when somebody that's known for doing comedy gets to do some drama stuff because

185
00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:56.500
for some reason they think that a,

186
00:10:56.501 --> 00:10:59.440
I don't know who the comedian was that screwed it up for the rest of us.

187
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:04.600
I want to know who that person was and also who the person was that fucked up so

188
00:11:04.601 --> 00:11:08.050
bad that we all actors now have to get there like nine hours before you're going

189
00:11:08.051 --> 00:11:08.270
to get

190
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:12.320
<v 1>call.
You just sit there with a fake mustache glued on your face.</v>

191
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.360
It's just like,
who fucked up?

192
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.960
Who fucked up fatty Arbuckle?

193
00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:20.550
Who wasn't five fatty Arbuckle just was always,

194
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.510
was this 20 minutes you had 30 hours late,

195
00:11:23.511 --> 00:11:26.240
30 hours lights and now they got to bring you in.
Got to get the Arbuckle rule.

196
00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:29.010
I want all these assholes here.
Now at my worst,
ma'am,

197
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.480
<v 0>my worst one ever,
I got called,</v>

198
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:34.290
I was went to a set at four o'clock in the afternoon and I didn't work.

199
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.960
Didn't utter a word until one in the morning.
Oh,

200
00:11:36.961 --> 00:11:41.340
I've done that where I got called on a,
I remember a tropic thunder.

201
00:11:41.341 --> 00:11:45.630
There was this huge a party scene and it was just one of those things where I

202
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:49.340
just learned that it's all communication where Ben Stiller's directing and Ben

203
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.560
and Ben,
I think he kept saying,

204
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.420
Rob Character's name is rob,
but there's also an actor named rob.

205
00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.670
And he was like,
rob should be in there.
Right.
You know,
and the first aid d went,

206
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:06.410
oh,
Bill's bill's not working day.
So they would wake me up,
oh,

207
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.100
call me flying the colony in.

208
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.170
I would go in at two in the morning and does that in wherever,

209
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.980
shooting like Hawaii or something.
And I'd go in,
put me in makeup,

210
00:12:15.981 --> 00:12:19.430
and I would just sit in my trailer.
And then finally I get tired,
you know,

211
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.920
kind of like,
what am I doing?
You know,
and I'm not in the scene.

212
00:12:21.921 --> 00:12:24.920
And so I would go to set and Ben would go,
the fuck are you doing?

213
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.130
<v 1>And then two days later,</v>

214
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.450
<v 0>hey,
we need you to come in.
What's going on in that?
Well,
what are you doing here?</v>

215
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:34.760
And he goes,
no,
Rob,
rob the actor,
rob,
not the fuck,

216
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:39.720
<v 1>you know.
And I showed up twice.
Oh,</v>

217
00:12:39.721 --> 00:12:43.350
it was terrible.
Waiting in those trailers.
I actually understood my dog more.

218
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.680
Yeah.
I was just thinking why does this same fucking sleep all the time?

219
00:12:46.681 --> 00:12:49.290
And it's basically,
if you have nothing to do,

220
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.180
it goes back to sir survival where it's like we're gonna shut down your body and

221
00:12:54.181 --> 00:12:56.970
just store it this energy.
So like the level of tired you get.

222
00:12:56.971 --> 00:13:00.300
But how does my dog,
no,
every episode of the Tyra banks show,

223
00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:02.430
cause that seems to be the only thing on television

224
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.110
or do you go to the trailers?
I've never had the TV work.
It's always like,
oh,

225
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.440
they're going to flat screen TV and hearing it and it never works.

226
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:12.510
It's just like whatever's signal.

227
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.950
You just hear the other actor next to you clearing their throat every couple of

228
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:21.780
hours.
Yeah.
On the phone with their agent.
I,
uh,
I'm not going to do that.

229
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.510
They want me to do this.
I'm not going to do it.
Well let's,

230
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:29.550
let's promote it a little bit here because,
uh,
uh,
as far as like,
it's on Hbo.

231
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.820
Okay.
The final episode is this Sunday.
Yeah,
there's eight of them.

232
00:13:32.821 --> 00:13:35.220
And if people want to go back and watch all of them,

233
00:13:35.221 --> 00:13:38.790
I imagined in 2018 HBO has a way to,
yeah,

234
00:13:38.791 --> 00:13:43.350
I was saying in an HBO go you,
if you have that you can go check it out.

235
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:47.820
And I think,
uh,
Amazon,
Hulu,
those places,
well I'm old school in that.

236
00:13:47.821 --> 00:13:52.350
I like to watch an episode.
I liked the old way.

237
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.710
Well you watched it and then you had to wait a week for it to come out and then,

238
00:13:55.711 --> 00:13:58.990
and then another one went and,
and like,
like,
um,

239
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:00.950
<v 0>I don't know</v>

240
00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:01.970
<v 1>all the shows that I watch,</v>

241
00:14:01.971 --> 00:14:04.880
you try to guess what was going to happen and now like there's all these great

242
00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:08.300
shows that just dump it on.
People just sit down.
It's like,

243
00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.420
it's like the greatest bottle of wine ever.
And you like shotgun.

244
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.500
It was amazing.
And then like what else can I have now?
And it's just,

245
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.540
and I also have,

246
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:21.140
I feel for like the amount of work that was put into this because that's what

247
00:14:21.141 --> 00:14:23.840
happens with the fucking cartoon I'm doing,
which just this,

248
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.410
I actually did a cartoon after because of those getting called at four in the

249
00:14:27.411 --> 00:14:30.980
afternoon,
not work until one.
I'm like,
dude,
fuck this live action shit.

250
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.460
I'm going to do a car to,
why?

251
00:14:32.461 --> 00:14:35.690
Just show up in a baseball hat and sweatpants and I didn't realize that it was

252
00:14:35.691 --> 00:14:40.370
like 90 times slower and then the thing comes out and people will watch it all

253
00:14:40.371 --> 00:14:43.160
in one night.
That's great.
When's the next season coming out?
It's just like,

254
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.120
I can't,

255
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.280
<v 0>well,
might as well just be a movie.
You know what I mean?
It's like,
Oh,</v>

256
00:14:47.281 --> 00:14:48.390
put it in the theater.
I don't know.

257
00:14:48.391 --> 00:14:52.940
But I like it that you do this and then for eight weeks people are talking

258
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:56.940
about,
there's like a level of a high intensity level of

259
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.620
ego.
I have no idea where this is going to go.

260
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.990
It's fun having people come up to me,
you know,

261
00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:09.110
my kid's school or whatever going,
hey,
so this is what's going to happen,
right.

262
00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.100
If I'm going to kill you.
Yeah.
One guy came up and he was like,
Stephen Root.

263
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:17.540
He's a figment of his imagination.
Right.
It's not real.
Oh yeah.

264
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:21.400
He might be right.
You know,
I got you figured out ass all right.
Yeah.

265
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.460
I used to watch lost.
I know where you're going with this.
Yeah.
The,

266
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:29.210
it's all figments of a,
some mouse as imagination,
right?
Yeah.

267
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:34.370
It's all a figment to get eight seasons or whatever the hell it is.
But anyway,

268
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.570
you know,
something I actually,
uh,

269
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.770
something I want to bring up before I forget is that,
you know,
uh,

270
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.600
that you're from Tulsa,
Oklahoma,

271
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.980
and I was telling you earlier that that is one of my favorite cities to perform

272
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:48.020
standup.
And they got the Brady theater there,

273
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:53.090
which evidently some ridiculous race riot happened.
Really?
I guess so.

274
00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:55.730
I mean,
I walked in,
there was a white guy,
I'm like,
Oh,
this has a nice vibe.

275
00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.720
It just feels like really great.
And that's why is this so comfortable?
Yeah.

276
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.590
And it's,
um,
it's,
and then they've got all this great cause all these,

277
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.930
all these people who'd never been there.
When I told him I'm in Tulsa,
Oklahoma,

278
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:10.700
everybody's was like,
oh Jesus Christ,
you know,

279
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:12.710
what are you gonna fucking go ride a bull out there?

280
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.430
Like go cow tipping and they don't understand like how like the,

281
00:16:16.431 --> 00:16:20.120
the food there is incredible massive amounts of hipsters.

282
00:16:20.121 --> 00:16:22.730
It's the exact opposite thing that you would a picture.

283
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:25.230
But that old theater there.
Yeah.
Guys.

284
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.430
That George Carlin there once I remember there was the first comedy show ever.

285
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:33.020
So what year did you see him?
I don't remember.
I was young.

286
00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:36.410
I remember my dad.
It was a thing where I got to get snuck into the thing,

287
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:41.180
but my dad,
God,
I don't remember how to be in the 80s I saw him the too.

288
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:41.810
Yeah.

289
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:46.370
And I started seeing him and just my face hurting from laughing and just it,

290
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.440
and not knowing that he did like two hours or I don't know what it was.

291
00:16:51.981 --> 00:16:55.730
It was just super long.
But to me,
I was like,
oh,
keep going,
keep going,
you know,

292
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:59.690
and uh,
and just leaving on this high and just going,
wow.
That was,

293
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.260
that have an effect that you like at that point,

294
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:06.500
did you already know you wanted to get into comedy or,
no,
I mean,
I,

295
00:17:06.501 --> 00:17:11.390
to me that just seemed like a,
I mean,
I was so sewing,
I didn't,
I,

296
00:17:11.391 --> 00:17:12.170
and I still,

297
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:16.130
I have very anxious and having to get up in front of people and so I,
I,

298
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.300
the idea of going up there alone and telling jokes and how quick he was,

299
00:17:20.301 --> 00:17:25.301
but I loved watching stand up my dad's giant fan of Stan to stand up and so,

300
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:28.610
and in the 80s and that,
you know,
every TV,
you know,

301
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:33.380
you had the a and e the evening at the Improv.
You the MTV half hour kind hour.

302
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:38.540
Those watches,
I saw those.
I mean,
I would run into like Jeff Garlin and be like,

303
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.673
do you remember used to do the,

304
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:44.420
I think the Adam West Adam West [inaudible] Bagel and he gets hit with a you

305
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.540
half hour comedy on TV.
Yeah.
And he went,
what,
how did,
you know?

306
00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:50.010
And then when I met Judd Apatow for the first time,

307
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.540
<v 1>I go,
you used to do a bit about,
uh,
uh,
you know,
your nose,</v>

308
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.930
uh,
you know,
being stuffed up and how it switches,
you know,
you know,

309
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.730
you get congested in one nostril and goes in a an astrolabe.
Yeah,

310
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:06.680
though I remember that.
Yeah.
But,
uh,

311
00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.800
that's usually I can freak people out.
I remember,

312
00:18:08.801 --> 00:18:09.850
I forget the name of the comedian,

313
00:18:09.851 --> 00:18:13.300
but he had this great bit he was talking about,
I ran into the guy,

314
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.530
I don't even remember his name,

315
00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.860
but I was one of my favorite bits that I saw from one of those evening at the

316
00:18:17.861 --> 00:18:18.311
Improv.

317
00:18:18.311 --> 00:18:22.510
And he was talking about how he was the youngest kid in this big family and how

318
00:18:22.511 --> 00:18:25.450
strict the parents were with the older kids.

319
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.320
And by the time it got down to him,
it was,
uh,
you know,
uh,

320
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.190
it was basically the only rule was no heroin in the living room.

321
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.970
And then one of my favorite tax of all time,
it was just like,
Brian,

322
00:18:35.971 --> 00:18:39.600
you're not using one of the good spoons.
And that was just like,
you know,

323
00:18:39.601 --> 00:18:41.670
for a clean joke and all I really loved,

324
00:18:41.671 --> 00:18:43.200
I got to actually run into him and tell him.

325
00:18:43.201 --> 00:18:46.050
And I remember just talking to that guy and him just looking at me like,

326
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:51.270
how the fuck does this kid,
oh my God,
Bob Nelson,
that guy would,
there was a guy,

327
00:18:51.271 --> 00:18:52.470
Bob Nelson,
I'm a dual crazy.

328
00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.950
And then I saw him open for Rodney Dangerfield right after back to school,

329
00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.380
back to school.
Came out through that summer at great woods,
Eh,

330
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.710
in Mansfield,
Massachusetts.
I saw Rodney Dangerfield.

331
00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:09.540
And then a few weeks later I saw Eddie Murphy on the Rato and the weather girl

332
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.920
weathered girls opened up,
they sing,
it's raining men and they were big girls.

333
00:19:13.921 --> 00:19:15.990
And I remember he came out and was doing all these jokes about,

334
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.990
I got to check out the stage because the weather girls can fuck up the stage

335
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.890
back when you could fat shame people.
And um,

336
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.330
he had like the purple suit on.
And all of that stuff.

337
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:30.190
He always close with his daddy didn't tinker toys and the food,
the,

338
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.030
the toy thing.
Remember that the,
I don't remember what he closed.
I mean,
Eddie,

339
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.580
we would eat our tinker toys.
Any that whole thing that he would do is,

340
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.170
cause that was a thing seeing raw,
which now you watch raw and you're like,
Geez,

341
00:19:43.171 --> 00:19:47.290
there's some stuff you can do now.
But that,
uh,

342
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.960
that and bear to him,
I know,
I know,
but it's just lazy as 30 years ago.

343
00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:56.460
But you go like,
uh,
yeah.
At SNL you would watch something to all,

344
00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:58.770
you guys got to watch raw and then they would come back and go,

345
00:19:58.771 --> 00:20:02.520
why did you find that funny?
It was so offensive and everything and go,
wow.

346
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.480
Oh Man.
You know,
uh,
what about the thing at the end?
You know,

347
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:09.770
I would just try to concentrate on the thing I found.
Oh No.
When I watched that,

348
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:15.140
it makes me sad that he stopped because he was 25 years old.

349
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.580
And,
uh,
when he was talking about,
uh,
you know,

350
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.150
the level success he got to and thinking about getting married and see Johnny

351
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.730
Carson getting divorced and all of that stuff and saying,
well,
you know,

352
00:20:25.731 --> 00:20:27.650
women get half,
that's bullshit.
No,

353
00:20:27.651 --> 00:20:29.840
somebody goes when we get half and then when one goes,
that's right.
And he goes,

354
00:20:29.841 --> 00:20:30.710
Nah,
that's bullshit.

355
00:20:30.711 --> 00:20:34.580
And it was like he was going to that next level where it's like,
oh,

356
00:20:34.581 --> 00:20:36.590
now this guy is going to,
you know,

357
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.630
start saying what he thinks about all this stuff.
Cause you know,

358
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.710
the delirious was amazing,
but it was uh,
you know,

359
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.380
Ralph Kramden having sex with,
you know,
yeah,
yeah.
That stuff,
all that stuff.

360
00:20:47.381 --> 00:20:48.400
And then all of a sudden he was like,

361
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.530
you've seen this guy finding his voice and uh,
and then,
I mean,

362
00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:55.840
who knew that I would go see him and that that was actually like

363
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.220
<v 0>the farewell tour.
Yeah.
Well,</v>

364
00:20:57.221 --> 00:21:01.150
I think when he did the thing at the end of raw was the thing I saw,

365
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:05.080
you know,
as a,
when I was young and it went,
wow,

366
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:10.030
he's just by himself mean you might as well buy.
It'd be by himself in his room.

367
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:14.890
You know what I mean?
It was like he went into this other place,

368
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:19.150
you know?
It wasn't like jokes,
you know what I mean?

369
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:20.320
It was like talking,

370
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.440
he's just talking and he just went to this place and it's the thing I'm never as

371
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:26.651
funny.

372
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:30.850
I the funniest I'll ever be as in the lunch room with my friends and they were

373
00:21:30.851 --> 00:21:32.670
all funnier than me.
You know what I mean?

374
00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.010
I remember in high school with his funny than I was way funnier than me and I

375
00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:39.850
still see those guys and they'll just like,
they'll send me a text about,

376
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.920
one of my friends hated three billboards.

377
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:46.330
That movie and his tax made me laugh harder than anything that I've read.

378
00:21:46.331 --> 00:21:50.020
Any comedian.
I know.
All I do is hang around with comedy people and I'm like,

379
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:54.720
what?
You know,
he works at a windows store and Oklahoma someplace.

380
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:55.750
It was so funny

381
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.450
<v 1>or just how they live their life.
I got a buddy of mine,
uh,</v>

382
00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.540
Joe Rosa was open and for me and you know,

383
00:22:02.541 --> 00:22:05.250
it was after the show we did in Boston.
I got all my boss,
you know,

384
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.100
hanging out or whatever and uh,

385
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.740
one of my buddies offered to buy a round the drinks,

386
00:22:09.741 --> 00:22:14.741
they're all ordering drinks and my buddy Joe ordered a white Russian and my

387
00:22:15.351 --> 00:22:19.760
friend was just done with him
and he came up and he goes,
dude,

388
00:22:19.761 --> 00:22:22.790
what's up with your boy?
I go,
what's the matter?
He goes,

389
00:22:22.791 --> 00:22:25.490
he just sorted a white Russian and I didn't really think about it.
I was like,

390
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.500
I ain't know he drinks white Russians.
He likes,
you know,
whatever.

391
00:22:27.501 --> 00:22:30.710
That movie with the dude.
He,
he likes to pick the bass.
Yeah,
he's a big Lebowski.

392
00:22:30.711 --> 00:22:31.730
I only think of anything about it.

393
00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.840
And then the end of the night I'm walking back with Joe.
He's just like,
hey,

394
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:37.050
you know,
like hanging out with friends.
He goes,
yeah,
there's cools yet.
He said,

395
00:22:37.051 --> 00:22:37.940
well,
what are you friends was,

396
00:22:37.941 --> 00:22:39.800
he was like really friendly and he was like talking to me.

397
00:22:39.801 --> 00:22:44.060
Then all of a sudden out of nowhere,
he just stopped talking to me.
And it was,

398
00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:49.150
it was all based on the fact that he ordered a white Russian and we were well

399
00:22:49.191 --> 00:22:51.680
into our thirties,
like late thirties.

400
00:22:51.681 --> 00:22:55.780
And this guy still to this day and I remember a long time,

401
00:22:55.781 --> 00:22:58.100
I don't trust that guy.
I don't,
I don't know anybody like that.

402
00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:59.420
I remember a long time ago,

403
00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:02.990
he for some reason was giving the responsibility to watch the house of this

404
00:23:02.991 --> 00:23:05.840
married couple.
And of course he immediately has this all over there

405
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.560
and we're getting hammered and um,

406
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.800
and he's taking care of the house and went down into the basement and there was

407
00:23:12.801 --> 00:23:17.180
some sort of a faucet nozzle is something you had to turn on or off and,
and,

408
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.600
and the lady left the post it note on it saying you might have to,
uh,

409
00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.650
turn it a little hard on.

410
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:24.800
My husband said it's a little fussy and my buddy just went up and just

411
00:23:24.801 --> 00:23:26.650
immediately turned it with no problem at all.
And you just,

412
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.380
you just [inaudible] this guy said

413
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:37.010
we're in his house and he probably,
he just said that to his wife just being,

414
00:23:37.011 --> 00:23:37.490
you know,

415
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:42.490
gentlemanly to a woman and then this might friend just totally judge this guy

416
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.660
that he was,
he was not man like his man.
That's what I love about my friends.

417
00:23:47.661 --> 00:23:51.740
Back to how easily you could lose your man card and you have no idea.

418
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.440
And they won't even tell you why they just stopped talking to you.
Oh,

419
00:23:54.441 --> 00:23:56.120
it's the worst.
When my friends,

420
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.480
they visited the set of Barry and you know,

421
00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:03.540
I'm doing all these things or whatever and I have an assistant,
oh,

422
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.030
it's over.
She walked over,
here's your,
here's your coffee.
Well man,

423
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.670
you can get your own coffees now.
What?
What do you think machines?

424
00:24:13.671 --> 00:24:15.020
The machines right there,
dude,

425
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.690
just go over and get your own God damn coffee bill.
And I'm like,
well,

426
00:24:17.691 --> 00:24:21.350
I'm focusing on,
I don't give a shit.
You go,
bro,
why you making her get your,

427
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.060
and I'm like,
no,
not,
you're right,
you're right.

428
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:26.060
I should be the machines right there.
I don't know.
You're now.
You're right.

429
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.210
You know what I mean?
I just feel like an asshole.
And then I'm like,

430
00:24:29.211 --> 00:24:33.950
why did I invite you here to,
you know,
uh,
make me feel bad and then,

431
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.740
hey man,
did you try the dessert?
I,

432
00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:41.060
and I'm trying not to eat anything bad cause you know the guys in the military

433
00:24:41.061 --> 00:24:45.830
or were like,
oh fuck you man.
Now you're dining now.

434
00:24:45.831 --> 00:24:49.880
And I'm like,
oh hey.
Yeah,
they just keep you real.

435
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:54.920
I and I ended up,
I just go back harder at them.
I can't see,
you know?

436
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.430
Yeah.
We're really trying to work on my man tits.
Like who have the mess?

437
00:24:57.431 --> 00:25:00.350
The only way to keep them off you dude.
I had another friend,

438
00:25:00.351 --> 00:25:05.210
the exact same party he was telling me.
He was telling this story.

439
00:25:05.211 --> 00:25:06.170
He's going,
where are you staying?

440
00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:08.510
I told him the hotel I was staying at p and he was a construction guy.
Goes,

441
00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:11.410
oh I worked on that.
He goes,
crazy story.
We will,

442
00:25:11.411 --> 00:25:15.350
we will put in a flagpole or something up and he goes stiff.

443
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.510
The fucking cable broke.

444
00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:20.000
This guy was underneath directed and that cable broken just came slamming down

445
00:25:20.001 --> 00:25:24.680
on this guy.
Oh Geez.
I go,
Jesus Christ,
I go,
did he die?
And he goes,
did he die?

446
00:25:24.681 --> 00:25:29.390
He was in fucking pieces.
And I co,
well,

447
00:25:29.391 --> 00:25:31.610
what happened?
He goes,
oh guys were puking.

448
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.600
Some people jumped in their truck and drove away and they got,
his dad was there,

449
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:39.170
he had a heart attack.
So we're all just sitting there like dead silence.

450
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.610
And then he just out to know where he goes.
Ah,

451
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.050
kid was kind of a dose and then he goes,

452
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:49.280
he goes to his dad was a good shit and that actually broke the tension.

453
00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:52.910
And everybody started laughing.
And I just remember thinking like,

454
00:25:52.911 --> 00:25:56.270
you couldn't teach somebody no in an acting class.

455
00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:01.000
How to take this somebody to such a dark place.
And he sensed it.
No,

456
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:04.910
he's sense that's a laugh meeting to come.
And he knew exactly where to go.

457
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.050
Intuition.
My friend.
Uh,
I used to be a PA,

458
00:26:09.051 --> 00:26:12.320
I was a production assistant for a long time.
And then I worked on this movie,

459
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:14.360
James Dean and an invented life,

460
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:18.920
or James Franco played James Dean and this Guy Jason Lt Airy,

461
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.250
who's now a big first Aidy now,
but he was a PA.

462
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:26.330
And again,
what we're talking about,
he had a,

463
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:30.260
he had a real like Rambo knife,

464
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.590
like he got it from the props truck and he's just taking chunks out of this tree

465
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:37.240
with it and he's just hitting this tree with his giant knife and we're all kind

466
00:26:37.241 --> 00:26:39.650
of sitting there.
Why?
And he's just bullshitting with us because like,

467
00:26:39.651 --> 00:26:42.080
look at this fucking thing.
Wow.
Look at them like,
look,
it's really,

468
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.310
it's like an ex,
you know,
standing

469
00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.910
<v 0>out.
And this other guy,
Bill Hardy,</v>

470
00:26:47.911 --> 00:26:51.840
this big guy walking over and he's another PA smoke.
Are you guys okay?

471
00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.710
And Jason,
he's weird.
This keys.

472
00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.910
He pretends like he's going to stab him.
He just goes,
hey,
hey,
hey,
don't fuck it.

473
00:26:59.911 --> 00:27:03.120
That's not funny.
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
That's not cool.
Don't do that.

474
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.650
So bill walks away,
the props guy comes over and goes,

475
00:27:07.651 --> 00:27:12.360
I have that same knife but it's the exact same knife but it's retractable,

476
00:27:12.361 --> 00:27:15.180
it's plastic,
it's fake,
you know,
and he goes,
get it to me.

477
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.130
He takes it and he does the best piece of acting I've ever seen.

478
00:27:20.131 --> 00:27:24.960
Just totally calm pretending to like,
you know,
cut it the tree,
do everything.

479
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:28.740
Just waiting for bill to come back.
Bill walks back,
hey,
how's it going?

480
00:27:28.741 --> 00:27:30.420
Hey how you doing?
And he does the,

481
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.250
does the thing again and then just rears back and stabs him in the

482
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:38.690
<v 1>just saw God and bill goes,
why?</v>

483
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.810
His reaction was why you just murdered

484
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.190
flesh.
He legitimately was like,
my friend just murdered

485
00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.010
<v 0>all down laughing and we felt bad.</v>

486
00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:02.530
And I've told that story to other people on the go,
that's horrible.

487
00:28:02.531 --> 00:28:05.800
That's not nice at all.
And I go,
I know,
but if you were there,

488
00:28:05.801 --> 00:28:08.020
it was the funniest thing I think I had ever seen.

489
00:28:08.021 --> 00:28:10.550
And because you're literally got to see,
what would your friend do,

490
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.860
what would he do if he died?
He would say,
why if he got murdered.
But then Jason,

491
00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.160
to your point,
the reason I thought of it was that he was such a good actor.

492
00:28:18.161 --> 00:28:21.340
He was just like,
you couldn't have taught like anybody else.

493
00:28:21.341 --> 00:28:23.500
I think you would get it and they would want to run over to him and go,
hey,

494
00:28:23.501 --> 00:28:25.430
look in the night.
And then,
you know what I mean?
But I wouldn't,

495
00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.880
I would have taken the knife and walked up to him and done it.

496
00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:32.980
But he had the patience to keep like,
no,
no,
I have to keep this,
this,

497
00:28:32.981 --> 00:28:33.820
this lie up.

498
00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.810
Or he was pretending to do that and we sat there waiting for him for like 15

499
00:28:37.811 --> 00:28:41.020
minutes and then he kind of would meander back like,
no,
we can't call him over.

500
00:28:41.021 --> 00:28:43.750
We can't do this.
You know,
I wouldn't be able to keep a straight face.

501
00:28:43.751 --> 00:28:45.610
I'm going to war first.
Hey,

502
00:28:45.611 --> 00:28:48.760
when you watch somebody do something like that as an actor,

503
00:28:48.761 --> 00:28:52.750
do you get something out of that?
Watching a guy like that?
Yeah.
Yeah.

504
00:28:52.751 --> 00:28:53.890
You kind of go,
oh wow.

505
00:28:53.891 --> 00:28:58.891
The patients are so much of it too is just kind of impersonating people are,

506
00:28:59.831 --> 00:29:01.210
you know,
or doing nothing.

507
00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.910
That was the thing he did that was good was he didn't do anything.

508
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:05.561
Do you know what I mean?

509
00:29:05.561 --> 00:29:08.410
He just was doing what he did before and he kind of instinctively knew like,

510
00:29:08.411 --> 00:29:10.540
well that's how,
that's the best way to do this.

511
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:14.020
That's the best way to set the trap is and make it look like nothing happened.

512
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:18.220
Instead of,
I would have gone over there,
I've been,
hey bill,

513
00:29:18.221 --> 00:29:21.850
come back or whatever.
Are those some of your favorite actors?

514
00:29:21.851 --> 00:29:23.130
Are you a character actor guys?

515
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.710
Far as like the guys that you watch because you're acting on the series is,

516
00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.900
is phenomenal.
I can't,
I kept calling,
uh,

517
00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.750
my wife and going,
look,
this is like the bestest,
I'm telling you,

518
00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:36.900
it's like the best work I've seen and I love all the stuff that you've done.
Oh,

519
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.410
but like this to actually,

520
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:42.790
I love it when they give a funny guy a to show that,
hey,

521
00:29:42.791 --> 00:29:46.810
I can do these other things too.
Yeah.
So I was just curious,

522
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:49.960
now that I see that you have that in the toolbox,

523
00:29:49.961 --> 00:29:54.910
like who are some of your favorite actress?
Um,
well,
I mean it's not,
I mean the,

524
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.820
I had a tape that,
this is kind of everybody,
but,
uh,

525
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:02.080
I had a VHS tape that had taxi driver and raging bull on it and I would just

526
00:30:02.081 --> 00:30:06.410
watch those a bunch and just watch Robert Deniro in those movies.
He just does,

527
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:10.270
it's kind of what retirement,
he doesn't do much,
but he did enough,
you know,

528
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:15.220
it was like he just,
the way my,
it was behavior,
but to be honest,

529
00:30:15.221 --> 00:30:18.250
like I like,
uh,
you know,
uh,

530
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.180
um,
I like a lot of actors,

531
00:30:22.181 --> 00:30:26.770
but I was always more excited by the story.
I might watch a movie for a story,

532
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:32.080
but to me it's just more,
it's more about observing behavior of people.
You know,

533
00:30:32.081 --> 00:30:36.730
you watch like a documentary or I'd watch a guy like Jason l tre do that thing

534
00:30:36.731 --> 00:30:38.050
or whatever,

535
00:30:38.051 --> 00:30:42.550
but it was the actors who could modulate behavior instead of pushing and making

536
00:30:42.551 --> 00:30:46.450
it like a performance,
you know?
Right.
There's a movie called CAS.

537
00:30:46.451 --> 00:30:50.380
It's this British movie from the late sixties and then this is non-actor,

538
00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:55.330
this kid in it who's phenomenal and it just is because it's all just very

539
00:30:55.331 --> 00:30:57.280
genuine.
Right.
You know what I mean?

540
00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:03.430
<v 2>Oh,
okay.
It's time for a little bit of advertising.
Oh,
look who's back.</v>

541
00:31:03.431 --> 00:31:06.320
It's all zip.
Right.

542
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:07.853
<v 3>Screwed up.</v>

543
00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:13.010
<v 2>Talk about the challenges of finding great talent and how the way you went about</v>

544
00:31:13.011 --> 00:31:16.400
it just did not work.
Oh,
was inefficient.
You know,

545
00:31:16.401 --> 00:31:20.540
I tried to dig down deep into myself to try to be a good comedian and it turned

546
00:31:20.541 --> 00:31:24.230
out all I had was a bunch of Shit and Dick Jokes down there and it was really

547
00:31:24.231 --> 00:31:27.890
tough.
And then I use zip recruiter and all of a sudden,
you know,

548
00:31:27.891 --> 00:31:31.940
I started talking about Pussy Toe.
Am I,
my comedy went to I,

549
00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:36.410
I don't fucking hire people,
but I know this app,
this,
this,
is this an APP,

550
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:38.990
this product,
this service.

551
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:39.870
<v 3>Okay,</v>

552
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:44.010
<v 2>let's go with that.
I know it works.
Ziprecruiter knew there was a smarter way,</v>

553
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.810
so they built a platform that finds the right job candidates for you.

554
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.100
These invitations have revolutionized how you find your next hire.

555
00:31:53.101 --> 00:31:53.640
In fact,

556
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.440
80% of employees who post a job on ZipRecruiter get a quality candidate through

557
00:31:58.441 --> 00:32:00.670
the site and just one day and Zip,

558
00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.300
Eh,
uh,
doesn't stop there.

559
00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:10.230
They even spotlight the strongest applications you received so you never miss a

560
00:32:10.231 --> 00:32:12.910
great match.
The right candidates around out there

561
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.470
recruit is how you find them.

562
00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.850
Businesses of all sizes trust ZipRecruiter for their hiring needs.

563
00:32:22.851 --> 00:32:27.650
Right now my listeners can try Xanax.
That's right.

564
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:31.520
They can use it for free.
You can try it for free.

565
00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:35.720
Just go to ziprecruiter.com/bird that's ziprecruiter.com/prayer one more time.

566
00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:36.733
Hi,

567
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:45.440
the smartest way to hire
well coups here.
Oh,

568
00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:49.330
don't do me Andy's beyond days.
I'm sitting near my fucking car.

569
00:32:49.331 --> 00:32:52.680
Bluedot to to me undies.
Me,
Andy's.

570
00:32:52.681 --> 00:32:57.540
I'm driving out to a bar.
I'm going to get hammered at the bar.

571
00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.100
Take your piss and my soft under way.
Am I balls,

572
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.960
a field grade and on diesel.
Dry it up.

573
00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.930
You don't need no more adult diapers.

574
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:12.350
Candies are made with the sustainably sourced material from beechwood trees made

575
00:33:12.571 --> 00:33:14.940
out of trees.
Man,
they're naturally soft.

576
00:33:14.941 --> 00:33:19.350
Fiber makes a fabric that won't sag down or write up.
Trust me,

577
00:33:19.351 --> 00:33:21.150
once you got a pair on,
you'll get it.

578
00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.430
And if you're already part of the me undies family,

579
00:33:23.431 --> 00:33:27.510
tell your friends about it through their referral program though.

580
00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:29.460
It's like Amway,
but with fucking panties,

581
00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.360
they get a discount and you'll get a store credit.
It's a win win.
Me,
Andy's is,

582
00:33:33.361 --> 00:33:37.020
sure you'll love their first pair is so sure you'll love their first pair that

583
00:33:37.021 --> 00:33:37.681
if you're not happy,

584
00:33:37.681 --> 00:33:41.490
they'll do whatever they can to get you the right pair and if they can't keep

585
00:33:41.491 --> 00:33:43.890
them and they'll refund you.
So it's really risk free.

586
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.000
Free to try the best underwear ever.

632
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:40.950
They got a pillow for that to helic sleep has the eye.
That's just a joke.

633
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:44.800
He likes sleep,

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:55.980
They'll have a little elbow indentation on that side of the mattress.

I x.
Sleep

642
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:20.030
<v 1>actors w when they'll,
while I'm playing a new guy,</v>

643
00:37:20.031 --> 00:37:24.710
so the guy can't walk like me and they'll come up with like a walk.
Yeah.

644
00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.000
I don't know those droves it or bring him up again.

645
00:37:27.001 --> 00:37:29.570
And he told him who was talking about John Travolta one time you saw him and

646
00:37:29.571 --> 00:37:31.910
John Travolta was like,
well,
Vinny Barbarino walked like this,

647
00:37:31.911 --> 00:37:34.940
Vincent Vega walk like this.
And it's just like,
dude,
he does the walks.

648
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.520
And I was thinking of the little acting that I've done.

649
00:37:37.521 --> 00:37:42.320
It's like every character I've done walks like me,
they would have to rewrite it.

650
00:37:42.321 --> 00:37:45.290
He's,
he's a serial killer from Boston and he's a,
yeah,

651
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:50.000
he's a Hawaiian guy from Boston.
Yeah.
Cowboy from Boston.

652
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:54.410
I did one where they,
they couldn't justify why it wasn't from the Midwest.

653
00:37:54.411 --> 00:37:58.730
So they said you went to college in Boston and he picked up the accent,

654
00:37:58.731 --> 00:38:00.160
but still,
for some reason he came back here.

655
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.340
He didn't go back to the exit that he used.

656
00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.030
He was raised by some assholes from Boston,

657
00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.540
but in the middle watches a lot of reality TV.

658
00:38:08.541 --> 00:38:11.190
There's always the loud Boston guy.
So,
um,

659
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:16.290
he likes watching interviews with the Mark Wahlberg and yeah,
but he,

660
00:38:16.291 --> 00:38:20.100
he doesn't have,
he doesn't have an accent in Mark Wong.
No.
Yeah.
Like I,

661
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:24.440
I'm always amazed at how,
uh,
forget that he's,
he can,

662
00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:26.870
he can knock that out somehow.
And I've watched some,

663
00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:30.340
like I started out with Patrice O'Neal and Dane Cook and I saw like an old day

664
00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:34.760
and cook standup thing in the last couple of years I saw it and in like the mid

665
00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.100
nineties,
he had really big

666
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.730
<v 0>time.
Boston actually now he doesn't.
Oh Wow.
Like I don't know how,</v>

667
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:42.460
I think you're either one of those people like you just sort of like,

668
00:38:42.461 --> 00:38:43.960
if he gets somewhere new,
you just sort of,

669
00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:48.310
it just floats away or it's just stuck in you.
I think I'm,
I'm sort of,

670
00:38:48.311 --> 00:38:52.120
I mean I don't have to work on it.
Oh yeah.
People work.
That's what a read of it.

671
00:38:52.121 --> 00:38:55.720
People do work on it to get rid of it.
And it's weird.

672
00:38:55.721 --> 00:39:00.490
We have bill Hader here from Eric.
I am going to pronunciate hi.

673
00:39:00.491 --> 00:39:05.270
I'm from Boston,
Massachusetts now I think.
But yeah,
it's weird.
Big where it,

674
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:09.220
but I don't know.
Yeah.
It's like I saw this cooking show recently and this guy,

675
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:12.730
he was doing something,
you know,
this fucking guy's traveling.
He Goes,
Boston,

676
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.450
you come here for a beer and a beating,
and I just moved.

677
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:19.120
I was looking at my life.
I go,
Oh,
you go to look at the foliage.

678
00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.213
<v 1>It's just like,</v>

679
00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:26.520
how many times did you watch good will hunting before you went there to steam

680
00:39:26.521 --> 00:39:30.780
your asparagus that you felt you had to go that hard?
You know,
it's like,

681
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:35.550
there's also MIT,
there's Harvard hate,

682
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.670
tasty,
putting our hasty pudding.
There's a lot of like,
you know,

683
00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:43.620
you could go get some oysters,
oysters,
beer in a beating because they all right.

684
00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.840
I lived there for 27 years.
I never took a PT.

685
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.350
I walked away from fights and I was fine with it.
Yeah,
you're tougher than me.

686
00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.940
Your Dad was angrier than my dad.
You win.
I'm Outta here.

687
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:58.310
Steamier his spirit.
Yeah.
We'll get a little poached egg on top of it.

688
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.060
I fucking hate the flu network now.

689
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:03.570
They used to just have people they're cooking and then teach you how to cook.

690
00:40:03.571 --> 00:40:08.010
And then it became,
you had to have a personality and I,

691
00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:12.750
and I respect his cooking,
but I blamed that fucking emerald.
Luke [inaudible].

692
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.860
He's the guy I'm going to fucking God damn right.

693
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:19.650
And he had a studio audience in a band.
I used to be the,

694
00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:23.510
<v 0>it's an editor and a lot of those shows like iron chef America.
It was a,</v>

695
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.140
<v 1>I don't get it done.</v>

696
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:30.140
Then I can show you supposed to be relaxing and loving thing that you do and

697
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:34.960
they take it.
It's like death.
You got to make waffles.
We got stones and,

698
00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:40.060
and carpet.
How the fuck am I going to do this?

699
00:40:40.061 --> 00:40:43.180
And how the fuck I'm a Mario.
Let's see what you got.
And I'm like,
oh.

700
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.930
We used to have a thing of a Bobby flay,
a lag electric

701
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.210
<v 0>shooting himself.
He accidentally electrocuted himself.
It was really fun.
We did.</v>

702
00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.670
Yeah,
they cut it from the thing,

703
00:40:51.671 --> 00:40:56.230
but he grabbed a ladle and something happened and he just went and just dropped

704
00:40:56.290 --> 00:41:00.220
out of frame.
Oh Shit.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
We hit.
The other thing of him,

705
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.630
it is his heart stopped.

706
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.190
Nobody dropped and then kind of came up in a daze and we were,
uh,

707
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:10.250
<v 1>he always seemed like he had interjection to me because he'd always be like,</v>

708
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:13.730
okay,
today we're going to make,
it's just like,
dude,

709
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:19.130
go off camera and Burp.
Because I liked him.
I like all of those guys.

710
00:41:19.131 --> 00:41:20.940
They all taught me what little I know.
But like I,

711
00:41:20.941 --> 00:41:24.080
I w I used to watch molto Mario [inaudible] all the time,

712
00:41:24.081 --> 00:41:25.160
which to me was the perfect one.

713
00:41:25.161 --> 00:41:28.250
It's like you went over his house and he cooked for you.
Yeah.

714
00:41:28.251 --> 00:41:30.270
It was like being his friend.
Yeah.

715
00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.780
And then all of a sudden it just became like that fucking guy on iron chef.
Yeah.

716
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.100
Or the diners drive ins and dives guy,

717
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:41.020
which is hilarious because like he just looks so burnt out on that show.
Yeah.

718
00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.420
<v 0>What's his name?
A Guy,
Guy Fieri.</v>

719
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:44.890
<v 1>It just says what you're doing.</v>

720
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.580
Like you could make like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Okay.

721
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.830
You'll put some peanut butter on the bread and okay.

722
00:41:50.831 --> 00:41:51.810
And you get some jam in there.

723
00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.720
That's going to take a little edge off the peanut butter and he makes so much

724
00:41:55.721 --> 00:42:00.380
money.
So much money.
Oh my God.

725
00:42:00.381 --> 00:42:03.210
It's the get the hard top.
Cause he's going to die as skin care.

726
00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.030
It looks like a fucking lobster.
This is coming from a redhead.
I'm telling you.

727
00:42:07.031 --> 00:42:10.110
He's got to get some sunblock.
Um,
so what,

728
00:42:10.111 --> 00:42:13.390
what can we talk about about everybody?
Because this is a podcast.

729
00:42:13.391 --> 00:42:17.260
It's not like people are dipping in here.
Yeah.
People know that this show is on,

730
00:42:17.261 --> 00:42:21.930
so they can,
uh,
HBO is their Hbo streaming.net.org.
Yeah,
I mean,
you go to,

731
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:27.610
<v 0>well,
no,
I mean Amazon or Hulu or uh,
uh,
uh,
HBO go is the thing.</v>

732
00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:31.510
I want to be able to go,
yeah,
it's great.
What would be bad for you?

733
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:35.260
Where should they watch it?
Wherever they want.
I don't.
Okay.
I wasn't sure.

734
00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:38.980
Louie had his show on Fx.
It would be like,
you know,
please,

735
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:39.791
can you please watch it?

736
00:42:39.791 --> 00:42:44.130
So I get credit for people like watching the advertiser because everybody would

737
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:48.520
then record it and then fast forward.
I don't know.
I know.
Yeah,
they,
I mean,

738
00:42:48.521 --> 00:42:52.000
to me it's just,
yeah,
just watched hope.
He watched the show.

739
00:42:52.001 --> 00:42:55.660
Hbo Has Been Amazing to work with the fact that we could go in and pitch this

740
00:42:55.661 --> 00:42:59.260
show to them and we're pitching a half hour comedy and the two movies I

741
00:42:59.261 --> 00:43:04.261
mentioned or taxi driver and unforgiven and that's how do they react to it?

742
00:43:05.161 --> 00:43:07.090
Like you coming in and think,
okay it's bill Hader.

743
00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:09.270
This is going to be funny actually and might have is going,

744
00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.630
yeah we come in with this and they go and to their credit they were really

745
00:43:13.631 --> 00:43:14.830
excited about it.

746
00:43:14.831 --> 00:43:18.700
It actually made them more excited than how many places did you,

747
00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:19.780
did you pitch this show?

748
00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:24.340
There's just HBO because I had a deal with them and so I had this kind of

749
00:43:24.341 --> 00:43:25.900
development deal with them and,

750
00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.470
and I was shooting train wreck actually in the whole time I was on a train wreck

751
00:43:29.471 --> 00:43:33.880
going,
what have you know,
what am I going to do?
I have this deal now with Hbo,

752
00:43:33.881 --> 00:43:35.200
but I got to write a show.

753
00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.860
And so I met with Alec Berg and then we came up with this.

754
00:43:38.861 --> 00:43:43.120
And then I remember pitching it to them and thinking,
well,
if they don't like it,

755
00:43:43.121 --> 00:43:45.220
then I'm like,
well,
this is what I would rather want to do it.

756
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:49.990
If I could do anything,
I can do this.
And um,
they,
the,
the,

757
00:43:49.991 --> 00:43:53.470
the fact that they were the ones going,
oh,
you know,
I said,
you know,

758
00:43:53.471 --> 00:43:56.390
the violence has to be very real.
It's not fun having my own,

759
00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.190
the violence is not funny at all.
When he fights people,
I like it to feel real.

760
00:44:00.191 --> 00:44:04.240
I just don't,
I don't want it to be cool,
you know?
And uh,

761
00:44:04.241 --> 00:44:08.830
they are absurd.
Yeah.
Like weekend at Bernie's jokes,

762
00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:13.000
you know what I mean?
Like,
which you could easily do in this,
you know,

763
00:44:13.001 --> 00:44:14.320
there's a lot of times where you,
you know,

764
00:44:14.321 --> 00:44:18.580
there's a scene in episode three where I have to strangle a guy and there's,

765
00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:24.220
there's in his backyard,
there's all these,
a child's,
you know,
kid toys and stuff.

766
00:44:24.221 --> 00:44:28.420
And I remember Alec Berg and I were shooting that scene and I said,
you know,

767
00:44:28.421 --> 00:44:31.140
any other place they would be like,
hey,
can we make it funny?

768
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:32.070
Can you kill him with

769
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.440
<v 1>the kids jump rope or,
you know,
can we get some jokes in there?</v>

770
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.560
You know what I mean?
And it's like,
no it's not.

771
00:44:37.561 --> 00:44:41.490
I feel like the merger is going to be too depressing.
It's like it should be,
no,

772
00:44:41.491 --> 00:44:44.610
no,
no.
But he should kill him.
He should still kill them.
But just funny,
you know,

773
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:49.440
and you're like,
no,
but,
uh,
we can't do that.
I said this before the podcast,

774
00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:51.750
you know,
that's why I could never really watch.

775
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.880
I watched Dexter cause I liked the performances,

776
00:44:53.881 --> 00:44:57.720
but I couldn't fully commit to it cause I could just hear the industry note.

777
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:00.300
Whereas like they went,
he's a serial killer and it's just like,

778
00:45:00.301 --> 00:45:02.790
well how can we root for that?
And it's just like,
all right,

779
00:45:02.791 --> 00:45:06.660
he just kills the bad people.
He's a serial killer with a good heart.

780
00:45:06.661 --> 00:45:09.570
And then I just was,
I just never was able,
well that's the hard thing.

781
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:13.560
That's been the nice thing with Barry,
at least as HBO,
you know,

782
00:45:13.561 --> 00:45:17.880
when we would turn in the drafts,
you know,
when we get to later in the season,

783
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:18.720
especially,

784
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:24.080
it starts to get a very definitely is not just killing the good people,

785
00:45:24.331 --> 00:45:27.670
you know,
are bad.
The bad people,
he's killing it.
You know,

786
00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:31.740
I gotta go home and I got to see,
you know,
it,
it gets terrible and where he,
he,

787
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:35.640
he ends up going,
is,
is a pretty rough,

788
00:45:35.641 --> 00:45:38.760
but it was it that was always just being honest to that guy.

789
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:40.070
You know what I mean?
And that,

790
00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:43.980
that's the thing that HBO has been great about is it,
we'll say,
hey,

791
00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:46.950
is this too much?
And they go,
well,
what else did you going to do?
You know,

792
00:45:46.951 --> 00:45:50.760
they see it from a character standpoint.
They're like,
well,
what's his choice?

793
00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.070
You know,
I saw it the two episodes and I

794
00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:59.640
actually felt for the guy as far as like how he became,
that's another thing.

795
00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:03.630
Like he just,
he's just not like,
oh,
okay.
He,
Joseph's born a psycho.
It's like,
no,

796
00:46:03.631 --> 00:46:07.410
this guy went to Afghanistan,
Afghanistan,

797
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:11.670
did what he did over there and then got into this line of work where he's a hit

798
00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.800
man and he basically wants to get out of it.
And uh,
and,

799
00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:18.240
and just Henry Winkler's characters with like the acting class.

800
00:46:18.241 --> 00:46:20.480
And I took a bunch of acting classes.
I had a lot of,

801
00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:25.770
I had some great acting teachers and I had,

802
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:28.520
but,
but there was was some,
you know,

803
00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.760
when they became like the guru and um,

804
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:37.590
I can't remember this woman's name and I only audited her class.

805
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.710
I audited two classes.
I'm in one on one class.
I audited,
it,

806
00:46:40.711 --> 00:46:44.610
turned out it was Scientology.
Oh really?
Oh,
it was hilarious.
I went in there,

807
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.650
this actor who was in Scientology,
he goes,
oh,
you need an acting class.

808
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:54.430
And she sent me there and it was acting class,
but it was also like Scientology.

809
00:46:54.431 --> 00:46:58.320
So,
which I felt like she should've said,
right.
That should have been,
it's acting,

810
00:46:58.321 --> 00:47:03.150
but there's a little extra thing.
So I go there,
I go there and I remember,

811
00:47:03.151 --> 00:47:07.380
uh,
we were sitting there and the,

812
00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:10.690
and the guy teaching the class goes,
does anybody have,
uh,

813
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.510
any news they want to walk,
you know,
share with the class.

814
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:20.450
And someone would raise their hand and be like,
Oh,
I,
uh,
you know,

815
00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:24.690
I just book a three episode arc on a,
you know,

816
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:29.040
who gives a fuck on ABC?
And then the whole crew,
the whole audience,

817
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:34.000
like ridiculously lab or go
like this positive.

818
00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:38.860
And,
but it was crazy how cultish and I,
I was sitting there like,

819
00:47:38.861 --> 00:47:43.570
what the fuck?
Right.
It's like five people did that and then they go,
hey,
we have,

820
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:48.190
we have,
we have two people auditing the class.
Uh,
this guy,
he's,

821
00:47:48.191 --> 00:47:51.100
he's just fresh here from New York.
He's,
he's an actor,

822
00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:54.460
he's trying to get some parts,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Please welcome bill burr.

823
00:47:54.461 --> 00:47:57.640
And they fake clapped.
Like I won a lifetime achievement award.

824
00:47:57.641 --> 00:48:02.470
I remember my face turned red.
I was embarrassed.
So,

825
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.510
you know,
and then I saw the seeds and the actors would go and everything.

826
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:05.201
And then during the break,

827
00:48:05.201 --> 00:48:07.810
like I remember the teacher was looking at me and goes,
well,
so was that,

828
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.270
was that too much?
Did I push?
Was that,

829
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.950
was I pushing?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

830
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.980
So then I went in and I sat down with them and they were just,

831
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:20.770
and they just kept saying everything was their own.
We have our own parking,

832
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.150
we have our own security,
we our own this.
And I swear to God,
I said,
Jesus Christ,

833
00:48:25.151 --> 00:48:26.380
I feel like I'm joining a cult.

834
00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.530
Like I was trying to make a joke and he kind of looked at me and his eyes were

835
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:32.410
like going from my right and my left that red.
I said,
what the fuck is going on?

836
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:37.600
So I got out of there and then I went down to this,
God,
I swear to God,

837
00:48:37.601 --> 00:48:40.150
this is true.
Went down to the comedy club and I mentioned,
I said,
yeah,

838
00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:42.970
I took this fact and class because the actors were really good,
but it was,

839
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.370
there was this just this fucking weird vibe.

840
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:48.340
And then I told them like the name of the acting class,
this guy goes,
dude,

841
00:48:48.341 --> 00:48:52.510
that's fucking Scientology.
And uh,
I dunno,

842
00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:56.680
I kind of felt like,
you know,
the next time I saw that person I had that vibe.

843
00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:59.890
Like they put something in my drink,
right?
Like you should have said,

844
00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.480
I don't listen guys.
Here's the thing.
Like I don't judge side.

845
00:49:02.481 --> 00:49:04.540
Like I hate when people act like,
oh my God,

846
00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:06.100
those people are out of their fucking minds.

847
00:49:06.101 --> 00:49:08.290
It's like my religion is out of their fucking minds.

848
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.860
It's just they got enough people right where they can act cool now and they

849
00:49:11.861 --> 00:49:15.800
don't care if you leave.
Like Scientology needs people.
So they got it,
you know,

850
00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:17.110
they got to lock in a room or whatever it is.

851
00:49:17.111 --> 00:49:21.670
If you need to say this is where you're going,
you need to say like,
by the way,

852
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:23.290
you're going to a church.

853
00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.550
I liked how they had their own network now to come back cause that one woman did

854
00:49:27.551 --> 00:49:31.270
like the Sh
Ramney or whatever.

855
00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:35.110
She did all this episodes about how crazy that was.

856
00:49:35.111 --> 00:49:37.750
But I always feel like there's another actor that could do the one about the

857
00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:39.150
Catholic church.
Yeah.

858
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:44.190
They Bang and kids and they made it seem like it was okay.

859
00:49:44.711 --> 00:49:48.410
And that was the thing.
And you bought into it.
Um,

860
00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.500
we're getting off track here.
Oh man,
that's great.

861
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:56.710
What I'm trying to do is I just don't want to fucking sit here and ask you about

862
00:49:56.930 --> 00:50:01.780
SNL and all of that shit that I know.
You've answered a Zillion,
a zillion times.

863
00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.120
No,
I'm loving this.
No,

864
00:50:04.121 --> 00:50:09.121
that's every a thing I go to is like the word Stefan from or whatever,

865
00:50:09.551 --> 00:50:13.800
you know.
So how did you come up with that?
And we'll come up with,
so,
um,

866
00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:18.730
I will tell you my favorite thing I ever saw you do was laughing uncontrollably.

867
00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:23.640
Well,
uh,
uh,
it was a lock.
The locker room thing.
Oh,
a foretaste.

868
00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:27.960
Yeah.
Oh my coffers.
He told me about that.
You literally the towel.

869
00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:31.500
<v 0>I have a towel wrapped around my phobia.
It's crazy.
Cause you know why?</v>

870
00:50:31.501 --> 00:50:36.240
Cause Forte did this dance and he did it at the table read on Wednesday.

871
00:50:36.241 --> 00:50:37.410
And I just said I can't,

872
00:50:37.411 --> 00:50:39.090
there's no way I'm going to be able to make it through that.

873
00:50:39.091 --> 00:50:43.230
That's too fine because he's a coach trying to get us all riled up to go back

874
00:50:43.231 --> 00:50:45.930
into the second half of the game and to get us riled up.

875
00:50:45.931 --> 00:50:48.230
He does this herb Albert,
this dance is her bowel

876
00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:57.180
and he does his dance.
And then,
and uh,
and then so yeah,

877
00:50:57.181 --> 00:51:00.240
then I saw before we went on air,
I go,
hey,
will,

878
00:51:00.241 --> 00:51:02.820
can you just do it for me a couple of times just in my dressing room.

879
00:51:02.821 --> 00:51:06.080
Can you just do it so I can like laugh and get it out?
That's great.

880
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:08.580
Can I just get it out?
So he did it,

881
00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:11.760
but then on air he added a move courses

882
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:15.770
<v 1>cause he added this thing and he went like that.</v>

883
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:20.620
<v 0>Like he couldn't hear me and,
uh,
and I lost it.
I just completely lost it.</v>

884
00:51:20.621 --> 00:51:23.250
And I started going and then I remember remembered the Degas was next to me.

885
00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:24.130
I don't know,

886
00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:28.510
cause I started going and then Keenan Thompson started going,

887
00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:33.160
cause we just
lost it me straight face.

888
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:38.260
He Kinda,
he starts to put a towel around his face he gets,
cause I just,

889
00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:42.370
but I completely lost it cause for it,
it also was just,

890
00:51:42.371 --> 00:51:47.320
it was such a forte thing,
forte,
just,
he's not like I'm on,

891
00:51:47.321 --> 00:51:51.220
you know,
he's one of those guys very well.
Hey Man,
I just very cool chill guy.

892
00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:54.730
And then he would do these ideas or something.
What happened to him and you go,

893
00:51:54.731 --> 00:51:56.430
where is that that he's,

894
00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.830
I know he would make me laugh that whole period,

895
00:51:59.831 --> 00:52:03.230
all of those like you are you and you're one of those guys like that was like,

896
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.900
thank you.
That was like murderers row.
He,
he,
he had uh,
he pits.
He goes,

897
00:52:07.901 --> 00:52:11.100
I'm a bill,
I'm going out with a movie and I know it's the movie you're doing.

898
00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:15.170
He was wanting to do a movie about a two brothers who,

899
00:52:15.171 --> 00:52:19.450
who's switch bodies.
And I go,
yeah.
And he goes,
here's the thing,

900
00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:20.553
they're identical.

901
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:25.540
<v 1>It
doesn't matter.</v>

902
00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:28.690
I go,
okay.

903
00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:32.180
<v 0>I go,
how do people know that they switched body as well?</v>

904
00:52:32.181 --> 00:52:34.940
That's the joke is everyone acts like,
well,
you're acting differently.

905
00:52:34.941 --> 00:52:38.780
That's not like you,
but they're just acting there.
These two boring guy.

906
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:42.530
So tell him that he would sustain that for heat for 90 minute out.

907
00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:46.310
And I was like,
he told me that and I laugh for,
I just want to,

908
00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:49.000
where the hell did you come with that?
And you know,

909
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:51.380
I'm going to write this movie about these two guys.
So yeah,

910
00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:55.280
he's just a genius and a great guy too.
But yeah,
no,

911
00:52:55.281 --> 00:52:59.860
I felt very lucky when I was there with all those people,
Kristin and,
and uh,

912
00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:03.440
Andy and Fred Armisen and all those guys.
I mean,
it was crazy.
Yeah.

913
00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:07.040
And you guys have all gone on to do stuff.
So right now are you,
uh,
are you,

914
00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:10.250
when do you start back up with the next season or do you get the writing it

915
00:53:10.251 --> 00:53:13.930
right now?
We're writing season two right now.
Oh God.
Did you get any of the,

916
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.640
how much of a break did you get any kind of bit of a break?
Yeah,

917
00:53:16.641 --> 00:53:21.140
I mean we finished all this in August,
so Barry was done in August.
Oh.

918
00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:25.350
Then it starts airing and then,
you know,
we opened up a writer's room and then,

919
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:30.690
you know,
HBO uh,
told us,
you know,
yeah,
you guys can,
you know,
we do more.

920
00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:34.560
Is it,
it's going to be another eight as of right now,
who knows?

921
00:53:34.561 --> 00:53:38.640
We might change that,
but as of right now it's eight.
I kind of liked that people,

922
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:44.010
I like being able to craft eight episodes and kind of make it a very,
you know,

923
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.320
kind of a tight season,
you know,
and story.

924
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:51.840
Back in the day when there was a great album,
a lot of times it was eight songs.

925
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.460
Yeah.

926
00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:56.090
<v 1>Then when the 10 song came out,
it's like,
all right,
here's the fucking valid,</v>

927
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.790
just trying to fill it.
I get it.
I get it.

928
00:53:58.791 --> 00:54:01.330
It's the same thing with TV in a way where you go,
Oh wow,

929
00:54:01.331 --> 00:54:03.470
now we're going to watch an episode that's all about,
you know,

930
00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:07.130
the gardener or something and you go,
I don't care about this.
You know,

931
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:09.020
I want to know.
I don't want to,

932
00:54:09.021 --> 00:54:12.650
I want to know what else is going on JD that I don't consider that

933
00:54:12.651 --> 00:54:15.540
groundbreaking.
I'm just like how you guys wanted an episode off.

934
00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:22.090
I think the series regulars are bitching about their contracts.
That guy,

935
00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:26.300
but we got to keep the train moving so let's do something about it.
That guy,

936
00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.150
that guy,
guess what?
You're starring in the show.

937
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.290
This what asshole you're carrying the shelf and if it goes down,

938
00:54:33.291 --> 00:54:37.870
you never play a gardener in this town again.
You piece of shit.
Um,
well anyways,

939
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:41.280
uh,
thank you so much for uh,
for coming on.
Amen.

940
00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.830
Oh,
my head hurts.
I'm laughing so much good.
But no,
it was great.

941
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:47.330
That's all my interviews one about,

942
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:49.160
I don't want anybody to learn anything about you.

943
00:54:49.161 --> 00:54:51.980
I just want to give you a break from the same fucking 20 questions,

944
00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:54.170
but I'm so happy for you man.
Thank you buddy.

945
00:54:54.171 --> 00:54:57.470
That means a lot to already done so much brilliant work in the fact that,

946
00:54:57.471 --> 00:54:57.711
you know,

947
00:54:57.711 --> 00:55:02.650
HBO shout out to them for being so cool to let a comedic actor,

948
00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:06.670
I don't know how to define what,
what,
what,
what it is sketchy.
I don't know how,

949
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:10.070
I just know comedian what,
what,
what,
what do,
you know,

950
00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:15.080
like sketch actor to SNL and they let you do something like that as a pen to

951
00:55:15.081 --> 00:55:16.420
write it and direct.
I never,
never

952
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:19.910
<v 0>directed before and they let me direct stuff and I mean,
uh,
you know,</v>

953
00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:24.200
I directed the first three episodes and to write and all that and so yeah,

954
00:55:24.201 --> 00:55:28.400
just to be able to have so much faith and it's crazy.

955
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.500
Eddie Murphy 48 hours steadfast.
Yeah.

956
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:36.050
The acting that he does in that he so God damn funny,
but when it has to be real,

957
00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:39.770
he's incredible.
And then what was,
what was the one he got nominated for the,
uh,

958
00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:42.890
dream girls?
I,
for the life of me,

959
00:55:42.891 --> 00:55:46.190
I don't understand why he doesn't get more stuff.
He,

960
00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.010
I will say a bit,

961
00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:52.550
but that 48 hours scene when he goes into the redneck bar and he,
you know,

962
00:55:52.551 --> 00:55:57.551
the cowboy is one of the few scenes in movie history where you're like,

963
00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:01.820
that's a movie stars just been born.
Yeah.
We're,
what,
with one scene,

964
00:56:01.821 --> 00:56:05.300
it's very rare where you can go,
you know,
like John Wayne and stage coach,

965
00:56:05.301 --> 00:56:08.120
they always say they push in on in his first shot and stage coach and everybody

966
00:56:08.121 --> 00:56:12.830
went,
wow,
who was that guy?
You know?
But Eddie Murphy in that scene,

967
00:56:12.831 --> 00:56:15.670
I just remember,
I remember I didn't see it,
but my,
my dad's seen them.

968
00:56:15.671 --> 00:56:18.950
We've been coming back and going,
there's this guy in the movies,

969
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:23.620
the new guy on SNL.
It is like one of the funniest things.
He's phenomenal.

970
00:56:23.621 --> 00:56:24.040
You got

971
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.790
<v 1>to see,
you know.
Yeah.
What else?
I I,</v>

972
00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:31.660
that is the best gun sounds.
Oh yeah.

973
00:56:31.661 --> 00:56:35.470
Walter Hill's movies always have like the cannon.
Unbelievable.

974
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:38.950
Unbelievable.
And you know something.
I actually,
uh,

975
00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:44.250
got to do an acting gig where I,
I played,
uh,
um,

976
00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:49.060
ah,
fuck.
I'm so bad with the named Jason.
Uh,
he played Mike on Breaking bad.
Oh,

977
00:56:49.061 --> 00:56:53.170
I know what you're talking about.
Yeah.
Yeah,
he's great.
I got to talk,

978
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.040
I got to talk to him about being on 48 hours.

979
00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:02.470
Uh,
he's like,
God dammit.
Jacked up,
joke,
joke,
joke,
don't.
He goes to,

980
00:57:02.471 --> 00:57:06.550
he gives him the gun and then he also got thrown over the,

981
00:57:06.551 --> 00:57:09.940
the buffet table,
um,
in a,

982
00:57:09.941 --> 00:57:14.320
in Beverly hills cop and he hasn't been one of my favorite lines in airplane.
Oh,

983
00:57:14.321 --> 00:57:15.430
he was in an airplane?
Yeah.
He goes,

984
00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:19.820
the guy just went from 500,000 feet to 20,000 feet.
What an answer.

985
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:26.520
He's the guy in the radio or watching like,
yeah.
This guy to see that again.
Yeah.

986
00:57:26.521 --> 00:57:29.590
Yeah.
He just,
the cutaway to him,
he was like,
oh,
it just went from,
it's like,
yeah,

987
00:57:29.591 --> 00:57:32.410
25,000 feet to 7,000 feet.
What an ass.

988
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:38.170
I remember that line was him.
Yeah.
He's also the guy that go,
how are we doing?

989
00:57:38.171 --> 00:57:41.950
And he opens up a,
it's a like a Turkey and then he's like,
oh,
we're almost done.

990
00:57:41.951 --> 00:57:46.750
We're almost finished here,
sir.
So just dumb.
But he's great.

991
00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:49.560
I mean,
that's one of the best of the best movies.
But yeah,
no,
the gun,

992
00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:52.930
the gun sounds in 48 hours.
All those Walter Hill movies.

993
00:57:52.931 --> 00:57:57.760
He always had like a really cool sound design in his movies.
He was great.
Yeah.

994
00:57:58.360 --> 00:57:59.780
The whole thing.
I actually one time went,
whoa,

995
00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:02.110
this is like the epilogue of the plug.
Just this point.

996
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:06.430
I was on the subway and the actor that played Luther,
you know,

997
00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:10.480
the guy from warriors,
he was sitting like right across from me.
He had,
you know,

998
00:58:10.481 --> 00:58:13.660
he looked great.
I mean,
it was like maybe 20 years ago I saw him.
Wow.

999
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:18.700
What am I just the way he delivered that line,
uh,
when he,

1000
00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:23.530
uh,
when Nick Nolte,
he's beaten him up at the door and he goes,
you know,
like,

1001
00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.960
well,
I think you're lying.
And the line is,
yeah,

1002
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:30.460
well who gives a fuck what you think?
And he doesn't yell to the Word Fuck.

1003
00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:36.170
He just goes,
yeah,
well who gives a fuck what you yell at Fuck?

1004
00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:39.690
Who gives a fuck what you think?
Oh,
there's a fuck when you,

1005
00:58:39.691 --> 00:58:44.580
that's the way he did that.
He has that catch phrase in my family.
Yeah.

1006
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:47.890
Who gives a fuck what you,
yeah.
He has such weird rhythms.

1007
00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:50.860
That guy all the warriors to,
I mean like,
he's such a,

1008
00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:56.110
he has such a cool way of speaking.
You just hear like,
yeah,

1009
00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.660
well you can learn a lot from that guy and people are going to learn a lot from
