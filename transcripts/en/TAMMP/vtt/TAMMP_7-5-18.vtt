00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:09.390

Ah,

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.330
Ooh,
I'm just checking in on you to see how your work weeks go.

4
00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:16.810
And you know,

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.030
fucking weird one this year with 4th of July on a Wednesday.
You know,

6
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:24.150
if it's on the Tuesday,
maybe your boss gives you the Monday off,
right?

7
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:28.530
You got a three day fucking week after a four day weekend.
It's beautiful.

8
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.220
You know,
it's on Thursday.
Maybe you don't have to come in Friday.

9
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:36.900
There's your four day fucking weekend.
Not this year.
Oh No.

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.950
Oh,
fucking powdered wig itself came in on a Wednesday.

11
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.540
Fucked everybody Monday.
Tuesday.
Right?

12
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.850
Everybody fucks off for Wednesday.
Now you gotta come back Thursday,
Friday.

13
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.630
It's cool to get the day off,
but she didn't get the consecutive days off,

14
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:59.100
you know?
Do you know he got fucked up the night of July 3rd,
right?
And yesterday.

15
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:03.120
What'd you do?
You ate a bunch of fucking burgers.
Is that what you did?
Uh,

16
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.290
I am finally on the other side of this.
God damn cold.

17
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.830
I caught one of these post global warming,

18
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:15.060
Mother Nature is going to start getting rid of us cold,
this fucking thing.

19
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.900
<v 0>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.360
<v 1>It came on slow,
you know,</v>

21
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.890
and then it just started picking up speed and it just grabbed me by the fucking

22
00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:28.210
throat and just choke slammed me.
Uh,

23
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.460
<v 0>okay.</v>

24
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.230
<v 1>Yeah.
So I'm finally,
finally on the other side of it though.</v>

25
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.700
He wouldn't know what to hear me right now,
but I am,
uh,

26
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.310
I want to thank all you guys for your postcards and your well wishes

27
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.480
meant a lot to me.
You know,

28
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.930
when I was sitting in the lay there in the hospital bed,
uh,

29
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.630
I actually was the first guy who ever went to the hospital for a common cold and

30
00:01:55.631 --> 00:01:58.330
uh,
the San Fernando Fernando Valley area,

31
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.490
they made a plaque for me and everything.

32
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.480
I went in there and the doctor was just like looking at my chart.

33
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.150
If I looked up,
he's like,
so you got the sniffles?
And I was like,
yeah.
He's like,

34
00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:13.480
you know,
I have a whole emergency room full of people that got stabbed and shot.

35
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.810
And I was like,
yeah,
I know,
but like one of my nostrils,

36
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:20.300
it's like really clogged up and I just can't like deal man.
Um,

37
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.820
I tell you guys,
I saw that,
that documentary on Mark Ronson,

38
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.290
is that his name?
No,
not mark Ronson.

39
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.100
The fucking guy who played with David Bowie is Mark Ronson,

40
00:02:33.101 --> 00:02:38.101
the Guy Mick Ronson broths and it's still one mark Ronson.

41
00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:42.580
Is this is your mother,
your father,
your sister,

42
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.610
whatever that fucking song is this Jalyn by eight and some peanut butter.

43
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.960
It's a fucking summer.
Dabba do let me see your titties.

44
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.000
All right.
Isn't that how that song went?
Uh,

45
00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.573
Mick

46
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.520
played with David Bowie when he was Ziggy stardust and the spiders and I'm

47
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.320
fucking incredible guitarist.
Credible musician,

48
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.920
a producer wrote songs,
you know,

49
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.960
learn how to write out all the music and all this shit.

50
00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:20.460
And he got no fucking credit.
Got No fucking credit,
didn't get any money.

51
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.600
They fucked him.
I just,

52
00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:26.490
the music business is the absolute worst.

53
00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:30.390
I can't tell you how many fucking times I've seen that.

54
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.620
You know,
the drummer and the bass player in those first two Ozzie Solo albums,

55
00:03:36.621 --> 00:03:41.050
like they just,
they just fuck those guys.
They just,

56
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.403
you know,

57
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.740
guys coming in and writing rifts and writing entire fucking songs,

58
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.070
but they're too,
they don't have a good lawyer.
Nobody tells him what's up.

59
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.750
They don't get the,
uh,
you know,

60
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:57.190
and then it's like song by Ozzy Osborne and then they get fucked out of millions

61
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.840
of dollars.
How do you do that to a kid?

62
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.490
It's just this reoccurring thing in the fucking music business is fucking guy

63
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:09.820
was writing all these rifts.
He was writing the string arrangements.

64
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:14.350
He was in the fucking studio with one of those conductor once they didn't,

65
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:15.640
you didn't get any fucking credit.

66
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.870
<v 1>It's fucking pro.
Uh,
but what was amazing was watching the guy,
uh,</v>

68
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.910
I saw him,
I was like,
Jesus Christ,

69
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:28.030
that guy looks like fucking Randy Rhoads same haircut,

70
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:30.010
same fucking Les Paul and all that.
I'm like,
wait,

71
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:34.690
Randy Rhodes came after Mick Ronson.
So then I just look googled.

72
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.650
Randy Rhoads,

73
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:39.010
a Mick Ronson influenced and a bunch of shit came out and saying that he was a

74
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:42.040
fan of yours.
I thought that was pretty cool,
you know,

75
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.070
and already had more of the classical guitar type of stuff in there.
But,

76
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:49.720
you know,
say uh,
it's a,
yeah,
it's a good documentary.

77
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:51.970
I saw it on a plane though.
You know,
whenever you want to play it.
Every,

78
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.200
everything's fucking good guys.
I don't know it,
I fucking,
I'm,
I'm still,

79
00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:59.210
I'm coming out of this shit man.
You know,

80
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.810
I don't know what it feels like to be trapped in a mine.
You know,
I'll fucker,

81
00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:07.520
there's some kids right now trapped somewhere.
The news is just so brutal.
I just,

82
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.690
I,
when I read,
I just see like the headline,
I just go,
ah,
I just walk away.

83
00:05:11.691 --> 00:05:14.660
I don't know how people just sit there watching other people's suffering.

84
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.950
It's one thing to say,
hey,
these kids are trapped in a mine right over there.

85
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.260
Grab a shovel,
come with me.
Then you can do something.

86
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.500
But they just know this sitting there and there's nothing he can fucking do

87
00:05:24.501 --> 00:05:26.510
about it.
You know,

88
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.810
kind of fucked up a bunch of kids end up in a mind.
Is that what happened?

89
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.990
The end of mind and a fucking stuck on a giant lily pad or something like that

90
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:38.890
in the middle of the river.
I don't know.
I bet an uh,
you know,

91
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.940
I've been like fucking hallucinating,
no God damn week.
But,
uh,

92
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.110
one of the good things about being this sick as I haven't drank in like fucking

93
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:50.950
five days,
you know,
and uh,

94
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.580
I got some active work next week,
so whenever I got an acting work,

95
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:58.040
I shut down all the fun,
you know.
Oh Billy,
no fund,

96
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.620
you know,
try to keep my face not fucking,
I'll fucking puffy and shit.

97
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.260
Um,
so anyways.
Oh God,

98
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:11.990
I got nothing.
Jesus Christ.
They got nothing,
but I got to knock this up.

99
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.253
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

100
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.500
<v 1>This is how funny I am.
What?
I'm fucking sick for five days.</v>

101
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.260
I'm basically not funny at all.
Okay.

102
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.140
I would appreciate it if you guys would just cut me a little bit of fuck slack.

103
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.000
All right.
You know what I had?
I had a few,
uh,

104
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.590
I fucked up.
Uh,
what else?

105
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.500
Uploading the Monday morning podcast when uh,

106
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.850
like kill my,
the battery on my laptop died.

107
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.710
So 15 minutes in the middle got cut out.
So we had to edit it,
edit it together.

108
00:06:43.711 --> 00:06:47.580
So there's some fucking people wrote in some questions that I'm going to re

109
00:06:47.581 --> 00:06:48.960
answer them the best I can.

110
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.950
By the way on Instagram I found this account that I've been following called

111
00:06:52.951 --> 00:06:57.951
don't be a Brad and it's basically a trashing like essentially a meathead white

112
00:07:01.681 --> 00:07:04.860
guy,
frat boys.
Um,

113
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.230
you know it's funny,
they kind of,
they kind of,
you know,

114
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.140
it's hilarious because you know,
there's a lot of truth to it.

115
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:15.830
But then also it's like you completely judging these people by their skin color

116
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.860
and nobody gives a fuck cause it's fucking white guys.

117
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:22.880
But a lot of them are just really good looking guys who are in frats and they're

118
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:26.720
getting a lot of pussy and your fucking annoyed by it because you're a nerd.

119
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.840
So you started this account.
Having said that,
it is funny,

120
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.740
like they literally have one of them yelling at about Sicko.

121
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.400
Do you know what my dad does?

122
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.470
You know what,
everybody makes fun of these Frat kids.

123
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:45.140
It's not their fucking fault.
It's the parents.

124
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.760
It's like making fun of millennials.
It's like it's not,

125
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.130
it's the people who raised him that fucked him up.
But it's a very funny account.

126
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.050
I'll be it.
A lot of it,
you know,

127
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.830
it's just unathletic people making fun of people who are athletic.

128
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.580
Um,
and then there's also something too,
you know,

129
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:08.540
there's a curse to be in fucking good looking.
You know,

130
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:09.590
I was reading this one time,

131
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:14.000
this article in rolling stone and this guy who was just like this heartthrob for

132
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:18.410
fucking 15 years was now like in his sixties and he was still in this fucking,

133
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.340
this interview and they were talking to him and he was reflecting on what kind

134
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:27.170
of a person he was back in his twenties in his thirties he said,
well,
you know,

135
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.280
I was,
he was basically saying he was a really good looking guy.

136
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.390
He was on a TV show and in movies and he had a big Dick.

137
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.770
So he only had to develop so much as a human being.

138
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.760
It was really fascinating.

139
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.260
So then when he got old and he wasn't as good looking,

140
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.600
it was creepy to younger women and shit.

141
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:55.601
He actually had to finish developing all development as a human that he never

142
00:08:56.641 --> 00:09:00.900
had to do before because all he did was just show up in all the women fainted.

143
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.120
They pulled out his giant Dick.

144
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.240
You know what he fucking went to tout it was dealt with.

145
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:09.330
Daddy went back down to the movie set and made another hit movie.
It was very,

146
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:12.420
very interesting.
So I actually was thinking of that when I was looking at that.

147
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:13.290
Don't be a bread,

148
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.303
<v 3>uh,</v>

149
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.630
<v 1>Instagram account.
Well,</v>

150
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.530
it's like this isn't these kids 100% their fault.

151
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.680
Like if your kid is walking around and acted like an asshole and then go and do

152
00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:30.270
you know what my dad does for a living?
Uh,
you spoiled the shit out of that kid.

153
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.650
That's your fucking fault.
That,
I mean,
that's complete failure.

154
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:35.710
<v 4>Okay.</v>

155
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.210
<v 1>As a dad.
If your kids out there be it a fucking,
you know,</v>

156
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.820
mouthing off to some bounce or that could fucking twist them up like a pretzel

157
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.090
and then screaming like,
my dad's going to come down here.

158
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.200
<v 3>Oh my God,
I just be like son,
son.</v>

159
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.460
<v 1>Fight your own battles.
Like what are you doing?
I want to come down here.</v>

160
00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:57.210
We'll do what?
Sue Him cause you're a fucking asshole.

161
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.290
I don't want to see you get a concussion but he should have slapped the shit out

162
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:03.510
of you.
All right.
Republican douche

163
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.330
<v 3>question mark.
Uh Hey bill,
I'm a fan of your comedy.</v>

164
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.660
<v 1>I'm still a fan of you,</v>

165
00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:15.610
but artists that you're starting to sound like a red pill,
Republican Douche bag,

166
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.323
you know,

167
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:22.350
is it just classically classic like way that looked like politics is discussed

168
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:23.184
now.

169
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.803
<v 3>You know,</v>

170
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.090
<v 1>like his whole thing is called Republican douchey question mark.</v>

171
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.090
I like,
I don't understand these people where if,

172
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.120
if you're a republican that automatically you're a Douche.

173
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.240
If you're a Democrat you're automatically at,
do you know what I mean?

174
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.320
You know what I'm saying?
Like,
like,
you don't think anybody on either.

175
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.670
Like everybody on that side is just douche bags.
Um,

176
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.220
anyways,
he goes,
no offense,

177
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.970
you're always going on about how Hillary is evil.
Well,

178
00:10:53.971 --> 00:10:58.800
our country is going down the shitter and she would've saved us from a lot of

179
00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:01.880
these headaches.
All right,
well that's pretty vague.

180
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.390
<v 4>Okay.</v>

181
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.150
<v 1>Our country has been going down the shitter for a long time,
sir.</v>

182
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.830
I don't know what you're talking about.

183
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.580
What exactly wasn't it going down the Shitter,
you know?

184
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:17.740
Oh,
speaking of that,
you know,
back in the,
uh,
of that fucking don't be a Brad,

185
00:11:17.741 --> 00:11:22.741
one of the frat boys had Ronald Reagan tattooed on his calf.

186
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:27.920
Not a picture.
It just said Ronald Reagan that fuck it was,

187
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.170
that's hilarious to me.

188
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.913
<v 3>You know,</v>

189
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.590
<v 1>Ronald Reagan is like rich white people's Abraham Lincoln.</v>

190
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.240
Like he set them free in a way by,
you know,

191
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.260
by,
you know,
deregulating everything.

192
00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:48.560
So then these fucking robber barons could get back to what the fuck they wanted

193
00:11:48.561 --> 00:11:49.394
to be doing.

194
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:50.423
<v 3>MMM.</v>

195
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.010
<v 1>Oh,
look at that.
I just made fun of a Republican,
sir.
Uh,</v>

196
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.330
do I sound like a red pill?
Republican Douche bag?
I mean,
this guy,

197
00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:00.070
he's like literally speaking in sound bites.

198
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:03.490
Like how fucking like how boring a conversation.

199
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:07.800
What did to discuss politics with this person?
Um,
anyways,

200
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.630
he say you say you don't like trout Trump,

201
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:16.080
but you sound like a closet fan who's just too afraid to say you love him cause

202
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:20.140
you'll lose a part donut store.
Employee number two.

203
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.800
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

204
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.240
<v 1>Thank you.
Missed a word in there buddy.
Um,</v>

205
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.620
I'm not afraid to say that I like Trump.
If I like Trump,
I don't like them.

206
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.470
I don't like him and his fucking wife.

207
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.700
The fact that she wore that jacket that said I don't really care.
Do you,

208
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.420
when she was going to see those kids and then tried to say like,
oh,

209
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:43.480
that had to do with fake news like this,

210
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:48.360
such passive aggressive fucking pussies.
Yeah.

211
00:12:48.361 --> 00:12:50.190
That had nothing to do with fake news.

212
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.530
Like you telling me nobody at the White House.
This is about fake news.
Well a,

213
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.340
just to let you know,
they are first lady.

214
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.350
People might think you're talking about the kids.

215
00:12:58.351 --> 00:13:03.350
You might not want to wear that.
It was such like a fucking,
you know,

216
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.470
it's bad enough when a guy's at Agora bought a woman does it?

217
00:13:06.471 --> 00:13:07.760
She's actually had kids.

218
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.480
She knows what it's like to have a fucking kid and to sit there and have these

219
00:13:11.481 --> 00:13:14.180
kids in fucking cages and she wears a jacket like that.

220
00:13:14.181 --> 00:13:18.570
It's just that I was fucking,
they're not human.
So anyways,
uh,

221
00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.260
he said,
I can't tell if it's set.

222
00:13:21.261 --> 00:13:24.740
Your fan base is all a bunch of moderate morons.

223
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:26.260
<v 4>Okay.</v>

224
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:31.000
<v 1>Who would rather be concise contrarians that pick the good guys are the bad
guys.</v>

225
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.650
Why don't you just pick a side because clearly this is a good guy,

226
00:13:35.651 --> 00:13:39.370
bad guy thing going on here.
Question Mark.
Uh,

227
00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:41.560
that's probably one of the most ignorant,

228
00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:45.160
condescending fucking emails I've ever gotten.

229
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:46.930
You didn't make one fucking point.

230
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.550
You just spoken big broad soundbites.
I get it.
I get it.

231
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:55.840
You're a Democrat and you think everybody was a republican is a Douche,
eh,

232
00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:58.510
the country's going down the shitter.
And if we picked a Democrat,

233
00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:01.240
it wouldn't be going down the shitter.
And there are good guys.

234
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:04.330
And there are bad guys and the good guys are Democrats are the bad guys are

235
00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:07.630
Republicans.
Right?
Hey,
by the way,
did you see the house,

236
00:14:07.631 --> 00:14:10.990
the Obama's just fucking bought,
you know,

237
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.390
how the fuck did they have the money to buy that fucking house?

238
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.780
Explain that to me.
You know,
every fucking one of them,

239
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.580
whether you wear a blue tie or a red tie,

240
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.400
they come out of the White House worth fucking,
you know,

241
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.700
tens of millions of dollars other than Bill Clinton because he stuck his cigar,

242
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:28.390
that woman's Pussy and he had a lot of fucking legal bills.
Uh,
but even they,

243
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.840
even the fucking Clinton set it up with me and hundreds of billions.

244
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.820
Well actually Bill Clinton said he came out of the White House in debt,

245
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.370
but he also said I did not have sex with that woman.

246
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.540
So he probably had fucking millions of dollars.
I don't like any of them,
sir.

247
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.980
I don't,
uh,
I liked,
uh,

248
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.250
Bernie Sanders.
Bernie Sanders.

249
00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:52.400
I liked about saying he would have solved everything,
but uh,
God knows.
See Gabby,

250
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.560
he,
he got,
he got the majority of the vote and the Democrats said,
fuck that.

251
00:14:58.561 --> 00:15:00.870
We're still giving the Dobbin the domination to Hillary.

252
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.220
And she was fine with that.

253
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.900
That had the fucking nerve to sit there and bitch about the fucking election.
Uh,

254
00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:11.670
that last election was to aim at a bar,
sir.
There was no,
there was no wedding.

255
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:16.590
There was no winning.
That one.
Uh,
I mean,

256
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.600
Hillary literally sent in 2008 to the bankers.
Don't worry.
I got you guys.

257
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.520
Like I'll basically cover if you guys,
I mean,

258
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.400
you should be tried for fucking trees and when you do shit like that,
uh,

259
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.490
I don't see any difference between her or Trump.

260
00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.290
I doubt they're complete pieces of shit that are out for themselves,

261
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.600
who act like they're there for you.

262
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:42.370
And it's weird if they were a certain color fucking shirt some half the country

263
00:15:43.111 --> 00:15:48.060
believes it.
Uh,
all right.
25 year old buying an old house.

264
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.170
All right.
Hey,
Billy doughboy from 25 years old,

265
00:15:52.171 --> 00:15:54.750
just graduated with my masters and got a dream job,

266
00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.390
a dream teaching job in Philly.

267
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.810
You're teaching in Philadelphia where you got your work cut out for you,

268
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.063
fucking with you.

269
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.593
<v 2>MMM.</v>

270
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.350
<v 1>Anyways,
I got my dream job teaching in Philadelphia.</v>

271
00:16:11.351 --> 00:16:13.720
Where the fuck did it just go?
I just lost everything here.

272
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.060
<v 2>Okay.</v>

273
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.520
<v 1>Oh,
belly.
All right.</v>

274
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.150
Okay.
With how cheap the housing market is,

275
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.020
I figured it would be a smart decision to buy a house now rather than wait 10

276
00:16:28.021 --> 00:16:32.910
years.
Uh,
I found a great old house in Philly.
It's in my price.

277
00:16:32.911 --> 00:16:37.770
Wage should be price range,
move in ready.
It has all the details.

278
00:16:37.771 --> 00:16:39.330
I love about old houses.

279
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.300
They accepted my offer and they close at the end of the month.
That's exciting.

280
00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:45.510
25 years old.
You've got a house,
Dude.
You got your dream job,
you're crushing it.

281
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.690
All you gotta do is pick the right lady and you're good.
You pick the wrong one.

282
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.760
She'll take all of it from,
yeah,
but you won't see that Hashtag on Twitter.
We'll,

283
00:16:53.761 --> 00:16:58.530
yeah.
Uh,
after listening to your podcast for a couple of years,

284
00:16:58.531 --> 00:17:01.410
I know that you have a love hate relationship with your old house.
Yes,
I do.

285
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.200
Is there any advice that you have for me,

286
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.920
for me as I move in and make my first real adult purchase?

287
00:17:07.921 --> 00:17:11.730
Thanks for keeping me and many other teachers saying with your podcast.

288
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.430
<v 2>Okay.</v>

289
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.140
<v 1>All right.
Well if you're going to buy an old house,
a Jesus,</v>

290
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.250
I don't even know where to begin.

291
00:17:18.251 --> 00:17:22.350
The first thing I would start with is the guts of the house.
If he,

292
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:23.171
if he got the money,

293
00:17:23.171 --> 00:17:26.980
if you can redo the electrical and the plumbing or find out to what extent it

294
00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:31.420
has been redone because I had a bunch of cloth wiring and galvanized pipes in my

295
00:17:31.421 --> 00:17:34.840
walls.
You don't want to fire and you don't want to get flooded.

296
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:39.340
So that's usually a big thing there.
Um,

297
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:40.830
<v 2>okay.</v>

298
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.550
<v 1>I also had a minor gas leak.</v>

299
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.240
It might want to look for stuff like that once you get to the guts.

300
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:47.750
<v 2>Okay.</v>

301
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:52.260
<v 1>That I would deal with the,
as far as,
um,
you know,</v>

302
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:56.070
there's going to be a bunch of Shit,
you know,
I check out your roof.

303
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.760
That's another thing I would check for termites.
That's another thing.

304
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.060
<v 3>MMM.</v>

305
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
<v 1>I actually have all like the skeleton keys for every door in the house that I</v>

306
00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:11.310
got them.
So they all work and then within two and a half,

307
00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:13.470
three years of doing it,
the house settled some more.

308
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.020
And now most of the bolts don't line up with the thing.
And I just,

309
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.120
I just stopped fighting the house after a while.
It's just like,
all right,

310
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:22.700
I get it.
This house is almost a hundred years old and,
uh,

311
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.830
it's going to do what the fuck it wants to do.
So,
um,
I would just,
you know,

312
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.280
once you get the electrical,
the plumbing done,
that's like the biggest thing,

313
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.660
then you can slowly kind of fix up everything else.
But a,

314
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:36.870
and what I tried to do is,
uh,

315
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.600
you know,
as I upgrade,
like,
you know,
upgrade the electrical and the plumbing,

316
00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:45.390
nobody's going to see that.
So,
you know,
fuck with the character of the house.

317
00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:49.020
But like,
uh,
the worst,
the worst thing you can do is,

318
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:53.220
is to take stuff out of your house and replace it with Home Depot Shit.

319
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.571
Um,

320
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:59.571
I would find some sort of old school hardware store that has just that,

321
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.350
those old doors from the time of your house,
you can find those places.

322
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:07.980
They'll have all the door knobs and all the locks and all of that shit.

323
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.760
You congratulate.
Just go room by room and Redo it.
Um,

324
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.770
yeah.
What's,
you're fine with your old doors.
Not only the an odd size,

325
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.070
they're also really heavy because,
um,
back then

326
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.920
the trees they were cutting down were much older.
It's not wet wood or something.

327
00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:27.750
It's more dense wood.
I don't really understand it,

328
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:32.751
but they're super heavy as opposed to all these shit would fucking crap that

329
00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:36.720
they have down at the,
uh,
home depot.
And the worst thing,

330
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.440
what I like about your email is that you actually seem to love old houses

331
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.960
because there's nothing worse than someone who doesn't give a fuck about it.

332
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:44.580
Old House buys it just to flip it.

333
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.230
And it's funny as they got the house to give it a makeover and everything,

334
00:19:49.231 --> 00:19:51.990
the guys that got it keep all the shit and then they take it down to those

335
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:55.260
hardware stores and they sell it and that assholes like me.

336
00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:59.880
You have to fucking buy it back to fucking make the house look right again.

337
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.780
Um,
all right.
That's my advice.

338
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.980
My advice is the plumbing,
the electrical and your roof.

339
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.150
That's what I would start with.

340
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.930
Then you can deal with all the fucking drafts and all the other bullshit.

341
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.003
<v 3>MMM.</v>

342
00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.180
<v 1>All right.
I'm sorry guys.
My energy's just fuck.
I got nothing.
All right.</v>

343
00:20:20.181 --> 00:20:24.260
French guy with muscular dystrophy looking for lady advice.

344
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.040
Most share William Tet Rouge.

345
00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.410
<v 3>Uh,</v>

346
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.020
<v 1>what does that my something bill redhead.</v>

347
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.740
I'm a 39 year old man.
Going to take it.

348
00:20:38.741 --> 00:20:40.960
A fancy to this awesome lady.

349
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:45.760
We sometimes spend time together working on each other's professional and hobby

350
00:20:45.761 --> 00:20:48.550
projects and we lots of fun.

351
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.880
The Times we do hang out together to specify we're not coworkers,

352
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:57.940
but we have a similar circle of friends.
Here's the catch.
She's 27,

353
00:20:57.941 --> 00:21:02.941
but I'm 39 and have a disease called muscular dystrophy in case you don't know

354
00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:03.970
what it is.

355
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.410
It's a disease similar to the kid in the wheelchair in the Jim Jeffrey show and

356
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:10.150
set,
uh,

357
00:21:10.151 --> 00:21:13.480
the differences that in my case I'm a hard headed guy,

358
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.910
refused to accept my fate.

359
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.280
It exercise like crazy as a young lad while I still had some muscle mass to be

360
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:24.430
able to physically function well above expectations up to my adult years.

361
00:21:24.431 --> 00:21:28.450
That's great.
Uh,
it's only showed a little in the way that I've walked,

362
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.403
but that's it.

363
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:36.610
Also being physically disabled has really,
uh,

364
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.240
maybe learn to not take anything for granted and focus on my strengths,

365
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:45.070
which is really increased my personality skills and gave me game enough to have

366
00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:48.610
a few great relationships,
not lower my standards and it's worked so far.

367
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.690
All right.
So what is the problem,
sir?
This seems,
it seems all good.

368
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.000
Uh,
anyways,

369
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.620
since I've developed feelings for this 27 year old girl,

370
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.280
I've been hesitant to tell her about it.
If she says no and rejects me,

371
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.380
no big deal.
I've been rejected before.

372
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:08.620
Like most other guys out there and it's something I can handle.

373
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.100
It's basically going to suck for a couple days tops and everything is fine after

374
00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:16.750
that,
but I guess I'm more afraid if she says yes,
she's still young.

375
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:21.520
I'm hitting the gym as much as I can to keep myself out of any wheelchair and

376
00:22:21.521 --> 00:22:25.600
crutches and slow this thing down as much as I can.
However,
in the past 10 years,

377
00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:28.720
this disease has really been taking a toll on me,
Jesus Christ,

378
00:22:28.721 --> 00:22:31.810
to think that it's shit that I bitch about this,
someone dealing with this crap.

379
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.590
I feel my body is going downhill to the point that stairs now look like

380
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:39.550
mountains.
If I fall,
I can't get up on my own,
which is scary to me.

381
00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.880
This girl has been single for a while and has been complaining about being

382
00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:46.390
single,
but she's also young and as her whole life ahead of her.
And I'm not sure

383
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.300
if I'm still going to be able to wipe,

384
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.110
be able to wipe my own ass and 10 years and I don't want to put someone through

385
00:22:53.111 --> 00:22:57.430
the same pain in the future as that woman and family guy was married to Joe in

386
00:22:57.431 --> 00:23:02.290
the wheelchair.
Uh,
should I invest my feelings and not regret it,
you know,

387
00:23:02.291 --> 00:23:03.310
so at least I tried,

388
00:23:03.311 --> 00:23:06.310
or should I just keep it to myself and not waste a vital part of her life?

389
00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:09.100
If she does say yes,
Merci beaucoup.

390
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.360
Delaer Amen.
See seizures.

391
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:18.250
Just sweet frank.
Koebel I don't know what the fuck.
Thanks a lot.

392
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:21.550
Uh,

393
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.670
and same if I am something.

394
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.003
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

395
00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.690
<v 1>I don't what does,
just see qual,
ma'am.
I mean,</v>

396
00:23:32.691 --> 00:23:34.490
literally that's I am when?

397
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.950
Same Gross Party.
Okay.

398
00:23:38.951 --> 00:23:43.840
I'm a big fan of the Bruins and I hate the Montreal Canadians with a passion.

399
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:48.830
He wrote that in French.
You the Tesla Canadians Demario a vacuum passion,

400
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:54.590
just recall mill or grow participant influence.
Um,

401
00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.100
I would fucking tell her everything he said to me.
He said,
listen,

402
00:23:58.101 --> 00:24:01.670
I got fields for you.
I really like your point.
I'm 39 years old.

403
00:24:01.671 --> 00:24:02.720
I had muscular dystrophy.

404
00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:05.493
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

405
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.020
<v 1>And I don't want to waste you fucker.
I wouldn't know if I'd say all that.</v>

406
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.290
I'd fucking ask her out.
And then,
you know,

407
00:24:11.291 --> 00:24:13.960
if you guys hit it off then I would say all that other shit,

408
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.640
<v 3>you know?
Does that make sense?</v>

409
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.800
<v 1>Just don't dump the whole thing and I don't.</v>

410
00:24:21.801 --> 00:24:24.560
So talk about her having to wipe your ass in 10 years to figure that'd be a

411
00:24:24.561 --> 00:24:25.394
fucking buzzkill.

412
00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:27.503
<v 3>MMM.</v>

413
00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.830
<v 1>But you know,
you do want to be fucking up front.
I would,
I would think,</v>

414
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:33.883
<v 3>uh,</v>

415
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:38.010
<v 1>I got a buddy of mine,
his wife's like that.
She's got the same thing.</v>

416
00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.440
I tell her she has ms ethic.

417
00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:45.380
So she has like days where she's like super tired and everything.
Uh,

418
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.290
why do I complain about Dumb Shit Life for this?
People like this out there.
Uh,

419
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.670
sir.
I would ask her out.

420
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.513
<v 3>Okay.</v>

421
00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:58.500
<v 1>She's a big girl.
She's fucking 27 years old.
All right.
Ask her out.</v>

422
00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.761
Do every year.

423
00:24:59.761 --> 00:25:03.700
You're probably fucking live in more in the moment than most people.
Um,

424
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.173
<v 3>you know,</v>

425
00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.400
<v 1>fuck.
I mean,
life flies by.</v>

426
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.950
Forget about when you're dealing with some shit that you're dealing with.
So,

427
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.250
you know,
you're a good guy.
You're actually care about it.
You know,

428
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.710
she care about another person like that.

429
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:22.720
You don't want to waste the best part of their life dealing with you.
But,

430
00:25:22.721 --> 00:25:27.700
um,
who knows?
Maybe you guys hit it off,
ask her out,
dude,
ask her out.
You know?

431
00:25:27.701 --> 00:25:31.540
But then it moves on to another level that I would talk about that other stuff

432
00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:36.570
and see what she says.
All right.
Drug dealing roommate.
Well,

433
00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.730
this is going to be easy.
Um,
move out or kick them up.
All right.
Hey,
Billy,

434
00:25:39.731 --> 00:25:43.150
ball breaker.
I'm from the,
I'm from right outside of Philly.
Nother one.

435
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.820
Don't hold it against me.
Dom Arrera has a good shit.

436
00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:50.350
I have nothing against Philadelphia.
I just had a fucking tough show there.
Okay.

437
00:25:50.351 --> 00:25:51.850
And I made fun affiliate.
I was somewhere else.

438
00:25:51.851 --> 00:25:52.990
It would have missed the front of somewhere else,

439
00:25:52.991 --> 00:25:54.220
but I don't have a problem with it.
All right.

440
00:25:54.221 --> 00:25:57.990
But I'm 28 and one of my roommates is a deal.
Oh,

441
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.570
congratulations to filling one of the super bowl.
You know,
I,
I can say that now.

442
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.170
The pain's gone away.
Uh,
it was great when I first moved in.

443
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:06.630
<v 3>Okay.</v>

444
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.970
<v 1>At 22 and all I had to do for some pot was walk upstairs,</v>

445
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.480
but now we've sort of grown up and he's pushing some other shit,

446
00:26:12.481 --> 00:26:14.670
which worries me about the safety of our crib.

447
00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:19.080
Should I approach him and ask him to knock it off or just fuck his girlfriend

448
00:26:19.081 --> 00:26:21.450
and then the friendship.
That's hilarious.
Thanks.

449
00:26:21.451 --> 00:26:24.660
And instead of go fuck yourself and wish you the lovely Nia and your baby girl.

450
00:26:24.661 --> 00:26:29.370
Nothing but the best.
See you in AC in October.
Go Birds.
Uh,

451
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.950
go birds.
Is that the Orioles?
Is that the eagles?

452
00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.650
There's a lot of birds down there,
man.
Um,

453
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:43.240
what should you do?
I don't think when somebody is dealing coke.
Uh,

454
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:44.860
<v 2>okay.</v>

455
00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.740
<v 1>Heroin.
What else would be up?
The ecstasy.</v>

456
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.210
<v 2>Okay.</v>

457
00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.120
<v 1>Math.
I don't think you can just say,
hey,</v>

458
00:26:52.121 --> 00:26:54.760
we get knock it off like they have their stereo too loud.

459
00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.790
I mean this person has made a decision that this is how they get to earn a

460
00:26:57.791 --> 00:27:02.080
living.
So I would get the fuck out of there is what I would do.

461
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.300
I would not fuck his girlfriend.

462
00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:05.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

463
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:10.190
<v 1>Cause he might be trying his own fucking drugs is drugs.</v>

464
00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:12.870
Might tell them to do something fucking crazy to you while you're sleeping.

465
00:27:12.871 --> 00:27:17.690
So I would die.
I get the fuck out of there is what I would do.
He goes,

466
00:27:17.691 --> 00:27:20.420
one of these days you're going to be asleep and the door's going to get kicked

467
00:27:20.421 --> 00:27:20.571
in.

468
00:27:20.571 --> 00:27:24.950
It's going to be the cops and you can be fucking face down with a boot and your

469
00:27:24.951 --> 00:27:27.350
back getting fucking handcuffed.
And then he,
then they're going to be like,

470
00:27:27.351 --> 00:27:32.150
did you know he's dealing drugs?
Uh,
no,
he's going to rat you up.
You know,

471
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:37.010
that's shit.
He used to buy them off me.
Uh,
cause he's a piece of shit.
Well,

472
00:27:37.011 --> 00:27:37.551
maybe he's a good,

473
00:27:37.551 --> 00:27:40.940
when we use a drug dealer with a heart of gold and he gets you out of it.
Yes.

474
00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.690
You don't need that the fuck.
Get out of there.

475
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.330
Do you want names on the lease?
Uh,

476
00:27:49.331 --> 00:27:52.600
I would kick him out if he doesn't leave that I would just find someplace else

477
00:27:52.601 --> 00:27:57.340
to live.
Um,
all right.
Let me read a little advertising here.

Is it maybe you fell for the Scandinavian aesthetic?
Oh,

511
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.580
you know what I actually did?
We bought some fancy fucking couch.
It's stinks.

512
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:10.070
It's too many pillows.
You just can't even relax on it.
I hate that couch.
Uh,

513
00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.740
maybe the cushions lost that pop for owners ago.

546
00:32:27.241 --> 00:32:31.530
story?
I was at the laugh factory a couple nights ago

547
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.670
and I get off stage and this guy comes up to me

548
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:41.930
like he does hair transplant surgery and he's got like his card,
right.

549
00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.020
<v 4>Okay.</v>

550
00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.500
<v 1>When I just realized the volume is way down or this fucking thing.
Hello,
hello,</v>

551
00:32:47.501 --> 00:32:50.560
hello.
So the guy fucking,

552
00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:56.920
he comes up to me after my set,
he goes,
hey man,
I can fix that.

553
00:32:56.921 --> 00:32:58.930
I could fix that.
Talking about my bald head,

554
00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:02.140
and he's got this before and after photos gut.
Now here's the thing I've taught.

555
00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:06.520
This is the third time.
This same guy,
he's approached me all right?

556
00:33:06.521 --> 00:33:09.670
The first time it was,
it was fucking,
I laughed.
It was hilarious.

557
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.890
You know,
cause he said the same thing.
He came up to me,
he goes,
Hey,

558
00:33:14.891 --> 00:33:19.360
I can fix that.
I didn't go to his place and say,
hey man,

559
00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.090
I don't like the way I look.
You know,

560
00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:27.120
he just walked up to me and was so convinced that I thought I looked as awful

561
00:33:28.181 --> 00:33:28.450
is.

562
00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:32.380
He evidently thought I looked that he thought it was totally fine to come up to

563
00:33:32.381 --> 00:33:37.180
me and just say,
Hey,
I can fix that,
you know?
And I laughed and I said,
Oh man,

564
00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:39.580
I go,
I'm cool.
I'm cool.
I liked the way I look.
You know,

565
00:33:39.581 --> 00:33:42.580
I'm actually getting better roles now that I look.
I look like a fucking,

566
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.400
you know,
before I used to,
I look like howdy doody.
I didn't get good parts.

567
00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:48.851
Now you know,

568
00:33:48.851 --> 00:33:52.450
I get to play fucking assholes because I look like what I always was one,

569
00:33:52.451 --> 00:33:56.790
but I didn't always look like what?
So he's like,
hi.
You know?
Yeah.

570
00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:00.280
That I ran into when I was down in Largo,
same guy.
And I was just like,

571
00:34:00.281 --> 00:34:03.970
Jesus Christ my body.
I'm fire fire,
right?

572
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:10.660
So anyways,
I was doing Kevin Nealon show

573
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:16.470
a Tuesday at the laugh factory and I get off stage and this fucking guy comes up

574
00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:19.380
to me again.
He goes,
hey,
you know,
I can fix that.
And he goes,

575
00:34:19.381 --> 00:34:22.290
I'm the best of the business.
First of all,
dude,

576
00:34:22.291 --> 00:34:24.180
if you're the best in the business,
then like,

577
00:34:24.181 --> 00:34:28.290
why are you fucking running up to comics who just got off stage at a comedy club

578
00:34:28.291 --> 00:34:32.600
handing out Your Business Card?
You know,
you like a fucking,
like a,

579
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.450
like a rapper who just started,
who selling mix tapes out of his fucking,

580
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.400
if you're the best in the fucking business,

581
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:43.500
you know I people should be walking into your office as you pose.

582
00:34:43.501 --> 00:34:48.490
He rushing up to people,
right?
So I said to the guy,
I go,
Jesus Christ,

583
00:34:48.491 --> 00:34:50.730
do I go,
this is a third fucking time he came up to me,

584
00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.560
I'm fine the way I look.
I look fine.
He goes,

585
00:34:55.561 --> 00:34:58.410
you look like an area is what he said.

586
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:03.630
So I finally,
I just kind of snapped a little bit on it,

587
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:08.540
you know what I mean?
Cause it was like,
it kind of was not funny anymore.

588
00:35:08.541 --> 00:35:12.090
It was just like,
dude,
like

589
00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:13.660
<v 4>yeah,</v>

590
00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.190
<v 1>you fucking harassing me here.</v>

591
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:16.690
<v 4>Okay,</v>

592
00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:21.340
<v 1>I don't want it.
I'm sorry.
I don't want fucking hair plugs.
What do you do?</v>

593
00:35:21.341 --> 00:35:23.410
You know what it is.
He wants to fuck.
He wants,

594
00:35:23.411 --> 00:35:27.610
he wants a fucking comedian that's got some TV credits that he could do it so

595
00:35:27.611 --> 00:35:32.200
you can be like,
you know,
you know,
just,
just as bill bird,
I'll stand there going,

596
00:35:32.201 --> 00:35:34.200
I love my hair products,
you know,

597
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.490
and his fucking commercial so you can go out and get a boat.

598
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:41.250
Because that's where I felt like he was trying to use me.
You know what I mean?

599
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.750
Try to use my bald head so we could go out and get the fucking boat and the big

600
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:50.070
tented whore off off of my fucking,
you know,
male pattern baldness.

601
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.830
I thought he was going to use me like,

602
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.860
like fucking Sharon Osborne did to those people on that fucking album.

603
00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.800
Shabazz filing.
Yeah.
Do I got,

604
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.910
I got enough money and now for the stupid fucking hair plugs,
they don't,

605
00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:07.740
I don't want your dumb ass hair plugs.
And he's like,
all right,
sorry.
I,

606
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:12.630
I appreciate what you do.
And I felt bad because he kind of walked away.
But uh,

607
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.830
how funny is that?
He's fucking slinking up to you at a comedy club.

608
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.360
He does hair transplants.

609
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:23.010
It's like 10 o'clock at night and he's slaking up to me handing my business his

610
00:36:23.011 --> 00:36:26.910
business card.
And he had the fucking nerve to say I'm the best in the business.

611
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.780
The why does this feel so dirty,
sir,

612
00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:37.050
that he's going to fucking ask me if I wanted an abortion.
Uh,

613
00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.820
alright.
Hymns wasn't us.
It was hymns.

614
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:46.050
66% of men lose their hair by the age of 35.

615
00:36:46.051 --> 00:36:48.390
Is that right man?

616
00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:51.270
There's a lot of people out there with hair plugs cause you don't see six out.

617
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:53.190
It's almost 710 guys.

618
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:58.410
Thing is when you start to lose you to notice hair loss,
it's too late.

619
00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:00.810
It's easier to keep the hair.

620
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:04.620
You have to replace the hair you've lost.

621
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.301
I ask you,

622
00:37:06.301 --> 00:37:11.301
why did guys turn to weird solutions or do nothing when they can turn to

623
00:37:11.431 --> 00:37:12.960
medicine in science?

624
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:17.760
Well cause she just fucking man up and accept your fate.
I don't know.

Yeah.

640
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.310
For those of you who don't want to be bald,
personally,
I don't give a shit.

641
00:38:29.311 --> 00:38:31.770
I actually love having a shaved head.
I'm not even gonna lie to Ya.

642
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:36.310
And I know I look like a freak,
but it's kind of fucking awesome.
Um,

643
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:42.360
you know,
people think you know Jujitsu,
he don't know Jujitsu,
right?

644
00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:45.550
Um,
hey,
I can help you with that.

645
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.500
Jesus Christ body.
I know I looked bad.

646
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:52.930
I didn't know I looked that bad that you could just fucking walk.
Right.

647
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:55.870
I can imagine if he gave boob jobs and he just walked up to subject,
Hey,

648
00:38:55.871 --> 00:38:59.200
can I help you with that?
Now you look terrible when tits go in this way.

649
00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:01.300
The other go the other way.
All right.
Quip.

650
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:05.200
The truth is most of us are brushing our teeth wrong.

651
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.160
How you brush your teeth wrong,
uh,

652
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:12.730
not for long enough and forget to change our brush on time.
All right,

653
00:39:12.731 --> 00:39:13.540
fair enough.

654
00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:18.540
That's because most brands focus on selling flashy gimmicks rather than better

655
00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:21.880
brushing,
but not quit on that.
These guys have quit.

656
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:26.410
So what makes quip so different?
You may have asked,
maybe didn't ask,

657
00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:31.030
but I asked for you for status.
Quip is an electric toothbrush.

658
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.100
That's a fraction of the cost of bulkier brushes on,

659
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.590
it's a guy I didn't know it was electric.

660
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:39.610
I have a gas toothbrush a while still packing,

661
00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:43.620
just I have to hook,
plug it into the stove or plugging it.

662
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:44.560
That will be electric bill.

663
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:48.520
While still packing just the right amount of vibration to help clean your teeth.

664
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:53.470
Quip built quips built in timer,
helps you clean,
uh,

665
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:54.490

673
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:29.710
And finally,
everyone loves quip.
They were on Oprah's o list.

674
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:35.690
Jesus how full of herself as she.
This is the oldest,
uh,

675
00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:37.050
Oprah's oldest,

676
00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:41.200

All right,

686
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:26.050
the fuck was I just going to go look up.
That made me want to look something up.

687
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.590
It wasn't for hymns.
I have no idea if I already forget.

688
00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:34.000
You forget it.

689
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.180
<v 5>All right guys,
I apologize.
How fucking sick I have here.
Uh,</v>

690
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:43.550

691
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:47.600
where I wasn't fucking sick,
hopefully.
All right.
God bless you.

692
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:52.040
God bless the United States that the applicant's Democrats and libertarians

693
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:58.220
people would love groups,
anti social people,

694
00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:00.141
follow people,

695
00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:03.410
people at the back of comedy clubs who had up business cards for hair plugs.

696
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.240
All right.
Have a great weekend and I'll talk to you about that.

697
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:16.120
<v 6>Oh,</v>

698
00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:17.430
did you enjoy the 4th of July?
You know,

699
00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:19.770
<v 5>right out of the gate,
right out of the gate.</v>

700
00:43:19.771 --> 00:43:24.771
I want to thank everybody that did some dumb shit with fireworks and it had the

701
00:43:25.201 --> 00:43:29.280
presence of mind to fucking make a youtube video out of it,

702
00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.950
you know?
So guys like make it just sit down.

703
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.160
I was laughing my ass off last night I went to bed and I was watching people

704
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:39.540
shooting bottle rockets out of their ass,
having a Roman candle fights,

705
00:43:39.541 --> 00:43:41.340
seen somebody take one to the face.

706
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:46.700
Do you know some guy in Maine lit something off on top of his fucking head and

707
00:43:46.801 --> 00:43:50.580
he died instantly.
They were like,
he lit off,

708
00:43:50.581 --> 00:43:54.570
they said a mortar or something.
Fucking insane.

709
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:57.360
What could,
what kind of,
you know,

710
00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:02.040
kind of a fucking asshole would do something like that.
He must have had it.

711
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.930
There's no way.

712
00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:09.450
Everybody knows once you get up to anything like a pack of firecrackers on your

713
00:44:09.451 --> 00:44:11.340
head you like,
that's,
that's funny,

714
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.640
you're going to fucking kill your ear drums and you know,

715
00:44:14.641 --> 00:44:15.900
but you're going to survive.

716
00:44:15.901 --> 00:44:18.600
But what would he put an mat in his mouth or something?

717
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:24.690
Well I dunno bill,
you fucking brought it up.
All right,
relax.
What's this look up?

718
00:44:24.691 --> 00:44:28.620
Main guy dies.
Fireworks.

719
00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:34.470
All right.
Shoots off firework from top of his head dies instantly.

720
00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:38.430
A 22 year old man was drinking and celebrating the 4th of July.

721
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.720
Happy Birthday to America.
Don't put it on my head.

722
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:46.740
Happy Birthday to America.
I'll fucking lie today.

723
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.470
Happy Birthday.
Wow.

724
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.000
<v 3>Michael.
Oh my God.
Somebody calling me.
I'll do it.</v>

725
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.900
<v 5>Um,
that's how I went down.</v>

726
00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.670
22 year old man who was drinking and celebrating the 4th of July.

727
00:45:00.671 --> 00:45:03.560
I tried to launch a firework from Trump.
Is his head killing him instantly.

728
00:45:03.561 --> 00:45:07.230
Authority said
30 said,

729
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:09.690
you've got to be an authority to say that somebody is fucking dead after the

730
00:45:09.691 --> 00:45:14.060
light.
Something off on their head.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Claire.
Claire,

731
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:18.120
the way.
Click yes.
Yes,
he is dead.
Well,
we kind of knew that you guys,

732
00:45:18.121 --> 00:45:22.710
Brian's although the sidewalk.
Watch your mouth woman once your mouth woman.

733
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:27.330
It's one of my favorite quotes in sports over the last fucking,

734
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.270
I dunno how many months.
Six months.
Watch your mouth woman.

735
00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.180
When that woman called,
uh,

736
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.140
asked the Braun what it was like to be a punk ass bitch and then that guy's

737
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.480
going to watch your mouth woman watch your mouth woman and you know,

738
00:45:39.481 --> 00:45:41.390
you would think that the broads would've had such,

739
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.340
which have fucking difficulty with it.
Like you know,

740
00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:48.480
I realized that she said something derogatory towards him.

741
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:53.730
Excuse,
go change your Bra Lady.
All right.

742
00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:57.030
I love that they didn't say anything cause even they knew even they knew that I

743
00:45:57.031 --> 00:45:58.500
guide.
Yeah that bitch was out of line.

744
00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:05.100
I'm just talking shit today.
Um,

745
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.820
they won't say what kind of fireworks it was.

746
00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:10.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

747
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:14.590
<v 5>All right.
Apparently he thought that was a great idea that have just,</v>

748
00:46:14.591 --> 00:46:17.620
when you died in a stupid fucking way and when somebody starts it off when they

749
00:46:17.621 --> 00:46:20.980
start your yield eulogy off with apparently.
Yeah.

750
00:46:20.981 --> 00:46:25.390
Apparently this Keto sticking his head in the garbage disposal was a,
you know,

751
00:46:25.391 --> 00:46:29.380
going to give them a good buzz.
I mean,
I'm sorry to bring it up Claire,

752
00:46:29.381 --> 00:46:33.600
but you know how did even get it in there?
Oh,

753
00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:37.840
let Lou Ya.
Um,
his friends said they thought,

754
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:38.830
<v 3>okay.</v>

755
00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:42.040
<v 5>They thought they dissuaded him from doing it.
The next thing they knew,</v>

756
00:46:42.041 --> 00:46:44.890
he ignited the firework and he was killed instantly.

757
00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:47.590
What the fuck did he shoot off?

758
00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

759
00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.080
<v 5>There was no rushing him to the hospital.</v>

760
00:46:53.081 --> 00:46:55.750
There was no Devin left when I got there.

761
00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:01.300
Said 25 year old Cody.
Jesus Christ.
The names at this generation,

762
00:47:01.301 --> 00:47:06.070
Huh?
Devin Cody
jeep wrangler.
Uh,

763
00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.880
Devin was the kind of person who would do something stupid.
Absolutely.

764
00:47:09.881 --> 00:47:13.510
He was the kind of person who would pretend to do something stupid to make

765
00:47:13.511 --> 00:47:15.730
people laugh.
Well,
he wasn't faking it.

766
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.983
<v 3>MMM.</v>

767
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.510
<v 5>All right.</v>

768
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:24.510
It's the first fireworks fatality since they legalized fireworks January 1st,

769
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:28.590
2012 while he just fucked it up for the whole state.
It's bad enough.

770
00:47:28.591 --> 00:47:32.820
Everyone's on heroin now.
You're going to give them fireworks mean.

771
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:37.540
What next does isis get their own juice store?

772
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.210
<v 3>Come on.
People.</v>

773
00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:46.480
<v 5>Over 80% of bottle rockets are shot out of people's anuses in this state alone.</v>

774
00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:50.280
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

775
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.440
<v 5>This needs to stop.</v>

776
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.430
<v 3>Woo.</v>

777
00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.230
<v 5>That's going on in main street right now in Maine.</v>

778
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:59.550
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

779
00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:01.830
<v 5>Hi.
Do you know me?
Of course you don't.</v>

780
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:06.030
I'm your regular housewife here in Maine.

781
00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:08.430
My son is on heroin.

782
00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:13.170
My other son shot a Roman candle up his ass.

783
00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:18.150
I'm sorry to be graphic.
He was trying to shoot it out of his ass.

784
00:48:18.151 --> 00:48:22.380
But apparently his excitement.

785
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:23.700
<v 0>Okay.</v>

786
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.030
<v 5>What was getting who?
I mean,
in order to light the wick,</v>

787
00:48:26.031 --> 00:48:30.500
you've gotta be able to see it.
So I dunno how they think we're done.

788
00:48:30.501 --> 00:48:34.070
When we were kids,
we just,
we let them and we ran away.

789
00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:36.470
We hit under our desks.
That's what we did.

790
00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:40.830
Devin was a great person.
Um,

791
00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:46.520
and in New Jersey at 52 year old man blew off a large piece of his leg below the

792
00:48:47.041 --> 00:48:52.041
knee when he set off a tennis ball size firework in Montana,

793
00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.150
Montana,
Montana,

794
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:58.950
a 32 year old man was killed at his billings home in a fireworks accident

795
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.350
involving a mortar tube.

796
00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:03.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

797
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.070
<v 5>All right.
At least there was some sort of mortar round.
I mean,
mortar around.</v>

798
00:49:06.071 --> 00:49:09.440
I mean,
first of all,
when you start light off shit,

799
00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:13.420
well your neighbor starts screaming and comment.
You know what,

800
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:14.890
what do you think is going to happen?

801
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

802
00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.330
<v 5>It's look up a mortar tube here,
everybody.</v>

803
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:21.540
I'm learning about fireworks through the death of my fellow Americans.

804
00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:26.960
<v 3>Um,
I spelt motor.
All right.</v>

805
00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.140
<v 5>Firework,
mortar tubes.
How about some images?
Let me see.</v>

806
00:49:31.141 --> 00:49:34.260
What the fuck these things look like.
Is there some sort of,

807
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:41.080
all right.
All I see is army guys.
Yeah,

808
00:49:41.081 --> 00:49:44.710
that's not good.
You know when,
when the shit you're shooting off.

809
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:45.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

810
00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:46.890
<v 5>Oh,
there we go.</v>

811
00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.100
<v 0>Okay,</v>

812
00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:53.060
<v 5>well there's one that looks like a little barbershop thing.
One off fucking dope.</v>

813
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:57.170
He shot that off his head.
You know what probably happened,

814
00:49:57.171 --> 00:50:00.890
I would guess is that there was some sort of discharge from the bottom end of it

815
00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.780
and the concussive force,

816
00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:06.410
but it seems like there was no Deviney fucking blew his head off.

817
00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:11.560
You know,
Jesus want a way to start.
I had such a wonderful weekend.
Um,

818
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:14.510
I didn't mean this one.
I was talking about funny shit.
I was just talking about,

819
00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:19.010
you know,
people haven't Roman candle fights.
Come on,
we all did that shit.
Right?

820
00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:20.270
That's bait.

821
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:25.270
That is the evolution of all weaponry and all right?

822
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:30.080
Anything that has an device,
anything that,
that,
uh,

823
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:34.280
it's supposed to do.
Anything that,
that fucking blow shit up.
You just,

824
00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:39.110
you start or you,
anything that you can shoot at a target.

825
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.940
It always starts simple.
Let's light it off.
You know,

826
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:48.560
let's,
let's point it in that direction at the trees,
right?

827
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.470
And then what?
Then you move up to a,
let's torture some insects.
Uh,

828
00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:57.470
let's shoot a bird.
And eventually,

829
00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:02.570
because you know,
the way human beings are,

830
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.720
that we always try to top one another and we get bored,

831
00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:09.880
which is the reason why we went from walking to the horse to the car.

832
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:12.500
I'm really in deep right now.
I know.

833
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:14.420
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Eventually,

834
00:51:14.421 --> 00:51:18.110
you're going to move to the,
the,
the ultimate prey,
the human being,

835
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:21.860
you know,
something that can think the same way.

836
00:51:21.861 --> 00:51:26.120
You do something that may have done better in math than you did.
You know,

837
00:51:26.121 --> 00:51:29.630
that's the challenge.
This person passed Algebra.
I did not.

838
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.760
We're both trying to kill one another is,
you know,

839
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:37.520
first outside,
inside,

840
00:51:37.521 --> 00:51:40.940
last gonna come into play here when we're out in the woods

841
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:44.870
are opposite angles being congruent?

842
00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:51.040
Is that going to be the death of me or do I just have that extra something?

843
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:56.150
Do I want it a little bit more?
Am I able to block out the fifth commandment?

844
00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:02.330
Do I have such a strong religious background than I can hear God's voice in my

845
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:06.530
head telling me that I'm right telling me to deliver?

846
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.630
That animal is not even a man anymore.
It's a fucking Hannibal.

847
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:12.860
Deliver that animal

848
00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:19.280
in the express lane to its maker.
Right.

849
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.490
Do I have that?
I mean,
it's inevitable.

850
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:25.820
That's personally why I don't fuck with fireworks.

851
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:31.240
I don't fuck with fireworks because I know that I am scatterbrained and I get

852
00:52:32.031 --> 00:52:37.031
bored easily and I have 10,000 fucking hobbies and eventually lighting it off on

853
00:52:37.641 --> 00:52:41.990
the driveway is not going to be enough for me.
Okay.
I have neighbors,

854
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.640
I have neighbors that I get along with.

855
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:49.190
Maybe I'm bored with the fact that I get along with them.
Maybe I want to stop.

856
00:52:49.191 --> 00:52:53.300
Maybe some days you just wake up and you just want to start some shit and you

857
00:52:53.301 --> 00:52:57.680
just happen to have some fireworks that don't just blow up.

858
00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.750
They go way up in the air

859
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:03.780
and you want to shoot somebody.
Right.

860
00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.250
Anyways,
my condolences to anybody,
uh,

861
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:12.110
who knows somebody that died and I don't have any condolences for the people

862
00:53:12.111 --> 00:53:15.740
that die because you're fucking dead and you either dead or I think you were in

863
00:53:15.741 --> 00:53:20.300
a better place because someone who's dumb enough to blow themselves up on the

864
00:53:20.301 --> 00:53:23.300
July 4th weekend with their own goddamn explosive,

865
00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:28.540
I don't think ever had the brains to really hurt another human being knowingly.

866
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:33.410
I never knowingly lied,
knowingly hurt another fucking human being.

867
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:36.510
I mean,
honestly,
if you're that fucking stupid,

868
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:39.420
obviously could go out and hurt somebody,
but you know,

869
00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:45.270
you really have the mental capacity to understand,
you know,

870
00:53:45.271 --> 00:53:46.104
your actions.

871
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:55.330
<v 7>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

872
00:54:55.331 --> 00:55:00.331
It's Belper and it's the Monday morning podcast for July 5th,

873
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:05.650
2010 one day after the birthday of this country.

874
00:55:05.651 --> 00:55:08.920
Happy Birthday to America.

875
00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.650
Happy Birthday to the USA.

876
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.740
Happy Birthday.
Fuck every other country.
You know,

877
00:55:17.770 --> 00:55:20.020
like a Sadie way,

878
00:55:21.070 --> 00:55:23.530
you fucking douchebags.
Um,

879
00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:27.650
Jesus Christ,

880
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.000
happy birthday to one of the most hated countries on the face of the fucking

881
00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:35.670
planet.
You know,
everybody's shitting on us.

882
00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:39.510
All those fucking World Cup referees.
You know,

883
00:55:39.511 --> 00:55:43.560
people tugging on our shirts,
kicking us in our fucking American balls.

884
00:55:43.561 --> 00:55:44.760
They don't see any of it.

885
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:49.720
A reason why we're out of the World Cup is because of our foreign policy.

886
00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:53.390
That's why,
that's why we were always off sides.

887
00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:58.360
They never were the Ganges.
Does whoever the fuck kicked our ass?
I Dunno.

888
00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:01.870
Um,
is the World Cup still going?

889
00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:05.620
Is the world's still watching?
Let me ask the world the question.

890
00:56:05.621 --> 00:56:09.970
When your team gets knocked out,
do you tap out and like,
yeah,
fuck the World Cup,

891
00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.011
you know,

892
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:15.840
and you go back to your hut and your grind up corn in that little guacamole
bowl.

893
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:20.100
They do that.
Um,
what exactly is done?

894
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.720
Do you continue watching?
I mean,

895
00:56:21.721 --> 00:56:26.721
cause I watch NFL football and when the New England Patriots got raped by the

896
00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:33.310
Baltimore Ravens,
I continued to watch the uh,
the playoffs.
Playoffs,
yes.

897
00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:37.000
Playoffs.
I continued to watch them.
And uh,

898
00:56:37.001 --> 00:56:40.240
so I was wondering if you guys are so into soccer.
Yes.

899
00:56:40.241 --> 00:56:44.560
And I am calling it soccer because it's,
it's our birthday this week,

900
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.810
so I'm not going to fucking cow down to you.

901
00:56:46.811 --> 00:56:50.220
Motherfuckers had said call it football,
you know,

902
00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:54.220
just cause you have a ball and you can only kick it with your foot.
You know,

903
00:56:54.221 --> 00:56:57.010
you guys think you're so clever.
Oh,
that's real football.
Really.

904
00:56:57.070 --> 00:57:01.870
You can kick it with both feet,
can't ya?
Why isn't it feet ball?
What's the deal?

905
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:07.870
Um,
look at me with a head of fucking steam.

906
00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:12.670
I'm hung over to feel like shit.
Had a bunch of fucking 4th of July Barbecue,

907
00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:17.920
you know?
Is it ever good?
Is it ever good?
Oh,
look at the ribs.

908
00:57:17.921 --> 00:57:22.921
All slathered in fucking glistening in fucking fat and you get over there and

909
00:57:24.131 --> 00:57:26.950
you stick your fat American face right into it.

910
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:31.330
It's all over your face like some fucking two year old trying to eat birthday

911
00:57:31.331 --> 00:57:36.010
cake.
You know,
in your run your hand through your hair with it.

912
00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:41.110
Get that fucking grizzled Moose look going.
That's right.

913
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:46.240
Then you have sex with some underage girl in a hot tub and you have to fleet of

914
00:57:46.241 --> 00:57:51.130
France because in France,
that's a fucking acceptable America.

915
00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:56.710
Um,
no,
actually I had some great,
some great food yesterday.

916
00:57:56.711 --> 00:58:01.540
I just had too much of it.
I just could not stop stuffing my fat face.

917
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:05.950
I was that kind of full where I couldn't stay in one position.

918
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:09.910
I was like sitting down and then after a while that wasn't comfortable,

919
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:12.910
then I'd stand up for a minute and then that wouldn't be comfortable.

920
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:17.910
Then I had to like lean on the side of the person's house fucking with the

921
00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:19.540
foundation at that point.

922
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:26.430
But it was a good time birthday of America and actually went to a party.

923
00:58:26.531 --> 00:58:27.364
Uh,

924
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.630
there was just a little bit into the Hollywood hills and uh,

925
00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:35.650
was looking out over la and it's absolutely fucking hilarious.

926
00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:40.710
The amount of illegal fireworks that are shut off,
I dunno,

927
00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:45.520
in every city or an la in particular because I've never had like a bird's eye

928
00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:46.354
view.

929
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:51.130
And somebody made this hilarious joke that whereas we were looking out,

930
00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:55.270
it looked like when America bombed our United States,

931
00:58:55.271 --> 00:58:59.590
I should say the United States bombed a Baghdad.

932
00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.500
And then as we were watching the fireworks going off,

933
00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:06.050
they should have been like a little CNN logo down on the lefthand side of,
uh,

934
00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:07.000
our eyeballs.

935
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:11.140
And then we all had a big laugh after this person made that hilarious joke,
man,

936
00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:16.390
remember that shit?
You know,
it really made me feel like,
you know,

937
00:59:16.391 --> 00:59:20.770
what the fuck
wasn't that a deep thought?

938
00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:24.080
It made me think,
what the Fuck Gi bill.

939
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:26.450
I don't think you need to elaborate on that anymore.

940
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:30.020
I think you really summed it up.
Nah,
just thinking like,
what,
uh,

941
00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:34.370
what would I be doing?
You know,
if,
uh,

942
00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:37.850
if I was sitting in a city that was getting bombed and I worked in like a

943
00:59:37.851 --> 00:59:41.690
fucking,
you know,
I was like,
ah,
I always say a hardware store for once,
Bill,

944
00:59:41.691 --> 00:59:46.670
can he come up with a different job?
Uh,
maybe I put shoes on the bottom of,
uh,

945
00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:51.140
uh,
lamas,
feats,
feats,
feet.

946
00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:55.310
You know there's a Lama like is that like an Australian animal or is that from

947
00:59:55.311 --> 00:59:58.370
the mid?
Uh,
I want to say the Midwest.
The Middle East.

948
00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:03.380
Every once in a while you see a lama in this fucking country and it almost

949
01:00:03.381 --> 01:00:05.930
causes an accident cause you like,

950
01:00:05.931 --> 01:00:10.230
what the fuck happened to that ponies neck?
Um,

951
01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:16.070
now it really made me think like,
I,
I laughed and then I felt bad.

952
01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:19.070
Like where the fuck do I get off laughing?
There's nothing funny about war.

953
01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.320
Even if we got to go in and we got to do the shit,

954
01:00:21.321 --> 01:00:22.550
there's just nothing funny about it.

955
01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:25.790
Cause there's a bunch of people on the fucking ground who had nothing to do with

956
01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:27.500
shit.
You know,

957
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.560
they had nothing to do with that maniac and is Tom Selleck mustache.

958
01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:32.750
They just trying to fucking survive.

959
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:37.790
And then these people come in there to rescue them and they end up getting

960
01:00:37.791 --> 01:00:41.420
fucking blown up.
And then here I am,

961
01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:46.790
feed my face like a fat fuck,
you know,

962
01:00:46.791 --> 01:00:50.000
just full of pork,
corn bread,

963
01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:53.570
some Nilla wafer dessert about four beers

964
01:00:55.250 --> 01:01:00.250
and I my ball in a slice of pizza watching fireworks in the fucking Hollywood

965
01:01:00.711 --> 01:01:03.050
hills.
Eh,
it looks like bad Baghdad.

966
01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:10.010
We all should have just projectile vomited right there in a tribute to the,

967
01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.710
the end of the Roman Empire.
He,
you know when they used to do,

968
01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.960
they had those rooms,
those puking rooms.

969
01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:19.130
He just sat there stuffing your face and then you would fucking go in there and

970
01:01:19.131 --> 01:01:19.964
just puke.

971
01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:24.860
Which is another fucking reason why these fucking European cunts really need to

972
01:01:24.861 --> 01:01:28.340
sit down and read a history book.
They always talk about how dumb we are.

973
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:33.470
The exact same shit that they're making fun of us for.
They've all done two,

974
01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:38.000
three times over every fucking one of them.
And I'd rattle off the stats,

975
01:01:38.001 --> 01:01:42.170
but I don't know him.
Please.

976
01:01:42.171 --> 01:01:44.990
You can tell me that little fucking midget Napoleon didn't.

977
01:01:44.991 --> 01:01:49.790
Stuff is fat face a little fucking Danny devito look and Douche bag.

978
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:53.960
Huh?
What happened to him?
He went to Waterloo.

979
01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:58.490
What's up with dad fucking Waterloo.
This is like typical fucking American,

980
01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:00.740
uh,
Shit Talk.
And I know,

981
01:02:00.741 --> 01:02:05.150
I know the major fucking players and I know the major battle names,

982
01:02:05.151 --> 01:02:08.850
but I have no idea what happened.
He went to Waterloo,

983
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.730
which I believe was at an Austria.

984
01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.500
Was that right down the street and Connecticut?
Where the fuck did that happen?

985
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:18.320
All I know is he went there and he got his little fucking ass kick.

986
01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.190
Did he ride a pony in the battle?

987
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:23.970
Because he was so little that if he actually fell off a real horse,

988
01:02:23.971 --> 01:02:26.310
it would be fallen off like a fucking skyscraper.

989
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.270
That little dose rubbing his fucking stomach.

990
01:02:30.271 --> 01:02:33.690
Cause he had an ulcer because he has that little dwarf stomach.
They can't,

991
01:02:33.691 --> 01:02:37.140
if they can't die,
Jess,
more than a couple of strawberries.

992
01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:42.570
And he's sitting there trying to fucking dive in and be the big guy.
He won't,

993
01:02:42.571 --> 01:02:44.310
you won't accept it.
Won't accept that he's,

994
01:02:44.311 --> 01:02:48.550
he's a little guy with little Oregon's and a little intestinal track.

995
01:02:48.551 --> 01:02:49.201
So what does he do?

996
01:02:49.201 --> 01:02:54.180
He stuffs his face trying to Audi in his fucking drill sergeant.
You know,

997
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.060
eating a Bronto Burger,
whatever they did back then.
Next thing you know,

998
01:02:57.061 --> 01:03:01.280
he's got an ulcer and this no pepto snow,
fucking Pepto,
you know,

999
01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:05.700
it's the 15 hundreds.
Did that on purpose just for all you fucking snobs.

1000
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:09.480
I know he was around in the 18 hundreds wasn't a hose.

1001
01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:13.500
It's 17 hundreds I dunno.
One of those ones where the,
where you're fucking,

1002
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:17.640
you're wore too much makeup.
You know,
when you curled up your hair,

1003
01:03:17.641 --> 01:03:20.730
like that chicken little house on the prairie that I was making a reference to,

1004
01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:24.960
Nelly,
Nelly Olson,
who's got a fucking book coming out,
doesn't she?

1005
01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.290
You know?

1006
01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:31.500
See now that's how you do it as a child star when you fall off.

1007
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:34.830
She never got involved in drugs,
you know,

1008
01:03:34.831 --> 01:03:39.831
she just kept fucking living off of her residuals.

1009
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:41.791
Granted,

1010
01:03:41.791 --> 01:03:45.750
she had the options because evidently that series plays all over the world,

1011
01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:51.510
you know?
But now she writes a book,
you know,

1012
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.520
you just keep milking it.
You just write a book.

1013
01:03:53.521 --> 01:03:58.521
Still Nelly Still Nellie after all these years and you answered the same fucking

1014
01:03:59.581 --> 01:04:04.530
questions over and over again.
How close was that character to the real you?

1015
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:06.900
If they're a little bit and Nellie in you,

1016
01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.460
if they're a little bit of Nellie and all of us,
you know,

1017
01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:15.060
and people wonder why those celebrities end up snapping in those fucking

1018
01:04:15.061 --> 01:04:15.690
interviews.

1019
01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:20.690
Somebody sent me a youtube video this week about Mel Gibson who's having another

1020
01:04:21.661 --> 01:04:24.240
rough week,
by the way.
He still,
no,
no,

1021
01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:28.530
no audio tape of him being a Douche has really come about.

1022
01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:29.940
I think that's just the,
uh,

1023
01:04:29.941 --> 01:04:33.720
the ex girlfriend claiming he did some shit like that.

1024
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:36.920
Either that or he's got a fucking unbelievable fucking lawyer,
which,
you know,

1025
01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:40.560
could be either or.
But uh,
what the hell is it?

1026
01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:45.360
Where the fuck is a youtube video?
Oh Man,
I was on such a role.

1027
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:49.980
What is my voice hurt?
Like I did a bunch of,
oh,
there it is.

1028
01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:51.510
Like I did a bunch of shows this weekend.

1029
01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:56.190
Was it because I was drunk yelling at people?
Um,
all right.
Uh,

1030
01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:59.460
Mel Gibson's,
here's a youtube video.
Look up Mel Gibson,

1031
01:04:59.461 --> 01:05:04.000
Dean Richard Calls Dean Richards and asshole and a,

1032
01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:06.660
somebody asks me my opinion on it.
And I think he was,

1033
01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:11.880
I think he was well within his fucking right to call him an asshole.

1034
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:15.270
Basically what happens is this guy goes,

1035
01:05:15.271 --> 01:05:20.260
the passive aggressive route where Mel comes on to hype is movie and Deeds.
Like,

1036
01:05:20.261 --> 01:05:22.540
you know,
hey,
it's great to have you here,
but Ba,
ba Ba,

1037
01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:25.910
and he could see Mel Mel's already defensive because he's got that anti-semite

1038
01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:30.910
rant hanging over his fucking head.
So He's already fucking just,

1039
01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.070
you know,
he could see it in his face like,
oh fuck,

1040
01:05:33.071 --> 01:05:35.560
let me just get through this fucking interview without this guy bringing the

1041
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:39.620
shit up.
So the guy that we fucking a he soft cells of whatever,

1042
01:05:39.621 --> 01:05:43.870
he did it passive aggressive.
Oh this about the movie that about the movie.

1043
01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:47.740
And then he goes,
yeah,
you know,
it's kind of some familiar ground.

1044
01:05:47.741 --> 01:05:49.570
I feel like I'm visiting an old friend,

1045
01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:51.760
which is a really country way of saying like,
yeah,

1046
01:05:51.761 --> 01:05:55.510
I've already seen you do this movie before,
but he doesn't come out and say it.

1047
01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:59.860
Mel Handles all of it with grace.
And then finally in the,
in the end,
you know,

1048
01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:04.090
he fucking suckers.
And with the overhand right going,
oh yeah.
Uh,

1049
01:06:04.091 --> 01:06:08.840
so how do you think the public's going to receive you?
And,
and he goes,

1050
01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.710
what do you mean?
He goes,
you know,
with a,
you know,

1051
01:06:11.711 --> 01:06:15.760
he's telling of your troubles that you've had in the past.

1052
01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:21.700
And Mel Goza,
well,
you know,
my life's kind of in a rollercoaster.
Uh,

1053
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:25.270
and the guy just keeps going and goes,
what exactly are you talking about?

1054
01:06:25.271 --> 01:06:29.110
And he just fucking,
he cause you know,
when he got drunk and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1055
01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:32.320
and he brings that shit up again.
And Mel's like,
dude,

1056
01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:35.470
he spent four fucking years,
Yada Yada.
Yah,
this is my thing.

1057
01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:41.170
It's like one of those deals where Mel Gibson,
he did say it.
So,

1058
01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:44.110
but my thing is if you're going to fucking trash the guy for it,

1059
01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:45.430
just go ahead and trash them.

1060
01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:49.300
Don't sit there and act like you're the guy's fucking buddy.

1061
01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:52.690
And then out of nowhere hit him over the head with it.

1062
01:06:52.691 --> 01:06:57.310
So he ends up calling the guy an asshole.
The guy is an asshole.
And,
uh,

1063
01:06:58.390 --> 01:07:01.660
the other point is that Dean Richards,
Guy,
I swear to God,

1064
01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:06.010
if you tapped his phone,
if you tap that guy's fucking phone,

1065
01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:11.080
you don't think that he would say anything that would involve some sort of,

1066
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.450
uh,
apology.

1067
01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:17.800
I'm just really tired of people acting like they don't have any sort of fucking

1068
01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:21.610
issues whatsoever.
I'm not saying that you're a straight up fucking racist.

1069
01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:24.910
All right?
But you,
you never caught yourself.
You know,

1070
01:07:24.911 --> 01:07:27.370
you're walking down the street,
it's late at night,

1071
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:30.310
you see some of them of a particular race.
And what do you think?

1072
01:07:30.311 --> 01:07:33.130
You thinking the worst shit,
you know,

1073
01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:36.910
and then it turns out for some reason you have to interact with them and then

1074
01:07:36.911 --> 01:07:40.120
their exact opposite of what the fuck you thought your were.
They were,
I mean,

1075
01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:43.810
I dunno,
I'm just sick of people.
When somebody does something like that,

1076
01:07:43.811 --> 01:07:47.950
everybody gets to be like holier than Thou and act like a,

1077
01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:53.470
they don't think any fucked up thoughts.
And second of Lee,
second,
second of Lee.

1078
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:58.450
Second of all,
I think I'm on third of all if this point and,
and,
and uh,

1079
01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:03.520
see my,
my third point,
I'm just gonna switch between numbers and letters here.

1080
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:07.480
Mel Gibson has a lot of fucking issues,
right?

1081
01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:12.190
So how do you cure the guy of these fucking hateful ish issues?

1082
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:18.590
You're fucking drag them across the god Damn Coles and rub his fucking face in

1083
01:08:18.591 --> 01:08:19.121
it.
I mean,
I,

1084
01:08:19.121 --> 01:08:23.510
I really don't think that that's going to make a guy with fucked up thoughts

1085
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:28.520
really sit back and reflect,
you know,
I mean,

1086
01:08:28.521 --> 01:08:31.760
it's up to that dude whether he wants to sit back and reflect,
but you know,

1087
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:36.110
I don't think like a,
trying to think of a good fucking analogy.

1088
01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:40.580
I got it.
Like when I lived in Boston,

1089
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:43.790
absolutely fucking hated the Yankees and I fucking hated their fans.

1090
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:47.120
And then when I moved down in New York and I had to interact with them,
you know,

1091
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:48.110
they weren't as bad,

1092
01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.440
but I still thought that they were Douche bags at the end of the day.
All right.

1093
01:08:51.441 --> 01:08:55.340
That was a bad example.
Whatever.
I fucking waiting the podcast.

1094
01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:57.170
You know what I'm saying?
At some point,

1095
01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.100
I think the public has to forgive Mel Gibson,

1096
01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.920
particularly anybody that he went off on.

1097
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:07.130
I think he should be a nice guy to him and then he can realize,
wow,

1098
01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:12.020
what the fuck was I thinking?
Here's so and so.
He's part of the group X,
Y,

1099
01:09:12.021 --> 01:09:15.520
and z that I went off on.
I really was a drunk Douche bag.

1100
01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:20.330
But I think if you're a fucking racist country and you think that shit,

1101
01:09:21.230 --> 01:09:24.230
I think mace mostly,
maybe you'll,
you'll probably remain that way.

1102
01:09:24.231 --> 01:09:29.231
But if you're actually truly trying to not be a racist country anymore,

1103
01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:34.250
if the group that you attacked is a fucking asshole to you,

1104
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:36.740
not a fucking asshole.
That's a bad,

1105
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:41.300
but like just constantly is yelling at you.
I don't,

1106
01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:46.130
I don't see where you think that that guy is going to turn the fucking corner.

1107
01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.740
You know?
Where the fuck are you calling us?

1108
01:09:51.741 --> 01:09:56.240
Douchebags you fucking cunt.
Oh yeah.
What was I thinking?
You know what I mean?

1109
01:09:56.270 --> 01:10:01.220
Does that make any sense whatsoever?
I don't fucking know.
Whatever.

1110
01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:05.990
Look at,
I can separate the racist guy from his movies.

1111
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:15.410
Uh,
I was kidding.
No,
it's hard to,
it's a,
it's,
it's a fucking difficult thing,

1112
01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.270
you know,
and the guy did say it,
so I guess he does deserve that.
But you know,

1113
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.420
I just thought that was a really fucking pussy ass way.

1114
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:25.640
I just thought if you watched the interview,

1115
01:10:25.641 --> 01:10:29.600
the guys being really passive aggressive,
he's taking swipes at the movie,

1116
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:33.800
you know,
saying it's like,
oh this is,
he's basically saying,
Mel,

1117
01:10:33.801 --> 01:10:38.270
this is you doing shit I saw you do 20 years ago.
What's up with that?
But he,

1118
01:10:38.271 --> 01:10:41.390
but he was saying it in this,
you know,
you know,

1119
01:10:41.391 --> 01:10:45.560
I just felt like I was a visiting an old friend,
you know.

1120
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.400
What about doing the stunts?
Is it harder to do the stunts now that you're older,

1121
01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:54.350
you know,
that type of ship?
Yeah.

1122
01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:57.860
Dean yet is harder.
Is it harder for you to see your Dick when you sit down?

1123
01:10:57.861 --> 01:11:01.760
When you take a shit,
you old fat,
fuck yeah,
we're getting older.

1124
01:11:01.761 --> 01:11:05.840
What is your point?
I'm trying to sell a movie here.
You take me out at the niece.

1125
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:08.390
Why?
If you were just going to take me out at the knees,

1126
01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:12.980
why didn't you just do a rant on your show rather than have me get up at fucking

1127
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:17.550
five and the Goddamn morning for you to pretend like you actually respect me on

1128
01:11:17.551 --> 01:11:21.770
some level.
I Dunno.
I guess that's my problem with the video.
Like I uh,

1129
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:23.850
those of you listen to my podcasts,

1130
01:11:23.851 --> 01:11:28.200
you know how much I hate passive aggressiveness.

1131
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:32.880
Um,
it's just a,
I dunno,
it's really a,
uh,

1132
01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:37.440
it's one of the bitchiness qualities you can have as a fucking human being.

1133
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:39.480
You know,
if you're going to be a cunt stand,

1134
01:11:39.481 --> 01:11:44.481
they're flat footed with your shoulders squared up and just hit him a hundred

1135
01:11:44.491 --> 01:11:45.960
files going to say full force,

1136
01:11:45.961 --> 01:11:50.961
just like fucking Jeff Farmer who will be getting to later full force with being

1137
01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:56.130
a cunt towards him.
You know,
it's like you have a piss somebody off,

1138
01:11:56.131 --> 01:11:59.520
you cut them off and traffic and they're behind you and you're looking in their

1139
01:11:59.521 --> 01:12:03.870
face and you know,
they're mad at you.
Right?
And you drive for like two,

1140
01:12:03.871 --> 01:12:07.080
two and a half miles,
and then you make a right and it's still going straight.

1141
01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:11.460
And as you make a right,
they drive by and then they beep at you.
You know,

1142
01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:16.500
as they go by
back that type of shit.

1143
01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:20.250
Lean on the fucking whore and the second I do something right,

1144
01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.580
don't wait till I make a right turn and you could fucking beep at me and then

1145
01:12:23.581 --> 01:12:25.830
drive away.
Jesus Christ.
That was,
that was,
you know what?

1146
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:30.180
That was a nice goddamn example.
That was really a nice example.

1147
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.210
Um,
anyways,

1148
01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:39.440
I went out and I bought some new clothes this weekend.
Everybody,
it's,

1149
01:12:39.441 --> 01:12:42.930
it's kind of one of those weird things when you become an adult where,
uh,

1150
01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:45.770
as a kid,
I don't know about you guys.
I know these kids nowadays,

1151
01:12:45.771 --> 01:12:49.230
they're all fucking spoiled with their I pads,
you know,

1152
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:52.400
and they have box of condoms or whatever the fuck they get at school every God

1153
01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:54.330
Damn Day.
Um,

1154
01:12:56.210 --> 01:13:00.120
I was just picturing people like 18 listen to this,
throwing their hands up.
Like,

1155
01:13:00.121 --> 01:13:03.580
what do we don't get that?
Um,

1156
01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:08.100
yeah,
there's that weird thing when I was a kid,
you got,

1157
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:11.880
you got new clothes once a year.
You know,

1158
01:13:11.881 --> 01:13:16.110
Christmas didn't count because those were from your grandmother and that was

1159
01:13:16.111 --> 01:13:21.000
please beat the shit out of me.
Clothes.
Um,
I guess you got a couple of things,

1160
01:13:21.001 --> 01:13:25.890
but like basically you got new clothes at the beginning of every year.

1161
01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:28.440
That's how it worked in my family.
Beginning of every year.

1162
01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:32.490
You went down to the fucking Levi store,

1163
01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:37.470
you got like three different pairs of fucking quarter Royce and you got a new

1164
01:13:37.471 --> 01:13:41.190
pair of sneakers and you got like three shirts and that was it.

1165
01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:45.960
See you next September.
They're fuck,
oh,
that was it.
That was it.

1166
01:13:45.961 --> 01:13:49.560
And the rest was hand me downs from your older brothers and sisters,
not sisters,

1167
01:13:49.561 --> 01:13:54.270
older brothers or whatever,
or oldest sister's if you're abroad,
you know,

1168
01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:59.700
trying to fucking make this,
this podcast for everybody.
Uh,

1169
01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:03.810
what did I just sound like fucking Dana carvers carved George Bush.

1170
01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:08.520
That sounded like that to me.
Trying to do the podcast for everybody,

1171
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:10.980
not Gani Dad.
Um,

1172
01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:15.670
wouldn't be prudent.
That's a terrible impression.
Bill.

1173
01:14:15.671 --> 01:14:18.400
Once you shut the fuck up and talk about your stupid clothes,
fine.

1174
01:14:18.401 --> 01:14:22.480
I will my podcast,
we'll fucking talk about whatever I want to talk about.

1175
01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:26.980
We think about that.
Um,
yes,
he got and that was it for the whole fucking year.

1176
01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.730
And you sneakers look good til about September 30th.
And then,

1177
01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.320
and then that was it.
And that was fucking it.
But uh,

1178
01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:39.850
but the weird thing as an adult is,
uh,
you know,

1179
01:14:39.851 --> 01:14:42.040
you think I'm going to say that you buy clothes more often.

1180
01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.920
The reality is is you don't,
you don't,

1181
01:14:44.921 --> 01:14:49.780
you let a couple of school years go by and uh,
then one day,

1182
01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.680
you know,
you have to go to an event that you haven't gone to in a while.

1183
01:14:53.681 --> 01:14:54.790
Like say like a barbecue.

1184
01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:57.730
I can't remember the last time I went to a fucking barbecue and you start

1185
01:14:57.731 --> 01:15:02.731
fishing out your barbecue clothes from the bottom of your God damn dresser

1186
01:15:03.071 --> 01:15:06.400
drawer.
You know,
bring a bathing suit.

1187
01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:10.570
I pull out this fucking bay.
Then students got a Mustang,
Mustang.

1188
01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.680
I can't even talk this week.

1189
01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:16.700
He has a mustard stain from like fucking back when Clinton was in office and I

1190
01:15:18.091 --> 01:15:20.740
don't know what it was now,
like I'm up on bathing suits styles,

1191
01:15:20.741 --> 01:15:24.940
but I could just tell it was not in style anymore and everything was just

1192
01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:28.970
fucking linty and old looking and all that shit.
So I was like God damn.

1193
01:15:28.971 --> 01:15:33.670
And I got to go to the fucking mall.
So I go to the mall,

1194
01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:38.790
I had to buy some new sneakers and I go into the foot locker and this selling

1195
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.600
Lakers tee shirts that says 16 this is Los Angeles Lakers,

1196
01:15:43.601 --> 01:15:48.601
16 fucking NBA championships on it in the footlocker guy comes up,

1197
01:15:49.571 --> 01:15:52.150
dress like a ref,
you know.

1198
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:55.480
And he comes up to me and he's just like a,
hey sir,

1199
01:15:55.481 --> 01:15:57.970
is there anything I can help you with?
I said,
yeah,

1200
01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:02.260
you can fix that tee shirt right there and have it say Los Angeles Lakers,

1201
01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.640
11 NBA championships.
And he's like,
what are you talking about?

1202
01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:11.200
I'm like,
cause you won.
Your first five is the Minneapolis Lakers.

1203
01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.250
All right,
sick Los Angeles Lakers,

1204
01:16:15.251 --> 01:16:18.790
it should say Minneapolis slash Los Angeles Lakers.

1205
01:16:18.791 --> 01:16:20.890
She got that Los Angelenos.

1206
01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.860
Those first five championships are not yours.

1207
01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:28.150
So why don't you fucking cave in your chest a little bit down to about 11

1208
01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:33.151
championships and I'll keep mine way the fuck out there with my 17 NBA

1209
01:16:33.401 --> 01:16:38.080
championships from the Boston Celtics,
all of them in Boston.

1210
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:41.050
Are you guys still confused about that?
La?

1211
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:44.980
Think about how many times have you burned down your city.

1212
01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:50.200
You haven't burned down 16 times.
You burned it down 11 times.

1213
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:56.190
You fucking asshole.
Classic people from Los Angeles just pattern.

1214
01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:00.160
They're fucking resume.
You're a fucking PA on a project.

1215
01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:02.110
All of a sudden you're an executive producer.

1216
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:06.640
You win 11 championships as the Los Angeles Lakers and all of a sudden now you

1217
01:17:06.641 --> 01:17:08.710
walking around with 16 NBA,

1218
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:14.540
you got a lot of fucking nerve.
Just like tiger woods wife.

1219
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:18.800
You got a lot of fucking nerve Stan the fuck down.

1220
01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:24.920
I don't know.
I can't remember if I talked about this last week,
uh,

1221
01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.030
on the podcast.

1222
01:17:26.031 --> 01:17:30.650
But after watching some world cup soccer and watching these fucking pansies,

1223
01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.800
every time anybody comes near,

1224
01:17:32.801 --> 01:17:37.010
I'm flopping around like they just got fucking tasered.

1225
01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.400
I was like,
you know what?
I Bet Pau Gasol,

1226
01:17:40.401 --> 01:17:43.790
that's where he learned his flopping around on the fucking cored out there.

1227
01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:46.400
Either that or you still watch a fishing show.

1228
01:17:46.401 --> 01:17:50.090
I can't figure out what he just outgrew the sport.

1229
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:55.160
The big fucking goof.
His fucking face.

1230
01:17:56.990 --> 01:18:01.430
How do you fucking start squinting bef before you even start driving to the

1231
01:18:01.431 --> 01:18:02.630
Goddamn who rim.

1232
01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:10.940
If Pau Gasol ever puts out a ringtone,
that's what it's going to sound like.

1233
01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.920
He found me.
Oh,

1234
01:18:18.921 --> 01:18:21.290
I just can't get over it.
I just can't get over that.

1235
01:18:21.291 --> 01:18:23.630
We fucking lost to those assholes

1236
01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:27.860
and Colby choked and pile choke.

1237
01:18:27.861 --> 01:18:32.180
They both choked in game seven and no one's ever going to fucking remember.

1238
01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.040
If it wasn't for this podcast,

1239
01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:39.440
I'm going to be bringing it up for years.
Um,
all right.

1240
01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:45.290
Anyway,
so it's July everybody.
We're over the hump another year.

1241
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:48.680
Another year is flying by.
All right,

1242
01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:53.540
and I want you guys to realize that it is July 5th.
All right.

1243
01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:55.070
In the end of August is coming.

1244
01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:59.950
So you make sure that you do something fun every God damn weekend.
All right,

1245
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.180
so I don't know about you guys as you get older.

1246
01:19:02.181 --> 01:19:06.020
I don't know what the fuck happens.
It's May and you're like,
oh my God,

1247
01:19:06.021 --> 01:19:10.930
summer's coming.
And then the next thing you know,
it's,
it's,
it's,

1248
01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.380
it's over.
And you're like,
I didn't do shit.
I didn't do one fucking fun thing.

1249
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:18.060
All I did was work and run.

1250
01:19:18.061 --> 01:19:23.061
As you get mad and you're going to hear actually examined how the fuck you let

1251
01:19:23.961 --> 01:19:25.280
another summer slip away.

1252
01:19:25.281 --> 01:19:30.281
All of a sudden it's preseason football and you get so fucking excited that you

1253
01:19:30.411 --> 01:19:34.340
forget that you wasted another summer.
Yes.
You guys a question.

1254
01:19:34.341 --> 01:19:37.580
When's the last time you went inner tubing down a God damn river?

1255
01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:42.200
Isn't that what you supposed to do in some sorta wrangler Jean Cutoffs.
Oh,

1256
01:19:42.201 --> 01:19:46.100
by the way,
by the fucking way,
speaking of wrangler,

1257
01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:49.530
if you want to know why that,
that,
that um,

1258
01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.490
reference was in my fucking head when I went,

1259
01:19:52.491 --> 01:19:54.320
I'm really bringing the voice down for this story.

1260
01:19:54.321 --> 01:19:58.070
Everybody when I went to go shopping yesterday,

1261
01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:01.400
which is one of the great activities you can do with your girlfriend when you

1262
01:20:01.401 --> 01:20:02.240
need new clothes.

1263
01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:05.930
I mean if you ever just want to watch your girl's face just light up,

1264
01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:09.990
just say that to her.
Hey Sweetheart,
you want to go shopping?
Oh my God.

1265
01:20:09.991 --> 01:20:11.540
He finally gets me.

1266
01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:15.490
<v 8>Guess who I am?
I would love to go.</v>

1267
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:18.880
<v 7>So we go over to the fucking mall and I'm like,
all right,</v>

1268
01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:23.630
I need to buy some clothes,
some barbecue clothes,

1269
01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:27.120
some clothes that I can wear hanging out a barbecue.

1270
01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:32.300
So I won't get trashed at this fucking barbecue cause it's going to be a bunch

1271
01:20:32.321 --> 01:20:33.160
of comedians there.

1272
01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:36.880
I'd already get a bunch of shit if there was a bunch of pipe fitters down there

1273
01:20:36.881 --> 01:20:40.240
or whatever,
they would already be breaking ball.
So I got to go down there.

1274
01:20:40.241 --> 01:20:41.320
I got to be looking.
All right,

1275
01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:48.500
so we go to the mall and she takes me into target or is the women call it

1276
01:20:49.741 --> 01:20:53.670
Tarjay.
That's the little fucking,
oh my God,

1277
01:20:53.671 --> 01:20:55.830
we're being frisky.
Joke.

1278
01:20:56.950 --> 01:21:01.950
And this is the amazing thing about women is women can go into a target and find

1279
01:21:02.251 --> 01:21:06.950
something and,
and uh,
make it work as they say.
God,

1280
01:21:06.951 --> 01:21:09.170
I can't believe I know that fucking expression.
Okay.

1281
01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.300
I'm really going to have to bring up my excuse here.

1282
01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:15.740
My girl watches that fashion show and I actually am aware of that guy with the

1283
01:21:15.741 --> 01:21:20.330
glasses who goes make it work.
Um,
and this is basically how it works.

1284
01:21:20.331 --> 01:21:25.230
My girl watches those reality shows and uh,
I might even bring her in here.

1285
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:29.260
Hey Nia.
Okay.
You want to come in on the podcast?

1286
01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:35.580
All right.
All right.
Knee is coming in on the podcast.
Everybody.
Okay.

1287
01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:40.610
I'm going to explain basically how it works.

1288
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:44.480
When I,
uh,
the lovely Nia,
everybody,

1289
01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.860
I was actually,
I was talking about how when I needed some new barbecue clothes,

1290
01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:52.260
right?

1291
01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:58.190
That you took me to target and I was beginning to say that target,

1292
01:21:58.191 --> 01:22:02.850
like there's something about women that you can go into a target and actually

1293
01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:05.410
whatever you find you can make it work.

1294
01:22:05.650 --> 01:22:07.840
And then I realized that that was the same.

1295
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:13.310
<v 8>Yes.
So now I'm feeling like at work?
Yeah,</v>

1296
01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:16.880
like people can be like,
you actually watched those shows.
How long do I last?

1297
01:22:16.881 --> 01:22:18.680
When I watch those reality shows with you?

1298
01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:22.730
About five minutes before I kick you out.
Kick you kick me out.
Why?

1299
01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:26.940
Because you act like a deck.
What do you mean?
I don't have like a dick.

1300
01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:28.010
I start GSA.

1301
01:22:28.530 --> 01:22:32.510
I start trashing the people on the show.
Yeah,

1302
01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:36.300
well you make little jokes and stuff and it's funny and then you get annoying

1303
01:22:36.301 --> 01:22:39.630
and you hinder my ability to enjoy.
It's like kick you out.

1304
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:45.060
All right.
I want to defend my thing.
So she brings me into target.

1305
01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.310
I thought to go.
What's that?

1306
01:22:47.370 --> 01:22:49.950
I thought we were going in there for you to find workout clothes.

1307
01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:51.660
Workout clothes,
which,

1308
01:22:51.690 --> 01:22:56.130
so she brings me in into the corner of the store and she shows me these fucking,

1309
01:22:56.370 --> 01:23:00.240
I didn't even know champions still made workout clothes and they've since

1310
01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:03.870
changed their logo and she's like,
Huh,
look at these.

1311
01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.100
You like these workout clothes.

1312
01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:09.160
And it literally looked like the kind of shit you'd wear.
Like,
you know,

1313
01:23:09.161 --> 01:23:09.551
when you get,

1314
01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:13.780
you get arrested for something and then seven years later when they let you out

1315
01:23:13.781 --> 01:23:16.930
of jail,
they give you your clothes back.
That's what the fuck it looked like.

1316
01:23:16.931 --> 01:23:19.480
Basketballs or worth.
Yeah.
And I said,
yeah.

1317
01:23:19.481 --> 01:23:22.930
And they're also like the Jordan level where it's all the way down to your

1318
01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:25.270
calves still.
They don't realize that it's actually,

1319
01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:29.530
they found a happy medium between the Larry Bird's and the Michael Jordan.

1320
01:23:29.531 --> 01:23:33.940
Jordan.
Yeah.
Which is a little bit above the knee.
And uh,
so what did I do?

1321
01:23:33.941 --> 01:23:37.450
I went in there and I said,
I was in there for like three seconds.
I'm like,
yeah,

1322
01:23:37.451 --> 01:23:39.140
I'm not finding shit.

1323
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.590
And you got fucking mad at me because the bill,

1324
01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:46.510
whenever we go shopping together and I have suggestions or whatever,

1325
01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:47.730
you just walk in,

1326
01:23:47.770 --> 01:23:51.880
look for not even three seconds are being very generous to yourself.

1327
01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:55.240
You walk in and you're like,
I'm not fucking doing this.
You don't even look.

1328
01:23:55.241 --> 01:23:58.720
You don't even take the time.
I was right,
but I was right.

1329
01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:03.250
They had tank tops next to like Dickies.
Sad like,
yeah,

1330
01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.910
like what are you going to snake out of fucking toilet and then go play some

1331
01:24:06.911 --> 01:24:11.620
hope.
It's not.
It's not for men.
Target is not for men.

1332
01:24:12.190 --> 01:24:15.880
I don't think it is unless the machine,
they're getting staff buy in.

1333
01:24:15.881 --> 01:24:18.940
Can openers and beard glasses.
That's what the fuck they're getting.

1334
01:24:18.941 --> 01:24:22.180
Then I bought,
what are they going to buy?
Slacks.
They had lots of slacks.

1335
01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:26.140
They had lots of tee shirts and stuff that you could have gotten,
you know?

1336
01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:27.471
Oh yeah,
they,
I could,

1337
01:24:27.471 --> 01:24:32.350
could've got some sneakers in there too with the Velcro fucking snap things over

1338
01:24:32.351 --> 01:24:35.260
the front as if to say I,
I,
you know,

1339
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:38.080
they lost part of my foot in a boating accident.

1340
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:41.920
They don't need to be that expensive.
If it's workout clothes,

1341
01:24:41.921 --> 01:24:44.490
of course you want to look nice,
but you don't have to spend a ton of money.

1342
01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:48.580
I don't know.
I don't believe in that unless you're a fucking tennis player.

1343
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:51.280
If I were a tennis player,
I would want cute tennis outfit,

1344
01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:55.570
but if it's just me in here doing my stupid Jillian Michaels workout,

1345
01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.060
I don't know.
Once this might look,
well,

1346
01:24:58.061 --> 01:25:02.560
how did fuck did me going into getting some shit for going to a barbecue slash

1347
01:25:02.561 --> 01:25:06.700
some new workout clothes go to me wanting to buy a cute tennis outfit.

1348
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:11.360
I didn't realize that this was supposed to be an outfit that transitioned to
you.

1349
01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:14.100
It was not an fit.
It's not an outfit.

1350
01:25:14.110 --> 01:25:19.110
Barbecue brought you in here to try to save face because I said make it work and

1351
01:25:19.991 --> 01:25:23.890
now you're just,
I'm just further into the muck bite.
All right.
That's it.
People.

1352
01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:27.610
I had to go to a barbecue and I went to the mall and I bought a cute outfit.

1353
01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:31.000
You did like you Nafa.
You looked really nice yesterday.
Yes,
I did.

1354
01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:31.870
I look respectable.

1355
01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:36.280
Although I did the classic old guy thing where I had the brand new sneakers in

1356
01:25:36.281 --> 01:25:37.330
the older socks.

1357
01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:42.670
You know what's funny is that when you were putting them on for half a second,

1358
01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:46.870
I wanted to suggest that you wear socks that were a little bit lower so that you

1359
01:25:46.871 --> 01:25:50.380
wouldn't see so much of the sock.
They were ankle level.
I know,

1360
01:25:50.381 --> 01:25:53.540
but you could've gone.
I'm like a little bit lower so I dunno.

1361
01:25:53.570 --> 01:25:55.370
I want to have that little ball on the back of him.

1362
01:25:56.110 --> 01:25:57.770
When did those become guys socks?

1363
01:25:59.090 --> 01:26:02.700
Chris Everett Lloyd's back.
But they're just the low socks.

1364
01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:05.420
You see more of the sneaker and not so much of this like I gotta be honest with

1365
01:26:05.421 --> 01:26:08.390
you and ask,
I dunno.
I have people write in about this.

1366
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:12.650
I feel like when you wear shorts,
sneakers and socks,

1367
01:26:12.651 --> 01:26:17.360
if there's too much sock showing,
eh it's,
it gets a little,
I don't know.
Dorky.

1368
01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.440
Gotcha.
It's just class.
So you,
so you basically,

1369
01:26:22.670 --> 01:26:25.880
I'm the guy you love and you let me walk around this barbecue yesterday looking

1370
01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:29.750
like a Douche.
It's your own way to keep the women's away from me.

1371
01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:32.240
Is that what you were doing?
Didn't look like a Douche.
She looked really good.

1372
01:26:32.241 --> 01:26:37.130
And be anytime a while.
I don't know if we should get into this,
but why?

1373
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:39.650
Why not?
What are we going to have an argument on here?

1374
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:41.600
Do you think these people know me?
Shit about us.

1375
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:46.160
We're trying to fill up and do an hour of their day at work.
Right now.

1376
01:26:46.161 --> 01:26:47.120
You're not mad.
They are that.

1377
01:26:47.121 --> 01:26:50.570
They have to work July 5th and the company crossed the street has a cool boss.

1378
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:55.550
We're actually closed.
What is the problem?
No,
I just,
you know,

1379
01:26:55.551 --> 01:26:59.040
if I were to make a suggestion like that,
you really knew what to fork.

1380
01:26:59.050 --> 01:27:03.180
Almost [inaudible] book.
I was like,
what?
I sound like.

1381
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:08.240
Well,
I remember making a suggestion yesterday and that didn't work out too good

1382
01:27:08.241 --> 01:27:11.510
either.
That's why I didn't want to bring it out.
Oh,

1383
01:27:11.511 --> 01:27:12.440
you don't want to talk about that?

1384
01:27:13.130 --> 01:27:16.610
You don't want to talk about the fact that I said your dress was a little linty.

1385
01:27:16.890 --> 01:27:20.120
Dell.
Your dress was a little linty.
Yes,

1386
01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:24.580
and we can then it then came home and I changed and this is,

1387
01:27:24.970 --> 01:27:27.770
this is the hardest like help guys out here you have it.

1388
01:27:27.771 --> 01:27:31.080
Do you know what the hardest fucking thing is when is when standing up now

1389
01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:31.731
standing up now,

1390
01:27:31.731 --> 01:27:36.320
cause I want to make a point here is it had nothing to do with you.

1391
01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:39.890
I was just,
I was,
you know,
I was like,

1392
01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:43.480
you know the drug you just dress had been worn just a little bit too low.

1393
01:27:43.481 --> 01:27:45.860
It's just one of those ones you throw over.
Look at me.

1394
01:27:45.861 --> 01:27:47.870
I'm already getting nervous trying to explain to you.

1395
01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:50.550
I said I'll buy you another one.
And then the next thing you know,

1396
01:27:50.551 --> 01:27:52.580
there was just like a fucking,
there was,

1397
01:27:52.581 --> 01:27:55.650
there was the meltdown at the mall and I use the meltdown,

1398
01:27:56.450 --> 01:28:00.470
started crying in the mall on the birthday of our country.

1399
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:05.240
I don't give a shit about the birthday of this country.
Wow.
I don't,

1400
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:08.920
sorry everyone.
Wow.
I'm African American.

1401
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:12.620
There's still a little annoyance there,
so I'm not exactly,
yeah,

1402
01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:16.940
America's freedom.
Fuck you man.
To take it all the way to there.

1403
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:24.320
Anyway,
wait a minute.
This isn't about that.
Oh my God.

1404
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:26.780
Do you realize the emails were going to,
they're going to get,
well,

1405
01:28:26.781 --> 01:28:30.500
why don't you go the fuck back to fucking Air Africa?
They should say it.

1406
01:28:30.650 --> 01:28:33.110
Go ahead.
Let them get it all out there.

1407
01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:38.370
I know Mel Gibson's get it all out there.
Let's not mince words here.
Ah,

1408
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:39.370
Jesus Christ and here,

1409
01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:42.610
you know I try to keep it light and you just went Fox News on me.

1410
01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:46.790
He just went Fox News on me or whatever.
No,
actually no.

1411
01:28:46.791 --> 01:28:49.940
The ultra liberal back to haunt me.
Yeah.

1412
01:28:49.941 --> 01:28:54.941
If I become a successful actress that this is going to be played on some sort of

1413
01:28:54.951 --> 01:28:59.900
website.
Nia.
Renee hates this country.
That's not what I'm saying.
But anyway,

1414
01:28:59.930 --> 01:29:04.740
what are you saying?
I'm saying that you know for,
wait a second.

1415
01:29:04.741 --> 01:29:06.300
When people celebrate 4th of July,

1416
01:29:06.301 --> 01:29:09.110
are they really like eating their barbecue in drinking their beer?

1417
01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:12.570
Thinking about this country and our forefathers and what it really,
no,

1418
01:29:12.571 --> 01:29:14.040
they're not.
They're just like,
Yay,

1419
01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:18.120
I don't have work tomorrow and I get to get drunk.
Yeah.

1420
01:29:18.121 --> 01:29:22.350
Most of them on the text messages telling people how before the July,

1421
01:29:22.351 --> 01:29:26.640
like it's Christmas.
No one cares.
I don't think

1422
01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.720
your popularity,
Nia was through

1423
01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:36.390
podcast and now you know,
it was funny.
It was,

1424
01:29:36.391 --> 01:29:41.180
I will listeners on a journey up and down a rollercoaster.

1425
01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.920
That's what,
that's exactly what Mel Gibson just said.

1426
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:48.690
I just watched that thing and he just said that.
She just said that shit.
No,

1427
01:29:49.570 --> 01:29:54.570
there's fucking no passive aggressive Douche bag was sitting there going,

1428
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:59.370
uh,
w w was came on acting like he wanted to talk about his movie,

1429
01:29:59.371 --> 01:30:02.610
but he really just wanted to sort of steer it back around to that time you went,

1430
01:30:02.611 --> 01:30:07.140
you went off.
So and then he was,
he was going like a,
he goes,
well,
you need,

1431
01:30:07.141 --> 01:30:08.490
you don't want,
when I saw your movie,

1432
01:30:08.491 --> 01:30:12.240
I just felt like I was visiting an old friend that we were on some,

1433
01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:15.690
some familiar ground.
He was basically saying like,
yeah,

1434
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:19.500
I've seen this fucking movie before.
But,
but he was doing it in the sing song.

1435
01:30:19.501 --> 01:30:22.950
He fucking voice.
Very jerky.
Yeah.
So he starts with that.

1436
01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.080
Then he asked and he asked him about doing stunts.

1437
01:30:25.081 --> 01:30:27.240
Is it harder to do now that you're an old fuck?

1438
01:30:27.241 --> 01:30:30.990
Was basically the subtext and then in the end he goes,

1439
01:30:30.991 --> 01:30:32.730
how do you think America is going to receive you?

1440
01:30:32.731 --> 01:30:35.460
So then Mel had to play it off like he didn't know what he was talking about and

1441
01:30:35.461 --> 01:30:37.140
then he basically brings it around and then the end,

1442
01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:40.410
Mel calls him an asshole and at one point when Mel was sin,
he goes,
well,

1443
01:30:40.411 --> 01:30:44.160
you know my life has been sort of a edit on a roller coaster.
He did say that.

1444
01:30:44.610 --> 01:30:49.570
Sonia,
do you want to try to,
I didn't mean to.
So you do Gibson.

1445
01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:51.840
All right,
well look,
I'm not going to lie to you.

1446
01:30:51.841 --> 01:30:55.020
You guys did have a rough couple of hundred years there at the beginning of this

1447
01:30:55.021 --> 01:30:56.760
country.
Started off a little slow for you guys.

1448
01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:00.260
What do you mean 400 it wasn't a couple hundred.
It was those,

1449
01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:02.040
it was a couple hundred it was not.

1450
01:31:02.041 --> 01:31:07.041
It was go on line right now near this fucking country is only 230 fucking four

1451
01:31:08.521 --> 01:31:10.830
years old.
It is.
Yeah.

1452
01:31:10.831 --> 01:31:15.480
1776 that's when he officially became America.
That was 400 years.

1453
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:17.790
400 Nia.
It's the two thousands right?

1454
01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:22.200
So that would be in the 16 hundreds you guys came over with those fucking

1455
01:31:22.201 --> 01:31:26.200
pilgrims and their butter.
What did they make?
Oh,
their oil.
What?

1456
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.560
What do we use the pilgrim?
That it was one of this
old colony gas.

1457
01:31:31.561 --> 01:31:35.640
Nobody remembers those guys showing my age.
I don't know.

1458
01:31:35.670 --> 01:31:39.270
They came over with smallpox,
infected blankets and gave them to the Indians.

1459
01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:43.950
That's all I know.
Who did the pilgrims on the Nina.
The PINTA.
The Santa Maria?
No,

1460
01:31:43.951 --> 01:31:46.620
no,
no,
no,
no.
We didn't do the smallpox thing.
Like,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.

1461
01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:47.700
You're getting ahead of yourself.

1462
01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:51.810
We came over and we starve to death and then we acted like we were friends with

1463
01:31:51.811 --> 01:31:53.650
the Indians going,
hey man,
like how do,

1464
01:31:54.090 --> 01:31:57.750
how do you make quite sit down and have dinner with us?
Call it thanksgiving.

1465
01:31:57.751 --> 01:32:02.320
Yeah.
When I will kill you.
Why don't you teach us how,
right.

1466
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:05.710
How to make it survive out here.
Yes.
And then once they did that,

1467
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:06.881
we would just like,

1468
01:32:06.881 --> 01:32:11.881
wouldn't it be awesome if we all lived here and they didn't Hae Gebbie die?

1469
01:32:13.061 --> 01:32:17.740
Why don't you sneeze into these fucking blankets and we'll give it to him.
Yeah.

1470
01:32:17.741 --> 01:32:17.931
We,

1471
01:32:17.931 --> 01:32:22.931
we went germ warfare way back in the day and then we gave him like $48 for the

1472
01:32:25.001 --> 01:32:26.170
entire Midwest.

1473
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:33.270
The Louisiana purchase.
No,
we did we buy that off of France?
Yeah.

1474
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:34.840
Bought that off of France,
but whatever.

1475
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:38.590
So that the French were over here murdering the Indians,
weren't they?

1476
01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.550
I don't fucking know.
All I know is they got,
yeah.

1477
01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:46.780
So gas is proving that we both can.
We don't know.
Shit.
Don't know shit.

1478
01:32:46.810 --> 01:32:49.300
There's a bunch of people judging us right now.

1479
01:32:52.050 --> 01:32:53.680
Well,
it's one of those things like,
you know,

1480
01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:57.100
like that type of Shit you learned and it just really doesn't come up in your

1481
01:32:57.101 --> 01:33:00.520
everyday life.
You know,
as I figure out how to get these bankers off,

1482
01:33:00.521 --> 01:33:04.780
my God damn back.
The Louisiana purchase really doesn't come up,
I guess.

1483
01:33:04.810 --> 01:33:07.030
Can you name,
can you listen?
Let's see how dumb we are.

1484
01:33:07.031 --> 01:33:11.890
Can name as many American wars as you possibly can.
Okay.

1485
01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:16.580
World War One and two,
Bang.
Don't want with the easy ones right off the bat.

1486
01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:20.020
The civil war,
uh,

1487
01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:24.810
Iraqi war operation.
Freedom as much called

1488
01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:30.730
the Cold War.
Was that an actual,
oh wow.

1489
01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:36.580
Wow.
My girlfriend's an idiot.
Wait a minute.
I'm not an idiot,
but no,

1490
01:33:36.581 --> 01:33:40.300
I'm not very good at history.
All right.
I admit it.
I'm not,

1491
01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:43.570
I don't know anything about here.
So then what are you trashing the country for?

1492
01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:48.640
I Dunno.
Can you just tap out and just say you're sorry.
Just say you're sorry.

1493
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:52.300
Just say it.
Just say,
because what are you doing?

1494
01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:56.140
Do you think it's any better anywhere else?
You,

1495
01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:58.230
when you really look around the world,
where are they?

1496
01:33:58.250 --> 01:34:02.470
Where is everybody really holding hands and all getting along,
isn't it?

1497
01:34:02.471 --> 01:34:07.370
Everywhere that is they have and the Hab.
Okay,
let's talk about Sweden.
Let's,

1498
01:34:07.371 --> 01:34:11.740
Ah,
let's talk about how you only,
they only universal health care.

1499
01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:14.560
They only let good looking people in Stockholm,
Sweden.

1500
01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.490
And the second we got out of there,
we took the train out of there.

1501
01:34:18.491 --> 01:34:20.530
All of a sudden,
that's where they kept all the Brunettes,

1502
01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:25.270
all those Muslim looking dudes in that shitty fucking gray communists.

1503
01:34:25.271 --> 01:34:28.210
Look in mall.
We went to,
you remember that shit?
Well,
I mean,

1504
01:34:28.211 --> 01:34:32.350
isn't it sort of like Manhattan now?
That's not a good example,

1505
01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:37.120
but maybe in more,
you know,
you know international Richard Cities,

1506
01:34:37.330 --> 01:34:38.380
you have people who yes.

1507
01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:42.250
Can Afford to get their hair done once a week and have gym memberships and nice

1508
01:34:42.251 --> 01:34:46.960
clothes and eat it.
Just like here.
Just like here.
I know,

1509
01:34:46.961 --> 01:34:49.870
but I was just same thing.
It's the same thing.
All right?
It's the same thing.

1510
01:34:49.871 --> 01:34:53.970
You don't think those Blondie's look down on the brunettes and then a Brunette

1511
01:34:53.970 --> 01:34:57.450
Sco,
brunettes and at least Sweden we out within where the fuck were they?

1512
01:34:57.670 --> 01:35:00.880
They were there.
Yeah,
we were both walking down the street and Stockholm going,

1513
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:04.400
Jesus Christ,
everyone's beautiful.
Look at that guy.
Yeah,

1514
01:35:04.401 --> 01:35:06.860
I felt like a fucking Mongrel.

1515
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:11.390
There was hot guys working at h and m like model guy,
like,
like uh,

1516
01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:15.080
like movie star looking chicks working at like a newspaper stand.

1517
01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:20.030
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then what?
Remember that we got outside this Nia,
I'm telling you,

1518
01:35:20.031 --> 01:35:23.240
everywhere you go,
you go over to England.
They got their Rothschild's,

1519
01:35:23.241 --> 01:35:26.630
they got their royal fucking family.
You know,

1520
01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:31.130
they won't even mingle with those fucking people who work on the tube or

1521
01:35:31.131 --> 01:35:34.670
whatever the fuck they do.
Right.
And then people in London,

1522
01:35:34.671 --> 01:35:38.600
they look down on people in Liverpool and people in Liverpool looked down on

1523
01:35:38.601 --> 01:35:43.430
people in another city,
but I only know two cities in England.
Right,
right.
Yeah.

1524
01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:46.250
So there you go.
It's all the same shit.
What do you think?
You're gonna go?

1525
01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:46.761
You're gonna,

1526
01:35:46.761 --> 01:35:49.490
you're gonna move to where you're going to go to Canada and they're going to be

1527
01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:54.470
nicer.
Apparently they are very nice in Canada.
It's a really,
really,
you think so?

1528
01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:56.840
I Dunno.
He just,
through Toronto out there

1529
01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:00.020
every time anyone bringing up Toronto,

1530
01:36:00.021 --> 01:36:03.590
they have nothing but nice things to say about it.
So,
but no,

1531
01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:07.640
I've never been there.
So you know,
this was supposed to be a nice,
cute segment.

1532
01:36:07.641 --> 01:36:10.460
I didn't think that it was really,
it really wasn't supposed to be about,
oh,

1533
01:36:10.461 --> 01:36:14.090
you and your clothes are going to target.
Next thing you know,
you see?
Yeah.

1534
01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:17.150
Next thing you know,
you're having a reality moment hissy fits.

1535
01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:21.520
I am thrown at celebrating the birthday of this country.
Okay.
I am,

1536
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:26.840
I am so mad at America right now.
I'm not mad at America.
This is a great country.

1537
01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:31.580
Of course it is.
But See,
took you 20 minutes to come back around.

1538
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:34.720
It is,
I do.
I live life like living here.
I don't have a problem.

1539
01:36:34.721 --> 01:36:37.940
I'm not just like this fucking country sucks me in.
I'm not like,

1540
01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:42.620
man,
let me tell you something near,
that's how we talk.

1541
01:36:42.621 --> 01:36:46.430
Whenever we talk about hippy,
really liberal people,
we always,

1542
01:36:46.730 --> 01:36:48.890
we always end our centers with me.
And Yeah,

This guy is a double rim.

01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:19.580
You guys,

Yeah.
This guy,

1550
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:23.660
if he's on drugs,
he's the coolest guy ever.
But if he's sober,

1551
01:37:23.661 --> 01:37:26.810
he's one of the biggest,
he's such a Douche.
She had to live in the wilderness.

1552
01:37:26.811 --> 01:37:30.740
He basically sees,
uh,
a full on double rainbow.

1553
01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:35.020
Rainbow.
Yeah.
What does it mean?
And he starts fucking car.

1554
01:37:35.021 --> 01:37:38.990
I don't want to read it.
I don't ruin it for you.
Um,
here's another one.
Um,

1555
01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:44.720
I have like,
this is an unbelievable week for youtube videos here.

1556
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:48.800
Uh,
Jones's good ass barbecue in foot massage.

1557
01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:50.300
Look that one up,

1558
01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:54.890
Jones is good ass barbecue and foot massage.
You've got to see,

1559
01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:58.310

Farmer.
Oh my God.
Yeah,

1561
01:38:02.991 --> 01:38:06.740
You got to look at that one and terrifying.

1562
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:10.400
And then possibly my favorite

1563
01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:12.560
<v 7>I've ever seen.
If you guys are wrestling fans,</v>

1564
01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:14.400
you guys know how I love Rick Flair.

1565
01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:18.900
And when he got on the mic and started talking about who he was gonna fight that

1566
01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:21.900
weekend,
there was nobody better.
You got to see this look up.

1567
01:38:21.901 --> 01:38:26.901
Best Wrestling Promo ever jump in Jeff Farmer disguise the worst I've ever seen.

1568
01:38:29.021 --> 01:38:32.050
And he's so,
and that,
that's like four videos.
Like,

1569
01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:36.450
like the mean gene guy is going,
jumping Jeff last week that you know,

1570
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:39.490
the one they actually do the gpt boy Jhumpa Jeff last week you got attacked by

1571
01:38:39.491 --> 01:38:43.060
so and so.
Uh,
you know,
how do you know?
And he really,

1572
01:38:43.061 --> 01:38:45.520
he really beat you down and then you're supposed to jump in.

1573
01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:49.270
Well let me tell you something,
come on this Saturday at the royal rumble,

1574
01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.070
but he doesn't,
he just goes,
you know,

1575
01:38:51.071 --> 01:38:55.590
and he really beat you down and the guy just goes,
Yup.
And then there's this

1576
01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:58.270
<v 8>long awkward pause.
Well,</v>

1577
01:38:59.250 --> 01:39:04.150
he turned the tables on me in a way that I didn't appreciate it.
I,

1578
01:39:04.170 --> 01:39:07.550
you just got to see it.
There's like four of them.
And uh,

1579
01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:12.530
then there's another person who actually,
uh,
what does this one,

1580
01:39:12.531 --> 01:39:14.750
fat nerd,
wow.

1581
01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:19.820
Gangster threatens x at all.
One that's all one.

1582
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:24.620
And then it says guilties whatever that is.
G,
U,
I,
l,
D,
I,
e.

1583
01:39:24.621 --> 01:39:27.560
S and off they spelt it wrong.
Or if that's a video game,
it's basically,

1584
01:39:27.561 --> 01:39:29.840
it's some really fat woman who,
uh,

1585
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:34.870
got kicked off playing video games and she's a really pissed off about it.

1586
01:39:35.231 --> 01:39:39.340
And she starts showing some of the moves she learned in Jujitsu block strike.

1587
01:39:39.370 --> 01:39:41.740
It's really bad.
Just,
just check all of those out.
But,
uh,

1588
01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:45.310
it's almost getting to the point where I have to wrap up the podcast.
So Nia,

1589
01:39:45.311 --> 01:39:47.050
you fucking Pinko commie.

1590
01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:52.360
Thanks for coming on the podcast in spewing your fucking hatred.

1591
01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:56.350
Hatred.
I'm not a Cami.

1592
01:39:57.130 --> 01:40:01.590
I love this country.
It's like a love,
not love,
hate.

1593
01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:04.330
I know you got the love hate thing,
which I'll,
I'll never,

1594
01:40:04.331 --> 01:40:07.860
I'll never be able to appreciate as a white guy because my life is,
it's,

1595
01:40:07.861 --> 01:40:12.310
it's awesome in this country.
Oh,
perfect.
Anything you want.
It's tremendous.

1596
01:40:12.311 --> 01:40:16.100
I get a USA today and a bag of cash every day from the government.
Yup.

1597
01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:19.840
You're a white male.
Age 18 to 45.
Oh,
it's perfect.
It's,

1598
01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:24.700
it's bankers don't fuck me over.
Nobody's,
you need it to be.
Yeah,
it's tremendous.

1599
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:28.550
No,
you love living in this country.
You love the fact that you can,
you know,

1600
01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:31.810
make something out of yourself.
You can really come from nothing.

1601
01:40:31.811 --> 01:40:34.740
And that's the thing,
you know,
you know,
immigrants come out with you.

1602
01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:36.360
It's really trying to save it right now

1603
01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:40.800
who don't speak a word of English.

1604
01:40:40.801 --> 01:40:44.650
And then they do rise up amongst the ranks and have a great,

1605
01:40:44.651 --> 01:40:48.960
like Cesar Milan,
the dog whisperer.
Yeah.
Look at him.
Look at him.
Yes.
He,

1606
01:40:48.961 --> 01:40:51.810
he did it.
He came into this country illegally.
Right.

1607
01:40:51.811 --> 01:40:54.550
Then he swam across the river,
like 12 dogs tied to his back.

1608
01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:59.080
Isn't that how we came in?
I think he did come illegally,

1609
01:40:59.081 --> 01:41:03.280
but he didn't become legal.
But so he's becoming,
yeah.
So there you go.
He has to,

1610
01:41:03.281 --> 01:41:07.360
I mean like how much money he's making.
Tyler Perry jump in.

1611
01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:12.250
Jeff Farmer Tyler.
Billy Carter are immigrants,
Huh?

1612
01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:18.070
Well,
yeah.
Oh,
immigrants.
All right.
Uh,
uh,

1613
01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:19.960
that fucking English speaking lady on.

1614
01:41:19.961 --> 01:41:24.190
So you think you can dance Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Arnold Schwartzenegger.
Yeah,

1615
01:41:24.191 --> 01:41:27.880
looking at him.
Kelly 40 yards in California.

1616
01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:32.020
He's pretty impressive.
Yeah.
Who love this country.

1617
01:41:32.021 --> 01:41:34.780
But there are some things that bothered me about it.
Like everyone else,

1618
01:41:34.781 --> 01:41:38.170
everyone else has various issues with this country too.

1619
01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:41.210
Maybe I'm not supposed to talk about it cause it's the 4th of July.

1620
01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:44.410
It's one of those things.
I know what you're saying.
Look you guys,
you know,

1621
01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:45.580
thank you.
You know,

1622
01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:48.250
you go down to the corner store next to no 12 cops are pulling you out of your

1623
01:41:48.251 --> 01:41:51.790
car.
You know,
beating the crap audio.
I get it.
Sure.
Yeah.

1624
01:41:51.791 --> 01:41:55.990
That doesn't happen to me.
I get annoyed this how spoiled I am as a white guy.

1625
01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:59.310
I get annoyed at airport security when they want,

1626
01:41:59.340 --> 01:42:03.580
when they want me to go through the little misty thing.
Are you a terrorist?

1627
01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:07.510
I get so fucking mad.
And I remember in that moment going like,
why?

1628
01:42:07.511 --> 01:42:11.110
I can't imagine how those Mexican dudes in Arizona are feeling right now getting

1629
01:42:11.111 --> 01:42:12.880
pulled over every five seconds yet.

1630
01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:16.420
I'm sure they're not excited about 4th of July this weekend.
Well,
what are you,

1631
01:42:16.450 --> 01:42:20.710
what are you supposed to do?
What are you supposed to do?
You don't want,

1632
01:42:20.711 --> 01:42:25.490
I don't understand social profile.
I Dunno.
You know what I think pat,

1633
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:30.030
once the sun goes down and your outside everybody racially profiles,

1634
01:42:30.450 --> 01:42:30.860
you know,

1635
01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:34.900
you have to think the worst of people so you can get to your car in the parking

1636
01:42:34.901 --> 01:42:39.160
lot.
Okay.
Yeah.
If I see a black dude or Latino dude,

1637
01:42:39.161 --> 01:42:42.940
they're were in a gang.
If I see a white guy,
he's a serial killer

1638
01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:48.910
or a pedophile,
you know?
Right.
Okay.
Yeah.

1639
01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:53.530
White guys are either see a woman,
she's a whore.
She's a streetwalker.

1640
01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:58.270
We're not interested.
Lady children.
[inaudible] children.

1641
01:42:58.271 --> 01:43:01.920
They're a children of the corn.
That's,
yeah.
They just,

1642
01:43:01.930 --> 01:43:05.560
they just came out of the milkweeds.
Yeah,
you have,

1643
01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:08.200
you have to racially profile,
uh,

1644
01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:13.260
and at night and I think the bigger pussy you are slashed,

1645
01:43:14.171 --> 01:43:15.160
the more vulnerable you are.

1646
01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:18.400
Like someone like me never took any martial arts training.
I just said,
you know,

1647
01:43:18.401 --> 01:43:21.820
I got like about 700 fights under my belt all within my,

1648
01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:25.150
which is with my brothers,
you know.
So those don't count.

1649
01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:28.360
They have to stop at a certain point because they have to answer to your dad.

1650
01:43:28.361 --> 01:43:30.370
But like I,
I go out in the parking lot,
you know,

1651
01:43:31.530 --> 01:43:36.490
fiber fought off out there in the world.
Uh,

1652
01:43:36.491 --> 01:43:38.530
not as much as you,
I'm going to go,
that's the point I was going to make.

1653
01:43:38.531 --> 01:43:40.900
Like a woman feels more vulnerable,
right?
Yeah.

1654
01:43:40.901 --> 01:43:42.910
Like I don't walk around worried about getting raped.

1655
01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:47.200
The only time I have to worry about that is if I go to prison,
you know?

1656
01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:49.930
Yeah.
Knock on wood.

1657
01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:55.220
So what at what time do you start racially profiling when the sun goes down?

1658
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:57.620
So during the winter,
during the winter,
it starts earlier,

1659
01:43:57.621 --> 01:44:00.960
like around five was going to say it's awfully early to start racially
profiling.

1660
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:05.210
Now you know what it is.
This is when,
when,
when,
when the second shift comes in,

1661
01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.270
if you know what I mean.
When the second shift comes in,

1662
01:44:08.271 --> 01:44:10.580
that's when I start racially profiling.
The beginning of the day,

1663
01:44:10.581 --> 01:44:12.880
people get up at eight in the morning when no matter what color you are,

1664
01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:14.990
you get up at eight in the morning,
you're a good person.
All right.

1665
01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:19.310
You worked at the end of the day.
Generally speaking,
you're a good person.

1666
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:22.160
You get up at eight in the morning,
you're a good,
yeah,
you're a good person.

1667
01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:25.280
And make sure that serial killer who just goes to work every day and like,
yeah,

1668
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:29.270
but I'm just saying generally speaking or got a fucking piece of shit on Wall

1669
01:44:29.271 --> 01:44:33.770
Street or a banker,
look at,
there's a lot of flaws in my theory.
All right.

1670
01:44:33.771 --> 01:44:34.730
But I'm talking about,

1671
01:44:34.731 --> 01:44:38.570
I'm talking about just like worrying about physical violence.
Okay?

1672
01:44:38.890 --> 01:44:39.940
You get up eight in the morning.

1673
01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:43.190
It's very hard to get your ass kicked between eight and five in the morning and

1674
01:44:43.191 --> 01:44:47.690
five in the afternoon.
This is what I'm saying.
But as a kid on the school yard,

1675
01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:51.890
there you go.
Exactly.
As an adult.
There you go.
So,
but after,

1676
01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:56.210
once the sun starts going down in the second shift comes out,
you know,

1677
01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:59.260
that's when,
uh,
like that,

1678
01:44:59.261 --> 01:45:02.450
that's when he know all of a sudden the fucking 28 days,

1679
01:45:02.451 --> 01:45:07.220
people come up from the manholes.
You know,
drug dealers come out,

1680
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:11.390
the feeds come out,
depending on where you're at.
That's when,
yes,

1681
01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:15.650
that's right.
That's right.
The fucking stockers,

1682
01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:19.820
the guys with the date rape drug who honestly puts the date rape drug in

1683
01:45:19.821 --> 01:45:21.950
somebody's morning coffee,
you know,
do it.

1684
01:45:22.970 --> 01:45:27.680
What was the last time somebody got raped when the sun was up and the sun was
up?

1685
01:45:28.330 --> 01:45:30.470
I'm sure people get raped when the sun is no,

1686
01:45:30.471 --> 01:45:33.660
if you get raped from the sun is up.
You're asking for,
oh my God,

1687
01:45:34.110 --> 01:45:36.320
you have to top your,
I don't like this country thing.

1688
01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:40.920
I'm trying to bring some of the hate on to me.
Okay,
good.
Um,
yeah,
so I'll,
I'll,

1689
01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:45.650
I'll admit that I,
I'll admit that to you.
I,
yeah,
I racially profile at night,

1690
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:50.000
but if there's a bigger group of people around and I feel safer than the racial

1691
01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:54.500
racial profile profiling goes down.
But seriously,
if I,
if I,

1692
01:45:54.710 --> 01:45:57.740
you know,
if you're a white guy with the shaved head during the day,

1693
01:45:57.741 --> 01:46:02.210
you have cancer at night,
you're part of,
you're part of a fucking Arion group.

1694
01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:07.530
Yeah.
I think I,

1695
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:12.100
I would be nervous if I was coming out of somewhere or,

1696
01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:15.560
and there was a whole gang of white guys that were like look,

1697
01:46:15.561 --> 01:46:18.500
like they were in a Frat and they being loud and rowdy.

1698
01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:22.040
That would make me really nervous if I was walking and they would chant and rape

1699
01:46:22.041 --> 01:46:24.060
is rape.
Rape is right there.

1700
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:29.070
The dude who do Jaeger bomber or some shit like that and they're all,

1701
01:46:29.421 --> 01:46:32.090
you know,
slapping each other on their back with their Letterman jackets.

1702
01:46:32.091 --> 01:46:37.010
That would make me very nervous to see cause because you saw the accused,
right?

1703
01:46:37.011 --> 01:46:39.770
I mean what are you basing this on?
I don't know.
I don't like those.

1704
01:46:39.771 --> 01:46:43.490
I don't like jockey kind of Frat guys anyway.
Great.
This is awesome.

1705
01:46:43.491 --> 01:46:47.950
It's such a great podcast.
Okay.
Cause no hot date.

1706
01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:52.080
Racy everybody.
Yeah.
See that's the thing.
Everybody does it,

1707
01:46:52.081 --> 01:46:54.930
which gets me back to this.
Everybody does that shit.
So,

1708
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:58.500
and then when somebody and yeah,
and then when somebody steps out of line,

1709
01:46:58.890 --> 01:47:02.010
everybody gets to act like they don't think anything fucked up.

1710
01:47:02.011 --> 01:47:04.500
And I'm not saying it,
you know,
that I,
uh,

1711
01:47:04.501 --> 01:47:08.200
that this is something right about like,
look,

1712
01:47:08.630 --> 01:47:11.850
there's gray areas where you have to think the worst of people so you can get to

1713
01:47:11.851 --> 01:47:15.470
your fucking car,
unlock it,
get in the shit.
Yeah.

1714
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:17.590
I got freaked out the other night when I got in my car.

1715
01:47:17.591 --> 01:47:19.680
I just immediately felt like there was someone in the backseat,

1716
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:21.030
like one of those horror movies.

1717
01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:24.810
And then I was also nervous because I had been singing with the radio.
It's like,

1718
01:47:24.811 --> 01:47:27.390
great,
this person is gonna kill me.
And they think I'm a nerd.

1719
01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:31.500
Probably makes it easier to kill.
Yeah.

1720
01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:35.610
I'm going to miss this guy with this thing,
especially with the bucket seats.

1721
01:47:35.611 --> 01:47:38.580
It's so easy to reach around and just stab you in the fucking chest.

1722
01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:42.570
We're back in the day.
We shared the same car again and scare me now.
Okay.

1723
01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:45.930
Well I won't say,
I won't say that then.
Oh,
by the way,
by the way,

1724
01:47:45.931 --> 01:47:50.520
everybody I've made the decision.
Um,
yeah.

1725
01:47:50.890 --> 01:47:52.940
Basically by you guys,
you know,
to like,
listen we're,
we,

1726
01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:57.150
we both exposed a lot of a ugly parts about itself.

1727
01:47:57.151 --> 01:47:59.460
So before you guys fire up for any fucking emails,

1728
01:47:59.461 --> 01:48:04.350
trashing my girlfriend or me or whatever,
look in the fucking mirror.
Okay,
go,

1729
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:07.380
go look,
go look at your cookies before you delete them on the Internet.

1730
01:48:07.381 --> 01:48:11.880
Look at the last fucking 17 websites you went to.
So let's,
let me ask you that.

1731
01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:13.620
How about that?
There's a great podcast segment.

1732
01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:18.000
Let me here and I want to hear from everybody.
Men,
women,
black,
white,
Latino,

1733
01:48:18.001 --> 01:48:22.920
Asian.
I want to hear you guys.
I want to hear like some of the times when,
uh,

1734
01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:27.060
you know,
you've,
you've done your own little racially profiling or you looked,

1735
01:48:27.061 --> 01:48:30.060
or people who aren't white,
how you think,
how you look at some white people.

1736
01:48:30.061 --> 01:48:32.760
Cause I think that's really interesting.
Like you don't hear that.

1737
01:48:32.761 --> 01:48:34.280
Like it's always white people on TV.

1738
01:48:34.281 --> 01:48:38.280
We have to confess and apologize behind the podium.
Like my old bit go and like,

1739
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:43.470
you know,
they had that rap music.
It was loud.
I got nervous.

1740
01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.810
I didn't realize that they were the swim team and they were just trying to get

1741
01:48:48.811 --> 01:48:53.100
amped up.
Didn't you see them in the,
in their little speedos?

1742
01:48:53.370 --> 01:48:57.910
I Dunno the music,
just blurt everything out,
you know.
So I want to hear from,

1743
01:48:57.911 --> 01:49:00.120
I want to hear from basically I want to hear from fucking everybody,

1744
01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:05.370
but basically times when,
when you've,
uh,
you've thought shit like that,

1745
01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:08.950
um,
or whatever.
I Dunno just the,

1746
01:49:08.951 --> 01:49:11.580
so we can get something positive out of this because so many times somebody

1747
01:49:11.581 --> 01:49:12.750
makes a comment like that,

1748
01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:15.480
like you made that kind of give a shit about the country's birthday and then

1749
01:49:15.481 --> 01:49:18.240
immediately that's,
that's the sound bite.
They tape and then,

1750
01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:21.030
and then it becomes all it then you actually get into,
oh yeah,
yeah.

1751
01:49:21.031 --> 01:49:25.050
Cause your uncle got,
you know,
got the shit kicked out of him because he,

1752
01:49:25.051 --> 01:49:29.820
his muffler was dragging as he drove himself to church in the cops felt that

1753
01:49:29.821 --> 01:49:34.230
they needed back up.
Yeah.
So,
um,
all right.
Yeah.
Okay.

1754
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:37.530
So let's,
uh,
what was,
I just lost my entire train of thought.

1755
01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:40.230
You were saying you want people to write in all know ethnicity,

1756
01:49:40.590 --> 01:49:42.180
but I was going on,
I was going on.

1757
01:49:42.181 --> 01:49:45.360
There was one other fucking thing that happened yesterday.

1758
01:49:45.390 --> 01:49:49.330
He said I have decided to you guys speak into the mic.

1759
01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:53.020
Oh you said I have decided to uh,
I get nothing.

1760
01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:57.600
What was this about the car?
Oh yes.
No,

1761
01:49:57.610 --> 01:50:00.630
the car I want to get.
No.
Yeah,
this is it.
Okay.

1762
01:50:00.670 --> 01:50:04.160
My girlfriend's beyond fucking cool.
Right.
Sorry.
It was,
that was it.

1763
01:50:04.161 --> 01:50:05.950
There was a little bit of a poor coming up to,
I was like,

1764
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:09.580
you know you get like that air bubble just comes up.
My girlfriend's beyond cool.

1765
01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:13.540
Um,
I'm going to get,
I'm going to get that dodge challenger,

1766
01:50:14.610 --> 01:50:15.910
I'm going to get it.
And I actually,

1767
01:50:15.911 --> 01:50:18.340
I was looking at the one down there with the fucking stick shift.

1768
01:50:18.341 --> 01:50:19.930
I don't know when I'm getting it,
but I'm getting that car.

1769
01:50:19.931 --> 01:50:22.060
I don't give a fuck if I get to get a used one.
But,

1770
01:50:22.090 --> 01:50:25.480
and I think it's hilarious because the stick shift one,

1771
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:29.860
you actually have to pay a gas guzzler tax 1300 bucks out here.

1772
01:50:30.610 --> 01:50:34.390
Cause it only that's even better.
So I keep the fucking,

1773
01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:39.760
the passenger seat looking cute.
All right missy.

1774
01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:44.860
So anyways,
I think it's funny,
like it says,
it gets 14 miles city,

1775
01:50:44.861 --> 01:50:47.830
which means if you actually drive it like a fucking any sort of a man,

1776
01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:51.160
you're only getting like nine.
Yeah.
And how much is that going to cost you?

1777
01:50:51.161 --> 01:50:55.960
It's a film.
Don't fucking kill my fun.
All right.
No,

1778
01:50:55.961 --> 01:50:59.740
that's going to be,
the car will drive the Prius around like a couple of queers.

1779
01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:04.960
Right.
We'll do that.
And then it's a,
the cars to shit.
That's a great car.

1780
01:51:04.970 --> 01:51:08.650
It's like a great girlfriend.
She's a cheap date.
She doesn't want anything.

1781
01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:12.070
And then that'll be the horror that it bring out every Sunday the garage comes

1782
01:51:12.071 --> 01:51:13.900
up,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1783
01:51:18.930 --> 01:51:21.910
Okay.
That's what I want to do.
Make the tires squeal,

1784
01:51:22.570 --> 01:51:25.930
capture the last drop a youth I've had.
I know that,
you know,
cause I actually,

1785
01:51:25.931 --> 01:51:29.560
I looked at a bunch of cars,
I looked at it like those use BMWs,

1786
01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:33.940
I can't believe it's that someone already farted in this car seat.
You know,

1787
01:51:33.941 --> 01:51:37.600
where they try to act like they're brand new and uh,
I just think everything,

1788
01:51:37.601 --> 01:51:41.980
everything looks like a fucking Mercedes or a BMW and the,
that dodge challenger,

1789
01:51:42.010 --> 01:51:45.100
despite the fact that the Camaro's out there and the Mustang,

1790
01:51:45.101 --> 01:51:48.700
it's still is one of the most unique looking bad ass cars out on the road.

1791
01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:52.510
And I know it's American,
which means it can go fucking in a straight line.

1792
01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:57.340
It's the shit.
But if you take a turn,
unlike those slip over.
Yeah.

1793
01:51:57.370 --> 01:52:00.490
Unlike those German cars,
there's a little excitement with it,

1794
01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:05.520
you know?
No,
you don't give a fuck.
You know,
she,

1795
01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:10.030
my girl doesn't want me to get the car.
It's so much money.
Yeah,
no,
I get it.

1796
01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:12.460
I get it.
Well that's why you're not,
why you cool.
Cause any of that.
Yeah.

1797
01:52:12.461 --> 01:52:14.860
Oh actually I might guide get that and I'm going to sit there whenever you want

1798
01:52:14.861 --> 01:52:19.240
a new guitar.
I said,
go get it.
You've earned the money to spend on it.

1799
01:52:19.241 --> 01:52:22.960
So go get yourself a new good.
Thank you.
And I look,
then you get,
yes,

1800
01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:27.520
are very supportive about giving me the green light to spend my money on myself.

1801
01:52:27.790 --> 01:52:29.200
That's a great thing.
You know what?
This is the long,

1802
01:52:29.201 --> 01:52:31.190
she'd been on the podcast and Nia,
I gotta tell you,

1803
01:52:31.191 --> 01:52:34.240
if you bring a lot to the podcast,
okay,
you bring your bring jokes,

1804
01:52:34.450 --> 01:52:37.240
you bring a bubbly attitude and you bring a little controversy.

1805
01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:41.890
You bring a little controversy.
I was really surprised.
I was really surprised.

1806
01:52:41.891 --> 01:52:44.890
But you know,
said I not have said that a no,

1807
01:52:44.891 --> 01:52:47.690
you should have because there's no way anybody's shut it off after that.

1808
01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:50.510
There's no way anybody's shut it off after that.
And,
uh,

1809
01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:52.610
I think generally speaking,
we'll get good emails,

1810
01:52:52.611 --> 01:52:54.830
but there will be a bunch of fucking douche she wants.

1811
01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:58.220
I would like to point out that back in the day I really wanted to get one of

1812
01:52:58.221 --> 01:53:00.940
those,
uh,
flag Bikini's

1813
01:53:02.810 --> 01:53:06.650
awesome.
So like hot and sexy and whatever,

1814
01:53:06.651 --> 01:53:10.910
but then you go,
if you really look like a trashy,

1815
01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:14.360
especially if you wear it in a different country,
if you buy one of those Nia,

1816
01:53:14.361 --> 01:53:19.150
I will learn to ride a fucking motorcycle just so you can be on the back with

1817
01:53:19.151 --> 01:53:22.130
your booty crack peeking out.
He out of the flag.

1818
01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:27.110
I saw that there's no way for a woman to ride on the back of a motorcycle

1819
01:53:27.111 --> 01:53:28.640
without her fucking underwear hanging out.

1820
01:53:28.641 --> 01:53:33.641
I saw this skinny girl was on the back of a bike yesterday and her entire like,

1821
01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:37.400
you know the Thong where you have like,
it's not,
it's not a g string,

1822
01:53:37.401 --> 01:53:39.530
it's a thong.
So you have that slice of Pie,

1823
01:53:39.531 --> 01:53:44.530
bit of fabric is hanging out.
The top of it was where,

1824
01:53:44.531 --> 01:53:45.051
where the,

1825
01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:49.160
the tramp stamp tattoo should have been by the time she leaned forward.
Yeah,

1826
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:53.840
it was great.
It was America.
Speaking of which,
I saw a girl,
a couple,

1827
01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:57.830
well I saw her at this,
this last pool party I went to and she's a great girl,

1828
01:53:57.831 --> 01:53:59.010
but she has a,
uh,

1829
01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:03.680
made in the USA Tatsu in the tramp stamp area.

1830
01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:09.110
Wow.
God bless her.
She's a great girl.
And I said,
oh,
so are you,
you know,

1831
01:54:09.111 --> 01:54:13.670
and the,
the,
the,
the armed forces or something.
Fuck the whole base.

1832
01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:23.450
No,
she was just like,
I just love this country.
When you put the microphone,

1833
01:54:23.451 --> 01:54:24.051
there you go.
I love,

1834
01:54:24.051 --> 01:54:28.130
I love what this country stands for and I'm really proud to be an American.

1835
01:54:28.131 --> 01:54:31.550
And I said,
all right,
you let her get away with that.
I mean,

1836
01:54:31.551 --> 01:54:35.190
what was I going to say?
Okay,
I respect that.
But were you going say,

1837
01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:39.660
cause I thought,
oh,
I'm just really patriotic.
Yeah,
no,
you're,
you're right.

1838
01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:42.260
Just kind of accepted it.
She said she,
I asked her,

1839
01:54:42.261 --> 01:54:47.261
she gave me an answer and moved on and now exposing her on the podcast.

1840
01:54:48.730 --> 01:54:51.860
You are,
you were talking about how like,
you know,

1841
01:54:51.861 --> 01:54:55.190
cause I'm always looking at cars right on the Internet and all that type of shit

1842
01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:56.810
and uh,

1843
01:54:57.290 --> 01:55:00.140
he was saying why do they always have like the women draped over him and all

1844
01:55:00.141 --> 01:55:04.010
that?
Cause the whole thing.
It's that guy visual thing.
You know what I mean?

1845
01:55:04.011 --> 01:55:06.370
Like when I,
when I look at the,
I'm not glad you,

1846
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:08.390
like when I was looking at that challenge or I actually got,

1847
01:55:08.391 --> 01:55:12.590
I got a little aroused and I'm not even,
I'm not even joking.

1848
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:15.680
No,
I'm serious.
Remember how you wanted to get off the lot.

1849
01:55:15.681 --> 01:55:18.340
But I was sort of lingering with one of my hands in my pocket.

1850
01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:22.280
I had filled up a little bit.
I know,

1851
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:27.590
but I'm saying like she is tapped into that with that made in the USA thing.

1852
01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:31.250
Um Oh.
Like guys will be into that,

1853
01:55:31.490 --> 01:55:35.150
that whole sort of like fuck.
And I got a bear.

1854
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:38.270
I got a fucking car and this is my fucking woman.

1855
01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:42.350
4th of July you got a sparkler.
She's blowing you.

1856
01:55:42.710 --> 01:55:44.910
She's actually a lesbian.

1857
01:55:46.770 --> 01:55:49.810
Is she good looking lesbian?
That's where I draw the line.
Oh,
there you go.
Okay.

1858
01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:53.660
Yeah.
I have no tolerance for not good looking lesbians.

1859
01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:58.040
I'm really a snob when it comes to this salary.
Right.
A lot of lesbian.
I like,
oh,

1860
01:55:58.041 --> 01:56:01.940
now you just dug the hole again.
There's ugly straight people.

1861
01:56:01.941 --> 01:56:03.360
There's ugly lesbian.
So what do you,

1862
01:56:03.450 --> 01:56:06.870
what did I like good looking lesbians and I like to do,

1863
01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:11.000
because you're a straight man that has a fantasy of being with like a couple of,

1864
01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:14.150
I'll just check off in the corner like a gentleman.

1865
01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:19.580
I would rather you admit to wanting to have a threesome with lesbians and say,

1866
01:56:19.590 --> 01:56:24.090
Yo,
I want to be brief.
I want to wear a ring.
Yeah.
Like I'm in my creepy years,

1867
01:56:24.091 --> 01:56:28.800
I'm 42 dark socks pulled up to the knees when tips,
sneakers,

1868
01:56:29.570 --> 01:56:33.880
shoes.
I mean,
um,
no I don't,
I don't have like any,
uh,

1869
01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:36.730
I don't have any,
I have zero tolerance.

1870
01:56:37.850 --> 01:56:41.720
Be attractive as a lesbian step up your game.
I have had it.

1871
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:45.890
Why Mediocre looking glass?
I didn't realize it was such a problem.

1872
01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:50.360
There is one group of people in this country that I think needs to get out.

1873
01:56:50.361 --> 01:56:54.170
Take the hitch off.
Maybe they're talking about these illegal immigrants.

1874
01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:57.860
As long as you're good looking,
you can come into this fucking country.

1875
01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:03.320
I am equal up kick ugly.
Yeah.
That's what I get to stay for some reason.

1876
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:08.830
Well,
you're not ugly,
Huh?
Uh,
right.
Attractive.

1877
01:57:08.970 --> 01:57:11.580
Okay,
please.
What?
Please,

1878
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.560
how hard did you laugh the other day when you,
you,

1879
01:57:15.561 --> 01:57:20.130
you would put those little fashion fucking slits in your,
in your jeans.

1880
01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:23.390
And I was joking that I was going to do it my jeans.
I said,

1881
01:57:23.391 --> 01:57:27.170
what would you do if I showed that to my jeans?
Exposing my creamy thighs.

1882
01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:29.990
How hard did you laugh?
I'm a fucking mutiny.

1883
01:57:29.991 --> 01:57:33.110
I'm one step away from being a fucking albino.
All right,
we're,
we're like,

1884
01:57:33.170 --> 01:57:37.580
we're like an hour to minutes in here that very controversial.
Nia Renee Hill.

1885
01:57:37.581 --> 01:57:40.850
Everybody look at that took up like an hour of your day.

1886
01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:44.840
Happy fourth everybody forth.
And uh,

1887
01:57:44.841 --> 01:57:46.940
I'm sorry if you had to work today,
I hope this,
uh,

1888
01:57:46.941 --> 01:57:50.550
this podcast made it a little more enjoyable.
Ed.
Hey,

1889
01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:53.290
can I get a God blessed the troops or something from your neighbor?
Absolutely.

1890
01:57:53.370 --> 01:57:58.020
God bless the troops.
100% there you go.
There you can go perform for them.

1891
01:57:58.050 --> 01:58:00.840
They're doing a lot.
So you want me to go do that Gig on the front lines?

1892
01:58:00.841 --> 01:58:03.330
I'm going to fucking do it.
I think you should be doing that.

1893
01:58:03.331 --> 01:58:07.320
And I'm getting the fucking challenger America.
They don't get nearly as a pre.

1894
01:58:07.321 --> 01:58:09.390
I mean,
everyone says they appreciate the troops,

1895
01:58:09.391 --> 01:58:11.490
but I don't know that they get a lot of love,

1896
01:58:11.491 --> 01:58:14.370
especially from people who are anti this war,

1897
01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:18.240
but they're doing a lot of shit that most people wouldn't do.
So I commend them,

1898
01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:20.400
which goes back to my brave,
my bit,

1899
01:58:20.910 --> 01:58:22.820
that bit that I was doing when they was saying,
being a mother,

1900
01:58:22.821 --> 01:58:25.140
it's the toughest job on the planet.
Really?

1901
01:58:26.010 --> 01:58:29.730
Go fight a fucking war lady.
Put j Brown.
I go make a pie.

1902
01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:33.570
It's America's mattress,
America's birthday.
All right,

1903
01:58:33.571 --> 01:58:34.980
thanks for listening to everybody talk to you.

1904
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:45.000
