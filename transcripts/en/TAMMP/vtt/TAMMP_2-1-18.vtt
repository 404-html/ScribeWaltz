00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.760
Hey,
what's going on?
It's still burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:07.010
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:11.990
And I'm just checking in.
Aha.

4
00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:16.430
You,
Ooh,
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.380
How are you?
How's your week going?
I hope it's gone.
Wonderful up here.

6
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.810
You're a giant yourselves.

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.520
<v 0>Um,
I'm actually having a great week.
I just did a a,
I just did too.</v>

8
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.020
<v 1>Two nights at the Irvine Improv that I had not been to and fuck any,</v>

9
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.010
<v 0>he probably like,
why bill?
Why did you bend?
Well,</v>

10
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:45.450
I've been done the Irvine Improv and so many fucking years.
Why is it,
I mean,

11
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:47.880
it's a mirror fucking 15,

12
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:51.840
20 miles away from Hollywood where you live.

13
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:55.860
Your big fucking phony.
What happened?
Huh?
Why didn't you go?

14
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:59.580
We are too busy getting fucking sexually harassed,
you know,

15
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.640
so you didn't drive down there?
No,
that's not,
that's a good gas.

16
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.570
That would be a good guest with,
with all the stories out there.
Um,

17
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.400
I was not sexually harassed.
I wanted it.
No.
Um,

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.670
I didn't go down there because the fucking traffic,

19
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.150
<v 1>the Goddamn motherfucking traffic on the way down there,</v>

20
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.520
it's like a fucking two hour drive.

21
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.930
<v 1>To go like fucking 15,
20 miles.</v>

23
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:28.700
It's like a two hour drive and then when you go back you think it will,

24
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:32.530
at least now it's like around midnight there's going to be no fucking traffic.

25
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.310
But then that's when they work on the fucking road and they get it all the way

26
00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:40.480
down to one lane and actually take everybody on the highway off of the fucking

27
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:44.200
highway.
And at that point you can kind of go fuck yourselves.

28
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.220
Maybe they put a couple of signs up and it just became like this,

29
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.090
this eight hour gig that was like fun.

30
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.810
<v 0>Good.
Like I just,
I don't know,
I've just,</v>

31
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.660
I don't know how many fucking miles I've driven in my career,
but that,

32
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.380
that was the Gig that broke me.
I was just like,
I can't fucking do this anymore.

33
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.120
All right.
So anyways,
I,
uh,

34
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.040
start my year on the road this weekend coming up tomorrow.

35
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.960
Actually,
I'm going to be in Reno.

36
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.610
So all Billy's got to shake the rust off.
Alright.
Oh,

37
00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:22.030
Billy dad pants.
Oh,
Billy around the house.

38
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.720
It's got a fucking remember how to do stand up until I just shut my recorder
off.

39
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.800
Just slammed down on the ground.
Yes.
So I need to do a couple of tune up shows.

40
00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:34.270
So I went down there and I was like,
wait a minute.

41
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.820
I've gotten my pilot's license since the last time we did the Irvine Improv.

42
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.440
I'll rent a fucking are 20 to fly down with an instructor and I'll go up and

43
00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:45.200
over,

44
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.610
<v 2>but a Yada Yada,
Yada.
Go</v>

45
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.170
<v 0>fuck yourselves.
You know,</v>

46
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.200
fly over all of that shit.
This is what a contact I.

47
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.920
So I go over there like,
we start flying down with my instructor and all,

48
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.710
I'm praying for his bumper to bumper traffic.

49
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.860
All I want to see is red fucking break legs,

50
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.840
not moving the hallway down.
So we go to takeoff.

51
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.820
There's a full moon in the sky.

52
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.010
Beautiful sunset over the fucking wall.
I mean,
it's beautiful.

53
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.480
I get in the fucking air and I'm looking down.
The traffic's not moving that bed.

54
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.860
Like what the fuck,
right.
Go right over downtown La,
Florida.

55
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:33.430
Burbank dude.
We got down there from startup to shut down.

56
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.960
We got there in like 32 minutes.
It was incredible.

57
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.910
Jumped in a cab.
Quick little five minute ride from John Wayne or whatever.

58
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.320
A 10 minute ride over.
No traffic.
I got there,
I was in the best mood,

59
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.200
um,
since I had been there.

60
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.320
They moved to like a new location and that talking gigantic mall of the mall.

61
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:58.300
So big as a Ferris wheel.
Okay.

62
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.800
Now I'm not trying to step on any toes out there in Minnesota.
All right.

63
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:05.110
I know you got it.
You got to fucking rollercoaster in yours.

64
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:08.890
But this is like the biggest one that I've seen or be honest with you that I

65
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:12.830
want to see.
It's like a little city.
You know,
like one night,

66
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.850
the second night we were there,

67
00:04:13.851 --> 00:04:17.120
the cab driver dropped us off and then we realized that even though we were at

68
00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:19.370
the mall that the Improv was in,

69
00:04:19.371 --> 00:04:22.580
we were still like a half a mile away from where the fucking thing was.

70
00:04:22.581 --> 00:04:27.500
So we had to get back in the cab.
Hey,

71
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.450
I'm telling you,
it was huge.
Okay.
So,
and then we go,
but you know,

72
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.160
do two shows,
the show ends get back in the helicopter,
you know,

73
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.430
um,
it was a little,
you know,
I haven't done a lot of night flights,

74
00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:42.740
so flying down was a little weird because of all the lights and everything,

75
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.800
but on the way back he gives you,
you can see the lights of downtown La.

76
00:04:45.801 --> 00:04:49.010
So just point right at that and um,

77
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.310
came back,
went Kohanga pass and right back in,
it was just,
it was fucking great.

78
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.850
Came home,
woke up the next day,
felt great,

79
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:01.240
was excited about going down there again.
All right.
Obviously,

80
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.960
you know that if I'm telling all these fucking the story in this detailed,

81
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:07.570
it's something ended up happening,
right?
So

82
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.330
next night,
same bucket thing,
I get down there,
I'm all excited,
right?

83
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:17.800
We get in the helicopter.
Same thing,
full moon again,
another great sunset.

84
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.570
And this time what I wanted to see,
bumper to bumper,

85
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.970
horrific fucking traffic.

86
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.750
<v 3>Okay.</v>

87
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.530
<v 0>And I loved it.</v>

88
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.760
I had no sympathy for my fellow man what I want.

89
00:05:31.761 --> 00:05:36.140
I was selfish in that moment.
I wanted what I want.
I want it to be like,
yes.

90
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.340
That's why I did it.

91
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.400
And I needed all of these other people to suffer for me to feel good about the

92
00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.770
decision that I made.
All right.
Well,

93
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.020
we all know what happens when you do shit like that.

94
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.370
When you treat your fellow man

95
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.080
like a fucking extra in the movie of your own life,
guess what happened?

96
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.450
I had two wonderful fucking shelves.

97
00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.843
<v 4>MMM.</v>

98
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.450
<v 0>And I get off stage and my instructor goes,
you're not going to believe this.</v>

99
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.310
The airport is closed.
I go,
what do you mean his clothes?
He goes,

100
00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:11.920
I looked at the no Tams,
which a notice to all airman,

101
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.300
and it said that they were working on,
you know,
the fucking lights,

102
00:06:16.301 --> 00:06:19.930
the runway lights and all that shit at the airport.
But we were thinking,
Hey,

103
00:06:19.931 --> 00:06:24.700
we're a fucking helicopter.
We do whatever we want,
right?
Not the case.

104
00:06:24.701 --> 00:06:29.040
They're working on the lights.
So they shut the fucking thing down.
So now I,

105
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.290
we can't fly back.
And I'm like,

106
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:34.690
how the fuck am I going to get home?

107
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.760
The instructor has to get a hotel room because he's got to fly the helicopter

108
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:41.840
back because it's booked to be used on instruction the next day.

109
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.670
So we make sure he gets a fucking room.
And then,
um,

110
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.270
I ended up riding back with Josh Adam,
my office.

111
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.520
So I'm in the car.

112
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.880
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

113
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.290
<v 0>he's got a friend there.
So now there's three of us in his,</v>

114
00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:57.820
basically his two seater,

115
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.233
<v 4>you know,</v>

116
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.380
<v 0>his front and the back kind of had to kind of sit sideways.
Right.</v>

117
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.390
So we're driving and I'm like,
God,
Jesus Christ.
And I laughed at my point and,

118
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.730
but you know,
it's late at fucking night.
We'll cruise home,

119
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.800
we'll listen to some tunes or whatever.

120
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.510
We started doing that and we get about three miles into the Gig and the fucking,

121
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.460
I see his break lights and I'm like,
oh no,
not,

122
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.700
not the shutdown of the highway.
And this exactly what it was.

123
00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:31.660
It was a shut down on the highway down to two lanes.

124
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.370
And I'm thinking,
okay,
maybe,

125
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.420
maybe we'll just drive around some trucks down to one lane.
Okay,
okay.

126
00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:40.720
Maybe they're just working on three lanes to the fucking off ramp.

127
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.590
They send it entire highway of people off the fucking off ramp tasks.

128
00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:49.860
Like a fucking Carl's Jr and then go fuck yourself.
Yeah.

129
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.050
So now we're fucking ways.

130
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.290
Everybody's on ways trying to fucking figure out how to get there.

131
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.530
Try to get back to the highway when you can get back on it.

132
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:05.430
We finally see where we can take a left hand turn and we get to the intersection

133
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.860
and there's like six police cars and a fucking SUV that slammed into a tree.

134
00:08:10.931 --> 00:08:15.430
So obviously there was some sort of car chase there,
so we can't make a left.

135
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.570
Is there a fucking reason why the fire department and the fucking police just

136
00:08:21.571 --> 00:08:25.740
have to park and the most Douchey is fucking way.
So there's no possible way.

137
00:08:25.741 --> 00:08:27.540
I know you don't want to get hit.

138
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.920
Jesus Christ.
Can you,
can you just give us an avenue Gallup go fuck.

139
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:36.980
I'm sure that's because when they did some fucking asshole hit somebody and they

140
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:39.020
got killed,
but I'm being selfish come together.

141
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.460
So when he was on telling you is my Karma,
I paid for it.
And um,

142
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.430
I didn't get home until fucking like I think two,
10 in the morning,

143
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.990
you know,
my beautiful daughter gets up at about,
Oh,
I dunno,

144
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.060
six 26 30 in the morning.
So right now I feel like I'm drunk.
However,

145
00:08:58.061 --> 00:09:00.370
having said that,
um,

146
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.160
this month was one of the great month this past month,

147
00:09:03.161 --> 00:09:06.910
they should say it was one of the great months of my life because for the simple

148
00:09:06.911 --> 00:09:11.260
fact,
after 20 years of doing the road,
I was not on the road.
And uh,

149
00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.210
I got to spend all this time with my family.

150
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:18.700
You don't just do it dad and husband Shit,
which I got to admit,

151
00:09:18.701 --> 00:09:19.570
it's pretty awesome.

152
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.550
I remember I used to go to the mall and I would look at people,
you know,

153
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:25.930
<v 4>okay,</v>

154
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.870
<v 0>pushing their kids around and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And like,</v>

155
00:09:28.871 --> 00:09:31.600
I knew having a kid was awesome,
but I used to always look at them like,

156
00:09:31.601 --> 00:09:34.840
oh my God,
look at them,
they're trapped,
they can't get out.

157
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:39.370
It was like claustrophobic to me.
And now that I'm in that situation,

158
00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:40.900
I gotta admit I love going to the mall.

159
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:48.160
I really fucking enjoy it.
You know,
my daughter is hilarious.

160
00:09:48.161 --> 00:09:52.360
We just push her around in the stroller and she waves to everybody,

161
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.530
you know,
going,
hi,
hi.
You know,
come on man.

162
00:09:57.531 --> 00:09:59.310
A baby waves at you.
It says hi.

163
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:02.040
It's so he put putting smiles on grumpy people's faces.
It was so,

164
00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.510
it was tremendous.
Um,

165
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.130
and I got a bunch of hours,
uh,

166
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.750
flying the helicopter.
You know,
I wanted to get up to 150 hours,

167
00:10:13.751 --> 00:10:14.620
which I did last night.

168
00:10:14.621 --> 00:10:18.820
I don't know what I got because I wasn't able to look at the Hobbs meter cause

169
00:10:18.821 --> 00:10:23.200
we didn't fly back.
So I think I got a 0.5 and I was at one 49.9,

170
00:10:23.201 --> 00:10:25.150
so I know I'm over.
So I got one 50.

171
00:10:25.151 --> 00:10:29.530
So my goal is this year I want to get a 12 hours a month,

172
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.030
so by the end of the year have roughly about 300 hours.
And um,

173
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.490
<v 4>okay.</v>

174
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.030
<v 0>You don't,
I don't know.
Whatever I ate,
I get into shit.</v>

175
00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.900
So having said that,
all right.

176
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:45.600
<v 4>Okay.</v>

177
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.480
<v 0>It was still incredible experience and it's a good story.</v>

178
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.960
You know that the fucking,
you know,
and I also learn something.
No one,

179
00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:55.350
they shut down the lights just because we don't have to use the fucking runway.

180
00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:58.800
You still can't fly out.
I learned that.
Um,

181
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.650
what else?
Uh,
oh,
and on Monday,
this is the make a wish week.

182
00:11:04.651 --> 00:11:08.070
Then I'm having Monday,
uh,

183
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.910
I went with Dave,
my,
my,
my drum teacher.

184
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:16.350
I went to ms sugar who I'd never seen live.
And uh,

185
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:21.030
I gotta tell you it was a fucking life altering experience.

186
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.910
I,
I can't remember the last time I saw fucking van that blew my mind like that.

187
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.170
They are a,
uh,
a heavy metal band.
I had heavy metal,

188
00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:34.260
a metal band from Sweden to,

189
00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:38.130
I've always heard of and I always tried to get into it,
but

190
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:39.460
<v 4>okay.</v>

191
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.700
<v 0>The combination of the singer that Rah,
Rah,
Rah,
Rah and singing like that.</v>

192
00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:45.760
I'm already an angry enough guy.
I'm like,
Jesus Christ,

193
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.420
am I really going to have this on my fucking hard drive?
Um,

194
00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:55.710
and then like the music was so I didn't know what was going on.

195
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.120
I didn't like so many of the songs,

196
00:11:57.121 --> 00:11:59.520
like the drummer is basically playing like a poly rhythm.

197
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.410
It's like his body is playing two different songs.
I mean the,

198
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.550
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about,
but as far as I could tell,

199
00:12:05.551 --> 00:12:10.551
it seemed like on top he would be playing in like four and then his feet are

200
00:12:11.371 --> 00:12:14.010
just,
I don't know what they're playing.
Like a completely different song.

201
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.340
And then the band is playing the rhythm to his feet,

202
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:22.020
but the crowd is nodding to what the fuck he's doing with his hands.

203
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:26.470
Does anybody's grooving with this shit?
I Dunno.

204
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.620
Do you want to check out of a fucking unbelievable sign?

205
00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:31.130
They got this song bleed.

206
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.690
Then on top he's playing like eighth notes with a backbeat on three.

207
00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:37.960
<v 4>Okay.</v>

208
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.640
<v 0>So everybody's head is moving to that like,
Gah,
Gah,
Gah,</v>

209
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.770
I can't even do it.
Right.
But underneath his speed or going like deputy,
deputy,

210
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.280
the whole fucking song basically.

211
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.490
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

212
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:57.290
<v 0>it's on top.
He's like,
Dad,
Dad,
Dad,
Dad,</v>

213
00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:02.480
Dad,
dad underneath this.
So keep going.

214
00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:03.314
Insane.

215
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.193
<v 4>Okay.</v>

216
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.880
<v 0>You know,
like I always like if you ever heard voices,</v>

217
00:13:07.881 --> 00:13:09.800
I can think that's the music version of that song.

218
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.980
Like up top was be somebody talking to you going like,
hey,

219
00:13:12.981 --> 00:13:14.600
you want to go to the mall?
Maybe,
you know,

220
00:13:14.601 --> 00:13:17.150
I heard they opened a new fucking Starbucks or blah,
blah,
blah.

221
00:13:17.151 --> 00:13:18.890
And underneath you,
these demons going to edit it.

222
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.610
<v 1>Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
dat,
Dat,
dat.</v>

223
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:27.620
<v 0>Um,
it's like a seven minute song.
I'm never fucking seat.</v>

224
00:13:27.621 --> 00:13:31.320
And they played it live.
It just,
it sounded as good as what they played on the,

225
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.510
on the record.

226
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.020
And then the whole fucking night,
you never saw their faces.

227
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.530
It was just these fucking strobe lights going at you.

228
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.330
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

229
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.120
<v 0>In the,
in,
you know,
lined up with the bass drum.</v>

230
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.670
So everybody's fucking nod to the basis and gallbladder

231
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.590
<v 1>Badabadabadabada bay to bay,
right.</v>

232
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.960
<v 0>It's like fucking gay,
gay,
Gay,
Gay,
gay game,
your fucking face.
It was,</v>

233
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.160
I never thought it'd be into some shit like that.
I,
I can't,
I,

234
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.130
I can't say enough how fucking unbelievable that band is.

235
00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:06.460
And you're doing yourself a disservice as a Cuban being if you never see them

236
00:14:06.461 --> 00:14:08.200
live.
It was fucking unbelievable.

237
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.500
And the amount of like famous drummers that I saw standing there just fucking

238
00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:18.010
geeking out,
big smiles on their face,
shaking their head,

239
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.520
you know,
like reaffirm it to me is just so,
you know,

240
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.300
casual fan of music that yes.
What I am is,

241
00:14:25.301 --> 00:14:28.270
is hearing is that unbelievable?

242
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:34.410
It's so unbelievable that drummers that I'm blown away by are blown away by this

243
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:39.190
shit.
So I dunno.
I Dunno how many more tour dates they have.

244
00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:43.250
I think I overheard somebody saying maybe that was the last on this run.
I Dunno.

245
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.690
But like for the rest of my life,
as long as those guys play,

246
00:14:46.691 --> 00:14:50.380
when they come to town,
I'm definitely going to go see him.
And,
um,

247
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.950
I actually liked to sing.
And now when you,

248
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.650
and I think when you're dealing with the level of music like that,

249
00:14:56.651 --> 00:15:00.340
that's so far beyond what the fuck you're listening to.
You know,
like,

250
00:15:00.341 --> 00:15:03.820
I still occasionally listened to poison.
I'm not proud of it.

251
00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.670
I'm not ashamed of it.
It's just what I listened to when I was growing up.

252
00:15:06.671 --> 00:15:11.420
I was like fucking 16,
17 when it came out and a bay.
He's bad pay.

253
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.880
I see y'all back though.

254
00:15:12.881 --> 00:15:16.810
I got fucking listen to him talk dirty me was a good fucking song.

255
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.020
So that's where I was coming from.
Before that,
I think,
I don't know,

256
00:15:23.021 --> 00:15:25.270
I was listening to the partridge family and the monkeys,

257
00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.330
so my sugar was a big leap for me.

258
00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.340
Thomas Hockey is the name of their drummer.
Ed.
Um,

259
00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.370
I got to know everybody's name in that band because I don't know how the fuck

260
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.480
they did what I saw that I've got.
I didn't see it live.

261
00:15:43.481 --> 00:15:44.770
I wouldn't think that they could do it.

262
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.533
<v 4>MMM.</v>

263
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.040
<v 0>Anyways,
Jesus Christ.</v>

264
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.620
You know what it reminded me of when he played that Song live,
uh,
bleed

265
00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.360
last time I heard something like that.
Always when,
uh,

266
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.690
somebody told me though to get that miles Davis album,
uh,

267
00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:07.890
foreign Moore and Tony Williams is playing the ride cymbal.

268
00:16:07.891 --> 00:16:11.100
So fucking at such a blistering temple,

269
00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:14.370
but you can hear every note.
It's so clean.

270
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.090
It never gets muddy or anything and it's just like,

271
00:16:18.091 --> 00:16:22.980
how can a human being do that?
You know?
Well,
maybe like buddy rich,

272
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.950
what he's playing like on his snare drum,
like a zillion miles an hour.

273
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:32.720
But you can,
like,
you can hear every note,
nothing overlaps.

274
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.350
This dude was basically doing that with his feet.

275
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.450
I've been trying to explain to people what the fuck he's doing.

276
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:42.860
I can't even do with my hands.

277
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.930
Like half the temple that he's doing with his feet and I can't even do that for

278
00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:51.170
like four seconds.
And he plays that song for like seven minutes.

279
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.050
I don't know.
All right,
I'm done.
I'm done.
Please go see them live.

280
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.960
Uh,
Jesus Christ.
I think I'm going to have to,

281
00:17:01.961 --> 00:17:03.070
and they'd been playing.
They'd been,

282
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.570
I guess they started it back like fucking 1989 which is even more unbelievable

283
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.720
because 1989 like what was popular and what was out there?

284
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:18.490
What came out in 89 in my world.
Dot.
Motley Crue.
Dr feelgood.

285
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.020
All right.
Which I love that album,
right?

286
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.000
He's the want to call it I to pay you good.
Right?

287
00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.620
That's what the fuck was popular.

288
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:31.660
These guys had the balls to ignore that,
you know,

289
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:38.300
in fucking sitting there fucking garage and Sweden and workout per dealer.

290
00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:40.370
A debater,
debater to butter.
Butter to butter Burger Burger.

291
00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:44.980
But that's fucking unreal.
Um,
all right,

292
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.910
so,
so what else?
So I go to fucking Reno.

293
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.250
What am I favorite fucking cities?

294
00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:54.210
<v 3>Okay.</v>

295
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.940
<v 0>Anybody can go to Vegas.
It takes a real fucking man.
He going to read up.</v>

296
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.580
That's when you know you're gambling.

297
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:03.523
<v 3>Okay.</v>

298
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.140
<v 0>Reno is the most sugar of fucking casino towns.</v>

299
00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:16.320
Los Angeles,
I mean,
I'm sorry it Las Vegas.
That's poison.
Eh?

300
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:21.160
We Bros has it stone,
right?
Fat Checks doing the coyote ugly shit.

301
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:22.850
<v 3>Okay.</v>

302
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.690
<v 0>Upon the bars.
That's what fucking Pegasus.
Okay,
but you,
you want the real shit,</v>

303
00:18:26.691 --> 00:18:31.290
the real degenerate fucking gambler that lost everything.
You go to Reno.
Um,

304
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.810
I don't know if that's a compliment.
It was trying to be maybe Laughlin,
Laughlin,

305
00:18:38.811 --> 00:18:39.310
Nevada.

306
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.860
Every tell you that time I did that Gig I opened for Wynonna Judd in a parking

307
00:18:42.861 --> 00:18:43.694
lot.

308
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.810
<v 3>Okay.</v>

309
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.210
<v 0>She was so fucking,
you know,
it was,</v>

310
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:51.320
she was such a big act and she was playing loft from the VAT or that they didn't

311
00:18:51.321 --> 00:18:53.180
have a venue big enough for a show.

312
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.080
So they just set up two seats out in the fucking parking lot.

313
00:18:57.081 --> 00:18:59.210
Like behind the crowd was the parking garage.

314
00:18:59.211 --> 00:19:04.211
Like I could literally see my rental car while while I was on on stage bombing.

315
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:06.510
<v 3>Okay.</v>

316
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:10.020
<v 0>Fucking bombing.
What was at the time I bought,</v>

317
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.760
I met at a good set.

318
00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:17.980
Now the time I was bombing was I opened for Wynonna Judd outside again at a

319
00:19:17.981 --> 00:19:21.490
fucking race track,
like a horse race track or some shit.

320
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.790
I remember the sun was on it.
I was like an afternoon gig.

321
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.450
It's one of those things before you go on to say she was great.

322
00:19:29.451 --> 00:19:31.130
She always treated me great and everything like that.

323
00:19:31.131 --> 00:19:32.810
But people can listen to music during the day,

324
00:19:32.811 --> 00:19:36.380
but you can't listen to standup like outside when the sun is up,
stand up.

325
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.790
It's a nighttime thing.
It's an indoor thing.
It's an evil thing.
It's,

326
00:19:40.791 --> 00:19:42.170
it's an after fucking,

327
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.250
even eight o'clock feels too early to do my act to be honest with you.

328
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.253
<v 3>MMM.</v>

329
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.290
<v 0>So I dunno what the fuck time it wasn't.</v>

330
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.530
It must've been the summer because the sun was still out and I'm standing there

331
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:59.750
doing my bullshit outside,
you know,

332
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.080
you know you're doing your action,
you know the,
and you're thinking like,
Oh man,

333
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:05.250
I should've put on sunscreen.

334
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:13.350
So on stage,
and there's lesbians in the crowd,
right?

335
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:15.163
Um,

336
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.620
or the only heterosexual woman ever with that haircut was in the crowd.

337
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:24.000
She was dressed like Gi Jane if she stopped fucking working out.
Right.
And she,

338
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.880
the whole time I'm on stage,
she's going,

339
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.520
<v 3>no,
no,
no,
no.</v>

340
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:34.390
<v 0>And she's turning around trying to get the rest of the crowd to do it.</v>

341
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.280
You know,

342
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.670
they don't know thinking right now I realize what a fucking sexist cunt she was.

343
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.660
Cause I swear to God,
if I was a female comic,
she wouldn't have said Shit.

344
00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.570
She would've given me a chance.
The whole fucking set.

345
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.480
I'm update trying to do my bullshit.
Right.
What's up with Bill Clinton?

346
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.750
Keep lead the cigar,
you know,

347
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.830
whatever the fuck I was talking about back then and she's gone.
Wow.
No.
Wow.

348
00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.800
And I finally just stopped and it go,
Hey lady,

349
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.630
I deliberately said,
Hey lady,
cause I knew that would piss her off.
I go,

350
00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.800
do you think I don't realize why everybody's here,
do you think?

351
00:21:14.801 --> 00:21:16.060
I think that,
you know,

352
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:21.090
5,000 people showed up to a fucking race track at three o'clock in the afternoon

353
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.490
to see me
with no TV credits.

354
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.220
Listen,
why not?

355
00:21:28.221 --> 00:21:32.390
A judge is coming out in 15 minutes no matter what.
Okay,

356
00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:35.480
I'm not going to forget that and keep doing going and just doing my act.

357
00:21:35.481 --> 00:21:38.750
And I kept just fucking went off on her and people will all,
you know,

358
00:21:38.751 --> 00:21:42.490
cause it's country crowd,
you know,
family values,
everybody's all fucking Plat,

359
00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.890
right?
Dayton within their own rice,
you know,

360
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.340
and I didn't get the crowd.

361
00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:52.880
I didn't turn them around until I made fun of her haircut.
And then I did that.

362
00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.840
And then all the conservative homophobes actually got down on my side.

363
00:21:56.841 --> 00:22:00.440
I actually used homophobia in that desperate moment.

364
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.440
You know,
I still stand by it.
I don't feel bad.

365
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.990
Oh well maybe I feel a little bit bad about it,
but you know what?
Fuck her.

366
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.580
She sexist.
They go,
here's some fucking ugliness right back at Ya.

367
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.400
I still remember her fucking face.
You know what she looked like?

368
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.610
Remember that fucking did you see,
um,

369
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.700
the fuck who said shelf?
What's that American horror story?

370
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.260
Do you remember that season when they were in the insane asylum and then there

371
00:22:29.261 --> 00:22:33.250
was that fucking mute and look at human big with the,

372
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.710
there was a woman,
she had like giant,
these giant fucking years.

373
00:22:36.711 --> 00:22:39.880
She's actually gorgeous in real life.
I don't know what the fuck they did.

374
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.540
CGI had some shit.
She looked like,
I dunno what,

375
00:22:44.541 --> 00:22:49.370
like like something out of a fairytale that lived under a bridge yet was sort of

376
00:22:49.371 --> 00:22:50.510
adorable.
I Dunno.

377
00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.170
That's what this woman looked like with glasses dressed like GI Jane.

378
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.800
They got the Monday morning.
Photoshop could not be any easier.
I just,

379
00:22:57.801 --> 00:23:01.400
I just gave you a roadmap and she was going,
wow.
No,
no.

380
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.630
I want to say she had a little rat tail,
two braided calming down.

381
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.930
I don't know if that was one of those gigs when I was just fucking,

382
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.850
I'm a red got offstage and I just remember after I'd gone off when I was

383
00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:17.570
thinking like,
Oh fuck,
I'm probably going to get fired off to this Gig,

384
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.270
but I don't think anybody really heard it.
In my mind,

385
00:23:20.271 --> 00:23:21.590
that moment lasted 20 minutes.

386
00:23:21.591 --> 00:23:25.730
It probably lasted all of eight seconds or 10 seconds.

387
00:23:25.731 --> 00:23:28.400
How long does it take to just fucking decimates somebody?
I don't know.

388
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.770
I don't pretend to know,
but you know what people,

389
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.580
you know what it is this Sunday.
Do you have any idea what it is?
Is Sunday.

390
00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:36.740
It's super bowl Sunday,

391
00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.760
super bowl Sunday and then we England Patriots and the Rod precedented 10th

392
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.613
super.

393
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.000
<v 4>Okay,</v>

394
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.630
<v 0>I'll go in for their six.
Do you realize if Tom Brady wins</v>

395
00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.290
the patriots win I should say right?
Tom Brady gets his sixth ring.

396
00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:58.560
He will have more super bowl championships than every franchise in the NFL

397
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.320
except for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

398
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.990
The entire fucking franchise

399
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.780
right now he has more than every fucking franchise.

400
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.230
That's what I say to giant fans when they break my balls and we'd be it twice.

401
00:24:16.231 --> 00:24:17.250
Yeah you did.
But you know what?

402
00:24:17.251 --> 00:24:20.550
Tom Has more rings in your franchise and its entire fucking history.

403
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.920
So I will take those two losses.
And you know what?

404
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.900
If you could turn the fucking tables and Eli could be sitting here with five

405
00:24:27.901 --> 00:24:31.110
rings and two losses to the Patriots,
you'd fucking take that too.

406
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.100
Why wouldn't ya?

407
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.823
<v 4>You know</v>

408
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.710
<v 0>that'd be body takes that deal.
Those fucking terrorist take debt deal.</v>

409
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.620
That's the same deal they take with the virgin.
Right?

410
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.610
What would you rather have my friend one here.
Oh fuck it.

411
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.050
Fucking 80 in the afterlife.
I'll fall.
Take the loss,

412
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:56.270
I'll take the fucking laws.
Um,

413
00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:02.120
anyways,
uh,
I'll tell you,

414
00:25:02.121 --> 00:25:06.280
I'll tell you Sunday or it's going to be a rough one.
Everybody,
I dunno,
you know,

415
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.290
every time the patriots go,
everybody wants to fucking patriots,

416
00:25:09.291 --> 00:25:11.690
they're going to win and they give no fucking,

417
00:25:11.691 --> 00:25:14.680
I mean the sports media does and the,

418
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:19.610
and the average mouth breathing moron gives no respect to the other fucking team

419
00:25:19.611 --> 00:25:23.510
as if they didn't walk through a whole fucking wall of fire to get what the hell

420
00:25:23.511 --> 00:25:23.990
they're at.

421
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:28.520
I'll tell you what scares me the most about the uh,

422
00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:32.720
the eagles other than their defense is their running game.

423
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:39.280
That's what scares me and I am deathly afraid of that in the second half if they

424
00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:43.040
sort of established it and they start chewing up the clock and start wearing

425
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:48.041
down our front for like Darren Sproles has like fucking video game speed.

426
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:55.660
I mean he is literally like a game changer level back and then they got Lou

427
00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.720
blunt,
which you know,
you don't need to tell a patriots fan about how fucking,

428
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.360
you know,
clutch that guy is.

429
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:07.940
And Nick falls is not a,
is not a backup quarterback.

430
00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:12.941
He said starting quarterback that lost his job and then stepped back in and made

431
00:26:13.641 --> 00:26:17.660
it look like,
why the fuck did you ever put me on the bench?

432
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.630
Um,
I think it's going to be a,
a,
a really,

433
00:26:23.631 --> 00:26:27.680
really close game.
And you know,
it's funny,
people are just like too,

434
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:28.940
what's it like?
You know,
your teams,

435
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:33.170
it and almost every year it must be like fucking no big deal to you.

436
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.660
It's always a big deal.

437
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.710
And anybody who's team has been in the Superbowl,

438
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.200
you die a thousand fucking deaths.

439
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.240
Even your team wins if your team loses,

440
00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:51.560
you just have to fucking do.
You just can't watch ESPN or any,

441
00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:56.700
any sports talk for a fucking week because it's going to kill you if you really

442
00:26:57.071 --> 00:26:59.080
care and your offense.
So this is the funny thing.

443
00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:02.410
I'm doing Conan O'brien the day after the Superbowl.

444
00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.820
So that's either going to be,
you know,

445
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:12.510
me being elated or our fucking just sitting there devastated,

446
00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:14.883
you know?

447
00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.713
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

448
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:20.950
<v 0>Superbowl losses are fucking devastating.
And you know,
it's funny,</v>

449
00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.770
I've gone to two Superbowls.
I went to the,

450
00:27:23.771 --> 00:27:26.770
when the Patriots lost a Brett Farve,

451
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.690
I was there when Brett Farve to that first touchdown pass and took his helmet

452
00:27:31.691 --> 00:27:35.470
off and ran down the field going,
oh,
you know,

453
00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.440
as his agent rubbed his greedy hands together.
Now Brian,

454
00:27:39.441 --> 00:27:40.560
when you score a touchdown,

455
00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:45.310
take your helmet off so the whole world can see what an all American guy you
are.

456
00:27:45.311 --> 00:27:50.050
We'll get you the Wheaties box.
Right?
That was the game within the fucking game.

457
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:55.300
Um,
and I remember walking out of the Super Dome,
you know,

458
00:27:55.301 --> 00:27:59.930
having spent all that fucking money,
you know,

459
00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.520
going back to your hotel room,
you're in New Orleans,

460
00:28:04.521 --> 00:28:08.060
everybody's having a good time and you're fucking walking away like Charlie

461
00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.970
Brown,
especially me with my big head.
Right?

462
00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.110
And then you got to go to the airport the next day and just fly back quietly

463
00:28:17.111 --> 00:28:20.920
with all fans from your team,
you know,

464
00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.830
and you just see another person also wearing this same team had,

465
00:28:23.831 --> 00:28:27.220
is she shows that just lost.
He just kind of look at each other,
you know,

466
00:28:27.221 --> 00:28:29.100
put your eyebrows up.
Amy had a good season,

467
00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.520
fucking brutal.

468
00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.570
And then I also went to the patriots versus Saint Louis Rams,

469
00:28:37.571 --> 00:28:40.240
the greatest show on turf.
Um,

470
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.570
and when we won,

471
00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:49.900
and I got to feel that feeling like floating out of the stadium,

472
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:54.730
hugging complete strangers with the same,
you know,
it's,
it's unreal.

473
00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:59.350
The level of emotion on that day is going to be crazy.
So,
um,

474
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.870
I,
you know what my feeling is for the game.
I'm just nervous.
I'm just nervous.

475
00:29:04.871 --> 00:29:07.360
Like this is going to be,
I think it's going to be another class.

476
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.820
This is nothing to all these fucking assholes,
you know,
go to a full conclude.

477
00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.180
You flip the Patriots.

478
00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.480
It's like the Patriots have probably been in arguably seven of the top 10 super

479
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:25.300
bowls of all time.
Every one of them has been like a heart stopper,

480
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:30.250
right?
Other than the bears.
One stunk.
The fucking,

481
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:33.400
um,
green bay packers one was,

482
00:29:33.401 --> 00:29:36.160
was great until the opening kickoff,

483
00:29:36.161 --> 00:29:40.990
I believe of the second half when that dude from Michigan ran it back.
Um,

484
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.950
but the fucking patriots ramp verse Ceramides when that game happened,

485
00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:48.410
they would like,
that was the most exciting Superbowls ball time.

486
00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.290
Then when we played the panthers with Jake Dalon,

487
00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.900
you know that that game was fucking unbelievable.

488
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:59.150
The Eagles game wasn't that good dynamic nad puked that kind of ruined that one.

489
00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:04.190
Right?
And then the fucking undefeated patriots,
spy gate,

490
00:30:04.191 --> 00:30:05.030
all of that shit.

491
00:30:05.031 --> 00:30:10.031
And then fucking the giants with the greatest fucking run on the road is a

492
00:30:10.431 --> 00:30:13.400
wildcard team wins the helmet,
catch all of that,

493
00:30:13.401 --> 00:30:17.690
even though we lost unbelievable fucking game.
Then we played the giants again.

494
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:22.160
All right,
Brady,
the Welker,
they dropped it.
Fucking heartbreaking.

495
00:30:22.161 --> 00:30:25.940
And then Eli once again makes it incredible paths.

496
00:30:25.941 --> 00:30:28.430
You can no longer say that he's got a horseshoe up his ass,

497
00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:31.910
cause he did it twice,
right?
Not Great one.

498
00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:38.120
Then the fucking eat the fucking hills of the Seahawks Ron Bird,

499
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.740
or write down on the goal line.
Marshawn Lynch,

500
00:30:42.741 --> 00:30:43.910
you know they're going to give it to him.

501
00:30:43.911 --> 00:30:47.630
How the fuck are the Patriots going to stop again?
They run a pick route.

502
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.010
<v 3>Okay.</v>

503
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:52.730
<v 0>Malcolm Butler jumps the route and out of fucking nowhere.</v>

504
00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:56.390
Game over.
And then last year,

505
00:30:56.391 --> 00:30:58.400
the greatest comeback in Superbowl history.

506
00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:02.630
So if you fucking hate the patriots because they're in the super bowl again,

507
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.560
do you just basically hate the patriots because they,
they won so many,

508
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:11.630
but there's no fucking way you hate those games.
What a better games.

509
00:31:11.631 --> 00:31:15.490
I before all of this bullshit went down.
The best one I ever saw.

510
00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.680
It's still one of my favorite ones of all time was the cowboys versus Steelers

511
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.513
Superbowl 14.

512
00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.223
<v 3>MMM.</v>

513
00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.550
<v 0>And I actually wonder if that had,
that,
that game has,</v>

514
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:33.290
that game has to have the most hall of famers in it.
Let's go through it.

515
00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:37.250
All right.
Franco Harris,
Terry Bradshaw,
Lynn Swann,

516
00:31:37.251 --> 00:31:39.650
John Stallworth,
Mike Webster.

517
00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.960
Lc Greenwood.
This is just the Steelers.

518
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:47.020
<v 3>Okay.</v>

519
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.250
<v 0>Mean Joe Greene.</v>

520
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.880
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

521
00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.830
<v 0>Jack Ham.
Jack Lambert.</v>

522
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:53.883
<v 3>Mel Blunt.</v>

523
00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.950
<v 0>That's 10.
There's no fucking,
this is probably,</v>

524
00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.150
I bet you'd be hard pressed to find that 10 on two teams.

525
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:07.060
Um,
then the cowboys,
Roger's star back.
Tony Doerr said

526
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.260
Randy White.

527
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:12.710
<v 3>Okay.</v>

528
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:15.560
<v 0>It's true.
Pearson in,
I gotta look up the cowboys that are in,</v>

529
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:21.550
well,
so they have,
oh,
bill,
he's getting old.

530
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.110
He's getting old at Harvey Martin or ed too tall.
Jones make it in.
I,

531
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:29.500
they must have one other guy,
five.
And then the two coaches,

532
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.170
chuck Noll and Tom Landry.
Um,

533
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.620
other than that drop in the end zone,
which may,

534
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:38.950
well that's the one thing that sucked about that game.
Bless his,

535
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.230
he's gotta be the Zika as bad as I building a,

536
00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:43.520
I actually lost money on that game.

537
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:48.521
I was in the fourth grade and I bet with this girl that I had a crush on I

538
00:32:49.731 --> 00:32:53.150
better a quarter or something like that,
like 50 cents or 75 cents.

539
00:32:53.151 --> 00:32:55.280
I can't remember if it was a big deal to make 75 cents.

540
00:32:55.281 --> 00:32:58.400
It was a big deal back then.
It was like three packs of football cards.

541
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:06.580
So anyways,
I think it's going to be a great game and um,

542
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:12.060
hopefully we win so I don't have to go on dress like a fucking sad clown on
Kona.

543
00:33:12.061 --> 00:33:17.060
But uh,
you know,
and I'm also doing something that I never do.

544
00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:19.760
I'm going to a Superbowl party,
but it's only because I'm a dad.

545
00:33:19.761 --> 00:33:24.260
Now we have this other great couple that,
you know,
they got the cutest kid ever.

546
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:27.500
Um,
so we're gonna go over there and watch the game,

547
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.170
chase the kids around and all that type of shit.
But,
uh,
you know,

548
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.620
I'm also going to record the game because if we win,

549
00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:38.440
I'm going to want to come home after my daughter goes to sleep and I'm going to

550
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.910
want to watch it again and a,

551
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:44.470
and possibly smoke a cigar.
Um,

552
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:48.500
I gotta give a shout out to somebody.
I never really named names on this,

553
00:33:48.501 --> 00:33:52.430
so I'm not going to say the name,
but last night I,
when I was,
you know,
before,

554
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:54.050
you know,
when I found out that the fucking,

555
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.810
we weren't gonna be able to fly back and I was like,
ah,
man,

556
00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.380
you gotta be kidding me,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Fucking la.

557
00:34:00.381 --> 00:34:02.750
Something always happens.
Um,

558
00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:04.080
<v 3>okay.</v>

559
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.920
<v 0>Somebody sent me back.
Uh,
he said,
hey,</v>

560
00:34:08.921 --> 00:34:10.900
somebody is sitting gave you this thing.
I was like,
oh my God,

561
00:34:10.901 --> 00:34:13.750
what the fuck is this?
I was this big bag,
my color.
Fuck,

562
00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:16.360
am I going to get this back?
I'm flying back in this little two seater,
right?

563
00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.510
Oh at that point I knew that I wasn't flying back and I looked in,

564
00:34:19.511 --> 00:34:24.310
it was a fucking box of Cuban cigars,
like a box of like,

565
00:34:24.311 --> 00:34:29.260
I don't like 25,
which would be,
uh,
you know,

566
00:34:29.261 --> 00:34:33.970
if you bought them individually,
that's like 1000 bucks.
So I was like,

567
00:34:33.971 --> 00:34:35.320
Holy Shit,
what the fuck is this guy?

568
00:34:35.321 --> 00:34:38.890
So immediately I'm thinking it's just like some fucking oil man,
you know,

569
00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.600
some evil,
fucking psycho,
whatever.

570
00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:45.630
And then there's this card in there and I opened it up and this is big long

571
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.680
letter in there.
I'm like,
Oh God,
this is this.

572
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.080
Some going to be some crazy person because that's how the world is.

573
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.710
And it was the nicest fucking letter I think I've ever gotten.

574
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:56.680
This person had just mentioned that they

575
00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.280
had gotten into a motorcycle accident,

576
00:35:00.281 --> 00:35:05.281
lost their leg and was going through this big depression and um,

577
00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.493
you know,

578
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:14.890
a listened to my comedy and whatever the f Dick joke or what I was doing helped

579
00:35:14.891 --> 00:35:18.750
them get through it and then he shows up with this giant fucking boxes,
cigars.

580
00:35:18.751 --> 00:35:19.584
So I really want to die.

581
00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:24.230
I ended up having somebody run out to make sure that I could say thank you to

582
00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:28.970
the person took pictures and everything.
Fucking really,
you know,
you mean,

583
00:35:28.971 --> 00:35:31.550
you know,
it's,
you know,
what usually happens to you at the end of the show?

584
00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.950
All the cool people go home because they're cool.

585
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.240
And then some either some drunk lunatic,

586
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.060
which I always got a spot for drunk lunatic,
you know,

587
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.450
God knows I've been that guy and usually their heart's in the right place,

588
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:47.280
but it's usually some fucking psycho shows up.

589
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:52.590
Oh look who's here now.
I was talking about what,
uh,

590
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:56.700
you know,
just somebody who really wrote a really nice letter and,
you know,

591
00:35:56.701 --> 00:35:57.890
not somebody else sell sucks.

592
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.860
Send me some pretty cool to give me a fucking led Zeppelin album with a picture

593
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:04.860
frame to frame it.
I'm not going to frame it,
I'm going to fucking listen to it.

594
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:09.000
Um,
but I just want to thank that person for,
um,
you know,

595
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.300
let me know that my comedy did affect him that way because,
you know,

596
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:15.630
you go on the road,
you're out there.
It's a weird time.

597
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:20.310
Everybody's overly sensitive.
It's nice to get some sort of positive feedback.
Um,

598
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:22.050
Nia,

599

I finally got a splitter.
You know,

607
00:36:52.741 --> 00:36:57.610
Todd rex was the last fucking person that I love on this podcast and I was going

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:16.530
He grabbed the microphone.
Hello.
There we go.
Look at that.

612
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:21.390
Look at that modern technology.
Oh Shit.

613
00:37:21.391 --> 00:37:25.320
It's 37 minutes.
Then you coming in right at the end.
Who Do you like in the,

614
00:37:25.321 --> 00:37:30.110
in the Superbowl,
the New England patriots or the Philadelphia Eagles patrons.

615
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.340
Who is going to be,
it's going to be an unbelievable game.

616
00:37:32.341 --> 00:37:35.700
Boston got over it for the paycheck.
You got to root for the Patriots.
Yeah.

617
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.450
Tom's going for number six,
the six super bowl ring.
Yup.

618
00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.680
Great.
That's great.
Yeah.
Really looking forward to the,
what do you feel that,

619
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:49.200
what do you feel like some of the keys to the looking forward to that some of

620
00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:50.100
the keys to the game?

621
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:56.040
<v 1>Well,
I think what we need is a strong defense and you know,</v>

622
00:37:56.110 --> 00:38:00.000
on the other end we need a good office as well.
And you know,

623
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.810
we just got to catch that ball and just get it into the end zone.

624
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:08.490
You know what I mean?
And when it,
it's time to kick that bill goal,

625
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.710
you just got to kick it over the goal.

626
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:14.040
<v 0>I'll be the goal.
I mean,
that's what you gotta do.
Right.
You know what I mean?</v>

627
00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:15.660
Then you gotta be real aggressive.
You know what I mean?

628
00:38:15.661 --> 00:38:18.400
You got to keep the team from [inaudible]

629
00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.830
<v 1>tackling the guy with the ball running</v>

630
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.050
<v 0>to try to score a touchdown.
Right.</v>

631
00:38:25.051 --> 00:38:27.960
And stop those guys who were trying to stop your a guy is what?
I mean,

632
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.490
you got to stop those guys from stopping your guy.

633
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.570
And what do you think the Patriots game plan is going to be against the eagles

634
00:38:33.571 --> 00:38:34.030
running game?

635
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.760
<v 1>Oh my God.
It's going to be,</v>

636
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.790
<v 0>it's going to be really focused.
It's going to be like,
oh,
like get it man.</v>

637
00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.380
Just get in there and you know,
don't take any shit.

638
00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:53.920
Let them score on the man.

639
00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:00.160
Oh God.
You know,
it's funny.

640
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:04.730
That's what a lot of Superbowl analysis sounds after those poor bastards after

641
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:07.490
two fucking weeks.
That's like all they got.
Like,
yeah.

642
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:10.400
Just you got to score points.
I got nothing.

643
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.530
How much longer do we got to sit here?
All right.

644
00:39:14.531 --> 00:39:17.930
Well one of,
one of the,
uh,
people came out to the show last night.

645
00:39:17.931 --> 00:39:21.820
It was nice not to get me a box of Cuban cigars.
Wow.
Box,

646
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:26.900
actual Cuban cigars from Cuba,

647
00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:29.830

I'm going to stare at,

648
00:39:29.831 --> 00:39:32.040
I'm going to let him get all dried out.
Oh,
you know what?

649
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:34.390
Chop them up and put them in my keynote.
We should bring one,

650
00:39:34.391 --> 00:39:37.120
two a on Sunday to the games.
I absolutely am.

651
00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:41.200
I hope I'm going to be able to light it up like read Arabic and the fucking

652
00:39:41.201 --> 00:39:45.610
fourth quarter.
Absolutely.
Light it up.
Light it up.
Make it happen,
you know,

653
00:39:45.611 --> 00:39:49.930
and don't take any shit.
Okay.
Who was the other why?
The way everybody,

654
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:54.530

Huh?

655
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:58.120
How great were you?
You're an amazing actor.
You're playing yourself,

656
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.330
but you're a really good actor so it's not acting when you're playing yourself.

657
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:05.800
Oh,
thank you.
That's just existing.
Yeah,
being the asshole you are.

658
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.710
Well you know I haven't watched it yet.
I'm going to,

659
00:40:08.711 --> 00:40:11.050
I gotta sit down and check it out.
It's really good.

660
00:40:11.051 --> 00:40:13.300
It's not anything that'll make you be like,
Oh God,

661
00:40:13.301 --> 00:40:17.230
what did I do that like every moment it's very pure and natural,

662
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.230
so I thought you were right.

663
00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:21.390
There's something just not natural about watching yourself.
No.

664
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:25.050
You should never see the back of your head while you're talking.
Yeah.

665
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.000
It's like am I am having like a near death experience right now?

666
00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.430
We see even worse you're like,
oh my God,
this is what other people see.
Yeah.

667
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.940
I need to face people more cause you see your face like brushing your teeth,

668
00:40:36.941 --> 00:40:37.721
you see your face.

669
00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:40.270
I don't know if you've ever noticed that he faces right there in the middle of

670
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:42.390
the mirror India.
I don't know if you ever notice that.
Yes it is.

671
00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:47.050
I'm always looking at my face.
Always look on my face like moisturizing.

672
00:40:47.051 --> 00:40:51.640
I can share a no,
but it was,
it was a great experience,

673
00:40:51.641 --> 00:40:54.430
so thank you.
Thank you.
Before without you,

674
00:40:54.431 --> 00:40:57.570
I would not have been able to be on the show.
Thank you for that.

675
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.121
You would think that I'm,

676
00:40:58.121 --> 00:41:01.090
maybe I am holding back your career and without me you could have gone like

677
00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:04.000
Oprah.
Right?
Just had a cocker Spaniel that you love.

678
00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:08.530
You got to the top of the mountain.
She still has a guy by her side,

679
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:14.320
but I don't know.
I don't,
I didn't know that Steadman.

680
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.460
Oh that's right.
Yeah.
Is he the guy used to dance with the umbrella with puffy.

681
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:23.170
Is that him?
What was that guy's name?
That is Fonzworth Bentley.

682
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:27.100
Is that Steadman son?
It should be,
if he named Steadman,

683
00:41:27.101 --> 00:41:29.770
your son should be called Fonzworth.
Now that's,
no,

684
00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:34.190
I don't think his name was actually pleased that late,
but now he's like,

685
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:39.680
<v 1>I don't know exactly what he does.
He wouldn't,
he would like vogue.
Well,</v>

686
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:41.200
we're holding an umbrella.
He wasn't

687
00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:48.260
now
you're all over the place right now,

688
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:50.150
but the references now he uh,

689
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:54.350
he's like a guy that like what's it all together?

690
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:56.920
He's like to me undies of umbrellas.

691
00:41:56.921 --> 00:41:58.750
And then he started his own line of umbrellas.
Yeah,

692
00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.620
but he's like connected to like,

693
00:42:00.621 --> 00:42:03.200
everybody in the music industry is a part of like,

694

Kanye is creative team somehow.
I don't know.

695
00:42:05.691 --> 00:42:08.480
I just feel like he's the guy that makes shit happen.

696
00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.000
He's not the umbrella guy anymore.
He's like,

697
00:42:11.001 --> 00:42:14.240
what do you think he needs to get his keys to the game this Sunday?

698
00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:20.030
What do you mean he just wants to keep sustaining?
He's just got to get in there.

699
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.010
I said Kiddie Shit.

700
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:29.300
I think you have a second career as a motivational speaker.
I think so.

titty hanging out and she's got her hair up so you know she's ready to go to

707
00:42:52.811 --> 00:42:56.620
work.
Full makeup and then cookie cutter,
like distressed jeans.

708
00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:01.030
That's how she cooks in the kitchen.
You got to have your lipstick on,
right?

709
00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:04.540
It's a cover of a book.
You have to look good.
I know.
It's just,

710
00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.610
I love how she looks,

711
00:43:06.611 --> 00:43:10.390
but that's the thing that makes all like the fatties and feminists and all that

712
00:43:10.391 --> 00:43:14.710
get upset.
Like,
Oh,
don't get upset.
How am I supposed to live up to this?

713
00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:19.750
Oh God,
feminist.
Don't get upset at Chrissy.
Teagan's the real ones right now.
No,

714
00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:22.390
the real ones don't know.
What do you mean the real ones?

715
00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:25.990
Well isn't like every scene has like the posers and then they have the real
ones,

716
00:43:25.991 --> 00:43:29.560
right?
No,
the problem is you don't know what feminism is.
I don't.

717
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.433
<v 1>You just think</v>

718
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:35.900
you just think anything regarding women is like feminism and you're like,
yeah,

719
00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.150
feminists hate that and you're like,
you don't know.

720
00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.093
<v 0>Okay,
well then women,</v>

721
00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.060
a lot of a lot of women on social media don't like that because it creates an

722
00:43:43.061 --> 00:43:46.240
impossible image to live up to,
which I think is one of the most self centered.

723
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:50.340
Like I don't look at fucking Brad Pitt in fight club.
It'd be like really Brad,

724
00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.800
that's just creating a positive image for me to live up to like how arrogant

725
00:43:53.801 --> 00:43:54.634
would I have to be

726
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:58.970
<v 1>even you're saying that because that's exactly what fight club is about is about</v>

727
00:43:58.971 --> 00:44:00.200
what it's about.

728
00:44:00.201 --> 00:44:05.201
That guy and Edward Norton's character being like kind of like searching for his

729
00:44:05.721 --> 00:44:09.770
identity and feeling like he has to find his identity through consumption

730
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.080
through looking a certain way.

731
00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:14.840
Remember that scene on the bus when him and Brad Pitt are like looking at the

732
00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:18.110
ads,
like sort of like the Calvin Klein male underwear ads and they were like,

733
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:19.880
is that what a man is supposed to look like?

734
00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.260
That's what that whole movie is essentially about.

735
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.860
I have no recollection of that.
I just remember when he and his,

736
00:44:24.861 --> 00:44:29.600
his like his mind gets fractured in such a way that he creates this alternative

737
00:44:29.601 --> 00:44:32.100
identity,
which is Brad that looks

738
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.790
<v 0>like Brad Pitt that has the body like Brad Pitt that like fucks like Brad Pitt</v>

739
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.140
because he's thinking that this is what it means to be a man and also has this

740
00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:42.900
like anarchist kind of like mentality,

741
00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.510
a bunch the shit out of each other in a basement.

742
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:49.440
Did you miss that whole theme of the movie?
That's the old people of the movie?

743
00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:55.410
No,
I just remember,
oh look,
good meatloaf.
When he took his shirt off,
I was like,

744
00:44:55.411 --> 00:44:59.570
Jesus Christ the bitch tits.
That's what they called it.
Yeah.

745
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:04.500
That movie is amazing.
I only saw one time.
Yeah.

746
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:09.790
But I never looked at Brad Pitt and thought like,
oh,
I gotta get an shit though.

747
00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:14.310
Like,
like I'm actually competing with them.
I'm not to compete with somebody,

748
00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:17.250
they have to be within my Mike site.
You know what I mean?

749
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:21.570
When you're that far over the fucking horizon.
Yeah,
forget they don't even exist.

750
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:26.520
There was like when I math class and then fucking my senior year,

751
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:30.750
within two fucking weeks that the teacher was just over the horizon.

752
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:35.930
And I remember the year before I flunked math and had to go to summer school and

753
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:40.920
two weeks in my senior year,
I was just like,
oh this again.

754
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:44.250
Last year I actually kept going back for extra help,

755
00:45:44.251 --> 00:45:49.251
like this was going to change something and I just quit by tapped out like two,

756
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:53.490
like in September had a boy,
I gotta tell you,

757
00:45:53.491 --> 00:45:55.950
it was one of the most fun classes I ever had.

758
00:45:56.250 --> 00:46:01.140
I used to get like eight and 11 s on tests.
Like,
you know,

759
00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:04.740
what'd you get?
I got an 85 I would get like single digits.

760
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.570
Oh,
I was,

761
00:46:06.571 --> 00:46:09.900
I thought you were talking about some new way of like great things and like what

762
00:46:09.901 --> 00:46:12.000
are eight like hundred percent you got an a,

763
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.510
I got the smart goal in front of me would get a hundred and I would get an

764
00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:17.260
lately in a it's,
yeah.

765
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.910
And that was a thing and me and my other buddy went to summer school the year

766
00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:23.940
before we would,
we would get them back and we,
you know,

767
00:46:23.941 --> 00:46:25.520
he was like two rows away from me who,

768
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:29.400
and I would just hold them up as a good joke who could do worse and he'd hold up

769
00:46:29.401 --> 00:46:31.860
like an 11 and I would laugh when I'd be like,

770
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:36.420
and that it hold up an eight and he would have his hand over his mouth frying.

771
00:46:36.421 --> 00:46:41.040
Fucking laughing.
That's a cool memory.
Excellent.
Oh,
it's fucking liberating.

772
00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.680
Not giving a fuck,
you know,
it's just like if,
yeah,

773
00:46:43.681 --> 00:46:45.480
I cared the year before I cared.

774
00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:50.610
I had headaches and shit and I'd be fucking trying to pass.
It was,
yeah,
it was,

775
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:54.570
it was like a,
what's the lesson in this staff care?
No.
The lesson is,

776
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.010
is in order to be successful,

777
00:46:56.011 --> 00:46:59.850
you have to know what you suck at so you don't waste any brain power trying.

778
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:03.390
You know,
like one time I saw this story about Lawrence Taylor,
right?

779
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.690
Phil Sims told this story.
He's a football player,

780
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.160
arguably the greatest linebacker of all time.
Black Guy,
right?
Of course,

781
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:14.790
of course,
change the game.
The great white line backers were in the 60s.

782
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.260
Crew cuts.
They look like,
you know,

783
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:20.180
they a great why angry cops because they were the only ones allowed to play.
No,

784
00:47:20.181 --> 00:47:22.040
no,
they weren't good.
Come on man.
This is,

785
00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:26.280
it's still bright white line backers like,
uh,
Chris Billman.

786
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:31.090
Uh,
yeah,
he's uh,
go out.
There was a guy,

787
00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:35.750
the bed or lacquer on the bears that Dab bears was,

788
00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:37.420
no,
he isn't.
Okay.
Keep going.

789
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.910
I don't click football cards and when I know that's gotta be a good,

790
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:45.150
it was at roided out blown a tick who spit in people's faces on the Broncos,

791
00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:51.200
have no idea who dislocated a former teammates elbow on Shannon Sharpe on a

792
00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:53.590
Monday night football.
I now forget that,
that he did that.
I was like,

793
00:47:53.591 --> 00:47:58.240
this guy is a fucking serial killer.
Shannon Shannon.
Oh,
is he?

794
00:47:58.241 --> 00:48:02.250
Um,
he smart?
No,
he's the one.
Uh,
I,

795
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:06.070
I tweeted at mile with that yet.
Yeah.

796
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:10.800
I don't know what that means with that.
Yay.
Hey Ma with that yet.
He went on a,

797
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:12.790
he was on there and he was celebrating something.

798
00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:16.810
So he took out a black and mile and he was like,
I'm on nine mile a day yet.

799
00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:21.640
Skip.
You're talking crazy scale.
That guy.
Yeah,
I guess so.

800
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.270
I remember you showing me that and I wanted,
then you explained to me in a row,

801
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:31.240
it was something about whatever he was smoking and Cognac.
It was like,
whoa.

802
00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:36.010
I like black people lost their fucking minds cause it's just a super,

803
00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:39.810
super black thing.
Super insight.
I get it.
That's like your uncle.

804
00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.220
He's like your uncle.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um,

805
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.760
where are we talking about white people's accomplishments?
Boring.

806
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:49.240
When you're talking about this entire monuments made of all of our

807
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:52.270
accomplishments,
this is entire cities about all the things we've achieved.

808
00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:55.660
Congratulations.
You know,
our version of what happened

809
00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.850
is chiseled into those monuments now.
But nobody thinks you're cool.

810
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:03.910
Here's the thing,
what is not cool about flying?

811
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.490
You don't like cars?

812
00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:12.580
I know we're not moonwalking but I mean it's kind of cool to go from La to New

813
00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.690
York and six hours,
isn't it?

814
00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.610
We fake the lunar landing and that's some dope shit,
isn't it?

815
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:20.860
We've got to have some sort of street cred.

816
00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:28.600
Wait,
Tom Brady is white and he is a,
he is white.
He is a quarterback though.

817
00:49:28.601 --> 00:49:31.390
He's on a linebacker,
right?
He's a quarterback.

818
00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:35.260
A linebacker is a really big like refrigerator Perry.
Nope.

819
00:49:35.261 --> 00:49:38.670
He was a defensive lineman.
He's the InSHAPE version.
Like,

820
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:42.280
like a lot of down lineman are a little bit fat.
And then the linebackers,

821
00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:46.450
linebackers have built like the hulk.
Um,
Odell Beckham.
What,

822
00:49:46.451 --> 00:49:50.230
what position does he play?
He's a wide receiver.
Okay.

823
00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:55.390
I'm just trying to think of,
there's a lot of good mob,

824
00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:01.270
white wide receivers of come back.
Okay.
Yup.
Well good.

825
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:06.430
He goes,
get in there.
All right.

826
00:50:06.431 --> 00:50:10.990
I gotta get on with my day here.
Um,
and I gotta tell you,
it's one of my most,

827
00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:14.470
my most fun acting gigs ever.
That it's,
I got to be on screen with deal.

828
00:50:14.471 --> 00:50:17.980
How awesome is said,
right?
We're like Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman,

829
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:20.800
except to a much lesser degree.

830
00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:23.800
I don't think Mann's Chinese theater is going to be calling this anytime soon.

831
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.770
Hey listen,
pay.
Never know.
You never know what's going to happen.
I'm,

832
00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:30.820
I will be able to watch that.
Years later it'd be like,
you know,
it'd be like,

833
00:50:30.821 --> 00:50:33.100
why didn't you use me in it?
It will be like,
well,

834
00:50:33.101 --> 00:50:36.580
cause you weren't a twin and you're only allowed to work three hours at a time.

835
00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:41.110
That's why it,
that's why.
There you go.
Alright,
that's the podcast.

836
00:50:41.111 --> 00:50:44.500
Everybody enjoy the super bowl.
Uh,

837
00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:49.460
congratulations to base both franchises,
but getting there.
Yeah.
Okay.

838
00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:53.950
It's going to break my fucking heart if the Patriots lose,

839
00:50:53.951 --> 00:50:54.850
but I will tell you this,

840
00:50:54.851 --> 00:50:59.440
I will actually be happy on another level because the eagles and never won one

841
00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:02.490
and those,
you know,
did you eat?
There's a fucking eagles fan crying.

842
00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.820
When Carson Wentz went down,

843
00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:08.560
literally called a fucking a sports talk show,

844
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.180
got on the phone and started crying.
When they're starting quarterback without,

845
00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:15.400
he's like,
Yo,
I mean,
whether you're never going to work out for us.

846
00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:18.910
And the dude was all weirded out go and you're crying,
crying.

847
00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:23.050
And then niche sports fans are very,
but you guys are super passionate.

848
00:51:23.051 --> 00:51:27.920
Like you're crazy.
Like you're a little scary.
It's all we have for the most part.

849
00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:31.960
We're not good looking.
Our personal lives are not where we want them to be.

850
00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:36.520
We don't have the job that we want.
It's all we have.
Oh God.

851
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.140
And then nothing.

852
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:43.200
What makes your fucking year is to predict something and it actually happens.

853
00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.410
And then you just want people to remember and you just,

854
00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:52.230
you just walking around the sports bra.
I said,
it's sad and you know,

855
00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.510
you look like,
remember that dude,

856
00:51:53.511 --> 00:51:58.511
he gets stabbed in the beginning of fucking scar face walking around that tent

857
00:51:58.991 --> 00:52:01.520
city.
That that's what you look like.
You just holding your Geico,

858
00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:07.480
don't I matter anybody?
Um,
all right,

859
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:11.290
that's it.
That's the podcast.
Have a great weekend.

860
00:52:11.291 --> 00:52:13.430
Enjoy the Superbowl ad.

861
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:19.010
<v 5>Hopefully the Patriots get a win.
Um,
I dunno.
We'll see.</v>

862
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:22.240
I am definitely,
I think it's going to be a really close gut wrenching game.

863
00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:27.050
All right.
That's my prediction.
And then I'll be like,
I said it all right.
See Ya.

864
00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:46.923
Well,
can

865
00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:06.110
I don't

866
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.863
have

867
00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.613
to

868
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:25.620
talk to

869
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.380
mentor.

870
00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.990
<v 4>I was watching one of those 30 for 30.</v>

871
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:46.743
Yeah.

872
00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:52.870
<v 0>MMM.
And they did this whole thing on,
on athletes going broke.</v>

873
00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.870
It was really bad.
There's a ton of people who've gone broke.

874
00:53:55.871 --> 00:53:58.840
Most of them didn't want to do the documentary.
Like why would you,

875
00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:01.860
you know what I mean?
Hey,

876
00:54:01.861 --> 00:54:05.790
you want to talk about how you completely fucking blew it?
No,
I don't.
I don't,

877
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.280
I never resent the fact that the end of your documentary,

878
00:54:08.281 --> 00:54:11.010
you're going to be running a list with my name on it.
You know,

879
00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:13.810
that's what they had is the end of it.
Yeah.
But,
um,

880
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.430
I was watching it and I felt bad for people,

881
00:54:17.431 --> 00:54:22.431
but after a while it was just the same fucking story over and over again.

882
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.830
<v 4>Then I went on a splurge.</v>

883
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:31.560
The first thing I bought for myself was a Cadillac escalades and I want to

884
00:54:31.561 --> 00:54:35.080
earrings that,
you know,
we're $30,000 I always wanted to portray

885
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:40.990
<v 0>and it's as much as I want to say that if I was 21 years old and he gave me $1</v>

886
00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:48.050
million that I would probably fuck it up too.
I just don't think I would,

887
00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:52.880
you know,
I had a lot of these guys,

888
00:54:52.881 --> 00:54:56.480
you know I got a check for $55,000 and I saw hummer.

889
00:54:56.481 --> 00:55:01.481
I had to get it talk to the guy down to $49,000 and it's like if you just got a

890
00:55:02.101 --> 00:55:07.100
check for 55 fucking grand after paying all the people in your life,

891
00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:12.590
your agent,
whoever else she got,
where else has taken a g,

892
00:55:12.591 --> 00:55:15.170
a lawyer,
whoever taze else takes a chunk out of that check,

893
00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:16.540
whatever's left on it,

894
00:55:16.541 --> 00:55:19.760
that the government's going to come in and take a 40 40% where if you get a

895
00:55:19.761 --> 00:55:22.580
check for 55 grand,
I mean what,
what do you go left 20 grand?

896
00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:27.060
And he just went out and bought a $50,000 Hama.
I Dunno.
But anyways,

897
00:55:27.061 --> 00:55:28.710
the point I wanted to make was at the end of it,

898
00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:31.650
you have to show and all these people going through this hell,

899
00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:36.660
they have this guy that who's supposed to be evidently some sort of a financial

900
00:55:36.661 --> 00:55:41.610
advisor and in the end they were talking about Lebron James going eat is going

901
00:55:41.611 --> 00:55:42.250
to be,

902
00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:47.250
he has a potential be other than tiger woods pre divorce,

903
00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:52.030
um,
a billionaire athlete.
Look at the Brown.

904
00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:55.710
<v 4>Well that's an opportunity via being their athletes tog side in this,</v>

905
00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:59.770
<v 0>you make it like how exciting is that?
And they go,
what,</v>

906
00:55:59.771 --> 00:56:01.390
what would your advice be to this,

907
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:06.520
to Lebron James on how to hang on to his billion dollars?
And the guy goes,

908
00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:10.980
he goes,
don't blow it.
Keep it simple.

909
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:13.650
Count your money.

910
00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:16.653
<v 4>What?
He said,</v>

911
00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:19.563
<v 0>okay,</v>

912
00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:23.590
<v 4>don't blow it.
Keep it simple.</v>

913
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.420
<v 3>Challenge and money.</v>

914
00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:30.780
<v 0>It might've been the dumbest thing I ever heard and I immediately,</v>

915
00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:36.050
I had no sympathy for anybody in the fucking documentary.

916
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:41.280
It's just like even like,
why is this guy on this document?

917
00:56:41.281 --> 00:56:46.230
Who the fuck is that guy?
That's the guy who manages money.
That's,
hey,

918
00:56:46.231 --> 00:56:50.760
I got $1 billion.
How do I hold onto this?
Where should I invest it?

919
00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:55.590
What do I do?
What advice do you got for me?
Oh,
it's simple.

920
00:56:55.650 --> 00:57:00.300
Don't blow it.
Keep it simple.
Count your money.
All right.

921
00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:03.390
Thanks a lot.
I'll be,
I'm outta here.

922
00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.970
Fucking ridiculous.

923
00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:07.490
<v 3>Okay.</v>

924
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:08.370
<v 0>Oh,
it was basically,</v>

925
00:57:08.371 --> 00:57:11.580
it was an hour and a half of listening to morons telling you what the fuck they

926
00:57:11.581 --> 00:57:13.680
bought with all their money and I don't know.

927
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:15.400
<v 3>Okay.</v>

928
00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.740
<v 0>I felt bad,
but there was another part.</v>

929
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:21.400
It was just one guy that I really felt bad for because,

930
00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:23.110
<v 3>okay.</v>

931
00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:25.520
<v 0>The,
it was the hurt that he had.</v>

932
00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:26.860
<v 3>Okay.</v>

933
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:27.690
<v 0>You know,</v>

934
00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:31.310
like Andre [inaudible] was on the thing and he's sitting there in his suit with

935
00:57:31.311 --> 00:57:35.860
sunglasses on mirrored sunglasses during the interview and just right there,

936
00:57:35.861 --> 00:57:38.860
it's like,
yeah,
dude,
you,
I'd give you another million if I had it.

937
00:57:38.861 --> 00:57:42.610
If I gave it to you,
you,
you,
you fucked that up.
Why?

938
00:57:42.611 --> 00:57:46.270
Because you're sending here in a shiny suit.
Was fucking sunglasses on.

939
00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:53.730
Well were like Michael Jackson at the award show.
Right.
So anyways,

940
00:57:53.731 --> 00:57:57.570
the one guy actually really bothered me was theirs.
If you ever watch it,

941
00:57:57.571 --> 00:57:59.220
it's 30 for 30 broke.

942
00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:05.570
There's a guy who's sitting there and he's just ever so slightly lean to one

943
00:58:05.941 --> 00:58:09.450
side.
And the just the,
the pain,

944
00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:12.900
uh,
in,
in his voice.

945
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.090
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

946
00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:18.210
<v 0>He's just,
just sitting there going,
ah,
I made a</v>

947
00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:23.810
$75 million in that career and that,

948
00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:26.883
<v 3>yeah.</v>

949
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:28.540
<v 0>Add me up.
Mercedes</v>

950
00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:34.110
<v 3>got a homo,
got me a boat.</v>

951
00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:38.010
<v 0>It's just sitting there looking down on his knee,
like playing with his pant leg,</v>

952
00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:41.850
a jet ski,
and

953
00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:52.240
<v 3>imagine
a couple of cars.</v>

954
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.390
I pretty much gave it away.

955
00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:04.293
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

956
00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:11.300
<v 0>And you just,
I had to look away.
It was fucking brutal.</v>

957
00:59:11.301 --> 00:59:14.270
But the rest of it was just a bunch of knuckleheads.

958
00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:15.980
<v 3>Okay.</v>

959
00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:19.460
<v 0>I felt bad for Bernie Kosar to cause burning coals,
you know,
I don't know.</v>

960
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:22.000
It seemed like his took his money.

961
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.060
<v 7>I don't know what the fuck was it?
I knew with my signing bonus,</v>

962
00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:30.120
she's paying off his mortgages and paying off the house and the cars and things

963
00:59:30.221 --> 00:59:34.820
of that nature.
But the A,
as I came to find out a little bit later,
the,
uh,

964
00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:39.680
the Cleveland browns also cut a contract for my father who got $1 million.

965
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:42.560
<v 0>It's,
it's a really,
it's a,
it's a great,</v>

966
00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:44.990
all the 30 for 30 [inaudible] are awesome.
This one is awesome,

967
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.290
but they just should have had a couple of,

968
00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:50.960
<v 3>okay.</v>

969
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:51.331
<v 0>They did,</v>

970
00:59:51.331 --> 00:59:54.140
you know something that's not true cause they had like four or five guys.

971
00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:57.380
There was only two people who really came off like morons,

972
00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:59.690
but they were just so,

973
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:03.800
they was such morons that I felt it tainted the whole thing.

974
01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:05.320
<v 3>Okay.</v>

975
01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.320
<v 0>Ah,
that is,
might've been the dumbest thing I ever heard.</v>

976
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:13.580
<v 7>What is your advice?
Don't blow the sample chapter.</v>

977
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:19.420
<v 0>All right.
I'm sorry.
What was that even remotely fucking interesting.</v>

978
01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:23.560
I love watching those 30 for 30 is I got to watch the Bo Jackson one.
Um,

979
01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:26.180
there was just something about that like,
you know,
for as,

980
01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:30.680
as much as they showed the amount of people that went broke,

981
01:00:30.681 --> 01:00:35.681
there's been so many more people in the league that didn't go broke.

982
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:37.350
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

983
01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:41.640
<v 0>So really what you just showing us select group of Morons.</v>

984
01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:43.060
<v 3>Okay.</v>

985
01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:43.451
<v 0>You know,</v>

986
01:00:43.451 --> 01:00:47.050
who are going out and buying a corvette and sticking a fucking hot tub in the

987
01:00:47.051 --> 01:00:52.030
back of it.
You know,
living week to week on paychecks.

988
01:00:52.031 --> 01:00:54.520
I mean,
I just don't think that most people are doing that.

989
01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.660
I would really think that if,
if I was barely on the team,

990
01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:02.380
I would be saving every dime.
I know I would.

991
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:03.840
<v 3>Okay.</v>

992
01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.190
<v 0>I've done that.
This business,
I've never fucking,</v>

993
01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:07.640
<v 3>okay.</v>

994
01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:11.420
<v 0>You know,
it's common if you're in any sort of entertainment</v>

995
01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:43.503
<v 5>next</v>

996
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:48.520
to.
