00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:14.960
Everybody.
Do you have eyes?
Did they not work as well as they should?

20
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.040
Do you like spending less money on things more than more money on things?

21
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.170
Do you know what the Internet is?

22
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.320
If you answered yes to any or all these questions,

23
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.880
then visit Hubble contacts.com uh,

24
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.940

Choose one or two.
All right.

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:33.530

26
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.250
Talk about how you've been wearing huddled contacts for the past 25 years.

27
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:41.120
I have it before I didn't see things and now I see I didn't wear those fucking

28
00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:44.140
things.
I don't have contacts.

29
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.780
I have no idea.
I don't know what they're saying.

30
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:53.530
These guys make contact lenses and they're,
they're fucking great.
How was that?

31
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.693
With humble,

32
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.050
you'll get a fresh pair of lenses for every single day for less than 60,

33
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.520
for less.
60 contacts for 33 bucks.
Do the math.

34
00:02:03.521 --> 00:02:07.810
That's barely a dollar a day.
This is way more affordable than other brands.

a long time waiting,

47
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.340
long time in the coming for whatever web.
A fucking reason.

48
00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:53.710
We've hung out a million times.
We never thought to do a podcast.

49
00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:57.440
I didn't want to infringe on the man's talents.
Um,

50
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.710
please welcome Mr. Rhodes.
Yay.
Yay for me.

51
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.620
What's up brother?
How are you brother?
I'm doing good man.
I'm so sad.

52
00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:08.890
You're on the podcast.
You're one of the,

53
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.380
one of the best comic side know I've known you for like,

54
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.220
I know I've known you for like 20,
I don't know how many years.

55
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.050
All the way back in La.

56
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.830
And I would say I was living in New York like 98 99 was that it?

57
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.680
I think,
yeah,
maybe that was what it was.

58
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.980
I thought I met you in like 95 or 96 out here in la who's out here

59
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.040
briefly.
You probably walked by with,

60
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:36.910
you're a romantic novel hair that you had back the romance novel haircut.

61
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.830
I meet with my red Afro Two hacks passing in the night.
Right.

62
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.090
Trying to get better.
And then,
yeah.

63
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.940
And then I think at first time I like officially kind of met you and was hanging

64
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:48.970
out back when we both had folic strength.
Yes.

65
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.470
And I was very excited that you knew who I was because I had seen you at eating

66
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:58.030
it of all places,
which is why I became a huge fan of your stand up.

67
00:03:58.031 --> 00:03:59.050
I've told you this story before.

68
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:01.870
We're going to tell the listeners where you were,
uh,

69
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.200
you were talking about some sort of extra curricular activity that you were

70
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:08.710
doing.
I had done mushrooms in Amsterdam in Vondelpark.
Yes.

71
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.870
And I just remember you were describing the whole fucking trip of it and I just

72
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:16.120
remember you were just at one point you were just like,

73
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:21.121
I was running through the grass summit tippy toes and I was just something about

74
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:23.930
that was like,
you know,
there's,

75
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.370
with alcohol there's nothing worse than just seeing somebody who's like

76
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:30.760
completely fucked up.
But like with mushrooms,

77
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.750
there's like a oneness with the world where you literally watching adult become

78
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:37.060
a child or something.
I just thought you'd described it.

79
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:38.050
I've never taken mushrooms,

80
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:42.030
but like from what I've seen when I've seen people tripping and I was there
with,

81
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:45.700
with Nia way back in the day when we were still boyfriend girlfriend and we

82
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:47.980
would die in laughing and that became like,
you know,
like one of the,

83
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.320
a catch phrase for us,

84
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.080
we would just be walking around the apartment and one would be in the other room

85
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:56.590
and we just,
we just yelled at out,
we're not do the grass on my tippy toes.

86
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.850
We both would just start laughing.

87
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.540
That's the greatest compliment you could get when like,
uh,
uh,

88
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.170
a joke or a sentence from a joke becomes part of somebody's vernacular,
you know?

89
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.050
Oh yeah.
There's been a few,
there's the Dave Chappelle,

90
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.740
Dave Chappelle had a bit about,
uh,
how,
you know,

91
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.040
he likes it and checking it and he's a black dude.

92
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.310
So there's that weird sort of stereotype,
but he's like,
but,
but I like it.

93
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.360
He goes,
but I won't eat it in public because he goes,

94
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:26.920
I'm afraid there'll be some white people around going,
look at him.
He loves it.

95
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.990
So just like the encyclopedia says,
it wasn't that the last line of that bit.

96
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.200
I don't remember,
but I just submit it to this day.

97
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.140
I know I can't eat without thinking to that line.
Well,

98
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:41.740
to this day when me and Nia are hanging out,
uh Oh,

99
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.460
if we're eating food and if she go as a taste,
I go,
oh,
that's good.
I like it.

100
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.120
And she'd just go look at him.
He loves it.
But like,
it just,
it's just,

101
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:53.110
there was a few of those.
Yeah.
Now I got to go through all of them.

102
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:54.100
Sarah Silverman.

103
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.700
Sarah Silverman said something about how she always Prac bought condoms or

104
00:05:58.701 --> 00:05:59.360
something.
I forget.

105
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.720
I just remember that was the punchline was cause I do a lot of fucking,

106
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.860
Neil was watching that.

107
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.430
We're in this little one bedroom apartment in is everything is in New York

108
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:13.760
little and I was shaving in the other room and I just heard that I didn't even

109
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:14.541
believe we're here.
The setup,

110
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.360
which probably why I can't remember it by just bursted out laughing while I was

111
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:22.310
shaving.
So,
um,
anyway,
you pardon my mount Rushmore of lines that just never,

112
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.480
it never,
it just never left my,
my,
my,
my head.
I don't know why.
So.

113
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.980
And furthermore other,
you know,
I would say either you or Doug,
Stan hope

114
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.380
<v 2>have probably put the most like</v>

115
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.210
<v 1>stand up miles on the odometer as far as the places that,
that you've played,</v>

116
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:46.010
how far you've gone.
Um,
but I mean you might have to be the king man.

117
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:49.190
You were telling me that at some point in this podcast you are going to start

118
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:50.600
rattling off your dates.
If it actually,

119
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:54.890
you sat down here looking like you didn't have a care in the world and you just

120
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:59.500
casually mentioned to me that you're off to Mongolia tomorrow.
Yeah,
yeah.

121
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.990
I would be a fucking wreck going like,
Oh I,
what am I going to forget?

122
00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:06.830
Something I would have to check 50 times to make sure I have my passport and I

123
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:09.650
would stick it in the bag and I would zip it shut and then look to make sure and

124
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:13.130
I would zip and shut again and then I would still have to check it before I left

125
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:17.330
the house in the car on the way to the airport before I started talking that

126
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:18.170
anxiety down because

127
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.530
<v 2>is my,
um,
Genghis Khan biography to reread on the plane.
That's it.</v>

128
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.090
Does that how you say it?
It's not gang.
Yeah.

129
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.170
W I played in Mongolia last October and it was freezing.
It was in the third.

130
00:07:29.171 --> 00:07:31.910
So this is the,
you're the only guy I know.
Natalie's Ben to Mongolia Open.

131
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:36.040
Notice the way return engagement,
it's triumphant return to Mongolia.
You awesome.

132
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:38.590
The comedians,
they're wonderful guys.

133
00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:42.970
I mean in Mongolians are beautiful and they look like the people in the Avatar,

134
00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:46.330
but without the blue.
And uh,

135
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.690
five of the low five of the local Mongolian comedians met me at the airport when

136
00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:55.780
I arrived and they,
they cheered when I came out.

137
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.440
I'm like the most famous comedian that's ever played in Mongolia,

138
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.780
so they'd like bend over backwards showing me,
uh,

139
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.420
Ulaan Baatar and we drove out to the,
uh,

140
00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:10.810
the world's largest Genghis Khan's statue.
And Yeah,

141
00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:15.650
they taught me that it's a,
it's Genghis Khan,
not Angus.
And those,

142
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.450
<v 1>well,
I like a,
you're not obnoxious with that information.</v>

143
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.500
You could be really conti at a party.
Excuse me guys.
I don't interrupt.

144
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.180
Genghis Khan.

145
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.100
<v 2>Yeah.
And Americans and other people say though,</v>

146
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.840
they call those white round tents a Yurts,

147
00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:33.820
but they actually call them GIRs in Mongolia.
So what's,
what's the,

148
00:08:33.821 --> 00:08:34.654
uh,

149
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.890
I don't know anything about it other than it's just sort of spoons with northern

150
00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:43.660
China.
It's between them and Russia and China and Russia and a,

151
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.900
so I liked it so much and um,

152
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.640
I wanted to go back in summer and see it when it wasn't,
um,
bone chilling cold.

153
00:08:51.641 --> 00:08:55.770
So it's kind of um,
uh,
vacation.

154
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.420
So I mean I'm going to do a gig there,
but I'm going to go in and I'm,
I'm,

155
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.240
I'm going to spend like four days there.

156
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.000
These guys are going to take me way out into the country.

157
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:07.500
We're going to sleep and occur.
One of those round tents.
Um,
shoot,

158
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.130
shoot,
shoot some arrows,
do some,
uh,

159
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:15.690
do some Mongolian warrior activities.
And then I got a Gig.

160
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.730
You got to tell Rogan about this.

161
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:20.220
Rogan sounds like he would be all over the sure.
He would love it.

162
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:23.750
I'm sure you would love it.
It's um,
you know,
that's the,

163
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.590
<v 1>I've shot some arrows in my time.
I went,</v>

164
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:30.510
I went both fishing and some by you down and fucking hour with it was somewhere

165
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.740
outside of New Orleans.

166
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.710
<v 2>It's a great thing about being a comedian.
I remember I was in Alaska years ago.</v>

167
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:39.711
I did a Gig and catch a can and I met the perfect Alaskan Guy who took me

168
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.520
fishing on his charter boat and then took me skeet shooting.

169
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.450
<v 1>I just feel like when you meet those guys,</v>

170
00:09:46.451 --> 00:09:48.610
there's always some sort of like raggedy plane.

171
00:09:48.611 --> 00:09:53.040
Do you get in first that lands on water or they put snowshoes on bottom of it in

172
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:53.883
place

173
00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:56.763
<v 2>upon tune.</v>

174
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.710
<v 1>So what,
let's see.
You know,
you're the only guy in all that's played Vietnam.</v>

175
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.100
<v 2>I love Vietnam.
You know my,</v>

176
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.190
<v 1>yeah.
Like I know that watches like Ken Burns documentaries like,
yeah,</v>

177
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:11.410
I've been there.
I've played there.
Yeah,
I know what it looks like.
No,

178
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:12.244
I've done all of that.

179
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.750
<v 2>Um,
I,
you know,
well,</v>

180
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.760
I did that special for comedy central in 1995 called Viva Vietnam.

181
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.930
I W I got to go to Vietnam.
You've been going there.

182
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:26.850
I was like eight years.

183
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.200
I was the first comedian ever to have a development deal with comedy central and

184
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:35.370
so I could do whatever I wanted.
It was like being a junior filmmaker almost.
So.

185
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:40.110
Oh.
And they was [inaudible] 94 Bill Clinton lifted the travel ban on Vietnam.

186
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:45.170
The way like Obama lifted the travel ban on Cuba and my father fought in

187
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:49.890
Vietnam.
He flew helicopters.
He was shot down everyone in his helicopter.

188
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.400
Can you tell that story?
Uh,
yeah.
Quickly.
Yeah.
So,

189
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:58.050
and this is why Vietnam has always been a really important,

190
00:10:58.051 --> 00:11:01.830
it's a been a big thing in our family.
Um,

191
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.970
so my father flew helicopters in Vietnam in 1969.

192
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.780
He was stationed in [inaudible] and uh,

193
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.890
he,
there was,
there was all these soldiers stuck on the ground.

194
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:18.780
They're surrounded by,
uh,
the north Vietnamese soldiers in there.

195
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:19.890
They're just getting slaughtered.

196
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.630
So my father had to fly in and rescue these guys.
How old was he?
Um,

197
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:29.010
he actually joined my,
my dad was one of those knuckle heads,
so he was 30.

198
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.270
His,
uh,

199
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.930
his buddies in his unit called him [inaudible] because he was like the oldest

200
00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:38.340
guy there because everybody else was 19.
You know,
he just thought,
you know,

201
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:41.100
he grew up on John Wayne movies.
He thought that,
you know,

202
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.230
he was one of those guys that thought in your country needed you,
you know,
so,

203
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:51.150
uh,
they made,
he made,
I got the letter from the army,
uh,

204
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:54.580
in all his metals,
um,
after he died.
Uh,

205
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:59.380
so he made three attempts to land to save these guys and was,

206
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.350
it took so much heavy fire,
he had to lift up,

207
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:07.351
circle around and on the fourth attempt he gets down and there's like 20 guys

208
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:12.460
down there,
it's still alive and it's life or death.
So they all like jump on the,

209
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.250
the helicopter as he's pulling up,
you know,

210
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.340
and these just getting rattled with so much,
um,

211
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.480
fire machine gun fire that the helicopter nose dived down and everybody died in

212
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:30.400
the helicopter except for him and his copilot who was knocked unconscious,

213
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.930
he unhooks him,

214
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.890
dragged him across the field under heavy fire and then they had to wait there

215
00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:40.891
for like an hour or two before someone could come in and rescue was shooting

216
00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:45.970
back at them or what?
Well,
it's funny,
he,
cause he,
you know,
he,
my dad,

217
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.530
uh,
would laugh when he tells his story because he always had this pistol that he

218
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:52.690
would take with him when he,
when he was flying.

219
00:12:52.691 --> 00:12:57.160
And then the one day he forgot it,
he gets shot down.
So he wasn't shooting back,

220
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.070
he didn't have a gun.
So,
um,

221
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.660
my dad was a decorated war hero and he,
um,

222
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:08.470
he got like five metals via house.
He,
uh,
Tom has it framed,

223
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:11.710
he has the letter and,
and there's like,
you know,

224
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:14.650
the little from the army is saying what he did from his commanding officer and

225
00:13:14.651 --> 00:13:18.220
there's almost not enough room in the frame for all of the medals.
Like five,

226
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.220
there's like six medals,
but five were from that one incident.

227
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:25.330
He got the distinguished flying cross and,
and,
uh,
my,

228
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.980
my father,
um,
is buried in Arlington national cemetery as he should.

229
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.010
And you've got to be a bad ass to get in there.
You know,

230
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.130
I would say he qualifies.
So my dad,
uh,

231
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.340
probably be buried across the street and like sort of a seven 11,

232
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:44.140
I want to viking funeral pyre.
Um,
so,
so my dad,

233
00:13:44.141 --> 00:13:45.070
every year he would get,

234
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.760
he would have a reunion with his Vietnam veteran helicopter buddies.

235
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.950
And it was like,
um,
big thing for him.
Uh,
and,

236
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.770
uh,
and,
and you know,
my dad also loved stand up comedy.

237
00:13:56.771 --> 00:14:01.210
My Dad loved prior and my dad's the reason I'm a comedian,
you know,
he had all,

238
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.780
I remember driving around with it as a little kid listening to Richard Pryor

239
00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:07.930
with my dad.
So as he thrilled that you became a comedian?
Oh yeah.

240
00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:11.400
My Dad drove me to my first open mic night.
My Dad,
my dad.

241
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.050
So my dad stayed up.

242
00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:18.570
Comedy was always revered in my family and well especially,
you know,

243
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.070
because my dad and he just,
uh,

244
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.590
my dad wore shipped prior.

245
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:28.270
He had a Bob Newhart records and tasted great tastes too.
Yeah.

246
00:14:28.271 --> 00:14:29.830
So I,
I,
um,

247
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.340
I think those were like my two biggest influences as a kid.

248
00:14:33.341 --> 00:14:38.140
And then my family is from Washington DC and my uncle did open mic nights for

249
00:14:38.141 --> 00:14:42.040
one year in 1978.
I'm 11 years old.

250
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.910
My Dad took me to see my uncle performance is open Mike night.

251
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.650
And it was a club called El Brooklyn's in DC.

252
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.600
And the entrance was next to the stage,
the shows in progress.

253
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.200
We walk in,
I'm wearing a Washington Redskins jacket.

254
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.850
The comedian onstage pulls me on stage and he starts interviewing me like I'm

255
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:06.230
the coach of the Redskins and I'm like,
I'm 11.
I'm a bashful,

256
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:11.150
dopey kid.
I give you one word answers.
Yes,
no,

257
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.010
but I'll never forget standing on that stage and seeing all those happy people

258
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.610
with their heads thrown back and laughter and all the teeth in their mouth.

259
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.660
And that moment changed my life.
And I,
you know,
and I,
I just,
I can,

260
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:27.710
I can still picture it.
You know,
it's,
I,
you know,
um,
you know,

261
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.180
black people,
Latin people,
white people,
like Asian people,

262
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:34.190
just the flavors of humanity.

263
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.930
And I just thought that that was the most magical place in the world to stand on

264
00:15:38.931 --> 00:15:42.140
stage,
making people laugh.
So,
um,

265
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:47.170
I became a student of comedy after that and would keep notebooks and then I

266
00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:51.610
started when I was 17 with a fake id.
You still have all your,
yeah.

267
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.690
<v 1>Comedy.
You like your apartment,
first of all,
it's cool as shit.</v>

268
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.450
It's also like this,
uh,

269
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.720
it's the Smithsonian of your life and he has his dad's helmet from Vietnam when

270
00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:08.530
he was shot,
the one that he was wearing.
Um,
I got chills looking at that thing.

271
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:09.220
Yeah.

272
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:14.220
Like that's like a imagine brain when he was wearing that and you were told me

273
00:16:14.681 --> 00:16:19.540
the story as we were sitting there smoking a wonderful cigar.
Uh,

274
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.730
and you told me this story and then to s and you're like,
I still have the Helen.

275
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:24.610
And I was like,
Oh wow,
man.
I couldn't believe it.

276
00:16:24.611 --> 00:16:28.520
Then to walk in and see it and after it and just the heaviness of it once it's

277
00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.020
like a story attached to it.
Like if you just got a helmet and it was like,
yeah,

278
00:16:32.021 --> 00:16:35.560
this is like,
uh,
you know,
some memorabilia thing.
This is,

279
00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:38.410
and you have to wonder what happened to actually know what happened while the

280
00:16:38.411 --> 00:16:42.970
thing was,
I mean,
I'm into that type of shit.
Like,
I got that weird thing of like,

281
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.270
um,
if I know the story behind it,
which is why I have to be careful because I'll,

282
00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:50.710
I'll just fill my house up with a bunch of shit like that.

283
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.250
And then I have all this fucking anxiety that I have no place to send anything

284
00:16:54.251 --> 00:16:55.084
down.
You know,

285
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.420
I kinda have this thing cause I kind of grew up with semi hoarders that just

286
00:16:58.421 --> 00:17:03.190
would not fucking throw anything out,
you know,
40 years of magazines and Shit.
Um,

287
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.140
no,
that's the cool thing about,
you know,

288
00:17:05.141 --> 00:17:09.130
I had everything in storage for 10 years.
I just traveled the world.

289
00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:11.880
I decided not to live anywhere.
Do you think his,
his,

290
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.590
so I got to preserve all these great things,
you know,

291
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:19.090
what do you think your dad being in Vietnam and then you learning about that,

292
00:17:19.091 --> 00:17:22.680
is that how you got the travel bug to the level you do your unlike some Tom

293
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.513
Brokaw level shit

294
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.150
<v 2>maybe.
And My mother's from Argentina,
so I don't know.</v>

295
00:17:28.151 --> 00:17:32.920
I mean I had performed everywhere in the United States,
you know,
20,

296
00:17:32.921 --> 00:17:37.870
30 times and I wanted to branch out.
Um,
but,
but,

297
00:17:37.871 --> 00:17:39.100
but,
but back to Vietnam,

298
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.640
I mean that was a really special thing for me to go there.

299
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.570
And I filmed this hour special called Viva Vietnam for comedy central.

300
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.130
It was like a travel log type

301
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.660
<v 3>of thing.
Um,</v>

302
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.930
did the Jane Fonda workout tape in Hanoi with some old women in a park when

303
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.490
Denay China beach set up a slippery slide.

304
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.870
People about why Jane Fonda is funny for them.

305
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:07.740
I Vietnam veterans hate Jane found his guts still to this day.
Veterans,

306
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.580
um,
at those Vietnam reunions,
my dad would go to,

307
00:18:11.581 --> 00:18:16.460
they still sell the Jane Fonda,
um,
urine,
uh,

308
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.740
the thing for like a urine old guard with her picture on it.
You know what I'm,

309
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.300
you ever seen a urinal cake?
Yeah.

310
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:26.640
It will know like the little plastic thing on it.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Um,

311
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.260
Vietnam War Jane Fonda goes to Hanoi,

312
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.960
the um,
uh,

313
00:18:33.961 --> 00:18:38.961
the capital of the people were having a war with and she's antiwar and,

314
00:18:39.321 --> 00:18:42.270
and,
and they took pictures of her own,

315
00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:46.700
like anti aircraft artillery and,

316
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.570
and then she met the POW yes.
And one of them slipped her a note.
And then she,
uh,

317
00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.150
apparently,
if I remember the story correctly,

318
00:18:54.151 --> 00:18:58.830
she gave that to the Vietnamese prison guards and Oh,

319
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:03.660
the guy was tortured to extra for,
I'm slipping her a note.
Oh God,

320
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.280
that's fine.
That's has to be the ultimate,
uh,

321
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.480
stupid celebrity moment.
Yeah.
Where you're,

322
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.020
you're just so like,
you know,

323
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.710
sucking the Dick of your own fucking ego that you,

324
00:19:15.711 --> 00:19:20.350
you go and do something like that to just,
why are they being against a war zone?

325
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.520
That's fine.
Thick.

326
00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:26.550
You'll go to the capitol and watched enough war movies that my heart would be in

327
00:19:26.581 --> 00:19:29.550
my fucking throat.
The second you get the note,
you're like,

328
00:19:29.551 --> 00:19:31.920
do I got to put this under my tongue of put it up my ass?

329
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:35.370
Like what do I gotta do?
I gotta do it.
I know this is like some top secret shit,

330
00:19:35.371 --> 00:19:38.790
Huh?
Yeah.
Um,
but so in,

331
00:19:38.791 --> 00:19:42.660
in 1990 we filmed was guard.
He met you.
He

332
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.490
asked,
Matt slipped me a note.
Um,

333
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.450
he'll need extra bamboo under his fingernails.
Uh,

334
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.920
so 19 September 94,
we filmed it.
And like Americans,

335
00:19:55.921 --> 00:19:58.800
it was only like,
that's,
that went there.
Like,

336
00:19:58.801 --> 00:20:03.690
it hadn't become like a tourist place yet.
So,
and this park and in Hanoi,

337
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:08.710
a old women would gather and do Tai Chi in the morning.
So at the time,

338
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.980
[inaudible] 94,
beginning,
early nineties,

339
00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:15.981
Jane Fonda was making these exercise tapes and we set up a television with a VCR

340
00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:20.880
and we brought the tape in 1994 technology,

341
00:20:20.881 --> 00:20:25.290
we had to run an extension cord like five blocks to,

342
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.740
to set this up in the park.
And these old women loved it.

343
00:20:28.741 --> 00:20:32.970
They took to it and they started doing it.
And she goes,
I turned it as she goes,

344
00:20:32.971 --> 00:20:37.370
now turned to the right and I'll say,
I,
I'll say she turned to the right.
Did she?

345
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.910
Oh,
did you see,
uh,

346
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:44.330
can you imagine her fucking agent when she was telling him that I'm going to go

347
00:20:44.431 --> 00:20:47.320
to North Vietnam?
He's just sitting there.
Jake,

348
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.250
I've worked so hard with you to get you to this level.

349
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:54.730
I'm imploring you not to do this.
Oh,
Marie,

350
00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.430
take a bed,
bed bed.
Uh,
Mary Tyler Moore episode.

351
00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.440
Um,
God,
what a fuck.
He sort of like the first Dennis Rodman.

352
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.940
Like when by the time Dennis did it,
it was just,
just been so much.
First of all,

353
00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:14.500
they didn't have our guys,
you know,
in,
in p and W.
Yeah.
And uh,

354
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.490
well I mean,
you know,
um,
what was that guy's name?
Auto warm beer.

355
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.000
It was a guy that,
I have no clue who that is,

356
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.940
but he played for the Bengals and the only one who remembers this guy's name,

357
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.950
I think he was from Chicago,
he was there,

358
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:31.951
he went to North Korea on vacation a few years ago and he stole a banner out of

359
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:37.660
the basement of a hotel and they sent him,
sentenced him to,
you know,

360
00:21:37.661 --> 00:21:41.980
hard labor for life and then they gain back years and later on he sent him back

361
00:21:41.981 --> 00:21:45.760
as a vegetable there.
It was in a coma and he died and he died.

362
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.740
It's heartbreaking story.
So yeah,
he went up to,
he went in there and like,

363
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:55.510
yeah,
it took that post or whatever,
which is,
you know,
something you don't do.

364
00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:57.430
I remember it's somebody on,
on,
on the Internet.
It was like,

365
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.340
as you use the apple of white privilege,
oh my God,
this,
it's like even this,

366
00:22:02.341 --> 00:22:05.590
you have to turn into that.
Yeah.
Can't we all just be like,
wow,

367
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.700
that's somebody's son.
Yeah.
You know,
Kent,
can't he just do that?

368
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:14.650
Do you have to turn it into like a fucking Hashtag uh,
social justice,

369
00:22:14.651 --> 00:22:19.000
whatever fucking moment.
Everyone's being dehumanized.
Yeah.
I mean,
I dunno,

370
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:24.010
that was one of those sites stand.
Why anybody would go to Vietnam on vacation.

371
00:22:24.011 --> 00:22:27.380
They killed so many of our,
she knew so many people that die,
you know?

372
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:32.860
And I went back in 2014 Hanoi was my favorite.

373
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.050
It's French tree line boulevards.
It's really,
uh,

374
00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.530
the lake that John Mccain was shot down in a,
in the whole town.

375
00:22:41.531 --> 00:22:46.510
Has Swan boats now has now a swan peddle boats?
No,
it doesn't.
I told you that.

376
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.350
Did you tell me that?
I did tell you she was my Boston background.
Yeah.

377
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:55.270
You can rent couples go there and rent swan paddle boats.

378
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:59.670
So that's why I don't watch people stand up special because things stick.
Here's,

379
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.010
I forget cause I was sitting there and oh I'm going to throw in the swan joke

380
00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:05.350
thing from right when I got back.

381
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.080
So I went in in 2014.

382
00:23:08.081 --> 00:23:13.081
This English guy who runs the Gig there and annoying also gives motorcycle tours

383
00:23:13.271 --> 00:23:14.860
of the north in Vietnam.

384
00:23:14.861 --> 00:23:19.000
So I went back to April of this year and um,

385
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.340
I went on this,
if it was my,

386
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:26.730
my dream to go on this motorcycle journey and we were 45 miles north of Hanoi

387
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.400
going up a mountain,
a little winding road,

388
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.220
the bike went out from under me and I wrecked and it doesn't say how good a

389
00:23:36.221 --> 00:23:37.054
writer are you,

390
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.960
how's the fourth time I've been on a motorcycle and I've been afraid of

391
00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:45.950
motorcycles my whole life.
So it was something I wanted to do to break my fear.

392
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.110
And uh,
I was wearing a helmet and my head bounced off the road,

393
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.310
but I was fine and uh,
took a lot of skin off my elbow.

394
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.850
But I think it just taking the safety course out here,

395
00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:03.530
we ride around the parking lot.
My wife's brother,
my wife is from Holland,

396
00:24:03.531 --> 00:24:07.100
and her brother teaches motorcycle lessons in Rotterdam.

397
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.780
So last summer when I was in Rotterdam visiting her family,
uh,

398
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:14.690
he took me out and,
and he and I did that in the parking lot.

399
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:20.030
So I did then how long between that and then just writing up a fucking mountain

400
00:24:20.031 --> 00:24:23.180
in Vietnam?
What,
eight,
10 months later

401
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.130
I took my ground school and,
uh,
it didn't fly again.

402
00:24:28.131 --> 00:24:32.720
And eight months later I decided to fly in a dirt bike when I was 14,

403
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:37.130
and I like tore a tendon in my arm and I missed a baseball season,

404
00:24:37.131 --> 00:24:41.450
which was a big deal when you're 14.
And,
uh,
and then I didn't,

405
00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.610
when I lived in Amsterdam and I had to,
uh,
worked,
uh,

406
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.960
for this Dutch travel show for a year,

407
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:52.910
I got to do a highlight on Peru and we went to the Nazca lines.
You know,

408
00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:56.150
those lines that people think are alien landing strips.

409
00:24:56.151 --> 00:24:59.450
They weren't discovered until the 1920s had shit on that cover.

410
00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:03.070
That Zeplin box set.
Uh,
you're talking about,

411
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.810
he's like a really dumb guy here dude.
I don't,
I don't,
that's weird.

412
00:25:05.811 --> 00:25:08.240
You're like talking in English,
but half of this shit you're saying like I don't,

413
00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:10.460
I don't,
I'm like,
I don't know what that is.
I'm just,

414
00:25:10.461 --> 00:25:12.410
this is taking me back to high school where I'm just like,

415
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.190
there's these desert drawings and they weren't discovered until the 1920s when

416
00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:18.150
aircraft was um,

417
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.640
first flying over Peru and one's,

418
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:26.540
it Condura one's a monkey and then there it looks like these landing strips in

419
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:29.090
between it and um,
yeah.

420
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:32.900
Why would you make it like that if everyone didn't know how to fly back then?

421
00:25:32.901 --> 00:25:35.810
Right.
Is that what they,
they asked?
It's like a thousand years old.

422
00:25:35.811 --> 00:25:38.960
It's how they have done it.
Unless aliens helped them.

423
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:42.710
Maybe just,
maybe that's the theory.

424
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.420
They develop some sort of hot air balloon before anybody else and then they all

425
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:51.770
perished in some sort of a plague and there,
you know,

426
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.900
I used everything was biodegradable back then.

427
00:25:53.901 --> 00:25:55.010
How are you going to find the hot air balloon?

428
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.980
It doesn't always have to be aliens.
It doesn't,
yeah.

429
00:25:57.981 --> 00:26:01.610
I used to do a align years ago that,
uh,
the ink is,
did cocaine,

430
00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:06.290
I guess that explains why they were building a Ufo landing strips in the desert

431
00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.350
all night.
Uh,

432
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:13.520
tell me about a couple of things I want to ask.

433
00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:18.020
One of my favorite podcast episodes ever was the one that you did with the late

434
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:20.870
great John Fox,
who was,
I never met him,

435
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:25.790
but I heard all of the stories.
He was like,
um,

436
00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:30.680
road viking.
I mean,
he,
like every,
he,

437
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.360
he created the cliches.
Like it was kind of like,

438
00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:39.280
uh,
like,
I dunno the Elvis or like,
you know,

439
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:44.430
the early days of rock and roll where there was no,
you know,
go out and go create

440
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.440
<v 1>it and create the,
what the fuck this is going to be.
And he,</v>

441
00:26:47.441 --> 00:26:52.330
he kind of did that as far as every fucking cliche.
Now,
um,

442
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:57.590
that guy was an listening to that podcast with him because I don't need heard of

443
00:26:58.581 --> 00:26:59.760
him and I never really,
you know,

444
00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:03.480
and there's all these short little clips of him on the Internet just to get like

445
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:07.200
an hour,
an hour and 10 minutes,
however long it is of him telling stories.

446
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.440
And then just hearing the stories in his voice like that.

447
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.370
I that crazy laugh.
Oh my God.

448
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.720
Oh my God.
Like,
uh,
amazing.
Uh,
how did you get like everybody,
I,

449
00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.740
I,
my buddy Paul Versey met him.
It was like,
man,
that guy was,

450
00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:26.640
he was a fucking sweetheart and Diversey met them right towards the end and he

451
00:27:26.641 --> 00:27:27.120
actually,

452
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.990
they're working on like Milwaukee or something and he watched his set and

453
00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:34.470
actually gave him a couple of tags,
encouraged them and all of that.

454
00:27:34.471 --> 00:27:38.580
And I dunno if he was sick yet,
but,
um,
he just was all mad.

455
00:27:38.581 --> 00:27:40.800
He was like the nicest guy and all of that type of stuff.

456
00:27:40.801 --> 00:27:44.280
So I'm so glad that you did that episode,
but how did you get to meet you,

457
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:48.740
<v 2>John?
Um,
I worked with him when I was really young.
I think I was,</v>

458
00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:52.820
I,
I was 19 when I worked with him in Jacksonville,
Florida.

459
00:27:52.821 --> 00:27:54.140
There used to be a punchline there.

460
00:27:54.141 --> 00:27:58.160
It was a great room and I used to do the comedy zone down there.

461
00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.560
This was way before that.
You know,
the Atlanta punchline in the,
in the boom,

462
00:28:03.561 --> 00:28:04.730
in the late eighties,

463
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.760
there was punchline comedy clubs all over the south and the one in Jacksonville

464
00:28:10.281 --> 00:28:12.560
was one of the best and the guys that owned it,

465
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.910
it was like four guys and then they all got like Mercedes and BMWs and then

466
00:28:16.911 --> 00:28:20.570
they're,
they're breaking in so much money.
They moved it to a bigger venue.

467
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.390
They had like 150 seat room.

468
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:27.020
Then they moved it to a 500 seat room and the place was never the same.

469
00:28:27.021 --> 00:28:31.160
And then it went out of business.
But at one time that was like one of the,

470
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.680
it was one of the greatest clubs in the south.

471
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:36.950
So I worked with him and you know,

472
00:28:36.951 --> 00:28:41.630
John Fox was legendary for kind of being a womanizer,
coke freak,
booze hound,

473
00:28:41.631 --> 00:28:45.480
all that.
Chan,
I check he liked me,
um,

474
00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.750
because I,
I could drink heavily and um,
I,

475
00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:53.480
I was relatively cute and um,

476
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:57.740
we would attract some ladies.
So he still had,

477
00:28:57.741 --> 00:28:59.270
he was on one of the first

478
00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.813
<v 1>right,
right.
That is,</v>

479
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:05.760
that is next level like getting pussy where it,

480
00:29:05.761 --> 00:29:06.331
so I just,

481
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:10.080
that remind me of Pedro Martinez when he lost the heat on his fast ball.

482
00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:13.770
So he developed a couple other pitchers and he was able to stay in the league at

483
00:29:13.771 --> 00:29:14.604
a high level.

484
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.150
So he's sitting there crushing ass cause he was a good looking guy when he was

485
00:29:18.151 --> 00:29:21.060
young.
Right.
Blonde hair had the mullet,
which was the look,

486
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:24.870
the whole Miami vice oak he could pull up was crushing ass and then all of a

487
00:29:24.871 --> 00:29:28.560
sudden he starts,
you know,
loses a little heat on his fastball is like,

488
00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:31.200
it's a good looking young fella.
I'll bring him along.

489
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.380
That'll keep bringing the ladies up to the light here.
That's the thing I think

490
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.890
<v 2>people don't,
don't think of when they think of him.
When he,</v>

491
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.830
he was on one of those early Rodney Dangerfield,
young comedian specials,

492
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.100
and he looked like a California surfer guy.

493
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.180
He had blonde hair but Tan Tan,
right shape.

494
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.710
And then he got older and Pudgy and he looked like an older white guy,

495
00:29:53.711 --> 00:29:57.280
alcoholic dude.
So,
um,
the life caught up with him.

496
00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:59.290
He helped me get in.

497
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:04.740
He loved me and he helped me get in with Chicago xannies where he was the men,

498
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:10.750
you know,
that was his hometown.
He was from Waukegan,
Illinois.
But,
um,

499
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:12.400
he was mister Chicago,

500
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:17.690
so he gets me work with him in Chicago,
booked like three weeks,
uh,

501
00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.130
the downtown room and a couple of the suburban rooms for a couple of weeks.

502
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.280
I'm 19.
I'd never been to Chicago,
uh,

503
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:28.870
and it was sold out every night and he was demand,
uh,

504
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:34.110
Saika one of his porn star came and he took me to the blues brothers,

505
00:30:34.481 --> 00:30:39.481
had a bar or doing cocaine after hours off to the pinball machine.

506
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:44.620
He took me,
he took me to a cubs game.
He took you under his wing.

507
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.180
He took me under his wing,
but it was great.
I mean,
you know,

508
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:52.450
I'd only been doing comedy for two years and I'm in Chicago playing and sold out

509
00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:54.550
rooms opening for this guy.

510
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.310
But he took me to see the cubs and he was a,

511
00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:04.150
he was kind of a Chicago celebrity back and he was buddies with Steve Stone.

512
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:07.390
And he actually took me up.

513
00:31:07.391 --> 00:31:11.080
We got to go up into the booth when Harry Carey's sang,

514
00:31:11.081 --> 00:31:12.820
take me out to the ballgame.

515
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.830
And like Harry Carey's leg half in the bag,
leaning out the window and,

516
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:22.540
um,
the had to hold his belt so he didn't fall out.
I mean,

517
00:31:22.541 --> 00:31:26.020
who lead a better life than that guy gets to announce baseball while he's just

518
00:31:26.021 --> 00:31:29.230
catching a buzz.
And everybody's started was hilarious that he was like,

519
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.850
he was literally drunk.
Yeah.
On the,
yeah.
In the afternoon.

520
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.190
So,
um,
yeah,
so I mean,
you know,
uh,

521
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:44.270
John Fox was really nice to me and I knew him through the years and then,
uh,

522
00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:49.660
the trials and tribulations and bad relationships and years of booze and access.

523
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.150
Uh,
it was kind of sad,

524
00:31:52.151 --> 00:31:56.740
but I mean he was kind of the cautionary tale of,
you know,

525
00:31:56.741 --> 00:32:01.300
you don't want to be this road guy who,
um,

526
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.490
is just chasing women and partying and stuff forever because it,

527
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:09.340
uh,
it was really a sad end for that guy.

528
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:14.430
And then he lived in the apartment building next door to the apartment where the

529
00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:20.380
xannies puts the comedians in Chicago.
It's an old town.
And,

530
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:22.360
uh,
there's the old town Ale House,

531
00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:26.800
which I remember him taking me there and all these,
that area in the,

532
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.540
in the late eighties was grant.
I'm a kid and it was,
you know,
it was so much fun.

533
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.990
And then,
uh,
he was Kinda like sad,

534
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:40.010
lonely drunk guy at the old town Ale House.
Towards the end were,
was towards the

535
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.960
<v 1>end,
like when,
when did it start becoming,</v>

536
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.780
when did it sort of shifts where the industry wasn't,

537
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:49.710
he stopped getting work and,
um,
and I,
I sat in the nine,

538
00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.450
Nah,
I can't remember.
Right.

539
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.790
I can't remember what year I did that recording with him.

540
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.050
I don't think it was the nineties cause when I was,
no,
no,
it was early thousands.

541
00:32:59.051 --> 00:33:00.440
Yeah.
Cause when I was in the nineties,

542
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:05.060
when I was starting to get out there on the road,
it was,
uh,

543
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:10.700
I would hear legendary stories about him.
And then everywhere I had just been,

544
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.601
it seemed,

545
00:33:11.601 --> 00:33:16.601
Doug Stan hope was there and had some sort of debauchery in the fucking green

546
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:21.050
room.
And I remember the first time I met Doug stay and help,
uh,
you know,

547
00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:24.200
I instantly loved the guy,
but before I met him I was like,

548
00:33:24.201 --> 00:33:27.180
where the fuck is this Stan Hope Guy?
What the fuck can he,
you know,

549
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.740
do all this shit outside of the God damn,
uh,

550
00:33:30.741 --> 00:33:34.640
the comedy condo and a,
but I would always hear like,
oh my God,

551
00:33:34.641 --> 00:33:37.790
the Atlanta punchline,
they,
they used to have stories.

552
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:39.860
I know there's a couple of guys who are still alive,

553
00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:41.990
so I don't want to fucking put this shit out there,

554
00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:46.991
but there was like a couple of guys on that Mount Rushmore of like,

555
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.400
the wait staff would be so excited that they were coming to town.

556
00:33:52.401 --> 00:33:55.100
And after like maybe a night and a half,

557
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:59.450
like that Sunday night show seemed like three years away and they would just

558
00:33:59.451 --> 00:33:59.601
like,

559
00:33:59.601 --> 00:34:02.690
I don't think I'm going to make it because there was those guys that came to

560
00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:05.090
town and they just,

561
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.690
they will like this pied Piper in the entire fucking wage staff.

562
00:34:08.691 --> 00:34:12.560
They had this charisma.
All the bartenders,
the club owners,
they,

563
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:16.550
he would just take them on a crawl night after night,

564
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:20.720
after fucking night.
And,
and like,
I mean,
I,
uh,

565
00:34:20.721 --> 00:34:23.300
this other guy that I know of who,
I'm not going to mention his name,

566
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:24.980
like he had a nickname and all that,

567
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:27.950
and he would pick up the phone and he would just,
he would say anything like,
Tom,

568
00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.510
you're like,
[inaudible] it's so and so.

569
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.440
And the running joke was you would just scream in horror knowing that he was

570
00:34:33.441 --> 00:34:34.280
coming to town,

571
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:37.640
he was going to stay with you and that you guys were going to be hitting a

572
00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:41.240
bottle or two every,
it would be like trying to keep up with Lemmy,

573
00:34:41.241 --> 00:34:44.180
some of these guys that reminds me of some of like the Lemmy Motorhead stories

574
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:46.220
that you hear him.
So,

575
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:48.900
<v 2>but when you don't have the,
um,
the,</v>

576
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:52.160
the albums in the following to fall back on,
like,

577
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.670
I remember anything John Fox,
when he was still like surfer,
good looking guy.

578
00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:02.110
Uh,
I remember he would walk by the waitress station and he would go,
um,

579
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:05.760
he would just announce,
fuck me before I'm famous.

580
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:08.340
He would say that out loud to the,

581
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:13.220
to the way he never would have survived the me too movement.
Oh my God.
Well,

582
00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.810
but so when he was so towards the end and you know,

583
00:35:15.811 --> 00:35:17.910
and I always had a soft spot in the,

584
00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:22.440
from a hurt for the guy because he helped me when I was a young comedian.
And,

585
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:27.090
uh,
so I did that interview with him.
And,
um,

586
00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.660
the thing that I,
that stands out for me on that interview that I did with him,

587
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.530
oh,
so there was,
there was one when it,
when it got sad for him,

588
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.980
I remember there was some turbulent,
he was

589
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.630
<v 3>in and,
and uh,
he was falling apart and as a,</v>

590
00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:46.350
as an alcoholic and I was in this terrible relationship and the girl had

591
00:35:46.351 --> 00:35:49.140
scratched his face,
like really bad.

592
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:52.980
And so he had all these scratch marks on his face.
And,
uh,

593
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:56.820
there was a story in Atlanta about him breaking down on stage and crying and

594
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.580
just some really sad stories and shit that happened to him.

595
00:35:59.581 --> 00:36:01.830
But the thing that stands out fucking movie.
Yeah.

596
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.940
The thing that stands out for me about that interview was that he still believed

597
00:36:05.941 --> 00:36:06.774
in love.

598
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.100
He's talking about and he had been through all this shit in his life and you

599
00:36:11.101 --> 00:36:12.360
know,
he's,

600
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:17.770
he's an older pudgy alcoholic guy past his prime and he's still talking about

601
00:36:17.911 --> 00:36:21.360
love and it's like radio,
but the standup version,

602
00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:26.020
like an Arrow back in the day co he could've played John Fox like the John Fox

603
00:36:26.021 --> 00:36:27.960
story.
It's the same thing.

604
00:36:27.961 --> 00:36:32.760
And in the end he ends up doing stand up in raging bull.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

605
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.080
Um,
well you,
uh,
you,
you cleaned up your act how long ago?

606
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:41.190
Uh,
I've been sober for almost five years.

607
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:46.350
That's fucking amazing.
I bet.
I finally kind of cleaned up my act.
I don't like,

608
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.000
I don't think I would ever not do it again,

609
00:36:48.001 --> 00:36:52.500
but like I drank like the last day of June and then I drank,

610
00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:56.730
uh,
August 7th,
and I'm not going drink against luck October now.

611
00:36:56.731 --> 00:37:01.731
I sorta drink like the way I smoked cigars or I should say the way I would like

612
00:37:02.041 --> 00:37:03.910
to smoke cigars,
which I like,
you know,

613
00:37:03.911 --> 00:37:07.950
a couple times a month or every other month or something like that.
Uh,

614
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.880
you know,
um,
I'm trying to like,
you know,
I've got a kid,

615
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.820
I'm a super old fucking dad.
They have a kid.

616
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.290
So it's just like I have to fucking be around until this,

617
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.120
my kid has it figured out.
You know,
every,

618
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.730
every warrior needs to move on to Weissman.
Yeah,
well,
no,

619
00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:28.560
you can't be out pounding it.
And,
uh,

620
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:32.160
one of the greatest things ever happened to me was given up the booze.

621
00:37:32.161 --> 00:37:37.040
And I mean,
and I feasted from the banquet of life,
you know,
I,
I,
I mean,

622
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.680
I lived in Amsterdam,
you know,
uh,

623
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:43.550
most of the talk show over there and then you would like the Dave Letterman talk

624
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:48.270
show for two years on Dutch television.
But,
um,
you know,

625
00:37:48.271 --> 00:37:52.980
I went through some pretty hardcore tragedies.
My Dad,

626
00:37:52.981 --> 00:37:54.540
who I adored,

627
00:37:55.140 --> 00:38:00.000
was killed by a drunk driver in 2009 through the irony of that,

628
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.700
when you see that helmet,
that surviving Vietnam,

629
00:38:02.701 --> 00:38:06.630
all of that and the metals and all that,
and then just some jackass in Anaheim,

630
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:09.150
which,
you know,
we've all fucking done.
So I can't,
like,

631
00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:12.750
it's just fucking unbelievable.
Then.
And then my little sister,

632
00:38:12.751 --> 00:38:17.490
who I was really close with,
um,
died of breast cancer in 2011,
uh,

633
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:21.900
my wife and I actually got married at her hospital bedside,
um,

634
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:25.200
the day before she died of cancer cause I didn't want her to miss it.

635
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.970
So that was 2011.
So 2012,
2013,

636
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
I had stopped drinking for pleasure saying I was like numbing

637
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.890
<v 2>myself because I was so heartbroken.
And then,
um,</v>

638
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:44.620
January 1st,
2014,
uh,
in Philadelphia,
I blacked out,

639
00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.560
busted my head open.
And uh,

640
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.880
the next I got like six stitches on my forehead.
I had a black eye.

641
00:38:51.881 --> 00:38:56.170
The next day I,
I looked in the mirror and I saw so much ugliness and uh,

642
00:38:56.171 --> 00:38:59.780
and I knew,
I knew,
she didn't know that was the moment when you look at,

643
00:38:59.781 --> 00:39:03.160
in that moment I had been thinking about it and I just thought the main,

644
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:07.520
I mean vanity was,
was a big reason because um,

645
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.310
I saw so much ugliness in the mirror,

646
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:11.740
but also I knew it was holding me back as a comedian.

647
00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:17.140
I knew I could be a better comedian if I stop drinking every night.

648
00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:21.490
And um,
you know,
and I didn't go to any AA meetings,

649
00:39:21.491 --> 00:39:25.870
which a people always get offended when I say that,
but,
um,

650
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:30.620
I just,
I just had had enough and,
uh,

651
00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.400
the first,
the first,
first couple of weeks,
you know,

652
00:39:33.401 --> 00:39:37.060
you're a little a little bumpy,
but,
uh,
you know,

653
00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.840
you can get through it just pictured you look into the mirror with the black guy

654
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:44.560
and the cut and just being like,
all right,
you win,
you win.

655
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.210
I'm not fucking doing this.
Well,

656
00:39:46.211 --> 00:39:48.370
what happened was I looked in the mirror and I just thought,

657
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:51.700
I want to go one year when I looked in the mirror,
what I said to myself was,

658
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:56.970
I want to go one year and see what it's like not being drunk every night to be,

659
00:39:57.671 --> 00:39:59.350
to see what I could get done.

660
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:04.080
And I got so much done a writing jokes and,
you know,

661
00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:08.920
working on my book and different projects and stuff.
Uh,
I,

662
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.430
I,
I,
that's what made me stick around.
Yeah.

663
00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.620
<v 1>Well mine to having a kid now too.
It's like every,
every dad told him,
I said,</v>

664
00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:18.600
Oh yeah,
have a kit that will,
that will curb your drinking.

665
00:40:18.601 --> 00:40:22.110
Cause they don't give a shit or have any sort of concept of what being hung over

666
00:40:22.111 --> 00:40:26.280
his yeah.
And they wake up with like,
they're there on a full tank.

667
00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:31.050
Like the whole body is brand new,
nothing hurts and they're ready to just,

668
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:36.180
it's just like that,
that,
that,
that they get right in your face yelling and shit.

669
00:40:36.181 --> 00:40:39.750
And it's just like,
um,
it's actually,
you know,

670
00:40:39.751 --> 00:40:43.560
I'm finding if I'm going to go out and do stand up,
I have to make the,

671
00:40:43.561 --> 00:40:47.010
I have to be out the door by eight o'clock,
eight oh five,

672
00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:48.480
I'm going to fall asleep.

673
00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:53.160
It's just one of those things like she gets up at like a quarter to seven in the

674
00:40:53.161 --> 00:40:56.730
morning.
And uh,
that happened to me last night where I was like,

675
00:40:56.731 --> 00:41:00.270
I'm going to go out.
I think it was actually,
I was going to go see a mission.

676
00:41:00.271 --> 00:41:02.850
Impossible.
Cause I'm wanting to watch Tom Cruise,
speaking of helicopters,

677
00:41:02.851 --> 00:41:06.750
flying that helicopter.
And,
um,
I just,
Oh,

678
00:41:06.751 --> 00:41:09.330
the next showing isn't until 10 or 10 30.
And I knew I was like,

679
00:41:09.331 --> 00:41:12.930
I'm gonna fall asleep in the middle of mission impossible.

680
00:41:12.931 --> 00:41:16.650
Tom Cruise Action Summer action movie.
I am so fucking tired,

681
00:41:16.651 --> 00:41:19.440
I'm going to fall asleep.
So,
uh,
plus I want to take my,
uh,

682
00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.720
Nia long to go see it and like imax get the whole thing before,
uh,

683
00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.120
the whole experience before it goes away.
So,
um,
let,
let me see.
Ah,
let's,

684
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:29.820
let's promote,
so you're going to be in Mongolia.
What else do you got?

685
00:41:29.821 --> 00:41:31.740
Like I don't know if I have any listeners there.

686
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.160
That was such a great story about how supported the comics where,

687
00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:39.161
because I did a Gig in India and like most of the crowd was comedians.

688
00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:42.350
I was so happy that I didn't realize that cause I would have been like

689
00:41:42.351 --> 00:41:44.300
intimidated.
Like,
Oh God,
they're all going to be like,

690
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:49.220
what's the next joke structure?
And afterwards we all hung out and it was like,

691
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:49.821
it was weird.

692
00:41:49.821 --> 00:41:54.821
It was like I was hanging at a comedy club on the other side of the world in

693
00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.150
like total.
They're color,
but it was the exact same fucking questions.

694
00:41:59.151 --> 00:42:03.140
Did you write on stage?
He'd do that.
Yeah.
Don't you think this guy is overrated?

695
00:42:03.141 --> 00:42:05.180
And they would say shit like that.
I was like,
oh my God,

696
00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:06.400

716
00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.360
I didn't want anyone to answer emails.

717
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:05.210
What's the name of that Patisserie?

718
00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.740
Cause I was picturing you go in there and the next time a standing in this line,

719
00:43:09.741 --> 00:43:10.820
you know,
you're all excited.

720
00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:14.410
Like that fucking asshole bill set it on his podcast.

721
00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.050
It's like,
but there's already,
the word is kind of how people already know.

722
00:43:18.051 --> 00:43:21.290
And when people come up to me,
I tell them like,
like what it is.

723
00:43:21.291 --> 00:43:24.830
And I actually liked the sandwich is better.
The sandwiches are amazing.

724
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:25.520
I remember what I,

725
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.910
what I told you what I tell everybody get one of the sandwiches because they're

726
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:32.210
incredible and then buy one for later from when you're walking around Paris and

727
00:43:32.211 --> 00:43:36.410

My wife was like,
no,

775
00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.770
I've never been to Pittsburgh.
So,
um,

776
00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.990
<v 1>she used to travel with me everywhere and now she's selective where she wants to</v>

777
00:46:35.991 --> 00:46:40.730
go.
She wants to go to Pittsburgh because we've never seen it.
I can tell you,

778
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:44.030
you got to get,
there was a pre Manny,
she got to get one of those sandwiches.

779
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:48.740
Yeah,
they're Italian section with all the,
uh,
the Gaba ghoul and all that shit.

780
00:46:48.741 --> 00:46:51.300
Joe Barton,
I converse,
he brought me through the,
they,
they went and got,

781
00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:56.350
got it through.
Pittsburgh is one of the,
uh,
great cities.

782
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:57.910
This country has one of the great,

783
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.190
the only guys in America I've never put performed one of the goals,

784
00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:04.750
go to a pirates game.
That view with the bridges,
it's,

785
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:08.120
it's an believable,
it's one of my favorite cities.

786
00:47:08.121 --> 00:47:09.710
And when you come from the airport,

787
00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:13.250
it's the greatest skyline you're going to see because it's not like you see it.

788
00:47:13.251 --> 00:47:16.100
It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
You can't see it at all.

789
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.640
And then you drive through like this fucking hill,
this tunnel,

790
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.180
and then you come out and just boom.
It says panoramic.

791
00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.000
[inaudible] it's like all of these bridges.

792
00:47:26.001 --> 00:47:29.990
There's the ballparks and everything to the left Heinz field.
Uh,
um,
what

793
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:32.770
<v 3>the weather,
what did pirates play?
It's going to say pac bell.</v>

794
00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:35.110
It's where the giants used to play.
I forgot what the fuck they call it.

795
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.960
They change them every year.
And then,
uh,

796
00:47:37.961 --> 00:47:41.410
then the skyscrapers and though they just,
there's so much to do there.

797
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:44.830
The food is unbelievable.
And the,
uh,
she'd be like,
people,

798
00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:48.600
they start feel you should give out little stars for Comedians that,
uh,

799
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:53.950
that word never.
He used to do that.
Do what Willie Stargell in 1979.

800
00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:59.260
Uh,
they called him pops.
Yeah.
And they had those,
there's flat hats back then.

801
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:03.220
Yep.
The old timers used to give out little stars to the his teammates that he

802
00:48:03.221 --> 00:48:06.010
thought whenever they did something.
Great.
All right.

803
00:48:06.011 --> 00:48:09.340
So on the back of their hats,
they had all these stars.
Do you remember that?
Yeah,

804
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:12.900
vaguely Kent to Calvin.
It was like a really cool thing about the,

805
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:14.310
I saw him on one of the last time,

806
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.720
one of his last public experience and to Colby,

807
00:48:16.721 --> 00:48:20.620
the side arm throwing out parents is,
uh,
I saw,
uh,
yeah,

808
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:23.410
but I saw Willie Stargell when he was old.
He was sick.

809
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:24.580
You could tell he was dying.

810
00:48:24.581 --> 00:48:29.300
And I was at three rivers stadium and I was watching,
uh,

811
00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:33.250
the cubs first,
the pirates,
Sammy Sosa was still out in right field.

812
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:38.620
He still look Cuban,
you know,
before,
have you seen him now?
No,
he's whiter than,

813
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:43.990
um,
there was some big story about him I read recently.
Yeah.
He's,
oh,

814
00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:48.610
he's living in Dubai and he's,
he looks,
yeah,

815
00:48:48.611 --> 00:48:53.410
he looks like John Fox.
Yup.
Now that's what Sammy Sosa looks like.

816
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:56.560
Okay.
So,
uh,
yeah,
what?
Pittsburgh?

817
00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.010
November 29th to December 2nd.

818
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:04.030
I don't think the pirates will be playing then I'm going to Heinz field and
then,

819
00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.880
um,
December 10th to the 17th,

824
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:32.100
Okay.
Dude,

00:50:01.301 --> 00:50:03.460
always go and,
and uh,
have a great time.

833
00:50:03.461 --> 00:50:06.370
It's a lot weirder now that I have a kid.

834
00:50:06.371 --> 00:50:08.770
So we set up this east of Australia.
It's just,

835
00:50:08.771 --> 00:50:11.740
Sydney is one of my favorite cities in the world.
All of those cities are great.

836
00:50:11.741 --> 00:50:15.730
Brisbane,
Melbourne,
Perth.
Yeah.
I came to Perth on Australia Day.

837
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:20.400
Fucking lunatics.
Who Do the El Camino was still popular,
so popular.

838
00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:24.370
They love those fucking things.
That,
what's the,
I forget what they call it.
The,

839
00:50:24.371 --> 00:50:26.860
it's a,
Oh,
I remember going to Australia for the first time.
I'm like,

840
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:28.910
what kind of car is that?
There's this,

841
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.990
this automobile brand called Holden and they still make those

842
00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:35.501
<v 1>cars.</v>

843
00:50:35.501 --> 00:50:40.480
They're great people were fucking shit faced driving all around.

844
00:50:40.481 --> 00:50:42.640
I've told you this shit.
I said,
I went to Bond Scott's grave.

845
00:50:42.641 --> 00:50:44.040
And so we went to bunny's got scratched me.

846
00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:48.670
Hannah Miller genuine draft bottle on there and I wanted to remove it,

847
00:50:48.671 --> 00:50:49.480
but I was like,

848
00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.420
out of respect for the person that put it there at pawn probably would have

849
00:50:52.421 --> 00:50:56.170
drank it.
He wouldn't give a fuck.
But um,
all right,
let's,
uh,

850
00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:59.470
let's wrap this up here.
So I,
I just got to say you,

851
00:50:59.471 --> 00:51:03.910
you're one of my favorite people,
one of my favorite comedians.
And uh,

852
00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:07.780
this has been one of the best podcasts I've done as far as just like fascinating

853
00:51:07.781 --> 00:51:12.160
fucking store.
I mean,
everything we had life death here.
What'd he say?

854
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:14.980
Heroic behavior here or rhythm.
Is that a word?

855
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.690
<v 3>Heroism.
Heroism,
yeah.</v>

856
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:20.490
I've been to a lot of countries too and it just doesn't seem to have walking

857
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:23.660
sticks on,
man.
I,
thanks for having me on,
man.
I,
uh,

858
00:51:23.661 --> 00:51:26.630
you're one of my favorite people to hang out with every time you and I get

859
00:51:26.631 --> 00:51:30.290
together and we just like hang out as buddies.
I always get material out of it.

860
00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.420
You know,
I was telling you that story about,

861
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:36.080
because I pronounced so many words incorrectly,
I was just gonna say,

862
00:51:36.081 --> 00:51:38.210
I can't imagine how many,
how many fucking countries I've been to.

863
00:51:38.211 --> 00:51:42.960
And I still sound like I've never left my block.
I mean it's just a great,
um,

864
00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.100
I was telling you about arguing with my wife because she wants me to clean the

865
00:51:46.101 --> 00:51:50.720
toilet and like I don't,
I don't want to clean the toilet.
Right.
And um,
you know,

866
00:51:50.721 --> 00:51:53.740
a lot of thoughts go through my head during the day,
you know,
watching movies,

867
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:57.290
sleep on the couch,
call a friend,
cleaning the toilet is not one of them.

868
00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.120
And we live in an apartment building.

869
00:51:59.121 --> 00:52:01.370
So this is what it's like to argue on an apartment building.

870
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:02.780
You make a valid point.

871
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:06.080
Now lower your voice because I don't want everybody in my building,

872
00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:09.740
no of my business.
I'm in the laundry room,
folding clothes.

873
00:52:09.741 --> 00:52:13.910
Some guy walks in there,
I know you,
you're the dude.
He don't clean the toilet.

874
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:16.760
So like I've been doing the effort,

875
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.130
I've just started doing that like in the last two weeks.

876
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:23.810
And that comes from having a conversation with you on my balcony smoking

877
00:52:23.811 --> 00:52:26.330
cigarettes or cigars.
Yeah.
You're one of those guys.

878
00:52:26.331 --> 00:52:29.180
You're always spitting out material and you don't realize it.
I go you to go.

879
00:52:29.181 --> 00:52:31.730
Don't waste that on me.
You better do that instead.
Yeah.

880
00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:33.420
I used to get an argument with me.

881
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:37.050
<v 1>Neil was still living in an apartment.
We used to,
uh,</v>

882
00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:40.320
she didn't give a fuck and she calls it,
she's passionate.

883
00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:46.130
So this is when she would occasionally throw shit at me or punch me in the

884
00:52:46.381 --> 00:52:51.330
chest.
This is back her younger wilder days.
And I remember,
uh,

885
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:52.380
we would get into,

886
00:52:52.381 --> 00:52:55.590
and I would lose so many arguments because she didn't give a fuck about volume.

887
00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.070
And I would always be calling like,
alright,
here's your bait to point.

888
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.800
You don't want to help the whole fucking world know about it.
I said,

889
00:53:01.801 --> 00:53:02.634
they get loud.

890
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:09.780
So then what's worse is you start whispering.
So only your shit is coming out.

891
00:53:09.781 --> 00:53:12.150
And all the neighbors like,
oh my God,
he's horrible.
He's not even arguing.

892
00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.170
She's so fucking right.
That's where they get you when they get loud on.
Yeah.

893
00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:20.640
Well anyways,
uh,
so great that you finally came on finally.

894
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.210
Got You on.
I think it's cause we also love smoking cigars and telling stories.

895
00:53:24.211 --> 00:53:28.220
So it's like why would have a podcast get in the way of that?
Um,
um,

896
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.440
I'm so glad you came on and you get to promote your dates here.

897
00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:36.090
So go see him in Mongolia.
If not,
you can see him in Pittsburgh.
Atlanta.

898
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.990
Nayak West Niasha.
Yes.
Orlando.
Yes.
You know,
I still,

899
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.890
I still play everywhere,
all over the states.
And you have a great life.

900
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:47.490
I majored in like radio communication where you got a great radio,

901
00:53:47.491 --> 00:53:51.720
but I wish somebody would give me a voiceover gigs.
Huh?
You know,
this town is,

902
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:56.250
you got to take it.
I'm running through the grass.

903
00:53:56.251 --> 00:53:59.670
I'm on my tippy toes.
Um,
definitely check him out.

904
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:02.940
He's going to be everywhere and if he's going to travel that fucking far,

905
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:07.680
you can travel a little bit to go see him.
Uh,
the great Tom Rhodes,
everybody,

906
00:54:07.681 --> 00:54:10.230
thank you so much for coming on.
Here's a little music for you.

907
00:54:10.231 --> 00:54:10.721
And then we get it.

908
00:54:10.721 --> 00:54:15.600
We have a bonus half hour of a greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon podcasts

909
00:54:15.601 --> 00:54:18.750
from earlier this year or years ago.
I don't know.
I don't decide.
All right.

910
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:21.600
Have a great weekend and I'll talk to you on Monday.
