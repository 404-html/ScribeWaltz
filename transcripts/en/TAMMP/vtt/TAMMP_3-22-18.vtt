00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.780
Hey,
what's going on is Bill Byrd is time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:06.850
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.860
Dan Checking in on you.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.610
I'm just checking in on you seeing how your work week is going.

5
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:22.520
I'll tell you right now,
it is a rainy,
gloomy,
um,

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.110
Thursday afternoon out here in Los Angeles.
I'll tell you,
but yo,
we aid the Ray.

7
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.850
This is what happens every year.
It fucking range.

8
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.660
Everything turns green and full like a week.
It looks like Portland,

9
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:41.661
Oregon out here and absolute paradise and then it just stops raining and then

10
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.630
the sun turns all of that Beautiful Green Shit Brown.

11
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.870
And then the Santa Ana winds over the,

12
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.870
they fucking like a giant nature's hairdryer.

13
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.130
<v 0>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.990
<v 1>Just heats the stuff up and then we have our fires and it's totally 100% normal.</v>

15
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.880
And every fucking year when this place is burning down,

16
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:06.270
somebody from back east always has to call me up.
You got towed.
You all right.

17
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.580
What's up with those fires out there?
It's what the fuck happens.

18
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.980
Do I call up people in Buffalo every eight though?
Ari?
What?

19
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:20.430
That lake effect snow.
What's Up With Dad,
What Sofa?

20
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.400
Niagara Falls.
And he said,
we should put a fence there.
Somebodies got to go over

21
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.760
everywhere you live,

22
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.070
there's something that makes them,

23
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.330
you gotta pay a price,
70 degrees,

24
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.000
70 degrees in gorgeous every fucking day.

25
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.600
You guys have seen me since I've moved out here.
You've seen that?
Just,

26
00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:47.710
just the JFK level.
Beautiful Tan,
golden,

27
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.520
golden brown ginger that I am.
When I come to your shows,

28
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.700
when I was living on the east coast,
I mean I was just like,

29
00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:56.830
it was like a fucking Casper.
The friendly ghost.

30
00:01:56.831 --> 00:01:58.630
If he actually got in shaped the fat.
Fuck.

31
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.860
Granted my head was the same size as this,
you know,

32
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.010
but ever since I moved out here,
man,
I'm telling you,

33
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.460
people have really commented.
It's like bill for the first time in your life.

34
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.190
He actually look human now.

35
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.990
I'm still pasty has ever black in his ugly as ever.
Right.

36
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.520
That's my biggie fucking line.
Pasty and his freckled as ever.

37
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.840
Um,
anyways.
Yes.
So this is,

38
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:30.110
this is one of these days we just want to stay at and eat some stew.

39
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.110
You know,
I love cooking,

40
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:36.350
but I really hate the fucking music on every how to cook video.

41
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.900
Why does it have to be just,

42
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.280
it's so fucking like perky and everything's going to be great.

43
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

44
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.170
<v 1>You know,
why?
Why can't,
you know?</v>

45
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:50.340
And he ever work in a fucking restaurant in the kitchen.

46
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.090
I don't mean being the fucking good looking fucking
dose.

47
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.960
You invites everybody into the restaurant.
Hi,
how are you?

48
00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:01.470
Maybe you'll fuck me if order the right fucking food,
you know,
not that person.

49
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.400
<v 0>Okay.</v>

50
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.780
<v 1>You know,
I swear to God,</v>

51
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:09.190
so much of beautiful women's game is giving you hope.

52
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.500
How far they can get in the game,

53
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:14.200
how many times they can go around the board and collect $200 just,

54
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.020
just on hope is,
it's,
it's fucking incredible.

55
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.933
<v 2>MMM.</v>

56
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.550
<v 1>Anyways,
I'm talking about,
did you ever work in the fucking kitchen?</v>

57
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.250
All right.
Everybody back there,
you know,
half the people there,

58
00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:32.400
if they don't have a record there about ready to get arrested for something,

59
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.210
there's always some sort of drugs going on.
Um,
it,
it's,

60
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.700
it's just a lot of degenerates in the cooking industry.

61
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.990
I just don't understand.

62
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.710
Or maybe that's why they have such pleasant fucking music.

63
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.830
You always have it stage.

64
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.120
So it was this giant fucking kitchen and somebody is just at home and they're

65
00:03:53.121 --> 00:03:56.900
always just like,
I love making toast.
You know,

66
00:03:56.901 --> 00:04:01.670
when I was a little girl and just toast to me was just,

67
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.130
I mean,
it just brought the family together,

68
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.820
the sound of my mom pushing the toaster buttoned down,

69
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.890
the smell of the bread.
Slowly crunching my dog,
muffin it,
my feet.

70
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.830
I figured on a rainy
Thursday afternoon,

71
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.080
we could recreate some of that.
You know,

72
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.000
I just wanted to somebody to make a fucking pork chop on youtube and talk about

73
00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:30.080
how much blow they did in the fucking eighties and are,
they can't even remember.

74
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.900
They can't even believe that they can remember the difference between pork and

75
00:04:32.901 --> 00:04:33.734
poultry.

76
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.980
They both begin with P and my drug dealer's last name was Phillips.

77
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.550
Um,
so it's very confusing time for me,
but as far as I remember,

78
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.650
<v 2>sorry.
Um,</v>

79
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.450
<v 1>anyways,</v>

80
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.070
I worked last night I was down at the comedy and Magic Club on her most of

81
00:04:53.071 --> 00:04:55.920
beach.
Speaking of my lovely nonexistent tamp.

82
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.370
Donald Trump literally looks like he has a halo of hair on his fucking head.

83
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.360
I just don't understand.

84
00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:06.180
Why doesn't he just take they hair plugs are incredible now.

85
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.970
Just take your shit from the back in paratroop that shit.
I Dunno.

86
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.470
It's like he has said,

87
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:16.230
remember when Justin Bieber had like that comb over hair cut,

88
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.470
which I really found offensive as a balding man.

89
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.600
You know that some would mark my situation with a full head of hair and I'll be

90
00:05:24.601 --> 00:05:27.270
honest with you,
I don't think I ever quite forgave him for that.

91
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.723
<v 2>MMM.</v>

92
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.610
<v 1>Anyways,
I'm sorry,
I'm,
I'm all over the fucking map here.</v>

93
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:34.480
What was that just talking about?

94
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:39.330
It's talking about people doing blow in the backs of kitchens,
right?
No,

95
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.780
it was past that.
Alright.
You know what it,
it just,
Oh,

96
00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:47.781
I was down her most of the beach doing a show with a blobby call and Bobby

97
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.450
Collins.
We did a show down there after raise some money for a great charity.

98
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:55.630
Went down there,
tried out a bunch of new stuff.
If you guys are in La,

99
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:58.400
if you want to go to a great comedy,
I love that fucking place.

100
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.610
And the people who run it and the level of like comedy Mike Memorabilia that

101
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:08.660
they have down there is a,
is incredible.

102
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.920
I believe that guy told me that,
uh,

103
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.630
he has something of George Carlin's at George War on one of the specials,

104
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:19.430
right?
And like a window or something like that.
I'm almost afraid to say it.

105
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.240
Some fucking lunatic ticket.
Go down there and try and steal it,
but it's,

106
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:27.170
it's really incredible.
It's like a,
it's like performing in the standup museum.

107
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.900
Especially when you saw how old my jokes were.
Sorry.
All right,

108
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.780
let's talk about the Boston Bruins.
Shall we bill all Billy freckles?

109
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.710
I am back on the fucking bandwagon here.

110
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:45.770
Jesus Christ can somebody closer to him and they fucking flushed the toilet

111
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:47.090
there.
Um,

112
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.600
um,
I watched the Columbus game,

113
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.490
which we lost in overtime.
I miss last night,
which we also lost in overtime,

114
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:02.150
but we still picked up two points.
All right.
We got a lot of people out.

115
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.110
Evidently like the injury bug is not only hit the fucking Bruins,

116
00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:09.320
it's also hit the Celtics.
Kyrie Irving is messed up his knee.

117
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.540
He was about supposed to be out for a few games.

118
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:15.770
Now they're saying it looks even worse.
So I don't know what that means.
You know,

119
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.940
the Celtics are not disclosing how he hurt his knee,
but I think we all know,

120
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.620
okay,

121
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.510
Kyrie thinks the world is flat and he was walking like it was flat and all of a

122
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:29.740
sudden he got towards starts to,
you know,
go down a little bit.
And you know,

123
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.150
it's like you ever walked down the stairs and you think you're at the last one

124
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.270
and you're not,
you know,

125
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.650
you miss a stair for something like that or you think you're at the end and

126
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:41.090
you're not.
I think he did that walking around his house just thinking,
well,

127
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:44.510
the earth's flat.
I don't need to adjust to the circumference here.

128
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.240
And that's how he hurt his knee.
And that's a true story.

129
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.480
But Ted Denato of the Bruins,
Ted Denato have,

130
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.330
it's Ted Denato.
Oh,
sorry,
Ryan didn't,
I don't want to,
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.950
I'm old son of Ted Denato came up with the Bruins is first frigging game.

132
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.050
He scored a goal and had two assists in a a overtime loss.

133
00:08:06.051 --> 00:08:09.500
I believe it was five to four against Columbus was great.
But what's his face?

134
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.270
Bershire Ron was saying that he actually,

135
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:16.271
when he was 18 played with Ryan's dad and Ryan was just a kid and would come to

136
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:20.870
practice and would skate around as a little kid and now all of a sudden he's on

137
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:23.490
the team.
Um,

138
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.050
I think they said version one runs 32 years old.
Yeah,
right around that age.

139
00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:30.590
That's when that type of shit starts happening.
You know what I mean?

140
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.650
And it's like you just remember somebody being like four years old and next

141
00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:39.110
thing you know you wake up and you're doing like Tequila shots with that little

142
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:41.840
fucking four year old being like,
how are you of age?

143
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.100
When did you turn 21 and the person will be like four years ago,
you know,

144
00:08:46.101 --> 00:08:49.650
like you are 25.
Yeah,
I got a kid.
You're like,
what the,

145
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.110
what the fuck happened?
And what happened was,
is you stopped growing.

146
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:59.120
There's no more grades,
erotic college.
Once you pass 22,

147
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:04.690
all right,
that's this weird fucking phase until you get,

148
00:09:04.691 --> 00:09:06.920
until you get married and have a kid of your own.

149
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.270
If you Jiffy of like me and you just went all the way into your forties and

150
00:09:11.271 --> 00:09:15.200
never got fucking married and never had a kid,
um,

151
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.610
you live in like this fucking Peter Pan Lifestyle where you like,

152
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.400
you still acting like you're 23 and then all of a sudden someone who was too is

153
00:09:25.401 --> 00:09:29.750
now 25 and they're actually married and they have a kid you like,
what the fuck?

154
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.920
What am I doing?
And um,
if you like me,

155
00:09:33.921 --> 00:09:38.360
it just causes you to drink more.
I mean,
why would you sit there and like,

156
00:09:38.361 --> 00:09:38.601
you know,

157
00:09:38.601 --> 00:09:42.920
as an adult and try to address just exactly what the fuck are you doing with

158
00:09:42.921 --> 00:09:46.100
your life?
Um,
you know,
but it's fun.

159
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.010
It's fun staying out there for 15 years longer than you should have.

160
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.100
You stick all the stories you have.

161
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.290
Maybe that's why that pleasant music bothers me.

162
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:58.430
Maybe those people who would make those,
those cooking videos,

163
00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:02.450
maybe they got married at like 25 when they were quote supposed to.

164
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:03.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

they just stay out there too long.</v>

166
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.930
Get all fucking jaded
like uncle Frankel's here.

Something was that soft and wet.

That's my abs after one.
Sit Up.

John Denver,
you know,
if he was wearing his puffy coat around his head,

210
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.010
maybe he still owe a third show at it.
Sorry.
Why am I making fun of John Denver?

211
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.260
I always liked that guy.
He was always great on the muppet show.
You know,

212
00:13:21.261 --> 00:13:24.170
that's not an easy show.
Everybody says don't perform with kids or animals.

213
00:13:24.171 --> 00:13:29.040
What about puppets?
You know,
I was always a tough one.

214
00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:31.670
He could fucking just sitting there talking to a God damn puppet,
right?

215
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.610
The TV screens on you and the puppet and then you're just,

216
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.850
you're sitting there and you're looking down.
You can see the puppeteer.

217
00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.800
He's up there doing the fuck.

218
00:13:39.801 --> 00:13:42.080
He's down there doing the voice and the whole time you're trying to remember

219
00:13:42.081 --> 00:13:42.920
your lines,
you're like,

220
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.980
that's what the guy who does fucking Fozzie bear looks like.

221
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.330
So fucking weird.
I never pictured picture.
I'm looking like that,

222
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.680
John.
If it's your line,
this is the 12th take.

223
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.100
Can you get through the fucking take here?
Um,
anyways,

224
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:04.190
I want to thank everybody who's been coming out all right and buying tickets to

225
00:14:04.291 --> 00:14:07.140
my show.
I'm turning a half a century old.

226
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.550
You understand that everything on me is 50 years old.

227
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.333
It's incredible.

228
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.440
By this whole fucking mess of a human being is somehow survived for 50 years.

229
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.790
Hey,
Belle.
Hey Belle,
his to 50 more.
Here's the 50 more are,

230
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.790
do you know how to do math,
sir?
Hey,
people do that.
Hey,

231
00:14:29.791 --> 00:14:34.791
here's do another 68 do another 60 that would make them one 20 this couple,

232
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.430
you know the odds of one of them making it there is,
is astronomical.

233
00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:39.330
Forget about both of them.

234
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.500
Just do another 60 when you say that what you're really doing in a passive

235
00:14:43.501 --> 00:14:46.560
aggressive way is letting people know that they're on the,

236
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.500
they're on the back night,
they're going to die.
They bell.

237
00:14:49.501 --> 00:14:54.360
Here's to another 50 I mean,
I guess I could make a hundred.
I mean,

238
00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.140
what's the world going to look like at that point?

239
00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.710
A bunch of robots fucking telling me what to do.

240
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.850
They could have no sympathy for me.

241
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.330
You think people don't respect human beings in this country?

242
00:15:07.331 --> 00:15:10.360
Don't respect their elders.
You wait till the robots come around.

243
00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.730
Metal counts.
All right.
Uh,
I got to do a little advertisement here.

244
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.640
I have you guys been watching the match madness?
I write my bookie.

245
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.500
All right.
I love my book.
You know why?

246
00:15:23.501 --> 00:15:25.840
Cause they're not ashamed that they're a bookie.

247
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.370
Unlike those other people who had,
or were there others,
people,
Dream Weavers,

248
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.850
whatever the fuck they call and try to say,
oh,
it's a game of skill.
No,
it isn't.

249
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.110
You're taking your hard earned money and you let it fucking ride and you're

250
00:15:38.111 --> 00:15:41.770

00:15:45.971 --> 00:15:49.000
He is not afraid to let you know that they're,
they're a part of that world.

256
00:15:59.171 --> 00:16:00.380

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.460
I'm going to put some money on the Kansas Jayhawks.
That's always been my team.

287
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:51.530
I really got into college hoops in the 90s,
and I just Kansas and um,

288
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.590
let's save.
Always stuck with me.
I just fucking lie.
That's think it's,

289
00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.100
I don't know.
I just always liked the Jayhawks.
All right.

290
00:17:58.101 --> 00:18:03.101
Trump moves to crack down on China trade with $50 billion in Ti olive oil.

291
00:18:03.671 --> 00:18:06.980
You have like the Christopher Walken pauses,
the weird pauses,

292
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.850
drop moves to crack down on China.
Try Aid.

293
00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.290
I can't just walk in with 50% tariffs on imported products.

294
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.390
Um,

295
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:21.920
he's basically imposing this tariff evidently because in the past he's claiming

296
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.780
a chain of forced,

297
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.580
I guess the u s to sh to show them how we make shit.

298
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:38.070
I don't know if this is true,
but you know,
everybody's steals,
right?

299
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.610
Everybody steals,
um,

300
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.110
you know,
like,
it's like,
Hey Pepsi,
where'd you get that idea?

301
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.420
Hey for stripe.
Adita what's up with that sneaker?
Nice design.

302
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:55.350
Doesn't that look familiar?
Doesn't that look familiar?

303
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.960
Let me read this article here.

304
00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.450
Let me read out loud to give you an x even more enjoyment here.

305
00:19:01.451 --> 00:19:06.190
President Trump took his first steps towards imposing tariffs on 50 billion in

306
00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:11.110
Chinese goods and limiting China's ability to invest in the u s technology

307
00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.360
technology industry.
Now I have the hiccups.

308
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.390
I'm going to plow through the hiccups holding my breath.

309
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.260
Is there a way to scare yourself?
You know,
you scare yourself out of the hiccups.

310
00:19:24.261 --> 00:19:28.820
Don't look at yourself in the mirror until the next time you get hiccups and

311
00:19:28.821 --> 00:19:30.680
just that small amount of time,

312
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.790
the amount that you've aged will scare the shit out of you.
All right?
Maybe not.

313
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:39.080
All right to invest in the u s technology,
technology,
technology industry,

314
00:19:39.081 --> 00:19:43.520
Thursdays saying the moves were response to Beijing's history of forcing US

315
00:19:43.521 --> 00:19:47.240
companies to surrender their trade secrets to do business in China.

316
00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.560
A one,
a four can sell that.
Hey,
you got to show us how you made.

317
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:53.300
<v 0>Okay,</v>

318
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.930
<v 1>it's Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Do they have the fucking secret recipe?
Now</v>

319
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.960
what they have Kung Pao fried chicken.
How do they do it?

320
00:20:02.961 --> 00:20:06.590
That's like their Mcdowell's.
Oh my God,

321
00:20:06.591 --> 00:20:11.110
that's fucking hilarious.
Let me ask you this.

322
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.710
Why is why,
if this is true,
right,

323
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.040
why a fuck is Trump blaming China?

324
00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:22.450
What does he blame all those fucking corporations sellouts who turned over there

325
00:20:22.451 --> 00:20:23.740
fucking secrets.

326
00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.910
That's the corporation's fault.
Why don't you draw a line in the sand?

327
00:20:30.911 --> 00:20:34.570
You fucking greedy cunts.
Hey,
if you want to sell that here,

328
00:20:34.571 --> 00:20:37.300
you guys show me how you make it.
You know what,
go fuck yourself.

329
00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.400
I remember when I used to sell shit at theaters and if they want it too big,

330
00:20:41.401 --> 00:20:44.230
then when they started,
like all of a sudden they'd be like,
Hey,
well,
you know,

331
00:20:44.231 --> 00:20:49.030
you're kind of using our theaters is a,
uh,
as a store and then they would take,

332
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:52.700
try to take 10% 20% in the one place that went up to like 30%.
I was like,
yeah,

333
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:57.170
I'm gonna give you a fucking a third of this.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I'm not doing it.

334
00:20:57.171 --> 00:20:58.580
Then I just stopped.
I stopped selling shit.

335
00:20:58.581 --> 00:21:01.190
That's why I don't go out there anymore.
All right.

336
00:21:01.191 --> 00:21:05.220
Although I am selling a poster on the store,
uh,

337
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:09.820
the president directed US Trade Representative Robert.
He lightened Heizer.

338
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:11.690
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

339
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:14.150
<v 1>Jesus Christ is he the great grandson of Robert E.
Lee.</v>

340
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.830
They changed the last name to announce a proposed list of products to be hit

341
00:21:18.831 --> 00:21:23.570
with tariff increases within 15 days after a public comp comment period.

342
00:21:23.571 --> 00:21:28.571
The final list is designed to target Chinese products that benefit from improper

343
00:21:28.701 --> 00:21:31.250
access to us.
Technology will be made public.

344
00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:36.080
The end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices.

345
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.400
Says Everett.

346
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

347
00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:43.000
<v 1>S e stat,
deputy assistant to the president for international economic affairs.</v>

348
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.940
Well,
why don't they tell the fucking corporations to be,
you know,

349
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:51.300
to fucking have a little backbone,
you know,

350
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.360
get together and be like,
Hey China,
you know,
you,
you,
you wanna,

351
00:21:54.361 --> 00:21:56.970
you wanna you wanna fucking sell these hacky sacks.

352
00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.190
We're not going to tell you how we make,

353
00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:02.220
you want to cut it up and try to figure it out.
That's on you.

354
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:03.840
But I'm not going to sit here and tell you.

355
00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.700
I don't know.
Who knows?
Has he met with that guy from Korea yet?

356
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.050
I was so excited about that.

357
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.210
The two fucking world leaders that didn't get along with each other.
Yes.

358
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.670
Sit down and talk it out.
You know,
I some food.

359
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.240
Fight him over.
Um,
come over here.
Show them a good time.

360
00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:26.030
Take them on space mountain then left memories.
There will be a,

361
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.560
I can't blow that up.
I had a good time.

362
00:22:27.561 --> 00:22:30.680
I met fucking Donald Duck and went on space mountain.

363
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:35.710
You know,
I gotta,
I gotta I gotta fucking hand job on and I,

364
00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.630
they have dead fucking pirates of Penzance,
right.
Whatever the hell it is.

365
00:22:38.631 --> 00:22:43.400
The Johnny Depp One.
Um,
I don't know.

366
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.980
I look forward to it.
I understand it.
You know,

367
00:22:45.981 --> 00:22:50.090
I've been sending everybody that fucking Michael McDonald does iron maiden and

368
00:22:50.091 --> 00:22:53.630
you know,
it kills me.
The amount of people that don't get it,
they were like,

369
00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.360
does he always sing like that?
But they don't get,
it's like the,

370
00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.810
you have to know iron maid and Michael McDonald.

371
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.590
Do you understand?
That's a wide berth.

372
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.950
If you listen to a word
and the church said

373
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.080
he wished he died,
I mean the odds

374
00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.950
for as much as people on social media,
oh,
he's trying to say that they have,

375
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:22.330
I have an eclectic,

376
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:23.440
<v 0>okay.</v>

377
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.140
<v 1>ECLECTIC taste in music.
Do remember that on my space.</v>

378
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.340
One person said that and then all of a sudden everybody was using that.

379
00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:34.620
I have very eclectic taste.
It was just as fucking way,
you know,

380
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.380
it's deliberate,

381
00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:39.710
carefully planned out way to show how fucking interesting you are.

382
00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.340
An open minded right.
Favorite albums,
uh,

383
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.540
back black and muppets take Manhattan.
I mean,

384
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:53.040
I'm all over the map.
Okay.
I don't see color man.

385
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:55.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

386
00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.840
<v 1>I actually think that social media,</v>

387
00:23:56.841 --> 00:24:01.841
as much as it's helped me go from the obscurities of featuring in comedy clubs

388
00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.670
to the heights of telling my shit jokes in three different continents at this

389
00:24:08.671 --> 00:24:09.504
point.

390
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:11.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

391
00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:13.150
<v 1>Um,
I actually still think it's a bad thing.</v>

392
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

393
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:19.560
<v 1>All right.
Because it before social media,
nobody said Freebie.</v>

394
00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:23.650
There were way less fake tits.
Um,

395
00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.580
speaking of which by the,
I can't,
I can't even figure out fucking Instagram.

396
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:33.270
I finally,
I posted a picture today and then I had to delete it because I,

397
00:24:33.271 --> 00:24:36.550
I thought like the next screen was going to be the thing where you write shit.

398
00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.570
So my wife tells me,
okay,
you got to delete it.
So I deleted and then I fucking,

399
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.420
um,
oh.
And then all those filters,

400
00:24:43.421 --> 00:24:45.400
what filter am I going to put on this fucking thing?

401
00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.590
And it actually makes you look better than you are.

402
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.990
You should see how green in Austin my shirt looks.

403
00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.960
It looks like fucking pea soup and real life.
But in that one,

404
00:24:52.961 --> 00:24:56.830
it look it look rich and bold,
patriotic.

405
00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.060
The whole fucking thing is a lie.
But I'll tell you what isn't a lie.

406
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.590
The picture that I took.

407
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.020
<v 0>Okay.</v>

408
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:04.853
<v 1>All right.</v>

409
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:10.120
With Henry Where Club Stephen Root and Alec Berg and uh,

410
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.400
Bill Hader was supposed to be there,

411
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.940
we were a nerd melt on sunset and they were promoting this incredible new show

412
00:25:20.901 --> 00:25:23.870
that is debuting this Sunday,
March 25th,

413
00:25:23.871 --> 00:25:28.610
I believe at eight o'clock eastern time.
And I'm

414
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.020
<v 0>yeah,</v>

415
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.860
<v 1>name of the show's berries,
but this Guy Barry,
he's an ass,</v>

416
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.210
he's a veteran from the Afghani war.

417
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:38.300
And when he comes back to the states,

418
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:42.710
a becomes a hit man and one of his hits is in La.

419
00:25:42.711 --> 00:25:44.630
He goes out to la and it's a long story.

420
00:25:44.631 --> 00:25:49.631
He ended up catching the acting bug and he's trying to transition out of

421
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.460
being a hitman and becoming an actor.

422
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.850
And I can't even tell you how in such a dark comedy,

423
00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.690
it's such a funny fucking show.
I cannot recommend this shown up.

424
00:26:00.691 --> 00:26:03.720
They sent me four episodes.
All right.

425
00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:08.880
And I am Jonesing for the last,
for the writing,
the acting,
everything.

426
00:26:08.881 --> 00:26:12.180
You have to fucking watch this show.
You have to watch this show.
You do not.

427
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.630
You come back on Monday,
you have,
you do fucking stare at the floor.

428
00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:19.590
You don't say good night to nobody.
Pope of Greenwich Village or anybody.

429
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.720
Um,
what am I?
Some kind of fucking asshole.
What Bank?

430
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:27.420
Um,
so anyways,

431
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.900
those three people and Bill Hader was supposed to be there and I was reading up

432
00:26:32.901 --> 00:26:36.410
on everybody.
So,
uh,
cause I haven't done a lot of these energy types of things.

433
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.790
So I was reading up on Bill Hader and they said how um,

434
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.890
one interesting fact about him,
he is the voice for the planner,
peanut guy,

435
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:48.090
<v 3>even though he has a peanut allergy.
So I'm sitting in the back thinking like,</v>

436
00:26:48.091 --> 00:26:52.830
Holy Shit,
I'm going to meet Henry Winkler it,

437
00:26:52.831 --> 00:26:56.940
my goal in this hour long interview is not once am I going to bring up happy

438
00:26:56.941 --> 00:27:00.870
days or the fonts,
right.
Steven roots there.

439
00:27:00.871 --> 00:27:03.000
I'm not bringing up that fucking red stapler.

440
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:07.470
I know both of these guys have answered these questions 4 million fucking times.

441
00:27:07.471 --> 00:27:11.130
I want to talk about the present and how amazing this God damn show us.

442
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.150
And um,
so I'm waiting for everybody to come in and at the last second,

443
00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:17.760
right before,
you know,
I'm nervous to do this interview.
I haven't,
you know,

444
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:21.270
he's a big fucking people and a,
and Alec Berg worked,

445
00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:25.080
worked on like two of my favorite shows,
um,

446
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.900
Caribbean throughZ ASM and silicone valley,

447
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.880
both high high level comedies.
And I was,
you know,
like I said,

448
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.370
a little intimidated to meet all these people and right before I'm going to go

449
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:38.880
out there,
they show up and they say,
Bill Hader can't make it.

450
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.720
He,
uh,
somebody puts some peanuts,
shit,

451
00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:47.610
like some all almond milk and he's fucking Starbucks coffee and his throat was

452
00:27:47.611 --> 00:27:52.140
swollen up.
He's fine.
The man is fine.
Um,
so now I'm sitting there like,

453
00:27:52.141 --> 00:27:52.974
oh fuck.

454
00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:58.120
Like I had so many questions to ask him and I'm not talking to Henry Winkler

455
00:27:58.121 --> 00:28:00.720
about happy days or Steven rude about the red state though.

456
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:04.710
What the fuck am I going to do?
And fortunately they were such great guests.

457
00:28:04.711 --> 00:28:06.240
They actually sort of carried me,

458
00:28:06.241 --> 00:28:09.840
was on Sirius Xm and there was um,

459
00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:15.430
I learned so much about acting and writing just talking to them.
Uh,

460
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:20.130
the through line with the three of them are just how open they were.
And um,

461
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:24.690
Henry Winkler has this,
this,
this combination that I've never seen.

462
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.600
I think I've ever seen it.
He's like the warmest,

463
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.740
nicest guy while being unbelievably driven

464
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:38.040
and just has giant balls as far as like,
you go in there,

465
00:28:38.041 --> 00:28:41.280
you make you fucking choices.
There is no wrong choice.

466
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.300
I don't give a fuck if this choice acting choices going to make me look stupid.

467
00:28:45.301 --> 00:28:48.690
I'm totally committed to it.
Usually people like that,

468
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.840
that driven with that much courage and all of that.

469
00:28:51.841 --> 00:28:56.250
Like literally they can be really a abrasive when you meet him,

470
00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:01.680
you know that just push and passion.
He's like the Nice fucking guy ever.

471
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:06.500
And listening to him talking about the like in the fact that he went in and you

472
00:29:06.501 --> 00:29:08.970
audition for it and all of that,
he wasn't sitting there going,
hey,

473
00:29:08.971 --> 00:29:11.640
I'm a fucking TV legend.
You should be happy to get me.

474
00:29:11.641 --> 00:29:14.430
He went in and auditioned for Steven Roots.
Another guy,

475
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:19.380
same thing talking about you go in,
you fucking audition,
you know,

476
00:29:19.381 --> 00:29:23.160
and I was getting advice from other people going,
hey man,
you're at a certain,

477
00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:25.620
once you were at a certain level you don't go in and read,

478
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.860
you know you should be getting offers like that fucking Hollywood shit.

479
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.500
And I talked to two of them.
You don't get better than those two guys.

480
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.070
And they both told me if you want the part you go in and read for it.

481
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.240
And I was just like,

482
00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:39.750
there is a fucking gem right there that I'm never going to forget.

483
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:42.080
So thank you to the two them for telling me that.

484
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.370
And then Alec was talking about,
um,
writing,

485
00:29:46.371 --> 00:29:49.520
which was fascinating to me because I've gotten to do it for the last three

486
00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:54.170
seasons on f is for family.
And uh,
up untilF is for family,

487
00:29:54.171 --> 00:29:57.410
I always wrote for myself,
so I heard it,

488
00:29:57.411 --> 00:29:59.510
I wrote it and then I said it the way I heard it.

489
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.060
And then all of a sudden on f is for family,

490
00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.870
I hear it a certain way and then we go to the table read and an actor does it

491
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:10.310
another way and there's a thing where you gotta be like,

492
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.290
he can't be like that asshole going like,
oh wait,

493
00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.070
you're supposed to clear your throat first and do it exactly the way I hear.

494
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:21.620
You have to have that thing where you just have to be open to the way they do
it.

495
00:30:21.621 --> 00:30:25.510
And thank God.
Thank God.
I,

496
00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:30.430
I think I kind of figured that out certainly with the fucking actors that we got

497
00:30:30.431 --> 00:30:31.720
on an f is for family.
It's like,

498
00:30:31.721 --> 00:30:35.320
I'm not going to tell these people to do anything any other way than the way

499
00:30:35.321 --> 00:30:39.430
they're doing it.
Um,
but just the way,
Alec,
I hope you guys can,

500
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.630
I don't know how it works.

501
00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:44.740
If you can go on Sirius Xm and downloaded the interview,

502
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:46.150
it seems like everything you didn't,
you didn't,

503
00:30:46.151 --> 00:30:49.870
you didn't have a miss anything anymore because it's still available.
But,
um,

504
00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:55.570
long story short with all this meandering is that show comes out this Sunday
and,

505
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:59.290
uh,
Bill Hader soon.
All this like,
you know,

506
00:30:59.291 --> 00:31:04.291
it's not just a straight up comedy like it's a really like dramatic dark show.

507
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.230
It's,
um,
I dunno,

508
00:31:08.231 --> 00:31:12.520
it Kinda has everything that I love and it reminded me of one of my favorite

509
00:31:12.521 --> 00:31:15.820
comedies.
I mentioned this a zillion times.
It's like midnight run.

510
00:31:15.821 --> 00:31:18.220
And I just loved that movie because

511
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.590
<v 0>okay.</v>

512
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.660
<v 3>Like it's crazy as it got,</v>

513
00:31:21.661 --> 00:31:25.500
everything was still rooted in a reality and it had a lot of heart and all of

514
00:31:25.501 --> 00:31:28.410
that type of stuff.
And I,
and this show has that,
I'm telling you,

515
00:31:28.411 --> 00:31:30.900
I'm calling it right now.
That shows going to be a big hit.

516

It's fucking Bill Hader,
Stephen Root,

517
00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.930
Henry Winkler.
I mean,
you can't go wrong.
You can't go wrong with that.
Um,

518
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.430
and the rest of the cast to the actors in the acting class that he gets into,
um,

519
00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:47.310
are all incredible.
Uh,

Hey,

533
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:20.240
It's a March 25th a Thursday.
And I know what you're thinking.

534
00:33:20.241 --> 00:33:23.990
Where the fuck was the podcast?
Um,

535
00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:27.920
on the 22nd that was in Europe and I brought my recorder but I've got the wire.

536
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:33.260
Um,
yeah,
so I fucked up,
but you know what,
where we're going to get through this,

537
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:37.020
my 14 listeners that I'm back down to over the,

538
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:42.200
this rough seven week fucking period as I try to get this thing back up and

539
00:33:42.201 --> 00:33:43.720
running again.
Um,

540
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.510
I do have a new web guy and um,

541
00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:52.520
he is since uploaded all of the podcasts from the beginning of time,

542
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:57.260
which is time began as far as I'm concerned in my podcast.

543
00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.910
Religion began in June of 2007.
All right.

544
00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:06.470
With one of my apostles,
Robert Kelly setting it up in his apartment.

545
00:34:06.471 --> 00:34:09.320
So all the podcasts,
this is what we're working on right now.
Okay.

546
00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:09.891
And all you guys,

547
00:34:09.891 --> 00:34:13.580
you sending me emails and everything in the trash for me and shit and uh,

548
00:34:13.581 --> 00:34:17.500
I actually appreciate the trashing because that means you care.
All right?

549
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:22.070
So don't worry.
Actually,
by the time you fucking listening to this thing,

550
00:34:22.071 --> 00:34:26.330
when you actually find it,
the problem is over.
Okay.
Uh,

551
00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:30.590
but for those of you who are actually in the bunker and have been able to find

552
00:34:30.591 --> 00:34:34.760
this fucking podcast,
um,
basically,
uh,

553
00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.610
we're going to have it all up on iTunes right now.

554
00:34:37.611 --> 00:34:41.120
I have like three different icons or whatever the fuck you spoke apps,

555
00:34:41.121 --> 00:34:43.370
whatever the hell you call him,
you that you can click on.

556
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:46.680
One is the old school podcast with [inaudible].

557
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.110
The other one is the one that I did on Libsyn for like fucking three weeks.

558
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:55.610
And I hated that.
And now I have my new one that I created.
I didn't create,

559
00:34:55.611 --> 00:34:59.300
I paid someone to create it.
See,
I'll see the white man does,
takes credit.

560
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.060
Um,
anyways,
um,

561
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.740
that I paid for someone else to create that I will now take the credit for and

562
00:35:06.741 --> 00:35:10.820
banish the person who created it to some terrible duty,

563
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:15.230
like they're doing the police.
Um,
and I'll take all credit for it,

564
00:35:15.231 --> 00:35:17.570
but there's going to be going to be one icon.
Okay.

565
00:35:17.571 --> 00:35:18.860
This is what we're working towards.

566
00:35:18.861 --> 00:35:22.250
And it's taken a while because we had to upload a couple of fucking years worth

567
00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:23.780
of podcasts and a,

568
00:35:23.781 --> 00:35:27.860
it's all going to be on one icon and you're going to click on,

569
00:35:27.861 --> 00:35:32.450
it's going to be the Monday morning podcast from right now all the way back to

570
00:35:32.451 --> 00:35:37.160
the beginning of time.
And I'm slowly starting my own religion because,

571
00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:41.560
uh,
those guys,
they don't get in trouble and they make a ton of money.
You know,

572
00:35:41.561 --> 00:35:46.120
he fucking raped 16,000 fucking kids and uh,
you know,

573
00:35:46.121 --> 00:35:49.210
no one's going to jail as far as I know,
maybe a couple of people are.

574
00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.550
I don't really,
you know,
I didn't really follow the story.
You know,

575
00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:57.010
I just heard people talking about it last night at the Improv and then I fucking

576
00:35:57.011 --> 00:36:01.510
throw my 2 cents in to the ad to the misinformation.
But anyways,

577
00:36:01.511 --> 00:36:04.660
all this shit is going to be a,
it's all gonna be under one umbrella,

578
00:36:04.661 --> 00:36:05.740
so it'll be nice and easy,

579
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:09.310
big stupid picture of myself and we'll be back to normal.
Okay.

580
00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:14.170
We had a little blip and our relationship,
okay.
You know,

581
00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.880
that happens in all relationships.
You know,

582
00:36:15.881 --> 00:36:18.580
every once in a while for a couple of weeks,
maybe you move out,

583
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.240
get your head straight,
maybe sleep on the couch a couple of nights.

584
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.380
That's what's going on here.
Nothing else.
All right.
I haven't quit doing them.

585
00:36:26.381 --> 00:36:27.020
But you know,
you know,

586
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.700
the one thing that has remained constant is I have been continuing to do the

587
00:36:30.701 --> 00:36:33.280
podcast,
granted,
you know,
two,

588
00:36:33.281 --> 00:36:38.140
three weeks to three days late on this one when I was over in Scotland,

589
00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:43.810
Dublin and London,
London,
England.
And um,

590
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.220
but before I get into all of that,
I'm a fan of the podcast,

591
00:36:48.221 --> 00:36:52.630
actually started a podcast page where you guys can go on there and look at some

592
00:36:52.631 --> 00:36:57.631
of my obscure references or look at the words that I mispronounce or whatever

593
00:36:58.121 --> 00:37:01.390
else.
I'm actually putting some questions on there that I want you guys to start

594
00:37:01.391 --> 00:37:05.710
answering and I'll read them here on the podcast.
What's the name of the site?

595
00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:09.190
Good fucking question.
I don't have it in front of me.
I'm winging it this week.

596
00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.180
It's a m M podcast.com I believe.

597
00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:18.210
Let me actually do this right now.
So I know I'm really gonna wing this one.
Uh,

598
00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.110
this is all going to be off the top of me.

599
00:37:20.111 --> 00:37:24.100
Head Christ said isn't even coming up and man podcast.

600
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:29.830
So what the fuck it is?
Hang on.
I'm typing with my middle finger.
Enter.

601
00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:34.000
What do we got?
You fucking cunt.
That isn't it.

602
00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:39.440
How about the,
Oh,

603
00:37:39.441 --> 00:37:42.350
you suck.
You know what?
I'm the fucking worst.

604
00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.160
Is it really that bad that people can't find this fucking podcast when I can't

605
00:37:46.161 --> 00:37:50.870
even have the fucking decency to be three days late and actually be prepared?

606
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.400
That's what it is.
I got in,
I found it,
uh,

607
00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.730
and I spelled it all right.
It's,
it's,
this is,
this is the fan page.

608
00:37:59.731 --> 00:38:04.440
It's the m M podcast.com.
That's what you want to go to.

609
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.610
And then you click it on and there's a picture of me and my fucking shaved head

610
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:13.110
and a big fucking picture of big foot.
Um,

611
00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:16.080
and then you scroll down and they got all the shit that I've,

612
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:18.720
that I've been talking about,
um,

613
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:21.270
on here and it's just going to keep getting bigger and bigger.

614
00:38:21.271 --> 00:38:24.180
That's what we're hoping for.
Gives you something else to do,

615
00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:26.700
rather than be at your fucking job hating your life.

616
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:29.100
That's what this podcast is all about.

617
00:38:29.101 --> 00:38:33.180
It's all about getting you through that first fucking awful day of the week,

618
00:38:33.181 --> 00:38:34.080
which is why,

619
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:38.840
and me of scoring my dates out in my stuff and trying to become a silent

620
00:38:38.841 --> 00:38:42.800
millionaire.
Um,
what does this silent millionaire,

621
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:46.370
I'll tell you what it is.
It's,
it's a fucking term that I just invented.

622
00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:51.230
What do think about that?
You know,
I could do that on this podcast.
Oh,

623
00:38:51.231 --> 00:38:54.860
speaking of which,
Robert Kelly,

624
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:58.640
one of the creators.
Other podcasts.
Hang on a second.

625
00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:00.410
Bobby Kelly.

626
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.770
<v 0>Yup.</v>

627
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.440
<v 3>Nothing.
I'm actually doing my podcast and I was talking about,</v>

628
00:39:05.441 --> 00:39:07.710
I was just talking about how you fucking,
uh,

629
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:13.000
helped me create the thing over in your apartment back in the beginning of time.

630
00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.760
I'm doing it right now as we speak,
but,
uh,
your voice is up against my ear,

631
00:39:19.761 --> 00:39:21.290
so you're still a,
you know,

632
00:39:21.291 --> 00:39:24.620
you can just talk about shit that we don't need people to know about unless you

633
00:39:24.621 --> 00:39:27.290
want to be.
Why didn't I fucking have you on when any of my podcasts?

634
00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.840
When do you go back to New York?
Oh,

635
00:39:31.841 --> 00:39:35.440
you fucking son of a bitch with your career.
What's the deal?

636
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.730
How are we going on a hike today?

637
00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.820
It's the gayest thing I've ever said on the podcast.
Um,

638
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.533
what's the deal?

639
00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.193
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

640
00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.620
<v 3>one o'clock is good.
Let me finish running my mouth and I'll see you over there,</v>

641
00:39:49.621 --> 00:39:50.454
right,

642
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.710
<v 0>right.</v>

643
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.350
<v 3>Bobby,
I'm doing a podcast and I'm boring people right now.</v>

644
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.370
I'm going to meet you there.
All right.

645
00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.180
We'll go rollerblading afterwards.
Okay,

646
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.900
I'll see you there at one.

647
00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.310
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

648
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:11.000
<v 3>he hung up on me like he should have.
Um,
that's right.</v>

649
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:13.550
I'm going on a hike with Robert Kelly.

650
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:19.850
I'm bringing in a fanny pack.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm gonna wear a headband.

651
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.200
Maybe tie a Bandana around one of my pasty thighs,
like Chachi on happy days.

652
00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.800
Maybe I'll do that shit.
I don't give a fuck.
It's the west coast.

653
00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:30.320
Nobody's paying attention.
This is not reason to,

654
00:40:30.321 --> 00:40:31.610
you know why nobody pays attention.

655
00:40:31.611 --> 00:40:35.900
Do you realize we are at the end of the fucking day,
not only,

656
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:40.610
not only in this country are we at the end of the fucking day.

657
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.760
Okay.
The,
they'll the world.

658
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:48.200
By the time we're done talking shit in a bar,

659
00:40:48.201 --> 00:40:51.620
the sun's already coming up in Japan starting the following fucking day.

660
00:40:51.621 --> 00:40:56.000
We haven't gone to bed yet.
Is it any wonder?
Everybody out here seems flaky.

661
00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.390
Do you know if I wake up at nine,
nine 30 out here?

662
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:03.080
It's already mid day back east.
Yes.
Bill.
We can do the math.
Well,

663
00:41:03.081 --> 00:41:05.870
some people can't,
you know.

664
00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:10.160
So what is the fucking point of me getting up and watching the news or reading a

665
00:41:10.161 --> 00:41:10.994
newspaper?

666
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.320
Because it's going to talk about yesterday and it's already fucking today and

667
00:41:15.321 --> 00:41:19.040
back east.
It's already fucking beyond halfway through the fucking day.

668
00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:24.640
That's my excuse.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,

669
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.490
this is the Monday morning podcast and I'm doing here on a Thursday.

670
00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.290
I will be doing another one on Monday.
I'll get caught up.
All right.

671
00:41:30.291 --> 00:41:34.700
Don't get mad.
Don't act like you guys.
Don't get behind in your lives.
You know,

672
00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:38.090
stuff starts to mount.
You know,
you can't deal with it.

673
00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:41.210
So you take a pill and then the next day,
you know,

674
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:46.010
maybe I'll take two pills and the next day you now you're fucking drooling on

675
00:41:46.011 --> 00:41:48.170
your fucking lazy boy.
That's how it goes down.

676
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.790
I don't even know what I'm going to talk about this week.
Well,

677
00:41:49.791 --> 00:41:53.930
let's talk about my trip to Europe.
Um,
it was unbelievable.

678
00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:58.850
It was an incredible success.
Uh,

679
00:41:58.851 --> 00:42:00.740
I don't know what the fuck it was.
I don't want as a one over there.

680
00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:05.600
Had a great time and people showed up and I had a great time.
Uh,

681
00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:10.130
the first place I went to was I went to,
um,
I went to London,

682
00:42:10.131 --> 00:42:14.900
England and uh,
I've always wanted to go there and I have to admit,
I,

683
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:18.860
when we landed at a Frau Ah,
Yay,

684
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:23.330
am sweating me roasting,
baking,
boiling.

685
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:27.860
It's like a sona.
I saw him,
I'd hey fro,

686
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:33.560
Yay.
Did a date night.
I saw him at a frau.
Sorry.

687
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.720
Anytime I say Heathrow I have to say hey fro,

688
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:37.640
and then I just start doing lines from sexy piece.

689
00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:40.160
Cause I love that fucking movie.
You know,

690
00:42:40.161 --> 00:42:43.240
I love that movie because they,
it's,

691
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:47.180
it's the best fucking a chick flick ever.

692
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.030
I've said this before and I'll fucking say it again.
Okay.

693
00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:53.270
Next time you girls like,
I swear like a romantic movie.

694
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:56.320
I'd like to see something.
You know it,

695
00:42:56.321 --> 00:43:00.290
it's been watching too many of these action movies.
It's like,
I don't like him,

696
00:43:00.291 --> 00:43:04.740
but I just want some difference in that kit.
Can I pick an APP?
Okay.

697
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.520
Can I pick it up?
Like you didn't fucking pick out every other one.

698
00:43:07.521 --> 00:43:11.270
Your fucking Twat.
You know what?

699
00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:14.990
Let me step up to the plate sweetheart.
All right.

700
00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:17.350
Once you unbutton another button on your fucking shirt,

701
00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:20.860
give me a little excitement on the way of the fucking video store and I'll pick

702
00:43:20.861 --> 00:43:25.040
out the romantic movie and you come out with sexy beast.
Oh my goodness.

703
00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.350
Sexy scandal.
This,
this isn't like a nine and a half weeks now,
bitch.

704
00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.560
It's a fucking love story.
Why do you guys have to call me that?

705
00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:37.030
Because you are a bitch.
No,
sorry.
Um,
okay.

706
00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.570
That's a fucking great stories about a guys do just,

707
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:43.530
he loves his woman and he has his own fucking place in the middle of nowhere and

708
00:43:43.531 --> 00:43:46.030
everything's going fucking gray.
Basically every,

709
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.850
if you ever watch a gangster movie,
uh,
you know,

710
00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:53.760
one of the reoccurring themes to the point that now it's become cliched is,

711
00:43:53.761 --> 00:43:58.590
is always the guy who is just going to do one more job and then he's getting

712
00:43:58.591 --> 00:44:03.360
out,
you know,
same thing in the Vietnam movies.
I got one more toward,
dude,

713
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:06.960
I'm short.
I shouldn't be on point on.
Right.

714
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.280
And you know what the fuck's going to happen to him.
Right.
And,
uh,

715
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:13.380
he didn't believe though the Wayans brothers and one of their movies made fun of

716
00:44:13.381 --> 00:44:15.480
those,
those,
uh,

717
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:20.220
those fucking around the way movies where there's the black guy who kid who's

718
00:44:20.221 --> 00:44:25.170
going to fucking go to college,
you know,
and he stayed strong.

719
00:44:25.171 --> 00:44:28.590
He didn't get in the game and then he walks up and he's fucking eating some ice

720
00:44:28.591 --> 00:44:31.560
cream and he gets shot in an alley or some shit.
I don't know what the happens,

721
00:44:31.561 --> 00:44:33.840
you know what I mean?
Um,
so anyways,

722
00:44:33.841 --> 00:44:38.730
this movie actually is about a couple of guys who succeeded.

723
00:44:38.731 --> 00:44:40.650
They did their last job,

724
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:45.120
they got their money and they got out of the fucking game and they're living in

725
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:45.954
Spain.

726
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:51.350
They're married to a couple of hot fucking bra and a,

727
00:44:51.631 --> 00:44:54.240
they don't have any kids.
So it's great.

728
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.850
And you know what you're doing when you don't have any fucking kids and you're

729
00:44:56.851 --> 00:44:59.370
married to a hot,
broad,
you're still fuck.

730
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:03.790
And your barbecue and your lay next to your pool gone.
I,
Yay.

731
00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.693
I'm sweating.

732
00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.440
Roast and bake and boil it just fucking chilling out,

733
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:15.780
having a great fucking time.
That's where the movie begins.
And then

734
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:21.120
trouble ensues and go fucking rented.
I love that goddamn movie.

735
00:45:21.121 --> 00:45:23.760
Every time I see it,
it gets better.
So anyways,

736
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.770
we landed at a fro watching telly.
Is this Stan?

737
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:34.080
I'm sorry.
It's just getting them noxious like the rest of it isn't.

738
00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:39.510
Um,
so,
uh,
we landed at a fro and uh,
we got in a cab,

739
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:43.110
you know,
and I started driving down the fucking other side of the road.
Huh?

740
00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.450
<v 5>Stereos or the other side.
We really are in England.
Yeah.</v>

741
00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:50.710
<v 3>And we're driving through and I'm looking at England and in London and you know</v>

742
00:45:50.711 --> 00:45:55.210
what?
I'm not liking it.
I'm like,
look at this fucking Shitty town.

743
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:58.900
I just,
it just,
it didn't appeal to me.

744
00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:02.770
And I think the real thing was I was jet lagged because I ended up loving it,

745
00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:06.940
but I was fucking really jetlagged and uh,

746
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:10.320
my girlfriend's going to kill me if I tell this story.
Uh,

747
00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:13.780
this is basically the space.
What happened?
I got a first class ticket over there,

748
00:46:13.781 --> 00:46:18.340
right.
But it was basically from New Jersey to,
to London,

749
00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:23.020
a frail,
a frail,
um,
airport.

750
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.870
And this is what has happened my entire career.

751
00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:31.300
Every time I get a first class fucking ticket,
which is rare,

752
00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.000
I get a first class fucking 10.

753
00:46:34.001 --> 00:46:36.820
Let me answer the answer that question before he get like,
Bill,

754
00:46:36.821 --> 00:46:39.850
you at the point where you fly first class,
you have a,
where you go,

755
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:43.630
not even fucking close.
Okay.

756
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:46.810
Most of those people that you see in first class,

757
00:46:46.811 --> 00:46:49.270
they got bumped up because they fly so much,

758
00:46:49.271 --> 00:46:54.070
because I'm going to tell you a fucking first class ticket is 1200 to 1500 bucks

759
00:46:54.071 --> 00:46:58.870
a month.
All right?
So if I buy two of those a month,

760
00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.370
that's like an extra,

761
00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:05.580
it's fucking three grand on my credit card as opposed to like fucking 600 bucks,

762
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:11.790
700 or whatever the two coach tickets and you know that adds up.

763
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.440
All right?
Times 12 months.
That's 36 fucking grand.

764
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:22.540
Just so you can get on the plane first and fucking stretch your legs out,
right?

765
00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:27.130
So basically the only time I fly first class is,
uh,

766
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:30.160
is if they hook me up.
Other than that,

767
00:47:30.161 --> 00:47:34.690
I'll fucking sit in the back with my knees against my chest.

768
00:47:34.691 --> 00:47:37.840
I don't give a shit.
I got the whole thing worked out.
This is how I do it.

769
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:40.060
All right?
This is how I do it.

770
00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:45.810
First thing I do when I sit down is I take my wallet out of my back pocket

771
00:47:46.811 --> 00:47:50.440
because I'm one of these guys that has like nine years of business cards,

772
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.760
bank receipts,
case Sheesh,
all this shit in my wallet.

773
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:58.420
And right off the bat it's just so fucked up.

774
00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:02.080
It's fucking on one ass cheek.

775
00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:07.120
So it's fucking messes up behind my back,
my alignment and a,

776
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:09.100
if I sit on,
sit on it too hard,

777
00:48:09.101 --> 00:48:13.810
it's like sitting on a fucking stone and it makes me bum a little sensitive.

778
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.990
So I take that fucker out,
I stick it in my front pocket,

779
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.260
and then I just make sure every couple hours I get up,

780
00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:24.700
I always get an aisle seat,

781
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:28.600
which sucks because people are going to crawl over you.
But uh,
you know,

782
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:30.700
I don't like being that guy.
When I got to take a leak in,

783
00:48:30.701 --> 00:48:33.670
the person next to me has their laptop out and then they do that.

784
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:40.330
We'll fucking get a first class ticket.
You do have get an aisle seat.

785
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:45.550
Who's your fucking travel agent?
We just sitting in the middle.
Um,
so anyways,

786
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:50.050
I get up every couple hours and I do a little mini yoga thing down the back of

787
00:48:50.051 --> 00:48:52.420
the plane.
You know,
I just do it.

788
00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:57.450
I got this little whole stretching routine that I do because I fly so fucking

789
00:48:57.461 --> 00:48:57.940
much.

790
00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:01.720
And that's how much your first class ticket is that I would rather sit in the

791
00:49:01.721 --> 00:49:06.721
back with my wallet in my front pocket doing yoga back near the shitter.

792
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:09.630
That's how expensive FirstClass is.
So anyway,

793
00:49:09.631 --> 00:49:14.530
so I get this first class ticket from Jersey,
Newark,

794
00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:18.310
New Jersey to uh,
to London in a fro donate,

795
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:22.420
uh,
London,
England and a,

796
00:49:22.421 --> 00:49:25.240
this is what has always happened whenever I've gotten a first class,

797
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:29.770
at least half the fucking time when I'm getting,
when I'm flying first class,

798
00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:33.730
it means I'm going someplace that's awesome or the Gig is going to be awesome.

799
00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:38.260
And what always ends up happening is somebody else wants to fucking go.

800
00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:43.380
And then they always go,
dude,
you're giving you first glazed chicken.
You know,

801
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:45.370
was you anyway?
Like,
you know,

802
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:50.790
maybe you could just take a biome good to fucking coach tickets.

803
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:55.900
So basically half the times I've gotten a first class ticket,

804
00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:58.810
I haven't gotten a fly first class.
I'm sitting back there with,

805
00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:02.260
with a manager or a fucking agent or,

806
00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:07.280
or who knows what a buddy who wants to come along to go check out the gig

807
00:50:07.331 --> 00:50:10.360
because it's going to be awesome.
So I never get to fly.

808
00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.770
So long story fucking short is a,
you know,

809
00:50:14.771 --> 00:50:18.610
I spent five months on the road getting ready for,
to tape a let it go,

810
00:50:18.611 --> 00:50:22.520
which by the way,
looks fucking awesome.
I was just looking at,

811
00:50:22.521 --> 00:50:26.630
that's my new special coming out.
So anyways,
I um,

812
00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.450
you know,
I,
I never get to fly first class,
so I get,
I get,

813
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:33.520
I just totally lost my train of thought.

814
00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:38.200
So you look@oneweekoffoflumosity.com and uh,
my brain's fucking up.

815
00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:43.050
Yeah.
So this is the deal.
So I got a first class ticket to go to fucking,
uh,

816
00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:48.000
from New Jersey to a London,
right a fro.
And uh,

817
00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:52.830
my girl goes,
I go,
can I go?

818
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:58.580
Oh,
you're going some place fun.
She only wants to go to the fun places.

819
00:50:58.581 --> 00:51:02.360
She doesn't come to like fucking,
you know,
Pittsburgh when I need her

820
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:07.160
fucking Madison,
Wisconsin.
She doesn't want to go on those.

821
00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:11.750
I'm going to Mount Miami.
Then all of a sudden it's like,
oh my God,
I love Miami.

822
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.850
Of course you do.
Who Does it?

823
00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:19.160
What do you need from me?
I need you to love Cincinnati.

824
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:23.120
That's what the fuck I need from you.
Why don't you come on those trips?

825
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:26.900
That's when I fucking need you.
So anyway,
she's going to Europe,
right?

826
00:51:26.901 --> 00:51:29.150
There's not,
you know,
if there's no fucking way,
of course I'm going to take her.

827
00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:33.650
So this deal,
I spent five months on the fucking road with my knees to my chest,

828
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.690
my wallet,
my front fucking pocket,

829
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:40.280
going in the back doing fucking yoga because I had to make sure I had a great

830
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:40.711
special.

831
00:51:40.711 --> 00:51:43.940
And of course they ended up catching a cold and I did my special with dayquil.

832
00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:45.380
That's a whole nother story.

833
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:47.170
<v 0>Okay?</v>

834
00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:51.610
<v 3>So basically,
you know,
41 year old guy,
my body's fucking junk.</v>

835
00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:56.880
This is my first time going to the U K and then over to Dublin and then back to

836
00:51:57.371 --> 00:52:01.660
fucking Scotland.
Uh,
which I believe,
you know,
I'm a little confused.
Well,
exactly.

837
00:52:01.661 --> 00:52:04.360
What is Great Britain and what is the United Kingdom?

838
00:52:04.361 --> 00:52:07.840
It's really fucking confusing.
It got so many goddamn aliases over there.

839
00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:12.070
All right.
As far as I understand,
Great Britain is England,

840
00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:16.350
Wales and Scotland,
and maybe even the top adult,
uh,

841
00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.280
of Ireland with a,

842
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:23.860
the fuck was all those Goddamn fucking fight Belfast.

843
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:28.000
Okay.
Is that,
uh,

844
00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:33.100
is that the United is the United Kingdom?
That is great.
Britain.

845
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:35.830
Just England and fucking Wales.

846
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:40.570
Is that Great Britain or as Great Britain in England,
Wales and fucking Scotland.

847
00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:44.490
Why don't I look at it?
I didn't look it up.
Fuck you.

848
00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:46.120
This is my question for the week.
What it,

849
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.520
what's the difference between the United Kingdom and,
and,
and,
uh,

850
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:53.820
Great Britain?
Because before I went over there,

851
00:52:53.821 --> 00:52:55.350
I wanted to learn some of the countries over there,

852
00:52:55.351 --> 00:52:57.210
so I didn't come off as a dumb ass American.

853
00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.450
Then I found out there was 50 countries and I was like,
all right,
fuck it.

854
00:53:00.451 --> 00:53:05.250
I'll just learn it over to like Greece,
Romania,
Ukrainia,
Lithuania,

855
00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:09.630
all the Amy's Russia,
half of Georgia,
half a Turkey.

856
00:53:09.631 --> 00:53:12.250
And then once you get to Cag is Stan go fuck yourself over the hell are you

857
00:53:12.251 --> 00:53:13.740
saying?
Um,

858
00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:17.880
I was under the impression that England was a country.

859
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:22.050
And then when I was looking at the names of country,
it didn't say that.

860
00:53:22.051 --> 00:53:25.660
It said Great Britain,
Great Britain is a country.

861
00:53:25.661 --> 00:53:28.750
What does that include and what does the United Kingdom,

862
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:32.440
the rest of Ireland isn't part of it.
Is it all right?
Yeah,
I dunno,

863
00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:35.970
you little ass fucking pieces of land over there.

864
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.750
Maybe you guys got a band together,
you know,

865
00:53:37.751 --> 00:53:41.560
like a bunch of fucking Cubans coming over here on a refrigerator door floating

866
00:53:41.561 --> 00:53:46.120
over to fucking the keys,
you know,
I don't know.

867
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:47.890
So anyways,
so this is the deal.

868
00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:52.510
So I get a first class ticket from Jersey day for out London and uh,

869
00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:56.740
my girl wants to go.
So once again,
I'm in that situation,

870
00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:02.020
I mean that situation.
And it's like,
you know what,

871
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:07.300
I got to put my foot down.
I finally did.
I said,
look,

872
00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:11.770
this is much fun as we're going to have over there and everything.

873
00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:15.070
This is a business trip.
I have to go over there,

874
00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.320
I have to be fucking relaxed.

875
00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:22.210
I'm already going to be jet lagged and I have to hit three home runs in a

876
00:54:22.211 --> 00:54:25.030
fucking row.
I got to kill in London,

877
00:54:25.031 --> 00:54:29.730
I got to kill in Dublin and I got to kill in glazed.
Um,

878
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.221
all right,

879
00:54:30.221 --> 00:54:33.460
so as much as you want to run around and go buy some trinkets and shit,

880
00:54:33.461 --> 00:54:38.320
I have to be rested up for this stuff.
So,
uh,
this is the deal.

881
00:54:38.321 --> 00:54:41.700
I will fly coach with you to Jersey.
And then,
uh,
um,

882
00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:46.060
going up first class to England and I put her in the back,

883
00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.870
left her in the back and uh,
you know,

884
00:54:49.871 --> 00:54:53.200
there was some rough waters trying to convince her of that.

885
00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:56.800
And I was like,
look,
this is the deal.
I'm gonna go over there.

886
00:54:56.801 --> 00:54:59.920
I'm going to fucking hit.
And then when a I fucking blow up over there,

887
00:54:59.921 --> 00:55:03.760
I'll fly both over there first fucking class.
So,

888
00:55:03.761 --> 00:55:06.400
because my girl's fucking the shit,
she said fine.

889
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:07.940
<v 0>Okay.</v>

890
00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:09.260
<v 3>So I'm like that shit man.</v>

891
00:55:09.261 --> 00:55:13.610
You see that Shit Mack Daddy fucking pimp got what the fuck I wanted and then

892
00:55:13.611 --> 00:55:15.890
this is what's funny.
Two days before we go to leave,

893
00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:21.020
I get hit with this fucking wave of guilt.
Oh wait a second.
By the way.

894
00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:25.040
Um,
I looked into getting her first class fucking ticking.
You know what?

895
00:55:25.041 --> 00:55:29.090
These fucking cunts or they want to like fucking five grand

896
00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:34.910
just from Jersey.
It's fucking ridiculous.
It's so fucking,

897
00:55:34.911 --> 00:55:36.950
it's so fucking ridiculous.

898
00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.220
Why is it 1500 to fly 2,800 miles,

899
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:44.570
but then all of a sudden 3000 miles are a little over 3,300 miles because I'm

900
00:55:44.571 --> 00:55:48.880
going to a different country.
They all of a sudden your foot,

901
00:55:48.881 --> 00:55:52.720
you'll make it like three and a half times the fucking price.
So I can't do that.

902
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:57.180
I go over there,
I'm going to lose a couple of grant.
So I just,
you know,
fuck it.

903
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:59.200
She complained.
She complained a little bit and I go,

904
00:55:59.201 --> 00:56:02.620
are you complaining about a free fucking ticket to Europe?

905
00:56:02.621 --> 00:56:03.730
Is that what you're doing right now?

906
00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:09.690
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

907
00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:13.950
<v 3>So anyways,
I ended up feeling fucking guilty and a whatever.</v>

908
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.080
So I got her some DVDs.

909
00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:25.120
Ah,
so you finally landed in eighth ro and I,

910
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:28.060
we get off the plane and I wait for him and shit.
And I noticed that she's,

911
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.940
you know,
kind of giving me the cold shoulder or whatever.
I'm like,

912
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:33.940
what's the problem?
And I've,

913
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:36.550
I can't remember how it went because I was so fucking tired and she was pissed

914
00:56:36.551 --> 00:56:40.630
because I didn't go back to see her during the flight,
you know,

915
00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.840
come back there and we went,
what were we going to talk about?

916
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.460
I was going to come back to it and be like,
yeah,
hey,

917
00:56:45.461 --> 00:56:49.960
there's just flying coach still suck.
All right.
I was just checking,

918
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:53.770
you know,
cause it kinda seemed like it's shot from La to,
to New Jersey,

919
00:56:53.771 --> 00:56:56.530
but I was wondering,
maybe it got better.

920
00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:02.860
I'm actually in defense myself.
I tried to go back there,
but they had a,

921
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:05.530
uh,
a velvet rope.
Okay.

922
00:57:05.531 --> 00:57:08.170
And I'm not saying that they had a bunch of Janet Jackson's CDs there.

923
00:57:08.171 --> 00:57:12.490
They actually had a velvet rope there and I was not allowed to go past there.

924
00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:17.060
And I said,
fine.
All right.
So I got out of that one,
so whatever.

925
00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:22.450
All right.
So he landed a fro and,
uh,

926
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.590
we get in the fucking car,

927
00:57:23.591 --> 00:57:26.650
we drive over to the hotel and I'm just looking at it going,
this looks a little,

928
00:57:26.651 --> 00:57:30.610
a very gray,
very overcast.

929
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:35.020
And it was disappearing into a lot of gray buildings.
And I'm like,
what the fuck?

930
00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:39.850
I don't like this.
And,
um,
then I,
you know,

931
00:57:39.851 --> 00:57:44.470
and I took a fucking nap and then I woke up and then we did what New Yorkers

932
00:57:44.471 --> 00:57:46.990
fucking do.
All right.

933
00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:51.430
We don't take tours and I do consider myself a fucking New Yorker,
but not,
no,

934
00:57:51.431 --> 00:57:53.830
I don't,
not affiliated with any of their sports teams,

935
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.180
but I lived there for fucking 12 years and I loved it.
And,
uh,

936
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:59.830
this is what New Yorkers do when we go to a fucking new city.

937
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:01.960
Public Transportation Baby.

938
00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:06.010
Show me where you fucking subway is and I'll do it that way.
We had a company,

939
00:58:06.011 --> 00:58:09.010
you know,
Big Ben Parliament,
Bang,
zoom.

940
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:13.660
Then we just walk the fuck around and we find the cool places to go to.

941
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:18.040
All right.
We don't go to the dumb shit.
Like one of my buddies,

942
00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:22.310
when you go to Dublin,
go to temple bar,
there's the fucking place to go.
Yes,

943
00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:26.020
I'm going to have a drink with some guy from Cleveland.
You fucking moron.

944
00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:28.760
Go where all the tourists go.
I've,

945
00:58:28.761 --> 00:58:33.761
I've never fucking understood why he would go on vacation to then hang out with

946
00:58:34.151 --> 00:58:37.870
a bunch of other douche bags who aren't from where the fuck you're going.

947
00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:40.720
So what,
what experience do you gain there?

948
00:58:40.721 --> 00:58:45.610
What somebody from Rhode Island is like in London?
It's the dumbest shit ever.

949
00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:50.080
Okay.
You want to see a couple of things,
like when I got to admit,

950
00:58:50.081 --> 00:58:53.500
when I saw Big Ben,
it was,
it was fucking awesome.

951
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:58.360
I've seen pictures of that.
And you know,
I'm a,
I love watching Wimbledon,

952
00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.780
Wimbledon.
I for years,
I've been saying Wimbleton yet,

953
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:06.840
yet another word that I'd been mispronouncing a o n Wimble ton,

954
00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:10.120
but it's Wimble done deal.
And Wimbledon,

955
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:14.020
they just say it too fucking fast for my dummy or is to pro actually not my

956
00:59:14.021 --> 00:59:17.150
dummy is my brain's too dumb to process the signals from my years.

957
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:20.020
I think my ears are okay.
But anyways,
um,

958
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:25.490
so then that's what we did.
So I saw a big Ben and it was just fucking iconic.

959
00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:25.960
Who,

960
00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:29.240
who's the shit all his years watching Wimbledon breakfast at Wimbledon and then

961
00:59:29.241 --> 00:59:32.390
they,
they always show big Ben and um,

962
00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:38.810
it was incredible.
And,
uh,
got a a,
what else the fuck did I do?
Oh,
I know.

963
00:59:38.811 --> 00:59:41.960
I want it to that the,
toward the two,
uh,

964
00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:46.160
the fucking Abbey road studios fell through.
It's a long fucking story.

965
00:59:46.161 --> 00:59:48.680
They couldn't do it Wednesday and by when they wanted to do a Thursday,

966
00:59:48.681 --> 00:59:50.750
I was doing radio and it just didn't fucking work out,

967
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:54.260
so I'll have to do that next time.
But,
uh,
so it was like,
all right,

968
00:59:54.261 --> 00:59:56.870
that didn't work out.
Um,

969
00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:59.810
I have to go see Royal Royal Albert Hall.

970
01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:03.680
Now for those of you who are led Zeppelin fans,
you know,

971
01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.690
the importance of that building.
And if you got there,

972
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:10.520
there last DVD that came out,

973
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:14.270
it has this fucking unbelievable concept that they gave at Royal Albert Hall.

974
01:00:14.271 --> 01:00:18.680
And I always wanted to go there.
It's really difficult to save Royal Albert Hall.

975
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.540
And uh,
it was something that was built,
I believe by the Queen Victoria.

976
01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:27.080
Did I just say this?
Queen Victoria is this fucking broad Queen Victoria.

977
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:29.270
She was into this guy,
uh,

978
01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:34.100
prince fucking Albert and I guess they were unbelievably in love with each other

979
01:00:34.101 --> 01:00:36.290
and the way that they express love was they,

980
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.230
they bought pieces of art with the money from the poor.

981
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:44.390
That's what they did.

982
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:49.570
They were so in love that rather than taking all the fucking disgusting amount

983
01:00:50.721 --> 01:00:55.700
of taxes from the poor people and using it to feed them,
they said,
no,

984
01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:58.820
let's spend it lavishly on ourselves

985
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:02.660
in this unbelievable art collection that we,

986
01:01:02.661 --> 01:01:06.290
and we alone can sit here and stare at it.
It's just fucking,
I dunno,

987
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:10.340
that whole royalty thing is hilarious to me.
So,
uh,
yeah,

988
01:01:10.341 --> 01:01:15.260
that's what they did.
And uh,
I dunno.

989
01:01:15.261 --> 01:01:18.350
And then Prince Albert,
uh,
he caught the clap,

990
01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:22.910
which evidently was fatal back in the day.
He cheated on her,

991
01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.910
but she still loved him.
And uh,
something like that.

992
01:01:25.911 --> 01:01:27.620
I didn't really read the story.
He can look it up.

993
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:29.880
I don't know what the fuck he got.
He got like,
what did,

994
01:01:29.881 --> 01:01:32.600
what did you die of in the 18 hundreds?
The mumps,

995
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.910
he got to Berkeley,
so he got something.
Okay.

996
01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.760
And he was fucking victorie out and the great lawn in some mosquito bit him.

997
01:01:44.131 --> 01:01:47.270
And next thing you know,
he had typhoid fever.
I don't know.
He died suddenly.

998
01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.380
So she was overcome with grief.
And a lot of people say she never got over it.

999
01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:56.960
And what she did was she built this big fucking statue of this guy.

1000
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:59.840
Well that actually is not gold plated,

1001
01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:03.260
but gold leaf or Fleck,
I don't know what the,

1002
01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:07.590
it's as actual fucking gold in it and it's got a big,
um,

1003
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:09.300
opulent roof to it.

1004
01:02:09.301 --> 01:02:12.890
So the pigeons can't shit on the guy and you know why yet again,

1005
01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.580
yet again to express her love for another human being.

1006
01:02:16.581 --> 01:02:17.960
Why would you help other human beings?

1007
01:02:17.961 --> 01:02:21.780
Let's spend more of the poor money on this.
This,
it's pretty impressive.

1008
01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:25.050
Not going to lie to you.
So anyways,
went over,

1009
01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:29.610
we saw that shit and they were actually giving a tour of Royal Albert Hall.

1010
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.530
So I wanted to go and it was an hour delay.
And my girl hates tours.

1011
01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.690
She's a fucking New Yorker.
She's like,

1012
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:39.310
oh with God it could folk and figure it out myself bored.

1013
01:02:39.311 --> 01:02:42.570
It's a fucking building.
So Mike,
can we just,
can you just for me?

1014
01:02:42.571 --> 01:02:47.570
Can we just fucking do this?
So she's like,
fine.
So long story short,
mate,

1015
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:52.670
we ended up going on the bloody Tila and a just so happens that the London

1016
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.450
Philharmonic is practicing in there.

1017
01:02:57.451 --> 01:03:00.690
I don't know for a Gig later on that night or the next day,
I have no idea what.

1018
01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:06.320
So the guy brings us in there and we walk in two boxes down,

1019
01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:13.440
um,
from where the queen's boxes.
Okay,

1020
01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:18.480
I'm waiting for the beef [inaudible] and butthead laughing.
He said,
Queen Xbox,

1021
01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:19.753
um,

1022
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:25.040
the box with a queen sits in the just basically unbelievable seats and we come

1023
01:03:25.981 --> 01:03:30.981
walking in and as we sit down and take in basically the most beautiful theater

1024
01:03:32.251 --> 01:03:36.450
I've ever seen in my life,
the beauty of the theater,

1025
01:03:36.451 --> 01:03:37.620
right as we sit down,

1026
01:03:37.621 --> 01:03:40.770
the orchestra begins playing as if they were waiting for us.

1027
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.760
And it was so unbelievably beautiful and so overwhelming that my girlfriend

1028
01:03:47.101 --> 01:03:50.520
actually started to cry.
So,

1029
01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:55.550
and I started laughing at my girlfriend crying because I was actually afraid

1030
01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:59.520
that I was going to get emotional.
That's how fucking unbelievable it was.

1031
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.880
It was incredible.
And it was in that moment I was like,
fuck this.

1032
01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:04.410
I have to see a concert here.

1033
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.530
It was in credit and everybody was basically on our tour,

1034
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:12.460
was sitting there with like,
I,
I don't,

1035
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:15.630
I don't have the ability to describe the sound.

1036
01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:19.710
It was the most unbelievable sound I've ever heard in my life and it actually

1037
01:04:19.711 --> 01:04:24.510
made me less cynical.
That's how beautiful it was.
I actually felt,
I actually,

1038
01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:31.110
what the fuck was I going to,
how do I put this?
It was like,
I,
you know,

1039
01:04:31.111 --> 01:04:33.750
I'm real cynical when I think of people,
I think that pieces of shit,

1040
01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:36.120
they fucking lie.
They're greedy,

1041
01:04:36.121 --> 01:04:38.610
they're weak cowardice and all that fucking thing.

1042
01:04:38.611 --> 01:04:41.430
And then you just see this group of people and this building,

1043
01:04:41.431 --> 01:04:45.570
like everything was perfect.
The p the,
the construction of it,
the,

1044
01:04:45.571 --> 01:04:47.550
the way they decorated it and the,

1045
01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:51.900
whoever wrote the music and then all the gifted people playing it.
And we was,

1046
01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:55.290
it was,
it was fucking unbelievable.
We will all just sitting there,

1047
01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:00.650
it was like something that I will never forget.
And then he fucking,

1048
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.440
10 seconds later,
the tour guys like,
all right,
we gotta go,
we gotta go.

1049
01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:09.000
No one wanted to go.
And then he's like out in the hall,
gone.

1050
01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.630
And then this wall here was constructed by Henry the fucking eighth.

1051
01:05:12.631 --> 01:05:14.040
And it was like nobody gives a fuck.

1052
01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:18.760
We want to go back in there and listen to the band.
It was unreal.
So what,

1053
01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:23.440
what happened was we've just kept going to these room to the green room where

1054
01:05:23.441 --> 01:05:28.441
the queen hangs out and has her royal Bush trimmed or whatever the fuck they do.

1055
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:29.951
And then we would,

1056
01:05:29.951 --> 01:05:32.560
we would be in a different part of the theater and we would dip in,
we would,

1057
01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:36.340
we would listen to them play again.
And uh,
this is the thing,

1058
01:05:36.341 --> 01:05:40.980
you were not allowed to take video in the place,
but,
uh,

1059
01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.880
fortunately I'm an ignorant American and I didn't give a fuck and I brought a

1060
01:05:45.881 --> 01:05:49.010
little,
uh,
when those little flip cameras in there and I actually,
uh,

1061
01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:53.140
I got some video footage in there that I will be putting up on my website.
Um,

1062
01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:56.610
I'm just going to try to edit it all together.
Um,

1063
01:05:56.650 --> 01:06:01.060
actually follow through on this and make a nice video of my trip to Europe.
But,

1064
01:06:01.061 --> 01:06:05.350
uh,
I got to tell you guys something right fucking now.
Okay.

1065
01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:10.300
Fuck going to seaworld.
Fuck the San Diego Zoo.

1066
01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:12.820
Fuck all of that shit.
Fuck.

1067
01:06:12.821 --> 01:06:17.821
Going to Chicago and going to the top of the Sears tower and going to Wrigley

1068
01:06:17.921 --> 01:06:22.090
field.
That shit's all going to be there.
You fucking live here.

1069
01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:26.620
All right.
No biggie.
You can drive to all of those things.

1070
01:06:26.621 --> 01:06:30.730
Let me tell you some saved your fucking money.
Who gives a shit?

1071
01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:33.940
It's not worth anything.
Anyways,
get yourself a ticket at some point.

1072
01:06:33.941 --> 01:06:38.530
Go look up Royal Albert Hall.
If you're into classical music.
They have,
uh,

1073
01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.820
they call them prom shows.
I don't know what that was short for,
but uh,

1074
01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:45.400
they have like this,
this like month or two,

1075
01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:49.120
six week period where they just have all these orchestras come in.

1076
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:52.600
If you're into classical music.
I saw another concert in October.

1077
01:06:52.601 --> 01:06:56.530
Jeff Beck is playing there.
You know that guys,
you know,
it's weird.

1078
01:06:56.531 --> 01:06:58.900
He's getting up there in years and he's at the Primers,
Korea.

1079
01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:02.470
Basically what I'm saying,
if you're a music lover,
at some point in your life,

1080
01:07:02.471 --> 01:07:05.050
if you are,
if you have any even into just fucking architecture,

1081
01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:08.050
you have to go see a show there.
Okay.

1082
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:12.790
I'm telling you it was fucking unbelievable.
All right.
And that's it.

1083
01:07:12.791 --> 01:07:16.450
That's it for that shit.
All right.
Um,
unbelievable.

1084
01:07:16.451 --> 01:07:21.451
So I'm going to try to get back their book a Gig and uh,

1085
01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:25.000
I have to see,
I have to see,
and I would fucking see anybody there.

1086
01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.420
Oh Wow.
That's it.
Okay.
Let's,
let's be fucking honest.

1087
01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.020
I got to admit Jay Z and Beyonce where there,

1088
01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:35.770
I wouldn't want to see Jay z at Royal Albert Hall.
I just wouldn't,

1089
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:37.331
you know,

1090
01:07:37.331 --> 01:07:42.220
I was actually picturing led Zepplin there and like the place was so beautiful.

1091
01:07:42.221 --> 01:07:45.880
It almost seemed like fucking a offensive,

1092
01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:50.080
you know,
for them to be singing the lemons song,

1093
01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:57.980
talking about singing poetically about getting your Dick sucked and someplace

1094
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.730
that beautiful.
Now I'm not shitting on Jay Z or anything.

1095
01:08:00.731 --> 01:08:04.300
I think that guy's a fucking genius,
but you know what I mean?
Like,

1096
01:08:04.301 --> 01:08:07.240
I don't think that I,
like if I ever got a gig there,

1097
01:08:07.241 --> 01:08:10.030
I'd want to do it just cause zeppelins bend this and Natera,

1098
01:08:10.031 --> 01:08:14.650
Jay z and all these guys,
these unbelievable artists.
But for me to go up there,

1099
01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.200
the I curse,
it just wouldn't be right.

1100
01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:22.180
Uh,
you know,

1101
01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:26.950
this is why you travel the world is you get you two reasons why you travel.
Okay.

1102
01:08:26.951 --> 01:08:31.951
One is to see all the unbelievable things that are out there and realize how

1103
01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:34.660
much more there is than what you thought there was.

1104
01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.770
And then two on the other side is to realize,
you know,

1105
01:08:38.771 --> 01:08:42.010
as you start to get homesick,
why you love where you live.

1106
01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:45.010
Because that definitely happened because I got to admit,

1107
01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.650
I fucking went hardcore with the food over there.

1108
01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.190
I kept getting the traditional English breakfast,

1109
01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:53.080
that traditional Irish breakfast.

1110
01:08:53.081 --> 01:08:57.130
I got a traditional Scottish breakfast and I'm telling you,
dude,

1111
01:08:57.131 --> 01:09:02.131
it's fucking like how those people are still walking around past the age of 40.

1112
01:09:02.831 --> 01:09:07.210
It's fucking unreal.
Traditional English breakfast was eggs.

1113
01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:13.060
A sausage or bangers is a column.
Um,

1114
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:17.080
Bacon Bacon is more like Canadian Bacon,

1115
01:09:17.081 --> 01:09:19.810
where it looks like you took the zest of a pig

1116
01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:26.200
with a big greater,
and just took a fucking shingle of pig and throw it in,

1117
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:30.940
throw it into a frying pan.
So you got the fucking sausage,

1118
01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:35.020
the shingle of pig,
and then you had luck,
pork and beans.

1119
01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:38.910
And then,
uh,
I dunno,
something else,
Eh,

1120
01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:43.990
I got to tell you all that fucking pork,
basically two helpings of pork,

1121
01:09:44.230 --> 01:09:48.880
three helpings of fucking pork,
sausage,
sausage,

1122
01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:54.160
Canadian Bacon style to the 10th power in pork and beans with eggs.

1123
01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:59.380
And then toast,
you know,
then you have a cup of tea.
And a,
I got to met,
dude,

1124
01:09:59.381 --> 01:10:03.820
I fucking loved it.
I absolutely loved it.
But like now a week later,
uh,

1125
01:10:03.821 --> 01:10:05.710
physically I'm feeling the fucking PA.

1126
01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:09.880
Every morning I got up and I got that breakfast.
And,
um,

1127
01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:15.880
what else did I do?
I went to a,
I went to,
oh,
the crosswalk there.

1128
01:10:15.881 --> 01:10:19.030
I got the picture of the Abbey road thing.
The picture comes out like shit,

1129
01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.780
because you gotta be standing in the middle of the fucking road.
And,
uh,

1130
01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:26.480
I took a video of it.
You got to see it.
It's one of the greatest,
um,

1131
01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:28.570
tourist.

1132
01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:34.390
I'm not even to do it just to observe it because basically if you're not

1133
01:10:34.391 --> 01:10:38.620
familiar with the Beatles,
uh,
you know,
it's a really a shame.

1134
01:10:38.621 --> 01:10:40.300
You should listen to their music.
Okay.

1135
01:10:40.330 --> 01:10:45.010
That's like the biggest understatement of all fucking time.
But basically,
um,

1136
01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:51.200
you know,
Abbey road is basically the four Beatles walking across a crosswalk.

1137
01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.820
So now everybody,
when they go there,

1138
01:10:52.821 --> 01:10:56.450
it was a Beatles fan that has to have four people and take that fucking picture.

1139
01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:59.960
And the reality is is they've actually moved the cross walk like 20 feet down

1140
01:10:59.961 --> 01:11:04.700
the fucking street scene are walking where they walked.
But anyways,
um,

1141
01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:06.320
<v 0>okay.</v>

1142
01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:10.910
<v 3>The greatest fucking thing is people stop in the fucking crosswalk cause they</v>

1143
01:11:10.911 --> 01:11:12.380
want to get the goddamn picture,

1144
01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:16.020
which I think actually fucks up the picture because I think they took the

1145
01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:18.420
picture where they while walking.
But long story short,
short,

1146
01:11:18.421 --> 01:11:21.150
all the poor bastards who live over there have to,

1147
01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:25.320
who live in that part of town after deal with that every fucking day.

1148
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:29.010
It's the most annoying tours de thing I've ever seen in my fucking life.

1149
01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:32.490
And he got all these people all excited.
Oh my God.
At the Abbey road.
Wait,

1150
01:11:32.491 --> 01:11:34.650
let's get the,
I want to be John Lennon and allow,

1151
01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:36.900
let me be Paul running around in these.

1152
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:39.650
<v 1>And then you just listen to these English people beep in the home.
If,</v>

1153
01:11:39.651 --> 01:11:42.770
for fuck's sakes,
you're fucking cards.
Beep.

1154
01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:46.070
It was awesome.
The whole thing was awesome.

1155
01:11:46.071 --> 01:11:49.970
So we're actually getting this almost like 38 minutes in and I have to fucking

1156
01:11:49.971 --> 01:11:52.880
meet Bobby to go on a hike.
So I gotta wrap this shit up here quickly.

1157
01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:57.790
<v 3>Um,
so anyways,
did all that type of shit.
Saw Big Ben,
went out,</v>

1158
01:11:57.791 --> 01:12:02.620
had some drinks,
had a great fucking time.
And then I did my show and a,

1159
01:12:02.621 --> 01:12:07.000
the show at the just theater when went incredible.
Um,

1160
01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:09.430
I just had an awesome time,
man.

1161
01:12:09.431 --> 01:12:11.290
And I want to thank really from the bottom of my heart.

1162
01:12:11.291 --> 01:12:16.060
Everybody who came out in England and London,
Dublin and,

1163
01:12:16.061 --> 01:12:20.290
uh,
in Glasgow was fucking awesome.
So,
so basically,
yeah,
we did that.

1164
01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.210
And then the next day we,
uh,

1165
01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:26.710
we flew over to Dublin and the Irish people would just fucking hilarious.

1166
01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:28.181
Um,

1167
01:12:28.181 --> 01:12:32.550
my show with the sugar club when an unbelievable and a,

1168
01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.270
afterwards I was hanging out with the crowd.

1169
01:12:34.271 --> 01:12:37.150
I had a couple of drinks with people in this fucking guy's like,

1170
01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:41.150
this Irish guy comes up to me and he goes,
hi,
love Ya.
Hi.

1171
01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.810
Didn't even let me budget.
Let me buy you a drink.
Hot it off.
Yeah.
Right.

1172
01:12:43.811 --> 01:12:47.980
And he fucking buys me a goddamn drink and then he won't fucking leave.

1173
01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:54.070
He says sweaty drunk dude with this.
He looks like he plays in a grunge band.

1174
01:12:54.071 --> 01:12:56.740
You know what the fucking hat on and he just won't fucking leave.

1175
01:12:56.770 --> 01:13:00.640
And he's drunk and he keeps coming up and he keeps trying to touch my fucking

1176
01:13:00.641 --> 01:13:04.450
hair,
which I had moose stop what I have left on top,
right.

1177
01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:08.170
So finally he ends up fucking,

1178
01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:12.760
he comes out of nowhere with his sweaty drunk hand it fucking like pets.

1179
01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:16.840
The top of my head,
another man pet the top of my head.

1180
01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:22.090
It's my girl goes,
do what the fuck are you doing?
And she goes,
he goes,
oh,

1181
01:13:22.091 --> 01:13:23.780
I'm sorry I touched his,
we've,

1182
01:13:28.690 --> 01:13:30.890
<v 1>no,
I'll tell you something.
I am a fucking asshole.</v>

1183
01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.860
But when somebody gets me with the good one,

1184
01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.050
the only reason why I didn't burst out laughing in fucking high 500 foot,

1185
01:13:37.051 --> 01:13:42.051
how fucking funny that was a was because he's one of these psychos that if you

1186
01:13:42.611 --> 01:13:45.400
give him any sort of,
I wasn't even giving them any of it,
any attention,

1187
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:49.330
he wouldn't fucking leave.
So I actually,
if I actually did,
um,

1188
01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:53.170
and then I was laughing later like me and my girl both fucking laugh in that he

1189
01:13:53.171 --> 01:13:56.710
said was a weave and it's like maybe because I shaved my head and uh,

1190
01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:00.280
when I grew it back I had a lot more hair than people thought I did that he

1191
01:14:00.281 --> 01:14:04.240
thought I got hair plugs this or something.
But Oh man,

1192
01:14:04.241 --> 01:14:08.380
it was fucking hilarious.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,

1193
01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.040
that was Dublin that we,
that was only on Dublin like two seconds.

1194
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.280
<v 3>We got this hilarious cab driver and he's driving us to the airport and all,</v>

1195
01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:18.191
and by the way,

1196
01:14:18.191 --> 01:14:21.670
all these Scottish guys were over there cause they had this huge rugby match and

1197
01:14:21.671 --> 01:14:25.330
I totally got into the rugby over there.
They got this league,
the uh,

1198
01:14:25.331 --> 01:14:29.140
the six nations league that I think is Scotland,
Wales,

1199
01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:34.630
England.
How's it three?
Ireland,
France and Italy.
Uh,

1200
01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:38.260
there's only six teams so reminded me of hockey like the fucking original six.

1201
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:42.250
There's not that many players.
He can get to know the teams.
So long story short,

1202
01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:45.040
if Ireland won the game the day we were leaving,

1203
01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.760
if Ireland when the game than they were the champions of the league and if

1204
01:14:48.761 --> 01:14:52.870
Scotland lost,
they would be the worst team in the league.

1205
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:57.010
Thus winning the wooden spoon,
wooden spoon,

1206
01:14:57.011 --> 01:14:59.050
they actually give you a fucking award.
It's like,

1207
01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:04.080
like you don't know that you were the worst just in case you forget in rugby

1208
01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.690
they give you something called the wooden spoon,
you know,

1209
01:15:07.691 --> 01:15:11.860
just so people can fucking rub that.
I think that's brilliant.
Fucking brilliant.

1210
01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:17.100
I think it's hilarious because that's such a great way to give like a team shit.

1211
01:15:17.771 --> 01:15:20.680
Like take the Pittsburgh pirates,
how many fucking wooden spoons,

1212
01:15:20.681 --> 01:15:25.480
what they would be like the New York Yankees of wooden spoons and it's just a

1213
01:15:25.481 --> 01:15:28.570
whole nother level to give somebody shit.

1214
01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.610
So basically when we were over there,

1215
01:15:30.611 --> 01:15:34.630
all these Scott's came over to watch the game and uh,

1216
01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:36.610
all the Irish people were talking shit.
Oh,

1217
01:15:36.611 --> 01:15:41.470
it's just fucking great talking about that there that killed and,
and um,

1218
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:46.450
so I got so amped up by watching these guys give each other shit and I wasn't

1219
01:15:46.451 --> 01:15:50.170
getting any American sports that I had when I landed in Scotland the next day I

1220
01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:54.190
actually watched the game and it was a fucking great game.
And Scotland won.

1221
01:15:55.030 --> 01:16:00.030
They actually won and avoided getting the wooden spoon and Ireland actually lost

1222
01:16:00.491 --> 01:16:04.480
the championship because of that.
And I believe France one with,

1223
01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:09.430
it's just something wrong about French people winning a rugby contest,
you know,

1224
01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:10.511
championship.

1225
01:16:10.511 --> 01:16:14.500
Considering the stereotype of them and considering I'd never been there.

1226
01:16:14.530 --> 01:16:16.810
Wait a minute,
this guy,
it wasn't Andre that giant French.

1227
01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:20.470
The fuck is wrong with me.
I'm such an idiot.
All right,
scratch all that,
whatever.

1228
01:16:20.471 --> 01:16:25.030
So I got into it and um,
then my last night there,
I,
um,

1229
01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:30.640
I went to a,
the Lyons Theatre in Glasgow,

1230
01:16:30.641 --> 01:16:34.600
Scotland and uh,
you know,
I was so tempted to go out there,

1231
01:16:34.601 --> 01:16:37.960
but I didn't want to fuck my show up at by pissing everybody off.

1232
01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:42.310
But I really wanted to go up and open with,
rather than be like,
hey,

1233
01:16:42.311 --> 01:16:43.141
how are you guys doing?

1234
01:16:43.141 --> 01:16:45.850
And I really appreciate you coming out cause you don't know who the hell I am.

1235
01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:49.180
I really felt like coming out there and just going,
how are you doing?

1236
01:16:49.181 --> 01:16:52.970
You're fucking scared.
Wearing could just open it up

1237
01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.520
just to see what they do.

1238
01:16:57.521 --> 01:17:00.640
And I realize halfway through the show that they probably would have laughed,

1239
01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:06.010
but uh,
I got great video of all of them be,
uh,

1240
01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:08.330
the,
I got the whole crowd saying,
you're,

1241
01:17:08.331 --> 01:17:10.350
you're listening to Monday morning podcast.

1242
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:11.240
<v 1>You're fucking cons.</v>

1243
01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:14.370
But she can't understand what they're saying because there's too many of them.

1244
01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:18.990
I had my heart in the right place.
Um,
maybe I'll put it up with some actual,
uh,

1245
01:17:19.770 --> 01:17:22.580
what do they subtitles underneath it.
He'll watch and know that,
yeah,

1246
01:17:22.581 --> 01:17:26.640
you're listening to the Monday morning podcast.
You're fucking coat.

1247
01:17:27.570 --> 01:17:30.330
They really leaned into it too.
I'll put the video,

1248
01:17:30.331 --> 01:17:32.090
it's all gonna be part of the video,
but I,

1249
01:17:32.091 --> 01:17:37.091
I sincerely want to thank everybody who came out to see my shows.

1250
01:17:37.321 --> 01:17:38.140
I was unbelievable.

1251
01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:42.160
<v 3>Really flattered by the,
uh,
the reception I got when I was over there.</v>

1252
01:17:42.161 --> 01:17:43.990
Like people were actually clapping,

1253
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:47.900
like they knew who I was and it was incredible.
And a,

1254
01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.950
that was another thing that I learned when I was over there was the,
uh,

1255
01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:56.080
like the different levels of fame.
Like over here I have,

1256
01:17:56.590 --> 01:18:01.090
like I say,
I have notoriety.
That's where I'm at,
you know,

1257
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:04.460
second degree notoriety.
Like every once in a while someone was like,
Hey,

1258
01:18:04.461 --> 01:18:08.990
you're the comedian guy.
Right?
Eh,
thank you.
Funny.
I say,
yeah,
he used to be on,

1259
01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:14.080
you're on that show,
right?
Once you on that show.
Yeah,
yeah,
it was on the show.

1260
01:18:14.770 --> 01:18:17.890
Um,
but just to go over there and see,

1261
01:18:17.891 --> 01:18:22.891
I started like John Mayer had a sold out show at Wembley Stadium and added a

1262
01:18:23.501 --> 01:18:27.820
second show and I was like,
wow,
that fucking dude,

1263
01:18:27.821 --> 01:18:32.170
his famous.
Okay.
And um,
you know,

1264
01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:37.060
and we get into the entertainment game and as a performer and you start,

1265
01:18:37.061 --> 01:18:39.520
you know,
trying to sell tickets,
you know,

1266
01:18:39.521 --> 01:18:43.030
when the first time you sell out a fucking comedy club,
you can't believe it.

1267
01:18:43.031 --> 01:18:47.260
And just to see someone to be able to move that amount of tickets on the other

1268
01:18:47.261 --> 01:18:50.800
side of the fucking world.
It's unreal.

1269
01:18:51.610 --> 01:18:54.610
<v 1>For those of you unfamiliar with Wembley Stadium,
this is how big it is.</v>

1270
01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.440
Evil Knievel did a stunt there.
He fucking jumped over like,

1271
01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:04.060
like 30 buses,
London double deckers.
Granted,
he didn't fucking make it,

1272
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:08.890
but just picture how fast you'd have to get a motorcycle going today.

1273
01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:13.000
Forget about a motorcycle 40 fucking years ago at 35 years ago.

1274
01:19:13.150 --> 01:19:15.040
That probably weighed two tons.

1275
01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:16.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1276
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:20.610
<v 1>And he bet he cleared the buses.
I think he landed on the last one.
That's a,</v>

1277
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:24.020
that's some footage right there that you might want to check all you x game

1278
01:19:24.021 --> 01:19:28.550
people cause he's the fucking father,
all of that shit.
Um,
so anyways,

1279
01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:32.150
John Mayer sold that fucking place out in these,
these,

1280
01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:34.990
he's got another one coming up,
added a show there.

1281
01:19:34.991 --> 01:19:39.940
So I was really a humbled going over there and um,

1282
01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.860
and I'm looking forward to coming back again going to a concert at Royal Albert

1283
01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:48.110
Hall,
going to a rugby game and either Scotland or uh,

1284
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:53.080
a fucking Ireland and just coming through all those again.

1285
01:19:53.081 --> 01:19:55.510
I definitely want to build up a following over there cause I had a great time

1286
01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:00.390
after actually actually after my,
my Gig in the Lyons theatre,
I went over to um,

1287
01:20:01.450 --> 01:20:05.440
this,
this comedy club and dude,
it was fucking hilarious.
Uh,

1288
01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:10.560
we walked in there and we will to the host of the show and the guy is speaking

1289
01:20:10.981 --> 01:20:15.270
English and we cannot understand 80% of what he's saying.

1290
01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:19.890
So we are laughing along with the crowd,
not at the jokes.

1291
01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:22.940
Just fucking Hydra.
Jane did a fucking hot,

1292
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:27.750
it's like what you guys remember that one when in snatch,

1293
01:20:27.751 --> 01:20:29.520
when Brad Pitt played that Irish character,

1294
01:20:29.521 --> 01:20:32.850
you couldn't understand this was the Scotland,
Scotland version of that.

1295
01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.260
And I met this comedian Kevin Bridges,
who's I guess huge over there.

1296
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:41.520
Not even guess.
He is huge over there afterwards,
we haven't a couple of pints.

1297
01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:48.090
And I started talking about the word cunt and I was too drunk.

1298
01:20:48.091 --> 01:20:53.091
I wish I filmed it listening to these guys talk about the word cunt,

1299
01:20:53.190 --> 01:20:55.170
the way they say it now.

1300
01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:58.140
It would've been so perfect on this podcast at some point.
I have to,

1301
01:20:58.141 --> 01:21:02.340
I have to interview one of those two guys on this podcast.
But,
um,

1302
01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.371
I was sitting there going,
yeah,

1303
01:21:04.371 --> 01:21:07.590
I can't wear like blown away how you guys can just say cunt and it's not

1304
01:21:07.591 --> 01:21:11.300
offensive.
And they're like,
yeah,
I'm thinking like high.

1305
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:13.340
Anybody says that when they come over here,
have a blah,
blah,

1306
01:21:13.341 --> 01:21:16.920
blah and all this shit.
Right.
So I was talking to him,
Mike.
Yeah.

1307
01:21:16.921 --> 01:21:21.510
You actually use it as like,
like a compliment.
You say stuff like,
Oh,
you know,

1308
01:21:21.511 --> 01:21:25.900
he's,
he's a good client and the other guy goes,
he goes,
oh,
he's a good aid,

1309
01:21:25.901 --> 01:21:27.820
current top couldn't,

1310
01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:34.680
so they,
you'd go there,
there's a new expression for you.
He's a top cunt.

1311
01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:37.830
I think that's one of the greatest things I've ever heard.

1312
01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:41.850
So I'm saying that these guys,
um,
ah,

1313
01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:43.780
<v 3>fuck,
why did they film,
you would have loved this shit if you,</v>

1314
01:21:43.781 --> 01:21:47.730
if you're a standup geeky didn't want to you and you just want to see like where

1315
01:21:47.731 --> 01:21:52.180
would trade notes like I was saying,
so I go,
so what is basically the seaward,

1316
01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:56.850
what is the word you can't say over in Scotland?
And he said,

1317
01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:57.773
uh,

1318
01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:03.840
spastic is what he said spastic.
And he tried,
he was explaining it to me,
but,

1319
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:07.860
but granted we were both fucking shit faced and I could barely understand what

1320
01:22:07.861 --> 01:22:10.980
this dude was saying when we were all sober.
Right.
But he was,

1321
01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:16.010
I guess it means I couldn't figure it meant some form of like a retarded slash

1322
01:22:19.561 --> 01:22:24.450
vegetable and like,
I dunno,
like that.
They just don't,
you just,

1323
01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:26.970
you don't talk about that stuff over there.
If you do,

1324
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:31.500
I guess it's literally needle going off the fucking record player.
But,

1325
01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:35.850
um,
so I thought that that was really a,
I thought that that was an interesting,

1326
01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.020
what else?
Oh,

1327
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:41.250
here's something you guys better brace yourselves for as far as pop culture

1328
01:22:41.251 --> 01:22:45.210
thing that I saw over there on their American idol over there.
Um,

1329
01:22:46.410 --> 01:22:47.620
there's a,
there's these,

1330
01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:53.490
these twins and they got these high top fades like that dude from kid and play.

1331
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:57.930
Um,
I think it was play the light skin dude,

1332
01:22:57.931 --> 01:23:01.770
right with the fucking high top for that.
Fucking beyond that.

1333
01:23:01.771 --> 01:23:06.280
The eraser head fade,
right?
Two white kids,
they have that do,

1334
01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:11.640
they're twins named John and Edward and they go by the name Jedward I sweat

1335
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:18.250
and they're really into vanilla ice.
They think vanilla ice is awesome.

1336
01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:20.680
And the reporter was going,
you know,

1337
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:24.280
people kind of ridiculed him and they're like,
oh,
but when he freestyles,

1338
01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:25.150
he's lethal.

1339
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:29.380
So I didn't even have to hear what the fuck they sing.

1340
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:32.920
I just know that some shit is so bad.
It's fucking awesome.

1341
01:23:32.921 --> 01:23:37.921
So I'm just just telling you to get prepared for that because I think that that

1342
01:23:37.991 --> 01:23:42.970
could go global.
That's it's like the perfect storm of fucking awful.

1343
01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:47.080
So do you remember you heard it here first in the states.
Watch out for Jedward.

1344
01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:52.060
Look them up if you have to.
Um,
all right.
What?
50 minutes into this thing.

1345
01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:55.630
I got to fucking rap this fucking thing up.
What did I want to talk about?

1346
01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:00.370
I have any fucking,
any other stories,
whatever.
This is just the English podcast.

1347
01:24:00.371 --> 01:24:03.970
I'll give you one fucking overrated,
underrated thing that's really annoying.

1348
01:24:03.971 --> 01:24:08.620
The shit out of me is this whole thing that when you're going to get a fucking

1349
01:24:08.621 --> 01:24:11.170
Burrito,
all right,

1350
01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:16.570
or a Taco and they ask you what toppings you want and you get whatever toppings

1351
01:24:16.571 --> 01:24:20.500
you want,
then all of a sudden,
if you want to get Guacamole,
this whole bullshit,

1352
01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:25.780
that guacamole's extra.
Oh,
that's 50 cents extra.
That's a dollar extra.

1353
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:30.190
Like avocados are fucking rare,
maybe on the east coast.

1354
01:24:30.191 --> 01:24:33.310
But I gotta admit I got a two friends of mine who own houses out here.

1355
01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:37.330
They got fucking avocado trees in their goddamn yards.

1356
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:41.800
They just,
it's one of those things where just like diamonds,
I always,

1357
01:24:41.801 --> 01:24:44.470
you always hear that rumor that you know,
diamonds aren't really rare.

1358
01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.190
They just say they are and they just control how many go out.

1359
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:52.240
That's what they're trying to do with fucking guacamole.
I put up with it.

1360
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:54.800
It was one kind of fucking food.
I didn't give a shit.

1361
01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:59.230
I paid extra for the Guacamole.
I didn't give a fuck.
And you know what I did?

1362
01:24:59.350 --> 01:25:00.131
I came by,

1363
01:25:00.131 --> 01:25:05.131
became part of the mechanism that created that new corporate fucking current way

1364
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:11.140
of uh,
making extra money.
And I'll tell you why,
because you know what?

1365
01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:16.210
I got a breakfast sandwich she other day and Bacon was extra,
you know,

1366
01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:19.270
like all of a sudden that's as big fucking commodity.

1367
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:23.740
So you can add that to your fucking list of over priced overpriced fucking

1368
01:25:23.741 --> 01:25:28.300
bullshit.
Disposable razors locked up behind the fucking counter,

1369
01:25:28.630 --> 01:25:31.540
like their jewels,
orange juice,

1370
01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.550
guacamole,
and fucking now bacon self.

1371
01:25:36.551 --> 01:25:40.780
This is what we gotta do.
Everybody,
the 14 fucking people,
if they say it's extra,

1372
01:25:40.781 --> 01:25:42.520
be like,
you know what,
that I don't want it.

1373
01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:48.100
Why don't you sit on your fucking bacon?
Let's smell it going bad.
That's it.

1374
01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:49.510
I'm not playing fucking ball.

1375
01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:54.010
Only time I'm fucking getting guacamole's on home and I'll make it myself.

1376
01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:57.040
Or if these fucking cunts don't charge me any extra money,

1377
01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:00.230
but you know what they'll do,
right.
You know what that though to make,
all right.

1378
01:26:00.231 --> 01:26:01.150
It's not extra anymore,

1379
01:26:01.151 --> 01:26:04.080
but the fucking Burrito is 50% more and they'll play on nine

1380
01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.750
<v 1>11 because of nine 11.
They always win.
They always win.</v>

1381
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:10.010
Here's the last thing I want to tell you.

1382
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:11.810
This is the one thing I loved about Scotland.

1383
01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.180
You know they say whores over there.

1384
01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.073
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1385
01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:17.320
<v 1>They say cars.</v>

1386
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.620
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1387
01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:20.840
<v 1>these fucking hours doing drugs.</v>

1388
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:25.490
The floor was the flour.
I'm fucking up the accent.

1389
01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:30.240
All these fucking hires doing drugs.

1390
01:26:30.630 --> 01:26:34.440
Hers Pours Hat Jelly.
They said I fucking loved it.

1391
01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:39.420
I loved every fucking second of it.
Um,
that's it.
That's the end of the podcast.

1392
01:26:39.421 --> 01:26:43.050
I got some shit I got to fucking do.
I apologize that this thing was so late,

1393
01:26:43.051 --> 01:26:46.920
but I'm telling you,
you know good things come to those who fucking wait.

1394
01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:50.160
I think this was a great podcast.
I'm going to pat myself on the back.

1395
01:26:50.161 --> 01:26:52.880
Listen to this.
That was make,

1396
01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:57.720
it's really fucking the back of my neck,
my spine area.
That fucking hurt.

1397
01:26:57.770 --> 01:27:00.660
All right,
you guys have a great week.
God bless and don't worry.

1398
01:27:01.130 --> 01:27:04.110
So a little rough time here.
It's sort of a podcast,
recession.

1399
01:27:04.230 --> 01:27:06.360
We're riding our way through it.
All right.

1400
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:08.450
<v 4>I'll talk to your fucking constantly.</v>
