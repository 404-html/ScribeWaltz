00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.780
Hey,
what's going on is bill barn.
It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.490
October 14th,
2013.
How's it going?
How are you?

3
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.000
Is Everything okay in your neck of the woods?
Um,

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.360
I know what you think of right off the bat.
Jesus belt.

5
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.370
This podcast is even later than it usually is.
Well,
I will,
I would counter.

6
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.480
Okay.
I would counter that verbal assault by saying,

7
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:30.870
well didn't you have the fucking day off today?
We'll dead Ya.

8
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.540
Well great because I did too.
I don't know why.
Oh,

9
00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:39.350
it's Columbus Day,
right?
Columbus Day.

10
00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:42.680
It's Columbus Day.
He came over here,

11
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:46.130
there was already people he cut off the fucking hands cause they couldn't find

12
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:51.131
gold and we celebrate him cause he was kind of white even though I think he was

13
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:55.730
from Spain.
And if he came to Boston and try to get a job,

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.620
he'd be really fucked with most of the people he'd the interview with.
Um,

15
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.480
what's,
um,
so yeah,
today it's Columbus Day.

16
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.490
Christopher Christopher Columbus.
Sorry,
I went to the Brood,

17
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.550
say had a couple of beers,
their rights to deal with me.
Christopher fucking cake.

18
00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:14.240
Chrissy,

19
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.100
get on the fucking ball and do the job we paid you for Christopher Columbus.

20
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.463
Alright.

21
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.720
Discovered America Fall you volume of people who have never picked up a history

22
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:31.490
book.
He sailed in the 1492 he sailed the ocean blue.

23
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.310
He thought he was going to the West indies.

24
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:39.311
This is like there once was a man from Nantucket there once was a man from Spain

25
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.890
who had in his balls a pain.
He couldn't get laid.

26
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.760
He tried every day.
So he said,
fuck it,
I'm going to sail.

27
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:54.560
So I have something to talk about.
I Dunno guys.

28
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:57.180
This is funny to me and I'm buzzing pretty fucking good.

29
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.400
And then I really don't give a shit.
I don't give a shit.
I care.
I care about you.

30
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.220
And how did you enjoy Columbus state?
Or did you do,

31
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.320
did you put on like a fucking George Washington wig and stand on the neck of the

32
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:13.780
tennis person that you know in celebration of all the great things he did?
Um,

33
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.660
I've always had difficulty once I got past a certain age with the fact that that

34
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:21.110
guy,
they said,
he discovered,
he discovered,

35
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.060
he discovered it for Europe.
He didn't discover it.
There was already people here.

36
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.070
You know what I mean?
Just sitting here,
living off the land,
you know,

37
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.300
little mud flap over their junk using up every bit of the animal.

38
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.860
They did nothing wrong.

39
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:40.520
That's the overcorrection of native Americans where they've now become like

40
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:44.180
these godlike people where none of them were bad.
You know,

41
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.950
none of them would have fucked you out of your four zero one k money had they

42
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:53.390
understood what a 401k was and could tie a tie.
You know what I mean?
I mean,

43
00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:57.230
people are people.
Let's,
let's,
let's,
let's get down to brass tacks here.
People.

44
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.000
All right.
Just cause you just sitting there,

45
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.930
floss in with the fucking bison tendon doesn't mean that,
you know,

46
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:09.340
if you had a car,
you wouldn't get a little grabby on the first date.

47
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.900
All right?
Okay.
And if you can't do the math on that,
that I can't help you.

48
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.170
Um,
yeah,
it's Christopher Columbus Day.

49
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.480
Mary go vis speechy remember,
I'll let that fucking awful history stuff.

50
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:26.320
He's sitting there with half a fucking erection looking at some chick next to

51
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:31.321
you and there's some guy in a god damn tweed coat talking about a Vinny del

52
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:36.610
Negro.
What was the other,
what was it?
What was the other guy?

53
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.790
The other world explore.

54
00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:42.220
It was a merry go Vespucci it was Christopher Columbus and then there was a guy

55
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:45.280
who had like a Vinny del Negro name but it wasn't Vinny del Negro.

56
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:47.860
But then that's in my head so I'll never be able to think of what the fuck was

57
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.440
it?
Was it Marcus the Laffeyett?

58
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.280
Was that him?
He wasn't the trader in the revolutionary war.

59
00:03:57.281 --> 00:04:01.540
That was benedict Arnold Barkus the left yet.

60
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.900
Did he start Marquette University?
He did something.

61
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.740
He wasn't with Lewis and Clark.
I don't fucking know.
You know it's funny.

62
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.760
It's just all the shit that was done to create this country and they kind of

63
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:17.650
boil it down to like 14 people.
These guys sailed up a river.
This guy found it.

64
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.850
This guy said,
I can't tell a lie.
And a the other guy said,
hey,

65
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.250
why don't you lay off the black people for a minute?
You know,

66
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:29.251
and that's pretty much the first 200 years of history in this country as far as

67
00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:35.080
I can tell,
you know,
and for all you Europeans listening and all you Australians,

68
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:37.360
that doesn't mean your country's better.
Alright,

69
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.650
so fuck you and your fish and chips and your vegemite sandwiches because nobody

70
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:44.770
gives a shit.
All right.
You just as filthy as we are,

71
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:49.771
which brings me to a wonderful fucking conversation that I had with Paul Versey.

72
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.320
Paul Versey,
right?
So neither one of us has watched baseball in a while.

73
00:04:56.321 --> 00:05:01.321
I stopped in 2010 when a poppy tested for some substance and they never said

74
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.790
what it was.
And at that point,

75
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.700
pretty much everybody from the old four series,

76
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.000
like five guys on both teams had tested positive or whatever.

77
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:13.210
So it was kind of fair.
I guess I wrote it up,
guys beat,
you're write it up guys.

78
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:16.030
But it was just getting annoying.
And I might say poppy was doing any shit,

79
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.740
but that was just one of those things where I was like,
listen,

80
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.180
I've watched enough fucking train wrecks.
I don't want to watch this one either.

81
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:26.440
Get it out of the game or do what you know you've got to do with the long haul,

82
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.650
which is you got to make the shit legal.
All right.

83
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.340
I love how a football player who is running around tackling people at the NFL

84
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:39.970
level,
which is basically like getting into a fucking car accident.

85
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.120
You know,
not a major one,
but a pretty significant one.

86
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.510
You got to exchange insurance cards like every other fucking play.

87
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.880
He can't do roids but a fucking,

88
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.690
some singer can't get onstage Bayer like la about,
I'll do better.

89
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.360
Nobody do you warp wall.
They can't fucking do that.

90
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:03.060
Then it's okay for them to give rides to get some roids right.

91
00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:07.410
And they're all fucking voicebox look up at the ceiling.
They're fucking,
uh,

92
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.380
Vladimir,
whatever the fuck your name is.
Fatty with the beard.

93
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.990
What does that guy's name?
He was the guy who was part of the three tenors.

94
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.590
You know,
they look like Franco Harris.
If he was white,

95
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.960
the fuck is that guy's name.
And he was bald.
Jesus Christ.
It's like the,

96
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.700
anybody knows like y'all,
everybody knows one opera singer and this is the guy,

97
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.190
right?
Whatever that fucking guy,
I don't even know how I got onto that shit.

98
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.120
The fuck was I talking?
I'm talking about virgin.
All right.

99
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.540
So me and [inaudible] have not watched.
Oh,

100
00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:46.320
so much steroids before I was talking about Versie steroids.
Yeah.

101
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.820
They're fucking synergetic shit that you watch late at night where they show

102
00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:54.630
some old guy with his gut hanging out,
right?

103
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.970
He's got a tattoo of Rosie the riveter right above where his fucking spleen used

104
00:06:59.971 --> 00:07:02.670
to be and he's just done.

105
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.280
He's got creases in his torso that it doesn't even make sense.

106
00:07:06.281 --> 00:07:07.770
It's not even like fat creases.

107
00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:12.150
It means like organs have been removed and there's a space there now they can

108
00:07:12.151 --> 00:07:15.000
only be filled up with the flesh on the outside of your torso.

109
00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:18.330
What are those kinds of creases?
Okay.

110
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.070
And then by the end of the commercial,

111
00:07:20.071 --> 00:07:23.130
that guy standing there looking like fucking Gronk Koski

112
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.840
and he's hanging out with some fucking 35 year old chick who wasn't raised
right.

113
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.850
Clearly you're dead.
Took off.

114
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.930
So now she has the big strong father figure that she always wanted.

115
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.030
And I'm sitting there go,
well Jesus Christ,
I thought P90x was impressive.

116
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.570
That was getting people in their twenties,
thirties and forties and shape.

117
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.170
What the fuck is this shit?
And I went up,
I went on the Internet,

118
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.000
the old inner web as they call it on my favorite fucking show on TV,

119
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:57.190
fast and loud.
Uh,
but went on the Inter web and uh,

120
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.140
I looked it up to see what the shit was.
And it's,
uh,
it's,

121
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.710
it's HGH,
that's what they're doing.

122
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.120
And they said they're going like with our system as far as my research goes,

123
00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:13.690
before I get in trouble here,
as far as my research,
according to my research,

124
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.720
which was basically I looked up synergetics scam question mark.

125
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.160
And the first thing came up was what they were given these people,

126
00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:25.240
human growth hormone,
well,
obviously human growth homework.

127
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.730
And then you give him a fucking handful of Viagara.

128
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.460
They go out and they hit the clubs,
right?

129
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.110
Go over to the fucking jukebox.
They put on a little fucking Glenn Miller,

130
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:40.120
Glenn Miller,
little moonlight serenade.
And next thing you know,

131
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:45.121
some fucking broad from this generation with their glow sticks in too many

132
00:08:45.521 --> 00:08:50.110
tattoos in a giant fucking ear lobes that you could stick a pool cue through.

133
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.910
All right?
Next thing you know,

134
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:57.150
she's dropped to her fucking dubstep knees and she's blowing a veteran of the

135
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.950
Korean War.
That's how it goes down,
okay?

136
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:07.110
And that right there people is the upside of steroids.
You know,

137
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:13.260
look at all these fucking ways when you're watching the real housewives,

138
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.300
those aren't real housewives.

139
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.340
Those are a higher breed of housewife,

140
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.540
okay?
I'm just loving all the women right now,
just so high.
Why God?

141
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:28.470
How could you say that?
I'll tell you why.
Because this is the deal.

142
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.350
They still had,
they had children,
and this still,

143
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.830
despite the limits of modern day science,

144
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:39.060
is this still trying to look like a hot piece of ass?
Now?
They're not doing it,

145
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.650
but I'm telling you right now,

146
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:44.430
just like that guy that you love that goes into the quarter,
right?
That guy,

147
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:47.310
that little fucking returned punts,
the fucking wedge breaker.

148
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.720
The guy who's all fucking hard.
That's the female version of the wedge.

149
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:53.040
Baker breaker right there.

150
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.340
It's those thoughts on the fucking real housewives.

151
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.800
Look at fuckable India 50s.
God bless you.
Making people do double takes.

152
00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:08.550
Like is that 20?
Oh wait a minute now.
No,
she's 55 gross.

153
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:13.200
But there is that moment.
You know what I mean?
You got to give it up to them.

154
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.300
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
I'm a couple of log is in.

155
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.470
I went to the Bruins game today.
I had no fucking intentions of going wait,

156
00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:26.700
stay on.
Stay on target.
I'll get to the Bruins game and a fucking second.

157
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.360
Um,
so forsee last night,
you know,
I'm the biggest,

158
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:35.670
you couldn't be more of a band wagon red sox fan this year unless you started

159
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.040
after game three of the Tampa Bay series.
The first two games,

160
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:46.041
red sox games I watched this year was game one and game two of the Tampa Bay,

161
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.950
uh,
playoffs.
And then I missed the rest of the series.
I travel,

162
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.240
you know what I mean?
I am into Lego collectibles.
I have a schedule.

163
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.440
Um,
is there such a thing anyways,

164
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.540
and I've watched the,
uh,
the first two games of this tiger city city,

165
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.430
this tiger series.
And it is an instant fucking classic.

166
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.330
If you guys are like me and you went away from the game for a couple of years,

167
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:17.070
uh,
this is a great one.
Great one to come back to.

168
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:21.480
The first one was an absolute gem one,

169
00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:24.230
nothing game.
It was one of those deals with the Tigers won one.
Nothing.

170
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.130
And I felt like we lost like eight nothing.

171
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.150
I mean they would just fucking Mona's doubt.
All right.

172
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.720
Huge loss.
Huge loss.

173
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:37.110
And now they got the fucking upper here to the city center or the series.

174
00:11:37.111 --> 00:11:39.530
Why don't keep saying city?
I don't know.

175
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.740
Probably cause you were drinking bud hide.
I'm

176
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.790
not like there.
They automatically have the upper hand in the,

177
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:51.330
in the series right now we have to win game two.
Look what the fuck they did.

178
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.800
So then they got this other cycle.

179
00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:57.520
I don't know anybody's names then I got other than Cabrera cause he wanted the

180
00:11:57.521 --> 00:11:59.860
triple crown.
And I got to tell you something to right now,

181
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.400
the athletic gifts that that man was given,

182
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.390
that he could be in the fucking horrific shape that he's in,

183
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:11.350
instill with the triple crown.
He is in Joe Derosa shape.

184
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.230
Okay.
When I look at Joe to Rosa,
when I bite into a York peppermint patty,

185
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.930
when I look at Joe de Rosa,
I look at a man,

186
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:21.780
<v 2>okay,</v>

187
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:26.780
<v 0>who has never done a pushup in his life other than after he's been drunk.</v>

188
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.460
And He fell down and did a face plant.

189
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:34.910
And even then it's a girl push up right with his fucking quarter roid knees in

190
00:12:35.491 --> 00:12:39.570
the grass.
And if he's on a fucking hill that favors him.

191
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.890
If he's facing up the hill,

192
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:45.360
he can actually get his horrific fucking,

193
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:50.240
uh,
uh,
example of a torso up off of that grass.

194
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.660
Why am I trashing Joe?
He's not here to defend himself.
Oh,
Jesus.
Joe,

195
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.200
does somebody fucking send this to you because they're miserable.
Um,

196
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:02.140
<v 2>okay.</v>

197
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.800
<v 0>Yeah.
That Cabrera Guy.
Jesus.
What a fucking awful,</v>

198
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:07.450
horrible.

199
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:13.400
He looks like he should be selling like concessions and he's eaten.
Have to,

200
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.380
he's just got a puffy face.

201
00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:20.150
He's got a flabby neck and it's like he's not fat.

202
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.190
He's not in shape.
He's just sort of fuck it.
Know he runs around.

203
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.750
Well,
what?
He's done easy like a fucking ball at mid chocolate ship.
Gee,

204
00:13:29.751 --> 00:13:30.061
you know what?

205
00:13:30.061 --> 00:13:33.020
It reminds you of like Warren Sapp whenever I used to watch Warren Sapp play,

206
00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:36.260
I've just used to remember like what would happen if this guy actually fucking

207
00:13:36.261 --> 00:13:39.380
worked out?
What have you actually worked out?

208
00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:40.750
<v 2>Okay.</v>

209
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:45.640
<v 0>Warren Sapp was in worse shape than most of the people in the stands that were</v>

210
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:49.840
watching him.
Just,
you know,
to look at them.
I used to always stick ice stuff.

211
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.780
I thought I was like towards the end of his career,
one of these years,

212
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.990
he's going to say fuck it and he's going to come in with a flat stomach and he's

213
00:13:58.331 --> 00:14:02.290
going to reach like Reggie white level defense event.
And he never did.

214
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.450
He never did it.
So anyway,
so [inaudible] I texted him,
I'm in Boston,
right?

215
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:13.620
And I'm watching the fucking red sox game and he puts them on and you have to

216
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:17.320
understand red sox Yankees hatred is,

217
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:20.770
Paul has even watched the game and I don't know a couple of years right this

218
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.840
second.
I don't think he was watching the game for more than three seconds.

219
00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:30.841
And he just starts sending me tweet after fucking tweet about how awful the

220
00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:34.300
fucking red sox beards are.

221
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

222
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.150
<v 0>He just,
he was beside himself.
He thought it was a disgrace to the game.</v>

223
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.820
The reality is,
is he just,
he hates the fucking reds.
I mean,

224
00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:45.850
I don't like their beards either,
but like,
let's see here,

225
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.600
let me read some of this shit.
Uh,

226
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:51.750
<v 2>okay.</v>

227
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.080
<v 0>Where the</v>

228
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.913
<v 2>fuck is it?</v>

229
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.560
<v 0>Ah,
Shit.
Oh,
load earlier messages do.</v>

230
00:14:58.561 --> 00:15:01.560
We were texting so much during the game.
I had to go all the way.

231
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:02.563
<v 2>Okay,</v>

232
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.850
<v 0>you don't have the success to take the slot.
What the fuck is this?</v>

233
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:12.770
Where the hell is it?
Let me get to the top up here.
I'm sorry guys.
I'm the worst.

234
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.420
Oh,
this is me talking about Paul and the mob.

235
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.980
You get whacked for running your mouth with a fucking [inaudible].

236
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.130
Is it even going to be worth it at this point?
Jesus Christ.

237
00:15:25.131 --> 00:15:28.510
Bill load earlier messages.
Here we go.

238
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.900
All right.
Where the fuck am I?
Okay,
this is what verse he writes.

239
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.920
He says,
I just turned it on because I said,
Papi,
Grand Slam tie game.

240
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.830
Oh by the way,
I'll like not a bunch of tiger fans but about a half dozen of,

241
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.980
we're just trashing me.

242
00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.920
I'm just saying the series over better,
better luck next year.

243
00:15:50.921 --> 00:15:54.820
Red Sox when they were up five,
nothing in game too about you know,

244
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.850
seven innings in and all I just kept thinking in my head is like,
dude,

245
00:15:57.851 --> 00:15:59.620
have you ever watched a baseball game before?

246
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.080
It's like they were running out of time.
As long as there's no outs,
it's,

247
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:09.160
it goes on forever.
It's like that George Carlin bit this plenty of fucking time.

248
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.290
So anyways,
long story short,

249
00:16:11.291 --> 00:16:15.490
they fucking load them up and poppy hits a Grand Slam to tie the game.

250
00:16:15.491 --> 00:16:18.970
So I write poppy Grand Slam Tie game for as he writes.

251
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.840
I just turned it on exclamation point and I was thinking like,
wow,

252
00:16:22.841 --> 00:16:26.140
he's going to be like,
all right,
awesome game immediately.
His first sentence,

253
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.420
do the socks.
Beards are so fucking stupid.
They,

254
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.860
the whole anti Yankee facial hair is so douchey.

255
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.090
They look ridiculous.
Grow up babies,
lol.

256
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.340
Um,
and then we just start going back and forth.
He said,

257
00:16:45.341 --> 00:16:48.910
you guys look like Lumber Jack Morons,
your baseball players,

258
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.930
the worst and a,
I just keep going like,
oh,
you know,

259
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.430
where did Derek Jeter watch the game tonight?
It of course he's like,
uh,

260
00:16:57.431 --> 00:17:00.850
on fucking Miss Universe is pussy.
I'm like,

261
00:17:00.851 --> 00:17:04.060
isn't he like 38 at this point?
It's starting to get creepy,
isn't it?

262
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.050
He really is like some zillionaire guys still going to fucking Hooters.

263
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.520
That's just jealousy on my part anyway,

264
00:17:09.521 --> 00:17:12.550
so we just start fucking giving each other shit.

265
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.370
The fuck was my point to this dude.

266
00:17:15.371 --> 00:17:19.480
Half your team looks like they're in a fucking Halloween Halloween costume.

267
00:17:19.481 --> 00:17:22.240
It's embarrassing.
And then I wrote back,

268
00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:26.140
not as embarrassing is missing the playoffs.
Uh,

269
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.400
what would you do if a comedy club had a no facial hair policy?

270
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.120
He writes back to shave,
but we don't look like assholes.

271
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.050
I'd be working still working.
Stand up.
I don't know what the fuck this,

272
00:17:38.051 --> 00:17:41.260
I can't get it to this cause I started saying what comedians would actually be,

273
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.160
would play for the Yankees versus the one for the red sox.

274
00:17:45.161 --> 00:17:48.370
Just to give you a hint,
the red sox had Sam Kinison and all the bad ass ones.

275
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:53.820
And uh,
the Achy said all the fucking clean cut.
I Dunno.
You know the deal.

276
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.210
I don't know.
I know the podcasts just went off the fucking risk.
Give me a break.

277
00:17:57.211 --> 00:18:00.620
Okay.
I've worked with a head of steam.
Okay,
what are you gonna do it?

278
00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:01.291
But I gotta tell you something.

279
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:03.810
That whole Yankee fucking thing about no facial hair.

280
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.910
I'm old enough to remember in the 70s when they all looked like they were going

281
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:11.100
to go shoot a fucking porno and then out of nowhere they started taking on this

282
00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:16.410
can holier than thou like Notre Dame Horse Shit ghetto.

283
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.290
We weren't clean shaven.
Where are we first?
He's going.
Yeah,

284
00:18:20.291 --> 00:18:22.780
they look like gentlemen.
It's like Paul.

285
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.130
There were a bunch of roid up cuts just like everybody else just because they

286
00:18:27.131 --> 00:18:30.130
look like they're going to deliver a fucking newspaper to you.
All of a sudden.

287
00:18:30.131 --> 00:18:33.130
That makes a better give me a fucking break.
I liked it.

288
00:18:33.131 --> 00:18:35.770
The red sox looked like the mood dogs,
you know,

289
00:18:35.771 --> 00:18:40.420
for you old fucking wrestling fans.
I don't give a shit just as long as,

290
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.370
as long as they would.
It's got to be a great series.

291
00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:46.090
I think it's called seven and I'm actually a big fan of a,

292
00:18:46.091 --> 00:18:49.330
the tigers and that type of stuff.
I had family that grew up in Michigan,
so,
uh,

293
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.180
I like the Tacos.
I got no,
I got no beef with those guys.

294
00:18:52.181 --> 00:18:54.610
But what the fuck was I going to bring up here?
Um,

295
00:18:55.490 --> 00:19:00.160
is it time to read a fucking yeah,
it is.
Certainly do a little,
uh,
yeah.

296
00:19:00.161 --> 00:19:03.250
Jesus.
Yeah.
Where the fuck is it?
Okay,
here we go.
Here we go.

297
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.670
A dollar shave club.
Everybody,
you know,

298
00:19:06.671 --> 00:19:10.150
there's so many things in this world that irritate me.
Uh,

299
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.100
Paul versus a misguided anger about the red sox beards when he should just

300
00:19:15.101 --> 00:19:15.581
really say,

301
00:19:15.581 --> 00:19:19.150
I'm really sad that my team isn't in the playoffs and you guys have a really

302
00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:20.710
good shot at winning the world series.

303
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:24.490
But instead he turns into like Joan Rivers,

304
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.780
like he's on the red carpet,
you know,
Dustin Pedroia,

305
00:19:28.781 --> 00:19:31.500
what are you wearing?
Um,

306

what Shelby thinks can irritate you wide at why ed razors to the list.

You pay outrageous prices.

310
00:19:45.071 --> 00:19:49.060

311
00:19:49.061 --> 00:19:53.710
start feeling like a rusty soda can drag it across your face.

351
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.710
back to the podcast here.
Oh,
you know what's fucking hilarious to me?

352
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:31.120
I got to do a Paul Versey here and say,
dude,
I called it because I did call it.

353
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.370
All right.
Where the hell's my fucking God damn

354
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.750
well I'm the worst.
I am the absolute worst there it is.

355
00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.010
Weeks ago when I first started making fun of Seattle,

356
00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.790
the Seattle Seahawks going for the loudest record.
Just to give you a recap,

357
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.880
I basically said,
well,
hey,
when you haven't won a championship,

358
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.690
you have to hang your hat on something and if you get this record,

359
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.590
are you going to start singing?
We A,

360
00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.360
they're loud is my friends and we'll keep on loses screaming until we lose that

361
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.690
bullshit.
And I said,
you can go back.

362
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:09.490
It's documented on my podcast.
I said that Seattle Seahawks fans,

363
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.040
we're not that loud that it was the building.

364
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.660
I'm not saying that they're not good fence,

365
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:17.200
but then not as fucking loud as everyone's making them out to be.

366
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.750
You go to the game and it's so fucking loud.

367
00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:23.930
You look around and you're looking at people while they're chairing and you're

368
00:23:23.931 --> 00:23:24.161
like,

369
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:29.161
that face does not add up to this loud or they piping noise in and it turns out

370
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:29.441
there,

371
00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:34.441
I'll know had built a stadium specifically designed to contain the noise.

372
00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:39.900
So it's like a crowd on fucking HGH there,
a bunch of cheap,

373
00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.000
they're the Jason Gmbs of crowds.

374
00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:47.600
And from day fucking one when broke their balls about it.
I said,

375
00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:52.601
I went to a Kansas City chiefs game and those fuckers were louder than the ones

376
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:57.230
in Seattle.
And they,
this weekend broke the record for the loudest crowd,

377
00:23:57.231 --> 00:24:00.650
which is the dumbest fucking record ever.
Um,

378
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.140
the loudest crowd.

379
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:07.250
And they did it in a stadium that was built when we still thought the Vietnam

380
00:24:07.251 --> 00:24:09.230
War was winnable.
All right?

381
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.880
So it's not even like they just beat Seattle.
They destroyed them.

382
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:15.740
Okay.

383
00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:20.740
So now I have a new song for the Seattle Seahawks fans out of respect for them

384
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.030
and their one week of holding the title,
they held the title for one week.

385
00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:30.560
Kind of like when the heavyweight champion gets arrested or refuses to go to war

386
00:24:30.561 --> 00:24:33.410
and they just strip him of his title and they give it to some fucking

387
00:24:33.411 --> 00:24:37.100
[inaudible] and he has it for one week until he gets knocked out.

388
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:40.460
That's what happened to them.
So here's the new song.
All right?

389
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:45.940
We were not allowed is for one we do

390
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.500
<v 3>do.
And then a bunch of</v>

391
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.320
Kansas City booboo,
booboo screen.

392
00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.100
<v 0>Oh,
louder.
And you know,
it's funny,
I don't have a fucking salt for it.</v>

393
00:25:00.101 --> 00:25:03.100
You know it's fucking hilarious.
Is Kansas City at least it's won a super bowl.

394
00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:07.690
Everybody,
when did they do it?
Come on.
They were still in the AFL,

395
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.560
<v 3>booboo,
booboo,
booboo pool,</v>

396
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.160
<v 0>super bowl for Leonie Dawson.
63 talks,
power trap,</v>

397
00:25:15.161 --> 00:25:17.810
whatever the fuck it was extra.

398
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.680
But that rolled up thing and the fucking hairpiece walking up and down chewing

399
00:25:20.681 --> 00:25:23.140
his gum.
That was where the Vikings,

400
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:27.720
the original buffalo bills lost their first of soon to be four Superbowls.

401
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:33.100
Uh,
inexplicably.
They had Fran Tarkenton,
they had the purple people eaters.

402
00:25:33.101 --> 00:25:35.860
They had Paul Krauss,
they had fucking chuck foreman.

403
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:41.290
They had Freddy Cox kicking the God Damn Ball and nothing happened.
Uh,

404
00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.670
uh,
you know,
I mentioned earlier that,
um,

405
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:47.320
so Seattle just breaking your fucking balls.
All right?
So,
you know,

406
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:52.030
don't cry in the rain in blow your fucking brains out like that guy did.

407
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:53.583
Okay.

408
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.760
And then is stripper wife read his fucking suicide note to every anyone who

409
00:25:57.761 --> 00:25:59.890
would want to listen,
which was arguably

410
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.520
the greatest example of stealing someone else's thunder I've ever seen.
You know,

411
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.150
how do you blow your own head off and not get top billing?

412
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.500
It's just fucking insane.

413
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.360
I'll tell you how somebody comes in and read a suicide note and is emoting about

414
00:26:16.361 --> 00:26:21.250
how devastated they are.
You know,
it's like,
it wasn't your day lady.

415
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.300
All right.
It was what's left of that guy up there in the fucking attic.

416
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.900
Uh,
all right.
That seemed really insensitive,

417
00:26:28.901 --> 00:26:33.040
but I am a fan of all of the people mentioned,
listen,

418
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.850
sometimes I hurt feelings on this podcast,

419
00:26:36.851 --> 00:26:41.851
but what I'm going for is I'm trying to streamline what it is that I say.

420
00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.340
And sometimes I don't have time for names.

421
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.490
It's sometimes I don't have time for feelings.
Okay?

422
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.900
But that doesn't mean that I'm not,

423
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:55.740
I'm not a fan of where wherever it is you do.
Okay.

424
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.700
And if you can't do the math on that,
then I really can't help you.

425
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:05.400
I mentioned earlier that I am a big fan of a fast and loud.

426
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.150
That's like my favorite fucking TV show.
Now that breaking bad is over.

427
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.060
I absolutely fucking love that show.
I love cars.

428
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.460
I love watching people that know how to fix him up.

429
00:27:14.461 --> 00:27:18.000
But the funniest fucking thing ever is watching the dude,
Richard,

430
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:18.900
Richard Rawlings,

431
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.420
watching him bust these people down on cars is the funniest fucking shit.

432
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.490
I mean,
dude,
he beats the shit out of them.

433
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.290
I don't think I,

434
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.270
I don't remember laughing as much as I laugh when I watched that show.

435
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.050
He fucking destroys him.
He'll go out there,
right.

436
00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:45.150
It's always the same shit.
Somebody got a thunder bird,
they got a corvette,

437
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.110
they got some mopar thing or whatever,
and he comes walking out.

438
00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.620
He's always complimentary of the car when he wants it.

439
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.510
So he gets people excited,
like they got to make a sale.

440
00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:01.020
They just don't realize how low much lower it's going to be.

441
00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:05.850
So he always comes in and he goes,
wow,
man,
look at this high.
It's at 60,

442
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:10.720
68.
Yeah.
Wow.
Boths sits right body straight,
everything's cool,
but blah,

443
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:14.880
blah,
blah,
blah.
And that he always looks at him.
He just goes,
uh,
so,

444
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.670
uh,
what were you thinking?
And then the oldest is always like,

445
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:22.560
I mean,
I don't know.
I was thinking,

446
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.410
I was thinking like 30 and then Richard,
I don't give a fuck what they say.

447
00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:33.090
He always just goes like,
ah,
man,
I can't do 30.
I can't,

448
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.270
I can't.
I come on,
I drove all the way out here.
I got to,
I got to tow it back.
I,

449
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.990
I can't,
I can't do 30 right.
So then the person who owns the car,
oh,

450
00:28:39.991 --> 00:28:42.810
he says the same shit.
Well,
well what,
what uh,
you know,

451
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.800
come my way a little bit where,
what were you thinking?
And he's,

452
00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:51.630
he always t his hands in his pocket and he acts like he's thinking about it,

453
00:28:51.631 --> 00:28:53.820
which,
you know,
he is it.
He knew what the fuck he was offered.

454
00:28:53.821 --> 00:28:57.840
The second he walked into the barn and he'll say like,
I was thinking like,

455
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:03.960
like 12
dude,

456
00:29:03.961 --> 00:29:08.820
they go from 30 he takes him down to 12 so these guys like,
ah,
man,

457
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.960
I can't do 12 come on man,
I can't do that.
I can't do that.

458
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.950
And then they,
they always come down quick and they go,

459
00:29:16.951 --> 00:29:21.951
how about like 24 can you do 24 and then he comes back like,

460
00:29:22.141 --> 00:29:27.060
man,
I could do like 13 and he's just inching up and that drop in like a fucking

461
00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:28.710
elevator.
The Gut,
it's cables cut.

462
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:34.190
My favorite one I ever saw was he went in and potluck this 62 corvette off these

463
00:29:34.921 --> 00:29:39.690
these people,
right?
And it was sitting in this fucking damp warehouse,

464
00:29:39.691 --> 00:29:43.450
spooky looking,
fucking saw,
cutting of place.

465
00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:47.090
And they buy the fucking thing.
The guy one of 30 grand for it,

466
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:51.880
any busted of down to 18 five so he brings the fucker,
think back,

467
00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:55.030
I mean it's a corvette so he can't see any Russ cause it's a fiberglass body.

468
00:29:55.031 --> 00:30:00.010
But when they look underneath it,
it's just rusted out to the point of like,
dude,

469
00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:04.570
what?
Oh I don't,
why did we pick this car up?
But as luck would have it,

470
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.110
the guy who sold him the car there was,

471
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:11.710
it was actually his grandfather's car and there was people part of his family

472
00:30:11.711 --> 00:30:13.510
tree that were like,
you shouldn't have sold that car.

473
00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:14.920
That car was supposed to be for us.

474
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:19.570
So they go down to the gas monkey garage to buy this fucking car back.

475
00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.580
All right,
so Richard site,
he hasn't to do it.
Hadn't had to do anything for it,

476
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:28.000
right.
He paid 18 five for it,
you know,

477
00:30:28.001 --> 00:30:31.270
busted the guy down from 30 so the guy's own family members,

478
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.710
his nephew and his brother come in to buy the car back.

479
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.130
They tell him the whole fucking story.
And then Richard's like,
yeah,
cool man.

480
00:30:39.131 --> 00:30:43.210
You can buy it back.
And they will like,
so what were you thinking?
And he goes,

481
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:45.430
you know,
I was thinking like 30

482
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.810
after bus and the guy from 30 down to 18 five he goes right back to that guy's

483
00:30:54.811 --> 00:30:59.730
price.
So the cousin and the fucking uncle,
they're like,
hey,
stupid,

484
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.570
you bought the car from my brother.
We know what you've paid for it.

485
00:31:03.571 --> 00:31:06.000
And the only time I've ever seen him get embarrassed,
he was like,
Oh,

486
00:31:06.001 --> 00:31:09.690
I'm sorry man.
That's just what we do here.
He's like,
how about 22?

487
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.190
And he ended up selling it for fucking,
you know,
20 grand.
I don't know.

488
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:19.220
I probably just butchered all that.
But fast and loud,
you gotta check it out.
Uh,

489
00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.940
I like it because they build cars that I feel like I could afford.

490
00:31:23.941 --> 00:31:27.960
They don't have like that Meekum shit where everything's six figures.

491
00:31:27.961 --> 00:31:28.490
I mean they,

492
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:33.490
they build like a bad ass car for like 25 30 grand after they paid like,

493
00:31:33.571 --> 00:31:36.990
you know,
10 grand for it and redid everything.
I really liked that show.

494
00:31:36.991 --> 00:31:41.460
So a shout out to anybody who lists who's on that show that listens to this

495
00:31:41.461 --> 00:31:44.970
podcast.
I fucking love it.
Anyways,
what are we up to here?

496
00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.050
What am I talking about?

497
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.270
What am I looking at here I am 31 minutes in.

498
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.620
Was there anything else I wanted to talk about?
How about the Patriots?

499
00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:59.520
I watched that game on the flight that was unbelievable.

500
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:04.530
The last two touchdowns in that game where you couldn't find a better example of

501
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:11.460
a worst defense I've ever seen in my fucking life.

502
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:16.410
The Patriots had double coverage,
got to safety coming over the top,

503
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:21.450
our quarterbacks in position to swat down the ball and he swings at it like a

504
00:32:21.451 --> 00:32:25.200
fucking change up and it goes right by him and the guy scores for fucking

505
00:32:25.201 --> 00:32:29.390
touchdown.
Brutal.
And then what?

506
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.820
Brady threw an interception that we went down the field and the fucking saints

507
00:32:32.821 --> 00:32:35.300
turn around and do the exact same thing in single coverage.

508
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.320
It was like neither team wanted to win the game,

509
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:42.620
but I want to chastise all those fucking patriots fans that left that fucking

510
00:32:44.301 --> 00:32:46.220
left.
Like half the stadium looked like it left.

511
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.810
And I know a lot of people like girl boss,
Patriots fans sock.
It's like fuck you,

512
00:32:50.811 --> 00:32:53.600
you'll fan suck to half of your fans suck.

513
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.410
That's what you have to understand about any,
any arena you go to.

514
00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.850
The only reason why it is this,
it is the size that it is,

515
00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:05.240
is it's because someday you're going to make a run at the title and they're

516
00:33:05.241 --> 00:33:07.970
going to need all those extra seats.
All right?

517
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:12.260
But the reality is is when the team start shitting the bed,

518
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.340
half the people leave.

519
00:33:13.341 --> 00:33:16.850
So those stadiums only need like patriots state and really only needs to hold

520
00:33:16.851 --> 00:33:19.190
30,000 people.
You know,

521
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:22.580
if you had decided to agreement that I don't give a fuck if they're 14 and two

522
00:33:22.581 --> 00:33:27.020
or two and 14 I'm coming to the Games.
You know,
I think it needs to be 30,000.
So,

523
00:33:27.021 --> 00:33:27.854
uh,

524
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.490
I love that all those fuckers left and they have to go to work tomorrow and lie

525
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.610
and say that they were there.
Uh,
the red sox were great.

526
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:39.500
Most of the people stayed,
a couple,
two or three people I saw leave,

527
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.520
saw a couple of empty seats,
but everybody stayed.

528
00:33:41.521 --> 00:33:42.740
It was just a great fucking weekend.

529
00:33:42.741 --> 00:33:45.590
And I went to the Bruins game today I was actually walking over to the,

530
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:51.670
to the garden and I was just going to buy a hat and a all of a sudden hear guys

531
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:56.150
who needs tickets,
who these tickets.
And I knew they were playing the redwoods,

532
00:33:56.151 --> 00:34:00.350
but I thought it was in Detroit.
And I said,
fuck it.
I'll go to the Goddamn game.

533
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.260
So I go into the game and like not going to drink,
drink a little water,

534
00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.240
come back through the fucking podcast.

535
00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:09.320
That what happens in between the fucking first and second period or second and

536
00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:13.130
third period,
I run into an old drinking buddy of mine for back in the day,

537
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:17.990
the high school days pick up right where we left off.
Al Have One,

538
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.750
you know,
fucking three beers later.
Here we are.

539
00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:25.330
So my apologies for being late and congratulations to the Redwings.
Uh,

540
00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:29.450
it wasn't the greatest fucking games.
Matinee games usually suck.

541
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:31.850
You know,

542
00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:36.850
there's usually an extra sorta like a mascot presence cause there's so many kids

543
00:34:37.491 --> 00:34:41.570
there,
they usually don't fight,
you know,
which makes sense.
Right.

544
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.011
I want to ask you guys,

545
00:34:43.011 --> 00:34:45.740
what was the last time he got into a fistfight at like two o'clock in the

546
00:34:45.741 --> 00:34:49.070
afternoon?
It doesn't happen.
Fist fights happen at night.

547
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:54.530
I don't know why they just do it.
Feels right.
Um,
all right.

548
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:58.250
Is that it?
Is that all I have to talk about before I get into the letters?

549
00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.680
Uh,
chief Seattle fast and loud.
Red Socks,

550
00:35:03.681 --> 00:35:06.590
patriots Bruins.
Oh,
the half marathon,

551
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.470
which just make little notes here of Shit to talk about.

552
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:11.170
I was fucking walking through,
uh,

553
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:15.710
the Boston Commons walking through the pack and they were having this half

554
00:35:15.711 --> 00:35:19.170
marathon and all it was was fucking ladies

555
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:24.770
and a fucking web look phenomenal.
They were crushing it,
right?

556
00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:28.610
Run it down the street,
zero fucking body fat,
but still had booties on him.

557
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:30.620
I was loving every fucking second of it,
right?

558
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.390
Objectifying them as they tried to have a nice day of exercise.

559
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:37.950
So as I get closer to the finish line,

560
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.750
there's some woman on the mic and it's,
I dunno,

561
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:46.080
like she was just being so overly positive.
It was annoying the shit out of me.

562
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.430
She was announcing every woman that crossed the finish line.

563
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.860
I get announcing like the fucking top 10,
15,
20,

564
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.941
but the,

565
00:35:56.941 --> 00:36:00.840
it took me like 20 minutes to walk through the park for one side to the other

566
00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:04.400
side up by the State House and all I hear the whole time.
And uh,
you know,

567
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:10.030
Bertha Clifford from Attleboro,

568
00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.390
he's just yelling everybody's Day.

569
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:17.300
Abigail twizzle Nixle from Marblehead.

570
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:21.780
Today is your day.
That's what she said about one of them.
Today is your day,

571
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:26.430
and I want to be like,
she fucking came in like 70th.
It's not her day.

572
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.620
It's not nearly a day.
She's fucking go home and look at some game film.

573
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.770
It's not her fucking day.
It's not a day by a long shot.
She's a coach.

574
00:36:35.771 --> 00:36:39.960
She's fired the first third of that race,
bringing in an interim runner.

575
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.790
Today's your fucking day.
It's I,
it's just fucking ridiculous.
You know,
I get it.

576
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:48.070
Guys were in the world.
We're a bunch of dicks.
We don't give you a,

577
00:36:48.071 --> 00:36:50.700
you're fucking dude.
So,
but I got to tell you,

578
00:36:50.701 --> 00:36:54.030
there is a way of overcorrecting to the point where all you're doing is making

579
00:36:54.031 --> 00:36:57.960
everybody this soft.
But I got to tell you,
those women weren't little races.

580
00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:00.330
I'll tell you,
they probably didn't like that either.

581
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.880
They probably didn't like it either.
You know what I mean?

582
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:08.630
They're all fucking athletes.
Are you an athlete?
If you're a runner book,

583
00:37:08.631 --> 00:37:09.900
he just put up with a lot of shit.

584
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:18.070
I'll tell you what I like about my girl,
man.
She's gotten dirt.

585
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.510
I came all been pitched about my job for four hours last night.
She never plate.

586
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.210
Uh Oh.

587
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:27.370
That was just one of those moments where I was just sitting there listening to

588
00:37:27.371 --> 00:37:31.110
this fucking woman screaming out all these women's names.
Yeah.

589
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:35.840
You know Betty fucking,
whoever could gradual Laisha

590
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.090
I don't understand it.

591
00:37:39.091 --> 00:37:42.290
You would think that all of them would sub regional fucking running thing and

592
00:37:42.291 --> 00:37:43.950
now they were showing up hyping the race.

593
00:37:43.951 --> 00:37:48.951
They would got to run rather than that person she just mentioned Cayman 47th oh

594
00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:50.950
bill.
You know what?
The holidays are coming up.

595
00:37:50.951 --> 00:37:54.220
Why don't you put a fucking red nose on and fucking take the cut down a little

596
00:37:54.221 --> 00:37:59.020
bit.
All right.
You might be right.
Okay.
So anyways,

597
00:37:59.021 --> 00:38:02.590
Kansas City is officially the loudest crowd

598
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:05.920
and at the end of the day,
nobody,

599
00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:10.870
I think it's funny because I was trashing Seattle,
but nobody gives a fuck.
Okay.

600
00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:15.400
Kansas City wants what Seattle wants,
wants what?
The patriots once,

601
00:38:15.401 --> 00:38:19.600
once what everybody fucking,
once you are at the super bowl title,

602
00:38:19.601 --> 00:38:21.340
that's what you will,
you'll be the loudest.

603
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.040
That's stupid.
The Seattle feds,
the fucking worst.

604
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:31.570
The way you guys so quickly came back to that older that fucked you over so bad.

605
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.990
Or the tall boy beers that were just as big as the small ones.

606
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.240
What is shape and he buys you back cause he fucking calls you 12th man waves of

607
00:38:40.241 --> 00:38:43.480
fucking flag.
You know something Seattle.
I thought you were better than that.

608
00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:44.830
<v 2>Okay.</v>

609
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.220
<v 0>Did it hurts me to say that?
I guess I was wrong.</v>

610
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.840
A lot of people that are actually gonna take that seriously.

611
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:59.420
Okay.
Followup to bully.
All right.
I guess this is one I,

612
00:38:59.421 --> 00:39:01.650
if you can tell,
I've come,
I've been going down,

613
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.090
coming down with a little bit of a cold here.

614
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:06.150
That's what happens when you drink like 12 nights in a row,
you know,

615
00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.380
it's not really the alcohol,

616
00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:10.170
it's the out till four in the morning without a hat on.

617
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:14.700
A follow up to bully a day.
Billy red face.

618
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:18.450
This is a follow up to the email I sent about getting picked on all this was the

619
00:39:18.451 --> 00:39:21.300
big dude,
right?
The big dude at school who could do something.

620
00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.210
He's at the Dojo and all that type of shit.

621
00:39:24.211 --> 00:39:27.690
But didn't want to do something cause he didn't want to disappoint his sensei.

622
00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:31.980
If I'm using the right karate lingo and if I'm not,
I mean I,
I,

623
00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.970
my apologies anyways,
he said it went a lot better than I expected.

624
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.280
Oh,
to give you a recap,

625
00:39:38.281 --> 00:39:42.150
this guy was like a big guy and there was some fucking short fat kid that was

626
00:39:42.151 --> 00:39:46.910
always coming up slapping him in the head at school or this guy seems like he's

627
00:39:46.911 --> 00:39:50.730
studying at least two if not three different martial arts disciplines.

628
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:55.230
And if he wanted to,
okay.
Could,
you know,

629
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.120
do you know that shit that they do?
I don't even know what they do next.

630
00:39:58.121 --> 00:40:02.500
So you know there that you feel the heat of their foot next year ear.
Yeah.

631
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.730
That you,
you know,
you wake up,
they were computer watching the youtube video,

632
00:40:05.731 --> 00:40:08.160
whatever the fuck just happened to you.
He could basically do that.

633
00:40:08.161 --> 00:40:11.730
But he didn't because he didn't want to discipline.
Disappoint his martial arts.

634
00:40:11.731 --> 00:40:14.940
Teach teachers.
All right,
chase is bill.
All right.
Here we go.

635
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:17.100
He said it went a lot better than I expected.

636
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:21.930
I told one of my martial arts teachers any basically gave me a green light to

637
00:40:21.931 --> 00:40:24.660
what?
This kid,
but not too bad.

638
00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:29.220
No broken bones except maybe the nose.
Oh,
I love this guy.

639
00:40:29.221 --> 00:40:30.630
This guy's old school.

640
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:32.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

641
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:37.460
<v 0>He said,
I walked into the locker robe 80 greeted me with,
hey faggot.</v>

642
00:40:37.461 --> 00:40:41.690
Fuck.
Uh,
I replied with,

643
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:45.110
I hear your birthday's coming up.
What's Your Cup size?

644
00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:50.120
He got pretty mad and said,
what'd you fucking say?
I said,

645
00:40:50.121 --> 00:40:53.300
your cup size.
You Fat.
Fuck.
What is it?
I love it.

646
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.360
Did you see the fucking bitch?
And I'm coming out.

647
00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:01.700
He said he walked at me and swung a haymaker.
I took it on the chin.

648
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:02.960
Jesus Christ,
you didn't slip.

649
00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.650
He said I'd beat the shit out of this kid all let's go.

650
00:41:06.651 --> 00:41:11.030
Cause he took a swing first.
Very nice.
Those,
I need them in the belly twice.

651
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:14.150
Once to the head.
I kicked him in the thigh.
Oh,

652
00:41:14.151 --> 00:41:17.330
that's the one he's going to feel tomorrow.
Oh,
that one's good.

653
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.420
That one's going to Bruce and he goes,
any went down?

654
00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.270
I finished with a few punches to the head.

655
00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:27.260
I got suspended for two days after they heard he was picking on me.

656
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.510
I think it's safe to say you won't be picking on anyone else anymore.

657
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:34.850
Have a great day and please say a fuck Kyle.

658
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:38.450
That's an inside joke with one of my friends are I do good for you,

659
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.250
good for you.
And you know something good for your teacher.
You know what I mean?

660
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.050
Can't always be holding people up at third base.

661
00:41:45.051 --> 00:41:48.030
Every once in a while you got to wave of morale.
It comes,

662
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:52.820
that's route with the plank.
Right?
Good for you.
I was going to say,

663
00:41:52.821 --> 00:41:55.760
I wish I could watch the video of it,
but you'd get in trouble for it.
So

664
00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.380
by the way of drinking water that are doing sound is ice water and it's still

665
00:42:00.381 --> 00:42:03.990
drinking on this thing.
All right,
here's a new topic that is,

666
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.690
is it hasn't come up,
which I wish you would come up more often.
A lesbian love.

667
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.890
Dear doctor Burr,
I have a bit of a girl dilemma here.

668
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:18.080
I'm a 26 year old dude living in Connecticut.
Uh,

669
00:42:18.081 --> 00:42:22.580
Fuck Hartford.
Okay,
so you're living anywhere but Hartford or you're in Hartford.

670
00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:27.260
You hate it.
He said,
I met a girl.
Oh,
wait a minute.
If this is coming from a guy,

671
00:42:27.261 --> 00:42:29.870
all I see is threesome on the horizon.

672
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:35.780
All right,
please let this go the way I want it to go.
He said,

673
00:42:35.781 --> 00:42:39.380
I met a girl through a friend of a friend and we became great friends.

674
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.850
She lives out of state,

675
00:42:40.851 --> 00:42:44.140
but we still keep in touch and communicate with each other whenever we can.

676
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.610
All right.
You paint with a broad brush here.

677
00:42:46.611 --> 00:42:50.000
That can be you text every once in a while or you're having,

678
00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:53.120
fuck you're sexting or fucking,
you know,

679
00:42:53.121 --> 00:42:55.850
pressing your Dick up against your computer while skyping.
I mean,

680
00:42:55.851 --> 00:42:57.170
there's a lot of,
there's a,
you know,

681
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:01.100
there's a lot of room for interpretation there,
sir.
But I'll continue.

682
00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:06.050
He says she's Independent.
Headstrong,
not materialistic.
Likes the same shit I do.

683
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.370
And we are always in sync whenever we get together.
Person to person,
basically.

684
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:12.710
Perfect for me.
And not to sound Corny,

685
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:14.780
at some point I fell in love with her though.

686
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.270
Don't ever apologize for falling in love with a woman.

687
00:43:17.271 --> 00:43:20.390
That's just some guy shit where you can't pretend like you want to be happy too.

688
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.860
Good for you.
He said,
but she's a lesbian at any rides.

689
00:43:24.861 --> 00:43:28.540
Oh,
Gigi Age.
Oh Wow.
Dude.

690
00:43:28.541 --> 00:43:31.700
Did you know that going into it?
They voice cracking.

691
00:43:31.701 --> 00:43:36.020
Did you know that going into it?
You didn't protect you fucking had,
um,

692
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:41.690
well you do with a chick thing when you think he can change her.
Uh,
all right.

693
00:43:41.691 --> 00:43:45.860
He says it's a bit of an emotional struggle.
I would think so.
He said,

694
00:43:45.861 --> 00:43:49.490
I've already shared my feelings and obviously they went nowhere.

695
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:54.260
So now you know,
I'm thinking now when you said she likes the same shit you like,

696
00:43:54.261 --> 00:43:55.094
yeah,

697
00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:01.280
I can see where you guys would be on the same page checking out the ladies.

698
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.550
It's anyways,
he goes to,
so now I've got a bottle that shit up inside.

699
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.770
It's been like that for almost a year.

700
00:44:06.771 --> 00:44:08.690
Part of me still wants to be friends with her,

701
00:44:08.691 --> 00:44:11.960
but the other parts of me tells me to forget about her and cut all

702
00:44:11.961 --> 00:44:16.760
communications off.
Yeah,
I mean,
are you just keep looking at her going,
oh,

703
00:44:16.761 --> 00:44:21.260
maybe she'll blow me today.
Ain't happening.
Uh,
he said,

704
00:44:21.261 --> 00:44:24.920
I'd feel like a Douche.
Fuck,
you guys are really creating odd,

705
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.450
like a vulgarities here.
A douche.
Fuck.
Okay.
That's a new one.

706
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.180
If I cut all ties and yet I know it's going to suck for me.
Emotional,

707
00:44:33.181 --> 00:44:37.080
as long as I'm friends with Tara because I'll never be with her or this feeling

708
00:44:37.081 --> 00:44:40.350
go away.
Eventually my friends keep telling me to forget about her,

709
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:43.680
but I will always be losing an awesome,
but I would also be losing it.
Awesome.

710
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:47.430
Fred too.
What do you think,
Bill?
Should I listen to my heart?
I'm like cock.

711
00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:51.420
Thanks.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Truly.
Uh,

712
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:56.420
let's see.
I would say a,

713
00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.800
<v 1>okay,</v>

714
00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.290
<v 0>listen to your heart or your car.
I don't know which ones to do.</v>

715
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:05.220
What your heart loves her.
And you also,
what a fucker.
Oh,

716
00:45:05.221 --> 00:45:07.410
you have to do is you need to do a combo.

717
00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.220
Like you have to have a sit down with both of your heart and your deck.

718
00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:12.750
It just be like,
look,

719
00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:14.363
<v 1>all right,</v>

720
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.830
<v 0>your deck has to dull the score at this point.
It happening.
Okay.</v>

721
00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.590
You,
Dick probably already has its fucking helmet off.

722
00:45:22.591 --> 00:45:24.880
It's taken as tape off and all that shit.
But your heart,

723
00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:26.673
<v 1>you know,</v>

724
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:32.570
<v 0>I don't know what you fucking are.
So listen to it.
I'm sorry I'm buzzed here.
Ah,</v>

725
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:36.380
what do I think you should do a,
yeah,
I think you should.

726
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:37.430
You should just walk away.

727
00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:43.420
You got to walk away and you got to be into some other chick first and then

728
00:45:44.481 --> 00:45:48.920
maybe you can start to be friends again.
But,
uh,
yeah,

729
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:52.370
it sounds like you've been a sad puppy dog with blue balls for a year.

730
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.970
And I'd say you've,
uh,
I think you've done your pets.

731
00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:01.520
You know,
why don't you go into the,
uh,
the open late?
Why don't you do that?

732
00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.390
I just opened the register.
Could I,

733
00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.800
can I have the next customer please go into that fucking line.

734
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:11.423
<v 1>Yeah,
right.</v>

735
00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:18.560
<v 0>Oh man,
that sucks.
I feel bad for you.
Do,
what are you going to do?</v>

736
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:22.430
You know,
I saw the other day on the cover of Espn,
ESPN magazine,

737
00:46:22.431 --> 00:46:24.860
they had one of those UFC chicks like totally naked,

738
00:46:24.861 --> 00:46:28.220
but with their fucking goddamn hands wrapped.

739
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:32.300
And I gotta tell you something man.
I think those,
those women are hot.

740
00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.130
They are fucking hot.

741
00:46:34.131 --> 00:46:37.010
And I think it would make you a better person if you could date.

742
00:46:37.011 --> 00:46:41.240
If you went out with a woman that could beat the shit out of you just because it

743
00:46:41.241 --> 00:46:43.610
would fall,
it would,
it would force you to be smarter.

744
00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:48.530
Where are reason why women are smarter than us is because basically speaking,

745
00:46:48.531 --> 00:46:51.860
we can fucking stuff I'm going to hamper if we want to.

746
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.600
So they have to opt smartest.

747
00:46:53.601 --> 00:46:56.150
So it's from day one they using their fucking braids.

748
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:01.520
We were just sitting there go and shut up,
you know,
using force.
There's not,

749
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:04.340
we're all fucking knees and elbows.
So what would happen is,

750
00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:08.060
is you would gain the wisdom of a female by kind of being the bitch and the

751
00:47:08.061 --> 00:47:11.960
relationship in that,
you know,
she could fucking slap you around.

752
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:17.540
Then you could learn to use tricks like guilt,
you know,
who knows,

753
00:47:17.541 --> 00:47:20.500
maybe she'd go out and get you a pair of shoes.
Right?

754
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:22.160
<v 4>I'm sorry.</v>

755
00:47:22.161 --> 00:47:26.660
So sorry that I put you in a Kamora.

756
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:28.303
<v 0>Uh,</v>

757
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.490
I've been meaning to that UFC show where they have the women in the house and

758
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.750
it's hard to watch women beaten the shit out of each other.

759
00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:37.330
There's like no way that they could hit him,
hit each other,

760
00:47:37.331 --> 00:47:41.410
that it's fucking pleasant to see.
Punched him in there.

761
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:45.130
Pretty faces or even worse where they take that fucking straight right to the

762
00:47:45.131 --> 00:47:47.680
left tit.
It's just like,
what are you doing?

763
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:49.410
<v 2>Okay.</v>

764
00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:51.690
<v 0>You know,
I met Pete massage monistic here,
but I just look,</v>

765
00:47:51.691 --> 00:47:52.920
that's like for a baby.

766
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.950
<v 2>Okay.</v>

767
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:59.030
<v 0>Why are they punching you and what are your fucking baby compartments?</v>

768
00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:03.500
Oh really?
I'm a moron.
I admitted,
you know,
whatever.
That's just how I look at it.

769
00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:07.370
I'll tell you what,
at least I'm honest,
at least I'm honest.
That's when,
you know,

770
00:48:07.371 --> 00:48:11.930
you said some ignorant shit and half the parties walking away from you.
Hey,
I,

771
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:16.280
hey.
You know,
I say what's on my mind.
I say what's up baby cell types?

772
00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:21.170
You shouldn't.
All right,
here we go.

773
00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.073
Ah,

774
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:23.640
<v 2>okay.</v>

775
00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:27.960
<v 0>I work at hell with no escape.
Hey,
Billy,
red beard,</v>

776
00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:29.093
the pirate.

777
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:34.240
I have a police officer in a town in New Jersey where I am at 11 year veteran.

778
00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:37.320
All right.
How are you?
Good there dude.
You're over the hub.

779
00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:41.160
What do you mean 20 years?
I said Cape bed.
Boles Hey,

780
00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.470
you got to do that for another nine years.
Uh,

781
00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:49.490
the department I worked for abuses those of us who have too much self respect to

782
00:48:49.621 --> 00:48:52.980
kiss ass.
All right?
Not about trying to be a dick,
sir,

783
00:48:52.981 --> 00:48:56.270
but you've already paid yourself as the hero here.
All right?

784
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.420
But I'm going to believe you,

785
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.580
<v 2>okay?</v>

786
00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:01.790
<v 0>Okay.
I'm going to believe that you actually do a good job.</v>

787
00:49:01.791 --> 00:49:05.060
And the reason why they don't like you is not because you're fucking,
uh,

788
00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:08.790
be the cud.
It's because you don't kiss any ass.
All right?

789
00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:10.280
I'm gonna go with that.

790
00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:15.970
He said it's gotten so bad that they suspend and even try to fire guys who don't

791
00:49:16.461 --> 00:49:18.320
bow down and kiss the ring.

792
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:24.140
It's the very definite definition of a hostile work environment and I'm terribly

793
00:49:24.141 --> 00:49:28.880
stressed out about the situation.
Now you may be asking yourself is,
it's so bad.

794
00:49:28.881 --> 00:49:31.610
Why don't you move on to another police department?
Thank you,
sir,

795
00:49:31.611 --> 00:49:35.480
for giving me the credit for being that intelligent to have that thought.

796
00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.130
Unfortunately,
I didn't,

797
00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:41.410
I was immediately thinking that you should get together with somebody at Fred's

798
00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:45.320
and become the surfer Akos out there.
You know,
it may be deep pants.

799
00:49:45.321 --> 00:49:49.420
You're fucking a CPO,
whatever the fuck his neighbors,
you know,

800
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:54.140
start Hayes and him have a little mutiny.
Uh,

801
00:49:54.141 --> 00:49:56.600
anyways,
he says,
well,
I've tried,
but the great,

802
00:49:56.630 --> 00:50:00.740
the great fucked up state of New Jersey has a rule that says if I transferred to

803
00:50:00.741 --> 00:50:01.820
another police department,

804
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.810
both of the department I work for and the department I want to go to have to

805
00:50:05.811 --> 00:50:07.970
approve and sign off on the transfer.

806
00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:10.790
I was this close to getting hired by another department.

807
00:50:10.791 --> 00:50:13.310
It was denied the transfer of all my current police chief,

808
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:18.620
or as I called him Satan.
Apparently they could do that.
I hate stress,

809
00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:21.680
but I have bad dreams about the place that it affects my mood.

810
00:50:21.681 --> 00:50:25.970
When I think about it,
even when I'm off,
my question to you is,
if I have stuck,

811
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:30.650
you're the worst work imaginable.
How do I shake off the bullshit and not worry?

812
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:35.420
Thanks for all the laughs and I underestimated your ticket selling ability in

813
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:38.270
New Jersey.
I was a little late trying to get to a tickets to red bank.
Oh,

814
00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:42.740
you know,
that's not that big a place,
sir.
Um,
but I appreciate the compliment.

815
00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:46.310
<v 1>Ah,
all right,</v>

816
00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:51.110
<v 0>well here's the deal.
You can't have a let some Aila cut</v>

817
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:56.510
affect your happiness,
happiness,
happiness.

818
00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.633
<v 1>All right.</v>

819
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:04.350
<v 0>It's all gonna come down to how you choose to react to what it is he's doing.</v>

820
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.870
That's the first step.
All right.

821
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:08.460
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

822
00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:12.920
<v 0>They'll be idle.
This is a completely different scenario.
But I remember,
uh,</v>

823
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000
I used to live above this fucking angry old man and he used to always yell at me

824
00:51:18.121 --> 00:51:20.370
every fucking thing I did,
my old apartment,
you know,

825
00:51:20.371 --> 00:51:21.450
and I dropped his cell phone.

826
00:51:21.451 --> 00:51:25.620
He keep it up to get all that shit and he yelled at me and all that shit.

827
00:51:25.621 --> 00:51:27.710
So I,
um,

828
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.660
I just started hitting him with positivity,

829
00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:34.973
<v 1>you know,</v>

830
00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:38.520
<v 0>me and Nia just started acting like he was attractive.</v>

831
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.550
I just walked by and be like,
Hey,
what do you say to had good look it.

832
00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:47.580
She'd whistle at him like he was sexy and it kind of brought up around in some

833
00:51:47.581 --> 00:51:51.540
weird way and I don't know if you can do that.
Can you do that?

834
00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:52.570
Can you fuck with your,

835
00:51:52.571 --> 00:51:57.260
your superior officer like that when it comes in and he's a cut to you and just

836
00:51:57.261 --> 00:52:01.020
just be,
hey guys,
sergeant,
you've been losing weight.
You're really fill it out.

837
00:52:01.021 --> 00:52:05.400
That uniform quite nicely.
Just keep doing that uncomfortable shit to them.

838
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:09.900
And then,
uh,
I dunno if he's truly as bad as you say.

839
00:52:09.901 --> 00:52:12.960
You can't tell me some of the other guys you work with don't feel the same

840
00:52:12.961 --> 00:52:13.794
fucking thing.

841
00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:19.800
I know you have the code of silence,
the Blue Code,
whatever the fuck it is,

842
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.190
you know.
But if somebody be that much of a deck,
it's subpar.

843
00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:27.990
Might say it a rat the guy out.
Well maybe,
you know,

844
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:32.940
can you organize something or is everybody's too nervous that they won't get

845
00:52:32.941 --> 00:52:36.660
another stripe on their fucking costume?
Is that what it is?

846
00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:40.830
I don't fucking know.
Sorry.
You know what is,
I can just tell you,
I feel for you.

847
00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:42.930
I don't know what to tell you.
You're talking about cops here.

848
00:52:42.931 --> 00:52:44.070
He's got a God damn gun.

849
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.900
<v 1>MMM.</v>

850
00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.160
<v 0>How would you start sending them flowers and chocolates?</v>

851
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:57.810
It like this positive way.
Just annoy the shit out of him.

852
00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:03.710
You know,
I leave a little love letters on his car.

853
00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:04.700
You don't need to sign it.

854
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:09.730
I would just start fucking with them just to give yourself something that is,

855
00:53:10.011 --> 00:53:11.210
he's be to cut to you.

856
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:15.680
You know that he's going to go out there and read,
you know,

857
00:53:15.681 --> 00:53:18.800
his secret male admirer,
love letter.
Just something.

858
00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:22.250
Something to fuck with the guy.
What else could you do?

859
00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:25.920
Ah,
there's the usual shit.
Laxatives

860
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:33.410
I would do,
I don't know what I would do.

861
00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:36.620
I would say like the Mary Tyler Moore Song to him every time he was a,

862
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.600
to me who can turn the world od with his smile.

863
00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:43.430
Well it's you sergeant.

864
00:53:43.431 --> 00:53:47.340
You should know it with each little county.

865
00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.350
Fucking move your show it.
Why are you such a deck?

866
00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:56.210
It's just fucking,
this is a great thing about humor.
If it's funny,

867
00:53:56.390 --> 00:54:00.530
it's fine.
You just got to make sure you get a laugh.
And other than that,

868
00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:04.220
I would,
uh,
you know,
dude,
you got another nine years.

869
00:54:04.221 --> 00:54:07.160
You can't let somebody take a decade from here.
So I would,

870
00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:10.730
I would do whatever it is I had to do,

871
00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:14.520
you know,
grab some beers with some of the other guys.

872
00:54:14.521 --> 00:54:17.150
You probably can't trust them.
There's always some kiss ass.

873
00:54:17.151 --> 00:54:20.670
It's going to fucking rat you out.
I don't want to ruin your career here.

874
00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.330
Jesus do it.
I don't know what to tell you.
I would just,
I mean,

875
00:54:24.331 --> 00:54:26.340
other than the fucking singing songs to him,

876
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:29.040
<v 2>okay,</v>

877
00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:31.770
<v 0>yeah.
Cubs entities telling you some shit you don't want to do.</v>

878
00:54:31.771 --> 00:54:34.140
Just look right at him and dead.
Serious abuse for like God,

879
00:54:34.141 --> 00:54:38.880
you've got beautiful eyes.
Just something like that.
Just keep fucking with them.

880
00:54:38.881 --> 00:54:42.150
Cause that's a way whether you can still carry out whatever country order he

881
00:54:42.151 --> 00:54:45.360
told you to do,
but you still hold onto a piece of yourself.

882
00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:47.760
That's the best I have for you.
Other than that,

883
00:54:47.761 --> 00:54:52.170
I would explore some sort of organized way.
Okay.

884
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:57.060
To fucking tip this guy over in his squad car.

959
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:03.040
I got laid while breaking bad was playing in the background from my computer.

960
00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:08.280
Okay,
well thank Vince Gilligan.
And then Amy,
uh,

961
00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.800
now I had a little trouble keeping the guy up during the act,

962
00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:15.670
even though she had the ass I would kill for to see again.

963
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:19.510
So while she was giving me head,
which was awesome by the way,
I look up,

964
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:23.840
what do I see or the TV,
Billy,
the freckled face card shows up in a truck.

965
00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:26.750
This is a true story,
by the way.
I remember that.

966
00:59:26.751 --> 00:59:29.060
That's when we shot that one at us.
Santa Fe.

967

I'm not gonna say anything else cause everybody,

969
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:38.910
let's just start at the theories.
Uh,

970
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.220
<v 1>yeah.</v>

971
00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:44.990
<v 5>How am I say I couldn't decide between keep watching the scene because I had the</v>

972
00:59:44.991 --> 00:59:48.740
seed.
You acting before or joining the blowjob.
Well,
dude,

973
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:53.540

I thought,
I love breaking bad.
This guy loves it.

975
00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:01.040
He says the whole situation was really awkward because I was imagining you

976
01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:06.020
saying stuff like,
dude,
why are you watching TV while getting a blow job?

977
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:10.850
What do you have egg?
Uh,

I actually started laughing,

978
01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.870
not thinking about how uncomfortable that would make her the poor girl.
Oh No.

979
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:18.200
I was struggling to keep it up while hearing you in my head going,

980
01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:23.720
this guy's a fig.
Uh,
that's my joke.
Making fun of people who will homophobic.

981
01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.320
By the way,

982
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.110
just to clarify it before I have to apologize to an overweight blogger on

983
01:00:28.111 --> 01:00:31.580
television.
Uh,
the remote control was not in my reach,

984
01:00:31.581 --> 01:00:36.210
so I had to watch the camera all today between two redheaded con

985
01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:41.110
Heisenberg and old Billy red face

986
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:46.790
Heisenberg's in a red ready and a shaved it.
You're talking about Jesse Plemons.

987
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:50.660
I don't fucking know.
He said.
Anyways,
thanks for ruining a great blow job.

988
01:00:50.661 --> 01:00:54.830
You can't,
I'll see you in Sweden in December.
Uh,
hey,

989
01:00:54.831 --> 01:00:57.170
my apology sir.
But you guys,
you know,

990
01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:58.940
<v 1>okay.</v>

991
01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:02.030
<v 5>I know that you're,
you're way over there in Sweden,
but I would think that you,</v>

992
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:03.500
that you guys have remote.
You,

993
01:01:03.501 --> 01:01:06.800
I know you have remote controls and you have pause buttons.
I've been there.

994
01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.753
<v 1>You know,</v>

995
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.660
<v 5>that's really weird,
sir.</v>

996
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:15.090
That made me uncomfortable with myself getting a blowjob in Sweden.

997
01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:15.953
Jesus Christ.

998
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:20.250
It was probably some chick that'd be a fucking 11 over here until you guys is

999
01:01:20.251 --> 01:01:24.980
just another,
uh,
just another chick from fucking Stockholm.
Right.

1000
01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:29.690
Um,
I always mentioned that whenever I go over there,
when you're in Stockholm,

1001
01:01:29.691 --> 01:01:32.210
the city of Stockholm,
it's just,
it's fucking ridiculous.

1002
01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.073
<v 1>Uh,</v>

1003
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:37.190
<v 5>not saying there aren't some regular looking people,</v>

1004
01:01:37.191 --> 01:01:41.660
but just the percentage of really good looking people is,
uh,

1005
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:45.080
you know,
I,
I'm a little,
I felt like a mongoloid when it was over there.

1006
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:46.520
Like I really need to,
like,
I had,

1007
01:01:46.521 --> 01:01:50.690
should have like a hump limping down the fucking street.
Um,

1008
01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:53.000
so anyways,
do check it off and uh,

1009
01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.300
I hope that girl didn't hear you laugh and while she was blowing you,

1010
01:01:56.301 --> 01:02:00.230
cause that could really affect her confidence.
So make sure you,

1011
01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:03.320
she knows why you will laugh at all.
Right.
And just say,
hey,

1012
01:02:03.321 --> 01:02:06.350
we're not going to watch TV this time.
And then she'll go to blow you again,

1013
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:10.310
and then just the sheer quietness in the room is going to make you start

1014
01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:13.010
thinking about my dumb face again.
You're going to laugh again.
You have an issue,

1015
01:02:13.011 --> 01:02:15.860
sir.
Uh,
all right.
The Opera Decker,

1016
01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:20.760
dear Saint Bill,
I'll get to the point asap.
My boss' book,

1017
01:02:20.761 --> 01:02:25.260
me a hotel without a fridge.
What I go to got to the hotel.

1018
01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:27.360
They told me their computers showed up,

1019
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:32.190
showed that the fridge fridges rubs had not been cleaned.
I ask,

1020
01:02:32.191 --> 01:02:34.320
could you just bump me up to one with the fridge?

1021
01:02:34.321 --> 01:02:36.780
Then they responded with the polite no.

1022
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:41.070
They then sent a guy to check if any other those rubs were clean.

1023
01:02:41.071 --> 01:02:43.740
The fridge hustle fridges rooms.
Uh,

1024
01:02:43.741 --> 01:02:46.380
they told me one of them was,

1025
01:02:46.381 --> 01:02:50.610
which I figured means it had been cleaned.
I took the room.

1026
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.440
I had four strong beers,
dog fish,
head,

1027
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:59.730
90 minute IPA.
I don't know what that means.
I know IPA is have more alcohol,

1028
01:02:59.731 --> 01:03:02.940
but I don't know what 90 minute means.
He said that it anyways,

1029
01:03:02.941 --> 01:03:07.860
he says that I went to take a shower.
I noticed that there was no soap,

1030
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.020
which means no one

1031
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.983
<v 0>fix the room.</v>

1032
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.880
That dude who checked must have just made the bed to top it off.

1033
01:03:14.881 --> 01:03:18.210
The toilet is not working.
Shit would notch flush.

1034
01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:19.373
<v 5>So</v>

1035
01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:24.810
<v 0>I took an opera decker inside the top part of the toilet.
My question is,</v>

1036
01:03:24.811 --> 01:03:29.790
am I an asshole?
P s this happened 20 minutes ago.
Still drunk.
Love you work.

1037
01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:32.760
Are you an asshole?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

1038
01:03:32.761 --> 01:03:37.761
You are an asshole because the person who manages that hotel is not the person

1039
01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:39.180
who has to clean out the toilet.

1040
01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:41.720
<v 1>And uh,</v>

1041
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:45.930
<v 0>oh,
you gotta do is just fuck over the person who's got to clean it up.
Yeah.</v>

1042
01:03:45.931 --> 01:03:47.130
He should've done that shit.
Come on,
man.

1043
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.033
<v 1>Come on.</v>

1044
01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:54.240
<v 0>Yeah.
The mature thing to do is you pick up the phone and you say,
yeah,</v>

1045
01:03:54.241 --> 01:03:57.960
I was said that this rule was ready.
It's not ready.
There's no soap in here.

1046
01:03:57.961 --> 01:04:00.810
This hasn't been,
basically the bed has been made.
The toilet's not working.

1047
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:02.363
That's what you do.

1048
01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:03.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1049
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:07.160
<v 0>You know,
you don't take a shit the top part of the fucking toilet.
All right.</v>

1050
01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.420
Shayla,
you have disappointed in you.
You know better than that.

1051
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:13.660
I'll give you a little bit of a slap suit.
Four beers in.
You already did that.

1052
01:04:13.661 --> 01:04:16.120
Thank God you didn't have eight.
You know,

1053
01:04:16.121 --> 01:04:20.650
he probably would have shit in the hall.
Uh,
wrap up.
Okay.
That's it.
People.

1054
01:04:20.651 --> 01:04:24.310
That's the podcast here.
Okay.
That's the head.

1055
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:28.260
See I did all right.
I did it right.
You got cell phone six hours,
five that it's,

1063

Bill a real quick,
my next big gigs coming up is a,
what is it?

1064
01:04:58.231 --> 01:05:01.110
November 7th,
eighth and ninth,

1065
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:06.360
three of the biggest gigs I've had up until this day.

1066
01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:07.933
Uh,

1067
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.720
I'm going to be at Constitution Hall in Washington DC.

1068
01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:15.950
I've got to be,
uh,
uh,

1069
01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:20.230
the beacon theater in York City and that I've got to be an upper Darby,

1070
01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:25.330
Pennsylvania.
Those dates are November 7th,
eighth and ninth.

1071
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:30.520
And as always,
I'm going to have the lovely Paul Versey opening for me.
Uh,

1072
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.220
that's a Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.

1073
01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:38.140
Um,
most of those,
the first show was sold out.

1074
01:05:38.141 --> 01:05:42.930
I think that's just one show in DC,
but there's two in New York and two in,
uh,

1075
01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:44.200
Phillipe.

1076
01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.680
So the first shows I believe are both sold out and the second one is going fast.

1077
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:52.420
So once again,
thank you to everybody who,
uh,
has bought up the tickets and uh,

1078
01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:55.720
I'm coming with the best hour that I've written.
That's what I like to think.

1079
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:59.590
And the weekend after that,
I'll be in deadwood,
South Dakota.

1080
01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:02.830
The Billy red state make updates.
The last three deadwood,

1081
01:06:02.831 --> 01:06:07.120
South Dakota on the 15th.
Tulsa,
Oklahoma at Brady theater,

1082
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:11.860
Tom Brady,
uh,
November 16th,
and the Orpheum theater,
Wichita,

1083
01:06:11.861 --> 01:06:15.280
Kansas,
November 17th.
Oh,
really quickly,
by the way,

1084
01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.500
the Broncos one again,
I got to tell you,
he's all,

1085
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:23.260
I'm seeing a flaw in that team is great as they look Bronco fans,

1086
01:06:23.261 --> 01:06:24.760
I want to hear from you.
I'm not being a dick,

1087
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:30.400
but they're looking like that classic regular season team that scores a zillion

1088
01:06:30.401 --> 01:06:32.920
points.
But let's up half a zillion.

1089
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:37.780
And I found that those teams tend to lose in the playoffs.
Playoffs,

1090
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:42.400
the San Diego,
the air corps,
yell chargers,
the Dan Marino dolphins,

1091
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:47.920
the fucking greatest show on turf rams the year we beat them,

1092
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:52.830
the year the giants beat the fucking undefeated patriots.
Um,

1093
01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:56.700
that shit catches up with you because when you go to the playoffs,

1094
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:58.840
you're going to be playing teams with great defense.

1095
01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:01.990
And when they slice your offense and half,

1096
01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:06.250
but your defense can't step it up,
all of a sudden you got a close game.

1097
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:09.940
And next thing you know,
you lose 20 to 17.
You like,
what the fuck happened?

1098
01:07:09.941 --> 01:07:12.970
We scored 9 million points to season.
All right,
Ben there as a fan,

1099
01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:17.590
what do you think we're taking filed calls right now?
Uh,
that's it.

1100
01:07:17.591 --> 01:07:20.590
That's a podcast for this week.
I'll fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
