5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.360
2015 the final Monday that there will ever be in May of 2015.

6
00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:20.680
Let me ask you,
let me ask you,
what are you gonna do about it?
Huh?

7
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.690
You ain't doing shit today,

8
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.330
I don't hear a fucking word out of anybody if this podcast,

9
00:00:25.331 --> 00:00:29.410
if you consider it late,
you,
self-involved jackass.

10
00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:33.880
If you consider it late,
you got the day off anyways,
don't ya?
Well,

11
00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:34.571
if you don't,

12
00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:39.130
you have a shit job or your work for yourself because when you work for
yourself,

13
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.150
you fucking money never sleeps or whatever dumb shit they say in some fucking

14
00:00:43.151 --> 00:00:46.900
hip hop songs.
You know what I mean?
I hate,
I'll fucking dramatic.

15
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.880
They try to make every Goddamn fucking moment,
you know,
not all rappers,

16
00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:56.140
but just in general money,
never sleep.
More money,
more problems.
Not really.

17
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.830
Not if you would just move away from the toxic element that you grew up in.

18
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.030
You know,
if he'd start buying some uh,
uh,

19
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.190
some assets,
if he had your money,
make money,
then you don't have them.

20
00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:15.340
You don't have more problems.
Stay out of the club.

21
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.040
You have enough fucking money to,

22
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:21.740
to bring some bitches over to your house you don't want and you don't need that

23
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:25.020
go out.
Yeah.

24
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.500
Know you're just fucking let me give a little fucking old white guy to rapper

25
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.990

Just fucking once you make your money,

26
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.470
get the fuck out of there and don't listen to those assholes all.
Yeah.

27
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:44.400
You forgot where you came from?
No.
No.
I remember where it came from.

28
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.280
That's what you don't see is what you don't understand.

29
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.210
I remember exactly where I came from.
All right.
You want me to come back?

30
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:54.030
I'll come back during the day when all you maniacs is still sleeping,

31
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.890
not coming back at night.

32
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.470
<v 0>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.390
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
You come back during the day,</v>

34
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:00.950
come back at like 10 in the morning.

35
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.540
If you want to make a fucking positive impact,
come back at 10 in the morning.

36
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.390
You know when the good people are getting up.
Right.
You know,

37
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.470
watching their kids,
you know,
you already went to work or whatever.

38
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:16.540
That's the deal.
But that's second shift comes in.

39
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:21.070
That's when you get the fuck out.
I,
that's what I would do.
I don't know.

40
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.770
I mean,
that exists at all levels.
You know what I mean?
What to you?
Some fucking,

41
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.470
yeah,
just some jackass from the suburbs.
You know what you gotta do?

42
00:02:29.471 --> 00:02:31.180
You gotta get out of it.
You've got to get out of the time.

43
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.300
Whatever town you're from with is still wearing the football.

44
00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:36.700
Jacket's going down to the water and whole.
Right.

45
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.300
Yo

46
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.710
uh,
no,
I don't think I'm too good for you.
I take up too good for this.

47
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.240
I'd like a little more than this if you don't mind.

48
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.510
That's all you got to do.
You just,
you just fucking,

49
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.300
you fucking have a bar in your house.
That's what you do.

50
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.340
Right?
And then what you do is you invite your friends over your friends,

51
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.330
people you know.
Okay.
Then if you want some horrors or whatever,

52
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:14.650
you have them come over.
He flipped on the security camera until there's no fuck.

53
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:16.990
And he said,
she said,
right,

54
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.300
you give the pimp a little fucking throat coat tea or whatever and his fucking

55
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:24.970
Sas Barilla,
whatever the fuck he wants to drink.
You have a nice evening.

56
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:28.690
Everybody goes home,
think bang,
boom,
done.
You need to do all of that.

57
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:31.990
And you Cabana,
you don't have them in your real house.

58
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.420
That's what you do.
And I'll fucking go back down in the seat.
God Damn.

59
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.150
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?
What am I talking about?
I Dunno.

60
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.150
Audition out advice like I have any business giving anybody advice.

61
00:03:44.151 --> 00:03:46.790
You know what?
I have a bar in my house.
You know,

62
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:50.460
it's just been a bunch of bottles laying around,
you know,
I'm fucking,
you know,

63
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.990
take a bite out of him every fucking God damn day.
You know what?

64
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.030
I'm at my heaviest I've ever been.
I've been talking to you guys,

65
00:03:59.031 --> 00:04:01.100
sing in the gym song and all that.
You know what?

66
00:04:01.101 --> 00:04:06.050
That southern tour and then the 19 shows and then I got sick and then I fucking

67
00:04:06.051 --> 00:04:09.350
Jew.
He kept eating like an animal and I'm at my heaviest.

68
00:04:09.351 --> 00:04:11.510
I've been in fucking six years and I'll tell you right now,

69
00:04:11.511 --> 00:04:15.770
I'm disgusted with myself.
Oh,
belly fat again.
Oh,

70
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.360
Billy red velvet.
Oh Man,

71
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.960
what did I do?
Uh,
Jesus,
I got to fuck.
You know what I did?

72
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.370
I did everything I tell you guys not to do.
I did.
And then,
um,

73
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.030
I had a flight yesterday,
so I do weight and balance.

74
00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:35.300
So I had to get on the fucking scale and I got on with my clothes and it said

75
00:04:35.301 --> 00:04:38.630
one 90.
You know what?
I weighed myself this morning.

76
00:04:38.631 --> 00:04:43.480
I was one 86 without fucking shoes and cell phones and all that shit.
But,
uh,

77
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.530
uh,
God,
I'm so disgusted with myself.
I need to lose 15 fucking pounds,

78
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.070
15 fucking pounds.
So what did I do?
I did the usual,
oh,
fuck this.

79
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.370
Fuck the shop getting in shape.
You know,

80
00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:57.860
when you do that and fucking lasts for about 12 hours.

81
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.810
So I'm about 12 hours in after I weighed myself.

82
00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:07.280
I was so fucking disgusted.
He had a good lesson though.
And then,

83
00:05:07.281 --> 00:05:12.230
uh,
I came home and I finished off the salad with salmon.

84
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.000
And then for dinner I had a fucking black bean burger,

85
00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:21.530
no bun with a side salad,
you know,
ah,

86
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.670
crushed me to order that.
And then,
but now I gotta tell you after I ate it,

87
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:26.710
I felt great,
felt great,

88
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:30.240
and I drank waters the rest of the night and to figure it out,
right.
You know,

89
00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:33.370
with clothes on everything in one 90.
So I'm probably about one 85,

90
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:35.920
one 86 eating like this.
I'll wake up in the morning,

91
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:38.980
I'll probably be about one 84,
right?
Woke up in the morning,

92
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:43.930
one 86.8 I'm a fat freckled fuck right now.

93
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.020
I'm a fucking flounder.
I don't like it.

94
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.440
I'm not even a button down shape right now.

95
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:54.280
You know that when your buttons get to fucking,
they start having a fucking,

96
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.700
you know that that stress mark,
uh,
sides of the shirt is,

97
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:00.680
it's holding it together.
I think he's doing a joke about that.

98
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:03.230
Mac with a button was like an I or doing the iron cross,

99
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.230
trying to hold both sides together.
It's fucking horrible.

100
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.330
It's absolutely horrible.
So I dunno,
I ate my way into it.

101
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:14.480
I got to eat my way out of it cause I don't really have time to fucking go to

102
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:17.990
nuts.
I did take my dog on a two hour hike today,
but,
um,

103
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.950
I don't know what an asshole.
You don't,
you don't really fuck me.
Sent me,

104
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:26.360
I've been off the rails on and off the rail since November or October when I

105
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:28.310
started,
uh,
sat in the writer's room.

106
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.720
F is for family and I started working eight hours a day and we started ordering

107
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:37.280
lunch and all that type of shit and I felt myself putting it on like five
pounds.

108
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.090
Then I held the five pounds in the right to the fucking holidays through on

109
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:44.630
another three.
And then somewhere,
I don't know,
in March,

110
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:47.210
I started going back to the gym after I was back.

111
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.950
I was up till I was like [inaudible] 72 before this shit star.

112
00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:52.100
Then I will fuck went up into the one eighties again.

113
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.570
Then it was coming down to like one 79 and then the southern tour came out the

114
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:59.870
other fucking side of it at ward 86.
I mean,

115
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:04.220
I guess that's not bad against six bucks,
seven pounds.
Ah,

116
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.190
fucking worst.
Every time I go to set up,

117
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:10.640
I feel like I'm fucking got a kid as a kid grown in me,

118
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.710
a little fat fucking kid.
Um,
anyways,

119
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.850
so last night I stayed in for the first night since I can even fucking remember

120
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.570
I didn't drink.
You know,
I always have a couple of drinks.

121
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:25.820
I'm not going to lie to you.
There's no reason for me not to.

122
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.450
I don't have any children.
All right.
You'd be doing it too.
Don't judge me.

123
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.520
So last night I'm staying in,
you know,
took my dog for a walk around the block,

124
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.800
staring down at my stomach,

125
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.290
fucking looking at myself in the mirror.
Go and look at you fat shaming myself.

126
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:44.510
Look what you did.
Look at you.

127
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.510
You're a fucking mess,
right?
Awful fucking awful.
Right?

128
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:51.100
So,

129
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.050
you know what's even worse was I continued to fucking lift weights as I put on

130
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:58.430
all this weight.
So now I look like that classic fucking,
uh,
you know,

131
00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:00.180
the only thing I'm missing,
this is like,
you know what,

132
00:08:00.181 --> 00:08:04.430
that guy that keeps fucking working out,
but he keeps eating like an asshole.

133
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.660
So he's got the pecs and the shoulders and he's just got that fucking awful gut

134
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.411
right?

135
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:12.790
And then he's got the tight button down and you just see the fucking shirts

136
00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:16.220
struggling every time the guy fucking reaches over to grab another potato skin.

137
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:20.840
That's the kind of fucking shape I'm in right now.
Um,
so anyway,

138
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:25.640
so I stayed in last night and uh,
I just watched TV,
you know,

139
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.740
which is always good when you're trying to drop weight,
whatever.

140
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:30.620
I didn't fucking drink,
go fuck yourself.
So,
uh,

141
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:33.560
I watched that you watch that rich kids of Beverly Hills.

142
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.020
It's fucking unbelievable.
It's just one of those things.

143
00:08:37.021 --> 00:08:41.850
My wife tapes a bunch of Shit,
you know,
if for some fucking reason,
you know,

144
00:08:41.851 --> 00:08:44.070
she's always telling me she doesn't delete my shit.

145
00:08:44.071 --> 00:08:48.480
But whenever I come off the road,
all my shows,
you know,
fast and loud,

146
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.970
where's all the fast and loud?
Where's all,
hey,

147
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:57.340
where's all the fast and loud?
You know,

148
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.070
I yelled at,
cause I know she's up and she's just like,
oh wow.

149
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.580
I didn't do anything.
Really.
It's not recording the series anymore.

150
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:06.580
How does that happen?

151
00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:11.610
If I hit record series and then I go on the road and I leave,

152
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.610
what happened?
Are you going to tell me it was a malfunction?

153
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.140
How come whatever it malfunctions the,
the,
the dead DV.

154
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:25.240
Why does it always malfunction on the shit I want to record,
you know,

155
00:09:25.241 --> 00:09:29.230
I don't fucking know.
So anyways,
so I'm like,
all right,
any port in a storm?

156
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.770
I watched the rest of that show.
The comedians,

157
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.760
one of my favorite new shows that in last man on earth of course.

158
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:42.370
Um,
so great to see Billy crystal again.
You know,
such a big fan.

159
00:09:42.371 --> 00:09:46.000
He is,
man.
He's fucking hilarious on that show.
And,
uh,

160
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.310
I don't know if you guys have seen the show.

161
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:53.310
I just love how Josh gads character has no idea all the accomplishments that

162
00:09:54.941 --> 00:09:58.810
Billy crystal is,
uh,
has gotten over the years.
It,
it'd be like,
yeah,
you know,

163
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.570
I'm up for a kid's choice of work and can you believe that?
Can you believe it?

164
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.770
And he's like,
yeah,
I'm up for one too.
He's like,
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He goes,
yeah,

165
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.610
yeah.
He goes,
I've won that.
I've won one of those.
He just really,
I,

166
00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:13.420
I know it.
I just love that he has no fuck.
That's so,

167
00:10:13.421 --> 00:10:18.190
such like a sobering thing in this fucking,

168
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.980
I guess in life in general is where you're going to accomplish all this shit.

169
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.250
You just think you're going to be the fucking man and you just don't understand

170
00:10:24.251 --> 00:10:28.450
that there's a whole generations of kids that are coming up that could give a

171
00:10:28.451 --> 00:10:31.060
fuck,
which is why

172
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.580
if you make money,
at some point you got to become a lender,
Lord.

173
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:44.290
Oh,
I'm on my way.
I'm on my way.
I'm going to do it.

174
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.630
I'm going to fucking do it.
I always said I was never going to do it,

175
00:10:46.631 --> 00:10:48.040
but I'm going to do it.
I was like,

176
00:10:48.041 --> 00:10:50.230
I don't want to be fucking dealing with fixing toilets and shit.

177
00:10:50.231 --> 00:10:52.260
I'm not going to do,
that'll get someone to manage the building form,

178
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:56.760
going to buy something.
I got to do it.
That's my,
is it strategy?
Right?

179
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.920
Stead of going out and buying a bunch of Shiny Shit,
right?

180
00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:06.840
Going down to the club and getting in trouble.
No,
you stay at home.

181
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.550
You drink yourself just shy of 200 pounds.
What?

182
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:14.010
You check out real estate,
that's what you do.

183
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.710
So as you set yourself up financially,

184
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.400
you simultaneously destroy your heart and liver,

185
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.553
right?

186
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.270
And then you stick it all in a will he need give it to your wife and that one

187
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:31.200
day,
right?
He's sitting there but an egg salad sandwich.

188
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.650
You're down at the track.
Come on,
Yo.
Six said,

189
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.280
next thing you know you're slumped over the rail.

190
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:43.050
Take a horse tail or the face and it's fucking over.
That's it.
It's over.

191
00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:45.660
But you know what?
Everybody in your life,
his sight,

192
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.610
he was really smart with his money.
Oh Shit.
Thank God.
Thank God God bless him.

193
00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:54.570
You know he died doing what he loved doing what he loves.

194
00:11:54.571 --> 00:11:59.571
Screaming at the horses with a 0.3 blood alcohol level,

195
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.300
having a massive coronary.
That's what he liked to do.

196
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.830
Do you know he had seven heart yet?
Seven,
seven.

197
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.870
I wasn't sex.
I thought it was salmon.

198
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:17.110
You know all the old bitches who never die sitting there on the coffee shop just

199
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:21.760
chatting away,
chatting away,
right?
Burning calories running their fucking yaps.

200
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:25.410
They live.
They live forever.
That's what fucking kills me.

201
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:28.220
All these broads going on TV,
bitch moaning and complaining.

202
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.920
We now get this and we don't get that.
You fucking live forever.
Hey,

203
00:12:31.921 --> 00:12:33.090
look who's here.
Wow,

204
00:12:33.091 --> 00:12:38.091
you look fucking amazing possible for you to do the podcast and not scream at

205
00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:42.540
the top of your fucking lungs.
Is it possible for you to do that?

206
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.350
You're too good to be true.

207
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.680
Can't take my eyes framing my name just a second ago.

208
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.140
Why were you screaming?
Cause I wanted you to come up here.
You dummy.
I know,

209
00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:58.800
but you can do it in a little bit more of a positive way and not call me a dummy

210
00:12:58.801 --> 00:13:03.480
as well.
What's the,
it's quite all right.

211
00:13:03.481 --> 00:13:08.120
Pull up a fucking chair.
Pull up a chair and grab a microphone.
You asshole.

212
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.560
And I want to,
I want you to explain to me your,
you,

213
00:13:10.561 --> 00:13:13.860
you have limited time on this podcast today because

214
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.370
fucking look at me like that.
All right.
Listen,
don't get a fucking chair.

215
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.720
Why don't you have a chair in here?
This office is a disgrace.

216
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.850
It's a disgrace as my fucking torso.
One 86.8 and year.

217
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.850
That's what you're banging a big fucking flounder.

218
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.800
I'm getting older.
I'm getting,
I'm rapidly approaching.
Get on top.

219
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.790
Get on top weight.
Oh God.
You Still gonna love me Mia.

220
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.500
When that brow sweat is raining down on you like the fucking Goddamn,

221
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.760
I don't know.
Something about the rain forest would have flux.
The microphone.

222
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.170
So we put a cap on both of our weight.
You look great.

223
00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.500
Thank you.
What the fuck is my,
uh,
there's,
there's a,
there's another mic in,

224
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:03.540
in the,
uh,
in the thing there.

225
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.040
Can't stop eating like a pig.

226
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:13.210
He's a fat freckled.
Fuck I fucking hate myself right now.
Yeah.

227
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.300
Hey,
good.
Put the,
put the windscreen on Jesus Christ.
God Damn fucking.

228
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.250
Here we go.
Here we go.
Setting up the microphone.
Ladies and gentlemen,

229
00:14:23.251 --> 00:14:24.570
coming to the podcast.

230
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.970
Oh my God.
There you go.
How's this?
That's very good.

231
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.380
Now I want to know something near.
Okay.
You're adorable.

232
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.080
You're beautiful.
Even when you snore,
it's cute as opposed to me.
Right?

233
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.380
Let me ask you this.
How would I go on the road is fast and loud.
Yeah.

234
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.620
I series
recorded.

235
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.330
We've made that point like nine times.

236
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.670
<v 3>I just want people to be clear that this is just a thing that you do.</v>

237
00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.740
I rag,
I did that.
I did that.
So I can have you come up here.
All right.

238
00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.000
And I gotta tell you something else.

239
00:15:03.001 --> 00:15:07.200
And yet this screaming that I do that puts Froot loops on the table.
Oh my God.

240
00:15:07.201 --> 00:15:11.470
I knew that's where you were going.
Why?
Because of your screaming.
That's right.

241
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:15.840
Yeah.
Yeah,
I got it.
They love it.
I know,

242
00:15:15.841 --> 00:15:20.130
but we are not every time.
We are not retired.
I am not an audience.

243
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.970
I don't need you to be screaming like your life.

244
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.350
It need a nice favor for the stage.
So we'd had saved before the fucking stage.

245
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.360
Every time you sit down and eat a nice crunchy cereal,
you gotta say to yourself,

246
00:15:33.361 --> 00:15:37.340
thank God my husband screams like a lunatic.
Right?
Ah.

247
00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.790
So what are you talking about?
Fast and loud?

248
00:15:38.791 --> 00:15:41.310
I told you I don't know what happened.
Yeah.
Okay.

249
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.920
Don't point your finger at me while you sitting there giving me shit about

250
00:15:43.921 --> 00:15:45.780
screaming and yelling last night.
I'm trying to go to bed.

251
00:15:45.781 --> 00:15:49.740
And You have watching that Frankie Valli musical.
Yeah.
Yeah.

252
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.360
And I'm trying to sleep every fucking five seconds.
You were asleep though.

253
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.070
<v 0>Shit,
I can't do it.</v>

254
00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.700
<v 3>You already kind of have a higher pitched voice,</v>

255
00:16:02.701 --> 00:16:06.570
so it's actually not hard for you to go into that register.
That wasn't bad.

256
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.410
Listen,
don't compliment me because you're watching your fucking TV.

257
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.590
After that shoe was better on stage then it wasn't a movie virgin.

258
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:21.160
It looked great.
Well,
thank you.
Mimi Ebert.
Who?

259
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.360
Who in God's name would care what you think about a fucking movie?

260
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.510
Why do you have me up here then if you're just going to be an asshole to me,

261
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.130
I thought,
Oh God,

262
00:16:29.131 --> 00:16:34.131
what is wrong with this is how I say I love you.

263
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:39.140
I know why.
Why did no one forever a seventh grade boy pulling pigtail?

264
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.960
Shut your face.
Why?
Why does fast and loud not record it?

265
00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:43.750
This is like the ninth time I have asked.

266
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.370
I know you've asked me nine times and I'm answering your nine times.

267
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.420
I don't know.
I don't know why I haven't erased.
It's interesting.

268
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.820
I take games and I come back and the games that you don't,

269
00:16:53.821 --> 00:16:58.140
what happens is you're sitting here and you're taping two things at once,
right?

270
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:02.190
Our DVR has the capability to take five things at once and I've never taped five

271
00:17:02.191 --> 00:17:06.290
things at once,
so even if I did have two things going on at once,
you're,

272
00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:11.250
I don't know.
It's all my stuff.
I don't know.
Bill,
I don't know.

273
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.870
Is there anything worse than when you think you think you have them?

274
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.580
I thought we still had the old school ones.
Well,
back in the day,
well,

275
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.560

but what's happening right now?
You still come and wait.

381
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.200
Circling the wagon back around to the same guy who I don't feel good.

389
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:35.650

392
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.670
Uh,

I don't know what it's just because of it.

393
00:24:47.671 --> 00:24:49.650
That doesn't mean that I would know every female,

394
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:53.730
but that doesn't make any sense.
But you don't know any of them.

395
00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:59.750
Oh,

397
00:25:02.881 --> 00:25:06.930
one of them did.
Dr Temple Grandin.
Oh yes.
Uh,

398
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.770
she was the woman who invented the thing for cows.

399
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.760
So when they were going to slaughter they wouldn't be freaking out like the sort

400
00:25:14.761 --> 00:25:19.200
of like a little pressurized thing that's on them cause she had like autism or

401
00:25:19.201 --> 00:25:20.930
something like that.
You got some of it.

402
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:25.940
The thing that usually amazes people about most about prolific woman inventor,

403
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:31.860
Dr Temple Grandin is not all the great stride she has made to improve animal

404
00:25:31.861 --> 00:25:33.480
handling devices.
You nailed it.
Yeah.

405
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.810
Nor the fact that she earned a phd in animal science.

406
00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:41.530
Why is that amazing?
You know what?

407
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:44.080
You are such a fucking Douche bag.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.150
Goodbye.

412
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.930
You guys drove a garbage truck and you're laying out of a god damn garbage truck

413
00:25:58.931 --> 00:26:02.620
down to the train to be a lifetime movie over and over and over again.

414
00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.320
Promises that you've been doing for the last time.
Oh Shit.
You know,

415
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:13.010
I like it.
Come on.
You're being a baby about this.
I'm not the in a baby.

416
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:17.290
You're being an aide.
I'm breaking my balls.
You get no fresh down there.
I A,

417
00:26:17.291 --> 00:26:20.980
I know who she is because there was an HBO movie about it starting called.

418
00:26:20.981 --> 00:26:25.750
There you go.
Thank God.
I know your kids sit down and read.
All right.
Really?
Bill,

419
00:26:25.751 --> 00:26:30.751
what was the last book you read and fucking Steven Adler is biography.

420
00:26:30.821 --> 00:26:34.480
Does it count?
I think that might've been the last one.

421
00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.260
I read the fairy 2014 book.

422
00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.380
Alright,
whatever.
So you know,
so you guys,
you know you could kind of,

423
00:26:44.381 --> 00:26:46.410
nice little list here.
What?

424
00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:52.260
I can't believe you felt the need to go online as it does somehow way did women

425
00:26:52.301 --> 00:26:55.120
invent things?
Like what is wrong with you?
You,

426
00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.440
I really had to keep asking that question.
Hey,

427
00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.120
is it because you're 46 year old white man from Boston?
Like is it,

428
00:27:01.121 --> 00:27:03.310
can I really just distill it down to your stats?

429
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.150
<v 1>Can I ask you a question?
You know you can't.</v>

430
00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.490
I want you to name some women inventors,
temple Grandin

431
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:14.360
<v 3>I keep saying Marie Curie didn't choose you talking all this shit like I can't</v>

432
00:27:14.361 --> 00:27:16.640
believe above blah blah,
blah.
But you don't even have the,

433
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.920
you don't even have the bullets in your gun.
You're over there.
Yep.

434
00:27:18.921 --> 00:27:22.190
You're shooting blanks.
I don't need to have bullets and my,
I know you don't.

435
00:27:22.191 --> 00:27:24.910
All you gotta do is start pitching and everybody listens to you.

436
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:25.783
I'm smart enough.

437
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.530
You're the one going online like a prehistoric.

438
00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.060
Don't blow your nose into the microphone.
Jesus.
How are you still sick anyway?

439
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.510
<v 1>Hey listen,
cause I'm up all night trying to find something you guys</v>

440
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.570
<v 3>did.
If anybody takes his fucking seriously,</v>

441
00:27:45.571 --> 00:27:47.070
go fuck yourselves.

442
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.250
You know somebody is going to take a little clip of this and send it to some

443
00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:54.720
clambake fucking site and I'll get in trouble.
Yeah,

444
00:27:54.721 --> 00:27:58.590
whatever the fuck they are.
Oh my God.
Let's just focus.

445
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.810
Let's just focus on the Nigga.
I swear to God,

446
00:28:00.811 --> 00:28:03.900
when I went to India and I saw that Todd that take a ship between two parked

447
00:28:03.901 --> 00:28:06.210
cars at fucking,
I don't in Sab.
Yeah.
I don't want any

448
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.340
<v 1>plated.
She's sitting there with a brooch.
You wearing a brooch.</v>

449
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.840
That's more than that kid will ever have.
What is your problem?

450
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.010
What are you talking about,
Bro?
Whenever those women get on TV,
start complaining,

451
00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:20.430
they start dressing like fucking Eleanor Roosevelt.

452
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.620
Don't they put on a wool suit?

453
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.550
When's the last time you saw anyone where a brooch that wasn't like,

454
00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.920
I thought the people in Canada were wearing it,

455
00:28:28.921 --> 00:28:30.630
but it had to do with World War One veterans.

456
00:28:30.631 --> 00:28:33.810
I thought that was a broach and I've got a bunch of shit about that.
You know,

457
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:37.710
let's thank you here.
Thankfully the Canadians are very forgiving people.

458
00:28:37.711 --> 00:28:40.590
You know,
if you can have a couple of donuts down at Timmy Ho's and they're fine.

459
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:46.590
Who Do you like for the Stanley company?
Um,
the Bruins were going to,

460
00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:50.280
oh Geez.
We didn't make the La Kings kings go,
neither one of them.

461
00:28:50.281 --> 00:28:53.940
You're all for two.
Oh,
those La kings getting Wednesday.
We're fun though.

462
00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:58.500
They were.
I did enjoy it.
It was,
wasn't very surprised at how enjoyable it was.

463
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.120
Why we went.
There you go.

464
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.710
You know that if I said the same thing about women inventors,

465
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:03.920
I'd be a fucking chauvinist.

466
00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.550
<v 3>I don't understand how me going to a hockey game for the first time.</v>

467
00:29:07.551 --> 00:29:11.960
It's like you tending to not no more.
It's called humor.
Oh,

468
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:16.250
okay.
It's called the joke.
Ha Ha.
Well,
thanks for explaining that bill.

469
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.960
Thank God you're here to explain things.

470
00:29:17.961 --> 00:29:20.800
Things got a man is here to explain things to a woman.

471
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:25.880
<v 1>It's okay.
You didn't understand it.
It's okay to not understand things.</v>

472
00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.690
Where are the questions for this week's podcast?

473
00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.990
I don't think we're up to that point yet.
I don't even have the advertising yet.

474
00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.810
Oh,

I was really psyched that the Blackhawks won game too.
I mean,

599
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:39.110
games make it to two.
Sorry,

600
00:37:39.111 --> 00:37:42.920
Only because I want to see that thing go seven games because uh,

601
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:46.670
it's just a hockey at the highest level.
And

602
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:53.030
what is that?
Like this thing that happened to him during some game?

603
00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:58.190
What happened?
Oh,
I was looking at his other leg.
No,
the woman.
Oh,

604
00:37:58.191 --> 00:38:02.660
you're back to two.
Uh,

What happened?
That's a bruise from what?
Getting hit.

606
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:12.020
Throw it back.
So when this happened in the first half of the bills game,
I dunno,

607
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:16.190
he slid on something.
I don't know.
I've never played football.
He got hit dude.

608
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:19.970
His legs looked like these 80.
Anyways,

609
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.680
Nia and my hair.

obviously I think a woman should make when a guy makes.

610
00:38:24.681 --> 00:38:26.450
Okay,
but you guys need to let your fucking hair.
Now,

611
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:27.680

612
00:38:27.681 --> 00:38:31.840
Every once in a while they'll get no fucking employee.
Anybody fucking relax.

613
00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.360
I can't wait for you guys to make as much as make.

614
00:38:35.361 --> 00:38:38.870
Maybe once you go into a bar and maybe throw down a fucking c note by around,

615
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:43.670
how do you know I haven't bought a round of drinks for somebody because I've

616
00:38:43.671 --> 00:38:47.790
known you for 10 years.
They're buying me a drink.
Yeah.

617
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:51.950
After all I do for you is,
is a fucking joke.
Okay.

618
00:38:51.951 --> 00:38:55.970
You're thrown a nickel into an ocean here.
All right.
What else do I do for you?

619
00:38:55.971 --> 00:38:58.020
I'm talking about when,

620
00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.010
when have you ever just walked into a fucking bar,

621
00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:05.660
slam down a fucking scene note and just bought a round of drinks for people

622
00:39:05.661 --> 00:39:06.880

No,
I don't even,</v>

624
00:39:09.361 --> 00:39:12.570
I don't even know if you ever done that and throw down and see,
you know,

625
00:39:12.571 --> 00:39:16.370
just cause you were having a great fucking day at the a drink.
Some may

626
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:21.020
like that.
Like that was totally done that to

627
00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:25.390
<v 1>a speakeasy,
which is never a speakeasy cause it's legal,
but they had its design.</v>

628
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:29.810
And when we were in,
uh,
in,
in Denver,
me and Jason Lyon,

629
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:33.590
we go in there,
we're going to go to the Broncos.
Uh,

630
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:38.330
sounds like the first game of the NFL season.
That'd be weird.

631
00:39:38.331 --> 00:39:40.930
Don't be the money that they won the Superbowl anyway.

632
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:42.830
Oh cause it was against the Steelers or the n one.

633
00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.590
I can't fucking remember whatever went to the bar.
So we go to the box,

634
00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:48.620
I 80 day and um,
oh shut up.

635
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:51.560
So we go to the bar and they had a,
they had this,

636
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:56.860
I don't know what the fuck it was,
but it was like 60 years old.
Okay.
All right.

637
00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:58.580
It was,
it was,
I don't know what it was.

638
00:39:58.581 --> 00:40:01.820
Whatever you can have everything else turns to like fucking vinegar.
What was it?

639
00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.540
A Cognac,
what?
Couldn't be like 60 years old.
I Dunno.
I don't know.

640
00:40:05.541 --> 00:40:08.510
So what happened was like fucking like 90 bucks a shot.

641
00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:14.270
So I just had a great run of dates and I said,
fuck it.
I said,
La head.
I said,

642
00:40:14.271 --> 00:40:16.250
we're doing this.
He goes,
dude,
you can't do that.
I go,
fuck that.

643
00:40:16.251 --> 00:40:18.470
Come on first gave me NFL season.
Who gives a shit?

644
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.680
Governments taking them on money anyway,
so let's do that.
Right?
So the bartender,

645
00:40:21.681 --> 00:40:23.420
I see it,
he goes,
oh my God.
It was like a,

646
00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:26.370
that's like the greatest people at the bar.
Bartenders.
We always,

647
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:29.540
he's a young kid.
We want to do the shot.
And I said,
all right,

648
00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:34.250
I go and buy a new a shot too.
He goes,
no,
no,
no,
I can't do that.
I can't do that.

649
00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:39.230
And whatever his name was,
I was like,
Doug,
yes she can.
So then he said,

650
00:40:39.231 --> 00:40:40.850
all right.
He goes,
this is the thing.

651
00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:45.620
Can I split the shot with two of the other bar backs?
I said,
yeah,
there you go.

652
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:47.660
There's my hundred bucks through it.
Down we all,

653
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:51.260
we all took a sip and it was one of the great experiences I've ever had drinking

654
00:40:51.261 --> 00:40:54.500
anything in my fucking life.
So there you go.
Congratulations.

655
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:02.330
You know what?
That was classic right there.
Females,
female shit.
Well,

656
00:41:02.331 --> 00:41:05.570
you just said,
did you ever do it?
I gave you a fucking example,

657
00:41:05.571 --> 00:41:08.660
and then rather than saying like,
oh,
I stand corrected,
you then say,

658
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.990
I stand corrected.
You're right.
You went in,
you threw it down.

659
00:41:11.991 --> 00:41:14.600
You gave everybody a good time.
Yeah.
Great.

660
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:19.310
Do you think that's an isolated incident?
I don't know.
There was no,

661
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:22.980
it wasn't the amount of money that could be in our bank,

662
00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.460
the amount of money that could be in our bank account,

663
00:41:25.461 --> 00:41:29.300
but it isn't because I'm such a great fucking guy.
It's ridiculous.
Well,

664
00:41:29.301 --> 00:41:32.390
I'm glad everyone is getting to see what a great guy you are and they're not

665
00:41:32.391 --> 00:41:34.270
completely it on your,

666
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.640
this is what happens when you marry a smarty.
Even when you get them,

667
00:41:40.641 --> 00:41:42.750
they fucking wiggle their way out of it.
All right,

668
00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:50.130
let's get some questions before you go to your fucking Sally field meeting and

669
00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:55.620
you're going to go to a meeting this week and all that.

I believe you have a real market opportunity in Brazil.

676
00:42:22.491 --> 00:42:25.700
Have you ever considered coming here anyways?
Keep up the good work.

677
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:31.310
A car in La.

679
00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:39.650

680
00:42:39.651 --> 00:42:44.020
I mean I would go to Brazil.
Yeah,
I didn't say I was taking you.

681
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.610
There you go.
Now you go,

682
00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:54.980
You deserve it.
You,
you're so fucking,
you know,
abused in this country.

683
00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.850
You poor women.
I mean Jesus Christ and be all this stuff that we do to you.

684
00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:04.190
It's just got to,
it's got to be horrible living in your four bedroom,
garrison,

685
00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:08.240
colonials having the list.
How do you do it?
How about where Marty,

686
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:12.460
how are you American women's do it.
How do you fucking handle?
Well,
it's how you,

687
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:15.140
it's devastating.
It's not easy.

688
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:19.940
Bed Bath and beyond every fucking 20 feet bed bath and beyond and really

689
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:24.080
Nichey,
a buffalo wild wings,
you know it is.

690
00:43:24.081 --> 00:43:27.710
You guys love going in there buying shit.
I also like buffalo lab wings.

691
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:32.180
I know you do you like anything that costs money.
All

692
00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:38.600
car in La end of that question is just if you're going to come to Brazil,

693
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.900
they just look,
this is how it happens in here.
This is how it happens.

694
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:44.510
They say and then somebody else says,
yeah,
I've got,

695
00:43:44.511 --> 00:43:46.040
you know I've gone down there for one of the grand prixs.

696
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.370
Damn a grand Prix that and now what about carnival?

697
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.660
I'm not going to go down there watching everybody shaking their asses.
Oh really?

698
00:43:53.661 --> 00:43:56.510
Cause you would have just such a hard time watching a bunch of hot Brazilian

699
00:43:56.511 --> 00:44:00.380
women because exactly it again shaking their asses.
I would have a hard time.

700
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:04.880
I have a very hard time.
I'd be standing like Ron Burgundy,
my fucking slacks.

701
00:44:04.881 --> 00:44:07.710
Erection.
I don't want to do.
I would,

702
00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:14.090
oh fuck all right.
Car in La.

703
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.790
Hello Billy biceps.
No,

704
00:44:16.791 --> 00:44:20.840
I never got into that whole fucking thing going in some fucking,
you know,

705
00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:25.190
do go to Amsterdam.
You can walk into a physical fucking whore in the window.

706
00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.970
I don't think carnival is like that.
It's just,

707
00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.670
it's like everyone's like dancing and celebrating.
Yeah.

708
00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:32.310
Walking wrong with their asses hanging out.

709
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.460
It's not like going into the red light district in Amsterdam though.

710
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.350
As far as I can tell.
Brazil is like,
what?
What?
What's like your capital there?

711
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.560
Rio Is it though?
I have no idea.

712
00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.520
But from what I've heard from my friends,
it's one big red light districts,

713
00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:48.970
but I guess that's just where they weren't.

714
00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.620
Your friends were animals and they just went there for the,
we know what,
that's,

715
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:57.830
that's something different.
They weren't there to experience the culture,

716
00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:02.850
the legality that are afforded to women who aren't allowed to podcast before you

717
00:45:05.461 --> 00:45:08.600
got here.
Right.
Alright.
Billy biceps,
really,

718
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.870
really fucking grandmother hubs.
Now that I've kissed your ass a bit,

719
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.680
make sure you work on those triceps.
Those are the real beach muscles.

720
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:21.630
Like I go to the beach,
I got a question,
uh,
to throw your way.

721
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.950
Good Lord,
Dude.
That's what I figured,
you know,
get to it.

722
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.430
I had been working in the TV industry and I'm a [inaudible].

723
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.280
I have applied for a gig out there in la.

724
00:45:32.281 --> 00:45:35.490
It wouldn't mind hearing a rant about what it is like to live out there.

725
00:45:35.491 --> 00:45:37.140
I love biking everywhere.

726
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:42.620
The one with the pedals and everyone tells me that I move that if I move out

727
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:47.280
there,
I will need a car.
Ah,
bullshit.

728
00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:51.390
But for real,
what are your thoughts?
I like electric.
I liked electric cars.

729
00:45:51.391 --> 00:45:56.130
Is that practical?
Thanks for an average podcast at best.

730
00:45:56.131 --> 00:46:00.270
Go Fuck Yourself.
Oh,
Jesus.
All right.
Hang on a sec.

731
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:02.800
I can't blow my nose and the mic.

732
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:11.530
Oh yeah.
Got All of that one,
Carlos.
Um,
you know what,

733
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:15.840
Nia,
you think he can do better?
Huh?
You think you can find a better balding,

734
00:46:15.841 --> 00:46:18.640
fat freckled redhead.
You go out and you go through,

735
00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.810
I don't know why you keep saying that.
You know,
you fucking see this.

736
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:26.270
Look at that.
You look great.
You know something near,

737
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:31.110
you're not helping me.
Classic comedian and response.
No,
you're not helping me.

738
00:46:31.111 --> 00:46:32.340
I don't take a compliment.

739
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.570
Oh look random saying fuck right now to stay in the self loathing space.

740
00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.920
Bullshit.
If you don't look good,
I don't tell you.
You look good.
You know,

741
00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.610
if you noticed in 2009 I didn't say a fucking thing.

742
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:50.850
All right.
Uh,
yeah,
you can bike everywhere,
but it's a really dangerous,

743
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:54.430
there's a lot of frosted bicycles out here.
Um,

744
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:57.570
and now there's this weird thing where they just drew a bicycle in the middle of

745
00:46:57.571 --> 00:46:59.970
the street.
Um,

746
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.660
and all the people on bikes go see that's a bike lane.
It isn't.

747
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:07.580
What it is is you get money from the federal government if you just spray paint

748
00:47:07.581 --> 00:47:11.090
and bike on the street.
The,
yeah,
that's why they do it.

749
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.100
It doesn't really feel like it's always a proper lane.

750
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:17.190
It's just like a little section on to this,
not a lane.
They put it,

751
00:47:17.191 --> 00:47:21.120
they put it like a third of the way out into the road and then these people in

752
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:24.750
bicycles are like,
I have a right to be out there.
And it's like,
of course you do.

753
00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:25.441
Absolutely.

754
00:47:25.441 --> 00:47:29.010
But when there's a car behind you just get over to the right and let us get past

755
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.730
this.
Such fucking assholes.

756
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:34.150
They go out there and they dress like they're in a bike race and they won't get

757
00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:36.640
the fuck out of the way.
So don't be one of those guys.

758
00:47:36.641 --> 00:47:39.820
And then what happens is if they get hit,
it's a fucking tragedy.
It's like,
no,

759
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:42.160
you're a moron who's riding a bicycle.

760
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:44.710
Like I stopped riding a motorcycle out here.

761
00:47:44.711 --> 00:47:48.280
It was insane to be on a motorcycle and I'm going as fast as fucking cars.

762
00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:50.560
Now you're going to be out there on a bicycle,

763
00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:55.150
which is basically a motorcycle without a motor.
Yeah,
you're out of your mind.

764
00:47:55.151 --> 00:47:58.300
You can definitely bike out here.
People bike,
all the New York City.
You can.

765
00:47:58.301 --> 00:47:59.560
New York City is incredible.

766
00:47:59.561 --> 00:48:03.280
Maybe don't rely on in your biking to and from work and stuff.

767
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.610
And you come out here.
Now what you have to do is you,

768
00:48:05.611 --> 00:48:07.690
you gotta go down side streets.
You gotta,

769
00:48:07.691 --> 00:48:11.320
you gotta you gotta figure out a way to serpentine.
But I would not drive,

770
00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:15.520
go down sunset or Santa Monica or Melrose.
Beverley all the main ones.

771
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:20.440
Highland Labrea,
uh,
co Langa.
Uh,

772
00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.450
Fairfax,
crescent heights,
La Cienega,
Doh,
Haney.

773
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:29.560
Tell him how wonderful it is to live out here.
Third Avenue,
Wilshire,

774
00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:36.190
third street.
Third Street.
There you go.
Not that I'm talking about Santa Monica,

775
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.780
Third Street.
Those avenues out there.
Third Street,

776
00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.360
like third street promenade.
They're super relevant.
Yeah.

777
00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:48.370
Not the third avenue down the way here.
It's 30 to happen.
Okay.
It isn't,

778
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.840
I don't know,
just talk to them about how great this love out here.
That's great.

779
00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:52.000
Uh,

780
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
we're running on a water baby seals washing up onto the shore because the oceans

781
00:48:57.881 --> 00:49:02.140
are fished out.
It did kind of rain today.
I think maybe it got real cloudy,

782
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:03.571
overcast.

783
00:49:03.571 --> 00:49:08.571
It's very overcast and see that's really a half or an ex machina today.

784
00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:13.840
What is that?
The movie that I want the robot movie about the robot?
Yeah.

785
00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:19.360
That mad or Mad Max.
One or the other or both?
Both movies.
Starring women.

786
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:21.460
God knows you guys will complain as so,
yeah.

787
00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:24.550
But the trailer when he had a penis to be bigger,

788
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:32.260
um,
I'd just like breaking your fucking balls because everybody just sits there

789
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:35.650
going,
oh my God.
Everything you say is still valid.

790
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.540
Did you talk to them about the electric car?
Cause I know you've been wearing it.

791
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:43.240
Getting Electric car,
a Tesla.
So expensive though.
No.

792
00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:48.430
Um,
I don't know.
We uh,
super expensive.

793
00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:53.340
No.
Um,
well there's two tests was as like the,
the,

794
00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:58.350
the s type that has a one electric motor and that's uh,

795
00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:02.080
moves the rear wheels like the old days.
And now they have the new one,

796
00:50:02.081 --> 00:50:04.240
I forget what it's called,
but that has two motors,

797
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:09.100
one for the front and one for the back of what's amazing about electric power

798
00:50:09.101 --> 00:50:13.160
from what I've,
I've been looking is that um,

799
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:17.930
the torque is instantaneous or however you say it,

800
00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:21.490
like 691 pounds of Torque at zero rpm.
Like immediately.

801
00:50:21.491 --> 00:50:23.860
I think that's why I can't have a transmission because it would rip the fucking

802
00:50:23.861 --> 00:50:27.260
gears right out of it.
But then I don't understand how it,
I don't,

803
00:50:27.261 --> 00:50:28.820
I've never seen the inner workings of it.

804
00:50:28.821 --> 00:50:33.200
So how does it turn the wheels and not fucking,
you know,

805
00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:35.420
rip those things to shreds on the website.

806
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:38.110
They have all these diagrams and videos and stuff that is,

807
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:40.400
oh I gotta I gotta look at it.
It's amazing.

808
00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:44.360
You can at this point you can drive across the country with the one that has two

809
00:50:44.361 --> 00:50:46.850
motors because you're going to drive it like a maniac.
Yeah.

810
00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:50.390
Get like 150 miles before you got to uh,

811
00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:53.330
you know,
recharge it and then the,

812
00:50:53.331 --> 00:50:57.220
the s when you get like 200 something or whatever,
but all I know is,
you know,

813
00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:00.110
the average person,
you know,
you're not going on a fucking road trip.

814
00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:03.200
I mean 150 miles for a lot of people,
it's like three,
four days of work.

815
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:04.400
You come home every day,

816
00:51:04.401 --> 00:51:08.570
you charge it like a cell phone and then you never have to go to a gas station

817
00:51:08.571 --> 00:51:13.220
again.
And right now the golden age of electric cars,
so the recharging is free.

818
00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:16.290
<v 3>But you know,
eventually that's not going to be frequent issue.
I have though,</v>

819
00:51:16.291 --> 00:51:17.520
when I was looking at the website,

820
00:51:17.521 --> 00:51:21.870
they have a map because you can put in your zip code and it'll tell you where

821
00:51:21.871 --> 00:51:23.400
all the charging stations are.

822
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000
And like they're all at hotels and it's like they're for hotel guests only.

823
00:51:29.431 --> 00:51:33.730
Like there's one car you'll,
you'll have one at your house too.
Um,
right.

824
00:51:33.731 --> 00:51:34.860
Well that makes sense.
Yeah.

825
00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.680
Then she sees people down the street with their thing plugged in and they have

826
00:51:37.681 --> 00:51:40.440
them at the mall,
like all the malls and everything like that.

827
00:51:40.441 --> 00:51:44.040
They've got 'em everywhere.
So I don't think it's impractical.
No,
not at all.

828
00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:49.620
<v 1>Lee.
They're popping up like a multiplying.
Um,
but uh,</v>

829
00:51:49.621 --> 00:51:51.600
everybody I know that has one.

830
00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.870
Everybody that doesn't have one is nervous about getting way.
Like,
oh my God,

831
00:51:54.871 --> 00:51:57.710
what if it just shuts off?
It I could have hung out at,

832
00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.350
but everybody know that it has one.
It says they fucking ear to ear grin.

833
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:06.000
<v 3>Who has one that,
you know,
I want to ride in one.
I want to see what it's like.</v>

834
00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:08.850
<v 1>A buddy of mine that plays drums has one.
Uh,</v>

835
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:11.830
another buddy of mine in comedian has one.
Okay.
Am I going to say what?

836
00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:14.920
I'll tell you afterwards,
but,
okay.
I've driven one in,
it was,

837
00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.830
I just drove the one that has the motor in the back was the fastest fucking car

838
00:52:17.831 --> 00:52:22.370
I ever drove.
It was sick.
You just step on it and it just ended the seat.

839
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.330
Hmm.
Flying.
It's amazing.
The only thing,

840
00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:29.410
the only thing I didn't like though is the center console.
Like on the dashboard,

841
00:52:29.411 --> 00:52:32.310
it's like this,
it's this huge,
yeah.
Supersize

842
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.310
<v 3>I pay,
it's very,
as,
I feel like it would be really distracting.</v>

843
00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:40.160
I would want to shade to pull down on it.
And it's like,
you can go online.

844
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.390
It's like,
but why do you,
why do you need to be doing that?

845
00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.160
I don't want to driving anything.

846
00:52:44.161 --> 00:52:47.980
You use it for like the radio and constantly sending you out.

847
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.270
Like you get in the car and then they'd like just beam you updates.
Yeah.
Update.

848
00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.590
That's distracting.
That's not,
no,
no,
no.
You get there and it's just updated,

849
00:52:55.591 --> 00:52:55.710
right.

850
00:52:55.710 --> 00:53:00.240
<v 1>Oh,
this is cool.
Oh,
okay.
Do you know they have a thing where the new,
uh,</v>

851
00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:03.580
you know,
while the new cars is suspension,
like the Corvettes and stuff,

852
00:53:03.581 --> 00:53:08.400
you can have like,
you know,
regular suspension,
sports,
suspension,
supersport,

853
00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.430
whatever.
Fuck you want to call it.

854
00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:13.870
They have sports suspension and then their next one is just called insane.

855
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:20.170
It's kind of stupid,
but I actually Kinda like it.
Okay.
Um,
all right.

856
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:24.340
What am I going here?
Jesus.
Did you watch any of the Cavaliers game?

857
00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.900
Do you know that?
I didn't.
Oh my God.

858
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.290
Everybody in the Cavaliers limping around like they're playing soccer,

859
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.930
making all these faces and shit.
I don't understand.

860
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:38.160
You barely step on a guy's toe and you see a mountain of a man just crumple to

861
00:53:38.161 --> 00:53:42.840
his knees and then he wins the game.
And then Lebron immediately is like,

862
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:46.230
oh,
I'll camera's on me,
let me crumpled down to the floor.

863
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:50.340
And then he said this shit where they go,
ah,
you know,
how was the game?
Whatever.

864
00:53:50.341 --> 00:53:53.610
He goes,
he's like,
well,
if I'm ready to be a leader of this team,

865
00:53:53.611 --> 00:53:55.920
even if I'm hurt,
I need to step up.
It's like a,

866
00:53:55.921 --> 00:54:00.921
you writing what they're supposed to be saying on sports center is really good

867
00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:02.460
at meeting.
He really isn't.

868
00:54:02.461 --> 00:54:05.820
That's how he got in trouble the first time I'm taking my talents to south
beach.

869
00:54:05.821 --> 00:54:09.320
But these kids today,
they all grew up on fucking,
yeah,

870
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:12.750
they all grew up on sports and so they speak in sound bites and then the fucking

871
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:16.110
the animals on sports centers just repeating them to back in the day.

872
00:54:16.111 --> 00:54:19.740
Nobody ever fucking said Shit like that.
Moses Malone,

873
00:54:19.741 --> 00:54:23.130
you fucking had 90 rebounds and 50 points out.
Well how'd you do that?

874
00:54:23.131 --> 00:54:26.460
And he's like,
I just goes to the rack.
That's it.

875
00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:34.290
Larry.
You guys lost by 20?
What happened?
Yeah,
we played like a bunch of sissies.

876
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:38.070
That was it.
I was joking about that with law.
Had,
if he said that today,

877
00:54:38.071 --> 00:54:43.071
he'd have to fucking go to a stop calling people sissies.net and apologize to,

878
00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:48.110
what is your comments on Larry Bird's hateful statements?
Um,

879
00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.750
all right,
so,
uh,
yeah,
I would get elected.

880
00:54:51.751 --> 00:54:54.450
There's a bunch of [inaudible] the Chevy Vault.
There's a bunch of things.

881
00:54:54.451 --> 00:54:56.640
If you want to get something like that.
Um,

882
00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:01.110
but I think you'll really get into cars out here cause you live in them.
Um,

883
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:04.570
speaking of which,
I get my truck back tomorrow.
So what was going on was the,
uh,

884
00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:06.780
there was a spring on the clutch that was touching the exhaust,

885
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.430
so that was the only problem.
Thank God.

886
00:55:08.431 --> 00:55:13.020
So there's nothing wrong with the or anything in the transmission.
All right.
Oh,

887
00:55:13.021 --> 00:55:16.260
I'm,
I might near if any point if you want to fucking walk out your asshole.

888
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:21.270
All right.
Baseball season bill,
is it me or is baseball in a Rut?

889
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:25.010
There's nothing exciting going on.
No great pitching performances.

890
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:29.010
No exceptional bats that you check out any sox games when you were back in

891
00:55:29.011 --> 00:55:32.220
Boston.
Um,
I can address all of that.

892
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:36.570
You probably came of age during the steroid era.
Um,
I'm actually loving it.

893
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:40.440
I think baseball is back to the way it should be.
I love that Casey born,

894
00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:43.410
it was a,
you don't like any sports.

895
00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:47.940
I feel like baseball is especially,
I dunno.

896
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.990
It just can be and it doesn't,
yeah,
it doesn't appeal to you.
I guess,

897
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:55.800
I don't know.
May is that lame though.
I mean as baseball really an amazing sport.

898
00:55:55.801 --> 00:55:59.460
I'm not giving it enough of a chance because I feel like basketball games,

899
00:55:59.461 --> 00:56:04.461
I like to go to hockey games maybe cause it's this constantly fast paced.

900
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:09.780
This balls and play action goals and play.
Yeah.
Okay.
Maybe that's it.

901
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.090
Yeah.
You got to settle into a,

902
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:15.420
you got to settle into baseball and once you understand a little more what's

903
00:56:15.421 --> 00:56:18.450
going on,
it's like cricket.
I thought crikey.
It was the dumbest thing I ever saw.

904
00:56:18.451 --> 00:56:19.890
And then when I started learning some of the rules,

905
00:56:19.891 --> 00:56:23.330
it's actually really kind of cool what happened if it's,
you know,

906
00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.650
some sports just aren't for you.
Like for the life of me,

907
00:56:25.651 --> 00:56:28.020
I sat down and after everything was done,

908
00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.120
but when you came home last night you like,

909
00:56:30.121 --> 00:56:32.670
why are you watching the rich kids of Beverly Hills?
Yeah.

910
00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.880
It was because the basketball was done,
the baseball was done in,

911
00:56:35.881 --> 00:56:40.200
the hockey was done and I put on some soccer or whatever,

912
00:56:40.201 --> 00:56:43.140
football and uh,
I tried watching it.

913
00:56:43.141 --> 00:56:47.430
Of course I put it on and there's some guy laying on the ground crying and

914
00:56:47.431 --> 00:56:49.170
everybody's sitting there and oh,
you know,

915
00:56:49.171 --> 00:56:52.440
flapping their arms around like the biggest tragedy just fucking happened.

916
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.900
And I just,
it just bores me to tears.
I love MMA.

917
00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:59.680
That's Mike my favorite sport at the moment.
Okay.
I liked that too.
All right.

918
00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:01.250
So whatever.
Okay.
Um,

919
00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:05.580
also I want to say that despite you getting shit for sticking up for Brady,

920
00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:09.480
you always really,
you're always really kind to most teams when they,

921
00:57:09.481 --> 00:57:12.120
when you congratulate teams that beat your teams.

922
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:14.490
I don't know why you get so much shit.

923
00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:19.520
Are you allowed to hate the Canadians in Alabama or whichever team it is down

924
00:57:19.801 --> 00:57:23.160
there?
You Trash?
Uh,
thanks for uh,
for the laughs.
Oh,

925
00:57:23.161 --> 00:57:24.780
I'm glad somebody fucking notice.

926
00:57:24.781 --> 00:57:28.110
Like I didn't trash the Canadians too much for fucking illusion.
How could I,

927
00:57:28.111 --> 00:57:31.890
we didn't even make the playoffs.
Um,
but uh,

928
00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:36.140
I got to tell you that Tom Brady suspension is a fucking tragedy.
Oh.

929
00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:38.820
And all the people that spoke up,
John Elway,
Google,
you know,

930
00:57:38.821 --> 00:57:42.780
you got to follow the rules.
Really,
John Elway.
Like when you get drafted,

931
00:57:42.781 --> 00:57:46.500
you fucking show up.
He didn't,
the guy gets drafted.
He goes,
oh,

932
00:57:46.501 --> 00:57:49.710
I'm not gonna play with the colts.
The colts suck.
Trade me,
John.

933
00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:53.670
That's not how it works.
Well,
fuck it.
Then I'm going to go play baseball.

934
00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:55.140
All right,
John.

935
00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:56.620
<v 2>Okay.</v>

936
00:57:56.620 --> 00:58:00.010
<v 1>That guy came in breaking fucking rules and he's going to turn around and say</v>

937
00:58:00.011 --> 00:58:04.540
that shit half got fuck all of these fucking people.
It's ridiculous.

938
00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:09.280
Fucking NFL doesn't even pay taxes for God.
Damn.
70 fucking years.

939
00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:10.880
<v 2>Okay.</v>

940
00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:14.990
<v 1>Your nonprofit.
Oh my God.
The fucking horse.
Shit.</v>

941
00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:15.943
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

942
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.390
<v 1>For Games near the guy dropped the,</v>

943
00:58:18.391 --> 00:58:22.310
punched a woman in a head get fucking two games until the video got out.

944
00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.170
They're like,
oh wait a minute.
We mean we don't tolerate that here.
All right.

945
00:58:25.171 --> 00:58:27.390
Worst pickup line m

946
00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:31.620
or smelled that one.
Yeah,
that one you respond to.
Right?

947
00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:37.020
Cause that involved the lady.
God,
you're selfish.
Uh,
worst pickup line ever.

948
00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:39.720
Bill heard you talking about bad pickup lines.

949
00:58:39.721 --> 00:58:41.790
Me and my friends do this all the time.

950
00:58:41.791 --> 00:58:44.970
One night we were trying to think of the worst pickup lines to open up with.

951
00:58:44.971 --> 00:58:48.240
To a girl with dude,
that's some of the funnest nights you have.
I have.

952
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:52.100
It's just saying the worst shit.
Just watching you guys for you guys.
Yeah.

953
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:53.640
It's not about you.

954
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:58.980
<v 3>No.
Why are you saying to say it to each other then listen,
Nia,</v>

955
00:58:58.981 --> 00:59:03.280
if you fucking told me not to involve us in your fucking dumb,
you're dumb.

956
00:59:03.281 --> 00:59:08.190
Or who to cool with the words [inaudible] ever low people areas like why don't

957
00:59:08.191 --> 00:59:12.030
you just do it for each other?
Why do you have to bring us into it?

958
00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:16.150
<v 1>Yeah.
If you did that,
something like that to guys with your lady friends there.</v>

959
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:19.500
I would think it was funny.
If you weigh out,
if you just start fucking with guys,

960
00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:22.900
it'd be funny.
I Dunno.
Maybe.

961
00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:26.800
Yeah,
I don't know.

962
00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:30.520
I have the name of that and tried to throw out lines to anybody in a bar and

963
00:59:30.521 --> 00:59:35.140
fucking 11 years,
so maybe I'm a little out rockness worst pickup line ever.

964
00:59:35.141 --> 00:59:37.690
All right.
Blah,
blah blah blah.
Sorry.
Yeah,
you want to leave on this one?

965
00:59:37.691 --> 00:59:39.850
Cause it's so fucking annoying.
All right.
What night

966
00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:42.750
<v 3>am already annoyed by the question?
I don't even know what it is.
But go on.</v>

967
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:47.030
<v 1>What night
we're trying.</v>

968
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:49.430
He said he sent us on a cell phone.

969
00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:51.550
We were trying to think of the worst pickup line.

970
00:59:51.551 --> 00:59:54.140
So put up to a girl and trying to be as creepy as possible.

971
00:59:54.141 --> 00:59:58.280
Stumbled onto approaching a girl and opening up with the line of,

972
00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.100
so how old were you when you got your period?

973
01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:03.620
Oh Jesus Christ.

974
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:10.010
Why you sound like a fucking pedophile.
You know why?

975
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:13.890
So how old were you when you got your period?
What?

976
01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.720
I can explain it in one or two word.
Explain it to words.

977
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.980
Appointment short jackets.
Now apocalypse now is a horror.

978
01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:29.360
<v 3>What is the,
what does this do?
What does the rest of this jackass?</v>

979
01:00:29.361 --> 01:00:33.590
So this is like,
this is like a 20 year,
I hope to God.
This is like a 20 year old.

980
01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:37.240
Should I try it for a second?
And not a man in his thirties that knows about it.

981
01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:37.730
I don't know

982
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:40.670
<v 1>this is,
but I love him because he's fucking annoying you all right.</v>

983
01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:44.930
This is as this did this as a goof with force different strange woman.

984
01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:50.020
Oh after I set it to a few of the girls I knew first as a joke of course and

985
01:00:50.331 --> 01:00:52.280
something surprising happened.

986
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:57.490
They started telling me about it unfazed by the creepy inquiry.

987
01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.890
It's almost like they've been waiting to talk about it.

988
01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:02.111
<v 3>Oh yeah.</v>

989
01:01:02.111 --> 01:01:06.640
We are just waiting forever to talk to some strange ass hole in a bar about the

990
01:01:06.641 --> 01:01:11.200
first time we got our period.
Are you fucking insane and who are you talking to?

991
01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:13.390
Drunk sorority bitches.
They don't count.

992
01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:15.340
<v 1>Sorry.
Okay,</v>

993
01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.100
here yelling at this man's just sharing his experience.
Sorry.
Ha Ha.
He says,

994
01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:26.080
yeah,
exactly.
I'm not saying you should actually use this as a pickup line,

995
01:01:26.081 --> 01:01:29.980
but I will say I really thought you were seriously suggesting this.
Oh,

996
01:01:29.981 --> 01:01:31.720
you got to go in here.
What?

997
01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:36.190
I will say that it opened up a long conversation with four different girls.

998
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:39.160
I didn't know and even became friends with one of them.

999
01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:40.960
I don't know what that means,

1000
01:01:40.961 --> 01:01:45.520
but it seems pretty surprising to me that they weren't completely creeped out.

1001
01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:49.270
I figured they'd be creeped out or leave or call the cops or something.

1002
01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:53.440
Anything but what actually happened?
A story qualifiers.

1003
01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:57.700
This line was delivered in a joking yet.
Interesting tone,
interested tone.

1004
01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:03.070
And these were some presumably trashy girls at one of the trashy is bars in

1005
01:02:03.071 --> 01:02:06.220
America,
uh,
parentheses from Indianapolis.

1006
01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:10.210
So don't try it on a girl at a bar at the plaza hotel.

1007
01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:13.690
This is more of a motel six bar Spooner,
Spooner.

1008
01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:18.950
<v 3>He basically what?
He had a bar like confirm my point,
which was like,
no,</v>

1009
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:21.850
he dead news as bad as you're saying this.
Do you know what he did?

1010
01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.970
He wrote though.
It'd be like,
oh my God.

1011
01:02:23.971 --> 01:02:28.971
Actually I was my cam [inaudible] and I that I was like so all,

1012
01:02:30.151 --> 01:02:33.000
and it's like I feel really bad about myself,

1013
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.740
but then like my mom that it's totally normal and it's like,

1014
01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.280
I can't believe you're even asking me this because most guys are just so grossed

1015
01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:45.090
out by it.
Can we make outlet?
Yeah.
Dummies.

1016
01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:51.210
Cause any grown woman.
All right.
Half a God damn fucking brand sell.

1017
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.120
Even if you were like,
oh,
so no,
but seriously,

1018
01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:58.590
when did you get your period would look at you like the fucking immature Jack

1019
01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:00.900
Jackass more than that you are and walk away from your ass.

1020
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:05.190
You know the fact that I'm even wasting my breath on answering this ridiculous

1021
01:03:05.191 --> 01:03:07.030
thing just goes to show you.

1022
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.520
I was told this guy was getting a little ahead of myself.

1023
01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.550
Just don't really have anywhere to go after that.

1024
01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.790
All this guy did was he went out and he had a little bit of fun.

1025
01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.500
Well isn't that just sweet boys being boys?
A little,

1026
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:25.920
a little rapscallion is it?
Oh get outta here.

1027
01:03:25.921 --> 01:03:28.830
You're scamp is it okay for us,
for boys to be boys?

1028
01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:33.150
Is it okay for us to do that?
So do you have a problem with that?
No.
No.

1029
01:03:33.151 --> 01:03:36.660
Not at all.
A problem.
When girls be girls,
what happens to you guys?

1030
01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.730
Something horrible that we need to understand.

1031
01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:43.110
Apparently men ask this one was the first time that we had our a period.

1032
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:48.600
Okay.
But let me ask you,

1033
01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.820
I just want to ask you guys a question I wanted to today.

1034
01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:57.210
So what did he learn in all of this?
Okay,
so fine.
All right,

1035
01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:00.360
I'll relax.
I relax.

1036
01:04:00.361 --> 01:04:04.140
He was just being silly and trying to be creepy and try to have a good time.

1037
01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:07.590
Fine.
But like,
so these women,
I'm sorry everybody there period.

1038
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:09.210
But what did they actually say?

1039
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:15.140
When did you actually learn anything about a woman's menstrual cycle?
Oh,

1040
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.540
will you shut up?
Like they're supposed to learn something.

1041
01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:22.830
He's just fucking around God.
He ain't even write it.
Write it in then.

1042
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.920
I'm just trying to understand the point because this is the point.

1043
01:04:25.921 --> 01:04:29.220
The point is is we go out and we have to try to fucking convince you guys to

1044
01:04:29.221 --> 01:04:30.031
have sex with us.

1045
01:04:30.031 --> 01:04:33.420
It's up to us to fucking come up with some sort of line and it's a fucking

1046
01:04:33.421 --> 01:04:34.140
terror of angel.

1047
01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:36.740
Would that his way of like trying to get somebody to have sex with him?

1048
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:38.270
Know what I'm saying is the,

1049
01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:42.210
when you fucking coming out and your voice is changing and it's up to you to

1050
01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:46.800
initiate the thing,
it can be,
for a lot of guys,
it's a very intimidating thing.

1051
01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:51.360
So to get to the point in basically not giving a fuck.

1052
01:04:51.361 --> 01:04:55.170
This is like a standup comic who's no longer afraid of the crowd and can handle

1053
01:04:55.171 --> 01:04:58.680
himself and actually can dig a little bit of a hole,
no pun intended,

1054
01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:02.580
and maybe still be in the fucking game.
All right.
That's all these still here?

1055
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.720
He's having a good fucking time.
Okay,
that's it.
Then he went into some shit,

1056
01:05:06.721 --> 01:05:09.030
a whole fucking thing,
and he's having fun.

1057
01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:13.440
Do you think he actually hooked up with these pigs?
Maybe he did.
Okay,

1058
01:05:13.441 --> 01:05:17.760
but if he did,
it's his dick in her fucking vagina,
so stay out of it.

1059
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:23.010
Golly.
Wow.
Steve,
what the fuck?
He just having a little bit of fun here.
No,

1060
01:05:23.011 --> 01:05:25.650
I listen.
He just made a lot of good points.
I know.

1061
01:05:25.651 --> 01:05:29.040
So you don't got to go all Edith Wharton every fucking time a guy puts a smile

1062
01:05:29.041 --> 01:05:32.280
on his face.
Who is this yours?
Bell.
Edith Wharton's.
That lady.

1063
01:05:32.281 --> 01:05:36.870
You made the flag and the Afghan in the late 18 hundreds Nah,
she was married.

1064
01:05:36.871 --> 01:05:40.260
She didn't like to be fucking married and we had to read the stupid ass fucking

1065
01:05:40.261 --> 01:05:43.210
book in college and you know what?
It's dog.

1066
01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:48.150
She was a feature act at best.
All right.

1067
01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:52.740
