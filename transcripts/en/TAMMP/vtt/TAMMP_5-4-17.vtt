1
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.650
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burns time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:06.930
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.040
checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.
How's,

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.300
oh Jesus.
Who knows what,
how anything is I,
um,

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.510
I flew today,
so I'm,
whenever I fly,
I'm a little bit scatterbrained,
you know,

6
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.920
I and the f 7:10 AM flight,
so I had to get up at like five 15,
you know,

7
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:31.080
the shows didn't end till like 1130 or whatever.

8
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.630
Couldn't get to sleep till like two.
So I'm like,

9
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:37.860
all I gotta do is just make sure I don't miss the alarm clock,
get up,

10
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:41.790
get to the airport,
stumbled through security and then not miss when they,

11
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:46.620
you know,
board the flight,
which I did.
So I get there and that's it,
you know,

12
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:51.450
at myself,
a little parfait,
you know,
at that guy's fucking restaurant,

13
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.350
he's on the chew,
the guy with the shaved head,

14
00:00:55.351 --> 00:01:00.150
I went to his place and uh,
whatever.

15
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.130
I just got the Bruneau low with the,
uh,

16
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.980
with the yogurt and some blueberries or some,
something like that.

17
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:05.700
Vaguely remembered.

18
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.660
So I get on the plane and all I want to do is just go to sleep.
All right?

19
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.500
So I go to go to sleep and all of a sudden this fucking guy,

20
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:18.360
we get up to cruising altitude and this guy stands up wide awake.

21
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.840
Like I sorta got six foot four dad jeans,

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.440
you know any of these awful shoes,

23
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.930
these shoes that you'd wear with a suit and you could tell he didn't want to

24
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.030
pack like a pair of like leisure shoes.

25
00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:35.031
So he just wore those with his fucking awful dad jeans and he is just talking

26
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:38.520
loud as shit,
like one aisle up.

27
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:40.350
Like I don't know where he walked up from,

28
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:42.170
but he was a couple rows back and he came up,

29
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:47.171
he just talking to the guy we had to a hotel around 10 30 and we get the Maytag.

30
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.910
I'll set up and after that we can maybe try to decide what we're going to deal

31
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.310
with the gay planets for after lunch,
you know?

32
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.670
Then I hit the other guy that goes [inaudible] can understand what he's saying.

33
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:58.110
Then the guy's like,
oh ha ha.

34
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.840
And I just wanted to like fucking Yuck.

35
00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:04.020
I was just fucking shoes with the two buckles on them.

36
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.530
Two buckles really like how crazy are you feet that you got to strap him into

37
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:12.450
that level?
You know what,
they have a mind of their own.
So he finally walks back.

38
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:14.640
He goes to,
yeah,
I wanted to fuck you when he left.

39
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.330
So I finally not off and I'm like sleeping deeply and all of a sudden I just

40
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:26.160
feel this pressure on my left arm and,

41
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.920
and I feel somebody shaking me and I wake up and the stewardess,

42
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.190
she's class both my arms.
No,
my arm with both her hands.

43
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.920
Like she's going to tell us that you know,

44
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.340
she getting the crash position or something.
I just look up at her.

45
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.840
I can't hear what the fuck she say and then I realized that my headphones on so

46
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:49.110
I just take the headphones off.
I was like,
what?
What?
What's,
what's the matter?

47
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:51.300
She goes teaching went breakfast today.

48
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

49
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.040
<v 1>I mean,
yeah,
some point not what</v>

50
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.360
<v 0>I'm sleeping.
I didn't think they did that.
I thought you only time they did.</v>

51
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:08.470
That was when,
you know,
if there was like an emergency,
like I'm sorry,

52
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.290
I know you're sleeping but you got to bring your seat back up cause God knows,

53
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:11.531
you know,

54
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:16.300
that's so fucking crucial to the level of injury you're going to have at 37,000

55
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:19.120
feet.
Right.
I know it's kind of hacky material,
but that's what you think.
Right.

56
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.050
She woke me up to see if I want a breakfast and I was just saying I hope I

57
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:24.460
wasn't an asshole.
I was like,
no,

58
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.890
<v 1>we're going to get a hat that says I had a fucking par faith.</v>

59
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.200
Just let this old bed sleep.
So,
um,

60
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.520
I dunno,
I just,
then I couldn't get back to sleep.

61
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:44.521
So I started watching this season of the ultimate fighter and uh,

62
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.270
I don't,
I mean I know I've seen most of the seasons.
I forgot about this guy.

63
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:53.910
There was this guy,
oh the fuck was his name.
I can't remember what,

64
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:58.000
but he just keeps like inline to win the thing and he got completely hammered,

65
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.690
kicked out the windows on a limo.
He just went crazy.
And,
uh,

66
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.710
he got kicked off the show and completely,

67
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.030
I guess blue is shot at being an in the UFC.
So,

68
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.630
but he didn't quit.
He just kept fighting.
He's had like 45 cents then.

69
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.730
So you've got this big buildup,

70
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.150
sort of the redemption house this year where it's people that you know were in

71
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:21.850
it before and maybe didn't win.
I think that that's what it was.
Like I said,

72
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:25.210
I was half asleep,
so I was watching his,
um,

73
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.940
I was watching his whole pre fight versus the French dude who,
uh,
you know,

74
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.270
it was good with the kicks and shit and I'm watching this stuff.

75
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.240
And what's weird is dick cut into the guy,
you know,

76
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:42.241
who got kicked off the show and one of his ears is sticking out so much further

77
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:46.810
than the other one.
Like,
and what kills me is the early part of the training.

78
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.740
It isn't,
so something happened to him during training.
Like what,

79
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.690
what the fuck happens to those guys ears.
I understand like all,
like the,

80
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:59.200
uh,
the fluid in them and stuff.
But this thing was just like,

81
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.100
I mean I can't,
it was like Mickey mouse ear.

82
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.780
He had like one of those sticking straight out,

83
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.500
like it was signaling to make a left.
And the other one,
you know,

84
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:12.940
sticks out a little bit but not that far.

85
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:16.840
And they never address like what happened?
He says some core,
one point he said,

86
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:18.700
yeah,
you know what?
He goes,
I've been around the world.

87
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.880
I got the scars to prove it and I'm going to go in there and I'm just gonna beat

88
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:23.860
this guy down.
And that's exactly what he did.

89
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.860
And I was one of the few times I was excited that the mic,

90
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.880
the gate wasn't ready when we landed.
That's always a big jerk off.
You know,

91
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:35.230
when you get in early to the airport,
congratulations.
We're in 15 minutes early.

92
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.920
Unfortunately our gate is not available.

93
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.740
Of course it isn't because they weren't anticipating as being there.

94
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:44.200
And then there's no place to go.
You know,

95
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.440
they should have like a little fucking ice cream thing down at the end of the

96
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:49.750
runway,
you know,
you peel off onto a little taxiway.

97
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

98
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.990
<v 1>We're just gets a little fucking Sunday or some shit.
We just basically,</v>

99
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.990
the guy said,
these going up,
they're going to bring us to a,
uh,

100
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.410
I believe he said desolate part of the airport.

101
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.130
I know lax well enough at this point.
What they did,
they just,

102
00:06:08.131 --> 00:06:12.600
we just did a lap around the whole thing.
We landed on the,
uh,

103
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.490
what I the fuck it is the south side of the fucking airport.

104
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

105
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.080
<v 1>And we just landed cause that's a side United design,
which by the way,</v>

106
00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:25.290
I'd like to apologize to the guy who got dragged off that fucking flight.

107
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.610
The fact that I ever flew that airline again,
I already had my ticket.

108
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.700
I wasn't even paying attention.
I felt like such a fucking,
you know,

109
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.730
it's a fellow American,
they dragged off and even,
you know what,

110
00:06:35.731 --> 00:06:38.250
even if he wasn't from here,
cause I don't know where the fuck he was from.

111
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.850
I think they assume it's going to China or some shit.
Just human being,

112
00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:46.770
the human being,
you know.
Um,
I just felt dirty riding on that fucking airline.

113
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.810
Uh,
so that,
that's,
I think that's it with those guys,
you know,

114
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.420
and let somebody else does something worse than,

115
00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:56.730
than we actually all realize that United was actually,
oh,
you know,

116
00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:57.810
they were actually kind of reserve.

117
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.470
We smashed his cheekbone off the side of the day.

118
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.660
I just can't believe that can make you get leave.
Like,
no,
I'm not leaving.

119
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.070
I'm not leaving.
Is the president getting on board then I'm not leaving.

120
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.620
Plus nowadays the president has his own fucking plane.
Did you just kill me?

121
00:07:13.621 --> 00:07:16.780
It's like,
what about that guy?
What about his plans?
What about his business?

122
00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:18.850
What about his loved ones?
What about all of that shit?

123
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.470
Just fucking dragging the guy off as he's screaming.
That was one of the,

124
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.950
I don't know,
that was just,
it was just really,
yeah.

125
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.740
<v 0>Okay.</v>

126
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.150
<v 1>You know what kills me is,
you know,</v>

127
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.390
God damn well the head people at United Airlines,

128
00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:38.260
when they looked at that footage,
all they thought about was just damage control.

129
00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:40.150
They didn't give a fuck about that guy.

130
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:41.950
<v 0>Okay.</v>

131
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.990
<v 1>I Dunno.
Am I out of my mind?</v>

132
00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:47.920
That should not have happened in a first world country.
That was just like some,

133
00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:52.390
uh,
overthrow the government.
There's no rules anymore.

134
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:54.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

135
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.550
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
I mean,
they just fucking manhandled that guy.
Like he did something,</v>

136
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.500
you know what he did?
He paid for a seat.
That's what he did.

137
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.710
And he got on and he put his stuff in the overhead compartment.

138
00:08:07.711 --> 00:08:12.520
He sat down like he was supposed to and then he got his fucking ass kicked or we

139
00:08:12.521 --> 00:08:15.120
got roughed up.
That'd be more the,
you know,
it's two minutes for roughing.

140
00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:19.950
That's what you would get,
you know.
So,
um,
anyway,

141
00:08:19.951 --> 00:08:23.760
so I get back to the fucking lax,
I'm still a little groggy or whatever and uh,

142
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.930
I always take taxis,
you know,
cause nobody takes taxes out here,

143
00:08:27.931 --> 00:08:31.650
so they're always available.
I just walk right out in the guys there and a,

144
00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:33.570
I got a pet peeve on my luggage,
right?

145
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.910
Like whenever you walk up with the luggage,
you know,

146
00:08:35.911 --> 00:08:37.320
if the driver goes to take it,

147
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.950
what they do is they push the button in to make the handle go down about three

148
00:08:40.951 --> 00:08:44.150
quarters of the way.
And then,
then they just release it and then they,
you,

149
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.640
they just slammed the thing down.
So I always go,
just wait a second,

150
00:08:47.641 --> 00:08:50.910
wait a second.
Um,
let me just do it.
And the guy just kept grabbing for it.
I said,

151
00:08:50.911 --> 00:08:54.570
wait a second,
guys looking at me thinking I'm the deck.

152
00:08:54.571 --> 00:08:56.600
It's like I'm not the Dick.
All right,

153
00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.950
so once you fucking mess up the handle,
he,
once you mess up the fucking handle,

154
00:09:00.951 --> 00:09:04.070
now what am I going to do?
Carry it like it's the 1970s.

155
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.440
I travel like a stores.
So we get the whole thing down.

156
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.510
You gets in the car,
it goes,
how was your flight?
I say it was great.
And he goes,

157
00:09:14.511 --> 00:09:16.880
well,
you're going to tell him the address.
And he goes,
okay,
can you,

158
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.980
can you fucking type it into my phone?

159
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:21.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

160
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:25.540
<v 1>I Dunno.
Am I an asshole?
It's odd.
No,
I don't know why.
I want you to fucking,</v>

161
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.620
you can't fucking do you want to wake too?
Once you slide over,

162
00:09:29.621 --> 00:09:34.000
I'll fucking drive.
I know how to get home.
Um,
all right.

163
00:09:34.001 --> 00:09:38.500
Jesus Christ.
This is why I don't do the podcast one.
When I flew that day,

164
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.470
um,
as I mentioned,
yeah,

165
00:09:41.471 --> 00:09:45.790
cause I'm like extra crabby and I had a great time by the way out in Cleveland,

166
00:09:45.791 --> 00:09:50.170
Ohio.
Uh,
every time I come back there,
the downtown areas more alive.

167
00:09:50.171 --> 00:09:55.090
I remember working at his,
uh,
hilarides for the first time in 2004.

168
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.920
It was the end of 2003 I was doing new year's first time I met Jason Lie and a

169
00:09:59.921 --> 00:10:01.000
bunch of Cleveland guys.

170
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.010
And I just remember just looking at the downtown area and there wasn't shit down

171
00:10:06.011 --> 00:10:06.844
there.

172
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.240
I mean I was staying at the Holiday Inn Express right around the corner and they

173
00:10:12.431 --> 00:10:14.320
had to get me a fucking escort home.

174
00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.590
I was literally walking a block and a half and I was thankful that they gave it

175
00:10:17.591 --> 00:10:21.980
to me.
I did a fast paced walk over to the club before the shelf.

176
00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:25.540
So I remember looking across the street and it was this big apartment building.

177
00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:27.520
I remember just thinking like,
man,
if I had the fucking money,

178
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:29.460
<v 0>okay</v>

179
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.470
<v 1>I would buy that and Redo it and I would be,</v>

180
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.580
I would make a fortune on it and you know,
didn't have the money.

181
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.400
And now every time I go back they should see it now.
Like,

182
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.620
like Hilarides was the only game in town there on this dark street.

183
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.080
Now you show up.
It literally light.
Like I said this before,

184
00:10:46.081 --> 00:10:49.980
it looks like the fucking Bullwinkle show is a house of Blues.

185
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.660
This is place called a,
I dunno,
some craft beer places.
All of this shit.

186
00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:00.060
This gift shop t shirts store where they have all these stupid Cleveland stuff

187
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.420
they look like they was soft t shirts.

188
00:11:03.421 --> 00:11:05.820
I liked a lot of them and I actually like Ohio,

189
00:11:05.821 --> 00:11:10.821
but like the nickname for Cleveland calling it the land is just,

190
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:15.660
it's so bad.
The Land Pittsburgh,

191
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:20.060
the Berg
is Cincinnati,
the natty,

192
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:24.830
it's so fucking terrific.
I thought Beantown was bad.

193
00:11:24.831 --> 00:11:29.270
I always hated that growing up in Boston and the millennials started calling it

194
00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:30.104
the bean.

195
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.350
So in Cleveland they have these fucking tee shirts.

196
00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:41.351
It says defend the land from what you seceding from the union.

197
00:11:42.951 --> 00:11:46.310
What are you talking about?
Oh,
I was happy for him.
You know,

198
00:11:46.311 --> 00:11:48.650
they won that championship and all that type of shit,
you know,

199
00:11:48.651 --> 00:11:50.240
and they're looking good.
Jesus Christ.

200
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:54.950
Absolutely fucking destroying the Toronto Raptors.

201
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

202
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.660
<v 1>Yeah.
I was going to say,
had a theory about the,
uh,
you know,</v>

203
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:04.120
if you name your team after some fucking movie shit,

204
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:08.230
like the Anaheim mighty ducks,
the raptors,
we all know that's from Jurassic Park.

205
00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:12.310
Like you're never going to win a championship,
but God damn ducks did.

206
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:14.260
But they had to stop being the mighty ducks.

207
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.450
I remember when they first came out,

208
00:12:17.451 --> 00:12:20.900
they were the mighty ducks say the exact same uniforms as those little kids,

209
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.120
which is basically the bad news bears on ice.

210
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.550
And then they would up on the diamond vision,

211
00:12:25.551 --> 00:12:29.450
they would have like Emilio Estevez clip from the movie of him,

212
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.330
given a Rah Rah speech to a bunch of children.

213
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.740
And I'll tell you when they actually want a cop after that shit.

214
00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.290
That really hurt me as a Bruins fan going like,

215
00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:43.100
did we lose to a fucking team named after a kid movie?

216
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.170
I Dunno.
So anyways,
statement kicking the shit out of them.

217
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.200
How about the Celtics Celtics continuing to fucking move through the playoffs?

218
00:12:52.851 --> 00:12:57.110
Up Two games to none against the west.
Come on.

219
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.910
Ease on down the road.
I can't believe it.

220
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.340
The Boston Celtics brand of basketball,
other than their refusal to quit,

221
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:12.020
I cannot fucking believe that we're winning.
We don't get any rebounds.

222
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.270
Was soft in the fucking paint.
We live and die by the three.
I mean,

223
00:13:17.271 --> 00:13:19.430
that would tap right there that you would say it was just the death.

224
00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:22.460
He and somehow,
you know,
I never going to run today.
You know,
if,

225
00:13:22.461 --> 00:13:24.620
if we get by the wizard,
you never know what the fucking happened.

226
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.850
But when we run into that Cleveland Cavalier buzzsaw saw,
that's,

227
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.870
that's just going to be it.
It's going to be,

228
00:13:29.871 --> 00:13:32.840
and we were not going to have enough fucking answers.
Uh,

229
00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:35.750
Kelly Olynyk trying to cover fucking

230
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:42.500
Bron James or Al Horford.
What's he gonna do?
He's not going to fucking,
you know.

231
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.870
Um,
anyways,
I,
I mentioned a couple podcasts ago that,
uh,

232
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.530
my wife had gone rogue when it came to the DVR and all that night promise that

233
00:13:51.531 --> 00:13:55.630
she over talked to her about it with you guys.
I'm a,

234
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:56.600
I made a

235
00:13:58.950 --> 00:13:59.700
<v 0>okay.</v>

236
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.700
<v 1>Your Po request on the,
uh,
the podcast,</v>

237
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.610
your request,
you know,
your,
your,

238
00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:08.850
your presence is requested to is why I don't do podcasts.

239
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.750
I hate donut when I fly.
Um,

240
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.990
yeah,
but you got a mic.
You got everything.

241
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.630
There you go.
All right.

242
00:14:21.631 --> 00:14:23.980
Now we're going to have to have a nice measured conversation.

243
00:14:23.981 --> 00:14:25.800
It don't touch my luggage.

244
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.710
You don't have it like comfortable for guests right now.
Well,

245
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.020
that's why I never have guests.

246
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.043
<v 0>Hold on.</v>

247
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:39.430
<v 1>All right.
She's got to do the whole thing here.
Oh,
who's this other person?</v>

248
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.170
She wasn't,
she wasn't booked.
What's up baby?

249
00:14:44.171 --> 00:14:47.580
How are you?
Hey,
let's,

250
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.120
let's keep the spirit to get her situated and she's fine.
She's,
she's changed.

251
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.610
MMM hmm.

252
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:59.250
<v 2>Anyways,
near.
Yes.
You've gone wrong.
Here we go.</v>

253
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.270
You're gone rogue.
First of all,
welcome on the 10th anniversary.

254
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.370
Happy Anniversary.
Yeah,

255
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.610
that's an incredible is 10 years of running my,
yeah,

256
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.750
no idea where this was going to go and now look at me all these years later.

257
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:19.700
I remember sitting in my jeans and t shirt.
Yeah,
exactly like I was 10 years ago.

258
00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:23.240
I had the exact same level of technology.
I don't have a theme song.

259
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.380
I haven't done anything.
Although you didn't have a soundboard and stuff before.

260
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:31.490
You just used to like,
oh yeah,
five phone.
Yeah.
You use the car on the phone.

261
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.970
How did that work you?
You called up some service.

262
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.730
I used to do it when I was on the phone.

263
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:40.610
I would drive around and I'd be getting the arguments with other people in the

264
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:45.090
cars and I would be at the airport and I just make fun of fun of people were
gay.

265
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.390
What gave you the idea to do a podcast?
I mean,

266
00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:50.480
obviously it was became a big thing 10 years ago,

267
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:53.480
but was there somebody or something that happened that made you think like,

268
00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:57.890
I need to get it on this?
You know,
I feel like I didn't choose podcasting.

269
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.660
Podcasting chose me.
No,

270
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:07.310
it was over a Bobby Kelly's apartment.
Bobby Bobby's right.

271
00:16:07.311 --> 00:16:09.920
I was over there and he was like,
dude,
you should do a podcast.

272
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:11.420
So he just set the thing up.

273
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:13.583
<v 1>Yeah.
It was like</v>

274
00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.150
<v 2>Bobby Kelly Shit,</v>

275
00:16:15.151 --> 00:16:18.510
Bobby in the technology and I was like that and maybe in the old crabby guy.

276
00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:20.560
Even back then go and do it.
I don't want to do that stuff.
Just show,

277
00:16:20.561 --> 00:16:25.260
just say up Gig to go where you connect with defense bro.
And he was right.

278
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.830
Yes he was.
He was right on that one in the park.

279
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.640
How you know what he was wrong about your Bobby Kelly was wrong about the mini

280
00:16:32.641 --> 00:16:36.240
cds.
Many cds.
Cds.
Yeah.

281
00:16:36.241 --> 00:16:41.190
When they was regular sized cds.
He taught me how to get away he mini CD.
Oh,

282
00:16:41.191 --> 00:16:44.420
I'm quarter though.
Like that was going to take off and,

283
00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:47.520
and then I had to buy the microphone.
That was sad and set up like a little tea.

284
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.100
Oh,
I followed him for like two months.

285
00:16:50.101 --> 00:16:55.101
I followed him down over the cliff of a buying every piece of technology and

286
00:16:55.531 --> 00:16:59.940
then I just went back to the fucking,
the way I was.
So anyways,
yes.

287
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.770
So now what's going on?
You know,

288
00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:04.560
there's all these great shows out there that we used to watch together.

289
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.160
Well better call Saul.
Yeah.
Fargo,

290
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:13.090
meet me at the mall.
Good seasons Fr.
Right.
All of these great shows.
Yeah.

291
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.620
And used to watch him with me and now all of a sudden,

292
00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:21.120
not only do not watch them with me,
you kind of erase them or decide,
you know,

293
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.360
it was some other show not to show.
As I just mentioned,

294
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.200
there was some other show we started to watch and you decided that you were over

295
00:17:28.201 --> 00:17:30.750
it and you just,
you just stopped recording it.

296
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.410
<v 1>Okay.
Well,
you know,</v>

297
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:39.590
<v 2>probably because there's a way to watch it on like the Roku or on demand for me.</v>

298
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.500
I can't figure that out.
I have showed you that countless times.

299
00:17:43.501 --> 00:17:46.290
I know show you again,
but I'm not going to keep,

300
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.590
I like to say how many times I told you how to shut the water when there's a

301
00:17:49.591 --> 00:17:53.250
flood in the house.
There's certain things that were good at,

302
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.280
Huh?
Oh you didn't like that.
Did you know my eye contact?

303
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.710
<v 0>Okay.</v>

304
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:04.970
<v 2>Really Nia nay.</v>

305
00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.910
What?
What didn't you like about that comment?

306
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.190
Oh,
this is getting real.
This is like fucking some Wendy Williams shit right now.

307
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.270
You stop staring at me like you're going to beat the crap on here to talk about

308
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.730
the Dvr and the TV show stuff.

309
00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.800
We were throwing that at other evidence out as of my agent told me,

310
00:18:29.801 --> 00:18:30.730
is that what you're doing here?

311
00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.940
I thought that was totally new to like flip the script is not,

312
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.600
that's not what I agreed to once I'm white.
People do not flip the script.

313
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:42.700
We have a misdirection.
We changed the subject.
I,
yeah,
I didn't,

314
00:18:42.701 --> 00:18:44.270
I didn't agree to this.
I'm,

315
00:18:44.271 --> 00:18:49.271
I'm here to talk about television and just don't like Billy Bob Thornton on that

316
00:18:49.301 --> 00:18:51.700
radio show.
And he said,
don't bring up my movie career.

317
00:18:51.701 --> 00:18:53.170
Just talking about my drum Korea.

318
00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.550
It's going on with you.

319
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:04.190
I will you you changed or not changed?

320
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:05.850
I've changed change.
Well first of all,

321
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.850
one of the thing it hasn't changed is your inability to talk into a microphone.

322
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:13.410
Oh sorry.
I love it.
Just pointed at the side of your face.

323
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.660
I'm just saying now that we got the little one here.
Yes.

324
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.700
Well here's the thing bill,

325
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:25.701
is that you're running around all day and so I'm here with her and so I watch

326
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.910
the shows then because it's like there's not really much to do.
You know,

327
00:19:29.911 --> 00:19:31.500
I'm just kind of breastfeeding all day.

328
00:19:31.501 --> 00:19:33.630
There's not a whole heck of a lot to do with her.

329
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:39.620
So I watch it and because you're busy and then at night when we do get time to

330
00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:43.740
watch stuff,
you watch it for like 10 minutes and then you fall asleep.

331
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:47.970
Cause cause I could never in the morning time I understand that,
but I don't.

332
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.740
So then I don't get a chance to really learn enough.
Fair enough to get a,

333
00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.330
what do you got to race it then you got to make the decisions on like when I get

334
00:19:54.331 --> 00:19:56.440
to watch now like well that's it for you.

335
00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:01.280
He you fuck if you turn on your Roku thing and download the news.

336
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.800
So simple like my mom does the Roco like it's that.
It's that easy.

337
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.420
Sounds turning on and off a faucet outside the house.
Eric.

338
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.680
Well this has been fun.

339
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:11.203
<v 0>Okay,</v>

340
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.870
<v 2>I'm listening.
You're not leaving.
No one's ever walked off this show.</v>

341
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:23.140
You want up this job?
Who are you letting him?
What are you doing right now?

342
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.260
You keep belittling me of how easy it is when you use Roku.

343
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.420
How was that belittling?
I said it's easy.

344
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.590
You're the one who doesn't have the pain.
No,
no,
no.
You said,
what did I say?

345
00:20:34.591 --> 00:20:38.920
You said you even your mother can do it.
It's sell to me a little bit.
Little bit.

346
00:20:38.921 --> 00:20:41.570
You'd sell to me a little bit.
Why is my mother some ads?

347
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.860
I'm just saying she's not the best at technology.
Yeah,

348
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.980
but she knows how to use them.
Know what you're saying?
It's easy what I'm saying.

349
00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.760
Alright.
You know,
I thought there was gonna be a lot of comedy in this

350
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.130
woefully misjudge

351
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:04.390
how this was going to go.
No,
I know I went rogue.
I know I did,
but let's like,

352
00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:06.120
you know,
here we go.
Four minutes in.
All right.

353
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.100
I mean I just can't sit around waiting for you to like watch the 10 man.

354
00:21:10.101 --> 00:21:15.100
I got tired of watching episodes in 10 minute increments because you fall asleep

355
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.150
and what am I supposed to do?
I'm not doing it yet.
I'm not tired yet,

356
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.340
so I want to finish watching the show.

357
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.130
I got to turn it off just because you fall asleep and it takes like,
you know,

358
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.760
six weeks to get through two episodes.
That's insane.

359
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.550
I think you're exaggerating a little bit.
I am,

360
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:35.610
but the point is that I'm not going to wait for your ass to watch shows anymore.

361
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.610
It's just we're not on the same schedule,
so it's doesn't,

362
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.900
it's not really practical for us to like watch TV together like that.
Okay.

363
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.510
So that part of her relationships is,
it's over.

364
00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.760
All right.
Well here's the thing.
Yes.

365
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:56.380
Stop deciding,
you know,
being judged,

366
00:21:56.381 --> 00:22:00.030
jury and execution on the death penalty for the shows that we record.
Uh Huh.

367
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.170
Okay.
Okay.
You know what's weird is,

368
00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:05.520
you know I had all my self to games and Bruins games.
Games are,
no,

369
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:10.210
I did not like three times.
I didn't finish the accusation.

370
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:15.520
I know three times this season I had to go back and get to start.
You know,

371
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:18.670
I had season record,
I had three times they had to go back and do it.

372
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:21.800
And somehow that never seems to happen to your shows only to my show.

373
00:22:21.801 --> 00:22:26.040
So I can only surmise that the,

374
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:30.790
the Dvr doesn't like me.
I did not.
No eye contact.

375
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.450
I'll look right at you.
I didn't,
I didn't change them.

376
00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:36.700
Recording serious for your sports stuff.

377
00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.760
And I'd never been in the middle of recording two things that you like at the

378
00:22:39.761 --> 00:22:41.740
same time.
And it says all this is not enough space.

379
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.250
You need to stop recording on one thing and you never chose my stuff over your

380
00:22:45.251 --> 00:22:49.510
stuff.
No,
because it can record up to five things simultaneously.
All right.

381
00:22:49.511 --> 00:22:51.850
You're recording five things and then there's one more.

382
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.770
Have you gone through the Dvr list?

383
00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:58.360
Have you noted that like 98% of it is your stuff?
It's a complete lie.

384
00:22:58.361 --> 00:23:03.060
You just pay this,
but yes,
I do want to bet.
I'll bet.
Yeah,

385
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.940
I'll bet you what?
What do you want to bet?
I Dunno.
What should we bet?
Well,

386
00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:11.040
you're the one who brought it up.
Um,
no,
I brought it the bit.
Sorry.
I'm,

387
00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:15.190
I don't really know.
I don't know.
It's just make a gentleman's bet.
Okay.

388
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:20.980
Well,
you know,
if I was dealing with a gentleman,
oh,
I'm a gentle woman.

389
00:23:20.981 --> 00:23:21.551
How about that?

390
00:23:21.551 --> 00:23:26.200
I'm going to need the hospital lady race and my stuff.

391
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.150
I don't appreciate it.
Bill,

392
00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:32.950
you have got serious with thousands Patriot's games from three bowl from three

393
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:37.180
years ago.
It's a Superbowl.
We want it.
But do you go back and watch it ever?

394
00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:41.080
Why is it sitting there near?
That's one thing I know,

395
00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:44.980
but it's like four hours.
It's is super bowl and now beat the,

396
00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.670
okay,
but are you going to go back and watch it eventually.

397
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:54.880
Okay.
But everything else is gone the fast and loud to get rid of those.

398
00:23:54.881 --> 00:23:55.810
I've seen all of those.

399
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.900
I get rid of all my Bruins and Celtics and get rid of those.

400
00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.800
There's a bunch of games as much as sports related documentaries and stuff that

401
00:24:02.801 --> 00:24:06.850
you haven't watched because you don't have time to watch a lot of the TV,

402
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.081
which is fine.

403
00:24:08.081 --> 00:24:13.081
But I'm just saying that's the reason why I have decided to just press forward.

404
00:24:13.961 --> 00:24:17.740
Okay,
fair enough.
Well listen,
TV watching.
I wish you the best of luck.

405
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.430
Where are you kicking me out viewing?
No,
with your TV viewing.

406
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:28.040
I enjoyed watching TV with you.
Oh and uh,

407
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.730
yeah,
it's just an end.
So,
okay,

408
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:35.480
well then let's figure out a solution.
Like how can we get back on track?

409
00:24:35.481 --> 00:24:37.880
How can we get this proud of our relationship back on track?

410
00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:40.640
This is like therapy.
I don't know.
What can we do

411
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.400
in order to get on the same page?
Now look,

412
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.490
if you're bored out of your mind during the day and you need to watch a good

413
00:24:48.491 --> 00:24:52.420
show,
yeah,
by all means do it.
Whatever.
I just needed an explanation,
I guess.

414
00:24:52.421 --> 00:24:54.340
That's all right.
I'll learn how he tell you what.

415
00:24:54.341 --> 00:24:58.570
I'll learn how to use the Roku and you learn how to shut off the water the next

416
00:24:58.571 --> 00:25:00.220
time.
One of these old as pipe sparse.

417
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:04.343
<v 0>Okay.</v>

418
00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:08.140
<v 2>What?
Why is it such a big deal?
Why do you keep bringing it up</v>

419
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.590
and you're trying to like humiliate me and embarrass me.

420
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.510
It's why I'm bringing it up because every time you talk we had something happen

421
00:25:16.511 --> 00:25:17.230
like that.

422
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.950
I turned off the water I did and I called the plumber the naked and the very

423
00:25:20.951 --> 00:25:22.750
next day.
Yes I did.

424
00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:26.290
So I'm tired of you making it seem like I don't know what the hell is going on.

425
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:31.410
Okay.
I was here by myself.
I was,
well maybe.
Yes.
I turned it off onto the sink.

426
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.340
The sink.
You turned it off.

427
00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:39.370
Crazy ass flooding that was going on.
So I cleaned up by myself

428
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.390
all the times.
It's a little valve.
It's like it's blue.
It's the color of water.

429
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.960
I even told you out why cool.
Was that easy?
I could do it.

430
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:54.400
I forgot to do that part.
Okay.
I know,
but that's so,

431
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:58.630
and I called the plumber and they told me that it was fine and it was fine.

432
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.940
I know we cause we got lucky.

433
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:05.710
It sounds like you made a judgment call going.
You know it's coming from there.

434
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.840
I would take it out from the front of the house.
You didn't just take,

435
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.290
you didn't do it.
What I was going through.
You got in your face.

436
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.670
You do all you do whenever stuff like that happens when you're on the loan is

437
00:26:15.671 --> 00:26:16.570
giving me shit.
Have No,

438
00:26:16.571 --> 00:26:20.380
I will not give me shit about it over and over again instead of being like,

439
00:26:20.381 --> 00:26:24.070
I understand you were alone.
You were panicked.
You don't handle this situation.

440
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.640
Thank God everything was okay.
Thank God you're okay.
Thank God the baby's okay.

441
00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.680
Dam didn't break.

442
00:26:29.681 --> 00:26:33.940
It's all thing that I did wrong and how I didn't add the way you would have

443
00:26:33.941 --> 00:26:38.580
acted.
We learn here.
We learned here.
I don't appreciate it.
Okay.

444
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.710
I know
you know what?
Okay,

445
00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.920
you guys listening.
You want me to flip out?
Are you not entertained

446
00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.680
poking me and poking me about it?
That was months ago now.

447
00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.740
Like let it go.
You've completely lost your composure.

448
00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:01.390
Yeah cause you're pissing me off.
You know what I learned in this conversation?

449
00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.790
Nothing knowing you.

450
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.480
I have learned that I'm a little bit better at handling criticism then you are.

451
00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:15.180
No you are not.

452
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:21.350
Listen no you are the most sensitive jackass I've ever met in my end but I only

453
00:27:21.491 --> 00:27:26.020
took it.
Okay,
fair enough.
But I only took it to tit for tat.
You said Ro.
Cool.

454
00:27:26.021 --> 00:27:27.480
And so your petty too.
Okay.

455
00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:30.850
So I'm petty but I mean I'm not the one yelling and flipping out here.

456
00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.710
I am a passionate person and when I am feeling the euphemism,

457
00:27:35.711 --> 00:27:39.550
so that's on a euphemism is it is so many euphemisms.
It is.

458
00:27:39.551 --> 00:27:41.740
It's a nicer word for being a Douche,

459
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.250
sort of saying instead egg instead of saying yes,
I did.

460
00:27:49.251 --> 00:27:54.140
Just like,
you know,
um,
two rights don't make,

461
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.060
wait no two Ronson.
You're right.
No,
it's like,

462
00:27:59.061 --> 00:28:02.360
instead of saying shellshocked you see post traumatic stress disorder,

463
00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:07.930
<v 1>um,
instead of saying innocent people died,
you say collateral damage.</v>

464
00:28:07.931 --> 00:28:11.680
That's a euphemism.
Oh,
all right.
Okay.

465
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.210
<v 2>So there you go.
So that's saying that you're an angry lunatic.</v>

466
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.870
You say you're passionate,
you're the angry alluded to.

467
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.740
Can all agree it's not me.
I am not.
I am the steady easy one.

468
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:27.720
Oh yeah.
Really?
That crazy one.
You know what?
I had to threatened a Blake,

469
00:28:27.721 --> 00:28:29.820
if you hit me one more time during an argument,

470
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.030
I'm not going to go out with you anymore.
When I met you,

471
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.380
you were a grower and you were here.
Oh my God.
You do just have,

472
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.690
you got to run for office.
You've got an answer for everything.

473
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.750
I was of young and I was passionate.
You are a mature,

474
00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:47.520
young and immature and I didn't know how to handle my emotions and I do now.

475
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:49.840
<v 1>Okay.
All right.</v>

476
00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.670
<v 2>Why don't you just check yourself into Rehab.
The fee of the Tet tet,</v>

477
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:59.570
I punched him in the face.
I need to go to Rehab.
Punch you in the face.

478
00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:04.330
You did it on Valentine's Day.
She did?
Yes.

479
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.920
She did.
Not In the face and the
face.

480
00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:18.750
You did.
I didn't punch you in the face.
I know I took you that fancy.

481
00:29:18.751 --> 00:29:21.380
Yes.
Sushi restaurant.
We were living in New York.

482
00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.920
I took you down to that thing and the dude from the phone on

483
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:29.310
<v 1>both movie was there,
right?
Oh,
I'm in a phone booth.
They won't let me leave.</v>

484
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.090
Confound,
right.
He's in that fucking thing.
That Nice low budget movie.

485
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:37.410
The whole movie takes place in a phone booth.
We love it.
Low budget.

486
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:41.610
Cute Irish guy.
Right.
He has a ridiculous,
well,
you know,

487
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.740
we wouldn't know that when you low,

488
00:29:42.741 --> 00:29:44.390
you will looking at him and the Sushi restaurant,

489
00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.750
you just kept looking at the gay,
which was fine for the first,
you know,

490
00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.900
10 minutes and after awhile you just looking at another guy.
Wow,

491
00:29:50.901 --> 00:29:55.460
I'm paying 10 times what Sushi should cost was.
We went to sell exaggerating.

492
00:29:55.461 --> 00:30:00.050
What happened?
I wasn't staring at Collin Farrel the entire validate my feelings.

493
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.130
Yeah.

494
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:06.790
I believe there was a song written about everything you've said on this podcast

495
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.890
back in the 80s it went something like this

496
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:19.300
the better.
I believe that was the Thompson twins.

497
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.110
How long had we been dating before that incident?
I Dunno,

498
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:29.160
but what ended up happening was I got into the cab and I bonded with the cab

499
00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:31.720
driver and I just said to go bake buddy.
Let me ask you a question.

500
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.210
Stuck my big head too.
That's stupid little window I got you.

501
00:30:34.211 --> 00:30:38.710
Took your woman out on Valentine state for Sushi.
All right.
Famous gay walks in.

502
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.500
How long do you give her to look at the famous guy before?

503
00:30:41.501 --> 00:30:46.180
After a while and then public for that long.
Wow.
I never thought of it that way.

504
00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.360
What?
I mean farming it out.
I don't know what I mean.
I was young.
I had to,

505
00:30:50.361 --> 00:30:53.030
I had to get some sort of victory.
I was trying to marry the line.

506
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.990
I was trying to make you as upset as you made me.

507
00:30:56.090 --> 00:31:00.240
W and I did it a little too well because by the end of the night we were back in

508
00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:03.370
the apartment and you came running out of the bedroom because of course I'm

509
00:31:03.371 --> 00:31:05.620
sleeping on the couch.
Of course I'm sleeping on the couch.

510
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.890
I wasn't looking at anybody else and I paid for the move for the meal.

511
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:13.060
Of course I ended up on the couch.
And uh,

512
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.990
you said something like that as some bub bitching or something.
I said,
yeah,

513
00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:19.240
well you're acting like one and I never called you that word.

514
00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.850
And I'm sort of here just two little feet.

515
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.790
The floor was not the question.

516
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:28.930
That was not the word in question.
And you know it was a douchebag.

517
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:33.390
No it was not.
And you were saying waiting.
He's speaking to the microphone.

518
00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:35.500
You got to act like such a,
you know what?

519
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.570
And I lost white shit.
No I didn't.
No I didn't.
No,
I did.
This is what I said.

520
00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:45.740
What did I say?
I didn't say,
I would never say no cause that's calling you one,

521
00:31:45.741 --> 00:31:50.570
which I've never done.
Never did that.
Yeah,
you kind of did.

522
00:31:50.571 --> 00:31:53.510
And there one time.
No,
I didn't.
You know,

523
00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:55.940
you like to disguise it behind acting like a,

524
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:57.860
see this is a thing that I tell you something.

525
00:31:57.861 --> 00:31:59.940
Then can I tell you like tell you something.

526
00:31:59.941 --> 00:32:04.430
You acting like I didn't say you were a,
you're acting like a fair enough.

527
00:32:04.431 --> 00:32:07.040
But here's the thing that I've been with you for 14 years.

528
00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.820
You have two incidents despite your behavior.

529
00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.920
How many times you know what for those two incidents,

530
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:15.890
how many times did you hit me?
I'm the time you came in.

531
00:32:15.891 --> 00:32:17.900
You're through my laundry all over the living room.

532
00:32:17.901 --> 00:32:22.170
You have a weird freaking psycho.
Yeah,

533
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:26.240
I remember that once you're fluffy white socks and underwear,
like,
oh my God.

534
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.250
Another example of your passion.

535
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.530
I've shown unbelievable restraint dealing with a woman like you.

536
00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:42.080
Oh,
how a woman like me.
Yes.
Yes.
Well,

537
00:32:42.081 --> 00:32:46.020
congratulate fucking lesions.
You got a beautiful baby out of it.

538
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:51.950
<v 3>That's right.</v>

539
00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:56.620
<v 1>Oh,
we had a good time.
Yeah,
we had a nice run.</v>

540
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.190
Now it's all about her and evidently we're just going to be watching separate

541
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.200
stuff on TV.
No,
we can't be that couple.
We have to like,
you know,

542
00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.750
still remain a tight,

543
00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.780
I have to go see it most times I fall asleep at night because you're watching

544
00:33:10.781 --> 00:33:14.200
those,
those women yelling at each other.
I hate those shows.
No,
I know,

545
00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.220
I know that.

546
00:33:15.221 --> 00:33:17.920
But we could be watching anything and you'll fall asleep cause you do,

547
00:33:17.921 --> 00:33:21.550
you get up super early.
You're really busy throughout the day.
It makes sense.

548
00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:23.410
So I get why you fall asleep,

549
00:33:23.411 --> 00:33:26.360
but I'm just saying like it's hard to watch a TV show with you that way.
Okay.

550
00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:30.750
<v 0>That's it.
Okay.
All right.</v>

551
00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:35.680
<v 1>Listen,
it was nice talking to you.
Is that it?
Do I have to leave now?</v>

552
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:37.600
Well,
I mean I got to read some advertising.

553
00:33:37.601 --> 00:33:40.240
If you want to sit here and listen to that.
Oh Jesus.

554
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.310
I know some you read out loud.

555
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.480
Don't let her listen to that either because that'll leave hope she doesn't get

556
00:33:46.481 --> 00:33:50.050

while we are waiting [inaudible] we're actually gonna a little bit of music and

698
00:43:04.601 --> 00:43:07.300
then some of the greatest hits of,
um,

699
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.710
of a podcast gone by in the last 10 years old,
by the way.

700
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.830
Then when I told you to check out that band the night game,

701
00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.960
remember that while rumor has it,

702
00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.080
rumor has it that they're going to be opening for John Mayer.

703
00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:23.970
John Mayer has got a big tour,
um,

704
00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.550
going through the United States of America.
There's one stop in Toronto,

705
00:43:27.551 --> 00:43:29.070
the rest of them all.
Uh,

706
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:32.040
I imagine he'll go around the globe with that because it does say world tour.

707
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.800
So this is probably the first leg of it.
And I,
he's got two bands opening up.

708
00:43:35.801 --> 00:43:40.210
I forget the name of the other band,
but I believe the night game,

709
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:42.850
I don't know if that's official hope it's official opened up fucking everything

710
00:43:42.851 --> 00:43:46.090
up for anybody.
But uh,
that was a band I told you guys to check out.

711
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:50.290
Dave [inaudible],
the guy I take drum lessons from,
um,

712
00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.850
is in that band with a bunch of other amazing studio musicians,
songwriters.

713
00:43:54.851 --> 00:43:58.960
They sound amazing.
So if you do catch John Mayer this summer,

714
00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:02.500
don't show up late,
don't hang in the parking lot,

715
00:44:02.501 --> 00:44:05.680
shotgun beers or whatever the hell you kids do nowadays.

716
00:44:05.681 --> 00:44:09.070
Taking your Molly smoking your math right.

717
00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:14.080
Whatever the hell it is you kids do nowadays,
make sure you get in in time to,
um,

718
00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.550
to check out the night game.

719
00:44:15.551 --> 00:44:19.180
And I'm sure the other band is just as good because it doesn't seem like mayor

720
00:44:19.181 --> 00:44:22.270
brings any cupcakes on the road.
You know what I mean?
Like,
you know,

721
00:44:22.271 --> 00:44:23.530
sometimes comedians will do that.

722
00:44:23.531 --> 00:44:25.960
They'll take somebody on the road that is isn't,
it's funny.
You know what I mean?

723
00:44:25.961 --> 00:44:29.410
So they don't bring too much heat,
you know,
but the really funny guys,

724
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:33.420
they don't do that shit.
All right?
But not me.

725
00:44:33.421 --> 00:44:37.290
I bring cupcakes out on the road like Joe de Rosa,
the original cupcake.

726
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.440
He's seat Joe to Rosa is the cupcakes cupcake

727
00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.360
of standup comedy.
I miss that guy,
man.

728
00:44:45.361 --> 00:44:47.310
I got to have him back on the podcast at some point.
All right.

729
00:44:47.311 --> 00:44:50.130
Enjoy the music and the uh,
the greatest hits.
I'll talk to you on Monday,

730
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:58.700
<v 5>my fucking podcast
and Bobby Kelly set it up.</v>

731
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:02.690
Isn't this interesting?
Listen,

732
00:46:02.691 --> 00:46:05.210
I'm going to figure out how to do this thing and if it's already bored,

733
00:46:05.211 --> 00:46:08.480
you just hit the stop button while you're doing that.

734
00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.970
The click button down at the bottom of the bobcat side device days,

735
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.310
page at the bottom of five.
Okay.

736
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:20.000
The bottom at the bottom of my page,
right underneath,

737
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:28.430
right it.
Subscribe.
All right.
Underneath the podcast you can hit subscribe.

738
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:30.920
So then we'll go right to,
you have to,
anytime.
There's a new one.

739
00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:34.490
Anytime there's a new podcast and go right to you while you're at.

740
00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:38.840
If it did work,
that's what's going to happen.
That's going to help fill the void.

741
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:42.990
All right?
This is fucking horrific,
but you know,
this is a,

742
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:47.210
this is the beginning of something mediocre,
so I want you guys to tune it.

743
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:49.400
All right now what I do,
I hit,
I hit town.

744
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:50.463
<v 4>Okay.</v>

745
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:24.130
Okay.

746
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:36.930
[inaudible]

747
00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.593
<v 6>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

748
00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:52.380
It's bill burr and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

749
00:47:52.381 --> 00:47:54.660
May 4th,

750
00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:58.410
2009 and I think this is the 15th time I've tried to do this podcast.

751
00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:01.050
As you can tell,
my voice is a little bit tired.

752
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:06.250
I was just working Carolines in New York City and I did a six shows and I think

753
00:48:07.701 --> 00:48:11.210
I overdid it a little bit even though I was drinking tea.
You know,

754
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:15.100
start doing that.
Drinking tea with a little bit of honey in it for my shows.

755
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:20.410
Doing a little fucking vocal warmup,
you know,
I mean,
you know,

756
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:24.700
so I can save my instrument.
I now let's the gays fucking thing ever,
isn't it?

757
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:25.570
I don't give a fuck,

758
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:30.000
I have to do it or else I end up sounding like deaths when I,
when I,
when,

759
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:34.540
when I don't do it,
you know,
I dunno,

760
00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:36.980
it was a weird week in New York.
I didn't do anything.
I just,
I,

761
00:48:36.981 --> 00:48:41.890
I was holed up in my hotel like fucking Howard Hughes.
That's what I do.

762
00:48:41.891 --> 00:48:43.780
Like the further east I go,

763
00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:48.280
the more fucked up it is for me to get up in the morning to do a radio obviously

764
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:51.820
because if I have to get into radio station at 7:00 AM east coast time,

765
00:48:51.821 --> 00:48:56.260
that's 4:00 AM my time.
And uh,
that's how we ended up getting sick,

766
00:48:56.261 --> 00:48:57.340
burning it at both ends.

767
00:48:57.341 --> 00:49:02.020
So I started taking these vitamin C pills because they were freaking everybody

768
00:49:02.021 --> 00:49:06.970
out about the fucking swine flu,
which once again turned out to be nothing.

769
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:12.460
How many flus in a row I,
they're going to scare the shit out of us about,

770
00:49:12.461 --> 00:49:16.570
you know,
and your nose,
every flu.
It's like,
like how did it come about?

771
00:49:16.571 --> 00:49:18.790
It's always somebody had sex with an animal.

772
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.270
<v 7>Somebody in another country had sex with an animal,</v>

773
00:49:22.271 --> 00:49:25.900
which is so like nobody is fucking animals in this country.

774
00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:27.873
<v 6>You know,</v>

775
00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.590
<v 7>I think the CIA puts the shit out that just doing some experiments,</v>

776
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:34.450
they need to thin the fucking heard.

777
00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.750
So what they do is they just put the shit out and then they just blame

778
00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:40.720
foreigners and then they add beastiality intuit.

779
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.560
So then it just makes sense to Joe lunchbox.
You know,

780
00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:48.220
you can just see him sitting around the fucking canteen truck,
the Roach coach,

781
00:49:48.221 --> 00:49:50.020
whatever you call it,
in your neck of the woods.

782
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:55.240
And I adore the fucking swine flu,
you know?
Well,
we,
well,

783
00:49:55.310 --> 00:50:00.070
what's the slang food shop guy down in Mexico?
Jody fucking,
he fucked a pig.

784
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:04.340
He fucked the fucking pig.
You know,
we've got plenty of pigs in this country.

785
00:50:04.341 --> 00:50:09.130
You don't see anybody fucking him.
Let's fucking people in Mexico,
fucking pigs,

786
00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:12.810
dogs just like age,
those fucking some guy in Africa,
you know,
he,

787
00:50:12.811 --> 00:50:16.660
he fucks a monkey and he jerks off the stewardess.
And next thing you know,

788
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:20.410
I got to wear condoms.
It's fucking bullshit.
Dude,

789
00:50:20.411 --> 00:50:23.410
we should close the fucking board is um,

790
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:27.040
notice that was all done in a pseudo Boston accent.
And because that's,

791
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:30.080
I heard most of those conversations as I was growing up,
um,

792
00:50:30.081 --> 00:50:31.040
when I worked in a warehouse,

793
00:50:31.041 --> 00:50:34.460
and I've got to admit some of the Times I was the guy saying them as I went out

794
00:50:34.461 --> 00:50:38.720
and I got a sausage king for breakfast for my 10:30 AM break.

795
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:40.461
Remember that Shit.

796
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:43.610
You worked in the warehouse and you're just sitting there and it's a Monday and

797
00:50:43.611 --> 00:50:47.600
the days just in Monday's didn't crawl.
Tuesday's crawled Monday.

798
00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:51.650
You was so fucking bleary eyed from your weekend that the day in some weird way

799
00:50:51.651 --> 00:50:54.980
kind of went by quickly,
you know,
plus,
you know,

800
00:50:54.981 --> 00:50:56.540
you kind of excited to get back to work,

801
00:50:56.541 --> 00:50:58.310
whatever girl day you kind of got a crush on,

802
00:50:58.311 --> 00:50:59.750
you're trying to figure out how to Fucker,

803
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:02.840
you haven't seen her in a couple of days.
So he got that level of excitement,

804
00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:06.770
you know,
you got all that going on.
Maybe a big,

805
00:51:06.771 --> 00:51:08.810
your team won the big game the day before.

806
00:51:08.811 --> 00:51:11.750
Even if they did and you got something to talk about.
Some Monday goes by quick,

807
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:16.760
but then Tuesday,
Tuesday's when it hits you,
fuck,
I work here.

808
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:21.440
I hate this.
This is going to be the same shit all over again.

809
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:27.050
What the fuck am I doing with my life?
And then it just drags ass.

810
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.700
I don't know about you guys,
but back when I had a real job before I,

811
00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.260
I just did this bullshit.
Um,

812
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.920
I can't even begin to tell you how fucking long Tuesdays seemed,

813
00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:39.950
who was almost like the,
like the clock.

814
00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:45.140
It was like they had like a phony clock on the wall and every minute was

815
00:51:45.141 --> 00:51:49.310
actually two minutes,
you know,
I'm telling you it went by slow people.

816
00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:51.830
Why did I need to give that last example?
I don't know what,

817
00:51:51.831 --> 00:51:56.750
but all I know is what I must have looked at the clock like 85 times before 10

818
00:51:56.751 --> 00:52:00.860
15 when the roach coach would come in and it would blow his horn that,
you know,

819
00:52:00.861 --> 00:52:04.160
but that got that,
that,
but that could,
that day it didn't do that.

820
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.050
It was something else.
I can't remember.

821
00:52:06.051 --> 00:52:09.950
But it was one of those fucking fancy horns and everybody would just,
uh,

822
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.330
remember it was losing his shit.

823
00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:14.600
It was like the adult version and when the ice cream truck came down the street,

824
00:52:14.601 --> 00:52:18.410
remember that old Eddie Murphy bit,
the ice cream man is coming.
Same Shit,

825
00:52:18.411 --> 00:52:19.280
but for adults.

826
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:24.470
And then I would literally go out there and I would either get a slice of pizza

827
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.460
off of this truck.
For those of you always has had a white collar job,
you never,

828
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.450
you know those,
those canteen trucks,
right?
The silver,

829
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:32.360
it looks like a pickup truck in the front of the back.

830
00:52:32.361 --> 00:52:36.120
It's all silver and they lift up the side and there's all kinds of fucking,
uh,

831
00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.640
uh,
that's where the fucking swine flu comes from.
God Damn.

832
00:52:40.641 --> 00:52:43.400
It's probably those fucking trucks.
But anyways,

833
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:47.570
then I would go out there and I would literally get like a slice of pizza like

834
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:51.530
this.
I don't know who made it,
you know what I mean?
Where,

835
00:52:51.531 --> 00:52:54.650
where was it made you get that?

836
00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:58.490
Or I get like a sausage king at 10 30 in the morning,
10 15 in the morning.

837
00:52:58.491 --> 00:53:03.070
And I would just eat that thing after booze and all weekend probably downing it.

838
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:07.300
Every bit of 30 fucking beers.
All right?

839
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.000
Probably getting six hours sleep.
If I was lucky,

840
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:13.520
I had season tickets to the patriots.

841
00:53:13.521 --> 00:53:17.870
I abused my body on that day and then I would finish it off every day just

842
00:53:17.871 --> 00:53:22.040
eating a fucking sausage king or a slice of pizza.
Just something horrific.

843
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.010
And because I was young,
I had a middle,

844
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:30.510
<v 6>let me,
granted I was working out,
but I'm at the age now.
I would,</v>

845
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:34.890
I'd have to have,
be on a treadmill the entire fucking day.

846
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:39.600
That's just cruel.
So if you're in your 20s,
enjoy it,

847
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:44.610
enjoy it and develop some good fucking eating habits because,
uh,

848
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:50.850
those days don't last right.
Admitted old people don't.

849
00:53:50.851 --> 00:53:54.510
You walk into Mcdonald's sometimes and you and all fucking guilty and you just

850
00:53:54.511 --> 00:53:57.160
see some Douche bags.
I don't even Douche bags.

851
00:53:57.161 --> 00:53:59.520
You just mad because they're young and they're over there laughing,

852
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:04.800
having a great time.
Everybody's fucking in shape.
Chowing down,
you know,

853
00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:06.950
to make yourself feel better.
You looking over there going,

854
00:54:06.951 --> 00:54:10.560
there's four people over there.
You know what?
Statistically speaking,

855
00:54:10.561 --> 00:54:15.180
one of them's going to drop of a heart attack and I'm still living,
so fuck it.

856
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:20.730
It's not like I started my life at this age.
I'm doing all right.
Right?
Yeah.

857
00:54:20.731 --> 00:54:24.870
Let me get the number three with a root beer.
I'm sorry sir.

858
00:54:24.871 --> 00:54:28.020
We don't have root bear.
It's sprite.
Okay.

859
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:32.460
Is sprite even remotely like a root beer?
Huh?

860
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:37.200
You ditzy comment.
Why wouldn't you say coke least?
They're both Brown.

861
00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:42.060
All right,
sorry.
Um,
anyways,
this is the Monday morning podcast.

862
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:45.510
I do one of these every single week out of the goodness of my heart.

863
00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.180
All the horrific things I do all week long.

864
00:54:48.181 --> 00:54:53.181
I wash away all of them every Monday by doing this podcast for my listeners.

865
00:54:54.301 --> 00:54:58.050
That's what I do.
That's why I do it.
This is how I repent,

866
00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.410
considering I don't go to church anymore.
You know,

867
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:08.280
I haven't been to confession.
Confession.
How fucked up was that?

868
00:55:08.281 --> 00:55:12.240
You go in there and your rat yourself out to some other fucking Douche bag and

869
00:55:12.241 --> 00:55:15.420
he's acting like he's acting like,
oh,
you got,
you got to come to me.

870
00:55:15.421 --> 00:55:19.230
And then I'm going to tell God like God dins watch everything that I just did.

871
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:24.450
You know,
I could,
I could do that shit in my bedroom.
You know what I mean?

872
00:55:24.451 --> 00:55:29.250
That's like a,
that's like when you got old technology,

873
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.180
you know what I mean?
Like me,

874
00:55:30.181 --> 00:55:34.740
I just bought an iPod not knowing that phones are basically iPods now.
Yeah.

875
00:55:34.741 --> 00:55:38.820
It just stupid.
I,
it's an extra fucking odd,
that's a terrible example.

876
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:43.350
What am I trying to think of?
What am I,

877
00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:45.350
it's like they got what?
They got wireless mikes now.

878
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.980
For some reason I got a cord on this one.

879
00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:48.570
It could be walking all around my apartment,

880
00:55:48.571 --> 00:55:51.540
making me make myself a sandwich and I'm not,

881
00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:55.230
that's another bad example.
Jesus,
I'm going to fucking hold here.

882
00:55:55.231 --> 00:56:00.210
You know what I'm saying?
I haven't been to confession in a long time.
Uh,
and uh,

883
00:56:00.211 --> 00:56:05.110
I dunno.
I would actually like to start going to church again.

884
00:56:05.111 --> 00:56:07.590
What do you think about that?
Does anybody got any good suggestions out there?

885
00:56:07.591 --> 00:56:11.430
We got a church where it's not the Catholic church,

886
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:17.180
it's not a church where the person you're in church with started the religion

887
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:24.770
and it's somehow become a Christ like figure and is trying to brainwash you that

888
00:56:24.841 --> 00:56:29.660
it's okay for him to start having sex with your children.
Okay.

889
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.300
I don't join a cult.
Okay.

890
00:56:31.301 --> 00:56:35.020
Somewhere between a cult in an organized religion and I don't want any fucking

891
00:56:35.021 --> 00:56:39.710
Mr. Good vibe shit.
Either
double.

892
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:44.310
Why don't I start a church and we go,
oh that's right.

893
00:56:44.311 --> 00:56:46.260
Cause I'm not qualified.
I don't know what,
you know what is,

894
00:56:46.261 --> 00:56:50.070
I liked the discipline at church.
I was speaking to that.
You know what dude?

895
00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:52.630
I that he'd say dude's what kind of

896
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:55.970
<v 7>so says it.
You know what dudes,
let me lay this one on you.</v>

897
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:58.310
I did bought the Bob and Tom Show.

898
00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:01.720
<v 6>I've been on the road for two weeks.
By the way.
This is basically what happened.</v>

899
00:57:01.721 --> 00:57:02.830
I was working in Columbus,

900
00:57:02.831 --> 00:57:06.910
Ohio and then I was going on to work a Caroline's in New York City.

901
00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:10.210
So I had back to back weeks on the road and after that I can tell you what's

902
00:57:10.211 --> 00:57:10.780
underrated.

903
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:15.040
You know what's an underrated sleeping and your own fucking bed is underrated.

904
00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:19.660
Having access to your entire wardrobe is underrated.

905
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:23.350
Being able to rub one out and not have to put it,

906
00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:27.760
please don't clean the room now sign on your door.

907
00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:30.760
That's also,
that's also overrated.

908
00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:34.460
Remembering what the f

909
00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:38.410
<v 7>fuck you were talking about.
That's overrated.
Hey,
does anybody have like a,</v>

910
00:57:38.411 --> 00:57:39.960
a help your memory

911
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.690
<v 6>like brain game that I can start playing?</v>

912
00:57:43.691 --> 00:57:46.450
Cause I'm starting to really believe that your brain is a muscle because I am

913
00:57:46.451 --> 00:57:51.451
really losing my train of thought at a disturbing amount every single day.

914
00:57:52.271 --> 00:57:54.880
Now.
And I was just reading this story about,
uh,

915
00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:58.420
you know that le asked her lady who passed away in New York,

916
00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.220
the aster family Astor place and all that type of shit.
She,

917
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:05.890
<v 7>I guess she got Alzheimer's and it sounded like a fucking horrific way to go.</v>

918
00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:09.130
So I started thinking like,
well what if I start playing Pictionary?

919
00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.830
What have I got a toys r us and I buy that game?

920
00:58:11.831 --> 00:58:15.980
That's supposed to help kids memories,
you know,
we get the cards,
you know,

921
00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:19.220
and you turn one over,
it's an owl and you try to find the other owl

922
00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:20.510
<v 6>and then you'd</v>

923
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:24.740
<v 7>try it and it's an hour and then it's a basset hound and you're like,
fuck,</v>

924
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:28.850
you know,
and then your parents go,
I knew you weren't going to amount to shit.

925
00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:32.100
Right.
I remember that game.
Isn't there?

926
00:58:32.101 --> 00:58:34.950
Is there an adult version of that than anybody can recommend?
Because seriously,

927
00:58:34.951 --> 00:58:36.600
I really don't want to go out like that.

928
00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:41.070
Is anybody staying up on that whole aster family fucking thing with a guy who

929
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:44.550
evidently was the son as the,
as the,
uh,

930
00:58:44.551 --> 00:58:49.470
the older asked her lady went into her,
seen Al years.
He just started,
you know,

931
00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:52.200
rewriting her will so he get all the cash.

932
00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:56.460
That's a weird fucking family.
The Astors,

933
00:58:57.850 --> 00:59:02.400
it's like the whole,
that lady,
the lady who just died a couple of years ago,

934
00:59:02.401 --> 00:59:05.010
she gave away like $200 million to charity.

935
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:08.580
But if you look at how they got their shit,
they was slum lords,

936
00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:13.560
like a century worth of people died of tuberculosis in their fucking damp,

937
00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:17.790
dark fucking walk in closet apartments that they had.

938
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:20.880
And then after a while they felt guilty.
So they started giving it.

939
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:23.660
But you know what?
I'm onto your game.

940
00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:29.960
They ever tell you my theory about statues.
Unless you're like an artist,

941
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:34.010
an entertainer,
a sportsperson or whatever,
you know,

942
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:39.290
if there's a statue of you,
unless you're,
you're one of those kinds of people,

943
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:42.890
you did something fucked up,
you know?

944
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:49.250
Does that make any sense to you?
Like Stevie Ray Vaughn got a statue,
right?

945
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.320
What did he do?
He made albums.
He played guitar.

946
00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.350
I'm sure you've heard some people around him at some point,
you know,

947
00:59:54.351 --> 00:59:58.220
swung his guitar around,
the strap broke and he fucking smash some chicken.

948
00:59:58.221 --> 01:00:02.900
The teeth.
Maybe that happened,
you know,
I'm just saying,
generally speaking,

949
01:00:02.901 --> 01:00:06.080
he didn't hurt anybody.
But then you look at these other guys,
you're like,

950
01:00:06.081 --> 01:00:10.280
who the fuck is that guy?
Anytime this here's a,
here's a fun exercise.

951
01:00:10.281 --> 01:00:12.290
Next time you walk by a statue,
when you're looking at it like,

952
01:00:12.291 --> 01:00:13.520
who the fuck is that guy?

953
01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.150
Go on the internet and just Google whatever his name is,

954
01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:22.570
and then write a robber baron after it or some sort of just right corrupt and

955
01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:28.520
Google it and watch all the fucking articles you find granted.
You know,

956
01:00:28.521 --> 01:00:31.340
you're not really you,
you know,
you know I never really Google that.

957
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:33.320
You know the same name and great guy.

958
01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.540
I never do that either because I just get a thought in my head.

959
01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.310
That's a lot of people do when they go on the Internet,

960
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:38.390
you have a thought in your head,

961
01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.690
what you fucking think somebody is or what the fuck's going on.

962
01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.570
And then you just Google shit.
And the way you Google it,

963
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:48.050
it's so everyone will support you.
You know?

964
01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.510
Like if you think someone's an asshole,
you're like,

965
01:00:50.511 --> 01:00:55.511
you know Brian Jones Douche and then you Google and then all these artists can't

966
01:00:55.911 --> 01:00:59.630
come up.
And then you go,
there you go.
Look at all the articles,
right?
See,

967
01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:03.650
he is a Douche.
You know,

968
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.070
he's supposed to just go with a guy's name and then then peace through him.

969
01:01:07.071 --> 01:01:09.140
I never do that.
I'm actually yelling at myself right now.

970
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:14.270
You guys want to hear a story?
Um,
Oh,
before I get into that,

971
01:01:14.271 --> 01:01:16.870
I gotta I gotta I got to rectify something I said last week,
you know,

972
01:01:16.871 --> 01:01:19.950
I was talking about how Pontiac went out of business and I was saying the Trans

973
01:01:19.951 --> 01:01:24.260
am was like their best car.
And I was like,
what else did they have after that?

974
01:01:24.261 --> 01:01:28.820
It goes to the sunburn than the Pontiac t 1000.
There's a major drop off.
I,

975
01:01:28.821 --> 01:01:30.860
uh,
I,
I stand corrected.

976
01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:34.580
Later on that day I was laying in bed and I actually sat up,
right?

977
01:01:34.581 --> 01:01:39.260
And I was like,
how the fuck did I forget the Pontiac Gto,
you know,

978
01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:42.650
the Bonneville,
they had a lot of good cars.

979
01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:49.280
It's not the Aztec.
I'm looking right now,
the top 10 Pontiac's of all time.

980
01:01:49.281 --> 01:01:51.200
And they actually put the Pontiac Aztec.

981
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:55.340
If that wasn't the ugliest fucking vehicle other than the Chevy Lumina,

982
01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.810
remember that thing?
Chevy fucking Lumina.
All right,

983
01:01:59.811 --> 01:02:02.090
so he has something for you guys.
You want to,
you want to look,

984
01:02:02.091 --> 01:02:03.740
I'm really into cars and that type of shit.

985
01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:07.400
If you want to see one of the most fucked up looking vehicles of all time,

986
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:13.070
Google this.
I'm not even asking you.
I'm telling you Google this,

987
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:18.100
the a GMC Futurliner all right,

988
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:21.960
and however you spell it,
you're going to be able to find it.
Um,

989
01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:26.390
this was something that they made in like the 1940s.

990
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:30.570
They had this thing called the parade of progress is a great youtube video at

991
01:02:30.571 --> 01:02:34.470
something else.
You can Google the parade of progress and they had these,

992
01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:36.240
I can't even explain what they are.

993
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:39.930
It'd be like picture of a toaster eight a Winnebago.

994
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.890
That's what this fucking thing looks like.
Are you looking it up right now?

995
01:02:43.891 --> 01:02:45.360
Yet your desk,
you sit in there,

996
01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:47.820
your cubicle pretending like you're doing your real work.

997
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.620
You got to look this thing up.

998
01:02:49.621 --> 01:02:53.340
I apologize to people on planes right now or if you're on a treadmill,

999
01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.820
but you got to look this fucking thing up.
I want to,
I,

1000
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:58.890
I never even heard of these things.
And I was watching one of those auto shows,

1001
01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:02.880
you know,
all those rich cons go out and they spent $2 million in a Mustang.

1002
01:03:02.881 --> 01:03:07.020
So now I can't buy one.
Well this seems more like a couple hundred thousand,

1003
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:11.370
but this thing actually went for like a million dollars,
maybe even more.
Um,

1004
01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.260
it actually to look at it from the side,
it looks like it has four wheels,

1005
01:03:16.261 --> 01:03:19.500
but each wheel is doubled.
You know,
like those duly pickups.

1006
01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:23.340
So it actually has eight wheels.
And like I said,
it literally looks like

1007
01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:28.140
the jolly green giant had a toaster with wheels on it.

1008
01:03:28.141 --> 01:03:33.080
This is what the fuck that thing would look like.
But,
um,
I don't think,

1009
01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:37.620
I think 99% of Americans have never seen this thing.

1010
01:03:37.621 --> 01:03:41.040
And if you ever had one of those and just drove it down the fucking street,

1011
01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:45.180
a bunch of people would look at.
Yeah.
And isn't that,

1012
01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:48.570
isn't that what we're all asking for?
Everyone's gonna look in your direction.

1013
01:03:48.571 --> 01:03:53.020
It'd be like,
wow,
who's that guy?
Is he a rebel?
Um,

1014
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:56.190
all right.
I gotta read this fucked up email before.
This isn't even the podcast.

1015
01:03:56.191 --> 01:03:58.800
This is just me bullshitting around here.
Let me get into a,

1016
01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:03.420
here's a story somebody sent to me,
which brings up an interesting debate here.

1017
01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.270
Says,
hey bill,
my name is so and so.

1018
01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:08.340
I'm just writing to let you know you're my favorite comedian.

1019
01:04:08.341 --> 01:04:11.340
I really can relate to everything you say.
Not sure if that's good or bad.

1020
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:16.670
Ello fucking l m I bought tickets to see you on Friday at Carolines in New York.

1021
01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:22.680
I spent over $200 on tickets about a month before so that me and my friends

1022
01:04:22.681 --> 01:04:25.710
could go and have a grand old time.
Well,
Lo and behold,

1023
01:04:25.711 --> 01:04:27.720
of course the shit only happens to me.

1024
01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:32.670
We get on the train two hours before you go on so we can get there plenty of

1025
01:04:32.671 --> 01:04:35.580
time and watched the show.
But Lo and behold,
what happens?

1026
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.530
Some fucking lady decided that she was going to end her life and get hit by the

1027
01:04:40.531 --> 01:04:42.780
train in front of mine.

1028
01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:47.850
I know it's a sad thing and I should feel bad,
but fuck that.

1029
01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:53.250
I was like really lady a a serious of all the fucking trains and had to be the

1030
01:04:53.251 --> 01:04:57.750
one that I was on that got delayed two hours.
I'm like fuck,

1031
01:04:57.751 --> 01:04:59.700
if you want to kill yourself because you know,

1032
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:02.100
cause you're miserable with your life,

1033
01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:06.900
go shoot yourself a jump off a bridge but don't make us all suffer.
So anyways,

1034
01:05:06.901 --> 01:05:09.720
long story short,
I only got to see the last 30 minutes she just show,

1035
01:05:09.721 --> 01:05:12.300
which was great,
but I was disappointed that we couldn't see the whole thing.

1036
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:16.170
I'm not sure when you'll be in New York again.
I'm sure your website,

1037
01:05:16.171 --> 01:05:18.970
we'll post a,
we'll post the date whenever it will be.

1038
01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:21.550
While you're probably wondering why the fuck I'm writing you.

1039
01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:24.730
Well I have to vent to someone that's on my level of understanding,

1040
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.420
understanding people's suck.
Jesus Christ.

1041
01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.830
While I'm sorry.
Sorry to hear that.
You don't,
you should've.

1042
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.390
You should've told me that story.
You know,

1043
01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:36.970
I would have fucked her and I would have tossed you a DVD at the end.

1044
01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:40.870
Would have given you something for your dear raw,
your troubles.
Um,

1045
01:05:40.871 --> 01:05:43.580
you actually bring up good point.
You know,
if you're going to kill yourself,
ah,

1046
01:05:43.581 --> 01:05:46.240
it's bad enough,
you're going to make everyone around you suffer.
But hear me,

1047
01:05:46.241 --> 01:05:49.180
complete strangers suffer the lay there night of fun.

1048
01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:53.770
What a fucking way to go.
Jesus Christ.
I can tell you right now,
uh,

1049
01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:57.820
there is no way to do a thorough clean up after somebody jumps in front of a

1050
01:05:57.821 --> 01:06:00.880
fucking train.
There's no fucking way you're getting every piece.

1051
01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:05.070
You know what I mean?
There's no way.
If you don't believe me,
uh,

1052
01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:08.590
when did you go get a flank steak and sticking mad in it and light it off in

1053
01:06:08.591 --> 01:06:11.650
your kitchen,
clean it up to the best of your ability.

1054
01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:16.180
And I guarantee you six months from now you're going to be finding shit in the

1055
01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:20.860
curtains.
You know,
there's just,
uh,
and yeah,

1056
01:06:20.861 --> 01:06:23.620
for those of you who didn't wonder,
this is a very educational podcast,
that's,

1057
01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:26.950
that's what like jumping in front of a train is,
that's exactly what it's like.

1058
01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:31.450
Lighting off an mat in a flank.
Steak in a kitchen.
All right,

1059
01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:35.890
so right now,
even if you press stop and you never listened to the rest of this,

1060
01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:39.760
you actually fucking learn something.
All right,
so here we go.

1061
01:06:39.761 --> 01:06:43.930
This is the podcast.
This is what the fuck I do.
I do it every single Monday.

1062
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:47.740
People send me questions and a information.

1063
01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:52.210
We have a list of stuff that's overrated and underrated.
Uh,

1064
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:56.080
people send me stories about revenge and all that type of shit.

1065
01:06:56.350 --> 01:07:01.240
Have I really been talking for fucking 20 minutes?
Is that true?

1066
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:07.090
Did I fuck up again?
You know what?
There's no way for me to know.
Ah,
Shit.

1067
01:07:07.091 --> 01:07:10.390
I have to hit stop.
Fuck,
fuck.

1068
01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:16.930
All right.
So I fucked up.
You know,
I,
I thought I,

1069
01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.720
uh,
Jeez.
I can't even tell you what the fuck I thought.
I can't even explain it.

1070
01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.180
I thought,
I thought it was only three minutes into the podcasts.

1071
01:07:22.181 --> 01:07:24.790
I looked down and said 19 minutes and I thought I fucked up.

1072
01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:28.810
I thought I started the podcast at the end of another fucked up podcast and it

1073
01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:32.170
turned out I didn't.
So there's just going to be two tracks this week,

1074
01:07:32.171 --> 01:07:35.800
which are a lot of you actually should probably enjoy on some level because a

1075
01:07:35.801 --> 01:07:38.560
number of you give me shit about how big my files are.

1076
01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:44.050
Who the two too long to download mean?
Well,
when are you up globe?
Uh,

1077
01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:47.140
upload,
upgrade your fucking technology.
I what do you want from me?

1078
01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:51.310
I don't know how to do this shit.
Stop giving me shit.
All right.

1079
01:07:51.570 --> 01:07:52.780
You fucking people every week.

1080
01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.000
People seem to like last week when I was all hung over,

1081
01:07:55.001 --> 01:07:57.310
it's a lot of people said it was one of the best podcasts of all time.

1082
01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.430
But there was a couple of people who actually went out of the way to tell me

1083
01:08:00.431 --> 01:08:02.980
that they thought that it sucked,
you know,

1084
01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:08.920
don't do anymore hung over podcast a cat that,

1085
01:08:08.921 --> 01:08:11.470
that one kind of thought women really didn't like it.

1086
01:08:11.471 --> 01:08:13.150
Did I say something really mean about women?

1087
01:08:13.151 --> 01:08:16.130
Because the only ones who didn't like it were women.
You know,

1088
01:08:16.131 --> 01:08:20.120
I don't know if you have drunk boyfriends,
do you know?
Or spouses.

1089
01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:24.860
He was such a swell guy.
And then after we got married,
everything was going,

1090
01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.710
it was going great.
And then one day I work,

1091
01:08:27.711 --> 01:08:32.711
he hurt his back and then they started taking pain pills and then he had an

1092
01:08:33.231 --> 01:08:37.100
episode of intervention,
you know?
So is that what it reminded you of?

1093
01:08:37.101 --> 01:08:40.880
I wasn't trying to piss anyone off.
All right.
Um,
so anyways,

1094
01:08:40.881 --> 01:08:44.660
having survived the epidemic in New York City,

1095
01:08:44.661 --> 01:08:46.730
the swine flu epidemic,

1096
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:50.990
I was so sick of them using the words epidemic and pandemic,

1097
01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.740
you know,
I was like,
what the fuck is the difference?

1098
01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:58.520
So basically an epidemic is when you,
I guess it's some sort of whatever,

1099
01:08:58.521 --> 01:09:01.910
it's some sort of disease or some shit,
but it's,
it's confined.

1100
01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:06.020
It's confined to one country,
I guess.
And a pandemic is global,

1101
01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:11.570
you know,
and if it's just in an area,
in a country that's a breakout,

1102
01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.240
but the definition of an epidemic every,

1103
01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:18.080
evidently what makes something an epidemic according to Wikipedia,

1104
01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:20.480
I'm saving you guys time.
You don't have to look it up and read it.

1105
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:25.250
Cause that's where I get it from an epidemic is basically,

1106
01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:29.930
uh,
it basically says to finding an epidemic can be subjective.

1107
01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.490
Um,

1108
01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:36.490
depending in part on what is expected and epidemic may be restricted to one

1109
01:09:37.491 --> 01:09:40.130
local locale and outbreak like I just said,

1110
01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:45.280
a more general and epidemic or even global pandemic,
uh,

1111
01:09:45.350 --> 01:09:48.530
because it is based on what is expected or thought normal.

1112
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:53.540
A few cases of a very rare disease,
like rabies may be classified as an epidemic,

1113
01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:58.780
while many cases of the common common diseases like the common cold would not,

1114
01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.390
you know what I mean?
So basically if you know,

1115
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:05.660
five people had rabies out here in la,

1116
01:10:05.661 --> 01:10:09.410
that would be considered an epidemic because that's five more than they
expected.

1117
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.700
Uh,
but if everybody had the fucking ass flu,

1118
01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:19.100
you know,
they'd be like,
well,
you know,
we told them to wear condoms.
Um,
all right,

1119
01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:25.040
let's get to the a overrated underrated here for this week.
Uh,
overrated.

1120
01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:26.780
This guy sends in,
he said,

1121
01:10:26.781 --> 01:10:30.350
a red sox sweeping the Yankees in April.

1122
01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:35.720
I thought that that was hilarious because not only is that true,

1123
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:36.980
it is just April,

1124
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:42.020
but what I really found funny is that if the Yankees swept the red sox,

1125
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:46.220
that dude would not think that it was overrated.
He will be like,
you see,

1126
01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.000
we focus on all you guys for Com.
Boston goes fucking shock.

1127
01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:53.160
Everything closes by one's fucking city.
So fuck and leave.

1128
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.350
Kenny can get a full can slice.
Um,

1129
01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:00.860
I don't think the red sox sweeping the Yankees in April is overrated.

1130
01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:03.350
You know,
you know,

1131
01:11:03.351 --> 01:11:07.280
I think it's overrated spending $420 million on three fucking guys.

1132
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:09.830
What are you going about that?
That's fucking overrated.

1133
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:15.610
Spending $200 million a year to not win the series is overrated.

1134
01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:21.030
I don't understand why.
Don't think Yankees trust their farm system.
Oh,

1135
01:11:21.031 --> 01:11:24.660
I know why they don't trust him because all their farm system has ever given

1136
01:11:24.661 --> 01:11:29.520
them is Lou Gehrig.
Joe Dimaggio,
Mickey Mantle,

1137
01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:35.160
Derek Jeter,
Andy Pettitte,
Bernie Williams,

1138
01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:37.620
Jorge Posada.
Why the fuck would you,

1139
01:11:37.621 --> 01:11:42.621
why would you wait around to build a team when you can go out and spend hundreds

1140
01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:46.170
of millions of dollars on shitheads?

1141
01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:50.910
They can you fuck them.
They're not going to win it again this year.

1142
01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:55.680
Fucking unbelievable.
I was sitting there,
go on to $420 million on three guys.

1143
01:11:55.681 --> 01:11:59.490
There's no fucking way,
you know,
and to share.

1144
01:11:59.491 --> 01:12:02.460
It was on the angels last year.
I mean,
that guy,
he looked like a beast.

1145
01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:08.400
I don't know.
I actually went to Yankee stadium on a Sunday,
new Yankee stadium,

1146
01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:13.080
and I gotta admit I really had a lot of mixed emotions.
Uh,

1147
01:12:13.081 --> 01:12:17.250
as I,
as I got out there,
I got off and I looked at old Yankee stadium.
I'm like,

1148
01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:22.170
that's Yankee stadium.
You know,
I don't know.
I'm a sentimental jackass.

1149
01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:25.140
I'm,
I'm into the history,
you know,
I loved going into that place.

1150
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:28.770
That fucking place was awesome.
You know,

1151
01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:32.700
even though so many horrific things happen to the red sox there,
I mean,
Jesus,

1152
01:12:32.701 --> 01:12:36.480
if you had any sort of a sports fan,
he got it.
You got to respect that.

1153
01:12:36.481 --> 01:12:40.770
That's the,
uh,
that's the number one stadium and all four sports without a doubt.

1154
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:42.840
26 fucking championships.

1155
01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:47.640
Not even those fucking sissies up in Montreal can say that,

1156
01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:53.010
you know,
hey,
what do you think?
Did I ask you guys this question?

1157
01:12:53.011 --> 01:12:56.220
What do you think's the most overrated team with like,

1158
01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.370
like as far as the has like the most amount of championships.

1159
01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:01.440
I was talking to this with a,
with a guy the other day.

1160
01:13:01.441 --> 01:13:05.190
Like you ever notice like in any sort of league there's always like a,

1161
01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:06.900
there's always one team in the,

1162
01:13:06.901 --> 01:13:11.901
in the inception of a league that always goes on a run in the beginning and they

1163
01:13:12.271 --> 01:13:13.710
go on such a run that,
you know,

1164
01:13:13.711 --> 01:13:17.820
basically for the most part it's going to take another century to catch up with

1165
01:13:17.821 --> 01:13:22.470
them if you even can,
you know?
Do you know what I'm saying?

1166
01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.790
Like look with the Celtics,
the Celtics went on that run in the 60s.
It's like,

1167
01:13:26.791 --> 01:13:30.220
come on man.
Do you see what people look like?
They,
they,
they,
they barely will.

1168
01:13:30.221 --> 01:13:34.350
Like the league just started,
you know what I mean?
I mean,

1169
01:13:34.351 --> 01:13:35.910
you look at that shit the way they play.

1170
01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:39.450
Like I think I could have fucking made the final cut,
you know?

1171
01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.210
And then he got the Yankees,
they one way back,

1172
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:45.990
a whole bunch back in the three stooges era.
But,
uh,

1173
01:13:45.991 --> 01:13:48.080
I really don't disrespect the baseball one once the,

1174
01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.760
once they let black people and Latinos in and that type of shit,

1175
01:13:50.761 --> 01:13:54.030
the Yankees still fucking dominated.
But,
uh,
I,

1176
01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:59.040
I think I might have to go with the Canadians just for the simple fact that

1177
01:13:59.251 --> 01:14:02.610
there were only six teams,
you know what I mean?

1178
01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:05.370
So I think it's kind of easy,

1179
01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:10.170
much easier to go on a run and hockey than it was in basketball or even

1180
01:14:10.171 --> 01:14:15.130
baseball.
Cause I think baseball had like,
uh,
how many teams did they have?

1181
01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:17.620
Like Jesus,
I probably should have looked this up.
I used to know this shit.

1182
01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:22.270
I think they had about fit 1460 and I was like,
yeah,
maybe 12 teams.

1183
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:26.900
Um,
but it is another thing too,
back in the day when,
when you went to the world,

1184
01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:30.520
when if you won the division that was winning the pennant,
you know,

1185
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.560
and then you just immediately went to the world series.

1186
01:14:32.561 --> 01:14:36.730
There wasn't fucking a round of playoffs before the world series for a while

1187
01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:41.380
until they got past a certain amount of teams.
And uh,
you know,

1188
01:14:41.381 --> 01:14:43.150
when a Stanley Cup you had to win eight games,

1189
01:14:43.151 --> 01:14:45.730
that's a whole nother fucking deal.
You know what I mean?
Like nowadays,

1190
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:48.220
like all these,
all these teams,

1191
01:14:48.221 --> 01:14:51.730
there's like 30 teams in every single fucking league now.

1192
01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:55.720
So now you got a one in 30 chance as opposed to back in the day,
look at hockey.

1193
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.050
You had a one in six chance of winning the cup and it's something else.

1194
01:14:59.051 --> 01:14:59.890
I didn't notice either.

1195
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:03.220
The Amman that the Toronto Maple leaves hung with the Canadians right up til

1196
01:15:03.221 --> 01:15:05.680
1967.
They were like neck and neck.

1197
01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.250
They will like 15 Stanley cups.
Verse 13

1198
01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.330
fucking Toronto was right there,
man.
And then they did.

1199
01:15:13.331 --> 01:15:17.410
They just shit the bed my whole life.
Then I was bored.

1200
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:21.410
I think I'm cursing the Toronto Maple leafs.
Um,

1201
01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:24.970
[inaudible] you know what,
before the k fans get pissed,

1202
01:15:24.971 --> 01:15:27.040
I'm just breaking your balls because I know you guys.

1203
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:30.730
You won like what'd you win?
Seven cups in the 70s.
Is that what you did?

1204
01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:34.180
I think you did.
And that was with the expansion 12th but even that was bullshit.

1205
01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:37.180
Cause then they took the expansion six and they just put them in their own

1206
01:15:37.181 --> 01:15:40.630
fucking division.
So then all you had to do was just a,

1207
01:15:40.631 --> 01:15:44.680
when the other division and then you went up against like the fucking Saint

1208
01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:48.940
Louis Blues like we did.
I liked the north star is assumption.
All right.

1209
01:15:48.941 --> 01:15:51.760
That last three minutes we're was for the fucking sports nerds.
All right,

1210
01:15:51.761 --> 01:15:53.080
let me move on here.
Oh,
I didn't say so.

1211
01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:58.050
I want it to new Yankee Stadium and I got to admit like,
I dunno man.
I,

1212
01:15:58.051 --> 01:15:59.980
I,
it was,
I got to,

1213
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:03.850
it was weird because you were looking at the Yankees.

1214
01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:07.870
I felt like I was at legends field,
you know,
I was like,

1215
01:16:07.871 --> 01:16:12.490
those are the New York Yankees,
but this is not their house.
I don't feel,

1216
01:16:12.491 --> 01:16:16.600
I don't feel the history,
you know.
Um,

1217
01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.600
and I also got admit it kind of looked like every other fucking stadium except

1218
01:16:19.601 --> 01:16:20.710
it had that cool facade.

1219
01:16:20.711 --> 01:16:24.760
The facade is the shit outside of the stadium is the ship and inside it just

1220
01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:29.010
Kinda,
it was like fucking voice cracks inside,
inside the stadium.

1221
01:16:29.011 --> 01:16:32.260
It just kind of looked like a,
I dunno,

1222
01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:36.010
I think I might like pac bell a little better.
I'll have to go again.

1223
01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:39.820
You know what some amazing shit has to happen there for that's,
that's the same,

1224
01:16:39.821 --> 01:16:40.930
all of those fucking things.

1225
01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:44.560
I can just go to Shea stadium and even after the red sox won it,

1226
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:47.170
I would still look at that spot with a boat where the ball went through

1227
01:16:47.171 --> 01:16:50.170
Buckner's legs,
except after we want it,
then it would,

1228
01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:55.030
I then I also saw the humor in it,
but until then,
until that point,
uh,
I didn't.

1229
01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:56.350
All right.
Moving on here.
All right.

1230
01:16:56.351 --> 01:17:00.880
The other thing that people say is a overrated,
uh,

1231
01:17:00.881 --> 01:17:04.990
the peoples,
peoples,
Kentucky Derby Pics.

1232
01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.980
I hate all these people who basically only watched three horse a year.

1233
01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.330
Um,
they only watched three horse races a year yet they,
they give me,

1234
01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:16.520
they come up to me and they give you a g,
you know,

1235
01:17:16.521 --> 01:17:19.220
something that half this isn't fucking me.
You know what?

1236
01:17:19.221 --> 01:17:21.680
I was actually going to blame the guy who fucking wrote that,
but I can't,

1237
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:24.620
you know,
that's actually how I've read it.
All right,
let me,

1238
01:17:24.621 --> 01:17:27.380
let me start over again.
People's Kentucky Derby Pics.

1239
01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:32.380
I hated how all these people who basically only watched three races a year yet

1240
01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:36.200
yet.
No,
you did fuck up yet.

1241
01:17:36.201 --> 01:17:41.201
They give you their derby picks and they say shit like it's going to be a sloppy

1242
01:17:42.801 --> 01:17:47.510
track today.
This horse thrives on a sloppy track.
Does he?

1243
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:51.810
You know what?
That was such a great fucking point.
I really butchered that.
Yeah,

1244
01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:55.060
I know.
Everybody starts acting like they're fucking Jack Klugman.
You know,

1245
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:59.420
with a rolled up program,
nobody gives a fuck about horse racing.
And you know,

1246
01:17:59.421 --> 01:18:03.050
back in the day,
horse racing and boxing used to be the number one sports.

1247
01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:08.060
Granted there was no football,
baseball and hockey,
basketball,

1248
01:18:08.061 --> 01:18:09.230
none of that shit was around.

1249
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:11.660
And then when I was around and took a while for it to take over.

1250
01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:15.650
This is just all going to be sports this week.
Uh,
pay per view.

1251
01:18:15.651 --> 01:18:19.340
Boxing matches are overrated.
They're never worth the money.

1252
01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:21.140
It's just all about the marketing.

1253
01:18:21.141 --> 01:18:26.120
I'm glad I didn't spend $50 on the hat and pocket.
Was it?
Paki Paki Oh,

1254
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:30.620
fight because a,
it was on youtube for free about two hours later.

1255
01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:35.000
Although I will buy a Paki Oh,
a Paki out.
However you say his name May.

1256
01:18:35.001 --> 01:18:38.540
Whether if that happens.
Well that's good to know,
sir.

1257
01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:43.040
I'm underrated.
Uh,
how gay those frilly boxing trunks,

1258
01:18:43.041 --> 01:18:47.840
some fighters where I think it's,
I think it's,

1259
01:18:47.841 --> 01:18:50.470
see this is the shit I can't read it cause it's too fucking small and going,
oh,

1260
01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:53.000
I'm getting old here.
I think it's health hysterical.

1261
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:57.800
When some fighters come out wearing some something Liberace would wear and then

1262
01:18:57.801 --> 01:19:02.720
they just get the shit beat out of him.
This guy really wrote some funny shit.

1263
01:19:02.721 --> 01:19:06.440
I'm just butchering it.
I guess I could never be a fucking newscaster.

1264
01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:11.060
Let me try that again.
Okay.
Underrated.
How gay those frilly boxing trunks.

1265
01:19:11.061 --> 01:19:14.420
Some fighters were.
C,
that's a fragment.

1266
01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.160
That's what trips me up.

1267
01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:20.450
She'd say how gay some of those frilly boxing trunks are that some of the

1268
01:19:20.451 --> 01:19:21.284
fighters were.

1269
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:25.640
I think it's hysterical when when a fighter comes out wearing something that

1270
01:19:25.641 --> 01:19:29.430
only Liberace would wear and then he goes on to get the shit kicked out of them.

1271
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:33.050
They,
they,
that's what I'll do.
I'll get the gist of it.
I'll just paraphrase.

1272
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:38.530
Underrated a massages with happy endings for 100 bucks.

1273
01:19:38.571 --> 01:19:42.740
You get a 60 minute massage that ends with an agent and Asian chick beating you

1274
01:19:42.741 --> 01:19:46.670
off.
And to top it off at the end for no extra charge,

1275
01:19:46.671 --> 01:19:50.120
she'll give you a table shower,
which is basically a bath.

1276
01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.760
It's how God must get a hand job.

1277
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:58.160
Dude,
you write really funny shit.
I mean,

1278
01:19:58.161 --> 01:20:00.620
I'm not telling you to go out there and you might,
you might get a future.

1279
01:20:00.621 --> 01:20:05.300
This son,
this Sonny boy.
Hey,
getting back to the,
uh,
the,
uh,

1280
01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.130
the swine flu shit.

1281
01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:10.890
There was a bunch of people walking around New York with those mass on those

1282
01:20:10.891 --> 01:20:13.560
little surgical mass.
How fucking hilarious is that.

1283
01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:19.110
It's an airborne virus.
I don't understand the thought process.

1284
01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:22.230
You're breathing through the mass.
What is it?

1285
01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:24.840
What does the little oxygen gets through but not to pig virus.

1286
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:28.290
You oxygen is just a wee bit smaller than the pig virus.

1287
01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:30.930
Pig virus just hits the front of the mosque and then that's it.

1288
01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:35.570
I was on my flight today flying out here from New York City and uh,

1289
01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:40.500
this is sort of weird and I want to know from my,
uh,
my Asian constituents,

1290
01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:42.960
whatever the fucking word is.
Um,

1291
01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:47.400
there was about six people on the plane who were all wearing those surgical

1292
01:20:47.401 --> 01:20:47.821
masks.

1293
01:20:47.821 --> 01:20:52.470
Like they were going to amputate someone's leg during the civil war or doing a

1294
01:20:52.471 --> 01:20:56.130
fucking guest star on Mash.
They were wearing and they were all Asian.

1295
01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:59.490
Only the agents were wearing those.
And what does that from,

1296
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:03.810
was that because they had to live through SARS and,

1297
01:21:03.811 --> 01:21:06.300
and they made it by the grace of God.

1298
01:21:06.301 --> 01:21:10.530
But there's so for some reason like attributing the,
uh,
the mass to it.

1299
01:21:11.370 --> 01:21:13.860
Does anybody know?
Does anybody know out there?
Anybody?

1300
01:21:14.010 --> 01:21:17.730
Anybody out there in podcast land.
All right,
I have to do the fucking math here,

1301
01:21:18.230 --> 01:21:21.270
um,
to 29 minutes.
Not to go too long.
All right.
By the way,
Bill,

1302
01:21:21.271 --> 01:21:23.730
congratulations on the Celtics speeding the bowls,

1303
01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:26.550
but I want to know how you feel about Derrick rose.

1304
01:21:26.551 --> 01:21:31.551
Just basically bitch slapping Brian Scalabrine in game seven with that nasty ass

1305
01:21:33.511 --> 01:21:38.250
block.
Uh,
considering we won the series,
I think I feel pretty fine about it.

1306
01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:41.490
I actually did a show that night and I miss game seven.
But uh,

1307
01:21:41.491 --> 01:21:45.750
you guys are going to be great man.
You guys have a great young team and uh,

1308
01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:51.320
that Guy Brian Scalabrine is at the fucking dude who looks like a Jesus Christ.

1309
01:21:52.021 --> 01:21:53.700
I always forget his fucking name.

1310
01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.300
What is that act as fucking name?

1311
01:21:57.301 --> 01:22:00.390
I always think Michael Mattson and then that screw on Matthew Modine.

1312
01:22:00.391 --> 01:22:01.620
I always think there's an m in it.

1313
01:22:02.670 --> 01:22:05.490
You know the guy he was in cop land,

1314
01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:11.220
he played the cop that had to disappear.
Uh,
what is his fucking name?

1315
01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:16.170
That's exactly what that fucking dude looks like.
Shit.

1316
01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:20.370
He started that,
that short lived Sitcom,
the war at home,

1317
01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:24.810
actually it mid lasted a season.
So that's actually successful these days.

1318
01:22:24.811 --> 01:22:27.900
The way they cancel them.
The fuck is his name.

1319
01:22:29.190 --> 01:22:32.400
I swear to God,
man.
I'm like literally,
I'm losing my mind here

1320
01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:39.510
now.
We have to Google it.
I have to take time out of the fucking podcast.

1321
01:22:40.710 --> 01:22:44.130
The and I have type with one hand because I'm holding my Monday night football

1322
01:22:44.131 --> 01:22:48.630
fucking microphone here.
The war at home.

1323
01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:53.490
It doesn't sound good.
You trying to uh,
Michael Rappaport.

1324
01:22:53.491 --> 01:22:57.450
There we go.
That's how he looks like he looks like Michael Rappaport.

1325
01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:58.530
I went to that Celtics,

1326
01:22:58.531 --> 01:23:02.430
Utah Jazz game out in Utah where Garnette got hurt and that Michael Rappaport,

1327
01:23:02.431 --> 01:23:02.701
dude,

1328
01:23:02.701 --> 01:23:07.701
I watched him have one file in the first half and then he fouled out in the

1329
01:23:07.791 --> 01:23:10.550
third quarter in the span.
I swear to God a four minutes.

1330
01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:15.250
I haven't seen any shit like that since Darryl Dawkins and I swear to God,

1331
01:23:15.251 --> 01:23:18.460
that's the end of the sports shit.
All right,
for the rest of you.
Here we go.

1332
01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:22.870
We're going to move on here.
Uh,
moving on to the next part of the podcast.

1333
01:23:22.871 --> 01:23:25.750
Where the fuck am I?
Okay.
Somebody wants my advice.
Dear Bill,

1334
01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:29.550
I guess this falls under the,
I need advice.
Call them of the podcast.
Uh,

1335
01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:34.620
my 30th birthday is four days before you're 41st according to Wikipedia.

1336
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:37.720
And I got to admit that I'm not looking forward to it.

1337
01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:41.060
I just feel like I'm getting old and it sucks.

1338
01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:45.980
I work with this kid who's 23 and a one day a couple weeks ago I caught myself

1339
01:23:45.981 --> 01:23:50.981
in the middle of a speech about how lucky he is to be 23 and how as a dude

1340
01:23:51.321 --> 01:23:54.350
that's the perfect age,
23 years old,
all I,

1341
01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:59.560
all I could remember was at that age I had pussy falling out of my pockets.

1342
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:02.660
And let's just say things have dried up since then.

1343
01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:06.950
I promptly shut the hell up when I realized I was starting to sound like my dad,

1344
01:24:07.190 --> 01:24:11.600
but the kid was actually listening to me and asking questions about typical guy

1345
01:24:11.601 --> 01:24:12.260
shit.

1346
01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:17.260
So basically what I'm asking is what advice would you please offer to me about

1347
01:24:17.581 --> 01:24:21.590
relationships and life in general?
You know,

1348
01:24:21.591 --> 01:24:26.520
like if I knew what I knew,
oh,
what I know now,
kind of shit.
Thanks in advance.

1349
01:24:26.610 --> 01:24:30.900
All right.
So obviously do,
do your relationships aren't working out.

1350
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:33.930
<v 6>So you've made the,
uh,</v>

1351
01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:39.180
<v 7>the brilliant decision to ask someone who's never made a relationship work.</v>

1352
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:45.150
Actually,
my relationship now is working,
right?
Um,
what are,

1353
01:24:45.151 --> 01:24:48.120
what does the advice,
AH,
Jesus Christ.
Where the fuck do I

1354
01:24:50.170 --> 01:24:54.220
<v 6>be?
Selfish.
There you go.
That's a good one.
I mean,
in your dating,</v>

1355
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:58.970
I'm literally tangled up in the fucking wires here.
All right?

1356
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.010
That's what you're gonna do.
You gotta be selfish

1357
01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:04.890
<v 7>and,
uh,
before you start date,
before you get back out,
just,</v>

1358
01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:09.310
just make a list of shit that you want.
You know,
like practical shit.

1359
01:25:09.311 --> 01:25:13.990
Don't be like big tits fucking round.
As she got to have nice toes.

1360
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:16.240
Uh,

1361
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:22.110
<v 6>what else man?
What the fuck else is there?
Nice face.
You know,</v>

1362
01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:26.790
Josh is nice but not a fucking whore.
You know what I'm saying?
Um,

1363
01:25:26.791 --> 01:25:30.380
you got to have some other shit too.
I don't,
I mean,
I haven't been able to,
uh,

1364
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:31.261
get married yet,

1365
01:25:31.261 --> 01:25:34.980
so that seems to be the pinnacle of a what makes a healthy relationship for some

1366
01:25:34.981 --> 01:25:36.510
fucking reason.
But,
uh,

1367
01:25:36.511 --> 01:25:40.980
I did have a buddy of mine and who was a complete fucking maniac and he got

1368
01:25:40.981 --> 01:25:44.670
married and I asked him,
uh,
how we went about doing it and he just said,

1369
01:25:44.671 --> 01:25:49.520
he's just,
he dumped all the fucking,
you know,
you know,

1370
01:25:49.521 --> 01:25:52.580
I was girls you got and your cell phone as much as just saying that dried up,

1371
01:25:52.581 --> 01:25:55.370
you know,
you've got all those numbers in your cell phone,
you know those numbers,

1372
01:25:55.880 --> 01:26:00.020
those numbers.
You only call at one 30,
two o'clock in the morning.
You know,

1373
01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:04.040
those girls,
you got to sever ties with those girls

1374
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:08.660
<v 7>because it's just,
it's too fucking easy.
It's like,
it's like,</v>

1375
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:12.470
it's like junk food.
If you got it laying around in your house,

1376
01:26:12.471 --> 01:26:14.280
you get them to come off,
you just kind of,
it's going to eat it.

1377
01:26:14.281 --> 01:26:15.860
He hoped with the bag,
eat the whole fucking thing.

1378
01:26:15.861 --> 01:26:18.530
And then you sitting there going,
why the fuck did I do that?
You know?

1379
01:26:19.730 --> 01:26:23.150
Then I read a blog up,
I wrote a blog about that,
how horses are like the,

1380
01:26:23.151 --> 01:26:27.620
the human equivalent to a fucking bag of Doritos.
Um,

1381
01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.540
how the fuck is it?
19 minutes again?

1382
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:34.760
What's 19 in 1938 there we go.
Okay.
I got to 12 minutes here.

1383
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:38.210
Um,
yeah,
so just really figured out what the fuck you want.
And this guy,

1384
01:26:38.211 --> 01:26:39.800
one of the great things he did was he,

1385
01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:43.100
if he found out he found out a girl he was dating,

1386
01:26:43.101 --> 01:26:46.490
one of the first questions he'd ask us if her parents were still together and if

1387
01:26:46.491 --> 01:26:50.110
they were still together,
he,
he,
there will be a second date.
And if there,

1388
01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:54.680
if they weren't still together,
there wasn't a second date and a,

1389
01:26:54.681 --> 01:26:56.900
I know a lot of people would get offended about that shit,

1390
01:26:56.901 --> 01:27:00.200
but that's a great way to get a pure bred,
you know,

1391
01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:04.380
other shit,
you know,
I dunno,

1392
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:06.740
you just got to make a list of what the fuck you want,

1393
01:27:06.741 --> 01:27:11.270
but you really got to stop.
Uh,
you got to stop fucking with the horse.

1394
01:27:11.271 --> 01:27:15.980
And it's a hard thing.
It's definitely a hard thing.
And,
uh,
ah,

1395
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:17.900
Geez,
I'm just,
I'm a little jet lag here,
dude.

1396
01:27:17.901 --> 01:27:19.340
If you asked me something a little more space,

1397
01:27:19.341 --> 01:27:21.230
some better when you ask me specific things,

1398
01:27:21.231 --> 01:27:24.950
because if you asked me an overall question like that,
all right,

1399
01:27:24.951 --> 01:27:28.910
what else can I come on?
And they'll think,
uh,
alright.
Everybody's nuts,

1400
01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:33.170
including you.
And,
uh,
so you got to,

1401
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:37.160
you got to find,
you've got to pick someone that compliments your crazy.

1402
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:40.820
You know what I mean?
You can't and you won't.

1403
01:27:40.821 --> 01:27:43.700
You think you want to get somebody who's the same kind of crazy.

1404
01:27:43.701 --> 01:27:47.000
So then you guys relate to each other,
but that's,

1405
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:50.420
that's not good because then you're both going bat shit at the same time.

1406
01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.880
And when that happens,
you,

1407
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:57.770
neither one of you have anybody to call to bail you out of the holding cells.

1408
01:27:58.210 --> 01:28:03.170
Um,
you know what I mean?
Um,
what else?
Jesus fucking Christ,

1409
01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:07.350
uh,
don't date those girls who say they used to be a whore,

1410
01:28:07.351 --> 01:28:12.320
but now they're not.
Don't date those girls.
Um,

1411
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:18.500
what else?
I don't fucking know,
Dude.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm really trying here.

1412
01:28:18.501 --> 01:28:22.160
You know what to write.
Write me back next week.
Asked me something more specific.

1413
01:28:22.670 --> 01:28:26.660
I'm just really,
I'm going blank here.
I'm really,
I'm really choking on this one.

1414
01:28:26.661 --> 01:28:28.100
I usually have a ton of shit to say.

1415
01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:32.240
Why is my fucking software updates are available for your computer?

1416
01:28:32.241 --> 01:28:37.100
Do you want to install them?
No,
I'm doing a fucking podcast.
Not now.

1417
01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.040
Uh,
Shit.
Well you know what,

1418
01:28:40.041 --> 01:28:43.070
if anybody else out there has some fucking advice to give them,
obviously I got,

1419
01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:43.963
I got nothing.

1420
01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.600
I only have advice about how to get out of relationships like that dude,

1421
01:28:47.601 --> 01:28:49.880
that one time he was asking me and you want,

1422
01:28:49.881 --> 01:28:53.750
the biggest thing I shared an email back I forgot to tell him was when he was

1423
01:28:53.751 --> 01:28:56.570
getting away from that,
just to do a recap.
He was with this girl,

1424
01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.840
she had a couple kids with another guy and he was kind of in the relationship

1425
01:28:59.841 --> 01:29:02.340
with her and he was semi passed

1426
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:06.870
<v 6>out when he was drunk.
When he walked up,
she was fucking flirting with,</v>

1427
01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:08.730
with his best friend.

1428
01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:12.870
So he's trying to get out of the relationship and I told him basically he knew

1429
01:29:12.871 --> 01:29:17.550
what he needed to do,
but I forgot the number one thing that a,
uh,

1430
01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:22.290
I forgot to tell him was under no circumstances should he ever fuck that girl

1431
01:29:22.291 --> 01:29:24.480
again.
Uh,

1432
01:29:24.481 --> 01:29:27.690
you got to watch out for those girls that already have kids by somebody else.

1433
01:29:27.691 --> 01:29:29.850
You really got to watch out in general.

1434
01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:32.490
You got to watch out during that breakup time.

1435
01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:36.360
You really got to watch out because there's a lot of crazy fucking people go

1436
01:29:36.361 --> 01:29:40.080
nuts guys.
And women go nuts.
Guys could get physical,

1437
01:29:40.081 --> 01:29:42.540
they can start stocking you.
They go that route.

1438
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:47.670
Women can get crazy and accidentally take themselves off the fucking pill

1439
01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:54.210
in some sort of fucked up desperation either to keep it going or even worse,

1440
01:29:54.211 --> 01:29:55.520
some sort of vengeance thing.

1441
01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:58.680
They're just not thinking clearly and then they get knocked up and next thing

1442
01:29:58.681 --> 01:30:02.190
you know they're thinking clearly and they don't want the fucking kid either.

1443
01:30:02.191 --> 01:30:05.550
And yet you're joined at the hip,
so wear a fucking condom.

1444
01:30:05.551 --> 01:30:10.550
That's another thing to wear a fucking condom and uh,

1445
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:14.220
yeah,
do that shit.
Wear a condom.
You know,
that's another good thing too.

1446
01:30:14.221 --> 01:30:17.310
If you get with a girl and she starts asking you if you've been tested and that

1447
01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:21.510
type of shit,
that's a good thing.
You want a Bronx tale?

1448
01:30:21.511 --> 01:30:25.860
Like lock the door test hookup with a girl.
All right.
And uh,

1449
01:30:25.861 --> 01:30:27.390
when you get ready to do the deed,

1450
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.470
don't bring up a condom and if she doesn't flinch,
you know,

1451
01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:35.280
stand up and just walk out with your heart on.

1452
01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:39.390
No one has the fucking strength to do that,

1453
01:30:39.391 --> 01:30:42.730
but at least for the love of God fucking put one on.
All right.
That's it dude.

1454
01:30:42.731 --> 01:30:44.540
That,
that advice really sucked.
I'm telling you,

1455
01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:49.290
just ask me something more specific.
I'll try to help you out.
Um,
all right,

1456
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:51.600
let's get to the final thing that I'm going to do this week.

1457
01:30:51.630 --> 01:30:55.290
A little jet lag this week and it's hot as fuck in this room.

1458
01:30:55.291 --> 01:30:58.350
For some reason I can't open the goddamn windows because a,

1459
01:30:58.351 --> 01:31:00.280
it picks up every sound from the street.
Uh,

1460
01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:02.850
last week I actually asked a question about,
uh,

1461
01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:08.780
how to change the default on my computer for the size of the font when I type

1462
01:31:09.271 --> 01:31:13.110
out my files because I'm really bad at computers and a,

1463
01:31:13.111 --> 01:31:16.380
somebody actually helped me out with it.
Like that day.
It's really simple.

1464
01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:19.350
If you're an apple work,
she'd go to edit

1465
01:31:20.970 --> 01:31:23.880
a up on the toolbar there.
You Click on edit,

1466
01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:29.310
fucking do it right now and click on edit and what do you wait,

1467
01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:32.070
what the fuck?
This doesn't make sense.
Go to edit.
No,

1468
01:31:32.071 --> 01:31:35.250
you don't click on apple works.
That's what you want to do.
Go on apple works.

1469
01:31:35.251 --> 01:31:38.970
Then you click on prevalence,
prevalence preferences.

1470
01:31:40.270 --> 01:31:43.530
All right,
let me start over again.
You go to apple works,
click on that.

1471
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:47.160
You go into preferences and then you click on general

1472
01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:52.800
and uh,
let's see if I can do this here.
Oh yeah.

1473
01:31:52.801 --> 01:31:55.620
And then you'll see your default size is right there.

1474
01:31:55.621 --> 01:31:57.300
And then you just click on the fucking heroin.

1475
01:31:57.301 --> 01:32:00.070
You could pick one other size and then he hit okay.
That's how you

1476
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:01.930
<v 7>do it.
I know that's very basic.</v>

1477
01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.630
If you guys have some more difficult fucking questions,

1478
01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.940
you wanna ask him on this podcast,
I will read them.

1479
01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:10.630
And this computer nerds out there that can not wait to fucking help you.

1480
01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:14.860
Um,
what else do we got here?

1481
01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:17.410
I think I have,

1482
01:32:17.410 --> 01:32:22.180
I think I just have a fucking hangover story and then our vengeance thing.
Wow,

1483
01:32:22.210 --> 01:32:24.370
I'm really losing momentum here.
I don't know what to do.

1484
01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:27.310
It's at the beginning of fucking $6 million man.

1485
01:32:27.311 --> 01:32:30.520
You know when that little fucking kite that he's flying,

1486
01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:33.220
why don't they ever show that fucking show in reruns?

1487
01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:37.000
That's one of the greatest goddamn shows ever.
Do you guys ever see that?

1488
01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:42.130
You have any idea how fucking huge it was when the $6 million man fought the $7

1489
01:32:42.130 --> 01:32:47.130
million man and he punched his fucking face off his face came off on television

1490
01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:54.550
in like 1974.
Do you have any fucking idea?
Think about that.
Pre Internet,

1491
01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:58.170
pre cable,
pre any sort of special effect.

1492
01:32:58.171 --> 01:33:01.450
If you look how bad the graphics were in Star Wars,
this is like three,

1493
01:33:01.451 --> 01:33:06.451
four years before that Lee Majors Punch this dude who was the fucking bad guy in

1494
01:33:08.201 --> 01:33:11.110
everything.
Oh Man.

1495
01:33:11.170 --> 01:33:13.300
Do you remember the one with a $6 million man fight up,

1496
01:33:13.301 --> 01:33:15.580
fought in the snow outside that mansion,

1497
01:33:15.581 --> 01:33:18.640
and they had everybody in slow motion and that black dude jumped like 10 feet in

1498
01:33:18.641 --> 01:33:21.750
the air was going to kick him.
He's going,
whoa.

1499
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:26.950
Flying through the fucking air or are you going to stand?

1500
01:33:26.951 --> 01:33:30.010
How sheltered I was as a kid,
I didn't even know who Bruce Lee was.

1501
01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:31.690
I don't even know what Kung Fu fighting was.

1502
01:33:31.691 --> 01:33:36.340
And I didn't realize that TV shows were ripping off,
you know,
uh,

1503
01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.330
enter the dragon and all that shit that people were flipping out about.

1504
01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:42.530
Cause I was just a little kid,
so I saw that shit.
I,

1505
01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.370
it was the most unbelievable thing ever.
He fought big foot.

1506
01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:50.230
He fought a black Bruce Lee and he fought the $7 million man and he punched his

1507
01:33:50.231 --> 01:33:54.490
fucking face off and they just don't,
they don't make,

1508
01:33:55.570 --> 01:33:59.320
it's impossible to compete now.
That's just,
they've just done too many things.

1509
01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:04.300
You know?
It's kind of like when you go to write a movie script and be like,
oh,

1510
01:34:04.301 --> 01:34:07.660
everything's been done and they act like all these guys back in the forties and

1511
01:34:07.661 --> 01:34:09.850
fifties were brilliant.
It's like,
fuck you.

1512
01:34:09.851 --> 01:34:11.770
There was only like five movies were ever made.

1513
01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.480
How hard was it to be brilliant back then?

1514
01:34:14.050 --> 01:34:17.950
It's like inventing shit and eat in the 18 hundreds oh look,

1515
01:34:17.951 --> 01:34:22.120
it's a coat hanger.
You can hang your coat on it.
Holy Shit.

1516
01:34:23.050 --> 01:34:24.670
Let's put his name in the history books.

1517
01:34:24.671 --> 01:34:27.100
Everyone can fucking remember this for the rest of the time.

1518
01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.530
I don't even know what you could event.
You always great.

1519
01:34:29.531 --> 01:34:33.580
It's still inventing a simple shit.
Is that Billy Mays guy?

1520
01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:37.960
You know that bear did fuck every night.
He just starts sobbing.
Billy Mays,

1521
01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:41.920
that dude,
he doesn't even event the shit.

1522
01:34:41.921 --> 01:34:45.330
I think he invented like three things and then he's just got a sweatshop but

1523
01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:49.720
like smart fucking kids from Thailand and he just comes walking in.

1524
01:34:49.721 --> 01:34:53.470
I keep burning myself on the iron,
come up with some shit.

1525
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:57.590
Then like three weeks later he's on TV.
I'm Billy Mays.

1526
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:02.960
<v 1>Are you tired of burn their hair off your forearm or your art and your button</v>

1527
01:35:02.961 --> 01:35:03.530
down?

1528
01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:08.180
Cause your third marriage didn't work out and you still have to date and your
50s

1529
01:35:10.230 --> 01:35:12.630
introducing the fucking thing.

1530
01:35:12.631 --> 01:35:17.190
You stick in front of the iron that doesn't burn your forearm but still irons

1531
01:35:17.191 --> 01:35:18.090
the fucking shirt.

1532
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:24.380
<v 6>Um,
anyways.
Oh,
let me get,
let me get back to this thing.
Sorry.
Huh.
See like that.</v>

1533
01:35:24.381 --> 01:35:27.110
There you go.
I wanted to stand up.
Mo gave you some fucking laughs.
Okay.

1534
01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:30.280
All right.
Hang over here.
Let me get,
let me get back to his house.

1535
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:31.720
He has a hangover it last week I did it.

1536
01:35:31.721 --> 01:35:36.721
I did a podcast where he had a hangover and somebody gave me some sort of uh,

1537
01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:38.721
uh,
Jesus.

1538
01:35:38.721 --> 01:35:41.510
Can you tell them stalling for time because I went to the wrong fucking place.

1539
01:35:41.570 --> 01:35:45.560
Advice.
I give that guy a horrible advice.
Um,

1540
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:49.580
all right.
Yeah,
I was kind of fucking hung over last week.

1541
01:35:49.581 --> 01:35:53.900
So I had somebody give me advice on how to cure a hangover and a,

1542
01:35:53.901 --> 01:35:57.620
this is what I got.
Here's a grace is a great hangover tip.

1543
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:59.540
Works for me most of the time.

1544
01:35:59.570 --> 01:36:04.430
Eat a greasy breakfast with all the coffee you can fucking stomach the morning

1545
01:36:04.431 --> 01:36:09.410
after drinking arrow.
I recommend waffle house or some other piece of shit diner.

1546
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:11.150
You know what?
Some people,
you know what?

1547
01:36:11.151 --> 01:36:12.620
I've always heard the greasy breakfast thing.

1548
01:36:12.621 --> 01:36:15.350
People actually had some other ones I had never heard of and I evidently I

1549
01:36:15.351 --> 01:36:19.180
didn't fucking,
I didn't save those.
Oh,
well.
Well,

1550
01:36:19.181 --> 01:36:20.680
we're going to end the podcast right here.

1551
01:36:20.681 --> 01:36:25.450
We're going to end with a revenge story.
All right?
Uh,
all right,
Bill.

1552
01:36:25.451 --> 01:36:28.480
Sometimes revenge comes when you least expect it.

1553
01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:31.600
I liked that this person started their revenge story with this.

1554
01:36:32.230 --> 01:36:35.260
That sounds like a great trailer for a,
for a summer blockbuster.

1555
01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:37.600
You know Tom Hanks,

1556
01:36:37.601 --> 01:36:41.740
Meg Ryan and some other Douche bag that you don't give a fuck star in the

1557
01:36:41.741 --> 01:36:46.300
revenge.
Sometimes you avenge comes when you least expect it.

1558
01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:47.981
All right.
My,

1559
01:36:47.981 --> 01:36:52.180
my older brother Jamie had always teased me about something since it had

1560
01:36:52.181 --> 01:36:53.860
happened when I was about 15,

1561
01:36:55.780 --> 01:37:00.010
but I can't tell you what it was because it will ruin the rest of the story.

1562
01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:05.180
But I had my day of revenge.
Fast forward toward,
uh,

1563
01:37:05.210 --> 01:37:06.290
fast forward eight years.

1564
01:37:06.291 --> 01:37:11.090
I was managing a rock band full time and my brother was about to move out to la

1565
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:14.720
to take a shot at acting.
So we had moved out of his apartment,

1566
01:37:14.721 --> 01:37:19.550
was temporary temporarily crashing up the street from my place at a mutual

1567
01:37:19.551 --> 01:37:20.390
friend's apartment.

1568
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:23.900
We all lived in these apartments in a small town in South Jersey.

1569
01:37:23.901 --> 01:37:25.430
Me and one of the guys from the band,

1570
01:37:25.431 --> 01:37:28.820
we're living in an apartment that was connected to a house,

1571
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:32.420
have a family we sort of grew up with.
They had a son,
Charlie,

1572
01:37:32.421 --> 01:37:36.410
who was our age but had down syndrome.
So we still lived at home.

1573
01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:41.480
Charlie would always seem to pop into our apartment at the worst times.
Uh,

1574
01:37:41.481 --> 01:37:41.751
you know,

1575
01:37:41.751 --> 01:37:45.500
in like the middle of parties when we were smoking pot or maybe when I was on

1576
01:37:45.501 --> 01:37:47.480
the couch with a girl trying to get laid,

1577
01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:52.160
he just had this timing where he would show up at the exactly the wrong time on

1578
01:37:52.161 --> 01:37:55.100
this particular Sunday afternoon,
I called my brother to let him know,

1579
01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:58.200
had ordered some pizzas and sandwiches and he could come over and have some,

1580
01:37:58.230 --> 01:38:02.990
have some,
if he wanted a,
we'd all been drinking heavily the night before,
uh,

1581
01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:05.560
as me and the band were out of town,
out of town on tour.

1582
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:10.350
My brother got perfectly blunted.
I think he was supposed to try to say,
uh,

1583
01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:14.090
the previous night and I knew [inaudible] he'd be,

1584
01:38:14.770 --> 01:38:17.800
<v 7>see,
this is what sucks about this small fucking font.</v>

1585
01:38:18.130 --> 01:38:21.820
Please write in bigger type guys or US going to put my face right up to the God

1586
01:38:21.821 --> 01:38:24.370
damn screen.
You guys are making me blind here.
All right.

1587
01:38:24.371 --> 01:38:28.540
My brother got fucked up the other night and I knew he'd be on our buddy's couch

1588
01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:31.450
just hating life.
But when I called him up,

1589
01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:35.170
he was being a bitch and asked if I could actually bring the fucking food over

1590
01:38:35.171 --> 01:38:37.690
to her.
Do you guys understand what's going on here?

1591
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:41.110
They're all hung over his brother or to some pizzas and out of the goodness of

1592
01:38:41.111 --> 01:38:44.260
his heart,
he calls his brother up to street and the fucking lazy cunt said,

1593
01:38:44.410 --> 01:38:49.000
can you,
can you bring it over so this,
so there's dude,
like a normal person says,

1594
01:38:49.001 --> 01:38:53.890
fuck no,
I bought the food.
I'm offering you some if you want it,
just come over.

1595
01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:58.120
But he couldn't get off the couch.
I'm Charlie,

1596
01:38:58.150 --> 01:39:02.410
the down syndrome kid who must've seen the pizza delivery guy knocked on our

1597
01:39:02.411 --> 01:39:04.770
door minutes later.
Uh,

1598
01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:07.600
my roommate Tom and I then thought of something fun to do.

1599
01:39:07.930 --> 01:39:11.800
Charlie actually really liked my brother.
They were always messing around.

1600
01:39:11.801 --> 01:39:14.410
But if you ever,
if you ever hung out with a kid with down syndrome,

1601
01:39:14.411 --> 01:39:18.340
that usually means he wants to fight or rep fight you a wrestle.

1602
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:21.640
This is reminding me of something about Mary.
Um,

1603
01:39:21.641 --> 01:39:24.790
since my brother was being such a lazy Turd and wouldn't come over,

1604
01:39:24.791 --> 01:39:28.720
we thought it would be funny to have Charlie delivered the pizza to Jamie since

1605
01:39:28.721 --> 01:39:30.730
we knew Charlie.
I guess Jamie's his brother,

1606
01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:32.593
<v 6>excuse me.</v>

1607
01:39:33.250 --> 01:39:35.310
<v 7>MMM.
Whatever.</v>

1608
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:38.510
Have Charlie delivered to Jamie since we knew Charlie would immediately want to

1609
01:39:38.511 --> 01:39:39.860
wrestle and fuck around with him.

1610
01:39:39.861 --> 01:39:43.100
Constant consequently would make his hangover much fucking worse.

1611
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:45.750
<v 6>So anyways,
I'm mutual friends with,</v>

1612
01:39:45.751 --> 01:39:48.870
with us and he had the key to the apartment where,

1613
01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:50.340
where my brother was staying on the couch.

1614
01:39:50.490 --> 01:39:55.490
We all walked over to the apartment and a down the hall to the Living Room where

1615
01:39:55.591 --> 01:39:59.670
my brother was on the couch with the back of the couch towards the door and the

1616
01:39:59.671 --> 01:40:03.630
TV facing us.
We immediately realized that my brother was watching a nasty,

1617
01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:09.020
nasty porno and was beating off Jesus Christ.

1618
01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:14.720
I started to say,
Hey,
here's your pizza.
Uh,

1619
01:40:14.890 --> 01:40:17.790
and then I was like,
oh,
no.
But,
uh,
Charlie,

1620
01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:22.970
Charlie burst passed me and my brothers stuck his head up over the back of the

1621
01:40:23.011 --> 01:40:24.540
couch before he knew it.

1622
01:40:25.230 --> 01:40:29.730
Charlie used all of his retard strength to give Jamie the haymaker of a lifetime

1623
01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:34.320
to the back of his head.
My brother was dazed and utterly confused.

1624
01:40:34.321 --> 01:40:39.150
He stood up and had an Oli and old half shirt from high school football and

1625
01:40:39.151 --> 01:40:41.790
white socks and oh yeah,
he had a raging hard on.

1626
01:40:42.090 --> 01:40:44.260
Now Charlie's coming at him fuego.

1627
01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:47.280
Now my brother is looking at us to stop Charlie,

1628
01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:50.670
but we're all laughing too hard and none of us were going to go anywhere near

1629
01:40:50.671 --> 01:40:54.220
that situation.
Uh,
Charlie.
Okay.
I mean,
would you,

1630
01:40:54.221 --> 01:40:59.050
would you break up a fight between a nearly naked guy with a boner and a kid

1631
01:40:59.051 --> 01:41:03.130
with down syndrome?
Where would you start?
Uh,
Charlie was not quitting.

1632
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:08.940
Blahblahblahblahblah and he's put in his best move was to punch your balls.

1633
01:41:08.970 --> 01:41:12.280
Jesus Christ.
Dude,
did this really happen?
This sounds fucking crazy.
Um,

1634
01:41:12.450 --> 01:41:14.590
he was coming to Jamie with everything.
He had a,

1635
01:41:14.610 --> 01:41:16.890
my brother was just trying to hold them off till is harder.

1636
01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.010
Hard on subsided and he could gather himself.
Meanwhile,

1637
01:41:20.011 --> 01:41:23.550
the TV is still on all loud and some nasty old fat chick was getting banged in

1638
01:41:23.551 --> 01:41:27.870
the ass by some black dude.
It was complete mayhem.
It all happened so fast.

1639
01:41:28.110 --> 01:41:32.250
Finally my brother pushed Charlie away far enough to grab his shorts and put

1640
01:41:32.251 --> 01:41:33.900
them on.
Charlie was really tired.

1641
01:41:34.110 --> 01:41:37.710
It was really fired up because we'd give him him giving him a big glass of Pepsi

1642
01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:42.480
beforehand and I was not supposed to have caffeine.
Well that's,

1643
01:41:42.481 --> 01:41:47.100
that's a great thing to do.
A Ba,
bup,
bup,
bup,
bup,
bup,
bup,
football.
Um,

1644
01:41:47.130 --> 01:41:50.490
anyways,
my brother would,
okay,
so this is basically the,
this is the thing.

1645
01:41:50.491 --> 01:41:52.770
He was talking about how when his brother used to tease him off,
he said,

1646
01:41:52.771 --> 01:41:53.101
my brother,

1647
01:41:53.101 --> 01:41:56.790
we always used to tease me about the time he caught me beat beating off when I

1648
01:41:56.791 --> 01:42:00.960
was 15.
He was like a true older brother,
uh,

1649
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:04.230
two older brother Dick about it and would bring it up in front of other girls,

1650
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:06.360
family and whoever,
and just kept,

1651
01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:10.440
just kept doing it for years after the time the retard beat him up while he was

1652
01:42:10.441 --> 01:42:13.770
whacking off.
He never mentioned it again.
Cheers.

1653
01:42:14.730 --> 01:42:17.280
Jesus Christ.
Who did that?
Did that all really happened?

1654
01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:21.360
I'm sorry about saying retard too.
I never say that shit.

1655
01:42:21.361 --> 01:42:24.690
He just had written that I tried to say fucking down syndrome as much as I
could.

1656
01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:29.280
There you go.
You found a line.
I usually don't say that shit.
Um,
anyway,

1657
01:42:29.281 --> 01:42:32.220
so that's the podcast for the week.
I know it was pretty fucking a,

1658
01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:35.100
it's pretty fucked up.
You know,

1659
01:42:35.310 --> 01:42:38.580
you got a 19 minute one and you've got a 35 minute once.
What does that make?

1660
01:42:38.581 --> 01:42:42.930
That makes was,
that's like almost 55 fucking minutes.
Um,

1661
01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:47.460
I'm going to be at the Improv here in Los Angeles in May.

1662
01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:51.240
I don't know what weekend yet.
I believe it's the weekend of May 20 something.

1663
01:42:51.810 --> 01:42:56.400
And uh,
other than that we're going to be filling in some standup dates.
Um,

1664
01:42:56.430 --> 01:43:00.420
and that's it.
Thank you guys for listening to the Monday morning podcast.

1665
01:43:00.421 --> 01:43:04.170
Please keep the questions coming and coming and I apologize I was a little bit

1666
01:43:04.171 --> 01:43:08.330
jet lag.
That's two fucking weeks in a row,
you know,
hungover last week,

1667
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:11.090
jet lag this week.
But you know,
what the fuck do you want from me?

1668
01:43:11.091 --> 01:43:14.090
It's called the Monday morning podcast and I have to do it on this day,
so,

1669
01:43:14.450 --> 01:43:17.660
so there you go.
I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll talk to you next week.

1670
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:19.060
<v 4>All right.
Do you next week?</v>

1671
01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:30.680
