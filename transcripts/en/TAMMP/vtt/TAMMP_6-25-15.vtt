1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.913
Okay.

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.460
<v 1>Hey,

3
00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:07.840

How's it going?
How's your week going?</v>

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.310
Are you having a bad one?
What's the matter?
Huh?

8
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.330
Did they switch out the water bubbler?
Did they bring in a different one?

9
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:33.380
I think the water tasted better.
You know,
I like all waters.

10
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.970
I don't like Disani is those call and I don't like Evia Mel.

11
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.200
It tastes weird amount.
All those models on Dave.

12
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.890
A salary swear by it.
I think it takes awareness.
Um,

13
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.150
all right.
I am in the middle of,
I'm this fucking name was tour,

14
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.550

Nick,

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.320
if I do say so myself,
we uh,

16
00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.380
I'm doing this on a bump sitting on the fucking bus cause the goddamn room isn't

17
00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:01.940
ready.
I just got shut down,
right?

18
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.720
I came in fucking trying to walk in like I was some sort of big shot,

19
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.360
like I could check in at one 30 and they were like,
I'm sorry sir.

20
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.070
Checking is it three?
Go Fuck Yourself.
And I was like,
but wait a minute,

21
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.860
I'm the dancing clown at the casino tonight.

22
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.480
I was hoping I could bring in my unicycle a little bit early,
sir.

23
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.800
Get the fuck out of our hotel.
We don't want to see you until three o'clock.

24
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:26.690
And I was like,
oh,
okay.

25
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.350
I need to get some sort of Reuben Kincade some sort of,

26
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:31.640
I don't want to fucking tour manager.

27
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.800
It's just somebody else you have to talk to,
you know,
deal with this shit.

28
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:41.600
Why is he engine getting louder?
That'll fuck.
Can you hear it?

29
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.080
It's going,
it's going to be this hum in the background.

30
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:47.480
You didn't have to fucking deal with that.
I don't,
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,

31
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.950
so me and Joe Barton,
nick where um,

33
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.840
San something or rather the wine country.

34
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.950
Then we did San Jose and then we did Fresno and last night we did a Bakersfield

35
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.150
and a Joe Barden.
Nick left today on the tour.

36
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:13.220
He's a had to go to the airport.

37
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:15.590
He's flying to Pittsburgh cause him and Paul Versey is,

38
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.480
or doing an all in date in Pittsburgh,
which is why Joe is flying to Pittsburgh.

39
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:25.430
So if you guys are around,
it's the DV comedy festival.
Um,

40
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.460
some of my great friends in this business or at that radio station,

41
00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:33.320
they did a lot for me over the years.
Uh,
Randy Bauman and all those guys.
Um,

42
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.880
and,
uh,
the fuck am I talking about?
He had to go check out this show.

43
00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:40.310
If you get a chance,
sorry,
this humming in the background.

44
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.360
He's fucking driving me up the wall here.
So anyways,

45
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.290
I forgot to tell you guys this story last week.
So we're in Rito,

46
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.210
right fucking Reno.
And uh,
I told you,
I,
everybody knows a bunch of drunks.

47
00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:56.300
There are a lot of drunks or whatever mixed in with a bunch of great people and

48
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:59.940
a,
so afterwards I'm whoring myself out,
right?

49
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.560
I'm whoring myself out,
I'm fucking signing the posters,
shaking hands,

50
00:03:04.561 --> 00:03:09.100
kissing babies,
doing all that shit.
And this fucking dude reaches in.
He goes,

51
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:12.210
is it okay if I get a picture?
And it's just like,
yes,
I just fucking,

52
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.410
I'm taking them with everybody.
What I want.
Just going to say you can't have one.

53
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.380
Maybe it's just being polite,
but you know,
just get on with it.

54
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.220
You already know the cell phone's going to take for fucking ever.

55
00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:24.930
I really missed disposable cameras.

56
00:03:24.931 --> 00:03:29.820
That was just a little crank and then point shoot and it was done.
You know,

57
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.850
you press the fucking photo on the cell phone thing.
It takes like,
you know,

58
00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:36.840
like nine hours and then also,
then they look at it,
they go,
hey,
get up blurry.

59
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.430
Let me do it again.
Now that isn't right.
Like can we also take landscape?

60
00:03:41.431 --> 00:03:42.690
Do you mind if I was taking a selfie?

61
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.000
Can I take one with this pant fucking camera?

62
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.300
Even though I just got one with the other camera and I have the technology to

63
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:50.640
send it to that other camera,
can I do it with that camera?

64
00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:54.300
So I'm dealing with all of that shit.
So this fucking guy comes up and he's like,

65
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.760
can I get a picture?
And I say,
yeah,
obviously,
you know,
I'm a fucking horse.

66
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.400
You can do whatever you want
or myself out here.

67
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.970
So he reaches into his fucking jacket and all of a sudden,

68
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.600
just this fucking sound of metal and plastic of fucking nine millimeter that he

69
00:04:12.121 --> 00:04:14.220
had on him drops down onto the ground.

70
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.570
The security guy is like two feet awaits facing the guy who just dropped the

71
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:21.391
gun,

72
00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:26.391
but he's on his iPhone texting or selecting something and the guy I just go,

73
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.490
I go,
dude,
what the fuck?
And he's like,
Oh shit.
Right.
We both said the same thing.

74
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.310
They both said both have that same time.
He picks it up and I'm like,
dude,

75
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.430
do you have a license to carry that thing?
And he goes,
yeah,
yeah,

76
00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:42.180
I'm in law enforcement.
And uh,
I was like,
all right,

77
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:47.050
and then you just sort of walked out and then I say to the security guy,
go,
I go,

78
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:50.750
dude,
did you just see that?
And he goes,
what?
I said,

79
00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:55.040
that guy just fucking dropped a nine millimeter on the ground right in front of

80
00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:56.090
you,
reaching to get his camera.

81
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.960
Just fell right down on the ground and the security guy goes up.
She's lucky.

82
00:04:59.961 --> 00:05:04.100
I didn't see that.
Swear to God,

83
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.280
it was like a line from his set cup.
Oh,
he's lucky.
I didn't see that.

84
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:13.720
It's like toad,
it almost landed on your fucking foot.
You know,

85
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.630
you get so zoned out by these smart phones.

86
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.080
And then I'm thinking about myself like,
wait a minute,
Bill,
this guy,

87
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.650
you don't know him from Adam.
He reaches into his coat and dropped the gun.

88
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.140
How do you know he did?
It wasn't a reached in to point it at you.

89
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.040
You should have kicked it,
tipped him over and fucking as he bent down,

90
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:34.450
push them over and then picked it up or ran instead of being like,
Oh,

91
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:37.120
do you have a license for that?
Like I'm some sort of authority.

92
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.170
So it was just so rest of the night,
just go on like what a fucking moron I am.

93
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.150
And um,
this cop later told me,
he goes,
no,

94
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:48.520
you actually did the right thing.
You know,
he stayed calm,
you blah blah,
blah,

95
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:51.960
blah.
It's just like,
yeah,
I did the right thing cause staying calm.

96
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.290
And he did and he wasn't a psycho.
I Dunno,
whatever.

97
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.760
Uh,
now,
now I have to learn how to fucking do that.
What to do if,
if,

98
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.450
if somebody is nine millimeter falls in the fucking ground.
Bottom line is,

99
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:06.440
even though he was a cop,

100
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:09.410
he wasn't allowed to bring that in there on the casino property.

101
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:14.060
Cause I think it was a,
uh,
owned by a native Americans or something.

102
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:16.520
Maybe that's why I have no idea.
But he wasn't allowed to bring it in there.

103
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:20.780
So they,
uh,
they chased him down.
Um,
and that was,

104
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:25.340
that's my reno story or Bud,
my fucking radio story.

105
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.560
Janet Reno.
Um,
so anyways,

106
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.360
so bart,
nick left fucking blows a,
but lie had comes in.

107
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.130
So basically,
uh,
you know,
[inaudible] pitch in like six and two thirds,

108
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.390
you know,
we got a to run lady just walked a runner and a,
we went to the bullpen.

109
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.430
We're bringing in law ahead,
right?
He's got his relief pitcher bid and uh,

110
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.380
he's coming in and he's going to be finished in this out.
So,
uh,

111
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:55.580
the lovely Nia is riding along with me out to Vegas,

112
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:58.700
so we're having a good time.
Um,
it was funny,
man.
I do.

113
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:03.500
We just picked her up because we were coming back from uh,
you know,
Bakersfield,

114
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.460
which what a fucking great town that is and selves.
Fresno.
By the way,

115
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.380
Fresno is a great town.
That all those,

116
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.010
those goddamn shows had me so freaking out about Fresno.

117
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.560
They never talk anything good about Fresno.

118
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:20.480
But anytime you watch a first 48 or something about gangs are going to prison or

119
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:21.314
some shit,

120
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.250
you can't watch any of those for more than three minutes before they bring up

121
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:27.260
bring up Fresno,
you know,
always like Fresno,

122
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:32.261
California picking apples is usually a fun thing for the family but not in

123
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:34.310
Fresno.
Right.

124
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.270
And then they cut to some gang banger who's got like a Bandana on his head and

125
00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:41.560
went over and I can see his eyes and they got his voice all muffled.

126
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.670
NEWCO forward.
We couldn't unhelpable dollar pool both to clear up.

127
00:07:46.671 --> 00:07:50.730
And your lawyers are Bourbon.
Woodford usual

128
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.600
our lock Ross to putting a blown up too soon.
But the Dome

129
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.930
fucking full flow for fucking that.

130
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:06.470
The whole God damn thing is that.
And I would say what I feel about that,

131
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:08.360
but I don't need the fucking problems

132
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.520
anyways.
Anytime they show those gang bangers,
it's like,

133
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:20.210
do they ever have a good day?
Then ice cube write a song.
You know,

134
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.470
I had a good day,
I didn't even have to use my eight k,
you know,

135
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.960
Jesus Christ,
they're always fucking,
I mean,
you know,

136
00:08:29.961 --> 00:08:32.270
I saw a thing one time where they said,
you know there's,

137
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.610
there's people in gangs in Los Angeles,

138
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.080
they're like three miles from the ocean and they never seen it because they

139
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:40.430
can't get out of the neighborhoods.

140
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:45.430
Like cause they got to go to some other gangs territory and the risk is too

141
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:49.850
high.
It's like dude,
just fucking drive through it.

142
00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:54.560
Like eight in the morning,
nine in the morning,
everybody's asleep,
right.

143
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.590
You swung your fucking crack all night.

144
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.990
You know your banged a woman,
you fucking,
you know,

145
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:08.910
you gave you a bull bathy you're going to bed a couple of forties and a blunt

146
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:12.420
that's,
you're not up at eight 30 you drive through.

147
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.020
That's the time when the,
the decent people are getting up,

148
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.460
who are trying to get out of that fucking area.
It's at night.
You know,

149
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:21.990
when the second shift comes in,

150
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.230
those guys who he ended up seeing on those fucking channels,

151
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.990
your order three miles from the beach,

152
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:31.330
I'd never seen that shit that's even more distorted.

153
00:09:31.331 --> 00:09:35.370
Her nerve or the Boudreaux,
no restraint.
That's more Batman.

154
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.860
I Dunno what the fuck it is.
That was having fun with that.

155
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:42.360
But then I go to Fresno,
right.
We're all,
I think it's just going to be pitfalls,

156
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.920
neck tattoos and I am going to get fucking just jumped,
you know?

157
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.400
And I went there and I ended up going to a Chili's restaurant.

158
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:54.660
I had a very nice waitress who actually had a quote from Walt Disney tattooed on

159
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:58.980
her arm,
you know,
don't be afraid to dream something,

160
00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:01.290
something and probably something to antisemetic about the Jews.

161
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:06.000
She probably left that out.
And then it was Walt Disney,
right.
And then,
uh,

162
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.830
I ordered a Fisa,

163
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:12.600
mango chicken with some steamed Broccoli and rice and there was no incident.

164
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.620
You know,
I wasn't in there going,
wow,
this is comfortable.

165
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:20.340
And then a whole motorcycle gang came up.
Although,
you know,
it was funny,

166
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:24.330
it was during the show they had this sign like I actually when we were in Reno

167
00:10:24.331 --> 00:10:28.130
we took a picture of that iconic sign in Reno that says the,
you know,

168
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.570
the biggest little town in America or something like that.

169
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:35.340
So Fresno has assigned like that too.
And uh,

170
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.610
I wanted to get a picture underneath that one.
Bakersfield has one.

171
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.810
These are like all old school towns before they built the five freeway that went

172
00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:46.620
by all of that.
Like he had like,
you know,
you,
when he drove into a new town,

173
00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:48.930
they had the name of the town.
They were all proud of it and shed.

174
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.960
I think it's really cool.
That's part of that,
you know,

175
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.770
just that shit that doesn't exist anymore.
Like if I was mayor of a town,

176
00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:58.890
I would commission,
we've got to raise money.
We got to have one of those sites.

177
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.940
You know what I mean?
Some cute little quaint fucking welcome to this town.

178
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.870
Especially if people just drive through like farm,
you know,

179
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.380
all farming land and all of a sudden you come into town,

180
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:14.700
it's exciting when you see it.
It's really fucking cool.
Um,
for me anyways,

181
00:11:14.701 --> 00:11:19.450
but I'm a fucking nerd.
So we got,
I'm on stage saying,
yeah,
me and Barden again,

182
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.860
when we got a picture that Reno sign and we want this,
this,
the Fresno show,

183
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:23.641
I'm like,
yeah,
you know,

184
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:27.120
we want to go down there and get a picture underneath whatever the Fresno

185
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:30.690
science says,
it's somebody in the crowd,
like 40 rows back,
just goes,

186
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.820
do not go down there.

187
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.060
And people only kind of laughed.
And I was like,
Jesus Christ,
he said it like,

188
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.060
like he was my dad,
you know,

189
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.930
and that was like his gun safe.
Do not go in,
you know,

190
00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:53.360
don't waive this fucking thing around.
So there is obviously some truth it,

191
00:11:53.361 --> 00:11:57.770
but uh,
you know,
where I was staying in Fresno,
it was really nice.

192
00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.990
And,
uh,
I played this amazing theater.
Of course,

193
00:12:02.991 --> 00:12:05.450
I wouldn't forget the name of the fucking thing I keep because it sounded too

194
00:12:05.451 --> 00:12:06.950
close to like the Warner theater,

195
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.310
which all of them were called either that or the pantageous.

196
00:12:10.311 --> 00:12:15.200
It used to be called a pantageous,
the pantageous theater.
And uh,

197
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.990
back in the day before there was the five,
it was,

198
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.700
they would do a bunch of movie premiers there.
So,
um,

199
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:23.960
<v 0>okay.</v>

200
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.380
<v 1>You know,
they,
everybody from like John Wayne,
Humphry Bogart,</v>

201
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.740
all of these people had gone there for movie.

202
00:12:30.741 --> 00:12:34.490
It was a Vaudeville theater and then it turned into a movie house.

203
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:35.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

204
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.250
<v 1>Which is what all of these theaters,
like these older ones that you play,</v>

205
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:43.030
that's like their history was a Vaudeville theater and then it became a movie

206
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:46.090
house.
And then somewhere in the sixties and seventies,

207
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.840
if it doesn't become a rock venue,
it becomes like a porno house.

208
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.830
And then there was discussion to tear it down and then somebody rich or somebody

209
00:12:56.261 --> 00:13:00.250
gives a fuck about old stuff,
raises money to,
um,

210
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.650
you know,
uh,
refurbish the thing.
So this thing didn't become a or house.

211
00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:08.740
So it became a rock house in which I found,
which was really cool,

212
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.990
was ACDC with bond.
Scott had played there and uh,

213
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.140
the owner was really cool and,
uh,
he offered to give us a,
like this,

214
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:21.430
this whole tour of it.
Of course,
I didn't have fucking time to do it.
Um,

215
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:26.670
but they had this amazing organ there that was between the crowd and the,

216
00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:29.170
uh,
the people,
I guess they were going to tear it down or something.

217
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:31.750
Somebody bought it just because they wanted the organ or something like that.

218
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:35.610
I don't know.
It's a bunch of crazy stories in there.
But,
um,
so anyways,

219
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.900
downstairs,
everybody,

220
00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.140
all those old school movie stars had signed the wall.

221
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.610
Oh,
the Warners theater.
W A r n o r s work performed.

222
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.410
And John Wayne,

223
00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:53.411
how people got all of these old school stars had signed this wall throughout the

224
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.600
years.
It was priceless.
So when this guy who I have a deadly,

225
00:13:56.601 --> 00:14:00.830
who bought the theater because he just wanted the Oregon or Oregon or something

226
00:14:00.831 --> 00:14:04.940
like that,
like he wanted to fix the place up,
you know,

227
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:09.230
you know where the story's going,
right?
So he wants to get the place painted.

228
00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:14.060
Any hires like a fucking relative to do it on the cheap and the guy or the lady,

229
00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:17.630
whatever went down there,
it was a guy who's kidding,
who it was a fucking guy.

230
00:14:17.631 --> 00:14:18.411
He goes down,

231
00:14:18.411 --> 00:14:21.560
this is seventies were more even a lot out of the house at that point,
right?

232
00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.760
So he fucking goes down there and he paints over the whole fucking thing.

233
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:31.370
So the guy showed me,
he goes behind this wall is,
uh,

234
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.250
is all,
is all the signatures,
and they're trying to figure out a way,
you know,

235
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:38.390
oh,

236
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:43.250
someone's like paint archeology to strip off that layer of paint and get down to

237
00:14:43.251 --> 00:14:48.230
the signatures because they are underneath there.
And uh,
you know,

238
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:52.220
I'm totally into that shit.
So I told the guys,
hey,
you ever want to do a benefit?

239
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.240
You know,

240
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.750
I'll donate some money and I'll come up and do a show or something because,
uh,

241
00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.120
I think that's cool as shit.
You know,
like there's a,

242
00:15:00.121 --> 00:15:03.180
there's a house and the next town over,
um,

243
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.060
from where I live in somebody's during prohibition,

244
00:15:08.061 --> 00:15:10.940
this old house had built this in the,

245
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:15.350
in the Cabana by the pool had just built a bar and I guess that person was

246
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:19.070
famous so they knew all these famous people and eat album all carved their names

247
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:22.550
into the bar and it still exists and it's like a historical thing.

248
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:27.380
So if you buy the house,
um,
you're not allowed to do anything to the bar.
I mean,

249
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:31.010
you can use the bar,
but you can't,
uh,
you know,
remove it,

250
00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:33.890
destroyed or anything like that.
But like they did,
they have everybody,

251
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.120
like everybody from like Louis Armstrong to a James Cagney and all that,

252
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.210
fucking anybody who drank back then carved our names into the bar.

253
00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:43.790
So I liked that shit.
You might think I'm a nerd,

254
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.830
do think I'm a Douche bag.
Uh,
but I'm into all of that type of shit.
You know,

255
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:53.840
I am,
I'm weird.
I like fucking old cars,
man.
And I want to get that Ford Galaxy.

256
00:15:53.841 --> 00:15:58.190
I'm going to do that bucket right?
The fuck else am I going to do?

257
00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:03.800
Um,
so anyways,
old freckles here,

258
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.830
me and Barton,
it killed it both onstage and off.

259
00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:11.831
We went to the gym like every day I go to the gym every day it's just become pop

260
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:16.220
me life.
And if you don't,
well wait,

261
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.640
we really mean it.
Um,

262
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:26.380
I had done an hour of cardio every fucking day for the last seven days,

263
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.840
the last seven days.
Um,
and switching it up sometimes the ellipticals,

264
00:16:31.841 --> 00:16:36.500
sometimes the fuck in a treadmill.
But I've been doing that.

265
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:40.430
I've been doing my pullups been doing my pushups and a old fatty cake.

266
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.250
Fatty cakes here is,
uh,
starting to come off,
man.

267
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.420
I got fucked up last year when I was in the writer's room doing the F is for

268
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:51.840
family,
which is coming out in December as he plugs away here.
Um,
I just got it,

269
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.580
you know,
I got into that and he's starting to write.

270
00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:55.970
And when you sit in a writer's room all day,

271
00:16:55.971 --> 00:16:58.130
there's nothing more exciting than fucking lunch.

272
00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:02.390
You'd be on fucking excited other than the fact when you figure out how to make

273
00:17:02.391 --> 00:17:06.680
the story work.
The only thing,
second to that is lunch and it's a very,
you know,

274
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.140
it's a photo finish and a,
you know,

275
00:17:09.141 --> 00:17:13.340
I started off eating healthy and the next thing you know we had Frito Fridays

276
00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:16.350
and then you know,
you know you're in a writer's room.

277
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:17.860
He started eating like a fucking truck driver.

278
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.640
So I put on that weight and that was October,
November,

279
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.030
and then the holidays came around and then the Rose Ball.

280
00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.780
So that was completely fucked.
And then I,
then I stopped.
I was like,
Oh,

281
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.100
I'm going to work out,
I'm going to work out.

282
00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:35.150
When I started singing the gym song and then I did the Australia fucking Asia

283
00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:39.500
thing and of course I got to try every beer and fucking vegemite sandwich and

284
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:43.370
dumplings and all of that shit.
When I'm over there,
then I go to New York,

285
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:47.690
I run into [inaudible],
it's fucking over and it just,
it kept snowballing.

286
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.300
And then I started back up again march and I've just,
I've fucking had it,

287
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.220
went out of my voice in fucking had it,
man.
I've had it with myself.

288
00:17:56.221 --> 00:17:58.170
I'm so fucking,
I was getting into the point

289
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.380
where when I sat down to put on my socks and my shoes,

290
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:08.520
my stomach was starting to be an ae.
I was noticing it,

291
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.280
you know,
and I was making those,
I'm putting socks on and I,
I'm,

292
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.610
I'm fucking in my first trimester noises.
You noticed.

293
00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.860
Let's just like getting it over your toes.
I was just like,
really?

294
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:24.990
I'm going to be the breathing grunt and Groan a person.

295
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:29.610
I can't fucking have this.
So,
uh,
I dunno.

296
00:18:29.611 --> 00:18:31.320
I was actually,
this is the first time I've ever done one of these,

297
00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:34.080
these busts things with,
with Bartek and I was just like,
oh my God,

298
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.840
us to fucking animals on this thing.
Like what is going to happen?

299
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:39.250
We're going to come back like 20 pounds overweight.
And uh,

300
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.570
Bart Nick was coolest shit.
He's always cool as shit and he was just sliding.

301
00:18:43.571 --> 00:18:45.930
And I was like,
hey man,
I'm going to go.
And I told him the first day,
I said,

302
00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:48.390
I went to the gym.
He goes,
oh yeah.
He goes,
I'll go with you tomorrow.

303
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.300
Then that was it.
And that became our routine.
We'd pull in,

304
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.540
we check in and be like,
God,
we're going downstairs and we'll be there.

305
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.390
I'm each you there in 15 minutes.
And uh,

306
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.750
it's just been fucking great.
So now I don't want to stop.

307
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.380
And that's what I was planning on doing when I went into the fucking hotel.

308
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.850
The lady wouldn't let,
she gave me the Heisman.
She gave me the fucking Heisman.

309
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.460
No,
no,
you can't check in.
Is that what you wanted to do?

310
00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:12.750
What is it that you wanted to do?

311
00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:16.350
Because I'm about ready to tell you that you can't do it.
What I'm going to say,

312
00:19:16.351 --> 00:19:20.280
it's their fucking hotel.
So their rules just thought they'd be cool man.

313
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:26.070
Um,
so anyways,
last night was,
uh,

314
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.810
was Bakersfield,
which was really fucking cool man and played this great.

315
00:19:30.811 --> 00:19:31.350
Another quick,

316
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:36.350
all these have just been these cool ass old theaters and I'm considering they've

317
00:19:36.931 --> 00:19:40.050
told,
tore down most of the old ballparks at the pro level.

318
00:19:40.051 --> 00:19:45.030
I think just about all of them other than Fenway in Wrigley.
I think that's it.

319
00:19:45.031 --> 00:19:47.340
They're pretty much all gone.
And,
uh,

320
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:51.600
these old theaters kind of fill that void for me.
And um,

321
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.860
I had a great time last night with the crowd and it's cool,
man.

322
00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:57.450
That's like a two hour drive away from me.

323
00:19:57.451 --> 00:20:01.410
It's as cool theater that I can go up and go play.
And uh,
you know,

324
00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:05.580
if I ever want to work out some shit for a special,
I can just jump in a car,

325
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.320
right?
Jump in my truck.
When I get that back,

326
00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:11.190
when I get the fucking AC finally put in,
um,
crews up there be,

327
00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:12.930
there'll be the shit.
But um,

328
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.760
apologies to some people who weren't able to make it to the show.
There was a,
uh,

329
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.020
there was a fire along the five freeway and it was in danger of jumping the

330
00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:26.250
freeway and a,
for those of you who don't live out in this fucking hell hole,

331
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.900
basically what happens is the flames get so high and the wind is whipping around

332
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.110
and the uh,
you know,
all the,
what do you call that shit?

333
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.640
What do you call not ash?
Ambers,
whatever you call it,

334
00:20:38.641 --> 00:20:42.480
they get blown across the highway and then they just light up the other side and

335
00:20:42.481 --> 00:20:43.670
then you've got two sides are on fire.

336
00:20:43.671 --> 00:20:48.160
I've actually driven down the highway and just watch it at an out of control

337
00:20:48.161 --> 00:20:49.810
blaze.
But uh,

338
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:54.390
it's completely normal out here unless this was started by,
you know,

339
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.380
somebody throwing a cigarette butt out.
I have no idea.

340
00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:59.860
But some people were coming up from la or from the other side of the mountains

341
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:00.950
there to,
uh,

342
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:05.470
to see the show and they weren't able to do it because there was a fire jumping

343
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:06.304
the highway.

344
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.350
Uh,
those are the times I asked myself,
why the fuck did I move out here?

345
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:18.580
I left the lush east coast trees,

346
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:22.900
lakes,
you know,
four seasons sort of with global warming now,

347
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.020
whatever the heating up the earth,
whatever the fuck you want to call it,

348
00:21:26.021 --> 00:21:30.550
however it's happening,
relaxed Democrats and Republicans,
you fucking lunatics.

349
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.090
Um,
whatever it is,

350
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:39.091
it just kind of goes from like freezing cold to fucking hot as balls now.

351
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:42.130
There's really no spring and fall,
which kind of sucks.

352
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:46.990
It's like a week of it now.
Um,
so anyways,
let me do a little bit of a read here.

353
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.270
I'm going to try a little read,
you know.
Okay.
Uh,
hey,
you like making money?
Oh,

354
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:57.030
this is Uber.
Oh by the way,
[inaudible] Patty,
uh,

355
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.570
Patty,
uh,

356
00:21:58.571 --> 00:22:03.571
the taxi drivers have had it with fucking Uber and they pose that they did like

357
00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:09.700
this demonstration fucking hardcore like blocking the highways,

358
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.350
lighting tires on fire and shit.
Cause the sick of the Uber guys,
uh,

359
00:22:14.351 --> 00:22:18.000
taken all of their work.
So,
um,
I dunno,

360
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:22.630
man for civilized is a Paris and Fred's is,

361
00:22:22.631 --> 00:22:24.130
they definitely have a lot of that shit.

362
00:22:24.131 --> 00:22:28.270
Like they have a lot of like American type shit going on.
You know,

363
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.850
it's unfortunate.
But anyways,

364
00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:33.190
I'm glad that Shit didn't happen when we were over there.
My French,

365
00:22:33.191 --> 00:22:34.450
I'm already starting to lose it.

366
00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:39.370
So I went on dual lingo today and just did a couple of exercises.

367
00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:41.740
Man.
I hope I don't fucking lose what I found that I had shut up bill.

368
00:22:41.741 --> 00:22:46.000
Just read it.
Okay.
Uber,
everybody.
Hey,
you like making money,

369
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.590
right?

370
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:51.640
Here's a really cool opportunity that evidently I have to share with you.

371
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.500
Driving with Uber.

372
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.240
Uber's that populace smartphone APP that connects riders with drivers.

373
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.590
Um,
well this is all the lies here.
I take Uber a bunch.
No I don't.

374
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:04.330
I love them by the way.
I do love him.

375
00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.570
I just don't have them on my phone cause I don't want some fucking,
I don't know,

376
00:23:07.571 --> 00:23:10.330
something no on my fucking phone number and where I live,

377
00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.420
I like the taxi drivers,
you know?
Oh my God,
it's loud.
Okay.
You know,

378
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.790
sticking your head out the window cause they've been driving for 16 hours.

379
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.770
But you guys love him and you like chatting with the different drivers.

380
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.970
Some of them have really interesting stories as to why they drive Uber.

381
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.080
Yeah.
Going through a fucking divorce.
They love being their own boss.

382
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.170
They earn great money.
It's easy to start a,

383
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:38.530
you just stop fucking doing that stupid ass phone.

384
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.610
I'm sorry I'm reading this on the phone here.
Um,
it's easy to start.

385
00:23:42.611 --> 00:23:44.620
You just need a car or a license.

386
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:48.260
Driving with Uber is great for anyone who needs flexibility.
Parents,

387
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:51.710
this is a really way,
easy way to work around your family.
Schedule.

388
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.780
Unhappy married people.
This is a great way to avoid your partner.
All right.

389
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:59.390
If you're making way more money than they are and they're going to take you for

390
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:02.480
everything you got,
maybe you can ride it out with any luck.

391
00:24:02.481 --> 00:24:04.910
They'll die of natural causes.
Students,

392
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:06.950
you could make extra money between classes.

393
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.330
Now's the prime time to cash in with Uber.
No more stripping.
Ladies,

394
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.750
you'll thank me for telling you how to get paid every week.

395
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.540
I could be getting into your car when you drive Uber.

396
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.400
I won't remember it cause I'll be handed a call to action.

397
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:24.800
You got a car and a license,

398
00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:28.070
put them both to work and you can start earning serious life changing money

399
00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:29.840
today.
Sign up to drive with Uber.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:34.870

401
00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:40.270
Um,

402
00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.270
[inaudible] dot com sorry.
That is a great way to earn money.

403
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.133
You know what I mean?

404
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.980
I wonder if you can make enough money just to be a fulltime fucking Uber driver

405
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.250
and he just quit your job.
You job sucks.
Just drive around.

406
00:24:51.251 --> 00:24:54.730
Poor bastards who got to go to work.
You know I used to be,

407
00:24:54.731 --> 00:24:59.230
you know,
I'm living the good life is,
you know,

408
00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:01.510
you could turn your fucking meter on whenever you want.

409
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.550
That's what I like about it.

410
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.810
Like what did you forget your wallet and you want to get a fucking cheese

411
00:25:07.811 --> 00:25:10.030
sandwich?
She just got a fucking,
I'm available.

412
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.170
You know you drive somebody around once you have enough for a cheese sandwich.

413
00:25:14.171 --> 00:25:17.620
She kicked him out.
But I thought you were going to take me in the hallway.

414
00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:22.690
Faded Lady.
All right,
blue apron.
It's okay.
You can admit it.

415
00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.590
The last thing anyone wants to do after work is wait in line at the grocery

416
00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:31.570
store,
Schlep home and cook a complicated meal and and expensive.

417
00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:34.390
Unhealthy takeout is hardly better.

418
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:35.860
<v 0>Okay?</v>

419
00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.020
<v 1>That's where the new service blue apron comes in.</v>

420
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.860
You know I got a bone to pick with unhealthy takeout is fucking cheap.

421
00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:45.220
That's why you go buy it right?
But it's bad for you.
It's expensive in the end,

422
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.190
right when they got to remove your fucking gallbladder.

423
00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:53.170
A blue apron delivers farm fresh ingredients and step by step recipes to your

424
00:25:53.171 --> 00:25:54.820
home,
allowing you to create healthy,

425
00:25:54.821 --> 00:25:58.870
handcrafted meals at home without going to the grocery store.
That's pretty cool.

426
00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.700
For less than $10 per meal.
What are they sending you?

427

I was already calling easy meals.

430
00:26:16.531 --> 00:26:21.300
Really easy and fun that no chips to the grocery store and no ways from unused

431
00:26:21.301 --> 00:26:21.811
ingredients.

432
00:26:21.811 --> 00:26:25.710
Plus you learn to cook with special specialty ingredients that normally are hard

433
00:26:25.711 --> 00:26:27.840
to find.
Seems like a great way to lose weight.
To me,

434
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.950
blue apron is perfect for date night cooking with friends and they even offer

435

436
00:26:35.731 --> 00:26:37.260
have fun preparing the meals together.

437
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.910
Each balanced meal is 500 700 calories per serving and so tasty.

438
00:26:41.911 --> 00:26:44.140
You'd never know.
Cooking takes half an hour.

439
00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.800
Shipping is flexible and free and the menus are always knew they won't send the

440
00:26:47.801 --> 00:26:51.490
same meal twice through.
This is fucking great.
It's a great way to lose weight.

441
00:26:51.491 --> 00:26:52.480
Then you get to eat this shit.

442
00:26:52.481 --> 00:26:54.400
Then you just crush waters for the rest of the night.

443
00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:57.340
You go to bed a little hungry for their first night and then you're good and

444
00:26:57.341 --> 00:26:58.510
you're in.

456
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:45.410
I just got sick of it after a while.
It's too smoky.

465
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:14.690
I do a half hour on these fuckers.
Uh Oh,
Tom Brady's got his big

466
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.290
appeal this week.
I think it's a mistake.

467
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:22.100
I think he shouldn't have said Shit and he would have been the martyr and people

468
00:28:22.101 --> 00:28:23.420
would like them.
Um,

469
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.540
and anybody who has sympathy for him who isn't a patriots fan,

470
00:28:26.541 --> 00:28:27.770
I think after the appeal,

471
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:33.170
especially if he wins and they knock off a couple of games,
it's a,

472
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.810
you know,
but you know what the other side of it is,

473
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:38.610
who gives a fuck whether people like you and not,

474
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.910
it's about what's right is right.
You can have this guy,
judge,

475
00:28:41.911 --> 00:28:46.640
jury and executioner.
I don't know,
man.
I don't want to get,

476
00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:49.610
get going on and all of that fucking thing.
Anyone who gives a shit.
Right?

477
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.710
What else are you gonna do?
What are you gonna talk about now?

478
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.260
I'm settling into the baseball vibe though.
Everybody.
I'm,
I've,

479
00:28:55.261 --> 00:28:59.730
I've decided that I am going to,
uh,
I'm going to start watching some games.

480
00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.520
It always takes me a couple of weeks.
So I'm just sad that hockey's over.

481
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.301
You know,

482
00:29:03.301 --> 00:29:06.840
I even like the basketball and seeing the warriors winning for the first time

483
00:29:06.841 --> 00:29:09.150
and forever was really cool.
So,
um,

484
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:14.370
I'm going to settle in to the base.
It's just,
it's not,
I love baseball.

485
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.520
I like it in October when you can go to a game and have on a jacket,

486
00:29:17.521 --> 00:29:21.120
it's like this shit,
this shit is for like Tan people.
You know what I mean?

487
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:24.180
People would love the Sun.
I love the sun,
but it doesn't love me.

488
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.360
You know what I mean?
I go out there,
I turned red,
I get skin cancer,

489
00:29:27.361 --> 00:29:31.020
they got to take taken scoops out of my fucking wrist or whatever the fuck's

490
00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:33.630
going on and a so I can't do it.

491
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:36.420
Like if I go during the day,

492
00:29:36.421 --> 00:29:40.310
I got to make sure like I'm sitting under some sort of overhang,
you know?

493
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.990
Or I go there with a beach umbrella,

494
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:45.410
which you can't do cause people behind you can't stay.
You can't see.
Right.

495
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:50.060
And then I'm in La so God knows I'll probably get stabbed or stomped or some

496
00:29:50.061 --> 00:29:52.880
shit.
You know,
he didn't.
If the colors the same colors,
the Dodgers,

497
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.610
it's just how it works out here.
I don't understand it.

498
00:29:55.611 --> 00:29:58.830
I don't pretend to understand it.
I don't know what it is.
So when,
anyways,

499
00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.310

00:30:33.801 --> 00:30:37.370
I got a couple of buddies from my old high school days are going to come out,

509
00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.340
excited to see them and then uh,

510
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.430
we're going to end it all down there in Tucson,
Arizona.

511
00:30:43.431 --> 00:30:47.600
And then that's the freaking tour and it's 4th of July,
4th of July weekend,

512
00:30:47.601 --> 00:30:52.460

Api Birthday to United States of America.

513
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:57.350
Happy Birthday to the United States of America.

514
00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.210
Dude,
dude,
dude,
dude,
dude.

515
00:31:00.211 --> 00:31:03.770
Do you see they're going to put a broad on the fucking $10 bill.
You know,

516
00:31:03.771 --> 00:31:07.400
we're the only country that doesn't have a woman on our money.
As far as I know.

517
00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.760
We'll probably not an Iraqi.

518
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.830
They probably still have to sit down there with his angry fucking face.

519
00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:16.640
It'd be real worst,
Huh?
Is Too fucking maniac kids.

520
00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.390
They would probably be on the money.
Right,

521
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:22.370
and I don't mean like they're on point.
I mean they will literally on the money.

522
00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.370
Oh Jesus.
So they're going to put a woman on there.

523
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.490
Everybody's running scared of the ladies.
Now you know,

524
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.410
nobody's going to tell them to pipe down.
You watch this,

525
00:31:30.411 --> 00:31:32.600
they're going to ask for everything and everybody is going to give it to them

526
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.570
because if you don't,
then you're sexist.
Right?

527
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:39.500
I think of a woman is going to be on the $10 bill than women ought to be

528
00:31:39.501 --> 00:31:43.880
printing those $10 bills.
All right?
You want to take Hamilton's face off?

529
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:48.890
The guy that my great,
great,
great,
great,
great fucking uncle shot to death,

530
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:54.020
that fucking punk ass bitch talk at all his shit and he tried to shoot my

531
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:57.770
fucking great,
great,
great,
great fucking uncle and his gun went off.

532
00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.850
Then all of a sudden get out.
He wants to,
he wants to do over.

533
00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.440
Fuck you hammy.
It's over.
Bam.
Right?

534
00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:11.360
Then all of a sudden Aaron Burns the bad guy.
Now he's the fucking bad guy.

535
00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.830
I think it's very fitting that some fucking broad is going to take his spot on

536
00:32:15.831 --> 00:32:16.664
the money.

537
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.660
You know they actually want to be on the 20 because they say that's what comes

538
00:32:20.661 --> 00:32:23.270
out of the ATM.
Cause you know,
no matter what you give them,

539
00:32:23.271 --> 00:32:27.230
they always want more.
Right?
So there you go.
Be on the fucking torn.

540
00:32:27.231 --> 00:32:30.050
And they were saying,
cause Andrew Jackson was a horrible man.

541
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.410
You know what I mean?
It's like well why don't you look up the rest of them?

542
00:32:33.411 --> 00:32:36.380
They're all kinds of horrible considering this country began with genocides.

543
00:32:36.381 --> 00:32:39.050
You fucking idiot.
So I've been doing a bit about this.

544
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:44.150
Like if we're going to replace a horrible man on the $20 bill or the $10 bill

545
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:49.580
with a guys,
uh,
with a woman,
then it should be a horrible woman.

546
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.260
Cause I don't like what that says then.

547
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.860
Cause if you're going to fucking have nothing but horror other than Lincoln,

548
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.210
right?
Maybe even then he kind of looks like a hipster,

549
00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:03.740
doesn't eat with these stupid beard without the mustache.
We get it.
You're weird.

550
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:07.610
You got a personality.
He's top hat.
He dress like a hipster.

551
00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:10.910
You know they're all dressing like that now.
Like they fucking,

552
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:15.800
they had old Abe's ear.
I don't want,
I'm talking about.
So anyways,

553
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:20.000
they're going to be on,
on,
on that money and uh,

554
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.600
I don't give a fuck.
I don't understand why it's even a God damn deal.

555
00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:24.690
You don't have to,
you don't want to.

556
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.920
I think is fucked up is the queen of England is still on so many [inaudible]

557
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.150
she's on like the Australian money.
I think Canada's money.

558
00:33:32.151 --> 00:33:35.330
I've been to a bunch of countries where her dumb faces there and they know they

559
00:33:35.331 --> 00:33:38.600
only really even do anything anymore down there.

560
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.770
Why don't they just take her off,
put on Margaret Thatcher.

561
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:47.660
I always hated that name.
Margaret Thatcher.
Jesus Christ.

562
00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:50.440
How Willie was her Bush.
All right,

563
00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:56.600
sorry.
That is the podcast,
by the way,

564
00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:01.850
if you want to hear one of the fucking great podcast of all time and if you are

565
00:34:01.851 --> 00:34:02.930
a stand standup fan,

566
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:08.560
one of my big regrets as a comedian is I never got to meet the legend.

567
00:34:08.871 --> 00:34:10.820
That was John Fox.

568
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:15.080
John Fox was the ultimate road dog comedian.

569
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:20.200
He was every single stereotype of a comic and I mean all of that in the,

570
00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:26.060
in in the greatest way.
And he had every story,

571
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.130
you know what I mean?
Like when they,

572
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.250
when they go to do a movie about standup comics,

573
00:34:31.251 --> 00:34:34.520
like you got to have a John Fox in there and uh,

574
00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:38.840
Tom Rhodes interviewed him,
just Google Tom Rhodes,

575
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:39.920
John Fox,

576
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:45.430
j o h n Fox and a podcast and have a listen and just listen to them talk and

577
00:34:48.741 --> 00:34:51.200
listen to them laugh and listen to his stories.

578
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:56.230
Like he is as much a comedian as Keith Richards is a guitarist.

579
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.620
Like you have a look at Keith's fucking fingers.
Like if he had,

580
00:34:59.621 --> 00:35:02.480
even if you didn't know who the fuck he was,
you would look at that and be like,

581
00:35:02.481 --> 00:35:06.410
that guy plays guitar.
Okay plays guitar and he smoked cigarettes.

582
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.750
And if you listen to John Fox,
I'm telling you,
you,
you,

583
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.320
you can hear all the places that he's been in and Tom gave a great interview
and,

584
00:35:15.321 --> 00:35:20.000
uh,
I,
let's do it by myself.
I was blown away by it.
And then I,

585
00:35:20.001 --> 00:35:23.930
uh,
I had me and Bart Nick or listening to it last night on the bus,

586
00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:28.610
just laughing our asses off,
uh,
relating to some of the stories.

587
00:35:28.611 --> 00:35:31.550
And then the rest of the story is just sitting there with your jaw on the
ground.

588
00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.070
Um,
he is the,

589
00:35:34.071 --> 00:35:38.520
he's the real deal and it kills me that I never got to just fucking hang out

590
00:35:38.521 --> 00:35:42.420
with them and listen to some stories because he,
I dunno,

591
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:48.210
I don't know that there was anyone like him.
So anyways,
there,
that's the podcast.

592
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:51.660
You guys have a great weekend.
You conch and I'll talk to you on Monday.

593
00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:52.230
All right.

594
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:57.230
And now here's a little bit of throwback Monday morning podcast from a day gone

595
00:35:57.301 --> 00:36:01.410
by no.
Or,
or do good care of your hair as you could draw the pall care.
Yes.

596
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.043
<v 4>Hey baby,</v>

597
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.000
turning back.

598
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.210
<v 5>Can I go into this pizza parlor?
You know,</v>

599
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.150
I ordered a slice of pizza and I go out with it.
That coke,
coke,

600
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:54.630
coke from Mexico where they have the real sugar.
Oh yeah,
they have real sugar.

601
00:36:54.631 --> 00:36:58.170
What do we have?
Five?
We have the fake sugar here.
Yeah,

602
00:36:58.171 --> 00:36:59.550
the Mexican coke is better.

603
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.260
You know one of those Nafta moments like how the fuck,

604
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:05.630
<v 0>okay.</v>

605
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:09.610
<v 5>Doesn't the United States of America have the best fucking Coca Cola?</v>

606
00:37:09.611 --> 00:37:10.690
That's our shit.

607
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:12.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

608
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.930
<v 5>How does Mexico have better Coca Cola than us?
I don't.
I don't get it.</v>

609
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.300
How did the fuck,
how did that happen?

610
00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:24.070
Is that console slick willy signed NAFTA?
Is that what he did?
Is that,

611
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.730
is that the part of his soul that he had to sell so they,
they,

612
00:37:26.731 --> 00:37:31.130
they'd put him in office.
Fucking assholes.
They're all the God damn saying.

613
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:35.900
They're all a bunch of sellouts Democrat or Republican fucking idiots walking

614
00:37:35.901 --> 00:37:40.450
around with signs watching CNN or Fox News.
You're morons.

615
00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.170
You're going to get the same result.

616
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.370
They're going to Democrat or Republican that dropping to their knees and they're

617
00:37:46.371 --> 00:37:51.180
blowing the bankers.
All right,
so enough with your fucking debates.
So anyway,

618
00:37:51.181 --> 00:37:52.070
so I go in there and I go,

619
00:37:52.071 --> 00:37:56.000
let me get a slice of pizza and I'll get evidently the important Coca Cola,

620
00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.710
you guys have fucked up.
That is,

621
00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.030
that's like at the Guinness tasted better over here than it did in Ireland.

622
00:38:04.031 --> 00:38:08.420
That doesn't make any fucking sense whatsoever.
So anyway,

623
00:38:08.421 --> 00:38:12.130
so I walk in there and this stupid ass song,
I didn't know the name of the song.

624
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:16.000
I just know I've heard it in elevators.
I've seen it on television.

625
00:38:16.001 --> 00:38:18.700
I've seen it in commercials.
I hear it in malls.

626
00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:22.840
I can't get away from this fucking song.
This song sucks.

627
00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.750
I unbelievably on so many fucking levels.

628
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:32.230
Everywhere I go,
this stupid ass song is playing.

629
00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.120
I don't know if you guys are familiar with this.
There's no way to eat.

630
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:36.590
You haven't heard this song.
Here it is.

631
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:38.103
<v 4>Okay.</v>

632
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.410
<v 5>You know the song scape is gap adapt with dual,
but dad buggy.
We do.
Bye Bye.</v>

633
00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.880
<v 4>Charged to preach you too hot.</v>

634
00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:56.740
<v 5>Yeah.
Shut the fuck up.
You fucking Douche with a Ukulele.</v>

635
00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.970
Oh Jesus Christ that Steph.
See Animal House moment.

636
00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:04.510
John Belushi should be walking down a flight of stairs to that guy and then

637
00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:09.490
smashing the shit out of his guitar.
Except this time he shouldn't say sorry.

638
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:13.120
He should smash it over.
This guy's fucking head.

639
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:17.730
Sorry.
I'm going a bit of a mode.

640
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.840
Why is that songs so popular?

641
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:28.890
You know why it is because that song moves through your head like fucking air.

642
00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:35.110
Alright comes in one year and it goes right out the other and you are left with

643
00:39:35.531 --> 00:39:39.340
zero thoughts.
Listen to this fucking thing.
You tell me.
Okay.

644
00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:43.180
If you're actually trying to fucking live any sort of a meaningful life,

645
00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:48.570
how in the fuck can you do it when they shit like this in the background.

646
00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.760
<v 4>Cool.
Done.</v>

647
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:58.250
<v 5>Jackie.
I,
I'm in fucking sandals and no one gives a shit.</v>

648
00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:03.500
Um,
I'm yours.
I'm yours.

649
00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.570
That's one for the vaginas.
You know,

650
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.330
download that right to your fucking Twat.

651
00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:16.520
He wasn't even trying to make guys fance.
There's a smart man right there.

652
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:20.990
I bet he's worth,
he's worth this day and age in the music business.

653
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.440
<v 6>Yeah,
but he,
but he got that bad</v>

654
00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.590
<v 5>do if you'll have me tied to a chair while waiting for a delayed flight playing</v>

655
00:40:36.591 --> 00:40:40.400
that music.
That is my Guantanamo Bay right there.

656
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:44.180
I'd rather be fucking waterboarded then listen Elia,
who's getting,
no,

657
00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.920
I don't want to slowly drawn for an hour,
but you know,
I would consider it

658
00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:53.810
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

659
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.633
mmm.

660
00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.810
<v 5>That's like the,
that's like the fucking,
uh,
the,
the,
these,</v>

661
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.960
these black tubes who was standing on the corner of Minneapolis,
uh,
you know,

662
00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.590
those guys who scream about religion,

663
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:19.600
do they ever have like the levels of their pa a juxtapose correctly?

664
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.590
They always talking way too loud.
Yeah.

665
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.270
<v 7>Or the so called war.</v>

666
00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:29.240
Who'd be Tom to talk about some shit.
So cool.
What are the devil?

667
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:31.060
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

668
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.160
<v 7>you have a mother fucker.
And it's just so Paul what,</v>

669
00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.840
<v 5>and you know what's funny is half to white people who walk by,</v>

670
00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:42.240
they probably think that they're making that face like disapproving of the

671
00:41:42.241 --> 00:41:46.310
message rather than the level of,
it's just towed.

672
00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:52.590
Get a new fucking PA,
get a fucking God damn,
uh,

673
00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.070
whatever the fuck he call a person who knows how to run the board,

674
00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:59.490
make it a clean sound.
Okay.
And send it beam line.

675
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:21.020
Excuse me sir.
Not trying to interrupt your hate.
Um,
I just,

676
00:42:21.021 --> 00:42:25.970
it's really difficult to understand what it is I'm supposed to be offended by

677
00:42:25.971 --> 00:42:29.650
what?
I can't understand what it is just saying.
Um,

678
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.910
journal rose actually said to the Guy Jesus was white and one of his,
his,
uh,

679
00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.530
a terminator x guys actually laughed.

680
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:39.700
And then another guy stared at him and then he went right back to the,
uh,

681
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:44.630
fuck white people face.
Once again.

682
00:42:44.631 --> 00:42:48.800
Another classic example why I stay away from organized religion because it leads

683
00:42:48.801 --> 00:42:52.850
you to that.
You know,
Jesus loves everybody,

684
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:57.320
but he's our color and he loves us best,
but he loves everyone.

685
00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:02.480
<v 7>So what this whole call,
what be throwing up these motherfuckers,</v>

686
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:06.740
these motherfuckers,
that shit can't have black quarterback.

687
00:43:06.741 --> 00:43:08.480
What the fuck is that?
So cool.
What ma'am?

688
00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.990
<v 5>Um,
anyways,
let's plow ahead here.
I'm sure that bothered a lot of your ears.</v>

689
00:43:12.991 --> 00:43:17.130
I apologize for that.
But that's literally what the fuck it sounded like.

690
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:22.280
MMM.
I would like to do that on a street corner.

691
00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:26.160
Have a really bad pa like that and just be saying a bunch of fucking reverse

692
00:43:26.161 --> 00:43:28.230
racist shit about white people.

693
00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:35.390
Okay.
I wonder if anybody would get it.
The amount of people

694
00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.300
<v 4>wouldn't.
That was what would make it really hilarious.
But he's like,</v>

695
00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:50.580
[inaudible] the fuck is my newspaper

696
00:43:58.290 --> 00:43:59.123
<v 5>for here.</v>

697
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.450
This is at the risk of burning some potential material.

698
00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:08.480
This is something you can look forward to watching me go off road in the future.

699
00:44:08.881 --> 00:44:13.860
On stage.
All right,
hang on a second.
I got blow my God damn nose again.
Hold on.

700
00:44:13.861 --> 00:44:17.640
Hold on.
Just go eat a pastry.

701
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:28.260
Fuck.
Wow.
Yeah,
we go.

702
00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.680
You had to get it out of the mustache.

703
00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.360
Anyways,
so everybody saw what happened on a swatch Schwartzenegger this week,

704
00:44:37.361 --> 00:44:38.194
right?

705
00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.830
So Time magazine has a,
uh,

706
00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:48.340
has an article out there says sex lies arrogance.

707
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:53.290
What makes powerful men act like pigs?
Okay,

708
00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:58.180
so I look at the,
who wrote it?

709
00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:01.930
It's written by Old Lady.

710
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:07.340
How fucking funny is that?
Sex lies.
Arrogance.
What Po?

711
00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.420
What makes powerful men act like pigs.

712
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:14.780
A woman is going to tell the world why guys act the way they act.

713
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:18.510
Do you realize how fucked up?

714
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:20.510
<v 8>Okay,</v>

715
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:25.400
<v 5>at what point are men going to make a fucking stand here with this?
Okay,</v>

716
00:45:25.401 --> 00:45:29.300
I don't want to come off like a chauvinist pig here and you just giving away.

717
00:45:29.301 --> 00:45:31.820
Every guy should have wrote this article.

718
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:37.610
He could've had so much more fucking insight.
What the fuck does a woman know?

719
00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:43.340
She doesn't know and the whole thing,
it's just the whole thing is written.

720
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.070
Bye.
In the,
in the female's point of view,

721
00:45:48.071 --> 00:45:51.940
which is the only thing you understand is being that woman who got cheated on.

722
00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:53.910
<v 8>Yeah,</v>

723
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:58.380
<v 5>so there's this woman's scorn vibe under the whole article,</v>

724
00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:02.340
but there's no information in here.
I learned nothing.
I was reading it.

725
00:46:02.341 --> 00:46:07.230
I learned nothing as a guy and she's fucking wrong on most of her points.

726
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:10.620
One of the great things they like to say is that

727
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.290
men of power,
the reason why they cheat is because they feel entitled.

728
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:21.240
They feel they're entitled.
I'm not going to burn the bit,
but that is,

729
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:23.550
that's not even true.

730
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.840
And what kills me is some fucking broad like this Nancy Gibbs.
What?

731
00:46:28.841 --> 00:46:33.310
Sit there and argue with me
being a lady,

732
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:36.970
a lady.
Do you understand what you're doing there?

733
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
You're basically telling me that you know how my brain works better than I do.

734
00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:45.970
I was watching her and the reason why I bought this fucking article cause I was,

735
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:50.200
I was watching it on television.
I saw the art and the obviously I like,

736
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:53.740
I'll fucking magnet.
I'm drawn to this.
I'm like,
oh I like this topic.

737
00:46:53.741 --> 00:46:54.700
I want to hear what about this?

738
00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.380
And then Nancy Gibbs comes on and she's talking to a guy

739
00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:04.330
and he's going,
really?
Oh is that was it was.
I was okay.
Like

740
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.730
it's that shadow.
It's fucking terrific.
That would be like me.

741
00:47:09.731 --> 00:47:14.320
Like here's something for you.
Here's his like,
like women,

742
00:47:14.321 --> 00:47:18.220
you never get to know what it's like to have a dick.
All right,
so stop it.

743
00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:21.490
Stop trying to write articles.
Try,
stop trying to act like you were in our heads.

744
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:24.760
And you know what we're thinking.
You don't,
you're always going to be observed.

745
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:27.610
You gotta be an observer.
You sitting on the grassy knoll what to do?

746
00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:30.220
Where do the shots come from?
You?
No fucking idea.

747
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:32.080
You just coming up with your theories,

748
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:35.990
the nerve or you to get to cover a fucking Time magazine with this horse.
Shit.

749
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.750
Just a bunch of horse shit.
They got one over there.
Listen to this shit.
Uh,

750
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:44.480
the turning points,
this is from another lane.

751
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:46.930
They had two people write about this shit.
Elaine,

752
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:51.880
I can't even read a fucking last name.
C O Lino,
whatever.

753
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.160
Frances having it's Anita Hill moment.

754
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:58.180
When the law professor testified before the Senate committee in 1991 that a

755
00:47:58.181 --> 00:48:01.270
former boss,
Clarence Thomas,
had sexually harassed her.

756
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:04.390
He denied everything and was elevated to the Supreme Court.

757
00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:09.040
Notice how the fucking angry cunt leaves out the fact that he was acquitted.

758
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:12.410
The guy was acquitted.
Okay.

759
00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.570
She makes it seem like he was accused of that stuff and because of that he
would,

760
00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:21.500
because of that attention,
he was elevated to the Supreme Court.
But anyways,

761
00:48:21.501 --> 00:48:23.720
hearings where attorney but hearings were terming point.

762
00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:28.900
Women suddenly said that the mad men style of behavior they had been putting up

763
00:48:29.631 --> 00:48:33.830
with at work for so long,
the leering,
the inappropriate touching,

764
00:48:33.831 --> 00:48:37.400
the sexual banter was not acceptable.
Do you understand that?

765
00:48:37.401 --> 00:48:42.380
She's not talking about the 1960s there.
She's talking about 1991.

766
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:45.890
I'm not saying that that shit wasn't happening,
but you know,

767
00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.270
I was in the workforce.
They're all right.
People weren't walking around going,

768
00:48:50.271 --> 00:48:50.511
hey,

769
00:48:50.511 --> 00:48:55.511
touch grabbing people's asses at work in 98919901991 they weren't,

770
00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:00.170
I mean,
generally speaking warrant,

771
00:49:00.171 --> 00:49:03.860
but this lady just fucking goes the mad men style,

772
00:49:03.861 --> 00:49:08.600
which is from the 1960s Madison Avenue.
Hey Sweetie,

773
00:49:08.601 --> 00:49:10.940
go make me a fucking sandwich.
That error,

774
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:15.500
completely ignoring all the bullshit that happened in the late sixties,

775
00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:18.020
seventies,
right through the fucking eighties and the 80s.

776
00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:22.070
They would talk about women wearing their fucking little power suits and power

777
00:49:22.071 --> 00:49:23.660
ties and all that fucking horse shit.

778
00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:28.880
This is all just one of these classic things where you just,
you just,

779
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:31.690
you have your angle and then you just,
you just write the whole fucking article.

780
00:49:31.691 --> 00:49:36.130
It's complete horse shit.
Um,
what the hell is the quote in here?

781
00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:40.820
I wanted to read.
I don't even know.
All right,

782
00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:44.540
let me tell you something Nancy,
let me tell you something Elaine.

783
00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:49.460
Those guys don't do that shit cause they feel entitled.
They don't.

784
00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:52.310
All right,
they don't.

785
00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:56.630
And if you want to know why come out to a comedy club cause I'm not burning the

786
00:49:56.631 --> 00:49:58.800
fucking material out.
Talk about it a little bit.

787
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:02.700
I'll talk about real quick.
Alright.

788
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:08.250
What it is is women don't understand what it's like
to have a dick.

789
00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.100
They just don't get it.
Okay?

790
00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:15.750
The fucking thing tells us what to do.
You know,

791
00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:19.860
and right now they're rolling their eyes because they don't understand the sex

792
00:50:19.861 --> 00:50:23.190
drive that we have.
How could they,
they got a VAD.

793
00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:27.290
All right.
And the is,

794
00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:31.720
there's no information out there to help people to help guys out.
Nothing.

795
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:37.220
All guys get,
there's no information about being a guy in general.
Hey,

796
00:50:37.221 --> 00:50:41.780
keep it in your pants.
That's the sexual advice we get.
That's what we get.

797
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:43.520
Fucker,
you got cosmo.

798
00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:46.370
There's reams of shit talking about all the folds in your vagina.

799
00:50:46.371 --> 00:50:49.610
Every goddamn month we get,
Hey,
keep it in your pants.

800
00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:53.630
That's the kind of advice guys get.
You go to jail.
Hey,
don't drop the soap.

801
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.520
That's it.
That's all you get.

802
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:58.970
We get a little fucking four sentences and that's how we're supposed to fucking

803
00:50:58.971 --> 00:51:02.860
navigate through life.
So you're pulling with a Dick.

804
00:51:02.861 --> 00:51:04.850
He got this ridiculous fucking sex drive.

805
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.580
The only thing that fucking keeps it in check is the fact that women won't fuck

806
00:51:10.581 --> 00:51:13.430
you.
You got to figure out,
you've got to talk them into it.

807
00:51:13.431 --> 00:51:14.690
You go through dry spells.

808
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:19.550
That's the only thing that prevents the guy from fucking 24 hours a day is other

809
00:51:19.551 --> 00:51:22.730
women making it difficult for us to get laid.

810
00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:27.280
But then what happens is when you become an a position of power,

811
00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.390
these cunts flip the fucking table and will suck your Dick under your fucking

812
00:51:31.391 --> 00:51:34.120
God damn desk while your wife's sits across from you.

813
00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:36.430
So now the governor has taken off.

814
00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:41.110
You've never had to control your sexual urges because it was always done for
you.

815
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.930
You like a spoiled kid.
Now you fucking famous.

816
00:51:43.931 --> 00:51:46.660
She got all these broads coming at you.
You don't know what to do

817
00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:51.160
because you never really noticed how much you've been been led around by a Dick.

818
00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.430
Now I'm not saying every powerful guy out there is an angel.

819
00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:56.320
There's not this definitely some pigs out there.

820
00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.200
There's definitely some guys out there who do feel entitled.

821
00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:02.920
But to just paint it with that broad fucking stroke of a brush and have a

822
00:52:02.921 --> 00:52:06.280
fucking woman sitting there telling me it's you.

823
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:09.430
You don't know what you talking about lady.
All right.

824
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:11.800
<v 8>Okay.</v>

825
00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:16.340
<v 5>If I just fucking blows my mind blows my fucking mind that they,</v>

826
00:52:16.341 --> 00:52:19.670
they put two people on this assignment and they were both women.

827
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:24.320
Was that some political correct fucking thing?
Cause they were worried that guys,

828
00:52:24.321 --> 00:52:28.070
we're going to say what the fuck I'm saying that basically their husbands would

829
00:52:28.071 --> 00:52:33.071
be out fucking everything that moved if women wanted to fuck the way we want it

830
00:52:33.141 --> 00:52:33.974
to.

831
00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.080
<v 8>Okay.</v>

832
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:36.830
<v 5>I don't know.</v>

833
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:40.940
And not to mention most people can handle power and that includes broads.

834
00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:42.710
Okay.

835
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:46.670
So you get some guy in a powerful position is ego's already going to go through

836
00:52:46.671 --> 00:52:51.671
the fucking roof and then you combine that with the fact that basically half of

837
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:58.601
the free world will now fuck him and he's supposed to somehow rein that in and

838
00:52:59.121 --> 00:53:03.860
is only piece of advice is keep it in your pants.
You know?

839
00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:04.803
I mean I dunno

840
00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:09.740
they I that it's really embarrassing the Time magazine with this fucking

841
00:53:09.741 --> 00:53:12.410
superficial that they just basically,

842
00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:19.570
I mean it was like psych 101
how they broke it down

843
00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:24.250
even though shit on on a Arnold Schwarzenegger about how he,

844
00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:26.900
he likes fucking around with girls that aren't beautiful.

845
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:29.123
<v 8>You know</v>

846
00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.530
<v 5>they said it was cause he was intimidated by beautiful women and</v>

847
00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:34.960
Blahblahblahblahblah see they're women,
they don't,

848
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:38.800
they don't get the difference between hooking up with a hottie and hooking up

849
00:53:38.801 --> 00:53:42.460
with the plain Jane girl who's going to try harder.
Okay.

850
00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.290
As opposed to the fucking chick who's,

851
00:53:44.291 --> 00:53:48.430
who's got 0% body fat and just thinks she's God's got damn gift.

852
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:52.660
You've seen that,
right?
You go to a titty bar?
The hottest one there does,

853
00:53:52.661 --> 00:53:56.350
she tries hard is that fucking one in the middle?
She doesn't,

854
00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.770
and after awhile,
you know what?
You start looking at those hotties going,

855
00:53:59.771 --> 00:54:01.840
you know what?
They're fucking more trouble than they're worth.

856
00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.753
<v 8>All right,</v>

857
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.610
<v 5>I wiped my dick sucked to completion.
Who am I going with?</v>

858
00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:09.950
<v 8>Okay.</v>

859
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:14.090
<v 5>The supermodel looking chick or the chick who's just happy to be there.</v>

860
00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:15.440
<v 8>Okay?</v>

861
00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.490
<v 0>Fucking morons.</v>

862
00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:22.570
I got out of [inaudible].
