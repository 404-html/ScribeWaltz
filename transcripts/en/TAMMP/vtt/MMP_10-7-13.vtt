1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.730
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:05.940
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:10.740
October 7th,
2013 October.

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.200
We're all the way into the fall.
Here it is officially October.

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.980
It's the month of pink.
Yes it is.

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.470
Are you aware that cancer is ensouled bodies,
boobs?

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.090
Hey,
I actually think that they weren't wearing,
um,
the,
the,
the,

8
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.220
the pink stuff as much.
I didn't think there was or maybe I'm just used to it.

9
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.440
Is that what it is?
I have no idea.
I had no fucking idea.

10
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:43.920
All I know is I watched some football yesterday and,
um,

11
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.620
first of all,
who's kidding?
Who?
Who is kitten?
Who?
I'll tell you.
Who's kidding,

12
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:53.400
who?
I'm kidding myself when I say this.
Next thing,

13
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.330
let's go red sox.
Here we go.

14
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.660
Team that I haven't watched all fucking year.
Boom,
boom.

15
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:02.970
I've watched to red sox games this whole year.

16
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.370
Game One and game two of the playoffs.

17
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.840
Hey,
like what's his face says in the warriors?
I've been busy.

18
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.610
All right.
I was too fucking busy to watch him added.
That isn't the truth.

19
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.420
The truth of the matter is,
uh,

20
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.050
one of my favorite players tested positive for some substance in 2010.

21
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.670
And at that point I was like,
you know what,

22
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:28.920
I'm going to give baseball fucking rest here.
Okay.

23
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.790
I'm sick of feeling like a fucking eight year old,
not even an eight year old,

24
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:35.970
a four year old who's,
who's,
you know,

25
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.710
and then they won the championship and they lived happily ever after.

26
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.220
And I go to bed with my little broken smile cause might be young,

27
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:48.090
two faces is starting to fall out and I get a quarter under my pillow and I

28
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:50.940
believe that everybody did it in an honest fuck away.
And then three,

29
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:55.030
four years later,
ESPN comes out with you.

30
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.740
Yet another guy,
another fresh faced white dude,
you know,

31
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:01.320
with little habit dash on or maybe a former player,

32
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.480
maybe a former player comes on and then they fucking let me know that everything

33
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:07.440
that I thought was,

34
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.480
wasn't everything that he thought his isn't add a that I'm just a dump freckled

35
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:16.290
cunt.
And I just,
I got sick of it.
So,

36
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.480
so I haven't been watching.
I mean,
I,
I kind of,
you know,

37
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.450
it was watching as they dismantled Terry left town,
Theo Epstein,

38
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:28.380
he's,
he's over out there in Chicago and I watched the gradual,

39
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.490
the whole thing disintegrate.
But,
um,
I do,
you know what's funny,

40
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.550
I was actually texting another buddy of mine,
like,
oh,
hey,

41
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:38.760
I agree you've been watching the red sox at all?
And he goes,
yeah,
yeah,

42
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:41.840
I've been watching them and I open,
openly admitted.
I was like,
dude,
I'm,

43
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:45.330
I'm beyond fucking bandwagon this year.
And he laughed and he goes,

44
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.660
so am I where we both live out fucking on the west coast now?

45
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.100
And we were watching the game and he was literally saying like,
he,

46
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.750
he was thinking shit like,
Hey,
you know that Asian guy,
we got really good.

47
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.910
Neither one of us do is name our relief pitcher who,

48
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.890
I can't even say his lights out because I've watched 18 innings.

49
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.543
Um,

50
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.150
some of it with the sound down and I don't even know the name of our clothes.

51
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.200
I just know that he's Asian and he's,
he's been killing it.
So,
um,

52
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.610
oh my God,
you're going to see it.

53
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.200
If the Red Sox win the world series and I go out and get the hat,

54
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.020
cause you know you got to go out and get the hat.
All right.

55
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.630
Put your arms around other fans.
Yeah.
Well la go down.

56
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.130
You Act like you've been there.
Well I'm here to admit,
right.

57
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.120
You know what I'm doing right now.

58
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.470
I'm doing that thing when somebody fucks up in a game and afterwards when the

59
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:46.030
report has come to the locker room,

60
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.350
rather than let the reporters say how bad you sucked,

61
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.790
you just own up to it.

62
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.390
<v 1>Oh you're going to talk to her.</v>

63
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.990
I take full responsibility or there's the,
or let my teammates down.

64
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.400
<v 0>I let down my mom,
my high school coaches,
you know,</v>

65
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.370
everybody hates me.

66
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:10.930
I'm going to let you know I hate myself even more than you hate me.
Okay?

67
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.580
I suck.
Look at me and pointing right in my face.
I shuck.
Okay,

68
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.500
so you don't need to write it.

69
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.310
That's what I'm doing before you guys call me out for being Oh,
Billy bandwagon.

70
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.490
I'm like,
you know,
I am all right.
Purlins.
I'm onboard from day one,

71
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:29.290
although I haven't watched a second of it yet,

72
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:33.610
but I take the fucking games over there.
Um,
I was on the road.

73
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.180
Alright.
Even busy is fucking busy.

74
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.490
I went this week and Went El Paso to San Jose,

75
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.250
then it went up to Seattle.
Um,

76
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.960
and then I went down to Phoenix,
Arizona,
another great fucking week.

77
00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:55.370
But if it was airport,
airport,
airport,
airport,
airport,

78
00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.320
is that what it was?
No,
I drove to El Paso.
That was a good time.
You know,

79
00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:04.520
the old me would've gone in a straight shot.
12 hours.
I got this.

80
00:05:04.521 --> 00:05:06.830
I'll leave at 10 in the fucking morning and get there at 10 at night.

81
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.630
Have myself a fucking case at dia and I would just gone to bed.
But,
uh,

82
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.100
I'm fucking old now.
I got right around Tucson and I was like,
Oh,
I'm trierd

83
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.430
my ass hurts.
And um,

84
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.480
I got to get fucking hotel and I get to tell you,
it was great.

85
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.860
It was great.
I drove for like eight hours.
That's what I did.

86
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.370
I drove for eight hours and um,

87
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.880
and then the next day I woke up and I drove basically from Tucson to El Paso and

88
00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:42.080
it was fucking,
it was awesome,
man.
Going through the bad lands of,
uh,

89
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.910
New Mexico with is just fucking nothing out there.
You know,
it's funny,

90
00:05:46.911 --> 00:05:48.740
somebody sent me on Twitter was saying,
you know,

91
00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:52.880
I hope bill doesn't have a beautiful drive out to El Paso so I don't have to

92
00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:55.130
hear about it.
And that fucking made me laugh.

93
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.360
So God hard just because of what is behind that.

94
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:03.110
Like how miserable was your fucking childhood that you don't want to hear

95
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:06.260
somebody say that they had a great time and that this is a beautiful country.

96
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.280
Like you'd much rather have me go out there and be like,

97
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:13.100
just fucking nothing out there.
You know,
a bunch of fucking

98
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.830
fucking Indian reservations.
You know,
we should just kill the rest of them.
Right.

99
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:22.160
And put up a fucking sports bra,
you know,

100
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.990
fucking moron.
That's,
but you know what?
But he's younger.

101
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.060
I think it was John Younger,
judging by his Avatar.
You liked that?

102
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:37.061
I picked up that little word of Technology Avatar C I l e o fucking week ago.

103
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.260
I just thought it was a movie.

104
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.270
We're shit floated around you and there was these blue people was like,

105
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.410
it was smurf porn,
right?
If you're straight like it was SMURF porn.

106
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.990
That's what that fucking movie was.

107
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:55.940
Smart porn combined with the way that guy drew those pictures on good times when

108
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:57.770
they pretended Jimmy Walker painted him.

109
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.430
Remember that they'd have a dude dunking a basketball and his arm would be like

110
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:04.940
extra long.
It's combinded both of those schools

111
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.830
I feel,
you know,
and at the end of the day,

112
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.890
I don't remember a fucking second of that movie.

113
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.570
I just remember somebody had a,
I just remember that the,

114
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.460
didn't everybody have like hair?

115
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:23.090
Like every quarterback in the NFL except it was blue.

116
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.260
<v 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.170
<v 0>I Dunno how fucking know
they had the same body types of that dude.</v>

118
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:33.960
It goes right from high school into the NBA.
You know,

119
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.250
not quite a boy and not quite a man body.
And you fucking six,
10.

120
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.220
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

121
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.090
<v 0>Am I thinking of the right fucking well anyways,
judge her by this kid's Avatar.</v>

122
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.020
He was,
uh,
he was,
you know,
young.
He was in his twenties.

123
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:53.021
So your 20s is all about taking your childhood out on everyone that you'll run

124
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:57.710
into.
You're not,
you don't realize that you're doing it.

125
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.160
At least this is how my life went.
Now granted,
if you had,

126
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.150
if you had a wonderful childhood,
if there was no conflict,
I mean,

127
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:09.320
what is a wonderful childhood?
What it was a one,
it was,
whew.
Um,

128
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.190
whatever.
If you had one where people,
um,

129
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.590
there's no way that there's no way to not fuck up your kid.
What it really is,

130
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:22.220
is you're trying to fuck it up the least,

131
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.140
the least amount that you can,

132
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:28.040
you're trying to send your kid out into the world with the least amount of

133
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.200
fucking issues.
So,

134
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.430
<v 2>okay.</v>

135
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:34.590
<v 0>I Dunno,
I guess that they could be happy.</v>

136
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.940
And then also that you don't have to be sitting in the back of a courtroom and

137
00:08:38.941 --> 00:08:43.260
complete denial that,
yeah,
you know,
your kid fucked a dog.

138
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.810
No,
I just think it's going to come.
We'll see it.
Present the evidence.
I think,

139
00:08:51.811 --> 00:08:53.610
you know,
yes,

140
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.210
there was dog hair in his pubes but that doesn't mean anything.
No,
it does it,

141
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.520
it's circumstantial.
Um,

142
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.270
maybe that's what it is.
So whatever.
So I didn't get upset by that guy.
I mean,
my,

143
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:10.600
how my life went was in my twenties,
my early twenties.

144
00:09:10.601 --> 00:09:15.010
I was like this fucking like really quiet,

145
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.120
got along with everybody.
And then all of a sudden out of nowhere,

146
00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:22.990
like my anger would flare up like that fake volcano in front of that fucking

147
00:09:22.991 --> 00:09:26.500
casino out there in the desert.
What does it treasure island.

148
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.420
Right?
Um,
and then people would be like,
what the fuck is that?

149
00:09:31.421 --> 00:09:32.860
Is they look for their eyebrows.

150
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

151
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.660
<v 0>And uh,
then I didn't know how to apologize.</v>

152
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:38.030
And that would be the end of the relationship

153
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.510
<v 3>and</v>

154
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.573
<v 0>late twenties.</v>

155
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.680
So when it came to the surface thirties brutal came out of the 30s.

156
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.850
Right before I hit the ground at,
I started to pull it up a little bit.

157
00:09:49.851 --> 00:09:54.080
Now I'm somewhere in the middle.
I'm a fucking mess.
Everybody.
I really am.

158
00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:56.630
I don't know why you're listening to this other than maybe it makes you feel

159
00:09:56.631 --> 00:09:59.840
better about yourself.
I don't fucking know.
Or maybe you just hate your job.

160
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.510
Do you guys watch any football yesterday?
Great.
Gabe.

161
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.920
Some great games and some not so great games.
I'll tell you,

162
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.450
if you guys taped the Patriots Bengals game,
if you are a fan of ugly,

163
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:16.070
ugly,
ugly turn away from the TV,
football,

164
00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:20.450
that was an ugly one.
And um,
and I dunno,

165
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.940
I dunno,
this is going to be a,

166
00:10:22.941 --> 00:10:26.060
I have to watch the rest of the game because I was so fucking exhausted.

167
00:10:26.061 --> 00:10:27.740
I only get two hours sleep.
So I watched,

168
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.490
I watched right up until the third quarter when it out went off the rails.

169
00:10:31.491 --> 00:10:34.370
So I still have to watch the rest of the game when it starts raining and all

170
00:10:34.371 --> 00:10:37.220
that type of shit.
But uh,
it was just,

171
00:10:37.221 --> 00:10:39.770
neither team could score a fucking point.

172
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:46.260
Bunch of God damn field goals.
Um,
and the Patriots lost.
But I would have,

173
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.780
what are you going to do?
I mean,

174
00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:51.320
I thought at this point we'd be fucking two and three foreign one.
I'll take it.

175
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:56.000
But uh,
I dunno.
I Dunno what to take about anybody at this point.

176
00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:01.060
You're looking at the God damn cowboys Broncos game and all you fucking big

177
00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:06.740
buckled.
Big stupid hat.
Fucking facelift.

178
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.460
Botoxed overly made up cons in Dallas.

179
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.900
If you fucking jump on Tony Romo after that game you are at,

180
00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:16.550
you're a fucking moron.

181
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.000
How many points does the guy have to score to win a God damn game?

182
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.990
Fucking put up 48 points against the Broncos.

183
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.170
48 fucking points and then the end,
he throws an interception goods.

184
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.560
<v 4>Same Old Toady.
All right.
It's the same.
I'll told you right there.
I swear to God,</v>

185
00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:39.100
he's like a ranch hand.
I used to have,
he could play find shit.
Eight Brian,

186
00:11:39.101 --> 00:11:42.080
800 cattle into fucking row and then he dropped it on his foot.

187
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.660
Wouldn't get that last one.

188
00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:45.100
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

189
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.390
<v 4>Well you,
you'll get their last one or what the fuck you do the whole her for.</v>

190
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.660
I ain't going to do the whole fucking hard.
I fucking do it myself there.
That,

191
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:54.070
maybe

192
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.390
<v 0>not with that fucking accent.
Listen man,</v>

193
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.480
the guy scored 48 fucking points in his goddamn defense.

194
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:06.100
Put them in a situation where now he had to go out and score better than 51 just

195
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.530
to get a goddamn victory.
So yeah,
you got a sling it

196
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.370
and that dude who picked it off with was laid out.

197
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.600
It was an incredible interception.
Alright,
so,
hey,

198
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:19.870
I'm fucking stick on with Tony over here.
Um,

199
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.170
and then you got the Broncos who,
uh,

200
00:12:24.171 --> 00:12:26.200
that they're doing that Miami Dolphins,

201
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.620
Dan Marino thing right now with this did just outscoring people.

202
00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:34.180
They're letting up a lot of fucking points.
They're letting up a lot of points.

203
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:39.181
And I'll tell you as a fan of NFL football when I've seen in the past is,

204
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.363
um,

205
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.340
if you score a zillion points during the regular season and you let up half a

206
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.830
zillion points,
uh,
you lose in the playoffs.

207
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:53.050
Playoffs because you end up running into fucking amazing defenses that win games

208
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:56.470
20 to 17 when you run into that fucking team.
All right?

209
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:59.800
And they slow the whole fucking thing down,
you know,

210
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.870
slow down the other offense in that type of shit.

211
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.660
Then you'd done if they have any sort of running game and then they keep your

212
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:05.830
fucking guy off the field,

213
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.490
all of a sudden you're sitting there with your pockets turned inside out going,

214
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:13.300
where's my proverbial football wallet there?
Jesus,
Bill,

215
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.970
she's got diarrhea porn out of your mouth this week.

216
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:20.770
Don't you talk in all kinds of shit?
Yeah.
So I don't even know.
I don't know.

217
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:25.380
I don't even know where the Broncos,
I don't know who shot.
I don't.
Who's not?
Um,

218
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.720
then you have Seattle.
We,

219
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.440
right.
They fucking go in and um,

220
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.820
they got beat by the goddamn colts

221
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:43.290
in last week if fucking that dude from the Texans who,
uh,

222
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.520
according to Paul Versey,
it was talking to him this morning.

223
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:49.300
He's thrown a pick six,
four weeks in a row,
but he doesn't throw a pick six.

224
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.900
That's two games they lost on the road.
And that's a knock against that team.

225
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:55.780
They're saying that they're not good on the road.
Jesus Christ.

226
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.380
This is shaping up to be a very interesting football season.

227
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.930
And you know why that is?
Because they have a hard cap.
So everybody's in it.

228
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:10.180
You hear that baseball and be a basketball.

229
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.120
I haven't even watched baseball.
I don't even know if it's working or not.
Um,

230
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.710
anyway,
so there he go.
So there's my sports talk for the week.
Hey,

231
00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.090
anybody out there left?
Any ladies left?

232
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.540
I went on the road this week with a Joe Barden,

233
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:31.780
Nick Roosevelt Tailgate Legend,

234
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.110
the godfather of our fucking tail gate.

235
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.460
If anybody's getting his ring kissed on that wonderful fucking New Year's day,

236
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.010
it's Joey be,
I got to tell you something.

237
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.640
That fucking guy made me laugh.

238
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.430
I just keep,
that guy kills me.

239
00:14:48.431 --> 00:14:52.600
If you get a chance to see Joe Partic do stand up,
um,

240
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.300
I don't know how to describe it.

241
00:14:55.301 --> 00:14:59.780
It's just watching a crowd figure out who the fuck he is.

242
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.660
It takes him,
I swear it takes them about two and a half,
three minutes,

243
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.350
and then they're onboard and they're going on the ride.

244
00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.340
<v 2>And,
uh,</v>

245
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:13.150
<v 0>I don't,
I don't know how to tell you what the fuck he was.
He,
he went,</v>

246
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.750
we will walk in through Seattle and he started talking about homeless people.

247
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.530
He had me fucking die and laugh.
And I'm like,
you've got to do that tonight.

248
00:15:20.531 --> 00:15:22.630
And he tried it out when we were at the,
uh,

249
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:28.000
the beautiful pageant theater in a,
in Seattle.

250
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.081
And by the way,

251
00:15:29.081 --> 00:15:31.690
we both walking around talking about how much we loved that fucking city,
man,

252
00:15:31.691 --> 00:15:35.650
that is an underrated Seattle,
Washington,

253
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.860
especially if it's,
if it's sunny up.

254
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.980
Thank you for that shit you took last night.
Um,

255
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.600
the fuck am I talking about?
You know,
what's crazy about the Seattle?

256
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.460
Every time I fly in,
first of all,

257
00:15:51.461 --> 00:15:54.010
usually it's raining and I'm freaking out that we're going to crash.

258
00:15:54.011 --> 00:15:58.320
But this time it was sunny and,
uh,

259
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.650
we were flying out over whatever the Puget sound,
whatever the hell it is.

260
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.230
And I had the window seat and I looked down and,
you know,

261
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:10.030
I've been meaning to find this fucking house.
You have a goal and you land,

262
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:10.320
you'll,

263
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.870
you coming in for a landing and you're looking down over these neighborhoods and

264
00:16:13.871 --> 00:16:14.890
it just looks like,
you know,

265
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.310
you know the little houses all made out of ticky tack that Bullshit.

266
00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:22.390
And then every once in a while you fly over one of those Illuminati

267
00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:26.500
neighborhoods and it could even be your home state.
And it just so,

268
00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:27.580
because the winds are different,

269
00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:30.220
they just flew over a different area that day and you look down like you're

270
00:16:30.221 --> 00:16:35.140
going to,
where the fuck are those houses?
Is that a school or is that a house?

271
00:16:35.141 --> 00:16:39.900
Well,
what is that?
W W it was one of those deals we were coming in,

272
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.840
I feel like a different way than usual.

273
00:16:42.841 --> 00:16:46.740
And I had the window seat and I looked out and what I saw,

274
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.860
it can't be described as a mansion,
whatever.

275
00:16:49.861 --> 00:16:53.670
What's the next size up from a mansion?
Like a villa?

276
00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:55.950
Is that the word you use?
You know what it looked like.

277
00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.270
You guys ever see that movie?

278
00:16:57.271 --> 00:17:01.080
The dirty dozen with Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson.

279
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.590
Do you remember when all those Nazi officers were in that,

280
00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:07.950
that they were in France and they were in that day,
you know,

281
00:17:07.951 --> 00:17:12.951
cause they were occupying France and they took over the whole fucking country.

282
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:18.320
And so they were in that giant looking like castle type thing that all these

283
00:17:18.391 --> 00:17:20.970
rooms and these,
that's what this thing looked like.

284
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.570
<v 2>And um,</v>

285
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.680
<v 0>we're flying over the thing and it was surrounded by these beautiful tall trees</v>

286
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.040
all around the house.
And then on three sides of it,

287
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:38.100
it looked like three manicured fairways in the shape of like football fields.

288
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.570
Absolutely fucking immaculate.

289
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.410
And it was right on this like peninsula and there was water around it.

290
00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:51.720
And then you had to walk like a hundred yard yet walk like fucking look.

291
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:56.750
It looked like 200 feet of woods from the house and then a hundred yard football

292
00:17:57.301 --> 00:17:58.134
field.

293
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.690
And then right on the edge of the water was one of the coolest looking in ground

294
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:05.540
pools I've ever seen in my life.
Like you,

295
00:18:05.541 --> 00:18:10.290
you'd have to take a fucking tram from the house to get to the pool.

296
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.850
And,
uh,
I dunno,
I'm going to try and find it.

297
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.250
I don't know how to tweet it or something like that.

298
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:20.400
I don't want to tweet somebody fucking house,
but,
uh,

299
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.570
I don't know who lives there,

300
00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:26.571
but if there is people that meet every day to decide whether it rains or not,

301
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.650
that guy who lives there or that lady there at that meeting,

302
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.090
casting their vote.
Cause I dunno,

303
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.740
I've never seen a fucking house like that on my life.
Um,

304
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.210
so anyways,
so we go into Seattle and as usual,

305
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.830
and this is the last time I'm doing it,

306
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:49.010
I went down to that stupid fucking fisherman's wharf there where they throw,

307
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:53.970
show him throwing the fish.
And as I was walking there,

308
00:18:53.971 --> 00:18:56.490
this is the first time I walked in there,
I was like,
why am I going down here?

309
00:18:56.491 --> 00:18:58.980
This is such a touristy thing to do.
You know,

310
00:18:58.981 --> 00:19:01.220
the food's going to suck and it's going to be overpriced.

311
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.800
And that's exactly what the fuck happened.
You know,
I,

312
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:09.600
I got like some Crab Burger,
Bart.
Nick got his,
his burger,

313
00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:14.490
his burger was cold.
Mine was all right.
And I'm like,

314
00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:19.140
of course nobody from Seattle goes down here to see a bunch of asshole tourists

315
00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:20.160
by in Seattle,

316
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:24.480
magnets and sweatshirts with the fuck did they go and I forgot to ask.

317
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.720
I Dunno.
So anyways,
so I had a shit sandwich with a side of fries there.

318
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.940
So,
uh,
then I went out,

319
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:37.560
I did the show at the paramount theater and um,

320
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.690
it was crazy.
Like the theater was one of these deals where like you,
um,

321
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.960
I don't know,
just the way it was set up,
like you said,

322
00:19:45.961 --> 00:19:49.020
the joke and there was like half a second pause and then,

323
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.390
then you'd hear the laughter coming back to the stage.

324
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:54.810
So kind of fucked up my timing at first and everything went great.

325
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.050
And in the end somebody finally yelled,

326
00:19:58.051 --> 00:20:01.020
Seattle and I kind of brought up the fact that I had sung,

327
00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:03.240
we are the loudest or whatever.
I got booed a little bit,

328
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:06.960
but they were cool about it.
And,
um,

329
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.580
I dunno,
it was just,
it was an awesome show.
And then I found out that,
uh,

330
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.090
Dave Chappelle was in town right around the corner to me.
And Bart.
Nick,

331
00:20:15.091 --> 00:20:20.091
like two little school girls literally ran over to where he was performing and

332
00:20:20.311 --> 00:20:22.590
got to watch the last 10 minutes of his set,

333
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.010
which of course his last 10 minutes crushed.

334
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.500
Anything that I've ever written in my entire career.

335
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.590
You know,
it was a nice,
uh,
it was in that,

336
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.360
what do you call it and not eyeopener,
whatever,
like this,
you know,

337
00:20:39.361 --> 00:20:42.500
the second you'd think like,
Hey,
I think I'm getting a handle this.
Ah,

338
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.750
wait a minute,
I still suck.
Okay,
cool.
Um,

339
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.260
so it was an awesome night and then we went to this fucking bar.

340
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.110
Chapelle was over at the Moore Theater,

341
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.570
which is the one where Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam made that one where he was in

342
00:20:58.571 --> 00:21:00.880
the dirty shorts.
Right.

343
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.860
And he dropped down into the crowd after he stared at him for uncomfortably long

344
00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:07.990
time.
Um,

345
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:13.060
so we went to this bar right around the corner and it just seems shady.

346
00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:16.680
The second we walked in and I,
according to Bart,
the bouncer said,
hey,

347
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.560
when we walked in,
after he checked Barton excited d,
he said,
good luck.

348
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:28.330
So I proceed to drink way more than I should have.
And you know,

349
00:21:28.331 --> 00:21:32.200
the end of the night comes and I'm hungry.
So I go up to the front desk and I,

350
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:35.530
yeah,
you guys Zara's.
They're like,
no,

351
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:39.340
there's fucking drunk Leprechaun.
Here's a pizza menu.

352
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.560
Get away from the front desk.
You're scaring the lace.

353
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.760
So I vaguely remember this.

354
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:50.820
I went upstairs and I'm trying to order a pizza and something in my back of my

355
00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:53.080
head goes,
you should be like,
this is a sour.

356
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.270
So I called him up and they were like a thank you for calling Gina's pizza.

357
00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.040
Can you hold please?
And you know,
can you hold please?

358
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:03.130
They don't wait for a response.
They immediately put you on hold.
They show,

359
00:22:03.131 --> 00:22:05.620
they should just say,
hey,
welcome to fucking Freddy's pizza.

360
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.550
I'm putting you on hold.
But they don't care.
Welcome to Tony's pizza.

361
00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.530
Can you hold please?
And they put me on hold.

362
00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:15.070
So I'm sitting there and I'm sitting there and I think I actually passed out for

363
00:22:15.071 --> 00:22:18.480
a second and I woke up and I was still on hold or I,

364
00:22:18.481 --> 00:22:21.040
I think I passed that with my eyes open.
Like one of those things,

365
00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:24.850
I just started thinking about shit and I forgot what I was doing and I was just

366
00:22:24.851 --> 00:22:28.990
like,
why is one of my ears hotter than the other?
Oh,
I'm on halt.
I was,

367
00:22:28.991 --> 00:22:31.780
I got a fucking,
let me call back.
So I call back again.
Hey,

368
00:22:31.781 --> 00:22:34.780
welcome to Geno's pizza.
Can you hold,
please put me on fucking hold again.

369
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.420
And as I was like,
no,
no,
I just want to learn a bit.

370
00:22:37.421 --> 00:22:38.440
And they already had me on hold.

371
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.370
So I sat there for another fucking couple minutes.
My ears getting hot again.

372
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.850
So I hang up and I don't really remember what I said,

373
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:51.990
but I called them back and as it going,
hey,
welcome to Tony's pizza.

374
00:22:51.991 --> 00:22:56.360
I just start dropping f bombs going,
yell,
fuck,

375
00:22:56.361 --> 00:22:59.060
I'm foot fucking Samia fucking all you fucking ass.

376
00:22:59.061 --> 00:23:03.660
I just want to fucking be fucking I,
I can't remember.
I said,
fuck like 58 times.

377
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.500
And the guy in the other end goes,
hey buddy,
buddy,
you,
you need to relax.

378
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.990
And I just kept,
I was like,
it was like I was filibustering with Tourette's.

379
00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.770
I and I plowed right through that firefighter is hung up on me and they went

380
00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:21.420
over to the bed,
bright passed out,
face down,
you know,
in the pillow,

381
00:23:21.421 --> 00:23:25.410
breathing in carbon dioxide for the rest of the night and woke up with a brutal,

382
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:31.010
brutal hangover as I had to fly to Phoenix the next day.

383
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:35.820
And I had one of those ridiculously smiling,

384
00:23:35.821 --> 00:23:40.230
like a fucking maniac.
A stewardess is like,

385
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.000
I dunno what happened.
Like

386
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.940
she's still putting on this makeup to the point.

387
00:23:46.941 --> 00:23:50.380
She looked like some crazy clown and she was just saying,

388
00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.020
<v 5>hey,
how are you?</v>

389
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.170
<v 0>Yay.
Yeah,</v>

390
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:59.430
like adding syllables to fucking one syllable words day.

391
00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:04.290
And it was just kinda like,
can I get it?

392
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.950
<v 5>She would drink this morning</v>

393
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.650
<v 0>just fucking like,
you can see it.</v>

394
00:24:10.651 --> 00:24:15.651
Her life was almost over the hill of hope and she was just going to go,

395
00:24:16.831 --> 00:24:21.390
she's just pulling back the throttle and she's going to go as positive as she

396
00:24:21.391 --> 00:24:25.770
possibly can,
hoping if she puts this fucking energy out there,

397
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.620
something loving is going to come back to her.

398
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.850
It was one of the most uncomfortable fucking flights I've ever had and I was

399
00:24:32.851 --> 00:24:37.680
hung over and the more I was coming at her with my negative energy,

400
00:24:37.681 --> 00:24:40.980
like,
can you fucking stop smiling at me?
All right,

401
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.410
I just need some water.
Right to get rid of the throbbing in my head.

402
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.470
It made her pull back on the stick even more to the point.

403
00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.600
I think she went into a stall.
Um,
I don't know.

404
00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.430
It was one of those deals.
It probably,

405
00:24:56.431 --> 00:25:00.060
I'm sure she was completely normal and it was just the fact that I was so God

406
00:25:00.061 --> 00:25:04.650
damn drunk that uh,
or so hung over that um,

407
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:10.590
that her extra bubbly personality was coming across that way.
I don't know.

408
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:14.190
As always,
as always,
I was probably in the wrong,

409
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.790
but I'm too immature to admit it.
So with that,

410
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.590
that's the beginning of the podcast bill way.

411
00:25:19.591 --> 00:25:21.660
You are listening to the Monday morning podcast.

412
00:25:21.661 --> 00:25:25.810
If you just happened to walk by somebody's earbuds,
um,

413
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.500
I do one of these every single week and if you probably sitting there going,
hey,

414
00:25:28.501 --> 00:25:30.240
how do I support this podcast?

415
00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:34.980
How can I have help out this freckled content?
How can I do it?

416
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.020
This real cunt?
How can I not say fuck him and everything that he does?

417
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.860
Uh,
well,
this is what you can do.
You can go to the podcast page.

418
00:25:43.861 --> 00:25:46.440
You can click on the a pod.
Yeah,

419
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.680
you go to [inaudible] dot com you click on the podcast page and over on the

420
00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:50.430
right,

421
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:54.930
there's a banner for amazon.com and if you are thinking of buying anything,

422
00:25:54.931 --> 00:25:59.130
if you just go to Amazon through my site,
you click on it,
you go to Amazon,

423
00:25:59.131 --> 00:26:00.750
everything's still costs the same.

424
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.260
And I get credit for driving traffic to their site.

425
00:26:04.261 --> 00:26:08.250
They give me a little skim off the top.
I take the skin,
put it in my pocket,

426
00:26:08.251 --> 00:26:10.980
take a little bit of a skim out,
give it to the wounded warriors project.

So you helping me and you're helping the troops and you're helping America.

430
00:26:20.131 --> 00:26:23.910
hard copy DVD version of it off of the merge page.

431
00:26:23.911 --> 00:26:27.270
That's a wonderful thing to do.
It's a,
makes a great gift.

432
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.460
Makes a great gift.

433
00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.040
Christmas coming up for someone you really don't give a shit about.

434
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:37.050
You just want to spend 20 bucks.
There you go.
You're fuck.
Um,

Conti.

435

I'll see you next Christmas.
All right.

436
00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.740
And it makes a great gift I think at this point.
Uh,
for a hipster,

437
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.530
cause I know that they've moved onto cassette tapes.

438
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.080
There's somewhere in like cassette tapes right now.

439
00:26:49.081 --> 00:26:53.860
So eventually DVDs are going to be cool again cause it's not a blu ray and um,

440
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:54.743
you can sell it to them

441
00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:00.120
in a couple of years and then they can go off on their fucking bicycle.

442
00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:03.570
It's 10 feet in the fucking air for no,
no apparent reason.
All right,

443
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.320
a dollar slate,
shit,
slave dollar shave club,
everybody,

444
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.970
this is blowing up.
Everybody's loving this.
Even the ladies,

445
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.230
I think they are loving it when they shaved their legs and their private punch,

446
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:20.040
the dollar shave club,
there are so many things in the world that irritate me.

447
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.580
Things like you get your motorcycle license and everybody goes,

448
00:27:23.581 --> 00:27:27.840
it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when,
but it's you by his scooter.

449
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:31.710
Nobody says that to you.
They just call you a pussy,
you know?

450
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.660
Or if you're riding down the street and F or on a bicycle like that is even more

451
00:27:36.661 --> 00:27:41.040
dangerous than a motorcycle riding out in traffic,

452
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.000
listening to reo Speedwagon so he can't even hear the traffic around you.

453
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.220
Anyways,

454
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.130
there's a lot of things that you were taking me overly positive stewards is when

455
00:27:50.131 --> 00:27:53.460
I have a hangover.
When there are so many things that can irritate you,

456
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:57.000
why would you want to add raises to the list?
That doesn't make any sense.

457
00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.930
What do you say and bill,
I'm telling you through dollar shave club,

460
00:28:07.201 --> 00:28:11.220

All right,
back to the podcast.
You know,

521
00:31:41.951 --> 00:31:45.940
I mentioned in that I mentioned that whole thing about motorcycles,

522
00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:50.680
scooters and bicycles.
Now I look,
I know motorcycles are dangerous,

523
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:55.270
but uh,
how come?
Uh,
scooter's not dangerous.
What?

524
00:31:55.271 --> 00:32:00.271
Because it's some little skinny nerd riding the fucking thing or a celebrity

525
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:03.670
chef for some lady with a little ladybug helmet on.

526
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:08.620
All of a sudden get t boned by a fucking f 100 is an a problem.

527
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.900
I saw a guy today was on,
on,
uh,

528
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:15.340
was riding a bicycle in Los Angeles on a major fucking street.

529
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.333
All right.

530
00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:21.820
And he had his earbuds in listening to music and he's doing that thing where

531
00:32:21.821 --> 00:32:26.110
he's riding like eight to 10 feet off of the curb and this traffic behind him

532
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:30.600
having to slow down and go around them.
It's that to me is,

533
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:35.660
is more suicidal than riding a motorcycle in La without a helmet.

534
00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.790
I might be wrong,
but I'm just saying,
I know bill,
you just saying,

535
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:45.140
hey,
by the way,
we have some,
we have some fucking hilarious,
uh,

536
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:50.530
youtube videos that some listeners made about this podcast to fans made a

537
00:32:51.201 --> 00:32:55.490
youtube video.
Um,
two different fans.
Okay.

538
00:32:55.491 --> 00:32:56.390
One fan made one.

539
00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:01.190
It's a collection of every low GG that I said in the past year.

540
00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.910
Uh,
it's amazing and right as it gets annoying,

541
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:07.460
he always has it become funny again.
It probably,

542
00:33:07.461 --> 00:33:08.540
it's probably going to know you guys,

543
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:12.680
but it's like the amount of work that it took to put the whole thing together.

544
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.380
Um,
it's fucked.

545
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:19.220
And it might be something you want to get a little high and then listen to a or

546
00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:22.930
drunk or whatever and then call a pizza parlor and Kershaw your brains out at,

547
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.040
um,
uh,
we'll have the link for that one.

548
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:29.940
And the other is tech start of basically,
um,

549
00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:33.650
text and art added to me singing a song when I sang that song.

550
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:36.860
Do you know what it means to Miss New Orleans?

551
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.200
They did this really cool thing that,

552
00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:42.320
that once again made me laugh out loud and I don't,

553
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:47.330
I don't laugh about a lot of thanks.
You know why?
Cause I'm a sad clown.

554
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.930
Um,
so,
oh,
by the way,
I didn't,

555
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:55.350
the El Paso Gig finally happened.
Bump,
bump,

556
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:57.860
bump out up,
out of it.
Finally happened.

557
00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.460
I want to thank everybody who came out to that.
Everybody came out to San Jose.

558
00:34:01.461 --> 00:34:05.940
That was another great,
Oh fuck,
I forgot that story.
We,

559
00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:10.970
we perform there,
just a awesome crowd.
And at the end of the night,

560
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:12.560
we stayed in a hotel.

561
00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.300
We just had to walk a block and a half over to the venue.

562
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:21.500
So me and Bart Nica leaving,
right?
We had a couple of crowns when we were in a,

563
00:34:21.501 --> 00:34:25.200
the theater there and we're walking out and,
um,

564
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.040
we should have went right.
We went left,

565
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:32.240
we zigged and we should have zagged and what should we just start walking and

566
00:34:32.241 --> 00:34:35.450
we're just kind of feeling good cause it was a great show and we were going to

567
00:34:35.451 --> 00:34:39.630
meet a couple of friends to go have something to eat and uh,

568
00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:42.500
we're walking and we'll walk in and we'll walk,
we'll walk walking.

569
00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.920
And all of a sudden we went like 10 blocks and Barneys finds like,
dude,

570
00:34:45.921 --> 00:34:50.330
what the fuck is a hotel?
And I'm like,
I dunno,
it starting to rain.

571
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.780
And I got my fucking box of DVDs were walking down the street looking like we

572
00:34:53.781 --> 00:34:57.950
both just got kicked out by our fucking wife's,
you know?
And uh,

573
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.440
I dunno.
Like,
I just finally googled,
where the hell are,

574
00:35:04.441 --> 00:35:09.441
our hotel was on the smart phone and I realized we were like 15 blocks in the

575
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.941
other direction.

576
00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:13.790
We will late the people who wanted to meet us for dinner with texting us.

577
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:17.300
Long Story Short,
next thing you know,
I'm on one of those.
Uh,

578
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:21.320
we took one a bicycle taxi,
right?

579
00:35:21.321 --> 00:35:23.480
We took a bicycle taxi,

580
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:28.190
me and Barton Nick sitting there with a glass of crown royal each in a plastic

581
00:35:28.191 --> 00:35:30.920
cup.
I got my,
I had my suitcase,

582
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:34.440
my wheelie suitcase with my DVDs in it.
He has this seed,
these,

583
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.700
and we're sitting there riding this guy with a green Mohawk is riding us in this

584
00:35:38.701 --> 00:35:42.600
light misting rain and went drinking whiskey.
And it was fucking,

585
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.520
it was hilarious.
It was great.

586
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:49.520
The wind in our hair or what's left of mine and uh,

587
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.900
we've just sitting there laughing our ass off.

588
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.470
We couldn't look at each other in the back of this fucking bicycle,

589
00:35:55.471 --> 00:35:59.880
Rick Shaw without cracking up because it's kind of a romantic thing to do.

590
00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.930
And A,
I dunno,
it was just one of those things,
just laughing our ass off.

591
00:36:03.931 --> 00:36:07.560
Then we went to this,
um,
is pizza a pizza,

592
00:36:07.561 --> 00:36:09.420
this Italian restaurant,

593
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.660
a famous one where they have like career waiters.

594
00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:16.770
The waiters are unbelievable and they got like wear the jackets and stuff.

595
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:20.040
And uh,
I know I've eaten there before.
I want to say it was called Joe's

596
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.670
and I got a chicken palm.
It was delicious.
I was fucking delicious.
So

597
00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.530
<v 6>yeah.</v>

598
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:29.020
<v 0>Did I forget any other stories over then?</v>

599
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:33.380
The last night we worked at the celebrity celebrity theatre in Phoenix,

600
00:36:33.381 --> 00:36:34.214
Arizona.

601
00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:39.150
It was in the round and those are always just immediately amazing,
um,

602
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:42.500
shows and I got to send the videos that I took there,

603
00:36:42.501 --> 00:36:44.330
just the amount of people that have performed there.

604
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:48.800
George Carlin taped a special,
there is second one ever in 78.

605
00:36:48.801 --> 00:36:53.650
Louis C k just did one there.
Um,
Paul Mooney had worked there,

606
00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.730
all these amazing comics and then all these bands,

607
00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.600
Stevie Ray Vaughan and the instep tour,
miles Davis,

608
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:04.790
Liberace performed there the first time they could make the thing just the stage

609
00:37:04.791 --> 00:37:08.930
turn a little bit.
Um,
cream played there,

610
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:14.620
van Halen on their first tour played there was fucking insane Tony Bennet,

611
00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:21.520
all of these unbelievable names and then,
uh,
two jackasses

612
00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:27.140
from the Rosebowl gates.
So it was amazing to become part of that history.

613
00:37:27.141 --> 00:37:31.310
And then afterwards they have this whole lounge area with the entire staff hangs

614
00:37:31.311 --> 00:37:33.500
out and drinks.
And uh,

615
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:37.870
we was sitting there back in the green room and I was like,
I said,
you know,

616
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:42.880
I had some friends that came to visit a buddy of mine from back in the day and

617
00:37:42.981 --> 00:37:45.200
he married this woman from New Zealand.

618
00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.330
<v 6>Okay.</v>

619
00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:50.130
<v 0>And,
uh,
they came up,</v>

620
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.340
she had a 16 year old daughter from a previous relationship or marriage or

621
00:37:53.341 --> 00:37:56.280
whatever.
And they came up to us and they said,
you know,

622
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:59.970
we have a tradition in New Zealand that if a performer comes to town and gives a

623
00:37:59.971 --> 00:38:02.850
great show that we give them a performance back.

624
00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:07.020
And their 16 year old daughter came up and started doing this thing on the
table.

625
00:38:07.021 --> 00:38:08.910
I guess some people have ripped it off on youtube,

626
00:38:08.911 --> 00:38:11.730
but I guess this is the original one where they start.

627
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.520
She just done the tune,

628
00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:19.610
this whole fucking beat with this cup.
And then as she's,

629
00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.040
it's really was syncopated and all this shit just to keep that going.

630
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:26.760
And then she started singing this song about thank you for coming to the town

631
00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:30.570
and we're sorry that you're leaving.
And when she would get to the chorus of it,

632
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.450
her mother from across the room started singing the other harmony.

633
00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.650
It was one of the most pure artistic things I've ever seen.

634
00:38:36.651 --> 00:38:40.570
It was a paper Cup and two people singing and for half this,

635
00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:43.090
I was going to start filming it with my iPhone.
And I was like,
no,

636
00:38:43.091 --> 00:38:45.430
that's what's wrong with fucking everything right now.

637
00:38:45.431 --> 00:38:47.470
Why can't this moment just happened?

638
00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.990
And I can't just sit here and watch it rather than viewing it now through my

639
00:38:52.991 --> 00:38:56.230
phone screen.
You know what I mean?
So,
um,

640
00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.670
so that happened.
And then the last second I was like,
you know,
hey,

641
00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:01.520
they said that,
you know,

642
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:06.190
the staff's upstairs drinking and they brought us through the catacombs of the

643
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:09.670
place and all of a sudden you walk into like this Sinatra like fucking lounge

644
00:39:09.671 --> 00:39:12.100
and they're all drinking.
We all come walking in,
they're like,
hey,

645
00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:16.750
next thing you know,
I'm getting shit faced again.
So needless to say,

646
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.660
I'm back to drinking juice,
feast of famine right now.

647
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.320
So I'm juicing all day today.

648
00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:25.270
I'm even going to do yoga like a fucking twinkle toe over there.

649
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:30.160
And um,
I'm going to,
well,
I'm going to get my fucking self,

650
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:34.210
I'm going to get knock off the booze weight from this weekend.
So anyways,

651
00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:38.470
Jesus Christ,
if I run my mouth enough,
um,

652
00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:41.080
oh,
by the way,
is anybody,
uh,

653
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:44.950
anybody else kind of looking at,

654
00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.950
it's like when the government was going to shut down,

655
00:39:47.951 --> 00:39:49.900
I don't know about you guys,
but I was terrified.
Like,

656
00:39:49.901 --> 00:39:53.470
is there going to be anarchy is going to be beat People's storm in my fucking

657
00:39:53.471 --> 00:39:56.740
house with torches.
Like,
people hung from a,

658
00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.520
you know,
street lights and that type of shit.
Uh,

659
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:04.960
it's amazing how part of the government shutdown.
And like,

660
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.970
unless you work for him,
you don't really notice

661
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:14.500
why do we need governments?
Um,

662
00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.820
that would be amazing if they just quietly without anybody noticing,

663
00:40:20.821 --> 00:40:23.220
just stopped having governments.
And if nobody knew,

664
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.150
everyone would just sorta like still behave themselves.

665
00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.400
Would that work?
Well how would you pay the cops and all that?

666
00:40:33.401 --> 00:40:35.140
I don't fuck it though.
I guess it wouldn't work,

667
00:40:35.141 --> 00:40:39.250
but I'm amazed at how well it's working with part of the government shutdown and

668
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.420
actually saw some quote,

669
00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.630
I heard this woman say on the news that the Federal Reserve

670
00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:44.900
<v 6>okay.</v>

671
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.710
<v 0>Is trying to help out with the misbehaving government.</v>

672
00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:52.820
And that was one of the fucking funniest things I ever heard.
Um,
all right.

673
00:40:52.821 --> 00:40:55.090
And I'm not getting into all of that shit.
Alright.

674
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:58.220
Either know about it or you don't either agree with it or you don't.

675
00:40:58.221 --> 00:41:02.510
And I'm tired of fucking arguing it.
Alright,
one man thrill.
Right everybody.

676
00:41:02.511 --> 00:41:07.250
Let's get to the,
uh,
the letters for this week.
One man,
thrill ride.

677
00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:11.840

678
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:18.130

680
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:26.250
so I love this guy already.
Um,
you have to check out this video.

681
00:41:26.251 --> 00:41:31.230
A guy recorded it before returning to his Alma Mara to play the in the alumni

682
00:41:31.231 --> 00:41:34.540
game.
It's absolutely,
there's nothing you,

683
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:38.270
you can come back with after this.
It's perfect.

684
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.420
I wish I could hear Patrice has reaction.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Oh,

685
00:41:41.421 --> 00:41:44.270
I guess that was a youtube video.
What?
Jesus Christ.

686
00:41:44.271 --> 00:41:45.590
What a fucking intro that was.

687
00:41:45.591 --> 00:41:48.860
I have to watch this the way I have to watch it live.

688
00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:58.500
<v 7>Is it a campus university to relive his glory days at the 2013 Fitchburg State</v>

689
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:04.460
Baseball University?
Oh,
I'm not baseball game.
I'm in the parking lot right now.

690
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:10.330
Hammering a bacon egg and she hold the CI and preparation to go deep with

691
00:42:11.261 --> 00:42:15.740
foreheads and put on a laser show to the likes of which you have never witnessed

692
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:16.910
in your entire one.

693
00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:22.270
<v 0>All right,
I'm going to watch the rest of this.
I know it's going to get better.</v>

694
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:27.940
You got to have the visual of it.
This guy,
this guy's not fucking around,

695
00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:32.080
right?
I'm going to watch that.
How do you not love sports?
I get it.
I get it.

696
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.810
I can understand why you don't love it.
You know why you don't love it?

697
00:42:34.811 --> 00:42:36.970
Because you sucked at it.
But then you,

698
00:42:36.971 --> 00:42:40.330
you're not good at being a superhero either.
But how do you get into that

699
00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.850
captain America,

700
00:42:42.851 --> 00:42:46.570
we totally beat the shit out of the hole because he has that little sphere with

701
00:42:46.571 --> 00:42:51.400
the star on it.
Advice for young marriage.
Dear Bill,
uh,

702
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.740
love your stuff,
Yada,
Yada.
I'm in a pickle.

703
00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:59.080
I married when I was 18 to a 30 year old woman.
Get Out.

704
00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:01.240
<v 2>Okay.</v>

705
00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:05.620
<v 0>Get out immediately.
If you're wired like a man,</v>

706
00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.530
get out.
A woman is,

707
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.590
has more sophisticated wiring than a man,

708
00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:15.070
so she can be 12 years or younger.
All right?

709
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.080
I Dunno if they're more sophisticated,

710
00:43:18.081 --> 00:43:21.860
but different things motivate themselves themselves.
What am I seeing?

711
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.030
Motivate them.
All right.

712
00:43:23.031 --> 00:43:27.540
They're motivated by different things other than look at the dates on her.
Um,

713
00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.680
all right.
I don't.
All right,

714
00:43:30.681 --> 00:43:35.320
so when you're 38 she's going to be 50
all right,

715
00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:40.000
and you're going to walk into the bedroom.
I don't know.
That's,
that's a,

716
00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:42.730
<v 2>okay.</v>

717
00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:44.230
<v 0>Maybe I'm not mature enough to do that.</v>

718
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>

719
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.730
<v 0>Why am I super imposing my shit onto your shit?</v>

720
00:43:47.731 --> 00:43:49.740
Why don't I just read what the fuck you have to say.
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:49.741 --> 00:43:52.680
That was a real selfish moment there.
All right.
This guy is in a pickle.

722
00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.270
I'm married.
He says I'm married.

723
00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:59.010
I married when I was 18 to 30 year old woman whom I deeply loved.

724
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.850
I didn't get to that point.
I'm already telling you leave.
I'm sorry sir.
Anyways,

725
00:44:02.851 --> 00:44:03.420
he goes,

726
00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:07.980
I had low self esteem then I used to play world of Warcraft,

727
00:44:07.981 --> 00:44:12.630
be lazy and have a beard.
I am 23 now and I still love my life,

728
00:44:12.631 --> 00:44:17.160
but my life has changed.
I'm fit,
clean shaven and more successful.
Therefore,

729
00:44:17.161 --> 00:44:20.100
women are showing interest in me at last.

730
00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:25.170
My wife is getting older and I still liked her and a lot like her a lot and find

731
00:44:25.171 --> 00:44:26.640
her attractive,
attractive.

732
00:44:26.641 --> 00:44:30.960
But the age gap coupled with her bad pms is starting to affect.

733
00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.840
Yeah.
And that's not going to get better sir.
Like,
and she's still young.

734
00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:39.000
I already know where I'm going to go with this.

735
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:44.460
My wife is kind fun when not having pms and a good mother.
Oh,
you have kids?

736
00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:46.653
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

737
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:51.150
<v 0>Oh wait a second dude.
When I am around hot 18 to 25 year old women,</v>

738
00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:55.200
I feel like I can not control myself.
So far I have control of myself,

739
00:44:55.201 --> 00:44:57.870
but I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle.
What do I do?

740
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:00.750
My wife has seen the conflict within me and sympathizes.

741
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.770
She sometimes says that I can have some fun with other women if I tell her
first.

742
00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:09.890
But I don't know if this is true or if or is a honey trap.

743
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:15.030
Uh,
my,
I don't know what that means.
Uh,
my wife is honest,

744
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.390
but when emotions get in the way,
I don't know how she will behave.

745
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.110
Do I secretly cheap when I have a good opportunity to get away with it?

746
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.820
Do I talk to her about some freedom?

747
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:28.830
Do I leave her before the time bomb and implodes,
explode,
sorry.

748
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:33.120
Or do I knuckled down and masturbate myself into submission?

749
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:37.620
Having lower self esteem and missing out on fun,
but being a better husband.

750
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.620
Um,
oh dude.
Uh,

751
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.230
I applaud your honesty.

752
00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:45.640
<v 2>Uh,</v>

753
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.800
<v 0>listen,
you have to do what's right for you at the end of the day.</v>

754
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:55.500
I don't know if you add up though.
Are those kids,
your kids?

755
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:02.820
I Dunno dude.
Look,
I'm not trying to blame her,

756
00:46:02.821 --> 00:46:07.200
but what kind of a 30 year old marries an 18 year old man or woman.
All right,

757
00:46:07.201 --> 00:46:10.650
you're a fucking kid.
She's a woman.

758
00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:14.310
She married a fucking child and I'll legally,
you're a man,
but you're not.

759
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:16.380
And that goes the same thing.
If a guy,

760
00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:20.490
a fucking 30 year old man marries an 18 year old,

761
00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:22.260
like I don't know how that's fucking legal.

762
00:46:22.261 --> 00:46:25.350
Even though the woman is legal and she is a woman,

763
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:30.040
she's a fucking child compared to a 30 year old.
All right.

764
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:34.500
And just the,
the mental fucking tennis.

765
00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:35.870
<v 2>Okay.</v>

766
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:38.600
<v 0>That just how much further those are.</v>

767
00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.450
That's a huge amount of time in your life.
All right?

768
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:46.430
If you're 50 and your wife's 38 or you're 50,
your husband's 38,

769
00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:50.510
that's a different thing.
Okay.
30 to 18 is huge.
I mean,

770
00:46:50.511 --> 00:46:53.360
you talking like she's almost twice your fucking age.

771
00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:58.480
12 year gap.
You've only lived 18 years.
What does she,

772
00:46:58.481 --> 00:47:02.110
three quarters your age come on you mathletes what is that?

773
00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.870
All right.
I don't know what to tell you.

774
00:47:04.871 --> 00:47:07.600
If you already have kids with this woman,
I don't know what the answer is,

775
00:47:07.601 --> 00:47:10.990
but if those are her kids,
um,

776
00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:16.000
you're 23 so you've been married five,
she's 35.
She still has a chance.

777
00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:20.860
She's still young.
She can still go out and meet somebody more around her age.

778
00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:25.330
Um,
dude,

779
00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.160
you got married too young.

780
00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:32.510
You got way too fucking young to somebody.
Way Too old.

781
00:47:32.511 --> 00:47:35.090
That's what I think.
That's just what I think,

782
00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.270
but I don't have the feelings you have for this woman.
All right.

783
00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.450
This is just me on the outside looking in.
I am a commitment foe.

784
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:46.010
I am a psycho and I am a piece of shit when it comes to fucking women.
All right?

785
00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.790
And I've earned that in spades.
Believe me.

786
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:55.150
So take what I'm saying at a with a grain of fucking salt.

787
00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:57.470
All right?
Um,

788
00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:58.680
<v 6>yeah,</v>

789
00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.430
<v 0>you're talking about a 45 year old guy who never get married and fucked up every</v>

790
00:48:02.431 --> 00:48:03.930
relationship he was ever again.
That's what,

791
00:48:03.931 --> 00:48:06.990
that's what you're talking to right here.
Okay.
So

792
00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:14.260
I just know what I wanted to do when I was 23 years old and I was also iron man.

793
00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:18.020
I mean like 18 to 23 years old.

794
00:48:18.021 --> 00:48:19.520
You're supposed to be out there

795
00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:25.290
experiencing being young and,
and uh,

796
00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:29.360
and all that has to offer.
That's what you supposed to,

797
00:48:29.361 --> 00:48:32.240
in discovering about yourself.
Okay?
Now,
however,

798
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:34.900
if you married this woman and we had kids with her,

799
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:39.050
you do have a responsibility and that's a whole other can of worms and a can of

800
00:48:39.051 --> 00:48:42.680
worms that is not in my life yet.
So I don't know how to advise you on that.

801
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:44.120
<v 6>Okay.</v>

802
00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.400
<v 0>All right.
You know,
there are some things,
you know,</v>

803
00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:52.460
some things in life you do miss out on and sometimes you get this other great

804
00:48:52.561 --> 00:48:54.670
thing,
but because of that great thing you,

805
00:48:54.671 --> 00:48:57.090
you don't have enough time to enjoy this other thing.

806
00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:01.410
So you might be in that situation.
If you have fucking kids.

807
00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.340
I would say as somebody else who has kids,
ask somebody else who's in your boat,

808
00:49:05.341 --> 00:49:05.701
but look,

809
00:49:05.701 --> 00:49:10.650
if those are her kids and you got married at 18 and she's 30 and now you're 23

810
00:49:10.651 --> 00:49:11.700
and she's 35.

811
00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:14.420
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

812
00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.580
<v 0>I'm not,
I don't,
I don't know what to do that whole fucking,</v>

813
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:20.780
I don't know what to do.
Uh,
I would say get out.

814
00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:25.700
I would say get out.
That's what I would say.

815
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:28.270
I guess that's what I am saying,
but I,

816
00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.290
I don't understand whether you have kids yet.

817
00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.470
I don't know if you have kids with her and I don't know how,

818
00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:37.640
how deep is your love for that woman?
How deep is your,
I don't know.

819
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:40.630
You know,
um,
I'm,
I don't have enough information on that one,
sir,

820
00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:44.450
but my gut saying that you should shove it off to buffalo.

821
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:48.670
I feel you know what?
I feel they're responsible on that one.

822
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:50.890
I don't know that I gave you good advice,
sir.

823
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:54.970
I would ask around more so there's a jump off point.
My ignorant thoughts.

824
00:49:55.350 --> 00:50:00.340
All right.
Girlfriend wants me to take an STD test.
Jesus Christ.

825
00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.600
That was coming right out of the gate,
Huh?
How far are we here?
All right,

826
00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:07.120
girlfriend wants me.

stamps.com uh,
some small companies think leasing a Po,

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:22.220
leasing a postage meter is how business businesses get postage for their letters

Okay,
back to the podcast.

866
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:34.040
Girlfriend lady wants me to take an STD test.

867
00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:37.520
How your bill all right.
Right there.
I think you're from England.

868
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:42.080
Don't you guys say that over there?
Hi Ya.
Um,
so,

869
00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:47.300
oh by the way is I said Wales,
England a year,
a year ago,
a couple of weeks back.

870
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:51.590
There's separate countries.
I never knew I could never do Scott,
Scotland.

871
00:52:51.591 --> 00:52:55.300
It's own country.
You have it cause it's Great Britain,
Ireland fight needs.

872
00:52:55.301 --> 00:52:57.810
It's this fucking confusing and they don't teach us that shit over there.

873
00:52:57.811 --> 00:53:02.120
So Scotland,
Wales,
England,
three different countries.
There you go.
They all share,

874
00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:06.380
share the same island.
And for some reason they don't go to war with one another,

875
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:09.560
although I don't think they like each other.
And from what I've heard,
England,

876
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:14.650
they're the country whales are allegedly having sex with sheep and a Scotland.

877
00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:19.980
I Dunno.
They're like barrel.
They don't wear shirts and they'll beat the shit.

878
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.390
They'll head.
But you know,
headbutting is Australian.
I don't know.

879
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:24.350
You don't want to fuck around.

880
00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.510
You don't have to fuck around in any of those countries according to the movies

881
00:53:27.511 --> 00:53:31.080
I've watched.
Um,
anyways,
let's plow ahead here.

882
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:32.640
So bill,

883
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.940
I've been going out with this girl for almost five months and everything has

884
00:53:35.941 --> 00:53:37.050
been great so far.

885
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.820
We haven't had sex yet because she's a virgin like a virgin.

886
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:46.710
Um,
the last couple of times we went out she wanted,
she wanted to,

887
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:49.830
but we were both drunk and would just fool around and go to sleep.

888
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:54.240
I'm waiting until she is ready because I honestly do care about her.
Ah,

889
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:56.500
well you're a nice fellow.
Um,

890
00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:01.680
you're not putting any pressure on her taking out you fucking cock and balls.

891
00:54:01.681 --> 00:54:06.530
There's lean like,
you know,
can you help me out over here?
What,
Oh,

892
00:54:06.531 --> 00:54:08.540
you or what are you?
What are you here for?

893
00:54:08.541 --> 00:54:12.470
If you're not going to let you know,
you don't wanna be that guy.

894
00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:18.000
Uh,
but the other day she dropped a bomb on me.
Uh,

895
00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:22.280
she asked me to get tested for STDs before we had sex.
All right,

896
00:54:22.281 --> 00:54:24.830
well that makes sense.
If you're going to get into a committed relationship,

897
00:54:24.831 --> 00:54:29.510
eventually you want to remove the latex that you can get the whole experience.

898
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:31.850
You want to go on the whole ride.

899
00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:34.430
You don't want to stand next to the roller coaster watching it through the loop

900
00:54:34.431 --> 00:54:38.540
de loops through you.
You want to be on that fucker.
Um,
anyways,

901
00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:43.690
I have had sex with seven different girls and I always used to wear a condom and

902
00:54:44.031 --> 00:54:47.510
I always scrubbed my dick after scrubbing your deck after.

903
00:54:47.511 --> 00:54:50.930
I don't think that that works.
Oh wait.
They tell you to do that.
Right.

904
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.890
I Dunno if,
if you know,

905
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:57.580
if something got in yet,

906
00:54:57.581 --> 00:55:01.540
it's already and you're just cause you're washed the area where if you get bit

907
00:55:01.541 --> 00:55:03.820
by a rattlesnake and then you would wash the cut.

908
00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:06.790
Does the poison leave your bloodstream?
Hi,

909
00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.510
I'm an I'm not a doctor and I'm putting out weird fucking information.

910
00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:13.810
I should shut the fuck up.
Um,
anyway,
so he watches,

911
00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.270
he watches his dick afterwards,
but not as balls.

912
00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:20.950
I've been slapped it up against it.
Um,
she said that I could have,

913
00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:25.690
I could have an STD that doesn't affect guys,
but it affects girls.
Uh,

914
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:30.400
she's talking about HPV.
That's what she's saying.
He goes,
I said,

915
00:55:30.401 --> 00:55:34.000
that's bullshit.
And told her I don't want to talk about it anymore.

916
00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:35.410
<v 6>Okay.</v>

917
00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:39.050
<v 0>Ah,
Jesus Christ.
You are an enlightened man and now you've,</v>

918
00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.300
now you went into the cave men area and you know what?

919
00:55:41.301 --> 00:55:44.960
I'm not judging it because we all do it.
You'll be impatient.

920
00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:49.040
You weren't pressuring her.
You'll be in a Goddamn gentlemen.

921
00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:51.780
Then all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

922
00:55:51.781 --> 00:55:54.090
you took off the top hat and you beat her with the cane.

923
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:59.010
That Jesus' body weight.
Why?
Why'd you do that?
All right.
He goes,
I,
he goes,

924
00:55:59.011 --> 00:56:03.120
I don't know what to do.
He's like,
I don't have an STD,

925
00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:08.040
but there's a little fucking voice in my head saying,
well,
maybe,
uh,

926
00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:11.970
should I say fuck it and do the test or not?
Thanks man.

927
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.720
Much appreciated.
Love you.
Love your show.
All right.
You know the deal,
sir.

928
00:56:15.721 --> 00:56:16.770
Even if you wear a condom,

929
00:56:16.771 --> 00:56:21.570
there's a chance that you could have something and a HPV for the most part does

930
00:56:21.571 --> 00:56:24.820
not show up,
I guess in guys for what they say.
You don't really notice it.

931
00:56:24.821 --> 00:56:25.301
You have it,

932
00:56:25.301 --> 00:56:27.760
but you can give it to women and it causes them all kinds of problems.

933
00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:32.761
Which of which I forget what it does to them because it doesn't concern me and

934
00:56:32.921 --> 00:56:37.570
I'm a selfish cunt.
All right?
So this is what I would do,
sir.
Um,

935
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:40.330
I would just go out,
if you really give a shit,
go out and get tested.

936
00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:44.170
And what's great about getting tested is when it comes back and he got nothing,

937
00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:49.030
you can take those seven people and clear them off the board.
Like murder cases.

938
00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:50.960
You know,
if you ever watch the wire,
he,

939
00:56:50.961 --> 00:56:53.900
you get to erase them all off and you don't have it.

940
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:58.090
You don't have that caseload.
All right?
You can close those cases.

941
00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.820
They're not cold cases anymore.
You understand what I'm saying?

942
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:03.520
You've only had sex with seven people according to you.

943
00:57:03.521 --> 00:57:07.130
You always wore a condom and you washed your fucking Dick and your balls.

944
00:57:07.131 --> 00:57:10.120
There were not your balls,
just your Dick.
All right?

945
00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:15.040
So I think you've got a pretty good chance that you're all right.

946
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:19.110
And if you're only seven in,
this is a great time.
We get tested.
All right?

947
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:21.700
Cause then what's great is when it comes back and you're negative,

948
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:24.760
you know what you are,
then you're,
you're what's known as a red shirt virgin.

949
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:28.090
Okay.
You're in your sophomore year,
but you haven't taken any hits,

950
00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:29.440
if you know what I mean.
All right.

951
00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:33.070
So then that makes you want to be even more careful.

952
00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:34.790
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

953
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:36.650
<v 0>This is what,
why don't you do this?
Just say,
listen,</v>

954
00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:40.940
I got emotional because I'm afraid that even though I've been careful,

955
00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:43.630
I am scared that yeah,
when you have sex with some,
but he,

956
00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:48.590
even when you wear a condom you can still catch shit.
So,
uh,
tell you what,

957
00:57:48.591 --> 00:57:51.530
why don't we both go down and get tested?
We'll do it together as a couple.

958
00:57:51.531 --> 00:57:56.180
I apologize for acting like a caveman.
Um,
will you forgive me?

959
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:58.700
And there you go.
Then you both go out,
you get tested,

960
00:57:58.701 --> 00:58:02.900
you take her out for a little fucking a creme brulee or whatever the fuck they

961
00:58:02.901 --> 00:58:03.734
like to eat.

962
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:05.040
<v 6>Okay.</v>

963
00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:09.870
<v 0>And then you just sit there waiting.
Here comes the river.</v>

964
00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:14.370
Um,
and hope and the flop,
you,
we have fucking win the hand.

965
00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:16.440
That's all I can tell you,
sir.
But you know what?

966
00:58:16.441 --> 00:58:19.140
Eventually you're going to have to fucking know one way or another and you're

967
00:58:19.141 --> 00:58:22.770
only seven and this is a great time before you go down that road and you've got

968
00:58:22.771 --> 00:58:27.771
30 40 50 under your belt and you're just Jesus Christ thinking all this shit

969
00:58:27.961 --> 00:58:31.860
that you did and you're walking into that office with flop sweat,
okay?

970
00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:33.870
You don't want to do it all right?

971
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:36.270
I think it's a great thing to go out and get tested and I think your

972
00:58:36.271 --> 00:58:38.940
girlfriend's 100% in the right for asking you to do it.

973
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:44.160
I feel like your behavior afterwards was immature but understandable and you

974
00:58:44.161 --> 00:58:48.090
need to make things right.
All right,
go do your thing,
man up.
Okay.

975
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:51.780
Bully.
I can beat up.
All right.

976
00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.750
Well if there's a bully you can beat up.
He's not really a bully.

977
00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.200
He's just an asshole.
Right?
Hey,
Billy boy,

978
00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:01.770
I'm 15 year old lad from Australia in is my problem.

979
00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:05.390
There was a complete Dick head at my school that always picks on me,
but here's,

980
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:08.400
here's the twist.
I could smash the shit out of this prick.

981
00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:13.110
I'm 182 centimeters.
That's six feet tall,

982
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:18.090
fit 15 years old,
six feet tall.
He goes 74 kilograms.

983
00:59:18.091 --> 00:59:21.920
That's 160 pounds.
Few people keeping score and other day,

984
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:27.410
and he's about five,
eight and weighs about 185 pounds.

985
00:59:27.411 --> 00:59:32.210
All right,
so he's got,
he's got your bike.
He's got you buy 25 pounds,

986
00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:37.100
but you have the reach advantage.
This is the tale of the tape here.
I love this.

987
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:39.200
You've got a four inch reach advantage.

988
00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:43.310
Unless he has those fucking Kevin Mchale arms that are almost dragging on the

989
00:59:43.311 --> 00:59:45.320
ground.
All right,
you go.

990
00:59:45.321 --> 00:59:48.350
I lift weights every other day and he's just fat.

991
00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:49.750
<v 6>Okay.</v>

992
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:53.390
<v 0>All right.
You're definitely the favorite so far he goes,</v>

993
00:59:53.391 --> 00:59:55.880
but this isn't the biggest reason why I could smash this con.

994
00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:59.720
I have about 20 years of martial arts experience.

995
01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:05.010
Wait a minute.
You're 15 years old.

996
01:00:05.011 --> 01:00:09.980
How do you have 20 years of experience?
Oh,
he's going to break it down.

997
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:13.640
I have about 20 years of martial arts experience when you add it all up.

998
01:00:13.641 --> 01:00:17.630
I have seven years in karate,
five years in movie tie.

999
01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:21.500
Jesus,
dude,
you bring those fucking needs to that fat belly.

1000
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:28.130
Oh my God.
Probably got shins like a fucking street pole.
Um,

1001
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:31.370
Street Pole,
stop sign,
whatever the fuck I was trying to say.

1002
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.600
Just I pictured a telephone pole and a stop sign made out of metal and I came up

1003
01:00:35.601 --> 01:00:39.590
with street pole.
Look at that.
I'm inventing words here.
Seven years of karate,

1004
01:00:39.591 --> 01:00:43.840
five years in Muay Thai,
five years of Brazilian Jujitsu.

1005
01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:47.120
Jesus Christ standing up,
go to the ground.
What do you want to dope?

1006
01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:49.070
And three years of MMA,

1007
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:53.690
he constantly calls me name like gay boy and Poof.

1008
01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:58.460
And he slaps me in the back of the head every day.
Dude,
you can't have that.

1009
01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:02.480
Uh,
this has been happening for like two months now and I haven't fought back

1010
01:01:02.481 --> 01:01:06.110
because I'm worried about getting in trouble from teachers at my martial arts

1011
01:01:06.111 --> 01:01:10.610
classes.
Any advice as welcome?
Uh,
thanks for whatever.

1012
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:13.880
Whatever helps you.
Uh,
whatever help you can give me,

1013
01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:19.070
go fuck yourself and have a good day.
All right sir.
Well,
this is the deal.

1014
01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:22.490
You could sear if you actually applied what,
you know,

1015
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:26.300
you could seriously hurt this guy,
but you do have to defend yourself.

1016
01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:31.010
So is there a way that the next time he goes to slap you in the head,

1017
01:01:31.011 --> 01:01:34.400
you can put them in one of those fucking those holds.

1018
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:37.280
We're just holding the person's thumb and they're all of a sudden on their

1019
01:01:37.281 --> 01:01:39.320
tiptoes going,
all right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.

1020
01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:43.820
Is there a way to just shoot one across the bow?
That's what I'm suggesting.

1021
01:01:43.821 --> 01:01:47.900
I'm not saying that you fuck this kid up and then ruin your standing with,
uh,

1022
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.270
your,
uh,
your seafoods,
your Sensei's,
your,
your,
your pastors,

1023
01:01:53.271 --> 01:01:56.610
whatever the fuck you call them down to the Dojo.
Um,

1024
01:01:59.300 --> 01:01:59.481
yeah,

1025
01:01:59.481 --> 01:02:03.470
but there's no reason for you to go to school and get slapped in the back of the

1026
01:02:03.471 --> 01:02:08.450
head and being called names.
Okay?
So what I would do is,
uh,

1027
01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:13.220
oh,
what the fuck he asking me?
This is what you do.
Jesus Christ.

1028
01:02:13.221 --> 01:02:18.080
Here's your solution.
Talk to one of you,
your karate masters there,
and just say,

1029
01:02:18.081 --> 01:02:19.010
listen,
this is the deal.

1030
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:22.020
I know after everything that you've taught me that I could use what?

1031
01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:26.940
Mop the floor with this fet tub of shit.
But I don't want to get,
you know,

1032
01:02:26.941 --> 01:02:29.340
bad standing with you.
What do I do here?

1033
01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:34.500
Have them have them tell you what to do.
Cause they'll,

1034
01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:38.550
they could probably suggest they know the name of whatever that fucking

1035
01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.610
how to choke out somebody's thumb.

1036
01:02:41.611 --> 01:02:45.710
Whatever that thing is that you guys do that I wish I knew how to do.
Um,

1037
01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:46.850
<v 6>okay,</v>

1038
01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:49.770
<v 0>but here's the deal.
One way or the another.
Uh,</v>

1039
01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:53.360
there has to be a solution with this guy slap and you this slapping you in the

1040
01:02:53.361 --> 01:02:56.030
back of the fucking head.
Um,

1041
01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.650
<v 6>okay.</v>

1042
01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:01.270
<v 0>Do you do,
do you know how to do a death grip yet?
Have they taught you that?</v>

1043
01:03:01.271 --> 01:03:02.200
Is that an actual thing?

1044
01:03:02.201 --> 01:03:05.710
Why don't you do a double death grip to his man tits and twist them before he

1045
01:03:05.711 --> 01:03:07.480
has a chance to slap you when they had,

1046
01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:15.480
don't listen to anything that I'm going to suggest here.
Uh,

1047
01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:16.960
why don't you take some Twinkies?

1048
01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:18.820
<v 6>Okay,</v>

1049
01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.340
<v 0>well what,
what could you do with the twinkie and a martial art thing?</v>

1050
01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:26.320
Why don't you make some nunchuck Twinkies instead of slapping them in the face

1051
01:03:26.321 --> 01:03:30.490
with the,
with a piece of wood,
it's a,
it's a twinkie and it goes across his face.

1052
01:03:30.491 --> 01:03:32.920
He's humiliated.
Plus,
you know,
he's a fatty,

1053
01:03:32.921 --> 01:03:36.160
so he's going to have to lick it off his face and he'll get into that sugar rush

1054
01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:38.560
and his eyes will roll in the back of his head.

1055
01:03:38.561 --> 01:03:41.420
And by the time his eyes come back down,
you're going to be across the Roman.

1056
01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.900
He can't slap you in the head out of,
there's gotta be something.

1057
01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:45.290
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1058
01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:49.300
<v 0>There's gotta be something to do.
Uh,
I mean at this point,</v>

1059
01:03:49.301 --> 01:03:54.000
if you don't want to go physical,
I would just go verbal.
I,
you know,

1060
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.570
he's calling you gay boy and poof on me.

1061
01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.020
Why don't you just talk about his fat tissue?

1062
01:03:58.450 --> 01:03:58.720
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1063
01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.060
<v 0>Just at just be,
yes.
Used to be really sincere.
Just be like,</v>

1064
01:04:01.061 --> 01:04:04.810
just out of curiosity,
how much do you tits way,
you know,

1065
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:08.080
do you wear a sports bra or are you going to kind of go with the,
uh,

1066
01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:10.480
the giant pocket tee

1067
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.210
and the fact that you're already this fat and our young age,

1068
01:04:15.211 --> 01:04:17.720
like how fat do you think you're going to be when you're 40?

1069
01:04:17.721 --> 01:04:20.400
And these are just questions,
sir.
You know,

1070
01:04:20.401 --> 01:04:24.720
and then when he charges you like a rhino just step out of the way and he won't

1071
01:04:24.721 --> 01:04:29.400
be able to slow down and maybe go flying into some desks.
I don't know sir.

1072
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:34.260
But can you please tell me how this,
I,
I w I would go,
I would go to your,
uh,

1073
01:04:34.261 --> 01:04:38.190
your Dojo masters there,
whatever,
and I'd ask them what to do,

1074
01:04:38.191 --> 01:04:41.970
but there's no fucking way on any level that you should have to tolerate that.

1075
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:42.893
Uh,

1076
01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:44.890
<v 6>yeah,</v>

1077
01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:48.340
<v 0>yeah,
I would do that.
Ah,
Jesus.</v>

1078
01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:50.740
Are they going to go even really more mature?
Well,

1079
01:04:50.741 --> 01:04:53.140
I think you should talk to your teachers about it and then you become the

1080
01:04:53.141 --> 01:04:55.390
fucking guy ratted out.
You know?

1081
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:57.730
I just like that it's a selection that's like this uh,

1082
01:04:57.790 --> 01:04:59.770
solutions they come up to on like the view.

1083
01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.310
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1084
01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:05.000
<v 0>You just turn around and you just face stop doing that.
I,
I,</v>

1085
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:08.230
I'm not going to tolerate this.
You know,

1086
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.490
I'll give you like a rape whistle or something.
I don't fucking know.

1087
01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.180
I don't know sir.

1088
01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:16.900
But please let me know how that works out because it's bothering me that,

1089
01:05:16.901 --> 01:05:19.960
that is doing that to you.
All right.
I don't like bullies.

1090
01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:24.540
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Do

1091
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:29.450
you know what I really want to tell you to do and I'm not going to,
all right.

1092
01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:33.690
Divorce settlement,
a divorce settlement sheet.

1093
01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:37.980
Uh,
dimmers,
tuber.
I claim a suburb because I don't know you personally.

1094
01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.520
Please tell me if I'm a piece of shit for doing what I thought was right.

1095
01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:45.810
I will give you a quick summary.
Fell in love with high school sweetheart.
Oh,

1096
01:05:45.811 --> 01:05:49.170
that's tremendous.
Gotten married.
Good for you.
Rented a house.
Awesome.

1097
01:05:49.171 --> 01:05:53.910
10 year relationship.
Wonderful.
Two years of marriage.
Cool.
No kids.

1098
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:54.833
All right.

1099
01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:59.820
Came home to our town after a weekend with my friends in Austin to change locks

1100
01:05:59.821 --> 01:06:02.730
to our house.
Knocked on the door for an hour.

1101
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:05.160
Cops called on me.

1102
01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:10.161
Cops say the woman in the house says we are separated but married and I had been

1103
01:06:10.621 --> 01:06:14.850
bothering her by visiting her.
Her rented house too much.

1104
01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.160
Oh my God.

1105
01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:18.890
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1106
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:20.060
<v 0>When she opened the door,</v>

1107
01:06:20.061 --> 01:06:23.780
a guy in his boxers and socks came walking down the stairs.

1108
01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:28.280
As the door was opened,
I didn't see this coming.
Oh my God.

1109
01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:31.580
I own a couple of pawn shops.
My Dad left me.

1110
01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:36.020
My Dad left me with one and then I grew it into multiple locations.

1111
01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:37.820
I knew the relationship was over,

1112
01:06:37.821 --> 01:06:41.570
but we weren't divorced yet and I didn't want her taking half of my shit,

1113
01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:46.790
so I sold my company locations to my parents for $1 for tax reasons.

1114
01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:48.920
Ah,
that sounds like a good move.

1115
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:53.390
I then bought back the company for full money in my personal account.

1116
01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:55.100
We've always had separate accounts.

1117
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:58.310
Then I sold the company locations back to my parents for a dollar.

1118
01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:04.030
I think somehow I think somehow got demoted from the new owners.

1119
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:06.370
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1120
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:07.091
<v 0>Oh,
you left out a word.</v>

1121
01:07:07.091 --> 01:07:11.950
I think I somehow got demoted from the new owners from owner area supervisor to

1122
01:07:11.951 --> 01:07:14.380
pawnbroker,
which doesn't make much money at all.

1123
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.680
This took me about three months to arrange.
That doesn't make sense,
dude.

1124
01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:21.130
Then I sold the company locations back to my parents for a dollar.

1125
01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:24.460
She sold it for a dollar.

1126
01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:27.790
You bought it back and then you sold it again and he bought it back with your

1127
01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:31.990
own money.
I need,
I need to be a lawyer to understand this and he goes,

1128
01:07:31.991 --> 01:07:36.991
I think I somehow got demoted from the new owners from owner area supervisor to

1129
01:07:38.901 --> 01:07:41.450
pawn broker,
which doesn't make much money at all.

1130
01:07:41.451 --> 01:07:43.820
This took me about three months to arrange all this,

1131
01:07:43.821 --> 01:07:46.760
so I acted like I was trying to work it out.

1132
01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:48.540
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1133
01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:51.960
<v 0>So that she wouldn't want to divorce yet.
Needless to say,</v>

1134
01:07:51.961 --> 01:07:53.220
after it was all said and done,

1135
01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:56.610
she thought that she was going to get a hefty amount of money

1136
01:07:58.350 --> 01:08:01.650
when I actually think it was a pretty fair split.
Do you think?
I did.

1137
01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.470
What I did was fucked up.
Also,

1138
01:08:04.471 --> 01:08:06.750
I kind of found a way around the divorce settlement,

1139
01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:10.680
which is an old thing you brought up.
But still I'd like your opinion.

1140
01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:14.620
Um,
okay.

1141
01:08:14.621 --> 01:08:16.880
A loyal fan who says fuck those cons,

1142
01:08:16.881 --> 01:08:21.080
who follow you for 15 years and give up on you.
Oh,
thank you.
Um,
no,

1143
01:08:21.081 --> 01:08:24.590
I think what you did was genius,
you know,

1144
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:27.583
um,

1145
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:33.740
the way that she went about getting this divorce and calling the cops on you and

1146
01:08:33.741 --> 01:08:37.040
then that's on your record that,
I mean that was,
she,

1147
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:41.000
she kind of established the playing field,
you know what I mean?

1148
01:08:41.001 --> 01:08:44.690
It's one of those knife to a gunfight thinks she established the playing field

1149
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:50.570
and um,
and you played the game accordingly.
I mean,

1150
01:08:50.571 --> 01:08:53.390
I think the fact that you guys both,
it seems like he got married young.

1151
01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:57.770
Maybe she just didn't know how to break up with you in a more of a mature way.

1152
01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:02.570
So she kind of broke up with you mentally stayed with you,

1153
01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:06.380
began another relationship,
and then just when you went away,

1154
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:11.620
just drop the hammer and tried to do a one like a one stop thing.

1155
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:16.720
Locks are gone.
He's bugging me.
This is the guy in fucking Sia and you,

1156
01:09:16.721 --> 01:09:19.760
you get all that information in 90 seconds,
um,

1157
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.000
whatever.
So then you make sure she doesn't get the pawn shops.
I don't know.

1158
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.760
I think that's pretty fair.

1159
01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:32.210
And it sounds like she's young enough to build up her own empire and with the

1160
01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:35.720
cold calculated way that she dealt with cutting you out of her life.

1161
01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:38.600
I think she's going to do great in the corporate world,
so she'll be fine.

1162
01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:43.160
So fuck it.
You did the right thing.
Good for you.
Good for you.
All right,

1163
01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.450
wrap up for the show here.
All right.
That's it.
That's it for the podcast,

1164
01:09:47.451 --> 01:09:50.000
by the way.
Um,
I want to thank everybody who's been listening.

1165
01:09:50.001 --> 01:09:53.540
The listenership has been steadily climbing up and um,

1166
01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:57.380
and everybody who's been coming out to my shows,
um,

1167
01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:03.380
I gotta tell you I'm having more fun than I've ever had on stage in my life and

1168
01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:06.050
I really feel like I'm going through this growth period.

1169
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:09.300
I've been pushing myself this,
these things.
I've just,

1170
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:13.840
a few things I've been trying to work on in my act and uh,

1171
01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:17.840
it's like the spending like a three year process and I feel like I'm pushing

1172
01:10:17.841 --> 01:10:20.960
through right now and uh,
so I just,
I dunno,

1173
01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.330
I feed off the crowd so when you guys show up,

1174
01:10:23.331 --> 01:10:24.590
it's really been helping to push me.

1175
01:10:24.591 --> 01:10:28.010
So I just wanted to say it's actually something nice for once on the podcast,

1176
01:10:28.011 --> 01:10:32.840
so thank you.
Um,
and I'm off the road here.
After six weeks in a row on the road,

1177
01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:34.490
I'm off for the next two,
three weeks.

1178
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.820
So I'm going to be going around La trying to work on some stuff.

1179
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:43.730
Re a recharge my batteries here,

1180
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.270

Uh,

1181
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:49.130
whatever the fuck I'm going to do.

1182
01:10:49.131 --> 01:10:51.890
Watch some football and watch some hockey and that type of shit.

1183
01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:56.000
I'm going to chill out here for a few weeks and uh,

These are all on my website.

1189
01:11:14.941 --> 01:11:17.250
And then I also am going to be doing,

1190
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:22.440
I'm making up the last bit of the red state tour dates.

1192
01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:28.200
Oklahoma and a Wichita,

1193
01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:32.160
Kansas and a,
that's going to be the last of it.

1194
01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:35.730
So I make those up.
Is there anything else I'm doing there?

1195
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.070
I don't know.
All I know is I'm thinking of going to deadwood a day early.

1196
01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:42.151
In fact,

1197
01:11:42.151 --> 01:11:46.260
I know I'm going to go cause I want to see some stuff when I'm out there and a,

1198
01:11:46.261 --> 01:11:49.940
and then I'm going to leave early the next day before Oklahoma.
Cause other,

1199
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:51.990
the sooners have a game that day.
I'm going to try to make it,

1200
01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.130
unless the flex schedule makes it an eight o'clock game.
And,
uh,

1201
01:11:56.131 --> 01:11:59.730
and I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do in Kansas other than I'm not

1202
01:11:59.731 --> 01:12:01.980
going to say,
hey,
we're not in Kansas anymore,

1203
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:05.910
and look around and have everybody fucking roll their eyes like they haven't

1204
01:12:05.911 --> 01:12:10.020

I mean,
heard it 58 times a fucking day from tourists.
All right,
