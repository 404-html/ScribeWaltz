I'm in construction.
Oh,

All right.

21
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.570
Anyways,
it's not the one,

22
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:22.460
you think it was more recent and they evidentaly

23
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.960
from what I gathered from the writing was they were having problems with the

24
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:34.100
family.
Baggies,
sorry,
I'm going to kill this thing here.
Um,
anyways,
you know,

25
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:37.610
when you,
when you got fucking relatives coming out,
you know what the deal is?

26
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:41.900
You got to fucking clean your house up.
You know,
you,
you got to get all spiffy,

27
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.040
go out and get a haircut.
If you meet your shave it down,
right?

28
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.260
You're looking at him like,
Huh,
I'm successful.
I'll doing well.
Right.

29
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.670
You got to train him to all these fucking spots.

30
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.670
You've got to try to impress people,
you know.

31
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.430
Got It.
Hit me yesterday as I was,
I was scampering you know some,

32
00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:07.740
I don't do a lot scampering something.
Usually a marsupial does up a tree,

33
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:11.970
I believe,
um,
scamper around the house.

34
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:15.120
Just trying to fucking make it look like I don't live in a world of clutter.

35
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.490
And at one point I'm just saying,
I,
you know,
built,
nobody gives a shit about you.

36
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.260
Nobody is coming out to see you.
Nobody gives a fuck what you're doing.

37
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.520
It's all about sure.
Dot.
And I was like,
oh,
this is great.

38
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.540
This is perfect.
She's the headliner.
I'm just hosted.
Hey,

39
00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:37.590
how's everybody doing?
You want a burger?
Boom.

40
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.960
Let's keep this show moving right along.
Put the act.

41
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:42.720
Y'All came here to seek my lovely daughter.
That's all I got to do.

42
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.100
All you have to do is host to show those to show.
As long as she's cute,

43
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:50.220
which she can help.
As long as she smiles,
which she can help.

44
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:53.160
That's all she does is smile and laugh.
She's the fucking greatest kid ever.

45
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:55.530
I'll be fine.
So there you go.

46
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.330
Why am I trying to do all the dishes?
He always funny.

47
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.470
Oh,
you really do.
Whenever you have company over,
you have like that.

48
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.970
They've one fucking closet.
You throw everything in,

49
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.900
maybe one closet and every room you just take all of all of the clutter and you

50
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.540
just throw it into the closet.

51
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:18.340
Like for some reason there's this pressure that your house has to look like,

52
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:21.550
you know,
like a show room at a furniture store.

53
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.580
Like we don't have any knickknacks.

54
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.310
We are living a minimalist lifestyle.
Everything is neat and is in order.

55
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.860
Everything is in its proper place.
Harmony is what you're experiencing here.

56
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.590
We never fight is never a look crossword,
um,

57
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.470
day.
He can't live up to it.
So I just decided I got to a certain level of clean.

58
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:48.070
I'm like,
all right,
this is what it looks like.
You know,
what are you going to do?

59
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.520
Oh God,
I'm still nervous.
Anyways.
Um,

60
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.900
let's get down to the fucking tax that are brass here.
Uh,

61
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.380
but boy,
the city of Washington DC,
the district of Columbia,

62
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.010
oh,
they mourning today.
Jesus Christ.

63
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:08.520
I actually went to a sub Gabba with Josh.

64
00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:12.610
She had a Myers and um,
this is how big a hockey fan I am.

65
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.220
The Celtics were playing the wizard yesterday,
game five.

66
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:19.750
I thought it was game six.
I get lost with all the sleep deprivation from Oh,

67
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:23.650
cutie cakes downstairs.
Right.
Um,
and I actually,

68
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.830
we went in the cigar bar and we were watching the game seven and in between

69
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:30.910
periods we click in to the Celtics.
I know Bradley had a huge game.

70
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.990
I know that the wizards went up like four to nothing and then that was it.

71
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:39.790
We gave him the old right there,
Fred and kept a foot on their neck.
Right.

72
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.360
So that was the biggest night in Washington DC sports perhaps ever.

73
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.410
I had fun cause I woke up because I was supposed to,
um,

74
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.440
yesterday I woke up early by Doodoodoo dude and I was supposed to call 'em uh,

75
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.240
Regina,
Saskatchewan,
cause I'm going up there for some shows.
A,

76
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:02.340
I dunno what the fuck I'm going,

77
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.480
I think I'm in Winnipeg and then I'm driving all the way up to fucking
Saskatoon,

78
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.810
which is like an eight and a half hour drive and I'm doing it and is a good,

79
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:14.440
you know,
good book.
A bunch of farms.
I don't give a shit.

80
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.040
I'm going to have a great time.
He and Nick Craig,
we're going to go up,

81
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:21.850
there's gotta be some Soda Ice Cream store of some fucking stupid tourist

82
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:25.300
attraction along the way.
And even if there isn't,
who gives a shit?

83
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.240
I like driving that stuff,
seeing it that it exists.

84
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.180
I did the drive one time from California to El Paso,
Texas.
And uh,

85
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.210
it's one of the great drives of a dead,
especially I believe,

86
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.120
I don't know if it was in Arizona or in New Mexico when you just get into the

87
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:44.200
badlands.
I always thought the bad lantsman you know,
some,
you know,

88
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:47.440
bad ass dudes live there and it's just bad as far as like,

89
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:52.060
you can't grow anything that's like scorched earth.

90
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.160
It's like basically the direction we're headed.
If we keep fucking,

91
00:05:55.161 --> 00:05:58.640
and I don't know if you believe fucking Al Gore.
I mean,

92
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.590
I tend to believe a man who invented the Internet,
you know,
anyways.

93
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.280
Um,
so we're going to be doing that drive and uh,

94
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.980
so I had to call because they added,

95
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.040
they added another show in Regina because who the fuck ever goes to

96
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:20.030
Saskatchewan?
You know,
nobody.
So people are excited.
Like,
Holy Shit,

97
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.740
this guy's not my favorite,
but fee fucking showed up.
Let's go.
Right.

98
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.080
[inaudible] having problems.
We could feed him Uba keys.

99
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.610
So they added a second show.
So now I gotta,
I gotta put on my top hat,
my tales,

100
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:32.660
and I've got to fucking sell it.

101
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:35.330
So I'm waiting to call the radio if there's such a long story.

102
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.670
So I'm thinking in my head right now,
I'm like,
wow,

103
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:40.070
this is the biggest day in Washington DC sports history.

104
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.570
I should call the fucking sports junkies.
I'm going to do it.
I called in,

105
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.270
talked to larch and everybody get a,
I thought the capital's who's going to win?

106
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.440
I just thought how badly they beat the penguins in uh,

107
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.170
in game six.
I just thought that they,
uh,

108
00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:02.900
and they was shutting down their offense.
The penguins were frustrated,

109
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.113
you know,

110
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.810
I knew the fucking flower they was going to have what was going to have a good

111
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:11.570
game,
but I just thought they just needed to break the seal.

112
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.990
They had to get that one,
give him a little bit of happy feet,

113
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:16.240
give him something to fucking think about.

114
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.480
So I called in there and then he called and Randy a Bauman and Bill Crawford had

115
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:25.400
wd TV.
And uh,
I wasn't a content,
neither one of them.

116
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.530
My team side of it,
I'm not going to try to be a kill joy,
you know,
I,

117
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:32.600
this is the deal.
I actually,
I don't know what happened.

118
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:35.030
I used to hate the fucking penguins.
I don't anymore.

119
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.470
It's a combination that they don't really have any like overtly cheap fucking

120
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:40.640
knee breakers anymore.

121
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:44.510
And I got a lot of friends that either live in Pittsburgh or you know,

122
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.780
out here that are from them.
Fucking part.
Nick,
I can't root against partner.

123
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.380
So I will go to the cigar bar and I,
uh,

124
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.580
I'm watching it with fucking Josh,
Adam Meyers and he's just like,
you know,

125
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.220
I said,
look,
dude,
I'm not going to lie to you.
I hope you go one and one.

126
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.430
I want the Celtics to win and I'm going to root for the capitals.

127
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:05.300
I'm sitting here with you.
I'll fucking route for him,
you know,
secretly.
I'm like,

128
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:08.380
well,
if they don't win,
I'm happy for fucking Randy Crawford and Bart,

129
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:11.450
nick and those guys.
What,
what do I care?
I'm like,
fucking teams not in it.

130
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.340
So we sit there and Josh is fucking losing his shit.

131
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.100
And,
um,
it was just unbelievable.
You know,

132
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:24.890
I call him the flour all the time.
I forget his fucking name already.

133
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.450
Mark Andre Flurry,
what a fucking game he had.

134
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.870
They just,
Oh my God.
Fucking captive.
Just snake.

135
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:35.960
But even when they had the guy beat,
even when they had him fucking beat,

136
00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:38.330
they just couldn't get it on the stair.
They,
it was wide open.

137
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.720
I kick the fucking thing and he's couldn't do it.
They couldn't do it.

138
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:44.660
But I have to tell you right now,
game seven,
Nhl playoffs,

139
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:49.670
I will put that up against any,
uh,
any sport out there.
Um,

140
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.830
the NHL playoffs,
you know,
and I actually,

141
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.990
I actually totally missed the Edmonton ducks one because I had to go and I had

142
00:08:55.991 --> 00:08:59.410
to do a couple of shows,
and I thought I taped the game and I fucked up.

143
00:08:59.411 --> 00:09:04.180
I didn't someone have to go on the NHL APP today and Rewatch that game,

144
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.010
knowing full well that the ducks one,

145
00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.410
which I had a feeling they were going to do,

146
00:09:08.411 --> 00:09:10.170
I just thought they had a little more experienced.

147
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:12.160
They'd been there and that type of shit.
So,
yeah.

148
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.113
<v 2>MMM,</v>

149
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.730
<v 1>the fucking Josh,
Jesus Christ.
He was just like,
you know,</v>

150
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.860
by the end of it he was just like,
you know what?
Fuck this.
I think it was,

151
00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:22.790
I'm just going to stress,

152
00:09:22.791 --> 00:09:26.210
eat a fucking large pizza and I'm going to go home and watch cops.

153
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.000
Um,
I dunno,
having said that,
I still don't have confidence,

154
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.590
you know,
with the Celtics and the wizards,
I have no idea.
Like,
uh,

155
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.450
this is a weird series.
Um,

156
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.770
it kind of seems like the teams are going to hold serve,
you know,

157
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.310
and hopefully that happens and we'll win a game.
Seven,
I have no idea.

158
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:54.650
But just watching like a DC sports fan,
it reminds me,
I been,

159
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.920
I always have empathy for all of those people cause that was my life right up

160
00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:03.900
until basically 2004 gets a patriots had already won one at that point.
But um,

161
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.370
yeah,
that was kind of my life as a sports fan for the longest fucking time.

162
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.023
Um,

163
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.270
so my condolences to the city of Washington DC still got the wizard.

164
00:10:16.271 --> 00:10:19.750
You not out of it.
Congratulations to Pittsburgh.
Oh,

165
00:10:19.751 --> 00:10:23.830
this is going to kill me to say this.
Congratulations to Anaheim.

166
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.140
Whatever you are down there,
whatever that is.
Orange County,

167
00:10:29.141 --> 00:10:31.280
whatever the fuck that is down there.

168
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.653
<v 2>Okay.</v>

169
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.690
<v 1>I don't even,
I don't even,</v>

170
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.560
it's just one of the most soul is fucking places I've ever,
maybe not.

171
00:10:38.561 --> 00:10:41.380
I'm judging the place.
I always drive down there,
you know,

172
00:10:41.381 --> 00:10:42.730
to do the Improv of whatever.

173
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.363
<v 2>MMM.</v>

174
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.090
<v 1>Bought me hockey stuff down there.
They got fucking Disneyland's down there.</v>

175
00:10:49.091 --> 00:10:52.240
It's just,
I don't know what it is.
It just looks like a giant movie set.

176
00:10:52.241 --> 00:10:53.460
It doesn't look like,
um,

177
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.040
it's like when I went to San Jose and they had that little mall area where they

178
00:10:57.041 --> 00:11:01.040
had all that high end shit.
They tried to make it look vaguely fucking,
I dunno,

179
00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.770
European and he just like this.
This was clearly all built at the same time.

180
00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:06.790
And there's no history here.

181
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.180
I don't know what happened cause I read a Steve Martin's book,
um,

182
00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.950
born standing up.
I had the hardcover original version.

183
00:11:17.951 --> 00:11:20.980
I loaned it to my neighbor and I never got it back.
What a fucking asshole.

184
00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.810
That's still bugs me that I did that.
Um,

185
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.590
but he was talking about how he grew up in Orange County and riding his bicycle

186
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.400
to Disneyland past all the orange groves and just the way he painted the

187
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.170
pictures,
like,
wow,
that sounded like a beautiful place.

188
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.300
And now you go down there and it's just,
you know,

189
00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:44.350
one fucking strip mall after another.
I mean,
it was kitten hold.
I mean,

190
00:11:44.351 --> 00:11:45.900
human beings have done a lot of unpaid,
you know,

191
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.970
a lot of fucking lot of unprotected sex since then.
And,
uh,

192
00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.880
just kind of pushed the oranges out really.
Bill,
is that what happened?
I mean,

193
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.970
evidently
I bit down on the,

194
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:02.410
as far as I can surmise.
Um,
anyways,

195
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:07.120
so I did two shows last night,
did a benefit at the laugh factory and I did,
uh,

196
00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:13.450
I did the all things comedy network show at the comedy store and I had also done

197
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:19.750
a show Monday night where I ran the whole hour and at the risk of sounding like

198
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:22.890
a fucking bald,
arrogant cunt,
uh,

199
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.410
the new hour is crushing them,

200
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:29.920
having a great time somewhere in the,
during those Cleveland shows.

201
00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:32.350
It put me over the top and now I have confidence set up.

202
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.690
People aren't going to feel like they're getting ripped off when they go to see

203
00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:38.450
me.
So,
um,
anyways,
I don't know,

204
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.680
I got a bunch of fucking shit on my mind cause I got to go down to the fucking

205
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:46.080
airport.
I got to pick up some,
I got to pick up the fee and we bake east.

206
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.320
Um,
oh by the way,
my apology does to a moto GP fence.

207
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:55.120
I didn't even know there was a race this past week and I went on to my,
uh,

208
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.590
my DVR or whatever the hell you call it.
And Lo and behold,
there it is.
You know,

209
00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:03.790
and the way my laugh just watches whatever the hell she wants to now deletes it.

210
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:06.190
I didn't feel like I had to include her now.

211
00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:10.590
Like she likes motorcycle racing or anything.
So,
um,
I believe they were in spank.

212
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:16.650
I just sat there with my daughter and I watched all three races back to back the

213
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:21.310
moto to the three in the fucking GP race and they will all fucking great racist.

214
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:22.000
You know,
it's funny.

215
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.330
At first I didn't like moto three with their little skinny bicycle tires.

216
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:30.040
Now I'm fucking into it.
All three of them were great races.
The Moto too.

217
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.560
I think the model two was the one with the guy.

218
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.870
The guy in the lead fucking just dumped the bike.

219
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:38.500
He fucked up coming out of a turn.
Um,

220
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.590
and then the other guy who was just up to him not to blow it and uh,

221
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.400
I don't know.
I loved all of it and I'm just watching the uh,
the moto GP race.

222
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:49.360
All of a sudden it goes up to us.

223
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:53.510
I got a thousand CC's Valentino Rossi having probably,
Hey Mimi,

224
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.580
what's up?
How are you?

225
00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.960
I'm flailing over here.

226
00:13:59.961 --> 00:14:03.610
I got like another 60 minutes to go and I'm so stressed and I got to go to the

227
00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:07.630
fucking airport.
Then I'm all,
I'm all over the map.

228
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.070
Um,
Valentino Rossi,
that was so weird watching everybody pass him.

229
00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:13.420
He had problems with like his tires.

230
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.150
This is why this guy's the shit he's been doing it for.

231
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:17.680
He's been doing it for so fucking long.

232
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:22.420
I even know who this guy is and he came in 10th place.
Any still in first place.

233
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.350
That's pretty God damn impressive.
This early into the season.
And uh,

234
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.010
I kind of became a fan of that.
Johann Johann Zarko.

235
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.140
I like the bike,
all black and he just was fucking passing everybody.

236
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:38.410
He ended up being in,
I don't know when he's finished,
like fourth,

237
00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:43.030
maybe he's a French guy.
I liked the French,
you know,
I don't know,

238
00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:45.370
but I'm totally into it.
I don't know any of the fucking name.

239
00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:50.260
They know Mark Marquez,
right?
That's it.

240
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:52.380
I'm looking at all these other,
I've got them all a whole list here.

241
00:14:52.381 --> 00:14:54.900
I could pretend like I know these guys off the top of my head.
I don't,

242
00:14:54.901 --> 00:14:56.520
I have no idea who any of these guys are.

243
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:57.810
<v 2>Okay.</v>

244
00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.590
<v 1>But I will tell you,
I mean,
if you think racing is boring,</v>

245
00:15:01.591 --> 00:15:04.680
motorcycle racing is a good one to start with because,
uh,
you know,

246
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.890
if you're not into racing,
you want to see some crashes and,
uh,
you know,

247
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.160
motorcycle racing exists.
I mean literally the guy,

248
00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:13.920
he just imagine with every fucking stock car race,

249
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.430
every time there was an accident,
the guide like flew out of the car.

250
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.760
I mean,
I'm not sitting there saying I want to see anybody get hurt.

251
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:24.080
But I mean it is riveting.

252
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:26.190
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

253
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.510
<v 1>It's just fast.
First of all,</v>

254
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.920
the level of technologies of the suit that they can be going like 150 miles an

255
00:15:31.921 --> 00:15:35.670
hour,
lay the bike down.
You know,
they lean too far,

256
00:15:35.671 --> 00:15:37.680
they fucking hit their knee or some shit.
I don't know.

257
00:15:37.681 --> 00:15:41.610
What happens is that the handle bar hits the ground.
There's so low

258
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:47.190
and it causes the bike to slide out from underneath them and they go in like

259
00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.770
whatever hundred 30 miles an hour,
just slide in and big pop right back up.

260
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:54.590
<v 2>Okay.</v>

261
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.260
<v 1>Because the suits are made out of space age.</v>

262
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.270
You know,
it's funny when I was uh,

263
00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.920
when I had my brief motorcycle riding career out here in la before I smartened

264
00:16:07.921 --> 00:16:12.900
up and realized that a,
I'm not a motorcycle guy.
I am a fan,
but I am.

265
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.620
I just,
I was riding scared and everybody's texting is something bad.

266
00:16:16.621 --> 00:16:21.480
Was gonna Happen Man.
Um,
I,
uh,

267
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.400
I actually was going like trying to think of how to protect myself and I was

268
00:16:26.401 --> 00:16:30.540
thinking I was going to get either a Ducati or I was going to get that Harley,

269
00:16:30.541 --> 00:16:34.360
uh,
that throwback seventies one and uh,

270
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.810
I was going to buy one of those moto GP Seuss.

271
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.730
We'd probably going to cost more than the bike.

272
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.880
I thought it would be Larry's just to be riding a Harley wearing a GP suit.

273
00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:46.320
Do you look like the,
you're supposed to dress like,
you know,

274
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.710
you used to be in a biker gang.
There's something about being on a Harley,

275
00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:51.060
you have to wear like jeans.

276
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:55.650
It's like not acceptable to have the leather on leather suit.
Hello.
Lovely.

277
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.950
Hello,
handsome.
What's going on?
Another and I was just going to say,

278
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:04.850
you know what's even more boring than watching racing?

279
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.560
You just,
you just don't like it at all.
Well,
listening to you talk about racing,

280
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:10.910
it's probably more boring.

281
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.013
Wow.

282
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.870
Like four hours.
It feels like there's a swarm of killer bees.

283
00:17:22.871 --> 00:17:27.460
That's what it sounds like.
There's no like what,
how,
why?

284
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.610
You're just,
we're waiting to watch the crash,
right?
I was,

285
00:17:30.611 --> 00:17:32.860
I was hearing you from the kitchen.
Did you like,

286
00:17:32.861 --> 00:17:35.380
that's literally what year because it's so fucking boring.

287
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.800
Like that's the level to which like the boredom you feel when you watch it,

288
00:17:41.111 --> 00:17:42.640
like you're waiting for an accident.

289
00:17:42.641 --> 00:17:45.640
Like that's where your mind goes with dark place cause you're so bored.

290
00:17:45.641 --> 00:17:49.770
You're like,
what was it?
Someone just like crash.
No,
no,
no,
no.

291
00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:53.610
It's not boring.
God,
it's boring.
No,
no,
I was,

292
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.850
I was saying when you first sit down and watch it,

293
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.760
that's what you're hoping for because you don't understand what's going on.

294
00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:02.370
But when you,
once you start on just hoping for that,

295
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.080
nobody's hoping for it when they watch it.
Is that why people watch?
No,

296
00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:10.260
I'm saying if you're not into it,
that's why you would watch.
She'd be like,

297
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:12.690
well I'll see you in an accident.
I mean,
every likes an accident.

298
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.271
I mean everybody,

299
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:19.350
like when they see fuck somebody changing a fucking tire will cause four lanes
of

300
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.480
traffic.
People going,
oh,
the car going to fall on his head.

301
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:26.630
What's going on over there?
The rubber and hacking,

302
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.730
the most interesting part of the racing now that I've watched with you is when

303
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.520
is it Lewis Hamilton?
He's the champion.
Right?

304
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.780
He know a Nico Rosberg was the defending champion,
but his wife told him,
well,

305
00:18:36.781 --> 00:18:39.720
now that you win the championship,
it's time for you to pay attention to me.

306
00:18:39.721 --> 00:18:43.290
Any fucking retired.
Or he was like,
I don't want to deal with Lewis again.

307
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:46.560
And he just left.
Hmm.
Well,
anyway,
um,

308
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.250
him was it him that iced out his team mate and they were like,

309
00:18:50.251 --> 00:18:53.070
these two have it spelled and it over six months.
Yeah.

310
00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.120
It was like a whole days of thunder thing last year.
Got the tangible the Diet.

311
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.700
Yeah.
It is,
all of that stuff goes on.
There's the pride of the country,

312
00:19:02.701 --> 00:19:05.400
the Ferrari's,
the Mercedes,
right.
All of that shit.

313
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.190
And then once you get into like the different tires,

314
00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:12.930
when to pit the strategy of it and all of that,
it's amazing.
In this year.
Um,

315
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.450
the adjustments that they've made on the cars is way more passing.

316
00:19:15.451 --> 00:19:17.940
I'll tell you last year was it was a little boring where it's like,
what was,

317
00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:22.941
it was a race to the first turn we ever got to their first just held that

318
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:27.750
position for the rest of the race because you couldn't pass them.
Wow.

319
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:33.060
Riveting.
Well,
listen,
I'm going to go.
All right.
She's crying.

320
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:37.830
She's crying.
All right,
go get me.
I don't mean to trash your,
your interest.

321
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:39.150
I just thought it'd be funny to come in.

322
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.520
You don't find it interesting with him and with those motorcycles going that

323
00:19:41.521 --> 00:19:44.880
fast,
like the balls at that takes the fucking balls.
I don't,

324
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.230
I don't find it interesting.
No doubt balls,

325
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.940
but not interesting.
All right,

326
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.920
so you'd rather watch a bunch of balloon tinted whores screaming at each other.

327
00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.610
Yeah.
Neah Bay hill,
everybody.

328
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.330
There you go.
That's why that's that right there.

329
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:08.010
That is the fissure in our relationship.
That's the fault line right now.

330
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:08.581
You know what?

331
00:20:08.581 --> 00:20:11.910
At some point we're going to talk about the fact that you spend like hours

332
00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:15.600
watching people fight each other on Worldstar and all these other kind of

333
00:20:15.601 --> 00:20:16.201
websites,

334
00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:19.230
but then you want to come at me because I watch real housewives and people are

335
00:20:19.231 --> 00:20:21.030
already doing well.
They never get to the fight.

336
00:20:21.031 --> 00:20:23.550
Every time they about ready to fight a camera man breaks it up.

337
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.070
If those women would beat the shit out of each other,
I'd watch it.

338
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.370
If you just sit there and say mean shit to one another while somebody dabs at

339
00:20:29.371 --> 00:20:30.480
the rise with tissues.

340
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:35.280
It still bugs me to this day that that white woman spit and fucking Miss New

341
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.250
York space and they all did to her.

342
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.750
They owed it to her to give her a couple of fucking swings.
Oh,

343
00:20:42.751 --> 00:20:45.030
the way she did the about face,
like that was the end of it.

344
00:20:45.031 --> 00:20:49.200
After she spit in somebody's face.
True.
They should have let her beat her ass.
Oh,

345
00:20:49.201 --> 00:20:52.870
there you go.
That's why I don't like reality TV pop off

346
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.100
all of them like she down by that.
It just,
it drives me nuts.
It's like,

347
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.850
you know where to ignore reality TV's.
It's just like fucking,

348
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.330
it's like blue balls the whole time he comes to fight,

349
00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:08.970
he comes to fight this starting to swing.
I'll bring it up,
break it up,

350
00:21:08.971 --> 00:21:13.800
break it up.
The tension just keeps building and it never happens.
It's like,

351
00:21:13.801 --> 00:21:17.910
you know when there's a big fucking UFC fight coming up,
right?

352
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:21.480
Imagine if it just kept running the promo and Joe Rogan just kept getting more

353
00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:26.370
and more amped up about how great the fight was going to be and then it never

354
00:21:26.371 --> 00:21:29.860
happened.
Right.
As they went to fight,
Dana white comes out,
hey,

355
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:31.860
it will be enough for that.
That'll be enough for that.

356
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:36.420
And then you had to deal with the two fighters fucking talking to the camera.

357
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.370
I just felt like for me,
I wanted to have a fight to decided,

358
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.020
but you know for me.

359
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:50.410
All right,
I'm sorry.
Let's,
let's read a little bit.
That's,

360
00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:53.400
that is the number one fucking expression in reality TV.

361
00:21:53.401 --> 00:21:56.610
I know I say it all the time.
I just feel like for me,

362
00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.680
<v 3>for me,
I just feel like for me,
that for me,
I need to like,</v>

363
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.190
I need to just do that,
but I,
I'm not doing it for her.

364
00:22:05.191 --> 00:22:07.290
I'm doing it for me.

365
00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.810
<v 1>Um,
all right,
let's,
uh,
let's do a little bit of the,
uh,</v>

He says somebody into fashion.

376
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.550

Get them before the fucking fall.

426
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:11.140
Jump on your motorcycle slide across to track Gill Shit.
Your pitch.

427
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:16.540
And that is that.

Is it underwear or a teddy bear?

437
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.410
They're the softest underwear.
I don't know.

444
00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:21.060
Why?
Why would you be subtly for that?
You know,

445
00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:24.630
isn't it enough that some poor bastard had to sell those things together and

446
00:27:24.631 --> 00:27:26.040

This is the night game.
The one I was telling you about day B,

533
00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:54.870
which is a band that he's playing and playing a,
uh,

534
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.040
sorta eighties pop thing with the 2017 flare.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:08.510
I've been telling you guys that I saw him live and have you been listening to
me?

Um,
as a little background,

565
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:52.560
I'm getting married next month to my fiance who was wonderful love of my life

566
00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:56.400
and all that.
We were visiting her family last night and playing board games,

567
00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:00.990
which we often do.
Oh Jesus.
Oh,
what happened?
Were you drinking?

568
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.190
Did you get competitive?

569
00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:03.890
<v 2>Huh?</v>

570
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:07.820
<v 1>She accuse her mom of cheating.
Uh,
he goes,
I'll spare you the details,</v>

571
00:36:07.821 --> 00:36:10.580
but we were playing a card game with a bunch of characters.

572
00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.620
Everyone gets the same people,

573
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:17.090
but when you use them is really the key to the game.

574
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:22.190
There was a particularly powerful card I had held onto until the very last stage

575
00:36:22.191 --> 00:36:26.450
of the game.
The character's name was granny water.

576
00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.813
<v 2>MMM.</v>

577
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:31.010
<v 1>Pronounced Gary Water.</v>

578
00:36:31.011 --> 00:36:35.150
I gave you the pronunciation and accent so you wouldn't fuck it up.

579
00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:39.240
Well it is spelled w Ata.
Granny.
Why?

580
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:41.250
<v 2>Okay.</v>

581
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:45.120
<v 1>Well it's the last round of the game and everyone's going around revealing their</v>

582
00:36:45.121 --> 00:36:49.290
card.
I was last and my plan had worked perfectly as I went.

583
00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:50.480
<v 2>Okay.</v>

584
00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.590
<v 1>To reveal it.
My inner bill bird took over and I really got excited.</v>

585
00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:59.390
I flipped it over.
Oh,
you did it?
He goes,
oh no.
Oh No.

586
00:36:59.391 --> 00:37:02.870
He goes,
I said,
it's granny fucking war.

587
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:11.220
Then when you drop the f bomb,
Oh my God,

588
00:37:11.221 --> 00:37:15.760
I wish I had podcast tee shirts.
I'd send one to you.
No,

589
00:37:15.761 --> 00:37:19.870
you did.
He goes,
silence followed as an echo through the house.

590
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.290
My fiance's family were stunned.

591
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:24.510
<v 2>Okay.</v>

592
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:27.630
<v 1>They're not super uptight people,
but people just don't,</v>

593
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.840
just don't throw fucks around during a board game.
You know?

594
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.090
From there it only got worse.

595
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:37.440
My fiance has listened to your podcast so she knows I was imitating you.

596
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:42.780
She tried to stammer out an explanation or no,
she had to explain a way,

597
00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:43.740
your behavior.

598
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.270
<v 2>Ah Dude.</v>

599
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:53.000
<v 1>He goes,
but it didn't really do anything.
I also tried to apologize sheepishly.</v>

600
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.770
Then on top of that,

601
00:37:54.771 --> 00:37:59.180
that move gave me enough points to win the game over everyone.

602
00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:03.260
So I had to awkwardly mark my score,
which made me the winner.

603
00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.293
<v 2>Wow.
Dude.</v>

604
00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:08.920
<v 1>Oh,
when you're getting married next month.</v>

605
00:38:08.921 --> 00:38:12.880
So the fucking taste of this is still going to be in their mouth.
He goes,

606
00:38:12.881 --> 00:38:17.320
we left almost immediately after.
And of course I got yelled at all the way home.

607
00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.350
I knew I deserved it,
so I didn't even put up much of a fight.

608
00:38:20.351 --> 00:38:22.540
That's your first good move in this story.

609
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

610
00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:24.761
<v 1>Oh Wow.
He goes,</v>

611
00:38:24.761 --> 00:38:29.710
my question is do I try and go out of my way to remedy the situation or do I

612
00:38:29.711 --> 00:38:32.380
just hope everyone forgets about it and moves on?

613
00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:34.330
We're getting married in six weeks,

614
00:38:34.331 --> 00:38:37.230
so it's not like can avoid them for very long.
Um,

615
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:40.450
first because I fucking crush the impression too.

616
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:44.470
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.

617
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.840
Sorry for the Hillary Clinton referencing the opener.
I think she's a cunt to,
uh,

618
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.340
I don't think she's a contractor.
Just don't think she's an honest person.

619
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.090
And I don't think just because of the fact that we've never had a woman

620
00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:00.480
president that that's reason enough to elect someone is dishonest and as phony

621
00:39:00.851 --> 00:39:05.740
as her.
Um,
anyways,
though,
you know what,
I would,

622
00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.890
I would actually,
uh,
without your wife.

623
00:39:08.891 --> 00:39:11.980
I would just drive over there and just say,
listen,
I got to apologize.

624
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.200
I listened to this podcast.
I'm a big fan of the guy.
Um,

625
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:19.660
I was making a joke and in the moment I didn't realize that you guys didn't

626
00:39:19.661 --> 00:39:23.170
listen to the podcast if you want and just kept queue up a clip.

627
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:25.960
Well you have it,
which might be a bad thing to do,

628
00:39:25.961 --> 00:39:30.340
but like just have me like saved something else.

629
00:39:30.341 --> 00:39:34.690
Dr cabbies,
easy shave butter.
But then you might be fuck cause I don't say fuck.

630
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.513
<v 2>MMM.</v>

631
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.870
<v 1>Just say,
just tell him you're really embarrassed or whatever.</v>

632
00:39:40.871 --> 00:39:43.390
I think if you went over there by yourself,
I think a,

633
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:48.960
especially her dad,
cause I think that's the big one there.

634
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:53.190
I think there's,
there's something extra when it's,
you know,

635
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.490
<v 2>okay.</v>

636
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:55.680
<v 1>It's always extra.
Yeah.</v>

637
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.970
<v 2>Okay.</v>

638
00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:59.430
<v 1>You know when,
when you're getting married like a,</v>

639
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:00.640
<v 2>okay.</v>

640
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.750
<v 1>You know,
if you're a guy,
you know the,
the,</v>

641
00:40:02.751 --> 00:40:07.040
the dad's going to be looking at you twice as hard and the mom,
she'll be like,

642
00:40:07.041 --> 00:40:08.770
oh,
he's knows Rolex,
you know?

643
00:40:08.771 --> 00:40:12.820
And then the other way around is if you know they have a son and he brings it a

644
00:40:12.821 --> 00:40:13.570
woman around,

645
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.480
like the mother's going to be fucking looking at her to see if she's a fucking,

646
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:20.140
you know,
an evil little whore.
You know,

647
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.720
the dad's going to be looking at you like,

648
00:40:21.721 --> 00:40:25.210
is this guy going to be overbearing and slap my fucking daughter or right.

649
00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:29.830
Or whatever.
You know what I mean?
See a piece of shit,
right.
Um,
oh my God.

650
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:31.353
Wow.

651
00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.790
You said it's granny fucking water.

652
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:42.100
Oh God.
Dude.
If you film that,
oh my God.

653
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:44.170
<v 2>Okay.</v>

654
00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:48.850
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
Dude,
I got to give,
if I got it might tip of the cap for you there,</v>

655
00:40:48.851 --> 00:40:50.830
man for doing that.
Holy Shit.

656
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:56.440
I'm getting uncomfortable just thinking about that.
Well,
can I,
I'll apologize.

657
00:40:56.441 --> 00:40:59.410
Can I apologize to your fiance for being a bad fucking a,

658
00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.330
a bad influence.
Hey,
you know what?
Play this to play this to you,
your,

659
00:41:05.331 --> 00:41:10.220
your future in laws,
dear future in laws.
Hello,
I'm bill burr.

660
00:41:10.221 --> 00:41:11.750
I'm the one who says,
granny.

661
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.500
I say this type of stuff.
I've been the bad influence.
Don't be mad at him.

662
00:41:18.501 --> 00:41:22.610
I'm sure he's a wonderful human being.
I'm sorry you messed up.
He messed up.

663
00:41:22.611 --> 00:41:26.450
You're a little kid game there.
Um,
yeah,

664
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:31.130
he's got to make a great son in life.
You know why?
Cause he uses Dr cabbies.

665
00:41:31.131 --> 00:41:35.570
Easy.
Shame.
Don't play that to them.

666
00:41:35.571 --> 00:41:38.540
That's not going to get yet.
I'm just gonna say he listens to morons.

667
00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:40.850
He must be a moron.
Are they going to have half a moron?

668
00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:43.523
<v 5>Okay.</v>

669
00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:51.820
<v 1>And uh,
this is not the Monday morning podcast.
This is the replacement.</v>

670
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:57.110
Yeah.
For the podcasts that I fucking made yesterday.

671
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.821
Uh,
you're not completely this.

672
00:43:00.821 --> 00:43:03.580
I already tried to fucking do this and I just been talking for fucking 20

673
00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:05.410
minutes and I looked down and I wasn't recording.

674
00:43:05.411 --> 00:43:08.290
So this is actually the third fucking time I'm trying to do this.

675
00:43:08.291 --> 00:43:13.090
So I'm going to get right to the point on what the fuck is going on in my life

676
00:43:13.091 --> 00:43:16.990
right now.
Uh,
kind of like,
you know,
when you break your arm for the first time,

677
00:43:16.991 --> 00:43:19.990
you tell the story,
you got every fucking detail,
right?

678
00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.900
Then the next time you tell it,
there's a little less detail.

679
00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:27.370
And then by the fifth time he had just pissed and you want to smash a cast over

680
00:43:27.371 --> 00:43:31.890
the fucking person who asked you,
how'd you break your arm dude?
Y'All do,
do,

681
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:37.030
what'd you do that for?
Did it hurt?
All right,

682
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:41.850
this is what happened.
I recorded a podcast on Monday.
All right.

683
00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.680
And um,

684
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:47.640
I was actually really excited because somebody sent me this really cool MP3 that

685
00:43:47.641 --> 00:43:50.970
they had made where it was an amalgam of,
uh,

686
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.720
all the podcasts I'd done in the background,
you know,
in the past.
I mean,

687
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:58.590
you know,
just made this really cool like 92nd thing.
So I was like,
you know,

688
00:43:58.591 --> 00:43:59.161
that's awesome.

689
00:43:59.161 --> 00:44:02.130
This is going to be a great new thing that I can add to the podcast.
Right.

690
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:06.660
Start it off with my little 16 year old chick flip flown,
you know,
cell phone,

691
00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.410
those awful podcast.
And I bought the Olympics ls 10.

692
00:44:10.411 --> 00:44:13.050
Then I got a mixer and a microphone.
You know,

693
00:44:13.051 --> 00:44:14.370
and you guys are probably sitting there going,

694
00:44:14.371 --> 00:44:18.600
how the fuck can he take this to what?
To an even higher level.
There's no way.

695
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:24.160
Yeah.
And I was about ready to go.
Like,
yeah,
there is a way you mother fuckers,

696
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:28.000
I'm going to fucking have MP three of the week and started having people send me

697
00:44:28.001 --> 00:44:31.380
in these mp3s and I fucking put it into garage band.

698
00:44:31.381 --> 00:44:34.490
I edited the whole thing in and I turned it into a fucking MP three.

699
00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:38.100
For some reason Ge cast is not taking it.
I don't know what's going on,

700
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:43.410
but uh,
you know,
I'm sure it's me,
so always ends up being me.

701
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:48.020
So I'm going to figure out how to do that.
And uh,

702
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:50.790
in the meantime,
I will tell you a quick story.

703
00:44:50.791 --> 00:44:54.660
This is only going to be like a 20 minute podcast,
um,

704
00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:58.350
of what I'm dealing with in my life right now.
I,
uh,
I got a dog,

705
00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:03.210
I'm just pausing right now waiting for all the animal lovers out there to stop

706
00:45:03.211 --> 00:45:04.920
going.
Oh my God,

707
00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:11.490
it's going to be so good for him.
That keys can be so good for him.
Um,

708
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:15.660
yeah,
it has been good except for,
you know,
a number of things.
One,

709
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.430
I didn't pick out the dog.
I was on the road.
This was a typical female thing,

710
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:24.540
you know,
her heart was in a good place.
She's like,
you know,

711
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.560
he wants to get a dog.
He just doesn't know how to do it cause he wasn't hugged,

712
00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:33.420
are loved as a child.
So I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm going to go,
I go,
okay,

713
00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.600
a little fuzzy Yz dog and I'm just going to have it here and I'm going to

714
00:45:36.601 --> 00:45:38.580
surprise or whatever the fuck she was thinking.
Right?

715
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:43.830
So basically I'm on the road and it's typical how women do shit like this.

716
00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:47.970
Okay.
I don't know what they call it.
Like,
you know,
uh,

717
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:52.610
finagling manipulation,
whatever the,
whatever the euphemism is,
it's,

718
00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:57.690
they lie to you,
you know,
and they tell you in bits and pieces,

719
00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:01.590
what the fuck is really going on?
This is,

720
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:06.520
this is how she did it.
She left a message and she said,
hey honey,
it's me.
Um,

721
00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:10.800
I did something.
And it involves both of us.
Um,
but don't worry,

722
00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:12.440
I think you're going to like it.
Actually.
You're going to love it.

723
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.670
You're going to love it.
Just call me and tell you what to do.
That's okay.
Bye.

724
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.310
Click right.
Call her up.
And she says,
listen,

725
00:46:17.311 --> 00:46:21.870
a friend of a friend of mine has a dog and she needs us to watch it for a week.

726
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:24.480
And I was like,
perfect.
That is awesome.

727
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:28.350
I'm a commitment phobe one week,
you know,

728
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:33.570
that works perfectly for me.
So,
uh,
I go,
yeah,
fuck it.

729
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:36.870
Let's get it right.
And she goes,
great.
Awesome Greg.
The only be here for a week,

730
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:41.370
you know,
I'm like,
cool.
Next phone call.
Yeah.
So anyways,
I got the dog.

731
00:46:41.371 --> 00:46:45.090
She's so cute.
Above,
above Ba.
Yeah.

732
00:46:45.091 --> 00:46:48.090
And we keep it for a week and at the end of the week if we want to keep it,

733
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.660
we can have it.
And if not,
they take it to a shelter and it gets put down.

734
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:57.660
And I'm like,
what?
What?
Wait,
wait,
what?
You just got to sit dog.

735
00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.440
Right?
She got a rescue dog.

736
00:47:01.441 --> 00:47:05.250
The exact thing I've been making fun of in my act that the joke I did on Conan

737
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:10.160
that got me all that mail from all the dog lovers.
And uh,

738
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:14.230
not only that,
it's a pit bull.
Isn't that great?
Huh?

739
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.210
I'm just waiting for it to be like,
dude,
what are you?

740
00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:20.010
Do you fucking mind you already fuck I'm on fucking took who's spoken dogs too.

741
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.510
I'm telling you the fucking loyal dude,

742
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:24.930
but I'm telling you one day you look the other way.
They did.

743
00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:28.800
They just fucking snap do.
One time I heard about this guy,
there was this guy,

744
00:47:28.801 --> 00:47:32.320
right dude,
there was this guy and he got a pit bull right?

745
00:47:32.321 --> 00:47:34.780
There was this guy and he had a pit bull shut up.

746
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:37.510
So anyways,

747
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:41.560
we've got this fucking pitbull and evidently they found it down by the La River

748
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:46.990
and uh,
it's a fucking awesome doc.
I can't even,
I can't even lie to you.

749
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:51.820
It's a fucking great dog.
It's a scary looking dog.
I'm not going to lie to you.

750
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:56.020
It looks like it wasn't by the La River was more by the fucking river.
Haiti's,

751
00:47:56.890 --> 00:48:00.610
it's definitely looks like a hell hound,
but it is a fucking sweetheart.

752
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:06.760
And uh,
you know,
by the second day,
I love the thing.
I'm like,

753
00:48:06.761 --> 00:48:09.880
fuck this.
We're keeping it.
I loved it.
I walk it down the street,

754
00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:12.890
people cross the street.
It's great.
It's fucking great.

755
00:48:12.891 --> 00:48:15.220
It's like having a gun that,
that you can pet.

756
00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.770
It's a fucking awesome dog.

757
00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.460
And uh,
you know,
I've had other dogs have charged it.

758
00:48:28.461 --> 00:48:32.400
It hasn't freaked out yet.
You know,
it's going to freak out to fucking time bomb.

759
00:48:32.401 --> 00:48:36.460
I'm out of my mind.
I should give this dog back.
I'm out of my fucking mind.

760
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:39.340
This you just know there's a lawsuit at the end of this.

761
00:48:39.341 --> 00:48:41.380
The only way it ends with a pit bull.

762
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:46.840
It ends with a lawsuit in a missing limb and a second cousin that never talks to

763
00:48:46.841 --> 00:48:47.560
you again.

764
00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.830
And the only time you see him is when he drives down the street and his fucking

765
00:48:50.831 --> 00:48:53.740
custom El Camino that he bought with the 50 grand you gave him.

766
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:57.070
And he gives you the finger.
He takes his one arm off the steering wheel,

767
00:48:57.071 --> 00:49:02.071
gives you the fucking finger and continues on down the street and is lime green

768
00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:07.150
fucking Eldorado.
Um,
anyways,
so let's dog is this shit.

769
00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:10.780
I love having it around.
I fucking love this dog.

770
00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:15.580
She's awesome and I want to keep it,
but this is the problem.
Um,

771
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:20.440
when we leave,
it fucks up the apartment or it has twice.

772
00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:24.310
It's scratched the door and it's scratched something else in the back.

773
00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:28.420
And it's like,
dude,
I don't own this place.
Okay,

774
00:49:28.421 --> 00:49:30.340
I have a deposit.
Do you understand that?

775
00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:33.400
And one day the landlord is going to come over to me and be like,

776
00:49:33.401 --> 00:49:34.390
what the fuck is that?

777
00:49:34.391 --> 00:49:36.940
And then I'm going to point at you and you don't have a wallet.

778
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.360
And not only do you not have a wallet,
you don't have,
you don't have money,

779
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:43.570
you don't have any money.
All right?
You dumped.
Fuck.

780
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.390
Which means it's coming out of my deposit.

781
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:51.880
And that's what I've dealt with on the last week is literally watching my

782
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:54.490
deposit slowly disappearing.
You know,

783
00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:57.610
you ever been up like two grand playing blackjack,
you know,

784
00:49:57.611 --> 00:50:00.880
and he just sitting there like,
it's never going to end,
you know,

785
00:50:00.881 --> 00:50:04.720
and your buddy's like,
dude,
don't do a walk away dude.
I'm telling you,

786
00:50:04.721 --> 00:50:08.710
kick you up to grandkid away.
Dual feed money.
It's free money.
Right.

787
00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:12.130
And he keep fucking sitting there and the whores coming over there with the

788
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:13.870
whiskey and you keep drinking,
right.

789
00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:19.360
Then some vacuum cleaner salesman sits down and starts hitting on 17 and you

790
00:50:19.361 --> 00:50:22.090
start doing that dumb shit going through.
That was my car,

791
00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:26.890
these guys taking all my cards,
you know,
like if that fuck wasn't there,

792
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:29.120
you would continue to win.
You wouldn't,

793
00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.780
all right do the fucking math.

794
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:37.130
How do you think they keep the lights on all day long with the air conditioning

795
00:50:37.131 --> 00:50:41.480
on and the fucking doors open in the middle of a desert and they still can

796
00:50:41.481 --> 00:50:43.490
afford to do it.
Cause dumb fucks.

797
00:50:43.491 --> 00:50:47.390
Like you sit there and the longer you sit there,

798
00:50:47.391 --> 00:50:51.980
it's simple fucking math.
Do it.
I thought it system.

799
00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:57.110
Um,
so anyways,
so I was like,
listen,
I have,
we uh,
I'll,
I'll keep the dog,

800
00:50:57.111 --> 00:50:59.930
but we gotta put this thing in a fucking cage when we go to leave.
Okay.

801
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:04.110
So I go over to Petco.
Okay.
And um,

802
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.010
I didn't want to go there.
There was a local pet store,
you know me,

803
00:51:07.011 --> 00:51:09.490
I want to go to the mom and pop store,
but my girls just like,
oh,

804
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:14.110
that's right around the corner.
Everywhere I work,
you know,
and I got all this,
ah,

805
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:17.000
you know,
they start doing that shit and you just feel all the fucking,

806
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.960
you literally feel the fucking energy draining out of your legs.
He just like,

807
00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:25.010
all right,
we'll go where you want to go.

808
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:30.740
Right.
And then they do this shit.
Why I say Shit,
if you don't want to go there,

809
00:51:30.741 --> 00:51:33.320
we're good.
No,
forget it.
We'll go there.

810
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.470
I don't know why you have to get mad.
I'm,

811
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:41.920
well if you've just fucking why do you ask me where I want to go?

812
00:51:42.201 --> 00:51:45.320
If you already know where we want to go when you were going to go there anyways,

813
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.200
why do you put me through that fucking test?

814
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:53.030
It's like fucking verbal waterboarding.
It's brutal.
So anyways,

815
00:51:53.031 --> 00:51:56.000
so we go to fucking PETCO and it's a typical corporation.

816
00:51:56.150 --> 00:52:01.010
It's 90,000 square feet and they got two people on the floor.
All right?

817
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:02.990
And there's literally like,

818
00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:07.280
people are gathered around the one person with the fucking apron that's the same

819
00:52:07.281 --> 00:52:09.500
color as the sign outside.
So you like,

820
00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:13.250
obviously they work here because they have a fucking apron that matches.

821
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.100
It's the same color blue as the fucking sign.

822
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:20.090
And there's literally people gathered around this person,
like they're famous,

823
00:52:20.091 --> 00:52:23.600
like they're waiting for an autograph when the reality is is they're trying to

824
00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:28.601
find a fucking flea collar and this fucking Goddamn mega church that they have

825
00:52:29.151 --> 00:52:30.620
for fucking dogs,
right?

826
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:35.180
Jesus Christ almost fucking spun out of control with all the references there

827
00:52:35.181 --> 00:52:38.960
anyways,
and we plow ahead here.
Was that even remotely funny?
Anyways,
let's go.

828
00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:44.000
So anyways,
get to the point bill.
So I'm fucking,

829
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:46.160
they sit at guys like,
all right,
I go,
listen,

830
00:52:46.161 --> 00:52:48.560
I need I gotta I gotta I gotta fucking nap pitbull.

831
00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:49.930
Evidently it's a pit bull mixed,

832
00:52:49.931 --> 00:52:52.940
but I think it's mixed with another pitbull cause it fucking looks like a pit

833
00:52:52.941 --> 00:52:55.610
bull to me.
The guys like,
how are you sir?
Don't worry,
I'm going to,

834
00:52:55.611 --> 00:52:57.860
I'm going to be over there just about 10 minutes.
Don't worry about it.

835
00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:01.490
So I say fine.
And I stand over there for about seven minutes and I'm like,

836
00:53:01.491 --> 00:53:04.790
you know what,
this dude's not fucking showing up.
He's not fucking showing up.

837
00:53:04.791 --> 00:53:07.460
So I just grabbed the biggest fucking cage I could find cause I want it to be

838
00:53:07.461 --> 00:53:11.870
nice and Roomy,
you know,
be responsible pet owner.
I don't want to be cruel.

839
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:15.650
I don't act like a fucking puppy mill.
You know,
it's fucking thing's huge.

840
00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:20.270
You could fit a fucking Jacuzzi in the corner.
All right.
It's a big cage.

841
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:25.190
So I bring the thing home and uh,
Lo and behold,

842
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:27.320
a buddy of mine calls me up,
says,

843
00:53:27.321 --> 00:53:31.200
tells me he's got a Gig back east for the whole summer direct.

844
00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:33.320
And a bunch of actors in some bullshit.
So He's,

845
00:53:33.321 --> 00:53:36.380
he's having a Gig and he wants me to come by and say goodbye.

846
00:53:36.381 --> 00:53:39.260
So I say absolutely.
My girl's not around.
So I go,

847
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:42.200
I fucking stick the dog in the cage.
All right?
And I feel awful.

848
00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.450
The dog standing there shaking like a leaf.

849
00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:46.460
I literally get the thing to go in the cage.

850
00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:49.460
It's facing the back of the cage and it's not moving.

851
00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:52.130
It's just standing there shaking like it,
you know,

852
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:56.210
like it knows a fucking earthquake is coming or something.
Okay.

853
00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.320
So I'm sitting there trying to convey to the dog like,
dude,

854
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:05.120
I know you scared right now.
You know,
I know you were abandoned,

855
00:54:05.121 --> 00:54:07.710
but I'm not going to abandon you.
You understand?

856
00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:10.020
You just fucking up my apartment and I can't have that.

857
00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:12.620
So how do you say that and how do,

858
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:17.150
how would the dog whisper convey that?
You know,
I don't know how to do it.

859
00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.760
All right,
dude,
I'm coming back.

860
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:24.410
Notice I'm leaving and I'm not bringing you with me in the cage.

861
00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:27.680
I could see if I was doing that.
I could see then you've fucking

862
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:32.960
dude,
just stop shaking,
right?
You know that you feel awful.
Stop.
Please,

863
00:54:32.961 --> 00:54:34.430
please stop shaking.
So I leave.

864
00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:36.650
I go to the party in the party for two fucking hours.

865
00:54:36.651 --> 00:54:40.700
All I can think about as a goddamn dog being scared in the cage and it's killing

866
00:54:40.701 --> 00:54:42.800
me.
It's ripping my heart out.
So I'm following.
It's like,
dude,

867
00:54:42.801 --> 00:54:44.570
I've got to get out of here.
I got this dog.
I,
I can't,

868
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:49.370
I can't fucking leave it alone.
It's killing me.
So I fucking drive back

869
00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.150
and I'm thinking all this dogs and be so psyched to see me.
You know?

870
00:54:53.151 --> 00:54:55.040
That's the best thing when you come home,
when you have a dog,

871
00:54:55.041 --> 00:54:56.630
the dog's fucking psyched to see it,
right?

872
00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:01.250
So I come home and I opened the door and who's fucking sitting on the other side

873
00:55:01.251 --> 00:55:05.560
of the doors?
That God damn dog just sitting there wagging its tail,

874
00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:09.130
thumping it on the floor,
you know,

875
00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:14.480
completely.
You know,
normal look on his face like,
hey bill,
what's going on?

876
00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:18.020
You want an egg?
You know,
I was thinking about making a late breakfast.

877
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:21.500
What'd you get into tonight?
Knife.
And you get some pussy.

878
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:22.291
What's going to help do you mean?

879
00:55:22.291 --> 00:55:25.310
I've just fucking regular and I'm looking at the dog like

880
00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:32.000
did I dream that I did.
I not put you on a fucking cage to focus,

881
00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:36.890
you know what the fuck is going on here?
Right.
So I walk out to the kitchen and

882
00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:40.600
I don't know how to describe this without pictures.

883
00:55:40.601 --> 00:55:45.340
The only way I can describe it is it looked like the cage got raped and then

884
00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:49.390
thrown in front of the locomotive,
the fucking thing,

885
00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.840
which like it was lopsided.
It was,

886
00:55:52.841 --> 00:55:55.120
there was a big chunk taken out of the side.

887
00:55:56.710 --> 00:56:00.690
And then there was these all this blood on the floor.
And um,
I,

888
00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:04.210
I was beside myself.
I was,
I couldn't believe it.

889
00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:08.860
And I want to say that the cage door was still closed.

890
00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:12.410
She just,
she just fucked this thing up.

891
00:56:12.411 --> 00:56:15.530
And now I'm sitting there freaking out going,
oh my God,
she hurt herself.

892
00:56:15.531 --> 00:56:18.590
There's blood all over the God damn floor.
The amount of blood on the floor.

893
00:56:18.591 --> 00:56:20.630
I would've thought that she'd be laying there unconscious.

894
00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:23.920
And she just sitting there looking at me wagon,

895
00:56:23.921 --> 00:56:27.660
it's fucking tail on the Goddamn linoleum now.
So I,
you know,

896
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:32.080
I'm looking at its mouth and
does nothing in there.
There's a little bit,

897
00:56:32.081 --> 00:56:34.570
it's like one of the fucking x men.
What's that extra and you know,
you,

898
00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:37.690
you cut it and just automatically heals.
That's what it looks like.

899
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.410
It's just completely fine.
So

900
00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.620
I didn't,
I don't know.
It was like,
I was like half.
Yeah,

901
00:56:47.621 --> 00:56:49.900
I was definitely bummed because I was out a couple hundred bucks,

902
00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.150
especially with all the fucking fuzzy,

903
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:57.220
let's make this cage a home shit that I bought to put in it,
but uh,

904
00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:01.720
pardon me,
respected it.
I was like,
God damn,
this is a fucking dog,
you know?

905
00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:07.900
And uh,
I was like,
all right.
Evidently I bought the wrong fucking cage.
So

906
00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.610
Jesus Christ,
I don't even know anymore.
I fucking two days later,
right?

907
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:15.670
I haven't left the house.
We haven't left the house and left her alone.

908
00:57:15.671 --> 00:57:18.100
We keep bringing her in the,
in the God damn car.
And that's another thing,

909
00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:21.970
bringing the car,
she fucking stands.
Is she shaking?
Like,
Oh fuck,

910
00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:23.660
what did I do this time,
man,
I'm getting a band.

911
00:57:23.661 --> 00:57:26.530
And again went to affect me and you know,
we'll like,
dude,

912
00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.780
we're not abandoning you.

913
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:33.610
We just fucking relax and stick your face out the fucking window.

914
00:57:33.611 --> 00:57:38.470
Like a regular dog.
Jesus Christ.
You know,
you're making me nervous,
you know?

915
00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:44.080
So finally we were like,
look,
we need to have a life.
Okay.
You know,

916
00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:48.310
I have to go out and do stand up.
You have to be able to go work.
I have to have,

917
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:50.440
you know,
we got to get another cage.

918
00:57:50.441 --> 00:57:54.700
So I finally go to Petco again and I find one of those Douche bags with the blue

919
00:57:54.701 --> 00:57:58.090
apron or whatever,
and I go listen to it.
Actually brought the dog.
I'm like,

920
00:57:58.091 --> 00:57:58.960
this is what I have.

921
00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:02.080
This is what I bought and this is what the fuck it did to it.

922
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:06.070
Do you have anything to help me?
And you guys are late.
No problem.
No problem.

923
00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:07.580
It was of dewalt.
We'll,
uh,

924
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:10.720
we get one of these wire cages and we'll get it a muscle.

925
00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:12.730
Because that was a big thing with me.
I was like,

926
00:58:12.731 --> 00:58:16.060
I don't want the dog to get hurt trying to get out of the cage.

927
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:17.830
I want a cage so they can't break out of.

928
00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:21.760
And I want to leave the dog in a situation where it can't get hurt.

929
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:23.043
So it gives me,

930
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.500
it gives me this muscle to put on the dog where it can still drink.

931
00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:31.060
Relax you fucking animal loving jackasses.
It can still drink.

932
00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:36.520
Okay.
It could vomit if it had to.
So it's not going to die like John Bonham.

933
00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:40.060
You know,
a lot of people don't know that.
Not only did he have 32 shots of vodka,

934
00:58:40.061 --> 00:58:43.170
he,
they actually found him slumped over in a doggy cage.
All right.

935
00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:46.600
I'm face down in a fucking water dish.

936
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:53.890
I can't believe I just said that about one of the guys I loved the most.
Anyways.

937
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:58.600
Um,
so we get all the shit.
I get the fucking cage.

938
00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:01.870
All right.
And this time we're doing like dog whisperer,

939
00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:05.350
a shit for literally an hour last night.
We work with this doc.

940
00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:10.480
We walked the dog by the cage.
We walked it back past the cage,

941
00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:14.260
you know,
and it's freaking out looking at the cage and the cage has two doors.

942
00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.550
So I got my girls got both doors open so she's got half her body in the cage

943
00:59:18.551 --> 00:59:20.740
going come he cleo comedically,
oh good girl.

944
00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.750
And she would sort of come close to the cage and put her head down and wouldn't

945
00:59:23.751 --> 00:59:24.584
go in it.

946
00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:29.330
And then we'd walk away and we just over and over and over and then one half

947
00:59:29.331 --> 00:59:31.580
hour into it,
nothing but positive reinforcement.

948
00:59:31.581 --> 00:59:36.380
All of a sudden it was like magic.
It's like a fucking afterschool special.

949
00:59:36.381 --> 00:59:38.690
She just crawled,
walked,
you know,

950
00:59:38.691 --> 00:59:40.550
like a little fucking marine trying to go under neath.

951
00:59:40.551 --> 00:59:44.210
Barb wire went into the cage and we will like,
that's a good girl.

952
00:59:44.211 --> 00:59:45.920
And we were patent it and you know,

953
00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:48.410
my girl rubbed his head till it fell asleep a little bit.

954
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.380
And then when it got up and,
and wanting to get out of the cage,

955
00:59:51.381 --> 00:59:53.990
we let it get out of the cage just so it had that vibe,
you know,

956
00:59:53.991 --> 00:59:56.750
like this is your home,
this is,
you're not being punished.

957
00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:03.560
So then we do that exercise a number of times,
another five,
six,

958
01:00:03.561 --> 01:00:07.010
seven fucking times.
Kept walking it into the cage,
praising it,

959
01:00:07.011 --> 01:00:08.720
telling it was a good girl scratching it.

960
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.660
And then when I wanted to get out of the cage with,
let it out of the cage,

961
01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:16.730
right down the fucking dog whispering numbers on how to do this shit.

962
01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:23.180
So the end of the night comes,
we slide this big motherfucking cage.
Okay.

963
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:28.010
Um,
at the foot of the bed,
she likes to sleep on the foot of the bed.

964
01:00:28.011 --> 01:00:30.980
We take the two pillows that she likes to sleep on,
we put him in the cage,

965
01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:36.220
we put her in there and we closed the cage and she's sitting there and uh,

966
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:42.530
we call it out the lights and then she just,
she whined

967
01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:47.840
sorta panted in wine for like two hours,
just going,

968
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:53.600
just like that.
I couldn't believe it didn't pass out.

969
01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.580
That's how quickly it was breathing.
Literally.

970
01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:58.220
Is that annoying to listen to if you're on a plane right now?

971
01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.510
That's what the fuck that thing did for two hours to the point.
I was like,

972
01:01:02.511 --> 01:01:05.420
Jesus Christ near let's just let the thing out of the fucking cage.

973
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:06.950
And she's like,
no,
if we do that,

974
01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:10.700
then it's going to learn that that's all it has to do is that annoying sound,

975
01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:14.900
which I won't do again to fucking make you guys fucking teeth,
heart,
you know.

976
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:19.880
So
anyways,
she finally ends up going to sleep.

977
01:01:19.881 --> 01:01:22.410
We go to sleep the next morning she wakes up,
we let her out of the cage,

978
01:01:22.411 --> 01:01:25.910
she's all excited and I've been doing what I've been doing with this dog.

979
01:01:25.911 --> 01:01:29.120
I fucking run it up,
but God Damn Mountain and I've run it right back down.

980
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:34.310
You know,
fucking thing is all muscle.
It's the shit,
right?

981
01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:39.920
It was fucking dog is awesome.
Um,
so anyways,
no roids either.

982
01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.460
This is all natural.
So anyways,

983
01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.100
so today I get up and uh,

984
01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.550
my beautiful girls got to go to work and I had a meeting.

985
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.930
You don't try to come up with a show idea,
trying to get a show on the air,

986
01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:59.510
trying to come up with a better idea.
So won't get squashed like a bug.

987
01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:03.620
Like on my last fucking idea did right at the last second when I thought I was

988
01:02:03.621 --> 01:02:05.750
home free,
you know,

989
01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:10.130
gliding along free as a bird than smash right into fucking windshield.

990
01:02:10.131 --> 01:02:13.640
That's what happened.
My last idea.
But we will,
that's a whole nother podcast.

991
01:02:13.641 --> 01:02:17.390
We won't get into that shit.
So anyways,
we uh,

992
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.160
bring the dog into the cage.
She's definitely not,

993
01:02:21.161 --> 01:02:24.420
we put the muzzle on it so won't hurt itself if it tries to get out,

994
01:02:24.421 --> 01:02:28.710
which we know it's going to try to,
I put it's water in there.
We closed the door,

995
01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:33.660
we tell it to each teller.
She's a good girl.
And uh,
we sold it,
you know,

996
01:02:33.661 --> 01:02:35.250
I went out,
did,
you know,

997
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.790
had my breakfast out in the kitchen and I kind of peeked in the bedroom and it

998
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:39.720
was laying down.

999
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:43.800
The muzzle on thing was totally cool and I thought,

1000
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.360
I thought everything is great.
This is awesome.
We have our lives back.
You know,

1001
01:02:48.361 --> 01:02:48.841
I liked it.

1002
01:02:48.841 --> 01:02:52.950
I got to be able to do standup and I like to play drums in that type of shit.

1003
01:02:52.951 --> 01:02:56.430
I like doing that shit during the day when I fucking can't stare at the walls

1004
01:02:56.431 --> 01:02:57.264
anymore.

1005
01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:02.750
So a off we go into the wild blue yonder,

1006
01:03:02.971 --> 01:03:05.250
I dropped my girl off at work,
I go and I,
you know,

1007
01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:07.740
hanging out with this other comic,

1008
01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:11.430
we're trying to come up with a TV show idea and I actually brought my shit along

1009
01:03:11.431 --> 01:03:15.270
with me cause I'm feeling free.
I can go play drums.
The dog is cool.

1010
01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:17.660
And I was actually thinking halfway through,
right?

1011
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:20.010
Just like when I was at the party is okay,
hey man,
I got to get home man.

1012
01:03:20.011 --> 01:03:22.560
I feel bad.
The dogs in the cage.
A fucking loved that dog.

1013
01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:25.890
I fucking love that dog.
I've got to let the dog out of the cage.
I'll hang out.

1014
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:30.510
You know,
I'll play some guitar instead.
Right.
And I'll watch the Bruins,

1015
01:03:30.511 --> 01:03:33.780
hopefully beat the fucking hurricanes tonight and gave six right.
That's,

1016
01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.600
that was my game plan and a,

1017
01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:39.480
so I come home like this dogs and be so fucking psyched on it,
you know,

1018
01:03:39.481 --> 01:03:42.720
and I show up,
let it out of the cage.
It's going to be flipping out.

1019
01:03:42.721 --> 01:03:44.010
Jumping all around.
It's awesome.

1020
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:47.280
It's awesome when he come home and you got a dog,
right?
So I come home,

1021
01:03:47.281 --> 01:03:50.090
I opened the back door,
and then we have this other doors,

1022
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:51.390
got this big glass window,

1023
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:55.410
and I go to put the key in and I looked down and who the fuck is sitting there?

1024
01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:58.890
Right on the other side of the door.
And you sit there wagging its tail.

1025
01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:05.460
The fucking Goddamn Cleo.
And I'm looking at the Doug going,

1026
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:08.850
are you fucking shitting me?
And I look at its face.

1027
01:04:08.851 --> 01:04:12.660
It's got a little bit of dried blood on its muzzle and right by its eye.

1028
01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:17.910
And it's happy as shit.
It doesn't give a fuck.
It's just wagging his tail.

1029
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:21.960
Hey Bill,
how was your meeting?
You know,
just come up with any ideas,
you know,

1030
01:04:21.961 --> 01:04:24.660
don't give up man.
I'm telling you,
you're going to get a TV show.
I did.

1031
01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.860
He wanted to go for a jog,
right?

1032
01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:31.740
And I'm sitting there looking at this fucking thing like,
dude,

1033
01:04:31.741 --> 01:04:35.700
you gotta be shitting me.
You got to be fucking kidding me.

1034
01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:40.790
And I walk into the bedroom and here's this fucking cage that this Douche bag

1035
01:04:42.331 --> 01:04:46.140
down at Petco said I would be fine.
Oh,
by the way,
the,

1036
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:48.750
the fucking thing still has the muscle,
but it's off.

1037
01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:53.850
It got it off and it's hanging down around it's fucking neck like a Bandana.

1038
01:04:53.851 --> 01:04:57.930
Like some douchebag in prince's band way back in the day.

1039
01:04:57.931 --> 01:05:00.360
Remember that guy who played the fucking guitar keyboard,

1040
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:03.360
the guy in the revolution,
prince and the revolution,
right?

1041
01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.040
That's the way the muzzle is.

1042
01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.880
All needed to be was like some sort of fucking neon leopard print.

1043
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:10.980
And that thing was good to go.
Right.

1044
01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:16.940
So I come walking in and I can't even describe to you how fucked this cage was.

1045
01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.100
And there was blood all over the fucking floor.
And once again,

1046
01:05:22.101 --> 01:05:24.650
I'm checking her mouth.
I'm checking her pause.

1047
01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:28.170
There are areas where there's sort of dried blood on her for her,

1048
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:31.560
but she's not bleeding.
This dog is,

1049
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:36.900
is not from this planet.
Yeah.
And this,
but this cage is,

1050
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:41.550
and you know,
I took a fucking picture of it.
I should put it up on my,

1051
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:47.120
on my myspace page.
I don't know what it did.

1052
01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:48.830
I don't,

1053
01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:52.540
I don't know if it just fucking started jumping up and down and slam it into the

1054
01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:53.430
sides of it.
But

1055
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:59.770
I'm looking at it right now.
I can't,

1056
01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:04.320
there's like metal is just twisted around.
It's wreckage.

1057
01:06:04.350 --> 01:06:07.920
That's what the fuck I have.
It looks like the rest of the cage is fine.

1058
01:06:07.921 --> 01:06:11.220
It looks like this.
The front of the cage had a front end fucking collision

1059
01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:16.200
with another car.
I,
so I don't know what I'm going to do.
People I have,

1060
01:06:16.201 --> 01:06:19.950
I have a situation because you know,
I'm all for rescue when a dog,

1061
01:06:19.951 --> 01:06:24.951
but I didn't sign up for this shit and I have blown over $300 in cages and I've

1062
01:06:25.771 --> 01:06:30.771
used both of them once and this dog fucks him up and you know,

1063
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.641
I'm telling you,

1064
01:06:32.641 --> 01:06:36.200
you can't talk to animal lovers because they're fucking crazy because they will

1065
01:06:36.201 --> 01:06:41.180
tell you anything just to get you to keep the fucking dog,

1066
01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:44.810
you know?
Oh,
it's just because it's scared.

1067
01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.170
It scared that it's going to be abandoned.

1068
01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:51.380
You have to build up the trust and it's like,
you know,

1069
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:56.430
that's not my fucking problem.
I want to keep this dog,
but what the,

1070
01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:00.780
what the fuck am I supposed to do?
Okay.
So there's my,
uh,
this isn't a podcast.

1071
01:07:00.781 --> 01:07:04.810
This is just me telling you why.
Well,

1072
01:07:04.811 --> 01:07:07.000
I guess this has no reason to do why there was no podcasts.

1073
01:07:07.001 --> 01:07:10.480
It's no podcast cause I couldn't figure out how to go from garage band to g cast

1074
01:07:10.481 --> 01:07:11.314
to make it work.

1075
01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:15.580
So if you can help me with that and if somebody out there has rescued a fucking

1076
01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:19.840
pit bull and has gone through this shit and they somehow figured out how to get

1077
01:07:19.841 --> 01:07:22.680
the dog
to,

1078
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:27.870
to be cool in a cage because,

1079
01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.670
uh,
not only is it costs me a lot of money,

1080
01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:33.550
this dog is injuring itself and it's fucking killing me.

1081
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:38.500
So if he can help me out,
I would appreciate it.
Uh,

1082
01:07:38.501 --> 01:07:41.350
and that is it.
That is,
this is a very special

1083
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:48.820
Monday morning podcast down on a Tuesday.
I actually have a cause.
Okay.

1084
01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:50.231
Oh,
by the way,

1085
01:07:50.231 --> 01:07:54.850
if you've got any new mps freeze or any type of shit that you want to send me a,

1086
01:07:54.851 --> 01:07:57.730
you know,
go ahead and send them.
I don't know.
You know,
I don't send it to me yet.

1087
01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.710
Just wait til I get my first one up there that I understand how to fucking know.

1088
01:08:00.711 --> 01:08:03.280
If you know how to do it,
please let me know.
That is it.

1089
01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:07.150
I hope all you guys have a good week and hope I have some good news for you next

1090
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:09.500

1092
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:12.343
<v 5>All right,</v>

1093
