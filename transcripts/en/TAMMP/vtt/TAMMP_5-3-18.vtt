00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.740
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn is time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:11.450
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast at all.
I'm checking in on.
Yeah,

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.830
just checking in.
How are you

4
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.940
all fucking a bullet of Billy is back

5
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.360
and he's feeling better than ever.
No more coffin fits.

6
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.790
No more night sweats,

7
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:32.780
no more sleeping under a mosquito net with my fucking malaria.

8
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.641
Um,

9
00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:39.620
I don't think malaria is a funny reference considering each year

10
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.800
42% of women on the planet suffer from this.

11
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.780
Well,
the men are giving endless supplies of Nyquil.

12
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.450
Oh,
here's something I started to talk about the other day on one of my podcasts,

13
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.670
one of my many rambling nonsensical,

14
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:03.080
a little or whatever the fuck you say,
podcast.

15
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.260
I'm Outta here in Los Angeles,

16
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.990
Hollywood specifically.

17
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.590
There's a group of people that want to get the Hollywood sign taken down because

18
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:18.620
they live near the Hollywood sign and there's too many fucking tourists.

19
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.350
I just don't like that has got to be one of the most fucked up things I've ever

20
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:27.530
heard in my life.
Like the whole city has to suffer.

21
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.010
You know why you take down this iconic side?

22
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:35.660
Because you were dumb enough to buy a house next to a tourist attraction.

23
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.420
You fucking moron.
Wait,

24
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.900
why don't you just buy a house across from the fucking magic castle?

25
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.720
Whatever the fuck they call it down there at Disneyland and then get upset,

26
00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:49.300
you know,
uh,
we need to shut down Disneyland.

27
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.140
There's too many people walking around with like Mickey Mouse ears on.

28
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:58.710
It's almost like I bought a house right across from fucking Disney land.

29
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.000
<v 0>Okay.</v>

30
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.080
<v 1>I could see if it was a new,
like since you bought the house.</v>

31
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.500
<v 0>Okay.</v>

32
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.940
<v 1>That,
uh,
you know,</v>

33
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.490
<v 0>okay.</v>

34
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.190
<v 1>All of a sudden they put this new fucking thing up and you're like,
whoa,
whoa,</v>

35
00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:14.380
whoa.
Hey,
hey,
wait a minute.

36
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.430
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.590
<v 1>This was a quiet neighborhood when I bought the house.</v>

38
00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:19.960
That's why I bought the house and all of a sudden there's all these fucking

39
00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:24.860
people.
People love it.
That,

40
00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:28.380
that,
that's fucking sign it.
It's like 80 something years old.
Right.

41
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.510
<v 1>The fucking sign is probably as old as your house.</v>

43
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.480
I don't know what the problem is.
Let me just look this up here.

44
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:39.920
Hollywood sign history,

45
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.870
you'll still be called the Hollywood land bag of the day.

46
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.260
Yeah,
it was Hollywood land.
I mean,

47
00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:50.360
I think to actually think that the native Americans put it up.

48
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

49
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.710
<v 1>If I'm not in,</v>

50
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.450
it might probably say something else like Hiawatha or some native American shit

51
00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:59.000
is actually native American shooters at some white Hollywood shit.

52
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.360
The history of the Hollywood sign
assigned board in night,

53
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:08.650
dark 1923 that fucking thing has been around and it's some asshole with a house

54
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:13.651
that was built in fucking 1978 that they just bought in 2016 wants to fucking

55
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:14.734
think taken down.

56
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

57
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.690
<v 1>All right.
Nobody gives a shit about the history of the sign all the way.</v>

58
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.860
Maybe people do.
All right.
Signs almost 100 years old.

59
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:25.330
It's fitting that the Hollywood sign,

60
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:29.620
the worldwide symbol of the entertainment industry was conceived as an outdoor

61
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:34.180
ad campaign for a suburban housing development called Hollywood land.
After all,

62
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:36.520
despite the high profile of the film Biz,

63
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.120
real estate has always been Hollywood's primary economic driver.

64
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.200
Although the signs with the fight that they know it hasn't,

65
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.850
you needed the entertainment industry so it could make stars so they could

66
00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:52.620
afford all these fucking houses.

67
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.060
Who the fuck would move out here just to live into a in a fucking house with all

68
00:03:57.061 --> 00:03:59.130
of this traffic.
All right.

69
00:03:59.131 --> 00:04:02.640
Although the signs of parents of purpose has evolved over the years,
it's basic,

70
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.240
it's aspirational.
Message remains the same.

71
00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:08.910
This is the place where magic is possible,

72
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.200
where dreams can come true and these fucking people that lived here,

73
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:14.700
this side want to take this down.

74
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.033
<v 0>Uh Huh.</v>

75
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.940
<v 1>Back then the dream was bill was a beautiful home and lifestyle.</v>

76
00:04:20.941 --> 00:04:25.170
Today the signs promise is more subtle and it can only be described as the

77
00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:29.430
parade of images,
desires and ideas couldn't conjured by the word Hollywood.

78
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.600
I think that there fucking looking into this a little bit too much.
No,
Hollywood,

79
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:37.350
you come out here because you want to fucking star and movies or write movies a

80
00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:38.184
direct them,

81
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.743
<v 0>you know,</v>

82
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.360
<v 1>and it take advantage of your position of power.</v>

83
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.470
Act like an animal and then have the whole fucking thing come crumbling down.

84
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:48.910
I mean that's,
that's,
that's what,

85
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.760
that's what's been going on since we've been out here.
Uh,

86
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.490
take down,
Holly would sign.
Search

87
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.060
sees the Hollywood sign.

88
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

89
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.680
<v 1>Okay.
Christine O'bryan has decided,</v>

90
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:12.280
I guess nobody in La should get to look at that fucking awesome sign anymore.

91
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.800
All right.
There's a woman who wants to get rid of the Hollywood sign.

92
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.590
I can't blame the impulse.
It looks so good.

93
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.960
Attacked by tornadoes and aliens.
What?
There's such a rash,

94
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.250
such a rush in the slow creek and the quick crunch of the corrugated letters

95
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:33.750
peel from the scaffolding and fly off from mountain like,
whoa.

96
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:35.140
The fuck wrote all his shit.

97
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.270
The worldwide fame of the sign is bolted to that image of just of its

98
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:42.870
destruction.
Right.
Hey,
Christina.

99
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:46.780
Brian though suggest taking the sign down and moving it to universal studios and

100
00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:51.781
the other side of the hill erecting the context lists h at some sort of tourist

101
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:57.620
trap in the flats of Hollywood.
She lives in the signs,

102
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.130
original namesake.
Hollywood land.

103
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

104
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.810
<v 1>The sign once read Hollywood land.</v>

105
00:06:04.811 --> 00:06:07.090
Does that mean her houses where land used to be?

106
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

107
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.140
<v 1>This person,
I have a really smart,
or this is English a second language.</v>

108
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.080
She lives in the signs.
Original namesake.

109
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

110
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.810
<v 1>Does that mean she lives in Hollywood?</v>

111
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.420
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

112
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.850
<v 1>A small steep disorders.</v>

113
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.780
The neighborhood where big houses hug the streets in front and hang off into

114
00:06:27.781 --> 00:06:30.630
nothing in the back.
Hollywood lands,

115
00:06:30.631 --> 00:06:33.780
ness of streets rise out from the top of Beachwood.

116
00:06:33.781 --> 00:06:35.940
Js Is this fucking verbose content.

117
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.551
All right.

118
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:45.460
The strangest thing about the Hollywood sign is that everyone led a huge real

119
00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:46.630
estate advertisement,

120
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.610
slowly rot on one of the city's most prominent peaks for 55 years from when it

121
00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:56.560
was planted on the hillside by Hollywood Land Realty Company in 1923 until it

122
00:06:56.561 --> 00:07:01.561
was dug up and replaced in 1978 slowly accruing meaning and sentiment over the

123
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.690
same decades.
Uh,

124
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.310
Los Angeles was earning its reputation as a place that was happy to demolish its

125
00:07:09.311 --> 00:07:10.480
own brief pass.

126
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.660
Is this the weirdest right person writing ever?

127
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.350
It's like,
it just like contradicts itself.
I can't even read this shit.
All right,

128
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.270
let's,
let me just go back here.
Hollywood sign hiking to the side,

129
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.220
the Hollywood sign.
Hollywood sign down.

130
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.580
Here's the best way Hollywood sign trail closure is long overdue.

131
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.870
Hang on a second here.
I'm sorry.
This is just all fucking interesting to me.

132
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.440
We got somebody with this selfie stick.
That's not really,

133
00:07:52.441 --> 00:07:54.300
that's not a good argument for the other side.

134
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.930
I just don't get people that fucking bought houses up there.

135
00:07:57.931 --> 00:07:59.910
Like what did you think was going to fucking happen?

136
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:05.270
And like how much money do you fucking have and how much of a cunt or you just

137
00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:10.440
move it to the other side.
I actually think,
to be honest with you,

138
00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:14.760
the fact that someone would want to take that side down is a clear example of

139
00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:17.640
the,
of,
of the disappearing middle class.

140
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.700
They don't want these animals going up there.

141
00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:23.770
These lower class people walking around.
They're fucking,

142
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.640
<v 0>okay.</v>

143
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.590
<v 1>God Damn Waldorf House.
All right.</v>

144
00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:34.330
Why is it long overdue?
It was a great hike.
All right.

145
00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:36.040
In the span of about 10 minutes.
So,

146
00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:38.530
and soak and hike from a paved road in the Hollywood hills,

147
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.060
Beachwood Canyon neighborhood to take a breathtaking view of breath of Griffith

148
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.700
Park,
the city skyline,
and of course the Hollywood side.

149
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.640
When I have the free time,
I always like to come here.
Nobody gives a shit.

150
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:53.110
But after this weekend,
uh,
she will lose her quick,
quick escape to urban life.

151
00:08:53.111 --> 00:08:53.920
Starting Tuesday,

152
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.320
the Beachwood drive will be closed to public because of court action.

153
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.650
Hikers and tourists will be directed away from the trail entrance.

154
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.910
The soon to be closed.

155
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:07.650
Trailhead is popular among Angelenos as well as tourists wanting a selfie with

156
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:10.180
the world's most famous sign,
blah,
blah,
blah.

157
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.260
Some residents welcome the closure even though they,

158
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:16.820
along with other visits will no longer be able to access the trail.

159
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.990
It's long overdue.
Says Jim Krantz 60 stop again.

160
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.970
I'm an old angry guy.
Gotta hair.

161
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.200
Like he didn't go up there and he fucking 23 schedule with some fucking chick

162
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:30.480
back in the day and now you're too fucking old.

163
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:33.510
Legs are too old to go up the trail.
So everyone else can't go.

164
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.810
Everybody get my fucking shut my deck.
He did that back in the fucking,

165
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.420
well that would make them too old.
The Vietnam era,
I dunno.
Uh,

166
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.603
<v 0>okay.</v>

167
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.800
<v 1>Okay.
Gate walk.
Clocking through.
We okay.
I,
I'm always walking my dog.</v>

168
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:54.180
We come up here every night.
We're going to miss our little hikes up here still.

169
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:56.970
While the closure is a bummer,
it's worth it.

170
00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:00.870
He said there's a classic fucking La Guy,
60 years old still saying bummer.

171
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.300
What would you interview the fucking dude?

172
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.720
I prefer to have locked and lose all the people and all the noise and all the

173
00:10:07.721 --> 00:10:10.930
sound and all the of the litter and everything else that goes along with it.

174
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:12.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

175
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:17.370
<v 1>It's not a legal challenge by residents,
but one from the sunset ranch.
Oh,</v>

176
00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:19.350
horse stabler and tour company.
Okay,

177
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:22.950
so it's the horse people that is putting an end to public access to the trail

178
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:23.784
road.

179
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

180
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.180
<v 1>All right.
Fuck it.
I don't know what I'm talking about.</v>

181
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:28.670
I thought it was the people with the houses.

182
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.820
Now it turns out it's a fucking rancher.
It's a matter all this selfie.

183
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:35.520
People are spoken your horses,
is that what's going on?

184
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:39.390
Did I just waste 10 minutes talking about that fucking sign?
Why Bill?

185
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:42.540
Why did you waste 10 minutes?
Because you're fucking team lost again last night.

186
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:43.490
Yes,
they did.

187
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:46.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

188
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:51.400
<v 1>The finesse Spruance the goal scoring,
Bro,
once,
once again,</v>

189
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.300
uh,
lost to the,
the pretending to be tough.

190
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.720
Tampa Bay lightening.
Uh,

191
00:10:58.721 --> 00:11:01.480
I've been watching the Bruins for 40 years and it's been a long time since I've

192
00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:05.440
seen us get pushed around the way we're getting pushed around.
And I think,
uh,

193
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:11.650
we've got too many Rick Middleton's and not enough Jay Miller's,
we need a,

194
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.560
we need somebody to,
I dunno,

195
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.230
we're just letting people waltz into the fucking zone.

196
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.220
And I kind of feel like after the first two games at Toronto,

197
00:11:21.221 --> 00:11:25.420
Toronto made an adjustment and kind of showed how to beat the Bruins.

198
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:29.200
And I think we caught Tampa a little flat because of their layoff and we beat

199
00:11:29.201 --> 00:11:34.201
him in the game one and they're basically just doing the same fucking thing that

200
00:11:34.301 --> 00:11:37.960
Toronto did to us,
which is,
you know what kind of a one line team right now.

201
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.130
I Dunno.
Maybe we just had a couple of games that were bad.
Um,

202
00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:46.570
but it's not the Tampa score goals.

203
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.800
It's that they're fucking all this face wash in and all this shit that they're

204
00:11:50.801 --> 00:11:54.760
doing and now they're starting to fucking act like did this tough team and then

205
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:58.570
not,
I mean,
I could beat up half the people at Tampa.

206
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.530
That's a true story.
Fucking with you.
I know.
It's just weird.

207
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.920
I've never seen the Bruins not saying it's,
it's happening a lot.

208
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:10.730
It's ha they've just taken a little too many fucking liberties and um,

209
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.300
the calls haven't been going our way the last two games.

210
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:15.340
So I got to feel like we're do this game,

211
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.043
<v 2>you know,</v>

212
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.040
<v 1>I don't want to sit here and bitch about the officiating because some nights she</v>

213
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:24.050
get the call,
some nights you don't add a,

214
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.820
it's just been kind of back to back yet.

215
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.480
I don't know how you miss a stick hitting an eight foot guy in the face.

216
00:12:30.481 --> 00:12:31.560
I don't know how you miss that.

217
00:12:31.561 --> 00:12:34.240
And then you turn around and call a penalty on his retaliation

218
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.730
<v 2>and uh,
you know,
I dunno.
I Dunno.</v>

219
00:12:39.731 --> 00:12:40.564
It's been a,

220
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.100
<v 1>but generally speaking,
I don't think the officiating,
I think,</v>

221
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.470
I don't know if they're overthinking things.
It's just been weird.

222
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.520
Not as much bad,
just kind of weird officiating.
So maybe who knows?

223
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:54.370
Tonight we're doing next,
tomorrow night maybe I guess we play,

224
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.140
we're due to get some calls.
Uh,
however I will say this,
the uh,

225
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.730
rebuild his business success,

226
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:04.000
the fact we already want to fucking play off series and we could win this one.

227
00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:06.870
We can actually get to the eastern conference finals this quickly after blowing

228
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.300
up the team.
So I am happy about that.
I just wish we would,
uh,

229
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:13.750
we had a little more teeth,
you know.

230
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:15.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

231
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.490
<v 1>I mean,
Tampa,
I don't look at tamp.
They don't have any giant fucking goon.</v>

232
00:13:19.491 --> 00:13:24.470
They're basically a bunch of gold scores in a couple of fucking punks.
And,

233
00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:26.720
uh,
I dunno,
I dunno what the fucking deal is.

234
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.680
I'd like to see Nash Lou uses size a little more and fucking lay somebody out,

235
00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:36.820
even if you've got to take a pet.
Is that,
does,
is that

236
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:37.830
<v 0>okay?</v>

237
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.360
<v 1>Game gone now and hockey?</v>

238
00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:40.400
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

239
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.330
<v 1>I mean,
we had our first fight last night.
Fucking unheard of.</v>

240
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.660
Fucking 10 games in to the playoffs.
We had our first fight.

241
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:51.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

242
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.210
<v 1>Um,
but you know,
all these people that watched the Olympic hockey,</v>

243
00:13:54.211 --> 00:13:57.360
this is the hockey that they wanted so they can now sit down and watch it,

244
00:13:57.361 --> 00:13:59.760
which they're not doing.
The cons,
you know,

245
00:13:59.761 --> 00:14:02.970
I think the people that tried to get fighting at a hockey are also people that

246
00:14:02.971 --> 00:14:07.770
want to take the Hollywood sign down.
Those kinds of people.
Oh,
by the way,

247
00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:11.340
you guys keep asking me about this Michelle Wolf thing.
I haven't seen it.

248
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.170
I don't pay attention to the news,

249
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.250
but evidently she did the White House correspondence dinner and everybody's all

250
00:14:17.251 --> 00:14:21.510
up in arms because he told some jokes,
which I can totally understand.

251
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.030
<v 0>Okay.</v>

252
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.550
<v 1>I mean,
she's telling jokes people.
Well,
that's,</v>

253
00:14:25.551 --> 00:14:27.830
that's how fucking dangerous is that.
You know,

254
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.900
it's just unbelievable to me that it's okay to,
uh,

255
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.400
genetically alter our food supply

256
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.860
<v 2>that's okay.</v>

257
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.110
<v 1>Can take all the fucking principles of heroin and,
and,</v>

258
00:14:41.111 --> 00:14:45.910
and create them in the synthetic form and create a fucking nationwide heroin

259
00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:47.320
epidemic.
That's fine.

260
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.800
Not a word from CNN or fucking Fox.
That shit.

261
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.930
Not a fucking peep,
right?
You can totally cook the economy,

262
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.280
leave millions of Americans upside down in their own fucking houses the rest of

263
00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:04.730
their life.
They're going to owe more than what their house is worth.

264
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.480
And then he give the houses right back to the bankers so they can do it all over

265
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:12.410
again.
All of that is fine.
All of that is fine,

266
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:16.220
but evidently if you're a comedian and you tell some fucking jokes,

267
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.980
people are going to debate it for 10 fucking days while they're feeding kid

268
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.640
their own fucking kids.

269
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.670
This poison food that's going to make your nine year old have a fucking
mustache.

270
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.420
It's fucking nuts are going to drop before he learns how to ride a bike.

271
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:35.210
It's so full of fucking hormones and all this other fucking shit.

272
00:15:35.211 --> 00:15:39.440
Evidently that is fine.
Poisoning your own food supply,

273
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.660
something isis jerks off to doing to us.
I mean,
I,

274
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.520
those not terrorist acts against your own fucking people.

275
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.180
The people that did that shit should literally be hanging from their toes,

276
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.740
but there's not a fucking word said about it.

277
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.850
Not a fucking word is set about it.

278
00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:01.330
Cause they advertise on CNN and Fox and they donate to fucking politicians.

279
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.970
So they don't say a fucking word.
You know,

280
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.690
all of these fucking presidents,

281
00:16:07.691 --> 00:16:11.860
they leave the office worth tens of millions of dollars despite the fact that

282
00:16:11.861 --> 00:16:14.560
they only made 500 grand a year as president.

283
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.600
You tell me how that math works out.

284
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.530
Why isn't that ever talked about the level that they do now?

285
00:16:20.531 --> 00:16:24.620
When a comedian tells a fucking joke,
it's ridiculous.
Um,

286
00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:29.590
I'm off my soapbox.
Jesus fucking Christ I,
this is just,

287
00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:34.480
this is literally the era of just getting outraged about something that really

288
00:16:34.481 --> 00:16:37.930
doesn't fucking matter.
While meanwhile,
two feet away,

289
00:16:37.931 --> 00:16:39.830
there's a raging fucking inferno.

290
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.570
Can you believe that jokes she told at that fucking place where she was hired to

291
00:16:46.571 --> 00:16:50.560
tell jokes?
Can you believe she went in there and did her fucking job?

292
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.120
That may God,
that's outrageous.

293
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:57.390
Let's talk about that for 10 days and ignored the fact that the Ford Motor

294
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.210
Company is phasing out cars because no one buys him anymore because everybody

295
00:17:01.211 --> 00:17:05.200
needs an SUV because their cars are full of shit that they don't need,

296
00:17:05.201 --> 00:17:08.320
that they're eventually going to take down to goodwill and is going to end up in

297
00:17:08.321 --> 00:17:11.180
the fucking ocean in that swirl of fucking trash.
Fuck.

298
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.360
Did you hear that Caitlyn Jenner joke?

299
00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.830
Did you hear what so and so said about Donald Trump?
Um,

300
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.000
this is why I don't watch the news.

301
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.350
This is why I just sit alone by myself and think things and agree with them and

302
00:17:31.351 --> 00:17:35.130
then spew them out as though they're fact mean.
Why not?

303
00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.160
Why can't I have my own little news network?

304
00:17:38.161 --> 00:17:41.940
Why can't I behave like CNN and Fox and cure,

305
00:17:41.941 --> 00:17:45.900
rate my fucking news and Spin my own fucking angle on it and then just have

306
00:17:45.901 --> 00:17:47.490
Americans yelling at each other.

307
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.903
<v 2>I Dunno.</v>

308
00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:54.880
<v 1>I don't understand why people liked the level of mouth breathing more.</v>

309
00:17:54.881 --> 00:17:58.730
And you have to be to be on Facebook right now screaming at somebody about

310
00:17:58.731 --> 00:18:03.500
politics or social issues,
you know,
and even worse,

311
00:18:03.501 --> 00:18:07.820
the people that totally buy into it and then start using all that fucking

312
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.800
corporate speak

313
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.240
<v 2>like that was microaggressive,
you know,</v>

314
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:20.510
walking around like you're this informed person.
Ah,
they can all go suck a dick.

315
00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.110
Good for her.
She went there and told some jokes and she ruffled some feathers.

316
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.180
Good for her.
All right?

317
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.760
They now they're going to treat her like she's in fucking Isis.

318
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.700
Classic Classic Journalism

319
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.470
<v 1>in the modern era.
All right.
Um,</v>

320
00:18:34.471 --> 00:18:37.380
I got a couple of 'em so that's what I think about that.
Okay.

321
00:18:37.381 --> 00:18:39.660
I don't need to fucking watch any of the jokes.

322
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:42.990
I know she's fucking hilarious and I know that it's completely blown out of

323
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:45.630
proportion and everybody's running around like fucking chicken.

324
00:18:45.631 --> 00:18:50.280
Little people with blue ties yelling at people with red fucking ties or the blue

325
00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:53.460
type people like it cause the red tie people got it worse or vice versa.

326
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.950
<v 2>Um,
alright.
Plowing your head here.</v>

327
00:18:58.910 --> 00:18:59.271
<v 1>Meanwhile,</v>

328
00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:01.910
there's going to be a fucking polar bear swimming up to my fucking house in

329
00:19:01.911 --> 00:19:04.370
about three years.
Alright.
Butcher box.

330
00:19:04.371 --> 00:19:09.371
Everybody butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass fed and finished beef free

331
00:19:10.161 --> 00:19:13.790
range,
organic chicken,
a heritage,
heritage bread,
pork,

332
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.860
<v 2>which is the pure bred pigs.</v>

333
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:22.080
Swine that came over here from Europe.
Okay.

334
00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:26.040
Not The bastardized once that we have here that are all,
all right.

335
00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.750
<v 1>Mixed up.
All right.
These are pure pigs,
um,</v>

336
00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.550
to your door on a monthly basis.
You know,

337
00:19:33.551 --> 00:19:36.280
it's funny that they do that with dogs and pigs,
you know what I mean?

338
00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:40.540
It's like if you'd like took out dog and pig and you actually put human being

339
00:19:40.541 --> 00:19:44.830
and there you'd sound like a grand dragon.
Uh,
all their products are human,

340
00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:45.940
humane,
humanly,

341
00:19:45.941 --> 00:19:50.941
humanely raised and never given the antibiotics or hormones.

342
00:19:51.131 --> 00:19:53.320
I got to tell you something,
man.
I been eating that stuff all week.

343
00:19:53.321 --> 00:19:56.050
It's delicious.
Absolutely delicious.

344
00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:00.100
A high quality healthy protein you can trust,
unbelievable tastes.

345
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:04.240
There's a huge difference in taste between animals raised on pasture in those

346
00:20:04.241 --> 00:20:09.160
fed grain and concentrated animal feedlot operations.
Yeah,

347
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.280
that's the difference between cool kids and people with helicopter parents

348
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.000
butcher box but actually probably sounded good example.
Um,

349
00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.000
parents that love them versus parents that a abuse them,

350
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.420
but at the end of the day they do kill the animals.

351
00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:23.650
So I don't think there's a lot of love there.

352
00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.240
Put your box is changing that and they offer free shipping anywhere in the lower

353
00:20:28.241 --> 00:20:32.680
48.
Um,
I liked that they said in the 48 states.

354
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.430
<v 2>Okay.</v>

355
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.730
<v 1>I mean do I get to pick which 48,
Alaska and Hawaii,</v>

356
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.300
<v 2>the middle children of our states,
they never did.</v>

357
00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:46.590
They just never feel like they get their dope cause they're not connected to us.

358
00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:47.483
You know?

359
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.280
<v 1>What do you think?
What happens someday if Alaska,
Hawaii,</v>

360
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:56.020
and Puerto Rico all got together and decided to take on blackwater,

361
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.400
now that's a fucking movie.
I would like to see

362
00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.360
offer $20,
$20 off,
plus free bacon.

363
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.320
You get $20 off in free bacon by going to butcher box.com/burr and using the

364
00:21:11.951 --> 00:21:14.730
discount code burpee.
You are are,

365
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.560
I have the hiccups now from talking about food.
Uh,

366
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:25.100
express the p n Victor Papa November.

367
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.050
Uh,
Facebook has been in the news a lot lately,

368
00:21:28.051 --> 00:21:33.051
getting thrashed for letting third parties get your user data.

369
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:39.330
Um,
but do you really think they're the only ones doing it now?
I don't.

370
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:45.740
I don't because I just got some spam from some fucking incorporation that I

371
00:21:46.501 --> 00:21:49.560
have.
And the only people that had it was the bank.

372
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:53.010
So the bank obviously sold it to some other constant now and getting this

373
00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:57.420
fucking pamphlet asking me if I want to take a fucking trip to,
uh,

374
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:59.070
I dunno.

375
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:04.070
Honduras Internet providers like Verizon and spectrum can record a list of every

376
00:22:05.041 --> 00:22:09.030
wipe website you visit and they can legally give it to anyone.

377
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:13.440
It's time to stop trusting big corporations with your data and start protecting

378
00:22:13.441 --> 00:22:16.440
it with express VPN.
Odd.
I liked this.

379
00:22:16.441 --> 00:22:21.441
A little pushback with express VP and you can privately and securely surf the

380
00:22:22.261 --> 00:22:27.180
Internet without being tracked by anyone.

381
00:22:27.181 --> 00:22:28.890

382
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:33.900

383

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:41.040
You're network data is encrypted and Ip address mass keeping your activity and

385
00:22:41.041 --> 00:22:45.610
identity completely private.
Well,

386
00:22:45.611 --> 00:22:49.120
what if somebody hacks into your system for less than $7 a month?

387
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:52.960
You can be protected for IX with express VPN,
but at least should put up a fight.

388
00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:53.950
You know this is like prison.

389
00:22:53.951 --> 00:22:56.530
Now you know you just don't want to be the easy target.

390
00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.790
Now move on to somebody else.

391
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.660

402
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.510
you know,
you'd be able to,
you should be able to go and sue everybody.

403
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.690
They put all your fucking information out there.

404
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.430
<v 2>You know what I mean?
I Dunno.</v>

405
00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.320
<v 1>They need to have like a lady to have stricter rules on hacking information.</v>

406
00:24:01.321 --> 00:24:03.220
You know what I mean?
We got to act like the way they do in,

407
00:24:03.221 --> 00:24:07.470
in like Southeast Asia.
When bankers step out of line,

408
00:24:07.471 --> 00:24:09.720
they put him to death.
You know,

409
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.540
I'm not saying we've got to kill these fucking people,
but like the,
you know,

410
00:24:12.541 --> 00:24:17.300
we could bring back the stockade,
right?
Nah,

411
00:24:17.301 --> 00:24:19.940
you can't do that.
We'd be like,
we would sit there and be like,

412
00:24:19.941 --> 00:24:22.910
well what does that make us?
We can't do things like that.

413
00:24:22.911 --> 00:24:27.420
We're not supposed to be like that.
We just waterboard P waterboarding.

414
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.943
<v 0>Okay.</v>

415
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.610
<v 1>There's a water waterboarding sounds.
That sounds like a fucking,</v>

416
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.460
sounds like a game that you,

417
00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:40.650
a toy that you would have before like the fucking Internet Nela cool shit came

418
00:24:40.651 --> 00:24:44.690
along.
You don't remember all that bed,
those awful.

419
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:48.000
The fucking games that we have.
At least we got outside.
We weren't fat fucks.

420
00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.740
Do you guys remember track ball?
See if I can find that commercial.

421
00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:57.741
It was like basically I think we actually bought that track ball commercial.

422
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.060
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

423
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.360
<v 1>See if I can find this site.</v>

424
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

425
00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.980
<v 1>Trackball by whammo.
Oh my God.
This takes me back.</v>

426
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.030
It's takes me whammo whatever happened to those guys.

427
00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.280
The Internet video games.

428
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.550
Ah,
this is somebody fucking playing trackball.
I want the fucking commercial.

429
00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.383
<v 0>Okay.</v>

430
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.450
<v 1>You know,
I don't understand these people that like,</v>

431
00:25:26.451 --> 00:25:29.630
you know their kids about read a bump their head and rather than preventing it,

432
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.100
they let them do it so they can fucking get a youtube video out of it.

433
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.720
20 pictures that Hillary Clinton wish wishes would go away.

434
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:48.070
That's what I look up track ball and then that's what I get the night Ted

435
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.150
Nugent.
This is what you guys can,

436
00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:53.270
I'm going to give up my information here by the videos that just came up here.

437
00:25:53.271 --> 00:25:58.130
You guys will understand what I look for
on Youtube.

438
00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.170
All right.
Michael Angelo,

439
00:26:00.171 --> 00:26:05.171
2018 rock and roll led Zeppelin tribute the night Ted Nugent challenged Leonard

440
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:11.090
Skinner.
Jonathan Moffett plays Michael Jackson's,
Billie Jean.

441
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.313
He's a drummer.

442
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:16.640
20 pictures that Hillary Clinton wishes would go away.

443
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.920
Family never believed their GRANDPA's crazy stories until,

444
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.420
and there's a picture of an old trunk.

445
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:29.980
The dragon takes its toll and blood is a motorcycle video.

446
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.100
I do watch people wipe out on motorcycles.

447
00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:34.530
<v 0>Okay,</v>

448
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.720
<v 1>you guys do that shit.
I don't like watching like knockouts.</v>

449
00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.100
I used to like watching that shit,

450
00:26:39.101 --> 00:26:42.880
but there's just too many fucking sucker punches and shit like that.

451
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.600
But I do like watching these fucking people on motorcycles driving like goddamn

452
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.190
lunatics.

453
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:54.390
I like when they run from the cops and they get away and I like watching them

454
00:26:54.391 --> 00:26:58.980
wipe up.
I Dunno what that says about me.
Brutal motorcycle crashes.

455
00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:00.040
Part three.

456
00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:01.520
<v 0>Okay,</v>

457
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.890
<v 1>part three,
4 million,</v>

458
00:27:03.891 --> 00:27:07.700
800,000 fucking video.
Look at this guy,

459
00:27:07.701 --> 00:27:12.650
our Bam.
He was going too fast.

460
00:27:12.651 --> 00:27:16.100
He rode right into the fat guy in the fact I didn't even fall down.
Now the guy,

461
00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.190
the guy doing the front fucking,
this is my favorite one.

462
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.570
You know when they do the front Wally and some point you have to let go and do

463
00:27:23.571 --> 00:27:24.410
the face plant.

464
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:34.280
Dude,
I swear to God,
people on motorcycles,
they're just a different breed.

465
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:35.663
<v 0>Okay?</v>

466
00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.540
<v 1>There's a level of balls,</v>

467
00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:39.900
<v 0>okay?</v>

468
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.600
<v 1>There's a lot of fat guys on motorcycles right now,
you know?</v>

469
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:44.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

470
00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.090
<v 1>That has to affect the center of gravity of the bike.</v>

471
00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:50.050
It's got to bring it up higher.
Right?

472
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.330
That's probably why this guy just went down.

473
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:53.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

474
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.340
<v 1>Is another guy going into a turn.
Everything's going good.</v>

475
00:27:58.341 --> 00:28:00.860
There's snow on the ground.
What could go wrong?

476
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:02.480
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

477
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.910
<v 1>this is the last one.
I'll do it cause I know this is getting boring here.</v>

478
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

479
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.690
<v 1>Anything I can do to avoid talking about how miserable I was watching the last</v>

480
00:28:09.691 --> 00:28:12.880
two fucking Bruins games.
Uh,

481
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.020
what's going to happen is a dear gonna come running out.

482
00:28:15.021 --> 00:28:17.360
This guy seems to be riding very responsibly.

483
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.890
He's checking out all the beautiful,
uh,
areas.

484
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.210
Is he going to hit get hit by a Santa Claus' sleigh?
Ah,

485
00:28:26.211 --> 00:28:30.410
we hit the ice and he goes down.
Oh,
that sucks.

486
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:32.990
Well,
what the fuck were you thinking?
Well,

487
00:28:32.991 --> 00:28:36.380
here's a guy in a track is a smart guy.
Why don't more people go out to a track?

488
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:40.610
There's no branches are fucking SUV is out there.
Um,
all right,

489
00:28:40.611 --> 00:28:44.210
I'm done with that shit I'm speaking of which I got to get my truck tuned up.

490
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:46.910
Get that fucker ready for the summer out here.

491
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:52.010
Get that fucker ready for the summer out.
Uh Oh.

492
00:28:52.011 --> 00:28:55.880
By the way,
I'm having a very special guests coming out to the podcast next week.

493
00:28:55.910 --> 00:29:00.910
A very special guest to promote their new show berry on HBO.

494
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.620
It's going down next week.
Very special guests.
We'll be coming onto my repeat,

495
00:29:06.621 --> 00:29:08.900
very special guests.
He could look forward to that.

496
00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:13.130
I have a week of shows coming up out in San Francisco,

497
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.040
Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,
Friday.

498
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:19.700
There was another show that I was announced on some sort of benefit I saw on

499
00:29:19.701 --> 00:29:21.890
Twitter.
I don't even know what the fuck that is.

500
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.490
My agent called me up asking me if I knew what the fuck it was.

501
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.150
Nobody knew what the fuck it was.
I'm not going to be doing that benefit.

502
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.400
Why would I schedule at a competing show in a fucking hour?
Right?

503
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.820
Oh,
Christ.
I got to call this person back.
All right,

504
00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:43.510
well listen that that was the fucking podcast.
Jesus Christ.
You know something?

505
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.060
I literally literally found this one in.

506
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:50.050
I spent 10 minutes talking about a fucking sign that I thought the neighbors

507
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:54.580
were bitching about.
It turned out it was a fucking horse farm.
Um,

508
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:59.330
was there anything accomplished?
I defended Michelle Wolf.
Okay.

509
00:29:59.331 --> 00:30:03.560
How about that?
Without ever seeing what the fuck she said.

510
00:30:03.561 --> 00:30:06.500
I don't even give a fuck you,
you're told jokes.

511
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:11.100
It's like getting mad at a plumber cause they came over to your house and,
and,

512
00:30:11.101 --> 00:30:12.200
and,
and plumbed.

513
00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:13.960
<v 0>Okay.</v>

514
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.370
<v 1>You get offended by the way they snake out of fucking toilet.
Um,</v>

515
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.760
I think that's all I did really.
Is that all I did?
Well,
you know,

516
00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:28.243
<v 0>what do you want from me?</v>

517
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.870
<v 1>You know what's cool was seen Pedro Martinez at the Bruins game.</v>

518
00:30:32.871 --> 00:30:37.370
I wish the Bruins and I mean,
Boston teams would do that more.
You know,

519
00:30:37.371 --> 00:30:39.380
our legends just like disappear.

520
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:43.190
He need to have them come back around and talk to the younger people about the

521
00:30:43.191 --> 00:30:47.900
fucking,
even if it's from another sport,
is still great just to see a champion.

522
00:30:47.901 --> 00:30:50.810
There was Babi Yar and Pedro Martinez.

523
00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:52.723
<v 0>MMM.</v>

524
00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.740
<v 1>Well,
like I always bothers me like Larry Bird.
Like he just like left.</v>

525
00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:58.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

526
00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:02.930
<v 1>You never see the guy come back.
But you know,
he was always like that.
Right?</v>

527
00:31:02.931 --> 00:31:06.860
He always wanted to go back to the country,
just be left alone,
you know,

528
00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.730
you know,
there's a bunch of billboards,
a couple billboards out here.

529
00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

530
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.690
<v 1>These fans put up asking Lebron to come out here.</v>

531
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:18.800
I mean that's how hard people go out here.
It's how much money they got.
You know,

532
00:31:18.801 --> 00:31:20.720
they can just pay for billboards.

533
00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:26.240
All these fucking wine and ass Laker fans because they've been bad for a couple

534
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.670
of years.
Give us the best player.

535
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
It's all they fucking threw out here.
Drives me nuts.
You know,

536
00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:39.620
it's just a Celtics.
Can't compete with it.
I've been saying this for years.

537
00:31:39.621 --> 00:31:43.540
This is our pitch.
Hey,
do you want to come to racist Boston?
Okay.

538
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:44.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

539
00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:49.980
<v 1>And deal with the winter in flux sixes or do you want to go to racist Los</v>

540
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:55.240
Angeles where it's summer every day and fuck movie stars and,

541
00:31:55.241 --> 00:31:59.650
and in supermodels.
We can't compete with that.

542
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.070
I don't think there's one infinity pool in Massachusetts.

543
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:10.480
Dude,
I got it back.
The odd break.
He could come over and skate on.
Um,
all right,

544
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:15.370
I got some shit to do.
Uh,
that's the podcast.
Go Bruins,
go Celtics,

545
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:20.710
Celtics game two against the 70 sixers,
mo cheeks.
Andrew.
Tony.

546
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:25.990
Huh?
Those are the six.
I remember,
um,
I'm going to be watching that tonight.

547
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.160
Actually no,
I'm going to be editing.

548
00:32:27.161 --> 00:32:30.490
F is for family and then I'm going to go do a spot somewhere possibly.
All right.

549
00:32:30.491 --> 00:32:34.170
That's it.
Listen to the music and enjoy another half hour of,
uh,

550
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:38.980
some Thursday afternoon podcasts from earlier this year or maybe one from years.

551
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:39.980
I have no idea.
Have

552
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.000
<v 3>a great weekend.
You see you on Monday.
You are mine.</v>

553
00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.180
<v 4>Let alone</v>

554
00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:59.890
live longer.

555
00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.470
Rafik scars.

556
00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:16.070
Hi Jello.

557
00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:20.310
<v 3>Oh,
lovely.</v>

558
00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.930
<v 4>Oh it was yours.</v>

559
00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.630
<v 5>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

560
00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.930
It's bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

561
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:36.790
May 3rd,
2010.
Um,
how the hell are you?

562
00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.500
I got some great news for you.

563
00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.980
The podcast is back.

564
00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:46.120
It is back up on iTunes and right now you're going to go to iTunes and you're

565
00:33:46.121 --> 00:33:50.100
probably not going to be able to find it because uh,
it's,

566
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.700
it's going to take three to six days for it to actually appear if you go to

567
00:33:54.701 --> 00:33:58.330
search it because iTunes is a pain in the ass as we've noticed over the last

568
00:33:58.331 --> 00:34:00.430
three months.
But my new,

569
00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:04.330
my new sort of web guy here is been able to fix the thing.

570
00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:09.780
And basically if you want to find all the podcasts since the beginning in 2007

571
00:34:10.841 --> 00:34:14.940
right up until now,
all you have to do is just,
yeah,

572
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:19.530
go into iTunes and a,

573
00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:20.740
once you're in Itunes,

574
00:34:20.741 --> 00:34:25.500
you click on advanced and then once you click on advance,
uh,

575
00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:29.450
what you do,
it's two down.
Click on subscribe,

576
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.320
subscribe to podcast,

577
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.690
and then this little window will open up.
And this is what you type in.
All right,

578
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:43.200
type in www dot [inaudible] dot com slash podcast and hit okay.

579
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.190
And um,
you know,
that'll be it.
You'll be in,

580
00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.880
you'll have all the podcasts from here on out until the end of time,

581
00:34:52.881 --> 00:34:57.560
unless something happens to me because,
uh,
this is my podcast thing,

582
00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.890
whatever the fuck it is,
I'm not with the g cast anymore.

583
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.140
I'm not with that Libson Shit.

584
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:06.080
I'm with my own thing so I don't have to deal with their fees.

585
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:09.530
I don't have to deal with them suddenly going out of business or switching the

586
00:35:09.531 --> 00:35:13.970
way that they do things or their intellectual properties or their fucking

587
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.770
whatever the hell it is that they're doing.
And this is why it took me so long.

588
00:35:18.771 --> 00:35:21.980
And I just want to thank everybody.
I appreciate the patience.

589
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.280
I even appreciate the angry emails people sent me like,
dude,

590
00:35:25.281 --> 00:35:28.600
what the fuck is going on?
Um,

591
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:32.660
I appreciate all of that because it meant you give a shit and that you like to

592
00:35:32.661 --> 00:35:35.930
listen to it.
So once again,
go into iTunes,

593
00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:40.380
at least on a Mac.
If you click on advanced the window,

594
00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:43.920
that opens up the second thing down,
we'll say subscribe to the podcast.

595
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:46.290
You open that up,
a window will open.

596
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.270
And in it you will write www dot [inaudible] dot com uh,

597
00:35:51.271 --> 00:35:54.000
slash podcast.
All right.

598
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:59.630
And it's the regular slash the one that starts further to the right and then

599
00:35:59.641 --> 00:36:01.530
comes to,
I don't even,
no,
no,
no.
I don't even,

600
00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:03.210
don't even try to describe it backslash,

601
00:36:03.211 --> 00:36:07.380
I don't even fucking know how to tell you that.
Um,
so that's it.

602
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:12.450
And one of the thing I have to hype is we have our fan page now here on the bill

603
00:36:12.451 --> 00:36:16.110
burr a Monday morning podcast and that one is uh,

604
00:36:16.111 --> 00:36:21.111
www dot the capital m capital m a capital p and then your spelling podcast.

605
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:31.550
I'm the worst www dot the [inaudible] podcast.com and m m in the P of podcast to

606
00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:34.170
capitalized.
That's how so go on there.

607
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.920
Leave your comments if you want to check out some pictures of some of the fucked

608
00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:41.190
up references that will make two whatever podcast you're listening to,

609
00:36:41.191 --> 00:36:44.280
there'll be up there.
I actually asked you guys some questions on there.

610
00:36:44.281 --> 00:36:45.480
I haven't done that in a couple of weeks,

611
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:50.550
but finally everything should be up and running and that was probably the

612
00:36:50.551 --> 00:36:51.271
driest,

613
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:55.620
most unfunny three minutes and 25 seconds I've ever done on the podcast,

614
00:36:55.621 --> 00:36:57.240
but I had to get that information out there.

615
00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:01.920
I'm going to send out a mass email and I'm going to put it up on Facebook and on

616
00:37:01.921 --> 00:37:04.890
my space.
All that information that I just gave you.

617
00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:07.920
And if you know other podcast listeners,
if you want to email that,

618
00:37:07.921 --> 00:37:11.220
what I just said,
email it to them and maybe I can,
uh,

619
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.370
maybe I can build it back up again.
You know,

620
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:17.250
it was kind of like a,
uh,

621
00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.620
something that went out of business and then they was kinda like the Jay Leno

622
00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:21.230
show.
I went away for a minute.

623
00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:24.960
Now I'm back and I'm trying to get my ratings back again.
Granted,

624
00:37:24.961 --> 00:37:27.570
I didn't kick out some unsuspecting redhead.

625
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:32.750
I kicked myself out and I am an unsuspecting redhead and speaking of redheads,

626
00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.850
God damn,
and am I good with the fucking segues?

627
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.980
Somebody sent me something this week.

628
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.350
They sent me a video and they were like,
uh,

629
00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:48.060
what did you say that like David tell a video,
somebody sent me a video and said,

630
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.240
you gotta check this thing out or whatever.
I don't know if you've seen this yet,

631
00:37:51.241 --> 00:37:55.600
but there is a video on youtube.
Um,
you guys familiar with the artist?
Uh,

632
00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:59.310
Mia,
she did that song,
I believe it was it paper planes.

633
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:03.540
Um,
and you know,
it's that song you couldn't fucking get away from last year.

634
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.980
What was like an awesome song.

635
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:09.060
And then every filmmaker in America seem to fall in love with it and put it in

636
00:38:09.061 --> 00:38:12.270
their movie or even something like Pineapple Express.

637
00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:16.650
It wasn't even in the movie,
but they still put it in the trailer.
All right.

638
00:38:16.651 --> 00:38:21.600
I like paper and I like planes and I liked something and I'm fucking lame.

639
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:26.820
Maybe something man,
you sound man.
You sound yes bill.
We know how there's,

640
00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:29.520
there's one,
there's a bed cover this,
my cover of a,

641
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.780
a paper planes or whatever.
I know it's not called paper planes,

642
00:38:33.781 --> 00:38:38.330
it's called something else.
Something with paper in it,
you know.
So anyway,

643
00:38:38.331 --> 00:38:43.030
she has a new video out that somebody brought to my attention and they hear the

644
00:38:43.031 --> 00:38:44.770
relaxed confidence in my voice.
Now.

645
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:48.340
I feel so much better now than I know my podcast is back up on Itunes,

646
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.230
even though for three to six days,

647
00:38:50.231 --> 00:38:54.430
most of you will not know that because you won't be able to find it because you

648
00:38:54.431 --> 00:38:58.360
won't have heard this.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

649
00:38:58.361 --> 00:39:01.930
so somebody sent me this thing,
this,
uh,
this video.
Um,

650
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:06.700
MIA has a new video called born free.
All right?

651
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.980
So they should go,
you should check this video out.

652
00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:11.410
And it's actually a video of my girlfriend already showed me.
She goes,

653
00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:16.210
I want you to see this.
Okay.
And it just watch you with an open mind.

654
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.540
I don't even want you to create a thigh that just watch it.
Okay.

655
00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:24.010
Can you do me the,
can you just promise me that you're not going to go,
oh,
gee,

656
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:28.450
just two seconds into it.
Can you please?
So I said,
yeah,
fine.

657
00:39:28.451 --> 00:39:33.430
I'll sit down and I watch it and it's basically a not to whatever.

658
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:36.940
I'm going to ruin it here.
All right,
spoiler alert.

659
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:42.360
Um,
basically the video is about,
uh,

660
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.750
it's not really army guys,

661
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:48.340
but it's more like a sort of riot police guys,
white dudes.

662
00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:52.720
I think all white dudes and like riot police and they're a,

663
00:39:52.721 --> 00:39:56.590
they bust into this apartment building that looks like it's in the Middle East.

664
00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.210
It's got that Middle East sort of a five to it.
Um,

665
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.770
which basically means,
you know,

666
00:40:02.771 --> 00:40:05.080
there's some bullet holes with some sand in the background.

667
00:40:05.081 --> 00:40:09.010
To me that's the Middle East,
you know,
could be Miami.
I don't fucking know.
Right?

668
00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:12.940
So I'm,
I'm watching this thing and they basically,
they just go through this,

669
00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.570
this apartment complex.
It was just horrifically kicking in doors,

670
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.550
violating everybody's rights.

671
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:21.040
They don't give a shit what people are doing because they're looking for this

672
00:40:21.041 --> 00:40:24.760
one dude and they find the dude and they grabbed the guy,
right?

673
00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:28.320
There's redheaded white dude,
sort of a buzz cut I guess.
And they grab him,

674
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:31.300
he does want to go and they're fighting him and they bring him downstairs and

675
00:40:31.301 --> 00:40:35.530
then they put them on a bus and he gets on the bus and it's a whole bunch of

676
00:40:35.531 --> 00:40:37.870
other redheads.
It's a whole,

677
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:42.280
it's a whole bus full of red heads.
All right.

678
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.270
And I'm right there.
I was like,
oh Jesus.

679
00:40:46.271 --> 00:40:50.050
But I didn't say anything because I promised my lovely girlfriend.

680
00:40:50.051 --> 00:40:53.680
I'd watched the whole thing.
So long story short,
they drive him to a camp,

681
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.950
they have them get off the bus and then they make 'em run.

682
00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:00.460
So that all the police can basically kill them and they haven't run through

683
00:41:00.461 --> 00:41:02.290
minefields and all that type of shit.

684
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.850
And it's basically commenting on the racial profiling,

685
00:41:06.851 --> 00:41:07.900
the genocide,

686
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:12.280
and some of the stuff that has gone on in the past and has gone evidently going

687
00:41:12.281 --> 00:41:14.920
on right now.
All right.

688
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.770
It made no references to Iraq,

689
00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:22.030
but it definitely had a Iraq sort of a feel to it,

690
00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:26.020
except it was redheads.
So in the end,
my girl was like,
well,
what did you,

691
00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:30.160
they like these red heads that fucking arms are flying off.
All right.

692
00:41:30.161 --> 00:41:32.950
They're beaten him with clubs,
they're doing all this horrific shit.

693
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:37.510
Him To this sea of red heads.
And she said,
what did you think?
And again,

694
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:40.580
this is basic and I'm also answering this,
a person who sent it to me,

695
00:41:40.581 --> 00:41:41.414
what I thought of it.

696
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:46.280
I thought it was a great idea for a video and I thought it could have made a

697
00:41:46.281 --> 00:41:51.281
good point if they didn't pick the singled out group of redheads for the simple

698
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:56.510
fact
that,
uh,

699
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.520
nobody gives a shit about redheads.

700
00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:06.310
We're just,
I don't know what it is.
People don't,
they,

701
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:09.610
they just don't care about us.
You know,
I remember when Kanye West was saying,

702
00:42:09.611 --> 00:42:13.210
you know,
George Bush doesn't care about black people.
Well,

703
00:42:13.211 --> 00:42:16.060
nobody cares about white people.
So you know,

704
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:19.840
at least somebody cares about black people.
It's just George.
George doesn't,

705
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:23.290
you know,
but there's,
there's people who do,

706
00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:24.693
<v 6>okay,</v>

707
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:30.290
<v 5>that was my thing.
The second they decided redheads,
it just became a comedy.</v>

708
00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:35.380
And I got to admit it was weird because I've never seen a bus load of redheads.

709
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:39.860
It dawned on me,
I've never seen that.
Like I've seen a busload of like,
you know,

710
00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:42.830
generally speaking,
you look on a bus,
it's a bunch of people with brown hair,

711
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:47.740
the occasional blonde,
right.
And uh,

712
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.400
you know,
maybe a redhead,
every five buses,
there'll be one redhead.

713
00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:55.810
But an entire busload of redheads was funny to me.

714
00:42:55.811 --> 00:42:59.290
And all sleep also,
it was oddly disturbing.

715
00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:05.540
It was,
they were weird looking.
And I realized in that moment,

716
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.720
even as a redhead,
I'm going let go.
It was weird looking sons of bitches.

717
00:43:08.721 --> 00:43:13.250
And I realized that this is the deal with red heads.
We are not the main course.

718
00:43:13.251 --> 00:43:17.900
We are a spice.
We are the spice in like,
uh,

719
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:22.650
I dunno with like red pepper flakes that you put on,
like I don't know,

720
00:43:22.651 --> 00:43:25.710
a steak or something.
Do you ordered something in a restaurant?

721
00:43:25.711 --> 00:43:28.020
And all they brought over was the spice.
You'd be like,
dude,

722
00:43:28.021 --> 00:43:31.740
what the fuck was the meal?
That's what,
that's what redheads do.

723
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:34.950
That's our job with people.

724
00:43:34.951 --> 00:43:37.860
You go to a baseball game and you just sit in there going,
Jesus Christ,

725
00:43:37.861 --> 00:43:42.390
how many fucking Brunettes can I look at?
Bam.
As a redhead.
Oh Shit is a red head.

726
00:43:42.391 --> 00:43:45.840
Right.
Resets your brain.
And he can,
we'll look at some more brunettes now.

727
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:49.050
That's what we do.
So a long story short,

728
00:43:49.051 --> 00:43:51.880
that's what I thought I thought about the video.
I thought it was a,
uh,

729
00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.380
just cause they pay,
I don't know who else they could have picked.

730
00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:56.580
I understand what they're saying.

731
00:43:56.581 --> 00:43:59.370
What if they rounded up this certain segment of white people?

732
00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:03.880
Would you give a fuck now?
You know,
I guess,

733
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:08.250
you know,
as always,
I,
I don't,
I don't fucking know,
but like,

734
00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.580
because it was red heads,

735
00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.870
I just felt at that point the second they started running through the minefield,

736
00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:18.160
they should have had a,
they should have had like Benny Hill music,

737
00:44:18.161 --> 00:44:20.590
Wayne Wayne man pick a day of data and say blew him up.

738
00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.570
Cause it just was funny to me and weird.

739
00:44:22.571 --> 00:44:27.520
It was oddly like if you were walking down the street and all of a sudden like

740
00:44:27.521 --> 00:44:29.860
just a group of redheads was just walking the other way.

741
00:44:29.861 --> 00:44:34.410
You can't tell me that you wouldn't be creeped out or uncomfortable just for the

742
00:44:34.411 --> 00:44:37.770
mere fact that you've never seen.
It seems like those are my fucking people.

743
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.410
And I saw them all together and I was weirded out by it.

744
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:42.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

745
00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:46.310
<v 5>Am I a self hating redhead?
I don't think I am.
I just,
I dunno.</v>

746
00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:50.450
So check it out.
It's called,
uh,
you want to see a bunch of redheads get,

747
00:44:50.451 --> 00:44:53.390
get beat up and blown up.
There you go.

748
00:44:53.391 --> 00:44:57.620
I mean fucking South Park did that shit where was kick a ginger day and kids

749
00:44:57.621 --> 00:45:00.950
actually did it.
They actually went out and fucking did it.

750
00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:04.880
You couldn't have that about any other group without some sort of outrage,

751
00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:10.560
you know,
flicked some Jewish guys balls day,
you can never have that.

752
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:12.080
They'd be,
they'd be considered antisemetic.

753
00:45:12.081 --> 00:45:14.880
You'd be taken off the fucking air if you said something about black people,

754
00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:16.520
you know,
redheads.
I Dunno,

755
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:21.270
we fall into those weird cracks where were white dudes,
so no one gives a shit.

756
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:26.400
But,
uh,
are we a silent minority?

757
00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:31.440
I stupid's about that.
How redheads are portrayed in the movies,
you know,

758
00:45:31.441 --> 00:45:33.300
we're never the cool guy.
We never out.

759
00:45:33.301 --> 00:45:36.390
We're always the friend with a guy in the van.

760
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.830
You know when Tom Cruise is in that gone,
you know,

761
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.200
I'm like sitting there in a van and a laptop.

762
00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:46.970
He skis run around with like fucking Halle Berry or some other ingenue.

763
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:51.990
You gotta give me more time and then I'm in the band.
Oh,
I'll try,
you know,

764
00:45:51.991 --> 00:45:56.070
and I'm clicking away on my laptop.
That's what I'm doing.
No Pussy,
no sunshine,

765
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:59.490
no pussy.
Okay.
Since the beginning of filmmaking,

766
00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:01.930
<v 0>Huh?
Oh,</v>

767
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:06.150
<v 5>Richie Cunningham.
Howdy duty.</v>

768
00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:07.683
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

769
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:12.950
<v 5>David Caruso was our only fucking shot and he blew it.
The fuck.</v>

770
00:46:12.951 --> 00:46:16.160
I just talk about this shit on stage.
You fucking blew it.
So I mean,
I don't know.

771
00:46:16.161 --> 00:46:21.020
That's just how we're,
uh,
Eric [inaudible].
Eric Stoltz came close,
he can close,

772
00:46:21.021 --> 00:46:24.170
but then he did the movie mask and once again reminded everybody that he was

773
00:46:24.171 --> 00:46:28.640
genetically compromised.
Um,
what else

774
00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:35.470
has there been one?
Even like Shaun White,
the baddest snowboard in the world,

775
00:46:35.471 --> 00:46:40.240
what they call them,
the flying tomato.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thanks.

776
00:46:40.241 --> 00:46:42.790
Thanks for that.
That fucking horrific fucking nickname.

777
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:45.580
There is no god damn respect.
You know?

778
00:46:45.581 --> 00:46:50.581
And here I am a redhead myself and I watched that video and I thought it was

779
00:46:50.591 --> 00:46:53.500
funny.
We thought it'd be funny.

780
00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:57.160
Remember that Joe Piscopo when he used to do Allen Funt we thought it'd be
funny.

781
00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:01.940
All right,
so let's plow ahead here.
That's what I thought about that shit.
Um,

782
00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.850
I did a lot of TV watching this week,

783
00:47:03.851 --> 00:47:08.851
but I'm going to try to get back to some of the topics here on the podcast.

784
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:12.640
Oh,
here's a little story for you.
I was going to tell you,
I forgot,

785
00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:15.430
I've actually already recorded this podcast and recorded it last night,

786
00:47:15.431 --> 00:47:17.050
but I was tired and I was grumpy.

787
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:21.070
I was in a bad mood because I had another incident with my downstairs neighbor,

788
00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.540
the continuing story of the downstairs fucking neighbor.

789
00:47:25.541 --> 00:47:29.170
And for those of you who are new to my podcast,
I have a neighbor downstairs,

790
00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.560
classic,
you know,
old guy.
And uh,

791
00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:35.840
we have hardwood floors and he thinks we make entirely too much noise and he

792
00:47:35.841 --> 00:47:38.220
fucking hates us.
So,
uh,

793
00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:42.280
but I confronted the guy so he doesn't yell at us anymore.

794
00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.400
And uh,

795
00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:49.070
yesterday I was hanging out and I was doing what most people of my age do.

796
00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.970
41 years old.
What do you do?
A,
you helping out your wife,

797
00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.940
you'd taken the kids to the park.
Fuck.
Now you're not even married.

798
00:47:55.941 --> 00:47:58.250
You don't have kids.
You know what you're doing.
You're just,

799
00:47:58.251 --> 00:48:01.820
you're taking your LP of,
for those about to rock that you just bought

800
00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.820
and you're putting it on your turntable because you know that Angus is always in

801
00:48:07.821 --> 00:48:12.170
the right speaker and Malcolm is always in the left and you want to learn the

802
00:48:12.171 --> 00:48:15.980
rhythm to evil walks.
That's all I wanted to do.
People,

803
00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:20.480
I wasn't hurting anybody.
All right.
And,
and for underrated,

804
00:48:20.481 --> 00:48:25.220
overrated.
Very underrated.
ACDC album is the,
for those about to rock,

805
00:48:25.221 --> 00:48:28.700
the problem was,
is they would have following the back in black album,

806
00:48:28.701 --> 00:48:32.810
but if there's any guitar players out there,
he got to fucking listen to the,

807
00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:37.120
to the side.
Uh,
that album.
All right.

808
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:42.210
Evil walks,
cod,
um,
the whole,

809
00:48:42.211 --> 00:48:44.190
the whole backside.
I love him.
I'm trying to remember what the,

810
00:48:44.191 --> 00:48:47.040
what the last song is on that one.

811
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:51.740
I can't do nothing.
Right.
Eh,

812
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:56.350
that had spellbound as another great one.

813
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.330
And it's just,
I dunno,
I,

814
00:48:58.331 --> 00:49:03.331
it's still the craziest thing where now that I've started playing guitar is I am

815
00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:08.790
finding a whole nother genius level to ACDC music that I've now been listening

816
00:49:08.951 --> 00:49:13.880
to for 30 fucking years,
if he can believe it.
Malcolm is an APP in Angus,

817
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:18.760
they're fucking geniuses.
So this is all I want to do is,

818
00:49:18.761 --> 00:49:20.710
you know,
I'm never going to be able to,
well who knows,

819
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:24.220
maybe if I play till I'm 65 I'll actually be able to play a couple of Angus

820
00:49:24.221 --> 00:49:27.040
leads if I stick with it.
But like I just wanted,

821
00:49:27.041 --> 00:49:28.610
that's why I started playing guitars.

822
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:30.610
Like I just want to be able to play the shit that Malcolm Place.

823
00:49:30.611 --> 00:49:31.960
Just the rhythm underneath.
Right?

824
00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:36.350
<v 7>So that's all I'm doing.
I'm sitting there with my fucking,
my phonograph,</v>

825
00:49:36.351 --> 00:49:39.050
my record player,
my stereo,
whatever you want to call it.

826
00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:43.040
And I'm getting ready to switch the balance all the way over to the left so I

827
00:49:43.041 --> 00:49:45.110
can figure out what,
what Malcolm is doing.

828
00:49:45.111 --> 00:49:48.710
What the fuck does Malcolm do that makes you,

829
00:49:48.711 --> 00:49:52.700
if you had in the last row of the fucking Roman Coliseum,

830
00:49:52.701 --> 00:49:56.210
he still blowing you out of the back of the thing.
You know,

831
00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:58.550
it's all about not playing the high e with those guys.

832
00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:01.820
They're fucking maniacs anyways,
so this is what I want to do.

833
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.020
So I switch it over to the left side and I find out my left side speakers fucked

834
00:50:06.021 --> 00:50:06.854
up.

835
00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.490
<v 5>Oh my God.
Jesus Christ on trying to fix the thing.</v>

836
00:50:09.491 --> 00:50:11.930
And as I reached behind it and I got this little,
I don't know what it is,

837
00:50:11.931 --> 00:50:13.690
as you plug the speaker into this little,

838
00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.330
it's like the size of like a matchbox car,
right?

839
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.990
And I knock it out and it hits the floor,
boom,
hits the floor.
And I was like,

840
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.720
I literally made that face like,
you know,

841
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.930
cause I don't want to piss off the fucking bear downstairs,
right?

842
00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:28.970
So he doesn't yell at us anymore.
So you know what this Douche bag does?

843
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.220
He gets up,
don't,
don't,
don't,
don't blow my hair.

844
00:50:31.221 --> 00:50:35.030
I'm walking over to his door and he opens up his door and then slams.

845
00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:36.680
It is hard as he can.

846
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:42.430
And I really wish that I was mature enough as,

847
00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:45.110
as an adult to just laugh that off.

848
00:50:45.111 --> 00:50:50.111
But it made me so fucking mad because I literally feel like this is like the,

849
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:56.450
the,
the,
um,
I'm walking around on egg shells,
male goddamn apartment,
you know,

850
00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:02.480
here I dropped,
I dropped one fucking thing all day and I literally go like,

851
00:51:02.481 --> 00:51:06.560
Oh my God,
what did I do?
I'm literally on egg shells and you know,
and,

852
00:51:06.561 --> 00:51:09.980
and this is what always happens to me.
I always get on egg shells around people.

853
00:51:09.981 --> 00:51:10.431
Initially.

854
00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:15.431
That's my initial reaction when someone's a dick is I kind of back off a little

855
00:51:15.621 --> 00:51:19.160
bit,
you know?
And then I,
then I always go into,
wait a minute,

856
00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:23.300
what are you really tip toeing around?
Or whatever the fuck it is I'm doing.

857
00:51:23.301 --> 00:51:27.920
And then I get mad.
And,
uh,
so that's what happened with that guy.

858
00:51:27.921 --> 00:51:31.190
And he's just,
it's just like,
I don't know how to solve this.
It's an old guy.

859
00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.860
I can't yell at them.
I just can't.
It's like,

860
00:51:33.861 --> 00:51:37.850
it goes against how I was brought up.
It's common decency.

861
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.030
He's an old son of a bitch,
whatever.
He's fucking miserable.

862
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:45.230
But he keeps doing this,
this fucking Alpha male shit.

863
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:49.070
Well you slamming the door like,
like,

864
00:51:49.071 --> 00:51:51.620
I dunno if I'm wrong to read it that way.
Like,

865
00:51:51.621 --> 00:51:54.010
like what do you think is some sort of fucking bad ass?

866
00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.660
Remember that commercial where you want to dance?
Oh man,

867
00:51:56.661 --> 00:52:00.700
you want to fucking dance?
That's what I feel like.
No one walking up in a swipe.

868
00:52:00.701 --> 00:52:02.240
Can I open these goddamn blinds?

869
00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:06.700
It's probably going to be upset with the noise I just made.
There
you go.

870
00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:10.400
Move the screen.
Ah,
fuck.
This thing's gonna slam open.
Now watch this.

871
00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:15.230
So it happens every week.
There we go.
Now it's open.
Now it's open.

872
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:18.740
Um,
yeah,
so I was dealing with that fucking guy.
So anyway,

873
00:52:18.741 --> 00:52:21.600
so I did a podcast last night and just the,

874
00:52:21.601 --> 00:52:25.490
the anger I had for that guy was just running through the entire thing.

875
00:52:25.491 --> 00:52:27.680
And I was like,
who wants to listen to an angry son of a bitch?

876
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:30.860
And I know what you're thinking.
Bell.
You know,
that's how I think he a funniest.

877
00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:35.180
When you get mad,
it was a different kind of mad.
It was like a serious like,
dude,

878
00:52:35.181 --> 00:52:39.890
why don't you just fucking get over it?
Kind of mad.
So,
so anyways,
oh,

879
00:52:39.891 --> 00:52:41.300
here's the,
here's a story I wanted to tell you.

880
00:52:41.301 --> 00:52:43.680
I had a gay little moment yesterday at a,
uh,

881
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.490
and I was hanging out with my girlfriend.
You know,

882
00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:50.840
you ever had one of those moments,
you know,
you have,
I was,
uh,

883
00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:55.040
driving back from somewhere.
Oh,

884
00:52:55.041 --> 00:52:59.540
a vegetarian restaurant that my girlfriend wanted to go to.
She's like,

885
00:52:59.541 --> 00:53:03.410
you want to go to,
you want to go to Eddie cucumber earth?
And I'm like,

886
00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:04.813
no.

887
00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:08.300
But I told her I'd take her out to breakfast and then it became lunch and then

888
00:53:08.301 --> 00:53:10.640
she wants to go to this fucking Vegan place.
Right.

889
00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.950
You know where they have like,
you know,

890
00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:20.120
the chef should literally come out and be like,
okay,
who likes impressions?

891
00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.520
All right,
this is my impression of Bacon.

892
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:28.010
He just wheels out some brown soy that he,
that he fucking,

893
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:33.000
that's all it is.
It's,
it's a bunch of,
it's soy.

894
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:38.420
Soy is like the rich little of a Vegan restaurant where it can fucking imitate

895
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.020
and everybody but not quite.

896
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.010
It's more like rich little in the 80s when he stopped working on his impressions

897
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:44.850
and he,

898
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:48.450
and he was still like nightly doing like an impression of like Lyndon B Johnson.

899
00:53:48.451 --> 00:53:51.450
It's like,
dude,
we're already up to the fucking first George Bush,

900
00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:56.400
which we're not aware of yet that it is the first George Bush unless we're Marty

901
00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:01.280
McFly.
So anyways,
uh,
so we go there,
we fucking eat there.
Um,

902
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.840
and we drive him back.
She goes,
I want to get some ice cream.

903
00:54:03.841 --> 00:54:06.960
You want to get some ice cream?
I know a great ice cream place.
So I said,

904
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:11.790
fuck yeah,
I love ice cream.
I love it.
I like to eat ice cream.

905
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:16.410
You know,
I'm not ashamed of it.
I know,
you know,
who doesn't like ice cream,

906
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:19.920
you know,
make people who are lactose intolerant,
maybe they don't like it.

907
00:54:19.921 --> 00:54:23.760
People who,
who didn't floss throughout their life so it hurts their teeth.

908
00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.171
You know,
there's one,

909
00:54:25.171 --> 00:54:28.620
few youngsters brush and floss every night because if you don't,

910
00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:33.270
someday ice cream is going to hurt your teeth and you'll never be able to enjoy

911
00:54:33.271 --> 00:54:34.860
it again.
You know,

912
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:39.480
some day you'll have full upper and lower dentures sitting there just fucking

913
00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:43.470
doing that thing.
You know,
you know,
people chew when they have dentures,

914
00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:47.370
they do that thing where they look like they're trying to blow a bubble with

915
00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:50.910
their food.
For some reason that tongue has to stick out like a Goddamn Lama.

916
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:55.330
You don't want to do that shit.
So anyways,
I'm like,
yeah,
let's go.
So,
um,

917
00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:00.660
why am I walking around?
I don't know why I'm walking around.
What the,

918
00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:05.520
why am I questioning it?
I felt like walking around,
I'm walking around.
Um,

919
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.500
so anyways,
uh,
so we'd go to this,

920
00:55:07.501 --> 00:55:10.800
this ice cream place and of course it's not like the old school ones that I used

921
00:55:10.801 --> 00:55:14.640
to go to like friendly's and Brigham's where you just walked in and there was

922
00:55:14.641 --> 00:55:18.240
like,
you know,
what do you want?
You want chocolate,
you want vanilla,

923
00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.770
he wants strawberry,
you know,
rocky road,
they had a couple of NL,

924
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.400
like rocky road.
I don't like marshmallows.
I really don't.

925
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.810
They just did fucking gross.
That did just,
I dunno.

926
00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:33.540
Usually when something's gooey it makes it good,
like melted cheese.

927
00:55:33.541 --> 00:55:36.750
But this marshmallow is a fucking disgusting,
you know.

928
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.790
Oh you douchebags out there making s'mores.

929
00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:41.900
I don't know what the fuck's wrong with you.
But anyways,
so we go to that,

930
00:55:41.901 --> 00:55:44.820
we go to this,
uh,
he go to this place and we walk in.

931
00:55:44.821 --> 00:55:48.180
It's one of these places now where they have all these new fucking,

932
00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:49.740
I don't know what kind of flavors they got.

933
00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:53.040
I was gonna say funky flavors and I realized that I shouldn't use that word.

934
00:55:53.041 --> 00:55:56.700
So I had to go back to fucking,
I was like,
should I say it?
Should I not say it?

935
00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:59.490
Fucking flavors.
Um,

936
00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:03.720
they had like red velvet cake,
ice cream.
I mean,

937
00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:06.450
and it doesn't even make sense anymore.
So they had another one that was like,

938
00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:10.980
you know,
Carmel something and it had great nuts on the top of them.
Right.

939
00:56:10.981 --> 00:56:11.820
So this is the deal.

940
00:56:11.821 --> 00:56:15.330
I don't know if he'd ever been one of these designer ice cream places,

941
00:56:15.331 --> 00:56:18.870
but what they do is their flavors are so fucked up.
You've never had them before.

942
00:56:18.871 --> 00:56:20.340
So you got it.
You want to try them out.

943
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:24.550
So how it works is it's a scoop a little bit out with that little,

944
00:56:24.551 --> 00:56:27.640
this little plastic spoon,
and then they hand it to you and then you eat it.

945
00:56:27.641 --> 00:56:28.474
You're like,
oh,

946
00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:30.410
<v 7>I liked that one.
Let me try this.</v>

947
00:56:30.411 --> 00:56:34.580
Once my girlfriend's doing that and this is dude scooping the ice cream out.

948
00:56:34.581 --> 00:56:36.440
So it's like already,
it's just like weird.

949
00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:39.470
Like which one you want to try and even like the name.
So let me,

950
00:56:39.471 --> 00:56:42.860
let me try the triple foofy fucking one.
Right?
So I try,
I go,

951
00:56:42.861 --> 00:56:44.150
let me try the great nut one.
Right?

952
00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:48.560
So we scoops a little bit out and then he goes to,
he goes to,

953
00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:53.450
because they hand it to me and the spoon is so small,

954
00:56:53.451 --> 00:56:54.380
there's dislike.

955
00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:59.600
There's no way for me to take it from without brushing my hand.
He gets his hand,

956
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:03.930
you know?
And then I also,
I have to take it in a very,
a very light,

957
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:06.680
delicate way because I don't want to spill the ice cream.

958
00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:10.640
So my hand grazes his hand,
you know,

959
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:14.900
like we're in lady and the tramp fucking eaten spaghetti in a hand kind of way.

960
00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:15.740
Right.

961
00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:20.630
And I take it from him and then I eat the ice cream and it just,

962
00:57:20.631 --> 00:57:24.860
it just,
there was something about it that just felt wrong.
Okay.

963
00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:26.900
I just sort of,
it,
it was intimate.

964
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:31.520
I had an intimate moment with his hand in my hand and then I put a sweet treat

965
00:57:31.521 --> 00:57:34.070
into my mouth afterwards and told him it was good.

966
00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:39.573
<v 6>Okay.</v>

967
00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:44.930
<v 7>So is the best part.
So I don't give a fuck what that ice cream was.
Felt like.</v>

968
00:57:44.931 --> 00:57:46.880
I was like,
I'm taking that shit right now.
Let me,

969
00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:50.510
let me get that flavor cause I don't know if I can do that again.
And uh,

970
00:57:50.511 --> 00:57:54.110
you know,
I dunno.
I'll either start blushing or asked for your phone number.

971
00:57:54.111 --> 00:57:57.980
I don't know what's going to happen.
So the best part was after I go,
yeah,

972
00:57:57.981 --> 00:58:02.430
let me just get that great enough flavor.
My girl goes,
oh no,
you get two scoops.

973
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:05.510
Two different flavors.
What other ones you want to try?
And I'm like that one.

974
00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:09.110
The one right next to it.
I don't think they go well together.

975
00:58:09.111 --> 00:58:12.470
I don't give a fuck.
Can we end this?

976
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.150
What does that cowboy movie with a two gay cowboys in the,
uh,

977
00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:21.650
Brokeback mountain moment with the ice cream we just ended.
Oh God.

978
00:58:21.651 --> 00:58:22.880
I'm getting creeped out right now.

979
00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.930
<v 5>I'll tell you something else.
Just fucking,
it was worth it,
man.</v>

980
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:29.600
Ice Cream was unbelievable with the grape nuts on it and telling you it's worth

981
00:58:29.601 --> 00:58:34.280
it.
It's worth grazing another man's hands just to try it.

982
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:37.430
It's fucking phenomenal.
Um,
so there you go.
That was my,

983
00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:40.880
that was my little moment.
And uh,
the ice cream is so good.

984
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:44.690
I'm going to go there again and I'm going to try my best to get a female the

985
00:58:44.691 --> 00:58:48.670
next time I have to do that.
That might get dangerous.
Right.
And then what else?

986
00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:49.603
Fucking,

987
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:51.450
<v 6>okay.</v>

988
00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:53.790
<v 5>No,
no,
no.
I'm going to,
we to go down.
I don't do sex jokes.
Okay.</v>

989
00:58:53.791 --> 00:58:57.420
The two fucking easy.
All right.
I just trashed Jesus.
All right,

990
00:58:57.421 --> 00:59:00.960
so that was my gay little moment of the week.
Um,
I can't get fucking comfortable.

991
00:59:00.961 --> 00:59:03.990
Why can't I?
I can't.
I'm standing up.
I'm sitting back down.

992
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:06.240
My foot feels a lot better.
By the way.

993
00:59:06.241 --> 00:59:10.590
I want to thank the D I had a couple of doctors who actually listened to this,

994
00:59:10.591 --> 00:59:13.620
or at least they say they are.
And uh,
whoever it was,

995
00:59:13.621 --> 00:59:18.550
the one who told me to take a bottle of water and freeze it in the fridge and

996
00:59:18.570 --> 00:59:22.850
role that underneath the arch of my foot.
It's done fucking wonders.

997
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.200
So pass it on.
If you have a fuck up the Archie or foot.

998
00:59:27.201 --> 00:59:30.020
And every time he go to take a step and it feels like there's,
there's,

999
00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:35.021
there's an invisible smurf just stabbing the bottom of your foot.

1000
00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:40.280
Just do a bunch of calf stretches,
almost like runners.
Stretches is what you do.

1001
00:59:40.281 --> 00:59:42.290
And then like,
like three,
four times a day,

1002
00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:46.370
just roll a frozen bottle of water underneath your arch.

1003
00:59:46.371 --> 00:59:49.970
It's like you're massaging it and icing it all at the same time.

1004
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:52.820
And I gotta tell you want to talk about a fucking ice cream headache.

1005
00:59:52.821 --> 00:59:57.440
Take a frozen bottle of water and stick it on the bottom of your foot.
Um,

1006
00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:00.740
but you know,
you get used to it,
you get fucking used to it.

1007
01:00:00.741 --> 01:00:03.710
So I want to thank whoever,
uh,
whoever told me to do that,

1008
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:08.090
I somehow lost the email with all my web stuff this week.
Um,

1009
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:13.400
but anyways,
plowing ahead here.
I have,
I have more exciting news right now.

1010
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:17.810
I am currently getting ready to do my fifth,
uh,

1011
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:21.770
performance on the David Letterman program.
Number five.

1012
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:26.480
My fifth time going to go out there and do some standup and,
uh,

1013
01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.930
I'm putting together the set right now.
I'm very confident.

1014
01:00:29.931 --> 01:00:33.110
I think everything's going good.
It's ahead of schedule.

1015
01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.010
And tonight I'm literally going to sit down and before I go out,

1016
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:40.460
I have it all worked out and I just have to type it out.

1017
01:00:40.461 --> 01:00:44.450
Like my jokes are easily,
I can take the curse words out easily.

1018
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:48.710
Um,
because so much of my cursing is not even necessary.

1019
01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.970
I just liked to do it.
And then,
cause I love getting the emails,

1020
01:00:52.971 --> 01:00:55.790
like so much of your career thing,
you don't even need it.

1021
01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:03.310
Those fucking people who sit there and they think that clean comedy is like this

1022
01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:08.520
unbelievable thing.
Like highly you do it.

1023
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.950
I just don't understand it.
You know it's,
I'm not saying it's,
it's,

1024
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:18.010
it's a bad thing,
but the way people like that,
that right there,
that's a peer,

1025
01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.940
that's pure fuck.

1026
01:01:19.941 --> 01:01:23.240
You know what that that's like watching Lawrence Welk in because they're just so

1027
01:01:23.241 --> 01:01:28.160
wholesome that you just think that none of those guys in that band or a racist,

1028
01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:33.410
you know,
you know people who will watch clean comedy and then just think,

1029
01:01:33.411 --> 01:01:35.710
see right there,
that's what comedy is on Anthony.

1030
01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:39.740
And then those are the same people who like their neighbor ends up being a

1031
01:01:39.741 --> 01:01:43.670
serial killer.
Right.
And they always say the same shit.
He was so nice.

1032
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.890
Like what is your definition of Nice?

1033
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:50.570
Because they say hello to you every morning.
Good morning.
How are you?

1034
01:01:50.571 --> 01:01:53.570
Nice weather we're having,
he's so nice.
He always says hello.

1035
01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:01.010
He's or he never curses.
It's wholesome.
It's wholesome comedy.
You know?

1036
01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:05.090
Look at fucking Hugh Grant.
Could you get any more wholesome than that guy?

1037
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:10.070
Hugh grant killed the hookers seen on sunset.

1038
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:11.930
I learned that when he got busted,

1039
01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:15.050
they used to be hookers walking up and down the street back in the fucking hay

1040
01:02:15.051 --> 01:02:15.530
day.

1041
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:20.130
But because that guy didn't even have the decency to pull down the fucking side

1042
01:02:20.131 --> 01:02:23.670
street,
that guy's got one blowing him as he goes into in and out Burger,

1043
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.410
you know?
But you look at his movies and he plays this bumbling.
Oh,

1044
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:34.200
he's out there bang and hawkers so all you fucks,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm sick of it.

1045
01:02:34.201 --> 01:02:36.750
You're idiots.
You Idiots.
Your,
your,
your,

1046
01:02:36.751 --> 01:02:41.310
your basis for somebody being nice is they say nice things,

1047
01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:47.010
you know?
Have you taken any psychology classes?
Have you ever,
I don't know what,

1048
01:02:47.011 --> 01:02:51.540
tried to break somebody down and figure out why they do the shit that they do.

1049
01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:56.370
Why am I yelling at all of you guys?
Like you disagreed with me.

1050
01:02:56.371 --> 01:03:00.210
Obviously you don't give a shit if I curse.
If you listen to this thing,
you know,

1051
01:03:00.211 --> 01:03:00.811
and I did,
right?

1052
01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:03.300
I should've been playing Catholic church music right underneath that.

1053
01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:04.650
That's what I was doing right there.

1054
01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.670
I was guilting you guys about something you didn't even fucking do.

1055
01:03:08.671 --> 01:03:12.240
What an asshole.
I apologize.
So anyways,
that's as typical.

1056
01:03:12.241 --> 01:03:15.570
Mia had great news and then I have to go a negative way with it.
Um,
yeah,

1057
01:03:15.571 --> 01:03:19.530
so we're,
I'm going to be taping on,
um,
Monday,
May 16th,

1058
01:03:19.531 --> 01:03:23.130
and then I believe it airs that Friday,
which is May 20th.

1059
01:03:23.131 --> 01:03:28.131
So set your dvrs and all that type of stuff and I'm going to go out there and

1060
01:03:28.201 --> 01:03:30.330
have a great time.
So there is that.

1061
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:35.360
And another big piece of news for the Trifecta here is I finally have a date in

1062
01:03:37.801 --> 01:03:42.690
Las Vegas.
That's right after years of people asking me on the podcast,

1063
01:03:42.691 --> 01:03:46.500
dude,
why don't you come to Vegas?
What's the deal man?

1064
01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:51.270
Um,
Tom Papa,
who is the host of the marriage ref,

1065
01:03:51.271 --> 01:03:55.440
very funny show and NBC,
everybody should watch.
Good friend of mine,
Tom,
Papa,

1066
01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.630
wholesome Tom.
Papa does not curse in his act.
You know,

1067
01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:06.230
granted he's murdered half his fucking neighbors,
but knockin um,
he,

1068
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:11.250
he hosts a show at the Orleans casino in Las Vegas.

1069
01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:15.660
Okay.
So just go to a,
I have all the information up on my website,

1070
01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:18.180
[inaudible] dot com um,

1071
01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:21.900
but it's not going to have my name on it because it's Tom Show I'm coming on and

1072
01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:25.760
I'm basically doing the Tom Papa comedy show.
So if you see Tom Papa,
uh,

1073
01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:30.540
why don't I give you the fucking dates and stop running my God damn mouse.
Uh,

1074
01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:35.400
I'm very excited about this date because a huge fan of,
uh,
Tom Papa,

1075
01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:39.960
a good friend of mine and I don't get to work with a lot of my friends anymore

1076
01:04:39.961 --> 01:04:41.070
because they're all headlining.

1077
01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:45.300
So there's a rare time that I get to work with another comedian that I respect

1078
01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:50.130
and am friends with a,
okay.
So it's on June 25th and 26th.

1079
01:04:50.131 --> 01:04:54.150
It's a Friday night.
And one of the cool things about the Orleans a casino,

1080
01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:58.770
it's the last place where George Carlin did stand up say that a lot of people

1081
01:04:58.771 --> 01:05:03.540
didn't know that,
did they?
You didn't,
did Ya?
So,
uh,

1082
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.630
there's that and that,
that ends that.

1083
01:05:05.631 --> 01:05:07.080
Now what the fuck that I want to talk about?

1084
01:05:07.081 --> 01:05:11.220
It just had a great segway there and I couldn't remember what the Hell I was

1085
01:05:11.221 --> 01:05:13.920
going to talk about.
Jesus Christ.

1086
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:18.260
This is always happens whenever I rerecord these things.
I have these moments.

1087
01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:23.180
I have these little lulls and I've learned to not panic during them.

1088
01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:27.290
Let's talk about a show that I saw in ESPN called 30 for 30.

1089
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:30.140
It's this great new segment.
If you're a sports fan,

1090
01:05:30.141 --> 01:05:35.050
set your DVR and check this shit out.
Um,
they're doing stories on a,

1091
01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:39.800
who killed the USFL,
uh,
the United States football league,
which I didn't,

1092
01:05:39.801 --> 01:05:44.150
I didn't know somebody killed it.
I just thought it didn't work out,
you know?

1093
01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.073
Um,

1094
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:47.270
<v 0>okay.</v>

1095
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:50.330
<v 5>I actually,
a lot of people don't know this actually went to a USFL game.</v>

1096
01:05:50.331 --> 01:05:51.890
I saw the Boston breakers first,

1097
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:56.420
the Washington federals at Nickerson feel in a,

1098
01:05:56.421 --> 01:05:59.060
in Boston,
Massachusetts,
in the Boston breakers one.

1099
01:05:59.061 --> 01:06:02.690
And it was almost a capacity crowd,
just out of curiosity.

1100
01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:07.040
And a,
I still remember a lot of teams,
Philadelphia Stars,

1101
01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:11.090
the New Jersey generals owned by Donald Trump had Herschel walker and Doug

1102
01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:15.930
Flutie.
Remember that shit?
Michigan Panthers won it the first year.

1103
01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:17.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1104
01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.900
<v 5>Bobby a bear is that whole was the quarterback.</v>

1105
01:06:19.901 --> 01:06:21.700
We then went and played with the saints.
Believe it or not,

1106
01:06:21.701 --> 01:06:23.200
I'm not looking at this shit up on the Internet.

1107
01:06:23.201 --> 01:06:25.870
I actually remember this stuff and my favorite fucking helmet.

1108
01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:29.800
I thought the Michigan Panthers had a cool helmet,
but I liked,
uh,
Oakland.

1109
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:33.730
They had like that debt fist holding the lightening bolt on that yellow helmet.

1110
01:06:33.731 --> 01:06:37.210
It was the shit and I thought it was very fitting because the Raiders have the

1111
01:06:37.211 --> 01:06:40.660
best uniforms and all football and everyone's tried to rip them off.

1112
01:06:40.661 --> 01:06:44.560
One of your team becomes too pussy.
Like they always go,
well,
let's fucking steal.

1113
01:06:44.561 --> 01:06:47.230
The Raiders will start wearing black because that's a bad ass color.

1114
01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.910
Remember Jerry Glanville?
Huh?
Speaking of marshmallows.
That dough boy,

1115
01:06:51.911 --> 01:06:54.340
remember that when nobody respected the Houston Oilers,

1116
01:06:54.341 --> 01:06:57.850
all of a sudden he gets a black satin fucking Houston Oilers jacket.

1117
01:06:59.030 --> 01:06:59.560
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1118
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.150
<v 5>I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
So anyway,</v>

1119
01:07:01.151 --> 01:07:04.510
so I watched one episode of it,
I can't rock it,
recommend it high enough.

1120
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:09.820
I watched one on the University of Miami called the you and it was talking about

1121
01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:13.900
the Hay Day of the University of Miami.
Um,

1122
01:07:13.901 --> 01:07:15.250
it was fucking awesome man.

1123
01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.910
It was just an awesome thing on so many different levels,

1124
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:24.040
just showing how bad ass that teamwork was,
how crazy their team was.

1125
01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:28.750
And then also just watching all those old guys now exaggerating all their

1126
01:07:28.751 --> 01:07:32.290
fucking stories was hilarious.
And that's the great thing about being an old guy.

1127
01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:36.040
If you did something at eight when you retell the story,

1128
01:07:36.041 --> 01:07:40.630
you did it at 15 and they were doing it to such a ridiculous level that I almost

1129
01:07:40.631 --> 01:07:45.631
forgot that I was alive when that shit was going down because it sounded like a

1130
01:07:45.701 --> 01:07:48.010
brand new story to me.
I mean,

1131
01:07:48.011 --> 01:07:53.011
granted they were not liked throughout college football and college sports in

1132
01:07:54.641 --> 01:07:57.370
general.
Without a doubt.
They were considered crass.

1133
01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:02.260
No class thugs.
All the absol fucking lutely.

1134
01:08:02.261 --> 01:08:05.650
But to tell the way they tell this story.
It's,
it's just like,

1135
01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.770
and the president was like,
fuck Russia,

1136
01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:12.220
what's going on at the University of Miami?
I mean,
it was at the end of the day,

1137
01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:15.710
it's a fucking football team.
It's hilarious.
This one guy goes,

1138
01:08:15.711 --> 01:08:20.300
we will like Ali talking trash.
Oh yeah,
you're just like,
golly.

1139
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:21.673
You know,

1140
01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:26.510
he basically brought talking shit to a whole nother art form.

1141
01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.980
He basically was the first guy to do it.
Uh,
not even on a national,

1142
01:08:30.981 --> 01:08:35.120
he did it on a global level and he was also stripped of his title because he

1143
01:08:35.121 --> 01:08:38.870
wouldn't go to war because of religious reasons.
And he stuck by it.

1144
01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:44.330
And you guys grabbed your Dick's after catching touchdown passes.
Oh yeah.

1145
01:08:44.331 --> 01:08:48.620
That's the same thing.
You again,
you would just like it.
You know what this like,

1146
01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:52.220
it always goes back to that same quote when I see that that Bill Russell Clip,

1147
01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:56.720
Bill Russell was talking about his philosophies on rebounding is I knew what the

1148
01:08:56.721 --> 01:09:01.100
guy,
I broke the guy down at Bubba Bubba and then he's just like,

1149
01:09:01.101 --> 01:09:04.520
so a lot of times I got the rebound before the guy ever even took the shot.

1150
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:07.540
You know,
rarely bill rarely you could.

1151
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.540
It wasn't it really that you were six foot 10 and everybody else was a five foot

1152
01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:16.250
eight inch fucking white guy at that point.
Other than Wilt Chamberlain who was,

1153
01:09:16.251 --> 01:09:19.760
you know,
didn't everybody looked like Bob Cousy,
you know,

1154
01:09:19.761 --> 01:09:24.050
but he's an old man now.
So he get,
he gets to fuck and he gets to,
to exaggerate.

1155
01:09:25.150 --> 01:09:30.110
I look at Pau Gasol when they won game one,
uh,
the other night,

1156
01:09:30.111 --> 01:09:31.670
I don't know when they,
when they closed it out,
sorry,

1157
01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:35.720
when they closed it out against Oklahoma,
when,
oh,
when Colby missed that,
uh,

1158
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:38.030
he misses that shot and then pow,
you know,

1159
01:09:38.031 --> 01:09:42.740
caught the rebound and all the one motion.
Put it in.
I can't wait.
I am an,
I mean,

1160
01:09:42.741 --> 01:09:43.640
it's like he's going to tell it to me.

1161
01:09:43.641 --> 01:09:48.140
I would love to hear him tell it later on in life,
how he's going to be like,

1162
01:09:48.141 --> 01:09:51.560
you know,
I mean,
did you see the look on his face?
He couldn't even believe it.

1163
01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.590
He was like,
oh my God.
Colbys filing,

1164
01:09:54.591 --> 01:09:57.890
not going to yell at me on the jet ride home.
I did something good.

1165
01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:01.190
I did something good.
He didn't even know what to do.
He was like,

1166
01:10:01.191 --> 01:10:05.060
when Phil Mickelson finally won the masters and he jumped up in the air and then

1167
01:10:05.061 --> 01:10:08.420
landed on the ground and cause he felt weird.
Like he didn't,

1168
01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:10.670
he didn't know what to do.
He didn't know what to do.

1169
01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.210
But later on in life when that fucking old fish heads,

1170
01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.470
maybe when his head finally fucking fills out and it's round like a head

1171
01:10:18.471 --> 01:10:22.250
supposed to be,
rather than looking like the Sunday paper turns sideways.

1172
01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:27.470
Um,
God help me if that guy ever sees me,

1173
01:10:27.471 --> 01:10:31.730
I really forget that just because NBA players can throw him around that I'm only

1174
01:10:31.731 --> 01:10:33.770
five foot 10 inches and he can fucking throw me,

1175
01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:38.480
threw an apple bee's wall upside down.
Um,
anyways.

1176
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:41.540
Yeah.
When he goes to tell that story,
it's going to be fucking hilarious.

1177
01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:46.010
He was just,
it was a moment in the game and I knew something had to happen,

1178
01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:49.070
you know,
and when he let that ball go,

1179
01:10:49.071 --> 01:10:51.470
I knew it wasn't going to go in and something told me,

1180
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:54.500
I don't know where that ball's going to come off the rim,

1181
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:58.670
but I'm going to be there.
You know,
he's going to tell it like that.

1182
01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:00.470
That's what if,
if you're like me,

1183
01:11:00.471 --> 01:11:04.670
if you're in your early forties and you were around when the University of
Miami,

1184
01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.660
uh,
was winning all those titles,
do it the way that they taught,

1185
01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:12.010
you would've thought the entire country was,

1186
01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:14.010
was just quaking in the corner

1187
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.000
<v 7>because of a fucking football.
It was a football team.
It was hilarious.</v>

1188
01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:22.140
You know,
especially being a guy from Boston,
which is not a college sports town,

1189
01:11:22.141 --> 01:11:24.450
we're professional sports town.
All right,

1190
01:11:24.451 --> 01:11:28.900
so all we know about the University of Miami is that the fucking BC Eagles beat

1191
01:11:28.901 --> 01:11:30.420
you on the last play of the game.

1192
01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:35.460
That your bad ass team fucking 65 yard,
goddamn prayer.

1193
01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:39.390
It's Tom Jackson says knock it down and you didn't

1194
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:44.220
you let Gerard fail and sneak in behind you.
How does that happen?

1195
01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.710
How does a fucking little white dude get behind all those black guys on defense?

1196
01:11:49.711 --> 01:11:53.700
It's,
it's physically impossible.
White guys can't do shit like that.

1197
01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:57.190
<v 5>Um,
so when he was,
but definitely watch it because,
uh,</v>

1198
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:59.610
the guy who keeps raining it in is Michael Ervin.

1199
01:11:59.611 --> 01:12:03.450
Cause Michael Irvin has just really fucking honest because at one point they

1200
01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:06.300
were saying,
you know,
the media was biased.
They will racist,
you know,

1201
01:12:06.301 --> 01:12:10.470
which obviously,
you know,
there's tremendous amount of truth to that.

1202
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.860
They were saying that while they were cutting to stories of these guys bringing

1203
01:12:13.861 --> 01:12:16.320
guns to clubs,
you know,

1204
01:12:16.321 --> 01:12:19.080
and then they finally cut to Michael Irvin and Michael Irvin was hilarious.

1205
01:12:19.081 --> 01:12:22.470
He was just like,
you know,
a lot of guys say that the media was biased,

1206
01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:26.550
but now that truth is we,
we,
we were a bunch of bad kids.
We were bad kids

1207
01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:31.740
say,
you know,
you can't fucking argue with the honesty.
All right,

1208
01:12:31.741 --> 01:12:33.780
let's get into the topics here.
I know I said it all right.

1209
01:12:33.781 --> 01:12:36.960
Youtube videos for this week.
If you sit in [inaudible] right,

1210
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:41.400
your boss has been a client today and you feel like fucking off,
you know,

1211
01:12:41.401 --> 01:12:45.690
sticking it to the man.
Here's a couple for you to watch.
A two quick ones.

1212
01:12:45.691 --> 01:12:48.120
Fuck you.
Baltimore.
That's a great one.

1213
01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:52.230
A parody of a car commercial and uh,
there's another one.

1214
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:56.130
If you're a sports fan,
do you know like the new thing when you go to a game,

1215
01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.890
like the insane like flat screen TV,

1216
01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:03.060
like they make some sort of intro for your team to get the crowds psyched up.

1217
01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:07.590
Like,
uh,
like picked like the,
like maybe like the Nashville predators,

1218
01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:10.890
how they have like that saber tooth tiger.
Maybe it'll just have like a,
you know,

1219
01:13:10.891 --> 01:13:15.300
computerize saber tooth tiger doing some shit with like a hockey stick or

1220
01:13:15.301 --> 01:13:19.950
whatever.
I got the best one ever.
That is so fucking politically incorrect.

1221
01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:24.330
You guys ever wondered what a computerized polar bear would look like if it

1222
01:13:24.331 --> 01:13:28.560
decided to blow up the world?
And actually it actually blows up the world.

1223
01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:34.140
It,
the planet earth gets blown up by this psycho fucking polar bear.

1224
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.120
It's the,
uh,

1225
01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:41.730
it's the Nanook hockey opening 2010.
That's what you want to search.

1226
01:13:41.731 --> 01:13:45.000
And an [inaudible] is Nan.
Oh,
okay.

1227
01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:49.860
Hockey opening 2010.
It starts with a boat,

1228
01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:55.440
uh,
an icebreaking boat,
you know,
and obviously it's an Alaskan team,

1229
01:13:55.441 --> 01:13:59.120
I'm guessing with Nanook unless it's,
I dunno,
the Yukon territories,

1230
01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:03.750
I have no idea.
And there's a polar bear frozen in the ice and it,
it,

1231
01:14:03.751 --> 01:14:08.220
because they break up the ice,
the polar bear gets mad,
comes up through the ice.

1232
01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.860
It's 10 times bigger than the fucking boat.

1233
01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.220
I'll just tell you the beginning and then some sort of supernatural shit happens

1234
01:14:15.221 --> 01:14:19.120
where it's claps his hands together.
Like Michael Clarke,

1235
01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:22.360
Duncan Duncan in that movie about death row in the mouse,
right?

1236
01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.490
And all of a sudden it has like a,

1237
01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.490
a hockey stick that's glowing like a light saber.

1238
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:32.140
The thing lets out a growl and then slams it down on the ice.

1239
01:14:32.141 --> 01:14:36.130
Breaking ship breaks it in half and the fucking thing sinks.

1240
01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:40.300
And the first thing I'm thinking was,
well what about the people on the boat,

1241
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:42.770
<v 1>right?
Isn't that what they'd say at the arena?</v>

1242
01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:45.740
I think it's good that there's a teddy bear,

1243
01:14:45.741 --> 01:14:48.020
but does it have to kill people on a boat?

1244
01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:52.470
This thing that's just where this starts.
I don't know what happens after that.

1245
01:14:52.471 --> 01:14:55.670
And next thing you know what's in an f 16 and the fucking planet earth blows up.

1246
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:59.780
This is for the beginning of a hockey game.
It's the greatest one I've ever seen.

1247
01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:02.410
If you're into that type of shit.
So check it out now.

1248
01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:06.170
Nook hopped hockey opening 2010.
All right,

1249
01:15:06.171 --> 01:15:09.170
let's get on with the questions for this week.
Uh,
ask bill.

1250
01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.530
<v 5>Uh,
this is a very interesting question and I think I might need a little bit of</v>

1251
01:15:13.531 --> 01:15:17.540
help on this one.
Cause this goes outside the realms of,
uh,

1252
01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:21.870
what I've been doing with my life.
Um,
Bill,
I've been meaning to ask you,

1253
01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:26.550
I'm afraid that when I'm an adult and have responsibility that I will not be

1254
01:15:26.551 --> 01:15:29.220
able to smoke weed.
I'm not a pothead.

1255
01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:33.840
I smoke about a few times a week,
more in the summer.
Um,

1256
01:15:33.841 --> 01:15:36.210
I get decent grades at a decent school.

1257
01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.240
I feel like professional and family life won't allow me to blaze anymore.

1258
01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:45.180
And this is what I love about this is right up until then,

1259
01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.650
right up until he says the word blaze.
I'm really,
I'm really believe in this guy.

1260
01:15:49.651 --> 01:15:52.740
You know,
whatever.
You know,
I smoked a couple joints a week.
You know,

1261
01:15:52.741 --> 01:15:56.490
I do well in school,
had a great school.
You know,
I'm very responsible.

1262
01:15:56.491 --> 01:15:58.450
I don't drink and drive a couple times a week.
I have,

1263
01:15:58.530 --> 01:16:02.040
if he said I have a couple of Tokes,
no big deal,
I get it.
You know,

1264
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:05.130
you wanna Watch laverne and Shirley and he'd fiddle faddle I don't have a

1265
01:16:05.131 --> 01:16:08.310
problem with that,
you know,
but once you say blaze,

1266
01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.790
I'm just a that's at least isn't that like blunt level?

1267
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:16.080
Cause I always just,
I mean I'm not a pothead.
I don't even smoke this shit.

1268
01:16:16.081 --> 01:16:20.610
So I just picture blaze meaning that there has to be some sort of significant

1269
01:16:21.330 --> 01:16:24.990
source of fire to get that joint going.
Like it's that big.

1270
01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:28.140
Maybe I'm wrong because I'm a booze hound.
So anyways,
he goes,

1271
01:16:28.141 --> 01:16:30.950
do you think this is true?
Do you think anyone,
uh,

1272
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:34.350
do you know anyone your age or older who do smoke

1273
01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.580
decent grades at a different,
at a decent school?
Okay.

1274
01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:43.380
Do you know anyone your age or older who do smoke?
All right.

1275
01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:48.370
Um,
the,
this is my feelings on,
on weed.
I don't think it's that bad.
Um,

1276
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:51.090
especially nowadays we can get like a vaporizer.

1277
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.080
Check that out or go to a,
the,
mm,
what is it?

1278
01:16:55.081 --> 01:16:59.940
www.themmppodcast.com.
And I'll have a picture for you.
I guarantee it.

1279
01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:05.580
Um,
a vaporizer is basically you have,

1280
01:17:05.610 --> 01:17:06.660
you put the weed in there,

1281
01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:10.220
you light it on fire or whatever the fuck you do and basically filters out

1282
01:17:10.221 --> 01:17:11.930
everything except what gets you high.

1283
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:17.090
Now that has to be way more healthier than sitting down and finish in a six
pack,

1284
01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:17.924
isn't it?

1285
01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:21.530
I guess it depends if you get the munchies and then he'd go out and eat cake and

1286
01:17:21.531 --> 01:17:25.520
ice cream.
I have no fucking idea.
But anyways,
I think,
yeah,
there's,
you know,

1287
01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:28.970
I know people who are married and have kids and uh,
you know,

1288
01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:32.780
every once in a while they go out,
send their kids to bed,

1289
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:35.510
have a couple of puffs,
but you know,
you know,
kids,

1290
01:17:35.511 --> 01:17:36.650
they'll figure out what you're doing.

1291
01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:41.090
That's the only thing you have to really hide it because,
uh,

1292
01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:46.160
I don't think I would smoke weed in front of my kids ever because even though I

1293
01:17:46.431 --> 01:17:50.570
don't think it's any worse than having a beer,
it isn't,
it really isn't.

1294
01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:51.733
Um,

1295
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:56.770
the thing is is you are knowingly breaking the law and it is considered like,

1296
01:17:57.410 --> 01:18:00.330
you know,
you're on drugs for for some reason,
alcoholism,

1297
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:01.640
which is complete bullshit,

1298
01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:05.310
but it is so just do that in front of a kid and you know,

1299
01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:09.710
kids they always want to outdo you.
They see you drinking a six pack,

1300
01:18:09.711 --> 01:18:12.830
they're going to try to go for you know,
at least eight to 12.
I don't know.

1301
01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:16.910
So I would just be worried this is what,
no psychological,
you know,

1302
01:18:16.911 --> 01:18:19.550
psychology background or any of that shit.
I would just think if you,

1303
01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:24.820
if your kids saw you smoking weed that he would be smoking weed by at least

1304
01:18:26.031 --> 01:18:30.530
seventh or eighth grade,
maybe 10th if he was a fucking nerd at that point.

1305
01:18:31.190 --> 01:18:35.240
But um,
and then I don't think it would be that big a leap to coke.

1306
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:36.703
I really wouldn't.

1307
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:41.330
Now I know potheads this is like a fucking big thing with you guys.

1308
01:18:41.331 --> 01:18:42.410
Well that's just bullshit.

1309
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:45.650
Who switched pull should do to approve you to fucking gateway drug?
Really?

1310
01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:48.710
I think it is because everybody I know went that route.

1311
01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.990
You started off with booze.
Then you went to weed,

1312
01:18:50.991 --> 01:18:54.470
then you went to coke and whatever else.
So you are weed,

1313
01:18:54.471 --> 01:18:59.120
you went to coke or they had crank.
Anybody remember that shit?

1314
01:18:59.730 --> 01:19:03.470
I'm a whatever else you did took pills,
whatever you did,

1315
01:19:03.471 --> 01:19:08.420
you're just like whatever acid by you always went.
We'd first,
I mean,

1316
01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.500
as far as I know,
that's how,
uh,

1317
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:14.900
people who I didn't hang out with in high school did it look at me still being a

1318
01:19:14.901 --> 01:19:19.700
fucking friend,
not throwing anybody under the bus.
Um,

1319
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:22.400
oh to it.
Speaking of that,
I'm back back in my hometown this weekend.

1320
01:19:22.401 --> 01:19:26.090
Really excited Thursday and Friday.
I'm at the Wilbur Theater.

1321
01:19:26.091 --> 01:19:30.590
Friday night is already sold out a Thursday night.
Tickets are still available.

1322
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:34.550
Go to [inaudible] dot com click on the Wilbur theater Friday,
Thursday,

1323
01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:38.000
May 6th for tickets.
I'm really whoring myself out this week.

1324
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.570
And um,
yeah,

1325
01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:46.130
I'll be in Atlantic city on Saturday night doing the Trump Taj Mahal.
Um,

1326
01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:48.860
anyways,
so yeah,
that's my answer I think.
Yeah,

1327
01:19:48.861 --> 01:19:50.660
you can easily continue to smoke weed.

1328
01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:53.600
Just be open and honest with the person that you're with and just say,
look,

1329
01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:57.650
you know,
I don't smoke it every fucking day.
Uh,

1330
01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:01.190
I just would rather do that than have like 12 beers and become a fat fuck,

1331
01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:04.910
you know?
So that's what I'm going to do.

1332
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:10.380
I'm going to buy a,
I don't even know what the,
what the,
what the quantity is.

1333
01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:13.150
If you smoke twice a week,
what would you need?
How much would you need?

1334
01:20:13.151 --> 01:20:15.850
Would you need a couple of buds?
But that get you through it?
I don't know.

1335
01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:19.450
Just a couple of bucks a month.
That's all.
That's all I'm going to do,
sweetheart.

1336
01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:22.240
All right.
Don't look at me that way.
Okay.
I'm a smart guy.

1337
01:20:22.570 --> 01:20:26.620
I went to a smart school and uh,
you know,

1338
01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:32.470
do you know anyone your age or older who do smoke?
Um,
all right.
That's it.

1339
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:36.520
That is it for that.
Let's move on to the next thing.
Uh,
what are we going here?

1340
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:40.840
He builds,
spent about two weeks since the April 19th podcast.

1341
01:20:40.841 --> 01:20:43.750
When you said you wanted the listeners to ask you the following question,

1342
01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:46.600
if I happen to be a comedian,
what are the general rules?

1343
01:20:46.601 --> 01:20:50.560
If I am opening for the headlining act?
Ah,
right.

1344
01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:55.370
<v 7>Uh,
yeah.
I did not have a good time that weekend.
So yeah,</v>

1345
01:20:55.371 --> 01:20:56.600
this is what you would want to do.

1346
01:20:56.601 --> 01:21:01.601
You just go up and do your act within the allotted time you're given.

1347
01:21:01.881 --> 01:21:03.950
If somebody tells you to do 25 minutes,

1348
01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:08.900
do 25 minutes and do your act.
If you want to blow me off the stage,

1349
01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:13.340
go up there and absolutely fucking destroy with your jokes.

1350
01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:16.190
If you want to try and make it hard on me as a comedian.

1351
01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:19.130
If you want the club owner to be looking at you going like,

1352
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:23.510
this guy's going to headline someday.
That's the way you do it.
You go up there,

1353
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:28.610
you do your act and you fucking destroy and you make it hard for me.
All right?

1354
01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:34.160
That's the ideal.
Okay?
Now there's other,
there's,

1355
01:21:34.161 --> 01:21:37.940
there's some headliners out there that tell like,
you're basically another thing,

1356
01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:38.381
uh,
as,

1357
01:21:38.381 --> 01:21:42.830
as courtesy to the closing act is you're not overly dirty and you don't play

1358
01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:47.000
with the crowd.
That's another,
that's another thing.
You know,

1359
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:49.970
there's other people they say don't go in the green room.
You know,

1360
01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:51.860
some people who was like fucking divas,

1361
01:21:51.861 --> 01:21:54.620
they don't want anybody in there or they're tired.

1362
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:57.790
And then there's other headliners who won't even let you sell shit.
You know,

1363
01:21:57.791 --> 01:22:00.610
sometimes feature acts come up to me and like,
I have yo yo this,

1364
01:22:00.611 --> 01:22:04.210
can I sell my yoyos some headliners don't yell at you do that.

1365
01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:05.860
So this is my shit.

1366
01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:10.830
I don't give a fuck how dirty you are cause I'm filthy.
I don't give a shit.

1367
01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:14.220
You can talk to the crowd.
I don't give a fuck.
You can come in the green room,

1368
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:17.640
you can sell you shit afterwards.
I don't give a shit.
Just do your time.

1369
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:20.250
Just stick to your fucking time.
All right.

1370
01:22:20.251 --> 01:22:23.640
Don't go up there and do when you're supposed to do

1371
01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:28.400
<v 5>20 to 40 minutes and say,
Oh hey,
sorry about that.</v>

1372
01:22:28.401 --> 01:22:31.670
And then I say,
okay,
that's cool.
Whatever.
We all do that every once in a while.

1373
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:33.440
And then the next night on the late show,

1374
01:22:33.530 --> 01:22:38.530
you do 37 minutes and you're talking to the crowd and you're saying means shit

1375
01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:43.160
to him and you're not really killing,
but you're not bombing.
You just,

1376
01:22:43.161 --> 01:22:43.960
you know it.

1377
01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:47.840
This is a technique that some features do to try and make the headline I look

1378
01:22:47.841 --> 01:22:52.310
bad is they go over the time and they fuck with the crowd and they're overly

1379
01:22:52.311 --> 01:22:54.620
dirty or they'll say mean stuff.

1380
01:22:54.621 --> 01:22:57.470
And it's basically they're blowing out the parameters of the show.

1381
01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:01.900
And then they're also,
they're making the crowd tired,
you know,

1382
01:23:01.930 --> 01:23:05.770
and uh,
so then when you go up as,
as,
as the act,

1383
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:10.390
<v 7>rather than having a crowd that's ready to go,
they're already worn out.</v>

1384
01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:13.600
You're coming up there and the energy is like,

1385
01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:15.940
you've already been up there for a fucking half an hour.

1386
01:23:16.150 --> 01:23:19.600
That's like how tired they are.
And,
uh,

1387
01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:22.330
that was basically the scenario that I was in.

1388
01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:26.740
There's this guy did 40 and then he did 37.
And then when I said,
dude,

1389
01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:30.640
what the fuck?
That's such,
that's two out of three shows.

1390
01:23:30.641 --> 01:23:35.170
He then hit me with the brilliant,
oh,
how much time do you want me to do?

1391
01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:38.920
You know,
which is like an open micro question.

1392
01:23:38.921 --> 01:23:41.080
This guy was actually older than I was.
Okay.

1393
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:45.310
You know the club told you how much time to do so either you're deliberately

1394
01:23:45.311 --> 01:23:50.090
trying to make it difficult on me by boring the shit out of this crowd for an

1395
01:23:50.091 --> 01:23:53.020
extra 20 fucking this guy supposed to 20 minutes.
He did 40.

1396
01:23:53.021 --> 01:23:57.640
He's doing twice as time.
Um,
yeah,
it was one of those deals.

1397
01:23:57.730 --> 01:24:00.400
Either that or a,
I don't know what your deal is.
I don't know.

1398
01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:04.490
I was not able to figure this guy out.
Um,

1399
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:07.540
and it was actually a sad thing because he was a smart guy and he had good jokes

1400
01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:10.630
and he should have just done m and a even like Saturday night.

1401
01:24:10.631 --> 01:24:13.570
Then he goes up there and then he did,
he did like 14 minutes

1402
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:16.770
and I was just beside myself.

1403
01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:21.070
Now I've got to cover an hour and 15 rather than just doing his 20 minutes and I

1404
01:24:21.071 --> 01:24:24.370
go up there,
you know,
and I do my hour,

1405
01:24:24.371 --> 01:24:26.670
hour and 10 now he is up there for,
you know,

1406
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:32.590
I like 12 minutes or some shits and now I've got to cover the rest of it and

1407
01:24:32.771 --> 01:24:36.430
it's,
it's,
I just wanted it to be like,
dude,
what is your problem?

1408
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:42.430
You know what?
You don't have a watch.
You know,

1409
01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:45.100
you've been doing this shit long enough.
I know you headline.
I know,

1410
01:24:45.101 --> 01:24:48.430
you know what it's like when somebody does that amount of time in front of you.

1411
01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:54.700
So I dunno,
I just basically after uh,
after he said,
uh,

1412
01:24:54.701 --> 01:24:57.820
what did he say?
How much time do you want me to do?

1413
01:24:57.821 --> 01:25:01.570
I just basically stopped talking to him for the rest of the weekend because,
uh,

1414
01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.560
it was just like,
I can't explain,

1415
01:25:05.561 --> 01:25:09.790
expand on when like when somebody asks a question in what they're really saying

1416
01:25:09.791 --> 01:25:13.030
is,
I think you're a fucking moron.
That's basically what he was saying.

1417
01:25:13.031 --> 01:25:14.370
I think you're a fucking moron.
Like,

1418
01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:18.940
you're going to be three shows into the weekend and the comedy club never told

1419
01:25:18.941 --> 01:25:23.260
you how much time to do in front of the headlining act.
You know,

1420
01:25:23.290 --> 01:25:27.670
and you never asked in three shows in,
you don't know where the light is.

1421
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:31.480
And you already went over on the first show when you apologize for it and then,

1422
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:36.160
then you fucking do it again.
And it's like,
yeah,

1423
01:25:36.161 --> 01:25:39.370
that's either you're a moron or you just don't give a shit.

1424
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:41.500
And this guy was not dumb.

1425
01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:44.620
So either he didn't give a fuck or he was doing it on purpose,

1426
01:25:44.621 --> 01:25:45.640
which is how I took it.

1427
01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:49.600
I took it like this guy doing this on purpose to make me look like an asshole.

1428
01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:53.800
But fortunately I'm a fucking beast and I had no problem following the guy,

1429
01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:55.510
but it was just bullshit.
I didn't,

1430
01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:59.140
I felt like I was going on up after like a fucking telethon and for all you

1431
01:25:59.141 --> 01:26:00.620
young comics out there,
I know you're not going,

1432
01:26:00.621 --> 01:26:04.070
it's a stupid fucking thing to do because I actually would have said Nice things

1433
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:08.990
<v 5>about the guy cause he had good jokes.
And,
uh,
but I also,
you know,</v>

1434
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:11.360
I'm not going to go bad mouth them and be honest with you.

1435
01:26:11.361 --> 01:26:13.670
I don't even remember his fucking name,
you know,

1436
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:19.340
I don't even remember his fucking name.
So that's it.
So that was my weekend.

1437
01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.600
That's what I was dealing with.

1438
01:26:20.601 --> 01:26:25.160
I was staying there and this guy was going over and he was like,
wow,

1439
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:30.170
you mean you don't like a bucket of shit dumped over your head before you go up?

1440
01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:35.660
Oh,
I didn't know that.
I've only been doing it for 20 fucking years.

1441
01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:38.750
I have no idea.
What are the rules?

1442
01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:43.190
Do you just keep going until you feel like you want to get out?
What,

1443
01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:47.360
how do you feature for somebody?
I have no idea.

1444
01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:52.960
I've just been doing stand up since fucking a Rita Rudner was an open miker I

1445
01:26:54.471 --> 01:26:57.950
don't know anything.
It was,
it was fucking ridiculous and

1446
01:26:59.930 --> 01:27:03.860
whatever,
whatever.
And I just felt like,
yeah,
why don't I tell the whole story?

1447
01:27:03.861 --> 01:27:04.694
I felt like it,

1448
01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:08.540
like somebody at the club should have said something to the fucking guy.

1449
01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:13.670
Um,
they,
after the second time,
you know,
and nobody did.

1450
01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:16.430
And then I'm putting a position like do I go to the club owner?

1451
01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:20.240
Like a like a fucking girl and tell on the guy you don't want your [inaudible].

1452
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:24.200
So I decided to say something to him,
you know,

1453
01:27:24.201 --> 01:27:27.560
and then he hit me with that shit.
How much time do you want me to do?
Gee,

1454
01:27:27.561 --> 01:27:28.220
I don't know.

1455
01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:30.740
You've been in this business 20 years was the last time you heard somebody go

1456
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:32.570
yeah,
do 37 in front of me.

1457
01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:38.030
Do 37 and be sure to piss off as many people in the crowd is as as possible

1458
01:27:38.150 --> 01:27:40.310
before I go up there that that would be awesome.

1459
01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:42.230
And if there's somebody drunk in the crowd,

1460
01:27:42.231 --> 01:27:45.680
by all means just keep going back and forth with them and turn it into an

1461
01:27:45.681 --> 01:27:48.590
absolute shit fest before I go up there.
That would be great.

1462
01:27:48.591 --> 01:27:53.150
And if you could go do twice the amount of time that they told you to do and act

1463
01:27:53.151 --> 01:27:56.750
like you have no fucking idea that would that,
yeah,
that's what I want.

1464
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:57.980
That's what I'm looking for.

1465
01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.770
I'm sure that that's what you're looking for when you go out and headline.

1466
01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.240
All right.
I got a little upset there.
Um,
so that was my experience.

1467
01:28:05.241 --> 01:28:09.050
So there you go.
That's what he's supposed to do.
All right.
You know,

1468
01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.300
just go up there and do your fucking act.
And if you kill him,

1469
01:28:11.301 --> 01:28:14.120
the guy after you cannot follow you,

1470
01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:17.630
he'll have no reason to complain because you didn't fuck with the crowd.

1471
01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:20.090
You weren't dirty.
You just did your shit and he couldn't follow you.

1472
01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:24.350
That's the deal.
All right,
so we're gonna end with this one.
Uh,

1473
01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:28.790
somebody asked me a hypothetical question that I think this is a new topic here.

1474
01:28:28.791 --> 01:28:32.600
Hypothetical's a little hypothetical for you.
Uh,

1475
01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:36.350
if something happened to your dog and she needs an operation that's going to

1476
01:28:36.351 --> 01:28:37.730
cost 50 grand,

1477
01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.170
but there's only a 65% chance that she'll survive the operation.

1478
01:28:42.171 --> 01:28:47.030
Do you pay apps a Fuckin lutely?
Absolutely.
I pay twice that.

1479
01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:53.060
Absolutely.
65%.
Absolutely.
Put my mortgage down on that.

1480
01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:57.680
She's a fucking pit bull.
She's a warrior.
You know,
that's my buddy.

1481
01:28:57.710 --> 01:29:01.470
Absolutely.
Come on.
You know,
you don't,
my dog,

1482
01:29:01.471 --> 01:29:03.570
my dog might do a lot of things,
but you know what,
it wouldn't do.

1483
01:29:03.571 --> 01:29:05.880
It wouldn't go up and do 37 minutes in front of me.

1484
01:29:05.881 --> 01:29:10.881
It wasn't okay because there's a loyalty to a pit bull that that son of a bitch

1485
01:29:11.371 --> 01:29:16.080
didn't have when I was out there.
All right.
Ah,
fuck.

1486
01:29:16.081 --> 01:29:19.020
I ran out of time.
You know what I forgot to do?
I forgot to do the whole,
uh,

1487
01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:22.320
the whole bad covers the worst covers you've ever heard.

1488
01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:24.930
I gotta I gotta I gotta break out that list next week.

1489
01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.610
You guys are sending me some great ones.

1490
01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:30.210
One that I can remember off the top of my head was,
um,

1491
01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:35.170
was when earth wind fire did a,
did a cover of Paul Mccartney,

1492
01:29:35.171 --> 01:29:38.080
I think it was with the Beatles that got to get you into my life.

1493
01:29:38.890 --> 01:29:42.370
And it was a song that when the Beatles did it,
or Paul Mccartney,
I forget,

1494
01:29:42.371 --> 01:29:45.910
it was a great song,
you know,
and when earth,
wind and fire did it,

1495
01:29:45.911 --> 01:29:50.911
they somehow turned it into this smooth jazz sort of,

1496
01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:52.293
uh,

1497
01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:55.630
you hear the song and you start moving your head like those dudes and night at

1498
01:29:55.631 --> 01:29:59.950
the Roxbury.
It's just,
it's one of the worst.
The harmonies,
uh,

1499
01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:03.820
gonna have to get you into my lane,
but I bought up up,

1500
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:07.660
but it's fucking horrible.
And it's no excuse because it's a big,

1501
01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:12.350
it's a fucking like 27 black guys weren't earth,
wind and fire.

1502
01:30:12.351 --> 01:30:16.370
You would think one of them would be like,
hey,
this kind of sucks.
You know,

1503
01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:18.410
how the hell did we pull this off?

1504
01:30:18.411 --> 01:30:20.600
This sounds like somebody white did a cover of this.

1505
01:30:20.601 --> 01:30:24.050
That's how fucking awful it was.
All right.
Anyways,
that was the,
uh,

1506
01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:27.110
that's a podcast for this week.
