1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.630
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.680
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:06.190
It's bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:11.080
September 8th,
2014.
How are Ya?
How's it gone?

5
00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:15.550
Oh,
I bought that bag up.
Boot it up.
Put it up two weeks in a row.

6
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.870
Fuck you.
I'm excited.

7
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.730
I told you last week how excited I was about the NFL football season starting.

8
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.403
You know,

9
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.940
and I'm kind of sucked for me because I missed all of it.

10
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.200
Basically I was flying back from Toronto.
Um,

11
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.320
I went up there for the Toronto International Film Festival of Rational National

12
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.670
Fossil Hall up there in Toronto.
Um,
cause I got a movie a,
I don't have a movie.

13
00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:45.730
I have a partner movie.
Take the ego down a little bit.

14
00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:47.560
Do you really have a movie?
What do you have build?

15
00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:51.430
You have a home movie that you shot about you rubbing your balls in your bed.

16
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.140
All right,
relax.

17
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.200
I have a part in a movie called black and white starring Kevin Costa and Octavia

18
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.040
directed by Mike.
Um,

19
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.800
I really want to see somebody from Boston talking about this movie when it's

20
00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:16.270
coming out.
Somebody at a lower level who hasn't taken a speech class,

21
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.500
career speeches,
what they call it,
you know,
when you get into mainstream media,

22
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.140
good evening,
welcome to the nightly dues.

23
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.320
And you can't tell where the person's from.
No accent.

24
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.760
So basically everybody can understand you slash they're not laughing at the way

25
00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:32.830
you speak.
You know,

26
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.980
I want to see the local person in Boston doing this new movie coming out,

27
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.110
black and whites starring Kevin Costner,

28
00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:44.200
Octavia Spencer directed by Mike binder.

29
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.090
Come on down to MVP sports.
We got all the jerseys,
we got the shacks to steal.

30
00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:56.260
Is the charges in more.
Um,
anyways,

31
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.590
that's actual copy for a long time ago from an MTV,

32
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.670
MTV MVP sports radio spot.
We've got the shacks,

33
00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:06.850
the steel is the charges and more,
more.

34
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.190
Do you really have more?

35
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.840
You don't have less now we got more um,
Jay Mohr.

36
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.740
Anyways.
Um,
yeah,
so I was on the plane.

37
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.790
I missed,
I missed all the games.
I missed all the games.

38
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.360
Uh,

39
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.360
miss my patriots getting their asses and the second half evidently by the Miami

40
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:33.180
Dolphins.
And,
um,

41
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.490
I want to Wa I wish I maybe the NFL network where we show some of it.

42
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:42.270
I want to watch it.
I want to see what happened.
Um,

43
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:44.130
I was actually on the plane coming back,

44
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:48.330
Flying Air Canada and I'm thinking,

45
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.200
all right,
well,
well let me take you through the whole thing.
I flew up,
uh,

46
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.980
was it Friday night?
I mean the lovely Nia,

47
00:02:55.981 --> 00:03:00.520
we flew up there for the film festival and,
um,
I shot this movie last year.

48
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.040
<v 2>Remember last year when I told you I was in New Orleans,</v>

49
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.400
for those of you who are listening last year,
um,

50
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.510
<v 0>yeah,</v>

51
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.410
<v 2>you know,
we shot this movie and I lucked out because it was hot as balls.</v>

52
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.060
Um,
the level of humidity was something I had never experienced other than when I

53
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.080
was in New York City.

54
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.500
And I remember late night standing on a subway platform on the ground.

55
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.730
And basically,
I mean,

56
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:28.360
it was already hot as fuck outside and then underground.

57
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:33.160
You basically with this air that was trapped after the sun had been beating on

58
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:34.480
the asphalt above,

59
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.310
heating up all the air underneath for 24 fucking hours,
whatever the hell it was,

60
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.510
and was just standing there like a fucking Zombie in the late night if he never

61
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:47.800
lived,
you know,
in a city,
the trains don't run like every six,
seven minutes.

62
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.300
If you miss a train,
you're going to be there for an ungodly,
like 20,

63
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:55.780
25 minutes.
And usually what you thinking is this,

64
00:03:55.781 --> 00:04:00.781
please don't let anybody crawl up from the tracks and you know,

65
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:01.714
drag,
you know,

66
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.160
four or five of them grabbed me by the legs and pull me under to their

67
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:08.800
underworld cities and use me as a food source.

68
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.070
That's what you usually worried about or getting stabbed or getting robbed or

69
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:15.610
whatever.
Um,
on that particular night,

70
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.440
none of that entered into my mind.
I was just standing there.
Um,

71
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.480
I remember early on before I got delusional Iros wondering why,
what if I,

72
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.690
I should probably not stand too close to the track because if I get so

73
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:32.650
dehydrated and pass out and fall onto the tracks,
I'm going to get run over.

74
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.200
Um,
it was just brutal.
So what,
anyways,
I had not experienced seat like that.

75
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.720
Is that any ways down in New Orleans since my days living in New York City and,

76
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:49.760
um,
I really lucked out if you go and see the film,

77
00:04:49.761 --> 00:04:54.140
which I hope you do,
it did really well,
uh,
at the festival.

78
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.240
And um,
I remembered,

79
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.660
I just totally lucked out where all of my scenes were indoors.

80
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.410
I only had one scene where I had to get out of a car and just walk up to a

81
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.810
Kevin's character's house.
But other than that,

82
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.440
I was inside the whole fucking time.

83
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.510
Even when I was outside,
I was inside,

84
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:19.870
I was to be sitting in a car and we'd be cranking the AC and then shut it off

85
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:24.340
right before they did the take a completely fucking lucked out.
But anyways,
so,

86
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.080
um,
went up there for the premiere and,

87
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:32.560
uh,
it was a,
uh,
it was an awesome time.

88
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:36.550
Got to see everybody in the cast.
It's an unreal cast.
Anthony Mackey's in it.

89
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.130
Um,
I play a lot.
I play a lawyer and,
uh,

90
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.020
I'm representing Kevin Costner and Anthony Mackie represents Octavia Spencer's

91
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:50.920
family and,
uh,
you know,
it was pretty insane.

92
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.690
It was definitely one of those,
how the hell did I end up here moments,

93
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:59.290
what am I doing here and how soon am I going to get fired?
You know,

94
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.060
one of those deals.
And fortunately,
none of that happened and I had a great time,

95
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.170
but,
uh,
so it was,

96
00:06:05.171 --> 00:06:07.360
it's been a year since I've seen everybody in the cast or whatever,

97
00:06:07.361 --> 00:06:10.210
so we all got to hang out.
Um,

98
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.620
got to watch the film front of a crowd,
which is fucking nerve racking.

99
00:06:14.621 --> 00:06:18.010
But fortunately they got on early,
they got on the ride early and they just,

100
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.873
you know,

101
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.920
<v 3>yeah.</v>

102
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.180
<v 1>And,
uh,
went great.</v>

103
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.130
It went great and I had a great time and went to the after parties,

104
00:06:26.131 --> 00:06:30.560
did all of that type of stuff.
Blahblahblahblahblah blue and all that.
You know,

105
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.780
<v 2>funny when we went to the premiere it was hilarious.
Was there,</v>

106
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.430
they bring you over there,
right?
And it's this huge film festival.

107
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:41.270
I come from the stand up world so I have no idea.
So um,

108
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.600
there's all these big time movie actors there.
So anyways,

109
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.980
when they bring you over to do the red carpet,
um,

110
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.300
they drive you over and like you know,

111
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.980
whatever the fuck we were at all we went to a dinner now there was an early,

112

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.710
<v 1>Shit.
And you just put on your happy face.
Oh my God.

117
00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:11.980
Everybody was so amazing.
You just do that shit.
You go into that mode,
right?

118
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.440
So then they bring us over,
right?

119
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.390
Did you pulling up to the red carpet and there's fucking probably eight,

120
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:22.510
nine people deep

121
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.520
<v 2>wrapped around this semicircle where all the cars are pulling up.</v>

122
00:07:26.521 --> 00:07:29.370
Cause they want to see all these big time fucking Hollywood stars.

123
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.590
So Lo and behold,
one of the first ones to come down the fucking path was me.

124
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.113
Right.

125
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.580
<v 1>I wish I don't,
I,
I've never done one of those.</v>

126
00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:47.140
I wish I fucking videoed the looks on people's faces.

127
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.100
The fucking manic look of excitement past we'll cut combined with where is the

128
00:07:55.211 --> 00:07:57.330
famous guy.
So they are looking,

129
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.110
looking into the truck and they're like,
Eh,
Eh,

130
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.870
and they're looking at me and then quickly look,
cause I just,
you know,

131
00:08:04.871 --> 00:08:07.570
I'm standing there,
I'm going a suit.
I look like a fucking agent.

132
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.970
They don't know the fuck I am.
So I,

133
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:15.060
the door opens and the crowds like as I go to out and immediately it just

134
00:08:16.631 --> 00:08:18.370
fucking,
you know,

135
00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:21.700
like the beginning of a football game where everybody's going crazy and you get

136
00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:23.810
ready for the,
for them to kick off and the,

137
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:27.610
and the kicker starts running at the ball and then the wind blows it off the tee

138
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.710
and then the crowd has to die down before they start going,
ugh.

139
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.040
That's basically what it was.

140
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:38.310
Me Stepping out of that truck was like the football falling off the tape and uh,

141
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.530
I,
yeah,
I was,
they weren't,
they were looking at Neil like she was in the movie.

142
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.280
They thought she was in the movie.
They were like,
who is that?
Was is that,

143
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.390
you know,
fucking

144
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.483
<v 3>okay</v>

145
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.970
<v 1>is that will Smith.</v>

146
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.970
<v 2>Um,
anyways,
so then whatever went out and did the red carpet,</v>

147
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:06.060
red carpet was the same experience,
which was fucking hilarious.

148
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:10.470
Was people talking to me asking me questions as they were looking down the

149
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:14.700
carpet to see,
you know,
where the real person was that was coming.

150
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.350
So I just started making joke.
Everyone I went as whenever they would look,

151
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.410
I'd be like,
yeah,
don't worry.
Kevin's common Kevin's coming.

152
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:25.740
You wrap it up with me,
wrap it up.
And they'd be like,
oh no,
no,
no.
It's like,
yes,

153
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:30.310
yes,
yes.
I get it.
Him,
you're waiting for him.
You know,
are,

154
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.710
you're not going to use this.
So,
um,
I had a great time.

155
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:37.830
It was making me laugh the whole fucking way down cause I just kept addressing

156
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:42.570
that.
And,
um,
it was just,
it was a great time.
And,

157
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:44.670
uh,
you know,

158
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.110
<v 5>okay.</v>

159
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.940
<v 2>I don't know.
The whole thing was,</v>

160
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.990
it was interesting going through there and they just,

161
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:51.700
some of the questions that they would ask who kind of like open ended,

162
00:09:51.701 --> 00:09:53.550
they'd be like,
you know,
you know,

163
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:57.810
this movie deals with race and in the light of the call and Ferguson's little

164
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.470
flu,
it's like this thing was made a year ago.
This was made before then.

165
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:07.120
What do you feel,
uh,
how do you feel that this movie is good to a thick,
the boob?

166
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.360
But what am I a fucking source or,
I don't know.

167
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:13.680
I think people are gonna think what they think.
All right,
Bill.

168
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:14.950
Thank you very much,
Ken.

169
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.550
<v 5>Okay.</v>

170
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.970
<v 2>So anyways,
uh,
I got to do all of that shit and um,</v>

171
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.430
it was definitely a good time.
And,
uh,

172
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.270
we saw the movie movie did great and uh,
the crowd really seemed to like it,
blah,

173
00:10:32.271 --> 00:10:36.200
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And we went to the after party.

174
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.560
Um,
and that was a really interesting thing too,

175
00:10:39.561 --> 00:10:41.750
because I didn't understand what was going on.

176
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:46.580
We went to this party and we're sitting at a table and it was who I thought were

177
00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:48.560
these random people at the table.
I'm like,

178
00:10:48.561 --> 00:10:52.960
who are these fucking people sitting here?
Why am I,
what am I talking?

179
00:10:52.961 --> 00:10:55.010
And it turned out these were the people that put,
you know,

180
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.840
a lot of the money up for the movie.
So basically for you,

181
00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.710
when you guys do your movie,
all right,

182
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.880
and you go to the premiere and you step out and you get to experience what it

183
00:11:03.881 --> 00:11:06.910
feels like to be the human version of a football fallen off a tee.

184
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.460
Um,
afterwards you go,

185
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.690
I guess the next party you go to is people that put up,
you know,

186
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.960
I know Kevin put up a bunch of money for the movie and then there was like a,

187
00:11:19.961 --> 00:11:22.300
I dunno,
these other people that put up money for the movie.

188
00:11:22.301 --> 00:11:26.230
So they then have a dinner and then you go when you interact with them and

189
00:11:26.231 --> 00:11:29.050
basically thank them for putting the money up for the movie.

190
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.400
Old fucking freckles didn't realize that I'm looking at this guy,

191
00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:37.780
is it okay for doing?
Who the fuck is this guy?
Um,
and then once I realized,

192
00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:40.960
I was like,
Oh wow,
okay,
okay.
Oh,
we're still playing the game.

193
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.220
I thought the game was over,
you know,
it was halftime.
I thought once we,

194
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.640
once we did the whole fucking premiere of it and it went well,

195
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.880
I thought that that was the end of the bullshit and that old Billy could start

196
00:11:51.881 --> 00:11:56.030
drinking.
So,
um,
I gotta be honest with you,

197
00:11:56.031 --> 00:11:57.780
I didn't really drink that that night.
That,

198
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.260
that was one of those nights you don't drink.
You know,

199
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.430
you just have to be kind of on point the entire time.
But it was,
uh,

200
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:07.770
it was definitely a lot of fun.

201
00:12:07.771 --> 00:12:10.260
Unfortunately Not Toronto is one of my favorite fucking cities.

202
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.280
I just like going up to Canada,
man.
I really enjoy it.
And uh,

203
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.420
but you know,
I was only up there for like 24 hours,

204
00:12:18.421 --> 00:12:21.660
so I didn't get to do some of the things I got to do when I did the tour with

205
00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:26.610
fuzzy.
Um,
but definitely stayed at the same hotel.

206
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.170
My favorite hotel up there at a fucking steam room.
Some old man,
shit,

207
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.770
I gotta be honest to you with steams are the best fucking thing ever,
you know.

208
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.590
But anyone with time you smoke a fucking cigar.
I swear to God,

209
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.040
you taste it the next day until about two in the afternoon.

210
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.030
Unless you wake up in the morning,
Bu Du,
Du,
Du,
Du and you go take a steam,

211
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.960
you take a and you just sweat out all the impurities and I'm telling you,

212
00:12:48.961 --> 00:12:51.660
that shit comes right out.
You're fine,
you're fine.

213
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:56.610
You're sweating out all the cancer.
Um,
anyways,
so that's the deal.

214
00:12:56.611 --> 00:12:59.970
So that movie comes out,
I believe end of October,
early November,

215
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.780
I'm definitely going to get a Mike binder,

216
00:13:03.781 --> 00:13:07.800
the director who put me in the fucking movie,
literally.
Um,

217
00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.090
I'm going to definitely going to get him on the podcast at some point and

218
00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:15.600
possibly,
maybe another cast member will stick.
We will definitely see.

219
00:13:15.601 --> 00:13:19.980
So please look out for that.
Please go pay to see the movie.

220
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.780
Please don't steal it.
But you know,
at the end of the day,
you have all the power.

221
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.360
Um,
all right,
let's continue on.
So anyways,
so then,
then,

222
00:13:30.361 --> 00:13:34.420
uh,
I,
what did I do?
Okay.

223
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.760
So then the next day I wake up,
I take a steam,
right.

224
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.890
And I go over to the fucking airport,
let me mail Billy fancy pants,
right.

225
00:13:39.891 --> 00:13:42.590
Taking steams,
going to premiers.
I had a big weekend.

226
00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:47.630
I'm not gonna apologize for it.
Took me 22 years.
Um,

227
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.670
so,
uh,

228
00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.810
I went over to the airport and I'm sitting in the,
uh,

229
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.260
I'm sitting at the airport and they have all this NFL pregame going on and I'm

230
00:13:57.261 --> 00:13:59.000
thinking,
fuck,
I'm going to miss everything.

231
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:04.630
And I'm watching the pregame and which I never watch and I haven't really

232
00:14:05.631 --> 00:14:10.070
watched it in years.
It's why I don't know anybody's names any more.

233
00:14:10.071 --> 00:14:11.300
And I'm really bad at that.
I mean,

234
00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:16.250
part of it's cause I'm on the road all the fucking time,
but,
uh,
I think,

235
00:14:16.251 --> 00:14:20.350
um,
I dunno,
sorry guys.

236
00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:23.060
Can you tell them looking at something else here on the computer?
I,

237
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.150
so I'm sitting there watching it and uh,

238
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.720
the first thing I see and I started tweeting this shit and it kind of started,

239
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.430
I got a little thing going on Twitter.

240
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:35.490
I'm just the dumb shit that they say in the whole fucking um,

241
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.750
the NFL pregame

242
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.160
<v 6>helix freezer tape right there.
Okay.
Will you see right there?</v>

243
00:14:41.161 --> 00:14:42.750
What are you each making decision?

244
00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:47.480
He is making decisions and that is a good thing he's looking at is not only you

245
00:14:47.481 --> 00:14:50.070
last year he was just looking,
it was his first week.

246
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.040
He was telegraphing where he was going to throw the ball and if she right here

247
00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:56.980
what he's doing,
he has no checking down the field.

248
00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.550
It chicken in third read.
No,

249
00:14:59.551 --> 00:15:02.400
I can tell you when a quarterback judge did daddy's,

250
00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:07.030
when he's doing to play the quarterback position in the field level,
right.

251
00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.100
Fucking all of that shit.

252
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.610
Just a bunch of fucking people in suits.

253
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:14.770
<v 3>Okay.</v>

254
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.640
<v 1>Breaking down the game the way it never needed to be broken down.</v>

255
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.080
It is completely a product of fucking 9,000,

256
00:15:23.081 --> 00:15:25.870
24 hour sports channels.
I mean,
dude,
I'm sitting there.

257
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.700
It's like two and a half hours.

258
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.100
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

259
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.550
<v 1>before kickoff and they're already doing pregame.
It's like dude,</v>

260
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:37.440
pregame used to be a half hour before Brent Musburger,

261
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.370
Irv Cross,
that Kennedy woman,
whatever the hell.

262
00:15:42.371 --> 00:15:46.660
Jackie can't not Jackie Kennedy.
What the hell was her name?
Um,

263
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.550
and then Jimmy,
the Greek that was CBS and then NBC.

264
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.750
You had fucking Bryant Gumbel and Mike Academy.

265
00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:00.310
NFL 81 right?
That's what the fuck do you do?
That's all.

266
00:16:00.311 --> 00:16:03.940
You just watch that and they went around the league and it was cool.
Bing Bang,

267
00:16:03.941 --> 00:16:07.570
boom.
And you were done and then you went to your local fee.
Now you just got,

268
00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:12.010
these guys are out there.
They're acting it out on that half a football field

269
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:14.530
<v 6>over and far.</v>

270
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.560
Tell you right now we're trying to do is you're trying to turn around the

271
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:22.520
culture in the locker were in the locker room for years.
It is.

272
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.910
It has been a mentality that we are not going to win the big one.

273
00:16:25.911 --> 00:16:28.450
And that's why they brought in Joe fucking bag of donuts,

274
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.340
combing their great playground but stupidest shit ever

275
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.070
<v 1>over it fucking over and over.
So anyway,
so I go,
I get on the,</v>

276
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.410
I started tweeting all of that shit and uh,
you know,

277
00:16:40.411 --> 00:16:43.980
just make an a player names and all the dumb shit that they sell.

278
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.290
<v 6>Yeah,
he's a changed man.
He came in,</v>

279
00:16:46.291 --> 00:16:49.410
he came into camp in the best shape of his football life.

280
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.003
<v 3>Okay.</v>

281
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.340
<v 6>It's with the,
to his coaches yet his wife and he,
oh,</v>

282
00:16:55.341 --> 00:16:58.820
he tested positive to weed and I'll tell you that type attitude,

283
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.330
that type attitude is contagious and the locker room.

284
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:04.790
<v 3>Okay,</v>

285
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:08.650
<v 1>how many fucking time did they even sit there?
Rolling their eyes with their,</v>

286
00:17:08.651 --> 00:17:12.800
if their football speak drives me up the fucking wall.

287
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:14.853
<v 6>How anyway,
she,</v>

288
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.920
what he needs to do is he needs to feel the pass rush you have in the national

289
00:17:21.491 --> 00:17:22.324
football league,

290
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:27.390
which you have to be able to do is feel when that pocket is collapsing around

291
00:17:27.641 --> 00:17:28.930
you.
But you got to have a clock in your head.

292
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.500
You got to have a clock in your head and you don't want,
once it's clicking down,

293
00:17:32.501 --> 00:17:33.334
you have to know.

294
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.250
You must get rid of the football cause I'll tell you right now if you don't do

295
00:17:36.251 --> 00:17:40.360
that and you take a sack right there that,
that,
that is a drive killer,
Mike.

296
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.690
<v 3>Okay.</v>

297
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.730
<v 6>Oh absolutely.
Absolutely.
I fully agree what he's doing here.
He goes,
you go.</v>

298
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.720
He's parodying the ball.
He's telegraphing is Paris is,

299
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.740
this is the type of stuff that they worked on in the off season.

300
00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.550
He showed some promising moments in the preseason,
but I go to tell you today,

301
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.190
I don't know where that was.
I got him up here.
I got to wonder,

302
00:17:58.191 --> 00:18:00.020
is it time you hit the panic button?
Darby chat,
Bruh.

303
00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.640
<v 2>Who the fuck can sit there and watch that horse and then what I love is sports</v>

304
00:18:06.641 --> 00:18:07.474
fans.

305
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.550
<v 3>Okay,</v>

306
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.430
<v 2>watch that shit and then it gets,</v>

307
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.520
it's like a virus and then it gets in their fucking heads and then they go out

308
00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:20.580
to sports bars and you talk about football and then they start sounding like

309
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:21.414
those people.

310
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:28.370
<v 6>No try.
You know George,
you got to have a fucking clock in your head,
kid.</v>

311
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.570
One,
1002,

312
00:18:32.571 --> 00:18:37.160
1000 fucking get rid of it.
Throw it out of bounds.

313
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.600
<v 2>Joe,
you're allowed to do that.
As long as you're within the confines.</v>

314
00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:46.110
You the fucking pocket.
Dude.
I can't,

315
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:51.810
I can't fucking,
I can't go to sports bars.
Why would you?

316
00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:54.030
I don't give a fuck how fucking broke you are.

317
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:58.290
There was no reason to not have the NFL package.
Dare is it all right?

318
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:03.510
You can go 40 fucking days without food as long as you got water,
you fine.

319
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.680
Do yourself a fucking favor.
Starve yourself and yes.

320
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:08.971
Okay.

321
00:19:08.971 --> 00:19:13.971
I'm advocating Anorexia to get the NFL package to not go down

322
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.090
to the fucking sports bar.
Eating that heart attack food.

323
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:20.670
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

324
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.030
<v 2>watch it.
A bunch of grown men walking around and jerseys like the dating,</v>

325
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.570
dating the fucking player.

326
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.140
<v 6>Don't all day.
Well</v>

327
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.370
<v 2>Dan,
Horse Shit.</v>

328
00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.290
You gotta go down there looking at those tired waitresses join a horror it up

329
00:19:35.291 --> 00:19:37.470
and they're fucking cutoff ref shirt

330
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:43.570
listening to that bullshit.
Unbelievers.

331
00:19:43.571 --> 00:19:44.890
It tied to make a change.

332
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.360
<v 6>I'll tell you,
I made it up.
I bought,
I am.</v>

333
00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.320
If I am the offsets of coordinator who's head you got to understand with this

334
00:19:52.321 --> 00:19:52.501
kid,

335
00:19:52.501 --> 00:19:57.450
this kid is Chad 19 offensive coordinators and the last seven seasons.

336
00:19:57.451 --> 00:19:59.520
Okay.
I still don't think that we have,

337
00:19:59.521 --> 00:20:04.360
see what this kid is able to do up there.
I'm still holding on.
Yeah,

338
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.310
you could.
You have to learn your skin.
Did he hit her head?
Achy hinge?

339
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.750
<v 2>I don't know.
I can't,
I can't fuck.
Right,
right,
right.
I'm annoying myself just,</v>

340
00:20:13.751 --> 00:20:15.490
just even listening to this shit.
So anyway,

341
00:20:15.491 --> 00:20:20.491
so I get on the fucking plane and all I want to do is watch the game and uh,

342
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.600
you know,
it's funny to watch a fucking game on a plane.
I've been able to,

343
00:20:25.601 --> 00:20:27.040
it's just,
it's the best.

344
00:20:27.041 --> 00:20:32.041
It's just fucking blows through the whole flight mean three hours.

345
00:20:32.471 --> 00:20:36.430
I mean,
you just crushed your flight.
And,
uh,
so I get on there,
you know,

346
00:20:36.431 --> 00:20:40.660
and somebody always has money on it or somebody is like totally ended the team,

347
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:42.460
you know.

348
00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.490
You know what's funny is if the game kind of boring and then you turn it right

349
00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.190
and then all of a sudden some happens and here's these guys,
like whatever,

350
00:20:50.191 --> 00:20:54.510
like 10 rows back.
And I'm like,
whoa.
Any quickly turn it back on.

351
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:59.220
Um,
you start watching it.
It's the best time of the year to fly.

352
00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:05.160
Provided you're on like a virgin or a jet blue or somebody like that that's

353
00:21:05.161 --> 00:21:08.510
going to American Airlines where they're going to have the fucking game.
Uh,

354
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.420
unfortunately I was on Air Canada.

355
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.800
We don't give a fuck up by Yo,

356
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:21.720
Eh,
do you ever American sports?
You know what they had?

357
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.140
I saw sports in my heart is pumping,
going,
oh my God,

358
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:29.430
I'm going to have NFL football.
All right,
I'm going to be flying over.

359
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.100
What's the closest NFL city to Toronto.

360
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.230
<v 7>Okay.</v>

361
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:37.940
<v 2>Is it Cleveland or is it Detroit?
Both the separated by water.
Right?</v>

362
00:21:37.941 --> 00:21:40.460
What gave am I going to get?
Am I going to get Pittsburgh?

363
00:21:40.461 --> 00:21:44.570
Fucking Cleveland did Detroit play?
I don't even fucking know.

364
00:21:44.571 --> 00:21:47.360
I missed everything.
Um,
I get to get the Chicago game.
Hey,

365
00:21:47.361 --> 00:21:51.050
maybe I'll get lucky and I'll get to watch my patriots play the Miami Dolphins.

366
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:51.913
Right.

367
00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:53.770
<v 7>Okay.</v>

368
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:58.770
<v 2>So I click on the sports little thing there and unfortunately I got uh,</v>

369
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.540
all they had was taped games games that already happened and it was highlights

370
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:06.730
from the 2014 World Cup.

371
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.063
<v 7>So</v>

372
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.500
<v 2>I did what any man does in those moments.
I can't watch sports.</v>

373
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.250
I'm going to watch a documentary cause that's the only other thing that's going

374
00:22:20.251 --> 00:22:21.400
to fucking be engaging

375
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.640
<v 7>enough.
Um,</v>

376
00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.110
<v 2>oh fuck.
22 minutes and I got,
I got to read some advertising here.</v>

377
00:22:27.111 --> 00:22:32.110
Hang on a second.
Hang on,
hang on,
hang on,
hang on.
Um,
alright.
Oh,

378
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.780
speaking of football,
everybody,

379
00:22:35.781 --> 00:22:37.370
I got something here for you.
All right.

380
00:22:37.371 --> 00:22:39.280
If you just want to stop talking trash to your friends,

381
00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:43.760
you actually want to make a little bit of doubt.

All right.
Dollar Shave Club.

405
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:18.590
Everybody ever wonder why razors are so expensive?
I mean,

406
00:24:18.591 --> 00:24:21.650
does it make any sense?
Big Shave companies are changing,

407
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.010
are charging you for ridiculous shaving technology.

408
00:24:25.011 --> 00:24:29.360
You don't need first vibrating handles.
Then flashlights.
Now pivot ball,

409
00:24:29.361 --> 00:24:32.840
flex heads.
What's going to happen next?
MP,
three players.

410
00:24:32.841 --> 00:24:35.270
What else do we need in there?
You know,
enough is enough.

411
00:24:35.271 --> 00:24:38.300
Joined Dollar Shave club.com.com for a few bucks a month.

412
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:43.160
They'll shave.com delivers the world's best razors right to your front door.

413
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.000
Not only are they cheaper,
they bring them right to you.

414
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.800
This is the greatest idea ever.

415
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.080
I think dollar shave club dot coms are better than the big shape companies for a

416
00:24:54.081 --> 00:24:55.760
fraction of the price is so easy.

417
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.090
Go to dollar shave club.com pickup one of their raises.

418
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.420
They start at three bucks a month.
You don't have to break the bank.

419
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:03.770
You don't have to get your care.

420
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.460
You don't have to resort to cheap disposable razors to save cast all

421
00:25:07.461 --> 00:25:11.780
shape.co.com is amazing.
Every month they ship you automatic deliveries.

422
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.210
You'll never forget to buy blades again.

423
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.040
You don't have to squeeze a squeeze shaves out of a dull,
dirty old razor blade.

424
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.890
All right?
This is a joke.
This is a no brainer.

425
00:25:21.891 --> 00:25:23.570
You get to shave with a fresh blade every week.

426
00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:26.750
This is absolutely mandatory for anyone that wants a great shape.

427
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:30.080
He deserve better than a dull blade,
you know,

428
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.050
and you have a finite time on the planet earth.

429
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.760
Why wasted standing in line at CVS?
No more ridiculous shaving technology.

430
00:25:37.761 --> 00:25:38.900
Make the smarter choice.

431
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:44.080
Go to dollar shave club.com/bird B u r r that's dollar shave club.com/bar are

432
00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.890
right back to the podcast.
So anyways,

433
00:25:48.891 --> 00:25:53.660
so I get on the fucking plane and I click on and all they have is highlights of

434
00:25:53.661 --> 00:25:56.510
the World Cup.
And I'm thinking,
all right,
I deserve that karmically.

435
00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.250
I've done enough piece of shit things in life.

436
00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:01.940
I deserve the fact that NFL football is not on right now.

437
00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:05.900
And I have to watch World Cup repeats of World Cup soccer,

438
00:26:05.901 --> 00:26:10.901
which I would watch if there was an NFL football on the real football,

439
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.480
not the football.
The rest of the world plays,

440
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.820
you know what the rest of the world is there,

441
00:26:16.821 --> 00:26:21.110
like a bunch of mainstream fucking hacks.
You know,

442
00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.170
they all want the same football,
right?

443
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.630
Like that fucking teeny bop and whore,

444
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.700
whatever the fuck her name is Miley Cyrus,
like if she fucking played a sport,

445
00:26:31.701 --> 00:26:34.520
she plays soccer.
American football.

446
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:39.550
That's like the underground band with balls that's trying to stick it to the

447
00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:44.200
man,
man.
Sorry.
Whatever.
I like football.
Go fuck

448
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.250
<v 1>yourselves.
All right with your fucking bangers and mash.</v>

449
00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:50.650
Anyways.
Um,

450
00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:52.070
<v 0>okay.</v>

451
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:55.100
<v 1>The fuck am I talking about?
So I get on this.
So yeah.
So I,
I'm like,</v>

452
00:26:55.101 --> 00:26:55.911
what am I going to watch it?

453
00:26:55.911 --> 00:27:00.470
So I started watching this documentary about this dolphin that was hanging out

454
00:27:00.471 --> 00:27:05.310
around New Zealand and this woman started hanging out with the dolphin,

455
00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:08.540
started thinking about the dolphin in the middle of the night,
if it was lonely.

456
00:27:08.541 --> 00:27:11.570
And she go in the water with the thing that we've got really fucking creepy.

457
00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:15.440
You know when people start fucking befriending a wild animal,

458
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:20.330
especially when it lives in a fucking a world that you can't breathe and you

459
00:27:20.331 --> 00:27:25.160
know,
I guess it's a mammal.
So it comes to the surface.

460
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:28.550
Is that the connection?
I was like,
wow,

461
00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.620
you have to come up for air too.

462
00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.820
So she started getting really creepy close with this dolphin and then they

463
00:27:34.821 --> 00:27:37.850
started showing the fishermen that were getting annoyed by the dolphin cause it

464
00:27:37.851 --> 00:27:41.030
was eating all the fish.
And it was getting right to that point where I'm like,

465
00:27:41.031 --> 00:27:44.630
something tragic is going to happen to this doll and I'm going to start welling

466
00:27:44.631 --> 00:27:47.630
up tearing up on an airplane and I don't want this to happen.

467
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.750
So I turned the channel.
That's how I watch all nature shows.

468
00:27:50.751 --> 00:27:54.320
I watched the part about the animal and right when it gets to the point and then

469
00:27:54.321 --> 00:27:58.580
man came and they show that fucking machine that just pulls trees out of the

470
00:27:58.581 --> 00:28:00.380
ground like the hulk.

471
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.580
You ever seen that fucking thing where one man in this God damn machine could do

472
00:28:04.581 --> 00:28:08.480
more fucking damage than a fucking hurricane,
you know?

473
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.120
So I kinda knew I was going to tap out.

474
00:28:11.121 --> 00:28:15.290
So I tapped out on that and I decided to watch some classic TV.

475
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.120
And um,

476
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.020
this made me feel really old in classic TV.

477
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.510
They actually had wk RP and Cincinnati.

478
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.980
And I remember when that show came out.
I used to watch it every week.

479
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:33.790
You guys remember that show?
No.
Well,
here's a little reminder,
but dupont do,

480
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.180
baby,
if you ever wondered,
maybe this is a freshman member,

481
00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:42.200
uh,
your memory,
Wanda,
whatever became of me,

482
00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.040
I'm living only,
hey,
we're in Cincinnati,

483
00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:51.470
Cincinnati,
w.
K.
O.
P.
Remember that bill?

484
00:28:51.471 --> 00:28:53.210
There's no way you're going to sing the whole song.

485
00:28:53.211 --> 00:28:58.211
Got Tan at Saddleback back in town to town,

486
00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.170
a bed down the die.

487
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:05.750
Maybe you were me were never meant to be just baby.

488
00:29:05.751 --> 00:29:10.060
Think of me once in a while.
I'm met.
Damion,
you

489
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:11.530
<v 8>p.</v>

490
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:17.000
<v 1>So I watched an episode of that and I got to tell you,</v>

491
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.990
I don't think I've ever seen a writer's room just tap out the way they did at

492
00:29:20.991 --> 00:29:22.100
the end of that episode.

493
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

494
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.750
<v 1>It was just fucking episode where Dr Johnny Fever,</v>

495
00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:33.690
they have basically given away $5,000 like 100 bucks at a time throughout the

496
00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.650
summer.
And Johnny fever reads it wrong and says it's a $5,000 giveaway.

497
00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:43.700
So they go,
fuck,
what are we going to do it?
Mr. Carlson who runs the,

498
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.240
the station goes,
if we have to give away five grand,

499
00:29:47.241 --> 00:29:51.080
not only his favor losing his job for some reason.
Uh

500
00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:52.160
<v 3>Okay.</v>

501
00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.840
<v 1>Andy Travis is also going to lose his job as well as Venus fly trap.</v>

502
00:29:56.841 --> 00:29:58.370
Who's another fucking DJ?

503
00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.550
But I guess they threw him in because he was African American.
But fuck you.

504
00:30:01.551 --> 00:30:04.520
We've been looking for a reason to get rid of you anyways because this is

505
00:30:04.521 --> 00:30:06.350
Cincinnati in 1979.

506
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:07.650
<v 3>Okay,</v>

507
00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.450
<v 1>so what do they do?
They guide you,</v>

508
00:30:09.451 --> 00:30:12.900
basically you got a name five songs only here in a couple of notes.

509
00:30:12.901 --> 00:30:16.800
So they splice them together so fucking quickly they don't think anybody's going

510
00:30:16.801 --> 00:30:18.090
to get get it.

511
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.510
But of course somebody gets it and now they got five grand of cash.

512
00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.220
Everybody's going to lose their fucking money.

513
00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:27.210
And then what ends up happening is this guy shows up,
the claim,

514
00:30:27.211 --> 00:30:29.100
the money they give the guy the money and he leaves.

515
00:30:29.101 --> 00:30:32.610
And then two seconds later the real guy shows up and they realize they gave away

516
00:30:32.611 --> 00:30:33.444
the wrong money.

517
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:37.620
But Johnny fevers smelled a rat and he went down and he got the money back and

518
00:30:37.621 --> 00:30:40.950
hands it to Mr. Carlson and that evidently made,
made it all better.

519
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.230
And then they ended the episode.
It's like a,
wait a minute.

520
00:30:43.231 --> 00:30:44.520
What about the guy who actually want it?

521
00:30:44.521 --> 00:30:46.650
He's standing there and you still got to give him the five grand

522
00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:49.700
and then it just ended.

523
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:50.560
<v 3>Okay,</v>

524
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.620
<v 6>they played the ends.
The ends off bad data.
Bob made a</v>

525
00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:01.780
damn about [inaudible] Pat,

526
00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:06.320
<v 1>I'm not even exaggerating.
That's how the song goes at the end of Wk Rp,</v>

527
00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.570
you can't understand one fucking word.

528
00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.053
<v 6>Hey Hannah,</v>

529
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.680
Hannah where Gig Buddha

530
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:21.670
<v 1>and then the cat comes up
and that was seventies fucking television.</v>

531
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.600
Sorry.
Anyways,
um,
so let's get to my fucking,

532
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:31.050
my New England patriots.
I didn't see anything of the game.

533
00:31:31.051 --> 00:31:35.610
I just saw the highlights.
But uh,
I got to admit,
I can't say dude,

534
00:31:35.611 --> 00:31:39.360
I called it,
I can't remember if I said it on this podcast.

535
00:31:39.361 --> 00:31:42.120
I sent it to a friend of mine where I thought this year the Patriots were going

536
00:31:42.121 --> 00:31:46.950
to dip a little bit and everybody else in our division was going to get a little

537
00:31:46.951 --> 00:31:48.960
bit better.
It's just a,

538
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:50.420
<v 3>okay.</v>

539
00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.340
<v 1>It's just what it is.
It is what it is.</v>

540
00:31:52.341 --> 00:31:54.800
You can only be on top for so fucking long.

541
00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.510
We've been on top of our division anyways for a long fucking time.
And um,

542
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:02.933
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

543
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:06.840
<v 1>I Dunno.
It just seemed like we were actually doing okay against the team.</v>

544
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:12.030
Was it like 20 to 10 or something like that at the half?
And then we just,

545
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.940
we couldn't do anything after that.

546
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.970
<v 6>They went,
are they married her half time?</v>

547
00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.970
A judge Birch and then the Patriots never judged you to you time

548
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:25.380
<v 9>to tell you,
you know.
Oh,
I,
for one I didn't like their tray.</v>

549
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:30.210
Logan,
could you go juggle jokes?
You boy.

550
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.510
<v 3>Okay.</v>

551
00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.340
<v 1>I'm sure that doing all of that shit.</v>

552
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:35.580
<v 3>Okay.</v>

553
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:39.900
<v 1>And everybody freaking the fuck out about where the Patriots are.
Okay.</v>

554
00:32:39.901 --> 00:32:44.790
First of all,
it's only one week and then second of all,
you know,
not for nothing.

555
00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.880
We're on a 14 season run.

556
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.970
I think we've won the division every fucking year.

557
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:58.140
It saved me except maybe once or twice throughout Tom's whole career.

558
00:32:58.221 --> 00:33:00.020
I think the jets one at one year.

559
00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.113
<v 7>MMM.</v>

560
00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.480
<v 1>No,
they couldn't want it to do then when that year,</v>

561
00:33:04.481 --> 00:33:07.510
because we never played them in a way game,

562
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:12.380
they always came up to,
to meet.
I don't fucking know.
Um,

563
00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:17.170
all I remember the year a Brady went down and we went 11 and five and we didn't

564
00:33:17.171 --> 00:33:20.080
make the fucking playoffs.
I think when we had Matt Cassel.

565
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.680
And that was when Paul Versey said,
Matt Castles for Real,

566
00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:25.870
the guy's for real.

567
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:30.310
These mobile in the pocket will blow all that type of shit.
And I was like,
dude,

568
00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.290
he's fucking,

569
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.150
he went 11 and five with the 16 and o team last year in the regular season.

570
00:33:37.151 --> 00:33:39.640
He lost five more games than the team did.

571
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.750
It's the fact that you're counting down from 16 and now it's 11.

572
00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:48.520
If they won 12 the year before.
All right.
Do the fucking math.

573
00:33:48.521 --> 00:33:51.880
I had to say that to give myself a chance to catch up,
they would all,

574
00:33:51.881 --> 00:33:56.840
they would have gone seven and nine.
Right.
But I say five less five less from 12.

575
00:33:56.841 --> 00:34:00.340
Yes,
seven and nine.
Then you would have been like,
this guy stinks.

576
00:34:00.341 --> 00:34:05.170
Ship 'em out of fucking town.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,

577
00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:09.550
I would say that Logan Mankins was,
uh,

578
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.330
I mean obviously that was a main,
a main point,

579
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:17.140
but it also sounded like they,
they are,
once again,

580
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:22.100
our fucking defense is another issue.
And uh,

581
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.320
I dunno,
man,
I,
I didn't see the game,
but it sounded like,
you know,

582
00:34:27.321 --> 00:34:29.870
we've got Vince Wilfork back and it just sounded like they just kind of went

583
00:34:29.871 --> 00:34:33.470
through a defense like butter.
Uh,

584
00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:34.940
so we will see what happened.

585
00:34:34.941 --> 00:34:39.080
I'm by no means conceding the whole fucking year because of one week.

586
00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:44.330
But,
um,
you gotta be honest,
like as a sports fan,

587
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.910
how long can the Patriots keep winning division,

588
00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.450
the AFC east and how long can the bills Jetson,

589
00:34:50.451 --> 00:34:53.780
dolphins suck mean you suck every year.

590
00:34:53.781 --> 00:34:56.660
You gotta be drafted really high,
right?

591
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.480
At some point you got to pick somebody.

592
00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.730
I don't even know the name of the Dolphin's quarterback,

593
00:35:01.731 --> 00:35:03.470
but I kind of looked up his stats from last year,

594
00:35:03.471 --> 00:35:07.640
the gamma's through for 4,000 yards.
The Guy,
he's no slouch.

595
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:12.980
<v 10>Oh,
Joe.
You know,
these teams,
they know each other.
They meet twice a year.</v>

596
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.340
These teams,
they know what they do.
And Antonio Toyota,

597
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.590
I know it's hard to be team two times one season.

598
00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:20.883
<v 7>MMM.</v>

599
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.950
<v 1>So it's going to be really interesting to see.
Uh,
I don't know.</v>

600
00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:30.110
I'm a fucking nerd,
man.
I,
I still love the shit.
Even,
even if we suck this year,

601
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:32.100
I'm still gonna Watch every game and the less,
you know,

602
00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:36.890
I'm on a Goddamn airplane,
but,
uh,
you know,

603
00:35:36.891 --> 00:35:41.250
it what it is.
You can
only fucking hang in there for so goddamn long.

604
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:45.600
Not to mention bill Bellacheck has been the guy,
so everybody dissects.

605
00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:48.570
What the fuck it is you do.
They take your coaching staff and every,

606
00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:51.930
the fact that he's been able to go on the run that he's been able to go on this

607
00:35:51.931 --> 00:35:52.980
is fucking amazing.

608
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.290
And also how excited people were when they saw Tom with his head down,
you know,

609
00:35:58.291 --> 00:35:59.400
and the towel over his head,

610
00:35:59.401 --> 00:36:03.850
like he had fucking congestion or something like that.
Right.
Could just did,

611
00:36:03.851 --> 00:36:06.520
knows failure,
whatever the fuck it is.
Um,

612
00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:12.580
that actually made me laugh.
Like people,
like best picture of Tom Brady ever.

613
00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.420
All that says to me is a patriots fan is this guy's been raping you for fucking

614
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:21.490
the better part of a decade and a half.
All right.
Um,

615
00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:25.180
so we shall see.
We'll shit,
we'll see what's going on.
I missed everything.

616
00:36:25.181 --> 00:36:28.360
I missed college football.
I missed absolutely fucking everything.

617
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:32.110
I don't even know what happened,
so I'm just going to shut up about it.
Um,

618
00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:36.520
and with that,
let me get into,
uh,
some of the reads this week,

619
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.910
uh,
for the month of loading park.
They didn't do anything else.

620
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.100
I'm trying to think.
Oh,
you know what I was watching last night.
You don't,

621
00:36:43.101 --> 00:36:47.050
I'm fucking car crazy right now.
And I watched this great,
uh,

622
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.090
this great youtube video of,
um,

623
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:57.080
the fucking Mercedes Benz,
SLS AMG GT,

624
00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:02.330
right?
That one that opens up like the original one from 1955 with the goings.

625
00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:07.670
And,
uh,
it's a base price of 221,000,
$580.

626
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:10.670
And you know,
those are the kinds of cars that you look at.

627
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:15.920
I was looking at the roadster,
by the way,
which I guess is 228,000,
$80.

628
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:19.250
These are the kinds of cars that you look at when you go on the fucking
Internet.

629
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.130
It's great cause back in the day you would,

630
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:25.970
you would actually have to go down to the lot if they even had one and they

631
00:37:25.971 --> 00:37:30.450
would chase you away.
They'd see you walking up going,
Oda,
forget that.
Hey,

632
00:37:30.451 --> 00:37:34.700
your fucking bomb.
We got chevettes down this street.

633
00:37:34.701 --> 00:37:38.960
They're freckles.
So what I love about this thing is you can actually walk,

634
00:37:38.961 --> 00:37:43.670
like I watched a whole test drive.
This guy drove it through.
Um,
you know,

635
00:37:43.671 --> 00:37:46.180
we started off on the coast of Portland and road,

636
00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:47.770
drove it all the way up to mount hood.

637
00:37:47.771 --> 00:37:50.050
And what was funny is a lot of the roads he was on,

638
00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.750
or at least the areas he was on,
I've actually been,

639
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:58.500
I've actually driven on but probably in like a fucking a Chevy Lumina or a dodge

640
00:37:59.651 --> 00:38:02.830
neon or of,
what else did I always fucking end up getting somehow.

641
00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

642
00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:09.100
<v 1>Ford Taurus,
if I a splurge for the full size car.
I used to do this Gig,</v>

643
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:13.990
this college down in Coos Bay on the coast of Portland.

644
00:38:13.991 --> 00:38:18.760
And uh,
I used to drive down cause I was trying to save money and uh,

645
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.350
I used to always do it.
I would,
I would,
you know,

646
00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:24.310
I'd have a Gig on the fucking western part of Nebraska and I would fly into

647
00:38:24.311 --> 00:38:29.020
Lincoln and then just get on the 80.
I still remember the highways,
the 80,

648
00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:32.470
the 80 was all the way across Nebraska.
The 70,

649
00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.750
that was a

650
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:36.763
<v 2>Kansas.</v>

651
00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:43.170
Then when you got up north it was 90 and 94 and that went through like,

652
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:44.480
<v 0>okay,</v>

653
00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.500
<v 2>the Dakotas and Wyoming and Montana.
Then nuts.</v>

654
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.700
<v 0>Okay.</v>

655
00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:53.240
<v 2>And I think it's the 40 is south of the 70.</v>

656
00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.030
For those of you haven't done a lot of road shit.
Uh,

657
00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:01.900
even numbers go east West on the interstates in,
in odds go north,
south,

658
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.850
let some truck and shit for you.
All right.
It starts out on the west coast.

659
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:08.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

660
00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:12.070
<v 2>Pacific coast highway.
Let me see how much this is my OCD kicking in the you got,</v>

661
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.940
what does that do?
That's for one,

662
00:39:15.941 --> 00:39:19.930
but they got a route one on fucking east coast to whatever.
You got the five.

663
00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:21.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

664
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.160
<v 2>Right.
That goes from San Diego all the way up to the fucking Canadian border.</v>

665
00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:31.590
Then you got the 15 and I believe the 15 that goes off of the 10 it goes all the

666
00:39:31.591 --> 00:39:34.860
way up to Vegas,
continues up through Utah.

667
00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:38.010
Then you can make a right at the 70 and take that all the way to New York.

668
00:39:38.011 --> 00:39:41.130
I've done that.
But if you continue on up,
which I've never done,

669
00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:46.820
that goes right up that splits fucking Nevada and half and I think it goes up to

670
00:39:47.101 --> 00:39:50.340
Boise,
Idaho or into Montana or some shit.

671
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:55.740
Then you got the 25 which is basically starts in breaking bad country.

672
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

673
00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:01.630
<v 2>Goes right up through Denver,
Cheyenne,
Wyoming,</v>

674
00:40:01.631 --> 00:40:04.960
all the way up to fuck in the middle of why a fucking Montana.

675
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:09.430
Then you've got the 35 I took that one,
drove that one up from Austin,

676
00:40:09.431 --> 00:40:12.520
Texas up to Dallas.
That one goes right up to fucking Oklahoma,

677
00:40:12.521 --> 00:40:16.270
right through fucking loa up then.
I don't know where it goes from there.

678
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.780
I never did.
The honor was 65 or something.

679
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:24.710
You can take that from Indianapolis down to Nashville or something like that.

680
00:40:24.711 --> 00:40:25.750
It's some 60 something.

681
00:40:25.751 --> 00:40:28.300
I used to do that all the time and I was trying to sell tickets down south.

682
00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:32.290
I do Bob and Tom and uh,
I dunno.

683
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.950
And then all the fucking rest of them,
95 and all those kinds of,
sorry.

684
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.600
Anyways,

685
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.800
so I'm watching this fucking video and I used to do this gig down there in Coos

686
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.640
Bay and uh,
so this guy's driving this,
but you got to see this fucking car dude.

687
00:40:45.641 --> 00:40:49.180
It's a fucking God damn James Bond car.
Uh,

688
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:51.830
it's unbelievable.

689
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:52.790
<v 0>Okay.</v>

690
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:53.930
<v 2>I was actually looking at it going,</v>

691
00:40:53.931 --> 00:40:57.740
you know what if I sold my house and I just put it all into that car,

692
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.070
um,
you got to hear the thing.
It's just fucking insane.

693
00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.780
I am completely sold on German cars.
I just think they're the fucking best.
Um,

694
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:15.380
I do like Italian cars too,
but you know,
the Germans,

695
00:41:15.381 --> 00:41:17.340
they just take it to that next level and it,

696
00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:21.650
it really is because they don't care.
They just don't care about human life.

697
00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.330
You know what I mean?
They don't,
and I know that you say,
well,

698
00:41:26.331 --> 00:41:30.740
what about all this safety?
I,
they doing that for their area and brothers,

699
00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.130
they're doing that to protect the fear.
That's

700
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:38.480
<v 1>why they,
they,
they make the car is safe as it is,</v>

701
00:41:38.481 --> 00:41:41.540
but it's not for guys like me.
Like,
you know,
if Hitler,

702
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.230
if Hitler like succeeded.
Okay.

703
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.500
And he exterminated all the people he wanted to exterminate.

704
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:53.650
How long would a fucking redhead like me be able to be able to stand in his

705
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:58.220
vicinity before onto,
I'm sick of looking at that gets a writ.

706
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:05.060
I never would have fucking made it.
Um,
anyways,

707
00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:10.160
they'd throw me in right after the fucking albinos.
Um,

708
00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.020
so anyways,
yeah,
there their cars are just fucking insane.
And uh,

709
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.140
I am still 100% hooked on that.
Uh,

710
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:22.970
I think the fucking Mercedes Benz stationwagon AMG is one of the coolest fucking

711
00:42:22.971 --> 00:42:27.290
cars out there just as far as a sleeper.
I just think that is the sickest car.

712
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:32.060
I got a couple of videos.
I,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll send you a link of the video for,

713
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:35.960
um,
for that,
that,
that um,

714
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:40.400
that Mercedes SLS,
gt roadster that this guy took.
It was just,

715
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:41.810
it just was the fucking shit.

716
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.673
<v 11>You know what I mean?</v>

717
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.110
<v 1>Oh my God.
Why did I look at that fucking car?
That's just,
that's why I,
you know,</v>

718
00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:50.870
you don't,
you ever go like when they have open houses,

719
00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:52.200
<v 11>okay.</v>

720
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.940
<v 1>In,
you know,
in a nice neighborhood and you'd fucking you with,
you know,</v>

721
00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:58.530
whoever the fuck,
hey,
let's go look,
let's just fuck it.

722
00:42:58.531 --> 00:43:00.000
And it's the worst thing you could ever fucking do,

723
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.113
<v 11>you know,</v>

724
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.030
<v 1>because then he got to go back to where you live</v>

725
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:09.660
and that's,

726
00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:13.580
I'm warning you right now that you're going to watch this video and just know

727
00:43:13.581 --> 00:43:17.840
that you're then going to have to go back to the car that you drive it and um,

728
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.410
whatever.
I love my Prius.
Go Fuck Yourself.
But Jesus Christ,

729
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.300
is that a fucking unbelievable car?
God Damn it.
You mother fuckers,

730
00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.370
you should have to be making a certain amount of fucking money before you,

731
00:43:31.371 --> 00:43:33.110
they even let you watch that video,

732
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:34.973
<v 11>you know?</v>

733
00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:40.290
<v 1>Fuck.
All right.
Anyways,
let's,
uh,
let's,</v>

734
00:43:40.291 --> 00:43:43.250
let's continue on here with the podcast.
Um,

735
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:45.640
all right.

736
00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:49.930
This was an interesting email because this could go like 9,000 different ways.

737
00:43:49.931 --> 00:43:53.170
All right.
See,
it says black guy voice.
It says bill,

738
00:43:53.171 --> 00:43:57.490
my girlfriend and I have found a hot button issue between the two of us.

739
00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:02.290
She hates a black guy voice that I do when I make jokes.
He goes,

740
00:44:02.291 --> 00:44:05.770
I'm not black and neither is she.
Uh,
when we started dating,

741
00:44:05.771 --> 00:44:06.970
I didn't really do it,

742
00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:10.630
but when we were playing monopoly with one of my oldest friends and I started

743
00:44:10.631 --> 00:44:14.350
winning once know once I was winning and my oldest friend was there,

744
00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:19.630
the old black guy voice made an appearance.
I don't really say racist things.

745
00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:22.720
What does that mean?
I don't really say racist thing.
Or He's saying like,

746
00:44:22.721 --> 00:44:25.960
I don't really say racist thing.
I can't tell cause you're writing this stuff.

747
00:44:25.961 --> 00:44:28.720
So he goes,
I would just say stuff like,
Oh yeah,

748
00:44:28.721 --> 00:44:32.400
give me that dollar or this is some Cheddar right here.

749
00:44:32.401 --> 00:44:35.230
I'm not going to try to even do a fucking black guy voice here.
Oh,
hi.

750
00:44:35.231 --> 00:44:37.050
Jackie went,
ah,
he goes,

751
00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:42.030
I also show showered my dog and $500 bills and rubbed it all over his body.

752
00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:45.450
Like I was,
uh,
at,
uh,
like it was a party.

753
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.710
My friend found it hilarious.
My girlfriend said I was mocking her.

754
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.970
I love that she's making it about her.
I thought that she was going like,
listen,

755
00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.900
what you're doing is funny if you're doing it like if your heart's in the right

756
00:44:58.901 --> 00:45:03.250
place,
but she's,
this is all about her.
She goes,
he goes,
personally,
I think she's,

757
00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:07.720
I think being an asshole is an expected part of the game.

758
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:10.840
I guess the game of monopoly,
but that's just me.
He goes,

759
00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:14.950
now that we've moved in together,
I continued to do the voice in a playful way.

760
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:20.350
Uh,
if she asked for a favor,
I might reply,
shirt dog.
I got you.

761
00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:24.460
See,
I think that's fucking funny.
Um,
it goes,

762
00:45:24.461 --> 00:45:27.760
and then she glares at me and tells me she hates that voice.

763
00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:31.420
She doesn't understand.
This is when it gets weird though.
He goes,
oh,

764
00:45:31.421 --> 00:45:35.110
then I'm making fun of people who talk like that and I'm not trying to make fun

765
00:45:35.111 --> 00:45:37.240
of her.
This is where it goes off the raised rails for me.

766
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:38.933
<v 7>Uh,</v>

767
00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.470
<v 1>and I don't know,
but I don't know how you make it fun of him.</v>

768
00:45:42.471 --> 00:45:47.180
He just being ridiculous.
Like the way I'll do like a southern voice lack.

769
00:45:47.181 --> 00:45:51.050
May it got,
damn it.
Get your fucking ass in here.
I asked for a sandwich.

770
00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:52.753
<v 7>Right.</v>

771
00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.610
<v 1>And is that,
what is the rule?</v>

772
00:45:54.611 --> 00:45:57.580
Because I'm making fun of redneck white people and I'm white.

773
00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:00.340
I'm allowed to do that.
Um,

774
00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.400
it all depends on it real.
All of this shit.

775
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:07.480
It all depends on how you're doing it.
Like what your point is.

776
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.273
<v 7>MMM.</v>

777
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:12.090
<v 1>Anyway,
so he goes,
I don't,
I don't really know was</v>

778
00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.213
<v 7>well,</v>

779
00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:17.680
<v 1>he goes,
I don't really know what she thinks I'm,
I'm doing.
Honestly,</v>

780
00:46:17.681 --> 00:46:18.670
I don't see what,

781
00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:20.380
<v 0>yeah,</v>

782
00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:24.580
<v 1>it's so offensive about the voice.
Then he writes an,
I mean,</v>

783
00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.820
I like saying,
Ah Shit and mother fucker.

784
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:33.340
I like referring to our middle aged white neighbor as that ghetto ass n word.

785
00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:37.540
I think it's funny now,
I gotta be honest with you.
Even that is funny.

786
00:46:37.541 --> 00:46:42.541
If you just fucking around with white guy calling some middle aged white dude,

787
00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:47.110
especially if he looks like Flanders.

788
00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:49.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

789
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:50.990
<v 1>I Dunno.
And I know you're not supposed to say that,</v>

790
00:46:50.991 --> 00:46:55.550
but Urania house you fucking around.
It's your world.
It's your TV station.

791
00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:00.020
And I really think if you,
if you're,
if you're not doing any of this maliciously,

792
00:47:00.021 --> 00:47:03.440
like that's,
that's funny.
I think it's funny anyways,

793
00:47:03.441 --> 00:47:06.140
but I don't know where you're coming from with this sir.
Anyways,
he goes,

794
00:47:06.141 --> 00:47:06.974
my question is,

795
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:11.030
do you think I should stop doing the voice or do I have the right to continue

796
00:47:11.031 --> 00:47:14.120
doing it?
You obviously have a right to continue doing it.
Um,
he goes,

797
00:47:14.121 --> 00:47:17.900
I don't consider it racist and it's really just for laughs as a comedian,

798
00:47:17.901 --> 00:47:19.580
I think you can appreciate that.

799
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:23.930
Is My girlfriend being too touchy about it and even if she is being to touch
you,

800
00:47:23.931 --> 00:47:25.670
do I really have a say in it?

801
00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.380
Is this the end of the black guy voice as we know it?

802
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:31.061
I don't even know what that means.

803
00:47:31.061 --> 00:47:36.061
Sometimes I insist on her adding the word DJ before my name when she speaks to

804
00:47:36.731 --> 00:47:39.490
me.
See,
dude,
I think you're just being silly,

805
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.090
but I just do that because I know it pisses her off.
And it's funny.

806
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:48.160
I'm not really an asshole bill.
I,
uh,
if you think I should stop,
I actually will.

807
00:47:48.161 --> 00:47:50.620
It's time for a third party way on this.
Well,
the fact that you say,

808
00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:55.540
if I actually said stop,
you will.
I think I,
it all depends on how you mean this,

809
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:57.670
but this actually

810
00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:03.950
relates to stand up comedy right now where,

811
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:08.870
uh,
you know,
there's a lot of this people go out and they see your act,

812
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.860
they see a bunch of comedians and they listened to you tell a bunch of jokes and

813
00:48:12.861 --> 00:48:14.390
then they pick out one joke,

814
00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:15.870
<v 3>okay.</v>

815
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:20.130
<v 1>And they define you,
they define you by that joke,</v>

816
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:24.780
by how they heard the joke and they define your entire career by that

817
00:48:24.781 --> 00:48:28.890
performance.
You know what I mean?
I mean,
I had some blogger go off on me.

818
00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:30.563
Um,

819
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:31.730
<v 3>okay.</v>

820
00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:34.900
<v 1>How about a show I did recently and it's like I just taped,</v>

821
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.710
I just taped an hour and a half special.

822
00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.200
I just burned an hour and a half of material.

823
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.900
I wasn't ready to go back out on the road.

824
00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:49.420
I had the fucking Goddamn Mississippi River go through the lower part of my

825
00:48:49.421 --> 00:48:54.421
fucking house and I have to make money or else I'm going to go wander.

826
00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.600
Right.
Basically,
you know,

827
00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.420
I'm going to get myself in a ridiculous amount of fucking debt.

828
00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:06.430
So I went out before I was ready to go out and I am,

829
00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:08.620
I need material.
And I,
you know,

830
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:10.660
one of these shows that somebody complained about was,

831
00:49:10.661 --> 00:49:14.350
it was a city that I went to a year ago and I'm not going out there repeating

832
00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:16.840
material.
I'm not fucking people over.

833
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.810
So I went out there and I did my thing.

834
00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:24.500
And you know,
my act,
where my act is right now,

835
00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.360
I don't like where my act is right now.

836
00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:27.480
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

837
00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:32.400
<v 1>At all.
No comic does.
Two months after they take a special,</v>

838
00:49:32.401 --> 00:49:36.180
nobody is happy where they're fucking act as if you're really,
you know,

839
00:49:36.181 --> 00:49:37.350
being honest with yourself.

840
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:41.250
So this person saw me and you know,

841
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:46.070
didn't like what I was talking about it absolutely.
You know,
I mean,

842
00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.570
I just skim them,
send me,
sent me a link.
I just skimmed it.

843
00:49:48.571 --> 00:49:52.680
I didn't really fucking read it,
but it was just like,
you know,

844
00:49:52.681 --> 00:49:55.320
I wouldn't argue with a lot of your perception of it,

845
00:49:55.321 --> 00:50:00.321
but to define me as a stand up comic on one fucking show.

846
00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:02.530
<v 3>Okay.</v>

847
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:06.220
<v 1>You know what I'm trying to try?
It's like doing stand up comedy.</v>

848
00:50:06.221 --> 00:50:08.140
It's not like playing guitar.

849
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:12.040
I can't sit in my bedroom and get better at it and when it's ready to be heard,

850
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.670
go out and go play.
I have to fucking go out there and just,

851
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:20.660
it's like fucking cooking pasta.
Remember the old days you took a noodle out,

852
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:23.180
you throw it at the wall and if it stuck it was done.

853
00:50:23.181 --> 00:50:25.790
If it wasn't you kept going,
that's what you're doing.

854
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:29.000
So this fucking didn't like what I was talking about.

855
00:50:29.001 --> 00:50:34.001
Absolutely trashed me and then like lied like completely either lied or was so

856
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.070
wrapped up in how much they didn't like what I was talking about that they

857
00:50:40.071 --> 00:50:42.200
didn't see what happened.
I mean,
the show I did,

858
00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:46.430
I got a partial standing ovation and they called me back out and this person

859
00:50:46.431 --> 00:50:50.360
left all of that out,
left all of that shit out.

860
00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:54.900
And it was just the way he was a monster.
He was hiring Barack Obama,
got in.

861
00:50:54.901 --> 00:50:58.310
You know,
it's just one of those things where if you're joking,

862
00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:03.440
if you're fucking joking,
then like I don't think the other person,

863
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:06.770
they know they can take it however they want to take it.

864
00:51:06.771 --> 00:51:10.760
But just because they decide to take it seriously doesn't mean that you now

865
00:51:10.761 --> 00:51:15.760
meant it and that sort of like a a,

866
00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:17.060
that's kind of something that's going on.

867
00:51:17.061 --> 00:51:21.560
So what I would say as far as what you're doing is,
you know,

868
00:51:21.561 --> 00:51:23.150
if you're not a racist guy,

869
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:28.550
if you don't have issues and you're just doing it because it's a funny character

870
00:51:28.551 --> 00:51:33.551
and I get doing a character that drives your wife up the wall,

871
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:38.930
I actually,
the character you do,
I will say,
I mean I don't drop the n word,

872
00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:43.130
but I will say that I will do that type of slang.

873
00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.020
But what I do is I,

874
00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:50.500
I do it in my voice and I say it really seriously cause it,

875
00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:56.130
it sounds absolutely grading to my wife and it either really makes her laugh or

876
00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:01.970
annoys the shit out of her.
So,
um,
I dunno.

877
00:52:01.971 --> 00:52:03.650
I think that's part of being with somebody.

878
00:52:03.651 --> 00:52:07.430
You have to have something that you do that they find annoying and you find

879
00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:08.450
hilarious,
so.

880
00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:09.853
<v 7>MMM.</v>

881
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.430
<v 1>You know,
I dunno.
It all,
it all depends.</v>

882
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:19.290
I think it's funny that I would actually,
I can't even get,

883
00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.690
give her shit that she,
she's making it about herself.

884
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:26.880
That actually is kind of one for your side that the way you're doing it isn't in

885
00:52:26.881 --> 00:52:30.900
a racist way,
but she just doesn't like it.
I don't know.

886
00:52:30.901 --> 00:52:34.650
Do the last thing you want to do is take any sort of advice from me when it

887
00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:39.651
comes to fucking women because the way that I grew up was basically if somebody

888
00:52:40.501 --> 00:52:43.310
didn't like something,
you did it even more.

889
00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:45.243
<v 7>MMM.</v>

890
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:51.950
<v 1>It was that sort of sadistic mean level of teasing and a,</v>

891
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.970
for the longest time in my adult life I didn't know where the line was.

892
00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.150
Um,
I used to have this,

893
00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:06.420
this running joke where when I was living with Robert Kelly way back in the day,

894
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:12.630
he had a similar sadistic upbringing that was even worse than mine and he was

895
00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:19.030
the only guy that I met that I can really think of that was further down that

896
00:53:19.031 --> 00:53:22.870
road that I was in.
Basically when people would sit around,

897
00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:25.000
like when we were even at the cellar.

898
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:26.340
<v 0>Okay.</v>

899
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.410
<v 1>When the trashing would start,</v>

900
00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:31.440
a lot of times we would pick up

901
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:35.540
where the game ended would be our startup.
Nah,

902
00:53:35.541 --> 00:53:38.660
maybe not at the cellar because it got pretty fucking me.
But generally speaking,

903
00:53:38.661 --> 00:53:43.661
we would like where we started was the area that most people didn't even delve

904
00:53:44.511 --> 00:53:45.560
in in that game.

905
00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:50.330
And that became like the running joke for a while where people would tease the

906
00:53:50.331 --> 00:53:53.180
two of us at how we played that game,

907
00:53:53.181 --> 00:53:56.360
where someone would make fun of our shirt and then we'd be like,
yeah,

908
00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:00.680
at least my mom is a dead,
like we would take it to and we wouldn't go that far,

909
00:54:00.681 --> 00:54:04.040
but it was,
they would make,
so I actually had to learn

910
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:10.530
to dial it back,
um,
when it comes to stuff like that.
So,

911
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.640
uh,
like I said,

912
00:54:11.641 --> 00:54:15.780
I wouldn't listen to me because I am fucking damaged goods.

913
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:21.240
Um,
alright.
Ghost writer.
Oh,
by the way,
I got to,
uh,

914
00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:23.320
I got,
uh,
uh,

915
00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:24.900
<v 0>okay.</v>

916
00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:29.580
<v 1>You know,
I gotta stop,
you know,
say obviously,
um,
the passing of Joan Rivers,</v>

917
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:34.060
um,
I know I talked about this last week,
but seriously,

918
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:38.500
without a doubt,
not even up for debate.
She's in the top five all time.

919
00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.150
And I would actually,

920
00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:41.380
<v 0>okay,</v>

921
00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:42.880
<v 1>if it was in Vegas and you,</v>

922
00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:46.750
he knew I had to bet who had written more standup material,

923
00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:50.920
Joan Rivers or George Carlin.
Um,

924
00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:53.810
I like,

925
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:59.420
I don't know what the spread would be on that because I saw her when she did

926
00:54:59.421 --> 00:55:03.230
Fallon.
Right.
It was just really cool moment where,
you know,

927
00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:04.610
<v 0>okay,</v>

928
00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:07.040
<v 1>she was in with Johnny Carson and then,
you know,</v>

929
00:55:07.041 --> 00:55:09.860
they offered her own talk shows a famous fucking story.

930
00:55:09.861 --> 00:55:11.690
If you lived under a rock,
maybe you never heard it.
But,

931
00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:15.740
and she agreed to do the talk show and she didn't get Johnny's blessing.

932
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:20.630
And uh,
he looked at it like,
hey,
I'm running a hardware store.

933
00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.520
I'm letting you work here.
Right?

934
00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:25.460
And then you open a hardware store across the street,
go fuck yourself.

935
00:55:25.461 --> 00:55:29.190
You're dead to me.
And he never talked to her again.
Uh,

936
00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:32.300
which I can understand being pissed off,
but never talking to her again.
I mean,

937
00:55:32.301 --> 00:55:36.350
after he had like a 20 year fucking friendship is kind of weird.
Uh,

938
00:55:36.351 --> 00:55:39.530
but if you read some of the autobiographies about his mom and what the fuck she

939
00:55:39.531 --> 00:55:42.290
did to him and all kind of make sense.
So anyways,

940
00:55:42.291 --> 00:55:45.080
she had not been on the tonight show since Johnny had,

941
00:55:45.081 --> 00:55:46.580
if for whatever reason when Leno had it,

942
00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:48.440
it never worked out where she got on the show.

943
00:55:48.441 --> 00:55:50.780
I don't think Jay had anything against it.
She just never did the show.

944
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:55.610
So Fallon gets it and he brings her in and this is the first time she'd been on

945
00:55:55.611 --> 00:55:59.530
the tonight show
in like 20 or 25 years.

946
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:05.200
And Jimmy took out a photo of her where she's on the tonight show with Johnny

947
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:10.180
Carson is Johnny Carson with like,
you know,
black or brown hair and not,
not even,

948
00:56:10.181 --> 00:56:14.860
well one gray or white hair on top of his head.
And uh,

949
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:16.600
she saw it.
She goes,
oh my God.
She goes,

950
00:56:16.601 --> 00:56:20.500
that's my second appearance on the tonight show.
That was 1965.

951
00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:26.940
So she basically,
she did panel talk show panel for almost half a century.

952
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:30.180
I mean,
you're talking about,
uh,

953
00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:35.280
I dunno am the in the the Mount Rushmore comedy.

954
00:56:35.281 --> 00:56:38.100
I think you got to put her in there.
You have to.

955
00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:40.410
<v 7>MMM.</v>

956
00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:42.260
<v 1>So anyways,
yeah,
it's just,</v>

957
00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.950
I remember when I saw the documentary of her and she had though that fucking

958
00:56:44.951 --> 00:56:49.420
card catalog of,
of like literally a library card catalog with all these jokes,

959
00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:52.830
all these different topics and to be able to,

960
00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:56.740
to last and be relevant.
That was another thing too,

961
00:56:56.741 --> 00:57:01.350
is she never got like,
you know,
you'll see legendary comics who just,

962
00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:03.970
they don't change with the times in their crowd.

963
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.550
They keep getting older and their crowd keeps getting older.

964
00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:08.050
And I think what really

965
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.983
<v 7>mmm</v>

966
00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:15.220
<v 1>is a benchmark for you as an artist is if despite the fact that you keep getting</v>

967
00:57:15.751 --> 00:57:19.650
old,
um,
you keep you,
it's like every new generation,

968
00:57:19.651 --> 00:57:22.830
it's like you're surfing and you catch that wave every fucking time.

969
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:24.360
And if you went to go see,

970
00:57:24.361 --> 00:57:28.650
or you would see people from their 20s all the way up to her age,

971
00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:32.490
you see that with acts like Neil Young.
There's very few,

972
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:35.280
um,
artists that do that.

973
00:57:35.281 --> 00:57:38.850
And the only ones who do it are the ones that continue to,
I feel,

974
00:57:38.851 --> 00:57:40.170
continued to grow.

975
00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:41.933
<v 7>MMM.</v>

976
00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:48.460
<v 1>And they stay current or you just continue doing what you do and you,</v>

977
00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.850
what,
what you do.
You do.

978
00:57:49.851 --> 00:57:53.660
It's so fucking well that it remains undeniable.

979
00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:58.720
And to me that's ACDC and they're fucking hilarious about their body of work.

980
00:57:59.991 --> 00:58:01.340
I remember one time somebody was,

981
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:05.750
gave him a little bit of a dig in an interview going like,
you know,

982
00:58:05.751 --> 00:58:07.670
you've made the same al album

983
00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:13.590
17 times in a row.
And then one of them in the band was like,
you know what,

984
00:58:13.591 --> 00:58:18.030
that's bullshit.
That's bullshit.
We've done it 18 times in a row.

985
00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:22.930
And they all,
and everybody in the band laughed and
yeah,

986
00:58:22.931 --> 00:58:26.280
no,
I mean I that might even be harder than fucking staying relevant is to do the

987
00:58:26.281 --> 00:58:29.710
same sort of thing that long in a rough,
but anyway,

988
00:58:29.711 --> 00:58:34.650
so a huge,
huge,
huge fucking huge loss.

989
00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:37.470
Um,
without a doubt.
The real deal.

990
00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:40.980
So Definitely gonna Ms. Joan Rivers.
So anyways,
with that,

991
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:44.130
because this is a comedy writing thing here,
somebody brought this up,

992
00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:48.360
ghost writer.
Hello Bill.
Sorry,
I don't have any funny nickname to give you.

993
00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:51.990
He said,
I wanted to get your take on ghost writers for Comedians.

994
00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:57.240
Would you fault any comedian who has a ghost writer and or are ghostwriters a

995
00:58:57.241 --> 00:58:59.340
commonly known part of standup comedy,

996
00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:03.150
especially for Comedians that are well known slash established.
Thanks.

997
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:06.960
And don't go fuck yourself.
I like this guy.
He went,
he took a left turn,

998
00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:10.830
no nickname,
and he didn't tell me to go fuck myself.
Um,

999
00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:16.990
let's see.
Uh,
what I fault.
Any comedian who has a ghost writer,
uh,
yeah,

1000
00:59:16.991 --> 00:59:20.140
I don't look at them the same as a comic who actually wrote all of their own

1001
00:59:20.141 --> 00:59:24.160
material.
Absolutely.
Um,

1002
00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:28.000
there's people who write their own material and then they get a TV or a movie

1003
00:59:28.001 --> 00:59:31.900
career and they want to keep going out on the road.
Um,

1004
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:35.470
you know,
they don't have time to build up an act.

1005
00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:41.080
The smart thing to do is to go out and get a fucking writing staff.

1006
00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:45.280
And if that works for you,
that works for you personally.
Um,

1007
00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:50.340
I don't look at you the same way anymore because to me,

1008
00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.030
a comedian,

1009
00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:53.410
<v 0>okay.</v>

1010
00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:58.010
<v 1>A pure comedian is writing all their own jokes and um,</v>

1011
00:59:59.180 --> 00:59:59.750
<v 0>okay.</v>

1012
00:59:59.750 --> 01:00:00.391
<v 1>You know?
Yeah,</v>

1013
01:00:00.391 --> 01:00:02.760
there's people who do that and they have people that follow them around and they

1014
01:00:02.761 --> 01:00:07.560
sit in the back and they write down things that they say and uh,
you know,

1015
01:00:07.561 --> 01:00:12.120
it goes all the way from a,
you know,
the comedy version of getting,
you know,

1016
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:16.200
getting a little booster chair at the table all the way to the Karen,

1017
01:00:16.201 --> 01:00:19.800
you off the field like fucking Kellen Winslow,
you know,
it's one of those deals.

1018
01:00:19.801 --> 01:00:23.100
So I think it all depends on the level that you do it.

1019
01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:28.260
Um,
I mean I'm also speaking out of school here cause I've never done that.

1020
01:00:28.261 --> 01:00:33.261
So I don't know how much of the hour ends up being what somebody else wrote that

1021
01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:39.990
you then add your own spin on.
But uh,
you know,

1022
01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:46.470
I don't think I'm unique in that.
I,
that takes a little,
uh,

1023
01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:51.540
a little shine off the apple for me.
Why,
whatever the fucking expression is.

1024
01:00:51.541 --> 01:00:53.610
If I find out the person actually have writers,

1025
01:00:53.611 --> 01:00:57.240
cause then I'm sitting there going,
well how much is this your thought?

1026
01:00:57.241 --> 01:01:01.830
Or is this somebody else's thought and then that you paid for?
So yeah,
no,

1027
01:01:01.831 --> 01:01:05.580
but people definitely have them.
And having said all that,

1028
01:01:05.581 --> 01:01:07.410
I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing to do.

1029
01:01:07.411 --> 01:01:10.820
It's a smart thing to do because uh,
nowadays with the Internet,

1030
01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:13.290
how everything gets made and then nobody pays for it.

1031
01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.710
I mean going out on the road,
tap dancing for your fucking lunch.

1032
01:01:16.711 --> 01:01:18.000
I mean you got to have an act,
right?

1033
01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:23.340
All right advice a dear Billy Bob Burg.
Uh,

1034
01:01:23.341 --> 01:01:25.170
need some girl advice.

1035
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.550
I recently struck up conversation with a very attractive young lady

1036
01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.210
on the train the other day we talked for practically the whole 45 minute train

1037
01:01:36.211 --> 01:01:41.100
ride.
I'm 28,
but she was only 20.
Despite the age difference.

1038
01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.300
She was very cool.

1039
01:01:42.301 --> 01:01:46.170
And we talked about stand up comedy and how we are both fans of you.

1040
01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:51.350
All right,
so what are we talking about here?
This is weird.
We all send,

1041
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:53.980
you brought me into it.
Get Gag.
You get me out of there.
Well,

1042
01:01:53.981 --> 01:01:55.350
when my stop arrived,

1043
01:01:55.351 --> 01:01:59.160
I left without asking for her number because I didn't want to be that guy.

1044
01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:03.300
What guy?
The Guy who finds love,
the guy gets laid

1045
01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:07.560
either way.
You're that guy.
You were that guy.

1046
01:02:07.561 --> 01:02:11.610
You were that guy that didn't ask for a number.
So he goes,

1047
01:02:11.611 --> 01:02:14.340
now I'm regretting it.
She told me where she works.

1048
01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:15.820
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1049
01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.910
<v 1>A retail and I want to go there and ask her out.</v>

1050
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:21.920
So do you think it will come across creepy or sweet?

1051
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:26.570
If I just showed up for work on announced she might not even be working at the

1052
01:02:26.571 --> 01:02:31.100
time,
but I could leave my number with the coworker.
Do not do that.
Any advice?

1053
01:02:31.101 --> 01:02:35.240
Love the podcast.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Uh,
I,
you know,
it's not creepy at all.

1054
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.760
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1055
01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.530
<v 1>You come in here with a raincoat.
You don't want to make eye contact.
Yeah,</v>

1056
01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:44.410
go ahead.
Yeah,
that's going to be creepy.
We've come walking in and just be like,

1057
01:02:44.411 --> 01:02:47.320
listen,
it's been,
it's been bugging me.
I don't know if you remember me,

1058
01:02:47.321 --> 01:02:49.990
I met you on the bus,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Yeah,
yeah.
Whatever needs to do.
Listen,

1059
01:02:49.991 --> 01:02:54.190
it's been bugging me from the second I got off the bus that I didn't ask you for

1060
01:02:54.191 --> 01:02:56.290
your number.
I wanted to ask you for your number,

1061
01:02:56.291 --> 01:02:59.560
but I didn't want to come off like a creep.
Uh,
you know,

1062
01:02:59.561 --> 01:03:02.770
I'd love to take you out sometime.
Just very simple,
very honest.

1063
01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.393
<v 7>All right?</v>

1064
01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:07.460
<v 1>Don't be all fidgety and awkward,
you know,</v>

1065
01:03:07.461 --> 01:03:10.220
just fucking go in there and just state your case.

1066
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:12.173
<v 7>All right.</v>

1067
01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:17.270
<v 1>Now she's not working there.
Don't stand outside the place.
You know,</v>

1068
01:03:17.271 --> 01:03:20.030
fogging up the fucking windows waiting for to show up.

1069
01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.680
Just come walking in and just say is so and so here.
No.
Well,

1070
01:03:24.681 --> 01:03:25.700
when did she work again?

1071
01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:27.163
<v 7>Blah,
blah,
blah,</v>

1072
01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:31.360
<v 1>you know?
All right.
Oh,
cool.
All right,
thank you.
Whatever.
Who can I say?</v>

1073
01:03:31.361 --> 01:03:33.820
He's asking God the creepy guy from the bus.

1074
01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:38.140
<v 7>MMM.</v>

1075
01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.020
<v 1>Whatever.
Yeah,
I would just go about it that way,</v>

1076
01:03:42.021 --> 01:03:44.450
but absolutely do that and that whole fucking thing.
Hey,

1077
01:03:44.451 --> 01:03:46.970
I don't want to be that guy.
Be that guy.

1078
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:52.100
Be The guy that asks for what he wants.
Be respectful of other people,

1079
01:03:52.101 --> 01:03:56.900
but you gotta be the guy.
All right,
boy,
you got to be the lady.

1080
01:03:56.930 --> 01:04:01.550
Either way,
you gotta beat that fucking thought out of your head.

1081
01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:06.140
You can be so respectful and so like not wanting to rock the boat that you never

1082
01:04:06.141 --> 01:04:11.000
even fucking,
you know,
get what you want in life.
All right?

1083
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:14.930
Because life doesn't give a shit whether your dreams come true or not.
All right.

1084
01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.890
And a lot of the dreams that you have,
this isn't one of them,

1085
01:04:18.891 --> 01:04:20.510
but a lot of the dreams that you have,

1086
01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:24.500
like I always find it funny that people pray to a higher power,

1087
01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.540
oh please let me get this job.

1088
01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:28.700
Please let me Bababababa and all that type of shit.

1089
01:04:28.701 --> 01:04:30.680
The way this whole fucking world was set up,

1090
01:04:30.681 --> 01:04:34.790
if one person made it is if basically if you've got a roof over your head and

1091
01:04:34.791 --> 01:04:39.050
you're eating every day and you have drinking water,
your dream is fulfilled.

1092
01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.590
So to sit there and ask for a corner office of this person,

1093
01:04:42.591 --> 01:04:47.210
you're really just clogging up their phone lines.
Is that nuts?
I don't know.

1094
01:04:47.211 --> 01:04:51.560
That's how I look at it.
All right.
All in,
dear Billy,
brain fart.

1095
01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:56.150
Back in December,
2012 I was enlisted in the United States air force.

1096
01:04:56.690 --> 01:05:00.250
Off,
we go into the wild blue yonder

1097
01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.850
<v 6>flying into this guy and we dive in.</v>

1098
01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:10.150
<v 1>That's all I know because that's all they play in the movies,
right?
Better</v>

1099
01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:14.163
let's just a credit,

1100
01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:17.270
<v 7>eh,
Eh,
eh.</v>

1101
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:19.430
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1102
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:21.720
<v 1>You gotta do</v>

1103
01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:27.060
nothing can stop us.
Air Force.
How would a stronger air force,
yeah,

1104
01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:30.360
<v 6>I'll tell you right now.
They wanted to cheer up your chip.</v>

1105
01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:33.870
They feel like they're unstoppable and that's the kind of thing that ends up

1106
01:05:33.871 --> 01:05:35.790
getting you shot down out of the sky.

1107
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:43.070
<v 1>You have to feel the weak side pressure of the third world countries.
I mean,</v>

1108
01:05:43.071 --> 01:05:46.760
planes are disappearing.
Who's to say that these people don't have these things?

1109
01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:51.800
All right.
Um,
despite being engaged,
oh wait a second.

1110
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:56.570
I got engaged.
Oh yeah.
The guy joins the fucking air force.
All right.
He enlisted.

1111
01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.350
I got engaged to what I thought was the lady of my dreams.
Life was good.

1112
01:06:00.351 --> 01:06:00.891
Unfortunately,

1113
01:06:00.891 --> 01:06:04.370
I got stationed out of state and had to move despite being engaged.

1114
01:06:04.371 --> 01:06:07.850
She opted to stay behind and what was supposed to be temporary.

1115
01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:11.930
We managed to keep the spark alive for some time until she lost.

1116
01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:12.930
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1117
01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:17.910
<v 1>The engagement ring in April,
2013 all right,
let's stop right there.</v>

1118
01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:23.810
Guys are morons and a man can lose a fucking ring.

1119
01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:25.891
All right?

1120
01:06:25.891 --> 01:06:30.150
The only way a woman could lose a ring is if she's cleaning it near a sink.

1121
01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:35.860
Okay.
And she doesn't understand plumbing.

1122
01:06:35.861 --> 01:06:40.240
And then later turns on the water and sends it through the j trap.
All right.

1123
01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:46.050
<v 6>These kind of feel the weak side pressure on the j trap on fourth down</v>

1124
01:06:46.051 --> 01:06:48.080
situations.
Um,

1125
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:55.580
<v 1>what a woman loses a rating.
You gotta understand like this,</v>

1126
01:06:55.610 --> 01:06:59.020
that's so many of them.
That's the thing.
The ring,

1127
01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:03.680
they get the fucking sticking out of their fucking girlfriends noses.
Yeah.

1128
01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:08.380
Bed.
Yay.
Right?
They live for that.

1129
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:12.370
That's like you getting a game worn jersey.
All right.

1130
01:07:12.371 --> 01:07:15.370
So she lost a fucking engagement ring.
Wow.

1131
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:20.670
Eventually things spiraled out of control and she left me in June of 2013 saying

1132
01:07:22.301 --> 01:07:24.790
I deserved better.
All right.

1133
01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:29.820
Well that means either she doesn't love herself and uh,

1134
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:34.580
like when I sing that you deserve better.
What I would immediately think is such,

1135
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:37.210
if a woman ever said that to me that it's like,
all right,

1136
01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.470
you fucked around on me and how many times?
Uh,
anyways,

1137
01:07:41.471 --> 01:07:45.370
this put me in a huge state of depression to which I credit your podcast for

1138
01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:50.270
helping me out.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Um,
come to find out she back.
Oh,

1139
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:53.620
she banked for different guys from June to August.
There you go.

1140
01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.240
And those are just the ones she admitted to.
Okay.
That's like when you come home,

1141
01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:01.780
buzzed or drunk in high school and your parents go,
how many bears are your head?

1142
01:08:01.781 --> 01:08:06.640
How many,
what do you say to you're really shit face.
You'll save four.

1143
01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:10.520
And she said for,
so what does that mean?
She had a 12 pack.
A Dick?
Yeah.

1144
01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:12.750
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1145
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:16.600
<v 1>All right.
In August she came back into my life after she said she went,</v>

1146
01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:21.210
she too went through a depressant.
She was living even further away now,

1147
01:08:21.211 --> 01:08:24.450
but still wanted to try and make things work some type of way.

1148
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:29.570
Finally,
February of this year,
I got the chance we were waiting on,

1149
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.750
I went house hunting.
Ooh,
Jesus.
Dude,
what are you doing?

1150
01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:36.020
Where she lived in a to in attempt to make things right.

1151
01:08:36.021 --> 01:08:40.760
Come to find out she had been banging a married guy with kids and also talking

1152
01:08:40.761 --> 01:08:43.040
to someone else,
telling me,

1153
01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:48.950
wait and also talking to someone else while telling me she wanted me.

1154
01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.830
I confronted her and she basically said,

1155
01:08:51.831 --> 01:08:56.831
all I'll ever be to her is a fucking facetime friend.

1156
01:08:59.370 --> 01:09:03.840
What you confronted her and she said all and she said,

1157
01:09:03.841 --> 01:09:07.530
all I'll ever be to her is a fucking facetime friend.

1158
01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:12.550
A week ago she called me and now she wants to be friends again.

1159
01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:15.610
I love this girl.
That is your problem sir.

1160
01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.330
That is the only reason why you're writing me because everything you're saying,

1161
01:09:19.331 --> 01:09:22.300
this is a joke,
your decision.
He goes,

1162
01:09:22.301 --> 01:09:24.460
I love this girl very much despite what she's done to me.

1163
01:09:24.461 --> 01:09:29.170
Kind of like eating sugar.
It's good,
but it fucks you in the long run.

1164
01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.400
My question to you is,

1165
01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:35.350
do I throw all my chips in this time or do I fold and yes,

1166
01:09:35.351 --> 01:09:39.400
I'm probably an idiot either way.
Thanks for the laughs and go fuck yourself.

1167
01:09:39.401 --> 01:09:43.090
Ps do a show and Mississippi already.
Jesus Christ.
Bill,
that's on my bucket list.

1168
01:09:43.091 --> 01:09:46.930
I'm going to do one down there.
Um,
all right,
here's the deal,
dude.

1169
01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:52.170
This is the deal.
Your heart is clouding your brain right now.

1170
01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:54.480
All right?
And uh,

1171
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:59.510
here's a great expression that somebody said that their therapist told them one

1172
01:09:59.911 --> 01:10:04.320
time.
They said,
I don't let chaos live in my life.
All right,

1173
01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:07.640
this is the deal.
Okay.
Um,

1174
01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:13.940
she has come from some sort of unhealthy fucking background where she feels that

1175
01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:18.010
yeah,
she's got some sort of low self esteem thing.

1176
01:10:18.011 --> 01:10:20.740
I'm guessing she just thinks that she's a piece of shit and probably doesn't

1177
01:10:20.741 --> 01:10:22.000
deserve a great guy like you.

1178
01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:25.600
So she deliberately went out and sabotaged it probably because she's used to

1179
01:10:25.601 --> 01:10:27.730
being around a bunch of dysfunctional fucking people.

1180
01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:31.120
So when she actually found somebody outside of our wheelhouse,

1181
01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:35.410
she ran back to the see the comfort of that dysfunctional horse shit.

1182
01:10:35.890 --> 01:10:39.830
All right.
That is not your fucking problem.
Okay.

1183
01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:43.250
When you're trying to find the person that you supposed to fucking be with,

1184
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:48.230
you have to find somebody that is his right as rain.
All right?

1185
01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.320
That's why you asked the questions.
Are Your parents still together?

1186
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:53.960
What are your relationship like?
All the red flags,

1187
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:56.690
both for men and women listening to this thing.
Okay.

1188
01:10:56.691 --> 01:11:00.080
If they have issues with their fucking parents and they don't fucking speak to

1189
01:11:00.081 --> 01:11:03.590
them and they have a lot of anger issues towards their family,

1190
01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:07.280
fucking walk.
Walk.

1191
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:13.220
All right.
If you're young,
you're drafted in the first round,
okay?
Okay.

1192
01:11:13.221 --> 01:11:16.540
That's the Dez Bryant pic,
like fucking bill Belicheck.

1193
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:19.970
He passed on that one and everyone's like,
dude,
what are you talking about?

1194
01:11:19.971 --> 01:11:22.400
That's a fucking 10 and look at them.

1195
01:11:25.210 --> 01:11:28.630
Not saying the dude isn't a 10 not saying he's not a worldclass fucking athlete,

1196
01:11:28.631 --> 01:11:31.300
but all the,
the baggage that comes with that horse shit.

1197
01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:36.460
You got to look at it like that.
So well you need to do is,
you know,

1198
01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:38.170
all right,
you want to compare it to sugar.

1199
01:11:38.171 --> 01:11:42.160
You want to get over your sugar addiction.
Just go cold Turkey.
All right?

1200
01:11:42.161 --> 01:11:43.600
Six days fucking in.

1201
01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:44.940
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1202
01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:45.331
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1203
01:11:45.331 --> 01:11:48.120
You're going to start to turn and you're going to be looking at candy and cake

1204
01:11:48.121 --> 01:11:50.640
and pies going,
why the fuck would I ever eat that?

1205
01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:53.730
Because it's out of your system and that's how you're going to look at her.

1206
01:11:53.731 --> 01:11:57.940
Why the fuck would I ever eat that?
Yeah.
Do,

1207
01:11:57.941 --> 01:12:00.170
that's not the mother your kids man,
you know?
Yeah.

1208
01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:03.620
That right there is a Hank Williams song waiting to be written.

1209
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:07.460
If you marry her and you have kids with her.
All right?

1210
01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:09.180
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1211
01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:10.200
<v 1>I mean dude,
that,
that,</v>

1212
01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:14.080
that's the kind of woman that could turn you into a fucking alcoholic.
Uh,

1213
01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:15.180
you need to walk away.

1214
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:16.350
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1215
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:18.670
<v 1>All right.
And you know what?
You live in Mississippi,</v>

1216
01:12:18.671 --> 01:12:21.460
so you understood that fucking Hank Williams reference.
All right.

1217
01:12:22.090 --> 01:12:24.280
Walk away and uh,

1218
01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:27.400
and stay single for a while until you get that craving outta you.

1219
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:30.460
Cause it's not fair for you to get into another relationship with that shit

1220
01:12:30.461 --> 01:12:32.560
there and you probably want to build,
how do you know all this shit?

1221
01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:35.890
Because I'm a fucking piece of shit and I've done it.
I've been like,

1222
01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:38.230
all of these,
all of these questions,
I've been both people.

1223
01:12:38.231 --> 01:12:39.550
I've been the person that fucked around.

1224
01:12:39.551 --> 01:12:41.140
I'd been the person that got fucked around on,

1225
01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.890
I made horrible fucking decisions in all of that shit.
And it was,

1226
01:12:44.891 --> 01:12:48.970
it wasn't until I finally fucking decided to a,
you know,

1227
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:55.710
stop surrounding myself with fucking people that reminded me of people that I

1228
01:12:55.711 --> 01:12:56.544
grew up with.

1229
01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:57.840
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1230
01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:02.790
<v 1>And actually tried to create,
oh,
where did a culture in the locker room.</v>

1231
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:05.790
Um,
so that's what you need to do.

1232
01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.310
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1233
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:11.000
<v 1>You need to,
uh,
you need to draft character first.</v>

1234
01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:12.993
<v 11>All right?</v>

1235
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:19.830
<v 1>There's plenty of beautiful women that came from wonderful families and those</v>

1236
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.180
Dell,
that's the one that's the keeper.

1237
01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:23.873
<v 11>All right?</v>

1238
01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:28.820
<v 1>I know what the Shit,
okay.
A woman like this is fucking your brains out.</v>

1239
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:31.580
I know she is.
Okay.
And that's the sugar right there.
Okay.

1240
01:13:31.581 --> 01:13:32.960
So you got to let that go.

1241
01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:34.413
<v 11>All right,</v>

1242
01:13:35.470 --> 01:13:39.940
<v 1>here's the deal.
Next time you,
you're thinking about calling her rub one out.</v>

1243
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:45.050
I'm dead serious.
Fucking rub one out.
And the second you'd done,

1244
01:13:45.051 --> 01:13:49.190
I bet as your orgasm,
you're gonna this,
you're gonna be like,
ah,

1245
01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:52.610
thank God I didn't call her.
That's what's going to happen.
All right.

1246
01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:57.710
And remember that thought.
All right.
Single for a week.
Dear Billy,

1247
01:13:57.711 --> 01:14:01.370
buzz balls and the lovely knee,
if she's available,
she isn't,
unfortunately.

1248
01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:01.611
He goes,

1249
01:14:01.611 --> 01:14:06.611
I am 22 years old dating a 19 year old girl who goes to school an hour away.

1250
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.781
All right?
Uh,

1251
01:14:09.781 --> 01:14:14.660
we had been dating since her year and we've been able to maintain a very loving

1252
01:14:14.661 --> 01:14:18.740
relationship while maintaining our own independent lives outside of it.
Jesus.

1253
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:21.980
What could go wrong?
Um,

1254
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:24.260
before I decided to get serious with her,

1255
01:14:24.261 --> 01:14:28.700
I bow to remind myself that there may be a point where I have to let her go.

1256
01:14:28.701 --> 01:14:32.670
Considering the drastic changes that go on at Miss,
uh,

1257
01:14:32.690 --> 01:14:36.950
miss the college years.
If it works out with her,
I will be immensely happy.

1258
01:14:36.951 --> 01:14:41.240
But if she needs time to grow that I love her enough to be content with giving

1259
01:14:41.241 --> 01:14:42.110
her that time.

1260
01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:45.590
You said you're talking like you're her first serious relationship.

1261
01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:48.060
Recently she expressed a curiosity.

1262
01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:51.260
What would be like if she wasn't in a relationship in college?

1263
01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.710
And my mind immediately went to something that you said on a recent podcast

1264
01:14:54.711 --> 01:14:59.300
about the influential Dick's that girls need to suck in college.

1265
01:14:59.330 --> 01:15:02.660
I said that,
um,
I don't think I said that.

1266
01:15:02.661 --> 01:15:06.830
Did I say that anyways?
Although you'd be a shit poet.

1267
01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:10.760
I knew you were.
Well,
I knew what you were getting at.

1268
01:15:10.761 --> 01:15:15.440
So we decided that we'd take a week off and drop the maintenance of a long

1269
01:15:15.441 --> 01:15:15.861
distance.

1270
01:15:15.861 --> 01:15:19.550
One our relationships so she could experience for single self and college.

1271
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:23.900
We said no hooking up and she expressed that her intentions were not to get with

1272
01:15:23.901 --> 01:15:27.380
other dudes and I do actually believe her,
but you never know.

1273
01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:32.650
It was more about handling adversity at school without me and to uh,

1274
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:37.340
and to overall take a break from the long distance responsibilities.
Like I said,

1275
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:38.301
although it's hard,

1276
01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:42.110
I did emotionally prepare myself knowing that she may eventually change your

1277
01:15:42.111 --> 01:15:46.820
mind and need space.
I like Nias and your opinion on the idea of,
uh,

1278
01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:49.700
of the week break and overall situation.

1279
01:15:49.701 --> 01:15:54.020
Love the podcast and you fucking crushed it at the Chicago odd ball show and it

1280
01:15:54.021 --> 01:15:58.270
was a privilege to see your,
your act,
uh,
thanks again and go fuck yourself.
Well,

1281
01:15:58.271 --> 01:16:02.060
it's funny.
That's the fucking show I got shit about.
Um,

1282
01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:06.120
anyways.
Oh,
and by the way,
if you find that blogger,

1283
01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:10.270
do not write a bunch of negative shit like fuck you,
you fucking content.

1284
01:16:10.271 --> 01:16:13.390
Because all that does is just feed into what they're writing.
Okay.

1285
01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.580
If you want to look at it,
look at it.
But please,

1286
01:16:15.581 --> 01:16:19.330
because if I was to meet that person,
I would not talk to that person that way.

1287
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:22.210
I wouldn't,
I would listen to what they were saying.

1288
01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:26.800
I would state my case and that would be it.
Um,
all right,

1289
01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:32.560
here we go.
Um,
I don't think a week as long enough,
a long enough time.

1290
01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:34.270
The problem is when you get into a relationship,

1291
01:16:34.271 --> 01:16:38.590
this series at that young of age,
you know,
if you've been dating a year,

1292
01:16:38.591 --> 01:16:40.510
you met her when she was 18.
You met her as a freshman.

1293
01:16:40.511 --> 01:16:44.650
So she went from the first 18 years of her life of,

1294
01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:49.390
you know,
being in the nest with her parents.
She's finally out on her own,

1295
01:16:49.391 --> 01:16:53.350
and then she immediately gets into a relationship.
She doesn't know who she is,

1296
01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:59.030
you know what I mean?
Um,
so,

1297
01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:01.280
and I don't think you can do that in a week.

1298
01:17:01.890 --> 01:17:02.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1299
01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:06.130
<v 1>I don't,
I don't,
you know,
some people can do it,
only need a couple now.</v>

1300
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:06.861
Some people,
you know,

1301
01:17:06.861 --> 01:17:09.510
meet people in college and then they married their college sweetheart and that's

1302
01:17:09.511 --> 01:17:13.080
it.
They're fine with it and all that.
And other people,
you know.

1303
01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:14.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1304
01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:17.060
<v 1>Need to fucking make a bunch of mistakes through their twenties,</v>

1305
01:17:17.061 --> 01:17:21.110
thirties and into their forties
all the pens.

1306
01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:25.070
So,
um,
I think you guys are going to have to figure this out,

1307
01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:29.380
<v 2>but uh,
there is,
you know,</v>

1308
01:17:29.381 --> 01:17:34.381
that's an amazing time in your life when you move out and it's all of a sudden

1309
01:17:34.571 --> 01:17:37.600
like,
hey,
I can stay up as late as I want to.
Hey,
I can eat whatever I want to.

1310
01:17:37.601 --> 01:17:39.670
I can drink as much as I want to drink.

1311
01:17:39.671 --> 01:17:44.290
And then you have to learn how to be a parent to yourself to say,
hey,

1312
01:17:44.291 --> 01:17:47.620
fuck had it's time to go to bed.
Don't take this.
Like,
Hey,
you're driving,

1313
01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:51.250
don't drink and drive a dude.
You don't have a condom.

1314
01:17:52.090 --> 01:17:55.300
Or if you're a woman,
he doesn't have a condom.
No.

1315
01:17:56.450 --> 01:18:01.120
Walk away.
Like learning how to walk away is,
uh,
you know,

1316
01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:05.170
in those dumb situations can I mean that those are life altering fucking moments

1317
01:18:05.171 --> 01:18:09.340
because horrible,
horrible fucking things can happen.
Uh,

1318
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:14.080
in those moments in you need to,
I,

1319
01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:15.130
I'm not speaking for myself.

1320
01:18:15.131 --> 01:18:19.210
I feel like you need to learn those things and I don't think you can do that in

1321
01:18:19.211 --> 01:18:24.040
a week.
So,
uh,
I,
I would just have a serious conversation with her about that,

1322
01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:26.483
you know?

1323
01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:30.200
And it's hard for me to really give you a tell you exactly what to do because,

1324
01:18:30.201 --> 01:18:34.710
um,
my whole life experience is super imposed and informing everything that I'm

1325
01:18:34.711 --> 01:18:38.040
saying.
So I'm not you guys,
I didn't have your guys' upbringing.

1326
01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:40.590
There's a lot of people that marry their college sweethearts and they live

1327
01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:43.380
happily ever fucking after.
And,
uh,

1328
01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.850
and they don't have to go through all the fucking drama that I went through.
Um,

1329
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:52.910
so I think you guys need to have a conversation about it and honest conversation

1330
01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:59.100
and uh,
see where the chips fall and then fucking act on it.

1331
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.350
Um,
that's it.
Good Luck and God bless America.
Um,

1332
01:19:04.710 --> 01:19:07.560
anyways,
that is the uh,
oh fuck.
Did I even read the other?

1333
01:19:07.561 --> 01:19:10.620
I get to read the other advertising here and then maybe till another quick story

1334
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:13.400
<v 1>I just saying that I have another quick story to tell you.</v>

1335
01:19:13.401 --> 01:19:16.160
So you'll actually listen to this fucking advertising so I won't get shit.

1336
01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:20.600

Hey,
let's,
let's see.

1383
01:22:11.731 --> 01:22:14.400
You want to hear something funny cause I don't know shit about football anymore.

1384
01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:18.540
Not like I ever did.
Let's actually look at some of,
uh,

1385
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:24.030
let's go to nfl.com right now and let's look at week two and I'm going to make

1386
01:22:24.031 --> 01:22:26.370
some predictions.
And this is the thing,

1387
01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:30.570
I have no idea who won what,
although I will tell you,
uh,

1388
01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:36.020
Seattle look fucking unbelievable and I love that filthy Pete Carroll got busted

1389
01:22:39.181 --> 01:22:41.310
for whatever the fuck he was doing.
I thought he got busted him.

1390
01:22:41.311 --> 01:22:42.260
He just got busted for that.

1391
01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:46.550
He was having them practice like with pads on or full contact before he should

1392
01:22:46.551 --> 01:22:51.540
have.
Dude,
that guy,
you look,
I,
I've never been more wrong about somebody.

1393
01:22:52.230 --> 01:22:56.790
Then Pete Carroll maybe drew Bledsoe when we chose Tom Brady over drew Bledsoe

1394
01:22:56.791 --> 01:22:59.550
after we won our first one and we traded him to the buffalo bills.
I was like,

1395
01:22:59.551 --> 01:23:03.210
that guy's going to come back to haunt us.
I was wrong.
It never happened.

1396
01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:06.020
And Pete Carroll,
I was one of those going,
you know,

1397
01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:09.770
even after he was doing well at USC,
I was like,
dude,
you know,
we get heat.
Oh,

1398
01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:11.690
he's not a pro coach.
You know,

1399
01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:15.890
and I can say that having never coached a fucking pro and a fucking pop Warner

1400
01:23:15.891 --> 01:23:20.210
game,
uh,
that guy is psychotically driven and,

1401
01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.210
and I,
I,
you know,

1402
01:23:23.690 --> 01:23:28.690
those guys could win it again if he's going to fucking be that much of a maniac.

1403
01:23:31.650 --> 01:23:36.570
Did,
like he,
he making that move to me says three days after the Superbowl,

1404
01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.890
his wife was in the other room crying,

1405
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:41.770
<v 6>going,
are you ever going to be happy?</v>

1406
01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.200
<v 1>Right.</v>

1407
01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:49.200
He was already glazing over with x's and o's in front of his fucking ice.

1408
01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:54.820
Um,
I think it's great,
that level of commitment,

1409
01:23:54.850 --> 01:23:59.850
although I have to say the championship ring that they made for their own fans.

1410
01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:05.140
I mean it's just,
I can't,
the Deuce chills when you look at that.

1411
01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.960
Oh my God,

1412
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:12.990
the fucking ball washing and everybody is bought into how fucking loud they are.

1413
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:17.230
You could take Jackson,
Jill Jackson,
Jill Jackson,

1414
01:24:17.231 --> 01:24:21.400
Phil Jack and Jill Jackson,
Jacksonville Jaguar fans,

1415
01:24:21.401 --> 01:24:24.670
put them in Seattle Stadium and they would be just as loud.

1416
01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:28.630
I challenge every NFL fan to go to a game there,

1417
01:24:29.710 --> 01:24:32.470
stand in that crowd,
listen to how loud it is,

1418
01:24:32.471 --> 01:24:36.760
and then turn around and look at people cheering.
Just look at them.

1419
01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:41.560
Then add up.
They're like,
like fuck of these crazy.
They just cheering

1420
01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:46.410
what they own or did was brilliant because it wasn't illegal.

1421
01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:50.460
And I think that every other owner is going to do it around the NFL unless they

1422
01:24:50.461 --> 01:24:54.000
do something about that stadium,
which,
what are you going to do about it?

1423
01:24:54.001 --> 01:24:56.710
It's already fucking built.
Um,

1424
01:24:57.870 --> 01:25:01.230
that he just was brilliant.
He's like,
contain this fucking noise in,

1425
01:25:01.231 --> 01:25:05.460
reign it back down on the field.
You know,
I'm not saying they're not great fans,

1426
01:25:05.461 --> 01:25:09.960
but Jesus Christ,
could you pat yourselves on the back anymore?
Oh,

1427
01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:10.951
I know.

1428
01:25:10.951 --> 01:25:13.920
And I keep doing this and I get total respect for Pete Carroll and your football

1429
01:25:13.921 --> 01:25:18.060
program up there.
Obviously a program,
a franchise up there.
I think you guys,

1430
01:25:18.061 --> 01:25:21.840
I mean,
I dunno,
it's obviously the little football that I watched.

1431
01:25:21.841 --> 01:25:26.610
It seems once again that uh,
it's a no brainer that the

1432
01:25:27.330 --> 01:25:27.750
<v 3>okay.</v>

1433
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:32.030
<v 1>The super bowl champion at once again,
it's coming out of the NFC and uh,</v>

1434
01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:36.740
<v 6>Tehran.
Yo La.
I'm a football fan.
I got to be looking into that first batch up.
Oh,</v>

1435
01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:41.750
the Seattle Seahawks against those San Francisco 40 niners Kenya 40 niners get

1436
01:25:43.031 --> 01:25:45.700
over the hump.
I mean this is the question.

1437
01:25:45.850 --> 01:25:49.510
I mean there's rumors that Jim Harbaugh is losing the locker room.

1438
01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:51.600
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1439
01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:55.830
<v 1>How can you sit and watch that?
Um,
anyways.</v>

1440
01:25:56.130 --> 01:25:59.260
Um,
all right,
let's get to,

1441
01:25:59.330 --> 01:26:03.000
let's get to the week two to schedule for next week.
Let's see if he can find

1442
01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:08.490
<v 2>what the fuck schedules.
All right.</v>

1443
01:26:08.491 --> 01:26:12.630
Standing stats with the fuck is week to matchups.

1444
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:19.040
Ah,
you know what I,
these is,
you know,
can you make it easy for a fucking old guy?

1445
01:26:19.041 --> 01:26:22.250
Scouting,
combine,
draft play off play off

1446
01:26:24.650 --> 01:26:28.160
team's schedule.
Oh,
regular season schedule right there.
Okay,
here we go.

1447
01:26:28.161 --> 01:26:32.300
Here we go.
Week two.
What Buddha,

1448
01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:36.830
Buddha did the due to all the giants played alliance tonight in Detroit.

1449
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:39.290
I have no idea who's going to win that.

1450
01:26:39.291 --> 01:26:41.510
I don't understand why everybody's questioning Eli Manning.

1451
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:44.660
How many fucking Superbowls does a guy get a when all of a sudden he doesn't

1452
01:26:44.661 --> 01:26:48.320
know how to play the position anymore?
Fucking New York media.
That's the problem.

1453
01:26:48.321 --> 01:26:50.240
When you get 15 papers all in one town,

1454
01:26:50.241 --> 01:26:52.460
they always gotta be constantly stirring up shit.

1455
01:26:53.150 --> 01:26:56.240
Not that they don't do it in Boston.
Believe me.
I know they do.
Um,
all right,

1456
01:26:56.241 --> 01:26:57.074
here we go.

1457
01:26:57.940 --> 01:26:58.330
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1458
01:26:58.330 --> 01:27:00.460
<v 2>this is all week one stuff.
Where's week tow?</v>

1459
01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:08.990
The fuck is it?
I don't know,
Bill,
why don't you just yell at your computer,

1460
01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.450
Texas sized triumph.
This is,
this is why.

1461
01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:18.090
This is why I need a fucking assist.

1462
01:27:18.091 --> 01:27:21.300
I gotta do something here because this should not be this difficult.

1463
01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.120
September 4th through the ninth

1464
01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.680
<v 3>okay.</v>

1465
01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:30.490
<v 2>Complete wheat one schedule.
Where the fuck is the week to schedule your cunts?</v>

1466
01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:33.950
Can I scroll this way?

1467
01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:35.690
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1468
01:27:35.690 --> 01:27:39.020
<v 2>this is bad.
This is really,
this is awful.</v>

1469
01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:44.680
No.
Is this it right here?
No,
that isn't it.
All right.

1470
01:27:44.681 --> 01:27:47.940
I'm not going to torture you guys anymore.
Jesus fucking Christ.
I can.

1471
01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:50.110
I know what you didn't want to hear my pics anyways.

1472
01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.380
You didn't wanna hear my pics anyways.
Don't tell you in new ways.

1473
01:27:53.381 --> 01:27:54.280
I can tell you follow it.
You know what?

1474
01:27:54.281 --> 01:27:59.281
I'll give you my predictions for week to week to pregame football analysis and

1475
01:28:01.091 --> 01:28:06.091
now often new England where a shark legally last week they lost the size of Lee.

1476
01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:12.520
So these Miami Dolphins of the dolphin,
Miami County,
Dane Wade,

1477
01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:16.330
fucking area cub,
I'll tell you right now,
I mean,

1478
01:28:16.331 --> 01:28:19.450
what do you think's going to happen when they come in and they play the a the

1479
01:28:19.451 --> 01:28:22.690
fucking the fucking Austin city.

1480
01:28:22.691 --> 01:28:24.220
I should topes what do you think's going to happen?

1481
01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:27.460
<v 6>Well,
I'll tell you right now.
Oh,
you know what I mean?
You'll be,
look,</v>

1482
01:28:27.490 --> 01:28:31.390
we all know with Tom Brady could do,
we all know bill Bella check is a genius,

1483
01:28:31.391 --> 01:28:32.730
but I'll tell you right now,
I mean,

1484
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:35.770
I mean you did talent or no child and I mean you gotta be,

1485
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:38.200
you gotta be concerned about that second half.
I mean,

1486
01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.760
<v 2>south Southtech it's gotta be a lot of that shit.</v>

1487
01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:44.040
<v 6>I mean,
if they lose today,</v>

1488
01:28:44.041 --> 01:28:47.340
they're all went to the first time in the Brady bill checker

1489
01:28:48.570 --> 01:28:53.570
<v 2>like I to be doing that for a fucking hour,</v>

1490
01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:56.840
not for an hour.
They'll do it for a little bit and then they're gonna.
Uh,

1491
01:28:58.050 --> 01:29:01.020
I dunno what the fuck else they going to talk about.
I see the world through my,

1492
01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:02.040
and I know that they're

1493
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.090
<v 1>going to be doing that shit.</v>

1494
01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.420
Or you can just skip all of that and you can go fucking work out at the gym,

1495
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:08.743
<v 11>right?</v>

1496
01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:13.850
<v 1>Go for a hike with your fucking dog or some shit and he can come back.</v>

1497
01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:18.920
The wonderful world of fucking Dvi,
you can come back an hour before the game,

1498
01:29:19.190 --> 01:29:22.940
after the game started.
He ain't just plow through all the fucking halftime,

1499
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:27.590
everything and just get right to the third corner,
right?

1500
01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:31.310
Let your wife watched the real housewives during the first half,

1501
01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:33.423
<v 11>you know,</v>

1502
01:29:34.230 --> 01:29:37.280
<v 1>and you just make,
before you go out to the gym,
he just say,

1503
01:29:37.290 --> 01:29:40.810
you grab by a handful of hair,
the back of her head fellowship.

1504
01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:45.270
If new [inaudible] shut off the recording.
I swear to God,

1505
01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.930
I'm going to have you live under the coffee table.
Not Joking.

1506
01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:54.490

01:30:09.661 --> 01:30:13.030
If been gradually improving throughout the years.
But do this.

1512
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:19.440
I have no idea.
I have no idea.

1513
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:24.540
For some reason I'm going to just,
you know what?
I bet against me.

1514
01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:29.220
