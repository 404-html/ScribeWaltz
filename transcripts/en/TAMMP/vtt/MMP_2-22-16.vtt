00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.050
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03.051 --> 00:00:05.850
It's Bill Byrd is time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.810
February 22nd,
2016 what's going on?

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.110
How I,
how's it going?

5
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:18.111
Happy Monday to enrich and every one of you I was going to say to every one of

6
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:22.230
you,
then I decided to throw in each.
So that's why the each sounded weird.

7
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:25.590
They're just election now.
Um,

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.580
it's another beautiful day out here in Los Angeles,
uh,

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.330
getting ready to go out to fox woods.
Um,
this,
uh,

10
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.610
this weekend,
right?
Yeah.

11
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:40.611
Friday I'll be in New York City and then a Saturday and Sunday I'm going to be

12
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:45.510
at Foxwoods and um,
it's going to be hopefully going to be a good time.

13
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.660
I'm going to do a bunch of standup this week so I'm not rusty old freckles.

14
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:50.430
Can't be walking in there rusty.

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.900
And I'm definitely looking forward to getting back there,

16
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:58.860
although I heard it's fucking freezing.
Um,
but whatever,
you know,

17
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.660
I could visit winter.

18
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.160
I'm a big fucking southern California softy now.

19
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.470
They get there,
my teeth chatter and when it gets in the forties,

20
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.370
it's actually not true.
And that shit too,
where they go,
your blood thins out,

21
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
your know your blood thirds out.
Then you go back,
you can't handle the cold.

22
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.010
It's like,
no,
that's not what happens.
You,
you're,

23
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:25.011
you have access to information in a beautiful life that you could be living

24
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.820
still within the parameters of this great country.
You know,

25
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.210
all you people back this shoveling,
that wet snob,
just letting you need,

26
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.660
you don't have to do it.
You know,

27
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.070
I took my dog out this morning do about,
oh,
do you know what I had on?

28
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.580
I had on a wind break

29
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.010
just walking down the street.
I could sit on my back porch in the sun right now.

30
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.410
Okay.
And burn another couple of cancer causing freckles into the top of my head.

31
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.600
Well,
I had a little bit of corn flakes,
you know,

32
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:01.170
sitting out there like the Douche in the goal.
Great nut commercials.

33
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.880
Zoe's some guy,
right?
He come out,
it was like he was a man's man,

34
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:09.900
but a pretty boy.
You know,
like Tom Brady,
except he couldn't throw a football,

35
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.680
that guy.
Right?
And he'd come out with the,
the impossible.

36
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:15.480
Impossibly white robe,

37
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.960
brand new white robe.
They even fucking bleed suit,
right.
The widest shit ever.

38
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.680
And He,
you know,
he's got a little fucking bullet grape nuts.

39
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.620
Always had some fruit in there cause he had that kind of time.

40
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.200
Sky was so successful.

41
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.840
He had the time to cut up fruit and do is fucking great nuts.

42
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.510
He'd go out on his back porch and just chill.
I remember as a,
as a little boy,

43
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.480
as a little orange headed fucking freckled pussy.

44
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:44.820
I remember watching that just go and like that guy say,

45
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.330
guys live in a life looking at,
look how,
look how white that robust,

46
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.680
it's got fruit in his fucking grape nuts.
This guy's crushing it.

47
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.700
Is He fucking come on,
I want to,
I want to see the rest of his life.

48
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.860
Let me see as loud.

49
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.020
And that was the genius of that commercial.
They never showed his Brian.

50
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.570
I don't think they did.
Maybe she came out afterwards.
You know,
I don't think so.

51
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.680
But that's the genius of it.

52
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:11.710
It left you wanting more and you started thinking about his life and he started

53
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:14.440
thinking,
you know what,
you don't Vice Dodi Greg much.

54
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:17.290
Maybe I'll have an impossibly white robe and I'll come out and I'll actually

55
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:18.910
have pigment my skin,
you know,

56
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.230
nice full head of hair and I'll walk out on my deck barefoot,
you know,

57
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.150
look,
I like,
I got all the money in the world,
I got all the answers,
confidence,

58
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.590
hell and I even have time to cut up fruit,
my cereal.
I want that life,

59
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.730
you know?
And here it is years later to this day,
you know,

60
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.690
I'm still eating great much.
Sure.

61
00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:46.200
I never got the pigment bay.
I lost the hair,

62
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.660
had some structural damage to my house shell,

63
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.910
but I have tried to cut up some fruit.

64
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.750
I'm sorry.
Anyways,
yeah,

65
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.450
so your blood doesn't fit out.

66
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.143
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

67
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.140
<v 0>it doesn't then out.</v>

68
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.150
You just know what it's like to experience an 85 degree day in fucking February

69
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.320
and then you go back,
you just like what the,
you know what it's like.

70
00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:18.080
It's like you ever see a rich person have to stand in line.

71
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.170
It's the combination of frustration and confusion.

72
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.370
It's more confusion and frustration.
It's more like,
wait,
I,
I don't wait.

73
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.000
I got money.
Like okay here,
who wants this?

74
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.940
Who do I give this to so I can go around this.

75
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.940
I don't want to be with these animals.

76
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.720
These are the people that make my dreams come true.
They show up at my factory.

77
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.460
All right.
They put the fucking,
the nut and bolt and the widget

78
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.290
that I bought off of somebody else,
they came in with the design.

79
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.660
They didn't have any money.
I made him sign a piece of paper.

80
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.670
I on the patent to their idea.
I go around all this,

81
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.520
right,
rich guy thoughts and the ditches,
that confusion.
It's like w w,
w why am I,

82
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.630
I don't do this anymore.

83
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.320
That's what West Coast people who've lived on the east coast.

84
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:12.460
Then when they go back east,

85
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.040
you know what we paratroop into fucking winner.
That's,

86
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.120
that's what would think like I don't do this anymore.

87
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.540
He's chap faced fucking animals back here.

88
00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:27.890
I'm a fucking doing the shoveling wet snow,
stretching out your back,

89
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.280
you know,
all excited cause you got a new snow blower,

90
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.810
you know that's your winner.
That's for you.
I go around that man.

91
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:42.580
I don't do that shit.
I'm out of my back porch.
Yeah,
basketball be too great much.

92
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.950
It's how I'm doing it.
Do My fucking dog is laying on his bed right now.
Okay.

93
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:49.420
It's like from the neck down,

94
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:54.421
it's on the bed and then like it's head is hanging off of the bed onto the

95
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:56.320
hardwood floor.

96
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.130
I mean it looks literally like it got hit by a tranquilizer.
All right.

97
00:06:02.131 --> 00:06:03.900
And you know what I did with what?
The dog today.

98
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.070
This is why she's so exhausted after at least 11 hours sleep last night.

99
00:06:08.071 --> 00:06:12.420
The fucking thing goes to bed at like seven at night.
It's hilarious.

100
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.270
Like whenever I'm watching the game and I'm just sitting there,

101
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.100
she's like over in the corner,
just curled up in a ball,

102
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.890
sound asleep.
Okay.
Which is why now for,
I can't get her off this clock here.

103
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.720
She keeps,
I don't know how to keep her up,
you know,

104
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.260
cause she keeps waking me up at like five 30 quarter to six in the morning.

105
00:06:31.261 --> 00:06:36.080
It's driving me nuts.
So anyways,
so now after 11 hours of sleeping,
I,

106
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.020
all I did was I took it around the block,
that city she looks at,

107
00:06:40.021 --> 00:06:44.480
she ran a marathon.
I don't fucking know.

108
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.020
I don't understand why they're so goddamn sleepy all the time.
I've never,
I mean,

109
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:49.250
I've had dogs my whole life.

110
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:52.010
I've never seen a dog sleep the way this fucking thing sleeps.

111
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.580
Then it gets up at five 30 in the morning,
like a goddamn drill sergeant.

112
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:56.810
The only thing it's missing is,
you know,

113
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.250
remembered full metal jacket when the guy came walking in and he was beating the

114
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:03.170
Billy club against the empty trashcan.

115
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:05.720
That's basically what she does to me every morning,

116
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.340
except it's way more adorable.

117
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.030
I'll be like sound asleep and then I'm walking up to a cold nose doing that dead

118
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:19.130
fucking psycho way.
They sniff it does,

119
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:23.690
that shit is fucking her paintbrush.

120
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.010
Tunc and I'm like Blah.

121
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.890
That's how I wake up every morning and I'm one of those people,

122
00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:30.820
once you wake me up,
it's fucking over.
All right.
Just just to let you know,

123
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:34.100
kiss you ever sleeping next to me,
you know,
keep it quiet.

124
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.670
Um,
all right,
let's move on.
Um,

125
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.780
as I mentioned on the Thursday afternoon podcast just before Friday,

126
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.500
um,
other,
I was going to the,
uh,
the warriors game.
Um,

127
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.430
I was going to the warriors

128
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.760
game and I was taking the lovely Nia and uh,

129
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.690
cause I wanted to go see Steph curry in his prime.
You know,

130
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.310
you got to see them when they're young for they get the first major injury or

131
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:10.120
before they just get old and remind you that you're going to die someday.

132
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.300
You know,
you don't need to see that.
But doing that,
you know,

133
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:18.440
I saw Michael Jordan back when he had hair.
I see him early.
All right.

134
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:22.300
When he was still skinny and the Pistons were beating the shit out of him and he

135
00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:25.490
was dropping 60 on the Celtics,
I saw him then.
He was probably,

136
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:27.470
I saw him when he was,
they would probably,

137
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.913
<v 1>okay.</v>

138
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.090
<v 0>I think it was right before the Jordan three s came out.</v>

139
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:34.760
It was probably the second pair,
by the way,
for the record,

140
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:37.100
when the first air of Air Jordans came on,

141
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:39.800
I thought they were the ugliest fucking things I'd ever seen in the,

142
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:42.650
in the red and black bulls colors.

143
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.220
I thought they were the ugliest fucking things I'd ever seen it by the way,

144
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:46.911
Celtics fans,

145
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:49.730
how much more likable is pog or Saul now that he's not on the Lakers.

146
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:50.564
I don't know what it is.

147
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.260
My hatred of the Lakers really just maybe hate that guy way more than I needed

148
00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:59.850
to.
Um,
anyway,
so we go down to the game and um,
um,

149
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.190
yeah,
like ridiculous,
excited.

150
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:06.630
Like I'm seeing one of the great NBA teams of all time and I'm seeing arguably

151
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:09.330
the greatest shooter this early in his career.

152
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:10.860
You can actually make that argument.
This is,

153
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:15.861
this guy's the greatest shooter in Nba History and in my lifetime I've watched

154
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:19.650
Andrew,
Tony,
Larry Legend,
Reggie Miller,

155
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.470
and I even throw Coby Brian in there.

156
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.060
I never saw a guy have two people hanging on them out by the three point line

157
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:30.550
and just with his back to the fucking hope and he's still somehow gets it.

158
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.463
You know,

159
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.530
God knows he's not looking for the open man trying to beat the double team.

160
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:39.300
Why would you do that
anyways,

161
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.430
so I go there,
I get on stub hub,
right?

162
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.690
I fucking paid through the nose.
You know what I mean?
Fuck it.

163
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:54.420
Pay through the nose.
I get a six row behind,
uh,

164
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.420
not behind the bench but almost behind the warriors bench,

165
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.480
but whatever the fucking table,
what are the announcers are in?
Shit,
I'm,

166
00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:03.780
I'm like somewhere in there,
six rows back.

167
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:08.760
And one of the great things is when you go to an NBA game is like if you six

168
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:13.500
rows deep,
you can like literally hear them calling for the ball.
You know,

169
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:19.200
if like if the coach curse Steve Curve,
he fucking cursed at the ref.
Like,
Oh,

170
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:22.830
what the fuck?
And he gets teed up.
I know what he said.
All right.

171
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:27.600
That's what I paid for.
That's why I went on stubhub and I said,

172
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:29.550
fuck it.
Huh?

173
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.480
You want to wheel Barb barrel full of cash?
Here you go.

174
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.890
I'm not fucking sitting all the way.
The staples center is the fucking worst.
You,

175
00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:41.891
you got to sit down low or else it's like they got this brownstone of a

176
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.700
corporate boxes,
three deckers,
three,

177
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:50.390
three fucking levels of them all the way around.

178
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.910
It's like a moat between the fucking haves and the have nots.

179
00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:57.750
And then all the real fans,
they're up by the fucking air condition ducts.

180
00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.820
So it's like,
that's what the option is.

181
00:10:59.821 --> 00:11:02.310
Either way the fuck up their pay through the nose.
So I said,
fuck it.

182
00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:06.090
I'm going to pay through the nose,
right?
So,
and I'm going to get there.

183
00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:07.560
I'm going to hear him talk and I'm gonna Watch them.

184
00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:10.410
One of the great shooters of all fucking time.
And I get that dude.

185
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:14.250
And I know during all of this,
I'm going to sound like a grumpy old man,

186
00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:18.690
but what the fuck happened to,
to,
to go into an NBA game?

187
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.850
Two,
they didn't.

188
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.880
There wasn't one moment of silence the entire fucking,

189
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.320
they even play music when the fucking games going on.

190
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.910
I didn't hear one sneaker squeak.
I heard a couple of yo the call for the ball.

191
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:33.390
That was it.

192
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:38.040
I heard nothing because the entire fucking time that game's going on some

193
00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:42.150
fucking Douche.
She's playing everybody clap your hedge,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick.

194
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:45.630
The whole,
they played that fucking 50 fucking types.

195
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.680
First of all,
I walked into the fucking building,
right?
And I'm all excited.

196
00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:52.620
Where's my seats?
I paid through the nose.
Here we go,
right?

197
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.530
It's like you go on vacation and use all your fucking miles was sitting up on

198
00:11:56.531 --> 00:12:00.390
the front of the play.
You can't fucking wait to get on a plane.

199
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.160
Where's my big comfy fucking seek that I fucking pay for,
right?

200
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:11.090
That's the level of excitement I had and I go in there and I'm coming down to

201
00:12:11.191 --> 00:12:14.520
the seats and first of all,
there's some DJ guy.

202
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.990
There's always a fucking Dj.
You can't even buy a pair of fucking pants.

203
00:12:18.991 --> 00:12:20.220
Now you walk into a store,

204
00:12:20.221 --> 00:12:24.080
there's a fucking some sad look at DJ there just shouldn't now you know with his

205
00:12:24.081 --> 00:12:29.010
bad posture,
you know some hack Dj just fucking play in music.

206
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.900
I love to with like curse words in it too.

207
00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:33.930
Like you were in like a place of business,
you know,

208
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.660
cause I'm fucking you to not right.

209
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.590
The plane like Biggie and shit.
Right.
So,
um,
anyways,

210
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.600
this is fucking Dj.

211
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

212
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.830
<v 0>And he's,
I don't know what the fuck he's doing.</v>

213
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

214
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.360
<v 2>Every five seconds make so no</v>

215
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.780
people at section 300 ready do go to Ebay.

216
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.000
<v 0>Damn hasn't even started,
but the fuck are we cheering?</v>

217
00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.380
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

218
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.180
<v 0>Huh?
Are you getting this hype for the game?
You fucking dope.
We're borrowing is.</v>

219
00:13:12.181 --> 00:13:15.370
See the clippers and the warriors.
The words got five losses.

220
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.300
This is like watching the 96 bowls,
the tear that they're on.

221
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.340
I don't need you and your Richie Cunningham Varsity fucking clippers jacket out

222
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:28.570
there screaming and fucking yelling.
Oh,
it gets worse.

223
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.700
I might blow a fucking buy them an aneurysm on this one.
So I'm walking down,

224
00:13:33.701 --> 00:13:36.760
gone.
Oh my God.
How long has this guy got to be yelling at us?

225
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

226
00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.880
<v 0>And meanwhile,
meanwhile,
by the way,
meanwhile,</v>

227
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.640
you know the clippers are out shooting around and the worries about ready to

228
00:13:43.641 --> 00:13:44.210
take the court,

229
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.960
I'm going to get to watch Steph curry fucking hit like 18 three point in a rump.

230
00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.010
You know,
that's what I want to see.
That's what I want to hear.
Okay.

231
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.720
I know need back.
So I don't need that shit.
Right.
But you know,
it's a new day.

232
00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.470
It's a new generation.
Their time.
I'm just a grumpy old man,
right?

233
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:06.550
So I get down on my sheet that I paid through the fucking nose for right on the

234
00:14:07.371 --> 00:14:09.680
fucking I'll,
and that what looks to be,

235
00:14:09.681 --> 00:14:13.340
it looks like Steph Curry's mouth guard that he's constantly fucking chewing on,

236
00:14:13.341 --> 00:14:17.870
right?
And it's like this bracelet and I didn't know what it was.

237
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.320
It looked like a fucking,
it looked like a one of those things.

238
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.860
They stick in the bottom of a men's urinal,
right?
Urinal cake.

239
00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.470
Except he gets sticky a fucking,
you can put it on your wrist.

240
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.200
So it's taped to the back of my seat.

241
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:34.010
So I immediately just flipped the fucking thing over the other side of my seat.

242
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.640
Okay.
Immediately I'm not participating.
All right.

243
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.660
Total contrarian.
Canty fucking standup loaner comic.

244
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.010
I'm not being part of the group immediately.
Right.
And I'll take that.

245
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:51.400
I'll take 40% of the blame or the rest of this fucking wine and shit.

246
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.080
All right.
But the other 60% I'm fucking right.
So I fucking flip that thing over.

247
00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.460
And the fucking Dj guy with the Richie Cunningham varsity clippers jacket is

248
00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:05.260
down there and he's,
he's like,
everybody hold up you fucking a yard.
Okay.

249
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.640
And when you hold it up,
don't forget dog back.

250
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.610
So everybody clap your hands.
Tech Tech,

251
00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:16.570
tech tech to do this is all going on,
right?
Insanity.
Oh,
and by the way,

252
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.340
there's a bunch of fucking,
you know,

253
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:19.620
<v 1>okay.</v>

254
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:24.550
<v 0>Like I swear to God what's said,
who's that fucking guy who does the,</v>

255
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.630
he sells the nice comfortable tee shirts,

256
00:15:27.631 --> 00:15:31.560
but for some reason he shoots like 12 year old girls and like sexual positions.

257
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.960
The fuck is the name of that company.
It's not an Abercrombie and Fitch.

258
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.640
They were into like fucking,
wasn't it like a white supremacists,

259
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.590
Kennedy children?
I can't,
I,
you know,
they,
it all blends together.

260
00:15:43.591 --> 00:15:46.980
It begins with an egg.
That's all I know.
So they got these fucking like preteens,

261
00:15:46.981 --> 00:15:48.660
it looks like calm it down,

262
00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:51.443
<v 1>you know,</v>

263
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.640
<v 0>dress like prostitutes and fucking like a a B Hollywood movie.
Right.</v>

264
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.750
You know,
like the ones in a pretty woman.
Yeah.

265
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.710
The only exciting part of that was when he was looking for a hooker and then he

266
00:16:04.711 --> 00:16:09.390
runs into that fucking,
you know,
molar show and fucking champ there.
Right.

267
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.900
I always hate it when he fucking closed it shut.

268
00:16:12.901 --> 00:16:17.370
She goes fucking laugh at all those fucking teeth.
Jesus Christ.

269
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.630
Uh,
I swear to God,

270
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.880
that clip right there is why I never dropped acid.

271
00:16:23.881 --> 00:16:27.170
Cause if I ever ran into a woman like that,
and she did the,
I swear to God,
I've,

272
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.040
I don't know what happened.
I think my fucking head would explode.
So anyways,

273
00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.810
Geez,
I haven't got to the start of the fucking game yet.

274
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.850
So much is fucking bugged me.
So dare doing dance routines,

275
00:16:41.851 --> 00:16:43.170
all the shit.
So in the meantime,

276
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.200
the fucking warriors take the court and everybody bows him and everything,

277
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.200
and I'm just literally going like,
oh my God,
there he is.
There he goes,

278
00:16:49.201 --> 00:16:50.850
here he goes,
and he starts hitting fucking threes.

279
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:56.300
And the second he does every fucking jerk off and the fucking building,

280
00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.550
right?
Who was it making?

281
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.800
So this came running down the fucking aisle.

282
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:06.750
Everybody with their cell phone cameras out taking fucking video standing up in

283
00:17:06.751 --> 00:17:08.910
front of me.
Here I am paying through the nose to my seat.

284
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.060
I have them in the six row.
I got to stand up to watch the shoot around.

285
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.720
What are you filming it for?
The fuck are you filming?

286
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

287
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.820
<v 0>Can't you just fucking just sit there and watch it?</v>

288
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.540
I saw Larry Bird do a shoot around 1986 I still remember I got the video right

289
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:30.170
in my fucking head.
Just fucking dope.

290
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.560
All these fucking Yolo Douche.
She's come down right with their fucking phones.

291
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.680
So I'm just going,
Oh God,
here we go.
You know bill pay.

292
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:42.050
You know you're the old guy.
Now this is,
this is how the youngster do it.

293
00:17:42.051 --> 00:17:45.470
This is how they fucking do it,
right?
So Mercer,
fleets,

294
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.910
people finally ended up sitting down.

295
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.250
It's the end of the goddamn shoot around and we're get ready to start the game,

296
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:55.230
right?
And I'm thinking like,
okay,
finally this fucking this,
this,

297
00:17:55.231 --> 00:18:00.231
this seizure of shit of tumblers and who cheese it fucking screaming and yelling

298
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.530
and making noise and,
and bracelets.

299
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.280
Fucking blinking is going to end and I can watch the fucking game,
right?

300
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:12.600
There's no way this horse shit goes on
during the game.

301
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.740
There's no fucking way.
And evidently it's okay that they play music too.

302
00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:17.574
The whole fucking thing.

303
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.810
I'm watching Steph curry bringing the ball up and I'm listening to Drake.

304
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.100
You'll use the Colby all myself off.
Gilgo dog yogurt though.

305
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.000
Everybody clap your hands back so fucking,

306
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.500
I can barely get to speak of squeaking,
dude.

307
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.690
The NBA used to be the greatest fucking game.

308
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.400
If you sat down low to see the game live,
there's,
there's no,

309
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.090
there's not like hockey where you behind the fucking glass,
you know,

310
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:46.410
it's almost like it's soundproof.

311
00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:48.450
And even that's still amazing to be down that close.

312
00:18:48.451 --> 00:18:50.100
But still there's like this barrier.

313
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.930
You fucking sit right down on the court and they're right there.

314
00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:59.550
The fucking ball could bounce into your lap was insane.
And,
and you know,
look,

315
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.410
like I said,
I'll take 40% of this.
This is just me being a grumpy old man.

316
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.070
Okay?
You got to keep,
the game has to keep evolving.

317
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.620
These kids are growing up with Dj's.

318
00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.070
People are asking them to make noise and they like to make noise.

319
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.760
This is what they're fucking generation does it fine,
fine,
but can,

320
00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:19.650
can you just dial it back a little bit?

321
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

322
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:22.730
<v 0>Every time there was a time out,</v>

323
00:19:22.731 --> 00:19:26.960
all of a sudden there was all these fucking people run up it,
by the way,

324
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.050
the kids out there to have a kid dance team.

325
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.740
Can you have him do a fucking kid dance?
You know what I mean?

326
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.500
Jesus fucking Christ.

327
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.250
Half those fucking moves I've seen in a Teddy Barr and I'm a fucking looking at

328
00:19:43.251 --> 00:19:44.084
an eight year off dude.

329
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

330
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.190
<v 0>Everybody clap your hands into the whole fucking thing was insane.
And,
um,</v>

331
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:55.740
so anyways,
in what moves,
one of the funny things was I'm sitting there with Nia,

332
00:19:55.741 --> 00:19:59.700
right?
And you know,
she's a great person.
She's not a grumpy person,

333
00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:02.790
so she's just enjoying all of it.
She's taken it and she's enjoying the game,

334
00:20:02.791 --> 00:20:03.061
you know?

335
00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:07.410
And when all of a sudden they started like I swear to God in like little

336
00:20:07.411 --> 00:20:10.620
parachutes stays dropdown,
um,

337
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.550
gift certificates to something that evidently we couldn't afford.

338
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.630
I don't know what it was like,
I can't even,
what the fuck it was.

339
00:20:18.631 --> 00:20:22.170
Everybody's jumping up,
like leaping up trying to catch these things.
Like it's,

340
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:22.590
you know,

341
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:26.160
the end of the Vietnam War and this is a ticket to get on the last chopper out

342
00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:28.890
of there.
Right?
Oh,
and then the fucking tee shirts,

343
00:20:28.891 --> 00:20:33.450
all of this shit I hate when they sit there and they got one t shirt left and

344
00:20:33.451 --> 00:20:36.840
they start looking at the section whatever section can make the most noise.

345
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:42.110
And just watching people like a fucking dog begging for a treat for a free

346
00:20:42.871 --> 00:20:45.890
fucking clippers,
a clippers teach.
This isn't even a Lakers tee shirt.

347
00:20:45.891 --> 00:20:46.880
This is a clippers tee.

348
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.810
Just watching all of those people taking all of this self esteem,

349
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:57.930
all every shred of integrity and jumping up and down over a fucking eight year

350
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:03.130
old to get a free tee shirt.
I don't know.
So anyways,
so nia points out,

351
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:07.770
there's some guys sitting in the front row that she follows on a

352
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.630
snapchat,
I believe it's called.
I keep calling it Instagram,
snapchat,
and he says,

353
00:21:13.631 --> 00:21:16.810
dude,
it just goes,
Yo,
they don't want you to fucking blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

354
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:19.000
blah.
And he's always doing whatever they say you can't do.
And she goes,

355
00:21:19.001 --> 00:21:22.510
look at him.
He's down there,
he's right there.
Oh look,

356
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.580
he's making a snapchat video.

357
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.580
She's watching the guy make the snapchat video.

358
00:21:27.581 --> 00:21:31.060
And then she takes out her cell phone in two seconds later she watches the
thing.

359
00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:35.020
And I'm watching the guide down there and doing a snapchat.

360
00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:38.620
I just watched the guy film,
but now I'm watching her,
her phone.
And by the way,

361
00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:41.570
in the meantime,
Steph curry is going up and down the fire.

362
00:21:41.571 --> 00:21:46.250
Everybody clap your hands,
right?
I got add.
I don't eat all of that shit.
Oh,

363
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.690
so anyways,
I zipped that isn't bad enough

364
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.900
as if I haven't been going on and on,
you know,

365
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:59.250
needing an entire fucking box of tampons at this point.

366
00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:03.090
How much I'm bitching at least even though I can't hear it,

367
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.550
even though there's going to be somebody standing up in front of me,

368
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.060
even though there's shooting tee shirts at me telling me to make some noise and

369
00:22:09.061 --> 00:22:12.780
clap my fucking hands like I don't know where I'm at.

370
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:15.283
<v 1>Okay.</v>

371
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.400
<v 0>Helen Keller,
she'd get like this level of fucking direction.
If she goes out,</v>

372
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:25.390
she's dead.
Whatever.
Anyways,
Steph curry,

373
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.830
Steph curry goes out there immediately gets a file.
I'll give a team.

374
00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.240
It was a file.
All right,

375
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.770
three minutes later they call some ticky tack Horse Shit on the Guy.

376
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.420
He's got two files in the first quarter that I sit them down.

377
00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:46.070
I don't fucking Freddy.
Stubhub is fitting that God.
Dude,
what the fuck?

378
00:22:46.071 --> 00:22:49.840
This is the guy that picked the same everybody.
Yo,
Yo,
yo Yo.

379
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:56.630
I'm fucking beside myself fucking beside myself going,

380
00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.560
this is why
I fucking hate this.
This is why.

381
00:23:00.561 --> 00:23:02.420
This is why these games get fixed.

382
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.520
This is why the NBA is fucking fixed because this is the only sport of the four

383
00:23:07.521 --> 00:23:12.521
major sports that the Goddamn fucking referee can take the best guy out of the

384
00:23:12.621 --> 00:23:14.930
game.
Just give them two quick ones in the first quarter.

385
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:16.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

386
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.090
<v 0>Can you imagine if you went to go to a football game,
right?
Oh,</v>

387
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:21.970
Freddy stub hub.

388
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:26.290
Bob Going to see fucking almost he Todd Brady versus Peyton manning the last

389
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:30.010
time I go to that fucking Broncos,
fucking patriots play off game and whatever.

390
00:23:30.011 --> 00:23:34.210
Tom Brady gets two quick ones for intentional grounding or some shit and next

391
00:23:34.211 --> 00:23:38.530
thing you know he's standing on the sideline and the fucking backup quarterbacks

392
00:23:38.531 --> 00:23:41.110
in there.
You're just standing there like,
dude,
are you fucking serious?

393
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.740
The guy spent like the whole first half on the bench.

394
00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:51.360
It was brutal and the refs were calling fucking everything teen everybody up.

395
00:23:51.651 --> 00:23:52.161
And I actually,

396
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:57.080
the only cool part about sitting down low that I saw was at one point is it

397
00:23:57.081 --> 00:24:01.010
Steve Kerr said his first name,
he fucking looks over at Doc rivers and they,

398
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.740
he gives doc rivers.
I like,
dude,
you fucking believe this shit.

399
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.440
And dark looks back.
And I'm like,
yeah,
what the fuck?

400
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.550
Like sharing this moment just as coaches,
like,

401
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:15.020
what the fuck are these refs doing?
So I don't know what happened at halftime.

402
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.720
If somebody called them up and said,
hey man,

403
00:24:17.721 --> 00:24:20.180
this is like one of the best games of the weekend.
You're fucking this up.

404
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:24.590
All right,
put your goddamn whistle away.
And the second half they let him play.

405
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:28.070
And it was,
it was,
it was beautiful.
So fucking amazing game.

406
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:32.120
Despite the fact all of that shit was going on.
Um,

407
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:37.940
I know,
I know.
I went on and on,
I probably went on too long.
I understand.

408
00:24:37.941 --> 00:24:41.330
But like,
you know,
it's,
it's such a great game.
And,
uh,

409
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.300
you know,
I kept thinking about Neil always watches all like those fucking,
uh,

410
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:53.510
you know,
reality shows and stylish shows and all that shit.

411
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.840
And,
uh,
you know,
when they trash people for what they're wearing,

412
00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.860
if somebody comes out and they'd be like,
oh,
honey to any accessories,

413
00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:05.300
you need to take a couple of things off it just go out like La,
you know,

414
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:09.530
they have like,
like too many fucking bracelets and then the fucking,
I dunno,

415
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.280
a hat and a scarf.
Just too many accessories that go.

416
00:25:13.281 --> 00:25:17.480
You just take a couple of things off before you go out into the world,
you know,

417
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.310
be more Parisian,
dopey.
Tampa,
Florida.
Okay.
I don't know why I said Tampa.

418
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.360
I just want to think of no class.
I just think of northern Florida.
Yeah,

419
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.060
I just said that you offended.

420
00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:34.250
Why don't you look out your fucking window past the crocodile over your truck

421
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:36.320
with the steel balls hanging off the back of,
yeah,

422
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.820
I'm fucking with the Florida.
Come on man.

423
00:25:42.821 --> 00:25:47.210
You can't be all bad if Walt Disney decided to put his world there.
Um,

424
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.160
that's what it feels like.
It,
those basketball games,
they just,

425
00:25:50.161 --> 00:25:54.610
just dial it back a little bit.
Okay.
Could the booty dancers be maybe,
you know,

426
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.250
could they at least be a junior high?
Kids get that happened back.

427
00:25:57.251 --> 00:25:59.110
That could be nice,
you know.
Um,

428
00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.490
could you play everybody claps their hands maybe just 18 fucking times during

429
00:26:03.491 --> 00:26:05.110
the game.
You know,

430
00:26:05.111 --> 00:26:08.440
if somebody pays through the fucking nose to get six fucking row,
could I,

431
00:26:08.441 --> 00:26:12.550
could I at least hear the sneakers squeaking?
They don't give a shit.

432
00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.650
They don't give a shit what they should've done at the end of the game.
You know,

433
00:26:15.651 --> 00:26:15.821
like,

434
00:26:15.821 --> 00:26:18.910
you know that when you go to the joke shop and you just open the thing up and

435
00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:20.960
all the snakes would come flying out.
That's what they should've done.

436
00:26:20.961 --> 00:26:24.470
There's a whole crowd just given him a fucking facial for fucking tee shirts
and,

437
00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:30.010
you know,
I gotta be honest with you,
even from me,
that was extra conti.
Um,

438
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.520
but once again,
dude,
I always stay to the end of the game.

439
00:26:33.521 --> 00:26:36.160
I don't know why people leave.
And um,

440
00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.600
the warriors were up by like fucking 1215 points or something.

441
00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:46.070
I think it was no way they will see 90.
They were by 11.

442
00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.980
They're the only like 15 points and then they think they cut it to 11 and people

443
00:26:48.981 --> 00:26:51.050
are leaving because there's only like a minute and a half left.

444
00:26:51.051 --> 00:26:54.110
Everybody was like,
well fuck this gotta beat the traffic,

445
00:26:54.111 --> 00:26:55.550
which is understandable in La.

446
00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.360
And everybody starts leaving and I'm psyched because it's getting quiet and I

447
00:26:59.361 --> 00:27:04.340
could finally hear these guys out on the court.
Right?
And um,

448
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:09.400
so the clip is bring the ball up and they like,

449
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.510
they've taken all the stars are out of the game at this point.

450
00:27:11.511 --> 00:27:13.490
They just got the bench in football teams.
So what the fuck?

451
00:27:13.491 --> 00:27:16.700
Even they're saying this game solver,
clippers bring it up.
They hit a three,

452
00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:21.830
right?
So now it's like a fucking eight point game warriors,

453
00:27:21.831 --> 00:27:25.730
whatever they inbound the ball,
clippers stealing,
run to the three point line.

454
00:27:25.731 --> 00:27:30.560
I love fucking Reggie Miller.
Boom.
Hit another three.
Now it's a five point game.

455
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:34.670
Now the people left for like,
Oh shit,
the fuck the war is like,
okay,
settle down.

456
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.200
Shut up,
don't get a pass half court.
They get a pass half court fucking clippers.

457
00:27:39.201 --> 00:27:40.100
Steal it again,

458
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:44.140
<v 2>boom.
Hit another one.
It's a tool.</v>

459
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.063
<v 0>Boy gave it</v>

460
00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.600
the people who are left to go and fucking crazy.
This is what I wanted.

461
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.590
Now all of a sudden they're fucking putting all the a list as a common backend

462
00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.200
to save the fucking day.
Chris Paul's back out there fucking Steph curry,

463
00:28:00.201 --> 00:28:05.000
the whole fucking thing.
The warriors bring the ball back up again.

464
00:28:05.001 --> 00:28:09.980
They somehow lose the ball three toe,
the clip of guys bringing it down.

465
00:28:09.981 --> 00:28:14.060
He jumps up in the air looking for somebody to pass it toe and then she's like,

466
00:28:14.061 --> 00:28:15.620
oh fuck,
there's not enough time yet.

467
00:28:15.621 --> 00:28:20.621
And then launches an attempt that look like they brought me out on the fucking

468
00:28:20.661 --> 00:28:23.930
court and it felt like data way short.

469
00:28:23.931 --> 00:28:27.080
It was just the wrong guy with the ball at the end of the fight.

470
00:28:27.081 --> 00:28:30.590
I don't know who the fuck it was,
but,
uh,
even he looked at me,
she just goes like,

471
00:28:30.591 --> 00:28:34.820
what?
What,
what was that?
I was like,
I don't fucking know.
I don't know.

472
00:28:34.821 --> 00:28:36.560
And then that was the end of the game.
And then they were like,

473
00:28:36.561 --> 00:28:37.490
thanks for coming out,
man.

474
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.453
<v 2>So,</v>

475
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.580
<v 0>um,
but anyways,
at the end of the day,</v>

476
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:45.910
I feel like I saw Steph curry.

477
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.540
I got to give it up to the warriors though,
man.
Like just watching the,

478
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.560
watching them,
the way they move with the ball around and all of that.

479
00:28:55.561 --> 00:29:00.360
And even with,
you know,
the Star on the bench,
man,
there was a Thompson,

480
00:29:00.361 --> 00:29:03.000
I don't,
I don't know shit about hope as you can tell Thompson,

481
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:05.670
that guy was fucking killing them and then they got this other dude,

482
00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.110
they're like backup center or something.
This guy is a fucking house.

483
00:29:10.111 --> 00:29:12.550
He looks like a defensive lineman if,
you know,

484
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.310
you put six inches on him and he had one dunk during the game.

485
00:29:17.311 --> 00:29:19.650
I can't believe he didn't fucking Yank the whole rim down.

486
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.480
It was fucking hilarious.

487
00:29:21.481 --> 00:29:25.920
He got a head of steam and everybody just got the fuck out of the way.
Um,

488
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.320
and if only they weren't playing drink during the time when it happened.
Man,

489
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:35.400
I could actually could have heard that fucking earth shattering dunk who's

490
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:40.000
literally 30 feet away.
I couldn't even hear it.
All right,

491
00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:44.810
I'm done.
Okay.
I just had to fence.
I'm sorry guys.
I just,
you know,

492
00:29:44.811 --> 00:29:49.760
just had a rough time.
All right.
Let me fucking,
I've been talking so much.

493
00:29:49.761 --> 00:29:54.620
I've gone into screensaver.
Yeah.
I can never remember the fucking password.

494
00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.670
Yeah.
You know what it is.
I can't talk and do this at the same time.

495
00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:02.690
These stupid fucking capital letters come on one time.
One time.

496
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.090
And the 52 fucking numbers that come at the end and of course it's wrong.

497
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:11.780
Why would it be right?
Do I literally have to hit pause?

498
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:13.993
<v 1>Okay.</v>

499
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:19.050

let's continue on here with the fucking bitch fest at the is that this podcast

571
00:34:53.021 --> 00:34:56.630
has become this week.
Um,
by the way,

572
00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:01.690
the fucking Boston Bruins,
you know,
madam,
born in game against the predators,

573
00:35:01.691 --> 00:35:03.700
lost two to nothing.
And then we,
uh,

574
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:09.010
we went down three to one against the Great Dallas Stars team,

575
00:35:09.011 --> 00:35:10.750
one of my favorite fucking teams to watch.

576
00:35:10.751 --> 00:35:12.370
That's the team I'm rooting for out in the West,

577
00:35:12.371 --> 00:35:14.230
even though I still love the Blackhawks and the kings.

578
00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:16.000
And I know what you're thinking.
Hockey fans,

579
00:35:16.001 --> 00:35:17.430
how the fuck can you like the Blackhawks?

580
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.650
And the kinks they'll rivals as cause I'm,
I'm an eastern conference.

581
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:22.001
I don't give a shit.

582
00:35:22.001 --> 00:35:24.190
I don't give a shit that you guys hate each other or respect both your

583
00:35:24.191 --> 00:35:25.840
franchises.
All right.

584
00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:31.180
Excuse me for liking what you're doing in Baltics.
Um,

585
00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:37.000
by like the Dallas Stars because uh,
I dunno,
I just,
I just,
um,

586
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.920
you know that they're the upstarts.
It's always been kings in black cock.

587
00:35:41.921 --> 00:35:45.360
So you got to go for the underdog,
right?
And uh,

588
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:46.973
<v 1>yeah,</v>

589
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.650
<v 0>I don't know.
It's just like watching a play.
So anyways,</v>

590
00:35:49.651 --> 00:35:52.200
what do I feel so defensive right now?
I just enjoy watching him play.

591
00:35:52.201 --> 00:35:54.900
So they go up three to one and my car,
it just sucks.

592
00:35:54.901 --> 00:35:57.630
I'm going to Swatch my team got their ass kicked,
but at least I get to watch.

593
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:02.220
I get you.
I get to watch this stars.
But uh,
that was it.

594
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.580
And I bet all you fucking cowboy fans watching the hockey.

595
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:09.540
I'm getting to this man now.
That's four goals in one fucking period.

596
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.410
It's a called a Perry Rod.
Yeah,
I'm enjoying this man.
I'm really enjoying this.

597
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:17.700
And then that was it.
They got the old right there.
Fred right there.

598
00:36:17.701 --> 00:36:20.430
Fred from fucking the Bro.
It's a little cold lotion.

599
00:36:20.431 --> 00:36:25.230
Few fucking cowboys Bruins went on and scored six unanswered goals.

600
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.400
Brad Mars,
Shannon Marchand,
however the fuck you supposed to pronounce it,

601
00:36:29.401 --> 00:36:31.960
they switched it halfway through.
Um,

602
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.870
scored goal number 29 and 30.
I thought he had 29 goals the other day,

603
00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:41.670
but he's got score scored 29 and 30.
He's never scored 30 goals.
Uh,

604
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:44.760
let's go,
man,
we haven't had like a big goal score in a long fucking time.

605
00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:47.730
I'm opening scores 50.
Obviously he's not good.

606
00:36:47.731 --> 00:36:49.980
I don't think he's gonna make it to end,
but he's kicked.
He could get 40.

607
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:55.440
I'm trying to think the last time.
Who was the last Brewen to score 40 goals

608
00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.360
since I been getting the,
uh,
you know,
I'm going to look that up right now.

609
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.960
My,
my only guests that I could make would be cam Neely because there was like a

610
00:37:06.961 --> 00:37:10.290
five year period.
I barely watched a Bruins game because I was just,

611
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:15.890
I barely watch any sports because I was sleeping on a futon and I was rapidly

612
00:37:16.051 --> 00:37:19.590
approaching my mid thirties and I had to get some shit going in my career here.

613
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:22.590
All right.
Uh,
last Bruin.

614
00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:24.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

615
00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:29.240
<v 0>To score 40 goals.
It's,</v>

616
00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:33.000
do you know something?
It just came up before I even typed that out.

617
00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:38.110
Is this fucking thing listening to me now?
It seems it's so creepy.

618
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.950
All right.
Who's the last farm?
Just prone to score 40 goals in a season.

619
00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.650
I'm a say cam.
Neely.
That's the last one.
I remember.

620
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.070
When was the last time the Bruins won the cup?
2011.
We know that.

621
00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:51.370
Who scored the most don't goes.
Why are the Bruins name the Bruins?

622
00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.940
The named after a bear.
Oh,
fuck you.

623
00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:57.390
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

624
00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:59.280
<v 0>They don't even know.
Sorry.
But the Audi audio there,</v>

625
00:37:59.281 --> 00:38:00.410
they don't even have the fucking

626
00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:06.870
Jerome Miguel [inaudible] the next 40 now list of players have 50 goals.

627
00:38:06.871 --> 00:38:07.980
Boston Bruins.

628
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:09.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

629
00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:12.830
<v 0>Yeah.
It's not even here.
All right.
Some fucking NHL Nerd.</v>

630
00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:15.563
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

631
00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.350
<v 0>If you could fucking answer that one for me.</v>

632
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

633
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:23.540
<v 0>Um,
Joe Thornton.
I don't fucking know.</v>

634
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:28.370
Anyways.
Uh,
all right,
let's get on with the,
let's get on with the questions here.

635
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:31.580
Oh,
by the way,
fucking Donald Trump.
It's this guy's crushing it.

636
00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.890
He just said that he feels it's going to be him.
Hillary Clinton.

637
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.180
Bernie Sanders doesn't have a chance and Hillary will make it unless she gets

638
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:44.740
indicted.
Dude,
he,
that guy is so fucking brilliant.

639
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:47.230
He just told everybody that this is what's going to happen.

640
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.860
And the amount of dopes after watching people dive in over each other for free

641
00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:51.341
tee shirts,

642
00:38:51.341 --> 00:38:53.500
they're just going to listen to them and then that's what's going to happen.

643
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:58.720
And then he fucking throws a little fucking,
uh,
you know,

644
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.180
a little fucking whatever pipe to the knee of Hillary go.

645
00:39:02.181 --> 00:39:05.590
Unless she gets indicted,
which gets that shit storm going again.

646
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:07.230
We'll Hillary Clinton get invited.

647
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.253
<v 1>Okay.</v>

648
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.280
<v 0>I have to tell you,
if those are going to be our two choices,
this is,</v>

649
00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:16.600
it has to be a low point in this country.
You know what I mean?

650
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:17.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

651
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:18.051
<v 0>Well,</v>

652
00:39:18.051 --> 00:39:23.051
we have the star of a reality show on one side and then the filthy fucking

653
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.690
Clintons.
Oh my God.
And it's not even Bill Clinton.

654
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:30.910
You know what I mean?
It's just,
it's just fucking unbelievable.

655
00:39:30.911 --> 00:39:32.230
It's like you're literally,
like I said,

656
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.590
why would you hire the plumber's wife to come over and fix your sink?

657
00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.420
I don't understand politics.

658
00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.890
I don't get how you can just start at such a high fucking level with no god damn

659
00:39:41.891 --> 00:39:45.640
experience.
Like how did you start as a senator?
You know?
Oh,

660
00:39:45.641 --> 00:39:47.800
that fucking the mayor in New York are Bloomberg.

661
00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:52.280
I got $1 billion yet want to run the city.
Now I get those cars out of the,

662
00:39:52.281 --> 00:39:55.060
I'm going to put some chairs down.
It's like,
who the fuck is this guy?

663
00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.180
How come you don't have to start in the mail room?
You know,

664
00:39:58.181 --> 00:40:01.420
you don't have to start off as like an open mic or like a comedian.
Well,

665
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:04.080
I was married you a prejudiced.
Now I'd like to be senator.

666
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:10.150
Shut up.
Oh God.
Listen to that fucking voice.

667
00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.900
Listen to that voice.
So it looks at that.
Oh,

668
00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:18.250
Donald Trump would have fucking wigwam be a manager.
Shave your head,
you know.

669
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:22.180
All right.

673

I'm actually in a,

674
00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.080
I'm in a great mood.
This is what I sound like when I'm in a great mood,

675
00:40:39.081 --> 00:40:43.790

And I still had a great time at the fucking game.

All right.
Now this is happening.

He says,

688
00:41:31.461 --> 00:41:36.410
I'm 35 years old and still living with my father.
Pathetic.

689
00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.070
I know.
Believe me,
it's not by choice.
I've,

690
00:41:39.071 --> 00:41:41.390
I'm finally recovering from lymes disease,

691
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:46.280
which sucked away 10 years of my life and I will have my student loans paid off

692
00:41:46.281 --> 00:41:50.030
in a couple of months,
months.
What's also sucked away 10 years of my life,

Jesus Christ.
Dude come in with the misery here in a couple of months.

694

My father is selling the house that we currently live in and moving into a

695
00:41:58.431 --> 00:42:01.940
cheaper fixer upper so he can be mortgage free.
I love that.

696
00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.510
It's a great idea provided you know how to fix it up.

697
00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.053
<v 4>MMM.</v>

all the doors in the last two interior door locks are going to work.

700
00:42:11.081 --> 00:42:12.670
I got a skeleton key for all of them.

701
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:17.080
I'm so ridiculously excited and for the life of me,

702
00:42:17.081 --> 00:42:19.420
I can't find anyone else who gives a shit.

703
00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.780
I've had people over the house and I go,
look at this.
Isn't this great?

704
00:42:22.781 --> 00:42:27.220
And they're like,
yeah,
why would you want to walk doors in your house?

705
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:36.210
You know,
loved it.
My mother in law,
she came over and she,

706
00:42:36.211 --> 00:42:39.730
she freaked.
She was just like,
oh my God.
She goes,
that is so cool.

707
00:42:39.731 --> 00:42:44.200
She totally got it.
Did that,
that made it worth it right there.
So anyways,
let me,

708
00:42:44.201 --> 00:42:49.100
uh,
let me continue on.
Um,
he goes,
so anyways,

709
00:42:49.101 --> 00:42:50.990
he had paid off his student loans.
He goes,
I can,
so my head,

710
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:52.100
here's the choice I have to make.

711
00:42:52.101 --> 00:42:57.101
I can either live with my dad even longer than I already have and be rent free

712
00:42:57.711 --> 00:43:02.000
in this fixer upper so that I can save up money and get my own place.

713
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:06.020
Or I can rent a shitty apartment and burned a grand a month,

714
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:11.050
which would clearly be better spent on a new house if I was in my twenties or

715
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.570
early thirties.
I might be a little more open to the idea of renting one,

716
00:43:14.571 --> 00:43:15.710
which I did in college.

717
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:19.430
The upside of renting an apartment is having a little more confidence and

718
00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:21.050
integrity when I'm out on a date,

719
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:24.830
knowing that we can retreat back to my own place,
a set of my parents' house.

720
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.090
We'll do.
Why don't you just hit him with the Lyme disease fucking story,

721
00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:31.573
<v 4>you know,</v>

722
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.550
<v 0>and just tell him,
yeah,
I'm living at home cause I'm not dropping a grant.</v>

723
00:43:35.551 --> 00:43:38.250
I'm going to be buying a house as long as long as you have a game plan,

724
00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.910
women will fucking dealt.
They'll,
they'll ride it,

725
00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:44.370
they'll write it out with you for a little bit,
feel saying,
listen,
yeah.

726
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:48.740
I had Lyme disease for 10 fucking years and,
uh,

727
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:53.310
I finally got over it and I had to move back in with my dad and that's brutal

728
00:43:53.311 --> 00:43:55.320
right there.
Had moving back in with my dead.

729
00:43:55.321 --> 00:43:59.340
You almost want to have that part of a whole nother,
you know,
run on sentence.

730
00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:03.840
You just got to plow right through.
That had moved back home,
my dad.
But,
um,

731
00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:06.750
I'm on the fuck.

732
00:44:06.751 --> 00:44:09.440
Do you gotta see you gotta say I moved back home with my dad,
but I,

733
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:11.970
I almost have enough money for a down payment on a house,

734
00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.350
so I'm not throwing a thousand off Jesus Christ bats.

735
00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:19.530
I'll tell you it's a rough one.
You know?
Um,
uh,
you know what?

736
00:44:19.531 --> 00:44:23.730
Fuck these fucking fuck them.
Fuck them.
Just tell them what you're doing.
Yeah.

737
00:44:23.731 --> 00:44:26.760
Living at home because I'm saving up to buy a house.
Yeah.
I am 35.
Just own it.

738
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.373
Yeah.

739
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.353
<v 4>Okay.</v>

740
00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:33.020
<v 0>Listen,
I have my own entrance into the house.
My Dad wants to</v>

741
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:38.190
anyways,
just plow ahead.
If I was in my twenties,
early thirties,

742
00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:41.010
I might be a little more open to the idea of renting,
which I did college.
Sorry.

743
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:44.280
I already read that.
The upside of renting and apartment is having a little more,

744
00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:45.290
AH,
Jesus Christ.
Bill.

745
00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:47.433
<v 4>MMM.</v>

746
00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:48.910
<v 0>All right.</v>

747
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:52.600
It's also the freedom of coming home to a quiet house and knowing that my God

748
00:44:52.601 --> 00:44:55.360
damn food will still be in the refrigerator when I get home.

749
00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:59.560
My brother is also still living at home.
He suffers from migraines.

750
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.690
Um,
dude,
what the fuck?
Where do you,
what do you live near?
What's sort of fucking,

751
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:08.780
this sounds like one of those fucking movies where they have

752
00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.340
you guys eaten the lead,
paint your house,
like,
what's going on here?

753
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:18.050
So you get Lyme disease.
Where are you going to fucking hike?

754
00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.290
Not wearing any shoes and get bit by a tick.
I can't remember.

755
00:45:21.291 --> 00:45:23.360
There's too many fucking diseases.
Anyways,
he goes,

756
00:45:23.361 --> 00:45:27.650
so should I get on with my life and start pissing money away on rent or should I

757
00:45:27.651 --> 00:45:29.930
stick it out a little longer and continue to live with,

758
00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:33.740
with father so I can get my own fixer upper?
I love the podcast.
Thanks.

759
00:45:33.741 --> 00:45:38.530
And Go fuck yourself in the Aa with a d Jay Kay.
Um,

760
00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:43.460
all right.
I would,
uh,
look,
if you just have to stick it out a little longer,

761
00:45:43.461 --> 00:45:46.250
who gives a fuck at this point?
You already did 10 years.

762
00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:49.363
<v 4>You know,
if,
if,</v>

763
00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.750
<v 0>if you can get yourself in a situation where you can actually own the place</v>

764
00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:53.613
where you're living.

765
00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.033
<v 4>MMM.</v>

766
00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.690
<v 0>[inaudible] say that you're basically,
you,
you,
instead of having a landlord,</v>

767
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:04.380
the banks,
your landlord,
you have a mortgage.
And people said,
you ran a d,

768
00:46:04.381 --> 00:46:08.640
you own I own,
I own a house.
We bought a house.
Oh yeah.
Outright.

769
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:11.610
No,
no,
we'll make it mortgage payment.
All right then you don't own it.

770
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.570
Somebody owns you.
Right.
That's what happened.

771
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:18.120
You used to be,
you'll use,

772
00:46:18.121 --> 00:46:23.100
do you use to be in a situation where somebody owns you month to month,

773
00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:27.750
but any point you could just take off,
you could leave the plantation.
Okay.

774
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:32.670
Now you just signed up for 30 years.
Somebody fucking putting it in.
Yeah.

775
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.050
Every fucking month.

776
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:40.020
So what I would say is I would stick it out a little bit longer with my dad and

777
00:46:40.021 --> 00:46:44.550
uh,
I would buy a house where,
you know,

778
00:46:44.551 --> 00:46:46.860
it's not one of those deals where you could just make the mortgage payment.

779
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.090
You got to get into a situation where not only do you,

780
00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:52.260
you're making the mortgage payment,
but you can throw something at the principal.

781
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:53.880
You know,

782
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.610
you got to beat the fuck out of that and you got to beat the fuck out of it

783
00:46:56.611 --> 00:46:59.940
quick because they front end load all the interests,
which to this day,

784
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:02.910
I don't know why it's legal.
Oh yeah,
that's right.
That's right.

785
00:47:02.911 --> 00:47:05.970
The president only makes 400 grand a year that,
oh,
I forgot.
That's right.

786
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.070
That's right.
Yeah,

787
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.580
and bankers go out and have like $400,000 fucking,

788
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.750
you know,
I wouldn't even say Christmas parties.

789
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:18.690
I mean that's what they probably play the outfield to come and play their

790
00:47:18.691 --> 00:47:23.040
daughter's 16th birthday.
I said there's no way they taste them.
400 grant.

791
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:27.520
Green Day.
You could get green day for 400 grand.
Right.

792
00:47:27.521 --> 00:47:31.320
Play a half hour in your backyard.
That's then what's it?
That's a tree off.

793
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.840
It's a 120 $533,000 each hour in a 34 for the lead singer because he sees

794
00:47:37.871 --> 00:47:40.570
playing all the guitar parts and singing.
All right.

795
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:43.503
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

796
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:48.510
<v 0>I'm going to do a startup.
I Want Green Day to pay my play.
My 48th birthday.</v>

797
00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.930
All right.
UK,
United Kingdom.
Dear Bill,

798
00:47:51.931 --> 00:47:55.620
when are you coming back to the U K and are you watching any football,

799
00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.890
parentheses soccer in between Bruins games?
Nah,
I've been just,

800
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.720
I've been really fucking busy so I haven't gotten to watch any of that.
Uh,

801
00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:05.550
I saw a little bit the other day.
I don't know,
it was in some pub.

802
00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.610
I always watch it,
man,
when I see,
you know,
if I got,

803
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.460
if I stumble upon it I will watch it.
But,
um,

804
00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:16.740
I'm hoping to do a European tour,
um,

805
00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:21.600
towards the end of the summer.
Maybe like in August.

806
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.730
It'd be really interesting to go through Scandinavia,
you know,

807
00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:28.410
when the sun's not going down at three and three in the afternoon,

808
00:48:28.411 --> 00:48:32.160
which to be honest with you,
I actually think it's pretty fucking cool,
you know?

809
00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:36.460
Um,
I got to admit,

810
00:48:36.461 --> 00:48:40.990
when I went to Iceland in December,
that's the fucking time to go.

811
00:48:40.991 --> 00:48:43.300
Don't go in the summertime when every jerk off is there.

812
00:48:43.301 --> 00:48:45.430
You go in the summertime when nobody wants to go,

813
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:48.550
and then you go to that blue lagoon fucking spa.

814
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.730
It's just naturally,

815
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:55.230
he did buy the fucking volcanoes or whatever the fuck it is.
It's,

816
00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:59.760
it's an incredible fucking incredible,
one of the,
uh,

817
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:05.200
when the coolest places I've ever been to.
Um,
but yeah,

818
00:49:05.201 --> 00:49:09.100
I'm definitely going to be coming back doing a big standup tour and I'm going to

819
00:49:09.101 --> 00:49:12.550
be adding some,
uh,
eastern European countries.

820
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:17.770
Um,
and I'm really excited about that.
A buddy of mine just went to Germany,

821
00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:21.930
was saying what a great time they had and he was actually in a bar and,
uh,

822
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.110
met somebody that knew what my stuff was or something.

823
00:49:24.111 --> 00:49:27.160
He would do some of my standup jokes or something.
So I'm mostly German,

824
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:32.290
so I would be excited to,
uh,
to go back to the,
uh,
to the motherland there.

825
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.500
Um,
speaking of which actually watched this documentary,

826
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:37.270
my wife tape was talking to that,

827
00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:42.040
the charisma of Adolf Hitler on PBS.

828
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:47.290
And it was this fascinating thing how they talked about just what is charisma.

829
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:48.980
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

830
00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:49.813
<v 0>You know,</v>

831
00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:54.820
and they had this whole thing was saying how like Hitler could not had just no

832
00:49:56.181 --> 00:50:00.170
functioning relationships with anybody one on one,

833
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:05.300
but he just crushed it in front of a crowd and how he would make them wait and

834
00:50:05.301 --> 00:50:08.600
all of that shit is fucking hilarious.
Like he's waiting to start a speech.

835
00:50:08.601 --> 00:50:11.900
Everyone's cheering and he's just standing there until they're dead silent.

836
00:50:11.901 --> 00:50:15.080
You know,
it reminded me one time,
Nia took,

837
00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:19.940
I took me to go see Erika Badu and she comes out and everyone wants you to sing

838
00:50:19.941 --> 00:50:22.480
and she spends the first five minutes just walking around the lighting,

839
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.010
the incense.
So I'm watching Hitler's,
she's got,

840
00:50:25.011 --> 00:50:28.730
she got this from Hitler to the fucking thing.
Everybody's like,
oh,

841
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:32.840
we need to behave ourselves.
And then the performance will begin.

842
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:36.650
But they had all these creepy fucking speeches.

843
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.770
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

844
00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:40.380
<v 0>That he was getting,
he was doing this thing where he was going.</v>

845
00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.410
There's a group of people among us

846
00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:45.993
<v 1>who</v>

847
00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:51.220
<v 0>can basically live anywhere.
They do business anywhere.</v>

848
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:56.020
It doesn't matter them to them.
They live in Paris next month they'll live,

849
00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.800
they'll live in fucking Vienna.
Then they'll live here.
And Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

850
00:50:59.801 --> 00:51:04.570
blah with no ties to that hole.
And he just keeps spoonfeeding them.

851
00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.680
Do you know,
he won't come out and say it,

852
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000
this group of people because they have no attachment to Germany.

853
00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:15.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

854
00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:18.330
<v 0>You know,
but blah,
blah blah blah.
Then finally sent me,
the crowd goes,</v>

855
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:23.360
Joe yelled out Jews and it learned,

856
00:51:23.361 --> 00:51:25.920
never addressed it and then just kept going.

857
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:30.390
It was are you have to see this.
It is the creepiest,

858
00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.320
<v 1>okay.</v>

859
00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.320
<v 0>Absolutely.
Absolutely creepy is fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.</v>

860
00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.390
And then,
uh,
but I would,

861
00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:42.450
I would be lying to you if I didn't tell you that I learned some things as far

862
00:51:43.511 --> 00:51:47.830
as performance in front of a crowd.
I mean,
you've got to give it up.

863
00:51:47.831 --> 00:51:52.760
The guy was a beast.
I don't,
I don't even remotely agree with the guys message,

864
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:53.980
but Jesus Christ,

865
00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.110
<v 1>okay.</v>

866
00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:59.200
<v 0>The guys going out in front of a crowd,
you know,</v>

867
00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:04.410
a Kevin Hart size fucking crowd and doesn't say a fucking word he doesn't get to

868
00:52:04.991 --> 00:52:08.450
do is the exact opposite of the clippers game Max.
All right.

869
00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:10.090
Jesus Christ.

870
00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:16.970
Hitler's got to come back and start running the NBA there.
I said it,
I said it,

871
00:52:16.971 --> 00:52:21.860
they can just get past the fact that 99% of the players are African American.

872
00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:25.820
I think he could do some great things for the league.
I think he quiet it down.

873
00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:30.590
Alright,
sorry.
Anyways,
so I will be going to the eastern Europe.

874
00:52:30.591 --> 00:52:33.410
That's what I was trying to say.
Or Europe in general.
Do you,
okay.
There we go.

875
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:38.390
All right.
Apple fives.
The FBI.
Dear big brother Billy,

876
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:42.260
what are your thoughts in the battle between apple and the FBI regarding hacking

877
00:52:42.261 --> 00:52:46.580
into the,
the phones of the San Bernardino terrorist?
Also,

878
00:52:46.581 --> 00:52:51.350
just the fact that the FBI has the phones for two months and can't get into
them,

879
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:55.790
put a dent into any government overreach conspiracy theories.

880
00:52:55.910 --> 00:53:00.380
Uh,
no.
He says the situation with the apple is FBI wants to apple to create an

881
00:53:00.381 --> 00:53:05.381
operating system that would allow for them to hack encryption on the phone.

882
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:07.790
Uh,

883
00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:12.320
they would upload the system to the terrorist's phone to allow them to unlock
it.

884
00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:13.183
However,

885
00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:14.320
<v 1>yeah.</v>

886
00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:19.090
<v 0>What they would upload this system to the terrorist's phone to allow them to</v>

887
00:53:19.091 --> 00:53:24.040
unlock it.
However,
if apple does this,

888
00:53:24.041 --> 00:53:28.110
the operating system can be used by the FBI and others to totally compromise any

889
00:53:28.111 --> 00:53:32.520
security on any iPhone in the future.
How the solution is simple.
It's just like,

890
00:53:32.521 --> 00:53:34.860
just bring the phones to us and we'll hack into it.

891
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.550
And whatever information needed on the fonts will do that for you.
Yeah.

892
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:41.400
Once again,
because of these terrorists con,

893
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.180
what you're gonna do is you're going to allow all the,
you know,

894
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:50.730
these fucking lunatics at the top to take even more power and privacy away from

895
00:53:50.731 --> 00:53:51.990
you.
And I could just,

896
00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:53.980
<v 1>yeah.</v>

897
00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:58.960
<v 0>Simplest way to tell you this is just like,
you know,
the,</v>

898
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:03.480
the amount of people out there that can actually handle power is very,

899
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:06.610
it's very rare.
I mean,
look in my business,
okay?
You see what happens?
You know,

900
00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:08.530
everybody's down to earth,
everybody's cool,

901
00:54:08.531 --> 00:54:10.870
and all of a sudden you get your own Sitcom and next thing you know,

902
00:54:10.871 --> 00:54:13.450
you're banning people from the set your tip and shit over.

903
00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:16.360
And nobody's saying shit because you make it all this fucking money.

904
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:19.750
You don't handle it well.
Right.
Be like

905
00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.930
being like in at the top levels of government and security.

906
00:54:23.931 --> 00:54:26.840
It's the same fucking thing.
I don't think they handled it well.

907
00:54:26.841 --> 00:54:31.130
I think it's way too much freedom and I'm sick of people saying shit like,

908
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:34.010
hey man,
if you're not doing anything,
then what are you worried about?

909
00:54:34.011 --> 00:54:37.010
I'm worried about the fact that,
you know,
just,
you know,

910
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:39.010
<v 1>okay,</v>

911
00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:41.680
<v 0>well she would being stupid.
We're awful.
We're fucking terrible people.</v>

912
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:44.140
What terrible with the amount of access that we have now,

913
00:54:44.141 --> 00:54:48.940
you don't need to give people more access and I don't feel like,
you know,

914
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.410
they keep just hiding behind this whole fucking thing of like,
you know what?

915
00:54:53.411 --> 00:54:56.110
We're just going to use it for the bad people.
It's like,
yeah,

916
00:54:56.111 --> 00:54:59.980
but you get to decide who the fuck's bed.
That Snowden guy,

917
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:02.620
he had to walk away what they were building.

918
00:55:02.621 --> 00:55:06.880
It was like the fucking Batman movie.
The spire on their own fucking people.

919
00:55:06.881 --> 00:55:09.250
They're lunatics.
I don't know what they do.

920
00:55:09.251 --> 00:55:12.240
I always picture him just sitting there fucking,
I don't know.

921
00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:15.370
I would do Gino,
like that Snowden guy.

922
00:55:15.371 --> 00:55:17.560
He says when he stays in a fucking hotel room,

923
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.380
he unplugs the phone because they had that speaker phone.

924
00:55:20.381 --> 00:55:24.910
Do you know that down at the front desk they can turn it on and just listen to

925
00:55:24.911 --> 00:55:28.700
whatever you're doing in there.
Do you know fucking your way talking to yourself,

926
00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:31.410
Robin one out.

927
00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:32.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

928
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:35.540
<v 0>Whatever the fuck you doing in the privacy,
your own fucking hotel,</v>

929
00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:37.650
they can just listen in on that shit.
It's fucking,

930
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:41.110
it's just the whole thing is creepy and um,

931
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:42.930
<v 1>okay.</v>

932
00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:45.840
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
it's,
I can't imagine,</v>

933
00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:50.410
you know what,
by the time,
you know,
if I live,
you know,

934
00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:55.150
to be like 90 a hundred years old,
like I would like to,
um,

935
00:55:55.690 --> 00:56:00.130
I want to see the fucking,
I want to live in every fucking decade,
you know,

936
00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:03.310
I want to get to the 60s again.
I was born in 1960.
I don't want to make it,

937
00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:06.940
you know,
I just keep thinking shit like that.
I want to make it right.
So,

938
00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.053
um,

939
00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:13.050
I can't imagine like the lack of privacy that there'll be if you live that long

940
00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:17.890
just with like people with like drones and shit like that,

941
00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:22.090
like the cameras and just how like I think in the future,
right,

942
00:56:22.091 --> 00:56:24.300
they're going to make these,
I'd have like these,
uh,

943
00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:29.160
like microchips like Mres,
you know?

944
00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:30.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

945
00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:34.850
<v 0>And like somebody walks by and somebody just hits you with a little mist and all</v>

946
00:56:34.851 --> 00:56:38.330
these little microchips go on and when you shower,
like most of them come off,

947
00:56:38.331 --> 00:56:41.540
but like a fuels still stick on you and then your next door neighbor could just

948
00:56:41.541 --> 00:56:45.590
watch your whole fucking life.
There'll be no more TV shows.

949
00:56:45.591 --> 00:56:50.360
We'll just be spying on each other.
I don't know.

950
00:56:50.361 --> 00:56:53.570
I think it's all fucking creepy and I think that's way too much.

951
00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.790
I don't think the FBI needs to fucking do that.

952
00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:59.480
I think apple should work with the FBI and uh,

953
00:56:59.481 --> 00:57:02.750
if there's ever like somebody that they want to fucking check in on,
you know,

954
00:57:02.751 --> 00:57:04.470
let them do it.
So have them call them up.

955
00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:05.840
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

956
00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.700
<v 0>Um,
hang on one second.</v>

957
00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:09.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

958
00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:12.000
<v 0>Hey,
I'm finishing up my podcasts.
Let me call you back in five minutes.
All right?</v>

959
00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:13.490
<v 1>Yup.
Cool.</v>

960
00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:18.390
<v 0>Um,
all right.
Let's get onto the next one.
All right.
Gay Friend.
Hey Bill.</v>

961
00:57:18.391 --> 00:57:20.520
First off,
thanks for the laughs.
Well,
you're welcome.

962
00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:24.420
I'm 30 years old and decided to go back to school two years ago to study

963
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:28.740
chemistry.
I'm an idiot like you,
but with enough effort,

964
00:57:28.741 --> 00:57:32.400
anything is possible.
Yeah.
I believe Kevin Garnett said that.

965
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:34.303
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

966
00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:39.860
<v 0>Um,
during my first semester back,
I befriended a gay guy.</v>

967
00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:44.600
I am not gay myself,
nor am I homophobic.
I've also never had a gay friend.

968
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:49.220
We have a lot in common except for the fact that he likes to give and take it up

969
00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:54.020
the ass.
Jesus Christ.
Dude,
you could've said,

970
00:57:54.021 --> 00:57:57.610
except that he likes gay sex.
All right.
I don't proofread these.

971
00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:00.950
I just stumbled on the sentences.
Here we go.
During that first semester,

972
00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:06.560
I just started to get the feeling that he liked me.
Uh,

973
00:58:06.561 --> 00:58:10.280
I started to get uncomfortable studying with him and stopped answering his phone

974
00:58:10.281 --> 00:58:14.240
calls for a few days.
After those two days,
I decided to call him,

975
00:58:14.241 --> 00:58:17.690
explain my concerns.
I told him that I've never had a gay friend before.

976
00:58:17.691 --> 00:58:18.830
I think he's a cool guy,

977
00:58:18.831 --> 00:58:21.770
but I also explained that I'm getting the feeling that he thinks he might have a

978
00:58:21.771 --> 00:58:26.480
chance.
Do that.
You handled it perfectly.
He goes,

979
00:58:26.481 --> 00:58:30.530
he laughed and he assured me that he wasn't hitting on me and knew I wasn't gay.

980
00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:33.910
He also told me that if he feel he cray iffy,

981
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:38.720
if I feel he crosses a line to tell him,
tell him,
okay,

982
00:58:38.721 --> 00:58:41.820
great.
I said,
I dunno dude.

983
00:58:41.821 --> 00:58:43.770
He said he wasn't hitting on you and then he's kind of like,
yeah,

984
00:58:43.771 --> 00:58:45.110
but if I cross a line,

985
00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:47.160
<v 1>okay,</v>

986
00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:50.320
<v 0>I,
the way I look at it,
at the end of the day,
it's a guy,
all right,</v>

987
00:58:50.321 --> 00:58:54.870
and guys think,
you know,
if you're talking to them,
you want to hook up,

988
00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:58.500
right.
That's why women,
you know when they walk down the street guys are like,

989
00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.750
smile,
say hello.
It's like I can't,

990
00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:04.170
or else you think I want to fuck you and then I got to deal with that level of

991
00:59:04.171 --> 00:59:07.350
interaction.
That's why I got to walk down the street with this Donald Trump.

992
00:59:07.351 --> 00:59:10.930
Look on my face.
Right.
The same thing I always feel,
I feel I would like gay guy.

993
00:59:10.931 --> 00:59:11.820
She can't be,
can't be,

994
00:59:11.821 --> 00:59:15.420
can only be so fucking nice or are they going to think they got a shot?
He,

995
00:59:15.421 --> 00:59:19.230
cause they're,
they were born with a deck.
That's what I taught.

996
00:59:19.231 --> 00:59:23.420
I did a bit about that.
Your Dick's a,
you're dick believes man.

997
00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:27.050
It's fucking wave and everybody around the third base.
All right.

998
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.630
Now I'm in my second year of school,

999
00:59:29.631 --> 00:59:33.590
fourth semester and we have more of the same classes but not together over the

1000
00:59:33.591 --> 00:59:34.071
winter break.

1001
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:37.400
He called me and asked if I wanted to go to the bar with him and some other

1002
00:59:37.401 --> 00:59:40.070
friends from school.
I happily said yes and drove to the bar.

1003
00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:44.240
After about two hours.
He asked me if I have any weed and if I'd smoke,

1004
00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:49.340
smoke him down.
Are we still talking about weed here?

1005
00:59:49.341 --> 00:59:52.070
What are we doing here?
I said sure,

1006
00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:56.300
let's go to my truck and smoke a bowl during this drunk and stoners session.

1007
00:59:56.301 --> 00:59:58.040
He proceeds to get wet.

1008
00:59:58.390 --> 01:00:00.920
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah,</v>

1009
01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.630
<v 0>yeah.
Can you got to hear that?
So yeah,
listen to it.
You know what your gut was,</v>

1010
01:00:06.631 --> 01:00:10.050
right?
You called them on the shit and he said that he wasn't,

1011
01:00:10.051 --> 01:00:13.320
and I knew it with that fucking line,
but if I ever crossed the line,

1012
01:00:13.321 --> 01:00:16.170
let me know that he was trying to wear you down.

1013
01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:20.130
He was trying to hang in there long enough that you finally just said,

1014
01:00:20.131 --> 01:00:22.650
you know what?
Fuck it.
Uh,

1015
01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:29.790
so basically,
okay.
He proceeds to get worried.

1016
01:00:29.791 --> 01:00:32.160
He goes basically telling me that he knows I'm not gay,

1017
01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:35.850
but I'm the kind of guy he likes and I'm one of his best friends and I was life

1018
01:00:35.851 --> 01:00:40.650
sucks because he's gay.
I just started laughing and saying,
what the fuck?

1019
01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:47.000
I'm too nice of a guy
to say get the fuck away from me.

1020
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:50.660
So I let him finish his thoughts.
He was drunk and being emotional too,

1021
01:00:50.661 --> 01:00:53.330
which was annoying.
He reminded me of my ex girlfriend.

1022
01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:58.100
I'm just glad he didn't start crying.
Anyway,
after what af after he was done,

1023
01:00:58.101 --> 01:01:01.940
I said,
that's great,
but I'm not wired that way.
Sorry.

1024
01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:06.920
He kept going on and on asking me if I'm sure there isn't any secret hidden,

1025
01:01:06.921 --> 01:01:10.820
desired buried deep within me.
Uh,
yeah,
dude,
it's,
it's late night.

1026
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:15.190
It's late at night.
This guy,
he's going all in.
Uh,

1027
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:19.730
I explained to him that if I was doing the same thing to a girl that I had a

1028
01:01:19.731 --> 01:01:20.450
crush on,

1029
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:23.870
I would be considered a creep and that the girl wouldn't want to hang out with

1030
01:01:23.871 --> 01:01:26.180
me anymore.
Dude,
why are you writing me,
man?

1031
01:01:26.181 --> 01:01:30.290
You've got all your handling all of this perfectly.
Um,

1032
01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:33.760
I already failed because the second he got weird and my truck,
I would be like,

1033
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:36.480
<v 1>yeah,
yeah.</v>

1034
01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.710
<v 0>Um,
this was about two months ago and I've ignored him since.</v>

1035
01:01:40.711 --> 01:01:42.720
He called me three times and I ignored them.

1036
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:47.360
Two of the calls were in the middle of the night.
Oh,
Jesus.
One 30 at 2:30 AM,

1037
01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:51.930
which leads me to believe he was being drunk and emotional.
Exactly.
He goes,

1038
01:01:51.931 --> 01:01:54.630
just like a 23 year old girl.
He goes,

1039
01:01:54.631 --> 01:01:57.630
I don't see him at school anymore because I avoid him on purpose.

1040
01:01:57.631 --> 01:02:00.900
My question to you is,
am I doing the right thing?
Yeah,

1041
01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:02.130
you're totally doing the right thing.

1042
01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:09.720
It's just cause you had get both guys and that because he's gay and he's all

1043
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:12.900
like basically in the media,
they're always considered victims.

1044
01:02:12.901 --> 01:02:15.450
If there's any sort of soul,
like you gotta be more accepting.
You know,

1045
01:02:15.451 --> 01:02:18.600
at some point if somebody is making you fucking uncomfortable and you fucking

1046
01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:20.750
address and they still crossed the line,

1047
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:23.480
if that's something you're not comfortable with it yet,

1048
01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.580
fuck off silver beet it,
you fucking creeping me out,

1049
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:34.510
you know?
Anyways,
he goes,
my question to you is,
am I doing the right thing?

1050
01:02:34.511 --> 01:02:37.630
I've never gone out of my way to avoid someone like this except for a girl.

1051
01:02:37.631 --> 01:02:40.810
After I break up with them,
I have no desire to hang out with them anymore.

1052
01:02:40.811 --> 01:02:44.500
It's not that big of a deal.
It's not like a work friend you hang out with,

1053
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:48.340
but then one of you gets a different job and the two of you stop hanging out.

1054
01:02:48.341 --> 01:02:52.550
I do feel bad though because he has had a hard life.
He's the classic Gay Guy.

1055
01:02:52.551 --> 01:02:56.530
I grew up in Texas and was harassed.
The end is hated by his dad.
It sucks,

1056
01:02:56.531 --> 01:02:57.640
but it's not my problem.

1057
01:02:57.850 --> 01:03:00.940
I used to listen to his problems and try to give him advice on life and

1058
01:03:00.941 --> 01:03:04.270
happiness and be a good friend.
But after that whole truck and his incident,

1059
01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.630
I don't want to do that anymore.
Thanks for the help.

1060
01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:11.080
Hope you and the lovely new year.
Have a great day.
Yeah.
No Dude,
you're fucking,

1061
01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:13.960
you handled it perfectly.
You would never a jerk to the guy.

1062
01:03:13.961 --> 01:03:16.720
You told them exactly how you were feeling at the end of the day.

1063
01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:20.000
You had respect for yourself and your own boundaries,
which he didn't sell.

1064
01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.700
Fuck off,
you know?
Yeah.

1065
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:27.500
Teach Amelia teachable lesson fix time.
He has a straight friend,
you know,

1066
01:03:27.501 --> 01:03:32.060
just be,
be a friend.
Don't get high.
Go into his truck and tried to fuck them.

1067
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:35.870
Yeah.
It's pretty straight forward.
Alright.

1068
01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:40.780
Germaphobe bill though.
I can't,

1069
01:03:40.781 --> 01:03:43.960
I don't know leukocyte.
What the fuck does that,
where I gotta look that word up.

1070
01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.220
Said some fucking spaceship.
Is that a,
uh,

1071
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:51.710
I don't know what that means.
I,

1072
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:54.820
I feel like half the podcast is laughing at me and the other half is pretending,

1073
01:03:54.821 --> 01:03:56.530
pretending like they know what the fuck it means.

1074
01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:57.820
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1075
01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:00.480
<v 0>Leukocytes,
a collarless cell</v>

1076
01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:09.620
that circulates in the blood and bodily fluids in is involved in counteracting

1077
01:04:09.691 --> 01:04:14.670
foreign substances and diseases and so I'm a white self though that you didn't

1078
01:04:14.671 --> 01:04:19.050
realize how fucking original that is.
Oh,
by said the word right.
Jesus Christ.

1079
01:04:19.051 --> 01:04:20.010
That was fucking brilliant.

1080
01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:24.360
My Hat's off to you and also ties in with Germaphobe.

1081
01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:25.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1082
01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:28.700
<v 0>You know whenever you get sick you white cell count goes up.</v>

1083
01:04:28.701 --> 01:04:33.240
Do you realize how many fucking levels said installed is working?
Yeah.

1084
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:36.780
Jesus Christ.
Tip of the hat to you.
All right.

1085
01:04:36.781 --> 01:04:40.200
A few days ago I was stretching in the gym with the girl I was dating.

1086
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:44.820
She picked up her phone from a bench,
looked at the screen and said,
God,

1087
01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:46.140
by screen is so dirty.

1088
01:04:46.141 --> 01:04:51.141
And then proceeded to use your tongue to lick the phone screen and wipe it off

1089
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:52.740
with their sleeve.

1090
01:04:57.130 --> 01:04:58.990
What the fuck?

1091
01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:02.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1092
01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.920
<v 0>Jay,
just when you thought getting high with your gay friend and he goes for your</v>

1093
01:05:05.921 --> 01:05:09.550
deck and your truck was the fucking weirdest,
almost uncomfortable thing,

1094
01:05:09.551 --> 01:05:13.460
you were going to Jesus.
He goes,

1095
01:05:13.461 --> 01:05:14.870
I dry heave,

1096
01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:19.960
and she got mad at me claiming that she was a medical student and done things

1097
01:05:20.551 --> 01:05:25.230
like that.
Doing things like that was good for my immune system.

1098
01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:26.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1099
01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:31.170
<v 0>Fucking Med students always got to tell you they are med students.</v>

1100
01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:35.040
He goes,
I couldn't get over it.
I had to get away from her.

1101
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:38.490
Now it's in my psyche that maybe I am a Germaphobe.

1102
01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:41.370
When I use an ATM or Debit Card,
Pin pad,

1103
01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:45.450
I always have to wash my hand touching those things.
Grosses me out.

1104
01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.560
Am I a Germaphobe ps?
How many hands do you shake a day?

1105
01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:54.850
MMM,
no,
dude,
you're girlfriend is a med student,

1106
01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.700
but she's also gross.
That's fucking disgusting.

1107
01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:03.690
This fucking disgusting period.
Okay.

1108
01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:07.530
There's so many other ways where you can just go into the fucking gym is enough

1109
01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.440
to keep your immune system up.
You don't need the lick your phone.

1110
01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:14.790
You fucking pig.
Disgusting.
That's fucking gross.
All right.

1111
01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:18.900
End of story.
No,
you're not a Germaphobe.
You're an intelligent human being.

1112
01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:20.490
That's an,
you know,
you just aware.
Yeah.

1113
01:06:20.491 --> 01:06:24.490
I don't like touching those fucking things.
When I go to the airport,
I got it.

1114
01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.270
I got to get on that little shuttle bus thing and they're like,

1115
01:06:27.271 --> 01:06:29.010
hold on before the fucking thing starts.

1116
01:06:29.011 --> 01:06:33.090
I always pulled down the sleeve of my jacket and I hold onto it like that.
Yeah.

1117
01:06:33.091 --> 01:06:37.860
I don't need fecal matter in mucus and Tj's and God knows what else is fucking

1118
01:06:37.861 --> 01:06:41.940
on that day.
Alright.
Gross.

1119
01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:48.150
You're not a Germaphobe.
All right.
How many hands do I shake a day?
Uh,

1120
01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:51.890
I don't know.
Sometimes zero.

1121
01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:56.000
Sometimes a if I do wish,
I don't,
I don't fucking know.
I,
I know,

1122
01:06:56.001 --> 01:07:00.440
but I go and I wash my hands afterwards and I don't touch my face after I do it

1123
01:07:00.441 --> 01:07:04.340
because I'm afraid I'm going to get pink eye.
But a,
I don't shake a lot of hats.

1124
01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:06.053
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1125
01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:10.610
<v 0>But I will say people love coming out of the bathroom and they'd be like,
hey,</v>

1126
01:07:10.611 --> 01:07:12.240
Belle.
And then shaking your hands.
I,

1127
01:07:12.241 --> 01:07:15.760
I really got to in the moment get better and be like,
dude,
not you just came up.

1128
01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:19.260
Give me the elbow dude.
You just came out of the bathroom.
I don't know you.

1129
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:22.760
I don't know if you're good at washing your hands.
I want to know you like that.

1130
01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:27.170
Alright.
Dilemma.
Hey Bill,
I'll,
that reminds me a long time ago,

1131
01:07:27.171 --> 01:07:31.880
I worked the Improv in Dallas and I pissed off this fucking,
oh,

1132
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:33.890
I think I pissed off this older texts and guy,

1133
01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:36.530
or maybe this was this weird idea of humor.

1134
01:07:36.531 --> 01:07:39.830
He came up and shook my hand right at the end of the show.
I said,
hey man,

1135
01:07:39.831 --> 01:07:42.890
thanks for coming out.
And he just goes,
I just paid

1136
01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:44.960
<v 1>okay.</v>

1137
01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.900
<v 0>That was high.
Oh,
you know,
I'm not gonna do anything with my hand.</v>

1138
01:07:47.901 --> 01:07:52.640
My hand is that you could have your urine on it.
It's fine.
I'm not going to eat.

1139
01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:56.520
I'm just going to shake a bunch of other hands now and they're going to have you

1140
01:07:56.530 --> 01:07:59.520
pee on it and then I'm going to wash my hands and it's going to be off.

1141
01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:02.720
You know what I mean?
You don't think you got,
you just went into the bathroom,

1142
01:08:02.721 --> 01:08:06.410
you know,
have any idea what's on your fucking hands?
Um,

1143
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:09.890
that's now on my hands.
Yeah,
we're all filthy.
Alright.
Dilemma.

1144
01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.660
Hey Bill.
Uh,
so I'm in a bit of a tight situation.

1145
01:08:14.661 --> 01:08:18.530
Me and some were playing to take on taking a weekend trip down to Austin to

1146
01:08:18.531 --> 01:08:21.040
attend a music festival.
My ladies,

1147
01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:25.670
grandma is getting married the same week,
the same weekend as the concert.

1148
01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.160
Obviously I have to pick.

1149
01:08:28.530 --> 01:08:29.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1150
01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:32.260
<v 0>Bye Ladies.
Grandma is getting married the same weekend as the concert.</v>

1151
01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:34.890
Obviously I have to pick which event.
I'm going to a 10.

1152
01:08:36.730 --> 01:08:38.980
Your girlfriend's grandma is getting married,

1153
01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:46.570
but when the fuck did grandma have her mother when she was like 12?

1154
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:52.380
My girl,
there's no choice here.
This isn't a dilemma.

1155
01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:55.320
This is like an obvious,
he goes,

1156
01:08:55.321 --> 01:08:58.740
my girl left a completely up to me with no hard feelings attached,

1157
01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.120
at least from her.

1158
01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:04.470
I'm afraid of upsetting her family by not going to the wedding.
Fuck that.

1159
01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:08.230
Go to the fucking wedding.
Look,
if you're going to marry this girl,

1160
01:09:08.231 --> 01:09:11.890
you have to establish early that you're not going to every stupid fucking

1161
01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:15.610
function you have to do that.
He goes,

1162
01:09:15.611 --> 01:09:18.220
but I should mention that my,
uh,
my girls,

1163
01:09:18.221 --> 01:09:22.270
grandma doesn't really care much for me or so it seems she tells my girlfriend

1164
01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.860
that she should explore her options a bit while she's still young also.

1165
01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:31.270
And I also have not been formally slash officially invited.

1166
01:09:31.570 --> 01:09:33.490
My girlfriend and I had been dating for two years,

1167
01:09:33.491 --> 01:09:36.520
so it's not like I'm a new boyfriend or anything.
What should I do?

1168
01:09:36.521 --> 01:09:39.460
I'd love to hear the lovely knee is take as well.
If she's around.

1169
01:09:39.461 --> 01:09:41.960
Unfortunately she's not around.
Um,

1170
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:43.350
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1171
01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:44.220
<v 0>dude.
Fuck that.</v>

1172
01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:47.040
You go down with your friends and you go to the concert and you have a great

1173
01:09:47.041 --> 01:09:51.210
fucking time.
Okay.
And if this woman doesn't like you,
at the end of the day,

1174
01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:56.070
she's going to die soon.
So who gives a fuck?
Okay.
It gives a shit.

1175
01:09:57.170 --> 01:09:57.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1176
01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:59.230
<v 0>Sound like her mom doesn't like it,</v>

1177
01:09:59.231 --> 01:10:02.560
then that's a problem because she's going to be around and you're going to have

1178
01:10:02.561 --> 01:10:05.620
kids and she's going to fucking show up and it's going to be a big fucking pain

1179
01:10:05.621 --> 01:10:08.620
in the ass grammar.
It gives a fuck.
Right.

1180
01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.570
Should explore her options as she's still running around single and her fucking

1181
01:10:13.571 --> 01:10:17.920
eighties you know,
she's just projecting our own regret of that fucking

1182
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:23.950
oxen driver.
She married back in the 1920s whatever the fuck she did.
Yeah,

1183
01:10:23.951 --> 01:10:27.100
go to the concert.
It's not a dilemma to go to the concert.

1184
01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:28.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1185
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:29.810
<v 0>Just tell your girlfriend.
So you know what?</v>

1186
01:10:29.811 --> 01:10:32.180
I decided I'm going to go to the concert and have a good time at the wedding and

1187
01:10:32.181 --> 01:10:35.120
just fucking leave it at that.
And if she gives you a rough time about it,

1188
01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:39.170
don't bring up the fact that your grant or grandma doesn't like you and blah,

1189
01:10:39.171 --> 01:10:41.510
blah blah,
because then she's going to try and fix it now.

1190
01:10:41.511 --> 01:10:45.980
You guys just need to spend more time together.
Just tell her.
I would just,

1191
01:10:45.981 --> 01:10:47.120
I would rather go to the concert.

1192
01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:49.023
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1193
01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:56.950
<v 0>Yes.
And just leave it at dead.
If she gives you a ton of shit,
just be like,</v>

1194
01:10:56.951 --> 01:10:59.680
listen,
you know,
five buddies,
you do some,

1195
01:10:59.681 --> 01:11:02.670
but you also had plans to go to a concert and he chose to do that.
I,

1196
01:11:02.671 --> 01:11:04.090
I wouldn't give you a rough time about it.

1197
01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:06.760
I would want you to do what was going to make you happy.

1198
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:11.150
I would appreciate it if you extend me the same courtesy.

1199
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.830
Yeah,
I see it now.
I was going to say,
you fucking sound so and so don't,
don't,

1200
01:11:16.831 --> 01:11:19.410
don't,
don't do the last part.
All right.
That's what I would do.
All right.
Okay.

1201
01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.300
There you go.
All right.
That's the podcast for this week.

1202
01:11:21.301 --> 01:11:24.140
Everybody be by de your heads.
Um,

1203
01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:27.710
thank you for listening and thank you everybody.
That's uh,

1204
01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:33.120
you know,
coming out to the shows this weekend at Foxwoods,
um,

1205
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:38.520
you know,
I have some people were talking about,
you know,

1206
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:39.900
the ticket prices and everything.

1207
01:11:39.901 --> 01:11:44.901
I can't control that people go on and buy some of these fucking scalping ticket

1208
01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:47.580
things,
you know,
the stubhub peoples of the fucking world.

1209
01:11:47.581 --> 01:11:49.590
So I got to figure something out with that.

1210
01:11:49.591 --> 01:11:53.340
I Know Louis C K does something where he sells tickets,
you know,

1211
01:11:53.341 --> 01:11:56.250
on his own website.
But my thing is like,

1212
01:11:56.251 --> 01:11:59.160
well then how do you stop them from just going to your website and buying up a

1213
01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:03.150
bunch of tickets and sending the fucking price through the roof?

1214
01:12:03.151 --> 01:12:07.050
Like how do you do that?
Cause I don't want you guys getting fucked over.
Um,

1215
01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:10.530
but I can't tell you this.
If you do go and you do pay through the nose,

1216
01:12:10.531 --> 01:12:13.590
there won't be anybody screaming and yelling and shooting fucking tee shirts at

1217
01:12:13.591 --> 01:12:17.460
you while I'm doing my Dick and shit jokes.
All right?
Okay,
that's a podcasts.

1218
01:12:17.461 --> 01:12:20.610
Go fuck yourselves.
And I'll check in on Thursday.
