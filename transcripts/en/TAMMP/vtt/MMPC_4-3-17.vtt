00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:01.891
Hey,

2
00:00:01.891 --> 00:00:05.040
what's going on is bill burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for

3
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:09.430
Monday,
April 3rd,
2017 was going on ally.
Yeah.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.840
How's it go?
A little white guy.
DEF Jam Voice.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.940
Little white boy side taking you back through a little comedy history.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.050
Remember that the height of black guys.
Do those white guys do that?

7
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:25.260
It was always a house.
I have to have half that fucking voice.
Yeah,

8
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:28.020
I see a wack ass dated a chair.
I'll sit in a chair.

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.180
Oh,
I'm a black guy when he sits to the chase,
sits in the motherfucking GM.

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.350
White Guy said the odd years I have sat out and actually I did like taxes.

11
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.780
Every fucking joke.
Crushed.

12
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.920
Fucking crushed.
That was the black comic version of white guys.

13
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:50.630
Go and talking about flying on airplanes.
I'll comparing dogs to cats.

14
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.650
That's more like it.
You know,
thought your Frat Acada.
It doesn't even fucking,

15
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:58.160
you know,
that's actually still not a complimentary voice for a white guy.

16
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:00.470
But I don't think that was a complimentary voice for a black guy.

17
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:05.390
So I think I'm in the clear when it comes to political correctness.
Um,

18
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.760
oh my God,
what a fucking weekend I had,
man.
I had a great time.
You know,

19
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:14.450
I had a great time.
I watch the fucking Bruins pick up four points this weekend.

20
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.901
All right.

21
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:19.901
And put themselves back into the driver's seat at least of their own destiny.

22
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.490
All right.
By beating the Florida fucking pair.

23
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.650
And thank God the Chicago Blackhawks had the decency to rest.

24
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:34.670
Most of the good guys in their team.
Uh,
we realize he pick up another two points.

25
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:39.140
So thank you to the city of Chicago.
Um,
next deep dishes on me.

26
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:41.270
If I run into you,
not the whole fucking city,

27
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:46.271
just wanting you fatties when are you mustachioed fatties from that SNL sketch.

28
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.080
I don't think I've ever seen a guy with a mustache in Chicago,
you know.
Um,

29
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.190
anyways,
I never heard one say depth heirs,
never heard that,

30
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.850
never heard it.
Um,
although I don't talk to a lot of them,

31
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.240
I just kind of go there and stand in front of their performing and then I leave.

32
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.680
That's basically what I do,
which is one of my favorite things to fucking dude.

33
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.420
By the way,
there's nothing,
there's nothing better than when you do your show.

34
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.390
The second shoot do it.
You get in a car and you get the fuck out of there.

35
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.670
That's my favorite thing to do,
you know,

36
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:20.000
either that or go to a dive bar and hang out like with three people.

37
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.270
That's the way I'm fucking why?
Um,

38
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.670
as perfect be honest with you.
The certain people they like to hang out,

39
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.350
you know what I mean?
Go Wade into the crowd,
you know,

40
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:36.770
continue,
continue to say how awesome I am.
I don't do that.

41
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:40.070
I got it for that hour.
Perfect.
Then you get in the car,
it's nice and quiet.

42
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.400
It's quiet.
It just fucking ride home,
you know,

43
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.140
and you go until you fucking hotel room,
right.
Sit down.

44
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.600
You'll avoid the fucking snack by right.
And uh,

45
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.380
and then that's it.
Then you just sit there and the loneliness of your room.

46
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.080
That's most of the reason why I drink on the road,
to be honest with you.

47
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.180
That's all you do is you just trying to stay out as long as you can see is so

48
00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:11.370
fucking tired that when you get back to your room,

49
00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:15.300
you just immediately fall asleep rather than dealing with the fucking loneliness

50
00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:19.980
of it.
But,
um,
I dunno,
I had such a great weekend man.

51
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.450
I played a little bit of drums,
hung out with my beautiful daughter,

52
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.360
you know,
she's a riot.
She's Bossy as hell.
Oh my God.

53
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.140
She's already telling us what to do with just like the noises that she knows how

54
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:38.310
to make.
Um,
yeah,
she's going to be a little SMAD.

55
00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:42.330
He just like my wife and she's fucking adorable as health obviously,
you know,

56
00:03:42.331 --> 00:03:44.490
I'm a little biased,
but uh,
that's kind of,
you know,

57
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.100
you know when people are lying,
you know,
if what your kit,
Oh hey,

58
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.550
whoa,
what acuity?

59
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.270
I feel like we're getting like legit compliments.
So when it was,

60
00:03:57.271 --> 00:04:00.750
can anybody out there in the hockey world explained to me

61
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.460
like,
uh,
how this,
like,
what's seed you are,

62
00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:10.390
works in the playoff bracket.
Like,
I don't get it because,

63
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.250
um,
it used to be like the Addams division in the Patrick Division and one played

64
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:17.580
for,
and then they sort of jumble them all up.

65
00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:21.960
It seems like when they list them as far as like I don't get,

66
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:25.110
when you go to the stand extinct because I would've thought is as a sixth or

67
00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:27.000
seventh,
see whatever the fuck we're going to be.

68
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.140
We'd either play the capitals or the blue jackets,
you know,
the,

69
00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:32.670
the top of that one.

70
00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:35.100
But they kind of do it in like a march madness thing where it's like we're in

71
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:35.881
like a different thing.

72
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:40.530
So for some reason we'd get off easy or I should say and have to play the maple

73
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:42.240
leafs rather than getting the old right there.

74
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.100
Fred from the capitals of the blue jackets.

75
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.870
Not saying that we're going to beat Toronto,

76
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:47.070
I have no idea what's going to happen.

77
00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:50.550
But according to the Stanley Cup playoffs here on,

78
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.720
on a nhl.com,
um,
as of today,

79
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.480
the moray all Canadians with clothes,
Giulia,
Julianne.
Well,

80
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.890
I would play fucking the New York Rangers.

81
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.320
So then number one seed and then they would get the wildcard New York Rangers,

82
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.760
and then the Bruins would play the maple leafs little original six action there

83
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.650
for you on those,
both of those.
Huh.

84
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.470
Then the capital's would play Ottawa in Pittsburgh plays Columbus,

85
00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:23.910
like Pittsburgh gets punished.

86
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.630
Shouldn't they be playing in easier fucking team with the points they have?

87
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.950
I would think what I'm the bottom feeders,
so that's great.

88
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:35.400
I love that Pittsburgh or the Columbus will knock each other out.

89
00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:39.060
Well not one or the other route I should say.
And uh,
I dunno,

90
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.180
I don't know what's going to cause this is the capitol is finally going to push

91
00:05:42.181 --> 00:05:45.210
through the shift.
Is it finally gonna Happen?
You know,
you know,

92
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:48.710
it'd be the fucking Armageddon finals would be the Washington capitols first.

93
00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:51.990
The San Jose sharks,
you know,
can,

94
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.160
I think one of them has to win,
right?
Like the cubs verse,
the Indians,

95
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.080
somebody got to fucking win.
And I bet it would go down the exact same way.

96
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:02.540
One would go up three to one,
you know,

97
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.640
they just got to add that last bit of misery.

98
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.550
And then someone would come back and win it.
I Dunno.

99
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.400
I Dunno what the fuck I'm talking about.
All I know is I really enjoyed,
um,

100
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.040
obviously this weekend and if we can play the Tampa Bay lightning on Tuesday and

101
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:20.070
fucking put them out of their goddamn misery,
um,

102
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.140
I think we would avoid three years in a row of,
uh,
you know,

103
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.290
eaten at Dick at the end of March,
beginning of April.

104
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.920
We've done it two years in a row.
So,
uh,
that's it.

105
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:33.170
That's it for the fucking hockey talk.
Oh,
by the way,

106
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.930
I don't know what his name is with that kid on Calgary.
Uh,

107
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.330
I keep to chuck his kid out there that kids are fucking riot man.

108
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.200
He's an old school hockey player.
I was watching a,

109
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.840
what do they have there with the fucking Don Cherry hockey night in Canada.

110
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:54.080
We actually get that down here and he was showing a highlight of that kid,

111
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.500
you know,
picking on that dude from the fucking cakes at Don Cherry's break.

112
00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:03.230
It is fucking balls and it's just like they try and make the playoffs.

113
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.630
He's not going to get involved in some stupid fucking fight.
Right.
They,

114
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.050
they too dowdy and he,
they need him on the ice,
I would think anyways,

115
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.370
to doubting the Dave Grohl of fucking,
uh,
of hockey.

116
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.781
To me,
they're the,

117
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:21.080
they're the exact same fucking person when Dave Grohl is not making amazing

118
00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:24.980
music,
he's playing defense for the Los Angeles kings.
A challenge you,

119
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.810
I challenge you to find Dave Grohl ever at a fucking game where we're,

120
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.250
where drew dowdy is not a healthy scratch.
Um,
all right,

121
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:38.110
enough of that bull shit.
Um,
I can't even tell you what about my fucking weekend.

122
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.160
Some of this other bullshit.
Oh my God,
I hung out with them.

123
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.690
If I hang out with just like a complete fucking psychopath.
Uh,

124
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.840
it's one of those social events you like,
oh no,

125
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.570
the area is dairy is,
um,
and then it's over and then it's the next day and like,

126
00:07:56.571 --> 00:08:00.110
oh great.
You know,
God willing,

127
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:01.850
I'll never have to see that person again.

128
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.520
Hey,
how the fuck are the Celtics and number one seat?

129
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:10.810
I didn't watch in the last two weeks.
I kind of got,
you know,
you know,
foot,

130
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.180
fucking hockey and basketball,
he kind of got like a pick a sport,
you know,

131
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.310
I've been,
you know,
I've been trying to watch both of them,
but,
um,
the,

132
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.510
the Bruins were just in a more,
uh,
you know,
I dunno.

133
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.130
Precarious position.
So it was more of a exciting thing to watch.

134
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:31.820
Are they gonna fuck this up?
Are they going to somehow pull themselves out of it?

135
00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:34.010
And uh,
somehow the Celtics or a number one seed,

136
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:36.920
although I don't think they're a better team than the Cavaliers,
but,
uh,

137
00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:41.210
I like what Lebron did the other night last night when he got into it on the

138
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:44.210
court and that made that other dude on his don't team flipping out,

139
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:45.200
yelling at him and shit.

140
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.200
He immediately tried to diffuse it and then was just saying,
yeah,

141
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:51.260
I showed him up.
I shouldn't have said that.
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I was like,

142
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:55.940
that's a
right there.
Even though a lot people don't like him.

143
00:08:55.941 --> 00:09:00.350
I fucking like Lebron.
Um,
so anyways,
do it.

144
00:09:00.351 --> 00:09:01.460
I've just been having like,

145
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:02.770
<v 1>okay,</v>

146
00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.100
<v 0>I know I gotta get back into fucking meditating.
I Dunno,</v>

147
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.750
I'm just keep running into these situations.

148
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.660
Like I feel like I'm attracting that to me.

149
00:09:10.661 --> 00:09:12.970
Like somebody this in New York number has been calling me.

150
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.280
<v 1>Okay,</v>

151
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.570
<v 0>I like the last fucking three days and then I'm like,</v>

152
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.310
I don't know who this number is so I don't answer.

153
00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:23.090
And then they finally leave a messages to say,
Yay,
this is showing shawl.

154
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:27.650
You know,
I'm looking for so and show.
But it keeps saying,
ah,
you know,

155
00:09:27.651 --> 00:09:31.610
this is Belle la all the time,
the thing.
But my phone is saying,
you know,

156
00:09:31.611 --> 00:09:36.540
it's my daughter.
So I'm like,

157
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:40.320
all right,
well this guy is going to figure this shit out.
Right.
And he does it.

158
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.500
So he filed right before I did the podcast,
he fucking calls against.

159
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:46.830
So I finally picked up,
I got hello.
The guy's like,
yeah,

160
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:49.440
we'll always just said I'm talking to.
I'm like,
well,

161
00:09:49.441 --> 00:09:52.950
it's not who you think it is.
Yeah,
you got the wrong number.
And he goes,
yeah,

162
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.300
well fuck you too.
He hangs up on me like,
like it was my fault.

163
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.890
So I just laugh and I'm just like,
what the fuck?

164
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.810
Why does this shit keep happening to me?
So then he calls back and I'm like,
well,

165
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.110
I got to hear what this guy's going to say next,
right.

166
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.620
I need a new hour of material.
I got to put myself in the line of fire here.

167
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:17.220
So I picked up,
it goes,
Yay man.
I'm sorry man.
I just,

168
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:20.430
I lost my phone and I keep trying to call my daughter and you know,

169
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.430
my name's bill and it keeps saying your names bell and it's,

170
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.410
you got to see the humor in that,
right?
I'm like,
yeah man.
It's said,
say yeah,

171
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:33.230
it's a funny situation.
Uh,
good luck to you on your phone.
I don't know.

172
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.480
I don't know what to tell you.
It sounded like a nice enough person.

173
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.630
I love that he said,
yeah,
well fuck you too.

174
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:42.780
When he still had the fucking nerve to call me back and then just say,

175
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:44.910
act like it didn't even,
he didn't say that.

176
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.670
Maybe it was just joking when he said it.
And it's just like,

177
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.020
I don't fucking know.
So anyways,
this past week,

178
00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:54.500
so I'm at a social event,

179
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.420
I'm trying to avoid this psychoed Ian's up sitting right next to me and I'm

180
00:10:57.421 --> 00:10:59.190
talking to this guy and for fucking 10 minutes,

181
00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:01.110
all of a sudden I can't find my cell phone.

182
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:02.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

183
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.750
<v 0>And I'm looking forward and I'm looking forward and I'm not bringing it up to</v>

184
00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:08.210
anybody cause I'm thinking like maybe I left it in the car.
I don't know what.

185
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:13.570
And I realized that this psycho has placed his cell phone exactly right on top

186
00:11:14.301 --> 00:11:16.910
of mine on the table.

187
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:17.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

188
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.280
<v 0>Like completely lined up in mine has a black case and was kind of dark so I</v>

189
00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:23.114
couldn't see it.

190
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:24.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

191
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:28.290
<v 0>And then I had to sit there playing this fucking mind game.
Like,</v>

192
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.640
did this guy do this on purpose?
Am I over analyzing this thing?

193
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.050
Am I out of my fucking mind?
And uh,
I dunno,
did it,

194
00:11:37.051 --> 00:11:38.910
the whole thing just struck me as funny.

195
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

196
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.380
<v 0>Thinking of how my life used to be,</v>

197
00:11:42.381 --> 00:11:45.350
cause I used to have people like that in my fucking life.

198
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.940
You know those people that mind fuck you.
And then like an hour later,
hey,

199
00:11:49.941 --> 00:11:54.390
how sorry I was,
can I hear that?
That fucking wife beater relationship,

200
00:11:54.391 --> 00:11:58.410
you got to get into them.
Ah,
yeah.

201
00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:02.300
Which is course how the,
the evening ends with that bullshit.
Oh yeah,
it is.
I'm,

202
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.320
yeah,
no,
it's all right.
Everything's cool.

203
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.670
And I just walked out of there and it just felt like this fucking weight lift

204
00:12:08.671 --> 00:12:11.490
off me.
Just be like,
I'm never going to see that person again.

205
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.420
I have no fucking desire.
That is it.

206
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.550
That is a fucking Rep.

207
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.720
If I've learned anything from hanging out with fucking,

208
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.730
uh,
uh,
cop,
I have two good friends of mine that are both half Sicilian.

209
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.290
And um,
when applied correctly,
the Sicilian,

210
00:12:34.291 --> 00:12:39.270
you're dead to me when applied correctly is the greatest fucking,

211
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.340
it just streamlines your life.

212
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.980
Why would you waste another second of your life playing that mental tennis.

213
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

214
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.500
<v 0>Which sounds like you obviously don't connect with this person over and you just</v>

215
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:56.380
walk away and then that's it.
And like today I just woke up.

216
00:12:56.381 --> 00:12:59.650
I was in the greatest fucking mood knowing I'm never going to see that person

217
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:01.660
again.
It's fucking tremendous.

218
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.780
And you know what I think then I created a void.

219
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:09.100
I created a vacuum in my life cause I just let go all of that shit.

220
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:13.780
And now I got this random guy calling me up on my cell phone looking for his

221
00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:18.490
daughter and then telling me to go fuck myself.
You know,
I'll take that.
I mean,

222
00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:21.100
that's an easy one.
That guy actually sounded like a better fucking person.

223
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.870
So anyways,
Oh,
you know what?
Easter's coming up fucking Easter.

224
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:30.340
It comes Peter Cottontail,
Hobbit,
dad,

225
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:35.240
the bunny trail [inaudible] is on its way.
Um,

226
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.490
I,
uh,
I get this week we're going to actually,

227
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.440
at some point we're going to go back to the mall of become a fucking mall
person.

228
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.990
I'm,
I imagine eventually it's going to,
uh,
it's gonna drive me nuts.
But,
um,

229
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:50.940
we're going there.

230
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.710
We've taken our daughter over it to get a picture with the Easter bunny.

231
00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:57.520
How fucking cute is that?
It's going to be absolutely adorable.

232
00:13:57.521 --> 00:14:00.520
I can't wait to do it.
So we just have to carve out some time.

233
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.583
<v 1>MMM,</v>

234
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.470
<v 0>yeah.
I'm already nervous that she's going to get totally fucking freaked out.</v>

235
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.700
You know what I mean?
The older you get,
the more you look at that.

236
00:14:10.701 --> 00:14:14.630
You just realize why.
What is that bizarre ritual?

237
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.710
You know,
why would you do that too?
Sorry,
my stomach is grumbling.
Yeah.

238
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:23.420
I'm fucking on a massive diet here.
Massive diet,
massive diet,

239
00:14:23.421 --> 00:14:25.160
cutting out the booze except the last night

240
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:30.860
cutting out the booze a been eating basically perfectly.

241
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:31.970
And uh,

242
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:37.420
I'm actually down to a buck 79 I fight and waits between like one 68 one 72 and

243
00:14:38.991 --> 00:14:41.230
a,
I'm from going to try to lose two to three pounds for that.

244
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.040
And I figured by mid May,

245
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.420
mid May I ought to be in fighting shape and I'm going to try to actually stay in

246
00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:49.040
that and continue because what I,
you know,

247
00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:53.090
what I do is I get down to the way I wanted to get down to and then that's like

248
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:57.420
the end of the movie roll credits and I go back to eating fucking pizza,

249
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.530
beer and all of that shit.
And then I slowly get back up again.

250
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.230
And next thing you know,
I'm standing shirtless in a mirror,

251
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.520
just calling myself every horrible name and the in that I can think of,

252
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.680
you know,
top of fuck something.

253
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:14.240
I've never even heard anybody say.

254
00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:17.590
I actually called myself that before I started this diet.
Um,

255
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.580
I actually have suits that I can't fit into anymore.

256
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.500
Like I've hit that point in my,
in my life and,
uh,

257
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.630
it's just like I can't,
I can't,
uh,

258
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.680
I can't be the guy that goes to the fucking dry cleaner to have his suits let

259
00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:36.560
out.
You go to the tailor and you just basically saying,
listen,
the food one,

260
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.270
I quit.
I quit.
I don't want to fucking do this anymore.

261
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.160
So,
um,
anyways,
I did a,

262
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.400
I just been doing,
I've just been doing cardio.

263
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.220
My fucking shoulder's getting better.
I can't really lift weights or anything,

264
00:15:52.221 --> 00:15:56.690
so I've just been kind of just stretching,
doing cardio and,
and,
and uh,

265
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.160
and trying to eat right.
I try to eat like from nine to five and then just stop.

266
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.800
Uh,
but the other night I was doing that,
uh,

267
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.940
April foolishness for Kevin and being who I want to thank for having me on that.

268
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.950
We did it down at the,
uh,
the shrine auditorium,
uh,
which is a famous,

269
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.410
um,
theater out here.
What the fuck's going on with their brain?

270
00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:21.620
I came and think here.
I actually went on Wikipedia.
That's what happens.

271
00:16:21.621 --> 00:16:24.260
I was trying to look at some of this other shit's in this advertising after
read.

272
00:16:24.261 --> 00:16:26.930
I literally get like anxiety as I look at it.
Like,
Oh God,
look along.

273
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:27.930
His fucking copy is,

274
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.520
I'm going to read all that as I'm trying to talk to you guys.
My apologies.

275
00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:32.480
I was distracted there.

276
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.410
So I played the shrine auditorium for Kevin had been show,
uh,

277
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.310
April foolishness every year that raises money for,
um,

278
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.020
I think it's premature babies.
I believe that's what it is.

279
00:16:42.021 --> 00:16:44.930
I never know what it is.
I always ask right before I go on,

280
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:50.130
what is this cause for so I can steer clear of going out there like what's

281
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.450
premature babies show,
I guess let it die or something.
You know this,

282
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.850
not walking into that.

283
00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.590
So we were at the shrine auditorium and I went up on Wikipedia,
went up,

284
00:17:00.591 --> 00:17:02.000
I went to it on,
uh,

285
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.130
on the Internet there and I found out that that is the place,

286
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:09.890
the most legendary thing that I saw that happened at that place,

287
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.310
aside from like the grateful dead and all these guys doing shows was that was

288
00:17:13.311 --> 00:17:17.900
the place where Michael Jackson's shot the Pepsi commercial and it had his hair

289
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:22.730
lit on fire.
His Jheri Curl,
you know,
when he was slowly at the beginning,

290
00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:27.080
was the beginnings of transforming into a white guy.
Um,
you know,

291
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:31.430
I dunno if it was the,
the product he had,
if it was a Jerry curl,
if it was a con,

292
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.080
I don't know what he had going on.
Okay.

293
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:37.880
I don't know how that mixes with Pepsi and flammable ship at all.

294
00:17:37.881 --> 00:17:41.300
I know is his head lit on fire.
And um,

295
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.750
he got second degree burns and that was it.

296
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:49.010
And all these fucking people look like crying.
They were terrified.

297
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.860
You know that this tremendous artists,

298
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:57.890
his head caught on far his fucking head caught on fire doing a Pepsi commercial.

299
00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.430
That was another groundbreaking thing that he did like cause back in the day,

300
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:07.431
if you were a any sort of a famous person and if you did a commercial you would

301
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:12.720
just consider it a complete sellout,
at least in the white world.

302
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.270
I don't know how it worked.
He kind of was a hybrid though.

303
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.670
He treats sort of the first Caitlyn Jenner,

304
00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:19.590
but he didn't like it or in a race way,
you know,

305
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.010
like the way he walked out the door and dude and came back a woman,

306
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.810
he walked out the door,
black guy,
it came back,
a white guy.
Um,

307
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.770
I mean I can't imagine being friends with that guy every time he would leave you

308
00:18:35.771 --> 00:18:40.080
need just come back.
He was like a shopaholic,
but like for his face,

309
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.330
you know what I mean?
You know,
he's six always come about.

310
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:46.830
Well it's coming back with like a new bag,
you know what I mean?
Or some fucking,

311
00:18:46.831 --> 00:18:51.040
I dunno what shoes or some shit.
He would do the same thing.
But with his face.
Uh,

312
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.880
yeah,
Bell,
he was one of those famous people ever.
We know what he did.
Okay.

313
00:18:53.881 --> 00:18:57.990
Anyways,
plowing ahead.
Um,
so,
um,

314
00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:02.310
I got to do that show down at the shrine auditorium and I cannot even begin to

315
00:19:02.311 --> 00:19:06.720
tell you what a fucking great time.
I had unbelievable crowd.

316
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.340
Like I didn't do a half hour at the end of all these other monsters going out

317
00:19:11.341 --> 00:19:15.180
there,
fucking killing it the entire night.
And Steve,
oh,

318
00:19:15.181 --> 00:19:19.920
did a hilarious fucking stunt.
Fucking hilarious.
And a,

319
00:19:19.921 --> 00:19:23.490
I got to go on like at the end of all this shit and do a half hour and it was

320
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:26.580
fucking effortless.
That's how great the crowd was.

321
00:19:26.581 --> 00:19:30.240
So I want to thank everybody who came out for that wonderful causes that I

322
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:35.241
believe was for a premature kids.

323
00:19:35.431 --> 00:19:37.350
You guys like the birds chirping in the background.

324
00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:38.940
Somebody mentioned to me that is fucking hilarious.

325
00:19:38.941 --> 00:19:43.720
Listen to be going off on shit with birds chirping.
I usually don't do,
uh,

326
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.040
um,
do my fucking podcast in this room.

327
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.010
I just do it because it's the furthest one away from my daughter asleep.
And,

328
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.310
you know,
I don't want to hear me dropping all the f pumps.
So anyways,

329
00:19:53.311 --> 00:19:57.680
the end of the show comes,
right?
Yeah.
Everybody's shaking hands.
Oh,

330
00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.810
you a great now you a great,
no,
I like how your mind works now.

331
00:20:00.811 --> 00:20:04.350
I like how your mind works better.
You know,
we're all doing the Hollywood thing,

332
00:20:04.351 --> 00:20:08.010
right?
Everybody had a good set.
And uh,

333
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.930
once again,
I ran into one of these crazy fucking parents,

334
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:18.660
right?
This is fucking hilarious.
This is what this person did.
They said,
oh,

335
00:20:18.661 --> 00:20:21.360
congratulations on your daughter.
And I said,
Oh,
you brought it up.

336
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.330
You brought it up.
Now I got to show you a picture.
Right?

337
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:29.400
So her and her husband is standing there,
right?
The young young people,

338
00:20:29.401 --> 00:20:33.210
right.
They look like they're single.
They don't even look like they have kits.

339
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:38.220
And I,
I just show him the picture and she just goes,
uh,
yeah.

340
00:20:38.221 --> 00:20:42.690
It's so easy.
He see,
it's so easy.
It's so easy.
She said,

341
00:20:42.691 --> 00:20:45.510
pointing my kid going,
it's so easy.
I'm like,
what the fuck is she talking about?

342
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.530
I've heard she's adorable.
She's cute.
Oh my God.
Look at those cheeks.
She's got a,

343
00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:55.060
yeah,
it's so,
it's so,
yeah,
I see.
He see,
it's so easy.
I'm like,

344
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:59.350
what do you mean it's so easy?
She goes,
she goes,
we have three,
we have three.

345
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:02.080
It's so hard.
You have no idea itself.
And just,

346
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.320
she used my daughter's picture as a way to launch into how fucking difficult her

347
00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:12.130
life was.
First of all,
it's like how fucking difficult is your life?

348
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.340
The two of you look like you've been paying 90 exit needs.

349
00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:18.700
You guys don't have an ounce of fat on you.
You don't have bags under your eyes.

350
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:23.770
It's Saturday night.
You're out at a show.
Neither one of you yawning.

351
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.620
And they were gone.
Yeah,
we had one and then,

352
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:31.210
and then we got pregnant again and then we had,
we had,
and I was going like,
oh,

353
00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:34.070
and I'm sitting,
I'm trying to be empathetic.
Oh yeah.
You know,
I hear a,

354
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:38.650
I hear too is like a game changer.
And then three,
it's like you're outnumbered.

355
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:43.480
She goes,
oh no.
We went from one right to three like we had.
We had,

356
00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.720
we had twins next w two kids.

357
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.940
I don't even know what that feels like.
We don't even know what that feels like.

358
00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:53.850
It's just like,
you know what?
You don't know what?

359
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.860
You don't know what it's like to be in a fucking log cabin with no fucking heat

360
00:21:56.861 --> 00:22:00.340
like they had 20 years ago.
It's fucking hard.
The Fuck Outta here.

361
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.060
I swear to God like I,
and people like that.
It's just,

362
00:22:04.061 --> 00:22:06.070
I just feel bad for their kids.
It's like you have to be,

363
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:10.590
you gotta be a fucking terrible parent.
What can,
a person has a kid,
right?
And,

364
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.300
and all I do when I see other people's kids is,

365
00:22:13.301 --> 00:22:16.900
I just think of how much that person must love that kid.

366
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.240
They have to feel the same way that I do about my kid.

367
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:20.380
And then I'm happy for him.

368
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:24.970
Who the fuck looks at somebody else's kid and just and compares like,
Oh,
it's so,

369
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.310
it's so easy.
Yes.
See it's the,

370
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:34.800
and then I go,
yeah,
you know,
while we're thinking of having another one and then,

371
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.680
then the guy goes,
yeah,
just have one gone out to war first of all.

372
00:22:38.681 --> 00:22:42.940
Like you can control it.
Oh,
they drive me up the fucking wall.
I fucking,

373
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.060
I'm going to say it.
I fucking hate parents.
Generally speaking.

374
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.660
I cannot stand them.
They liked,
they like fucking martyrs.

375
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.980
They like these fucking,
it's like you put yourself in this situation,

376
00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.870
shut the fuck up.
You have three people that are going to be sad when you die.

377
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.950
They're actually going to give a shit and they're gonna show up and say how

378
00:23:02.951 --> 00:23:07.300
great you are.
It where it isn't that enough?
Uh,
so hard.

379
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.800
You have no,
I'll really with IPADS,
it fucking 200 channels of cable.

380
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.680
You can put them in front of a fucking plasma TV.

381
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:19.310
It's like looking into a tropical fish tank all day for him.

382
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:25.250
Yeah.
This soft,
you know what I mean?
I,
I don't,
I just,

383
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.191
Oh God,

384
00:23:27.191 --> 00:23:30.080
there's so many times in my life like I wish I could just go back like that I'm

385
00:23:30.081 --> 00:23:32.830
doing you believe in or not.
I'm great in the moment on stage.

386
00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:36.730
I'm so bad at it when I'm off stage,
you know what I mean?
I'm just,
you know,

387
00:23:36.731 --> 00:23:39.640
cause I immediately just get to this anger level and then I end up looking like

388
00:23:39.641 --> 00:23:42.420
a psycho.
Like I wish I just said that to him.

389
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.410
Like you guys sound like terrible parents.

390
00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.070
Do you want to put your kids up for adoption?

391
00:23:47.071 --> 00:23:50.190
So maybe you can go back to doing blow or whatever the fuck it is that you miss.

392
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.350
Do you know back and wish I could go back to last night and just tap that guy in

393
00:23:59.351 --> 00:24:02.380
his shoulder and just point at his cell phone on top of mine and just be like,

394
00:24:02.381 --> 00:24:05.470
you know,
on a psychological level,
would you like to explain this to me?

395
00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:09.940
How did this happen?
Was this by accident?
But I don't,

396
00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:11.140
I don't fucking say anything.

397
00:24:11.141 --> 00:24:14.610
And then I just fucking write people off and then they look at me like I'm out

398
00:24:14.611 --> 00:24:17.710
of my mind,
which I am.
I'm definitely out of my mind,
but I'll tell you right now,

399
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.190
I'm not the only one.
I am not the only one.

400
00:24:21.191 --> 00:24:25.940
And I have learned that I learned that this weekend.
Oh,

401
00:24:25.941 --> 00:24:29.190
so you see,
it's so easy.
It's so,
it's like,

402
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.290
why would you say you don't have any fucking idea?

403
00:24:31.291 --> 00:24:34.230
Imagine if I had a special needs kid and you've pointed is saying it's so easy.

404
00:24:34.231 --> 00:24:38.220
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Oh,
that's right.
You're completely self involved.

405
00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.230
Ah,
ah.
It felt good to get this up.
Oh Jesus.

406
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.430
I'm glad I didn't say I'm glad I saved the for the podcast,

407
00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:51.360
but wouldn't the podcast be better if I actually started saying these things to

408
00:24:51.361 --> 00:24:53.840
people?
So then I would have the confrontations and then I could just,

409
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.660
maybe I could then do a two hour podcast.
Hey,
who knows?

410
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.220
Who knows?
So you know,
I,
as I mentioned earlier,

411
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.110
are the last podcast I got.
Um,
I finally got Sirius Satellite Radio in my car,

412
00:25:07.111 --> 00:25:11.220
so I'm fucking listening to the 80s channel,
the 70s channel Nhl.

413
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:16.170
You know,
I listened to all be show Jim Norton's fucking show.

414
00:25:16.171 --> 00:25:19.110
And I finally listened to Howard Stern for the first time and fucking forever.

415
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.580
And um,
he had Craig Ferguson on and Craig Ferguson was going on and on about the

416
00:25:23.581 --> 00:25:27.870
Chapelle fucking special.
I got to check it out.
He was going on and on.

417
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.230
It might be that great one I've ever seen.
I'm like,
well fuck,

418
00:25:31.231 --> 00:25:34.950
I gotta check that out.
I got to fucking check that one out.

419
00:25:34.951 --> 00:25:37.890
But half of me does not want to watch it because I know it's going to be,

420
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.030
I don't want to feel like,
oh my God,
uh,

421
00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.690
certain people you'll watch to get inspired.
I can't watch you shit.

422
00:25:45.691 --> 00:25:47.100
Cause I'd be like,
Oh God,
I suck.

423
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.850
Really the gap is still that large,

424
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.180
you know,
every once you know,

425
00:25:54.181 --> 00:25:56.780
every once in a while you think you're fucking Hendrickson and you realize you

426
00:25:56.781 --> 00:26:01.560
just played a Ukulele.
Right?
Isn't that what happens?
Isn't that what life is?

427
00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:07.460
Um,
anyways,
let me,
uh,
let me just read a little bit of the advertising here.
Uh,

428
00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:12.480
it's unbelievable.
It's the greatest special I've ever seen.

429
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.020
I was just like,
Jesus Christ.
All right.
Pro Flowers,
everybody.

430
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.990
Have you ever forgotten your anniversary?
Uh,
yeah.

431
00:26:21.991 --> 00:26:26.370
To be honest with you right now,
I would gifts you asked me.
I would be,

432
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:31.380
I'm 80% sure of my anniversary date,
but fortunately I married a person who also,

433
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.940
we don't,
we can never,
uh,

434
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:39.810
we don't really remember the day that we met.
We don't have a day for that.

435
00:26:39.811 --> 00:26:44.030
And we,
like this year we were just,
what's,
what's

436
00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.340
<v 1>our wedding date again?
Okay.</v>

437
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:51.320
<v 0>See 11th,
right?
No,
12th no,
11 1111.
Yeah,</v>

438
00:26:51.321 --> 00:26:56.320
it's 11.
Um,

439
00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.200
but if,
I don't know if you married some,
I dunno,
accountants,

440
00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.320
if you married an insecure account,
they know what the date is.
Right.

441
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:07.730
Have you ever forgotten your anniversary?
If you're nodding yes,
you're lying.

442
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:09.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

443
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.770
<v 0>Right.
Well,
how do you figure that,
you know,</v>

444
00:27:11.771 --> 00:27:14.500
those people that are just hard to shop for?

445
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:15.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

446
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.540
<v 0>Wait,
what the fuck state if you,
have you ever forgotten your anniversary?</v>

447
00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:20.160
If you're nodding yes,
your line.

448
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

449
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:23.180
<v 0>Well,
I wasn't nodding,
but I have,</v>

450
00:27:23.181 --> 00:27:27.130
I've actually booked myself on my anniversary weekend because I forgot.

451
00:27:27.131 --> 00:27:29.480
I just don't think that,
I just think,
oh,

452
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:34.510
every other week I go on the road and if it lands on that week,

453
00:27:35.091 --> 00:27:39.640
then I wasn't out then.
It's just,
you know,
I don't know.

454
00:27:39.641 --> 00:27:43.180
Evidently pro flowers,
I don't know teachers,
so they fucking psychos.

455
00:27:43.181 --> 00:27:45.940
Are they going to put this cell phone on top of my cell phone anyway?

456
00:27:45.941 --> 00:27:49.720
She know those people that are just hard to shop for like your wife or your

457
00:27:49.721 --> 00:27:54.490
anniversary or your sister for her birthday.
It's just the worst.
Trying to fit.

458
00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.980
Find A,
find a gift that that a,

459
00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.330
you know they'll like and B won't cost an arm and a leg.

460
00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.140
All right?
First of all,
that's what the fuck they want.

461
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.720
They want something that they're going to like and they also want something

462
00:28:07.721 --> 00:28:11.950
that's going to cost an arm and a leg pro flowers stop acting like this is like

463
00:28:11.951 --> 00:28:16.390
a substitute for a gift.
All right?
You are the fucking appetizer.

464
00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:19.510
This is a great appetizer getting flowers,

465
00:28:19.511 --> 00:28:22.750
but if you think you get a fucking every year just to get your wife flowers,

466
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:26.710
hey touch,
thanks for hanging in there.

That's how I feel for you.

470

557
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:49.490
They change it a little bit and then the new fucking blades don't fit it and

588
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:42.780
the patriots meat might be talking to Adrian Peterson.
Huh?
If you're a fucking,

589
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.170
I don't know if been watching the patriots for a long time.

590
00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:48.210
Doesn't that remind you when we signed Corey Dillon,

591
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.090
that'd be nice to get that fucking guy.

592
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:55.480
Wouldn't maybe see Tom Brady get number six.
Right?

593
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.650
So he said,
he said he wanted to play for another five or six years.

594
00:35:58.651 --> 00:36:01.480
It's fucking unbelievable.
Um,

595
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.490
just the fact that he's going to do that means he's going to play for at least

596
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:10.450
another three.
So He's,
he canceled legitimate shot and get another ring.
Um,

597
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:17.070
unreal.
Unreal.
Good Lord.
I fucking enjoy that.
All right.
Because every time,

598
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:19.080
every year he plays,
I always think this could be the last year.

599
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:23.190
It could be the last fucking year.
You know,
Bella check is almost 70 years old.

600
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.360
Brady's going to be 40,
you know,
and you know,
oh,
we're going to fucking,

601
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:30.930
what's going to happen on that franchise when those two people leave?
Who knows?

602
00:36:30.931 --> 00:36:35.460
Because what's his face?
Robert Craft is three coaching hires.
Bill Parcells,

603
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:40.240
Pete Carroll,
Bill Bellacheck,
he's three for three.
Um,

604
00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.660
all right,
let's read some of these,
uh,

605
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:47.520
some of these emails for the week.
Um,
girl freaks out.

606
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.140
Hey there,
Billy boy George.
Um,
it was funny,

607
00:36:52.141 --> 00:36:56.200
I never liked him when I was in the,
uh,
in the 80s,
you know,

608
00:36:56.201 --> 00:36:59.280
it was two homophobic to like that guy.
But uh,

609
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.070
he's fucking drummers to shit on there.

610
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:06.260
Do you really wanna hurt be love the fucking drums on that song.

611
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.440
Um,
anyways,
not sure if you saw this shed.

612
00:37:10.441 --> 00:37:15.441
Some girl freaked out at a yogurt shop in Santa Monica because the couple behind

613
00:37:15.511 --> 00:37:16.740
her kissed each other.

614
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.720
She starts saying that she was being sexually harassed by them doing so it gets

615
00:37:21.721 --> 00:37:22.650
out of control.

616
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:27.000
The funny thing is that she starts off acting like a hacky liberal,

617
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:31.980
but then ends acting like a hacky conservatives as she shifted through stages of

618
00:37:31.981 --> 00:37:36.780
emotion.
Uh,
the Phoenix video tour video look great.
Can't wait for San Jose.

619
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.990
Um,
yeah,
I actually,
I watched some of that at first.

620
00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:43.460
I love this woman because I hate people who fuck,
I don't hate.

621
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.920
I hate looking at people making out in public.
It's fucking gross.

622
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:51.660
It's fucking gross.
You tongue jammed down each other's throats.

623
00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:57.330
You know,
it's like he,
I don't want to look at,
especially when I'm around food,

624
00:37:58.530 --> 00:37:59.820
I totally get what she's saying.

625
00:37:59.821 --> 00:38:02.660
But then she took it too far when she started saying that she was,
uh,

626
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.370
that she was being sexually harassed.

627
00:38:05.371 --> 00:38:08.930
What I did love though is I love how the extreme closeup,

628
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.980
when she's yelling into the camera,
it reminded me of that movie misery.
You know,

629
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.390
where the lady's like,
he can't wait or whatever the function says.

630
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:22.740
Was there anything more satisfying in a fucking movie?

631
00:38:22.741 --> 00:38:25.380
When he finally got to the bed and started slamming that bitches head against

632
00:38:25.381 --> 00:38:29.880
the floor,
uh,
just laying there that powerless.
Do you know,

633
00:38:29.881 --> 00:38:30.451
in the book,

634
00:38:30.451 --> 00:38:34.620
she actually cuts his feet off rather than breaking his goddamn ankles.

635
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.360
Um,
I gotta be honest with you.

636
00:38:37.361 --> 00:38:41.930
I really think I could have sweet talk my way out of that bed.
I really would've,

637
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:46.780
I would act like I wanted a fucker.
You know,
I would've done that.
Right.

638
00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.930
I would have told him that I was never going to leave her.

639
00:38:49.931 --> 00:38:54.010
I would have built her fucking up until I started to be able to walk around.

640
00:38:54.011 --> 00:38:58.030
Right?
And then I would actually am once I could even was south.

641
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:01.930
This is how long of a slow play I would go with that woman.
I would actually,

642
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.250
I would,
after I could walk,

643
00:39:03.251 --> 00:39:07.210
I would stay in a three month relationship with the till she got so fucking

644
00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:08.110
comfortable.
Right.

645
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:10.930
And then one day I'd be making my famous fucking scrambled eggs.

646
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.400
Take out a fucking it.

647
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.110
That would be it,
man.
I would,

648
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.950
I would stay in a relationship with that woman until the fucking snow melted,

649
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:29.260
you know,
and I could shake off whatever thing I had to,
they have fucking,

650
00:39:29.261 --> 00:39:32.680
or I could shake that off.
I'm German Irish.
I could fucking,

651
00:39:32.681 --> 00:39:35.890
I could put that in a box and never think of it again.
No Pun intended.

652
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.650
That's what I would've done.
He fucked up.
You know what I mean?

653
00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:40.300
He actually wrote the real fucking book.

654
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:41.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

655
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.980
<v 0>I guess I that's cause I know that she was out of her mind,
but I swear to God,</v>

656
00:39:44.981 --> 00:39:48.220
I would've fucking
hour to told her that.

657
00:39:48.221 --> 00:39:51.490
I love what she did with her hair,
all of that thing.

658
00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:54.370
The hardest thing would have been,
was not laughing.

659
00:39:54.371 --> 00:39:57.880
The noises that she would have made during intersects,
intersects,
intercourse,

660
00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:03.220
intersects.
Um,
anyways.
I don't know what that says about me,

661
00:40:03.221 --> 00:40:04.870
but you know,
I,
that's,
that's how would it got out of it?

662
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.990
I would have just gone totally like,
oh yeah,
yeah,
the she beautiful.
Oh my God,

663
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.360
this soup is fucking delicious.

664
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.950
And I would've just talked to her and just find out what the exact fucking book

665
00:40:14.951 --> 00:40:17.170
she wanted me to write.
And that's exactly what I would have written.

666
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:18.890
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

667
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:23.380
<v 0>Maybe I hit her with a typewriter,
like some sort of symbolism.
I know,</v>

668
00:40:23.381 --> 00:40:24.760
but at the end of the day,
you know,

669
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:28.690
fucking some pig versus getting both of your fucking ankles broken.
I mean,

670
00:40:28.691 --> 00:40:32.900
I don't think there's a,
there's really no tradeoff.
Right?

671
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:34.873
<v 1>MMM.</v>

672
00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.910
<v 0>You probably won't need,
she's such a fucking lunatic.</v>

673
00:40:37.911 --> 00:40:41.300
She's probably like asexual.
You probably don't have to do that.
You know,

674
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:46.520
just laugh at her jokes.
I think you would have been our right.
Um,
anyways,

675
00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:50.600
I just went on a tangent there.
Sorry about that.
Uh,
here we go,
girl.

676
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:53.420
So when he was getting back to that.
Yeah.
I don't like when,
uh,

677
00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:57.650
I don't like watching people make out.
It's fucking gross.
Me,
I hated him.

678
00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:02.540
The two things I hate most in movies is when people are fucking making out and,

679
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:02.960
and,

680
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:07.850
and people when they're eating in a scene in the fucking making those fucking

681
00:41:07.851 --> 00:41:12.851
noises is nothing worse than watching an actor in a scene because most times

682
00:41:13.191 --> 00:41:16.280
they're not eating.
So they have to overact eating and everybody,

683
00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.380
I don't know what happens.
They turn into fucking animals.

684
00:41:18.381 --> 00:41:19.820
They started eating with their mouths open.

685
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.890
They start pointing at people with the bread.

686
00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:23.993
<v 1>MMM.</v>

687
00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:29.540
<v 0>That and I,
I hate love scenes in movies.
You know what I mean?</v>

688
00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.890
Like when they take it to the point where literally one actor is on the other

689
00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:36.830
actors titties,
it's just like,
I get it.
They're going to have sex.
Like,

690
00:41:36.831 --> 00:41:39.830
why are you going to take it to this level?
Are you making a porno now?

691
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:44.110
I want to watch a porno.
I just want you to fucking porno blanket.

692
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.910
You just have a walk in the bedroom and he's like,
close the door.
I get it.

693
00:41:46.911 --> 00:41:47.744
They fucked.

694
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:48.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

695
00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:52.580
<v 0>Like who is that for
away?</v>

696
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:59.500
They're always up against a wall.
It's fucking raining out or some shit.

697
00:41:59.501 --> 00:42:00.334
You know what I mean?

698
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.123
<v 1>Okay.</v>

699
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.040
<v 0>Rather than they're getting used to each other,</v>

700
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.380
figuring out which lip to go for.
Do you go for the top lip or the bottom lip?

701
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:11.090
You know what I mean?
What position do you like?

702
00:42:11.091 --> 00:42:14.180
Do you like to have your ass slapped or not?
All that shit's out of the way.

703
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.420
They just automatically start acting like they've been banging each other the

704
00:42:17.421 --> 00:42:18.254
whole summer.

705
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

706
00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:23.800
<v 0>Little bit.
Call that whatever fucking songs they play.</v>

707
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:27.970
What are some of the students in the 80s they always played that stupid for

708
00:42:27.971 --> 00:42:30.610
saxophone.
The saxophone got ruined in the 80s

709
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:32.000
<v 1>okay.</v>

710
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:32.761
<v 0>It went from this,</v>

711
00:42:32.761 --> 00:42:37.761
like it went literally from this instrument that when it was in the hands of a

712
00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:38.601
black person,

713
00:42:38.601 --> 00:42:43.601
it actually scared the CIA to the 80s where it just meant that Tom Cruise was

714
00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:45.470
going to fuck somebody.

715
00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:51.380
You know,

716
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:55.580
half of those jazz guys and the fucking from the forties 50s and 60s ad their

717
00:42:55.581 --> 00:43:00.480
fucking phones bugged by the Goddamn j Edgar Hoover and the FBI.
And then this,

718
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:05.500
it just somehow it just all went to shit in the 70s it all went to shit and the

719
00:43:06.081 --> 00:43:08.390
fucking seventies you know,

720
00:43:08.391 --> 00:43:13.130
they whacked everybody that they needed to whack in the 60s they figured out how

721
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:17.780
not to lose public support of a war after the debacle of Vietnam.
Right.

722
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.300
And so now they've got everybody,
everybody's got wives.
What?
Trump's I,

723
00:43:20.301 --> 00:43:22.680
you fuck Trump.
Trump.
I fought everything I said,
he's a boy.

724
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.610
Who does it support the troops.
They're on our team.

725
00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.360
But the bridge is,
they've now morphed that into,

726
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:34.080
you cannot criticize the war if you do or anything that the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,

727
00:43:34.081 --> 00:43:35.960
the,
the head Pentagon is doing,

728
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.830
because now you're criticizing some 18 year old who's over there fighting for

729
00:43:39.831 --> 00:43:41.510
your freedom.
It's fucking brilliant.

730
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:46.540
And we should've seen this coming with what happened to the saxophone in the 80s

731
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:52.700
all right.
Girlfriend says I'm stagnant.
Oh,
Jesus.
Oh Dude,

732
00:43:52.701 --> 00:43:54.020
that's a major red flag.

733
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

734
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:59.800
<v 0>Uh,
hey bill,
you tiny Tim looking red nose.
Pecker head.</v>

735
00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:05.330
Okay.
Who is tiny Tim again.
Oh,

736
00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:08.930
tiny tips down ugly motherfucker with the Ukulele.
Jesus Christ.

737
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:13.490
Wow.
He looks like if somebody beat the shit out of George Washington.

738
00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:17.720
Thank you.
Wow.
That one really hurt.
Anyways,
uh,

739
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:21.650
maybe I'll pull a Michael Jackson and get a cleft in my chin.
Uh,
love you.

740
00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:25.130
Love your podcast,
but you wrote you love your podcast.

741
00:44:25.131 --> 00:44:28.910
Even though I never get any advice.
Uh,
will you give me some?

742
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.040
I have l this is somebody who's not going use any punctuation.

743
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:36.560
This is all one sentence.
Loved you Paul.

744
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:39.660
Maybe this person's foreign loved you podcast.

745
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:43.320
Even though I never get any advice.
Will you give me some advice?

746
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:46.740
Will you give me some?
I have this girlfriend I really like.

747
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:51.210
That's all one sentence.
We worked together at the local restaurant.

748
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.420
I was fine until I got fired.

749
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:59.460
Then I got into a fight with my girlfriend's sister's boyfriend.

750
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.020
Got that?
No,
I don't.

751
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:03.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

752
00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:07.570
<v 0>All right.
Let me,
let me try to break this down here.
All right.</v>

753
00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.820
You have this girlfriend you really like.

754
00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:13.900
We worked together at the local restaurant.
I guess everything was cool.

755
00:45:13.901 --> 00:45:18.340
And then you got fired and then you got into a fight with her,
with hers.

756
00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.150
Her sister,
her sister's boyfriend.

757
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:23.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

758
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:25.350
<v 0>Okay.
So your girlfriend at work,</v>

759
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.580
you got new fight with her sister's boyfriend and then you got fired from the

760
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:32.580
Tgi Fridays,
whatever the fuck he did.
All right.
Am I back on board then?

761
00:45:32.581 --> 00:45:34.260
I got a DWAI

762
00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.280
driving while alcohol influenced,
I dunno,
I don't,

763
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.690
I don't know what the fuck's going on here.
Um,

764
00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:49.540
I and I feel like a complete loser and sometimes it gets me depressed also.

765
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:51.470
I still give her rides to work,

766
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:55.700
which she tells me means nothing and also says she loves me,

767
00:45:55.970 --> 00:46:00.650
but it's been getting meaner every day.
I don't get a job.
All right,

768
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.513
well,
okay,

769
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:04.820
well the defensive or you have to understand what the woman that if you're not

770
00:46:04.821 --> 00:46:05.900
bringing in money,

771
00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:11.060
you just literally have your like a 40 year old teenager at that point.

772
00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:14.540
You're just like a big kid.
She has to deal with,
um,

773
00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:16.551
you know,
and women,

774
00:46:16.551 --> 00:46:19.340
they're all feminists until they have to start paying for everything.

775
00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:20.990
You know what I mean?

776
00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:27.280
Like what's fucked up with sexism and all that and that guys have better paying

777
00:46:28.761 --> 00:46:30.260
jobs.
Evidently.
I have no idea.

778
00:46:30.261 --> 00:46:31.910
I've never asked people what the fuck they make the,

779
00:46:31.911 --> 00:46:35.120
let's just say what they're saying is true.
Um,

780
00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.880
what's fucked up is,

781
00:46:37.881 --> 00:46:41.840
is it now created this thing where women can date and like you're,

782
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:46.820
you're always for the most part,
dating up.
You know,

783
00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:47.751
if you're,

784
00:46:47.751 --> 00:46:52.220
if you have reasonable fucking looks okay and you had a reasonably good

785
00:46:52.221 --> 00:46:55.940
childhood and for whatever,
you're not migrating towards fucking losers.

786
00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.513
All right?

787
00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:03.010
You can actually always be in a situation where getting married is a good thing

788
00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:04.880
cause the other person makes more money than you.

789
00:47:04.881 --> 00:47:07.760
So even if the whole fucking thing falls apart,
you're going to get the house,

790
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:11.450
you're going to get the child support,
you're going to get the alimony.
Right.

791
00:47:11.451 --> 00:47:15.620
Only lately are we finally starting to see women having to do that.

792
00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:20.120
And it's fucking hell.
Like they freak the fuck out.
Like what

793
00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.760
a woman paid alimony was.
If like I all of a sudden got my period and I'm like,

794
00:47:25.761 --> 00:47:29.430
wait,
I got to do this now.
What the fuck?
Right.
Um,

795
00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:33.290
anyway,
so anyways,
let's,
let me get back to the fucking thing here.
I keep,

796
00:47:33.291 --> 00:47:37.310
I keep going on tangents here.
I need to stay focused.
Um,
so,
okay,

797
00:47:37.311 --> 00:47:40.400
so you got a Dui,
right?
And she still gives me a shit.
Okay,

798
00:47:40.401 --> 00:47:42.440
so now you're not making any money,
so you know,

799
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.400
<v 1>okay,</v>

800
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.680
<v 0>then you're all depressed and you don't have a car.</v>

801
00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.850
So I'm guessing you're not really looking for a fucking job or maybe she's just

802
00:47:49.851 --> 00:47:52.340
meaning shit.
I don't know.
Anyways,
he said,

803
00:47:52.341 --> 00:47:55.130
I've never had trouble getting work when I needed it,

804
00:47:55.131 --> 00:47:59.060
but now I feel like a lazy piece of Shit.
My girlfriend called me stagnant,

805
00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:02.600
stagnant,
and told me she's worried.
She said tonight,

806
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:05.750
she would see me later then changed it to,

807
00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:10.460
or talk to you later and trailed off,
muttering some inaudible bullshit.

808
00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:14.930
I need to pay my rent tomorrow.
Uh,

809
00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.700
and I basically broke as fuck.

810
00:48:16.701 --> 00:48:20.270
I gave her a key to my place and she agreed to pay half the rent.

811
00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:21.460
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

812
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.550
<v 0>but I feel like I'm twisting your arm to do it.
Yeah.
Dude,
what are you doing?</v>

813
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:29.620
I feel stagnant to and depressed and she makes it hard to think sometimes.

814
00:48:29.621 --> 00:48:32.320
So I secretly bought a train ticket to California,

815
00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:39.830
so I secretly bought a train ticket to California from New York that leaves in

816
00:48:39.831 --> 00:48:42.620
two weeks.
I'm debating whether to stay here,

817
00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.830
keep looking for a job in a debt economy.

818
00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.700
Try and work things out with my girl.
I'm sorry guys.

819
00:48:50.701 --> 00:48:52.240
Like this is not me here.

820
00:48:52.241 --> 00:48:56.760
If this is how this is written and face the music by paying thousands of fines

821
00:48:56.761 --> 00:49:01.140
and traffic tickets while I'm broke as fuck or go with a couple of hippie

822
00:49:01.141 --> 00:49:04.800
friends hikes through,
through like he threw a ball,

823
00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:09.980
the state of California while stopping to work on woofing farms in between

824
00:49:10.291 --> 00:49:14.040
journey.
It's just like Jack Kerouac Shit.
I don't know.

825
00:49:14.041 --> 00:49:18.210
I'm starting to think this isn't real to stay or to go.
I don't know.

826
00:49:18.211 --> 00:49:21.600
But if she calls me stagnant again,
I'll be out in over the horizon.

827
00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.620
I feel bad and I don't know what the fuck to do.
So any advice is appreciated.

828
00:49:25.621 --> 00:49:28.710
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Yeah.
First of all,
all right,

829
00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:33.960
let's just eliminate the woman from all of this.
Okay?
Uh,

830
00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:35.730
you need to pay a traffic ticket stew.

831
00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:37.410
If you think you're just going to walk away from that,

832
00:49:37.411 --> 00:49:38.880
you're going to end up doing jail time.

833
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.430
A buddy of mine did that and K and they put them in county,

834
00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.790
which you don't want to be in because that's all different levels of fucking

835
00:49:44.791 --> 00:49:45.900
people's least in La.

836
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:51.930
That's like rapist lunatics like their own kid on fire right down to a,

837
00:49:51.931 --> 00:49:55.680
yeah,
I had a bunch of traffic tickets and it,
it got to such a f,
well,

838
00:49:55.681 --> 00:49:59.010
my traffic ticket,
you didn't know a traffic ticket.
He had a DUI and he,

839
00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.700
he didn't show up to court.
Maybe you won't go to jail.
I don't know.

840
00:50:02.701 --> 00:50:03.090
But it's just,

841
00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:07.200
it's going to be a fucking nightmare and this can be hanging over your head and

842
00:50:07.201 --> 00:50:08.910
then you're going to have to try to work under the table,

843
00:50:08.911 --> 00:50:11.280
which is going to cause you not to fucking pay taxes.

844
00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.710
It's going to be a nightmare.
So,
um,

845
00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.440
I dunno,
I would,
uh,

846
00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:20.260
<v 1>okay.</v>

847
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.670
<v 0>I would reach out for help is what I would do and I,</v>

848
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.900
it doesn't sound like your girlfriend wants to do it anymore.

849
00:50:25.901 --> 00:50:28.090
You haven't told me how long been unemployed,

850
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:33.040
but it sounds like she's at the brink of being fed up with you.
But,
uh,

851
00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:37.180
you did get into a fight.
You did get fired,
you did drink and drive.

852
00:50:37.181 --> 00:50:42.181
So you're making a bunch of bad moves and it's not her fault that she's trying

853
00:50:43.121 --> 00:50:46.210
to envision a future with you.

854
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:51.100
And all she's seeing is that she's going to work while you're boozing it up and

855
00:50:51.101 --> 00:50:53.800
she has to support you.
And I'm going to go out on a limb here.

856
00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:56.740
I don't like speaking for the ladies,
but I'm going to go out on a limb and say,

857
00:50:56.741 --> 00:50:59.020
I don't think a lot of women are looking for that in the future.

858
00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.180
So I would man up.

859
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:05.080
You need the man the fuck up and realize that you are stagnant.

860
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:07.480
He needed to get your shit together.
All right?

861
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:10.930
I don't know what you have to do to find a fucking job.
That's a difficult thing.

862
00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.470
But um,
I dunno.
Can you ask your parents for some help,
baby?

863
00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:15.940
You fucking leave your apartment,

864
00:51:15.941 --> 00:51:19.270
moved back in with your parents while you get through this.
Your bottom,

865
00:51:19.271 --> 00:51:23.230
the fuck out.
You sober up.
You start working out with the old wage.

866
00:51:23.231 --> 00:51:27.390
She left in your parent's garage.
You find a fucking job.
Alright,

867
00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:30.670
get on a payment plan with your fucking tickets and all of that shit.

868
00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:34.930
Get all of that off the table.
Maybe even break up with your girlfriend.

869
00:51:34.931 --> 00:51:35.920
Get your shit together.

870
00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:40.870
Create a whole new fucking you and maybe you get a new girlfriend that's beyond

871
00:51:40.871 --> 00:51:41.321
the level.

872
00:51:41.321 --> 00:51:43.960
This one here that was working at the fucking restaurant or whatever the hell

873
00:51:43.961 --> 00:51:47.680
you are at,
all right?
But just know this,
you sound like you're still young.

874
00:51:47.681 --> 00:51:51.490
You got your whole life ahead of you and you know you're,

875
00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:55.600
what you're doing is you're giving into your situation rather than fucking

876
00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:59.140
picking yourself up off the mat.
All right?
So get up off the floor.

877
00:51:59.141 --> 00:52:01.570
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
All right.

878
00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:04.600
You have all the power in the world that turned that thing around.
All right?

879
00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:09.850
And uh,
that's it.
Get a job.
Pay Off your tickets and uh,
you know,

880
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.810
see what happens with that woman.
You know,
maybe she's not the one.
Maybe she has.

881
00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:18.550
Who knows who gives a fuck,
but work on your life.
Work on yourself.
There you go.

882
00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:22.780
All right,
girlfriends,
ultimatum and out.
Jesus Christ.
Here we go again.

883
00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:25.990
Hey,
Billy bonk,
my girlfriend,

884
00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:29.770
a parentheses of over one year recently gave me an ultimatum.

885
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:34.810
We'd are her.
I chose,
we'd all right.

886
00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:38.380
There's a person who knows what he likes.
Did you say that?

887
00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.240
Did you say that in the moment?
Did you wait a few days?

888
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:44.400
Did you mull it over for at least a few minutes.

889
00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:46.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

890
00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:50.950
<v 0>Sick of your pot smoking.
Okay.
I know that,
you know,</v>

891
00:52:50.951 --> 00:52:55.150
I said earlier that I was okay with it,
but the truth is I'm not,

892
00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:59.050
you're high all the time.
I think it's affecting you and it's just,
I,

893
00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:02.020
I'm to the point,
I can't do this anymore.

894
00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.500
So you need to make a choice.

895
00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:12.070
It shows me or you choose marijuana.

896
00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:18.280
What's it going to be?
I'm gonna choose the weeds,
sweetheart.
See you.

897
00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:24.000
She's going to slowly walk with their head down out the fucking door.

898
00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:29.010
It have gone down like that.
Anyways.
However,
as I perceived it,

899
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:32.790
it was a choice of reason versus absurdity,
not her verse.

900
00:53:32.791 --> 00:53:37.590
We'd allow me to defend myself.
Absolutely,
Sir.
You have the floor.

901
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:41.940
Um,
or man,
you know,
this might be a lesbian relationship.

902
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:45.300
My girl and I started smoking together about two months ago.

903
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:49.740
She was never big on it,
but I was a self admitted pothead in the past.

904
00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:54.590
We started smoking a couple months ago and her request,
uh,

905
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:59.100
we would smoke one or two hits per night before bed will last night.

906
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:02.580
She decided that she didn't like smoking weed anymore because she doesn't like

907
00:54:02.581 --> 00:54:05.820
the feeling of being high.
Apparently in that same moment,

908
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:10.940
she became morally opposed to the idea of marijuana and she proceeded to call me

909
00:54:11.251 --> 00:54:15.810
an addict that has a serious problem and in a grand dramatic gesture,

910
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:19.380
she flushed my remaining weed down the toilet.

911
00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:24.360
It made me choose her or we'd wow,

912
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:27.930
that escalated as they say an anchorman.
Uh,

913
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.350
she kept pointing at me and Lelani yelling,
look at yourself.

914
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:34.380
You're so high right now.
Keep in mind,

915
00:54:34.381 --> 00:54:37.350
I took one hit out of a one hitter.

916
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:42.960
I called bullshit on all of our arguments because as long as I've known her,

917
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:48.140
she has never had a problem with weed and would often encourage me to use it

918
00:54:49.171 --> 00:54:51.960
because it does reduce my anxiety and temper.

919
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:57.120
She often brags about her ex boyfriend's selling weed and her ex husband's

920
00:54:57.121 --> 00:55:00.180
smoking every day and it not being an issue.

921
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:02.190
All right.

922
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:06.910
I was kind of hearing her argument to those last fucking two sentences while

923
00:55:06.911 --> 00:55:11.530
this person,
this is a fucking retread year with,
Huh Jesus.
Uh,

924
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:14.020
you got her out of the Recycle Bin there,
Huh?

925
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:17.730
I is soy assumed this wasn't about weed,
but something else.

926
00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:21.780
I assume it's the result of me telling her months ago,
oh,
here we go.

927
00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:27.020
That I wouldn't be with her if she continued to drink because she had a serious,

928
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.330
seriously unhealthy relationship with alcohol.

929
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:35.130
So I imagine she's trying to use this as her chance to play holier than thou

930
00:55:35.131 --> 00:55:37.650
card for the record.

931
00:55:37.651 --> 00:55:40.500
I don't want to smoke weed all day slash every day.

932
00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:41.970
It's the principle of the thing.

933
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:45.620
But now my relationship is riding on this thing and I don't want,

934
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:51.050
I don't want to do what is riding on this thing and I don't want to do,

935
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.970
I think it's riding on this thing that you don't want to do is think what you're

936
00:55:53.971 --> 00:55:56.730
trying to say.
What are your thoughts?
Help a brother out.

937
00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.630
Do I want to deal with this crazy level of hypocrisy forever.
Thanks.

938
00:56:00.631 --> 00:56:04.380
And Go fuck yourself.
Um,
I don't think so.
No,

939
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:08.850
I don't think so.
Uh,
and they detached way that you're able to talk about her.

940
00:56:08.851 --> 00:56:11.340
And you never once said that,
you know,
I really love her though.

941
00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:14.070
You never said that.
So,
um,

942
00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:19.560
it sounds like she had a rough childhood that led into alcohol abuse and to her,

943
00:56:19.561 --> 00:56:23.950
uh,
picking some really fucking,
so we're a winners here.

944
00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:26.420
Drug dealers and fucking,
uh,
I don't know Mike.

945
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:30.870
I don't know what her ex husband did,
but he smoked every day.
Um,

946
00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:36.440
yeah,
I think,
uh,
the way you tell it,

947
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:40.580
it doesn't sound like a rational person.
So,
um,
on the other side,

948
00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:44.360
I will tell you there are a lot of people that's get high every day and don't

949
00:56:44.361 --> 00:56:48.680
think that they have a problem.
Whereas if you get drunk every day,

950
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:53.600
people call you a drunk and say,
you know,
you have a problem.
Um,

951
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:57.470
I have a couple friends of mine that did that for a good 20 fucking years and

952
00:56:57.471 --> 00:57:00.080
they paid the price.
Um,

953
00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:04.070
smoking weed every single fucking day.
It's like everything.

954
00:57:04.071 --> 00:57:05.600
He wouldn't want to eat ice cream every day.

955
00:57:05.601 --> 00:57:09.380
You'd be a fat fuck your drink booze every day.
You're going to have a bad liver,

956
00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:15.560
gallbladder,
gin,
blossoming,
fucking alcohol is brutal.
And I actually,
you know,

957
00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:18.110
now that I've finally been educated a little bit on weed,

958
00:57:18.111 --> 00:57:21.020
I really do believe it's way,
way worse.

959
00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:26.570
It definitely ages you way,
way,
way more.
Um,
then we does.

960
00:57:26.571 --> 00:57:28.100
But I don't think like,
you know,

961
00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:33.080
wake and bake people and people who need weed to fall asleep.

962
00:57:33.081 --> 00:57:37.340
I know it helps with anxiety and shit like that.
And obviously,
you know,

963
00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.990
pain of chemotherapy,
it's got a lot of great things.
But I,

964
00:57:39.991 --> 00:57:42.650
I when it really comes down to is,
if it's not,

965
00:57:42.651 --> 00:57:44.480
if you feel it's not affecting your life,

966
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:47.360
then I would just continue to do what you're doing.

967
00:57:47.361 --> 00:57:50.300
But it's something that as an adult,
you know,

968
00:57:50.301 --> 00:57:53.240
when you move out and your parents aren't there to fucking question your

969
00:57:53.241 --> 00:57:58.100
behavior,
you really have to,
I feel be extra tough on yourself.

970
00:57:58.101 --> 00:58:01.130
Like I drank way too much last year,
way too fucking much.

971
00:58:01.131 --> 00:58:04.520
So I'm glad that I kind of have it back under control and even,

972
00:58:04.521 --> 00:58:09.230
I probably drank way too much.
Um,
so I'm trying to look at that type of shit.

973
00:58:09.231 --> 00:58:11.540
And you know what's funny?
When I,
when I don't drink,

974
00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:13.070
<v 1>okay.</v>

975
00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:13.431
<v 0>You know,</v>

976
00:58:13.431 --> 00:58:18.431
I'm more apt to take a hit of weed because I'm just used to having a little bit

977
00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:20.510
of a buzz every couple of days.

978
00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.840
So then I that always whenever I quit drinking,

979
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:26.510
then there'll be like a two week period that if somebody has,
we'd,
hey,

980
00:58:26.511 --> 00:58:28.820
you want to hit,
I'll actually take a hit and I'd never smoked weed.

981
00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:34.280
But then after that,
then I,
then I just,
you know,
I just don't like weed.

982
00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:36.980
I'm just not into it.
And uh,

983
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:38.820
<v 1>yeah.</v>

984
00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:41.190
<v 0>Then after like two weeks,
then I just kinda just don't do anything.</v>

985
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.830
And then that's when I start getting into shape again.
So whatever,
I think,

986
00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:49.650
you know,
you sound pretty level headed and you never said you loved there.

987
00:58:49.651 --> 00:58:51.690
So I would get out of that.
That sounds like a fucking,

988
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.920
you'd really have to like the amount of baggage she sounds like she has.

989
00:58:56.850 --> 00:59:01.680
You know,
me marrying a fucking alcoholic.
I mean that's just,
that's,

990
00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:05.100
that really takes a fucking saint if you're sober.

991
00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:10.020
Sort of,
I dunno.
I Dunno why you'd want to put yourself through that.

992
00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:11.473
All right.

993
00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:15.570
That's their issue to fucking deal with and you've got to be selfish when you

994
00:59:15.571 --> 00:59:17.790
want to find the right person.
So there you go.
All right.

995
00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:22.780
Older lady wants to bang.
No,
Jj,
Jj,

996
00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:28.300
here's to you Mrs. Robinson.
All right.
Hey Bill.

997
00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:33.330
I am a 22 year old senior at college just outside of Baltimore and I'm a big fan

998
00:59:33.341 --> 00:59:35.050
of you stand up the podcast.
Well thank you.

999
00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:38.080
I caught your show when he came to Baltimore and he absolutely killed it.

1000
00:59:38.081 --> 00:59:40.690
Thank you again.
Anyways,
I wanted to,

1001
00:59:40.691 --> 00:59:45.691
I wanted your advice as it relates to an older fucking lady.

1002
00:59:47.410 --> 00:59:50.620
Um,
so just to give you a little background,

1003
00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:53.680
last summer I decided to get in shape.

1004
00:59:53.770 --> 00:59:58.690
I developed a nice workout routine and subsequently lost 40 pounds and really

1005
00:59:58.691 --> 01:00:02.950
built up some muscle.
As a result,
women have been showing me a lot more,

1006
01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.970
showing a lot more interest in me.
They had go turned it around.
Good field.

1007
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.843
I'm happy for you.

1008
01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:11.770
And I have definitely had more confidence with talking to women.
All right,

1009
01:00:11.771 --> 01:00:14.410
we'll keep going.
Keep going.
Keep going and keep shooting for the moon.

1010
01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:18.460
Talk to those chicks you think are out of the Audio League.
See what happens.

1011
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:19.361
Anyways,

1012
01:00:19.361 --> 01:00:23.680
now I've been using some dating apps and have met and hooked up with more women

1013
01:00:23.681 --> 01:00:28.090
than I have ever have before.
Not Bragging.
It's just the facts.
All right,

1014
01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:32.380
well I'll be using a condom there.
Fucking Studley.
Um,

1015
01:00:32.381 --> 01:00:34.870
so recently,
and this may sound weird,

1016
01:00:34.871 --> 01:00:39.760
I ran across this incredibly attractive 50 year old woman on one of the dating

1017
01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:44.320
apps and liked your profile.
Just kind of as a joke.
No,

1018
01:00:44.321 --> 01:00:46.420
you didn't.
You were attracted to her.
It gives a shit.

1019
01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:49.270
She is a classic example of a cougar.

1020
01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:53.950
She's like Mrs. Robinson from the graduate or that a horny bitch from sex in the

1021
01:00:53.951 --> 01:00:57.760
city who just fucks everybody.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1022
01:00:57.761 --> 01:01:02.410
They're most one dimensional character ever.
Kim Cottrell's character.

1023
01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.220
It's just fucking every fucking line.
It's like,
I get it.

1024
01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:11.200
You fuck a lot of guys.
Does anybody ever just,

1025
01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.310
there has to be a youtube video where everybody just put all those lines from

1026
01:01:15.311 --> 01:01:18.400
the entire fucking series.
It's like,

1027
01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:19.960
<v 1>okay</v>

1028
01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:24.150
<v 0>my,
uh,
my knee,
I used to watch the thing all the way back when it was on.</v>

1029
01:01:24.151 --> 01:01:26.440
Like why don't we were still living in New York and we were living together in

1030
01:01:26.441 --> 01:01:28.750
this apartment.
I would just be in the other side of the apartment.

1031
01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:33.340
She'd be watching it and anytime Kim controls character would say something,

1032
01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:38.110
I would always be in the background.
I would just go cause she's a whore.

1033
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:47.440
Um,
anyways,
he says,
much to my surprise,
I matched with her.

1034
01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.220
Uh,
I don't know what that means.
So she hit you back basically.

1035
01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.190
She's surprisingly sexually aggressive now.

1036
01:01:54.191 --> 01:01:57.370
It isn't women fucking by their mid thirties.
They know what the fuck they want.

1037
01:01:57.371 --> 01:02:00.190
They don't give a shit anymore and clearly wants to fuck me.

1038
01:02:00.191 --> 01:02:04.510
She sends me messages all the time and talks about how she likes younger men.

1039
01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:07.930
Of course she does.
She does want a bank,
some fucking old bastard like me.

1040
01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.980
She followed me on snapchat recently and started sending me nude pictures.

1041
01:02:11.981 --> 01:02:15.670
And Shit.
The Blake now,

1042
01:02:15.671 --> 01:02:17.200
at least in my experience,

1043
01:02:17.201 --> 01:02:20.580
young guys always joke about the prospects of fucking a cougar.

1044
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:22.770
All my friends are saying I should just fuck her,

1045
01:02:22.771 --> 01:02:25.830
but I can't shake the feeling that there's something fucked up about it.

1046
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:30.060
Is that weird that she's over twice my age?
What are your thoughts on this bill?

1047
01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:34.050
Should I fucker or is it a bad idea?
Let me know.
Thanks to go fuck yourself.

1048
01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.710
Oh Sir.
This is going to be a great lesson for you.
Um,

1049
01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:43.260
how old did you say you were?
22.
Okay.
I will tell you this,

1050
01:02:43.261 --> 01:02:45.630
and it took me into my early forties to learn this.

1051
01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:52.010
There is no way to ever overemphasize the importance of listening to your gut.

1052
01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.950
Listening to your gut will will.
I'm telling you,

1053
01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:03.990
when your gut just tells you,
man,
this doesn't feel right.
You fucking walk away.

1054
01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:10.080
Walk away every fucking time,
okay?
Unless it's like,

1055
01:03:10.081 --> 01:03:12.540
it's something that,
you know,
it's some sort of stage fright thing,

1056
01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:14.790
some sort of anxiety thing that you have to get over.

1057
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:17.370
You're not afraid of fucking women.
Okay?

1058
01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:21.030
Now all of a sudden this woman's coming and this is fucking failing that you

1059
01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:24.840
failed the saint rights.
It just fucking walk,
walk,

1060
01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.330
walk away.
Okay.

1061
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:32.490
What kind of a fucking 50 year old is sending naked pictures to somebody have to

1062
01:03:32.491 --> 01:03:36.990
fucking age.
All right.
Now I know this day of hyper feminism,

1063
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:42.000
they'll say that that's actually brave.
It's this.
It's that.
It's empowering.

1064
01:03:42.001 --> 01:03:44.900
It's fucking pathetic because all you have to do is slide it over.
If a,

1065
01:03:44.901 --> 01:03:48.390
if a guy was sending Dick pics to a 22 year old chick,

1066
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.710
see what I'm saying?
You know what I mean?
This is like

1067
01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:58.720
whatever.
Anyways,
yeah dude,
fucking walk away.
That's it.

1068
01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:02.820
You know that's a fucking train wreck and your gut is telling you that and you

1069
01:04:02.821 --> 01:04:06.000
need to just listen to your gut.
All right?

1070
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:09.330
When you go into a job interview and you just fucking sitting across the person,

1071
01:04:09.331 --> 01:04:12.290
they're talking to you,
I'm telling you,
beyond just interviewed,

1072
01:04:12.291 --> 01:04:14.580
you're going to get a sense.
I swear to God,

1073
01:04:14.581 --> 01:04:19.410
I took a meeting one time with somebody and the second I met this person,

1074
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.390
I just didn't like him and there was something about them.

1075
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.820
They felt sleazy and I got this joke,

1076
01:04:23.821 --> 01:04:27.570
thief vibe from him and I immediately stopped telling stories and all that shit

1077
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.970
and I ended up going and I just was like,
wow.

1078
01:04:29.971 --> 01:04:31.530
I thought I really wanted to meet that person.

1079
01:04:31.531 --> 01:04:33.960
Then I met him and they weren't where I thought they were going to be and then I

1080
01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:36.300
talked to like two or three people about them.
They're like,
yeah,
that guy,

1081
01:04:36.301 --> 01:04:40.170
he's got a,
he's got a fucking rep for stealing shit.
I'm telling you,

1082
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:45.240
you got to listen to your gut.
It will give up.
That's how you,
how you end up,

1083
01:04:45.241 --> 01:04:48.320
not in the trunk of a serial killers car is you.
God's going to tell her,
hey,

1084
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:51.780
you know I don't give a fuck if this person has a flat keep driving.

1085
01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:56.190
You're going to feel it.
You're going to feel that weird thing.
So good feel.

1086
01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.450
Don't do it.
All right,
here we go.
All right,
let's read the last thing here.

1087
01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.600
Overrated,
underrated.
Uh,

1088
01:05:03.601 --> 01:05:08.370
hey you Bruin love and fuck Boston Bruin love and fuck it.
Sure you get it right.

1089
01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:12.980
The original Bruins.
Now like the Ucla Bruins who came later,
um,

1090
01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:13.853
overrated.

1091
01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:18.120
Sidney Crosby is the most overrated I can think of.

1092
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:21.930
I'll give me a fucking break,
dude.
All right,

1093
01:05:21.931 --> 01:05:24.860
so he scored a lot of goals against your team is what I'm guessing.
Anyways.

1094
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:29.100
He said I wished his cock Sasha cocksucker would be held accountable for just

1095
01:05:29.101 --> 01:05:31.250
one of the ridiculous fucking antics.

1096
01:05:31.251 --> 01:05:36.251
He polls this bag of shit most recently jams is sticking to Ryan O'Reilly's nuts

1097
01:05:37.591 --> 01:05:40.050
from behind.
You can see the replay.

1098
01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:45.240
He waits for the ref to be screened and assassinates O'Reilly's future kids.

1099
01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:50.340
He won't even get a fine fuck him.
And every content roots forum.

1100
01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:54.360
Um,
I understand that,
I understand that.
But you know,

1101
01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:58.050
Luci choose to play for us and he was the king of spear and people in the tank

1102
01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.570
and the nuts.
Um,

1103
01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:02.240
<v 1>okay.</v>

1104
01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.530
<v 0>I Dunno,
I would just,
you know,</v>

1105
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:07.610
he also makes the league a lot of money and superstars have different rules.

1106
01:06:07.611 --> 01:06:09.650
That's just how it is.
But I will tell you this,

1107
01:06:09.651 --> 01:06:14.651
that guy's backhander is fucking has more power in speed to it than a lot of

1108
01:06:14.781 --> 01:06:19.550
guys.
Wrist is in the league.
Best backhand I've ever seen and um,

1109
01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:25.370
you know,
I have to give it up to greatness,
but you know,
he,
yeah,
he,

1110
01:06:25.371 --> 01:06:27.140
he used to whine a lot when he was younger.

1111
01:06:27.141 --> 01:06:31.520
I think half of it was his pouty lips,
so it made it look even worse.
But uh,

1112
01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:35.120
I know that guy's a stud man,
but I understand not liking them.
Anyways,

1113
01:06:35.121 --> 01:06:39.860
underrated bowling.
I recently found out I have a spine problem,

1114
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:43.820
high spine problems.
So I had to quit softball and flag football.

1115
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:45.950
The good thing I was at high schools.

1116
01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:47.673
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1117
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.350
<v 0>The,
I was good at I guess the sport.</v>

1118
01:06:50.351 --> 01:06:54.070
I was good at a lot of people fucking up this week.
The sport,
the sports.

1119
01:06:54.071 --> 01:06:57.100
I was good at high school in high school,

1120
01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:02.950
but not that good starter kit.
You left out a couple of words in that thing,

1121
01:07:02.951 --> 01:07:04.060
buddy.
Anyways,

1122
01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:08.020
my brother turned me onto bowling leagues and it's way better than I ever gave

1123
01:07:08.021 --> 01:07:12.280
it credit for.
It's competitive.
You win a little money and if you suck ass,

1124
01:07:12.281 --> 01:07:14.110
you can walk 10 feet to the bar

1125
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:19.190
and get lit slash win win.
Thanks.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1126
01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:23.460
Absolutely bowling's to shit.
Um,

1127
01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:27.200
but I will tell you,
uh,
I would definitely go to a chiropractor and a,

1128
01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:28.620
I would get a great Mizzou,

1129
01:07:28.621 --> 01:07:32.820
so maybe they could work out a lot of your back stuff because,
uh,
you know,

1130
01:07:32.821 --> 01:07:35.910
if you're going to go from active shit to something inactive like that and add

1131
01:07:35.911 --> 01:07:39.180
alcohol,
you're going to put on weight,
which is not going to be good for you.

1132
01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:40.980
Certainly your lower back.

1133
01:07:41.730 --> 01:07:44.430
You'd be walking around like you're in your third trimester and you'd never

1134
01:07:44.431 --> 01:07:47.820
given birth.
You know what I mean?
Terminal pregnancy.

1135
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:53.610
How fucking booze and pizza.
All right,
everybody.
That is the,

1136
01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:58.020
um,
as the podcast for this week.
All right?
Always listen to your gut.

1137
01:07:58.230 --> 01:08:03.120
Go fuck yourselves and I'll check in on you on Thursday.
Go Bruins,

1138
01:08:03.121 --> 01:08:05.490
go Celtics.
Go Fuck Yourself.
