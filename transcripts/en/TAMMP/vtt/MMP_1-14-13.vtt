00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.120
Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.780
I'm downstairs Sunday night.
Believe it or not,

6
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:25.480
this is why this podcast hopefully is up on time.

7
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.480
Hopefully I was able to upload it on time,

8
00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:31.660
pass it onto the person who uploads it and they were able to upload it and you

9
00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:35.950
were able to download it.
Now you listening to it.
Hopefully that has happened.

10
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.480
Um,
I'm down here.
Nia is upstairs.

11
00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:44.920
She's watching the fucking Golden Globes.
Jesus Christ,

12
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.960
you know,
sitting in.
I'm like where my room is,

13
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.550
where I sit and stare at my computer and act like I actually have a serious

14
00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:57.490
fucking career.
It's right off the TV place,

15
00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:01.570
the room there and a for fucking two hours.

16
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.920
All I'm hearing coming out of that room as her watching the Golden Globes and

17
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:10.600
just one person after another just guy,
I want a crash.
You congratulate.

18
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.260
It was so brave.
Everything was brave.

19
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.240
Such a brave performance.
I,

21
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.450
You would think t's fucking people just,
I don't know what just won a war.

22
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.870
Your,
your,
your,

23
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.760
your compassion for the human experience.
Your,

24
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.940
uh,
your,
your,
the,

25
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.950
the intestinal fortitude of your fucking essence of your aura.

26
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.760
Jesus just fucking blows them already.
You know what I mean?

27
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.650
Literally Miles filling up with saliva as it just trying to get more fucking

28
00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:02.010
compliments out.
I get it.
You know

29
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.930
how people sit there and fucking watch those stakes.

30
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.020
Let me ask you guys a question which you show up.

31
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.690
Would you show up to some shit like that?

32
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:16.290
If you ever got nominated for something like that,
you know,

33
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.100
did you go out?
What'd you go to?
The little Tuxedo place down the street.

34
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:23.400
Get yourself those plastic shoes that God knows how many people have already

35
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:26.400
fucking worn and gone out and puked in,
you know,

36
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.190
just stick your head through some fucking rented limo.
Sunroof.
Okay.

37
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.673
<v 2>Woo.</v>

38
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.520
<v 1>When are,
when are right here.
You,
you eating that corn dog?</v>

39
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:46.050
Go Fuck yourself nominated.
Not nominated.
Yeah.

40
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.340
Yeah,
we'll see right then.
You fucking have a couple of Michelob.

41
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.280
Um,
you walk in there,

42
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.630
the nomination for most original screenplay goes to Zippy zipper fest

43
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.490
and they play the stupid music and you've got to walk up there.

44
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:11.380
I can take away by publishers by uh,

45
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.430
I'm sorry,
I'm drawing a blank.
Uh,
my wife,
uh,

46
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.770
unended courage or bravery and putting up with me.
I know I'm not easy.

47
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.930
I know we keep using an English accent,

48
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:27.400
but it just always seems to be some sort of British accent now.
You know,

49
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.940
even like when you go on the Internet there,
if you go on the Internet,

50
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.080
how old did I just sound?

51
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.040
And they tried to explain something or sometimes when they have like a fucking,

52
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.230
uh,
what do you call it there?

53
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.210
<v 1>You call up and somebody puts,
you know,
you,
you get to the voicemail,
right.</v>

55
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:45.190
They got that English accent going on.

56
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.150
I don't understand why they're there.
They're really in fucking vogue.
I,

57
00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:54.020
which I went to Mike,
my favorite website that ted.com,

58
00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:57.140
cause it always blows my mind with these fucking eggheads are working on.

59
00:03:57.141 --> 00:03:59.300
And every once in a while,
something inspirational.

60
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.950
And today I went on there and uh,
I'm looking at this fucking lie.

61
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.470
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

62
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.050
<v 1>Add a named Sue Austin.
She got sick.</v>

63
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.900
So now she's in a wheelchair or as she calls it,
a power chair.
So,

64
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.130
uh,
she was actually psyched get to get in the wheelchair because I guess she was

65
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:24.070
bedridden.
And then she got in the wheelchair and she was like sight.
She goes,

66
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:27.280
I could fucking cruise down the street,
you know,
you know,

67
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:29.230
the wheelchairs they got now,
like those old people have,

68
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:31.720
they're not the same ones.
Like,
you know,

69
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.030
I don't think we've experienced our first death yet,

70
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:37.900
but if they make those fucking wheelchairs any faster like this,
you know,

71
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.890
it's going to be a lawsuit,
you know.
So anyway,

72
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:44.380
she's flying down the street and an inner in a wheelchair.

73
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:47.980
Evidently having the fucking time of her life,
feeling the wind in her face,

74
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:52.120
cause anything's better than laying in that fucking bed under all those
blankets.

75
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.050
So she psyched goes out in the world,
is having a great time.

76
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.300
Of course she's saying all this in an English accent.

77
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.330
If he didn't do window me face,
but all I need

78
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.760
all these cunts scattering about.
Um,

79
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.120
so anyways,
long story short,

80
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.690
she's taken it back how everybody like almost like ignores her,

81
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.920
you know what I mean?
Which I try not to do when I meet people in wheelchairs.

82
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:23.550
You know what I mean?
Like you try to fucking,
you,
you're looking them in the eye,

83
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.130
having a conversation,
but you can't help but feel like you look,

84
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.660
you're obviously you're looking down on them.

85
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.040
Then it feels like this weird like conduct condescending thing.
Like,
Hey,

86
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.760
you down there,
I'm talking he up here.
Right.
So what else you going to do?

87
00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:39.910
You're going to squat down and now they feel like a little kid and you got to

88
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:41.170
tie their shoe or something.

89
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.210
It's really what they should really be some sort of standing to wheelchair,

90
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.750
um,
um,
manners drawn up.

91
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.830
<v 0>Okay.</v>

92
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.180
<v 1>You know what I mean?
That'd be weird if you that if you sit down too</v>

93
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.300
or you then mocking their condition because at the end of the conversation you

94
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:03.920
can get up and walk away.
You know what I mean?

95
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.060
And all you're trying to do is not hurt the fucking feelings wherever dentally,

96
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.453
you know,

97
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.490
they're well aware that you didn't put them in the chair so that like just treat

98
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:16.790
me fucking normal evidently,
you know.

99
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.840
Can I say evidently one more fucking time this week?
Um,
God knows this.

100
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:24.650
Some do shout they're counting it.
Oh look,
20 to be a dick.

101
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:29.630
But on this week's podcast you said evidently fucking 40 rarely.

102
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.010
What did you do after you got done counting the evidence at least what was the

103
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:38.990
next exciting part of your fucking day?
You've got damn country.
Um,
so anyways,

104
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.270
back to the lady in the wheelchair.
So I don't know,

105
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:46.250
I kind of fast forward through some of the video,
right?

106
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:51.210
Cause I got to do this podcast and I'm,
she,

107
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.810
I know she got into diving or some shit.

108
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.520
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

109
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.990
<v 1>Oh,
I know.
Somehow she could,
she,</v>

110
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.550
I know she just starts talking about fucking scuba diving and how when you put

111
00:07:02.551 --> 00:07:07.170
that shit on the APP rat tie that you go scuba dive in with all of a sudden like

112
00:07:07.171 --> 00:07:11.070
the wheelchair.
It alters your way that you move around in the world.

113
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.350
But scuba diving was looked at,
he's looked upon is exciting.

114
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.610
So I thought,
what if I combine the two?

115
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.840
I know this is brutal accent.
So she basically fucking

116
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.220
put on a mask,

117
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.150
a regulator and a tank in the back,

118
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:36.050
put some fins on the fucking wheelchair and this lady had the balls,

119
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.210
the fucking ovaries,
if you will,
to scuba dive.

120
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.650
<v 0>Okay,</v>

121
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.490
<v 1>so they cut to her going through the ocean.
She's got long hair,</v>

122
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.320
it's hanging out the back float and she's fucking in a wheelchair sitting down,

123
00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:52.790
going through the ocean.

124
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:56.360
It was beautiful and creepy all at the same fucking time.

125
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.840
It's kind of frightening.
I got to admit it was a little bit frightening.

126
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:03.970
Kind of reminded me a little bit of that movie mama that's coming out.
You know,

127
00:08:03.971 --> 00:08:07.250
at that fucking tree woman that raised those two kids,

128
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.060
two kids get lost in the woods and then they find this,

129
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.570
this fucking creepy woman tree

130
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.300
dirty person.
I don't know what the fuck it is,

131
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.520
but I'm definitely seeing that movie because that movie,

132
00:08:20.521 --> 00:08:25.120
that movie better not disappoint me because uh,
I saw the ads for that.

133
00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:27.930
Do you guys see the ads for that Mama?
You know,

134
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.790
these two kids get lost in the fucking woods and this thing raises him.

135
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.030
And then I guess the humans,
you know,

136
00:08:36.031 --> 00:08:41.031
find him and they bring the two kids back and they are out there for like five

137
00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:41.970
fucking years.

138
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.650
And evidently the fucking dirty mother from the woods,

139
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.270
he's not happy that she lost her kids.
So she comes back to get them.

140
00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:57.140
And um,
once again,
you people who are not into guns,

141
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.420
you know,
and you're against the NRA.
I'll tell you right now.

142
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:04.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

143
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.260
<v 1>I would love to hear what you add to say when some fucking half a tree,</v>

144
00:09:08.261 --> 00:09:12.820
half a woman dirty fucking individual comes into your house from the woods.
Ft.

145
00:09:12.821 --> 00:09:16.870
Find Your kids cause you somehow lost them out there for the last five fucking

146
00:09:16.871 --> 00:09:17.120
years,

147
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.740
comes back into your house and you're sitting there with a bread knife and an

148
00:09:20.741 --> 00:09:23.800
English muffin in this fucking thing comes through the goddamn window.

149
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.223
<v 0>Huh?</v>

150
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.860
<v 1>When did you want to have a semiotic assault rifle?
Not trying to cause a debate.</v>

151
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.480
I'm just,
I'm just putting it out there.

152
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.633
<v 0>You know?</v>

153
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.200
<v 1>She's trying to take a different angle on this</v>

154
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.460
20 ways this lady is in a fucking wheelchair.
Scuba diving.

155
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.570
All right.
I'm terrified of the ocean.

156
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:54.940
Absolutely fucking,
I can't even say I'm terrified.
I'm informed of the ocean.

157
00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.160
I know what's in it.
I know some of what's in it.
That's another thing too.

158
00:10:00.161 --> 00:10:01.810
We don't even know everything that's in it.

159
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.650
And you'll get and you can't see it and you're going to go there and you can't

160
00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:09.340
fucking breathe.
You've got to bring,
you've got to bring air with you.
Yeah,

161
00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:10.450
there's a good idea.

162
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.220
Then fucking go someplace where I can't breathe.
Don't worry.
I brought some air.

163
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.073
<v 3>Okay,</v>

164
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.900
<v 1>I want to go or I can't fucking breathe.</v>

165
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.020
Everything's faster than me and if it wants to,

166
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:32.610
it might start eating me alive.
But don't worry,

167
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.630
I brought some air or these fucking people,
they're,

168
00:10:36.631 --> 00:10:39.810
they're out of their minds and they don't deserve to be rescued.

169
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.790
I don't get,
I don't understand.

170
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.940
You know the Coast Guard I other than international freight because we got to

171
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:53.070
get food and shirts to people.
Okay.
Software.

172
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.460
So if those,
those people get in trouble,

173
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.330
I definitely think you should go out and try and help him up.
Okay.

174
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.090
But if you're just fucking out there,
you know,

175
00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:10.810
beach blanket mango and you're out there surfing,
you know,

176
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.520
or you put on some goggles and you bring some air and you decide to go on,

177
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:21.390
do you,
you know what,
go fuck yourself.
We don't have the money.

178
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:23.320
<v 0>Okay.</v>

179
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.720
<v 1>California 40 does now,
but we don't have the money to go save you.</v>

180
00:11:25.721 --> 00:11:30.720
This fucking state is broke.
God Damn assholes.

181
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:34.450
They got fucking Dui checks every three feet.
And why do you think that is?

182
00:11:34.451 --> 00:11:36.070
Because they're trying to crack down on it.
No,

183
00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:39.760
cause they're making a fortune off and catch.

184
00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:43.300
And some people had a couple of Budweiser's,
you know,

185
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.990
I don't even know what I'm talking about this week.
So anyways,

186
00:11:46.991 --> 00:11:49.210
this lady in the fucking wheelchair,
she scuba dives now.

187
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:50.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

188
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:55.020
<v 1>She can move her fucking legs and she has the fucking ovaries to go down there.</v>

189
00:11:55.021 --> 00:11:58.890
And I,
I,
I don't have the balls to do it.
I'm absolutely blown away by her.

190
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.270
But then on another side,

191
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:01.650
<v 0>okay,</v>

192
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.010
<v 1>she's Kinda cheating because like if a shark comes at her,</v>

193
00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:07.050
she could just sort of lean to one side and all.

194
00:12:07.051 --> 00:12:11.400
He's going to get as a mouth full of metal and you break all his teeth.

195
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.060
That would be great.
Ah,
you'll like that leg.
Good.
Take a shot at you.

196
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:24.770
Just fucking lean shark comes in.
Fucking knocks out all this teeth.

197
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.890
Fucking freaking out.
Freak out a shark.

198
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.900
Get him to put his little flipper over his mouth.

199
00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:33.870
Like a little kid who broke his front teeth.

200
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:35.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

201
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.740
<v 1>I don't know if you see her.
I know that they're trying to make it beautiful,</v>

202
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.880
but there's something about her long hair,
the fact that she's sitting down,

203
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:44.950
it's just weird and it's creepy.

204
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:46.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

205
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.490
<v 1>Do you know I keep seeing that dirty mother,
half a tree person,
uh,</v>

206
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:55.030
with the leaves in her hair.
I actually like the downstairs in my house.

207
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.560
It's just creepy.
I don't know what it is,

208
00:12:57.561 --> 00:13:01.450
is something that's creepy about it and I love it cause I come down here and my

209
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:04.120
mind starts fucking with me and I don't believe in ghosts.

210
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.390
I don't believe in monsters of,
uh,
you know,

211
00:13:07.391 --> 00:13:11.440
other than just shit that we know that exists like sociopath's ax,
murderers,

212
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.990
grizzly bears,
and even a grizzly bears,
not a monster.
It's just hungry.

213
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.680
And I'm there.
Okay.
I would like that.
It wouldn't mommy and try and eat me,

214
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.780
but it's not sitting there like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,

215
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.230
I'm going to fucking ruin this guy's day.
Doesn't have a just,
just hungry.

216
00:13:25.231 --> 00:13:29.490
It's trying to get a sandwich.
All right.
And if I'm in its vicinity,
um,

217
00:13:29.491 --> 00:13:32.400
like one of those sweaty pieces of Turkey that you see in one of those subway

218
00:13:32.401 --> 00:13:35.550
fucking,
uh,

I want to buy one of those things.
I want to buy a fast food franchise.

220
00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:43.800
That's how I'm going to get out of this fucking business.

221
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.010
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

222
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:49.000

223
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.710

224
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

225
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.730

226
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.850
I'm just going to go ahead.
Go ahead

227
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.140
and just get that crease on your fucking oh,

228
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.240
your arteries.

229
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.423
<v 0>Okay.</v>

Dumb.</v>

231
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.510
Fuck yeah.
Bring your whole family again.

232
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.770
Why is your mascot so mean?
Um,

233
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.150
when people defend eating like shit because they're broke.

234
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:30.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

235
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.590
<v 1>You know what I mean?
I mean,
how much does an apple really cost?</v>

236
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.660
You'd be surprised that shit will fill you up.

237
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.540
You get a banana for 25 fucking sense.

238
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.330
You can get 25 even as a few,

239
00:14:41.331 --> 00:14:46.100
could be a fucking white dude.
Blue blood,

240
00:14:46.101 --> 00:14:49.990
white dude in a suit.
If you stand there long enough going,
hey,
can I have a core?

241
00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:52.340
I could.
Somebody give me costs.
So we'll give you a fucking quarter.

242
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:57.440
You've got a banana.
There you go.
You can ride that out til lunch.

You Open your mouth,

You get some water.
Then what?

245
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.040
Then lunchtime comes around.
Lunch is tough.
Trying to beg for a lunch.

246
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:10.874
That's a rough one.

247
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.383
<v 0>You know?</v>

248
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.780
<v 1>How long do you think your homeless before you look home with?</v>

249

you got 48 hours before you look like you've been out there for 48 days.

252
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.900
So you got basically two days to somehow get the fuck off the streets.

253
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.760
Arouse your,
you're in it for the long.

Tree person just looks like the person looks like they made out of bark.

323
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:03.560
So when I come downstairs in my house,
it's the bags house.
Who's kidding?
Who?

324
00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.370
All right?
I just,
whenever you buy something,

325
00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:08.890
all you do is you just switch and landlords,
you know,
I want people to,

326
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:13.070
you radicchio people.
Jai I owed,

327
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:18.030
I bought my house.
No you didn't.
No,
you didn't.
You sold yourself.

328
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.100
You freed yourself from this guy,

329
00:20:20.101 --> 00:20:24.390
and then you sold yourself into indentured servitude servitude to the 230 years.

330
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:28.730
That's what you did.
How old are you now?
Add 30 to that.
All right.

331
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.750
Yeah,
that's when you own your house.
Hey,
don't get mad at me.

332
00:20:33.751 --> 00:20:37.800
I don't make the fucking rules.
Um,
so anyways,

333
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.510
with my bank owned house here,

334
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.770
this is what I do want to come downstairs and I get freaked out,
you know,

335
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.710
whatever the latest monster movie that comes out,
if it,

336
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:51.190
if it catches me and whenever I come down and the lights are out and I have to

337
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.440
walk into the dark room before I turned the light on,

338
00:20:53.441 --> 00:20:57.460
I always pictured that thing being in there coming at me and I can really freak

339
00:20:57.461 --> 00:21:01.870
myself up,
you know?
Same Way.
Like,
if I jump into a pool and I start thinking,

340
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:04.000
what if there's a little fucking alligator swimming right at me?

341
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.300
It makes me real quick to the side.
You know,

342
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:12.570
it's just your fucking mind play tricks on you.
So I know I,

343
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.930
I know how to get over it.

344
00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:17.590
Now what I do is I walk in the room and I don't turn on the lights and I fucking

345
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:22.210
three 60.
Just give the whole room the finger.
That's what I do.

346
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:24.190
And I've never gotten killed for doing it.

347
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.230
If you want to get over that shit,
um,

348
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.010
I know I'm out of my mind.
You guys watch all this tough fucking great.

349
00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:36.844
Where the games this,

350
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.880
I know there's a lot of bummed out fans because your team loss and uh,

351
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.620
I'll tell you right now,
I wonder,

352
00:21:44.621 --> 00:21:49.621
who do you think age to more Bronco fans or uh,

353
00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.860
Atlanta fans or Seahawk fence.
I mean those,
that,

354
00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:57.880
those two fucking games where were,
were unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

355
00:21:57.881 --> 00:22:01.150
And I know what a lot of people think of right now for all those years when I

356
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:04.030
trashed Peyton manning because they kept saying they,
you know,

357
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.740
they at that and start date,

358
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:10.000
despite Tom Brady's three rings and Pate Manning had zero at that point,

359
00:22:10.001 --> 00:22:14.560
the guy had at the start when I still got to go with Peyton Manning,
you know,

360
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.890
um,
I'm actually going to defend Peyton manning.

361
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.300
That loss last week was not his fault,

362
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.660
okay?
Now I know that they had,
you know,

363
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.480
a punt return is something like that and that bullshit or whatever.
K,

364
00:22:28.481 --> 00:22:30.910
the guy had a tip ball for an interception,

365
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.320
tipped off his own fucking receiver's hands for a pick six that's not on him.

366
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:40.360
All right?
Now he had the Brett Farve run right,
thrown back,

367
00:22:40.361 --> 00:22:45.010
left across the body,
over the middle for a pick.
He did do that.
However,

368
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.090
the goat of that game is Rahim more.

369
00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:55.420
All right,
you're up fucking seven points.

370
00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.480
30 seconds left as 70 yards away and he stands there and they got no timeouts

371
00:23:02.201 --> 00:23:05.920
left 30 sec.
He stands there like,
like,
oh,
what if they run it?

372
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:12.580
Don't let anybody get behind you.
So this fucking guy runs by Champ Bailey,
right?

373
00:23:12.581 --> 00:23:16.090
Champs got him download this guy supposed to come over and have him over uh,

374
00:23:16.091 --> 00:23:17.170
over the top.

375
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.760
He gets there late and they led Joe Flacco,

376
00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:27.280
Joe Flacco,
who they keep telling me is this fucking amazing.

377
00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:30.490
He even says it.
He even says he's amazing.

378
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.990
I see moments of it all right.

379
00:23:34.991 --> 00:23:39.991
But I think he's been in the fucking league long enough to realize that he's not

380
00:23:40.241 --> 00:23:41.074
amazing.

381
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:46.710
He is a efficient with glimpses of brilliance and I don't think there's a

382
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:50.630
fucking raving fan out there that would argue with me.
All right.

383
00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:52.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

384
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.510
<v 1>I don't even think he's Tony Romo.
I don't,
he's just one of those fucking guys,</v>

385
00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.470
one of those guys.
I don't know what it is.
Sick.

386
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:05.250
Just you notice like how certain fucking teams that just good in one area,

387
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:10.730
they just know how to draft this one fucking position or maybe are just know how

388
00:24:10.731 --> 00:24:13.000
to draft offensive plays.
Like look at the digize.

389
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:18.170
Nobody knows how to draft front four guys on a defense.
Like the fucking giants.

390
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.680
They're unbelievable Steelers.
Always have a great,

391
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.630
always have a great defense.

392
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.910
And then there's other teams that are just fast fucking teams.

393
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:29.180
They always have great wide receivers.
And then they,

394
00:24:29.181 --> 00:24:30.650
I don't know the fucking ravens,

395
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:35.540
they just can't pick a quarterback to save that God damn life.
They can't.

396
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:39.890
So anyway,
so this guy fucking throws this ball,
throws it up for grabs.

397
00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.390
Allah,
Eli Manning,

398
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:45.020
except he was actually facing where he was throwing it as opposed to turning and

399
00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:49.540
facing the opposite,
uh,
end zone with his shoulders up.
Oh,
did it?

400
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.050
Did he catch it?
Um,

401
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.900
I'm fucking with the giants fans.
It was a hell of a throne.
Anyways,

402
00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.980
so this fucker writing more and he's getting over there late.

403
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.263
<v 0>Okay.</v>

404
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.700
<v 1>All of a sudden he fucking starts turning around because he looked over the</v>

405
00:25:06.701 --> 00:25:10.570
wrong shoulder.
And if a half a second,
he's running backwards.

406
00:25:10.571 --> 00:25:15.250
He looked like a right fielder in little league baseball.
You know what I mean?

407
00:25:15.251 --> 00:25:18.850
That kid,
please don't hit it to me.
And he fucking stops running,

408
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:22.660
jumps up,
misses the ball,

409
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:27.340
lands on his fucking ass.
The ravens do catches it.

410
00:25:27.341 --> 00:25:31.530
Champ Bailey is right on that guy's ass,
but now because of raw,
he,

411
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.400
he had to hurdle that guy which gave the the ravens receiver and update.

412
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.370
You can see it a champs fucking body language.
When he hurdles over that kid,

413
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.540
you can see he's going to fucking score now and they scored.

414
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.450
All right.
What more is Peyton manning have to do?

415
00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.480
They put up fucking 35 fucking points against the ravens.

416
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.430
That should be enough to win the game.

417
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.560
So I don't think that that's on a,
I don't think that that loss is on.

418
00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:08.210
Peyton manning is far is like blowing the gang.

419
00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:12.930
Yeah,
up by seven points with 30 seconds.
Fucking left,

420
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:17.910
70 yards to go.
That's on the goddamn defense.
All right,

421
00:26:17.911 --> 00:26:19.920
so I know a lot of you guys thought I was going to pile on.

422
00:26:19.921 --> 00:26:23.370
I actually felt bad for pate manning and I enjoyed watching them this year.

423
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.560
Now that he was finally out of a culture uniform,

424
00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:30.840
I could enjoy watching them because I had major problems.

425
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.750
You guys know the deal with the colts crying about the Patriots?

426
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.380
<v 4>We made a tape of it.</v>

427
00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.100
<v 1>Yeah.
Sorry.
All the shit,</v>

428
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.170
<v 0>all that shit they're doing covering your receivers.
That's all legal.</v>

429
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.670
Wow.
Then fucking,
I dunno,
change the rules.
Right.

430
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.580
And the fucking owner sits on the rules committee.
Next thing you know,

431
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.330
next thing you fucking know.
And the whole,
the whole game changed.

432
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.790
The whole game changes.
All office defense,

433
00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:07.110
everything is fucking change because of the Goddamn cult because those fucking

434
00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:10.710
cops couldn't beat us.
And that's why all Dan Marino's records of fallen.

435
00:27:10.711 --> 00:27:14.850
That's why he starting to see Jerry Rice's records are being beaten by Wes

436
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:15.990
Welker.
You know,

437
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.540
that's why it's very rare to see it in an aggressive cornerback anymore cause

438
00:27:21.541 --> 00:27:25.260
it's basically,
as far as I can tell,
it's kind of illegal to cover a receiver.

439
00:27:25.261 --> 00:27:29.520
I've been through this shit.
So anyways,
now and what am I trying to say?

440
00:27:29.521 --> 00:27:32.610
So now that he plays for the fucking Broncos,
I actually,

441
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.740
that was my prediction.

442
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.290
I said the Patriots are going to beat the text and said we're going to go into

443
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.590
Denver and we were going to lose because they had a better defense than we did

444
00:27:40.591 --> 00:27:45.240
in our defense has been suspect all year.
Although they played great.
Uh,

445
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:50.070
they did play great today and it was still close.
You know what I think today,

446
00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:54.870
I finally understood the prevent defense when I was watching the Texan in their

447
00:27:54.871 --> 00:27:59.871
second to last drive where they for some reason had no sense of urgency and they

448
00:28:00.271 --> 00:28:05.150
were down by three scores and I watched them,
the Patriots,

449
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.320
you know,
protected the sidelines,

450
00:28:07.321 --> 00:28:11.490
kept it over the middle and those guys burned off like four and a half fucking

451
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:13.110
minutes.
Yeah.

452
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.720
<v 1>And got the two point conversion and somehow they were only down by 10,</v>

453
00:28:17.721 --> 00:28:21.170
but all we had to get was a couple of first downs in the whole thing was fucking

454
00:28:21.171 --> 00:28:25.940
over.
Um,
I still don't like it.

455
00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:31.700
There's,
I don't know,
I just don't fucking like it.
And uh,
I dunno.

456
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.710
I Dunno what else to tell you,
dude.
I'm fucking burned out.

457
00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:35.150
I watched so much God damn football.

458
00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:41.410
You know how psyched is the head coach with is Santa Claus Hair?

459
00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.560
This buzz cut Santa Claus fucking hair that Atlanta finally won one.

460
00:28:45.561 --> 00:28:46.520
That was his ass.

461
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:47.840
<v 0>Okay.</v>

462
00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.780
<v 1>He would have to put his house on the market if they lost today.
That was it.</v>

463
00:28:50.781 --> 00:28:54.200
As they were up by 20 and they fucking lost to Seattle.
That was fucking it.

464
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.680
But I got to tell you,
man,
Seattle is the future man.

465
00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:02.440
If they can somehow keep that team together,
that,

466
00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:06.080
that,
that's a scary,
that's going to be a scary,
scary fucking team.

467
00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.010
And goddammit,
Pete,
Carol's a good coach.
Woo.

468
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.820
<v 0>Ooh.</v>

469
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:16.560
<v 1>Didn't get to see him do that too much until the second half.
But a whatever.</v>

470
00:29:16.561 --> 00:29:20.070
Congratulations to all the winners.
Who Do you guys like?
Who Do you like?

471
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:24.270
I have no idea.
I kind of got to think,
uh,

472
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:27.330
I would say the 40 niners

473
00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:33.500
God knows they were fucking kicking the Patriots ass,
but you always got to,

474
00:29:33.501 --> 00:29:36.740
you always got to figure bill Belichick,
you know,

475
00:29:36.741 --> 00:29:41.320
once he's seen you once that said,
you know,
plus all the shitty films.
I mean,

476
00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.420
you got to think we might have you the second time around,
but that's provided.

477
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:54.310
We can get by the ravens.
All right.
Can I do my dumb Espn Shit?
Uh,
Bill,

478
00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:56.390
what do you think the keys to the game dish?

479
00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:02.130
I think it all comes down to Joe Flacco.
All right.
I think,
I think we have,

480
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:07.810
I think we can somehow contain ray rice so he won't kill us too bad.

481
00:30:07.811 --> 00:30:10.750
Hopefully he won't rip off an 80 yard touchdown.

482
00:30:10.751 --> 00:30:14.410
Carry on the first God damn play.
But a,

483
00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:16.090
it all comes down to Joe Flacco.

484
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:22.410
Is it going to be bonehead Joe Flacco or is it going to be the Joe Flacco they

485
00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:25.900
keep telling me it's going to fucking show up each week.
All right.

486
00:30:25.901 --> 00:30:30.460
If the prodigy shows up,
we could be in trouble cause everybody knows the ravens.

487
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.610
They all know they're fucking defense.
And by the way,

488
00:30:33.611 --> 00:30:37.520
I'm sick of people talking about Ray Lewis going,
yeah,

489
00:30:37.521 --> 00:30:42.340
can he just retire already and get on?
Go back to his murdering career.
Um,

490
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:43.820
he was never convicted of murder.

491
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.220
He was initially going to be charged and I think you might've been shot.

492
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.450
Was he charged?
He was charged with obstruction of justice.

493
00:30:50.451 --> 00:30:54.560
He pled guilty to that to make it fucking go away.
I Dunno,

494
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.130
I looked it up on Wikipedia.
It is kind of shady.

495
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.050
I Dunno what happened.
It was,

496
00:31:02.051 --> 00:31:06.370
he had some sort of John Travolta white suit that was never recovered from that

497
00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:10.860
evening.
Um,
I dunno,
I never believe any of that shit.

498
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:15.890
He was also a fucking multimillion dollar athlete in a fucking club and some

499
00:31:16.021 --> 00:31:19.890
shit went down said God knows they're going to drag him into what the lawyers

500
00:31:19.891 --> 00:31:22.860
will anyways.
Right.
Hey Bill,

501
00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.620
you have to think about talking about shit that you know about instead of just

502
00:31:25.621 --> 00:31:28.470
running your goddamn mouth.
Um,
anyways,
yeah,

503
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.160
I'm excited about all these new quarterbacks that are coming in that uh,

504
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:36.180
Colin Kaepernick and Russell Wilson,
man,
those guys,

505
00:31:36.181 --> 00:31:38.730
I was kind of looking forward to seeing those guys square off,

506
00:31:38.731 --> 00:31:42.690
but a B in a Boston guy,
I'm glad a BC guy one.
Um,

507
00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:45.060
but uh,
my prediction,

508
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.170
somehow the Patriots were going to squeak by the ravens.

509
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:53.920
I'm going to age like nine years and um,

510
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.900
I don't think the 40 niners are going to have a problem with the ravens.

511
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.250
The ravens with the,
with the falcons.
I think they're too deep.

512
00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.630
I think that quarterback is not even remotely nervous.

513
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:08.190
I think he actually enjoyed,

514
00:32:08.191 --> 00:32:10.680
he actually said that he enjoys playing in close games.

515
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.080
I think the 49 has got their guy,

516
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:17.100
they have a fucking beast on the horizon here.

517
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:21.720
And this is another wave of new quarterbacks coming in and somehow Brady and

518
00:32:21.721 --> 00:32:26.240
Peyton of the old guys,
now it's unreal.
And I'm older than all of them.
All right,

519
00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:30.330
I'm with the podcast here.
Um,

520
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.150
I know it's gonna be a lot of people disappointed that I didn't trash Peyton

521
00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.120
Manning,
but you do.
You understand what I'm saying?
That one isn't on him.

522
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.610
It's not on him.
But what's funny is now,

523
00:32:38.611 --> 00:32:42.500
after these years of me talking about his play off record saying all that shit,

524
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:46.460
they're finally bringing all of that up there.

525
00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:50.780
Finally saying what I've been saying when I'd now don't hate the guy anymore.

526
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.460
You know,
now I'm watching ESPN gone.
Ah,
Geez.
You don't have to bring that up.

527
00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.260
I'm a fucking nut.
So anyways,
um,

528
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.530
this is the big exciting thing in my life.
You know,
I've,

529
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.260
I've finally got this fucking house,

530
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:11.210
somewhat shipshape an asshole.
I bought an old house,
you know,

531
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.630
and when you buy something old it's just constantly falling down.

532
00:33:14.631 --> 00:33:18.110
Like I actually had to turn the heat off because it's loud as fuck.

533
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.130
And I looked up and I said,

534
00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:23.510
oh I can actually adjust that vent that looks like he was putting in like 1975,

535
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:27.470
you know,
some sort of Brady bunch era of vent that's in the ceiling.

536
00:33:27.471 --> 00:33:31.190
So I go up there and I sh I go to shut it off and it's so fucking old.

537
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.990
It can't quite close.

538
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:36.560
It can only close to the point where the hot air is now whistling through the

539
00:33:36.561 --> 00:33:37.394
vents.

540
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:43.030
So my options were either to leave it full blast drying out what's left of the

541
00:33:43.341 --> 00:33:46.460
top of my head.
Um,

542
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:51.080
both hair on top of my head having it whistle or sit here in the cold,

543
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:54.290
which is what I'm doing,
you know?
Oh Shit.

544
00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:56.090
Is that fucking tree lady going to show up?

545
00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:59.840
Cause it feels like it's outside coming up here with leaves in her fucking

546
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.943
<v 3>Bush.</v>

547
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:09.490
<v 1>I have to go see that movie.
Why is it crawling around on the floor?
Oh,</v>

548
00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.460
I speak at a movies,
oh,
there's a segue for you.

549
00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.093
<v 3>MMM.</v>

550
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.610
<v 1>Ben Affleck,
one for a,
um,</v>

551
00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:22.920
Argo and I was looking at it up there online and evidently I ran,

552
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:28.740
was less than thrilled with his version of what the fuck happened in Argo.

553
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:33.020
So evidently they,
evidently,
I said it again.
They're going to make,

554
00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:38.170
did they're gonna make their version of Argo.
All right.

555
00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.060
Any movie nerds out there who listened to this podcast,
please stay on that.

556
00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:48.070
I want to watch that movie.
I really want to watch that fucking movie.

557
00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:52.090
I want to see their version of what they think happened.
You know,

558
00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:55.720
we got the Hollywood version.
Why shouldn't we get the,
uh,

559
00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.600
on version that's what they should start doing.

560
00:34:58.601 --> 00:35:02.800
Or I think around the world when a big Hollywood movies make movies about other

561
00:35:02.801 --> 00:35:03.634
countries,

562
00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:08.940
that countries should just pull their money together in an adorable way that all

563
00:35:09.761 --> 00:35:13.300
the little insignificant countries around the world,
you know,
I mean it was,

564
00:35:13.301 --> 00:35:13.661
couldn't,
no,

565
00:35:13.661 --> 00:35:18.661
there's only like this like three real countries like the world is,

566
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:23.190
it's kind of like baseball where this like,
you know,
this like six teams,

567
00:35:23.191 --> 00:35:25.920
they're going to be competing for it every year and the rest of you,

568
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.950
you like the brewers,
you know?

569
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:34.950
<v 3>Okay.
Okay.</v>

570
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.580
<v 1>Hey,
you want me to be the ignorant?
I'll fucking play it up.</v>

571
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.480
I'll bill stop acting like you're dumb when your shit down.

572
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:45.780
We all know you Erika.
Fuck,
you're right.
You're right.
I'm done.
So anyways,

573
00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:50.730
I've been trying to uh,
also and it stay on that please for the love of God.

574
00:35:50.731 --> 00:35:55.470
Stay on that.
And I ran.
If you're listening.
All right,

575
00:35:55.590 --> 00:36:00.300
don't fucking pussy up.
Make that movie.
I want to see it.

576
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.900
I think it's great.
Let me see your lives.

577
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.180
Let me see what you got to say about what happened.

578
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.010
What's your version going to have

579
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:14.160
those six people are rapists or were they friends of yours and you actually

580
00:36:14.161 --> 00:36:18.810
helped them on the plane?
I want to see it.
All right.
If you could just,
you know,

581
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:20.520
<v 0>okay.</v>

582
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:25.230
<v 1>Take time out of hating and just make a movie.
That's,
that's actually bad.</v>

583
00:36:25.231 --> 00:36:27.120
I shouldn't say that.
Not everybody hates over there.

584
00:36:27.121 --> 00:36:31.050
There's gotta be an Iranian bill burst sitting there trying to podcast.
I saw it.

585
00:36:31.051 --> 00:36:35.550
I saw a documentary on kids who play heavy metal and metal music and trying to

586
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:38.640
be in a fucking band in either Iraq or Iran.
I forget what it was.

587
00:36:38.641 --> 00:36:41.430
It was really interesting.
So there we go.
Let's,

588
00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:45.150
let's fucking cap that ignorance right there.
Bill.
20 ways I own this.

589
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.770
I own this old house.

590
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

591
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.130
<v 1>Uh,
this old house is a piece of shit.</v>

592
00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:55.170
This old house has a bunch of plaster that Abraham Lincoln fucking put in the

593
00:36:55.171 --> 00:36:58.050
bid fucking eight,
16.
Um,

594
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:03.000
so I'm gradually getting this thing.
I had to fucking do the guts first.

595
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:06.450
I had to do the wiring and I had to do the plumbing.

596
00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.120
And by saying I had to do it.

597
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:14.150
I mean I hired another man to come over and do what I don't know how to do.

598
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:19.110
So I think I got it shipped shape.

599
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:23.010
I think I finally got rid of the last little bits of galvanized pipe.

600
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:28.570
I got everything thing in here.
Now it's all copper,
right?

601
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.360
So I don't even want to green or Brown fucking water.

602
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:32.670
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

603
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.130
<v 1>I got most,
most of the uh,</v>

604
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:38.370
electrical done,

605
00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.413
<v 0>you know,</v>

606
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:43.081
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

607
00:37:43.081 --> 00:37:46.170
I don't what was going on did we had some sort of fucking exposed wire near the

608
00:37:46.171 --> 00:37:49.620
gas and we literally could have blown ourselves up every time we fucking use the

609
00:37:49.621 --> 00:37:50.670
fireplace or something.

610
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:56.430
So got that straightened out last week.
You know,

611
00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.870
we,
we got,
uh,

612
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:02.760
we got dish rather than cable and a,
the last people here had cable.

613
00:38:02.761 --> 00:38:04.560
So I'll tell you right now,

614
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:09.760
two fucking people that I can't stand and to people that you won't be able to

615
00:38:09.761 --> 00:38:13.990
stand when you fucking get a house.
Our painters and the cable guy.
All right,

616
00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.530
the guys who install cable,
these fucking conch.
First of all,
painters,

617
00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:22.240
they paint over everything.
They don't give a fuck.
Door knobs,
hinges,

618
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:26.260
doorbells,
windows outlets.

619
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.730
<v 0>Okay?</v>

620
00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.860
<v 1>If it's a fucking kid,
lean it up against the wall.</v>

621
00:38:29.861 --> 00:38:33.820
They'll fucking bill paid over at did.
They'll go up,
down,
up,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

622
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:37.030
We'll give it the kid three swipes before they realize,
oh wait,

623
00:38:37.031 --> 00:38:39.340
this is a living thing.
They'll paint your fucking dog.

624
00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:44.110
They don't give a shit what color you want it all right,
everything.

625
00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.390
Why don't you just grab the bucket of paint,

626
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.380
take the lid off and then just start spinning around with it.

627
00:38:49.381 --> 00:38:52.210
Cause that's what the fuck you're doing.
You know?

628
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.990
Then I got to go in and clean up your goddamn mess.
So anyways,

629
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.830
and then the cable guys,
when they install cable,

630
00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:03.580
they basically unload like five miles of cable.

631
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:09.220
They completely overestimate what they need and then they grab a fucking drill

632
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:12.040
and and a staple of some sort of staple gun.

633
00:39:12.041 --> 00:39:15.130
They called case went case when cash up the side of your fucking house.

634
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.490
And then whatever's in their way,
they just drill through it.

635
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:24.070
So I spent like three hours the other day climbing all over my house,

636
00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:27.360
getting this shit off,
you know,
now I got to go,

637
00:39:27.361 --> 00:39:31.330
go back with like fucking stucco and whatever the fuck I gotta do and patch up

638
00:39:31.331 --> 00:39:32.260
some of these holes,
you know,

639
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:34.360
some of the nails came out and took a chunk of this shit out

640
00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.980
through all of that out.
So now,
you know,

641
00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.950
spackled the walls repainted them.
I'm all fucking good.

642
00:39:43.951 --> 00:39:45.960
So now I get to do the fun shit.

643
00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:51.900
I get to actually work on something that you can see.
So,
uh,

644
00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.220
we got these doors upstairs.
I've got like five doors upstairs.

645
00:39:56.221 --> 00:40:00.420
Three of them are original from the old days and in two of them are home depot

646
00:40:00.421 --> 00:40:01.254
specials,

647
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.070
which basically means an eight year old having a temper tantrum could put his

648
00:40:05.071 --> 00:40:08.970
little fucking eight year old hand throw him.
So,
uh,
I dunno,

649
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:13.950
I actually found a place where they have all these old fucking vintage doors and

650
00:40:13.951 --> 00:40:16.950
it's made of the old shit.
You know,

651
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:18.990
when you fucking knock on the door,

652
00:40:18.991 --> 00:40:21.960
makes that solid sound as opposed to that shit sound.

653
00:40:21.961 --> 00:40:26.940
You know that Ikea sound that's Ikea.
You hear that?
Wait a second,

654
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:32.220
that's Ikea
here.

655
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:38.670
Can you tell a difference?
Well,
you know what,
go fuck yourself.
I can

656
00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:45.540
but his,
his,
or some Ikea.
Here's some Ikea right here.
Here.
It,
that.

657
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.970
I have no balls here.
That,
that fucking word
that you know,

658
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.960
I key it gets there.

659
00:40:51.961 --> 00:40:55.770
What they basically like you ever see those popsicle stick houses?

660
00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:59.370
They have Cambodians make those,
but instead of like a house,

661
00:40:59.371 --> 00:41:01.050
they make a dresser out of it.
That's what they do.

662
00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:06.410
And then just unscrew it and they ship it over here.
That's what they do.
Um,

663
00:41:06.411 --> 00:41:09.390
so when he was,
I found these old fucking doors and are,

664
00:41:09.391 --> 00:41:12.390
they are in rough shape and ain't going to lie to Ya,
but,
uh,

665
00:41:12.391 --> 00:41:14.670
I'm actually gonna attempt to refinish these fucking things.

666
00:41:14.671 --> 00:41:18.300
So if anybody out there knows,
what can I use to take the paint off?

667
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.410
I don't want to use this sander.
I didn't want to fuck the thing up.
All right.

668
00:41:22.411 --> 00:41:25.200
My Dad was telling me they got this goop.
You could just paint on it.

669
00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:27.780
You walk away,
you come back,

670
00:41:27.781 --> 00:41:30.030
it shrivels up and then you just fucking wipe it off.

671
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:33.970
Does anybody know what the name of it is?
This is what I do when I do this shit.

672
00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:38.050
I asked somebody I respect like my dad and then I asked like fucking 20 other

673
00:41:38.051 --> 00:41:40.120
people and then I just,
I put it all together.

674
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

675
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.350
<v 1>Built.
We really don't want to hear about you.
Re fucking doing you.
How?</v>

676
00:41:44.351 --> 00:41:48.580
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,
let's,
let's get,
let's get to some emails for the week,

677
00:41:48.581 --> 00:41:53.500
shall we?
I'm still at a Christmas mood.
I didn't trash fucking paint.
Manning.

678
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:56.980
Um,
India's rebuttal.
Do you remember a few weeks?

679
00:41:56.981 --> 00:41:59.500
I'm not reading that fucking one.
I'll get to that one in a second.

680
00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:03.400
A professor wants to bang.
Hey Bill,

681
00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:08.050
I'm a 19 year old male college freshmen and my professor wants to have sex.

682
00:42:08.051 --> 00:42:08.884
Do it.

683
00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:14.800
I'm sorry that wasn't me.
That was somebody else yelling.
Okay,

684
00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:15.760
I'm going to be a professional.

685
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:21.380
I kept getting these signs ever since the first few weeks of class began.

686
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:26.110
You're 19,
you're an adult.
Right.
And I'm not really,
I can't get in trouble here.

687
00:42:26.111 --> 00:42:30.850
Right.
Um,
I noticed anytime I am running late to class by a few minutes,

688
00:42:30.851 --> 00:42:33.700
she would always wait for me to start class

689
00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.110
through get to the good part.
What does she look like?
Um,

690
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.880
every time I walked in and she would say things like,
oh,

691
00:42:40.881 --> 00:42:45.860
I was worried you were sick and I was worried you were going to miss my class.

692
00:42:45.861 --> 00:42:50.360
Jesus,
she's putting it out there right in front of the whole class.
Um,

693
00:42:50.361 --> 00:42:54.950
anytime any l anyone else is late to class,
she ignores them and starts on time.

694
00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.720
Well,
wait a minute to it.
Or you're the teacher's pet,
uh,
you know,

695
00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:03.230
when she says sal,
did everybody do the reading last night?
Do we,
uh,

696
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:08.660
have any,
any thoughts on the assigned material?

697
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:11.090
Everyone just sits there staring at her,

698
00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:15.650
chew their gum slowly and you actually put your,
your your hand up.
Oh Michael,

699
00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:20.210
what do you have to say?
I found it.
I thought it was brave.
I thought it was,

700
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:23.660
it was exquisite,
you know?
All right.

701
00:43:23.661 --> 00:43:25.910
Let me want to just read the rest of us here.
Anytime.

702
00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:29.180
Anyone else's late to class.
She,
she,
she ignores him.
Starts on time.
Okay.

703
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:33.170
She's always over the top.
Nice to me when we see each other.

704
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:37.130
I brushed this off and I didn't let it get big in my head.

705
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:42.380
All right,
so he sees he's sick.
He's not thinking that this going to happen.
Okay.

706
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:46.940
A telltale sign came to me one day when I was small.

707
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:50.570
I was at the smoking section on the campus after I left her class,

708
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:56.050
I cheated word for word from the girl that sits next to me in class on a test I

709
00:43:56.451 --> 00:43:57.350
had just finished.

710
00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:01.580
The girl that sits next to me came down to the smoking section with a bag of

711
00:44:01.581 --> 00:44:03.740
chocolate in her hand and gave it to me.

712
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.970
She told me our professor gave it to her to give to me.

713
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.790
Yeah.
Boy,
they're trying to bang.

714
00:44:12.791 --> 00:44:15.160
Your teacher is like trying to get away with a murder.

715
00:44:15.161 --> 00:44:18.160
The more people who are involved,
the bigger chance you have of getting caught.

716
00:44:18.161 --> 00:44:22.040
So what the fuck is she'd given this girl shot the for bringing her in the fall.

717
00:44:22.041 --> 00:44:26.450
Fox.
She wants a threesome,
right?
Is this,
is this,

718
00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.600
where is this where it's going?
Please tell me it's going in this direction.

719
00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:33.000
He's like a red shoe diaries.
Um,

720
00:44:33.001 --> 00:44:36.930
I asked the girl if our professor gave the chocolate to the class when I left

721
00:44:36.931 --> 00:44:40.500
and she said,
no,
I tried to keep calm.

722
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.180
Thank you.
We'll say as my dick was filling up,

723
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.540
I try to keep calm and asked the girl how she did on the test.

724
00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:50.663
<v 5>MMM.</v>

725
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.600
<v 1>I told her I copied her word for word and she said she thinks she did.
Okay.</v>

726
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:58.710
A few minutes later our professor came down to the smoking section where her car

727
00:44:58.711 --> 00:45:01.290
was parked.
The girl asked the professor what,

728
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.870
what she made and the professor tells us she made a 74.
When I asked her,

729
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:11.880
she flipped her hair,
smirked at me and told me I made a 94.

730
00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:16.890
Wow.
Okay.
I'm going to tell you right now,

731
00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:21.990
right fucking now if this happens,
dude,
you were two condoms.

732
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.620
This woman is reckless.
Okay.

733
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:31.550
Go ahead and bang.
You're fucking teacher.
Do it towards the end of the semester.

734
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:38.510
So bad.
Anyways,
she's 36 years old and divorced.

735
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:41.423
<v 5>MMM.</v>

736
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:46.230
<v 1>On this certain website,
wherever Denley people can uh,</v>

737
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.180
basically rate their teachers.
The students rated her as hot.

738
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.310
I want to ask her out to lunch sometime.
Dope.
She's 36.

739
00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:01.660
Just fucker.
She didn't want to go to lunch.
She's 36.
She wants lunch.

740
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:05.700
She'll buy our own lunch.
But that's,
you know,
you're 19.
I keep forgetting that.

741
00:46:05.701 --> 00:46:06.270
Anyways,

742
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.840
the only reason why I haven't asked her out yet is because she told me she has a

743
00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:13.380
13 year old daughter.
We,
oh,

744
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:19.130
that's the sound of her vagina.
She already got a kid.
[inaudible] oh,
uh,
my,

745
00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.980
my question to you is,
would it be wrong?

746
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.380
There are other girls I have met,

747
00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:30.090
but they are the typical dumb whores you find in college.
Okay.

748
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.920
All of them.
I wouldn't think every girl is a dumb whore.

749
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:38.700
Is every guy a dumb jock?
Is every job dumb?

750
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:43.020
See what happens when we talk in absolutes.
Um,

751
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.420
I am not saying I want to marry this broad,

752
00:46:45.421 --> 00:46:49.680
just a one night stand with the history.
Uh,
the professor would be nice.

753
00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:54.630
I am not the type of guy that likes to go around and fuck as many girls as I

754
00:46:54.631 --> 00:46:57.540
made.
That is why I keep thinking that she has,

755
00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.020
that she has a daughter and I should probably stay away.
What do you think?

756
00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:03.170
<v 5>MMM.</v>

757
00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.430
<v 1>I Dunno dude.
The fact that you hit your,</v>

758
00:47:10.431 --> 00:47:13.050
which did you don't want to fucking do what I,
I don't know.

759
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:17.750
Well listen,
do you,

760
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.620
do you know how to bang a girl and then fucking see you the next day and have it

761
00:47:21.621 --> 00:47:23.660
all be cool that that's a skill,
you know,

762
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:27.710
and not have her feel like you used her or whatever,

763
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.300
you know?
Do you know how to do that?

764
00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:31.933
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

765
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:35.240
<v 1>I can tell you one thing you don't want to do is,
what I would do was,</v>

766
00:47:35.241 --> 00:47:38.240
was the next day I'd be like,
Hey,
oh fucking weird.

767
00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.970
And then they get mad and the next thing you know,

768
00:47:40.971 --> 00:47:43.790
all of their friends are fucking looking at you like you're a Dosha and they

769
00:47:43.791 --> 00:47:48.620
start drawing right and shit on your locker.
US A fucking nightmare.

770
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:49.653
Um,

771
00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:50.880
<v 0>okay.</v>

772
00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.190
<v 1>If you've mastered the art of how to fuck somebody and not be,
I don't,</v>

773
00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:59.060
you know something dude,
if you're going to fuck this girl,

774
00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:02.960
you have to do it at the end of the semester.
Once it's over.

775
00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:09.380
Um,
this girl,
she's reckless.
She's a nightmare.
If she's fucking putting this out,

776
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:12.800
it's unbelievably unprofessional.
She should be way more discreet.

777
00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:13.950
<v 0>Okay.</v>

778
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:18.220
<v 1>All right.
And you cheated on this girl word for word she gave you 20 points are,</v>

779
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:20.560
you know what,
dude,
stay away from this girl.
This girl is,

780
00:48:20.561 --> 00:48:23.710
is she's going to get fucking pregnant and you don't want it to be you.

781
00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.580
All right.
Who doesn't want to fuck a teacher?
Everybody does,

782
00:48:27.581 --> 00:48:31.000
but she knows something.
You don't want to have a fucking eat.
I wouldn't do it.

783
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.040
I wouldn't do it.
Don't do it.

784
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:34.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

785
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.160
<v 1>Don't do it.
Stay away.</v>

786
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:40.960
Why don't you go meet some nice girls to stop talking to dumb horse and uh,

787
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:42.693
you know,

788
00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:44.160
<v 0>yeah,</v>

789
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:44.700
<v 1>I dunno.</v>

790
00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.250
Rub One out before you go to class and really think about it and then let me

791
00:48:47.251 --> 00:48:51.600
know what happens.
Okay.
All right.
Hate people considering Florida.

792
00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:56.700
Wow.
Okay.
You don't like people and you want to go to Florida.

793
00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:00.660
You're either going to totally fit in or commit mass murder when you go down

794
00:49:00.661 --> 00:49:03.450
there.
Bill.
Hey,
huge fan.

795
00:49:03.451 --> 00:49:06.930
I've been living in New York my entire life and now that I'm working in New York

796
00:49:06.931 --> 00:49:09.630
City,
all I can say is that I hate people.

797
00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:12.660
I agree with you that the population is way too big.

798
00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:17.490
There simply way too many assholes out there.
I consider myself a decent person,

799
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.260
so I am not all high and mighty,

800
00:49:19.261 --> 00:49:21.510
but one thing that is important to me is respect.

801
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:24.990
I commute to New York City every day and all I can say is that the majority of

802
00:49:24.991 --> 00:49:29.610
people are assholes.
Nobody has simple manners anymore.
Nobody says thank you.

803
00:49:29.611 --> 00:49:32.880
When you're,
when you hold the door,
nobody even holds the door.

804
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:36.240
People are obnoxious on the phones and public places,
et Cetera.

805
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.430
Even out driving people are dicks.

806
00:49:38.431 --> 00:49:41.550
People cut you off and then tell you to go fuck yourself.
Yeah,

807
00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.740
that might've been me.
I do that all the time.

808
00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:44.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

809
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:45.750
<v 1>Look at this fucking guy.</v>

810
00:49:45.751 --> 00:49:49.070
He's on his fucking phone after I was just on my phone cutting off the person

811
00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:51.140
that I'm now in front of.
Um,

812
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.110
I am emailing you because I listen to your podcasts every Monday on a here.

813
00:49:54.111 --> 00:49:57.320
What kind of advice you give?
And I like it because you,
you are being honest.

814
00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.700
I hate.
Oh,
thank you.

815
00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.970
I hate the people so much here that I'm considering moving to Florida once I get

816
00:50:01.971 --> 00:50:05.780
married and start a life there.
I was 24 years old,
have a great job,

817
00:50:05.781 --> 00:50:09.230
have a great girl and I am miserable simply because of other people.

818
00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:13.130
Um,
my girlfriend hates that I am like this,

819
00:50:13.131 --> 00:50:16.580
but I keep telling her there's nothing I could do.
I am just like,
I'm just like,

820
00:50:16.581 --> 00:50:19.400
that just keeps telling me that if I continue like this,

821
00:50:19.401 --> 00:50:22.760
I'll eventually become a bitter person and she is probably right.
Yeah.

822
00:50:22.761 --> 00:50:25.310
And you're going to end up losing her because who the fuck wants to be tied to

823
00:50:25.311 --> 00:50:27.050
that?
Uh,
he,

824
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:31.280
I have gone to Florida many times and love the southern hospitality people seem

825
00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:35.120
just happy all the time and I want that my girlfriend's parents bought a house

826
00:50:35.121 --> 00:50:39.410
down there recently and we've off and have offered us to live there to try it

827
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:41.060
out.
Of course,
after we get married,

828
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.080
I know it'd be a big steps and said would it be leaving behind my family and

829
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:48.380
friends?
But I feel like I need to do something this drastic to keep my sanity.

830
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:51.890
The only bad thing I hear about Florida's to job markets,

831
00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.580
but I will soon be a CPA.
My girlfriend is finishing her masters in education.

832
00:50:55.581 --> 00:50:57.290
So I think as professionals in our field,

833
00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:01.100
we should have no problem finding a job.
If you are in my position,

834
00:51:01.101 --> 00:51:05.510
what would you do?
Am I just overreacting?
Am I just crazy?
Thanks in advance.

835
00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:07.730
<v 6>MMM.</v>

836
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:09.620
<v 1>Oh fuck</v>

837
00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:12.180
<v 0>yeah.</v>

838
00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.460
<v 1>What would I do if I was you?
Um,</v>

839
00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:18.483
I dunno dude.

840
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.840
I just can see you moving to Florida or going down to Florida and looking

841
00:51:22.841 --> 00:51:26.620
through rose colored glasses thinking it's the shit.
And,

842
00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:31.420
and then you're down there and you're in your house and you got your little

843
00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:32.860
fucking job or whatever,

844
00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:36.750
and then you're going to start hating the people down there with their pony

845
00:51:36.751 --> 00:51:41.600
tails and they're fucking Miami vice tank tops.
Um,

846
00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:45.460
their criminal records,
the meth problem,
the alligators,

847
00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.750
the fucking brutal,
brutal,
brutal humidity.

848
00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:53.110
The mosquitoes the size of a fucking golf ball.

849
00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:55.083
<v 6>Uh,</v>

850
00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:58.060
<v 1>yeah,
I mean,</v>

851
00:51:58.770 --> 00:51:59.210
<v 0>yeah,</v>

852
00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:02.840
<v 1>did some nice places in Florida.
And then there's the rest of Florida.</v>

853
00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:04.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

854
00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.500
<v 1>It's either,
it's,
yeah,
it's a different deal dude.</v>

855
00:52:07.501 --> 00:52:12.270
And they just being an east coast guy and coming down from,
I dunno,

856
00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:14.750
I mean,
but you're a young guy.
It's one of those things that it's,

857
00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:18.600
it's something that is recoverable.
You can definitely get out of it.

858
00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:22.260
I would more be more apt to tell you to go down there if you were single,

859
00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:27.900
you know,
go down a single,
get a fucking flop house to stay in,
check it out,

860
00:52:27.901 --> 00:52:31.140
see how you like it.
But just know that when you leave,

861
00:52:31.141 --> 00:52:33.810
you leave in all that food,
you'll leave it,
all that culture,

862
00:52:33.811 --> 00:52:36.570
you'll leave in all your sports teams.
Cause you say here,
by the way,

863
00:52:36.571 --> 00:52:41.190
thank God hockey is back.
I can go back to not giving a shit about basketball.

864
00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:42.790
Go island is fuck the rangers.

865
00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:44.283
<v 6>MMM.</v>

866
00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.650
<v 1>You're going to miss that down there,
dude.
You're going to have the lightening,</v>

867
00:52:47.651 --> 00:52:51.220
which is actually a great fucking franchise,
great franchise.

868
00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:55.420
And you have the panthers.
So,
um,

869
00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:56.450
<v 0>yeah,</v>

870
00:52:56.450 --> 00:53:01.110
<v 1>I dunno man.
You just got to,
what would I do if I was you?</v>

871
00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:03.600
Um,
I would get,
I would learn to figure out why.

872
00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:08.780
It's actually something I'm learning how to do.
I'm so,
I'm trying not to have

873
00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:14.800
let people affect me is that much like I love living in la in every time I get

874
00:53:14.801 --> 00:53:19.460
my fucking car
it takes me about,

875
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:23.840
sometimes I don't even get off my street and I yell at the person in front of
me.

876
00:53:23.841 --> 00:53:28.740
I just go,
just fucking go.

877
00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:30.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

878
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:33.620
<v 1>And then I left going like,
dude,
you didn't,
you I can still see my house.</v>

879
00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.110
I'm already this mad.

880
00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:36.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

881
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:41.100
<v 1>And I sit there talking to myself going,
they had the worst fucking driver's.</v>

882
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:45.630
Oh yeah,
go slower.
Slower.
Yeah.
Take it,
take all day.
All Day.
There you go.

883
00:53:45.631 --> 00:53:47.600
They slower slow it down.
Yeah,

884
00:53:47.601 --> 00:53:50.640
I hit the brakes when they go to make a right turn.

885
00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:54.050
These people out here like that whole,

886
00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.890
I mean you said you liked the southern vibe.
Like you know,

887
00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:02.090
we're on the front of the beat.
If you look at it musically,

888
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.810
you've got the front of the beat on the beat and then laid back at the back of

889
00:54:05.811 --> 00:54:10.640
the beat.
We East Coast fucking people meeting Boston,

890
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:14.510
New York,
Philly,
we're fucked.
We get to DC.

891
00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:17.270
Start getting a little bit of that sadness.
Little bit of it,

892
00:54:17.271 --> 00:54:19.130
little bit of it sneaking in layer.

893
00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:22.850
But W we're fucking like we on your shit.

894
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:26.840
No Huddle fucking full court press.
That is our energy.

895
00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:31.960
So just know that you're going from that to like a Yay.
Sit down there man.

896
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:35.120
Have yourself a biscuit.
Let me tell you a story.
You know,
they just fucking,

897
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:40.280
you know,
arm out the window.
I got all fucking day.
Just no sense.

898
00:54:40.281 --> 00:54:43.940
No sense of urgency like the Texans on their second to last drive.

899
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:47.213
<v 0>Uh,</v>

900
00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:49.351
<v 1>dude,</v>

901
00:54:49.351 --> 00:54:51.990
I would definitely go down there and check it out before you do and really think

902
00:54:51.991 --> 00:54:55.430
about all this stuff that you're leaving behind and that whole thing that,

903
00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:57.900
you know,
me and my wife are going to be professionals.

904
00:54:57.901 --> 00:55:01.320
The job market should be wide open.
When I think of Florida,

905
00:55:01.321 --> 00:55:03.030
I think of foreclosed homes.

906
00:55:03.031 --> 00:55:07.340
Like those people really got fucked down there.
Uh,

907
00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:11.850
there's a lot of you,
I check out the job market before you get down there.

908
00:55:11.851 --> 00:55:12.684
Before.

909
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:15.780
I don't know if the only thing you got going for yourself as you're 24 so you

910
00:55:15.781 --> 00:55:20.190
can still go for broke at that age.
But,
uh,

911
00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:21.120
I dunno,

912
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.790
I would learn to like people be a little more tolerant because you're going to

913
00:55:23.791 --> 00:55:26.880
go down there and eventually,
what do they say about Florida?

914
00:55:26.881 --> 00:55:31.010
Sunny place for shady people.
You know,
it,

915
00:55:31.011 --> 00:55:33.830
that's sort of like you're going to run into a lot of people look like dog,

916
00:55:33.831 --> 00:55:36.950
the bounty hunter when you're down there.
All I'm saying,

917
00:55:36.951 --> 00:55:41.590
unless you go to fucking Miami.
Anyways.
Hello Mr [inaudible].

918
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:44.860
Uh,
what does this pathetic cheater?
Uh,

919
00:55:44.861 --> 00:55:46.780
I am currently a high school freshmen.

920
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:51.460
My dilemma and or issue is my father hit my mother and married and had been for

921
00:55:51.461 --> 00:55:52.710
the past six years.
My,

922
00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:54.110
<v 0>okay.</v>

923
00:55:54.110 --> 00:55:57.190
<v 1>Okay.
So this is my obviously a second marriage here for somebody.
Uh,</v>

924
00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:01.970
my mom has been divorced.
There we go before with my brother's father.
Oof.

925
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.810
This is like one of those math problems.
If a train is leaving,
um,

926
00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:09.370
she married my dad when I was seven probably.

927
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:14.740
Did you just like dictate this and somebody like typed it out?

928
00:56:14.741 --> 00:56:18.490
This is very conversational.
She married my dad when I was a seven probably.

929
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:22.660
She stayed with him through a lot of physical fighting,
previous cheating,

930
00:56:22.661 --> 00:56:24.730
and she believes he's still a good guy.

931
00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:28.560
He's currently unemployed and has been for almost three years in claims.

932
00:56:28.561 --> 00:56:32.740
He's sick of not working,
but every time my mom tries to apply him for a job,

933
00:56:32.741 --> 00:56:33.940
he gets an attitude,

934
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:38.350
which I think if you're a male and you're not the provider of your family and

935
00:56:38.351 --> 00:56:42.250
are in no rush,
no rush to be the provider,

936
00:56:42.251 --> 00:56:43.990
it makes you a bitch of a man.

937
00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:45.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

938
00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:46.890
<v 1>That's his job,
isn't it?</v>

939
00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:48.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

940
00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:49.690
<v 1>Um,
so it was,</v>

941
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:54.310
as of recently being the last three years after moving my,

942
00:56:54.311 --> 00:56:59.140
what the fuck?
So as of recently being the last three years after moving,

943
00:56:59.141 --> 00:57:04.141
my mom has been the sole source of income and he's been home every day

944
00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:08.160
collecting unemployment of 200 bucks,
uh,

945
00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:12.430
laying on his ass doing nothing but calling up random hideous women and going

946
00:57:12.431 --> 00:57:14.980
behind her back on random dating websites,

947
00:57:14.981 --> 00:57:18.760
claiming things he wants to do sexually to these random women.

948
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.650
Jesus Christ.

949
00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:24.800
Sounds like the Dwight Yoakam character in sling blade.

950
00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:29.380
Get Out of my fucking house.
What'd you call the practice?

951
00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.510
Um,
I can't stand that I've known and haven't said anything,

952
00:57:34.511 --> 00:57:37.330
but I feel would crush my mom.
Yeah,
that's tough dude.

953
00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:41.620
Who's now reaching 50 and being cheated on twice.
Should I tell her

954
00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:47.660
oh,
twice before by other men?
Yeah,
it's a pattern.
She keeps picking the same guy,

955
00:57:47.661 --> 00:57:51.230
if that's what you're saying.
By the way,
he's cheating on my mom in front of me.

956
00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:53.930
Not Physically,
but he knows I know and doesn't care.

957
00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:56.540
He doesn't interact with me the way a father should.

958
00:57:56.870 --> 00:58:00.200
He's worthless in my opinion.
Sounds like it.
Jesus is depressing.

959
00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:04.070
What should I do?
It tears me apart.
I am shamed to be known as his son.

960
00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:08.180
I'm just lucky I have my mother,
my mother's father,

961
00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:11.300
to look down to the t

962
00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.430
that way I have,
oh,

963
00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:19.920
I'm just lucky to have my mother's father's looked down to a t.

964
00:58:19.921 --> 00:58:23.520
That way I have no physical connection with the Douche that is my father.

965
00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:27.660
And don't worry,
this won't reflect on me and how I'll be when I'm a parent.

966
00:58:27.661 --> 00:58:30.180
It only encourages me to do better,
dude,
I've got to tell you,

967
00:58:30.181 --> 00:58:31.380
that's about all you can do.

968
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:32.920
<v 0>Okay?</v>

969
00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:37.790
<v 1>All right.
That's about all you could do is just learn from this situation.</v>

970
00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:40.640
Try not to repeat it.
Um,

971
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:45.500
as far as telling your mother or not telling your mother,
uh,

972
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:47.203
I dunno,

973
00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:51.000
I'm going to give you bad advice here because my first thing is going to it.

974
00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:52.470
I Dunno.

975
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:56.760
I kind of got angry at that dude in the middle of that and I'm going to try to

976
00:58:56.761 --> 00:58:58.590
tell you to say something you shouldn't fucking say.

977
00:58:58.591 --> 00:59:02.760
So I don't know how many more years I'm doing trying to do the math.

978
00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.640
What do you got a couple more years at home?
Just fucking write it out.

979
00:59:05.641 --> 00:59:10.130
Get out of that house.
I,
you know,
dude,
I don't know.

980
00:59:10.131 --> 00:59:13.130
These are tough questions this week.
I don't fucking know.
What do you tell them?

981
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:18.990
If you feel like your mother's going to be able to hear that,

982
00:59:18.991 --> 00:59:20.790
take it in and kicked this bum out on his.

983
00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:23.623
<v 6>MMM.</v>

984
00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:25.951
<v 1>I mean,</v>

985
00:59:25.951 --> 00:59:28.990
there's plenty of dating sites and that type of shit out there for somebody who

986
00:59:28.991 --> 00:59:30.960
was 50,
I would think at this point.

987
00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.033
<v 6>MMM.</v>

988
00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.200
<v 1>It's gotta be some over 50,</v>

989
00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:41.030
not a bum ass piece of shit.com social networking or something.
I don't know.

990
00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.970
I don't do that.
That's up to you.
I don't,
I mean,

991
00:59:43.971 --> 00:59:47.690
I can't read two paragraphs of shit that,
that's,
that's that deep.

992
00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.353
<v 6>MMM.</v>

993
00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:55.510
<v 1>Mean.
That's fucking years of shit.
God,
I sound dumb.
Look,</v>

994
00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.500
the best thing I got out of that is that you're looking at this stuff objective,

995
01:00:00.501 --> 01:00:03.710
Lee saying,
I don't want to be that and I'm not going to be that.
Fuck that guy.

996
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:05.450
Uh,
that's what you should do.

997
01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:10.850
Your events should be live in this awesome life and go out and find yourself a

998
01:00:10.851 --> 01:00:14.570
great girl and build the life you want to build.
Go after your dreams.

999
01:00:14.571 --> 01:00:18.560
Make some money.
All right.
Move your mother into the house at some point.

1000
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:21.960
And I have a mother in law suite above the garage until that fucking bum,

1001
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.180
he can go sit on the sidewalk because he's not invited.
They golf.

1002
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:28.410
Maybe that can be your goal.
Um,
all right,

1003
01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:34.700
what do we got here?
I think that's it.
Is that it for this week's podcast?
Oh,

1004
01:00:34.701 --> 01:00:39.140
look at that.
Right in an hour.
Like fucking clockwork.
All right,
people,

1005
01:00:39.141 --> 01:00:42.760
I have actually,
you have to promote a couple of gigs if you don't mind.
Um,

1006
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:46.370
as well as amazon.com.
You know,
as always,
I say this every week,

1007
01:00:46.371 --> 01:00:49.700
if you want to buy something on amazon.com,
uh,
but you know,

1008
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:51.410
select to donate to this podcast.

1009
01:00:51.411 --> 01:00:56.411
If you go to the podcast page on bill.com B u r r and you click on the banner Ad

1010
01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:01.670
Amazon,
you click on that stuff,
you go to Amazon,
it's still the same price.

1011
01:01:01.671 --> 01:01:05.060
And they kicked me a little bit of money for sending you that way.

1012
01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.880
So you donate to the podcast that way.

1013
01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:12.260
And then I take a portion of those proceeds,
10% to be exact,

1014
01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:15.470
and I pass them on to the wounded warriors project.

1015
01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:17.860
And that way everybody fucking wins.
All right?

1016
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:21.920
Not Saying you have to buy anything on Amazon,
but if you're Ghana,
there's a way.

1017
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.640
There's a way to do it where everybody gets everybody.
Everybody's happy.

1018
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:29.300
How's that?
Right.
