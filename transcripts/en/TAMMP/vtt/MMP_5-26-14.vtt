1
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.850
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.090
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.170
May 26th,
uh,

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.990
2014 happy Memorial Day.

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.230
Happy Memorial Day.

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.420
Go to a per rage show,

7
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:23.421
Yo fucking rich back and go weed a bunch of burgers.

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.150
Um,

9
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.950
and then you'll get fucking shit face and say something that you shouldn't have

10
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.910
fucking said.
Maybe hit on your wife's sister.

11
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.450
You get punched in your fucking head.
Anyways,

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.560
if you can hear the echo in the room,
they're on back downstairs is the,

13
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.320
the project downstairs inches along.
Um,

14
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.260
you know those,
he listened to podcasts,
you know,
from a year and a half ago,

15
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.060
not even a year and a half,
14 months ago.
I had that fucking water damage.
Um,

16
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.150
I like to think it was a blessing in disguise because the part of the House

17
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.840
upstairs was immaculate and I had just redone that rump,
so that sucked.

18
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.820
But below it was,
it was,
it was a fucking tree fort.
It was shit,

19
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.100
it needs to be fucking replaced anyways.
It's a fucking had enough.

20
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.780
I didn't want to get into it.
And now of course they get under the house.

21
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.610
And what I already knew was because I had somebody do some electrical on my

22
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:21.444
house before,

23
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.470
he was cleaning up a little bit down there and he's in the crawl space,

24
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:27.090
which is right underneath my living room.

25
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.330
And I hear him down there every once in a while I was hearing this guy just

26
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:32.610
going,
what the fuck?

27
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.370
So I knew it wasn't good.

28
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.570
I knew it wasn't good and he told me that there was a lot of shit work down

29
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:44.400
there and I'm lucky I didn't have a fire.

30
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:49.401
And then he replaced most of it's so the foreman on this other job,

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.600
you know,
some of the stuff that they've taken out,
they actually,
you know,

32
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.150
accidentally disconnected the phone.
You know,

33
00:01:57.151 --> 00:02:01.890
bullshit happens as these guys work on your house.
So,
you know,
he reiterated,

34
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.200
you know,
he didn't use the F bomb,

35
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:09.201
but I could tell by what he was talking about that I had some issues in the

36
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:13.770
electrical to pot in my house.
So,

37
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.030
um,
you know,
I'm going to get that all taken care of.

38
00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:22.620
Which brings me to my question here,
solar power.
Everybody,

39
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.540
can I take five minutes just to be a fucking hippie man.

40
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.240
Um,
every once in a while I go in and out of my fucking,
you know,

41
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.650
um,
with the team and now and then,
and then I'm against the team,
you know,

42
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.140
kind of like a fuck in,
uh,
like a Randy Moss,

43
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.160
you know,
you're coming to town,
you got your mind right.

44
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.610
And after about a season and a half,
you start acting like a fucking maniac.

45
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:55.150
That's how I feel when I look at,
uh,
whatever the fuck and explore.

46
00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.130
I'm really trying to avoid the expression,
the powers that be,
but,

47
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.900
um,
I dunno,

48
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.280
I can't help it every time when I land in Los Angeles and I look out at the

49
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:07.990
basin as they call it,

50
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.270
I'm from the San Gabriel mountains all the way south of that,

51
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.240
which is fucking La and greater la,
all of that,

52
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.650
just what an absolute clusterfuck it is.
And um,

53
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.130
what happens when the shit hits the fan?

54
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.160
So I'm thinking about getting some solar panels and I know all you rednecks out

55
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:33.740
there saying the obvious thing,
right?
Fuck good.
Just solar pane.
I'm going to do,

56
00:03:33.741 --> 00:03:34.850
if he ain't got a gun,

57
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.660
what are you going to keep the guy warm that fucking shoot you in the head.

58
00:03:38.661 --> 00:03:41.120
Steels you previsions I understand.

59
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.710
They're fucking bearded.
Wonder.
All right,
I get it.

60
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.940
But one step at a time.
One step at a fucking time.

61
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.860
First thing I want to do,
I want to get,
it was ridiculous.

62
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.270
I live in a fucking desert,
the house,
big sin,
the sun and I'm,

63
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.620
I still have,
I don't have solar power.
It's the dumbest shit ever.

64
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.020
So,
uh,
I'm going to look into it and I want,
I want to know is,
is,

65
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.860
you know,
is it two types of solar power?

66
00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:15.860
There's one where you're still on the grid and then there's one where you're off

67
00:04:15.861 --> 00:04:16.490
the grid.

68
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.900
I like off the grid and if anybody's listening to my podcast,

69
00:04:20.901 --> 00:04:25.090
if you're off the grid,
like what happens?
Did they like get,

70
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.210
do they get mad at you?

71
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.890
I mean,
how do they know?
Because all of a sudden your bill goes down.

72
00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:36.410
Does that like set off a light,
you know,

73
00:04:36.411 --> 00:04:39.650
and underneath the mountain that all those Illuminati guys live in and then

74
00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:42.260
somebody pulls up to your house.
Say,
I noticed you,

75
00:04:42.261 --> 00:04:46.550
I haven't been making any toasts lately.
And uh,

76
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:48.050
you know what's going on here?

77
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.120
<v 2>Okay.</v>

78
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.560
<v 0>How come you're not,
you're not watching TV.</v>

79
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:53.350
What are you reading books in their fucking eaten apples off the tree.

80
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.690
How come you're not using any electrical,
uh,
tricity there?
Does that happen?

81
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.620
Is it,
it's not illegal to be off the grid.
They just sort of fucking a,

82
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.460
<v 2>okay.</v>

83
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.030
<v 0>Do they bully you at all?
Like,
just let me know what I'm in for.
All right.</v>

84
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.770
Because what I would love to do is it continue spending my legal tender that

85
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:21.010
really has nothing behind it other than the faith of every freckled face cut

86
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:25.990
over here.
Um,
I would really love to continue existing in this,

87
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:29.710
but I would like to have the backup that if the shit does hit the fan

88
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.130
<v 2>okay.</v>

89
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.730
<v 0>Before I'm overrun by a mob,
you know,</v>

90
00:05:34.731 --> 00:05:37.960
because mine's the only light on the top of the hill.
See,
that's ice.

91
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.000
Do a bit about that.
That's the thing,
like if you actually have,

92
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.830
if you're off the grid,
all right?
And everything just goes fucking haywire.

93
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.060
You immediately,
you've got to cut your lights out quick.
Okay?

94
00:05:50.061 --> 00:05:53.120
Because the first thing when everybody loses power,
they stand that go,
oh,

95
00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:58.040
you gotta be fucking shitting me.
I was watching two broke girls,
right?

96
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:03.000
That's the first thing
you flipped the switches is it then,

97
00:06:03.001 --> 00:06:06.400
then you know within 30 seconds you're like,
is it just our house?

98
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.920
And you look out the window.
So you basically,

99
00:06:08.921 --> 00:06:13.450
you have 30 fucking seconds to cut all your lights off.

100
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.710
Tell your wife does shut the fuck up and get downstairs and that little corner

101
00:06:20.831 --> 00:06:25.630
room.
All right.
And you put your hand on a shoulder.

102
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:27.520
<v 2>Okay?</v>

103
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.180
<v 0>Normally you don't hurt him,
but you're not affectionate.</v>

104
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.610
You place your hand on her shoulder.

105
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.630
So she knows that some pertinent fucking information is on the way.
And you say,

106
00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:38.464
honey,

107
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.500
we're the only ones left are the other ones that look at me.
Stop crying.

108
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.780
We're the only one.
We're the only ones left with power.

109
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.150
And I need you to hold it together.
Cry It out.

110
00:06:55.151 --> 00:07:00.040
Now I want you to cry every ounce of bitch you have in you,

111
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.150
out of you and this corner in this house,
okay?

112
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.650
And when you come upstairs,

113
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.020
I want you to sit here and act like we do not have power.
Okay?

114
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.880
So when the Sullivan's come across the fucking street and see if we don't have

115
00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:18.550
power,
why did their fucking faces

116
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.550
ani?
Forget about the cell.

117
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.720
They're not going to make you understand.
Yeah.

118
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.920
I don't want that to happen.
I don't want that to happen to anybody,

119
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:36.070
but I don't want to be the Sullivan.
You know what I mean?

120
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.350
I want a shot.
Just give me a fucking shot.
That's all I need.

121
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.360
I just need some solar panels and a fucking helicopter and I will get the fuck

122
00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:50.680
outta here.
That's what you need.
You fucking 80 switch it guns,

123
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.800
Huh?
What are you Schwartzenegger how long is that gonna last?
Um,

124
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.230
anyways,
so I'm thinking about it.
Does anybody,
is anybody live in the La area?

125
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:04.920
Does anybody have solar panels anywhere in the fucking world?
Can you recommend,

126
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.510
are there two different kinds?

127
00:08:06.511 --> 00:08:11.511
Because I actually looked up solar panels off the grid and uh,

128
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:16.130
I came to this place a blue Pacific solar,

129
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.560
it says off grid packages.
Um,

130
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.010
then there's another one that just says get solar power,

131
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.550
Sun power off grid systems.
Off Grid System.

132
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.600
Backwoods solar electric systems.
Yeah,

133
00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:33.990
I kind of stole that Shit.
Well,

134
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.530
what we're gonna do is we're going to bring it in and we'll just run it over the

135
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.470
outhouse.
Well,
what

136
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.540
Cabana?
W what's that?
A cigar.
I'm

137
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.270
sorry,
I'm going to stupid fucking load this week.
MMM.

138
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.960
Yeah.
Oh,
then there's one for Australia.

139
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.800
I don't mind paying the grid,
but I would like to have,

140
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.970
if the grid fails to have the then off the grid switch.
How about that?

141
00:09:06.971 --> 00:09:11.720
Can we just have that,
those of you who've been on the Internet this week,

142
00:09:11.721 --> 00:09:13.880
you know the direction that I'm working in.
Oh yes.

143
00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:17.330
Should do the stop being modest.
Do you know the direction I'm going?

144
00:09:17.331 --> 00:09:22.040
And I'm talking about solar fucking Rhodes.
Has anybody seen this,

145
00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:25.450
this youtube video?
It's fucking amazing if,

146
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.810
if what they're saying is true about these solar roads.
Um,

147
00:09:29.811 --> 00:09:32.690
and I apologize for the narrator.
I get what he's doing.

148
00:09:32.691 --> 00:09:35.180
He's trying to keep it interesting,

149
00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:38.420
but he kept it interesting too long and then he brings it down to an interlude,

150
00:09:38.421 --> 00:09:41.420
which should have come a minute earlier and then he goes back to scream.

151
00:09:41.421 --> 00:09:44.600
And so it's a little bit annoying,
but,
uh,

152
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.710
just try to listen to the information and then try not to get sucked into a

153
00:09:48.711 --> 00:09:52.820
George Bush Obama debate because,
uh,

154
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.690
I dunno,
I dunno if these things,
what the fuck do I know?
Right?

155
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.460
But it just basically saying,

156
00:09:58.461 --> 00:10:03.461
if we replaced all our roads with these solar fucking things that literally

157
00:10:03.711 --> 00:10:03.891
look,

158
00:10:03.891 --> 00:10:08.180
makes it look like Lego land and it's all lit up and there'd be sensors to let

159
00:10:08.181 --> 00:10:08.451
you know,

160
00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:11.540
a deer's going around the corner and then it would just light up in the turn a,

161
00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:14.630
there's a fucking deer around the corner,
you know,

162
00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:18.890
enjoy your barley pancakes or whatever.
Right?
Some fucking full on Hippie Shit.

163
00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:23.891
And that basically the amount of energy that it would create would be three

164
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.410
times what this country even needed,

165
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.700
which immediately we can just leave the Middle East.
Right?

166
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.900
We don't have to be over there pissing them off by getting in the middle of

167
00:10:36.901 --> 00:10:37.734
their bullshit.

168
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.823
<v 2>All right.</v>

169
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.730
<v 0>We don't have to deal with oil and oil money is what funds the terrorist as far</v>

170
00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:50.710
as my limited reading goes.
Right?
The,
the,
the families over there that,

171
00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:55.060
fuck,
hang on,
she's scratching.
I just gave you a bath.
What's wrong?

172
00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:01.990
Oh,
um,
anyways,

173
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.970
uh,
yeah,
like the fucking the,

174
00:11:05.971 --> 00:11:08.640
the oil people over the people who make all the money over there,

175
00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:13.560
they then donate to mosques.
And then in the mosque,
they fucking,

176
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:17.250
you know,
kind of fucking a,
you know,

177
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.980
send it over to these fucking people over here.

178
00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:22.650
That ended up coming back at US shooting shit at us as far as you know,

179
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.490
like I said,
I don't know shit.
Cleo,
would you stop fucking,

180
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.870
you're going to have to go to the other room here.
Come here buddy.
What's up?

181
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:35.100
Sweden?
We went on a nice hike today,
didn't we?
Huh?
If we good.

182
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.660
All right,
get out of here.
Um,
so anyways,
um,

183
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.860
yeah,
and then that whole fucking thing is just null and void.

184
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.660
We have all this extra power actually.
Did we create a bunch of jobs?

185
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.940
The only thing I don't know is the way it looks.

186
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.770
It doesn't seem like it's a smooth ride.

187
00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:57.430
It just seems like the whole time he'd be going like over these fucking things.

188
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.480
I have no idea,
but just check it out and I swear to God,

189
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.560
because this is something that I don't know if it,
if it is,
if it does work,

190
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.160
if it does fucking work,
it could benefit everybody.

191
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.360
Conservatives,
liberals,
independence,

192
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:18.460
everyone who wouldn't benefit from all of this energy,
all that.
Right?

193
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.140
The people in power.
Oh,
how could I forget that?
That's right.

194
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:26.350
How do you think that they're going to derail this if this actually becomes a

195
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:31.210
movement,
how will they somehow tie in terrorism?

196
00:12:31.211 --> 00:12:35.970
Nine 11 liberals fucking right wing conservatives and just get the,

197
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.630
the pot fucking stern so everybody's screaming and yelling.
It was good.

198
00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:44.810
It will be for heaven,
a glimpse batches and the babies will starve.

199
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.650
They're going to do all of that shit.
Um,

200
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.100
the only way this thing gets off the ground,
if it works,

201
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:52.893
if it works,

202
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:58.380
is if people don't get sucked into those arguments and we all become one and we

203
00:12:59.441 --> 00:13:03.940
all pick up a hatchet and we start marching towards the bankers.

204
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.890
Gated communities.
Okay?
Because the asphalt streets,

205
00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:13.891
we'll have to run red with blue blood money before something wonderful like this

206
00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:17.470
will ever fucking happen because you are fucking with,

207
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.333
<v 2>okay.</v>

208
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:24.470
<v 0>A century and a half of cashflow going to a small amount of people.</v>

209
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.570
That's what you fucking with.
And when you're fucking with something like that,

210
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.820
that level of money,
basically the money that gives the dollar power,

211
00:13:35.821 --> 00:13:39.510
like the only thing gives the u s dollar powers that oil barrels of oil are

212
00:13:39.511 --> 00:13:42.960
still measured in US dollars.
Other than that,
it's a fucking shit show.

213
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.810
So these guys are the guys behind all of that.

214
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:49.710
It's them in the fucking bankers and that's it.
All right.

215
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:53.040
The insurance companies like the Ted Kennedy or that fucking family.
All right,

216
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.490
but fucking Bobby and Jack.
All right.

217
00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.560
Actually the banks have fucking Joe Kennedy.
All right.

218
00:14:00.561 --> 00:14:04.590
They'll shut up with the Kennedy Shit.
All right.
So anyways,
that's my thing.

219
00:14:04.591 --> 00:14:07.410
Like this is a great fucking idea.
If it works,
if it works,

220
00:14:07.411 --> 00:14:11.610
it's a fucking great idea.
Even if you just did a few roads,

221
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.470
if he just did a few of them,

222
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.700
each state just did like their main highway or whatever.

223
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.010
If you just did that,

224
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.410
I can't imagine the amount of of money it would save and on the less than a man

225
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.090
who was in the possibilities of it are incredible.
I don't know if it works,

226
00:14:30.091 --> 00:14:34.800
but it is fucking incredible.
But the sad thing is,
um,

227
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.060
the fact that whenever new stuff like this comes up,

228
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.450
it all just turns into a Obama,

229
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.160
Bush,
Republican,
Democrat,
blah,
blah.

230
00:14:46.161 --> 00:14:49.230
And everybody's just yelling at each other and then it just fucking goes away.

231
00:14:49.231 --> 00:14:54.140
And then everybody turns on sports.
And that's what happens.
So that you go,

232
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.160
this is all off the grid,
Billy,
15 minutes of crazy talk.

233
00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:03.080
But that makes sense to me.
Makes sense to me,
man.
Fuck,
you know,

234
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.270
we get
so fucking weird,
bro.

235
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.520
All them liberals out there in Hollywood,
right?
And I get to tell you,
I'm not,

236
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:17.270
I'm,
I'm not just making fun of stereotypical southern guy.
All right,

237
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.400
because I haven't lived out here in Hollywood.

238
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.630
These people are out of their fucking mind state there.
Fox News to the left,

239
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.100
they're out of their fucking minds.

240
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.080
Does such fucking hypocrites where it's just like,

241
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.820
you can say the most,
uh,
I guess racist isn't the word.

242
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:39.500
Cause you can make fun of white people,
rich,
white people.
You,
you can basically,

243
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:41.060
you can be a,

244
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.420
you can use the exact fucking thing that they don't like seeing used on poor

245
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:47.720
people against rich people,
and they fucking love it.
You know,

246
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.710
you can suggest that people from the south are all fucking this sisters and

247
00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:56.480
they're slapping their knees and they're doing the wave in the crowd.
All right?

248
00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:01.630
But if you suggest any homeless guy needs to get off his fucking ass,

249
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.110
stop boozing and get a fucking job,
then you're the devil.
So,
I mean,
I don't know.

250
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.300
Does that make any sense?
Well,
it shouldn't.

251
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:13.780
Isn't that why you listen to this podcast?
You cunts.
Alrighty.

252
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.450
Then let's,
uh,
let's do a little bit of advertisements.

253
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.310

Um,

256

You're a business owner,

Our old friends,
dollar shave club,
dollar shave club,
everybody.

280
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.970
There are so many things that piss me off.
Not having solar robes.

281
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.160
The fact that I rented a Chevy Impala this week cause my truck's getting fixed

282
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.400
and it's supposed to be the flagship one with the v eight that when I'm on the

283
00:18:07.401 --> 00:18:10.700
slightest little bill at bit of a hill and I go to put it in reverse,

284
00:18:10.701 --> 00:18:15.500
it rolls forward a little bit like some hunk of crap from the 70s come on Chevy.

285
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:16.820
You can do better than that.

286
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.780
Those are a few things that piss me off and you know what else pisses me off?
Oh,

287
00:18:20.781 --> 00:18:24.320
he's coming around again.
Everybody pay way too much to shave.

288
00:18:24.321 --> 00:18:28.640
My freckled face is definitely up there.
Ah,

289
00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.850
nothing feels better than shaving with the fresh new blade.

290
00:18:31.851 --> 00:18:36.240
Everybody but new razors are so ridiculously expensive that you can't afford a

291
00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:38.300
change your blade more than once every six months.

292
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.210
So you end up scalp and you're faced with an old blade.
Come on,

293
00:18:41.211 --> 00:18:44.450
we've all been there.
Dollar Shave,
you change your blade as much as you change.

294
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.620
You've got to buy new deodorant.

295
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:50.030
That's basically the deal unless you have with Donald Trump,
you know,

296
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.830
and then you pretend you have money for blades.

297
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.620
You drive around your dumb helicopter with your name on the back.

298

You know,
for years I used to sit there going,

314
00:19:53.141 --> 00:19:56.140
why the fuck does it cost so much?
God Damn money,
you know?

315
00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.680
But all I did was talk about it.
That's son of a bitch.
Went out and did it.

316
00:19:59.681 --> 00:20:04.450
Now he's the millionaire.
Oh Jesus.
All right,
let's talk sports here.

317
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:09.910
All right,
let's start with the NBA.
Something I never watch,

318
00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:14.140
but you know,
it's the conference finals.
I've had some downtime.

319
00:20:14.141 --> 00:20:16.810
So basically what I've been doing is,
um,
it's the,

320
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.740
the hockey conference finals and the BNB conference finals.

321
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:24.640
So what I do is I take the NBA game as I watch the NHL game live.

322
00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.120
And then the following morning I watch the NBA game and I got to tell you,

323
00:20:28.121 --> 00:20:32.980
it's been a slice of heaven.
It's been a slice of heaven.
Um,

324
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.821
and you know what?

325
00:20:33.821 --> 00:20:38.290
I got back into NBA hoop and I got back into the simplicity and the beauty of

326
00:20:38.291 --> 00:20:40.950
just coming out there with a ball,
trying to put it through a heel.

327
00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.890
Hope it's a fucking pure game.
It is a wonderful game.

328
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.410
If those fucking reps we just got with it,

329
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.090
they would just relax.
Classic example,

330
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.810
I don't even know who won this game yet and I'm going to go watch it as I
upload.

331
00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.370
I've only watched the first quarter of the last Okc,
uh,

332
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.910
San Antonio Spurs game.
All right?

333
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.800
Now as far as I understand,

334
00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:08.860
the job of the referee is to keep the game under control,

335
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.300
keep the game under control and let the players decide who's going to win the

336
00:21:13.301 --> 00:21:17.650
fucking game.
All right?
I watched the first quarter of the game.
All right.

337
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:18.840
Okay.

338
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.730
So He's already in trouble cause that surge a Baka guys that how you say his

339
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:26.230
name,
the big man.
His heart.
All right,
so he's on the elliptical.

340
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:29.410
So they got Kendrick Perkins in there and what is the fucking ref do?

341
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.730
Gives him three fucking bowls,
two different bullshit fucking calls.

342
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.230
And puts the guy in the bench.
They already got one guy in the elliptical,

343
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:38.861
you know,

344
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:42.190
they need Kendrick Parkins and you give them two bolts to guide fucking three

345
00:21:42.191 --> 00:21:45.670
files in the first quarter.
The last two,
I swear to God,

346
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.910
he was standing there scratching his ass and they gave him a file.

347
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.740
Then I watched him with the,
who's,
who's the guy there?
Who,
who,
you know,

348
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.530
uh,
what the fuck's his name?

349
00:21:56.531 --> 00:22:00.800
That point guard who sometimes turns into an eight year old,
uh,

350
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.780
begins with a w why do I keep thinking with their spine?
Because I'm old.

351
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.890
You know what I'm talking about?
That fucking guy,
right?

352
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.730
Manou [inaudible],
whatever his name is,

353
00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:16.540
that Guy Refuses to shave his fucking head steals the ball from him.

354
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.940
All right,
so you see the fucking guy,
he turns into the eight year old,

355
00:22:21.941 --> 00:22:25.570
he runs right up and tries to slap it away from,
takes a file and he,
you know,

356
00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:28.810
when he's sitting there,
he doesn't even look at the ref.
He says something like,

357
00:22:28.811 --> 00:22:32.080
that's fucking bullshit.
And the ref is standing there staring at them.

358
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.220
How do I know we staring at them?
Because even the guy announcing the game,

359
00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:36.911
Reggie Miller,

360
00:22:36.911 --> 00:22:40.360
I think it was was going that ref should have fucking given them the file and

361
00:22:40.361 --> 00:22:44.800
walked away.
He stands there.
Not only stands,
it stands there staring at him,

362
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.440
waiting from this.
Say something.
Now I know,

363
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.460
I know this guy probably has a fucking reputation for doing that,

364
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.050
but it's just like that.

365
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:57.550
It's a complete fucking abuse of power and these guys,

366
00:22:57.551 --> 00:23:01.000
their job is to to keep the game under control,

367
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.930
not control the pace of the game.
And that's what I fucking hate about the NBA.

368
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:09.940
All right there.
Okay there.
Sorry.

369
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:14.440
I got my fucking Tampon mentality this week,

370
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:17.680
but it's the fucking thing that I cannot stand about the NBA,

371
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:21.070
that goddamn officiating,
whether it's fixed or not,
I don't fucking know.

372
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.450
But those guys,
they need to relax.
Clear.
What is the problem?

373
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.350
What is the problem?
I just gave you a bath.

374
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.730
I wrenched your good
fucking thing.

375
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.480
I feel,
you know,
it's such a ridiculous level how much I love that dog.

376
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.470
Even know what the thing that drives me nuts drives me nuts.
Um,

377
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:50.810
anyways,
but it's still great.
What a great series.
Uh,
even at woke,

378
00:23:50.811 --> 00:23:53.900
Casey is down at this point,
two games than,

379
00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.470
I don't know if it's three at this point.
It's just,
I dunno,

380
00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:01.340
Spurs are fun to watch.
Okay.
See,
he's fun to watch and uh,
you know,

381
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.800
as much,
I imagine pacer fans are frustrated with their team,
you know,

382
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.770
they just don't know how to win yet.
They,
they,
you know what they liked.

383
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:14.620
They liked the little brother that's big enough at this point to finally win a

384
00:24:14.621 --> 00:24:16.890
fight against his older brother.
But the,
the,

385
00:24:16.891 --> 00:24:20.650
the older brother has a psychological advantage because he's been kicking their

386
00:24:20.651 --> 00:24:25.510
ass.
They're entire fucking life,
you know,
up,
hang on,
she's scratching again.

387
00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:30.480
Um,
that's their problem.
You know,

388
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.910
I dunno.
Jason Law had knows the game better than me.

389
00:24:32.911 --> 00:24:36.060
He also says that coach stinks and Larry Bird should literally walked down and

390
00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.013
fire the guy

391
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.870
during the game and just take over because he's getting brutally out coached.

392
00:24:42.871 --> 00:24:47.340
I have no idea.
I'm actually happy that I'm watching the NBA again.
Again,

393
00:24:47.341 --> 00:24:50.880
I just wish these fucking rests would just put their fucking whistles away

394
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:57.020
or at least just be consistent.
I they had the fucking worst.

395
00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.740
And I know when every sport you can have bad officiating and he can have shit

396
00:25:00.741 --> 00:25:05.480
calls,
but like the NBA is,
is at the top of the fucking list.

397
00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:06.700
<v 2>Okay.</v>

398
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.730
<v 0>Cause it goes beyond bad calls that go because what their power,</v>

399
00:25:09.731 --> 00:25:14.590
they can put guys on the bench.
It's just fucking drives me nuts.
Relax bill.
Okay,

400
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:19.540
I will.
Um,
let's talk to some hockey here.
How about those fucking ray?

401
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:26.740
I have never,
I can't,
I did the last time I was just wrong about somebody.
The,

402
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.470
the,
the fucking patriots traded bloop drew Bledsoe to the buffalo bills.

403
00:25:30.471 --> 00:25:32.480
And I was like,
that guy's going to come back to harness.

404
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.680
And I forgot that the poor bastard was playing for the fucking bills and it

405
00:25:36.681 --> 00:25:40.740
isn't his fault where I thought they were going to come back and kill us.
Um,

406
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.940
and I also thought that Tom Brady got lucky as first year.
That's what I thought.

407
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.190
See,
so I don't know shit.
And how's that?

408
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.510
Just have not been believing in the ranges in here.
They are one game away.

409
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.730
Ladies and gentlemen,

410
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.760
the New York's fucking rangers who tortured their fans every fucking year except

411
00:25:58.581 --> 00:26:03.020
1994.
Since 1940.
They've been torturing those motherfuckers.

412
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:07.280
They are one game away from going to the Stanley Cup finals.
Um,

413
00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:11.230
it's been a great,
so what have fucking game that was and it could easily be two,

414
00:26:11.231 --> 00:26:15.230
two,
um,
just an incredible game yesterday.
And um,

415
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.050
I really enjoyed,
uh,

416
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:23.040
I've really been enjoying that series because I know the Canadians aren't going

417
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:27.990
to quit.
I think they're going to win the next one.
And uh,

418
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:32.100
then there'll be games six.
It's gonna fuck and you know,

419
00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.530
add pressure to the ranges.
Like fuck,
we can't lose this one.

420
00:26:34.531 --> 00:26:37.230
Cause it was like we don't want to game seven with these guys.

421
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.720
I'm basically praying foot boat series,

422
00:26:39.721 --> 00:26:43.390
both the king's hawks and the a rangers,

423
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.880
Canadians to go seven games.
Same thing with the basketball,

424
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:49.600
even though it doesn't look like it's going to.
Yeah.

425
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.113
<v 3>MMM.</v>

426
00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.500
<v 0>I want more hockey,
more hoop.
Okay.</v>

427
00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:58.580
To bridge the gap between the end of those series.

428
00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.180
And the beginning of NFL football.
But then again,

429
00:27:02.181 --> 00:27:04.100
why am I shitting on the national pastime?

430
00:27:04.101 --> 00:27:07.160
Why don't I just fucking embrace that too?
That's what I should do.

431
00:27:07.161 --> 00:27:11.870
I don't fucking know.
But um,
and then then the hawks king series,

432
00:27:11.871 --> 00:27:13.340
it's just been fucking ridiculous.

433
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.313
<v 3>MMM.</v>

434
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:17.960
<v 0>The hawks came out,
game won it.</v>

435
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.840
They just look like what everybody thought they were.

436
00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:22.270
<v 3>Okay.</v>

437
00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.590
<v 0>Just as I guess date,
if they wanted to share,
they are considered a dynasty.</v>

438
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:28.900
Don't you know what's funny is the level,

439
00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:33.930
the amount of teams and how hard it is to win a championship has increased over

440
00:27:34.691 --> 00:27:38.800
the years.
That when I was a kid,
you had to win three in a row to be a dynasty.

441
00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.690
And then three and four years,

442
00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.500
like they gave it to the Patriots where we won one Buccaneers,
one.

443
00:27:44.501 --> 00:27:45.550
And then we won.
We won,

444
00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.220
we went three and four years and they said that was a dynasty.

445
00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:53.860
And now talkie Chicago one,
2010,

446
00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.240
2013 and then if they win again this year,

447
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.380
they were going to give them a dynasty.
Um,
whatever you want to call it,

448
00:28:02.381 --> 00:28:05.800
it's fucking impressive what they're doing because they lose guys every year.

449
00:28:05.801 --> 00:28:08.830
But there's somehow able to,
to not,
um,

450
00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.960
dip and quality like the way we did.
You know,
we made some moves,

451
00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.290
gathered a Tyler Sagan and some of those guys got a little bit older,

452
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.050
little little more inexperienced at the same time.

453
00:28:20.051 --> 00:28:24.010
And I think that hurt us in the end,
um,
with the hawks are doing amazing,

454
00:28:24.011 --> 00:28:25.900
but then the fucking kings come roaring back.

455
00:28:25.901 --> 00:28:30.901
Was it six to to just kick their ass and then the hawks come back.

456
00:28:32.121 --> 00:28:36.430
Game three I think.
And it is just,
that was just like a heavyweight battle.

457
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:40.810
Them just going at it and uh,
I can't,
can't wait.

458
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.970
If you listen to this podcast before game tonight,
jump on the fucking bandwagon.

459
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.800
If you just want to watch hockey at its highest level,

460
00:28:47.801 --> 00:28:50.170
watch the king's Hawk serious.
It's fucking insane.

461
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.090
I'm actually tried to get tickets for tonight.
Didn't work out.

462
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.170
I don't think it's gonna work out.

463
00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.310
Called up my connection and it ain't fucking happening there.
But,
uh,

464
00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:04.540
I'm definitely going to be watching that series dry.

465
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:09.100
Do you guys know I'm one day away from 40 days without a drop of booze?

466
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.660
Fucking brutal.
You know,
I swear to God,

467
00:29:13.661 --> 00:29:15.820
if I went to an AA meeting right now and they tried to give me one of those

468
00:29:15.821 --> 00:29:20.250
chips,
I'd throw it at him,
you know,
fucking throw it out.

469
00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:22.630
I'm just start screaming.
I'm not enjoying this.

470
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:25.063
<v 3>MMM.</v>

471
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.590
<v 0>I liked that.
I've lost some weight,
but uh,</v>

472
00:29:27.591 --> 00:29:30.560
I'm getting ready to do a special everybody and tickets are on sale.

473
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.210
If you want to be at the live taping of my next special so you can say to your

474
00:29:35.211 --> 00:29:39.950
loved ones,
I was there when that hour of filth was recorded.
Um,

475
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.480
I'll,
we'll have the link up.
Tickets are going fast.
Thank God.

476
00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:46.840
I'm going to be at the Tabernacle in,
um,

477
00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:47.960
<v 2>okay.</v>

478
00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.680
<v 0>Atlanta,
Georgia and I can't wait to come back.</v>

479
00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:55.540
It's one of my favorite theaters and uh,
I'm really hoping,
um,

480
00:29:56.610 --> 00:30:00.450
I dunno,
I'm nervous about this one,
man.
I got to try to top my last one,

481
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.500
which is the only thing you can really do is just try to top your last one.

482
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:09.380
And um,
I dunno.
Yeah,
I got to get myself in the mindset.

483
00:30:09.381 --> 00:30:13.850
I'm not in the mindset yet.
That mindset has to be where you don't give a fuck,

484
00:30:13.851 --> 00:30:17.100
but you do and you're having fun in your Improv.

485
00:30:17.101 --> 00:30:21.920
And like I would during a normal show,
which,
so I basically have to block out.

486
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:23.271
That's the thing,

487
00:30:23.271 --> 00:30:26.300
you block out that the cameras are there and then you also don't start thinking

488
00:30:26.301 --> 00:30:30.950
like,
oh fuck,
I missed a tag.
Who gives a fuck?
No,
we're just going to know,
okay,

489
00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.790
you're not documenting the joke,
your documentary thing,

490
00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:38.570
like that night's performance of the joke and that's the way it came up.

491
00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:42.290
I want you to do that.
Then you can fucking free yourself up.
So,

492
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.903
um,

493
00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:46.933
<v 2>yeah.</v>

494
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:48.660
<v 0>What am I just want to fucking do it already.</v>

495
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.770
I was supposed to be doing it the first week and I was going to do it in San

496
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.270
Francisco,
but uh,
the fucking unions up there,

497
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.080
Jesus Christ fucking beat.

498
00:30:58.081 --> 00:31:00.450
I'm pro unit beaten the shit out of me.

499
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:02.410
<v 2>Okay.</v>

500
00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:06.040
<v 0>You got to fucking hire 15 guys.
Do a bring a mic,</v>

501
00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:08.770
stand out on the fucking stage.
And I'm like,
well fuck this place.

502
00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.890
Don't go cross the street.
Yeah,
it's going to be 16 guys.

503
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.780
All right.
You know what all the leaves are Brown.

504
00:31:17.781 --> 00:31:22.550
Fuck this town.
I went to Atlanta.
I'm definitely coming back now.

505
00:31:22.551 --> 00:31:24.320
I'm just going to do,
I'm just going to do San Francisco.

506
00:31:24.321 --> 00:31:28.310
I'm just not going to fucking film there.
It's unreal.
You know,
bad.
I wanted to,

507
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:33.920
I want it to what those wacky unions.
Um,

508
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.930
anyways,
what else am I talking about here?
Um,

509
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:41.540
Jesus Christ and I did,

510
00:31:41.541 --> 00:31:44.270
I do all my topics already in my already into the questions.

511
00:31:44.271 --> 00:31:48.470
While I am 30 minutes in,
I'm,
I'm actually supposed to be going to a,

512
00:31:48.471 --> 00:31:51.320
a to a Blab Acu.
Um,

513
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.290
I had the guy actually all my buddies over on,
uh,

514
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.530
on Saturday and we watched game three of the king's game.

515
00:31:57.531 --> 00:32:00.380
Dude was fucking great and um,

516
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.133
<v 2>okay.</v>

517
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.050
<v 0>Grilled up some steaks.
I'm one of those guys too.
I don't give a fuck.</v>

518
00:32:05.051 --> 00:32:07.060
I'll let somebody,
somebody like,
man,
let me grill those up.

519
00:32:07.061 --> 00:32:10.030
Go ahead and grill them up.
I don't give a fuck.
You know,

520
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:14.980
I was upstairs making the fucking garlic mashed potatoes like a fucking lady.

521
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:18.520
I don't care.
I really don't give a fuck.

522
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.000
I know that really fucks with my man card that I have another guy come over here

523
00:32:22.001 --> 00:32:25.540
and jump on my grill.
I don't give a shit.
I really don't.

524
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:28.930
I just want to make sure people have drinks.
You know,

525
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:33.640
I'm up here wearing my apron.
I'm really in touch with my feminine side.

526
00:32:33.641 --> 00:32:36.280
When I turn on my grill loggerheads cooked on it.

527
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.040
Now court mccown fucking made the stakes on it.

528
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.110
You don't sound like I don't cook on it,
but I just thought,
I don't know.

529
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.190
The stakes looks so good.
I actually got some anxiety is like,

530
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:50.270
I don't want to fuck these up court through money handled them and I up to,

531
00:32:50.271 --> 00:32:51.950
I was up here and I made potatoes

532
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:59.800
a what?
A pussy.
Ah,
Jesus Christ.

533
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.250
I hope my dad doesn't listen to this.
Um,

534
00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:07.830
I got a couple of the frozen ones up there.
I'll throw mud.
Oh,

535
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:12.910
make them for me and my wife.
Ah,
what a pussy.
Anyways,
uh,

536
00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.320
sorry.
This just making me fucking laugh.
I really am dude.

537
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:21.310
I'm either a fucking type a Alpha male or I'm wearing an apron.

538
00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.400
I really am a Gemini.
It all depends on the situation.

539
00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.970
I will either not take an ounce of shit.
Oh,
I will let you roll.

540
00:33:27.971 --> 00:33:31.870
Right the fuck over me as I hand you my wallet.
It all depends on the situation.

541
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:37.530
Um,
yeah,
Bill,
it's called being a schizophrenia.
I go fuck yourself.
All right.

542
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.580
All right.
The big thing in my life is,
uh,

543
00:33:40.581 --> 00:33:45.581
yesterday I went out and I bought a new snare drum and I can't wait cause I

544
00:33:46.401 --> 00:33:50.450
bought this old Ludwig Kit and I know I've been straightening a long time.

545
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.580
It'd be doing these drum coverage,
but I'm getting close.

546
00:33:52.581 --> 00:33:54.710
I got my drum kit and uh,

547
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.930
I bought an early seventies green spot.
Go.
I'll fucking bottom sizes.

548
00:33:59.931 --> 00:34:02.180
So now Mike and they,
of course,
they never come with the snare.

549
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:03.980
I don't know what happens with the snare.

550
00:34:03.981 --> 00:34:07.340
People just want to keep the fucking snare and they break up the kit.

551
00:34:07.341 --> 00:34:08.990
So I went out,
you know,

552
00:34:08.991 --> 00:34:13.310
I was looking on the Internet trying to find a fucking 1971 Ludwig six and a

553
00:34:13.311 --> 00:34:16.520
half by 14 fucking snare.
And I just can't find,
I was just like,
you know what,

554
00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.480
why don't you just go buy a new one and then you know,

555
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.870
one comes along and you have whatever you add it to the fucking kid who gives a

556
00:34:23.871 --> 00:34:28.310
shit.
But,
uh,
I bought it.
And odd as it sounds sweet,
it's not sweet.

557
00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:31.520
And I've been practicing a lot.
I've been on the practice pad big time.

558
00:34:31.521 --> 00:34:35.900
And what I learned yesterday when I got behind the kit is the practice pad is

559
00:34:35.901 --> 00:34:37.970
not a drum kit.
And I sounded like shit.

560
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:44.020
And then what was funny was I went over to go buy a snare drum afterwards and

561
00:34:45.621 --> 00:34:49.550
when they were trying to see if they had a hard shell case for it,
I was uh,

562
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:52.400
I got down,
I sat on one of those,
The v drums,

563
00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.780
the electronic kits and um,

564
00:34:56.930 --> 00:35:01.600
those things sound so unbelievable.
Like,
I was joking with a buddy.
Now,

565
00:35:01.601 --> 00:35:04.400
Dean del Ray from the,
uh,

566
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:09.650
let there be talk podcasts and the all things comedy network,
you know,

567
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:13.670
we went over there together and uh,
I was joking with the most,

568
00:35:13.671 --> 00:35:16.370
with those electronic drums,
like you sit behind a real kit,
you're like,

569
00:35:16.371 --> 00:35:20.330
oh my God,
I suck.
Thank God nobody's here to listen to this.

570
00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.530
You get behind the electronic kits and you just like,
how come I'm not in a band?

571
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.060
I'm fucking awesome.

572
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.710
Like they sound so unbelievable and they're so forgiving.

573
00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.670
Um,
I sat down on those,
uh,
those v drums up tight right now.

574
00:35:34.671 --> 00:35:37.670
If you ever wanted to play drums and you're worried about how loud they're going

575
00:35:37.671 --> 00:35:41.970
to be and he just want to have fun,
you got to get,
get the Fucking v drums.

576
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:44.910
And this is not a commercial,
just get the,
this is just me saying this,

577
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:49.770
just get the Fucking v drums because you can actually control the volume of
them.

578
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:52.830
You can play in with headphones,
you can be downstairs,

579
00:35:52.831 --> 00:35:55.980
your wife can't even hear it.
Whatever your roommates or whatever.

580
00:35:55.981 --> 00:36:00.420
And if you live in an apartment,
all you do is you go out and you get,
um,

581
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.420
you know,
those little,
I think I've talked about this before,

582
00:36:03.421 --> 00:36:07.230
you know those things,
those overly protective parents get in the playroom,

583
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:12.120
those interlocking like little rubber,
a spongy floor thing.

584
00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.730
So if a kid falls down,
he doesn't hurt himself.

585
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:19.620
You just get those and you get two layers of it and you put it underneath the

586
00:36:19.621 --> 00:36:23.040
kit and then you go downstairs.
Do you downstairs neighbor and you say,
Hey,

587
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:26.970
my name's so-and-so.
This is my phone number.
All right,

588
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.210
if I'm ever playing in,
in your at home,

589
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.250
call me up and I will stop immediately.
Anybody has a problem with that?

590
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:38.730
There are a cunt and then he should play at two in the morning.
All right,

591
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.190
there you go.
So that's what's going on in my life.

592
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.430
Let me read the last of the advertising here and we'll get into your questions

593
00:36:44.431 --> 00:36:47.130
there.
Oh,

We do it at the bootleg theater tomorrow night.

There's not a better fucking show in Los Angeles tomorrow night.

A legal zoom.

636
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.850
Everyone America was built by innovators and dreamers.

637
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.960
Jesus.
That's a rosy picture.
Innovators,

638
00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:45.790
dreamers and homicidal maniacs.
Uh,
people like Thomas Edison,

639
00:39:45.791 --> 00:39:49.210
all I want a swell guy.
He was and then re Ford.
Oh yeah.

640
00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:53.170
That anti-semite laid the foundations for our country.
I don't know if he was,

641
00:39:53.171 --> 00:39:57.170
I don't know if how confusing Henry Ford,
Walt Disney,
uh,
these days,
it's the,

642
00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.780
if you know what,
that's not even their fault.

643
00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.820
It's just because of when they were born that was acceptable.

You never give up ownership.

652
00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:37.450

Okay,

Um,
what does this say?

679
00:42:10.971 --> 00:42:14.960
Good meal.
But email is also mentioned the Monday morning podcast or yeah,

680

our Twitter handle is at the MMP,

684
00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:35.980
a podcast at the MM podcasts and MMP is all capitalized.

685
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.660
All right.
Okay,
here we go.
First one Bruins.
Bill.

686
00:42:41.661 --> 00:42:46.490
Why didn't the Bruins just take out Kerry price range have figured this out in

687
00:42:46.491 --> 00:42:51.160
game one.
Um,
ah,
come on man.
You don't want to do that shit,
you know,

688
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:53.250
deliberately hurt somebody.
Um,

689
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.160
but I will say that I don't think Kerry price is quite as good as people say is

690
00:42:58.161 --> 00:43:01.730
if you go up top,
you got the guy.
Unless you miss it every fucking time.

691
00:43:01.731 --> 00:43:04.310
The way we did,
we really,
uh,

692
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:07.700
we really screwed the fucking pooch.
But um,

693
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:10.490
I definitely think he's one of the elite goalies in the league,
but I wouldn't,

694
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:14.090
I think I'd say the king's my quickest,
the best.

695
00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.630
Is it Mike Quick on my,
is that the fucking guy from the eagles?

696
00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.710
I'm so fucking old.
I just combined generations of people.

697
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.170
I got to look this up now out.

698
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:29.960
Jonathan quick.
Mike quick.
Yeah.
My quick play for the eagles.

699
00:43:29.961 --> 00:43:32.000
I knew that didn't sound right.
I've watched people,

700
00:43:32.001 --> 00:43:36.170
I've watched all three fucking games and they've said Johnathan quick a zillion

701
00:43:36.171 --> 00:43:38.030
times and I still sit my quick,

702
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:42.980
I might fucking brain stop retaining information somewhere around the late

703
00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.830
eighties,
early nineties.
My apologies that Johnathan quick.

704
00:43:45.831 --> 00:43:48.610
I think he's the best I'll tell you,

705
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:52.710
I don't think is his fucking good as his numb is,
numbers is a,

706
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.170
the Blackhawks Crawford.

707
00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.920
I just think he has an incredible group of people in front of them and uh,

708
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:04.610
he plays with the lead a lot so people can get back on deep.
But I've noticed,

709
00:44:04.611 --> 00:44:07.670
you know,
all of a sudden they start chasing it a little bit.

710
00:44:07.671 --> 00:44:09.170
They got to take the chances.

711
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:13.330
I'll tell you that five holes looking pretty tasty.
The,

712
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:18.020
I'm sorry.
Anyways,
whatever.
Uh,

713
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:21.590
I gotta be honest with you.
If we took out Kerry price,
I mean,

714
00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:23.090
I don't think it would've made a difference to Canadians.

715
00:44:23.091 --> 00:44:25.640
They were just better than us and they're moving in the right direction and I

716
00:44:25.641 --> 00:44:30.110
hope that we do so.
Uh,
there you go.
All right.
All right.
Dilemma.

717
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.270
The dilemma here for the week.
Bill,

718
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.450
I haven't heard you read a dilemma in a while.
Here's one.

719
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:41.570
Would you rather fight three rabid dogs with the thirst for blood with a sword?

720
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.390
Oh yeah.
I can fucking take them out

721
00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:52.480
or take your chances with one bullet and a bear coming at you from 100 yards

722
00:44:53.001 --> 00:44:53.331
away.

723
00:44:53.331 --> 00:44:58.310
Keep in mind the dogs can kill you and that it can take more than one bullet to

724
00:44:58.311 --> 00:45:00.890
kill a bear.
Absolute fucking lutely.
I know that.
Hey,

725
00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:05.600
I don't know that I've just watched enough youtube videos.
Um,
I saw,

726
00:45:05.601 --> 00:45:10.601
I actually saw youtube videos wanting once you one of those fail when videos and

727
00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:14.480
why do they always have to put a picture of some hot chick bending over and then

728
00:45:14.481 --> 00:45:17.870
she's never in it.
It's like,
I'm going to watch it anyways.

729
00:45:17.871 --> 00:45:22.871
What are you getting my hopes up for watching people fail and succeed is

730
00:45:23.211 --> 00:45:25.160
compelling.
It's compelling enough.

731
00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:28.280
You don't have to put some chick with the fucking,
you know,

732
00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.840
the Kini covered clamp fucking winking at me in the beginning of it,

733
00:45:32.841 --> 00:45:35.790
and then it's not there.
It's false advertising.
You cuts.

734
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:38.870
You know what I'm doing is I'm starting to just click on the ones that don't

735
00:45:38.871 --> 00:45:42.860
have that
fucking pussies stand on.

736
00:45:42.861 --> 00:45:47.240
The merit of the footage is stole.
But anyways,

737
00:45:47.241 --> 00:45:52.190
I was watching one of those fail when videos and uh,
to see this guy,

738
00:45:52.191 --> 00:45:56.750
he was hunting wild boar and he fucking shoots at the thing.

739
00:45:56.751 --> 00:46:00.530
He misses in the fucking thing,
turns around and just starts running at him.

740
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:03.980
He misses again and then he fucking ran away.

741
00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:12.230
Dude,
you just got your best.
What are you going to outrun?
A fucking wild boar.

742
00:46:12.231 --> 00:46:16.820
You're nuts.
Well,
she had trucks right there.
I'm telling you,

743
00:46:16.821 --> 00:46:18.710
you got to just stand there.

744
00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:23.990
If I had to shoot a fucking bear in the head,

745
00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:26.450
you got to shoot him in the fucking head.

746
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:29.780
You got to wait to the absolute last second.

747
00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:34.010
I'm talking about urinating down both sides of your pant leg.

748
00:46:34.011 --> 00:46:36.220
Just standing there like,
ah,

749
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:41.290
and just waiting so you can almost feel his breath and you better have a fucking

750
00:46:41.451 --> 00:46:46.160
50 caliber and you just fire that fucker.
Um,

751
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:52.550
hundred yards away.
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

752
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:55.100
Oh my God.
And you know,
you can fill the earth shaking.

753
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:58.040
Is that things coming at you?
I mean,
I'm just telling you,
you're,

754
00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:03.830
that's just come.
All organs fail at that point.
Uh,

755
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:08.800
fuck that.
US rabid dogs.

756
00:47:08.801 --> 00:47:11.080
Fuck yeah,
absolutely.
With the sword.

757
00:47:11.081 --> 00:47:15.460
The great thing about a sword is that gives me a little bit of distance.

758
00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:17.443
All right,

759
00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:22.690
how do I meet these rabid dogs and my lowered into a pit?

760
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:24.910
Is this CME?
Are they running at me?

761
00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:31.330
Fall three are running at me.
I there and right as they say,

762
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.100
the first one starts to leap.

763
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:37.290
I do a little sidestep little sachet,

764
00:47:37.291 --> 00:47:41.980
a few will and I fucking just come right down.
Um,
whatever,

765
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:45.820
whatever meat I can hit.
And at that,

766
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:49.030
what I'm gonna do is I'm actually going to alligator arm it because the last

767
00:47:49.031 --> 00:47:53.730
thing I want to have happen is for that sword to get stuck and that things flesh

768
00:47:53.731 --> 00:47:56.230
as the other to take.
Take it.
Oh,
I'm really getting into this.

769
00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:59.410
I'd fucking give him a nice fucking right there,
Fred.

770
00:47:59.411 --> 00:48:04.411
Right little chop to him sent him to the side than the other fuckers.

771
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.620
Even if one of them's bite me,
my move is I'm hacking you leg.

772
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:13.770
I'm hacking you fucking done.
And the people right now like,
oh my God,
I love dog.

773
00:48:13.771 --> 00:48:16.450
Shut up.
It's hypothetical and they're rabid.

774
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:21.100
They gotta be put down anyways and they're trying to kill me.
Oh,
Billy red face.

775
00:48:21.101 --> 00:48:25.780
Who the woo fuck side you on here.
So that,
that would be my big move.

776
00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.450
That would be my,
my big move.

777
00:48:28.451 --> 00:48:32.350
Like I've always thought if I was ever hiking in somebody's eye,

778
00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:36.260
I came upon somebody getting mauled by a,

779
00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:39.670
a a mountain lion.
If ever I was actually,
I mean,

780
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.970
I mean I know what I would do in real life.
I'd be like,
well sucks for him.

781
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:46.720
Didn't see that.
Sorry.
What am I supposed to do?

782
00:48:46.721 --> 00:48:50.580
Getting mauled too so I can get on the news.
Fuck that.
Um,

783
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:54.210
but if for some reason it was somebody I gave a shit about and they were going

784
00:48:54.211 --> 00:48:55.990
to die,
I would,

785
00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.910
I would run like a native American Ppp,

786
00:48:59.911 --> 00:49:04.911
PPP really fucking softly and I would leap in the air and I would fucking Matt

787
00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:09.190
Cook that Mountain Lion,
one of his back legs.

788
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:13.390
I would just fucking land on its leg and try to blow out,
you know,

789
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:14.343
and it's,

790
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:19.690
and it's lateral fucking movement and it would just fucking,
you know,

791
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:24.670
the great thing about wild animals or anything about animals in general is they

792
00:49:24.671 --> 00:49:29.170
don't have a fucking ego.
Okay.
So they just kinda like,
you know,

793
00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.810
when something like that happens,
they're just like,
okay,

794
00:49:31.811 --> 00:49:34.570
I need to go lay down and heal even though that's not going to fucking heel.

795
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.430
That's uh,
that's,
I dunno.
So whatever,
that's,

796
00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:39.250
that's how I would take the three dogs.

797
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:43.660
I would give a nice jab with the sword to the first one that came to me.

798
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:47.230
I take the bite of the second one,
I'd hack the leg of the third one,

799
00:49:47.231 --> 00:49:50.800
and then I fucking start finishing them off.
That's what I would do.

800
00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:53.170
And then I would go to the hospital,
uh,

801
00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:56.950
with all three carcasses and I would say,
yeah,

802
00:49:56.951 --> 00:50:01.720
I got bit by two out of three of these.
They're all fucking rabid.
And,
uh,

803
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:04.000
go ahead,
stick those needles in my stomach.

804
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.920
Let's get it over with and chain me to the radiator.

805
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:10.840
Let's see if Ocho mad or something,
you know?
Shit.

806
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:15.280
All right.
I liked the dilemmas.
Let's bring the dilemmas back.

807
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.220
I also liked youtube videos of the week.
I was a lot of,

808
00:50:18.221 --> 00:50:21.250
there was a lot of fucking things out there.
Ah,
I remember.

809
00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:25.060
Back then we used to have topics.
All right.
Corporate bullies,

810
00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.820
they're built.
I used to be a bully.
Not a terrible one,

811
00:50:28.821 --> 00:50:30.800
but the harmless Eddie Haskell type.

812
00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.553
<v 5>MMM.</v>

813
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.230
<v 0>All right.
See you more.
Just,
you would just like a,
just an asshole.
All right.</v>

814
00:50:37.231 --> 00:50:40.470
Harmless as I may have been.
I'm sure I heard some feelings.

815
00:50:40.471 --> 00:50:43.710
It made some experiences less fun for those at the other end.

816
00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:48.030
My question to you is,
how can I make this right?
Um,

817
00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.550
I know I can't trace down the kids I grew up with,

818
00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:54.630
but I see people being dicks and corporate America and want to call them out

819
00:50:54.631 --> 00:50:55.920
without losing my job.

820
00:50:56.130 --> 00:51:00.630
Do I tease them in the same style we did as children or take a serious route and

821
00:51:00.631 --> 00:51:04.350
give it Denzel speech or at first of all,
why can't you track,

822
00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:08.670
track down the kids you grew up with?
It happens all the time on Facebook,

823
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.700
of which you can find a lot of them.
You can go to a high school reunion.

824
00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:13.353
<v 5>MMM.</v>

825
00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:15.630
<v 0>You could do it that way.</v>

826
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.440
I think that would be a great thing to make you feel better and say,
Hey,

827
00:51:19.441 --> 00:51:22.010
I'm an adult now.
I shouldn't have done that.
Sorry that I,
uh,

828
00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:27.570
I dumped your books and gave you a fucking Wedgie.
Whatever the fuck you did.
Um,

829
00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:32.980
I don't know how that works in corporate America.

830
00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:37.070
I wouldn't give a Denzel speech,
uh,

831
00:51:37.071 --> 00:51:40.350
that those speeches only work in the movies.
Um,

832
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:43.970
do I tease them in the same style we did his children?
Well,
you know what,

833
00:51:43.971 --> 00:51:47.730
you need to elaborate.
They're bullying people.

834
00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:52.880
Um,
I don't know.
You know,
in the job place,

835
00:51:52.881 --> 00:51:56.270
if somebody is getting bullied,
that's really just on them,

836
00:51:57.590 --> 00:51:58.150
you know,
and the,

837
00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:01.760
and just the amount of shit that they've decided that they want to take in life.

838
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:05.990
You know,
it'd be one thing,
you know,
if someone was like,
you know,

839
00:52:05.991 --> 00:52:09.010
putting his secretary and I and a headlock and was given her nuggies.

840
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:10.543
You know what I mean?

841
00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:16.100
There was a bunch of fucking former athletes beaten on some form of Mathlete,

842
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:20.840
you know,
hanging outside his cubicle,
Wayne from to go over to the water bubbler,

843
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:24.260
they push him in a broom closet and fucking rough him up.
Yeah.

844
00:52:24.261 --> 00:52:27.020
Then you got to do some.
But if it's just like mental torture,

845
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:28.533
<v 5>mmm.</v>

846
00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:33.050
<v 0>What I would do is I would walk up to the person getting bullied when he get a</v>

847
00:52:33.051 --> 00:52:35.180
chance and just say,
listen man,
you've got to stick up for yourself.

848
00:52:35.181 --> 00:52:39.890
Stop taking that shit.
What's the Guy gonna do?
Throw his cuff links at you.

849
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.150
What are you afraid of?
Fuck him.

850
00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:43.143
<v 5>MMM.</v>

851
00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:47.040
<v 0>But I know in the work environment you can't say,
Hey,
fuck you.</v>

852
00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:50.790
You have to come more.
You have to sit down.
Just say,

853
00:52:50.791 --> 00:52:51.930
can I talk to you for a second?

854
00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.290
And then they'll listen to you and then you gotta be like,
man,
listen,

855
00:52:55.291 --> 00:53:00.260
I just noticed you've been a,
you know,
coming at me in a manner that,

856
00:53:00.261 --> 00:53:03.650
that sort of indicates to me that you're not pleased with something about me.

857
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:05.510
And I was just wondering what that was,

858
00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:11.710
you know?
And just leave it at that and see what that is.
And then,
you know,

859
00:53:11.711 --> 00:53:15.310
if they want to sit there and try and make your life miserable at that point.

860
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:18.690
Um,
I,

861
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:22.160
cause I know there's all that passive aggressive horse shit that goes on in an

862
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:26.910
office.
Um,
but I have not,

863
00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:31.020
fortunately never worked in that arena.
Tell you what,
you know what?

864
00:53:31.021 --> 00:53:33.260
I need a little help on this one.
Everybody.
Um,

865
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.690
can you guys write in some that really corporate bullies things?

866
00:53:36.691 --> 00:53:41.691
Can you write in a some passive aggressive shit that's been happening like they

867
00:53:42.241 --> 00:53:44.700
do,
they want you to quit so they keep doing stuff to you.

868
00:53:44.701 --> 00:53:47.010
You guys got any stories out there?
I think those are interesting.

869
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:51.790
I think those would help me fill up a fucking hour here on the blog.
All right,

870
00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:56.800
so yeah,
I would go to a high school union.
I go to eyes grew union.

871
00:53:56.801 --> 00:53:59.080
I think it'd be weird to reach out to somebody on Facebook,
hey,

872
00:53:59.081 --> 00:54:03.550
sorry for being a dick.
Go to a high school reunion,
say to their face,
you know,

873
00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:06.520
I would do that.
I wouldn't reach out on Facebook.
Facebook is,

874
00:54:06.521 --> 00:54:11.340
this should just fucking a weird,
um,
anyways.
All right,
kid,
kid movies.

875
00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:15.390
Uh,
dear Billy,
the kid lists.

876
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:23.780
Oh,
just when you think there's not an original one left.

877
00:54:23.781 --> 00:54:27.140
That's a fucking great one.
He said,
I'm a father of two little girls.

878
00:54:27.141 --> 00:54:30.110
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Um,

879
00:54:30.111 --> 00:54:33.950
all my free time is spent with them and there's a lot of kids programming is

880
00:54:33.951 --> 00:54:37.340
happening in my life.
I was wondering the other day,

881
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:40.820
does bill like any kid movies,
classics,

882
00:54:40.821 --> 00:54:44.090
like the Goonies or Disney animation?
Don't worry.

883
00:54:44.091 --> 00:54:47.780
Even if you don't like any now you will enjoy them when your own child is

884
00:54:47.781 --> 00:54:51.680
getting all giggly and bubbly over the site of a little mermaid.

885
00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.440
Um,
of course I do.
I mean,

886
00:54:54.441 --> 00:54:57.560
I didn't the Goonies and was too old when that came out.

887
00:54:57.561 --> 00:55:00.640
I was already a teenager,
so I was watching more quality cinema,

888
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:04.250
like young blood and a roadhouse.
Um,

889
00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:05.880
<v 5>okay.</v>

890
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:09.030
<v 0>Let me see here.
What do I,
oh yeah,
like all the Disney stuff.</v>

891
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.040
<v 5>MMM.</v>

892
00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:16.040
<v 0>I never liked Mickey mouse's voice,
so I liked goofy.
I liked Pluto.</v>

893
00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:20.420
Donald Duck was fucking hilarious.
Why do they always make the duck be the Dick,

894
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:24.620
you know?
Did Warner Brothers rip off Donald Duck with Daffy Duck?

895
00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:30.350
I hate and I hated daffy duck by the way.
I couldn't stand that fucking dude.

896
00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.400
And after a while I didn't like bugs bunny either.
Bugs bunny always one.

897
00:55:34.401 --> 00:55:38.300
So he was fucking annoying and Daffy duck was just kind of this piece of Shit,

898
00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:40.123
you know?

899
00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:40.993
<v 5>Okay.</v>

900
00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:44.610
<v 0>Hst,
you know,
he just would do shit the fuck up cell phone.</v>

901
00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.050
You're not flying south for the winter and now I'm supposed to feel bad for you.

902
00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:53.610
You did up.
I gotta give you another bath.
What's wrong with you?

903
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.380
Do you need a flea treatment?
They have clean audio.

904
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.863
<v 5>Huh?</v>

905
00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:04.410
<v 0>You know what's funny about her when she's anticipating me either saying if she</v>

906
00:56:04.781 --> 00:56:08.110
wants to know she's already,
I can't even say one,

907
00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:15.060
go to a plate basically outside or go for a ride.

908
00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:21.500
Her ears.
She's staring at me right now.
Park up.
They,

909
00:56:21.501 --> 00:56:25.510
she looks like bat ears or her eyes.
She just locks in on me.

910
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:27.040
The psycho pit bull look,

911
00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:31.510
ears come up and she just stares at me with all census.

912
00:56:31.511 --> 00:56:33.440
Like did he just say what I said?

913
00:56:33.441 --> 00:56:37.570
I thought he said I would actually get a riled up.
But it's a main thing to do.

914
00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.200
You want me to do it?
Fine.
I'll do it.
You want to hear her?

915
00:56:41.201 --> 00:56:44.110
How she does this every once in a while,
cleo.

916
00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

917
00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.840
<v 0>Cleo,

918
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:51.573
<v 2>Huh?</v>

919

We'll go on a second.
Go lay down.
Go lay down.

923
00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:14.580
Sorry.
Got You all excited.
You know what I just did?

924
00:57:14.581 --> 00:57:18.000
I just did like knows fail when videos.
I put the hot chick in the beginning,

925
00:57:18.001 --> 00:57:22.980
didn't I?
I'm sorry buddy.
Go girl will go in a minute.

926
00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:28.200
Um,
whew.
Okay.
Um,
yeah,
I like,
um,

927
00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:32.910
I didn't like the Little Mermaid.
I'm not into fish.
Women.

928
00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:35.280
It's just fucking weird.
And then there's always some sort of like,

929
00:57:35.281 --> 00:57:39.450
the guy ends up fucking,
the fish woman has this.
It's fucking creepy.
Like splash,

930
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:44.940
you know?
I mean,
this is really crude,
but you just always think,
you know,

931
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:49.440
you just think the downstairs is going to be a little ripe,

932
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:50.303
if you know what I mean.

933
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:57.050
How do you tell?
Do you look in her eye for eyes?
Cloudy.
You don't go down there.

934
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:59.900
Oh Jesus.
That's a fish joke everybody.

935
00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:04.370
Now that's how you pick out fresh fish.
Hey,
you know what?

936
00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:09.140
I actually looked up this recipe.
This is my favorite thing on youtube.

937
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:14.630
It's for garlic,
garlic,
mashed potatoes.
And this is how the guy,

938
00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:19.550
the way the guy ends,
this video is so fucking priceless.
Um,

939
00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:21.010
<v 2>yeah.</v>

940
00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:22.720
<v 0>Let me see if I can bring this up.
This has been,</v>

941
00:58:22.721 --> 00:58:26.920
this is the youtube video of the week.
Ah,
Jesus with the advertising.

942
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:30.360
Don't they know everybody hits fucking mute and then scrolls down and you just

943
00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:35.260
look at the yellow bar.
That's what I do.
Eight more seconds.

944
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:39.040
Six more seconds.
Three,
two,

945
00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.290

All right,

946
00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:45.610
so basically this guy make potatoes are delicious side.

947
00:58:45.611 --> 00:58:49.870
There's the parallel with the meats.
Poultry.
I just want you to hear this.

948
00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.710
Well,

Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
All right,
here we go.

949
00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:58.870
So he basically just said,
shut up to a video.

950
00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:00.550
That's how dumb I am.
Um,

951
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:04.630
he basically makes these garlic mashed potatoes.
He known the end.

952
00:59:04.631 --> 00:59:07.780
Then they got to try it and tell you how fucking delicious it is.

953
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:09.190
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

954
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:12.160
<v 0>this is it,

957
00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:31.140
<v 0>such fucking guy.
You could not get mad at that guy.</v>

958
00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:35.760
I played that for Nia right before we went to bed last night and she fought.

959
00:59:35.761 --> 00:59:40.740
She almost fell out of the bed laughing.
He goes,
thanks for Youtube.
And he goes,

960
00:59:40.741 --> 00:59:43.650
that's garlic mashed potatoes.
Thanks for Youtube and see next time.

961
00:59:43.651 --> 00:59:47.880
And then he puts the garlic mashed potatoes,
his mouth.
He just goes,
yeah,

962
00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:48.733
it's good.

963
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:54.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

964
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:55.440
<v 0>Uh,
you know what,</v>

965
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:58.590
in his videos will get better because I've actually seen outtakes where he's

966
00:59:58.591 --> 01:00:01.650
actually more relaxed,
more like who he is.
He's just been doing them.

967
01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.650
I don't know what's this from a few years ago or whatever.

968
01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.670
I always believe that people are going to get better.
All right,
so here we go.

969
01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:13.500
Why have we got one more read here?
All right,
first time dear Billy,
go lucky.

970
01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:18.540
I'm going to lose my V card next weekend.
Jesus Christ.

971
01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:19.531
I always,

972
01:00:19.531 --> 01:00:21.990
that always surprises me when people know when they're going to lose their

973
01:00:21.991 --> 01:00:26.610
virginity.
Doesn't just happen like it did for me.
You know,

974
01:00:26.611 --> 01:00:27.870
like it's never going to happen.

975
01:00:27.871 --> 01:00:32.340
And then somebody just grabbed your Dick and you allow shit.
Here we go.
Whoo.

976
01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:33.990
And you drive it home.

977
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:41.410
I didn't know people planned it.
Right?
I'm like,

978
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:43.140
I just said somebody just grabbed your Dick.

979
01:00:43.141 --> 01:00:46.890
Like it could be anybody from like some fucking 60 year old man.
Gross.

980
01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:50.460
Um,
what was I going to say?

981
01:00:50.490 --> 01:00:52.530
Like you guys actually plan this shit out.

982
01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:57.750
It's going down next Sunday.
I'm going to lose my V card next weekend.

983
01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:02.910
Me and the girl are corny.
High School love birds and it couldn't be more right.

984
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:06.600
I think I know the answer to this question,
but I'll ask you anyways.

985
01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.970
Should I pull it in her face now?
Now,

986
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:16.890
should I blow it in her face to commemorate the occasion?
Then he says,
kidding.

987
01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.150
Real question.

988
01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:23.730
Should I think about mixing up positions or just keep it ida?
I love making,

989
01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:28.710
um,
yeah,
I,
uh,
I gotta be honest with you.
I,
I never,

990
01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:33.750
I never hooked up with the Virgin.
Okay.
The woman,
it was a woman,

991
01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:38.370
she was a hormone that and,
and she had been around the block.

992
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:43.260
All right,
so there was no,
uh,

993
01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:46.770
yeah,
I don't know.
I didn't have that experience.

994
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:50.070
I would probably say the first time you do it,

995
01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:54.420
you don't want to flip her over.
Um,
yeah,

996
01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.940
this is a big responsibility.

997
01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:01.560
I would try to keep it as loving and as Nice as you can.

998
01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.570
And,
uh,

999
01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:08.600
I would probably do that the first half dozen to a dozen times and then,

1000
01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:13.360
you know,
you know,
let it get comfortable there buddy,

1001
01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.070
before you start fucking trying to,

1002
01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:18.790
you know what it is about your kids is the amount of porn you've probably

1003
01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:23.730
watched the access that you have to it.
You know,
I wonder if,

1004
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.300
if,
if kids,
I,
that's a fucking creepy thought.
Sorry.

1005
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:32.250
Strike that when,
if I shouldn't even say kids.
Teenagers of age.

1006
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.150
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1007
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:37.900
<v 0>I mean they gotta be better at it than we were.
We had no idea.</v>

1008
01:02:37.901 --> 01:02:39.850
All you had was rumors when I was a kid.

1009
01:02:39.851 --> 01:02:41.410
You didn't know what the fuck you were doing.

1010
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:45.340
You had to figure it out because you just walked into the bush.

1011
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:47.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1012
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.900
<v 0>No fucking trail.
No nothing.</v>

1013
01:02:48.901 --> 01:02:51.510
You guys are while you guys are walking right down the open highway.

1014
01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1015
01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.870
<v 0>Just to do something.
I didn't even</v>

1016
01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:03.010
the thought of blown it and in some woman's face like I didn't even,

1017
01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:09.170
you didn't even think Google even thought I shit like that.

1018
01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:11.893
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1019
01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.370
<v 0>I'm,
I'm trying to think when the facial came arrived there,</v>

1020
01:03:14.371 --> 01:03:18.090
when I was in high school,
like the two pornos I think I ever saw.

1021
01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:19.290
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1022
01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:23.190
<v 0>The big thing was when the VCR came out and then all of a sudden,
you know,</v>

1023
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.480
and then it was somebody who had to have the balls to go into,

1024
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.800
do those fucking saloon doors at the back of the video shop.

1025
01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:32.520
And you just fucking went in there.
Huh?
He just grab one really quick.

1026
01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:37.350
What'd you get?
I don't know.
It had tents and then you fucking went out like,

1027
01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:38.310
<v 2>okay,</v>

1028
01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:43.050
<v 0>nobody did that.
Right?
Nobody fucking down.</v>

1029
01:03:43.051 --> 01:03:45.570
I'm trying to think.
The first time I even saw that first time I saw it,

1030
01:03:45.571 --> 01:03:48.560
I thought it was fucking gross.
Like a lot of porn.
You're like,
oh my God,

1031
01:03:48.561 --> 01:03:50.330
that's disgusting.
And then you're like,
oh my God,

1032
01:03:50.331 --> 01:03:52.730
that's the only thing that gets me off.
Then you move to the next level,

1033
01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:54.950
which is the danger report.
Right?

1034
01:03:54.951 --> 01:03:57.480
You just keep going further and further down the fucking a,

1035
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:58.611
and next thing you know,

1036
01:03:58.611 --> 01:04:01.280
you could work on a vice squad without getting sick while you're eating a

1037
01:04:01.281 --> 01:04:05.060
fucking man.
A sandwich over there.
Sorry,
this is getting gross.
But it's true.

1038
01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:13.650
And if elected no child under the age of 18,

1039
01:04:13.671 --> 01:04:17.470
you will be allowed to watch somebody bust it in somebody's face.

1040
01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:24.340
Ask Not who's face.
You can bust it.
Ed.
Um,
yeah.

1041
01:04:24.341 --> 01:04:28.660
Wow.
Jesus.
I mean,
even like your question,
like how fucking uh,

1042
01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:33.160
advanced you already are if you never fucking did anything.
Cause when I,

1043
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:37.780
like I said,
there was no video.
We had no game film when I was a kid.
Did,

1044
01:04:37.781 --> 01:04:41.010
you guys can sit there and go over and over and over like fucking bill Belicheck

1045
01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:43.150
we had no,
there was no game film.

1046
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:47.740
And then because there was so little information you had to act like you knew

1047
01:04:47.741 --> 01:04:52.270
everything and several would bring something up and you,

1048
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:54.430
and you'd be sitting there on the outside,

1049
01:04:54.431 --> 01:04:56.890
just total fucking world series of poker face.

1050
01:04:57.070 --> 01:05:00.490
And on the inside you're panicking going,
what the fuck are they talking about?

1051
01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:03.340
What is that?
I don't know what that is.
You know,

1052
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.660
and I don't know if my dad knows what it is,

1053
01:05:07.661 --> 01:05:12.130
but I'm certainly not talking about it up to him because that's fucking gross.

1054
01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.760
Just talking to him about it would be fucking gross in,
in a whole other levels.

1055
01:05:15.761 --> 01:05:19.690
He doing that to my mom.
I have fucked.
Does he know that?
Right?
So

1056
01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:24.480
I dunno.
So like I said,
just keep it,
I love making,
I would leave it at that.

1057
01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.020
All right.
And with that,
everybody,

1058
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.640
that is the Monday morning podcast here for Memorial Day.
All right,

1059
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:35.270
thank you to all the troops.
Anybody who's ever served,
uh,

1060
01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:38.560
for giving me the wonderful life that I have,
protecting my life and on,

1061
01:05:38.561 --> 01:05:41.210
and it means a lot more to me now that I actually,
you know,

1062
01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:44.890
got that chance to go over there to Omaha beach and everything added a whole

1063
01:05:44.891 --> 01:05:49.810
nother level of reality to it.
So,
uh,
that is it.
So thank you to all the troops.

1064
01:05:49.811 --> 01:05:52.480
