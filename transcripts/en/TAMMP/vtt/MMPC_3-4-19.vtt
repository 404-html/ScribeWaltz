1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
On,
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:07.101
It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.060
uh,
match fourth,

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.890
2000 [inaudible] 19.
What's going on?

5
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.500
Yeah,
I know I'm really late.
I'm really late.

6
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:20.380
But yesterday was the first taping my next special,
uh,

7
00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:22.770
at Royal Albert Hall and tonight is the next one.

8
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:26.310
So yesterday I had a bunch of stuff I had to do,

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.690
uh,
for like the intro of the special in all of that type of stuff.

10
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:32.580
So it went great last night,

11
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.680
had an awesome time and I never take the special world.

12
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.180
I always just did like two shows one night done.

13
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.470
I've never done like a show and then waited a whole day and then do another
show.

14
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:44.760
So,
uh,

15
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:48.600
I'm just looking tonight like I could not have been more thrilled with how it

16
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:50.340
went last night.
Um,

17
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.920
did not have any of this stupid torture that happens afterwards where you're

18
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:59.970
just like,
Oh God,
I,
why did I do this?
And I that I didn't say that.

19
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.750
Is anybody going to like me after this?
I didn't do any of that shit.

20
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.420
I was just like,
all right,
I miss something here,
Miss,
who gives a fuck,
right?

21
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.050
Yeah,
it's fine.
I don't give a shit.
It's all gonna be good.
So,
um,

22
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.880
tonight I'm just going to go out and have a good time and I'm as excited as I

23
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:18.540
was to record this special eye.
After last night,

24
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:20.640
I kind of felt a little bit of sadness of like,

25
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:25.170
I'm really gonna miss these jokes.
I've never had that feeling before.

26
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.620
Um,
but I know the next ones that come in or whatever,

27
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.280
but it's kind of hitting me here is I'm doing this like,
wow,

28
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:35.190
this is kind of the end of the run for these jokes,
you know,

29
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.940
and then I just move on like bill Bixby right at the end of the hulk.

30
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.810
Just walk away from the act.
Um,

31
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.490
and the smartest thing I did was I already did a Gig at,
um,
Royal Albert Hall.

32
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.070
Uh,
ah,
for fuck's sake.
Somebody else just come,
hang on,
hang on,

33
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:57.150
hang on,
hang on.
Sorry.
Hit hit.
Pause.

34
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.340
Fucking rang the doorbell and then rings it again.

35
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.330
Like the fucking hotel's on fire.
Oh,
sorry to disturb you.

36
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:06.060
Just want to know if you need anything in the minibar.
No,
I'm,
I'm good.
Thank you.

37
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.900
Geez.

38
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.940
We assuming I'm not fucking here to fucking rings would if I was sitting here

39
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:13.530
with my fucking balls hanging out.

40
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:16.050
You're going to ring it that fast and then you walk in and then let me guess I'm

41
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:20.430
in trouble.
Right?
Is it true you had your balls out,
sir?
Well,
yes,

42
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:25.350
I was in that shot up.
There was a woman knocking on that door.

43
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:28.970
You should have realized that any second someone could come walk again.

44
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.630
Um,
by the way,

45
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:37.290
is that John Wayne stuff the dumbest thing.

46
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.080
What is this thing now where we're just going to dig up dead people?
It did.

47
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.080
Did you see what they said in 1964?
Well,
I have,

48
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:47.760
I imagine nothing good.

49
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.170
They fucking got this documentary coming out about Michael Jackson.

50
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.500
It's just like the guy's dead.
Like,

51
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.060
I don't understand.
Like,

52
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:05.050
what the fuck would they every other day now somebody dead.

53
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:09.080
Somebody got to come along and fucking dig them up and be,
hey,
you know,
they,

54
00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:09.914
they,
you know,

55
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.360
I don't know how much you enjoy this music if you know that the person did this.

56
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.780
<v 1>Okay,</v>

57
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.940
<v 0>why did they only do it to famous people?</v>

58
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.740
Can all of us dig up our grandparents and be like,
Eh,

59
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.200
remember when you said that

60
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.730
all of these fucking it,
I just don't,
I do not fucking get it.

61
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.210
I don't fucking get it.
Can you believe this?

62
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.220
This fucking guy who was born in 1907 sounded like a guy who was born in 1907

63
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:49.900
yes.
Yes.
I kid whose grandparents don't go out and say crazy shit.

64
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

65
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.200
<v 0>That's the newest bucket thing on earth,
on earth.</v>

66
00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:59.201
A buck and interview from 40 50 years ago and then line it up with today's,

67
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.530
you know what's right?
And you don't have to go back that far.

68
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.810
Go back into somebody's Twitter history member when you said this.
Yeah,
no,
no.

69
00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:12.720
Remember when we were all saying that that's what you supposed to be.
Oh,

70
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.390
you know what,
you mother fucking cock sucking fucking assholes.
What now?

71
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.580
Just going to,
I just want to go to the CDC fucking Bull Shit.
Hello.

72
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.943
You have what?

73
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.390
Miss who?
I don't know who that is.

74
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.213
<v 1>Bye.</v>

75
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.460
<v 0>I have Miss Simmie Ms Kimmy,
I don't give a fuck.
That is.</v>

76
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.463
<v 1>MMM.</v>

77
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.810
<v 0>Anyways,
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
That's like the new fucking thing.</v>

78
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.970
The new fucking thing is to go back at time and just look up.
Hey,
Yay.

79
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.600
Quite evidently Truman Capote's he was,
uh,
he needs,
but again,
two minutes.

80
00:05:05.601 --> 00:05:06.620
We thought he was

81
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.590
just think about someone they just put for all the fucking jokes.

82
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.770
I literally saw somebody get interviewed the other day and they were talking

83
00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:21.240
about the office,
the American version.
And they asked,

84
00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:24.790
could you make that today and the Oh no,
no,
we,
we can never do that.
We,

85
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:28.950
cause most of those jokes wouldn't work today.
That was 10 fucking years ago.

86
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.830
<v 0>All right.
So Jesus Christ,
enough with,
with the fucking shock and awe,</v>

88
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.871
that shit.

89
00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:39.430
You're going to dig up somebody who died 40 fucking years ago and they said

90
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:40.540
something surprising.

91
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.673
<v 1>MMM.</v>

92
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.650
<v 0>It's like if you were born in 1907 and somebody interviewed you 40 years ago,</v>

93
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.790
you,
you would not want that interview to be made fucking public.
You wouldn't,

94
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.230
um,
anyways,
what fucking world that we live in that the,

95
00:05:56.231 --> 00:06:00.560
the office now considered too edgy for television.
Oh,
James is,

96
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:01.151
you could never do,

97
00:06:01.151 --> 00:06:03.770
it wasn't the most absurd fucking shows you have to sign your life.

98
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.833
<v 1>MMM.</v>

99
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.060
<v 0>I Dunno,
but that's where we are because,
well,</v>

100
00:06:09.061 --> 00:06:11.400
that's where we are because 8% of the fucking best,

101
00:06:11.401 --> 00:06:14.400
my rough as far as I can tell the people that I talked to,

102
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.970
everybody else is just like,
dude,
what is the big fucking deal?

103
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.290
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

104
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.310
<v 0>You know,
it's fucking hilarious.</v>

105
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.950
Someday you're going to sound like you're fucking grandparents.

106
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.410
Someday you're going to be in your fucking seventies.

107
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.100
And something you said in your forties is going to sound fucking ridiculous.

108
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.400
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.040
<v 0>Like nobody's like,
it's nobody's allowed to like I don't,
I don't know.</v>

110
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.130
I don't even,
I don't even fucking,

111
00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:41.370
and I don't understand all of these fucking people that are going on social

112
00:06:41.371 --> 00:06:43.830
media doing this.
It's just,
I won't swear.
[inaudible].
What about you?

113
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.170
If I for anybody gave a fuck about you,
you know,

114
00:06:49.171 --> 00:06:51.750
named cunt and went back into your fucking life,

115
00:06:51.751 --> 00:06:54.810
they can't find somebody to say that you said something that did something.

116
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.780
It's called being a human being.
Jesus fucking Christ.

117
00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.790
I told you that shit when I was in Scotland,

118
00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:02.070
that woman lifts dead broke dead fucking article.

119
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.740
It was talking about commemorative statues and she's like,

120
00:07:04.741 --> 00:07:08.850
nothing makes my heart sink.
Like when I hear there's,

121
00:07:08.851 --> 00:07:11.740
they're going to put up a commemorative statue.
It's like nothing.

122
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.630
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

123
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.660
<v 0>you fucking a genocide child pornography.</v>

124
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.880
Nothing quite makes you fucking heart drop like the making of a commemorative

125
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.940
statutes.
Oh Jesus.

126
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.363
Um,

127
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.770
<v 1>okay.</v>

128
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.603
<v 0>Anyways.</v>

129
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.910
Can you believe Christopher Columbus was actually a fucking asshole?

130
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:39.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

131
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.100
<v 0>New evidence shows.
It's just like,
where was that new evidence?</v>

132
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.510
What was it just sitting on somebody's desk for fucking 400 years?

133
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.463
<v 1>MMM.</v>

134
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.570
<v 0>He's a fat.
All these fucking people compared to what?
Somebody in 2019 yeah.</v>

135
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:57.530
I would like to think that people learn how to treat other people better each

136
00:07:57.531 --> 00:07:59.480
year.
So what we're supposed to be doing,

137
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.480
you know what I mean?
If you go back and watch an episode of solid gold,

138
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.420
there's a lot of people dancing today that,
uh,

139
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.710
on that day that would get laughed out of the fucking club.

140
00:08:10.711 --> 00:08:12.270
And that was the peak at dancing back then.

141
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.480
But it progressed and now all those moves that were unbelievable and now kind of

142
00:08:21.481 --> 00:08:22.314
basic,

143
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:23.730
<v 1>okay,</v>

144
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.530
<v 0>that's what happened.
So just Kinda,
you know,</v>

145
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:32.250
can you believe the guy that won the Indy 519 55 wouldn't even rip qualified for

146
00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:34.990
the race in 2019?

147
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.500
I don't think this guy's a champion.

148
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.513
<v 1>Okay.</v>

149
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.090
<v 0>I think they need to rethink that championship.</v>

150
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.060
I,
Ben,
we withdraw.
We going 140 miles an hour.
I mean,
the fucking pace guarded,

151
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.450
it goes faster than that.

152
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:56.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

153
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.113
<v 0>MMM.</v>

154
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.083
<v 1>I Dunno.</v>

155
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:06.520
<v 0>So it's just eye to eye.
That's
all right.
If it,</v>

156
00:09:06.521 --> 00:09:10.210
does that do anything,
does it really do anything to say,
hey,
this guy who's,

157
00:09:10.211 --> 00:09:13.590
who's been dead for 40 years is,
is actually this now?
Okay,

158
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:16.100
<v 1>okay.</v>

159
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.330
<v 0>So what am I supposed to do now?</v>

160
00:09:17.331 --> 00:09:21.350
Go back and look at this person's sports career or their fucking movie career

161
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.770
and look at them differently somehow and then sit there and look at myself like

162
00:09:27.771 --> 00:09:31.100
I'm this great fucking person just because I had the luxury of being born when I

163
00:09:31.101 --> 00:09:35.280
was born
and then be so fucking full of myself.

164
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:37.320
Then I'm not looking at this guy being like,
well wait a minute.

165
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:39.090
Someday I'm going to be dead 40 years.

166
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:43.130
And then people go back and see the things that I said and am I going to like,

167
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.610
I'm going to survive that.
Um,
all right,
bill,

168
00:09:47.611 --> 00:09:48.780
I think you made your point.

169
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.440
<v 1>All right.</v>

170
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.200
<v 0>You know,
a lot of people think Abe Lincoln said,
good guy.</v>

171
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.600
Apparently new evidence shows

172
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.150
he went to a fucking Sadie Hawkins dance and a,

173
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.870
he evidently he was fucking quite rude to his date that night.

174
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.630
Four score it Hashtag four score and seven beers ago.
Drink much.

175
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.160
A boy,
I dunno.
Um,
anyways,

176
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:21.760
<v 1>okay.</v>

177
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.850
<v 0>Whatever.
Uh,
so I got one more.
One more fucking night.
See,</v>

178
00:10:24.851 --> 00:10:26.410
this is what I want to open with tonight.

179
00:10:26.411 --> 00:10:30.260
This is what I want to talk about and get this out of my fucking system.
But I,

180
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.550
I hate the fucking document,
my jokes tonight,

181
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.350
so I want to thank everybody that she came out in Manchester,
Glasgow,

182
00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.380
and a Birmingham.
I had a great time and,
uh,

183
00:10:41.381 --> 00:10:43.780
found out that I was not dehydrated.

184
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.300
I actually had a little bit of a stomach virus.
I can't believe it.

185
00:10:49.301 --> 00:10:52.360
What this high quality food that I've been eating here for the last fucking 10

186
00:10:52.361 --> 00:10:54.370
days.
[inaudible]

187
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.993
<v 1>MMM.</v>

188
00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.160
<v 0>Oh my God.
I,
I just don't know if I'm,
I'm just,</v>

189
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.800
I have to be going to the wrong places,

190
00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:03.620
but what they do to what cheeseburger over here,
it's just like,

191
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.690
as an American,
it's offensive.
I feel like it's,

192
00:11:08.691 --> 00:11:11.840
it's a one of our signature dishes.

193
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

194
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:18.420
<v 0>What we added to the international culinary fucking whatever.</v>

195
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.260
Right.
Sorry.
Let's try to be eloquent there.
Um,

196
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.560
for them to just fucking make it the way that they make it.

197
00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.090
I'm not telling me it was just,
there's just something,

198
00:11:28.091 --> 00:11:29.170
there's just something wrong about it.

199
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:30.643
<v 1>MMM.</v>

200
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.860
<v 0>But I keep ordering them in hopes it's almost going to get it right.</v>

201
00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:37.203
Um,

202
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:38.590
<v 1>okay.</v>

203
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.740
<v 0>But anyways,
he had turned out,
I have a a,
I had like a stomach virus now.</v>

204
00:11:41.741 --> 00:11:44.710
I think I'm,
I'm past it.
Um,

205
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.960
so I can give my all to my dick and shit jokes tonight.
Uh,

206
00:11:49.961 --> 00:11:54.810
rest in peace.
Luke Perry,
uh,
Jesus Christ.

207
00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.510
52 fucking years old with kids.

208
00:11:59.120 --> 00:11:59.953
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

209
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.890
<v 0>that's a scary one man.
And then the guy weighed like 130 pounds and I felt okay.</v>

210
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.453
<v 1>Okay.</v>

211
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.550
<v 0>And um,
so now I'm on the Internet and I'm trying to fucking,
you know,
early signs</v>

212
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.900
of a stroke and how you can screen for it and yeah,

213
00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.540
you can do this to screen forward,

214
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:19.600
but don't do it too many times because the scan isn't good for Ya.

215
00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:24.020
And it's just like,
so they had the,
uh,
all these lists here,

216
00:12:24.021 --> 00:12:28.370
like the top causes.
This is for all old men like me.
All right,
you ready?
Go.

217
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:34.100
Top causes for stroke.
All right,

218
00:12:34.101 --> 00:12:37.070
here we go.
Come on hotel.

219
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.790
Right is a hypertension high blood pressure.

220
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.210
I was site when the doctor came and took my blood pressure,

221
00:12:44.211 --> 00:12:48.170
said I have the blood pressure,
but 25 year old,
he goes,
do you work out a lot?

222
00:12:48.171 --> 00:12:49.910
And I said,
I do work out a lot.

223
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:56.300
High cholesterol.
I don't have that,
uh,
diabetes.

224
00:12:56.301 --> 00:12:59.960
I don't have that central obesity.
That means having a belly.

225
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:04.100
I don't have that smoking.
I do that.

226
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:08.550
So that's the one I got to get out because I'm not living for myself anymore.

227
00:13:08.551 --> 00:13:12.290
I live in for the Kiddos.
So,
and I've come to this,
this,

228
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.930
this realization

229
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.180
<v 1>of a,</v>

230
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.880
<v 0>of my,
and I finally figured it out.</v>

231
00:13:21.881 --> 00:13:26.110
I figured out what kind of drinking drink or I am,
why it's gone off the rails.

232
00:13:26.111 --> 00:13:29.050
While all of a sudden it became this guy that needed to take breaks.

233
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.240
And um,
yeah,
the big thing that I,

234
00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:39.240
how I fucked up was I brought it into the house.
All right.

235
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.240
And if I could give anybody any young man,
young woman out there,

236
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:48.390
fucking a yell and fucking transferring a humanoid,

237
00:13:49.481 --> 00:13:51.970
whatever the fuck you supposed to say.
One of those tr words.

238
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.153
<v 1>All right.</v>

239
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.200
<v 0>Yeah.
Listen to this little clip and 40 years.
Okay.</v>

240
00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:01.140
We'll see if they take it down my fucking monument at the innovators of

241
00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:05.880
podcasting and the filthy wink at the podcast museum.

242
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.301
Right.

243
00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:10.740
See if they don't want to take down my fucking golden statue with the fucking

244
00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:13.680
orange leaflet over my balls.
Um,

245
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:15.910
<v 1>okay.</v>

246
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.780
<v 0>You don't want to bring your vices home with you.
Okay.</v>

247
00:14:19.781 --> 00:14:23.520
You want to have to go out and get them.
All right.
So,
uh,

248
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.010
the where I fucked up his,
I,

249
00:14:25.011 --> 00:14:30.011
I ended up having a booze collection at home and because I was buying some

250
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:33.460
higher end stuff,
you start to think,
oh well I'll make a collector.

251
00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:38.170
I'm a connoisseur.
No,
dude,
you're a fucking booze hound.
So,

252
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.280
um,
I'm just gradually just given bottles away.

253
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:46.240
I got some Pappy van Winkle,
I'm not giving that away,
you know,
but I have some,

254
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.930
a couple nicer bottles of things that cost me whatever,

255
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:54.000
80 a hundred bucks or but like to be,
um,

256
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.600
I saw my kids see my drinking.
Okay.
Obviously my kid can listen to the podcast,

257
00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.780
know what I was,
but like I,
so I don't want to be doing that.

258
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.790
I don't want to be smoking cigars in front of her.

259
00:15:03.791 --> 00:15:07.660
I don't be drinking fucking booze,
none of that shit.
She asked me about it.

260
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.050
I'll tell her what I did,
I'll be honest with them and then tell how eh,

261
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:15.460
how fucking stupid it was,
how much time I wasted and all that type of shit.

262
00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.270
You know,
I did have a good time,
you know,
whatever.
But anyways,

263
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.190
I just added some think it's a good look.

264
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.000
You'd be sitting at home fucking uh,

265
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.380
<v 1>yeah,</v>

266
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.213
<v 0>boots.
And</v>

267
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.700
not that I've ever done that in front of the right way to,
she goes to sleep.

268
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.330
But there's been nights where I'm just like,
wow dude,
I am like you.
Like,

269
00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.490
you know,
rolling the dice here.

270
00:15:39.491 --> 00:15:42.760
Cause God forbid I'm down here legally fucking hammered.

271
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:48.040
And what if my wife had some sort of medical issue?
Now I'm drunk,

272
00:15:48.041 --> 00:15:50.650
I got to get my kid and my wife's,
now I have,
what do I do here?

273
00:15:50.651 --> 00:15:51.940
I got to fucking call an Uber.

274
00:15:51.941 --> 00:15:53.830
And all of this shit because I'm too drunk to drive.

275
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.510
Or you might just call the fucking ambulance.

276
00:15:55.511 --> 00:15:58.360
I'm going to be standing there fucking hammered as somebody chest.

277
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.330
Not a good luck.
That's not stress.
That's something a dad does,

278
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:06.850
but not the dad that I want to be.
So I'm getting the shit out of my house.
Uh,

279
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:11.170
I've decided I'm taking the year off and then next year I'll see what I want to

280
00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:13.960
do,
but if there's anything that I want to do,

281
00:16:13.961 --> 00:16:18.340
I'm going to have to go out and go get it.
Um,
and that goes for the cigars too.

282
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.413
Um,

283
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.470
<v 1>okay.</v>

284
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.790
<v 0>I'm,
I'm going to drastically cut that down and um,</v>

285
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.200
I don't know.
But then I remember hearing this quote that said,

286
00:16:28.201 --> 00:16:32.910
beware of the man with no vice or something like that.
Uh,

287
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.073
<v 1>okay</v>

288
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.510
<v 0>man.
With no vice.</v>

289
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:38.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

290
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.140
<v 0>Saying
let's see what it is.</v>

291
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.750
What is this thing?
Show me a man.
Here we go.

292
00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:52.410
Show me a man without vice.
Uh,

293
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:53.263
where is it?

294
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:59.730
Show me a man without vice and I'll show you one without virtue.
No,

295
00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.290
that doesn't,
that just sound like some dumb shit.
A drunk would say at a bar.

296
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:04.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

297
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.840
<v 0>Uh,
well he does in Jay's fucking doing something.
Um,</v>

298
00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:09.870
<v 1>okay,</v>

299
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:11.410
<v 0>so the man,
let's see something here.</v>

300
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:19.640
Vices,
vice quotes.
I actually,

301
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:23.900
I don't understand that.
It's like,
so if you live like a vizsla life,

302
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.790
then you have no virtue.
What is a virtue?

303
00:17:28.791 --> 00:17:30.080
What is the actual definition?

304
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:36.740
So on virtuous behavior is showing high moral standards.
So if you,

305
00:17:36.741 --> 00:17:38.420
if you don't have any low moral standards,

306
00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:42.700
you won't have any high moral standards.
So if,

307
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.540
if you're not fucking blowing a couple of rails,

308
00:17:45.541 --> 00:17:47.970
that means you're not going to help a fucking old lady across the street.

309
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.880
Can't you be the guy who's not doing blow,
not boozing,

310
00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.393
<v 1>eating,</v>

311
00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:00.640
<v 0>you know,
in a healthy way and being a family man and,
and also be a good person.</v>

312
00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:01.503
I don't understand that.

313
00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:03.843
<v 1>You know,</v>

314
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.500
<v 0>is it because if you meet somebody that's strong enough,</v>

315
00:18:07.501 --> 00:18:11.620
is this just insecurity by bucking people that have vices?
Um,

316
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.400
cause I gotta be honest with a,
via [inaudible].
If I can get rid of,

317
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.890
if I don't bows and I didn't smoke cigars,

318
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.170
I think that's it.
That mass,
what I do,
I drink and smoke.

319
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:23.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

320
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.260
<v 0>So now I'm not drinking.
Since I've been over here,</v>

321
00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:29.490
I've had one cigar.

322
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:30.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

323
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.670
<v 0>You know,
I barely smoke.
If I get rid of that,</v>

324
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.053
<v 1>you know,</v>

325
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.000
<v 0>then what?
Jesus Christ.
Well then the bill,</v>

326
00:18:39.001 --> 00:18:42.570
you have the most boring fucking podcast in the history of podcasting,
I guess.

327
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.273
<v 1>MMM.</v>

328
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.310
<v 0>I Dunno.
I,
I got it.
I'll figure it out though.
But I,</v>

329
00:18:49.311 --> 00:18:51.280
I don't want to be this guy just like,
you know,

330
00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.040
I never have a drink or I never have a cigar.

331
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.400
I just gotta get it out of my fucking house.
All right.

332
00:18:57.401 --> 00:18:59.940
I feel like invited a vampire and you know,

333
00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.840
like I'm in the lost boys except with booze and cigars.
Um,
sort of,

334
00:19:04.841 --> 00:19:05.650
I'll do that.

335
00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.430
Then I'll just sit there and judge my wife every time she has a rosy,
nice,

336
00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.170
nice example that you're setting.

337
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.390
<v 1>Um,
I gotta be honest with you,
London,</v>

338
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.700
I'm loving it.
You know,

339
00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.470
<v 0>I was never really a London guy was more Paris gay.
I don't know what happened.</v>

340
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.010
Now I'm starting to like London a little better.
You know,

341
00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.820
despite the fucking food,
Jesus Christ,

342
00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.480
Jesus Christ at the detail,

343
00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.810
the amount of places that they conquered with all these spices in know,

344
00:19:37.811 --> 00:19:39.550
I always heard that they brought them back.
I could,

345
00:19:39.551 --> 00:19:43.240
God knows they're not fucking used them.
I tend to be,
I don't know where to go.

346
00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.240
You know,
they've got too many fucking celebrities out here.

347
00:19:46.241 --> 00:19:51.190
All the spice girls does spice girls.
Right?
Where do they eat these?
No Way.

348
00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:54.970
They put up with this food.
There's no way.
I know last time I came here,

349
00:19:54.971 --> 00:19:58.570
I went to this Indian restaurant that was fucking unbelievable.

350
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.820
And I also went to the ivy the other night and I had the best shepherds five

351
00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.600
overhead.
Um,
so it hasn't been all bad,
but I'll just tell him,

352
00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:11.680
oof.
Everything else I've gone to marriage.
It's like comedy club,

353
00:20:11.681 --> 00:20:15.490
Green Room Bad.
Um,
all right.
But we get it.

354
00:20:15.491 --> 00:20:17.290
You don't like the fucking food?
I,
I'm sorry.

355
00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.520
So what's going on in the world of America?
I miss the good old USA.

356
00:20:21.521 --> 00:20:26.350
Let's see what,
when I want to go to search you s a news.
Let's see what happens.

357
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.440
President Donald Trump's serves fast food to another title team.

358
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:38.380
Yeah.
This is how broke we are after fucking these wars.

359
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:44.560
Why does he keep doing that?
Does he do this to anybody else?
Let's see.

360
00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.760
President Donald Trump,
the service food to another title team,

361
00:20:48.761 --> 00:20:53.350
North Dakota State now the championship football team.

362
00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:55.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

363
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.171
<v 0>Oh,
you know what?</v>

364
00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:58.960
This is North Dakota state and there's a lot of white guys on there.

365
00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.550
He's still giving them fast food.

366
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.233
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

367
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.240
<v 0>I'd love to eat McDonald's in the White House.
It's kind of fucking cool.</v>

368
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.420
Trump welcomed the football championships,
subdivision champions,

369
00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.980
the North Dakota State Bison.

370
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.360
You get him some bison burgers there to the White House on Monday and according

371
00:21:15.361 --> 00:21:18.240
to a pool report,
he served them a lunchtime spread,

372
00:21:18.241 --> 00:21:22.980
a big Mac chick filet sandwiches and French fries among other fast food items.

373
00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.030
Trumps served a similar meal to the Clemson Tigers while they visited the White

374
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.610
House in January.
According to the pool report,

375
00:21:29.611 --> 00:21:33.690
Trump told the biases that he couldn't serve them a meal prepared by the chef.

376
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.440
But I know you people,
several players laughed.

377
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.480
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

378
00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.150
<v 0>Oh,
that he could have served them a meal prepared by the chef.</v>

379
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.830
But I know you people,
several players laughed according to the pool report.

380
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:51.490
A Trump said in January that he personally paid for Clemson's White House faced

381
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:56.950
to face now because it's visit came in the middle of a partial government

382
00:21:57.021 --> 00:21:57.854
shutdown.

383
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

384
00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.340
<v 0>Is this,
yeah.
Maybe it's just him trying to be cool.</v>

385
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:02.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

386
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.710
<v 0>You know,
did he go to college to Trump even go to college?</v>

387
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:11.300
It's amazing how little I know about this guy,
Donald Trump.
What's,

388
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.320
see where the fuck he went.

389
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:14.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

390
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.500
<v 0>He probably went to college where his dad went to college</v>

391
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.520
and that's why there's a legacy here.

392
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.200
He was one of the greatest students ever of this university.

393
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:26.160
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

394
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.940
<v 0>Oh,

This isn't going to show up.
I have no idea how.

<v 1>Yeah.</v>

<v 0>All right.
Oh,

541
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.750
And with that,
let's see if Donald Trump's Wikipedia page came up.
It did.

542
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.240
He was born June 14th,

543
00:32:00.241 --> 00:32:05.220
Gemini 1946.
Uh,
he's,

544
00:32:05.221 --> 00:32:09.990
the current president is born and raised in New York borough of Queens.

545
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:15.690
He got an economics degree from the Wharton School.
That's a good one.

546
00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.720
Yeah,
I know.
That's a good ones.
I've never really heard of it,

547
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:20.940
which means it's a high end.
One

548
00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:24.780
was not on my radar to be applied to.

549
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:30.320
He was appointed president of his family's real estate business in 1971.

550
00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.220
Look at that.

551
00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:36.390
He was only 25 years old and he took on that level of responsibility.

552
00:32:36.391 --> 00:32:40.560
Everybody else gets to go out to a fucking bar and drank,
you know,

553
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.350
<v 1>okay.</v>

554
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:46.790
<v 0>Sing some Karaoke.
And he had to take over the family's real estate business.</v>

555
00:32:46.791 --> 00:32:50.180
See everybody thinks these rich kids have it easy.
You know,

556
00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:55.140
you poor kids have no idea how lucky you are to be 25 and none of the pressures

557
00:32:55.141 --> 00:32:59.880
of a real estate company to take over the company built or renovated skyscraper

558
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:04.380
skyscrapers,
the hotels,
casinos and golf courses.
Trump later stated,

559
00:33:04.381 --> 00:33:08.670
various sites start at various side ventures including licensing his name for

560
00:33:08.671 --> 00:33:11.880
real estate and consumer products.
Yeah,
that's the genius.

561
00:33:11.881 --> 00:33:14.400
That's why when everybody's like giving the finger to a Trump hotel,

562
00:33:14.401 --> 00:33:17.400
it's like it's not really his hotel.
Um,

563
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.590
early life education.

564
00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:25.140
The conflicts of interest.
I mean this,
this is all here,
dude.

565
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.340
This is all what usually you have on a rich guys Wikipedia page.
All right,

566
00:33:29.341 --> 00:33:34.200
let's get to the questions cause I got fucking special to tape here tonight.
Um,

567
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:35.760
<v 1>okay.</v>

568
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.200
<v 0>All right.
What's the first question?
Soccer playoffs.
All right,
so I mentioned,</v>

569
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:44.160
I was saying how weird it is that they don't have a play off play off in the

570
00:33:44.161 --> 00:33:45.810
premier league and how huge that would be.

571
00:33:45.811 --> 00:33:49.170
So evidently this person's going to set me straight as to why they don't do it.

572
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.990
Bill,
they don't have,
they don't have soccer.

573
00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

574
00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:56.430
<v 0>In playoffs they don't play offs and soccer's with the person metric,</v>

575
00:33:56.710 --> 00:34:01.090
but they happened to have various cup competitions that add a different dynamic

576
00:34:01.091 --> 00:34:04.120
to the mix.
When you think about,
think about it,

577
00:34:04.121 --> 00:34:07.390
it's extremely stupid to have playoffs in the first place.

578
00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:12.930
Why would the most consistent and best team to top a table in any sport over the

579
00:34:14.951 --> 00:34:18.940
duration of a season not get recognized as the best team?
Well,
easily.

580
00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:22.210
Well that's easy.
While in our world,
you know,

581
00:34:22.211 --> 00:34:26.440
you have people just the way shit lines up who's in your division,

582
00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:29.380
you end up playing a tougher schedule than somebody else.

583
00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:30.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

584
00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:33.220
<v 0>You know,
and it also depends like when you play somebody,</v>

585
00:34:33.221 --> 00:34:36.640
if their best player was hurt and then the other team comes to play him and that

586
00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:40.650
guy's player is back.
You know what I mean?
All of a sudden,
you know,

587
00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:45.660
it's so just like you play a whole season and somebody one point behind you.

588
00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:47.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

589
00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:51.720
<v 0>You're the champion in there that I don't know.
I like playoffs.</v>

590
00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:54.880
And then also playoffs ads like this pressure.

591
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

592
00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:58.270
<v 0>Where's the team that's supposed to,</v>

593
00:34:58.271 --> 00:35:01.510
when all of a sudden feels this pressure and then they could choke and you have

594
00:35:01.511 --> 00:35:02.410
great stories.

595
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:03.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

596
00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:07.990
<v 0>There's plenty of reasons to have playoffs.
Um,
so I don't think it's stupid.</v>

597
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.800
This extremely stupid.

598
00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:15.130
Well then why do you have the World Cup?
Isn't that stupid?

599
00:35:15.131 --> 00:35:17.980
Isn't that a giant fucking planetary fucking playoff?

600
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.890
Why isn't everybody just fucking stay home?
Um,

601
00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:26.860
anyways,
I don't understand this.
Well,
that's a cup competition.

602
00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.470
That's a different thing.
So you're,
you're,
you're in the playoffs.

603
00:35:29.471 --> 00:35:32.350
As long as it's a cup,
it's extremely stupid.

604
00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:33.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

605
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:35.950
<v 0>I don't think it has.
Anyway.
Hockey is the only sport.</v>

606
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:36.930
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

607
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.130
<v 0>Uh,
where I</v>

608
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.120
<v 1>understand respect the league structure because the Stanley Cup is arguably the</v>

609
00:35:42.121 --> 00:35:45.120
most difficult tropey to win.
All right?
You're all over the map here,
sir.

610
00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:49.740
You can maybe get away with half ass thing in the regular season to clinch

611
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:54.090
playoffs,
but you have a long way to go to hoist the cup.
Uh,

612
00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:57.270
they actually have a playoff format.
And in the English championship,

613
00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.180
which is the League right below the Premier League,
uh,

614
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.820
first and second in the table,

615
00:36:02.821 --> 00:36:07.560
automatically advanced to the premier league while third to six have a two leg

616
00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:11.520
matchup to get an a final for that third promotion spot.
Oh,
that's cool.

617
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:12.610
So that's where you play off,
sir.

618
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:17.280
It's very exciting because there are millions of millions of dollars on the line

619
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.760
with that final game playoff.
All right,
so now you like playoffs.

620
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:26.390
Also offside is when the attacking player is passed the final defender at the

621
00:36:27.331 --> 00:36:31.380
point the ball is played.
If you didn't have this in place,

622
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:35.820
players would just cherry pick,
get uh,
all game.

623
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:40.290
And the beautiful game would be a shit show.
Rat Fest.

624
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:45.510
Uh,
come back to
Niagara.
Canada,

625
00:36:45.511 --> 00:36:49.470
take care.
Um,
I get that shit that you can't just hang.

626
00:36:49.471 --> 00:36:54.390
But my thing is is if somebody is going to run past you,
yeah,

627
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.990
<v 0>they're not just cherry pick and hanging down the other end of the field.</v>

628
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.130
If somebody is going to run fast to you and they're faster,

629
00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.500
you can just slow down and make them off sides.
That's fucking stupid.

630
00:37:04.501 --> 00:37:08.640
That guys fast and then you,
we beat you.
That's my problem.
I'm not saying that,

631
00:37:08.641 --> 00:37:09.474
you know.

632
00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:10.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

633
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.630
<v 0>You know,
look in hockey they have an off sides line.</v>

634
00:37:13.631 --> 00:37:15.790
You've got to clear the fucking zone when the puck comes out.

635
00:37:15.791 --> 00:37:18.550
But like if somebody blows past you with the park,

636
00:37:18.551 --> 00:37:20.740
they don't have to fucking wait to you get into the zone.

637
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.113
<v 1>Okay.</v>

638
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.160
<v 0>You know what I mean?
Sorry.
I know it sounds like I'm drinking.</v>

639
00:37:27.161 --> 00:37:31.560
I'm just drinking a giant bottle of water,
glass bottle.
Um,

640
00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:36.820
fancy man as Jim Norton likes to say.
Um,
all right,

641
00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:38.170
well I get that sir.
I don't think,

642
00:37:38.171 --> 00:37:41.730
I actually think that you actually enjoy playoffs.
Um,

643
00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.300
but you also enjoy the premiere league.

644
00:37:43.301 --> 00:37:46.690
So now you have to say that it's extremely stupid.
And of course,

645
00:37:46.691 --> 00:37:49.090
because you're from Canada,
you get it in the hockey.

646
00:37:49.091 --> 00:37:53.350
You understand those playoffs.
All right,
sending food back.
All right,

647
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.860
this is what I wanted to hear from people,
how you go about it.
And he says,

648
00:37:56.861 --> 00:38:01.861
I'm a 28 year old male living amongst you and all the other narcissistic

649
00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:06.940
transplant concept decided they were too good for their hometowns and needed to

650
00:38:06.941 --> 00:38:11.941
move to this coastal Eden that we call Los Angeles and attempt to achieve a

651
00:38:11.951 --> 00:38:15.190
dream of creating career.
Doing what I love.

652
00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:20.810
Parentheses creating slash playing music.
Uh,
well,
sorry.

653
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.110
If you wanted to play music for a living,
you know,

654
00:38:23.111 --> 00:38:28.111
you probably would eventually moved to Los Angeles to get more in the mix or

655
00:38:28.241 --> 00:38:31.900
Nashville,
don't you move where the industry is?

656
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:37.070
Um,
at any rate,
mmm.

657
00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.690
I guess he's,
he's to be joking that,
that Los Angeles is an Eden.

658
00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.230
It's not an Eden.
You had to steal water to try and turn it into a fucking Eden.

659
00:38:45.231 --> 00:38:47.600
It's a shit show that shouldn't be there.
But it is.

660
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:51.720
And what we've done with it is,
is amazing.
I mean,

661
00:38:51.721 --> 00:38:54.510
am I saying we now with Los Angeles,
I've had been there that long.
Um,

662
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:55.910
at any rate being a musician,

663
00:38:55.911 --> 00:38:58.940
I worked a number of side gigs including waiting tables.

664
00:38:58.941 --> 00:39:03.030
I've waited tables at cheap joints as well as fine dining establishment.

665
00:39:03.031 --> 00:39:06.270
It's like award winning chef dudes.
Oh,

666
00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:10.200
I think this guy was being sarcastic about uh,

667
00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.210
<v 1>yeah,</v>

668
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:12.043
<v 0>la.</v>

669
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:12.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

670
00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.880
<v 0>Um,
anyways,
at any rate,
uh,</v>

671
00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.610
I think I can set you straight on sending food back basically.

672
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:20.920
And maybe obviously the cheaper the restaurant,

673
00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:24.850
the riskier it is to send your food back.
Great Point.
Uh,

674
00:39:24.851 --> 00:39:26.950
when I work fine dining,

675
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:31.120
you're primarily in a restaurant with a kitchen is actually open to the public.

676
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:35.740
So sending food back is handled in front of the clientele and that's would never

677
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:39.880
be subjected to being fucked with another great point.
Uh,
that being said,

678
00:39:39.881 --> 00:39:44.680
as you go down in price,
typically not always,
your kitchen is getting a little,

679
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.060
little bit more hidden.

680
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.600
You're employees are probably making less and on top of that,

681
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:51.850
they're probably always,
again,

682
00:39:51.851 --> 00:39:55.980
not always because I realize some cheaper restaurants are amazing quality,

683
00:39:55.981 --> 00:39:59.740
et Cetera,
not as passionate about what they're doing.
In that case,

684
00:39:59.741 --> 00:40:04.090
your food will possibly get fucked with.
Okay,
here's another person.

685
00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:05.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

686
00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.000
<v 0>Uh,
hey Billy,
sugar,
tits.
Um,</v>

687
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:09.860
<v 1>okay.</v>

688
00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:13.040
<v 0>Never worry about sending food back with social media today.</v>

689
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:18.070
Any decent restaurant would rather you tell them then tell the world that that a

690
00:40:18.671 --> 00:40:21.380
meal was poor.
If a dick.

691
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.530
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

692
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.930
<v 0>If a Dick Ed works in the kitchen.</v>

693
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:31.980
What if a dick,
he d like the name Ed of a Dick.

694
00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:35.580
Ed Works in the kitchen for Dick head.
Oh,

695
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:38.520
this person was texting and I guess there's some sort of weird,

696
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:42.480
you get the capital thing in a space button.
If at Dick had works in the kitchen,

697
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.300
who's going to spit in your food?

698
00:40:45.301 --> 00:40:47.940
You can guarantee the kitchen's a Shithole anyways.

699
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.820
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

700
00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.640
<v 0>See you at Royal Albert Hall on Monday.
Wait a minute.</v>

701
00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:53.680
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

702
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:58.270
<v 0>never worry about sending food back.
And then you end it with,</v>

703
00:40:58.271 --> 00:41:00.730
if a Dick had works in the kitchen,
is gonna spit in your food?

704
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.210
You can guarantee the kitchen's a Shithole anyways.

705
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.280
Meaning it doesn't make a difference cause what's already in the food.

706
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:08.990
I don't know about that.
All right.

707
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:15.070
It's not making me feel better.
All right.

708
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:18.910
Formula e a Billy burnout.
Uh,

709
00:41:18.911 --> 00:41:23.650
you mentioned on a recent podcast that the sports low between football and the

710
00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:28.180
start of Formula One,
uh,
March madness,
NBA players,
et Cetera,

711
00:41:28.181 --> 00:41:29.560
has you as you down,

712
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.250
have you tried to watch formula e to fill the gap?

713
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:36.400
I'm watching for the first time machine year and it's been great.

714
00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.890
I got the hiccups now.
This is the all electric racing series.

715
00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.900
It's real easy to get up to date since the races or time to have a maximum

716
00:41:45.901 --> 00:41:49.740
length of 45 minutes plus one lap.
Um,

717
00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:54.000
the first four races this season are all up on youtube and there they are

718
00:41:54.001 --> 00:41:58.860
carried live on Spock's Fox sports two in the U s there is no team or set of

719
00:41:58.861 --> 00:42:03.690
teams that dominate like in Formula One and there's been passing Galore in every

720
00:42:03.691 --> 00:42:07.770
race.
All right.
I like this including a photo finish and the last race.

721
00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.790
So it's not about getting to the first corner and blocking for the rest of the

722
00:42:11.791 --> 00:42:13.710
race.
There are no pit stops,

723
00:42:13.711 --> 00:42:16.710
but the team still have to strategize to conserve energy.

724
00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.250
So they don't run out of power.
Sure.
The cars don't go as fast,

725
00:42:20.251 --> 00:42:24.540
but the competition makes more,
uh,
more than makes up for it.

726
00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:28.230
In my opinion.
Bonus is in the last two races of the seas.

727
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:32.280
Seasons will be held back to back days in New York City in July.

728
00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:36.570
Oh Shit.
I might be in New York in July chairs and go fuck yourself.

729
00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:40.230
Well eventually I feel like those cars will be faster than the Formula One cars

730
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:45.950
because I'm just looking at how regular cars are in the street.

731
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.863
You know what I mean?

732
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:53.480
Like they can make like what a Tesla is shaped like the fact that zero to 60 can

733
00:42:53.481 --> 00:42:56.420
beat a fucking Lamborghini.
Um,

734
00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:00.770
I would think that if you applied that same shit to like a race car and

735
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:05.030
absolutely no weight other than the battery,
all it comes down to is it,
is it,

736
00:43:05.031 --> 00:43:08.600
the battery is going to be later than the fucking engine.

737
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:10.903
Um,

738
00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.810
and then you don't have all that bullshit under the car where air can get caught

739
00:43:14.811 --> 00:43:17.500
because you can just have that smooth fucking thing like they do underneath the

740
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:22.370
Tesla.
I Dunno.
I would think that the cars are going to get faster.

741
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:27.050
Right?
I don't know.

742
00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:30.710
I do think it's funny that people that aren't a gas combustion engines will

743
00:43:30.711 --> 00:43:34.130
think it's funny that they can only run them for 45 minutes and ignore the fact

744
00:43:34.131 --> 00:43:39.080
that the gas combustion engines also,
I have to pull over and get gas.
You know,

745
00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:44.180
it's also not a limitless energy source.

746
00:43:44.181 --> 00:43:46.700
What you got to have is you got to have solar power against somebody with a

747
00:43:46.701 --> 00:43:51.680
giant fucking solar panel duct taped to their fucking head,
all right,

748
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:57.440
and a giant magnifying glass above it.
The driver dies every race,

749
00:43:57.441 --> 00:44:02.000
but there's no pit stops and can still go 500 miles.
That's how I would do it.

750
00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.690
All right,
baby name.
He just get people on death row to drive,

751
00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.180
so then also they won't give a fuck.
You know,

752
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.990
if if this space and not to go into the corner,
it'll be really fucking excited.

753
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:15.170
He had death row inmates with a fucking satellite,

754
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:19.490
not a satellite of fucking what he'd done a strobe,
I just said it.

755
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:23.750
Solar panel on their head with a giant magnifying glass.
All right?

756
00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:27.530
Right before they get in the car there,
eat their lead,
their last meal,

757
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:30.770
whatever it is,
you know,
a little bit of hog and dose,

758
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:34.260
the turn up and some fucking chicken,
whatever the fuck it is they want,
you know,

759
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:38.460
and you'd get them in there and that's it.
It's like,
all right,

760
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:43.320
and here's the thing,
if you win,
whoever wins doesn't get killed.

761
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:49.020
Wait,
no,
because you'd already died.
Oh,
they got it.

762
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:52.980
Yet somehow like if you,
if you win,
it's like the dirty dozen.
If you win,

763
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.920
like they let you back out on the street,
Kellen,
back on the street,

764
00:44:55.921 --> 00:45:00.850
the fucking murderers.
I,

765
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:05.300
no,
it's gotta be something you can do.
I don't know what,
again,
I does the heat.

766
00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:06.890
I don't have it all worked out.
All right,

767
00:45:06.891 --> 00:45:11.850
baby named negotiation strategy bell,
my wife and our and,

768
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.170
and I are having our first baby.
Congratulations.
So baby girl.
Oh,

769
00:45:15.171 --> 00:45:18.200
you hit the lottery and we couldn't be happier.
Happier.

770
00:45:18.201 --> 00:45:21.980
The only issue is picking her name and negotiations are deadlocked.

771
00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.310
Here's the negotiation positions.
All right.

772
00:45:25.311 --> 00:45:27.740
I'm going to tell you this before I go any further,

773
00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:29.100
<v 1>okay.</v>

774
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.360
<v 0>All right.
Never tell your daughter about this,</v>

775
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:32.660
<v 1>okay.</v>

776
00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:34.970
<v 0>All right.
Whatever her name is,
that's her name.</v>

777
00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.180
If you lose all your wife loses on the debate,

778
00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:42.800
do not fucking bring that up to your kid.
Whatever their name is.
The name.

779
00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:44.420
All right.
All right.
My wife's tastes.

780
00:45:44.421 --> 00:45:49.330
The names could be best described as somewhere between Hollywood diva and in

781
00:45:49.331 --> 00:45:52.160
1960s,
flower child.
Oh my God.

782
00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:57.170
Thank names like apple and moon beam.
Uh,

783
00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:01.700
Layla like the Eric Clapton Song is their best idea to date,

784
00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.330
but it wouldn't be my first choice.
No,
that song's too popular.

785
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:08.840
Um,
I dunno.

786
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.710
Waitlists not bad.
I don't know.
Okay.
I would like to get my grandmother's name.

787
00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:18.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

788
00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:22.800
<v 0>For me.
Co and old Japanese name somewhere.</v>

789
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.150
That's got to be a middle name dude.

790
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.120
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

791
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.620
<v 0>anywhere.
My daughter's name,</v>

792
00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:32.360
she died before I was born and it would really mean a lot to me and my side of

793
00:46:32.361 --> 00:46:36.020
the family to get that even as a middle of the eye.
That's a middle name too.

794
00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:41.610
My wife doesn't like the name fool me Co
uh,

795
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:46.670
specifically she doesn't like the way it sounds and thinks it sounds too close

796
00:46:47.191 --> 00:46:52.080
to the word Fumar which you as a scholar of French,
no.

797
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.800
Is the verb to smoke as into smoke.

798
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:59.970
Uh Oh.
Uh,
in French.
No,

799
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:03.450
I knew a rocket was something like that.
Um,

800
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:08.510
I am basically willing to concede the first name to get full Mikko as a middle

801
00:47:09.151 --> 00:47:11.700
name.
Well that's cool because if the kids like half Japanese,

802
00:47:11.701 --> 00:47:13.620
I don't know if you guys are full Japanese.
That's cool.

803
00:47:13.621 --> 00:47:17.610
So you get the little bit of that in there and the name.
A lot of people do that.

804
00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:22.680
Um,
anyways,
he said,
but I haven't gotten much headway in negotiation.

805
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.431
Again,

806
00:47:23.431 --> 00:47:27.960
I am willing to concede that the first name be something kind of weird to get my

807
00:47:27.961 --> 00:47:28.950
grandmother's name,

808
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:33.960
which is admittedly unusual but highly meaningful at as the middle name.

809
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:38.140
I have two questions.
Sorry.
First of all,

810
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:41.320
if your wife is going to go all hippy trippy dippy

811
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:46.370
and then you know,
you can't be like fucking,

812
00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:48.853
<v 1>yeah,</v>

813
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:53.260
<v 0>like wheat grass shots for me.
Coach Johnson.</v>

814
00:47:53.261 --> 00:47:56.790
Do you can't have that?
I would think.
Oh man,

815
00:47:56.791 --> 00:47:59.490
this is tough because I have to question how did you,

816
00:47:59.491 --> 00:48:02.130
when the lovely new Nia go about picking your daughter's name,

817
00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:07.490
what is my path to getting my wife to agree to Fomoco for me call as my

818
00:48:07.771 --> 00:48:08.850
daughter's middle name.

819
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:13.543
<v 1>MMM.</v>

820
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:18.773
<v 0>I think,</v>

821
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:24.400
I think you guys need to stop thinking about ourselves and think about your

822
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:25.234
daughter.

823
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

824
00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.240
<v 0>Okay.
As she's going to have to be this name.</v>

825
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:29.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

826
00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:32.290
<v 0>Somebody is going to have to say this name and she's going to have to be like,</v>

827
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:36.430
yes.
Present.
Okay.
So

828
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:38.613
<v 1>yeah,</v>

829
00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:41.260
<v 0>I would just say to my wife like,
listen,
all right.</v>

830
00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:42.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

831
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:45.230
<v 0>I'm willing to concede for me all.
Alright.</v>

832
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:49.760
But where she's not going to have some hippy,
trippy fucking

833
00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:52.683
<v 1>fucking</v>

834
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:56.430
<v 0>white celebrity kid fucking name.
Can't have that.</v>

835
00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:58.640
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

836
00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.840
<v 0>You're not naming this kid after an emotion or a fucking fruit or vegetable.</v>

837
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.273
<v 1>Okay.</v>

838
00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:10.000
<v 0>It's just a fucking assets.
Just a fucking asshole thing to do to your kid.</v>

839
00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

840
00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:14.550
<v 0>It's so fucking self involved and it's so just like,
oh,
look at me,</v>

841
00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:18.660
look how creative I am.
It's just like,
don't,
don't you remember going to school,

842
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:21.840
don't you remember those,
those first brutal years,

843
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.690
if there was anything even remotely different about you,

844
00:49:24.691 --> 00:49:28.380
you were going to get the shit kicked out of you.
It's going to happen anyways.

845
00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.270
Why help the other kids out?

846
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:32.793
<v 1>Why</v>

847
00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.680
<v 0>the kids going to hate the fucking name?</v>

848
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

849
00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.730
<v 0>Um,
anyways,
so I would be thinking about the kid.</v>

850
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.940
I wouldn't be thinking about my own family and all of that type of shit.

851
00:49:44.941 --> 00:49:47.640
Just get the kid a fucking cool name.
That sounds good,

852
00:49:47.641 --> 00:49:51.240
but the last name and just let your kid be who they want to fucking be.

853
00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:52.463
All right.

854
00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.910
And don't force your fucking agenda on them from day one with some fucked up God

855
00:49:57.911 --> 00:50:01.480
damn name.
That's my 2 cents.
All right?

856
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:03.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

857
00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:06.630
<v 0>Um,
all right.
Lady asked me to not Burp at the gym.</v>

858
00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:08.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

859
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:13.000
<v 0>Okay.
Uh,
hey Bilbo saggy baggy jeans.</v>

860
00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.280
Uh,
I was at the gym the other day.

861
00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:17.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

862
00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:18.090
<v 0>Uh,</v>

863
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:23.040
in my building trying to get back in shape for this summer as I've been at Booz

864
00:50:23.041 --> 00:50:27.090
bag getting through this fucking winter.
Anyways,
I was on the elliptical,

865
00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.550
a nice brisk pace.
Um,

866
00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:30.550
<v 1>okay.</v>

867
00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:34.820
<v 0>Hundred and 85 Rpm is Jesus Christ and was listening to your podcasts actually.</v>

868
00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:38.630
And there was one other woman on a treadmill,
three treadmills away,

869
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:42.230
uh,
walking at a slight incline.

870
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:43.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

871
00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:48.090
<v 0>And I'm guessing a speed of 2.3 and reading a novel.</v>

872
00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:52.710
Oh yeah.
That's not working out.
Uh,
my family has acid reflux.

873
00:50:52.711 --> 00:50:56.040
So sometimes at the gym when I'm really pushing it,
I would

874
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.710
<v 1>okay.</v>

875
00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:00.500
<v 0>Inherently,
lightly burp every few minutes.</v>

876
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:03.470
At about 25 minutes into my session,

877
00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:07.460
I hear something coming from my head phones and this late fifties,

878
00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.660
wish lady is waving at,

879
00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:11.590
<v 1>okay.</v>

880
00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:13.060
<v 0>Me Out of my periphery.</v>

881
00:51:13.061 --> 00:51:18.061
I looked over at her and move my earpiece away to hear and she said nicely,

882
00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.940
could you please not burp anymore?
It's distracting me.

883
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:27.850
Well Dude,
if you fucking belching while running 185,

884
00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:32.970
I mean,
it sounds like you're flying.
Just run a Bra.

885
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:38.920
Uh,
I mean,
what are you doing?
You're in public.
Um,
anyway,

886
00:51:38.921 --> 00:51:43.420
Bill,
the amount of rage I was filled with for such an insane requests was

887
00:51:43.421 --> 00:51:47.470
unfathomable.
Well.
How loud were you burping?
You had your headphones on?

888
00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:51.190
She put up with it for 20 fucking minutes.
He said,

889
00:51:51.191 --> 00:51:53.920
I thought about going to apologize to her,

890
00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:58.240
asking her name and giving her a fake name from myself and then telling the

891
00:51:58.241 --> 00:52:01.570
leasing off,
see office,
what a [inaudible] this lady was.

892
00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:05.050
What is with you young people just wanting to tell on each other.

893
00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.320
Did you want to make a video of it and then fucking uploaded?

894
00:52:09.321 --> 00:52:12.020
I just thought you guys are all just trying to get each other in trouble and

895
00:52:12.021 --> 00:52:16.690
kicked out of things.
The fucking rat generation.

896
00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:20.920
Uh,
I refrain,
finish my workout and continued on with my day.

897
00:52:20.921 --> 00:52:25.160
My question for you is one,
am I just,
uh,

898
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:27.020
being completely,
uh,

899
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:32.230
am I just in just being completely flabbergasted by a lady walking on a

900
00:52:33.051 --> 00:52:37.040
treadmill,
reading a book,
telling me not to Burp when I have.

901
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:38.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

902
00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.360
<v 0>Gerd,
g.
E.
R.
D.
N.
Two,
what,</v>

903
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:45.620
what have you done in that situation to do?
First of all,
you know,

904
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:51.710
how the fuck does she know that you have acid fucking reflux and stop acting

905
00:52:51.711 --> 00:52:53.060
like you have leukemia?

906
00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.870
You know what I mean?
This is this right here.
This is what's wrong with,

907
00:52:59.871 --> 00:53:04.340
with with what social media did to the individual.
You're in a public gym,

908
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:05.600
you're belching.

909
00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:10.230
No one wants to listen to your fucking bourbon and you're a boozy fat fuck

910
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:13.580
because of the winter.
I respect the fact you're trying to lose the weight.

911
00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:17.300
You know?
Maybe if you ate better,
you wouldn't have these.

912
00:53:17.301 --> 00:53:20.720
This will fuck wants to sit and listen to you burp and it gives a fuck.

913
00:53:20.721 --> 00:53:24.020
She's over there walk and a half a mile,
an hour with the book.
That's her loss.

914
00:53:24.021 --> 00:53:27.230
She's not really working,
but she waited for fucking 20 minutes.

915
00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:31.850
Feed a belt should out of your system and you didn't.
It's fucking gross.
No.

916
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:33.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

917
00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:34.131
<v 0>No.
I would take,</v>

918
00:53:34.131 --> 00:53:38.630
I need a pack of fucking Rolaids and go for a walk around the block,

919
00:53:38.631 --> 00:53:39.161
but I mean you,

920
00:53:39.161 --> 00:53:43.790
you can't be like belching in public and then try and turn around and make

921
00:53:43.791 --> 00:53:47.960
yourself the victim because you got acid reflux.
You know

922
00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:52.550
what if she was really gassy and was just farting the entire time?

923
00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:54.510
<v 1>Okay,</v>

924
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:59.440
<v 0>yeah.
She says,
okay,
I am irritable bowel syndrome.
Well,
fucking,
you know,</v>

925
00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:03.580
go drink some of that pink shit and fucking go for a walk.

926
00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:04.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

927
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:08.350
<v 0>They'll come in here and close the Goddamn door.
Yeah.</v>

928
00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:12.220
You're fucking gassy horror.
I don't know.
I don't want to tell you

929
00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.420
I,
I'd say,
yeah,
you're in the wrong there,
sir.

930
00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:17.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

931
00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:20.070
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
no one wants to go to the gym.</v>

932
00:54:20.071 --> 00:54:23.430
Listen to burping going 90 miles an hour and a fucking elliptical.

933
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:26.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

934
00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:26.451
<v 0>And I don't,</v>

935
00:54:26.451 --> 00:54:31.080
I don't care about your acid reflux and how it affects you as a person.

936
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:33.870
Um,
I think you need to take that into consideration.

937
00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:36.613
<v 1>You know,</v>

938
00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.200
<v 0>why don't you just go get one of those TRX bands and just work out in the house?</v>

939
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:41.940
We can easily go for a walk.

940
00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:43.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

941
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:47.370
<v 0>You know,
it's better for the environment,
all the energy,</v>

942
00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:51.310
then an elliptical users.
Let's go walk up the hill.

943
00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:54.240
He can fucking Burp to your heart's content.
Then you're not bugging her.

944
00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:58.020
And she could sit there and fucking slowly walk to her grave while she reads the

945
00:54:58.021 --> 00:55:01.950
next Harry Potter
fucking novel.
Right.
Does that work?

946
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:05.490
Just didn't work for everybody.
I hope it does.
Um,
all right.

947
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.340
I am going to have to pull up a little bit short here.

948
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:08.323
<v 1>MMM.</v>

949
00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.660
<v 0>I apologize.
I just have to,</v>

950
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:14.900
I gotta tape this fucking thing tonight and then I'll be back in the states.

951
00:55:14.901 --> 00:55:16.970
Might be a little jet lag.
I know these last couple of ones,

952
00:55:16.971 --> 00:55:21.350
I've been a little fucking scatterbrain and jetlag that just been working a

953
00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:26.330
little too hard,
but you know,
after tonight I'm on the other side of it and,
uh,

954
00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:29.930
hopefully I'll go back to,
I'm not being as scatterbrained,

955
00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:34.640
just the normal level of scatter brain ish shit that I say.
All right.
That is it.

956
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:35.810
Go fuck yourselves.

957
00:55:35.811 --> 00:55:38.990
I'll check in on you on Thursday and thank you from the bottom,
my heart,

958
00:55:38.991 --> 00:55:43.400
everybody that showed up on this run through,
uh,

959
00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:48.940
the UK.
I've been having a great time.
All right,
that is it.
I'll see you Thursday.
