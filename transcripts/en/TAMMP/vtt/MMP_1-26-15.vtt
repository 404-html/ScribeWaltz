00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:02.631
Hey,

2
00:00:02.631 --> 00:00:06.200
what's going on is bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.690
January 26,
2015 what's going on?
How are you?

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.760
How's it going?
Um,

5
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.820
I am doing this at about 10:41 PM Monday night in Perth,

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.810
Australia.
Yeah.
Sorry.
You guys are going to deal with my awful Australian accent.

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.590
Um,
and also the shitty recording thing then I'm going to use this week because I

8
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:35.390
was not lugging my fucking mix up all the way over here.

9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.770
I remember I had a flat,

10
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:41.771
I was packing up the mixer and last time I was in Australia I remember I,

11
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.700
I fucking,

12
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.070
I plugged in the mixture and it got it all shorted out even though I had the

13
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:53.300
thing to uh,
the adapter,
whatever the fuck you call it.

14
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.020
Anyways,
I'm in a fucking hotel room right now.

15
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.100
<v 1>And it's gross.
I'm going to grow so fucking hotel room right now.</v>

17
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.380
Um,
I don't,
I don't even know where to begin to describe first of all,

18
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.090
the little fucking round coffee table.

19
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:13.560
I had to wipe the whole thing down from the sticky drinks from the last time.

20
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.600
And uh,
then the fucking,
the,
the rug is just like,

21
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.350
I'm trying to find an area of the rug that isn't stained.
Overrated.
Everybody.

22
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.880
The Hyatt,
the fucking high it.
I remember when I was a kid,

23
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.510
you know,
the fucking hired,

24
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.400
even like a Hilton was considered nice.
Now granted I grew up in a family that,

25
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:36.150
you know,

26
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.500
a number of times a month we had chipped beef on toast or chicken,

27
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:45.060
Allah King for dinner,
the scallop potatoes and ham.

28
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.390
It's just before the food network.
So whatever,

29
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.450
whatever the fuck recipes were handed down or on the back of a fucking Rice

30
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.030
Krispie box,
that's what she ate.
If you think about some of the shit,
your head,

31
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.470
oh yeah,
this fucking

32
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.390
<v 0>hm.</v>

33
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.180
<v 1>Goulash,
Hungarian Goulash.
That was actually good.</v>

34
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.360
Then we had this other shit and my mother used to put these fucking

35
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.780
<v 0>okay</v>

36
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.220
<v 1>noodles in it.
And one day my older brother told me they were actually worms.</v>

37
00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:17.380
And every time I went to either it'd be like fucking gag.

38
00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:19.810
And My mother didn't give a shit.
She make me finish it.
I can't believe,

39
00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:24.310
I can't remember the name of it anyways,
whatever.
But back in the day,
you know,

40
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.450
a height and the Hilton more nice.
Now I don't know what happened.

41
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:33.070
I don't think they've bought a rug much less shampooed one each time I'm

42
00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:35.540
thinking I'm staying at the Hyatt.
I always thought the Hyatt,

43
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.460
this is going to be great.

44
00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:40.690
It's still stuck in my head like way back in the fucking day

45
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.160
places a Shital.
Um,
anyways,
but I am excited to be out here.

46
00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:52.780
This is the furthest into a Australia that I've ever been.
Nice.

47
00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:56.480
14 hour flight to Sydney and then uh,

48
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.810
we landed and

49
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.560
<v 0>okay.</v>

50
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.060
<v 1>Fucking went into a hotel.</v>

51
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.700
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

52
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.320
<v 1>Hung out for part of the day and then I had to do,
um,
some big talk show.</v>

53
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.190
I can't even remember the name of it.
I'm so fucking jet liked.
It was weird.

54
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.610
It was weird.
We uh,
this is how we saved the thing.

55
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:19.930
I went down into a conference room in the hotel and they had me sitting in the

56
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:21.400
room and then another room,

57
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:25.500
they had the camera that I just look into and talk and um,

58
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.910
that person in there was in a room with the light shut out.

59
00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:32.510
So I look like some crazy person when my wife came in because I was sitting

60
00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:37.130
there with the light on me talking into a dark room and I'm trying to be

61
00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:40.070
pleasant,
but it's actually a really fun show.
I wish I could have done it live.

62
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.080
So,
um,
anyway,

63
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:46.520
so I'll be letting you guys know my fucking adventures over here as I go.

64
00:03:46.521 --> 00:03:48.710
Like I said,
I'm starting off here in Perth,

65
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.450
I believe the next night is in Melbourne,
Melbourne,
however the fuck you say it.

66
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.740
And um,
then Brisbane and then Sydney,

67
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.610
and then I'm done.
That's going to take a week.

68
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.010
And then I'm over to New Zealand and up to Singapore,

69
00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:06.470
Hong Kong and then the fucking Mumbai,
India,

70
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.910
then over to New York to go do the,
uh,
the Patrice O'Neal benefit.

71
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.930
So there you go.
Let's can be my God damn week.
Um,

72
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.800
<v 0>yeah.</v>

73
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.430
<v 1>All right,</v>

74
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.750
the fuck can I talk about other than just being our God damn plane for the last

75
00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:26.100
fucking day of my life,
where do we begin?
Where do we begin?

76
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.690
Did anything happen this week?

77
00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:32.570
I don't know if you guys saw this week I was on the bill Maher show.
Um,

78
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.760
I don't think I've ever felt so dumb in my life.
You know,

79
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:39.070
I felt like when I was on Bill Maher show,
I felt like I,

80
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.210
if I went on ESPN and I didn't watch sports,
that's what it felt like.

81
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.570
Everybody's throwing out these fucking stats.
It was like fantasy football,

82
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.980
except they were talking about terrorism or jails or something.

83
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:51.814
I don't even know.

84
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.423
<v 0>MMM.</v>

85
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.280
<v 1>Did the Larry Wilmore show to the first one had a great time on that one.</v>

86
00:04:58.281 --> 00:04:59.150
And that was another one.

87
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.170
It's politician from New Jersey was just firing out these fucking stallion,

88
00:05:03.171 --> 00:05:06.200
well 85,
but said a black bales a day.

89
00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:08.930
They don't have enough toothpicks in their life.
And,
uh,
you know,

90
00:05:08.931 --> 00:05:13.220
if you're a white male,
you give that plenty of everybody nodding and a Grad,

91
00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:15.200
no fucking idea what anybody was talking about.

92
00:05:15.201 --> 00:05:19.990
And you've probably seen what bill,
you know,
you're dumb,
you know,
you're not,

93
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.571
you know,
uh,

94
00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:24.220
meet the press kind of fucking person either on a real or a fake news show.

95
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:27.640
Why the fuck would you go do those gigs?
Because everybody,

96
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.090
I am promoting a movie that comes out January 30th called black or white,

97
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.260
that stars Kevin Costner,

98
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.290
Octavius Spencer and was written by Mike binder and directed by Mike binder.

99
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.190
And um,
had a great time working on that thing.

100
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.020
And you know,

101
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.350
the classic Hollywood didn't want to make it.

102
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.530
Kevin Costner loved the story and he's worked with Mike binder before a movie

103
00:05:57.531 --> 00:06:02.420
called upside of anger and Costner said,
fuck it,
we're going to make this movie.

104
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.970
And he ended up putting up his own money.
So,
um,

105
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.310
if you have the time and you have,
you know,

106
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.560
20th 30 close friends,

107
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:17.450
if he could drag them out to the local Cineplex and,
uh,
buy a ticket,

108
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.120
watch it legally and that type of thing,
that would be awesome.

109
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:24.040
I would really appreciate it's called black or white.
I actually play a lawyer.

110
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.500
I play Kevin Costner's lawyer Anthony Mackey's in it may come on and soon to be

111
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:33.170
star a Jillian Astellas in it.
I mean,
it's just,

112
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.230
it's a veritable who's who except for me.

113
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.040
Somehow I snuck in there.
Um,
should I tell the story?
Bill,

114
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:46.550
how did you get the part in that movie?
Uh,
you know what the Conan O'brien show,

115
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.990
I was on Conan and running my Yap in my binder.

116
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:53.390
I had a friend who was watching and said,
hey,
you gotta see this guy?

117
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:56.510
This guy's funny binder watched it and said,
hey,
you know what?

118
00:06:56.511 --> 00:07:00.170
That's the guy that's Rick Reynolds and I didn't even have to audition for it.

119
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.690
And I fucking went out to New Orleans when we shot it.

120
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.060
And I had no idea what I was getting myself into as far as,
uh,

121
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.270
I'm trying to think when I even read the fucking thing,

122
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.100
when I even read the script,
I think I read it as I was flying out there,

123
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.350
you know,
cause that's where I am in this business.

124
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.690
If you say I have a movie,
I say yes before you even tell me what it's about.

125
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.450
Speaking of which,
I had another one that came out.

126
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:32.750
I actually did a Zombie servers.

127
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.560
It's a movie about beavers that turned into zombies.
Okay.

128
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:40.520
And if that doesn't get your ass off the couch,
I don't think anything will,
um,

129
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.090
you know,
people trying to give me shit about that movie,
like Xom view too.

130
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.960
Like we didn't know that it was a joke going into it.
A friend of mine,
Jordan,

131
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:49.460
Ruben,
Ruben,

132
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:52.730
I used to do a stand up with him like 20 fucking years ago in New York,

133
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:56.640
called me up and said,
hey bill,
I'm uh,
doing this movie.
Um,

134
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.000
it's fucking over the top.
It's crazy.
It's ridiculous.

135
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:03.770
So I was wondering if you would just do a one scene in it.
And I said yes.

136
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.740
And I did a scene with somebody else who's in disguise,

137
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.400
who's actually super famous and I'm,

138
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:12.590
I'm actually hearing really good things about that thing.

139
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.060
But fucking radio guys like to break my balls about it.
Like I called up,

140
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.020
uh,
WBCN in Boston,
touch her enrich show,

141
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.380
morning show,
touch.
It was breaking my balls about it.
You know,
people see it.

142
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.920
It's,
it's a red flag.
You know,
you got a movie called Xom beavers.

143
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:34.070
They start looking at you like,
Bill,
did you fucking,
did you blow a guy in this?

144
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:38.840
Did you do a little bit of porn?
Um,
but whatever.

145
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.530
Uh,
so those are the two,
but black or white comes out January 30th.

146
00:08:42.531 --> 00:08:44.300
I know I'm whoring myself out right out of the gate,

147
00:08:44.301 --> 00:08:47.090
but if you guys would go see,
it'd be really,
really important.
It's a great movie,

148
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:47.924
great story.

149
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.890
And a lot of these kinds of movies don't get made anymore because nobody pays

150
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:54.710
for movies anymore,
which is why movies,

151
00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:59.711
either they have like a fucking $500,000 budget or a 500 million because they're

152
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.320
either like not going to invest a lot of money anymore,

153
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:08.000
or they're going to try to make something like those transformers superhero

154
00:09:08.001 --> 00:09:11.840
fucking movies because they're betting on the fact that you're going to be like,

155
00:09:11.841 --> 00:09:15.620
well,
I gotta go see that at the theater.
Um,

156
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.240
I dunno.
I Dunno how the whole fucking thing works out.
But you know the deal,

157
00:09:20.241 --> 00:09:22.970
everybody steals everything now.
People put the fucking money up.

158
00:09:22.971 --> 00:09:26.720
So who knows what I'm sweating when it's,
this is the Monday morning podcast.

159
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.360
Um,
let's see what the fuck happened this week.
Now this is the off week,

160
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:38.710
the fucking off week between the AFC and NFC championship games and uh,

161
00:09:40.131 --> 00:09:43.580
and the Superbowl.
So,
you know,

162
00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:45.350
there's never anything to talk about.

163
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.440
So this week they had the whole stupid deflate gate thing,

164
00:09:48.441 --> 00:09:51.620
which I don't even really want to talk about it.
It was so fucking stupid.

165
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.370
You know what I mean?
It was almost like ESPN should have got sued.

166
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.260
<v 0>Okay.</v>

167
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.850
<v 1>Oh,
whatever.
You know,
you're not supposed to cry.</v>

168
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.120
Like you're not supposed to yell fire in a crowded movie theater.

169
00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.250
That's literally what they were doing.

170
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It was the stupidest fucking the cultural loss by 38 God damn points.

171
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.870
You know,
it's funny,
some guy on ESPN,
one of those science guys actually uh,

172
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.890
you know,
did this whole scientific experiment thing,
um,

173
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:24.320
to see if uh,
I'll actually post this video and I always say this,

174
00:10:24.321 --> 00:10:26.900
but this time I actually will to see if it was an advantage.

175
00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:29.630
It actually turned out to be a slight disadvantage.

176
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:34.580
The ball got there like a split second later and they said it was enough for a

177
00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:37.850
defender to get a fingertip more in the way of the path of the ball.

178
00:10:37.851 --> 00:10:42.560
I mean it was so fucking stupid.
I swear to God,

179
00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:47.240
man.
I'm trying to come up with the theory here.
I just think

180
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.620
generally speaking,

181
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:53.070
people are sick of the Patriots and they fucking hate bill Belichick.

182
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.760
And I know right now that you guys are going to roll your eyes and whatever.

183
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.520
I understand that you like,
well this guy's a fucking patriots fan.

184
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:01.380
I don't want to hear it but we'll just hear me out here.

185
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.560
This is what I love about bill Bellacheck is even in the press conference after

186
00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:10.710
the game and the press conference before his next game,

187
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.690
it's already part of his game plan.

188
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.470
Everybody always sits there and they talk about how he's so boring.

189
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.080
I hate listen these fucking idiots on sports radio.

190
00:11:19.081 --> 00:11:23.580
They tried to say that he's a joy list man cause he just goes up there and

191
00:11:23.581 --> 00:11:26.490
they'd be like,
hey you got,
you got Seattle coming up for you know,

192
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.030
well what do you think about them yet?
You guys are favored.

193
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.390
Do you think you can beat him?
And I'll just be like,
oh yeah.
All right.
Yeah

194
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.530
I know their work kind of work cut out for ourselves.

195
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.030
He would do that if you were playing like the fucking Tampa Bay Buccaneers and

196
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:48.530
other great team.
I know it's going to be a tough game.
Got Out,

197
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.470
work cut out for us.
He knows what he's doing.
Okay.

198
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.120
Because sports

199
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.870
<v 2>media,
they're,
they're lazy.
They're pieces of shit.</v>

200
00:11:57.871 --> 00:12:00.210
And they fucking take whatever you say.
And they only,

201
00:12:00.211 --> 00:12:04.230
they only fucking take a clip of it and they twisted it around and his bulletin

202
00:12:04.231 --> 00:12:09.020
board material for the other team or creates a fucking controversy and,

203
00:12:09.021 --> 00:12:10.270
and distraction and the locker room.

204
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.260
So he gives them nothing so they don't like him.

205
00:12:13.261 --> 00:12:15.900
So they're looking to take the piss out of him.
You know who the media loves,

206
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.820
they love a guy like Rex Ryan.

207
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:19.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

208
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.540
<v 2>Who's gonna fucking come up and just be like,
we're gonna win the Super Bowl.</v>

209
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.950
I wrote it on a bus,
right,
right there.

210
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:31.951
Rex Ryan will write 16 articles for you in one fucking one press conference.

211
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:35.860
He's going to give you your whole fucking season.
And as a writer,

212
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:38.260
you don't even have to work.
You just put your feet up.
All right?

213
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:40.240
Either he does it and he's like,

214
00:12:40.241 --> 00:12:44.410
Babe Ruth calling the home run shot or re sales and we get to take the piss out

215
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:49.150
of him.
Done Bill Pella check gives them nothing.
We make some fucking work.

216
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.690
It makes them actually watched the Goddamn game.
Um,

217
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.330
that was the biggest non fucking story I've ever heard.

218
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.970
And uh,
you know,
I'm over here.

219
00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:05.910
I went on a New York post.com and I saw how Richard Sherman was kind of

220
00:13:05.911 --> 00:13:06.744
mentioning,

221
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.840
trying to suggest that we have this fucking special relationship with the

222
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:11.650
commissioner.

223
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.830
I love how people just can't see the dirt bags shit that they're doing.

224
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:19.840
Do you know the Seattle Seahawks?
I've had the most people test positive for,

225
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:24.460
for performance enhancing drugs since 2011,

226
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.560
including Richard Sherman who also tested positive.
And then he said,

227
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.300
oh,
it was a banned substance.
And uh,
I took a sip off of,
of,

228
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.290
of another player's drink,
you know what I mean?

229
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.250
And uh,
I sipped it.
I didn't know it was in there.
So he got out of it.

230
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.900
Now I'm going to choose to believe them.
Okay.

231
00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:48.610
A Fike ain't choose to believe him.

232
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.430
Why can't he give us the fucking benefit of the doubt?
Really?

233
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.730
That's why it's in there.
You took a sip of your buddies drink.

234
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:56.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

235
00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.470
<v 2>Who fucking Mister Blonde,
who then did the time for you?</v>

236
00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.520
And he did it like a man is going to come in here

237
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.550
and decide on of the fucking blue,
um,

238
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.010
give me a fucking break.
Okay.

239
00:14:13.011 --> 00:14:17.340
Seattle Seahawks with that Goddamn stadium that makes it dead.

240
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.450
Their crowd sound louder than it is.

241
00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:24.451
Is that cheating your own fucking coach who got busted so bad in the NCAA,

242
00:14:26.541 --> 00:14:30.920
they actually took a championship away from the guy and this is the fucking

243
00:14:30.921 --> 00:14:35.660
thing.
I'm not a Seahawks fan.
It,
I don't give a fuck about any of that shit.

244
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.240
I don't give a shit of Richard Sherman was hurt.

245
00:14:38.241 --> 00:14:40.700
He did a fucking cycle to get through it.
I don't give a fuck.

246
00:14:40.701 --> 00:14:44.030
I think they ought to be able to do it.
I said that our bill,

247
00:14:44.031 --> 00:14:47.570
Martha fucking NFL players ought to be able to take steroids and the other

248
00:14:47.571 --> 00:14:49.520
people smoke weed after the fucking game.

249
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:54.010
They gotta be able to heal up their and fucking,
you know,
smoke a little weed,

250
00:14:54.011 --> 00:14:55.210
take away some of the pain.

251
00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.630
And there's actually arguments out there that say in the medicinal purposes of

252
00:14:58.631 --> 00:15:00.730
the fucking drug could actually,
you know,

253
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.880
combat Alzheimer's and this new study saying that,

254
00:15:03.881 --> 00:15:05.080
I don't know if it's fucking true,

255
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.950
but I just think if you're going to like beat the shit out of your body,

256
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.820
these fucking Adonises that with two fingers could throw me across the room in

257
00:15:15.821 --> 00:15:20.821
their twenties and in their forties couldn't fucking beat me in a foot race,

258
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.470
you know,
across a fucking hotel lobby.
I mean,

259
00:15:26.471 --> 00:15:29.830
I just feel like these guys,
the damage that they do to their bodies,

260
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:30.900
<v 0>okay.</v>

261
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:35.100
<v 2>It shortens their lives and the quality of life that they're going to have when</v>

262
00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:35.934
they are alive.

263
00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.350
Like I really think that they ought to be able to like steroids or it's almost

264
00:15:40.351 --> 00:15:45.180
like medicine.
I Dunno.
That's just my feeling.
Hey,

265
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.780
you want to build a fucking stadium that makes you crowd louder than it is.

266
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.510
That's not against the rules,
but it's kind of a,
what the fuck.

267
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:56.750
Considering that Seattle was unbeatable at home and was pretty fucking human on

268
00:15:56.941 --> 00:16:01.680
the road for a couple of years now.
I still don't even give a shit about that.

269
00:16:01.681 --> 00:16:02.401
And as far as that,

270
00:16:02.401 --> 00:16:06.660
Pete Carroll breaking all those fucking rules to the point that they took away a

271
00:16:06.661 --> 00:16:09.030
Heisman trophy,
Hannah national championship,

272
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.260
do you know all sneaky Pete

273
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:17.630
<v 1>fucking sitting there telling Mark Sanchez Sanchez that he was leaving college</v>

274
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:20.780
too soon and then all of a sudden the NCA Hayes at the front door and he sneaks

275
00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:24.560
out the back door like a fucking rat and abandoned all those goddamn kids that

276
00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:25.220
you know,

277
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.160
he told when they signed their scholarships that he wasn't fucking going

278
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:31.610
anywhere.
He saved his own ass and he ran out the back fucking door.

279
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.180
And you know what?
That's division one college football.

280
00:16:35.181 --> 00:16:37.700
That's how it's fucking done.
I don't give a fuck.

281
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.600
I look at Pete Carroll like he just,
he got caught.

282
00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

283
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:46.160
<v 1>You know,
he might've been a little worse or a little less.
Who the fuck knows?</v>

284
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.610
But just the way it works,
the way it fucking works.

285
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:51.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

286
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.250
<v 2>So the same way you defensive back grabs a handful of Jersey and then the</v>

287
00:16:55.251 --> 00:16:59.090
announcer's go,
hey,
you know,
if you can get away with it,
you know,
good for you.

288
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.450
It's the same fucking thing.
So you've got all that shit going on.

289
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.060
This is what kills me to Seattle is actually going to be riding into the

290
00:17:05.061 --> 00:17:08.930
Superbowl wearing the white hat,
which is fucking hilarious to me.

291
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:10.480
<v 0>Okay.</v>

292
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.930
<v 2>Cause they're just as filthy as anybody else,
including the fucking patriots.</v>

293
00:17:13.931 --> 00:17:15.550
Give me a fucking break.

294
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:16.630
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

295
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.060
<v 2>Do you realize these people who actually sit there and call the Patriots</v>

296
00:17:19.061 --> 00:17:19.451
cheaters,

297
00:17:19.451 --> 00:17:24.451
do you realize that's your entire fucking argument is based on Eric Mann,

298
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:29.380
Jeanie and fucking gym or say,

299
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:35.390
okay.
Not exactly the most upstanding citizens.

300
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.690
I know I've talked about Jim or say before,
but I'll talk about the guy again.

301
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.240
That guy could not beat the fucking patriots.

302
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:43.610
His team could not beat the Patriots 10 years ago.

303
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:48.470
We fucking manhandled is Seavers during this game.
He bitched about it.

304
00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:51.360
Peyton manning about it to the refs after the game,

305
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:55.140
the wrestle like whatever it was illegal.
The fucking pro bowl comes along.

306
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.550
Peyton manning is still bitching about it after the Superbowl or say,

307
00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:03.670
and they make a fucking tape and they send it to the league and the league goes

308
00:18:03.671 --> 00:18:06.750
to Patriots did nothing wrong.
That is legal.

309
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.200
Jim Irsay sat on the rules committee and the very next year,

310
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.910
the way the Patriots were covering the fucking colts was now suddenly illegal.

311
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.350
And after five yards you couldn't touch him and you just had to escort him down

312
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:22.590
the field.
And they had Peyton manning in his prime.
Well guess what?

313
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:27.330
The colts beat the Patriots and then they won a super bowl.
Is that cheating?

314
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.040
Is that gamesmanship?
And as far as the spy gate thing goes,

315
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.450
there was a league wide memo telling everybody to stop doing it.

316
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:38.480
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

317
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

318
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.650
The stop having a fucking camera man standing down there on the sidelines in

319
00:18:42.651 --> 00:18:45.590
front of all the fans.
They told everybody to stop doing it.
Eric Mann,

320
00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:48.500
genie fucking built his resume doing that shit.

321
00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.840
Oh Jesus.
Somebody just rang the door.
Am I going to get in trouble here?

322
00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.430
<v 1>What happens?
She'll give me a fucking break.</v>

323
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.490
So the Patriots get caught and then all of a sudden they question their entire

324
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.830
fucking,
uh,
legacy.

325
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.060
<v 0>Okay.</v>

326
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:02.301
<v 1>Oh,</v>

327
00:19:02.301 --> 00:19:06.170
and then meanwhile we go off and win like fucking 13 games every God damn year

328
00:19:06.171 --> 00:19:08.060
for the rest of the fucking time.
And then people like,
well,

329
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.220
you didn't win a Superbowl.
And it's like,
oh yeah,

330
00:19:10.221 --> 00:19:11.660
that has nothing to do with our defense.

331
00:19:11.661 --> 00:19:14.230
It has to do with the fact that we weren't fucking filming people can be a God

332
00:19:14.231 --> 00:19:16.100
damn break because I'll tell you this right now,

333
00:19:16.101 --> 00:19:20.450
if just filming the other team got you a god Damn Dynasty,

334
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.000
every fucking team in the league would still be doing it and they'd be just

335
00:19:23.001 --> 00:19:26.210
doing it right up from the coach's box.
There's no camera with the zoom on it.

336
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.900
And if you think people aren't fucking doing that now,
stealing goddamned signs.

337
00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.610
Absolutely they are.

338
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.630
<v 2>Hang on a second.
There's somebody here.
Hold on,
hold on,
hold on.
Hello.</v>

339
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.080
<v 0>Hello.
Oh,
hey.
Room service.
All right.</v>

340
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.140
Set it down like that with the title.

341
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.760
<v 2>All right.
You just put it right down on the table right here.
Right here.</v>

342
00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:47.660
This table.
This table.

343
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:49.790
<v 0>Yeah.
Beautiful.</v>

344
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.510
<v 2>I'm sorry about that.
There you go.
You liked that.</v>

345
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:58.460
That was actual room service captured on a podcast.

346
00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.630
Um,
so whatever,
all you guys out there,
all you patriots haters,

347
00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:05.090
you can run out of you.
You guys can run your miles all you want.

348
00:20:05.091 --> 00:20:09.890
I don't give a fuck.
Okay.
Your team's doing shit too.
Okay.

349
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.690
I love how only we get questioned about that stuff.
The saints were taken out,

350
00:20:14.691 --> 00:20:19.610
bounties on other players.
Does anybody questioned their super bowl title?

351
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.090
I don't.
You know,

352
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.280
did you guys see Fran Tarkington losing his mind?

353
00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:31.170
He's still talking about Superbowl nine when he showed up and he talked to his

354
00:20:31.171 --> 00:20:33.540
linemen.
Was it stu void as that?
What's the guy's name?

355
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.270
It's like a hall of Famer and he's looking over at the Steelers and he's looking

356
00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:38.070
at looking at the vikings and he just goes,

357
00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:41.280
how come it's so much bigger than we are?
It turns out later,

358
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:43.200
like 90% of them were on Roids,

359
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:48.090
including Terry Bradshaw who admitted that he was on roids.
Does anybody

360
00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.570
<v 1>questioned the fucking super Steelers or the seventies no.</v>

361
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.900
So go fuck yourself if you're going to be sitting here talking about Goddam

362
00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:01.160
balls that weighed like fucking half a fucking whatever the fuck it was that

363
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.093
minute.

364
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:07.050
Unbelievable deflate gate.
And by the way,

365
00:21:07.051 --> 00:21:09.840
can we stop putting gate at the end of everything?

366
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.990
That was funny in like the 1980s with the Iran Contra and somebody called it a

367
00:21:13.991 --> 00:21:16.830
Ron gate.
And ever since then everything is gate.

368
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.680
It's just like fucking hacks come up with a better God damn joke.

369
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.330
So there you go,
everybody.
All you fucking country.

370
00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:24.930
We were on Twitter and you're trying to say that.
Uh,

371
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.190
<v 3>okay.</v>

372
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:27.780
<v 1>You know the Patriots have bunch of cheaters.</v>

373
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.650
I see through everything he is saying.
You're saying you're sick of losing to us,

374
00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.580
but get used to it because Tom Brady still has another three,
four years left.

375
00:21:35.581 --> 00:21:37.790
Now can we get on to talk to talking about the Super Bowl?

376
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.000
<v 3>Okay.</v>

377
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.400
<v 1>She's arguably the greatest fucking matchup gone.
Oh,</v>

378
00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:46.200
you know what made a fucking great point about the Patriots?
Colts think,
um,

379
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:47.603
<v 3>okay.</v>

380
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.330
<v 1>I did another fucking stain on the God damn table.</v>

381
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:56.960
Sorry man.
I gotta clean this fucking table.

382
00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:01.080
Got Dan was so fucking gross fucking rose.
Anyways,

383
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:05.550
it's going to be a great guy damn game.
Um,
I still,
Seattle should be favored,

384
00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.460
but every mouse breeding moron in Vegas is going to see Brady and Bella check.

385
00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:10.680
So they put their money over there.

386
00:22:10.681 --> 00:22:14.010
So then Vegas has got to adjust the line to get money on both sides of the ball.

387
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:18.090
It's the same old fucking story.
But um,
I actually liked it.

388
00:22:18.091 --> 00:22:22.540
This whole stupid deflated footballs things came out.
Um,

389
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.720
I think that's going to work to our advantage.

390
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.600
<v 3>MMM.</v>

391
00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.490
<v 1>Nah.
Maybe if we played this Sunday,</v>

392
00:22:30.491 --> 00:22:32.980
I think by next Sunday it's going to be pretty much fucking over.

393
00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.030
<v 3>MMM.</v>

394
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.440
<v 1>I'll be looking for some silly stupid signs from dumb fans all painted in green.</v>

395
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.760
You know,
the Seattle fans will have signs talking about the Patriots,

396
00:22:44.761 --> 00:22:47.820
like the cheaters and a knit.
No point will it dawn on them.

397
00:22:47.821 --> 00:22:51.570
Why they don't sound even remotely is loud in a different stadium.

398
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.930
They'll blame it on the fact that half the place is filled with fucking patriots

399
00:22:54.931 --> 00:22:56.280
fans.
Well,
do the math.

400
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.920
He should at least be half as loud as you are on your stadium,

401
00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:04.080
which you're not going to be,
because down there in Arizona,

402
00:23:04.081 --> 00:23:05.910
it's just a regular old stadium.

403
00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.260
So there you go.
That's my whole take on that type of thing.
And,
uh,

404
00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:15.960
here's the deal.
If we play the fucking Superbowl in Seattle,

405
00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:18.540
beats us and they do some dumb shit,

406
00:23:18.541 --> 00:23:22.260
like fucking the flight the ball a little bit,
you know,
and we lose by 38.

407
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.970
Okay.
Give me a fucking break.
I will sit there and be like,
wow,

408
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.150
the Seattle Seahawks just kicked her fucking ass.
That's what I would say.

409
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.050
But you know,
that's not how the fucking world works,
isn't it?

410
00:23:34.051 --> 00:23:36.210
When you get fucking for 24 hours,

411
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:37.543
<v 3>mmm.</v>

412
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:43.040
<v 1>24 hour,
uh,
sports channels,
it's a fucking lead story on CNN.</v>

413
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:44.430
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

414
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.240
<v 1>Give me a fucking break.
So</v>

415
00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:50.770
<v 0>anyways,
what,
what do I think about the Superbowl?
I have no,
I mean,</v>

416
00:23:50.771 --> 00:23:53.500
I think on paper the fucking sea hawks win.

417
00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.760
<v 1>I think defense wins championships as they always say,</v>

418
00:23:57.761 --> 00:24:01.150
and they have the better defense and a monster defense.

419
00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:06.890
Um,
I love that defense.
I think,

420
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.733
uh,

421
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.490
<v 0>okay.</v>

422
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:14.490
<v 1>And I think it's way easier to shut down to patriots' offense than it is to beat</v>

423
00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.360
Seattle's defense.
And I think our defenses is good,

424
00:24:19.361 --> 00:24:22.690
but it's not as good as Seattle's and what I look at it.

425
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.140
I just feel like that's going to be the difference.
Um,

426
00:24:26.141 --> 00:24:31.141
we're not good at stopping the run and they have Marshawn lynch and a Russell

427
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.350
Wilson as obviously looking pretty human after the last game,
but I mean,

428
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:39.640
maybe just had a bad game,
but,
uh,
that guy's mobile is hell.

429
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:42.220
And so we're always seeking as all teams,

430
00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:45.160
we're going to have to have one guy just sitting there babysitting him the

431
00:24:45.161 --> 00:24:48.970
entire fucking game.
But,
uh,
they don't have the greatest receivers.

432
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.070
I Dunno,
but I still,
you know,
if we can't get any pressure on the quarterback,

433
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:55.490
<v 0>yeah.</v>

434
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.820
<v 1>I swear to God.
So I don't know.
Uh,
I just think on paper we lose,</v>

435
00:24:58.821 --> 00:25:00.470
but for some reason I have a good feeling.

436
00:25:00.471 --> 00:25:02.180
For some reason I think we're gonna win.

437
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:06.740
That's probably just me as a patriots fan,
but,
uh,
this is really a Superbowl.

438
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:10.000
I have no fucking idea.
Um,

439
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.900
I have no idea about,
but I got this feeling that it's going to be a classic.

440
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:19.550
I really hope it is.
Um,
I don't want to see a boring one,
but here's the thing.

441
00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.930
I don't know if I'm even going to be able to see it live.
I think I'll be live.

442
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.711
We'll do it live.

443
00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:28.940
I think I'm actually flying to New Zealand when the fucking game is on and it's

444
00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:32.630
a five hour flight.
They better have some fucking TVs on there,

445
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.990
man.
I screwed up book in this tape.
This fucking,

446
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.250
<v 0>yeah.</v>

447
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.210
<v 1>Toro when I did,</v>

448
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:42.380
how the fuck did I know the paths were going to be in this God damn Superbowl.

449
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:43.900
<v 0>Okay.</v>

450
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.080
<v 1>Remember that when they lost to the fucking chiefs,</v>

451
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:50.850
now everybody's acting like they didn't fucking say that they were done.

452
00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.000
I was convinced they were done.
I thought,
uh,

453
00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.620
you know,
I just felt like it,
you know,

454
00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:03.150
we just kept getting rid of veterans didn't want to pay their last contract and

455
00:26:03.151 --> 00:26:07.560
we just were getting slowly weaker by the season.
I totally bought into it.

456
00:26:07.561 --> 00:26:09.840
So I'm a surprises anybody that were there.
So that's it.

457
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.660
I won't talk anymore about that shit.
So anyways,

458
00:26:12.661 --> 00:26:14.970
I'm over here in Australia and uh,

459
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.570
today Lo and behold is a Australia day.

460
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:24.960
I don't know why.
I don't know what it is.
If it's their independent day,

461
00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:28.710
I don't know that,
you know,
I don't know a fucking thing about Australia.

462
00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:33.990
I know they have a very similar,
um,
history to the United States in that,

463
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.710
you know,
they had some English come over here,
right?

464
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:41.130
And then there was people already here.
So that was a problem.

465
00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:46.480
And they dealt with it in a,
that,
uh,
centuries later,
you know,

466
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:51.160
musicians and shit with guilt would write songs.
She didn't,

467
00:26:51.161 --> 00:26:55.600
they out where the ribs are broke,
right.

468
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:59.110
The time has come.
You remember that guy?

469
00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:04.140
He said the time has come to save fair's fair to pay the rent to pair a pair

470
00:27:04.481 --> 00:27:09.070
share and then the any,
let's give it back.
Wham,
wham.
Wound

471
00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.850
give what back the fucking land and then what you get,

472
00:27:13.851 --> 00:27:17.160
you going to displace fucking 9 million people.
I mean,

473
00:27:17.161 --> 00:27:18.490
fucking people in this country.

474
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:19.640
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

475
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.473
<v 1>Silver.</v>

476
00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:21.290
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

477
00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:23.690
<v 1>You know,
it's a terrible thing that happened.</v>

478
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.650
Just give him casinos like we did and you get on with your lives.

479
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:32.000
So anyways,
I have no idea what Australia Day is.
Um,

480
00:27:32.001 --> 00:27:34.310
I could probably look it up here for you if you want to.

481
00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.450
You already heard from service,

482
00:27:35.451 --> 00:27:37.560
you want to listen to me fucking type here anyways.

483
00:27:37.561 --> 00:27:39.740
It's say basically they celebrate Australia.

484
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:41.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

485
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.970
<v 1>I kind kinda think that they could've come up with a better fucking name in</v>

486
00:27:43.971 --> 00:27:44.900
Australia Day.

487
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:46.420
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

488
00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.550
<v 1>Hey,
it's USA day.
Yeah.</v>

489
00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.620
It's not attached to anything but whatever.

490
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.150
I got to respect that everybody gets a day off,
which is great.
And on a Monday,

491
00:27:56.151 --> 00:27:57.080
which is even better.

492
00:27:57.081 --> 00:28:01.640
So you get a three day fucking weekend and then everybody kind of boozes it up.

493
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:03.320
We've got out here to pursue,

494
00:28:03.321 --> 00:28:08.321
you know what I saw too fucking El Camino looking cars that I haven't seen like

495
00:28:09.531 --> 00:28:10.364
a,

496
00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:10.930
<v 0>yeah,</v>

497
00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:12.940
<v 1>I don't like,
I don't,
it wasn't made by Chevrolet,</v>

498
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:18.460
but what was fucking hilarious is that both people were fucking kind of doing

499
00:28:18.461 --> 00:28:21.880
burnouts and driving like assholes.
So it's nice to see that,

500
00:28:21.881 --> 00:28:24.250
that that made me feel like I was home.
Oh.

501
00:28:24.251 --> 00:28:27.550
Like a guy with a ratty haircut driving a fucking El Camino looking car.

502
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

503
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.140
<v 1>All right.
Here we go.
Uh,</v>

504
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.480
Australia Day is the official official,

505
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.400
the official national day.

506
00:28:36.401 --> 00:28:39.070
So that's how I read my fucking brain is ahead of my goddamn mouth.

507
00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:40.420
Australia Day,

508
00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:44.950
Australia Day is he official national day of Australia,

509
00:28:44.951 --> 00:28:49.180
yet a celebrated annually on the 26th of January.

510
00:28:49.181 --> 00:28:54.181
It marks the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the first fleet of British ships

511
00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:59.260
at Porch Action,
New South Wales and raising of the flag,

512
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:04.060
the flag of Great Britain at that site by Governor Arthur Phillip.

513
00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:07.610
By the way,
that reference,
do you have a flag that's um,

514
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.520
Eddie Izzard who was actually on my flight.
Um,

515
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.980
and I want to say a lot of them cause I'm a huge fan,
but I don't know,

516
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.200
I just felt like I was going to be bugging him so I didn't,

517
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:18.820
he's actually over here right now.

518
00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:21.820
Thank God not playing the same city that I'm playing or I wouldn't have sold any

519
00:29:21.821 --> 00:29:22.654
tickets.

520
00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.860
I'm in present day Australia celebrations reflect a diverse society and

521
00:29:26.861 --> 00:29:30.670
landscape of the nation.
Nice.
Nice.

522
00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.800
See how they wiggled their way out of that.

523
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.720
Cause I was just saying the indigenous people here,

524
00:29:35.721 --> 00:29:40.030
it must not be thinking January 26 was the great fucking day in their history.

525
00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.520
So now they've kind of moved it around.
It's kind of a,
you know,

526
00:29:43.521 --> 00:29:48.190
the diverse society that we live in.
You know,
we live in doors and,
uh,

527
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.080
you live outdoors in the a outback,

528
00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.950
or maybe you sit around playing a fucking Didgeridoo on the street corner in

529
00:29:54.951 --> 00:29:59.150
Sydney.
Um,
family events,

530
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.000
reflections on Australian history,

531
00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.210
reflections on Australian history.
Hey,

532
00:30:05.211 --> 00:30:07.310
you probably shouldn't have killed all those people.
Uh,

533
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:11.030
officially official community.
And I'm not judging you guys.

534
00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.360
You Ozzie people.
Okay?
We get the same fucking history and worse.

535
00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:18.830
Imagine if you did that and then you added slavery,
and then,
uh,

536
00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:22.940
then you let a select group of people take over your food supply and turn it

537
00:30:22.941 --> 00:30:26.870
into poison,
right?
And then everybody gets addicted.

538
00:30:26.871 --> 00:30:30.140
And then years later you yell at the fat people on a show called the biggest

539
00:30:30.141 --> 00:30:31.550
loser.
You know what?

540
00:30:31.551 --> 00:30:35.030
They finally came out with the fucking article talking about how dangerous that

541
00:30:35.031 --> 00:30:38.360
show is.
Uh,
me and Nia used to watch that all the time.

542
00:30:38.361 --> 00:30:40.740
And I used to sit there saying,
they're going to fucking kill somebody.

543
00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.990
Somebody is going to die.
I don't work out this hard ever in my fucking life.

544
00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.630
And,
uh,
you know,
I'm not 400 pounds over fucking weight,

545
00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:53.390
but they were talking,
they did this whole article on it,

546
00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.740
talking about people fucking up their joints and having a really,

547
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:03.700
really bad problems and afterwards and putting the weight back on and the diets

548
00:31:04.131 --> 00:31:04.970
that basically,

549
00:31:04.971 --> 00:31:09.971
the amount of calories that they give them is like really dangerous and all this

550
00:31:10.461 --> 00:31:13.610
shit that you obviously knew when you watch the fucking show.
But um,

551
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.280
<v 0>okay.</v>

552
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.690
<v 1>Uh,
one of the funniest things was,
uh,
something,
I can't even fucking remember.</v>

553
00:31:19.691 --> 00:31:23.170
What the fuck was I just thinking of Jesus Christ.
I mean,

554
00:31:23.171 --> 00:31:26.650
this is the usual me out of my mind and I'm beyond fucking jetlagged.

555
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.353
Um,

556
00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:30.040
<v 0>yeah.</v>

557
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.160
<v 1>Oh,
I know they said like really over the top main stuff.</v>

558
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.800
Like you're not going to see your daughter's 12th birthday and is mean is that

559
00:31:38.801 --> 00:31:40.180
is it's actually true though.

560
00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:44.690
You can't walk around some of this shit they were doing.
There was one guy,

561
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.280
I was actually jealous of him,
you know,
not that he was fat,

562
00:31:48.281 --> 00:31:53.281
but just the fact I would love to have done what he did every day.

563
00:31:53.381 --> 00:31:57.730
He fucking had like three quarter pounders with cheese and like three large

564
00:31:57.731 --> 00:32:01.210
fries for lunch and a giant coke.
You know,

565
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.300
I know that you would feel like shit afterwards,

566
00:32:04.301 --> 00:32:07.600
but just think of how awesome that would be as you are consuming it.

567
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.860
When you felt that rush of salt and sugar,

568
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:16.630
just sending your mood and everything else
through the fucking roof.

569
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.270
That's one of those things where you just start rocking back and forth.

570
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:20.920
By the time you get into the third one,

571
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.830
you've already drinking half a gallon of soda.

572
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.220
He started like humming songs that didn't even exist before.
You know,

Anybody can go and get some fake boobs rubbed in their fucking face.

714
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:48.520
Okay.
Is he drink a drink with the fucking umbrella in it?
You know,

715
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:52.840
I'm not saying don't do that.
All right.
Definitely do that and have a good time.

716
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:56.350
But you know,
he should also be talking to her,
you know,

717
00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:01.720
a Porsche.
You always showing up.
She ain't gone today while Rhonda in a Ferrari.

718
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:04.750
You could do something like that.
Um,
all right.

719
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.640
I apologize for that awful fucking,
just awful.
Everything in general,
the content,

720
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:12.100
where the hell is it?
Come on man.
Come back to me.

721
00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:17.980
It's time for the content and you won't show it to me.
All right,

722
00:41:17.981 --> 00:41:20.140
here we go.
Wait,

723
00:41:20.141 --> 00:41:23.530
was there anything else I want to talk about before I got into the emails before

724
00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:27.270
I got real light,
before I got into the emails?
Uh,
Oh,
you know what I,

725
00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.640
when I was on the plane ride over,
um,

726
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.760
I,
uh,
you know,
I,
I watched that movie Lucy,

727
00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:40.820
that was a movie that I wanted to see in,
um,
and the theaters.

728
00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:43.560
It just kind of came and went and I didn't hear the greatest things about it.

729
00:41:43.561 --> 00:41:48.420
I got to tell you for a rental,
it's,
it's not bad.
It's not a bad movie.
You know,

730
00:41:48.421 --> 00:41:52.560
you got that,
that big pouty lips,
a Hardy's,
you know,

731
00:41:52.561 --> 00:41:55.020
she's running around whatever fucking name is

732
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:59.460
Sebastian Bach.
What the fuck is her name?
She's got one of those names.

733
00:41:59.461 --> 00:42:04.290
Set the chick.
It's like the CIC version of Sebastian Bach.
Right?

734
00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:08.890
What is her name?
Aniston.

735
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:16.000
It's a really beautiful now.
Anyway,
she's in it and uh,

736
00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:20.020
uh,
they got some good bad guys.
They got like some Asian mob guys.

737
00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.330
Those guys are always call,
you know what I mean?

738
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:26.980
I fucking cut their finger off if they do something bad for their boss.

739
00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:31.360
I've always liked that.
I've always liked the,
uh,
the Italian mob thing.

740
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:35.950
I've always liked that.
And,
uh,
the Asian mob guys,
you know what I mean?

741
00:42:35.951 --> 00:42:38.350
Cause the Asian mob guys always combine like fucking,

742
00:42:38.351 --> 00:42:39.550
not only can they shoot a gun,

743
00:42:39.551 --> 00:42:42.520
but then they always added the martial arts shit in there with fucking knives

744
00:42:42.521 --> 00:42:44.350
and spin this stuff around.
You know,

745
00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:46.810
that's what I like about the Asian mob before they whack you.

746
00:42:46.811 --> 00:42:50.980
They have the decency to put on like a show,
like,
like murder,

747
00:42:50.981 --> 00:42:55.690
Cirque de Solei,
right?
Torture,

748
00:42:55.691 --> 00:42:58.840
Cirque,
Cirque de Solei,
whatever the fuck it is.
I actually watched that.
And then,

749
00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:04.570
you know,
I still had another like five hours on the flight.
And,

750
00:43:04.571 --> 00:43:09.150
um,
I listened to a sergeant peppers,

751
00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.530
the whole fucking album,
which I hadn't listened to and so long.

752
00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:17.520
That is one of the greatest fucking albums of all time.

753
00:43:17.521 --> 00:43:19.950
And this is kind of this backlash by younger people.

754
00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.820
They tried to say the Beatles are overrated.
Um,

755
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.200
and all I'm gonna say is,

756
00:43:25.201 --> 00:43:30.180
I just feel bad for you guys because I had never heard j Dilla until he died.

757
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:35.240
And I follow Questlove on Twitter and he did some sort of link and I kinda got

758
00:43:35.671 --> 00:43:36.504
into that guy.

759
00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.500
And if you actually listen to the sergeant pepper with all the shift that they

760
00:43:40.501 --> 00:43:44.100
got going on in the background,
crowd noises and all that,

761
00:43:44.101 --> 00:43:46.850
and he's crazy sounds and all of that,
you almost see like the,

762
00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:51.840
these elements of what j Dilla was doing on that album like fucking 40 years

763
00:43:51.841 --> 00:43:56.580
before.
It's absolutely fucking amazing album.
But anyways,
so we were flying,

764
00:43:56.581 --> 00:43:58.690
right?
And as always,
I use all my miles when I,

765
00:43:58.691 --> 00:44:01.890
I got a really long flight like this.
And uh,

766
00:44:01.891 --> 00:44:06.891
so we were riding up front like big shots and this woman was up front.

767
00:44:08.011 --> 00:44:10.830
These two women were sitting next to each other and in front of them they had

768
00:44:10.831 --> 00:44:11.664
two little kids.

769
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:14.970
And then there was another little kid and these kids would run an all all the

770
00:44:14.971 --> 00:44:16.740
fuck way around.
And,
um,

771
00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:21.630
is there anything worse than seeing a parent whose kid just doesn't even listen

772
00:44:21.631 --> 00:44:25.650
to them?
It's like seeing a coach that like lost the locker room.

773
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.890
The kid can't get in up.
The kid was getting up.
We was still taking off.

774
00:44:28.891 --> 00:44:29.724
Like we were still,

775
00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.770
we were still ascending to our cruising altitude and,
um,

776
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:39.240
this,
she'd be like,
she'd go,
Hey,
I told you to sit down.

777
00:44:39.241 --> 00:44:40.640
And he would just look at her,
nod her head,

778
00:44:40.641 --> 00:44:43.920
and they continue to fucking run around.
And um,

779
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.340
I dunno,
she looked over me at one point.
I just gave her this fucking look like,

780
00:44:49.341 --> 00:44:52.250
uh,
I dunno what it was.
I was annoyed

781
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:53.480
<v 0>okay.</v>

782
00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.301
<v 1>As a kid kept,
you know,</v>

783
00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:57.270
running by and that bumping into you and the kid was old enough to not be cute

784
00:44:57.271 --> 00:44:59.220
anymore.
You know,

785
00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:04.060
it was just old enough where I was considering tripping him when he went by.

786
00:45:04.061 --> 00:45:07.780
He was like,
Dad,
age,
what does that age like six,
seven years old,

787
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.900
not seven,
seven.
He can talk to them.
It's like,
look,
foreign entity,

788
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:17.160
you don't lay your hands on them between four and six,
you trip.
Um,

789
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:18.870
and then after that age,

790
00:45:18.871 --> 00:45:21.360
you just look at him like you sit them down like a person you like,
dude,

791
00:45:21.361 --> 00:45:26.130
what the fuck's wrong with you?
All right.
Is that good parenting?
Um,

792
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:30.960
anyways.
Uh,
all right,
let's get to the fucking questions here for the week.

793
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.473
What the hell are they?

794
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.940
<v 0>Okay,</v>

795
00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.500
<v 1>I'll tell you.
It's cool being at the airport,
man,</v>

796
00:45:36.501 --> 00:45:40.340
now that I'm actually flying and all this shit that I looked out the window and

797
00:45:40.341 --> 00:45:43.970
I never fucking understood.
I'm actually seeing what runway we're on,

798
00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:49.520
what taxi way we're on and I'm figuring out why we're still holding their,

799
00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.470
you know,

800
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:54.770
it was pretty fucking cool cause it was a horrible weather,

801
00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.310
just gloomy and that type of shit.
So,
um,

802
00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.540
the fucking,
the,

803
00:46:01.541 --> 00:46:05.140
a tower had like all this traffic lined up and we were just sitting there and my

804
00:46:05.141 --> 00:46:06.750
wife's going like,
you know,
how come,
why not leave?

805
00:46:06.751 --> 00:46:11.050
And when I leave and I'm looking out the window and I think I was able to call

806
00:46:11.051 --> 00:46:14.680
it like when,
when he was going to let us go.
Um,

807
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:16.250
<v 0>okay.</v>

808
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.570
<v 1>I don't know.
I can't wait to get back to that.</v>

809
00:46:17.571 --> 00:46:20.540
I got six more lessons and then I actually take my,

810
00:46:20.541 --> 00:46:25.490
I had my check ride and a,
I can't fucking wait.
I can't fuck it.

811
00:46:25.491 --> 00:46:28.190
I'll be a major fucking accomplishment if I actually get that thing.

812
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:29.121
I gotta be honest with you.

813
00:46:29.121 --> 00:46:34.121
I brought my notebooks and all that shit to study and I'm just fucking pretests

814
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.360
on the Internet and uh,
I dunno,

815
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:42.870
you got to get a 70% and my school tries to get you up to like 90.
And um,

816
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:47.570
I,
I'm all over the map.
I'm 85 90 on some shit and other stuff.
I'm in the 60s,

817
00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:48.880
but I'm no lower than the 60.

818
00:46:48.881 --> 00:46:51.560
So I figured out this the next three weeks as I'm out on the road,

819
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:55.580
I'll just try to do an hour and a half every fucking day.
Um,
anyway,

820
00:46:55.581 --> 00:46:59.480
so probably bored the shit out of you,
but I don't care.
All right.
Be The match.

821
00:46:59.481 --> 00:47:02.780
Everybody,
uh,
Billy MD,

822
00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:08.260
I'm a 45 year old female whose son survived from a rare form of bone marrow

823
00:47:08.331 --> 00:47:11.650
cancer because of be the match.org.
Uh,

824
00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.710
be the match.org was something that I,
I,
uh,
mentioned joining,

825
00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:20.690
um,
a couple podcasts ago,
case you weren't listening.
So anyways,

826
00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:25.220
I was driving to work and listening to your podcast and when you mentioned this,

827
00:47:25.221 --> 00:47:28.270
I almost started screaming for joy.
Uh,

828
00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.900
we near the first who ever listened to my podcast who considered screaming for

829
00:47:31.901 --> 00:47:35.380
joy unless I was saying,
well,
that's the podcast for this week.

830
00:47:35.381 --> 00:47:38.150
Then they usually like,
oh,
thank God it's over.
Um,

831
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:42.610
we were told that he would have a very hard time qualifying to be a donor.

832
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:43.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

833
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:48.880
<v 1>Because of certain factors.
You mean getting a donor?
Um,</v>

834
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.210
very hard time.
Yeah.
To be a donor,
I think.

835
00:47:53.211 --> 00:47:56.780
You mean qualify getting a call,
a match,
I should say.
Anyways,

836
00:47:56.781 --> 00:47:59.930
we stayed positive and after a year and a half,
a donor match was found.

837
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:03.650
The match was a young man in his late twenties who had heard about be the match

838
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:08.270
and decided to enter,
uh,
decided to register on a whim.

839
00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.550
Thank you so much for mentioning it on the podcast.

840
00:48:10.551 --> 00:48:14.000
My husband and I often question why programs like this aren't mentioned in

841
00:48:14.001 --> 00:48:18.920
bigger forums,
uh,
be at 60 minutes or the state of the Union address.

842
00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:23.720
I don't know anyone who wouldn't help someone save someone's life if they could

843
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:28.520
the donor or as we refer to him as superman had heard about this from a friend

844
00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:32.570
at a dinner party,
attending that dinner party in turn saved my son's life,

845
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:36.350
which means that you can be part of saving someone's life to just by having

846
00:48:36.351 --> 00:48:38.520
mentioned it,
uh,

847
00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:42.710
I'm welling up just writing this email and I know your listeners are usually

848
00:48:42.711 --> 00:48:46.460
writing in about psycho women and sports,
but if you happen,

849
00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.780
if you do happen to read this,

850
00:48:47.781 --> 00:48:49.940
I just want you to know that it means the world to watch.

851
00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:53.450
He says this too fucking nice for me to read.
Um,

852
00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.810
too many competencies to reiterate what you mentioned on the podcast.

853
00:48:56.811 --> 00:48:59.660
The test is literally just swapping,

854
00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:04.490
I think swabbing your cheek with a Qtip,
not swapping it cheek.

855
00:49:04.491 --> 00:49:07.700
That would be a,
some face off shit.
Uh,

856
00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:11.480
with the Qtip they send you and putting it in a mailbox.

857
00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:14.780
If you happen to match with someone in the registry,

858
00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.980
they contact you and you have the option of saving someone's life.
Fuck this.

859
00:49:18.981 --> 00:49:23.630
I'm doing this.
I gotta do that.
Jesus Christ,
uh,

860
00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.760
be the match.org.
Everybody.
How about you do that?

861
00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:29.570
Why don't you guys go out and do that thing and then the next time you spouse,

862
00:49:29.571 --> 00:49:31.790
your girlfriend or your boyfriend gives you shit.
Like,

863
00:49:31.791 --> 00:49:36.650
what are you been doing all day?
What have I been doing?
Save and fucking lives.

864
00:49:36.651 --> 00:49:41.340
Lady or Buddy live women say to they guys,

865
00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:45.620
you fucking asshole.
All right.
Got Drunk.
Said some things.

866
00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:51.020
Wow.
Got Drunk.
Said some things that I write this a dear bill.

867
00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:55.190
I am what many people have called a habitual line crosser.
Ah,

868
00:49:55.191 --> 00:50:00.191
the classic Charlie Murphy Line from the Rick James Sketch.

869
00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:03.830
Uh,
I am a habitual line crosser.
When I drank last night,

870
00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:08.360
I was out with some coworkers and my boss.
Oh No,

871
00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:13.640
at a brewery festival.
Oh,
geesh.
All right.

872
00:50:13.641 --> 00:50:15.500
What do you guys guessing here?
Um,

873
00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:20.220
probably told his boss he didn't know what he was doing and if his boss was

874
00:50:20.221 --> 00:50:23.760
female,
he probably made a pass at her.
What do you guys go going with?

875
00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.340
Did he say something dumb or did he grab somebody's ass?

876
00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:31.380
<v 2>Anyways,
I ended up getting,
fuck,
I ended up getting fucking rocked.</v>

877
00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:35.340
It told my boss to her face.
Oh my God,
she's a female.
Here we go.

878
00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:39.330
I am willing to lose my job to sleep with you.

879
00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:43.050
That's actually kind of funny.

880
00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:49.050
He said she laughed and blushed at the bold statement and proceeded to leave

881
00:50:49.051 --> 00:50:53.210
almost directly after this.
Oh,
now,
oh,

882
00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:57.980
you set it to the wrong person.
Uh,
you said it to the wrong person.

883
00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:03.040
I'm writing this to you on Sunday morning and have to report to the old fucking

884
00:51:03.351 --> 00:51:04.880
clock puncher tomorrow.

885
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:09.680
I have no shame addressing sexual tension with the woman,
but my boss,

886
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:11.023
fuck me.

887
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:16.060
My plan is to just carry on like it never happened because honestly I don't care

888
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:22.660
and see how she responds with either a not addressing it and keeping me

889
00:51:22.851 --> 00:51:25.130
employed,
be filing sexual harassment,

890
00:51:25.131 --> 00:51:29.510

And he writes,
yeah.

891
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:34.220
C Filing,
sexual harassment,
losing my job and not sleeping with me,

892
00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:39.140
Bu uh,

Fuck yeah.

893
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:43.340
What's your,
what's your take on all of this?
Um,

894
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:46.970
I don't have a take on it cause you have to give a shit.

895
00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:48.290

I love the sexual tension.
What your sexual attention.

899
00:52:03.381 --> 00:52:05.060
It doesn't seem like she had any,

900
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:11.790
you kind of just looking at this from your own perspective.
Um,

You have no guilt whatsoever.

Now they're DSC.
These guys are feeling themselves.

can someone please tell me when races gets so damn expensive?

926
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.160
Have I been asleep for the last 20 years?

927
00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:01.040
I was in a store one day and one of the packs of razors cost 20 bucks and it's

928
00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:05.010
only one pack people.
That's absolutely nuts.
All right.
But you know,

929
00:54:05.011 --> 00:54:08.150
sometimes they actually give you a free deck,
a free deck of freak,

930
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.510
a free gift when you buy their overprice raises,

931
00:54:12.511 --> 00:54:15.600
which is actually just a punched in the Dick.
Dude,

932
00:54:15.601 --> 00:54:18.060

933
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:21.660
And then I try and riff and then I'm thinking like,
just get to the dick part.

934
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:26.190
That's the joke.
Give you a free deck.
They give you a free deck.

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:04.310
just want to say huge fan of your standup podcast.

994
00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:05.530
<v 3>Okay.</v>

995
00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:10.090
<v 2>All right,
so I am 21 years old and in the military living in England,</v>

996
00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:14.290
I just got here two months ago and have a girlfriend back home in the states who

997
00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:16.000
I've been with for about a year and a half.

998
00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:18.640
And you've already met someone who wants to bang you over there cause you got an

999
00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:22.120
accent and a military haircut and you've been doing pull ups and you're in the

1000
00:58:22.121 --> 00:58:25.150
prime of your life,
right?
That's what I'm guessing.
She's a great girl.

1001
00:58:25.151 --> 00:58:29.280
Tall Brunette has a fucking rock and body.
Hell Jesus.

1002
00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:33.400
And this is sweetheart with a good family.
A good Lord Dude.

1003
00:58:33.401 --> 00:58:38.080
If all of that is true,
I would rub one out in England for a while.
Um,

1004
00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.710
I feel like I hit the Jackpot and we are working on getting her over here.

1005
00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:47.380
Uh,
which would mean we would have to be married.
I want to do it,

1006
00:58:47.381 --> 00:58:49.210
but at the same time,
whenever we talk about it,

1007
00:58:49.211 --> 00:58:53.350
I get nervous as fuck and this weird feeling in my gut holding me back.

1008
00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:57.490
I don't know if that's normal cold feet or what.
I feel like if I dumped her,

1009
00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.530
have you making a huge mistake,

1010
00:58:59.531 --> 00:59:02.980
but at the same time I don't want to get married and wake up two years from now.

1011
00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:07.330
Angry that I wasn't single living overseas and could have had the time of my

1012
00:59:07.331 --> 00:59:11.440
life.
What would you do in my situation?
She's the mother of my kids

1013
00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.333
material.

1014
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:14.993
<v 3>What</v>

1015
00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:20.670
<v 2>but not sure if we're too young.
Oh,
she's the mother of my kids material,</v>

1016
00:59:20.671 --> 00:59:23.580
but not sure if we're too young.
Thanks and go fuck yourself.

1017
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:31.010
I don't know how old you,
I sound like a young,
I would address this with her.

1018
00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:32.230
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1019
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:33.490
<v 2>I don't know.
Is that bad advice?</v>

1020
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:38.870
I think every guy fucking has cold feet freaks the fuck out.

1021
00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:40.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1022
00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:42.640
<v 2>And it's just like Jesus Christ,
what the fuck am I doing?</v>

1023
00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:47.140
What the fuck am I doing?
Cause women get married.
It's just like,

1024
00:59:47.141 --> 00:59:50.680
there's such an advantage to it.
You know,

1025
00:59:50.681 --> 00:59:54.010
the way the divorce laws are set up,
like they're there for the most part,

1026
00:59:54.011 --> 00:59:57.400
they're not going to lose unless they're making more money and then they gotta

1027
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:59.350
be nervous,
I would think.

1028
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:01.310
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1029
01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:03.380
<v 2>But also,
I think just in general,
they're there.</v>

1030
01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:08.210
They believe in that romance stuff and all that Shit.
What would you do?

1031
01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:12.520
<v 3>I don't know,
man.</v>

1032
01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:17.910
<v 2>That's a fucking rough one.
And all of a sudden it's a rough one,
you know?</v>

1033
01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:23.660
Do you love her?
You know what I mean?

1034
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:27.020
If you love her and you don't want to lose her,
I got to tell you.

1035
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:29.023
Um,

1036
01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:30.710
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1037
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.300
<v 2>you won't regret marrying her.</v>

1038
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:33.860
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1039
01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:34.693
<v 2>Alright.</v>

1040
01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.480
Occasionally you'll be pissed that you didn't crush all that ass over there and

1041
01:00:39.481 --> 01:00:42.780
you're going to the bathroom and you'll rub one out and the second year rub one

1042
01:00:42.781 --> 01:00:46.200
out.
You gotta be like,
Ah,
you know I made the right fucking choice.

1043
01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:47.773
<v 3>All right.</v>

1044
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.670
<v 2>I Dunno.
You 21 years old or do you,
you're not going to get married at 21.</v>

1045
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.130
Here's the deal.
Just tell you want to be with her.
Be Not ready to get married.

1046
01:00:57.131 --> 01:01:02.030
You're only 21 years old.
That's what I would do.
See,

1047
01:01:02.031 --> 01:01:02.990
I don't want to be married yet.

1048
01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.840
I'm only 21 I want to experience my twenties a little bit.

1049
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.940
What do you mean fuck somebody else?
Yeah,
no.

1050
01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:11.410
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1051
01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:12.850
<v 2>Dude,
you're only 21 years old.
Okay.</v>

1052
01:01:12.851 --> 01:01:14.830
If just fucking woman Ari wants to get married,
I mean,

1053
01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:18.550
I think it's normal to 21 to fucking not want to get married.

1054
01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.470
Just say,
look,
let's get married around like 26 what is the rush?

1055
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:27.680
Let's be single and fucking enjoy ourselves,
but like be together,
whatever.

1056
01:01:27.681 --> 01:01:30.560
I would go down that road.
Um,

1057
01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:34.630
oh Jesus,
you're not.

1058
01:01:34.631 --> 01:01:37.870
Sometimes you guys ask me these life changing fucking questions and I got to try

1059
01:01:37.871 --> 01:01:41.800
to weigh all options here.
I don't want you to get rid of the love of your life.

1060
01:01:41.801 --> 01:01:44.350
And I also don't want to fucking have you locked down at 21.

1061
01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.980
It's going to come down to use their fucking private.

1062
01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:49.510
You're going to have to figure this one out.

1063
01:01:50.530 --> 01:01:51.363
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1064
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.560
<v 2>But uh,
yeah,
I would,
I would start with that.
See if he can,
oh,
I see.</v>

1065
01:01:57.561 --> 01:02:01.020
To get her over there.
You'd have to fucking marry her to,

1066
01:02:01.021 --> 01:02:06.000
that's not a reason to merrier.
I would do the long distance relationship thing.

1067
01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:12.000
Um,
I don't know what the fuck I would do.
All right.
Sorry.

1068
01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:15.150
I did my best.
If anybody has any advice for this kid,

1069
01:02:15.151 --> 01:02:17.880
just fucking write in next week and I'll,
you know,
if that makes sense.

1070
01:02:17.881 --> 01:02:21.140
I'll read it.
All right.
And knowing father-in-law,
dear bill,

1071
01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.840
I'm a pretty well rounded guy.
All right.
All right.

1072
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.620
Fucking right out of the gates.
Guy's patting himself on the back.

1073
01:02:28.070 --> 01:02:30.890
I'm not a complete stiff,
but I'm also not a flake.

1074
01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.830
Wait a minute,
dude.
Those are both bad things.

1075
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:38.343
<v 0>You know,</v>

1076
01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.740
<v 2>I'm not a jerk,
but I'm also not an asshole.
I'm not a complete stiff.</v>

1077
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:44.990
We're also not a flake.

1078
01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:53.210
Ah,
well that doesn't make any fucking sense.
Anyways,
I have my shit in order.

1079
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:55.490
When you work hard to have your life together,

1080
01:02:55.491 --> 01:02:59.000
the last thing you want is someone telling you stuff you don't need to hear

1081
01:02:59.001 --> 01:03:01.190
about when you supposed to be doing

1082
01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:05.820
or what you're supposed to be doing with your life and money.

1083
01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:07.270
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1084
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:12.130
<v 2>My father in law is this person in my life.
All he cares about is the market,</v>

1085
01:03:12.131 --> 01:03:15.250
stocks,
bonds,
mutual funds,
Iras.

1086
01:03:15.251 --> 01:03:17.590
He actually wrote box instead of bonds.

1087
01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.340
All he talks about is watching his money grow and how I should be saving

1088
01:03:21.341 --> 01:03:23.410
everything so I can live rich when I'm older.

1089
01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:27.400
The thing is I do save aggressively.
I'm doing just fine.

1090
01:03:27.401 --> 01:03:30.910
Recently I booked a trip to Greece to surprise my wife for our third wedding

1091
01:03:30.911 --> 01:03:34.840
anniversary on our first date.
She said she always wanted to go to Greece.

1092
01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.470
I told her she get there within five years.

1093
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:41.830
That was just under five years ago though.
Hey,
you're the man of your word.

1094
01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:45.340
It seems like I can't claim through clutch here.

1095
01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:48.550
Her father on the other hand said it was not the right time because of the

1096
01:03:48.551 --> 01:03:49.450
exchange rate,

1097
01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.960
safety of traveling abroad and anything else he could throw in there.

1098
01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:54.340
How do I respond to him?

1099
01:03:54.341 --> 01:03:59.200
Do I laugh it off and just wait till he talks shit again and again and live with

1100
01:03:59.201 --> 01:04:00.190
it.
Who would I put him,

1101
01:04:00.191 --> 01:04:04.000
pull him aside and let them know I don't want to hear this his shit anymore.

1102
01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.140
Thanks.
I would do both.
I would experimenting with laughing it off.

1103
01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:10.051
Yeah,
at first.

1104
01:04:10.051 --> 01:04:13.860
And if he keeps coming at you at some point you just got to take them aside,

1105
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.113
<v 0>you know,</v>

1106
01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:22.340
<v 2>and just be like,
listen,
um,
I would actually talk to you,</v>

1107
01:04:22.341 --> 01:04:23.420
my uh,

1108
01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.440
your wife about it first just to tell her that you're going to do it just in

1109
01:04:27.441 --> 01:04:30.080
case he comes at her with his fucking story of like,

1110
01:04:30.081 --> 01:04:33.080
I was just trying to help it.
I think he just brow beaten me.

1111
01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.010
I would just say he just said to your wife like,
listen,

1112
01:04:37.011 --> 01:04:40.430
I know your father means well,
but,
uh,
you know,

1113
01:04:40.431 --> 01:04:43.790
he's always talking to me about my finances,
our finances and that type of thing.

1114
01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:46.760
All right.
I know he's very smart with money and that type of thing,

1115
01:04:46.761 --> 01:04:50.930
but I also feel like I'm smart with money in my own way.
All right.

1116
01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:52.490
And,
uh,

1117
01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:56.690
I've saved my money and we can afford this and where young and you're beautiful

1118
01:04:56.691 --> 01:05:00.200
and you want to go to Greece and I'm taking it because I love you.
All right?

1119
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:03.410
But I gotta be honest with you,
if your dad keeps opening is Yep.

1120
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:07.760
I'm going to fucking shove a dinner roll in it.
Are we cool?
All right.

1121
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:11.210
What are we watching tonight?
Real housewives.

1122
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.990
Are we going to watch the little sports?
Whose night is it?
There you go.

1123
01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:17.970
And then you were up,
but at some point,
yeah,
you got to sit down.
If you do have

1124
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.900
<v 1>an,
uh,
an annoying person like that in your life,
you really do.</v>

1125
01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:25.940
You got to sit down with them and you have to do it.
Uh,

1126
01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:29.370
I do it in our restaurant.
Take them out to lunch,
you know,

1127
01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:35.180
so there's no option for any screaming and yelling and I'm just lay it on the

1128
01:05:36.991 --> 01:05:41.820
light.
You just got to say to them that,
listen,
you know,

1129
01:05:41.821 --> 01:05:44.400
I love your daughter more than anything in the world and you have to know that

1130
01:05:44.401 --> 01:05:48.390
I'm going to take care of her.
All right?
And then it'll be all right,

1131
01:05:48.391 --> 01:05:48.930
right off the bat.

1132
01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:51.780
You catch them off guard because he knows it's a fucking deep conversation.

1133
01:05:52.350 --> 01:05:57.270
He wasn't ready for it.
You're ready?
All right.
And just say,
listen.
Um,

1134
01:05:57.930 --> 01:06:02.340
I know you're concerned about a wellbeing.
Of course you are.
You're a great debt.

1135
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:04.023
All right?

1136
01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:09.380
But I am saving money and we're going to be fine.

1137
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:11.880
I just do it a little bit different than you.

1138
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.620
Your daughter has always wanted to go to Greece and I would rather take her now

1139
01:06:16.621 --> 01:06:21.510
in the primer for life.
Then bring her over there when we're both,
you know,

1140
01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.260
walking around with dentures and Keynes.
Okay,

1141
01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:29.580
I want her to enjoy this before we have kids and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1142
01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:31.890
And this is what I'd like to do and I need you to respect that.

1143
01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:37.920
And I appreciate your comments about our finances,
but I would,

1144
01:06:38.130 --> 01:06:42.630
but I would,
I don't,
ah,
how do you say this part?
I would just say,
listen,

1145
01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:46.140
I will come to you cause I know you know what you're doing.
But if I,

1146
01:06:46.141 --> 01:06:50.460
if I am having a problem financially,
which I am not,
but if I am,

1147
01:06:50.461 --> 01:06:55.110
you are the first person I will come to with advice.
Okay.
Until then,

1148
01:06:55.590 --> 01:07:00.300
I don't want to hear another fucking word.
Fucking do it.
Smooth it out.

1149
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:03.750
It's basically what you do.
All right.
So that's the podcast for this week.

1150
01:07:03.751 --> 01:07:07.110
Everybody.
Um,
I got my first show tomorrow night,

1151
01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:12.130
um,
here in Perth.
I'm really looking forward to it,
man.

1152
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:17.190
I'm going to put my hour together out here and looking forward to all the people

1153
01:07:17.381 --> 01:07:21.880
that I'm going to see a comic set I'm going to meet and that type of shit.

1154
01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:25.510
And it's going to be insane.
Sorry going be insane.

1155
01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:28.930
Going through Australian into New Zealand.
But when I go into Southeast Asia,

1156
01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:33.500
I'm experienced in those cultures.
It's just going to be unreal.
Like in China,

1157
01:07:33.501 --> 01:07:36.560
you had this great interview,
um,

1158
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.800
with the guy for those other Hong Kong Gig,
and he was mentioning how Hong Kong,

1159
01:07:41.801 --> 01:07:44.170
you know,
that there's,
they're basically their own deal,

1160
01:07:44.171 --> 01:07:49.030
the other one constitution and shit.
But in mainland China as he called it,
like,

1161
01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:54.250
do you know,
he said recently the,
they,
they banned puns.

1162
01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:57.400
They banned puns and wordplay in the media,

1163
01:07:57.850 --> 01:08:00.550
which I know everybody else is probing in a laugh.
Like,
oh,
that's silly,

1164
01:08:00.551 --> 01:08:02.230
you can't make a pun.
But you know,

1165
01:08:02.231 --> 01:08:06.100
humor is a great way to take the piss out of the fucking people that are in

1166
01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:07.820
power.
Um,

1167
01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:12.780
and it's a clever way to do it where you can't quite get busted for it.

1168
01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:17.410
And,
um,
unless got a psycho,
which maybe they do,
but whatever,

1169
01:08:17.411 --> 01:08:21.130
but it's a way to kind of make your point and stay out of jail and start a

1170
01:08:21.131 --> 01:08:24.730
movement or whatever.
So they've banned that type of thing.
And I guess to,

1171
01:08:24.731 --> 01:08:29.731
Comedians in China are pushing the boundaries of what is allowed on stage.

1172
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:35.680
And what is amazing to me over there is that in China,
the standups over there,

1173
01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.770
that art form,
which I think eventually it will go global.

1174
01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:45.750
It's really weird that that art form has not the fact that music,
you know,

1175
01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:50.760
acting and,
and all these uh,
film all pictures,
painting,

1176
01:08:50.790 --> 01:08:53.430
all the other arts are worldwide,

1177
01:08:53.431 --> 01:08:58.140
but stand up one of the great arts,
I feel that there is,

1178
01:08:58.141 --> 01:09:02.100
is not worldwide and it's like brand new essentially in China.

1179
01:09:02.101 --> 01:09:04.170
And what's so fascinating,
mainland China,

1180
01:09:04.171 --> 01:09:08.970
what's so fascinating to me is that they are actually pre Lenny Bruce over

1181
01:09:08.971 --> 01:09:11.220
there.
You know what I mean?

1182
01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.440
Like I look at these other places where they can actually talk and I'm like,

1183
01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.210
it's exciting to me cause it's like,
all right,

1184
01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:19.160
they're going to have their Richard Pryor,

1185
01:09:19.161 --> 01:09:20.630
they're going to have their George Carlin.
They're saying,
yeah,

1186
01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:24.070
can you send or whatever.
And uh,

1187
01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:25.960
<v 0>okay.</v>

1188
01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:30.220
<v 1>You know,
these,
these guys are actually in China are like,</v>

1189
01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.260
they're waiting for their Lenny Bruce to come along,

1190
01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:35.640
which is pretty amazing to me.
And,
um,

1191
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:39.760
I also can't imagine living in that type of oppression,

1192
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:43.930
how that would affect the comedy,
um,

1193
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:48.060
on just like a whole other level,

1194
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:52.080
like just listening to Richard Pryor and

1195
01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:53.300
<v 0>okay.</v>

1196
01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:56.180
<v 1>What he ended up talking about because of what he went through.</v>

1197
01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:00.470
I can't imagine over there.
I don't know.
It's just like a different thing.

1198
01:10:00.471 --> 01:10:03.350
Like there's that whole fucking experience living in a fucking country with is

1199
01:10:03.351 --> 01:10:07.640
like what does that three to 4 billion fucking people or something like that or

1200
01:10:07.641 --> 01:10:08.990
a billion people they got over there.

1201
01:10:08.991 --> 01:10:12.410
I just can't imagine how you would try to stand out over there.

1202
01:10:12.411 --> 01:10:14.930
And then he got this oppressive fucking thing where people got to stand in front

1203
01:10:14.931 --> 01:10:19.790
of tanks and shit.
And I know there was like 25 years ago,
but um,
I dunno.

1204
01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:21.060
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1205
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:24.450
<v 1>Um,
I think it's going to be really interesting too.
I'm hoping that some comics,</v>

1206
01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:25.890
when I go to Hong Kong,

1207
01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.610
some Chinese comics will come out and I'll get to talk to them and find out

1208
01:10:29.611 --> 01:10:30.880
about that because the guy was actually going to,

1209
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:35.730
would you actually do a Gig on main in mainland China?
And I was like,
no,

1210
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:41.550
I wouldn't because I don't know how to fucking,
I've been a free man.

1211
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:44.460
So I wouldn't know how to reign that in.
I mean,

1212
01:10:44.461 --> 01:10:46.500
I've done corporate gigs and try to tone it down,

1213
01:10:46.501 --> 01:10:50.790
but I wouldn't trust myself to not blurt out something that would then,

1214
01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.300
and I'd end up,
God knows what,
haven't I?

1215
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:58.880
Somebody call a fucking embassy over a shit show.
I mean I don't,
I,

1216
01:10:58.930 --> 01:11:00.920
I couldn't handle that cause the guy was going,

1217
01:11:00.921 --> 01:11:04.520
do you have any advice for those kids over there?
And I was like,
no,
I don't.

1218
01:11:04.521 --> 01:11:07.910
Cause I,
I,
I w had a,
uh,

1219
01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:11.540
a privilege standup career where all those walls were already broken down.

1220
01:11:11.541 --> 01:11:16.060
I actually said what I would rather,
I would like to talk to him,
you know,

1221
01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.650
and hear what they're going through.
But,
uh,
hopefully,
you know,

1222
01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:23.620
things open up over there.
Cause I really don't think that any government,

1223
01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.950
if you fucking oppress the people,
it's just,
it's like,

1224
01:11:29.230 --> 01:11:33.700
it can only last for so fucking long before people have had it.
Um,

1225
01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:38.320
so hopefully,
uh,
you know,
Jesus Christ,
I mean,

1226
01:11:38.321 --> 01:11:41.020
you need government and he need fucking rules and that type of shit,

1227
01:11:41.021 --> 01:11:43.570
but you don't got to be taken it to that level.

1228
01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.210
Banning puns and fucking wordplay.
Give me a break.
Anyway,

1229
01:11:47.211 --> 01:11:51.220
so that's the type of shit I'm going to be encountering here on this trip.
Uh,

1230
01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:53.590
like I said,
I'm going to try to watch the Superbowl.

1231
01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:58.360
I figured out when the fuck it is.
I actually left and I forgot to tape it.
Um,

1232
01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.680
so I'm hoping that whatever plane I'm on is going to have the,
uh,

1233
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:07.060
he's going to have the game.
I don't know what.
All right,
I'm babbling here.
Uh,

1234
01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:11.650
go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
And,
uh,
that's it.
I'll see you.
