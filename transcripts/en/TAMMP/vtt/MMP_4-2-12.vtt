1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.670
Okay.

2
00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.810
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on is bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

3
00:00:05.811 --> 00:00:09.500
April 2nd,

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.270
2012 how's it going?
I want to say 2011 isn't that crazy?

5
00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:17.780
For a month.
Then I just did some dumb shit.

6
00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:22.010
I just got up off the couch and I had to close the window because I'm in New

7
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.060
York City right now,
sitting on a couch that I used to own that I,
I,

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.140
I sold to,
uh,
to Joey roses.

9
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.250
You know,

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.250
I don't know what the fuck he did to this fucking thing is a leather couch.

11
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.993
You know,

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.530
the kind of couch that a single man buys a leather couch.

13
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.760
Easy to clean up,
if you know what I mean.

14
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.820
All right.
I don't know what the fuck he did to this thing,

15
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:53.960
but I'll tell you right now,
I'm glad I don't own it anymore because the leather,

16
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.080
the leather has lost its luster.
I asked him,

17
00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:02.750
I'm like,
what the fuck did you do?
The goddamn couch?
What is this?

18
00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:07.580
This stuff on it?
And he's like,
oh,
you're like a sleep in here.

19
00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:12.050
Sometimes in my,
my back sweats.
Fucking disgusting.

20
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.240
Fucking disgusting.
Joe To Rosa back sweat is a,

21
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:22.410
it is an album title for your,
Huh?
The couch is ruined.

22
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.690
Thank God I don't own it anymore.
Um,
anyways,
I'm here in New York City and uh,

23
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:30.690
you know,
I'm back here in New York City where all the real people are.
Right.

24
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.080
That's what I've heard since ever since I moved out to la that this is where all

25
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:37.710
the real people live.
You know,
I just don't like la man.

26
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:39.660
It's just so plastic and phony.
Oh yeah.

27
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.970
It's supposed to all those honest guys down there on Wall Street,

28
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.810
everybody tells you like it's is,
it tells you like it is in New York City.

29
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.720
I just saw this douchebag.
Um,
no,
I wasn't looking in the mirror.
Um,

30
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.910
he had on the tightest fucking jeans ever yet they were still sagging in the ass

31
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.670
and I swear to God,
you know,

32
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.580
they look like those.
Will they,
what are those things called?
Sheen's teens,

33
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.050
one of the tights and and jeans shingles with the fuck did they call those

34
00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:13.930
things that they look like but they were actually real jeans that this fucking

35
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:15.820
idiot.
That's like one of those people.
Right.

36
00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:18.880
And then he gets the shit kicked out of them.
And then then what?

37
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:22.360
You're supposed to feel bad human being to human being.
Yes,

38
00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:27.361
you feel bad but you know there is a such thing as asking for fucking sit there

39
00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:33.871
and jam you God damn man legs into those fucking things and then walk around

40
00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:39.280
with your droopy ass and,
and just think it's,
you know,
Shawn,
what did,

41
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:41.500
what did you think was going to happen if I ever had a kid,

42
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.560
any Eddie's wearing please beat the shit out of me.
Close.

43
00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:47.800
I mean I just can be so fucking hard when he comes home with the shit kicked out

44
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:52.310
of them.
I understand son.
I understand it hurts but you know what,

45
00:02:52.311 --> 00:02:54.630
what did you think was going to happen?
You know,

46
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:57.440
why don't you just wear an itchy turtle neck sweater and I know what you're

47
00:02:57.441 --> 00:02:59.950
thinking out there.
Listening right now.
Probably think,
well,

48
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.820
why can't somebody wear tight jeans that are droopy in the ass?

49
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.500
You can wear them all right.
You just gotta realize we don't live in a utopia,

50
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.990
you know,
I'm not saying I would do it.
I don't do things like that.

51
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:17.530
I just think about doing them.
Like when I was on the plane ride out here,

52
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:19.150
this woman was talking so loud,

53
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:24.151
two rows in front of me and she was in the aisle and I was two rows back on the

54
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:28.240
opposite side aisle and I just wanted to punch her in the mouth like through the

55
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.190
right behind her ear,
you know,

56
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:33.850
and just have my fist come like right through her mouth,
you know,

57
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.210
pushing her voice box and tongue right through the back of her teeth.

58
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.120
It's a violent thought.
I realize it,
you know,

59
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.420
I don't know what the fuck I'm going to talk about it.

60
00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:45.151
I'm not gonna lie to you guys.

61
00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:48.390
I did a bunch of shows this weekend and I boost until like two,

62
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.070
two 30 in the morning with Paul Versey,
New Jersey's own,
Paul Versey,

63
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.430
sometimes a jet fan,
sometimes a giant fan.
You know,

64
00:03:56.431 --> 00:04:00.150
now I'm hanging in New York with the sensation Joe to Rosa.

65
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.860
You know who's who's dressing very dapper lately?
I got to give it to him.

66
00:04:03.861 --> 00:04:06.600
He's dressing very fucking Daba.
Um

67
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.620
Oh fuck.
This is one of these God damn shows.
You know what guys?
Can I just,

68
00:04:12.621 --> 00:04:15.920
can I just erase this and start over again?
You know what the problem is?
This is,

69
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.890
this is one that I would stop and start over again.

70
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.450
I just don't have the fucking time.

71
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:22.543
<v 0>You don't.</v>

72
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.870
<v 1>I got go to the fucking airport,
sit next to a bunch of cunts.</v>

73
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.690
Everybody's a put me in the world.
I don't know what it is.

74
00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:34.530
Why can't people be more like me?
There was it made as lady Gaga.

75
00:04:34.531 --> 00:04:38.370
She looks like she's like some 60 year old woman from eastern Europe.

76
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.070
Doesn't she?
Like she chopped firewood her whole life?

77
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:43.170
That's what her face looks like to me.
You know,

78
00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:46.680
I always wondered why she wore all those mass and then one day she was not mast

79
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.220
and I was like,
oh,
I get it now.
It's not an artistic statement.

80
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.810
She was like a bird that hits somebody's windshield going like 30 miles an hour.

81
00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:58.740
Okay.
That's just fucking me around.
I don't want to beat this guy.

82
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.270
Am I going to be the mean guy
two weeks in a row,

83
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.260
a little firmer.
Last week,
last week I start up,
you know,

84
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:11.760
I've got a little buzz on the Internet people all upset cause I made fun of Bob

85
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.020
Dylan and male breast cancer.

86
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.950
People got really upset by that and I can understand that.
You know,

87
00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:20.160
anything else you got upset by?
I don't understand.
But those two things,

88
00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:23.260
I really understand why you got upset by them.
Uh,

89
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.620
I played a couple of old theaters.
I was in Wilmington,
Delaware,
you know,

90
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.070
supporting Joe to Rosa by going on after I'm doing an hour and a Wilmington.

91
00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:38.550
Delaware is yet another wonderful fucking city.

92
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.530
Beautiful buildings right along the water.
Right.

93
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.050
It's got everything going forward.
But it's one of those,

94
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.950
one of those cities that if 5:00 PM everybody just gets the fuck out of dodge

95
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.030
and all the restaurants close,
you know,
and then,
and then you know,

96
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.490
happens if you like checking into the hotel and it's all fucking regular people

97
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:04.970
walking around
and then you go upstairs,
right?

98
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.850
You eat a little sandwich or something like that.
Do you come down to get dinner?

99
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.970
The whole fucking the whole cities,
like there's nobody there.

100
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.820
Like the second shift of people,

101
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.910
all these Zombie start limping down the Goddamn street and you're like,

102
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:20.120
where the fuck did everyone go on now?
Is this,
is it one of these cities?

103
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.420
That's what I asked people whenever I go to those cities,
like all right,

104
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:27.110
what happened?
Cause you can see in the architecture,
at one point it was,

105
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:30.620
it was a,
it was a wonderful city.
You don't,
things were made,

106
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:35.540
their money was made,
women were fucked,
food was eaten,

107
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.010
right?
Son was watched,
rising and setting.

108
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.560
Everybody stayed there and now everybody fucks up.
So I have,

109
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:47.090
I think it's always one of three things.
Either the factory shut down,

110
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.800
there was a race riot
or,

111
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.790
or there was the flood of 19 whatever,
and they never fucking recovered.

112
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.260
Those are the three things that take out a fucking city.
You know,

113
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:04.130
it was up in Troy,
New York,
same goddamn thing.
Beautiful fucking buildings.

114
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:08.630
You could see it.
This place used to be the place to go,
you know,
I don't know.

115
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:13.340
Back in 1930 what are you taking her?
I'm taking her to Troy,
New York.
God,

116
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:17.900
Jesus.
You're going to get laid tonight,
Troy.
Right.
It's fucking beautiful.

117
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.420
Then I come by,
what,
80 years later,

118
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.270
fucking parties over beautiful buildings.
All I'll board it up.

119
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.560
No one can find the fucking theater and there's just that one old theater and

120
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:33.620
I'm performing there.
Right.
And people always tell you that it's haunted.

121
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.610
Like you're supposed to be nervous.
You know,

122
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.810
I'm not a big fan of ghosts.
I don't respect him.

123
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.410
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

124
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:49.340
<v 1>Kind of like soccer.
I feel the same way about soccer as I do Bob Ghosts.</v>

125
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.020
You know,
I just don't respect the game.

126
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:52.973
<v 0>Okay.</v>

127
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.970
<v 1>Both of them are played by bitches.
Um,
I don't what I'm saying.</v>

128
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:01.090
I was fucking sitting in a sweat on this fucking couch.

129
00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:05.680
No wonder that God damn thing looks so bad.
Oh God,
what can I do here?

130
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.350
Um,
eight minutes in everybody.
It's just,

131
00:08:08.351 --> 00:08:10.870
you know what this is like when you guys come in,
hung over for work,
right?

132
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.660
And he just waiting for the roach coach to show up at 10 15.
You're like,

133
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:16.720
what the fuck is going on with my life?
How did I choose this?

134
00:08:16.721 --> 00:08:21.250
Why am I fucking her?
You know,
you're not going to clear something up.

135
00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:24.910
Some guy wrote into me this week.
You see if I got here,

136
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.170
this guy said,
ah,
Jesus,
what are you doing?

137
00:08:29.171 --> 00:08:32.770
I got this stupid fucking iPad from near these fucking things.

138
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:34.450
<v 0>Okay,</v>

139
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.250
<v 1>now how do I get rid of this thing?
Can I go over this way?
No,
I can't.</v>

140
00:08:39.251 --> 00:08:43.330
That sends a,
all right,
here we go.

141
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.740
Is this right to so I do it.
Steve Jobs,
you fucking cunt.

142
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.810
All right,
Steve jobs as the worst.
Thank God he's gone.

143
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.590
This stupid fucking inventions every three days I got the new thing now.

144
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:00.360
Now you don't.
Here's the next thing.

145
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.260
All right,
really gay question.
Bill.

146
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.790
I'm a gay guy in a fan who was never has never has any problem downloading your

147
00:09:09.791 --> 00:09:12.040
podcast.
Oh Jesus Christ.

148
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.520
I'd send you a free fucking DVD if he gave me a fucking address.

149
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.850
Monte,
you Katsu who just can't I it,
let's get to podcasters to cute download it.

150
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.540
What is with you?
It's not me.
My website is fine.

151
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.400
It's never crashed

152
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:31.961
anyways.
He'd say,

153
00:09:31.961 --> 00:09:35.380
I mentioned that because in the comments every week your listeners seem to think

154
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:40.020
there is some correlation between not being able to download it and being a fig.

155
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.020
Um,
first this Eaton,
they're actually quoting one of my jokes.

156
00:09:44.021 --> 00:09:45.310
If you haven't seen the joke,
okay,

157
00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:49.090
if you think I have a bunch of homophobes I did this bit called what do you

158
00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:53.260
effect?
And it had to do with,
uh,
it was actually anti homophobia,

159
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.380
although some gay people,
the second they hear fag,

160
00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.440
they stand up and yell homophobe and what run out of the room.
Um,

161
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:05.260
I call that a story Seattle.
Um,
anyways,
first,

162
00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:09.640
this email isn't meant at all to get you to censor or to be PC.

163
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.780
I like your stuff a lot.

164
00:10:10.781 --> 00:10:14.410
Your point of view was hilariously balls out and usually different from the same

165
00:10:14.411 --> 00:10:17.080
old comedy cliches.
But I'm curious,

166
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.460
with all the hundreds of things you and your listeners identify as gay,

167
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:26.710
do you really still think most gay guys are the old stereotypes on most sitcoms

168
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.120
and in Leno's monologue jokes out?
Jesus,
you're going to talk down to me,
sir.

169
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:35.050
Is that what it is?
Is that what you're going to do here?
Yeah,
I think that,

170
00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:38.140
I think you all go like the food is hair.

171
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.030
Don't you guys sing everything?
He really rarely.
Of course,

172
00:10:43.031 --> 00:10:48.010
I don't think that it's just funny and not to mention when we say stuff is gay,

173
00:10:48.011 --> 00:10:51.980
it has nothing to do with homosexuality.
Okay.
When you say,
you know,

174
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.830
you like this lamp,
now it's fucking gay.
Why it look at it.
It's just fits gay.

175
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.180
All right.
It just means it's lame staying.
You know what it is.

176
00:11:01.181 --> 00:11:05.320
It just gives you that,
you know,
anything that gives you that feeling of,
um,

177
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.330
it's not love.
I don't know what it is.

178
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.700
Uh,
what I,
you know,
I don't even know what the word is.

179
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.660
What does that fucking word when you're just,

180
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.120
you know,
when you just sitting there,
your girl,

181
00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:26.720
like you take a night off from work and you're sitting there with your girl and

182
00:11:26.721 --> 00:11:29.630
she,
you know,
and she,
you know,
if you,
your rent of a video,

183
00:11:29.631 --> 00:11:34.060
whatever the fuck he do now,
snap your fingers and it appears in your TV.

184
00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:36.470
I'm so fucking far behind a KBS,
an iPad.
I don't know.

185
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:39.320
I don't know what your kids do nowadays.
Back in the door,
you went to a day,

186
00:11:39.321 --> 00:11:41.990
you went to a fucking video store,
all right.

187
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:46.340
And pretended to want to watch a fucking romantic comedy when you really wanted

188
00:11:46.341 --> 00:11:49.490
to walk through those saloon doors and look at the porn off,
right.

189
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.680
That fucking feeling when you come home,

190
00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:56.380
when you're sitting there and you've some food and your girl gets all excited,

191
00:11:56.381 --> 00:12:01.030
it was like,
it ain't nice,
you know,
you know,
it does just enjoying each other.

192
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.050
Whatever that fucking feeling is that's gay.
Okay.

193
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.950
But I don't know what to call that fucking feel.
And to me,
that's gay.
All right?

194
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.800
Now every once in a while I'll look like a fucking chair or a lamp or someone

195
00:12:12.801 --> 00:12:15.460
asks me to do something and I get that same film,
like this fucking gay.

196
00:12:15.461 --> 00:12:19.830
I don't want to do it.
There's nothing to do with gay people.
All right?

197
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.240
So don't get sensitive on me,
sir.
I know you're not.

198
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:25.110
I know this person is not being a dick.
So anyways,
he says,
uh,

199
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.590
do you guys think we're all the gay guys and the old stereotypes of sitcoms or

200
00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:31.360
in Leno's monologue?
Um,

201
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.430
is it because the ladies make you watch dope Hra and the view,

202
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:42.190
the view hags who just love having gay guy girlfriends because they love

203
00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:46.930
emasculating men any frigging way they can.
Oh,
I get this guy.

204
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.220
This guy is a bear.
He's one of those gay guys,

205
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.860
you know the kind of guy you're hanging out with on the construction site.

206
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.980
Somebody picks on you,
right?
And this guy comes to your rescue,

207
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.270
fucking turns them all into a pretzel,
you know,
you're like,
Jesus Christ,

208
00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:05.050
that's a fucking guy's guy.
And then all of a sudden he just sits down and just,

209
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:07.120
just something about the way he's crossing his legs.
You're like,

210
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:10.750
what the fuck is with this dude?
All right.
And then one day he just says,
listen,

211
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.490
I've got something to tell you.

212
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.370
I see what you're saying.
I get it.

213
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.700
That's like me being a German Irish guy and I'm like,

214
00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:24.130
we're not all Nazis and drunks,
but you know,

215
00:13:24.131 --> 00:13:26.260
if you put it on the history channel or if you go on and say,

216
00:13:26.261 --> 00:13:27.670
Patrick Patty's Day,
you know,

217
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.890
you assert your defined by the worst of your group.
Unfortunately,

218
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.190
that's kind of how it works.
Um,
but no,

219
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.430
I don't obviously don't think people like that.
I saw will and grace,

220
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.170
then they have both ends of the spectrum.
We'll was sort of like,
you know,

221
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.530
just a regular guy.
And then the other guy was just like,

222
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.780
oh my God.
Right?

223
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:59.190
Singing my lines.
No,
I didn't.
I thought that that guy was actually good.
Right?

224
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.650
Why do I answer these fucking questions?
You know,

225
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.880
all it does it just expose how fucking stupid I am.
Um,
so anyways,
he says,

226
00:14:05.881 --> 00:14:09.750
so do you still think after seeing the gay soldiers in the news and the boring

227
00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:13.890
normal gay marriage activist?
Dude,
I don't think that nobody thinks that.

228
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.440
I actually,
some people think that.
No,
I don't think that.
All right.

229
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.810
I'm just breaking balls.
They're twinkle toes.
Um,
or the only gay guys.
Why?

230
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.830
Just going to keep reading the rest of this for whatever fucking reason.

231
00:14:22.831 --> 00:14:27.480
Or the only gay guys who have been out to you,
uh,
out to you.

232
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.060
Really just hairdressers and interior decorators.
Sir,

233
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.100
how many examples are you going to give me?

234
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.660
All right.
Pop Up,
up,
up,
up.
Okay.
I'm done with that.
No,

235
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.990
I don't think they were all like that.
All right,
so this is what it's like.
Yeah,

236
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:42.810
I understand that.

237
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:47.810
That some of you guys look like Mike Ditka add a act like Mike Ditka yet.

238
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.980
I don't like Mike Ditka the same reasons I do

239
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.813
<v 0>do what?</v>

240
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.550
<v 1>I understand that.
So I think a lot more people do understand that.
Um,
you know,</v>

241
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.920
yeah,
there's all kinds of stereotypes out there.
All right.

242
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.240
Look for the redheaded male,
you know,
you think I don't want to be a fucking,

243
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:09.790
you know,

244
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:13.580
start an action movie and be the guy who knows every type of karate and kicked

245
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:14.990
the shit out of people and shoot the gun.

246
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:19.910
Do you think they ever going to give that role to a fucking freckled faced
pasty,

247
00:15:19.911 --> 00:15:23.870
redheaded jackass like me?
They're not.
All right.

248
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:25.790
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

249
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:26.750
<v 1>Who am I going to be?</v>

250
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.570
I'm going to be the guy who needs to be rescued or the guy who's good with

251
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:34.340
computers.
All right.
We all got to fucking axe to grind,

252
00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:39.140
sir.
All right,
so maybe you were just checking in,
maybe you just making sure,
um,

253
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.880
you know,
I didn't even get his joke,
a really gay question.
Like,

254
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:46.070
I'm going to say that question was getting,
you see what he's doing.

255
00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:49.280
He was like mocking me and showing a sense of humor at the same time.

256
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:54.010
You see that he was testing my intelligence while flirting.
Um,

257
00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.080
I had a gay question last week.
I said,
what do you call a group of gay men?

258
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.390
This gay guy says,
evidently they're called a giggle.

259
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.210
A group of gay men are called a giggle.

260
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:03.790
<v 0>Okay?</v>

261
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.540
<v 1>No they're not.
There's no fucking good way.</v>

262
00:16:06.541 --> 00:16:10.080
All Gay guys call a group of gay men giggles.
You know who called it?

263
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.080
Douchebags who happened to be gay?
I'm sure that they say that.

264
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:19.320
A giggle.
Go fucking blow someone.

265
00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.253
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

266
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.170
<v 1>Ah,
I swear to God.</v>

267
00:16:28.171 --> 00:16:31.800
If I was ever to have the charisma of a mass murderer,

268
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.230
that's who I would kill Douche bags.

269
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.560
All groups would be allowed to stay around.

270
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.220
But you would have to prove to me that you weren't a douchebag.

271
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.680
And if you then who would you make fun of?
Um,

272
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:50.340
gay men age.
Well,
because they don't have to deal with women.

273
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.050
That was another question I had from last week.
If you guys are wondering,
Oh,

274
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:59.920
this podcast sucks.
It's like fucking 900 grease my whole fucking apartment.

275
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.300
I swear to God,
it just
did.
I look at it during the winter.

276
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.880
I don't know what the fuck it was.
Remember the guy's showing it to me going,

277
00:17:07.881 --> 00:17:10.310
you know,
it's all kinds of light.
A lot of sunlight.

278
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

279
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:14.920
<v 1>It's fucking killing me here.
Hey,
how bout,
how bout a little,</v>

280
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.590
a little bit of a advertising at this point,
everybody,

281
00:17:17.591 --> 00:17:20.170
would you like to hear some advertising?
Sure.
We all would.

282
00:17:20.171 --> 00:17:25.150
stamps.com hey everybody.
Once again,
it's time for me to read this,

283
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.650
the stamps.com I try to make this entertaining every week.
Everybody,

284
00:17:29.651 --> 00:17:32.890
I'm running out of ways to talk about how to get the post office into your

285
00:17:32.891 --> 00:17:35.060
fucking apartment.
All right.

286
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.870
I have been talking about this for weeks at this point,

287
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.770
and if you haven't signed up,
I don't know what your problem is.
Yeah.

288
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.640
What do you like to punish yourself?
Like that guy in that movie about the Bible,

289
00:17:45.641 --> 00:17:48.250
who took that thing and was slapping himself on the back with it,

290
00:17:48.251 --> 00:17:52.610
with the spikes or that guy flogging himself.
Um,

291
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.880
that's when I tapped out of that movie.
The second I saw that guy doing that.

292
00:17:56.881 --> 00:17:58.380
It's like there's no way somebody is doing that.

293
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.880
You know what kind of a douchebag is working for somebody else and beating the

294
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:06.230
shit out of themselves?
Well,
I guess those Japanese guys do that,
don't they?
They,

295
00:18:06.231 --> 00:18:11.190
they fuck up.
They cut their finger off those guys in the Japanese mafia.

296
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.193
<v 0>You know,</v>

297
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.400
<v 1>just knowing that that's something that could possibly happen considering them a</v>

298
00:18:19.401 --> 00:18:22.960
total fuck up.
Why would you ever join that?
Yeah.

299
00:18:22.961 --> 00:18:25.720
Let's say you want to join this group.
You know,
you get a nice clothes,
nice cars,

300
00:18:25.721 --> 00:18:29.380
but a,
if you fuck up,
you gotta you gotta cut your own finger off.

301
00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.520
Hey,
you know what?
They're flashy guy.
When don't you go fuck yourself.

302
00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.220
How about that?
Why don't you go out,
go kill somebody?
Well,

303
00:18:37.221 --> 00:18:40.630
what happens when you fuck up there?
They a kingpin will you cut off?

304
00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.350
You cut off anything.
You Fat.
Fuck.
What'd you have?

305
00:18:44.351 --> 00:18:49.120
Another pork shop thought you guys were supposed to be in shape.
You like that?

306
00:18:49.121 --> 00:18:52.040
That was my little fantasy interview to get into the Yucca,
Masa,

307
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.880
whatever the fuck it's called over there.
I stamps.com everybody,

308
00:18:54.881 --> 00:18:58.150
it's important to look professional to your clients,
customers and partners.

309
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.660
This is the intro they give me.
Who doesn't know that?
Oh,

310
00:19:01.661 --> 00:19:04.720
I thought it was important to look unprofessional.
Evidently people,

311
00:19:04.721 --> 00:19:07.430
when you're in business,
you want to look good.
Look,
let's,
let's,

312
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.670
let's just get down to brass tacks here.
All right.

313
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.430
Nobody likes going to the post office.
You dread it.

314
00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:17.100
It is one step above going to the DMV.
All right?

315
00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.650
You're going to walk in there.
It's just going to be a sea of,

316
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.650
of a word that I can't use when I'm doing an advertisement.
All right?

317
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.600
It begins with C and ends with UNT.
Um,
it's important to look professional.

318
00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:31.960
Placing regular stamps and your letters and packages won't do the trick.

319
00:19:31.961 --> 00:19:36.280
And leaving and leasing a postage meter is just too expensive.
Uh,

320
00:19:36.281 --> 00:19:40.540
take my advice.
Use stamps.com instead.
Yeah.

321
00:19:40.541 --> 00:19:44.110
Why do you want to lease?
What do you want to Lisa?
A postage meter.

322
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.353
<v 0>You know,</v>

323
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.240
<v 1>once again,
you serve in somebody else.</v>

324
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.770
Fuck those guys who lease their meters.
Keep your fucking meters.

325
00:19:53.771 --> 00:19:56.320
This stamps.com you know what they do?
They give you a scale.

326
00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.350
They give you scale plus $110 bonus,

327
00:19:59.351 --> 00:20:04.270
which includes the digital scale and $55 worth of free postage.
All right?

328
00:20:04.271 --> 00:20:07.710
Don't wait.
Go to stamps.com before you do anything else,
do what you can get.

329
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.490
I've been talking about this for weeks.

330
00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.740
You can mail stuff in the middle of the night or at least get it prepared to,

331
00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.090
you know,
after you went to some sort of free porn site,
you're like,
oh,

332
00:20:19.091 --> 00:20:23.680
wait a minute,
I have a letter to mail.
I have a package to way.

333
00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:27.110
You got a little scale.
It's fun.
You're what you feel like.

334
00:20:27.111 --> 00:20:30.250
You feel like you're in kindergarten,
you're playing postdoc office.
You know?

335
00:20:30.251 --> 00:20:32.230
Except it's real.
You know?

336
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.180
Kind of like if you play in a metal of honor and all of a sudden you joined the

337
00:20:37.181 --> 00:20:41.260
military,
right?
You're like,
oh my God,
this is what first person looks like.

338
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.690
This is this is this,
is these,
these,

339
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.700
the post office version of whatever I just gave.
I can't even remember.

340
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:51.260
I'm still getting some fucking heat stroke here.
Anyways,

341
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.380
you go to stamps.com you click on the radio

342
00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:58.381
microphone@thetopofthehomepageandtypeinburburthatstamps.com enter bur bur are

343
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:04.090
you get $55 of free postage in $110 bonus offer,

344
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.870
which includes the 55 bucks in a digital scale.
All right,
there we go.

345
00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:11.230
I got it out of the way,
everybody.
I was that,
that wasn't a bad read was it?

346
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.370
This is one of these weeks where I'm just going to have to read everything and

347
00:21:14.371 --> 00:21:18.310
maybe this will spawn something funny.
It could be out of breath.

348
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:22.600
That's when you know you're bombing on your own podcast,
you know,
um,
hey bill,

349
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.780
this,
this is entitled,
afraid to break up with girlfriend.

350
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.120
I'm going to read slow,
so this takes up as much time as possible.
A bill.

351
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.580
Um,
I'd like to get your advice on something.

352
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.820
I've been dating my girlfriend for almost a year now and I've been thinking

353
00:21:36.821 --> 00:21:41.760
about breaking up with her.
Well,
it's time to break up with their sir.
All right.

354
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.270
Dating Dayton for a year.

355
00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:45.490
You know you have to still even thinking about breaking it.
It's time.

356
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.433
<v 2>Okay.</v>

357
00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:52.770
<v 1>I says we get along fine and we rarely argue.
I was just thinking of a great,</v>

358
00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:57.560
a great way to break up with someone they should invent like a breakup suit,

359
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:58.723
right?

360
00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.790
Just something where you just cannot get injured and you just put the thing on

361
00:22:01.791 --> 00:22:04.880
with the fucking helmet.
You don't wear the helmet,

362
00:22:04.881 --> 00:22:08.240
you just put the ones he zip up on and which totally protects everything.
Right?

363
00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.770
And then you get in the passenger seat and you let her drive.
Oh,

364
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.300
why are you gonna let me drive?
Why did you just drive tonight?

365
00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:20.210
But you always liked to drive honey.
You just drive.
Okay,

366
00:22:20.211 --> 00:22:24.020
why are you wearing that suit?
It's all gonna make sense in about five miles.

367
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.831
Right?

368
00:22:24.831 --> 00:22:29.780
You get out on the fucking highway and he just started talking to her and not
to,

369
00:22:29.781 --> 00:22:34.580
no way.
He just put the helmet on,
you know,
when she says,
what are you doing?

370
00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.510
And just say,
listen,
I didn't want to go out with you anymore.
And then she goes,

371
00:22:38.511 --> 00:22:40.070
what?
And you go,
hey,
watch this.

372
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.700
He just opened the door and you roll out of the fucking car and that's it.

373
00:22:43.701 --> 00:22:48.500
You're out.
You know,
type up a fake police report.

374
00:22:48.501 --> 00:22:50.520
You're telling me you died.
Then she feels bad for you.

375
00:22:50.521 --> 00:22:54.110
You don't have to deal with any sort of repercussions.
Um,
anyways,

376
00:22:54.111 --> 00:22:56.180
he says we get along fine and we rarely argue,

377
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.930
but I'm starting to realize I don't really want to be with her for the long
haul.

378
00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.540
And we started dating,
oh,
this fucking thing.

379
00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.890
It's these iPads suck by the way.
All right.
You know what an Ipad is?
It's,

380
00:23:07.891 --> 00:23:12.210
it's a fucking laptop for pussies.
What's a matter?
You laptop is too heavy.

381
00:23:12.211 --> 00:23:15.780
You fucking douchebag this thing doesn't have a keyboard.
It's got nothing.

382
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.660
You think that they don't know how to make this thing into a fucking laptop

383
00:23:18.661 --> 00:23:20.040
already.
Of course they do.

384
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:24.960
This is this Steve jobs way of doing things rather than just giving you the

385
00:23:24.961 --> 00:23:25.890
whole fucking thing.

386
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.920
He's going to give you 10 inch increments like a God damn drug dealer.

387
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.580
You know I,
that's why I haven't bought one of these yet.

388
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:34.620
This is knee is by the way,

389
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:39.690
borrowed this fucking thing and I am not enjoying it as you can tell is I'm

390
00:23:39.691 --> 00:23:43.530
throwing a temper tantrum here.
You know what?
I'm going to buy a fucking IPAD.

391
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.000
I'm going to buy it when it is a laptop.
When it gives a little light laptop.

392
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.810
Until then I'm not,
I'm not having this fucking this.
This is like a,

393
00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.340
this is like when you,
you know you go,

394
00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.730
I know I really want to get the new Camaro and then you get the one with the v

395
00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:58.820
six engine rather than getting the full out one with the stick shift,

396
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.570
which is a laptop,
right.
It's too heavy,

397
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:04.310
<v 0>you know,</v>

398
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:09.560
<v 1>fucking deuce.
Do Shoulders at the gym next time you do that.
Okay.
Maybe do that.</v>

399
00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:13.040
Maybe to do some stuff to build up your risks.
Oh God.
Bill.

400
00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:16.340
Can you get through the question?
All right.
Uh,
well,
um,
he says,
uh,

401
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.530
when we first started dating,
I loved hanging out with her,

402
00:24:18.531 --> 00:24:22.400
but I'm just not into it anymore.
Does that make me an asshole?
No,
it doesn't.

403
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.920
Why would your own true feelings make you an Asshole,
sir?

404
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:30.380
How awful were your parents?
Um,
he says,
I'm 23 years old with the somewhat,

405
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:34.790
why am I,
you know,
I'm a really being a cunt this week,
guys asking for my advice.

406
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:37.790
Let's just try to bring the anger down.
Bill,
you're frustrated.

407
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.320
It's fucking hot in here.
You can't open the window because you say,
cut too much.

408
00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:44.660
This building's a co op and they'll kick you out.
Okay?

409
00:24:44.661 --> 00:24:47.660
That's what's going on here.
It has nothing to do with this person.
Okay?

410
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.330
It's want you to just try to be a nice guy.
So I should have done off the Mike.

411
00:24:52.331 --> 00:24:54.340
Like I'm scolding myself.
Just try to be a nice guy.

412
00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:58.450
Let's not take out your bad day on everyone else.
Okay?
You're embarrassing me.

413
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.460
All right.
I'm 23 years old,

414
00:25:00.461 --> 00:25:04.360
but somewhat of a decent job and really just want to go back to being single for

415
00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.710
awhile.
Exactly.
Dude,
you're 23 years old.
Dude.

416
00:25:08.711 --> 00:25:10.510
You're fucking movie star at that age.

417
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:15.160
I don't care what you're doing for a living.
Should definitely be single.
I said,

418
00:25:15.161 --> 00:25:16.570
the problem is she's got a lot less,

419
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.210
she's got a lot of stress in her life right now,
if not your problem.

420
00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:23.800
She's finishing nursing school and trying to find a job.
All right,

421
00:25:23.801 --> 00:25:27.520
well tell her to put on the outfit Banger one more time and hey,
watch this.

422
00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:34.030
You bail out of the car.
Uh,
um.
Anyways.

423
00:25:34.031 --> 00:25:38.950
He says,
oh,
and she has a history of depression over the past year.

424
00:25:38.951 --> 00:25:42.190
I feel like she's becoming emotionally dependent on me.

425
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.390
Like I'm keeping her going or something.
Well,
Jesus Christ,

426
00:25:45.391 --> 00:25:48.430
no one do you want to get rid of her?
You don't want this.

427
00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.693
<v 0>You know,</v>

428
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.960
<v 1>you want something that someone that's going to be fun to be around.</v>

429
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.490
You don't want her,
you know,
it's sunny out and she's like,

430
00:25:58.491 --> 00:26:02.090
it's raining out the fucking head under the pillow.

431
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.120
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

432
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.830
<v 1>One of these days,
you know,
you stay with that long enough,</v>

433
00:26:05.831 --> 00:26:06.790
one of these days you're just going to,

434
00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.630
he's going to smother with that pillow is anyways.

435
00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:15.690
So how do I go about breaking up with her while causing the least amount of

436
00:26:15.731 --> 00:26:18.410
damage?
Uh,

437
00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.630
he said also she always leaves some of her shit in my apartment.
Yes.
Cause she's,

438
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.690
she wants to fucking,

439
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.570
<v 0>okay.</v>

440
00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:29.440
<v 1>Oh,
she's clinging onto you.
It says close blanket.
Other random shit.</v>

441
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.950
I tried to get her to take a shit home with her,
but how do I avoid after,
uh,

442
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.600
the after break up coming over to get my stuff.
I hate that.

443
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.830
Anyway.
Go Fuck Yourself.

444
00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.710
<v 0>All right,
look,</v>

445
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:48.330
<v 1>there's no way.
There's no easy way to break up with somebody.
All right.</v>

446
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.810
There's just easier ways.
Uh,

447
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.700
the sooner the better.

448
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.153
<v 2>MMM.</v>

449
00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:01.400
<v 1>Oh Diane,
I'll do this is like,
this is like dismantling a bomb.
So you know,</v>

450
00:27:01.401 --> 00:27:05.620
what you would like to do is say,
Hey,
can you come by today?

451
00:27:05.621 --> 00:27:09.370
I want to talk to you about something.
Right.
And always share.
I'll be right over.

452
00:27:09.371 --> 00:27:13.510
And I immediately just take out a box,
put all of her shit in it,

453
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.290
tape it up,
and then she rings the bell being bomb.
You opened the door,
he got,

454
00:27:17.291 --> 00:27:18.680
yeah,
don't want to date you anymore.

455
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.170
And he just handed the box and close the door.
Right.
Dude,

456
00:27:23.171 --> 00:27:24.520
there's money to be made in this man.

457
00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:27.940
Does anybody have a professional breakup service?

458
00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:33.270
That's such a pussy thing to do,
but that would be phenomenal.
You know it,

459
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.590
you feel,
you make a person feel like they got fired.

460
00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:40.150
You're like when a corporation fires you and just to security people,
show up,

461
00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.830
you know,
confiscate your computer and then escort you out of the building.

462
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.840
Would that be great?
Do,
that's what you should do.

463
00:27:46.841 --> 00:27:49.420
Just hire to your friends to dress up.
Like security guards.

464
00:27:49.421 --> 00:27:51.670
Tell her you want to break up,
you know,

465
00:27:51.671 --> 00:27:55.000
and then they have all their shit in the box.
Then they escort,

466
00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.910
escort or right out of your apartment building.
Like she got fired.

467
00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.530
It come off as professional rather than like personal.
Um,

468
00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.390
okay.
How do you go about breaking up with it?
You know what I would do,

469
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.550
I wouldn't put all our shit in the box because that's going to come off cold,

470
00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:16.860
you know,
and you don't want to hurt her feelings like that.
So I would just,
uh,

471
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:22.650
oh fuck it.
I don't know.
I don't know how to do it.
Why did I drink last night?

472
00:28:22.651 --> 00:28:24.960
And then I got up and did opie and Anthony,
what the fuck?
Cause Ron with me,

473
00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:28.470
I knew I had a podcast to do yet.
You're embarrassing me.
Um,

474
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:35.090
I don't,
I don't fucking know.
Have a come over and just say,
listen.
Um,

475
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:40.440
I'm not happy.
Oh,
that's a great one.
That's a classic.
You know,

476
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.080
like if you were a singer songwriter the second he said that the whole crowd

477
00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:45.420
would start applauding,
recognizing the big hit,

478
00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:47.883
<v 2>you know,</v>

479
00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:54.080
<v 1>above all the girls I do before,
you know,
they all start fucking clapping.</v>

480
00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.770
You know,
if they just came out,
you just did classic breakup monologues.
Okay,

481
00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.100
listen,
um,
I'm just not happy everyone just at smattering of applause.

482
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.670
You wait for it to die down.
Let the orchestra come around again.

483
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.200
She jumped back in on the one,
um,
match.

484
00:29:10.201 --> 00:29:13.770
Tell you're not happy.
I'm not happy anymore.
And Dude,
let me tell you something.

485
00:29:13.771 --> 00:29:17.160
Her being depressed is not your fucking problem.
All right?

486
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:22.080
Her being depressed is the fucking problem.
How can you do this to me?

487
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.760
Do you mean how can I do this too?
You don't want to be worse.

488
00:29:24.761 --> 00:29:27.280
If I fucking stayed with you and I didn't love you,
I don't love you anymore.

489
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.640
I don't love you.
Depressed whore.

490
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:36.990
I just called you a whore as a generic term.
You know,
I don't,
I'm,

491
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:40.780
I'm not happy.
I want to,
okay.
I just feel like I want to be single right now.

492
00:29:40.781 --> 00:29:43.450
I just feel like I'm going to be with you in long haul.
Uh,

493
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.140
we'll just be wasting each other's time.
My time is important and so is yours.

494
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.800
All right?
I don't want to go anymore,
but I'll tell you what.

495
00:29:50.801 --> 00:29:55.620
If you go to stamps.com,
they'll give you $55 free stamps to the scale.

496
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:57.280
<v 2>Okay?</v>

497
00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.610
<v 1>That's what you do.
Just tag every mean thing you say with all the advertising.</v>

498
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.990
<v 2>Okay.</v>

499
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:06.220
<v 1>You know,
if you go to amazon.com so bill burrs website,
you know,</v>

500
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.440
click on the Little Amazon banner,
whatever you buy,
you know,

501
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.810
portion of that money goes back to bill burn.

502
00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.490
Then the percentage of that goes to the wounded warriors project.

503
00:30:15.491 --> 00:30:18.160
So I know I'm breaking up with you right now,
but you could,

504
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.990
we could also support the troops,

505
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.013
<v 2>right,</v>

506
00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.560
<v 1>sir?
Look,
there's no fucking easy way to do this.</v>

507
00:30:25.561 --> 00:30:28.560
And you're going to be sitting there.
How many more holidays?

508
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:33.000
How many more birthdays?
How many more Christmases,
which is a holiday?
Sorry,

509
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.610
you always need three examples.
Do you want to go through with this person?

510
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.390
How many more times do you want to go out and rent bikes?
Go to a picnic,

511
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.430
sit there on a sunny day.

512
00:30:41.431 --> 00:30:44.070
Is she sitting there with that cloud over a fucking head?

513
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.943
<v 2>You know,</v>

514
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.080
<v 1>dude,
you know,
don't do that to yourself.</v>

515
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.970
You want to fucking people who are just wonderful human beings and they just end

516
00:30:54.971 --> 00:30:58.330
up with assholes.
I swear to God,
assholes.

517
00:30:58.331 --> 00:31:02.110
They look for wonderful human beings because other assholes are not going to put

518
00:31:02.111 --> 00:31:06.410
up with them.
You know,
so you need to be an ass hole here at,
you know,
the,
the,

519
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:09.370
the how society looks as an,
as an asshole.
Like you're being selfish,

520
00:31:09.371 --> 00:31:11.530
not being selfish,
all right?
Choose yourself,

521
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:14.440
choose your own fucking life dumper and get on with your life.

522
00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.053
<v 2>You don't,</v>

523
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:18.410
<v 1>this is what you do.</v>

524
00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:22.070
You get yourself by six a fucking Pale Ale or whatever beer you like.

525
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.180
You stick a couple of glasses in the fucking freezer.

526
00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:28.573
<v 2>All right?</v>

527
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.410
<v 1>Like anticipation of this championship that you know you're going to win.</v>

528
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.273
You know,

529
00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.760
like they did in the red sox dugout when they had the champagne on ice in game

530
00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:41.290
six in 1986 before they had to quickly wheel it out,
okay?

531
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.810
Except you're not going to let this one go through your leg,
sir.

532
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.130
You kicking this one right?

533
00:31:45.131 --> 00:31:48.700
The cunt and you'd taken home the fucking championship and when it's over all

534
00:31:48.701 --> 00:31:51.820
you got to be just thinking about those frosty fucking bruise in the fridge.

535
00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:56.530
Just think about that.
Just look at the clock when she walks in.
All right.

536
00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.060
Let's say she comes in at 10 past to just say to yourself,

537
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:04.810
worst case scenario by three fucking 30.

538
00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.050
<v 2>Okay,</v>

539
00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.270
<v 1>I'm going to be sitting down in this fucking couch,</v>

540
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.813
<v 2>all right.</v>

541
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.700
<v 1>With my goddamn phone off,</v>

542
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.210
drinking a couple of five or six of these things

543
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.530
<v 2>and then that's it.
All right,</v>

544
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:25.310
<v 1>and then don't fucking have a post breakup sex.</v>

545
00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.610
Don't do that.
Cause then she'll think that you're back together again.

546
00:32:28.611 --> 00:32:29.480
Fuck all of that.

547
00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:31.873
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

548
00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.480
<v 1>they gotta come by.
Yeah,
my staff.
Okay.</v>

549
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:40.910
When do you want to come by?
This is coming off really cold.

550
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.320
She's going to do all of that and just try to keep dragging you back into the

551
00:32:45.321 --> 00:32:47.870
fucking thing.
Um,

552
00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:51.653
<v 0>okay.</v>

553
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.390
<v 1>I don't know if this is a punk thing to do,
but after you break up with,</v>

554
00:32:54.391 --> 00:32:57.500
they just don't answer the phone when she calls and then she'll find,
just say,

555
00:32:57.501 --> 00:33:02.030
listen,
I gotta I gotta come by and get my stuff.
Can you text her back?

556
00:33:02.031 --> 00:33:05.570
I fucking just be a man.
What is she going to do?
Body Slam you.

557
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:09.500
She's just going to make you feel bad.
All right.

558
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.920
<v 3>Ooh.
Is it blue?</v>

559
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:15.773
You would do.

560
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.970
<v 1>No,
it's cause you're a mopey.
You're sucking the life out of me.</v>

561
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.180
You know when,
when you get that sad look on your face,

562
00:33:25.181 --> 00:33:28.510
you look like a muppet there.
I said it all right.

563
00:33:28.511 --> 00:33:29.920
There's your shit over there in the corner.

564
00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.800
I've got a couple of cool ones in the fridge,
so why don't you do me a favor.

565
00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.170
All right,
get over there.
Bend Down,
lift with your knees,

566
00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:38.580
get your shit and get the fuck outta here.
When you say that,

567
00:33:38.581 --> 00:33:42.010
touch your prince charming is out there somewhere.

568
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:44.680
<v 2>You know and ain't here.</v>

569
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:49.280
<v 1>I'm not riding that horse anymore.
Okay?
I just shot it in the back of the head.</v>

570
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.420
It's over.
Okay,
so why don't you trudge on Outta here.

571
00:33:52.421 --> 00:33:55.560
They have fucking Cinderella.
Go look in a mirror.

572
00:33:55.561 --> 00:33:58.040
I go climb up in a tower and fucking drop your hair out.

573
00:33:58.041 --> 00:34:00.050
Whatever the fuck he supposed to do.
Kiss a frog.

574
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.050
<v 2>All right.
I got drinking to do
bait it.</v>

575
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.110
Something like that.

576
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.590
<v 1>Like I said,
all that bullshit.</v>

577
00:34:09.591 --> 00:34:13.580
I said 10 past two with Sova by three 30 by three 30 at Booz Allen.

578
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.180
<v 2>All right.
I don't know</v>

579
00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:23.760
<v 1>now the fucking brutal breaking up with somebody and as brutal as the awfulness</v>

580
00:34:23.761 --> 00:34:28.230
of this fucking podcast,
but other than that,
oh Jesus fucking Christ.

581
00:34:28.231 --> 00:34:29.220
This is the longest,

582
00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:32.790
you know what kills me is at the end of all this horrible fucking podcast,

583
00:34:32.791 --> 00:34:36.060
I then have to get into a fucking rent a car and I have to drive my ass out to

584
00:34:36.061 --> 00:34:39.960
the God damn airport to yet again fly across this goddamn country.

585
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.920
This is the worst flight.
You know,

586
00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:49.230
you only flight worst and flying across this country is the flight that crashes.

587
00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:54.680
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

588
00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.850
<v 1>And I got to admit,</v>

589
00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:58.820
I'm not even gonna say that doesn't fucking Jinxing my flight.

590
00:34:58.821 --> 00:35:02.450
Can you imagine that if I use,
I don't care if this one does.
And then it did get,

591
00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.630
imagine that and then they,
everybody,
okay.

592
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:08.750
See he said he didn't care if his plane crashed coming up next,

593
00:35:08.821 --> 00:35:11.430
the story of a Canadian.
Oh pray that is blank crash.

594
00:35:11.431 --> 00:35:13.400
And he took 250 innocent people with the,

595
00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:15.330
<v 0>yeah.</v>

596
00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:17.310
<v 1>Janice,
do you have a story?
No,</v>

597
00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:21.570
it appears he was doing a podcast and he had a problem with the heat,

598
00:35:21.571 --> 00:35:25.230
the apartment,
which then led to him talking about his flight.

599
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.680
It was during that rat.
Sorry,
we lost your current.

600
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:30.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

601
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.660
<v 1>You took too long to get to the point as usual.</v>

602
00:35:32.661 --> 00:35:35.170
That's why you're still out in the field.
I'm Ed.

603
00:35:35.171 --> 00:35:38.790
You guys see that they're going to do anchorman two.
Am I the only person,

604
00:35:38.791 --> 00:35:43.300
other person who's as excited as hell about that?
Ron Burgundy is coming back.
Uh,

605
00:35:43.301 --> 00:35:46.050
the man who started at all.
Um,
anyways,
here we go.

606
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:49.770
A representative for Massachusetts and Colorado.
Here's a wonderful story.

607
00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:54.630
Everybody.
Hey,
their belt.
Just want to tell you about,
oh Jeez.
Hey.
Hey there.

608
00:35:54.631 --> 00:35:58.710
Bill.
Just wanted to tell about how you,
how you,

609
00:35:58.711 --> 00:36:00.960
one of your fellow you fucking cunts.
Can you,
can you,

610
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:02.640
<v 0>okay.</v>

611
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.530
<v 1>I swear to God,
you guys do this on purpose.
You know,</v>

612
00:36:04.531 --> 00:36:09.480
I suck at reading out loud and then just wanted to tell you what you want to

613
00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:12.720
tell about how you,
one of your fellow Massachusetts people,

614
00:36:12.721 --> 00:36:14.310
which word do I take out there,
sir?

615
00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:15.740
<v 0>Okay.</v>

616
00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:20.740
<v 1>Just wanting to tell to tell about how one of your fellow Massachusetts scenes,</v>

617
00:36:21.111 --> 00:36:25.400
Ian's has been tormenting the shopping area where my bar is located,

618
00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.330
my blah,
um,
this all takes place in Denver,
by the way.

619
00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:30.890
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

620
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.950
<v 1>Um,
the Massachusetts is,
Ian's is first,</v>

621
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:35.870
what do they call people from Massachusetts.

622
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:36.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

623
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.240
<v 1>I just pause to wait for all the be mass holes,</v>

624
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.200
high five over cubicle wall.
Um,

625
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.870
this all takes place in Denver by the way.

626
00:36:45.871 --> 00:36:49.320
His first appearance was about a week ago when he stumbled into the bar where I

627
00:36:49.321 --> 00:36:53.940
work and asked me where he was.
I said the name of the bar and he said,

628
00:36:53.941 --> 00:36:57.810
no,
what state?
Cont uh,
Jesus,
he goes,

629
00:36:57.811 --> 00:37:00.240
I asked him why he called me a cunt and he said,

630
00:37:00.241 --> 00:37:04.350
people say it all the time where he's from,
which he said was Massachusetts.

631
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:09.540
I kicked him out.
This guy sounds like a good guy.
Um,
he says,
as a side note,

632
00:37:09.541 --> 00:37:13.590
I spent a week in the New England area and everyone was nice even in Boston.

633
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.360
Um,
anyway,

634
00:37:15.361 --> 00:37:19.980
a few days later he came back when I wasn't working and drank until he insulted

635
00:37:19.981 --> 00:37:24.600
the bar owner's wife,
I guess.
He went up to her and said,
what are you pregnant?

636
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:33.540
She was not,
she told him that that was rude and he called her a pregnant,
uh,

637
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:34.703
Jesus.

638
00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:39.210
How many fucking bridges of this guy burned before he decided he had to go west?

639
00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:42.870
Well,
there was a bunch of other people didn't realize what a Dicky was.
Anyways,

640
00:37:42.871 --> 00:37:43.920
he got kicked out.

641
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.180
I guess he'd been getting into a lot of trouble at the liquor store nearest to

642
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.110
anyways,
last night he came in,
I told him he wasn't welcomed anymore.

643
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.630
He asked why.
I reminded him why.

644
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:59.040
Then he started making fun of people from Colorado and a stereotypical hippie

645
00:37:59.041 --> 00:38:02.730
voice.
He said he thought we were all chill,
Bro,

646
00:38:02.731 --> 00:38:04.860
not so uptight,
man.

647
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:09.600
Then he gave me the peace sign with his fingers and left or like his middle

648
00:38:09.601 --> 00:38:10.980
fingers.
What was he doing?
I don't know.

649
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:16.230
It's funny because he has a pony tail and is filthy and calls everyone in

650
00:38:16.231 --> 00:38:17.430
Colorado.
Hippies.

651
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.970
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

652
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:24.410
<v 1>Uh,
well,
it's nice to know.
Yeah.
You got to just set a guy from Massachusetts,</v>

653
00:38:24.411 --> 00:38:27.480
moved to Colorado.
You didn't really have to go into all of that detail.
Yeah.

654
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:31.760
You know,
what kind of,
uh,
does he sound any worse than me?

655
00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.290
No.
I have a horrific need to be liked,
so I wouldn't do something like that.

656
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.160
I would if I got drunk enough,
but then the next day I'd be like,
all right,

657
00:38:38.161 --> 00:38:39.790
I need,
I need to lay off that shit.

658
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:41.703
<v 0>You know?</v>

659
00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:45.180
<v 1>I Dunno what the fuck to talk about at this point.
People,
I'm 40,</v>

660
00:38:45.181 --> 00:38:48.750
I'm not even 40 minutes.
Then
honestly,
people,

661
00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:50.400
if it didn't have to go to the fucking airport,

662
00:38:50.401 --> 00:38:54.060
I would have raised this entire thing.
I would,
I don't know what I would do.

663
00:38:54.061 --> 00:38:56.880
I'd go sleep for fucking six hours and I would start over again,

664
00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:00.480
but I don't have those options.
You know,

665
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:04.540
this is the same thing of when Geraldo opened that vault and it was live and

666
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:07.470
there was just nothing,
nothing in it.
That's what this is.

667
00:39:07.471 --> 00:39:12.270
This is the Geraldo Rivera episode of the Monday morning fucking podcast.
Um,

668
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:13.560
I didn't know what to do at this point.

669
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:15.930
You guys want to talk about some topical Shit?

670
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.100
Did you guys see that jet blue pilot then went fucking absolutely crazy?

671
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.870
Was it jet blue?
I don't know.

672
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.710
And then everybody had to tackle him and fucking restrain him.

673
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:29.030
I don't know how I feel I would feel about that.
You know,

674
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.120
I know the guys going nuts but I don't know how to fly the plane so I just cut

675
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:37.240
down the amount of people who can land this thing by 50%.

676
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:42.410
Like the level of nuts that he would have to be.
They'd just be something,

677
00:39:42.411 --> 00:39:44.510
you know,
there's just something about those.
Uh,

678
00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.640
let's like John Travolta was on the flight.

679
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:52.370
He knows how to land one of those things,
you know,
I bet he's not scared to fly

680
00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.790
cause he like knows what's going on and if anything bad happened,

681
00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.373
<v 0>right.</v>

682
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.850
<v 1>Why do they have to have those secret service for you?</v>

683
00:40:02.851 --> 00:40:05.310
Why don't we just get like a bunch of John Travolta's to ride on there in case

684
00:40:05.311 --> 00:40:07.620
one of those nine 11 shit happens again,
right?

685
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.700
Aren't there a lot of movie stars and hot fly planes?
Oh my God.

686
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:15.270
I swear to God like I should be choked to death by fucking mic cord right now.

687
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.190
I'm literally out of comedy.
I think I just officially dried up everybody,

688
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.840
which is really sad because I had such a wonderful weekend,

689
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:29.100
wonderful weekend of riffing and new hour of Shit.

690
00:40:29.101 --> 00:40:34.050
Maybe that's what it is and right now I'm tempted to start doing those jokes to

691
00:40:34.051 --> 00:40:38.010
somehow get,
are we up to 40?
We have 40 minutes and 35 seconds.

692
00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.400
And listen guys,
you guys have favorite TV shows out there?
Sure.

693
00:40:41.401 --> 00:40:44.680
We all do to every once in a while.
Don't they just have bad episodes like yeah,

694
00:40:44.681 --> 00:40:47.460
and he didn't really like that one.
I think this is the one,

695
00:40:47.461 --> 00:40:51.530
although I bet you guys are somehow perversely enjoying this one.
Um,

696
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.920
materialists,
top five items.
This guy says,

697
00:40:55.921 --> 00:40:58.770
Yo bill being the materialistic bastard that I am,

698
00:40:58.771 --> 00:41:03.771
I've developed a top five essential items list for my capitalist lifestyle.

699
00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:09.030
I spare no expense on these items as I believe them to be necessary for my

700
00:41:09.031 --> 00:41:13.950
continued happiness.
My five items are in no particular order,

701
00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:19.660
they are number one by the way,
this is how it's done in America.
All right?

702
00:41:19.661 --> 00:41:23.190
So the rest he try and keep up.
If you've got the money,
buy this shit.

703
00:41:23.191 --> 00:41:24.024
If you don't,

704
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.540
you live in some third world country and I want to say thank you for making all

705
00:41:27.541 --> 00:41:31.260
this shit at 12 cents an hour.
All right?
Number One,
TV,

706
00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:34.490
70 71 inch,
Samsung DLP,

707
00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:36.130
<v 0>okay,</v>

708
00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:36.880
<v 1>number two,</v>

709
00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:41.500
and adjustable firmness bed is this American psycho sending me this shit?

710
00:41:41.501 --> 00:41:45.190
Number three,
a cell phone.
The latest iPhone number four,

711
00:41:45.191 --> 00:41:48.610
two ply toilet paper.
Sharman number five,

712
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:53.790
classic vehicles from the 60s [inaudible] 68 Oldsmobile convertible as 69 Jaguar

713
00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:58.870
e type,
uh,
64 amp fee.
Car Amphibious.

714
00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.510
What are your top five items and why?

715
00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:03.630
<v 0>Okay.</v>

716
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:08.340
<v 1>It's for just materialistic.
Selfish Shit.
All right,
I'd agree with you.</v>

717
00:42:08.341 --> 00:42:11.400
Number one has to be a TV because that's how you connect to the world.

718
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.040
And if I'm not connected to the world,

719
00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:17.100
I'm going to be doing jokes about shit nobody knows about and then I'm not going

720
00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:20.150
to be able to afford my fucking materialistic lifestyle.
So I'll give you that.

721
00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:21.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

722
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.390
<v 1>Uh,
fuck.</v>

723
00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:24.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

724
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.570
<v 1>You know what?
I don't like your list then you go with the bed.</v>

725
00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:29.570
I need to watch TV than I need to sleep.

726
00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:30.680
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

727
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.150
<v 1>I'm not going that way.
I would go,
uh,
I dunno.
Fucking top of the line.</v>

728
00:42:35.151 --> 00:42:35.984
V Drums.

729
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:37.190
<v 0>Okay.</v>

730
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.310
<v 1>A Gibson SG.</v>

731
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:44.560
I fucking f 100.
I don't know.
Oh my God guys,
I am,

732
00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:48.040
I think I just retired from comedy.
I have nothing.
I have absolutely zero funny.

733
00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.960
You know what?
Fuck is a materialistic.
How about your top five survivalist?

734
00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:55.383
<v 0>You don't</v>

735
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:01.690
<v 1>first things first.
Number one,
you need a gun.
Okay.</v>

736
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.810
Because you don't have a fucking gun.
You can't,
yeah.

737
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.510
Get anything you need or protect the shit you have.
So number one,

738
00:43:08.511 --> 00:43:09.410
you got to get a gun.

739
00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:11.150
<v 0>Okay?</v>

740
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:13.790
<v 1>Number two,
if you're murmuring in the background,</v>

741
00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:15.920
that's Joe to rose in the other room.
I should have brought to Mike's.

742
00:43:15.921 --> 00:43:17.270
Maybe they could have shot the shit with him.

743
00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:22.020
My hung over fucking state number two is,
uh,

744
00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:27.000
why
number two would be water.
You know,

745
00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:31.050
you can go fucking 40 days without food.
Isn't that what Jesus did?

746
00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:34.340
Isn't that why he was so shredded his whole life?
Every 40 days?
You look good.

747
00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:38.370
You're going to a two.
What I want you to do,
I think we'll go starve myself.

748
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.780
<v 0>Okay?</v>

749
00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:44.780
<v 1>I fucking hate every one of those God damn stories of some biblical figure who</v>

750
00:43:45.471 --> 00:43:47.550
suffering from me so I can live better.

751
00:43:47.551 --> 00:43:50.480
I didn't fucking ask you to do it all right?

752
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:56.170
I didn't go fucking eat something or do it for me and shut your face.

753
00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:01.490
You know I can't eat like I can't.

754
00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:05.340
I've thought about dying a lot lately and I was thinking,

755
00:44:05.341 --> 00:44:09.620
am I going to be that guy on my deathbed who then goes a hail Mary,
full grace,

756
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:11.430
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And it does all those prayers.

757
00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.440
I don't think I'm going to be,

758
00:44:12.441 --> 00:44:15.480
cause I really truly find it that fucking ridiculous.

759
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.340
<v 0>You know,</v>

760
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.920
<v 1>I dunno where you'd go.
All right?
But wherever I go,
nobody's mad at me.</v>

761
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:27.140
I haven't been there yet.
All right.

762
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:31.560
They're sitting in some of this fucking dimension watching my life.

763
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:33.690
Why would you do that?

764
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:36.223
<v 0>You know?</v>

765
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.680
<v 1>When did you just be fucking playing baseball and your dimension or whatever the</v>

766
00:44:40.681 --> 00:44:44.940
fuck it is you do over there?
Why would you give a shit what I'm doing?
Oh,

767
00:44:44.941 --> 00:44:47.250
look at this guy in Besalyn who gives a shit.

768
00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:52.510
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.
What am I talking about,
right?
Number one,

769
00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.990
I get a gun.
Number two,
fresh freshwater.
Number three,

770
00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.320
uh,
you got to get food.

771
00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:05.580
Now I need some sort of shelter.
Number five's a windmill number.

772
00:45:05.581 --> 00:45:07.770
Five's a wild card.
I think that does.

773
00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:10.920
Fifth one really lets people know what kind of a survivalist you are.

774
00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.780
You know,
if you say number five,
you know,
I want a boat,

775
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:20.490
you're definitely romantic.
If you say,
I want a windmill,
you like cookies?

776
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:22.743
<v 0>Uh</v>

777
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:31.000
<v 1>Oh guys,
I'm going to get a gun.
You know,</v>

778
00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:35.740
and my lady doesn't want me to get one.
All right.

779
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:40.480
Ever since I got a house I h I just feel like you're out of your fucking mind if

780
00:45:40.481 --> 00:45:45.140
you don't have a gun.
You know what I mean?
It's just like,

781
00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:49.820
like,
why do you,
I'm in this apartment building right now and this just all like,

782
00:45:49.821 --> 00:45:51.620
you know,
there's like five fucking floors,

783
00:45:51.621 --> 00:45:55.070
a human beings that you have to get through before you get to me.
Okay.

784
00:45:55.071 --> 00:45:57.800
I'm in my fucking house.
It's just me.
I'm just sitting there

785
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.720
where,
where is the safety that there's other houses around me?

786
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:08.280
I guess that I don't know what it is.
Just being like the only person

787
00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:10.973
<v 0>you know,</v>

788
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:14.760
<v 1>like I'm not in charge of this fucking building.
I find that very comforting.</v>

789
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:18.960
I come and I go,
nobody gives,
you know,
it's no problem.
The security,

790
00:46:18.961 --> 00:46:22.200
there's this cameras that are all that type of shit.
I got to,

791
00:46:22.201 --> 00:46:23.580
I gotta go a little Ted Nugent here.

792
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:28.710
I really want to secure around my perimeter as they say.

793
00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.860
Plus I like guns.
I think they're cool.

794
00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

795
00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.660
<v 1>Where do you guys think you guys into guns?
You're not into guns.</v>

796
00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.260
We're going to take college at this point.
Why don't I do what?

797
00:46:38.261 --> 00:46:43.060
Just turn to make this into a live fucking podcast.
Oh God,

798
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.710
I'll fucking beyond hung over.
Why do I do it?

799
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:49.640
I'm going to blame Farsi fucking animal.

800
00:46:49.641 --> 00:46:51.650
Glue it back to his house at like two 30 in the morning.

801
00:46:51.651 --> 00:46:54.620
Fucking pours me a whiskey.
Right?
It gets out some rum.

802
00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:58.400
It makes a giant rum and coke.
Lucky some fucking sophomore in college,

803
00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:02.540
pledging a Sorority,
kind of a man.
Drinks rum and cokes.

804
00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:06.020
I'll tell you who Paul [inaudible],
Paul brizy drinks.

805
00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.980
He drinks them in a big beer glass too,
to show how fucking uncultured he is.

806
00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.140
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

807
00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:17.530
<v 1>so I'm sitting there,
I'm drinking is fucking Scotch,
right?</v>

808
00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.580
I would have fucking gave me,

809
00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:24.580
and he's trying to tell me I should finish the bottle and I'm like,
I can't.

810
00:47:24.581 --> 00:47:27.250
I can't.
I get fucking radio in the morning.
He's like,
dude,

811
00:47:27.251 --> 00:47:28.860
there's no fucking way you making it to the radio.

812
00:47:28.861 --> 00:47:31.390
Cause had to be up at like seven 30.
It was already two 30 in the morning.

813
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:36.010
But I'll tell you I was up at seven 30 and he proceeded to fucking

814
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.520
go on this rant about Irish people.

815
00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:46.180
Like how he is an Italian.
Oh will fucking what the what?
He's Greek and and uh,

816
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:51.890
we said a little line when this Sicilian,
how does,

817
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:53.530
you know he gives you fucking Irish guys.

818
00:47:53.531 --> 00:47:55.540
You'd drink til four in the morning and you've gotta be up at seven.

819
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:59.380
He just fucking up at seven.
You guys can take a punch.
That's what he said.

820
00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:03.670
You know,
I don't know.
I don't believe that.

821
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:06.760
I think there's plenty of fucking half Greek half Sicilians.

822
00:48:06.761 --> 00:48:08.420
They could fucking drink til four in the morning to get up.

823
00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.120
You know what the problem,
the verse he gives,
he doesn't want it.

824
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:11.950
Guy Doesn't want it.

825
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:14.230
It doesn't have the fucking hard but you got out of the heart when you fucking

826
00:48:14.231 --> 00:48:17.530
drink,
you know,
set the worst feeling ever.

827
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.180
Those last three drinks we just know how fucking stupid you being.

828
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:23.650
You start laughing with your friends.

829
00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:27.850
You get like that group self sabotage going on.
Hey,

830
00:48:27.851 --> 00:48:31.240
this is really fucking stupid,
isn't it?
Um,

831
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:34.540
anyways,
let's get to underrated overrated.

832
00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:38.380
As I tried to turn on this fucking iPad for the 15th time,

833
00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:42.130
I gotta be honest with you.
A overrated Steve Jobs.

834
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:49.160
I just don't see what the fuck that guy did that was so god damn important that

835
00:48:49.291 --> 00:48:53.210
I read everything here very to break up with his girlfriend.
Oh Hey,

836
00:48:53.211 --> 00:48:55.190

You know what this podcast feels like.

839
00:48:59.641 --> 00:49:03.120
It feels like there was some sort of unbelievable tragedy and I still had to

840
00:49:03.121 --> 00:49:06.680
come on the air and I was expecting some sort of,
you know,

841
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:09.420
major guest and they just didn't show up.

842
00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:15.090
And we're still looking at the wreckage,
the wreckage of my fucking podcast.

843
00:49:15.091 --> 00:49:18.090

I think that's it for the advertising.

872
00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:05.770
I didn't skate fenders where they Kinda,

873
00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:10.280
they dropped the advertising on this podcast because they were so offended by

874
00:51:10.281 --> 00:51:13.940
the,
the unbelievable,
unbelievable lack of funny on this pocket.

875
00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:17.720
I can't even fucking talk this week.
Um,
no,

876
00:51:17.721 --> 00:51:20.030
not enough people bought the scape fenders and I'm gonna tell you something.

877
00:51:20.031 --> 00:51:24.440
You fucking missed out.
Oh,
I didn't talk about hockey last week.

878
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:29.810
I told you guys that I've been starting to put some shit together here after a

879
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:31.250
year and a half a plan.
I don't know what's going on.
Oh,

880
00:51:31.251 --> 00:51:35.090
Billy boys starting to trust his edges out there.
Okay.

881
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.270
Last week I actually had,

882
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:43.630
I had a goal for the first time and I can't since maybe January

883
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:50.510
I had a goal.
It's coming down the left wing.
Puck came right across the crease.

884
00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:54.770
I had like almost no angle whatsoever.

885
00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:59.570
I saw the open space and I flipped it and somehow the fucking puck went right up

886
00:51:59.571 --> 00:52:01.250
and over the goalies shoulder into the net.

887
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:05.930
Exactly what I wanted to have happened happened and you know,

888
00:52:05.931 --> 00:52:10.680
it's pickup [inaudible] nobody really celebrates goals because there's like 20

889
00:52:10.681 --> 00:52:14.280
scored on each side.
But I was just such an excited little girl.

890
00:52:14.281 --> 00:52:15.840
I put my fucking arms up like,
you know,

891
00:52:15.841 --> 00:52:18.920
when Messier guaranteed the victory against the devils,
you know,

892
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.990
which is glide behind the net with his arms straight up.

893
00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.860
I was waiting for the roar of the crowd.
Everyone else just sort of skated back,

894
00:52:25.861 --> 00:52:28.590
you know and started going the other directions as I sat there with you know,

895
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.770
you know it's the same thing Joe Montana used to do when there was a touchdown.

896
00:52:31.771 --> 00:52:33.090
There's no bending at the elbows.

897
00:52:33.091 --> 00:52:36.000
You just bring them straight up like like Charlie Brown when he yells.

898
00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:41.050
That's what I did and I'm so psyched I got one early.

899
00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:43.770
Okay this is not well just how much I've gotten into hockey.

900
00:52:43.771 --> 00:52:48.520
I've actually gone on Youtube and I've been watching this guy and he has a,

901
00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.670
he almost does like the John Madden thing cause my big,

902
00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:55.000
my biggest problem aside from sucking at stick handling,

903
00:52:55.001 --> 00:53:00.001
skating and all aspects of the game is just the overall question of where the

904
00:53:00.041 --> 00:53:03.580
fuck am I supposed to be out there?
And I just watched this guys,

905
00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:07.450
okay this guy's videos,
I'll watch like 45 minutes of videos.

906
00:53:07.451 --> 00:53:11.110
Just absorbing a little bit from each video about how to do a breakout,

907
00:53:11.111 --> 00:53:13.840
where to be on a power play and even though it's dope power plays,
whatever,

908
00:53:13.841 --> 00:53:16.750
just basic fundamental shit.

909
00:53:16.751 --> 00:53:21.010
Is it defensive as a forward cycling it around drills.
Just shit like that.

910
00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:24.040
And I actually got a compliment last week said,
you know what,
you're,
you're,

911
00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.670
you're decent positional player.

912
00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:31.110
You still suck when we send you the puck.
I just fucking,

913
00:53:31.111 --> 00:53:34.680
I can't stick handle for my life,
but I kind of know where to be now,

914
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:37.970
which means more people pass to me and then I fuck up even more.
Dude,

915
00:53:37.971 --> 00:53:39.930
do you want to talk about panicking with the puck?

916
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:43.610
I was joking with opie today on the,
on the uh,
the a program,
uh,

917
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:48.510
about that FD if you have,
she had a heart monitor hooked up to my,
my whatever.

918
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:50.730
My wrist with a pulse is act.
Is that what it is?

919
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.760
I don't fucking know my elbow like how,

920
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:57.660
I bet it goes up like 30 beats a fucking minute the second I get the puck and

921
00:53:57.661 --> 00:54:00.740
people always try to help me out.
No one around your plenty times y'all,

922
00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.910
you got plenty of time.
And I immediately

923
00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:09.090
like just blindly pass it and I just feel everyone on my team,
just God,

924
00:54:09.091 --> 00:54:12.860
this fucking guy,
why does he keep showing up?
But anyways,

925
00:54:12.861 --> 00:54:15.930
so I got a goal and uh,

926
00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:20.550
it was a fucking sharp shoot if I do say so myself.
So now I'm excited.

927
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:24.630
I got a little spring in my step.
We play for an hour and a half.

928
00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:28.860
About an hour later I have some on a breakout.

929
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:32.940
I get the fucking puck.
I went around to defensemen,
swear to God.

930
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:35.640
I don't know how I did it.
I was looking down at the ice.

931
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:41.370
That's how I stick handle faked out one faked out the other.

932
00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:45.810
Got The goalie leaning all the way to the right.
I got half the net wide open.

933
00:54:45.811 --> 00:54:47.070
I'm like holy fuck.

934
00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:52.700
Two goals in one game of pickup in 90 minutes for player of my caliber would

935
00:54:52.771 --> 00:54:53.461
have been like,

936
00:54:53.461 --> 00:54:57.210
it would've been the equivalent of when Gretzky scored 50 goals in 39 games.

937
00:54:57.211 --> 00:55:00.240
It was fucking wide open and I flipped it.

938
00:55:00.241 --> 00:55:04.110
It was going right to the net and the goalie at the last second stuck his hand

939
00:55:04.111 --> 00:55:07.950
out and just fucking snatched it out of the air.
Everybody the eyes.

940
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:12.810
Oh.
And then that was it.
I was still one goal.

941
00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:14.580
Billy just fucking horrible.

942
00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:17.880
And I gotta tell you something that bugged me for three God damn days.

943
00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:20.650
<v 2>It was literally,</v>

944
00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.450
<v 1>do you ever watch when you watch a fucking hockey game and they have those</v>

945
00:55:24.451 --> 00:55:27.030
little eight year olds,
you know,
they stick,
handle no escape.

946
00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:30.840
That's what I look like.
They're actually better than me.

947
00:55:30.841 --> 00:55:34.950
I would say like a six year old.
I don't know if I'm peewee level of squirts.

948
00:55:34.951 --> 00:55:37.170
I never paid organized,
but uh,

949
00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:39.963
<v 2>I dunno.</v>

950
00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.190
<v 1>I'm really enjoying that.
I,
I plan on playing the game and I got to tell you,</v>

951
00:55:44.191 --> 00:55:47.280
I've been wearing those scape fenders things if people for it first,

952
00:55:47.281 --> 00:55:50.130
we'll make it fun of me.
And now that you kind of going like,
you know,

953
00:55:50.131 --> 00:55:52.860
I've seen guys,
you know,
I've seen players wearing them in the NHL,

954
00:55:52.861 --> 00:55:56.640
did the fucking shit.
I got hit in the foot during the game.

955
00:55:56.641 --> 00:55:59.190
I finally took one off the foot.
I don't know where I took it.

956
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:02.580
I don't know how hard it was.
It had no effect it,

957
00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:06.840
it felt lighter than if I got hit in like the sh I felt it more than the ship at

958
00:56:06.841 --> 00:56:09.260
all.
His nothing happened to me this whole fucking slow.
I am.

959
00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:11.190
I was trying to get back on defense.

960
00:56:11.191 --> 00:56:15.080
Like I can skate backwards but not nearly fast enough.
So what always happens is,

961
00:56:15.081 --> 00:56:18.630
is ice skate backwards for about three feet before I have to immediately turn

962
00:56:18.631 --> 00:56:21.660
around and,
and I immediately,
I,
and I'm so slow,

963
00:56:21.661 --> 00:56:25.390
I look like I'm part of the offensive break rather than the person trying to

964
00:56:25.391 --> 00:56:29.140
stop it on defense.
So I went into the offensive,
there are offensive zone.
My,

965
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:33.550
my what I'm supposed to be defending and a,
this is when you know you're slow,

966
00:56:33.551 --> 00:56:35.170
when you take a slap shot in the ass.

967
00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:47.250
That's how slow I was on defense.
I got anything literally hit in the ass.

968
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:52.140
It was just below the s,
you know the referees,
you know,
it was like in when you,

969
00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:53.940
you got to see if you've got a first down or not.

970
00:56:53.941 --> 00:56:57.300
It was not quite a fucking first down to just bust my ass.

971
00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:02.120
And there is no padding there whatsoever.
Thank God.
It was just a risk though.

972
00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:06.930
Um,
but I'm not going to lie to you.
It fucking hurt like hell.

973
00:57:06.931 --> 00:57:10.000
But there was no way I was going to show it.
The dude,
fuck it hit me.

974
00:57:10.001 --> 00:57:10.970
It just goes,
ah.

975
00:57:12.050 --> 00:57:17.040
And everyone laughed and I had to pretend like it didn't fucking happen.
Ah,

976
00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:21.030
so close to the glory of fucking two goals.
And then I get,
I,

977
00:57:21.031 --> 00:57:24.030
I missed the second one and then I get fucking hit in the ass of the pocket.

978
00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:28.650
I just go right back to being the Douche bag,
you know?
So anyways,

979
00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:33.360
so this is the deal.
So I'm loving the fucking games,
the greatest Goddamn game.

980
00:57:33.361 --> 00:57:34.770
Don't think you're too old to take it up.

981
00:57:34.771 --> 00:57:37.860
I took it up and fucking 42 I'm having a time in my life and I'm joining a

982
00:57:37.861 --> 00:57:42.000
fucking league.
Oh my God,
who just walked into the room out of the bedroom,

983
00:57:42.001 --> 00:57:42.990
the sensation,

984
00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:49.100
the teen idols sensation wearing a fucking leather coat to match Joe to Rosa.

985
00:57:49.741 --> 00:57:54.020
Joe,
how the fuck I have a seat?
I know you can't just have a seat sale up.
Joe,

986
00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:56.650
you haven't been on the podcast forever.
How are you man?

987
00:57:56.651 --> 00:57:59.360
I remember we used to do radio show.
I remember Bill Joe.

988
00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:01.050
Those were the days we used to sing songs.

989
00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:05.550
We used to talk about things or let me tell you around here.
No,
I'm not.
It's,

990
00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:10.260
it's horrible.
It's,
it's hot as fuck.
I've just been,
I've been brutally unfunny.

991
00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.980
I'm hung over this whole podcast.
I've been just apologizing,

992
00:58:13.981 --> 00:58:17.190
shitting all over how unfunny what's it until like I just told the story about

993
00:58:17.191 --> 00:58:20.430
playing hockey and that I think that that was mildly amusing and that made me

994
00:58:20.431 --> 00:58:24.900
laugh was I see singing out here.
Oh,

995
00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:25.830
you know what I was singing about?

996
00:58:25.831 --> 00:58:28.200
I was singing some guy who was trying to figure out how to break up with his

997
00:58:28.201 --> 00:58:30.920
girl and not hurt her feelings.
She's some girl,

998
00:58:30.921 --> 00:58:33.570
she was like depressed all the time.
He has to keep her going.

999
00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:38.310
I mean it's a no brainer.
He's 23 years old,
right?
Yeah.
Jesus.
Joe,
23 years old.

1000
00:58:38.311 --> 00:58:40.810
Joe Did the,
everybody's in sensation at that age.
Okay.

1001
00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:44.860
<v 4>All right.
But it is not that young man's responsibility to take on her problem.</v>

1002
00:58:44.861 --> 00:58:47.710
She's got to work those things out and when she loves her shelf,

1003
00:58:47.711 --> 00:58:48.640
then she can love you

1004
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:52.730
<v 1>Joe Fucking de Rosa.
That,
I mean that's,</v>

1005
00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:57.750
I was trying to get to that point for fucking 10 minutes.
That's it.
Joe.

1006
00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:01.320
I don't,
Joe,
you've had one girlfriend that I've known you for eight years.

1007
00:59:01.321 --> 00:59:05.920
Joe Is the master of just not even getting into relationships or they'll you,

1008
00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:08.250
you're the master of like what the three week relationship.

1009
00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:12.940
<v 4>I usually go a couple of months.
Yeah,
something like that.
I don't get too,
uh,</v>

1010
00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.120
too serious,
but I think I'm ready now.
I think I'm moving into that.

1011
00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:20.280
<v 1>I don't care about that.
This isn't about you.
This isn't about you.</v>

1012
00:59:20.281 --> 00:59:23.210
It's about this.
So at two,
two months in,

1013
00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:26.750
that's got to be a small box of shit that you have to pack up when they come

1014
00:59:26.751 --> 00:59:28.160
over to get their stuff.
Am I wrong?

1015
00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:31.720
<v 4>I mean,
I don't even think you're on a phone call to what's it?</v>

1016
00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:35.520
<v 1>You could do it over the phone at two months.
I've done that.
I've done that too.</v>

1017
00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.880
Oh,
you do the fade away?
Yeah.

1018
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:42.620
<v 4>You just disappear.
Like Kevin Spacey walking down the street.</v>

1019
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:43.820
If you have the usual suspects,

1020
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:51.200
<v 1>just straightly all leg out and off he goes.
Ah.
He goes,
where are you off to Joe?</v>

1021
00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:55.220
I got a meeting at Atlantic records.
They built all the sensation.

1022
00:59:55.221 --> 00:59:57.680
He's going over there.
Joe,
don't get now.

1023
00:59:57.681 --> 01:00:01.970
Don't walk in there and get all star struck with all those albums on the wall.

1024
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.230
Okay.
Nobody buys those anymore.
You're walking into a dinosaur,
Joe.

1025
01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:08.960
They need you.
That's right.
Okay.
Let me hear you say it.

1026
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:10.730
<v 4>Oh,
I'll say you need me.</v>

1027
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:14.670
<v 1>You need me.
Mr Atlantic,
Mister and Mrs Atlantic records.</v>

1028
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:17.820
<v 4>You are,
I'll say you think I'm impressed.</v>

1029
01:00:17.821 --> 01:00:21.060
I got go birds sitting on my couch.
[inaudible] suckers.

1030
01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:24.540
<v 1>Yeah.
That's how you started.
Exactly.
Don't Chevy Chase on him.</v>

1031
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.610
I'll see you when I get home bill.
All right Joseph.
Hey Joe.

1032
01:00:30.611 --> 01:00:32.790
Maybe we'll have a couple of pops before I go to the airport,

1033
01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:37.470
but it'll have her the dog there.
Ah,
Christ.

1034
01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.050
This is,
you know,
I really want it to be healthy on this road trip,

1035
01:00:41.051 --> 01:00:42.910
but this is one of these ones we just say,
you know,

1036
01:00:42.911 --> 01:00:44.980
we just have fucked up so bad.
You just,

1037
01:00:44.981 --> 01:00:49.090
you just ended like buzzed eating a pint of ice cream.
Go on.
You know what?

1038
01:00:49.091 --> 01:00:49.924
Maybe the next one.

1039
01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:54.610
I'd like to think that I may be pulled this one out in the end.
You know,

1040
01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.960
talking about my love of hockey.
How great.
He's Joe de Rosa.
Huh?

1041
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.720
You telling me that that guy just isn't a ray of sunshine,
you know,

1042
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:06.640
that's why he's called the sensation Joey roses.
He makes it fucking blow.
Um,

1043
01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.230
is there anything else to talk about?

1044
01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:12.040
Do I really need to go beyond a fucking hour on this?
I don't think I do.
People.

1045
01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.400
I apologize for the fucking hung over one,
but you know something.

1046
01:01:15.401 --> 01:01:17.440
You went all of 2011 without one.

1047
01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.470
I'm trying to think the last time I was hung over on a podcast.

1048
01:01:20.471 --> 01:01:21.520
I think it's been a long time.

1049
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:26.500
It's been a while since you fucking whatever ever that guy stayed.

1050
01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:31.510
I used to sing about his dad.
Remember that?
Um,
anyways,

1051
01:01:31.511 --> 01:01:32.980
that's the podcast for this week.
You guys.

1052
01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:37.210
I know it was late and I know it wasn't worth the wait.
So you don't need,

1053
01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.540
you don't even need to tell me.
I know.
All right.

1054
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:42.170
Don't be one of those Douche bags.

1055
01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:47.310
You know like when you fucking get arrested for drinking and driving and then

1056
01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:49.960
your friend shows up and tells you how fucking stupid you are.

1057
01:01:49.961 --> 01:01:54.040
Like you didn't realize that when you spent the night in jail with no sneakers

1058
01:01:54.041 --> 01:01:57.010
on cause he thought you're going to hang yourself by your shoe laces.

1059
01:01:57.011 --> 01:01:58.510
Like if he couldn't figure out that point,

1060
01:01:58.511 --> 01:02:02.400
do you think I really need you to tell me that you do?
Okay.

1061
01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:06.520
All right.
I don't even what that means.
All right.
That's a podcast for this week.

1062
01:02:06.521 --> 01:02:10.810
Go fuck yourselves.
I will talk to you next week.
And,
um,

1063
01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.780
yeah,
that's it.
Go Fuck Yourself.
