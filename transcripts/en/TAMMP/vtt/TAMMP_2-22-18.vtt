00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.350
Hey,

2
00:00:05.351 --> 00:00:07.300
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.980
Just checking in on you a little Tarzan,
little Tarzan.

4
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.980
Very little Johnny Weissmuller.

5
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.890
I remember that guy that's back when bead and shake was just not like being fat.

6
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.570
Johnny Moy smelly.
It was an Olympic swimmer and even he was yanking his fucking,

7
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.570
what about the hell he had days?

8
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.600
Little fig leaf over his junky yanked it up past his navel.
Nobody.

9
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.880
<v 1>I challenge you to find one person who was shirtless back then.</v>

11
00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:42.340
You could actually see their belly button.
I don't know.

12
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.590
<v 1>If that was because the naval was considered new to the back then or lewd or the</v>

14
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:54.670
devil's work.
The Porthole two to,
I dunno.
Getting some pork.

15
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.710
I don't know.
I have no idea.
I don't pretend to know these things.

16
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.180
Why didn't I take out my fucking Invisalign?
Why didn't I take it?

17
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:04.770
I forgot to take the fucking shit out.

18
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.490
I am on train number 11 1111 or 13

19
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.200
Trey 11 and 13 isn't interesting story about train number 11 okay.

20
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.760
I brought it to New York.
All right.
Cause I went back to do the Patrice O'neil,

21
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.590
the sixth annual Patrice O'Neal benefit and um,
which by the way,

22
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:29.180
I think that was probably the best one we had as far as everybody murdered.

23
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.680
Just a perfect mix of,
of uh,
people that knew him,

24
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.280
people that were fans of them,
black,
white,
male,
female.

25
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.960
Two stories about Patrice comic shitting on each other.

26
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.550
Voss took a fucking pounding.
Hey hosted,
I don't know what he was wearing.

27
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:53.510
He had this bing Crosby hat on.
Then he had his flannel like a,

28
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:57.260
I'm going to go see Pearl jam shirt on,
but he buttoned it all the way up.

29
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.330
You know,
like they were going to,

30
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.830
we would joke and like they were going to reboot that movie colors.
Um,

31
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.480
and then he had like these red plastic shoes on that he swore where the shit,

32
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.910
I don't know what it was just one of those deals where it's just like rich,

33
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:12.560
you have to take one of those things off.

34
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.980
If you're going to button up the flannel and have red shoes on,

35
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:19.220
get rid of the hat.
Where if you're going to keep the hack,
get rid of the shoes.

36
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:22.370
If you can wear the shoes and the hat put on a different fucking shirt.

37
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.560
All right.
The Rich Vos is not a smart man.
Okay?

38
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:31.130
He's driven.
He's dedicated,
but he's,
he's,
he's not always on the right track.

39
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:34.910
And this was one of these evenings and we tried to tell him he took a good

40
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:38.030
pounding.
Keith Robinson actually just showed up just to trash people.

41
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.600
He went backstage and Jim Norton was just minding his own business,

42
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:45.740
eating something and Keith slapped the food right out of his fucking hand onto

43
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:48.140
the floor.
You know,
the usual maturity.

44
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:52.280
But I want to thank everybody that came down in the crowd and all the comics,

45
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:54.410
Sam j who I had never seen before,

46
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.520
fucking murdered Pekori Ellie rich vos safer sounds deejayed it.

47
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.840
Thank you so much.
Jim Norton.
Dave Attell is always,
oh,

48
00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:07.050
the teen idols sensation from the late great opie and Anthony Show.

49
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.340
Robert Kelly,
my old roommate from back in the day,
Jessica Curson,

50
00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:14.760
Greer Barnes and Maureen Taren for putting the whole thing together.
Thank you.

51
00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:17.100
And thank you to everybody who came out.

52
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.060
It was just a fucking awesome show.
Just an awesome show.
I all of them,

53
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.350
they had me pacing and I had to go on after,
uh,
most of them there.

54
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.750
And,
um,
I was just,
oh no.
Oh No.
What did I do?

55
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.510
What did I just do?
He can't even fucking lean back in this God damn place.

56
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.950
Is it still recording?
It is recording,
but I can't hear myself.
Oh Jesus.

57
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.230
Which they had phone there.

58
00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:46.560
It is going to plug it in now.

59
00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:48.270
Most people would fucking edit that out.

60
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.680
Most people are too afraid to look foolish on their own fucking podcasts where

61
00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:56.700
it's just them and they play the producer and all of that bullshit.
But not me,

62
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.470
not me.
So I just,
I had the perfect fucking time.
You know,

63
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:06.260
I did the west side comedy club,
tuned up there the night before.
Uh,

64
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.960
just so happened Jerry Seinfeld came down,
so I've got to watch him do his set.

65
00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:12.960
Absolutely crushed.
Um,

66
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.480
such a great comedy club.
Right?

67
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.070
It's on 75th and Broadway and between Broadway and Amsterdam,

68
00:04:20.071 --> 00:04:24.270
it's literally right next to the beacon theater and a fucking love that place.

69
00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:29.100
Thank you to the stand for doing the after party and all that as they always do

70
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.220
a,
I might be in New York next week and I'll be down the stand.

71
00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:35.850
I'll let you guys know.
Um,
alright.
Plowing ahead.

72
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.030
So it's the perfect night.
Everything's going great.

73
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:41.700
We all hang out down the stand afterwards.
They're always so generous.

74
00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:43.180
They've always hosted the afterparty.

75
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.620
They've given everybody food and all this shit.
Just be in the,
uh,

76
00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:49.410
the great guys that they are.
And um,

77
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.080
so the end of the night comes,
I go home and I'm thinking,

78
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.540
what an absolute perfect two days in New York.
And uh,

79
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.260
and I even remembered because I was wearing train number 10,

80
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.230
I even remembered tre number 11.

81
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.960
Cause Wednesdays is when I got to put the new one in.
So the next day I wake up,

82
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.830
I already booked myself a car service,
which I always forget to fucking do.

83
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.650
I break open the bag,
I put trade number 11 in.
Ah,

84
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.180
it's always hard the first couple of days,
right.

85
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.100
I also did the Jim and Sam show had a great time on that.
Um,

86
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.660
just making sure I think everybody,
so anyways,

87
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.950
I put the fucking trays and then I was like,
well,
you know,

88
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.250
I'm dying of thirst here.
The cars coming,

89
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.490
so let me just have a nice light breakfast.
So I go across the street,

90
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.320
I buy a fucking orange and a big thing of water.
So I take the Invisalign out,

91
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:45.600
I'm fucking eating the orange and all that shit,
right?

92
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.830
Cause you can't eat with these things in unless you're an absolute fucking pig.

93
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.580
Drink the water and all that shit.
And then I just,
you know,

94
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.070
throw all the bullshit out,
right?
And all that type of stuff.

95
00:05:56.071 --> 00:05:59.220
Throw it down the fucking shoot,
grabbed my bags and ready to go.

96
00:05:59.221 --> 00:06:02.480
I still got 10 minutes to spare and then I'm looking for the Invisalign.

97
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.490
Where the fuck is it?
I'm like,
oh no,
please tell me.

98
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.900
I just didn't throw it down that fucking garbage chute with everybody else's

99
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:15.430
garbage from the building.
Please tell me.
I didn't fucking do that way that

100
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.340
I threw it down the fucking shoot.
So I'm like,
now what do I do?

101
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.050
I can put the old tray back in so my teeth don't move or anything like that.

102
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:30.170
And maybe I could go home and put train number 12 and that's what the fuck I'll

103
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:31.430
do it.
Fuck it.
It's gone.

104
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.120
I'm not going down and digging those fucking things out of the trash.

105
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:36.830
I'm not fucking doing it.
Right.

106
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.000
And then I just sat there and I was like,
you know what?

107
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.480
My wife would she tell me to go down and go get it and fucking just fucking

108
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.530
soaking Listerine for a day.
So I'm like,
fuck.
All right,

109
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.210
I'll do it.
I'm going to do it.
I fucking go downstairs.
Right.

110
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.600
Do you remember a peewee Herman when he ran out of the pet store with the
snakes?

111
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.780
That's what I was like.

112
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.760
So it went down there and the super was there and we'd fucking fortunately no

113
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.680
one through any trash on top of it.

114
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.460
And there was sitting right on top.
Look,

115
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:16.570
I had a pizza box and something like that.
One of them was in the pizza box,

116
00:07:16.571 --> 00:07:20.840
the other one was sitting right on top,
like a fucking prize,
but still right.

117
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.090
So I just took them through them in my bag.
And then,
uh,
I came home,

118
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.720
I rinsed him off,
scrubbed him with this brush I have,

119
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.830
and then I just threw them in Listerine full like overnight and then said,

120
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.960
all right,
I'm going to pop these in the mouth,
my mouth,

121
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:40.190
and hopefully I don't get some fucking grown in my intestines.
So,
uh,

122
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.250
that's it.
Pretty Gross.

123
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.950
I'm from a guy who always to said talking about people that fucking walked

124
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:48.290
barefoot into a public bathroom on a plane.

125
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.330
I actually fished my Invisalign fucking trays out of the trash from my fucking

126
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:55.730
building.
Uh,

127
00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.830
and I'm so ashamed I had to admit it,
but that's how dedicated I am.

128
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.110
Not Jesus Christ.
They seemed fine,
man,
you know,
then,
you know,

129
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.430
I don't spill anything.
Nothing it in my mouth.

130
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.810
Been wearing them for like a day or self dare to everything seems fine.

131
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.690
I know it's embarrassing,
but you know what,

132
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.260
what was I gonna I didn't want to fucking jump to the next God damn tray.

133
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:26.030
I wasn't going to wait for another one.
I want this thing to be over.
All right.

134
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.620
This is how wars are won.

135
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.740
So there you go.
Now everybody knows.

136
00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:38.300
Now the world knows how disgusting it fucking human being.
I am,

137
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.370
um,
whatever or dedicated,
there's all different ways that you can look at it.

138
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.750
So anyways,
I uh,
I flew back on jet blue,

139
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:51.260
which is the shit and Lisha TV isn't working and everybody else's is.

140
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:54.530
That was my experience,
but I still had the,
I still had the,
the,
you know,

141
00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:00.250
did share bed thing going on and I just sat there sort of stretching my fucking

142
00:09:00.651 --> 00:09:03.200
arm cause uh,
the right shoulder is actually sit,
sit,

143
00:09:03.201 --> 00:09:04.820
starting to come around it starting to come around.

144
00:09:04.821 --> 00:09:09.590
But I've been so goddamn busy.
I missed all the Olympics.
Oh,
what's the matter?

145
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.163
She upset.

146
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.810
<v 3>Okay.</v>

147
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.030
<v 1>Now it's getting that time.
It's getting to be that time of night.</v>

148
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.500
I had a busy day today,
but I've been so busy.
Um,

149
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.070
hang on one second.
Hang on one second.

150
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.650
<v 4>Wait,
are
we are</v>

151
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:36.290
ani,
you keep it down a little bit in there.

152
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.133
What are we doing?

153
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.570
<v 3>Oh God.
Oh,</v>

154
00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:51.770
there was a crisis is

155
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.790
<v 1>it was a crisis.
So my wife is getting my,</v>

156
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:58.740
oh Jesus.
You're going to hear a crying.

157
00:09:58.741 --> 00:10:03.380
She just had a fucking little episode there.
You got my daughter's ears pierced.

158
00:10:03.381 --> 00:10:05.750
I didn't want to fucking do it,
but you know,
whatever.
I guess it's,

159
00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:07.760
this is a good time to do it cause they don't remember.

160
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.320
I don't know why she has to get her ears pierced it fucking one years of age.

161
00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:16.310
Like when she read in the news,
you know,
is she presenting at an award show?

162
00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:21.080
Can we just get clip on ones?
What is the rush?
So anyways,

163
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.710
now nia has to clean around,
you know,
where they pierce the years,
you know,

164
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.340
so she just went to do that.
She's given Lola bath and Lola doesn't like it.

165
00:10:28.341 --> 00:10:31.130
So she tried to duck out of the way and she put her face right in the water

166
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.570
and she did not enjoy it.
So anyways,
um,

167
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.080
what was I gonna say?
Oh sorry,
I missed all the Olympics,
but I get a,
I,

168
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.990
I thought the gold medal game for the ladies was tonight and hockey.

169
00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:52.640
Evidently it was last night.
And congratulations to the women,

170
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:58.260
the United States of America for winning the Olympic hockey gold medals for the

171
00:10:58.521 --> 00:11:01.850
first time since I think like 1998 or some shit.

172
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.430
I don't know what that's right.

173
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.700
And when we couldn't have beat a better opponent,

174
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.970
and I'm not talking about the Russians.
All right.

175
00:11:10.971 --> 00:11:14.120
We only compete with the Russians when it comes to blowing up the whole world.

176
00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:17.930
But when it really comes down to hockey,
okay,

177
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.880
it's all about Beaton Canada.

178
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.960
And I actually called because I called up a Vancouver today cause I'm doing some

179
00:11:23.961 --> 00:11:26.830
gigs up there and I did the radio and they were all fucking upset.

180
00:11:26.831 --> 00:11:28.670
They were upset about it.
That's what I love Canada.

181
00:11:28.671 --> 00:11:33.320
That's how much they care Dave and care about women's hockey,
you know,

182
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.660
which I date them.
Not that I have anything against it,
but you know,

183
00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:37.960
down here it's all about the men.
What are the men don't,

184
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.210
we don't care what women are doing unless it's porn or they're playing

185
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.030
volleyball and that's basically how it works in this country.

186
00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:48.950
I'm not saying that's right.
Okay.
But that,
that is how it is.

187
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.560
Okay.
Women's tennis every once in a while does,
you know,

188
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.950
I dunno.
I Dunno why.
I Dunno why it is.
Okay.
It's just the way it is.

189
00:11:57.951 --> 00:11:59.230
It's all about that stuff.
So wait,

190
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:03.470
I call these people up up there in Vancouver over there and they're all like,
oh,

191
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.300
you bed called the end of the game.
Oh,
I loved it.
I was,
I loved it.
I was at say,

192
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.290
we want the fucking matter.
Next we're taking the,

193
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.530
the Canadian men's team is next.

194
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.420
I know we already lost,
we got bounced out by checklists about Kia,
I believe.

195
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.230
I believe that's what happened.
I bet the fucking men's gold medals tonight.

196
00:12:24.231 --> 00:12:25.610
I probably should be watching that shit.

197
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.880
But at this year kind of suck because they didn't let the fucking NHL players

198
00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:31.790
play.
DNHL was like on TV,
are going to make some money,

199
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.690
not see Olympics on your continued to escape.

200
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:37.643
<v 3>Okay.</v>

201
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.160
<v 1>I actually,
you know something,</v>

202
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.490
I'm not even give the NHL Shit for doing that because they actually did it for a

203
00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:45.190
couple of Olympics in a row.
They would just shut down the league,

204
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.370
you know what I mean?
And just eat all that money.
And I can tell you right now,

205
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:51.280
there's no fucking way the NFL would have done that if the,

206
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:56.080
if football became a fucking Olympic sport,
right?
There's no way they'd be like,

207
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.440
they'd be a normally on zip players if they're going to get concussed,

208
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.670
they are gone the door by they make us the money.
Okay.
Um,

209
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.140
have you,
we'll give you some scallops.
Um,
so anyways,

210
00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:12.130
congratulations to the u s a women,

211
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.480
but winning the gold medal in hockey and uh,

212
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.060
I'm going to sing them a song now.
All right.
Congratulate

213
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.720
<v 5>play shins to you.
You be the Canadian lady.</v>

214
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.810
<v 6>We,</v>

215
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.730
<v 5>you kicked their far as,</v>

216
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:33.820
even though I miss a gay Bi and I wanna hear about those bad fucking calls at

217
00:13:36.091 --> 00:13:39.690
the end of the gay.
Quit your whining.
You fucking May.

218
00:13:39.691 --> 00:13:43.350
Pecan are whores are better than yours.

219
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.580
I didn't mean to say whore.
I needed a word,
but

220
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.450
<v 1>one civil syllable,</v>

221
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:54.451
go fuck yourselves and congratulations to the lady,

222
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.083
sorry,

223
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.830
<v 5>to the [inaudible] states of America.</v>

224
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.030
<v 1>How is that does that better than Fergie?
Um,</v>

225
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.860
I actually didn't think that for you.
One was that bad.

226
00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:13.470
I actually watched it on the Jim and Sam Shelf and I thought it was going to be

227
00:14:13.471 --> 00:14:17.430
horrible.
I didn't mind it.
She kind of did.
I read,
I ran one fucking word.

228
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.420
You know what I mean?
I forgive him.

229
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.680
And the rocket's red glare.
Rare,
rare,
rare,
rare.
She did something like that.

230
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.280
I didn't know what that part was about the rest of it.
I thought it was fine.

231
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.870
I thought it was totally fine.
Um,
anyway,

232
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.110
speaking of me to,
uh,

233
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.100
I just feel like for me too,
one second to happen.

234
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:42.810
I just feel like for me,

235
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.823
<v 3>mmm.</v>

236
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.500
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

237
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:51.480
I was in fucking in a cab in Times Square and I'm looking out the windows up and

238
00:14:51.481 --> 00:14:55.560
there was this woman with a fat ass and thick thighs wearing in black leather

239
00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:59.850
pants is tight as possibly could be just walking up the street.

240
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.070
And I know that women,
well,
it's,
it's just like,

241
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:10.130
it's like what are you doing in Times Square?
Are you Outta your fucking mind?

242
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.390
Why don't you just hang raw meat around your neck and jump in shark infested

243
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:16.190
waters?
You know,
it's some point,

244
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.600
at some point you gotta be looking out for yourself,
right?

245
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.490
You know,
she looks fucking amazing,
but she was by herself late at night,

246
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.970
New York City Times Square.
Is that what you want to be wearing?

247
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.430
She was probably a cop.

248
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.390
Maybe they got a bunch of meat to cops out there right now.
You know,

249
00:15:37.391 --> 00:15:40.780
trying to get the me too guys.
Is that how it works?
I don't fucking know.

250
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.361
What do you want from me?
Okay.

251
00:15:42.361 --> 00:15:46.780
I just saying a fucking the wrong national anthem congratulating the women and

252
00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:50.710
accidentally called him.
I called them horse,
right.

253
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.300
It just,

254
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.540
I'm sure somebody with hairy legs is going to get upset by that and then that's,

255
00:15:55.541 --> 00:15:57.940
that's how it works.
Okay.

256
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.450
I know there's a lot of fucking problems out there right now.
And they'd be,

257
00:16:01.451 --> 00:16:05.950
and people don't like being being a,
what they call it a hoot.

258
00:16:05.951 --> 00:16:07.300
And Hollering at him,
why they call it,

259
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.130
they call it a woman walks down the street and every guy's like,
oh,

260
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.770
give me a note.
But what do they call it?
Cat Call and all that shit.
You know,

261
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.100
Shit.
That's upsetting.
All right?
But you know,

262
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.620
I would be lying if I didn't tell you it was a little jealous.
Okay.

263
00:16:20.621 --> 00:16:22.270
Cause when I walked by a construction site,

264
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.530
all I hear is the sound of men working.
Um,

265
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.610
you don't think I'd like a standing ovation every once in a while.
Hey,

266
00:16:33.611 --> 00:16:37.260
nice ball,
freckles.
You know,
every once in a while get a little shout out,

267
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:41.850
make it put a little pep in your step.
Um,
I'm fucking with you.

268
00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.370
I don't have any advertising this week.
Can you believe it?

269
00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:48.410
After all the bullshit I've said yes.
Slowly back in a way,

270
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.900
slow.
Lebeck the way I should adjust my tone.

271
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.150
Um,
guess what my fucking drum room is finally done.

272
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:00.411
I built,

273
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:05.411
I had this person build me a drum room in the fucking gay Raj and uh,

274
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.440
turned out that was still just a little bit too loud.

275
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.070
I learned a lot of things like 30 decibels

276
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.750
is basically the sound of a silent room with like a light on like the little

277
00:17:19.751 --> 00:17:23.440
buzz of a,
of a,
of a light bulb.

278
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:24.880
All right,

279
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.880
that's the 30 decibels queef thing is 35 I read on all of this.

280
00:17:30.761 --> 00:17:31.594
Okay.

281
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.610
Like 50 to 55 it's like a light rain,

282
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:42.690
you know 70 I forget what the fuck that is.

283
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.370
And the nineties when it starts getting annoying.

284
00:17:45.371 --> 00:17:50.371
So my room was built and I was still at 70 right outside the garage.

285
00:17:50.481 --> 00:17:52.760
He walked up the driveway.
You couldn't hear it too much,

286
00:17:52.761 --> 00:17:55.100
but I was like I can't add that.
All right.

287
00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.600
So I had somebody else come in and they added this extra shit to it.

288
00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.520
And then today it's just like,

289
00:18:01.521 --> 00:18:06.521
it's the shit right outside the garage door is basically the sound of a light

290
00:18:06.681 --> 00:18:09.530
rain and you go up to drive,
you can't even fucking hear it.

291
00:18:09.531 --> 00:18:12.530
So I have the dream bucket drum room.
I can,

292
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.000
if I could play at two in the morning,

293
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.190
and even when you stood outside the garage,

294
00:18:16.191 --> 00:18:18.680
all you can really hear is like the snare drum and it just sort of sounds like

295
00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:22.280
somebody has a stereo one a little bit low.
It's fucking perfect.

296
00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.650
It's fucking perfect.
So,
um,

297
00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:30.200
that's gonna be what's gonna keep me sane,
I think over the next few years,

298
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.553
um,

299
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:37.120
as the orange guy in the hairless fat dude sit there pointing fucking missiles

300
00:18:37.161 --> 00:18:39.200
at each other,
you know what I mean?

301
00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.080
Trump and what's his face?
[inaudible] face?

302
00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.500
I Dunno.
Why don't they just go fucking hang out already?
You know,

303
00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:54.220
have one of those fucking online dates,
you know what I mean?

304
00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.020
Just discuss like oppressing people,

305
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.340
just kind of compare notes,
you know,

306
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.160
and then maybe they could like combine what it is that they both do.

307
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.400
Amount of my fucking mind.
People,
I don't pay attention to anything.

308
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.720
Somebody actually said to me,

309
00:19:11.721 --> 00:19:15.470
did you hear about so and so with like the Russians and all that shit?

310
00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:18.590
And I was like,
I'm going to be perfectly honest to you.
I did not.

311
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:24.200
Oh did they do a probe and what's going to happen?
Is he going to get impeached?

312
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.200
And then what?
Let me guess.
It's going to go to the fucking,
the,

313
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:31.760
the place where all the people in the suits sit and then they're going to need

314
00:19:31.761 --> 00:19:34.610
three cores of a vote and nobody Republican will vote for it.

315
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.800
And then it'll still be an office.
Isn't that what's going to happen?

316
00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.020
I seem to remember that's what happened that time.
That guy took this again.

317
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:48.330
Oh slick willy.
All Slick Willie.
Um,

318
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.600
anyways,
yeah,
I don't pay attention to hear that shit.
It's just not a,

319
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.070
I don't find it interesting and that weird.

320
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.550
The fact that I actually find sports interesting,

321
00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.890
which are real but don't really matter,

322
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.650
but the actual shit that's going on,

323
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.830
like this guy could get in that level of trouble.
I don't give a fuck.
Um,

324
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.010
I hope people keep sending me Shit in about the,
uh,

325
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:18.350
about gun control or no gun control or a reasonable gun control.

326
00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:19.850
Cause I find all of that fascinating.

327
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:23.600
I guess all the kids are going to get together and they're going to do some big

328
00:20:23.601 --> 00:20:26.010
protest.
And I like how people who are into guns and going,

329
00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:31.010
these kids are coached that totally being coached.
Right.
Um,

330
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.310
that's the exact thing that nobody needs,
you know,

331
00:20:34.311 --> 00:20:37.510
I'm not saying that both sides aren't going to try to like fucking finesse their

332
00:20:37.511 --> 00:20:38.344
whole

333
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.620
angle or whatever and that there won't be somebody coached by you.

334
00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.350
You should probably listen to people.
I,
you know what I want to know,

335
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:49.240
I could become fascinated with the fucking a or 50 right?
I mean,

336
00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:51.490
I might buy one before they get fucking band just to,

337
00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:55.870
because it would be worth money.
You know what I mean?
They could,
people buy like,

338
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:58.300
you know,
when they reissued the Jordan's and people buy them,

339
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:00.580
they don't wear them and they just stick them in the back of the closet.

340
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.720
So just one day they can just bust it out and everybody's like,
Oh shit.
Right.

341
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:09.510
Um,
I want to know people have ar 15th.

342
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.190
I know that as people listen to this podcast,
she got one.
Let me ask you this,

343
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:15.910
what do you do with it?
Okay.

344
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.940
I know what I would do with it.
Okay.

345
00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:22.770
I wouldn't take it down to some stupid fucking gun range.
And like,
dude,

346
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.870
like target practice,
that's not what you get that gun for.

347
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.800
You get that gun to reenact safely the end of Scarface.

348
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.660
So if I had an ar 15,
what I would do every year around Halloween,

349
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.870
I wait a couple of days after when everybody's Pumpkin's are getting all mushy

350
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:39.670
and I would just knock on the door and be like,
Hey,

351
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.960
do you want me to take that off your hands?
I'll take your role.
Pumpkin's right.

352
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:48.040
You know,
put up a sign old pumpkin's recycled here.
Right.

353
00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:52.270
And I get a whole fill up the whole back end of my truck with a bunch of old

354
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:55.610
pumpkin's.
Right.
And then I would fucking,
uh,

355
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.560
I just take them out in some field.
Right.
I got an ar 15,
you know,

356
00:21:59.561 --> 00:22:02.920
I live in the middle of nowhere,
right?
I fucking take them out into a field.

357
00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.180
I put wigs on him and shit.
Maybe a little suit underneath,

358
00:22:07.181 --> 00:22:10.360
depending on how far I wanted to get with it,
you know?

359
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.820
And then just fucking light him up.

360
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.270
Other than that,
what the fuck the avid for?

361
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.340
That's like these assholes who get like a Ferrari and are they just drive it up

362
00:22:24.341 --> 00:22:27.580
and down the sunset strip.
It's like fuck head.
Put It on a truck,

363
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:31.750
take it to a track.
It drive it the way it's supposed to be driven,

364
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:38.860
you know?
I mean,
that's what I would do.
That's what the fuck.
I mean he got it.

365
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:42.970
Don't you want to do that?
You can't tell me somebody anonymously right in.

366
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.780
Just tell me the stupidest fucking thing you did with your ar 15 just having
fun,

367
00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.790
you know?
Or if my neighbor piss me off when they weren't around,

368
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:55.330
I just fucking shooting into the side of his fucking above ground pool.

369
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.010
Get some you mother fucker.
Right.

370
00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:07.810
I would do silly shit if I earn an ar 15 I wouldn't hurt anybody else.

371
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:11.230
And destruction of property,
you know?
Yeah,
I would do that.
But you know,

372
00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:12.790
women are allowed to get away with that.

373
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.500
Take their fucking ex husband Shit and light it on fire of fucking cheating

374
00:23:17.501 --> 00:23:21.340
boyfriend.
Throw it out in the fucking yard.
You know,
stab it all up.

375
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.640
Cops come down laughing.
They don't give a fuck.

376
00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:27.820
That woman goes back in the house,
they don't care.
They don't give a fuck.

377
00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:32.950
Why can't a man go out every once in awhile and just shoot somebody who's above

378
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:35.620
ground pool within their 15 is that,
isn't there a re well,

379
00:23:35.621 --> 00:23:40.480
you got to make sure there's nobody in it,
right?
It's also a waste of water.

380
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.790
It's irresponsible.
But you know what I mean?

381
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:47.430
He can't tell me if there was a youtube video of it would want to see it right

382
00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:53.100
then,
then scroll down and look at all the comments like,
oh,
wastewater much.

383
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.560
And then it means that d flat liberal Snowflake,
a Mofo,

384
00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:01.800
you live out there in Hollywood and that foot and desert.
A couple more comments.

385
00:24:01.801 --> 00:24:06.120
Somebody drops the n word.
You know the basic conversation on Youtube,

386
00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:11.250
right.
Um,
that's what I do anyways.

387
00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:16.560
Uh,
so I don't have any fucking advertising.

388
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:21.240
I don't have any fucking emails and I got six more minutes to go.

389
00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.700
Can he do it?

390
00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.750
Can you think of something that he can fucking talk about for the next six

391
00:24:27.751 --> 00:24:30.990
minutes?
What about why do,
why do I gotta think about something?

392
00:24:30.991 --> 00:24:31.621
What about fucking,

393
00:24:31.621 --> 00:24:35.340
you just sitting there listening to us in the next six minutes of your life is

394
00:24:35.341 --> 00:24:36.340
going to go by.
You're going there,

395
00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:39.030
you're never get back and you're going to sit there.

396
00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.230
You're going to sit there waiting for me to try to come up with something to
say,

397
00:24:43.231 --> 00:24:46.980
aren't you?
That's where you're at.
Um,

398
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.300
a non gone,
not nine gun people.
All right.

399
00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.500
The people want to get rid of all the guns.
They want to get rid of all the guns.

400
00:24:55.501 --> 00:24:58.260
Can you do that?
Is that turning to like get rid of all the straws?

401
00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:02.940
Like how would you do that?
It's like they're out there.
People come in and again,

402
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:07.740
these are all his straws.
I have,
how would you know that?
You know,

403
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.740
straws are made out of plastic.
Everybody,

404
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.770
which means evidently they never break down.

405
00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:21.470
So just think while the way the first time you went to fucking Mcdonald's,

406
00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:23.810
you're like,
well God,
cocoa chocolate shake.

407
00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.160
Just think of the fact that that cup is long gone because it was made out of

408
00:25:28.161 --> 00:25:28.994
paper.

409
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.990
But that Straw that you fucking drank out of with that little thing on top,

410
00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:37.820
it's still fucking there.
It's somewhere.
It's in the ground.

411
00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:40.730
It's out in the fucking ocean,
just swirling around.

412
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.940
I the type of Shit I think about,
you know,

413
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:49.120
with all these minimalists people gone not fucking minimalist.
It's like,

414
00:25:49.121 --> 00:25:51.550
what do you do with all your shit?
You just throw it out.

415
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.560
So now you don't have to look at it.
It all went somewhere,
right?

416
00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:00.490
That's why you got to have a fucking yard sale.
Jesus Christ.

417
00:26:00.491 --> 00:26:04.360
Just open yourself up to a bunch of fucking cheap costs.

418
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.100
Oh,
maybe they're environmentalist.
Some of this shit that they have out there,

419
00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:09.311
you know,

420
00:26:09.311 --> 00:26:12.890
and this is somebody who fucking as Invisalign out of a goddamn communal trash

421
00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:16.720
bin earlier this week is literally going to sit here and judge people that go to

422
00:26:16.721 --> 00:26:19.450
yard sales and try to find gems.

423
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:24.050
You know what's really going away as those stores where you just have that

424
00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:28.160
fucking like a hoarder and he says all this random shit and they are like a

425
00:26:28.161 --> 00:26:32.960
fucked up lamp and an old cash register next to like a propeller for some

426
00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:36.700
fucking plane,
you know.
But with those kinds of store I get none.

427
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.850
I antiques things beyond antiques.
It's like modern antiques.

428
00:26:40.851 --> 00:26:42.740
It's just plastic shit.

429
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:47.920
You know that nobody fucking wants this to be a guy down the street from me.

430
00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:52.180
Dealt all in speakers and shit.
Crazy fucking dude.
Crazy,

431
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:53.670
crazy motherfucker.

432
00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:58.690
I went in there one time and I had these iPod speakers that I wanted fixed and

433
00:26:58.691 --> 00:27:03.550
he started telling me that he had this revolutionary way that he was going to

434
00:27:03.551 --> 00:27:05.320
record music.

435
00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:07.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

436
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.270
<v 1>And he was trying to tell me,
you Simon and Garfunkel as,</v>

437
00:27:11.271 --> 00:27:16.271
as an example saying nobody really knows what they sound like even if they've

438
00:27:17.361 --> 00:27:22.160
heard the recordings because they weren't recorded correctly because Garfunkel

439
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.950
is like a foot taller than Paul Simon.

440
00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:30.650
So if he was standing in the room,
his voice would be coming at you from,

441
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:35.540
you know,
eight to 12 inches higher than Paul Simon's voice.

442
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.860
And the way that that would reverberate around the fucking room would be what

443
00:27:39.861 --> 00:27:43.490
they actually sounded like.
Whereas when they go to record them,

444
00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.420
it makes them sound like they're both the same height and I'm just sitting
there,

445
00:27:47.421 --> 00:27:49.700
listen to this guy go,
this guy's out of his fucking mind.

446
00:27:49.701 --> 00:27:51.770
But he also might be on to something.

447
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.270
So he was trying to explain to me how the fuck he was going to record that.

448
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.700
And I was just like,
you know what?

449
00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.490
As much as this guy seems like he's out of his fucking mind,

450
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.740
he still ended this shit.

451
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:08.450
He is going to be able to fix these speakers and you know what,

452
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.570
he took my speakers,
you know,

453
00:28:11.571 --> 00:28:15.860
and set them behind the cash register or whatever where I just saw a wall of

454
00:28:15.861 --> 00:28:20.190
speakers
anywhere from fucking,

455
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.210
I dunno,
10 years old to 40 50 years old,
all behind him.

456
00:28:24.211 --> 00:28:27.720
It was like Sanford and sons junk yard and it was all fucking speakers

457
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.710
and a,
sorry like got that dumps sound effect.

458
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.110
It's the only way I can hear if somebody fucking,
since we get texts,

459
00:28:36.111 --> 00:28:40.620
that gum shoe,
wham.
Anyway,
so he takes my speakers and you know what?

460
00:28:40.621 --> 00:28:43.680
He does a never fucking fix them and I kept calling him up.

461
00:28:43.681 --> 00:28:46.440
He didn't even know where the fuck they were and I never got him back.

462
00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.920
And he used to drive by a store for two years being like that fucker's got my

463
00:28:49.921 --> 00:28:53.820
speakers and he's going to find one of these cancer yard sales to give him like

464
00:28:53.821 --> 00:28:57.600
25 bucks for it.
One of these days when I got the time,

465
00:28:57.601 --> 00:29:00.620
I'm going to go in there and be like,
hey man,
never.

466
00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:04.530
We took my speakers and you didn't give me a piece of paper or any sort of proof

467
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.480
that actually gave you speakers and you've talked to another 3 million people

468
00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:11.220
since I came in the place.
Well guess what?

469
00:29:11.221 --> 00:29:13.550
I'm back without any proof that I'm telling you.

470
00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:15.870
You got my speakers in here somewhere and I want them back.

471
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.290
I was so meaning to do that and I never,
I never got around to it.

472
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.790
And then one day I drove by and it was just,
it just didn't exist anymore.

473
00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:30.520
So you know what that means,
right?
And let's just go,
I took all that shit.

474
00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:35.020
My fucking speakers right now,
probably in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,

475
00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:39.820
floating around of floating around and they swirling and swirling and eventually

476
00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:43.120
they're going to run into that,
that I hadn't Mcdonald's

477
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.390
and now you know the rest of the story.
Sorry,
did that take a six minutes?

478
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:53.770
29 seconds ago?
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking bull shit.

479
00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.670
I got to get caught up in the Bruins.
I guess we,
uh,
we made some,

480
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.010
we made some moves at the trade deadline.

481
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.310
We got some defenseman from,
uh,
the fuck is it from the,
the,
the,

482
00:30:06.311 --> 00:30:10.450
the New York ranges,
I guess said just packing it in.
They said to hell with it.

483
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.910
Um,
does that mean they're going to get rid of,
Hey Henrik Lundqvist,

484
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.130
you know,
they can't do that.

485
00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.250
I mentioned the overhead of that guy fucking shipping all those suits to some

486
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:23.190
other town and where would he wear?

487
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.200
Can you imagine if Henrik lundqvist ever got fucking,
well,

488
00:30:27.201 --> 00:30:30.490
he got traded to like Columbus,
you know,

489
00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:35.050
with all these Gq GQ clothes walking around fucking Columbus.

490
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:37.720
Then I'll give a shit.
They barely give a shit about hockey out there,
right?

491
00:30:37.721 --> 00:30:41.320
They're all about the io state Buckeye's now.
That's actually a good hockey town.

492
00:30:41.321 --> 00:30:44.530
I went out there one time for a Redwings game playoff game and it was fucking

493
00:30:44.531 --> 00:30:49.480
great.
Columbus and Nashville,
crazy fence,
great fence.
However,

494
00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:52.060
not exactly the kind of place where you can,

495
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:56.860
where Henrik lundqvist can wear some of his fancy suits,

496
00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.193
you know,

497
00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:03.910
that's a pretty confident move to buy suits like that as a professional athlete,

498
00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:05.120
you know,
or you probably think of,

499
00:31:05.121 --> 00:31:07.870
well maybe I'll just wear them in the off season or it helped light the
Columbus,

500
00:31:07.871 --> 00:31:11.380
but I would live in New York cause God dammit I'm going to,

501
00:31:11.381 --> 00:31:12.250
I'm going to wear these buckets.

502
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.380
Suits or maybe you wear the suits in Columbus scene.

503
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:18.250
Did you show people what the next level looks like?
Um,
I don't know.

504
00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.410
I'm talking about he,
they're not even thinking about trading him,

505
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.440
but all I know is we've got a defensemen out of it and we gave up a couple of

506
00:31:23.441 --> 00:31:27.400
draft picks of whatever and I dunno,
the Bruins are like,
hey,

507
00:31:27.401 --> 00:31:30.250
they got the second most points and I'd barely watched the game.

508
00:31:30.251 --> 00:31:32.770
They shit cause I got a little kid and I'm edited into the fucking series.

509
00:31:32.771 --> 00:31:36.640
I did four hours today with the Great Laura dern.

510
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:41.620
She absolutely fucking murder today.
Um,
she does the voices.

511
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:46.540
Sue Frank's a wife and I'm,
I'm telling you this season's coming together.

512
00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:48.280
I think I'm going to talk a little shit here.

513
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.170
I think this might be our best season.

514
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.920
I think this is the season where we finally break out of the pack and we get

515
00:31:56.201 --> 00:31:59.950
invited to one of them fucking shows and they give us some shiny shit.

516
00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:03.520
Then we all go up in a big group hug,
you know,

517
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.760
and we enjoy it for eight seconds before they take it away from us and they say,

518
00:32:09.031 --> 00:32:12.870
get back in that room.
And do it again.
Um,

519
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.990
all right.
That's the podcast.
Sorry.
It got a little fucking nuts.

520
00:32:16.991 --> 00:32:21.130
They're just trying to fill time.
I said a lot of things.
Uh,

521
00:32:21.131 --> 00:32:23.230
I meant very little little of it.
Okay.

522
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.230
But that doesn't matter in this day and age.

523
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:31.150
What your job is to do now is to take it seriously and start talking about how

524
00:32:31.151 --> 00:32:36.151
offended you were in ignore real problems and talk about this podcast as if it

525
00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:41.960
sets swirl a on the belt.
All right?

526
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:43.320
That's the function has tier.

527
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:51.160
Sorry,
my brain's fucking fry.
Um,
that's the Thursday afternoon,
uh,

528
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.470
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
Have a great weekend.

529
00:32:54.471 --> 00:32:57.920
You can't enjoy this music.
And A,

530
00:32:57.921 --> 00:33:00.110
I'll do the whole Trump thing with the index finger and the thumb.

531
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.070
Then make a loop points here.

532
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:04.880
And then we're going to play a little bit of throwback fucking Thursday podcast

533
00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.030
after podcasts from Thursday,
from this year or years before.

534
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:12.740
I have no fucking idea.
Um,
oh,
by the way,

535
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.540
I almost forgot to say,
are you going to bed?
Little Cutie.

536
00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:22.670
Hi.
Oh,
I you adorable.

537
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:28.680
Is it even legal to be that cute?
Nia,

538
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.360
you know,
something as far as business goes,

539
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.700
you ever see somebody make a business move and you think,

540
00:33:34.701 --> 00:33:38.750
why didn't I think of that?
All right,
here's my latest one.

541
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:44.030
Do you know Barstool sports?
Yes.
Yeah,
they're huge.
They're huge.

542
00:33:44.031 --> 00:33:48.050
Do you know what they bought?
There's some sort of like fighting,

543
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.670
I forget even what it,
what it's even called.

544
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.870
It's just like this regular person fight night.

545
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:58.910
It started in I believe Virginia and just regular people go up there just

546
00:33:58.911 --> 00:34:01.160
throwing haymakers beaten the s side of each other.
Sorry,

547
00:34:01.161 --> 00:34:05.360
my kids here beating the crap out of each other and it's just,
you know,

548
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:10.110
haymakers very little technique and then they got,
hey Matt.
Hey make maker is

549
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.040
haymaker is actually an expression that came from farming and I can think of was

550
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:19.400
when you took the sickle and you just swung from behind you to chop it down.

551
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:23.750
I looked it up one time.
Um,
so anyways,
hey,
why don't you take the microphone?

552
00:34:23.751 --> 00:34:28.400
I've got this all,
I got this,
I got this all set up and now I'm trying to,

553
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.490
okay,
on this one.
So she has an unplugged,
let me just finish this real quick.

554
00:34:31.491 --> 00:34:35.750
So these regular people come in and the fights are crazy cause these people are

555
00:34:35.751 --> 00:34:38.570
just swinging for the fences and eventually somebody connects to somebody.

556
00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.630
I'm not saying they're all bad,
but it's just like this crazy,

557
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:46.210
it's like it's like a bar room brawls.
Right.
Okay.

558
00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:50.870
So barstool sports bought it and then they put it on paper view.

559
00:34:50.871 --> 00:34:53.930
It's like if you,
if you order it early it's 10 bucks.

560
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.630
Who isn't going to buy that and how aren't you going to get your money back?

561
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:04.360
Are those people that coming in to fire?
Do they get paid?
They get paid.

562
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:07.010
I don't know what they get.
I don't think there's one to be on TV.
I have no idea.

563
00:35:07.011 --> 00:35:09.260
I don't know how it works.
I don't care about them.
It's all about me.

564
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:14.150
10 bucks near.
Okay.
I'm ordering that.
I don't know when the next one is,

565
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.220
but I am ordering that and that's one of those things.

566
00:35:16.221 --> 00:35:17.480
What that is going to turn into,

567
00:35:17.481 --> 00:35:21.870
like it's going to be like the regular person UFC and I guarantee you sometime

568
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:22.180
that's,

569
00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:26.930
that's going to sell for tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars

570
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:30.010
calling it right now.
Well all right.

571
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:35.540
No this no we regular,
I'm at a Rogan said one time,

572
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:37.980
if you just driving down the street and UPC to

573
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.890
<v 5>people beat the crap out of each other,
you'd slow down and look at it.</v>

574
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.210
What did you rather wash professionals who have trained and have techniques and

575
00:35:45.211 --> 00:35:48.660
have moves?
Oh,
I wish I were appreciate both.

576
00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:53.190
Yeah.
Yeah,
because this is the thing,
even though they're not professionals,

577
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:55.710
they're really fighting and people really get knocked out.

578
00:35:56.170 --> 00:36:00.150
[inaudible] and this is the thing.
There's none of that.
As far as I could tell,

579
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:04.170
just the clips I watched,
there's none of that ground and pound strategy.

580
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:08.820
It's just people.
It's like,
yeah,
cause they're all dislike.
No they're not.

581
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.810
I would not want to get hit by any of the punches.
I saw thrown right.

582
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.860
Is this like that?

583
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.510
But shit that like Kimbo slice used to do like at the backyard,

584
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.590
like guy,
all I saw was highlights.
I was just,

585
00:36:22.591 --> 00:36:26.880
it was like Jerry Springer.
If you edit it out all the crappy,

586
00:36:26.881 --> 00:36:30.570
you just had the fights.
Yeah.
Well cool.

587
00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.820
All right.
Maybe you're the wrong demographic.
Yeah,
I could.

588
00:36:35.821 --> 00:36:39.480
I finally was saying something positive on the God damn podcast.

589
00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:43.560
Um,
I,
I couldn't be less interested and yeah,

590
00:36:43.561 --> 00:36:46.050
you don't want to get one of us smoke a joint.
Just watch that.

591
00:36:46.051 --> 00:36:48.760
I'll have a little sippy cup and just,
yeah,

592
00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:52.050
I mean I guess if I'm gonna Watch UFC or boxing and stuff,

593
00:36:52.051 --> 00:36:54.870
I guess I could get into that.
I don't know.
They're just saying,

594
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.850
here's what we're going to do.
The next one of those,
we're going to rent it,

595
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.090
we're going to rent and then you're going to come back on the podcast and talk

596
00:37:00.091 --> 00:37:04.200
about it please.
All right.
That's fair.
You know what?
It is nice.

597
00:37:04.201 --> 00:37:08.270
Nice baby.
It feels exploitative to me.
That's why I asked.

598
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.740
The people who are doing it are getting paid.
I'm sure they get paid.

599
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:14.760
Probably have some tough man person.
The end of it,
cause it's like there's there,

600
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:17.460
they're selling it for like $10 each.
These people,

601
00:37:17.461 --> 00:37:19.500
they're whole thing is that they're like not professional,

602
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.530
so it's not like they're going to go on to have a career and fighting.

603
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:25.440
So what are they?
Here's the thing,
cause if they win,

604
00:37:25.441 --> 00:37:27.630
make sure she doesn't take that and make sure she doesn't take that.
Yeah,

605
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.910
she's pulling it out and I don't think she can get it out.

606
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:31.943
<v 3>Oh,</v>

607
00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:34.750
<v 5>she turns around.
Can you just thank you.</v>

608
00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.370
She pushed it all the way into the keyhole.
Amen.

609
00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.340
<v 3>All right.</v>

610
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.200
<v 5>I don't know.
Well I was excited.
I was excited about you.</v>

611
00:37:46.201 --> 00:37:48.900
You've just got to see it.
Yeah.
It's,
it's still people fighting.

612
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:55.030
Is it like people?
Yeah.
The people in the UFC get,
do they get exploited?

613
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:57.550
Do you think they making the lion's share of the money?

614
00:37:57.551 --> 00:37:59.200
They're the ones taking the concussions and all that.

615
00:37:59.201 --> 00:38:01.990
There's been plenty of fighters in the UFC that they're talking about the same

616
00:38:01.991 --> 00:38:05.780
thing.
Yeah.
All right,
thanks.
They're getting paid something.
Yeah.
But you know,

617
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:10.030
you get to be on TV and it's your,
when you know you're knocked somebody out,

618
00:38:10.031 --> 00:38:13.480
you're on TV and that's pretty cool.
Okay,
sure.
Cool.

619
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:15.623
<v 3>Okay.</v>

620
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:19.010
<v 5>You know what it's like,
it's like American idol.
None.</v>

621
00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.530
Most of those people had no business singing on television,

622
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:25.460
but what they do and they get to do that.
Right?
Okay.

623
00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:28.970
Is that all right?
Yeah.
But do they have a referee?

624
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:33.320
Like do they have somebody that's like,
don't kill him?
Really?
You just,

625
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.280
why are you coming at like a mother?
Who Cares?

626
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.410
<v 3>We don't know these people.
It's entertaining.
Yes,</v>

627
00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:40.870
there's a referee and there's two hilarious announcers.

628
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.140
I have become really soft since having the baby.

629
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:47.680
It's been a beautiful thing to say.
I'm so soft now.
I'm just like,
oh,

630
00:38:47.681 --> 00:38:52.350
that's not nice.
Don't do that.
Like,
you know,
as you're doing a pushup,
she's uh,

631
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.740
she's doing something.
Are you ready?

632
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.860
You ready for bed?
Qut and not at all.
And she's,

633
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.340
she's loves being in here.
And if she does,

634
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.210
what are you talking about?

635
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:14.520
<v 1>You just cracked herself up.
What are you thinking about?
All right.
This is,</v>

636
00:39:14.521 --> 00:39:16.050
this kid is too cute.
I got to get off here.

637
00:39:16.051 --> 00:39:19.140
I've got to say goodnight to my girl here.
I'm all right.
Thanks for coming here.

638
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:22.170
Let's see.
Here's the deal.
The next one that comes on provided I'm not working.

639
00:39:22.171 --> 00:39:25.800
Even if I'm working,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm ordering it.
Okay,
we're going to record it.

640
00:39:25.801 --> 00:39:27.030
We're going to watch it.
All right,

641
00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:31.610
and I want to hear what you had to think about it.
I'm 100% wine to do that.
Okay?

642
00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:35.640
I won't cuss.
I'm going to those guys.
Whoever those guys are that,

643
00:39:35.641 --> 00:39:40.641
that run that thing that day going to make an effing fortune off of that.

644
00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.690
I think it's going to,
I think it's going to blow up.

645
00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:43.873
<v 3>Okay.</v>

646
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:50.950
I'm not as excited about this as you were excited about to see Black Panther and

647
00:39:52.201 --> 00:39:54.960
you're literally doing the exact opposite.
All right,
that's the podcast.

648
00:39:54.961 --> 00:39:57.960
Thank you for listening to everybody and I will talk to you on Monday,

649
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:07.493
Huh?

650
00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:40.440
Thank
you.

651
00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.130
What

652
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:11.810
<v 5>is happening in sports?
Can we ate ESPN?
Can we,</v>

653
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:16.910
you know,
100% access?
Can you dial it back down to like maybe 40% access?

654
00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:22.700
Can you stop interviewing fucking coaches,
Fox and whatever.

655
00:41:22.701 --> 00:41:26.870
NBC as a jogging off to feel trying to think of their halftime adjustments.

656
00:41:26.871 --> 00:41:31.520
Can we just stop fucking doing that?
I don't give a fuck.
Nhl.

657
00:41:31.521 --> 00:41:35.890
Can we stop interviewing players inbetween the fucking,
uh,

658
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.033
periods?

659
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:41.270
Is it sitting there still out of breath from their last shift and that fucking

660
00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:45.860
drop a fucking sweat hanging off their nose looking like snot that they have to

661
00:41:45.861 --> 00:41:49.250
keep wiping and then it of it comes back again.
Can we just enough?

662
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.330
I don't give a fuck.

663
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:51.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

664
00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.790
<v 5>What happened in that first period?
I just watched the first period.
I know.</v>

665
00:41:54.791 --> 00:41:58.840
What happened.
What do you think you have to do in the second period?
Oh,

666
00:41:58.841 --> 00:42:03.420
baby score.
More goals.
Vinnie.

667
00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.590
Nhl players listening to this.
Uh,

668
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:09.230
I'll give you a free podcast tee shirt even though you're going to get fine.

669
00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.660
Probably a hundred grand by the league.

670
00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:13.780
Is there any way you could wipe your nose on the blouse of the person who's

671
00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:18.310
interviewing you in between periods?
Just reach out and grab that tie.

672
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.380
Just Dab your eyes,
you know,
I got nothing to give you.

673
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:24.640
You're a millionaire athlete,
but could you just do it for the,

674
00:42:24.641 --> 00:42:26.760
just for the fucking ridiculousness of it?

675
00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:28.643
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

676
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.520
<v 5>Like they're not going to interview you after the fucking game.</v>

677
00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:32.600
Like I have to have it.

678
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:36.620
They got that fucking guy who stands down there and what looks like the penalty

679
00:42:36.621 --> 00:42:38.450
box in between the fucking benches,

680
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.750
whatever the fuck his name is.
Prince fielder,
the hell's his name.

681
00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:46.750
Prince Harry standing down there.
Well ty,

682
00:42:46.751 --> 00:42:50.990
it's released that ate up down area ice.
Like why do I need to hear that guy

683
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:56.350
or bash has got to stand up for three periods of his loafers for,

684
00:42:56.351 --> 00:43:00.440
we got hammer toes by the end of the year.
Less access.

685
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:02.360
Do you think you could do that?

686
00:43:02.361 --> 00:43:05.570
Do you think he could actually start a sports network that could compete with

687
00:43:05.571 --> 00:43:08.420
ESPN and the whole thing is less access

688
00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:14.490
the no miked up players.
You just fucking,
uh,

689
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.310
just trim the fat.

690
00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:18.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

691
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.130
<v 5>Can I just go back to watching Bob Lubell at the end of the news and just seen</v>

692
00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:23.330
five minutes of the shit.

693
00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:27.110
Can I just see that as he sits there in a fucking blaze up,

694
00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:31.070
you know,
every once in a while it takes a day off and new me comes in.

695
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:33.830
Bob Knew Maya.
I miss those days.

696
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.620
<v 3>I really miss those fucking days.</v>

697
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:22.710
Got It.
I

698
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:25.400
<v 5>gotta I gotta talk about the on southwest.
So,
um,</v>

699
00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:29.850
I went to Albuquerque this weekend and I had a fucking unbelievable time.

700
00:44:29.851 --> 00:44:34.851
I have not been back there since all those wonderful episodes of a breaking bad

701
00:44:34.891 --> 00:44:39.840
that I got to be on.
And um,
you know,
I was going to go on a hike.

702
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.310
That's what I wanted to do.
I wanted to do that.
But uh,
you know,

703
00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.050
Nia had some friends out there.

704
00:44:46.051 --> 00:44:48.870
We were going to go to lunch and you know how that is,

705
00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:52.950
it'll only take like an hour.
That's three hours,

706
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:58.380
you know,
so I'm just like,
I'm too fucking old too.

707
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.303
Um,

708
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:05.540
I'm too old to fucking hike and have a social event in one day and then actually

709
00:45:06.151 --> 00:45:09.990
give any sort of a decent,
decent,
uh,
performance.

710
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.410
So I was like,
all right,
fuck it.
I'm not going to go on the hike.
I'll go over.

711
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.710
And we met,
um,
I met his friends and they were,
they were awesome.

712
00:45:16.711 --> 00:45:20.700
Fucking cooked up burgers the middle of the day,
you know,

713
00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:23.370
those homemade burgers that are way bigger than the ones that you get in a

714
00:45:23.371 --> 00:45:26.070
restaurant and then you eat them and uh,

715
00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:30.960
you don't feel 60 have some stomach afterwards.
Fucking phenomenal.

716
00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:34.530
And uh,
the people's house,
we went over to,

717
00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:37.170
they had all these bears and that type of stuff and I stayed away.

718
00:45:37.171 --> 00:45:40.410
I was a good boy,
so I could have the show,
but I know myself at this point,

719
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.980
so I still that I can't,
I can't do all of those activities in one day.

720
00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:46.530
So I just decided like,
uh,
all right,

721
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:49.140
I'll just do the social thing and I'll chill out.

722
00:45:49.141 --> 00:45:51.840
Which was actually really cool because I've been to Albuquerque a bunch of times

723
00:45:51.841 --> 00:45:55.290
and I never got to ride around and uh,

724
00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:59.940
see any of it and uh,
it's really,
really fucking cool placement.

725
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:05.070
Really,
really cool.
Um,
so anyways,
so that night I was at the,
uh,

726
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.600
the 66 casino,

727
00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:11.830
meaning basically route 66 and it's one of the coolest stuff.
And Casinos I've,

728
00:46:11.831 --> 00:46:14.730
I've seen,
I'll try and have some images up for I,
you know,

729
00:46:14.731 --> 00:46:18.540
you try to take pictures of those casino lights and it never comes out on your

730
00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:23.220
cell phone.
At least the one that I have,
the four S.
Um,

731
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.830
but it was really cool,
like the hotel had like that,
you know,
uh,

732
00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.350
the route 66 sign instead of the 66,
it just said hotel,

733
00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:35.170
it was all lit up and then,
you know,
it's native Americans own it.
And then the,

734
00:46:35.171 --> 00:46:38.070
the,
the arrows pointing in where to go.

735
00:46:38.071 --> 00:46:41.340
We're literally like arrows and they looked like they were stuck into the
ground.

736
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:45.210
They will all lit up.
It was fucking bad ass.
It was bad ass.

737
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:50.370
And then I got to play in the name of the theater was the legends theater.

738
00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:57.080
I played a place called the legends theater.

739
00:46:57.081 --> 00:46:58.910
I remember I was doing some press for it and they said,

740
00:46:58.911 --> 00:47:03.860
what can people expect when they come down to the legends theater?
And it's like,

741
00:47:03.861 --> 00:47:05.480
well,
they should expect to see a legend.

742
00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:10.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

743
00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:14.010
<v 5>It shouldn't expect to see me.
Oh,
fresh out of the fucking horse stable.</v>

744
00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.400
Where do I go?

745
00:47:15.401 --> 00:47:20.401
Is this the way to the grade road is not going to be allowed people I'm scared.

746
00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:22.540
Uh,
fortunately it all went,

747
00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:27.160
it went great and a fucking great people out there,
man.
Once again,

748
00:47:27.161 --> 00:47:31.300
and this was another place that was supposed to be a stop on the,
uh,

749
00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:36.200
Billy red state tour.
And,
um,
I dunno for any comics who are listening to this,

750
00:47:36.201 --> 00:47:40.190
don't buy into that horse shit that these are fly over states.

751
00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:42.140
They're beautiful places to go.

752
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:47.290
And the people are ridiculously appreciative that you showed up this site and

753
00:47:47.451 --> 00:47:50.630
they always say the same shit.
Can you tell this person and tell this person,

754
00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:51.441
you know,

755
00:47:51.441 --> 00:47:54.320
they're always asking for Jim Norton and all these guys that I know from the

756
00:47:54.321 --> 00:47:58.010
opie and Anthony show telling them to come out there.
You know,

757
00:47:58.011 --> 00:48:02.810
we liked comedy too,
so I pass the word on to them and a lot of them have,

758
00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:05.670
uh,
started coming out,
which is cool.
Um,

759
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.230
I just hope that they don't become a and an old jaded like when you play the

760
00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:14.700
bigger cities and they just like whatever,
whatever man,
you know,

761
00:48:14.701 --> 00:48:17.610
I got other things to do,
man.
It was great.

762
00:48:17.611 --> 00:48:19.470
And they actually bought a bunch of DVDs,

763
00:48:19.471 --> 00:48:22.740
which is phenomenal because I got a bunch of them sitting in my garage.

764
00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:25.140
I feel like in my garage is filled with fucking laser discs.

765
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.120
I've got to get those things out of there.
Um,
anyways,

766
00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:33.840
so,
oh,
the dushawn southwest,
sorry,
I'm all over the place today.

767
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:39.510
So we're flying back,
um,
quick flight back out in 45 minutes.

768
00:48:39.511 --> 00:48:42.750
Fucking phenomenal.
And uh,
you know,
the southwest people,

769
00:48:42.751 --> 00:48:44.760
they always try to be funny,
put a smile on your face.

770
00:48:44.761 --> 00:48:48.030
Most of the times they're not.
And this guy was actually kind of funny.

771
00:48:48.031 --> 00:48:48.930
Then we go to land,

772
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:53.990
we were landing in Los Angeles and this fucking asshole gets on the fucking mic

773
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.980
and it starts going,
you know,
he's like going welcome to Los Angeles,

774
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.490
which is a a

775
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:08.250
interesting place.
Yes.

776
00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.580
Very interesting.

777
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.890
Kept doing this weird laugh and I'm looking at near,
first of all,

778
00:49:16.891 --> 00:49:21.480
it sounded creepy as fucking hell.
Um,
I don't want to be homophobic,

779
00:49:21.481 --> 00:49:24.750
but the guy sounded gay,
you know,
the gay accent.

780
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:28.470
And so I used to do a joke on this,
like gay people come from all 50 states,

781
00:49:28.471 --> 00:49:32.340
yet they kind of all have the same accent,
which isn't true.

782
00:49:32.341 --> 00:49:35.610
But generally speaking,
there is a gay accent,
which makes no sense.

783
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.070
How did that joke?
That's how that joke used to go.

784
00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:42.320
Like if you were gay from Alabama,
we were like,
I bought ad.

785
00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:46.790
Really luck to suck your Dick.
Like that's the way you should sound.

786
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:52.340
Just do a stereotypical redneck accent with my stereotypical gay action.

787
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:54.230
Right.
But they thought,

788
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:58.400
I grew up in Alabama and let's just say I'm not going back there.

789
00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.920
It's probably more valuable.
You know what the Fuck I'm saying?

790
00:50:00.921 --> 00:50:01.940
That's what the guy sounded like.

791
00:50:01.941 --> 00:50:04.670
So I'm just sitting there on the backhoe and like,
did a,
you know,

792
00:50:04.671 --> 00:50:07.490
this guy get blown in west Hollywood and somebody stole his wallet.

793
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:11.440
Did he want to be the next Jim J uh,
uh,
buffets,

794
00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:13.880
whatever the fuck the guy's name is from too close for comfort.

795
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:15.530
I don't know what it's fucking deal was,

796
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:18.640
but I'm just sitting there on my head going yet another,

797
00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:21.110
the most fucked up thing about living in Los Angeles.

798
00:50:21.111 --> 00:50:25.090
I've never lived in the city where everybody trashes it.
Okay.

799
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.700
Everybody just shits on and that kills me about that.
That's the,

800
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.830
this is the only fucking city where you could do that.

801
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:33.080
I guess you can kind of make like a gambling joke,

802
00:50:33.081 --> 00:50:36.530
but you can actually land in Los Angeles.
Not give a fuck that everybody,

803
00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:40.370
their lives on the plane for the most part lives there and then just shit on it.

804
00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:46.160
MMM.
I fucking drove me nuts.
Drive me fucking,

805
00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.230
I say interesting places to sick.
Well,
what the fuck are you doing?

806
00:50:49.231 --> 00:50:53.430
What makes you such a good person?
What happened?
You hear,
Huh?

807
00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.430
What Sit-com did you test for?

808
00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:00.780
And he got to coked up the night before and you fucking blew it.
Ah,

809
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.670
what were we supposed to be on?
Will and grace.

810
00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:07.170
I'm sorry.
In order this,

811
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:11.030
I'm defensive of La at this point because I have to live out here because this

812
00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:13.520
is the fucking business on it.
I don't have to,
but you know,

813
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:18.580
it makes life a lot fucking easier to be where everybody else is in this

814
00:51:19.051 --> 00:51:23.970
business.
You know,
if I was into fucking computers,
I go move up to,

815
00:51:23.971 --> 00:51:28.200
why the fucking Nah,
the valley up there,
the silicone valley,

816
00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.920
which for the life of me,
I don't know what,
why do they call it silicone,

817
00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:36.450
isn't it?
What's in fake titties?
Is it?
I don't fuck.

818
00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:50.510
<v 3>Whoa.</v>
