00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.700
Hey,
what's going on is bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday.

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.700
Um,
September 21st,
2050.
What's going on?
How

3
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.580
well you do?
I just yelled at like,
you know,

4
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:22.581
like your mom would yell down the street Jaffrey calm.

5
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.670
They're fucking

6
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.110
that shit when you could play outside,
you know,

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.700
without adult supervision because people weren't afraid that there was a fucking

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.330
pedophile behind every God damn tree.
Remember that shit?
Your mom would come out,

9
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:40.770
we had like a dinner bell.
He knew.

10
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:44.880
And your 12 brothers and sisters would come running up to fucking driveway like

11
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:45.714
cattle.

12
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.820
<v 0>You don't remember that shit?
Yeah.
You guys all just fucking,</v>

14
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:55.410
you just the days started the day fucking started.
Right?

15
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.590
And your mother would just open the door,
like,
get the fuck Outta here.
Get Out.

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.310
That was like parenting back then during summer vacation.

17
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.280
They just opened the door and they let you outside.

18
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.570
They did the same thing with their dogs.
There was no leash law or anything.

19
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.610
You just had like neighborhood dogs.

20
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.170
They just fucking walked around and asked the same thing they did with kids.

21
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:20.760
They just open the door,
get out,
go outside and play,
come back at lunch.

22
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.440
Right.
You have to lunch,
you go back out again,

23
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.080
you know?
And that'd be all right.
Come back out.

24
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:29.850
Come back when the street lights come on,
come back,

25
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.440
you know when it gets dark or whatever.
Watch your little brother.
That was it.

26
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.000
I think parenting was a lot easier back in the day cause you were allowed to

27
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:43.720
just send your kids outside.
So having them standing in the backyard,

28
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.010
like those fucking llamas,
you ever see that shit?

29
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:49.100
You drive down the street and you see a fucking Lamoney.

30
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.990
There's so many goddamn lamas in this country.
I don't understand it.

31
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.950
They're not indigenous to this country and I don't know what,

32
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.780
how people are making money off of
you don't know.

33
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.120
You don't ever see that shit in the grocery store.
Do you?

34
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.280
You know Lamstar Lama steaks,

35
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.200
Miss shanks
showing that fucking guy in a,

36
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:21.200
with the shrimp boat in that fucking movie with Tom Hanks when he had this

37
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.320
George Stile in haircut Yoseph,
Yoseph stolid Forrest Gump.

38
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.503
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

39
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.870
<v 0>I know.
What the fuck am I tell?
Yeah,
you can just fucking send your kids outside.</v>

40
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.930
All right.
All right.
Get outside.

41
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:38.550
You fill them up with sugary cereal and you just set them outside and then you

42
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:41.820
went out,
shot.
You ran around and he just ran into other kids.

43
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.100
Then somebody had a book of matches and then you just let the woods on fire did

44
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.810
basically,
I mean,
I'm fast forwarding through most of my childhood experiences,

45
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:54.450
but that's basically what you did.
They just fucking let,
yeah,

46
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.080
we to say it's pretty cool to me.

47
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.200
Fewer a stay at home mother.
Right?
You got four fucking kids.

48
00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:08.520
You go in and out of your mind.
You're going out of your mind,
right?

49
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.960
Your husband goes to work every day.
What's he do?
He's a milk man.
He's a postman.

50
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.390
He's jumped in that has a man at the end of it,
right?

51
00:03:15.391 --> 00:03:18.000
Because jobs were for fucking men back then.

52
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.430
<v 2>Right?
They added,
figured out,
hey,</v>

53
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.650
<v 0>sugar tits.
You stay.</v>

54
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.350
You stay home with the kids.
Hey,

Talk me.

55
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.660

You shut your face.
Quit your client.

56
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.330
Quit your crying in front of the kids.
You fucking stay off.
All right.

57
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:45.950
What are you crying about?

58
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.840
Did I buy you an oversize jar?
Fluffer nutter in the cabinet.

59
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.400
What are you going to do?
Huh?

60
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

61
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.680
<v 0>You got to grab some fucking white bread out of a bag.</v>

62
00:03:57.681 --> 00:03:59.180
You've got to take off the twisty tie.

63
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.430
That's a be a big party of fuck fucking day.
You're bitching of up.

64
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

65
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.440

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.300
<v 0>It's in fucking glass bottles.
Do you how much pressure that is,</v>

68
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.090
<v 2>right?</v>

69
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.020
<v 0>He just fucking leaves her at home.
He goes off to work.</v>

70
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:23.470
He's a fucking Milkman or a postman is somehow we can that you can afford a

71
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:28.460
house visit.
Bankers were actually semi regulated back then.

72
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

73
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.750
<v 0>The upper 1%.</v>

74
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:33.930
The fucking loaded takes up there to fuck each other at these parties were an

75
00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:37.380
owl.
Masks and and what and whatnot.
Something with horns on it.

76
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.893
<v 2>Right?</v>

77
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.230
<v 0>Walking around wearing sheets.</v>

78
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.593
<v 2>MMM.</v>

79
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.380
<v 0>These fucking guys.
The middle class.
You could actually,
you could,</v>

80
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.840
you could have a stay at home mother.
Stay at home wife.

81
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

82
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.410
<v 0>So you went off to work and your fucking truck and you silly little uniform</v>

83
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:58.520
looking like a character actor on Alice,
right?

84
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.180
And then she fucking stayed hall.
What does she do?
Everybody gets up.
She's like,

85
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.560
Jesus Christ,
right?
She takes out a pack of fucking Paul Miles.
Some cools,

86
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.780
maybe some Marlboro's,
whatever the fuck she said.
Some Winston's the fuck.

87
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.640
What the fuck did women's smoked back then?
You know,
it's so funny.

88
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.260
There's so many comics out there that do jokes about what,
uh,

89
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.390
black people smoke pile miles and cools and all that.

90
00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:26.391
That I don't even know why people will Marlboro's Winston Salem lights.

91
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.610
Is that what it was?
My parents never smoked.
I don't fucking know.

92
00:05:32.611 --> 00:05:35.920
So whatever you'd take out a cigarette,
right?
So you got your bathrobe on,

93
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.500
you get,
you fucking wait all on one leg with your hand on the same hip,
right?

94
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.430
Steering yourself up a cup of Joe.
Oh,
you're a maniac.

95
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.950
Kids come down the stairs or up the stairs and maybe halfway up the stairs if

96
00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:49.500
you looked,
and then they're on a landing at the front door.

97
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:53.200
If you lived in a split entry,
I don't fucking know.

98
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

99
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.000
<v 0>I remember I stood the split entry.
You know what I mean?</v>

100
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.710
The split entry is the House version of you ever see those people that have like

101
00:06:02.711 --> 00:06:06.850
really long torsos they have the torso of a six foot four person,

102
00:06:06.851 --> 00:06:10.600
but the legs of a jockey.
You know what I mean?

103
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.390
That blue collar body,
I always tease rich Vos.

104
00:06:13.391 --> 00:06:17.620
He's got that body long ass fucking torso on these little doll legs,

105
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.480
right?
Just that blue collar body you just built for picking up boxes.

106
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.130
You don't even have to bend over.

107
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.890
You just fucking your arms almost dragging on the fucking ground.

108
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.240
All the split entry.
That's the house version of that body.
So anyway,

109
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.600
she makes you a fucking fluffing other sandwich.
None ad that's the lunch.

110
00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:37.060
I'm sorry.
She fucking pulls out.
What do you guys want?

111
00:06:37.061 --> 00:06:41.440
You want Frankenberry cocoa bear chocolate berry.
No count.

112
00:06:41.441 --> 00:06:45.190
Shocki love Frankenberry or booberry,
whatever the fuck he had.

113
00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:48.790
It turned the melt,
the color of the goddamn cereal.
You ate that shit.

114
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.670
She let you watch a couple of cartoons.
She finishes off for fucking cigarette,

115
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.360
stomps it out and that fucking ass trade and that's it.
All right.

116
00:06:58.361 --> 00:07:03.240
Go outside and play.
Go outside and play.
What the fuck does she do out there?

117
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.280
Kids are outside running around meeting other kids,

118
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.530
playing with matches,
right?
Stealing,
playboys.
Simple Shit.

119
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.330
There's no cell phones.
There's no iPad.
There's no fucking overhead.

120
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

121
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.640
<v 0>What did you have to buy your kid for toys back then,
then there was nothing.</v>

122
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.250
Tonka truck where that set you back?
Talk a truck and a book of matches.

123
00:07:30.251 --> 00:07:32.080
I mean you were set for the fucking summer.

124
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.070
So anyway,
I don't want to fuck up talking to him and get on the stick.

125
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.133
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

126
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.120
<v 0>Oh cause I screamed the podcast like a mother yelling and that's right down the</v>

127
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:46.100
fucking street.
You know,

128
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:48.980
nowadays you got to sit there and you got to watch these little fuckers.

129
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:53.630
24 seven make sure they don't bump into anything.
They all have cell phones.

130
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.040
You know what I mean?
Like they're working on Wall Street.
You know,

131
00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.870
I don't fucking know.
Who knows?
They'll probably,

132
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:01.850
they'll stop microchip and I'm soon.
Do you know,

133
00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:05.330
somebody sent me an article about this,
uh,

134
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.700
this healthcare provider somewhere over in Europe that was giving out this band

135
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.850
that had a microchip in it and it tracked everybody that was in,

136
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.960
they were testing it out to track people that were insured by this health care

137
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:21.794
provider.

138
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.630
And it basically tracks your activity throughout the day,

139
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.020
you know,
and if you would just sitting around like a lump of shit,

140
00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:32.300
they were like,
all right,
this fucker's going to have a heart attack.

141
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.440
We're raising his rates and um,

142
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.040
it's totally that George Orwell,
uh,
is it Orwell?

143
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.790
What do you make the popcorn now?
That was Orville Redenbacher.

144
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.220
I don't fucking know that Orwellian,

145
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:51.221
how many is that hacky think slippery slope into the Orwellian something or

146
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:53.540
other.
Right.
And um,

147
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.360
they were saying that they tried this fucking basically microchipping people
out.

148
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:05.420
Microchipping people out tested,
tested,
trying the micro chipping people.

149
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:06.500
Right.

150
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.150
And that they said they had an overwhelmingly positive response to it.

151
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.390
Well,
of course she did.
Of course you did.

152
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.290
Because most normal people would be like,
you want to do what?
Go Fuck Yourself.

153
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.770
That's creepy.
I don't want you to do it and then guess what?

154
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.710
They're not in the study.
Then what do you do?

155
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.890
You find some fucking jerk offs that don't have two nickels to rub together and

156
00:09:29.921 --> 00:09:30.754
you say,
listen,

157
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.140
we'll get you a fucking ham sandwich with some cheese on it and what do you,

158
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:35.840
whatever kind of chips you want with it.

159
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.530
If you wear this fucking bracelet like all you gotta do is where the Brad saw

160
00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:44.360
you've got to do this stupid and in the end they get a sandwich out of it.

161
00:09:44.361 --> 00:09:45.800
Of course you're going to say they enjoyed it.

162
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.580
This is the thing about getting microchipped in the future.

163
00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:52.580
It's inevitable that it's going to happen because isn't as much as people are

164
00:09:52.581 --> 00:09:56.570
going to fight.
It is many people that fight it and don't want it there.

165
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.830
You cannot.

166
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.030
You cannot overcome the sea of mouth.

167
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:06.090
Breathe in fucking buffalo wild wings,

168
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.130
fucking morons that are out there.

169
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:14.060
There's way too many of them and they will walk towards the light every fucking

170
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:15.481
time.

171
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:20.160
All they got to do is flip on the switch or whatever direction they want to hurt

172
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:24.540
to go in.
And they just start walking towards it.
Ah,

173
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.770
they just start walking towards it.
They don't give a fuck.

174
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.730
And this is the greatest thing about all of it.

175
00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:35.700
If you're one of the people running shit right,

176
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:41.300
is the mouth breathing morons opinion is held with the same level of,

177
00:10:43.171 --> 00:10:44.004
uh,

178
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:49.370
of importance as somebody who actually a intelligent or informed,

179
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.760
you know what I mean?
The guy who sits at God though,

180
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:58.680
why do I give a fuck if they know whether or not I had a slurpee and not eight

181
00:10:58.681 --> 00:10:59.514
or not?

182
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:06.290
That's just as much fucking right and just as much say as someone,

183
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.860
excuse me,
who's,
who's fucking informed,
you know,

184
00:11:11.861 --> 00:11:16.110
that's when they take the constitution seriously.
And then everybody has rights.

185
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.740
That's when the upper 1% listen to it and they go,
hey,
hey,
wait a minute.

186
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.850
Don't be an elitist.
Right?
But then when it comes to the other shit,

187
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:25.680
when it's advantageous on the other,
right,
then,

188
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.710
then all of a sudden not on out where you know,

189
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.670
you don't have as much say as I do.
Right.
You know,
it was on a plane.
Right.

190
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.141
I'm in Austin,

191
00:11:34.141 --> 00:11:36.960
Texas right now getting ready to do two wonderful shows here in this,

192
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.410
this bat infested toe.
Um,

193
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:42.303
<v 1>okay.</v>

194
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.690
<v 0>They,
uh,
somebody had left in the pocket,</v>

195
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.770
in the seat in front of me right seat,

196
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.780
but whatever the seat pocket in front of me.
This book on.
Yeah.
A,

197
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.140
that was just dedicated to yachting.

198
00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:56.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

199
00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.510
<v 0>And uh,
I got to tell you,</v>

200
00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:02.780
it was one of the most fascinating fucking magazines I've ever read read in my

201
00:12:02.781 --> 00:12:07.340
life.
I don't know shit about the,
see,
I don't know shit about boats,

202
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.700
but just looking at this magazine,
knowing that,

203
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.940
that there's like people that read that magazine getting to be like,
yeah,

204
00:12:16.941 --> 00:12:21.710
you know what?
I'm going to buy that yet.
So when the yacht world,
what I learned.

205
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:22.750
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

206
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.760
<v 0>Okay.
Okay.</v>

207
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.980
And this is someone who doesn't know the difference between Port and starboard.

208
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.130
I'm going to guess port his right hand.
No,
left left is port right?

209
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:33.964
A starboard.

210
00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:34.790
<v 1>Okay,</v>

211
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.020
<v 0>because you read left to right,</v>

212
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.780
but they always make right above left in a religious way.
Right.

213
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.720
He sat on the right hand of the father to go either way.

214
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.470
Plows up front,
starts in the back port and starboard.

215
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:57.510
I had a fucking though,
I think ports left.
Sounds really quick.

216
00:12:57.511 --> 00:13:01.470
Port left devil right.
Fuck you.

217
00:13:01.471 --> 00:13:06.470
You don't current star board.
Oh,
that's what we all are.
Um,
anyways,
we plow ahead.

218
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.200
Hit the whole fucking thing was about the size of your God damn boat.

219
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:11.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

220
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.600
<v 0>Who's got the biggest fucking boat and how big can these boats get?</v>

221
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.050
So right now,
the biggest one out there,
I've already forget the name of it.

222
00:13:19.051 --> 00:13:21.690
And that's another thing too.
The names of the boat,
uh,

223
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.780
just as entertaining is trying to understand how somebody has $300 million for a

224
00:13:27.121 --> 00:13:30.420
fucking boat.
It does it immediately get out of it.

225
00:13:30.421 --> 00:13:35.421
It's a fucking boat that is just an absolute money pit.

226
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.390
The second shoe by that fucking thing,
there's nothing you can do with that boat.

227
00:13:39.391 --> 00:13:43.590
To him,
I guess you could rent it out,
you know,
to Jay z and Beyonce,

228
00:13:43.591 --> 00:13:46.590
God knows they're always out on a fucking boat,
right?

229
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.030
Dressed in all white linens.

230
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.920
How could you make fucking money off of that?

231
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:59.130
This thing was like the biggest one they had was almost 600 fucking feet.

232
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.350
And what I learned is that basically a yard cost a million a meter.

233
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.640
Now we're going from standard to metric,

234
00:14:07.641 --> 00:14:10.760
and I've just completely fucked myself here.
But as far as I know,

235
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:11.800
<v 1>okay,</v>

236
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.633
<v 0>that</v>

237
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:13.550
<v 1>okay</v>

238
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.750
<v 0>fucking boat.</v>

239
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:15.530
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

240
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.800
<v 0>But basically it costs like what?</v>

241
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.840
What's Seinfeld made when the entire series went into syndication,

242
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.010
all of that money,

243
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.750
half a billion dollars for a fucking boat.

244
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.980
And then you got to have like a and see me like a hundred people just to run it.

245
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.830
That's the funniest shit.
So even when you're on it,
like,
honey,

246
00:14:37.831 --> 00:14:41.790
let's just take the boat out.
Just you and us,
you know,
let's reconnect.

247
00:14:41.791 --> 00:14:46.140
Just you and us.
You,
Anna sent a hundred other fucking people,
right?

248
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.260
It's like you're doing an episode of the love boat,

249
00:14:49.261 --> 00:14:52.390
but nobody else showed up except for the fucking,
the whole crew.

250
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.690
It's got to be weird.
No one,
they're all listening to you fucking right.

251
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.810
Some guy,
you know,
200 fucking yards away,

252
00:15:04.811 --> 00:15:09.220
wherever the fuck he is with a big dumb tall hat making you a sandwich.

253
00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:15.010
It's got all this extra food just for you and your wife.
Um,

254
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.870
anyways,
I was reading that and I was just like,

255
00:15:16.871 --> 00:15:21.700
how the fuck could anybody legally make enough money?

256
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:27.790
And I was trying to think of the ways,
well,
you could start Facebook.
Even then,

257
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.430
that dude from Facebook,
what is he worth?

258
00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:35.950
Let's say he's worth $3 billion.
Are you going to blow half a billion on a boat?

259
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.510
That's still a sizable chunk of your fucking fortune.

260
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

261
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:48.380
<v 0>You know,
it was the coolest part of the magazine was on the front.
Like,</v>

262
00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:51.050
you know,
it was somebody's personal magazine obviously.

263
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:55.340
And there was where like the address was supposed to be,
it was,

264
00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:59.110
was taken away,
was torn off.
And I was like,
well,

265
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.880
I was wondering like where they lived,
you know,

266
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:09.950
six,
six,
six,
Illuminati court,
Connecticut,
someplace in Connecticut.

267
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.920
I always feel like the Illuminati lives in Connecticut.
All right.

268
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.400
And then I like helicopter into Manhattan,
Blah Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

269
00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:18.140
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
No,
it doesn't make any noise.

270
00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.000
They got some stealth helicopter.

271
00:16:21.001 --> 00:16:22.610
So I'm really going off the fucking rails here on it.

272
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.700
So you've got to be asking yourself,
well built,
well,
you know,

273
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.020
you sit in there crying poor house.

274
00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:29.990
Why the fuck are you sitting in the section of the plane that uh,

275
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.600
has yachting magazines left behind?
You know why?

276
00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:36.790
Cause I did 23 years on the fucking road and I got miles bay,

277
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.360
I got status,
I got status.
Fuck you.

278
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.610
I flew in the back of the plane for 20 fucking years with you.
God Damn animals.

279
00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.810
Okay.
And I get the fucked up left knee to prove it.

280
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:54.180
I'm never sitting back there again with you animals.

281
00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:58.260
I swear to God I'm never doing it again.
You know why?

282
00:16:58.261 --> 00:17:03.210
Cause I think I'm too cold.
I'm too good for you.
Anyways,
let's get to the,

283
00:17:03.211 --> 00:17:06.900
uh,
let's do some reads here.
Now I got to fucking type in my God damn password.

284
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

285
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.980
<v 0>Uh,
the fuck I hate.
I,</v>

286
00:17:11.981 --> 00:17:16.660
you got to have some capitals in that till you know,
cause then what,
you know,

287
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.240
then it takes for fucking ever and ever and ever.
And then he'd say,

288
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.810
well how the fuck is that?

289
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.180
Every time I go to type in my password is fucking wrong.
Okay.

290
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.480
Nope.
And I left it on the capital's this how long it takes for you,
type them.

291
00:17:30.481 --> 00:17:33.610
I'm still trying to do it and now I'm sitting in,
see,

292
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.340
this is how fucking dumb I am.
And I sit at the front of the plaintiff.
No,

293
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:42.290
<v 2>that should give you hope.
Did I do it right now?
Wait a second.
All right.
Capital.</v>

294
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.560
No capital.
That'd be go no capital.

295
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.820
Come on bill.
Come on bill.
Come on.
Give me a winner.

296
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.930
Gimme a winner and hit it.
Yeah.
All right,
let's do some advertising here.

297
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.370
Sorry about that.
Um,
all right,
everybody,

298
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:03.720
dollar shave club.

299
00:18:03.721 --> 00:18:08.130
Everyone stopped shaving with an old ray.

300
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.360
So it's gross.
It's disgusting.
You're better than that.

301
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.771
All right.

302
00:18:13.771 --> 00:18:17.340
Why are you torturing yourself with the gross old blade every week after week,

303
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.780
Huh?
What's wrong with you?

304
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.150
Don't you love yourself or it's probably because you don't want to shell out 20

305
00:18:26.151 --> 00:18:31.090
bucks for a pack of new ones,
do you?
Your face isn't worth 20 bucks.

306
00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:32.141
Well,
you know what?

307
00:18:32.141 --> 00:18:35.800
The people at Dollar Shave Club had revolutionized the way men shave.
Okay.

308
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.410
You're too cheap to save your face.
Well,

309
00:18:38.411 --> 00:18:41.650
here's dollar Shave Club does save the day with dollar shave club.

310
00:18:41.651 --> 00:18:46.360
You can shave with a fresh blade.
Oh,
it smells delicious as often as you want,

311
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.600
because they deliver a whole sleeve of amazing race is just for a few bucks a

312
00:18:52.091 --> 00:18:53.230
month,
a whole sleeve.

313
00:18:53.231 --> 00:18:58.150
Everybody just like that sleeve Oreos he ate last night except their razors.

314
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.200
The razors are so good.
Millions of guys have joined.

315
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.210
I think it's because it's so cheap personally.

316
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.630
Even the billion dollar razor corporations are freaking out,

317
00:19:07.631 --> 00:19:09.760
but instead of lowering their bloated prices,

318
00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:14.020
they're trying to fool you into milking the same blade for an entire month and

319
00:19:14.021 --> 00:19:17.140
that's gross.
They've price gouged us for long enough.

320
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:22.300
Never go back to squeezing weeks and weeks of Shave shaves out of disgusting,

321
00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.760
rusty out of a disgusting rusty blade.

322
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.570
Joined Dollar Shave club and use a fresh blade whenever you want.

323

legal zoom,
everyone.
You know what?

328
00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:58.750
You shouldn't have to choose a random lawyer who charges expensive hourly rates

329
00:19:58.751 --> 00:20:02.590
when you need legal help,
but the legal system is so complicated.

330
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.100
What other choice do you have when you need help with your business or want to

331

protect your family?
Well,

333
00:20:13.031 --> 00:20:16.270
office with a bunch of books behind me and right at this point is the part where

334
00:20:16.271 --> 00:20:20.140
I stand up.
You know,

338
00:20:28.241 --> 00:20:32.410
the speaker here to confidently navigate the legal system.
Legal Zooms,

339
00:20:32.411 --> 00:20:34.480
not a law firm.
And that's how they,

340
00:20:34.481 --> 00:20:37.540
that's how they provide such great value.

341
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.940
It's not a lot for him.
Then why do you call yourself legal zoom?

Uh,
let's talk football up,

386
00:23:22.251 --> 00:23:25.530
up,
up,
uh,
Bodo Gudu Gudu

387
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:36.630
Gudu.
Gudu Gudu too.
Um,

388
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.470
what a satisfying weekend that was for me as a football fan.
Everybody,

389
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:46.270
first of all,
Saturday night I went to a,
went to a wonderful

390
00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:49.360
<v 0>wedding and a afterwards we went to the after party.</v>

391
00:23:49.361 --> 00:23:53.320
We were in no fucking sports bar and um,

392
00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.203
<v 1>okay.</v>

393
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.790
<v 0>And we,
it was in,
we were on the island of Nantucket and uh,</v>

394
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.680
I got to watch from the third quarter on,
I got to watch Mississippi,

395
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.980
all miss a beat.
Alabama,

396
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.140
the dre events tonight.

397
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.420
I got to watch them beat them men and I don't know why it is so much fucking fun

398
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.900
to watch Alabama lose.
Like I've said,
I don't hate them.

399
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:22.370
I actually liked Nick Saban,
but there's something about them you don't have.

400
00:24:22.371 --> 00:24:25.700
It's just like how everybody hates the Patriots.
I get it.
I get it.

401
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.570
We've won too much.
We're fucking annoying.
You know,

402
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.960
I actually met somebody that was,
you know,
we were talking about all that,

403
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:36.020
that patriots cheating shit and he brought up some other fucking great ones.

404
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.660
Evidently there's,
there's pictures of Jerry Jones,

405
00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:42.860
the owner of the fucking Dallas cowboys getting off a party,

406
00:24:42.861 --> 00:24:47.300
bucks hammered with like the head guy of all officiating in the NFL.

407
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.380
And I just laughed thinking if there was a picture of Robert Kraft doing that,

408
00:24:51.381 --> 00:24:54.710
how long that fucking story would last.
Um,

409
00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.410
that and that time the cowboys got caught with a,

410
00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:03.110
for collusion with the Redskins to keep their free agents signings down so they

411
00:25:03.111 --> 00:25:06.620
could feel better teams.
I mean,
it just,
you know,
that's fine.
That's not cheating.

412
00:25:06.621 --> 00:25:11.330
It's all good.
It's all good.
It's just the Patriots.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

413
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:17.200
so I got to watch them lose what a fucking gay man and

414
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.750
<v 1>okay.</v>

415
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:23.590
<v 0>The pictures of the fuck at Alabama fans when they would cut to the crowd,</v>

416
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.500
when they were starting to sense that they were going to lose.

417
00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:31.620
Like you just have to respect how much it makes the look at devastates.

418
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.550
You see the kid who's just fucking a dude who was just bent over at the fucking

419
00:25:36.551 --> 00:25:39.550
wall.
I thought he was dead.

420
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.830
It just,
I watched that shit and I just fucking,

421
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:48.890
that's why I love sports because it's so fucking stupid that we give a shit to

422
00:25:50.071 --> 00:25:53.310
that God damn level,
uh,
yet we do.
And,
um,

423
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:58.260
I love watching SCC football because,
uh,
I don't know.

424
00:25:58.261 --> 00:25:59.820
There's a level of passion of the fans.

425
00:25:59.821 --> 00:26:02.070
And I know I break the Alabama fans balls.

426
00:26:02.071 --> 00:26:04.080
I don't give a fuck if you win another championship.

427
00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:06.600
I actually Kinda one way want to see,
save and do it.

428
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.380
And when the most just to see,
just so I can say that I watched the,
uh,

429
00:26:10.381 --> 00:26:15.150
the greatest college coach of all time.
But in the meantime,
every time you play,

430
00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:20.070
I can't root for you.
If I look,
if I was born in Alabama,

431
00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:22.670
you know,
and,
and,

432
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.680
and crimson tide country and I was raised a fucking Alabama fan and I went to

433
00:26:28.471 --> 00:26:33.030
that brutal period after bear Bryant left and that program went into the shitter

434
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.010
and I suffered through all those years,

435
00:26:35.011 --> 00:26:36.930
then I can be excited about them being good again.

436
00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:41.100
But I can't come from a pro sports fucking town and just jump on the bandwagon.

437
00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:45.340
But what I can do is fucking root for the underdog,
which I did.

438
00:26:45.341 --> 00:26:48.550
So congratulations to ole miss.
Um,

439
00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:54.280
I can't imagine how fucking crazy you guys went to celebrating in Mississippi.

440
00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:58.800
I open,
didn't gradually turned into a fucking race riot.
And you guys just,

441
00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.260
you know,
wanting to start the fucking civil war again.
Uh,

442
00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.990
hopefully you kept a tame,
you know what I mean?

443
00:27:04.991 --> 00:27:09.190
Just tipped over a couple of cars and burned down some old trees or whatever the

444
00:27:09.191 --> 00:27:13.420
fuck he do down there.
Uh,
but I got to watch that and uh,

445
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.960
I was actually traveling to Austin and I got to watch the first quarter of the

446
00:27:16.961 --> 00:27:21.580
Patriots game and um,
you know,

447
00:27:21.581 --> 00:27:23.860
it was just,
it was just fucking great just watching,
you know,

448
00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:27.100
we're going to be the loudest fans and then having nothing to cheer about

449
00:27:27.101 --> 00:27:28.540
because all of a sudden it's 21,

450
00:27:28.541 --> 00:27:31.960
seven patriots after the bills just walked down the fucking field.

451
00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:36.460
Totally fucking enjoyed that.
Um,
and once again,

452
00:27:36.461 --> 00:27:37.840
this has nothing to do with bills fans.

453
00:27:37.841 --> 00:27:41.140
It just has to do with the fact that the amount of shit that bill Bellacheck

454
00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:44.470
gets for having no personality.
You know,

455
00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:49.060
like these fucking sports journalists don't know exactly what Bella checks
doing.

456
00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:52.600
They know that he's figured them out,
they know it,

457
00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.600
and he's not going to let him in.
He's not giving him any billboard,

458
00:27:55.990 --> 00:28:00.310
bulletin board material,
I should say.
And uh,
Rex Ryan,
they always be,
oh,

459
00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:04.090
you know this guy,
you know,
he's not afraid to say what's on his mind.

460
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.740
That's how they paid him.

461
00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:10.090
They just egg him on to keep saying dumb things.

462
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

463
00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.170
<v 0>You know what I mean?
I don't,
for the life of me,</v>

464
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.460
I don't know why rex Ryan talks the level of shit that he does,

465
00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.140
but I'm so happy that he does it.
I'm so happy that he does it.

466
00:28:23.141 --> 00:28:26.890
It's just like,
there you go.
Wrecks,
they go piss off Tom Brady.

467
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:28.240
See how that works for you.

468
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:29.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

469
00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.840
<v 0>How does almost 500 yards passing,
how does that feel?</v>

470
00:28:32.841 --> 00:28:35.450
The sporting their rex keep talking shit.

471
00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:36.830
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

472
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:40.640
<v 0>You know what it is I really feel is because his level of insecurity outweighs</v>

473
00:28:40.641 --> 00:28:44.840
actually even winning the game that he has to shout down his own fucking demons.

474
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:49.040
Um,
having said that,
you know,

475
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.680
as much as I give wreck ship,
I know he's a great coach.
Uh,
I can't say great.

476
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:59.300
He hasn't won a Superbowl,
so he's,
he's a,
he's a really good coach.
And,

477
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.143
um,

478
00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:01.540
<v 1>yeah,</v>

479
00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.440
<v 0>and he does it.
He has a great defense and I,
well,
you know,</v>

480
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:05.850
they're gonna make their adjustments.

481
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.710
I think actually next game will actually be even closer obviously.
Um,

482
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:12.480
it's Kinda weird like his shit,

483
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.930
his shit talking made that a close game because the patriots,

484
00:29:15.931 --> 00:29:19.980
rather than just handing the ball off and running out the fucking clock,

485
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:25.010
we kept throwing the fucking ball because it wasn't enough to beat them by 21

486
00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:29.040
fucking points.
We wanted to beat him by 28 to 35.
Um,

487
00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:33.060
so actually is shit-talking we feel looked at the end of the game,
the fact that,

488
00:29:33.061 --> 00:29:33.894
you know,

489
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.050
<v 1>okay,</v>

490
00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:37.810
<v 0>yeah,
the game wasn't that fucking clothes.
You know,
that it was fun.</v>

491
00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:41.780
We only won by eight.
We kicked the shit out of him and then dopes,

492
00:29:41.781 --> 00:29:44.930
we kept throwing the fucking ball,
um,

493
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:49.730
putting us in a position to give it right back to them,
which we did.
Um,

494
00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.960
and then you go into the prevent and then all of a sudden this fucking inept

495
00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.470
quarterback who throws the ball fucking 90 feet over everybody's fucking head

496
00:29:57.471 --> 00:30:02.000
all day long.
All of a sudden looks like Joe Montana.
So,
um,

497
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.540
I dunno,
I'm psyched that that happened.
And um,

498
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.830
you know,
I hope,
you know,
when the Patriots go to play him again,

499
00:30:09.831 --> 00:30:12.770
I hope rex talks a bunch more shit,
which,
you know,
we will,

500
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:16.310
which we'll get to patriots even more motivated to beat them.

501
00:30:16.311 --> 00:30:18.830
I just don't understand it.
And these stupid fucking,

502
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:22.460
if you really listen to that guy,
he's not saying anything.

503
00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.290
The players on his team,
they're not saying anything.

504
00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:33.170
It's the just stating the obvious,
you know,
we're not afraid.

505
00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.513
Okay.

506
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.180
They're not going to just step off the bus bus and we're going to give him the

507
00:30:38.181 --> 00:30:42.920
win.
You know,
we,
we're,
we're coming out there to compete.
Oh,

508
00:30:42.921 --> 00:30:47.510
are you?
Did you not compete?
Let did last week.
You didn't try.

509
00:30:47.511 --> 00:30:50.240
It's a fucking NFL.
He should be doing that every fucking week.

510
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.510
Does Steel Kevin Mchale's great quote.

511
00:30:53.511 --> 00:30:57.860
Way Back in the day when he played for the Celtics,
I remember,
you know,

512
00:30:57.861 --> 00:31:00.500
they would some playoff series and they kicked the shit out of the other team

513
00:31:00.501 --> 00:31:04.640
the first game.
Then some yell,
it team starts talking,
shit going,
you know,

514
00:31:04.641 --> 00:31:05.510
we're not fucking around.

515
00:31:05.511 --> 00:31:09.020
They'd better be ready because next game were common were coming and Kevin

516
00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.060
Mchale cause you should be doing that every night.

517
00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.150
This is the NBA fucking hilarious.

518
00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:15.653
<v 1>Hm.</v>

519
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.530
<v 0>Anyways,
so there you go.
Keep talking shit.</v>

520
00:31:18.531 --> 00:31:22.530
Everybody out there and a buffalo fence.
Mike adults.

521
00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.720
You know what I mean?
I know rex is a very charismatic guy and you fucking,

522
00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:31.580
you wanted to believe him.
Do you want it to believe him?
I know,

523
00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.713
I know you did.

524
00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.440
You know what's great about the Patriots winning is now I don't have to hear

525
00:31:36.441 --> 00:31:40.810
from shred and Reagan out there in buffalo and I hope somebody sent you this,

526
00:31:40.811 --> 00:31:44.660
this,
this fucking clip there fellas.
How you guys doing?

527
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:50.750
How many times did you guys almost fucking set up a phone call with me?

528
00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:55.020
Shredding Reagan?
Two of my favorite people in,

529
00:31:55.021 --> 00:31:58.070
they'll end the radio biz here.
You know,
as I travel the country,

530
00:31:58.071 --> 00:32:00.290
these fucking guys are always,

531
00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.940
they only call me when Buffalo Beats,
you know?

532
00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:06.950
<v 1>Okay,</v>

533
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.590
<v 0>what do you got?
You got to sabers and the bills,
you don't get a lot out there.</v>

534
00:32:09.591 --> 00:32:11.870
If they beat the Bruins and like a playoff series,

535
00:32:11.871 --> 00:32:15.290
which I came in when that fucking happened.
Or if the PA,
the PA,

536
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:20.300
the bills would be this like twice.
I remember when we drew Bledsoe,

537
00:32:20.301 --> 00:32:23.780
went to the bills and they won that bet,
that home game,

538
00:32:23.781 --> 00:32:25.540
when they beat the crap out of us,
I got up,

539
00:32:25.541 --> 00:32:28.010
I got a phone call then and then there was one other time.

540
00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:34.630
It's hilarious and all they do is just talk about what a piece of shit bill

541
00:32:34.631 --> 00:32:36.910
Belicheck is and all that and I just laugh at them.

542
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.990
So I got to think after that drive when you

543
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.920
<v 2>went 80 yards,
went right down the field.
Yeah,
your,</v>

544
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:48.570
your index finger was,
was quivering.
We've got to call up,
we got to call them.

545
00:32:48.571 --> 00:32:52.290
Hit Sand.
Hit said,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Patriots.

546
00:32:52.291 --> 00:32:55.680
Go right down the field.
Give you all the old right there,

547
00:32:55.681 --> 00:33:00.300
Fred three and out.
Go right back down the field.
Another right there.

548
00:33:00.301 --> 00:33:03.390
Fred right
now,

549
00:33:03.391 --> 00:33:06.000
the three and out for you guys or a pick whatever the hell it was.

550
00:33:06.001 --> 00:33:10.530
Malcolm Butler is amazing interception.
Malcolm Butler.
Right.

551
00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:16.080
She's fucking wonderful.
So,
uh,
anyways,
I got to tell you,

552
00:33:16.081 --> 00:33:19.140
you got to put Matt Cassel.
You know what I mean?

553
00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:24.600
Matt Cassel did great with us when he was managing the Patriots.

554
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:29.990
Well Tom Brady was out,
right?
So I,

555
00:33:29.991 --> 00:33:32.940
I still don't think that,
you know,
if we go and play the bills again,

556
00:33:32.941 --> 00:33:37.560
that we definitely win the game because they got mad castle.
I still think a,

557
00:33:37.561 --> 00:33:41.250
and I know that rex is a good enough coach if he has,
if he has a good defense,

558
00:33:41.251 --> 00:33:44.360
but I think the great thing is going to be if he just keep,

559
00:33:44.361 --> 00:33:47.940
just keep talking shit.
Rex,
keep talking shit.

560
00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.830
You know dumb it is to talk shit on in a professional sports league.
Yeah.

561
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

562
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.510
<v 2>You know what I mean?
Like you're actually intimidating.
Somebody else says,</v>

563
00:33:56.511 --> 00:33:57.740
as a professionals,

564
00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:03.240
they're not afraid of you and your nutrisystem wrecks.
They don't give a fuck.

565
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:08.460
Oh,
you're going to blitz.
All right,
so whatever.

566
00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.230
So I got to watch that Shit and that was very enjoyable for me.
Um,

567
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.490
<v 1>okay.</v>

568
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:14.301
<v 2>Yeah.
And it was wonderful.</v>

569
00:34:14.301 --> 00:34:18.020
I got a bunch of tweets from fucking buffalo fans taking on the personality of

570
00:34:18.021 --> 00:34:22.310
their head coach and just watch to watch them slowly drop off after that opening

571
00:34:22.311 --> 00:34:24.770
drive.
You know,
it's so funny.

572
00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:28.100
And then to watch him slowly come back as we almost fucked up the end of the

573
00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:32.030
game and then it just watch him disappear again.
It was really enjoyable.

574
00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.600
You know,
it's like when I was in Nantucket hearing the surf,

575
00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:40.913
that's all it is.

576
00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:45.120
That beginning sound is bills fans before the game that ends sound is them at

577
00:34:45.121 --> 00:34:45.954
the end.

578
00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.820
So anyways,
uh,
oh,
freckles has got to get back on the wagon.

579
00:34:53.821 --> 00:34:58.750
So I,
um,
I'm totally off my diet.

580
00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.810
I drank like a fish last week,

581
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:05.410
like a maniac to the point yesterday when I was walking through the airport,

582
00:35:05.411 --> 00:35:09.370
I had like heartburn and everything like that because I stuffed that I had not

583
00:35:09.371 --> 00:35:13.550
eaten in the entire time.
I was,
uh,

584
00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:19.030
you know,
dieting tiny,
lose the weight.
I was drinking beers,

585
00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:24.010
I was smoking cigars,
I was eating chips,
ice cream,

586
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:28.450
the whole wedding cake,
the whole fuck.
I just chowed.

587
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.730
And um,
so yesterday was,
was the big day.

588
00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.020
Well,
yesterday I was like,
uh,
you know,
I'm gonna be

589
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.840
<v 0>traveling all day in airports,
so you know,
I'm not going to eat healthy.</v>

590
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.680
So I just was like,
all right,
well let's,
let's,

591
00:35:44.681 --> 00:35:46.960
we got a three headed monster here.
We get sugar,

592
00:35:46.961 --> 00:35:51.340
salt and boost going on right now.
Let's chop one head off.
So I was just like,

593
00:35:51.341 --> 00:35:54.340
all right,
no booze today.
So,
um,

594
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.670
and I've,
I'm,
I'm doing this run at dates through Texas,

595
00:35:58.671 --> 00:36:01.070
so there's some friends coming out tonight.

596
00:36:01.071 --> 00:36:02.750
So tonight I'm going to have a couple of drinks.

597
00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.060
The rest of the week I'm having none.

598
00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.060
And then in Toronto I have some friends up there and I'll probably have a couple

599
00:36:08.061 --> 00:36:11.060
of drinks,
but the second that is over,

600
00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:15.050
I am back on the wagon again,
um,

601
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:18.990
for at least until mid October,

602
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.600
if not until the night of the Madison Square Garden Show,

603
00:36:21.601 --> 00:36:24.630
depending on how I feel.
Um,

604
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.280
I actually think this is what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go after this.

605
00:36:29.281 --> 00:36:32.160
This thing is over.
I'm drinking two times on this trip.

606
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:37.020
Then I'm back on the wagon except for on October 17th,

607
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:41.880
um,
back on the wagon until Madison Square Garden.
That's how it's going down.

608
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:45.660
October 17th.
Why,
why are you going to drink that day?

609
00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:47.450
Because I'm going to,

610
00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:52.550
<v 3>uh,
Papa,
Papa,
Papa,
Papa,
Papa,</v>

611
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.483
Papa.

612
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.710
<v 0>I'm going to fucking a Notre Dame USC.</v>

613
00:36:56.190 --> 00:37:00.240
I'm starting to run a dates through the Midwest to get ready for the Madison

614
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.590
Square Garden show and a,

615
00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:06.591
why not start it off at arguably the most legendary football program in the

616
00:37:07.141 --> 00:37:11.700
country,
right?
The Notre Dame fighting Irish.
So legendary.

617
00:37:11.701 --> 00:37:13.140
They've been on national television,

618
00:37:13.141 --> 00:37:17.340
even though they've sucked every fucking weekend for the last 15 years.

619
00:37:17.341 --> 00:37:21.120
They've been on the,
on the,
on the tube.
So I'm going to that game.
So,
um,

620
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:22.920
and when I get,

621
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.650
I'm going to try to eat as well as I can on this tour and when I get back,

622
00:37:25.651 --> 00:37:29.940
I'm going right back to that psycho fucking died because,
uh,
it took me too,

623
00:37:29.941 --> 00:37:30.774
God damn long.

624
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:34.920
It's too much bullshit to lose all this fucking weight that I don't want to go

625
00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:36.960
back.
So,
uh,
and I,

626
00:37:36.961 --> 00:37:39.570
you know what's helping me is to actually tell you guys that I'm doing it

627
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.980
because if I don't tell you,
if I just do this in my head,
then I can slack off.

628
00:37:43.981 --> 00:37:45.570
There's nobody give you to give me shit.

629
00:37:45.571 --> 00:37:47.460
But if I tell you guys and I'm going to do it,

630
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.180
then you guys could turn the tables on me and be like,
hey bill,

631
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.520
we just checking on
to see how you're doing them.
Um,

632
00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.950
all right.
So anyways,
when I was,
um,

633
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:04.710
here's another thing I'm done with fish.
I'm not eating fish,

634
00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:07.150
uh,
any more because,
uh,

635
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:08.810
<v 1>okay.</v>

636
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:12.380
<v 0>Because there's none left is basically what I learned because I've been going to</v>

637
00:38:12.381 --> 00:38:16.730
Nantucket and I've gone out and gone fishing every single time and every single

638
00:38:16.731 --> 00:38:20.240
time I've gone it's been harder and harder and we've have to throw the lines

639
00:38:20.241 --> 00:38:23.690
deeper and deeper to try to get fish.
And this just fucking nothing left.

640
00:38:23.691 --> 00:38:27.950
And I was talking to this guy and he was talking about what are all these

641
00:38:27.951 --> 00:38:32.270
fishing areas up in New England that people thought would never be fished out.

642
00:38:32.271 --> 00:38:34.280
He said a completely fished out.
And uh,

643
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:38.270
that's something I wish they would just say,
um,

644
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:43.820
you know,
in this presidential election that they would be like,
hey,

645
00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:45.500
why doesn't everybody just lay off fish,

646
00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:49.880
go real easy on the fish for like the next fucking decade?

647
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.040
Let's just let him come back.
There's nothing wrong with eating fish,

648
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:57.310
but there's too many fucking people.
Let's just fucking lay off it.

649
00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.570
We can make cows and chickens,
we can force him to fuck each other,
you know,

650
00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:06.340
and we can eat those and lamb and all of that shit.
But like the fish,

651
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.030
you know,
what are we doing here?
You just let them come back.

652
00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:13.960
Like I got to tell you,
like once we just kept pulling a blues,
I guess,

653
00:39:13.961 --> 00:39:15.910
which don't taste good,
so we'd throw him back.

654
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:20.080
I really did not enjoy it when I think about it.
And,
uh,

655
00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:22.810
then we ended up pulling up these fluke,
who the fuck eats fluke?

656
00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:26.800
We just doing it to pad our fucking stats and then brought it in.

657
00:39:26.801 --> 00:39:31.360
I felt we got took way too much fish than we were actually going to eat.
Um,

658
00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.740
just so you could have the fun of fishing.
It's just,
there's always that thing.

659
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:38.890
Anytime I've gone fishing that I always feel like there's that tipping point

660
00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:39.881
where it's like,
all right,

661
00:39:39.881 --> 00:39:44.320
we've caught our dinner and now we're just killing shit just to kill Shit.

662
00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:49.000
And uh,
I always feel like,
like a fucking chimpanzee then.
You know what I mean?

663
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:53.280
I feel like,
you know,
acting like a bunch of apes,
you know,
if you watch,

664
00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:56.260
I fucking hate chimpanzees,
I can't fucking stand.
And when did they,

665
00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:58.060
when they do a real documentary on him,

666
00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:03.250
I see so much fucking sadistic human behavior in him.
Uh,
the way,

667
00:40:03.251 --> 00:40:07.110
you know,
when they go out and they kill them,
another monkey,
you know,

668
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.910
I watched one one time just standing on the thing's fucking back,

669
00:40:09.911 --> 00:40:13.570
just digging into what's back,
pulling out flesh.
It could have just killed it,

670
00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:16.240
but it was actually getting off on here.
And the other thing screaming.

671
00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:20.860
And I just so much fucking sadistic human behavior in it.
I fucking,
I hate him.

672
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:24.310
And I just felt like when we were still pulling the fish out just to be doing
it,

673
00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:27.040
I felt like we were a bunch of chimps.
Like we should've been doing that,

674
00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:31.330
you know,
walking around that weird chip walk fucking punch in our chest.

675
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.360
You know,
maybe I'm over fucking reacting,
but uh,

676
00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.780
I gotta tell you my favorite part of,
um,

677
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.600
of the fishing trip

678
00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:45.920
other than watching one of the guys I was with polling this beautiful bass

679
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:49.130
fucking gorgeous fish that I knew we were going to cook up and eat and they

680
00:40:49.131 --> 00:40:53.870
would feed all of us.
Um,
was when,
uh,

681
00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:58.580
there was a school of porpoises,
there was,
when I was swimming along the boat,

682
00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.800
I actually took video,
you know,
something.
I don't know how to do it.

683
00:41:00.801 --> 00:41:04.640
I'll give it to my guy.
Maybe he'll be able to upload it correctly.

684
00:41:04.641 --> 00:41:07.460
But that was the best part of it.
Um,

685
00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:11.690
personally was fucking amazing,
man.
And watching those things,

686
00:41:11.691 --> 00:41:16.400
cutting through the water,
like a Goddamn sports car.
That was the best part.

687
00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.910
But killing the fluke.
I just felt we've taken up the fluke man,

688
00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.990
those stupid flat fish.
I just felt like I was beaten up a three year old.

689
00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.980
Um,
so anyways,
let's,
uh,

690
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.000
<v 1>yeah,</v>

691
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.470
<v 0>it's fucking a,
let's do some of the reeds here for this week.</v>

692
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:38.590
<v 2>Um,
oh,
hey,
by the way,
if you want to send in a,
um,</v>

693
00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.390
a,
a,
a question here to the podcast,
the,

694
00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.160
what you send it is to bill at the Mlm,

695
00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:48.490
podcast.com.

696
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:53.550
And that's all lowercase except for the m's in Mlm podcast bill at the MLM

697
00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.530
podcast.
Um,
oh,

698
00:41:56.531 --> 00:42:01.180
did anybody watch the Emmy's last night?
Um,

699
00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.540
I didn't watch them.
I was traveling and,
um,

700
00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.230
evidently somebody gave some powerful speech.

701
00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:12.040
Some woman gave a speech about a racism and all that.

702
00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:17.130
And of course the crowd went fucking crazy.
And,
uh,
I,

703
00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:22.090
I don't fucking get that moment when somebody black is on stage.

704
00:42:22.091 --> 00:42:22.660
Right?

705
00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:27.660
And they talk about how racist Hollywood is and how it needs to stop the level,

706
00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:31.300
like the white people in the crowd,

707
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:36.040
almost like trip over themselves to stand up and applaud.

708
00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:39.310
And it always comes off so fucking phony to me,

709
00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:41.920
like the level that,

710
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:47.530
the level that they're screaming and applauding and crying and doing all this

711
00:42:47.621 --> 00:42:52.150
fucking bullshit.
It's just like you guys are the guys who were running the shit.

712
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:56.330
I'm not talking about the actors,
but this leg show runners in the crowd.

713
00:42:56.331 --> 00:42:58.300
There's this heads of studios and all that.

714
00:42:58.301 --> 00:43:03.301
It's like if you really gave a fuck to the level that you're acting like you're

715
00:43:04.061 --> 00:43:07.210
given a fuck,
the person on stage wouldn't have to be making,

716
00:43:07.211 --> 00:43:10.930
wouldn't have to be making this speech.
I think it's so fucking,

717
00:43:10.931 --> 00:43:15.931
I think that they did jumping up and they're applauding at that fucking level

718
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.520
because they don't want to get caught on camera,
not collapse.

719
00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:24.730
You know what I mean?
I'm not saying that all white people a bet.
All right.

720
00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.060
I'm not saying that shit,
but it at it just,
I don't,

721
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.500
I don't fucking get that moment.

722
00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:35.700
I feel like whiteys like me in that moment rather than applauding wildly should

723
00:43:37.361 --> 00:43:41.410
be gone.
Like,
Aye.
Aye.
You got us.
Your eye,
your eye.

724
00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.490
We've got it.
We got to work federal.
We've got to work harder on that one.
Sorry.

725
00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.320
Sorry about that.

726
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:53.020
Instead of standing there applauding as if you're not part of the problem.

727
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:55.540
You know what I mean?
It's even myself.

728
00:43:55.541 --> 00:43:59.590
As much as I feel like things should be fair,
I don't do anything about it.

729
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:04.420
You know what I mean?
I'm just trying to keep my boat afloat.
Right.

730
00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.633
<v 1>Okay.</v>

731
00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.680
<v 2>That's actually kind of funny when you think about it,</v>

732
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:13.210
when you think about how cutthroat show business is,

733
00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:18.790
the most honest things that white people could do in that point at that point

734
00:44:18.791 --> 00:44:22.300
would not be to applaud.
There'll be like,
wait a minute.

735
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:25.660
This business is hard enough for us.

736
00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:29.650
Where with it being completely unfair and tilted in our favor,

737
00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:34.020
why?
I applaud to level it out like,
yeah,

738
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:36.090
make it harder for me.

739
00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.640
<v 0>Hello fucking balding,
redhead and male.</v>

740
00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:46.030
I needed to be slanted in my favor as much as possible.

741
00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.920
That would be the most honest moment.

742
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:49.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

743
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.810
<v 0>The most honest reaction,
but everybody doesn't.</v>

744
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:56.840
They all stand up and freak out and this is what it really pisses me off is they

745
00:44:56.971 --> 00:45:00.420
then think that yeah,
I'm a good person cause I just did that.

746
00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:04.300
This person is going through this shit.

747
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:08.260
They said they're sick second going through this shit and I'm going to stand up

748
00:45:08.261 --> 00:45:11.890
and applaud and be like,
that's right.
You shouldn't have to go through that shit.

749
00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.520
Oh,
okay.
Now I'm going to sit

750
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:16.760
<v 2>back down again and be white.</v>

751
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

752
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.240
<v 0>I was still waiting for somebody.</v>

753
00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:25.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

754
00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.910
<v 0>Even if it's a feminist,
anything to be up there standing and be like,</v>

755
00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.340
why are you applauding right now?

756
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.860
Are you going to do anything about this?
You know what I mean?

757
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.270
And human beings are all selfish shit when you know,
most part you're not.

758
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.430
I Dunno.
Maybe are they,
I know.
Maybe I'm just fucking pessimistic.
I have no idea.

759
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.870
All right,
let's uh,
let's plow ahead here.
Um

760
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:50.933
<v 1>Hm.</v>

761
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.470
<v 2>All right.
American people in their clubs.
Hi,
Bill.</v>

762
00:45:54.471 --> 00:45:59.150
Wanted to ask about you guys across the pond and the way you support your clubs.

763
00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:02.210
All right.
First of all,
we call them teams.
All right?

764
00:46:02.211 --> 00:46:04.430
Just to let you know if you want to blend in,
if you're,

765
00:46:04.431 --> 00:46:08.420
if your government ever goes belly up and you sneak into this country and you

766
00:46:08.421 --> 00:46:12.710
don't want to be found out,
you know that you're an illegal alien.
You say teams,

767
00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:16.280
you don't say clubs and vice versa.
When the dollar collapse,

768
00:46:16.281 --> 00:46:17.670
I'll go over there and be like,
we're like,

769
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:22.480
oh you support what club you support mate.
Right?

770
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:24.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

771
00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.820
<v 2>Put another shrimp on the Barbie.
Shagadelic baby.</v>

772
00:46:27.821 --> 00:46:31.180
You have to start quoting awful American movies.
Um,
to me it looks like,

773
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.540
<v 1>yeah,</v>

774
00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:37.540
<v 2>you support anyone you fancy anywhere in the u s it seems you support about five</v>

775
00:46:38.271 --> 00:46:42.280
teams in five different sports over in Block II.

776
00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:46.760
We support only like one sport and you keep to it.
Ah,

777
00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:51.440
Jesus Christ.
Can You fucking Pat Yourself?
Lou were fucking loyal over here.

778
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:54.080
Rarely.
What else you're going to do over there?

779
00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.480
The fuck else are you going to do over in Australia?

780
00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:01.480
Don't give me any bullshit cause I've been to your fucking country.

781
00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:06.280
Unless you're in Melbourne.
There ain't shit to do.
Sydney,
Sydney,

782
00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:09.670
Jesus Christ,
Sydney.
It's like Sacramento,
California.

783
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.133
<v 1>All right,</v>

784
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:13.681
<v 2>the whole mill.</v>

785
00:47:13.681 --> 00:47:18.660
Your country is full of the most evil fucking poison his shit ever.
Right.

786
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:19.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

787
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:24.470
<v 2>You can't even go there.
That's what ACDC is.
Highway to hell was about,</v>

788
00:47:24.471 --> 00:47:27.680
wasn't it?
Driving from Perth all the way through that fucking shit.

789
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:32.320
Jesus Christ.
All right,
let's see.
Usually soccer slash football,

790
00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:37.630
um,
is what you support.
But the richer you are,
the,
the sport changes.

791
00:47:37.631 --> 00:47:41.650
Example,
rugby,
tennis is so on,
those are for rich people.
I evidently,
uh,

792
00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:42.970
for the most,
for most people,

793
00:47:42.971 --> 00:47:47.971
you support one team and you live no more than 30 mile radius or at least a two.

794
00:47:48.011 --> 00:47:51.190
Your top league team,
unless you're a glory supporter,

795
00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:53.440
which means a bandwagon or I guess so my question is,

796
00:47:53.441 --> 00:47:58.420
are all Americans glory hunters or is there a way of doing things the novice

797
00:47:58.421 --> 00:48:01.180
can't see?
Go Fuck Yourself.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dope.

798
00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:06.420
<v 0>I Dunno what the fuck you talking about.
I support all the Boston teams,</v>

799
00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:09.320
<v 2>the patriots as far as like,</v>

800
00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:14.600
we have four professional sports and I can't help it that we have more over
here.

801
00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:19.550
See the middle of our country,
we're able to grow enough food to feed the world.

802
00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:22.010
You guys,
the middle of your country,

803
00:48:22.011 --> 00:48:25.880
you have enough poison as shit to murder everybody in the world.

804
00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:29.990
Maybe that's why your teams are only 30 miles of fucking way.

805
00:48:29.991 --> 00:48:33.290
You're trying to just trying to shorten the travel to the stadium so nobody

806
00:48:33.291 --> 00:48:34.230
fucking dies.

807
00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:39.600
<v 0>Um,
yeah.
So the four major sports over here,
football,
basketball,</v>

808
00:48:39.601 --> 00:48:41.790
baseball and hockey and uh,

809
00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:46.890
I support all the Boston teams.
Those are my favorite teams.

810
00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:48.510
They always have been.

811
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:53.720
Now since I have a job where I have all this free time,

812
00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:58.620
you know,
I can watch golf majors,
I can watch tennis majors,

813
00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:02.100
I could watch college football,
I could watch college hoop.

814
00:49:02.101 --> 00:49:06.540
I can't watch it and pay attention to at the level that I pay attention to

815
00:49:06.541 --> 00:49:09.690
football and hockey.
You can't even with the four major sports,

816
00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:15.150
like basically somebody who watches and pays attention,

817
00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.670
like to baseball and football,

818
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:22.770
then asked to make a choice with basketball or hockey like this.

819
00:49:22.771 --> 00:49:27.630
Football,
baseball and basketball fans has football,
baseball,
and hockey fans.

820
00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:29.130
And for the most part,

821
00:49:29.131 --> 00:49:32.670
the way the seasons overlap now it's becoming football and basketball,

822
00:49:32.671 --> 00:49:33.840
football and hockey.

823
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.610
Or maybe some of you have just a hardcore like baseball fan.

824
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:42.390
Um,
you know,
that's basically what it is.

825
00:49:42.391 --> 00:49:46.430
But we definitely have glory support as you call them or um,

826
00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:51.150
bandwagon fans.
There's a lot of bandwagon Yankee fans.

827
00:49:51.151 --> 00:49:53.100
There's a lot of bandwagon,
I'm

828
00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.570
like Dallas Cowboy fans when they're good,
you know,

829
00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.990
this just certain teams that are like,
I don't know,

830
00:50:00.991 --> 00:50:05.490
they have like national appeal,
but um,
no,
for the most part.
Yeah.

831
00:50:05.491 --> 00:50:08.040
You go and people support the teams

832
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:11.880
<v 2>that are in their area.
I don't know what you're seeing are a few here.
Me,</v>

833
00:50:11.881 --> 00:50:14.130
because I talk about all these different sports.

834
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:19.020
<v 0>I mean I have to or unless I just want to do like a Boston podcasts,</v>

835
00:50:19.021 --> 00:50:23.190
which kind of limits.
I mean,
this podcast is Boston enough?

836
00:50:23.191 --> 00:50:27.000
I don't want to fucking,
you know,
eliminate all that other,

837
00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:28.803
right.

838
00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.330
<v 2>Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not white.</v>

839
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.260
I think we just got a bunch of great sports over here and it's fun to fucking

840
00:50:34.261 --> 00:50:34.531
watch.

841
00:50:34.531 --> 00:50:38.580
But I don't think that people are necessarily any more bandwagon over here.
Well,

842
00:50:38.581 --> 00:50:41.340
I can't say then over there because I don't know what the fuck goes on over

843
00:50:41.341 --> 00:50:44.890
there.
But um,
as usual,
you,
uh,

844
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:49.860
you're not from the United States and you did what most foreigners do is you in

845
00:50:49.861 --> 00:50:53.970
a very insulting way,
shitting all over,
uh,
America.

846
00:50:53.971 --> 00:50:58.350
You try to act like you're trying to get information as you shit all over us.
Uh,

847
00:50:58.351 --> 00:51:01.170
but the great thing about my job is,
um,

848
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:05.760
I've been to where you're at and I've smelt your shit and it smells no

849
00:51:05.761 --> 00:51:09.580
differently.
So go fuck yourself.
Um,

850
00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:15.460
anyways,
Aussie rules get day blinky bill.
Um,
no,

851
00:51:15.461 --> 00:51:18.880
I don't think that there's anymore.
I,
like I said,
I guess I don't,

852
00:51:18.881 --> 00:51:23.470
I don't know how many fucking people are glory supporting over there.
Um,

853
00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:25.540
all right,
let's continue.
All right.

854
00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:29.260
Last week you got an email from a fellow Australian fan who asks you to explain

855
00:51:29.261 --> 00:51:31.570
the rules of American football.
In return.
You,

856
00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:35.680
you asked an Aussie to explain our own brand of football.
So here it goes.
Oh,
gee.

857
00:51:35.681 --> 00:51:39.430
Just,
by the way,
I should have just said American football,
you know,

858
00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:45.670
you got two ends of the field.
Both teams defend the end of the field.

859
00:51:45.671 --> 00:51:50.470
That's to their backs.
All right?
The other team gets the fucking ball.

860
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:55.690
All right?
If they run into the end zone or thrown into the end zone,

861
00:51:55.930 --> 00:52:00.930
they get six points followed by an extra point where they kick it through the

862
00:52:01.481 --> 00:52:04.150
uprights for one point.
All right?

863
00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.600
If you drive down the field stalls,

864
00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:13.620
you could try to kick the ball through the uprights and you get three points.

865
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:17.710
If he don't think he can make it,
you punt the ball.
That's it.

866
00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.070
That's all I should have said.
Go through the whole first down.
Second down.

867
00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:24.940
All that is too much.
All right.
Australian rules.
That's,
that's chapter two.

868
00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.760
All right.
Australian rules football was invented in Melbourne,

869
00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:33.610
Victoria in the 1870s yes.

870
00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:37.070
That long ago.
Well,
why did you think that?

871
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:41.240
I was going to think that was a long time ago.
Baseball was invented in the 1880s

872
00:52:43.770 --> 00:52:48.080
there's always that insulting,
like fucking like in the United States.

873
00:52:48.081 --> 00:52:52.580
You don't fucking know.
Whoa.
Hey,
change Shevon Geesh.
People were alive,
back,
dead.

874
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:58.150
Um,
and as a competition between 18 teams from around the nation,
each,

875
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.730
each team plays 22 gains between April and September.

876
00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:05.630
And then the top eight teams on the latter play finals,

877
00:53:05.631 --> 00:53:09.020
football during September,
September and into October.
All right,

878
00:53:09.021 --> 00:53:09.854
so let's play off time.

879
00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:14.920
Winning a game gets to team for premiership points and losing it gets you enough

880
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:19.910
at AFL is played on a large oval,

881
00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.640
about 150 meters from goal to goal.

882
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:27.590
There really aren't any set dimensions for field of play as the ovals over in

883
00:53:27.591 --> 00:53:32.030
Perth are known to be wider than the fields in Victoria and South Australia.

884
00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:35.990
Well,
back in the day and in the NHL,
hockey rinks were different sizes.

885
00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:40.730
Boston had a smaller rink,
so we more had like grinders,
you know,

886
00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:45.680
physical players.
And then,
uh,
other places,
you know,
if they had a bigger rig,

887
00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:49.800
they went more for fucking speed.
Um,

888
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.660
and the teams used to do shit.
Like,
if the other team was fast,

889
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:55.910
they wouldn't fucking be,

890
00:53:55.911 --> 00:53:58.910
they'd have the ice be a little more slushy and all that type of shit,

891
00:53:58.911 --> 00:54:01.640
all that type of shit,
you know.
Anyway,
so here we go anyways.

892
00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:03.140
Now to the actual rules,

893
00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:07.670
like in the NFL there is some set point players.
Uh,

894
00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.440
but for now let's just break them into defenders midfielders and forwards.

895
00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:16.370
The ball is bounced in the center of the ground at the start of play or after a

896
00:54:16.371 --> 00:54:21.371
goal is score and the opposing Ruckman that was in quotes jumped to try and tap

897
00:54:21.651 --> 00:54:23.720
the ball to their midfield.
Midfield,

898
00:54:23.721 --> 00:54:27.470
there's advantage quite like basketball to dispose of the ball.

899
00:54:27.471 --> 00:54:30.530
A player must either kick it or handball it,

900
00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.950
which is essentially holding the ball in one hand and punching it with the
other.

901
00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:34.460
Uh,

902
00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:39.460
player cannot throw the ball but can kick or hand ball in any direction.

903
00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:44.360
The ball must be bounced while a player is running with it,
like in basketball,

904
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:49.630
but only like every 10 paces if the ball is kicked outside the field of play.

905
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:53.580
This is actually interesting because I've watched the game and I'm picturing run

906
00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:56.360
these fuckers running around now I kind of get it.
Uh,

907
00:54:56.361 --> 00:55:00.050
if the ball is kicked outside the field of play on the full,

908
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.940
on the full,
what the fuck is that?
A free kick is awarded to the other team.

909
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:08.030
If it goes out of bounds after bouncing along the ground,

910
00:55:08.031 --> 00:55:10.640
the boundary umpires just throws,
just throws it in.

911
00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.590
What the fuck is the fall?

912
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:21.270
The ball is kicked outside the field of play on the full of free kick.

913
00:55:21.271 --> 00:55:23.010
His award together team.
A free kick.

914
00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:27.240
What to kick it between those posts or to kick it to your other team.

915
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:30.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

916
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.550
<v 2>I don't fucking know.
If a player catches a ball,</v>

917
00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:37.650
it is called a mark and the umpire referee will blow his whistle and award this

918
00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:41.280
player a few seconds to explore his options and then kick on it.

919
00:55:41.281 --> 00:55:45.060
The player moves past the line.
I've seen all of this shit.
Yeah,

920
00:55:45.061 --> 00:55:47.040
they all clear out.
I,

921
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:51.090
the play moves past the line where you worry mark the ball,

922
00:55:51.091 --> 00:55:55.170
the umpire calls play on and the player can then be tackled by the opposition.

923
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:58.260
If he has tackled with the ball and does not get rid of it legally,

924
00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:02.000
it's called holding the ball and the end and the tackle.

925
00:56:02.001 --> 00:56:05.850
He gets a free kick.
What don't you mean?

926
00:56:05.851 --> 00:56:08.490
Then the tackle gets a free kick or wherever it's a tackler.

927
00:56:08.491 --> 00:56:12.170
Falls on the victim's back or makes head high contact.

928
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:16.680
A free kick is awarded to the player.
He was tackling Jesus Christ.
Dude,

929
00:56:16.681 --> 00:56:20.370
this is way too much information.
This is still going to go.

930
00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.360
He's still going here in order to score a player has kicked the ball through his

931
00:56:24.361 --> 00:56:28.800
team center goalposts.
If he does this,
it's worth six points.
However,

932
00:56:28.801 --> 00:56:33.780
if he misses to either side,
the ball goes through
the,
behind the posts.

933
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:35.320
It's worth just one point.

934
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.770
Oh yeah cause you guys got the two tall ones and then the two smaller ones.

935
00:56:38.771 --> 00:56:43.180
Right.
Usually goals are scored from inside of teams 50 meter arc,

936
00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:44.380
but they don't have to be.

937
00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:46.960
Goals can be kicked by any player on the ground in any way.

938
00:56:46.961 --> 00:56:49.420
You can imagine as long as it comes off the phone,

939
00:56:49.421 --> 00:56:52.600
it is not touched by another player.
Lastly,
a specie

940
00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.430
specky come on Kj,
they always had e at the end.

941
00:56:58.431 --> 00:57:01.220
Specky right.
Specky ah,

942
00:57:01.221 --> 00:57:05.510
lastly I went to English to US Ozzie raw specie.

943
00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.810
Our Specie is when one player jumps on the ball,

944
00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:14.690
jumps on the shoulders or back of another player to mark the ball there named

945
00:57:14.691 --> 00:57:19.460
appropriately because they are spectacular to watch.
Yeah,
that's a big thing.

946
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:24.620
Like they don't want to say the whole word,
they just throw he at the Ed Spec.

947
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:29.500
It was a specky instead of saying spectacular.
Um,
I think anyways,

948
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:30.410
the only been there a couple times.

949
00:57:30.411 --> 00:57:33.900
It's players are often as high as four meters when they catch the ball,

950
00:57:33.901 --> 00:57:36.620
that's about two a little more than 12 feet in the air.
Thankfully,

951
00:57:36.621 --> 00:57:41.480
head high contact does not apply to SPEC.
He's,
that's about it.

952
00:57:41.481 --> 00:57:43.880
Bill seems like a lot of rules when it all written down,

953
00:57:43.881 --> 00:57:47.540
but I'm sure a season sports pro like yourself could pick it up pretty quickly.

954
00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:52.430
Games.
Um,
are streamed on www.afl.com.
Dot.

955
00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:53.690
EU,
who knows,

956
00:57:53.691 --> 00:57:57.260
maybe AFL could add some excitement to the dry months between hockey,
basketball,

957
00:57:57.261 --> 00:58:00.170
and NFL.
Uh,
if you're looking for a team,

958
00:58:00.171 --> 00:58:04.220
I reckon you'd suit the Western bulldogs.

959
00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:07.550
You love your dogs obviously,
but more than just that,

960
00:58:07.551 --> 00:58:11.270
they also play in the same colors as your patriots and they are based in a

961
00:58:11.271 --> 00:58:14.940
decent working class area.
Just like your beloved Boston.
Uh,

962
00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:19.070
go love yourself by friend.
Thanks for readings and thanks for years of laughs.

963
00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:21.110
Alright,
ps,

964
00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:25.730
blinky bill is a much love Australian cartoon.
Koala.

965
00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:30.560
Oh,
I gotta look that up.
All right,
here comes a creepy one.

966
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:36.530
Um,
she said rape.
I had a video tape.

967
00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:41.500
All right.
Talk about going from just some bullshit too,

968
00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:44.960
about as heavy a topic as you could have.
All right.
Hey Bill,

969
00:58:44.961 --> 00:58:48.260
I got a little question.
It does sound like a little question dude.

970
00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:52.340
She said rape by a videotape.
All right.

971
00:58:52.341 --> 00:58:54.050
This all sounds crazy.
All right.

972
00:58:54.051 --> 00:58:57.470
Last year I had sex with a girl and two days later I was arrested,

973
00:58:57.471 --> 00:59:00.080
charged with rape.
Luckily I filmed it.

974
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:05.200
I filmed it all as me and a friend had a threesome with tourists.

975
00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:06.940
So it's all good now.

976
00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:09.723
<v 1>Okay,</v>

977
00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:13.790
<v 2>wait a minute.
All right.
So if I'm to believe you,</v>

978
00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:17.270
you and your friend had a threesome with this woman.
You filmed it.

979
00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:20.690
Did she know you were filming it?

980
00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.530
<v 0>Maybe you could because you filmed it.</v>

981
00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:28.730
She then got afraid that you're going to show it to people.
So then she did that.

982
00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:30.320
I have no fucking idea.
There's too many.

983
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:35.270
Maybe you filmed it and she didn't know which would make you a piece of shit.

984
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.840
But then smart because she said it was rape and it wasn't.

985
00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:42.800
That's if I believe you,
that has a lot of variables here.
Uh,

986
00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:47.120
luckily I've filmed it at all as me and a friend had a threesome with her,

987
00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.890
so it's all good now.
Do you see,

988
00:59:48.891 --> 00:59:52.840
I have to still doubt this guy because of this thing.
He had a videotape.

989
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.740
The cops watched it and he got off.

990
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:59.180
I still have to act like she still had a case because it's rape.

991
00:59:59.570 --> 01:00:00.170
You know what I mean?

992
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:04.730
I have to act like no guy ever gets accused of rape when he didn't rape.

993
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:07.640
You know what I mean?
I have to be like,
you know what I mean?

994
01:00:07.641 --> 01:00:09.650
I got to be like those white people at the award shows.

995
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:12.210
I have to stand up and applaud.
Um,

996
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:16.910
but the whole thing stresses stress me out so bad that I had to quit my job.

997
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:19.520
Yeah,
I would think so.
And I've gone to therapy ever since.

998
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:24.140
Now I always wear a hidden recording device when I'm on a date with a girl.

999
01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:27.410
I got paid $1,000 because all of that happened,

1000
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:31.640
or $1,000 in damages.
The growing other hand didn't suffer a bit.

1001
01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:36.320
She was apparently unstable and had reported eight other cases of rape the same

1002
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.640
year I was number nine.
Still the police showed up with six men,

1003
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:44.750
two cars in made my room look like a scene from CSI.
Well,

1004
01:00:44.751 --> 01:00:48.200
they're just doing their job,
dude.
And as she was unstable,

1005
01:00:48.201 --> 01:00:51.860
she didn't have to pay me or any or anything or anyone.

1006
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:56.450
I got paid by the government.
I was risking years behind bars.
Yeah.

1007
01:00:56.451 --> 01:00:58.190
And God knows what they would've done to you in there.

1008
01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:03.260
I read something in the local paper by another one of her victims that was also

1009
01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:04.280
proven innocent,

1010
01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:08.540
was being hated on by my country's biggest feminist groups.

1011
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:11.600
Rape is serious,
but this is,
this has to stop.

1012
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:14.900
What are your thoughts on this bill?
Thank you.
Uh,

1013
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:19.520
for your answer and consensually fuck you.
Um,

1014
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:21.840
yeah,
I mean,
I,

1015
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:26.890
I think that's your situation is you're going to get caught up in after years of

1016
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.600
it going totally the other way where it was,

1017
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:37.010
where they blamed the victim and said,
well,
what were you wearing?
Um,

1018
01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.820
you were asking for it.
What did you think was going to happen now?

1019
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:42.321
You know,

1020
01:01:42.321 --> 01:01:47.321
which obviously needed to stop that now socially it's gone from where they

1021
01:01:50.241 --> 01:01:54.960
blamed the victim to me back in the day.
They'd be like,
well,

1022
01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:58.140
you were drinking.
What did you think was gonna Happen?
Um,

1023
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:04.090
they've gone all the way to the other side now where it's just like if she said

1024
01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:08.990
she was raped,
she was raped.
So,

1025
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:11.540
which isn't a bad,

1026
01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:16.570
what makes it a bad fucking thing is the fact that they put the accused name in

1027
01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:20.330
the picture and everything

1028
01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:24.050
<v 2>in the fucking paper before anything has been proven.</v>

1029
01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:28.500
I am an advocate of you.

1030
01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:33.330
Protect both people until something has been proven,
either innocence or guilt.

1031
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.430
All right?
And if it's innocent,

1032
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.200
you let that person get back on with their life because you cannot shake that.

1033
01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:45.250
It's over the second year accused of that shit.
It's fucking over.

1034
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:49.820
You know,
it's,
it's complete.
It's over.

1035
01:02:49.821 --> 01:02:52.280
You are branded that for the rest of your fucking life.

1036
01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.960
And when you have somebody out there,

1037
01:02:53.961 --> 01:02:58.160
if they're fucking unstable and they're doing this for whatever fucking reason,

1038
01:02:59.000 --> 01:02:59.833
I mean,

1039
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:04.160
God knows what horrible thing happened to this person that they're doing this.

1040
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.650
Um,
or maybe they were born unstable.
I have no fucking idea.
But

1041
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.750
you know,
the fact that you know,
you get 1000 bucks,

1042
01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.580
you're in therapy,
you gotta quit your fucking job and all that.
Uh,
I mean,
uh,

1043
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:25.200
look,
who's kidding?
Who Dude?
All right.
You had a fucking threesome.

1044
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.510
Alright.
You videotape and the fucking thing,

1045
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:34.560
I mean,
I don't know that you had,
ah,

1046
01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.310
I can't say don't wear a fucking recording device.

1047
01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:43.320
I totally understand why you would,
I totally get that.
But I would just say,

1048
01:03:43.321 --> 01:03:48.060
why don't you,
you know,
try to date somebody a little more stable.

1049
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:50.760
I mean,
you go on dates versus,
you know,

1050
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:57.470
hooking up with some crazy person who's having a threesome and letting your film

1051
01:03:57.781 --> 01:04:00.480
the fucking thing.
I mean right there,
dude,
if you fucking like,

1052
01:04:00.481 --> 01:04:01.740
if you hook up with somebody,

1053
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:06.570
you don't fucking know him from Adam and they're going to have a fucking

1054
01:04:06.571 --> 01:04:08.850
threesome and they're going to let you film the fucking thing.

1055
01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:11.640
I mean right there,

1056
01:04:11.641 --> 01:04:15.230
I mean the amount of red flags that should be flying in your face,

1057
01:04:15.231 --> 01:04:18.930
you shouldn't even be seeing the person anymore.
Here I am blaming you again.

1058
01:04:18.931 --> 01:04:20.370
You're probably a young guy.
You never had the,

1059
01:04:20.371 --> 01:04:23.250
so you learned your fucking lesson here.
Um,

1060
01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:29.580
I dunno dude.
Like if,
if if secretly wearing a recording device,

1061
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:36.240
you know,
makes you feel more comfortable,
I then,
I,
I,

1062
01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:43.040
I don't have a problem with it.
I mean do,
do you,

1063
01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:47.310
I don't know if you've ever heard like what happens to rape is and in,
in jail,

1064
01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.260
uh,
you know,

1065
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:54.290
they like hunted down if fucking gang raped and all of that type of shit just

1066
01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.400
fucking horrific.
What could have happened to you?

1067
01:04:56.401 --> 01:04:59.520
Just cause she said that that happened and um,

1068
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.200
those feminist groups that are doing that shit.

1069
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:09.230
I mean Dave basically exposing themselves for what they truly are is they're

1070
01:05:09.931 --> 01:05:10.764
sexist.

1071
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.450
They're totally fucking sexist to any woman says a guy does anything.

1072
01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:19.310
They just totally have their fucking,
they didn't give a shit.

1073
01:05:19.311 --> 01:05:22.450
I made this was this person even in that year said that,
you know,

1074
01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.080
someone raped and didn't raped her and didn't,

1075
01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:28.050
I mean right there they did a little bit of fucking where they just immediately

1076
01:05:28.051 --> 01:05:32.750
back them.
Let me guess.
Did they apologize to you at all?
You know,

1077
01:05:32.751 --> 01:05:33.710
I'm sure they didn't.

1078
01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:38.960
Did they is as big as a fucking surge that they did online or wherever they were

1079
01:05:38.961 --> 01:05:43.370
coming at you when they apologized,
which should have been even bigger.

1080
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:48.700
Did they?
I'm sure they didn't.
You know,
cause there's sexist.

1081
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:53.570
They are.
They don't give a shit.

1082
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:57.470
They sit there and they pat themselves on the back like did these socially

1083
01:05:57.471 --> 01:05:59.630
advanced fucking people and they aren't.

1084
01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:03.920
They're the exact fucking thing that they're fighting the exact moron,

1085
01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:08.240
sexist guy that thinks a woman should just be there to suck his dick and make

1086
01:06:08.241 --> 01:06:09.074
them a sandwich.

1087
01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:13.970
They had the female version of that are the female fucking virgin that generally

1088
01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:17.900
fucking speaking and I can speak in generalities considering how they treated

1089
01:06:17.901 --> 01:06:21.530
you.
Um,
all right,
there we go.

1090
01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:26.000
Telling guitarist he's bad.
Hey Billy Bonzo bill,

1091
01:06:26.001 --> 01:06:30.470
I love you and I need you to help.
All right.
I am a 16 year old guy from Egypt.

1092
01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:34.550
That's so fucking cool.
And you listen to this podcast.
That's awesome.
Yes,

1093
01:06:34.551 --> 01:06:36.770
you have fans in Egypt.
Anyway,

1094
01:06:36.771 --> 01:06:40.190
I have been playing guitar for two years now and I started a band with some

1095
01:06:40.191 --> 01:06:45.080
friends.
That's awesome.
A drummer,
a bass player,
and an another guitar player.

1096
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:50.000
Here's the problem.
We're having trouble with the guitar player.
He is flashy.

1097
01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.340
He is a flashy fuck with no talent.

1098
01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:57.580
He never practiced enough as very bad quality guitar and amp learn solos only.

1099
01:06:58.281 --> 01:06:59.930
It doesn't even play them correctly.

1100
01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:04.310
And he wants me to play the rhythm section while he shifts the lead parts.

1101
01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:06.470
I don't have a problem and playing rhythm,

1102
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:10.790
but only if he can play well to put his failure into perspective.

1103
01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:14.870
He's been playing guitar for over six years and most people tell me I'm way

1104
01:07:14.871 --> 01:07:17.510
better than him.
Not trying to be cocky or anything,

1105
01:07:17.511 --> 01:07:21.080
just shitting on him more and more,
uh,
where I live.

1106
01:07:21.081 --> 01:07:24.170
Finding another guitarist who can actually play is very difficult.

1107
01:07:24.171 --> 01:07:28.340
So it's hard to let them go while we have a gig coming in October.

1108
01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:31.850
So should we let them go and find another guy?
And if so,

1109
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:34.250
can we tell him that he is out?

1110
01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:35.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1111
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.020
<v 2>No,
Jesus Christ.
So this,
there's a lot of variables in this one.
All right.</v>

1112
01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:44.070
So if I am to believe that this guy stinks as much as you do and not that this

1113
01:07:45.941 --> 01:07:46.774
is some

1114
01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:52.650
cliched in band fighting where you're playing rhythm and he's playing leads.

1115
01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:55.710
So all the chicks wanna Bang him afterwards and you're standing there like,

1116
01:07:55.711 --> 01:08:00.240
what about me,
y'all remi,
everyone wants to fuck Angus.

1117
01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:04.740
Nobody wants to fuck Malcolm over here.
You know,
um,

1118
01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:07.560
as long as it isn't,
that just guy truly does suck.

1119
01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:11.730
And if you're actually better than him,
then um,

1120
01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:13.360
<v 1>okay,</v>

1121
01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.040
<v 2>why don't you turn yourselves into a power?</v>

1122
01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:16.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1123
01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:20.520
<v 0>You know,
and then all you got to do is have your bass player and your drummer.</v>

1124
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:25.380
We'll give them more space for when you're playing the lead.
Um,

1125
01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:27.870
it would make you a better guitar is to,

1126
01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:31.230
especially if there's some space within those leads and then you could hit a

1127
01:08:31.231 --> 01:08:32.910
couple of fucking the rhythm chords,

1128
01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:36.900
then go put it in and out of the fucking and make you a better guitars.
I mean,

1129
01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.150
I can tell you right now,
Dan,

1130
01:08:39.151 --> 01:08:42.750
if you think this guy's a flashy fuck with no talent and he's not practicing and

1131
01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:45.720
he's been playing three times,
as long as you and you feel you're better,

1132
01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:49.230
I don't see you guys ever coming to a point where you're going to be happy with

1133
01:08:49.231 --> 01:08:52.770
what the fuck he's doing.
Um,
my only question is though,

1134
01:08:52.771 --> 01:08:54.780
you do need some showmanship and the band,

1135
01:08:54.781 --> 01:08:58.650
I would think because sometimes somebody can be better than somebody else,

1136
01:08:58.651 --> 01:09:01.830
but they stand there and they look like a fucking toad waiting for a flight to

1137
01:09:01.831 --> 01:09:02.664
come by.

1138
01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:07.350
And then at that point you literally have to be a musician to understand how

1139
01:09:08.690 --> 01:09:12.650
what they're doing.
Cause there is,
you know,
you also have to entertain people.

1140
01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:17.210
So,
uh,
always flashy shit though.

1141
01:09:17.211 --> 01:09:21.590
That could get you some gigs.
You know what I mean?
In the beginning,

1142
01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:27.620
who knows?
I don't know.
Are you,
you'd have to assess all of that.

1143
01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:28.311
But if you,

1144
01:09:28.311 --> 01:09:31.340
the drummer and the Bass player all on the same page and you just think this

1145
01:09:31.341 --> 01:09:35.060
guy's a flush,
you fuck who's,
who's not bringing anything to the band,

1146
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:40.220
then uh,
then yeah,
I bounced the guy maybe after you gig in October,

1147
01:09:40.221 --> 01:09:42.000
if there's not enough time to find somebody,
know,

1148
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:46.250
maybe play one more fucking Gig and they get rid of them.
Uh,
but if,

1149
01:09:46.251 --> 01:09:49.060
if he's actually,
yeah,

1150
01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.810
there's been a lot of flashy guys that couldn't quite fucking play,

1151
01:09:51.811 --> 01:09:54.120
but they were fun to watch.
And the bands made it.

1152
01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:59.400
So I don't know that,
that,
that part of it is going to have to be up to you.

1153
01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:00.661
But,
uh,

1154
01:10:00.661 --> 01:10:04.200
I think there's opportunity there for you to become an even better guitars if

1155
01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:08.310
you want to try to hold down his parts for a while until you find somebody else

1156
01:10:08.311 --> 01:10:09.001
and then you know what,

1157
01:10:09.001 --> 01:10:11.460
you only have to split the gig money three ways instead of four.

1158
01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:13.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1159
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:16.710
<v 0>All I would say is if you're going to start playing leads,
then uh,</v>

1160
01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:20.170
I would still a little bit of that guy's moves in his fashion sense.

1161
01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:24.710
You know what I mean?
You got to do a couple of things.

1162
01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:30.030
You can't be standing back dead fucking,
I don't know.
Like I said,

1163
01:10:30.031 --> 01:10:31.950
like that towed on a lily pad.
All right.

1164
01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.280
A Canadian politician wants to stunt population growth.

1165
01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:39.930
A Broccoli bill just saw this article about Elizabeth May,
the leader of,

1166
01:10:40.050 --> 01:10:41.100
of our Green party,

1167
01:10:41.101 --> 01:10:45.360
the number for a political party in Canada who supports reducing the world's

1168
01:10:45.361 --> 01:10:49.790
population a figure.
It's up your alley.
That's amazing.
Uh,

1169
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:53.910
here's the link to her party platform.
But since you suck at reading,

1170
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:58.050
here are a few of the main points of what she wants to do.
That's hilarious.

1171
01:10:58.051 --> 01:11:00.780
I was even struggling reading that sentence.
Uh,
one,

1172
01:11:00.781 --> 01:11:05.370
integrate goals for reduced fertility in the overall effort to eliminate
poverty.

1173
01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:08.690
Uh,
what does that mean?

1174
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:09.860
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1175
01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.630
<v 0>she wants to sterilize poor people.</v>

1176
01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:14.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1177
01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:18.370
<v 0>Uh,
this does not sound green.
This sounds like brown shirt.
Uh,</v>

1178
01:11:18.371 --> 01:11:23.050
realize that failure to stabilize and reduce human population will result in the

1179
01:11:23.051 --> 01:11:26.980
inevitable reduction of human population by means of high death rates as the

1180
01:11:26.981 --> 01:11:31.690
Earth's human carrying capacity is not only exceeded but reduced by the

1181
01:11:31.691 --> 01:11:35.830
consumption of resources and the destruction of biological capitol resulting in

1182
01:11:35.831 --> 01:11:37.450
poverty,
starvation,
disease,

1183
01:11:37.451 --> 01:11:41.140
great human suffering and possibly social disruption apps.

1184
01:11:41.141 --> 01:11:45.400
A fucking Luli check all of those off.
Uh,

1185
01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:49.150
integrate goals for improved healthcare and spreading knowledge of birth control

1186
01:11:49.151 --> 01:11:52.210
methods and efforts than increase the availability of the ability of birth

1187
01:11:52.211 --> 01:11:57.211
control equipment and supplies into the overall efforts to eliminate poverty for

1188
01:11:57.401 --> 01:12:01.120
recognize that the high level of per capita resource consumption and developed

1189
01:12:01.121 --> 01:12:04.720
countries makes the impact of their population much more serious.

1190
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:07.570
Stoked to see you in Toronto for a couple of weeks.
Just uh,

1191
01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.920
just for last and thanks for the podcast.
You Dope.
Um,

1192
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:14.170
well it's freaking is stupid.

1193
01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:17.800
You're going to fucking see me next week unless this is leftover from awhile
ago.

1194
01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.720
You actually get to see me this week,
so it's not a couple of weeks.
Um,

1195
01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:26.760
what I think needs to be done is I think that there just needs to be from top to

1196
01:12:27.581 --> 01:12:32.581
bottom information on what the human population is doing to the oceans,

1197
01:12:33.701 --> 01:12:37.470
to the air,
to the trees,
to all of that type of shit.
And at this point is not,

1198
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:42.160
this is not even tree hugger shit.
This is just literally fact.
Um,

1199
01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.010
that just needs to be way less fucking people.

1200
01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.550
And if you just like,

1201
01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:52.270
I was going to say prognosticated is that actually worried if you just
projected,

1202
01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:57.300
if you just showed what the fuck we're headed towards and you scared the fuck

1203
01:12:57.701 --> 01:13:02.650
out of people and you somehow,
this is why it's not going to work.

1204
01:13:02.651 --> 01:13:07.030
You've got to get everybody on the same page and you've got to get people to
not,

1205
01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:09.690
uh,
act selfishly.

1206
01:13:09.691 --> 01:13:14.691
It's like if there's a fucking plane crash right into the fucking mountains and

1207
01:13:15.271 --> 01:13:19.230
the survivors are sitting there and they pulled together all the resources they

1208
01:13:19.231 --> 01:13:22.560
have and they're all on the same team,
no matter what,

1209
01:13:22.561 --> 01:13:26.760
there's always going to be that person who's out for themselves.
Okay.

1210
01:13:26.761 --> 01:13:28.800
And that's just in a group of fucking 20 people.

1211
01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:32.850
So if you just factor that in into 7 billion people,

1212
01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:36.810
the amount of people that are out there for themselves,
um,

1213
01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:42.230
I don't think that it works and I think that we are,

1214
01:13:42.271 --> 01:13:45.930
uh,
we are doomed to.

1215
01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:51.540
So that second paragraph with is,
uh,

1216
01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:56.010
you know,
resulting in poverty,
starvation,
disease,

1217
01:13:56.011 --> 01:13:58.530
great human suffering and possible social disruption.

1218
01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.000
I think that that's going to happen.

1219
01:14:00.001 --> 01:14:04.440
I think the upper 1% realizes that and I think they're insulating themselves.

1220
01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:05.993
Um,

1221
01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:10.950
from that inevitability by pooling the resources for themselves,

1222
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.030
turning places into police states,

1223
01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:17.140
getting rid of rights and living in gated communities.
They are all set.

1224
01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:22.510
All right.
They are all set for all of that shit that happened.
Um,

1225
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:26.890
and that's just my paranoid fucking 2 cents.
Um,
anyways,

1226
01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:32.770
so that's a podcast here for this week.
Um,
I'll send you that,

1227
01:14:32.771 --> 01:14:37.300
that video of the porpoises swimming through the ocean while there's still
there.

1228
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:42.130
And,
uh,
what else?
I think that's it.

1229
01:14:42.131 --> 01:14:45.160
I got an Ohio,
so I got to run a dates this week,
man.
If you're in Texas.

1230
01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.560
All right,
I'm going to be in Austin for two shows tonight.

1231
01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:51.130
I'm going to be in San Antonio.
I'm going to be in Dallas,

1232
01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.900
I'm going to be in Houston.
Um,
is that it?
I think that that is it.

1233
01:14:56.020 --> 01:15:00.550
No El Paso on this run.
No college station,
no Corpus Christi.

1234
01:15:00.551 --> 01:15:03.100
None of that shit.
So,
you know,
you might have to drive a little bit,

1235
01:15:03.101 --> 01:15:07.000
but I'm driving all over the Aha to Texas and I'm,

1236
01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:10.090
and on Sunday I'm going to be at the just for laughs in Toronto.

1237
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:16.210
I got a whole new hour is shit.
I am rested up sort of from,

1238
01:15:16.330 --> 01:15:21.010
uh,
my,
uh,
my week out there and then tuck it.
And,

1239
01:15:21.011 --> 01:15:24.670
um,
I'm not really rusted up.
I smoked a fucking cigar every day.

1240
01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:28.570
I smoked two on one day and I am fucking spent.

1241
01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:33.730
But that'll give me fuel for my standup act.
So anyways,

1242
01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:38.740
uh,
I think that's it.
That's the podcasts.
Go fuck yourselves.

1243
01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:42.270
I will tell.
I'll check on Thursday.
See you.
