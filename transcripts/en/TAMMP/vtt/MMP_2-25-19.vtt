00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.090
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:06.720
It's bill burn is time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.700
February 25th,

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.280
2019 what's going on?
How?
Why?
Yeah,

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.960
I'm recording this in New York City right before I get on a plane to go fly to

6
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:21.080
London.
Um,

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.120
do my little run through a the UK tape my special and then come home and I ain't

8
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:31.230
doin shit.
Shit.
I'm taping this Sunday,

9
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:35.400
the 24th I'm tough day.
Definitely a tough day.

10
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.730
They have in this memorial for a Steven Brody Stevens

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.290
tonight at the comedy store and unfortunately I'm in New York and I can't be

12
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:48.291
there and I'm crushed that I can't be there and a sale.

13
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:50.880
The things I would have liked to have said,

14
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.540
which really is the strange thing about when somebody dies,

15
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:57.480
do you ever notice when somebody dies then you somehow,
immediately,

16
00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:00.870
no emotionally exactly what you wished you have.

17
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.350
You would have said to the person,
it's really weird,

18
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:08.130
but I kind of get it because that's a heavy thing to do to somebody.
Like,

19
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:10.620
what would I say to this person if I knew they were going to die tomorrow?

20
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.300
If you just fucking hit them with that,

21
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:14.370
whether it's sitting there eating a fucking Cobb salad,

22
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.800
they're going to be looking at you like,
whoa dude.
Hey,

23
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.890
let's try to keep it light here.
Okay.
Um,

24
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.560
but I just,
that fucking guy,
my God,
that fucking guy,

25
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.720
that guy made me laugh.

26
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.810
Like I don't even know how to describe it.
The W and it was the way,

27
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:37.010
like nobody ever made me laugh that hard.
The way he made me laugh,

28
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.420
it was completely 100%.

29
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.800
Just a unique,
unique,
unique sense of humor.
Um,

30
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.550
just really,
you know what's funny is I've been,

31
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.380
I've been talking to all of these comics about them over the last couple of days

32
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:57.940
here and we're all like quoting his jokes and it's like,
if you don't know Brody,

33
00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.021
it,
it's,

34
00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:02.480
it's kind of like you kind of have to know him and he kind of had to be familiar

35
00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:07.010
with this act to under,
cause it was his fucking cadence half the time.

36
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.150
Like,
um,
it's a good example.

37
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:12.890
I remember one time I was down the comedy store,

38
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.320
we were in the main room and I was with my wife,

39
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:20.321
Nia in Brody went on stage and I swear to God that fucking genius went on stage

40
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:26.831
and for 10 minutes to scribed his dream apartment and there was no set ups,

41
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.610
no punchlines.

42
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.080
He was just describing in like this sort of,

43
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.770
I can't even,

44
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.770
it was like Zillow speak meets like this amazing comedic cadence.

45
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.740
I don't even,
I can't even remember what he said.

46
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.730
Me and Neil would just looking at each other and were just dying laughing.

47
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.650
I just,
it was like,
you know,
ceiling to floor windows,

48
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.950
stepping down into the living room.

49
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.450
And when he said that wife literally almost fell out of her chair.

50
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.840
I know this won't seem funny to a lot of you because you didn't know him and I,

51
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.830
nobody can recreate what that the way that that guy did what he did.

52
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.620
But when he said stepping down into living room,

53
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.300
like I just put my head down on the table and was crying,

54
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:17.740
laughing at the same time.

55
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:22.090
Also for the first time ever in my life noticing,

56
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.850
um,
how much reverence,
if that's the right word,

57
00:03:26.851 --> 00:03:31.110
that I held anybody.
Like any room that you stepped down in,

58
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.000
into,
in an apartment is unbelievably classy.

59
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.340
And I had no idea that I thought that.

60
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.550
And I think the whole crowd along with me suddenly realized in that moment that

61
00:03:43.711 --> 00:03:48.711
like we all felt that and had never expressed it and Brody had just expressed it

62
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.970
and,
and he acted it out,

63
00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:55.770
stepping down and he sort of crouched into the living room and,

64
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:59.970
uh,
it was just amazing,
you know?
And it wasn't,
and also to like,

65
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.370
probably behind all of that on the underneath was the sadness of,
of,
of,

66
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:05.641
you know,

67
00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:08.820
like what he wanted and was he going to get it and all of that type of stuff

68
00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:13.590
that it was just very relatable.
And um,
I don't know,

69
00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:15.210
man.
It's like,
I have this weird,

70
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.800
this is a weird one where I'm really sad selfishly for myself,

71
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:24.630
but I'm not like,
I don't know,
I'm not the most spiritual guy,
but I just,

72
00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:29.220
I feel like,
you know,
his,
his journey was like complete,

73
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:33.330
I guess,
you know,
that's how I have to look at it or else it becomes too sad.

74
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.950
And when I really look at how we affected everybody and just the fucking

75
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.410
outpouring that was on,
um,
Twitter and out of sight,

76
00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:44.100
he would have been that,
you know,
that he,

77
00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:48.120
that he was trending on Twitter for two days now.
Um,

78
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.330
I dunno,
it was just,
it was really that,

79
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:55.320
that part of it was like a cool thing to see.
And I,
I used to,

80
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.880
I tried to sit down and watch that show that he did with,

81
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.580
uh,
Zach Galifianakis,
by the way,

82
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:07.350
shout out to Zach for loaning his name,
but that's so Brody could do that show.

83
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.120
And,
um,
it was just too soon to sit there and watch it and watch them struggle.

84
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.490
I just can't imagine having them,
um,
uh,

85
00:05:14.491 --> 00:05:17.320
mental illness where you're,

86
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:22.321
you just literally just walking around fighting your own brain in the way that

87
00:05:23.311 --> 00:05:27.780
he was able to do that and not lash out at other people and just be so kind and

88
00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:32.580
so sweet to everybody and just so fucking funny,
man.
It's like,

89
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.500
it's really,
it's,
it's an end of an era in,

90
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.490
um,
at the comedy store like this,

91
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.290
there's really not going to be,
there's not,
there's no,

92
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:50.910
there was nobody before or after him that,
well,
that was,
that was like that guy.

93
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.770
And furthermore,
he truly,
in the purest sense was a,

94
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.293
um,

95
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.710
was it comic's comic where a lot of times that gets thrown around,

96
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.460
Oh,
this guy's a comic comic,

97
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:09.461
or she's comic's comic and it's somebody that's also selling a lot of tickets.

98
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:13.580
It's almost like,
it means it's a comedian that made it,

99
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:16.730
but other comedians still like that person

100
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.240
don't resent their success is sort of the way a comic's comic is sort of these,

101
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.110
I guess,
definition of it,
if the way I kind of see it.

102
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:32.060
But Brody was,
he was,

103
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.560
he was a comic's comic in that he was really for us,

104
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.290
like the wait staff and people that manage comics and people who had watched

105
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:47.291
that amount of comedy to understand how unique he was and how different he was.

106
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.350
And I loved going on the Internet now and all these people were just discovering

107
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:53.910
them.
And some people get number.
There's a lot of people being like,
this guy is,

108
00:06:53.911 --> 00:06:56.900
it's funny,
this guy sucks.
Um,
I'm sure you guys are sad,

109
00:06:56.901 --> 00:07:00.410
but this guy saw that makes me feel even better.
It's like,
yeah,
you don't get it.

110
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.400
You don't get it.
Cause you're not a fucking comedian.
And,
and,

111
00:07:03.401 --> 00:07:04.820
and you just have like,

112
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.630
you know where your comedic IR is,

113
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:11.270
is take two guys walk into a bar and the rabbi says like,

114
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:12.770
you're not going to get this fucking guy.

115
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:16.330
Like you have to watch a lot of comedy to see,
um,

116
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.500
how funny this guy was.
And,
uh,
I'm,
I'm really gonna miss him in,
Oh man.

117
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.370
I remember when I was doing a,
I was,
what was it,

118
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:29.870
the odd ball,
the eyeball tour.
And,

119
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.620
uh,
I had gone on,
the crowd was fucking,
you know,
it's like,

120
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.270
I dunno fucking eight,

121
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:39.580
9,000 people and it was shit and it's just a such a rush to be on in front of,

122
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.210
in Brody was hosting and Chris Delea was going on next.

123
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.830
And uh,
I've always loved Chris.
Like,
he just was like,
you know,

124
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:52.400
he reminded me of like a Boston comic where as far as like,

125
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.250
he could get up in front of from early on,

126
00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:57.650
get up in front of a big crowd and kill it.

127
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:02.000
A level that was considering headlining the way I learned what it sounds like,

128
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:05.990
what killing sounded like he was doing.
So,

129
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.670
um,
you know,
he was on his way out and I was saying,

130
00:08:10.671 --> 00:08:13.040
I'll do you wait till you go out there,
it's going to be fucking amazing.

131
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.180
And I asked him,
I was like,
you want me to take a picture?
Uh,

132
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.560
or I don't know if I asked him what up.

133
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:23.090
So he was walking out and I wanted to take a picture of Chris right when he got

134
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:25.010
to the microphone because the lights were up.

135
00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:27.890
And you could see how big the crowd was and I thought it'd be a cool thing for

136
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.020
him to have and retweet or whatever.

137
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.650
And I was just focused on Chris and Brodie had done the fucking intro and I

138
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:40.620
didn't realize he was in frame when it,

139
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:43.070
cause I was just looking at Chris to try and frame it and I,

140
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.620
I like the picture and I was unaware that Steven did this,

141
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.410
you know with his baseball background,
he has a pitcher and a,

142
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:57.860
I forget we pitched Arizona,
Arizona State,
I think it was Arizona State,

143
00:08:57.861 --> 00:09:01.610
I'm not sure.
And He,
you don't,
you know that warm up that pitchers do.

144
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.520
Like whenever you see like spring training before the game where they're walking

145
00:09:04.521 --> 00:09:09.140
and they put their hand out like straight out in front of them and like above

146
00:09:09.141 --> 00:09:11.810
their head and then they just kick their leg up with their toe,

147
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.490
their cleat or their toe touches their hand.
I guess he used to do that.
I,

148
00:09:16.491 --> 00:09:19.640
that was the first time I ever saw him do it.
And when I click the photo,

149
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:24.670
he was walking off stage doing that and he had literally kicked his foot.

150
00:09:24.771 --> 00:09:27.320
Was that the apex almost touching his hand with his,

151
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.090
his head tucked down a little bit and I,

152
00:09:32.091 --> 00:09:36.020
it just,
I saw that and I just thought it just,
it was just so him,

153
00:09:36.021 --> 00:09:38.990
I just started fucking laughing and I was just as a comedian,

154
00:09:38.991 --> 00:09:43.370
like why did he do that?
Was was that for the crowd?

155
00:09:43.371 --> 00:09:48.140
Was that for him?
What was the person in the crowd as they're watching crystal,

156
00:09:48.141 --> 00:09:52.700
Leah walking on stage and then in the peripheral they just see this guy walking

157
00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:57.050
off kicking his fucking phone up to his head,

158
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.220
like a spring training fucking picture and the,
and the grapefruit league.

159
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:06.020
And for the rest of that fucking tour,
you know,
when you know,

160
00:10:06.021 --> 00:10:07.160
you get lonely on the road,

161
00:10:07.161 --> 00:10:10.250
I would just look at that picture and I would just die laughing.

162
00:10:10.251 --> 00:10:14.330
And so many people that I showed who weren't in standup didn't understand why

163
00:10:14.331 --> 00:10:15.350
that they would just sort of like,
wow,

164
00:10:15.351 --> 00:10:17.360
that guy can kick his foot up a high or whatever.

165
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:20.810
They didn't get it or it wasn't hitting them the way it was hitting me,

166
00:10:20.811 --> 00:10:25.140
but I just,
um,
I don't know man.
Uh,

167
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.360
I don't know what else to say.
I just,
I just,
uh,
it's,
it's just,

168
00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:32.300
it's really obviously really sad,
but I just was,

169
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.690
I don't know the way that guy touched me by what he did.
I,

170
00:10:35.691 --> 00:10:37.160
I have this weird sort of,

171
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.263
<v 2>mmm.</v>

172
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.070
<v 1>I Dunno.
I can't yet,
definitely am really,
really sad,</v>

173
00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:47.120
but it's not that same kind of sadness.
Um,
and I'm not the most spiritual guy,

174
00:10:47.121 --> 00:10:51.470
but if there's,
if there's anything,
he's there,
you know,
after this cause,

175
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.590
uh,
I dunno,
I,

176
00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:58.020
I never heard anybody say one bad fucking word about that guy.

177
00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:02.730
He's always such a night and he's fucking hilarious and all that.
So anyways,

178
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.490
there goes another one,
so.

179
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:07.833
<v 2>MMM.</v>

180
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:12.350
<v 1>I Dunno,
I guess,
I don't know.
He would get frustrated.
I mean,
the whole fucking,</v>

181
00:11:12.351 --> 00:11:16.760
his whole thing is just like,
his whole life was like an Oscar winning movie.

182
00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.613
<v 2>Okay.</v>

183
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.280
<v 1>As far as the way he battled,</v>

184
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.960
like what he battled and I'll positive he stayed.

185
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:28.991
And like,

186
00:11:28.991 --> 00:11:33.220
I always wondered like what that what it was like for him to have all like the

187
00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:36.250
best comics being like,
dude,
you'd like one of the funniest guys ever.

188
00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:40.930
And then not getting that from the mainstream in a while,

189
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.080
you know,
battling all that other shit I mean and and the,

190
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.120
and to not turn bitter and not be a fucking asshole.
He says it's unbelievable.

191
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:54.160
It really is.
So
I now that like his life

192
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.510
<v 2>is complete,
like kind of looking back on it,
it was like,</v>

193
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:03.490
it was weird.
Like he was on his,
what's that grateful dead song?

194
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.930
It reminded me of that you know that that song ripple.
Okay.

195
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.710
<v 1>Where they say,
uh,
what the fuck,
how does that lyric go?
Let me look this up here.</v>

196
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:16.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

197
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.310
<v 1>It says there,
there's a road,</v>

198
00:12:17.311 --> 00:12:21.300
no simple highway between the dawn and the dark and night.

199
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.820
And if you go,
no one may follow that path is meant for your steps alone.

200
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.150
Yeah.
I feel like if they ever do like a documentary,

201
00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:35.030
which I'm sure they're going to like,
that should be okay.

202
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.320
That should be the tone because I don't know,

203
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.030
I don't know if I'm saying this right,
but like,
yeah,

204
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.180
I don't know what that guy did was just so fucking unique in this.

205
00:12:47.181 --> 00:12:52.130
There's a loneliness to be in that fucking unique.
And the fact,

206
00:12:52.131 --> 00:12:52.641
like I said,

207
00:12:52.641 --> 00:12:55.910
that he didn't turn into a fucking asshole about it and was just so nice and

208
00:12:55.911 --> 00:12:57.450
supportive to everybody.
Okay.

209
00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:58.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>

210
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.730
<v 1>You know,
I dunno,
I don't measure up to that.
Put it that way.</v>

211
00:13:03.731 --> 00:13:04.564
So,

212
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:07.303
<v 2>okay.</v>

213
00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.000
<v 1>Thank you to Brody Stevens and all of it.
Steven Brody,
Stevens,</v>

214
00:13:11.001 --> 00:13:16.001
all those fucking times you made me laugh and everybody else and uh,

215
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.500
I dunno.
I think for the rest of my life I'm going to be going.
Yes,

216
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.660
you got it.
It just feels good to say it.
I,
I mean,

217
00:13:26.661 --> 00:13:29.360
half of my conversations I think I had with him,

218
00:13:29.361 --> 00:13:32.780
sadly enough was just me imitating him.

219
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.450
He was so fun.
I would just start talking,
talking like him.

220
00:13:38.451 --> 00:13:42.660
So anyways,
that's my 2 cents and um,

221
00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.350
there's a bunch of clips of them.
If this made you interested,
uh,

222
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.290
definitely look them up and,
uh,
all right.
I guess,

223
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.980
I don't know.
What the fuck do you go from there?
Jesus Christ.
Dude,
look,

224
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:55.770
<v 2>okay.</v>

225
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.340
<v 1>Uh,
this is what being oldest now.</v>

226
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.080
I mean it's just fucking every black,

227
00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.500
the comics die more than other people because I,
I,
you know,

228
00:14:06.501 --> 00:14:09.740
I have a whole list of everybody that died cause I don't want to forget him and

229
00:14:09.741 --> 00:14:11.990
I'm up to like fucking 32 comedians,

230
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.850
<v 2>you know,</v>

231
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.590
<v 1>all guys to every single one of them.
That's how you,</v>

232
00:14:19.591 --> 00:14:22.650
for all the bitch and the women are doing standup.
At least you're still alive.

233
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.540
You could still do sets.
Um,

234
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.660
I was actually talking to de Rosa and we would just,

235
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.680
and we would tell him Steven Brody Stevens fucking stories.

236
00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.520
Um,
it's the weirdest thing like on this,
cause all these people that have died,

237
00:14:44.521 --> 00:14:46.590
there's always been like a sadness and blah,
blah,
blah.

238
00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:50.790
And with everybody I've talked to about,

239
00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:56.010
it's like you end up crying,
laughing,
telling stories rather than crying,

240
00:14:56.011 --> 00:15:00.930
crying,
you know,
and we were trying to remember his,
another guy,

241
00:15:00.931 --> 00:15:04.380
you should look up as far as like,
just fucking hilarious.
Who Died?

242
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.163
<v 2>MMM.</v>

243
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.770
<v 1>Is it a comic?
Rasheed Thurmond,
t,
H,
u,
R,
m.
O.
N.
D.</v>

244
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:15.300
And he died right when I went to La and I remember a young guy to like 36 37

245
00:15:15.301 --> 00:15:17.850
years old.
It was another,
another great one.

246
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.300
So anyways,
where the fuck do you go from there?
Um,

247
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.650
I've been running my set here in New York City,
New York City,

248
00:15:25.651 --> 00:15:28.950
one of the most caring comedy crowds.

249
00:15:28.951 --> 00:15:31.500
You're going to be in front of Jesus Christ.

250
00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.530
I sweat.
I feel like a three year comic when I perform in New York City.

251
00:15:37.531 --> 00:15:41.940
Now I don't know what the fuck is going on.

252
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.080
Um,
part of it's me because of this,

253
00:15:46.081 --> 00:15:48.840
the overly sensitive fucking horse shit that's going on.

254
00:15:48.841 --> 00:15:52.860
It's forcing me to go in the other direction,

255
00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.480
you know,
to just,
it's just,
it's the,
you know,

256
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.840
it's the balance of the universe.
It's like if,

257
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.990
if you're going to fucking
try to push me in this,

258
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:10.590
this direction,
I'm going to fucking go on the other one.
Like if you,

259
00:16:10.591 --> 00:16:13.650
if you back off then I'm not going to be as much of an asshole on stage,

260
00:16:13.651 --> 00:16:16.440
but if you're going to be fucking sitting there getting in my grill every time I

261
00:16:16.441 --> 00:16:19.440
fucking say something,
it's good.
It makes you,
it makes you

262
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.280
go hopefully even further in the other direction because comics were telling me

263
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.910
they're going on stage out here and,

264
00:16:25.911 --> 00:16:29.020
and see other comedians in front of just a regular crowd.

265
00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:32.320
It's not a benefit like I get if you're doing a cancer benefit,
they go,
hey,

266
00:16:32.321 --> 00:16:35.500
just don't do any cancer jokes.
I get that,
but it's just a comedy show.

267
00:16:35.501 --> 00:16:38.490
And they go and don't talk about this.
Don't talk about that.
They'll talk.

268
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:39.640
Katie's fucking,

269
00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.123
<v 2>these</v>

270
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:47.590
<v 1>people are going to undo everything that Lenny Carlin and prior these guys went</v>

271
00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:53.350
to jail.
They went to jail.
So you know,

272
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.140
and because they did that,
believe it or not,

273
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.680
a lot of these female comics that are on stage now talking about their fucking

274
00:16:59.681 --> 00:17:04.000
vaginas for 45 minutes,
you wouldn't be able to do that if it wasn't for them.

275
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.800
And now it's becoming this fucking thing where I don't,
I don't know.
I don't,

276
00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:12.880
I really just am baffled and every time I think like,
okay,

277
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:17.910
well we're going to come out of this ridiculously childish time and stand up

278
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:22.670
where,
where everybody is acting like comedians of all the sudden presenting

279
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:27.671
legislation that is going to be turned into law rather than,

280
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:31.340
it's just up there.
Somebody just,
just being an idiot.
Um,

281
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.800
<v 2>I dunno,
I was doing this</v>

282
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:40.900
<v 1>some fucking club.
I'm not going to say the club was to the club and like,
uh,</v>

283
00:17:40.901 --> 00:17:44.570
I was making fun of white women how they act like they're oppressed.

284
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.210
You know what I mean?
When they're really just sitting in the Jacuzzi with me,

285
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.073
you know,

286
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.160
how they get sidestep their white privilege because they weren't allowed to vote

287
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:56.940
90 years ago,
you know,
so,
um,
oh,

288
00:17:56.941 --> 00:17:59.700
just got the right to vote 90 years ago,
whatever the fuck a hundred years ago.

289
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.890
Um,
you know,

290
00:18:01.891 --> 00:18:05.550
obviously just being a dick and this white woman in the crowd just goes,

291
00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:10.050
I just guys fuck.
Just like that.
Right.

292
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:15.180
And uh,
I'm like that.
That's all you got.
She's like,
what?

293
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:20.040
I had to say it like she's literally patting yourself on the back for how brave.

294
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:21.300
She was fucking hilarious.

295
00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:26.301
He was just like the complete lack of passion and fire.

296
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.280
The way she protested what I said just,

297
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:33.540
it just really shows like how unaffected you are,
but by,

298
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.420
by whatever the fuck it is you're complaining about.
You know what I mean?

299
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.930
Truly oppressed people when they heckle.
When you say you crossed the line,

300
00:18:39.931 --> 00:18:44.490
when they fucking heckle you,
you feel like,
oh fuck,
I went too far.
It isn't,

301
00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:47.070
you don't sound like I was saying she sound like she was down the bottom of a

302
00:18:47.071 --> 00:18:48.840
well,
hey,

303
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:59.310
so anyways,
I dunno,

304
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.450
I was not bringing these Steven Brody Stevens positive vibes to that show.

305
00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.020
I was a,
I was being a bit of a Dick,
so whatever I'll take,

306
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:11.760
I always take my 50% of it,
you know?
Um,
so anyways,

307
00:19:11.761 --> 00:19:15.390
I go on to London today.
Let's look up wearable freckles is going to be,

308
00:19:15.391 --> 00:19:18.780
I don't even know.
I think I started Liverpool,
which I'm very excited about.

309
00:19:18.781 --> 00:19:23.670
She loves you.
Yay.
Yay Liverpool.
Right.
That's where a the four fucking,

310
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.870
uh,
my petty concert from the Beatles.

311
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:33.330
Let's see here.
Let's go to my website,
[inaudible] dot com everybody,

312
00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:37.530
if you're following along in your program,
[inaudible] dot com I'm going to be,

313
00:19:37.531 --> 00:19:41.100
yes,
I'll be in Liverpool.
Oh,
would you look at that?

314
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.720
Not until the 26th.
So I actually get an extra day here.
I fly today.

315
00:19:45.721 --> 00:19:48.510
Today's the 24th.
By the time I land will be the 25th.

316
00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:51.480
That gives me a chance to fucking chill out.
I'm there for two days.

317
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.220
Roommate has it.
Most sal is coming to the show.
Kidding.

318
00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.580
I really fell out following fucking soccer.
I tried,
I fucking tried.

319
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.960
Uh,
Jim Breuer has the funniest fucking bit about Americans trying to get into

320
00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:11.250
soccer.
Go once every four years.
You'd try to get into it.

321
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:16.650
You buy the Jersey and he just starts imitating them flopping all over the
place.

322
00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:19.170
But I will say this,
I do really,

323
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:22.710
really enjoy this sport now and I do see the beauty in the skill and all of that

324
00:20:22.711 --> 00:20:24.090
shit now.
Like,
you know,

325
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:29.570
I'm not 100% the stupid yag making fun of the world's most popular sport and uh,

326
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.620
it is an all faking cause I saw mo salad a couple of times on a breakaway.

327
00:20:36.961 --> 00:20:38.010
That's what they call it.
And hockey.

328
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:42.900
I don't know what the fuck they call it in uh,
in your football over there.

329
00:20:42.901 --> 00:20:47.730
But like he's in the clear in this guy just runs up behind him and sticks his

330
00:20:47.731 --> 00:20:50.820
leg out and dragged his clique down the back of his fucking calf.

331
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.460
But what was funny,
cause he was on the breakaway,

332
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.300
most shook it off and then kick the,
you know,
kicked it in the net.

333
00:20:57.301 --> 00:21:00.360
But if he was anywhere else,
he would have collapsed on the field,

334
00:21:00.361 --> 00:21:03.060
like he got shot.
Although having said all that,

335
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:08.200
I would not want somebody do that to me.
So it's not all,
uh,
it's not all faking.

336
00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:12.880
So I'm in Liverpool and the 26 and the 27th,
28th,

337
00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:16.750
I'm in Glasgow.
Uh,

338
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.300
and then the 29th I'm off.
And then the,

339
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.970
the first in second amen.

340
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.010
Birmingham and then Manchester,
legendary Manchester.

341
00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.760
Uh,
and then where Yo,

342
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:36.020
and then I have two days off,
what the fuck?

343
00:21:36.021 --> 00:21:38.630
Then I get two days off.
And then I,
um,

344
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.250
at Royal Albert Hall on the fourth and fifth taping my next standup special.
And,

345
00:21:43.251 --> 00:21:47.940
um,
you know what I was,
uh,

346
00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:53.260
watching all these clips on Steven Brody Stevens and I came across,

347
00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:58.270
I went to his Instagram and all of that stuff.
And,
uh,

348
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.200
I was watching,
I don't know,

349
00:22:01.201 --> 00:22:06.201
somehow I ended up coming across this quote that Zach Galifianakis had that I'm

350
00:22:06.271 --> 00:22:09.690
really going to take to heart because I've been just working my fucking ass off.

351
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:15.360
And it was basically saying,
you know,
don't feel like you have to be,
you know,

352
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:19.410
working all the fucking time.
I don't,
I can't paraphrase,

353
00:22:19.411 --> 00:22:22.520
he said it perfectly of course,
but I kind of took it to heart like,
you know,

354
00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:26.160
what if I just fucking chilled out for a couple of weeks?

355
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:31.423
Um,

356
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.340
I got that German Irish thing where you just go until one day you fucking like,

357
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.780
oh,
what's that pain in my chest?

358
00:22:36.781 --> 00:22:39.780
And then you just fall forward into your fucking mushy peas.
And then that's it.

359
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:44.850
MMM.
So I'm going to try to,
uh,

360
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.380
I want to try to be around for a few.
I mean,

361
00:22:46.381 --> 00:22:49.470
I don't know how long I could do it because there is a part of me that goes

362
00:22:49.471 --> 00:22:53.190
fucking nuts after four days of not doing stand up.
But,
uh,

363
00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:57.600
I think I'm going to go a little bit easy here over the next couple of months in

364
00:22:57.601 --> 00:23:00.600
rather than they just run out.
Because what I usually do is I immediately,

365
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.100
I'll take like two days off after I do a special night,

366
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.430
really immediately get right back to the club.
And I,
and I,

367
00:23:05.431 --> 00:23:08.460
I tried to get it going again.
And,
um,

368
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.620
I think this time when I'm going to do is actually take a little bit of time off

369
00:23:13.991 --> 00:23:17.530
from doing stand up and,
and rather than just trying to force a new hour,

370
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.990
I'll go live a life that sorta writes the next hour.
Hopefully.

371
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:27.620
Hopefully that'll happen now.
Watch you guys later on this year.
You know,

372
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.590
right after my special comes out,
I just saw him.

373
00:23:29.591 --> 00:23:34.591
It's like half the same jokes that it's fucking freckled conch sucks.

374
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:41.040
Um,
all right,
so there's 23 minutes.
I don't have the advertising reads yet,

375
00:23:41.041 --> 00:23:45.900
so I'm going to finish this one tomorrow when I'm overseas.
Uh,

376
00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.340
once again,
I'm absolutely,
um,

377
00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.900
heartbroken that's such a special person.

378
00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.100
Like Stephen is no longer with us,
but I am like

379
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:03.530
so inspired by the life that he lived and so happy to have known him only a

380
00:24:03.531 --> 00:24:07.490
little bit as this little as I know him and uh,

381
00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:10.520
that I actually got to see him and

382
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.380
I dunno man.
It's,
I don't want,

383
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:19.430
it's the weirdest feeling I've ever had after somebody I had known that's died

384
00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:24.140
where it's just like he just,
there's even a attic,
a happiness.

385
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:27.170
I have just,
I mean,
you know what it was,

386
00:24:27.171 --> 00:24:31.130
I think because I just looked at his life and saw the effect that he had on

387
00:24:31.131 --> 00:24:33.890
people and you know,
when he just kind of think like,
yeah,
man,
he got it.

388
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.690
He got it.
You know,

389
00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.043
<v 0>he</v>

390
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:42.230
<v 1>was a,
yeah,
just a,
an unbelievably positive,</v>

391
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:47.480
positive force.
And the lesson I learned when Patrice died is that,
you know,

392
00:24:47.481 --> 00:24:50.450
you don't own these people.
They're just gifts that you get.

393
00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:51.210
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

394
00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:55.530
<v 1>And you don't get to decide when they go.
And that's sort of the,</v>

395
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.800
a cruel thing that you continue to learn.

396
00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.410
<v 0>But,
um,</v>

397
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.380
<v 1>I don't know,
looking at his body of work,
you know,</v>

398
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.120
I know personally I'm going to try to be a little bit less of a content,

399
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.360
try to live up to the high standard that,
that he said.
All right.
Okay.

400
00:25:12.361 --> 00:25:12.811
And with that,

401
00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:17.700
I'll read some advertising here from London and with the magic of editing,

402
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.360
this will only be a half a second delay.
Okay.

403
00:25:21.361 --> 00:25:25.560
And through the magic of editing,
I am now in Liverpool,
England,

404
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:31.780
that only took half a second through the wonderful world of editing.

405
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:32.763
<v 3>MMM.</v>

406
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.960
<v 1>Jay says Christ.
Oh God.</v>

407
00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:38.460
<v 3>MMM.</v>

408
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.160
<v 1>So I'm in Liverpool now.
The driver was going,
you know,</v>

409
00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.210
you can go see where the Beatles fucking did all their first shows,

410
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.470
which I really think that's gotta be like the cheers of Liverpool.

411
00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:59.630
Just going to walk in there.
Yep.
Right over there.
Right over there.
Where the,

412
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.320
where they're not right now.
That's where they were.

413
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:04.503
<v 3>MMM.</v>

414
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.510
<v 1>I Dunno,
I'm just,
I don't have a show tonight,</v>

415
00:26:08.511 --> 00:26:12.800
so I'm just sitting here trying to figure out the goddamn heating system here,

416
00:26:12.801 --> 00:26:16.010
which I can't figure out.
I don't know how to turn it on.

417
00:26:16.011 --> 00:26:18.020
I pressed every fucking button and you know,

418
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:20.690
I brought a fucking adapter and whenever I bring them mixer,

419
00:26:20.691 --> 00:26:23.660
I always blow out my fucking mixer.
And Lo and behold,

420
00:26:23.661 --> 00:26:27.740
I plugged it in before I plugged it into the mixer and I just heard the,

421
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.010
the plug just goes like,
Eh,
no.
It was just like,
well,

422
00:26:31.011 --> 00:26:33.680
I just fried that fucking thing.
Even with the fucking adapter.

423
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:34.790
I don't know how it happens.

424
00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.813
<v 3>MMM.</v>

425
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.990
<v 1>It didn't fry my computer,
but my computer has three prompts.</v>

426
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:45.200
That mixer only has two.
Is that what the,
is somewhere in there?

427
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:48.840
Was it not grounded?
Was there too much of a surge?

428
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:53.760
Any electricians that can help me out?
I have no fucking idea.

460
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:56.270
Um,
all right,
let's talk about some shit here.

461
00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:58.740
<v 3>Uh,</v>

462
00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.690
<v 1>all right.
So I did some more sets in in New York,</v>

463
00:29:02.691 --> 00:29:05.240
had great sets Thursday night and then Friday and Saturday.

464
00:29:05.241 --> 00:29:10.100
I had like those sort of typical New York sets where,
you know,

465
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.030
I dunno,
it's just the,
I dunno what I don't,

466
00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:16.850
I don't get it.
I don't get it.

467
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:21.350
I was up there and make it fun to women and then this woman in the crowd,

468
00:29:21.351 --> 00:29:26.120
white woman of course just goes.
But yeah,
right.

469
00:29:26.121 --> 00:29:30.920
So I just started making fun of her and she just goes,
what?
I had to do it,

470
00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:31.813
you know,

471
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.930
like what she did was unbelievable and brave and all of that type of shit.

472
00:29:35.931 --> 00:29:37.130
And it's just like,
you know,

473
00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:41.320
I dunno if you just heard it.

474
00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:44.210
It's just like these fucking white women who were acting like they're oppressed.

475
00:29:44.211 --> 00:29:48.110
It's like you're white.
Okay.
That's my joke.
It's like you're in the,

476
00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:50.790
in the Jacuzzi with me.
Stop this,
stop it.

477
00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:54.090
This fucking whining all the fucking time.
Like,

478
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.890
like you're really this oppressed minority,

479
00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.690
you know,
is this,

480
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.650
you could tell how a press she was by the level of passion she had when she was

481
00:30:03.651 --> 00:30:07.070
yelling.
She's like,
Hey,
fuck.

482
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.870
You had to say like,
no passion,
no fire,

483
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:16.790
no pain,
whatever.
Oh.
And I don't only know and all it's doing,

484
00:30:16.791 --> 00:30:20.620
it's just causing me to say more ignorant shit that I wouldn't be saying if,
if,

485
00:30:20.621 --> 00:30:25.430
if they weren't fucking act in that way.
So,
um,
just heads.

486
00:30:25.431 --> 00:30:27.950
It's just a really weird,
I don't know,

487
00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:30.650
somebody actually wrote me a letter talking about the Caroline show,

488
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.580
which I mean I had a good time,
but by no means was it a smooth show.

489
00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:36.470
Said hey old Billy,

490
00:30:36.471 --> 00:30:39.500
thanks for coming out and putting on a great show at Caroline's.

491
00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.100
You were absolutely hilarious.
I listen to your podcast and after agree with you,

492
00:30:43.101 --> 00:30:45.290
the crowd wasn't typical New York.

493
00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.280
I'm born and raised New Yorker and noticed a ton of what I'm sure were hipster

494
00:30:49.281 --> 00:30:52.210
transplant.
I don't,
I think they're just younger people now.

495
00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.820
<v 0>Okay.</v>

496
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.210
<v 1>And I just think it's a product of being on social media and seeing everybody</v>

497
00:30:57.211 --> 00:30:59.130
getting in trouble.
Maybe that's what it is.

498
00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.690
Because one of the Times I was doing a show in this guy was like laughing,

499
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.640
but he wouldn't look at me and he was almost like looking down and then looking

500
00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.490
across it his friend like,
like he wanted to laugh,
but he was afraid too.

501
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.340
I don't know.
It's strange.
Then he goes,

502
00:31:14.341 --> 00:31:17.810
a couple of people even kept looking over at me for laughing so much.

503
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:21.690
Just want you to know that US natives and longtime New Yorker is really

504
00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.240
appreciated and thoroughly enjoyed your show.

505
00:31:24.241 --> 00:31:27.900
I hope you weren't too put off because I look forward to seeing you perform here

506
00:31:27.901 --> 00:31:31.560
again.
So,
oh yeah.
I mean I'm not going to fucking quit coming to New York.
I just,

507
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:36.360
I'm having a difficult time trying to figure out what exactly it is that I'm

508
00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:40.190
doing.
I feel like a three or comic when I go to New York.
Um,

509
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:41.790
<v 0>okay.</v>

510
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:46.200
<v 1>I Dunno,
but it is what it is,
you know,
it's dictated by the young,
not the old.</v>

511
00:31:46.201 --> 00:31:51.201
So they are setting the tone and I guess I have to figure out how to adjust to

512
00:31:51.211 --> 00:31:53.130
it.
Um,

513
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.660
<v 0>okay.</v>

514
00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.740
<v 1>Oh and I'll Robert Kraft,
Robert Kraft,</v>

515
00:31:58.741 --> 00:32:01.380
getting all this shit for,
I don't know what,
you know,

516
00:32:01.381 --> 00:32:06.381
the man simply was trying to buy a strip mall and he just went over there and he

517
00:32:06.721 --> 00:32:10.260
was checking out some of the stores.
What is the problem?

518
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.030
I think it's such fucking bullshit.
That's just because he's famous.

519
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.330
I was talking to this cop because anytime we busted a rub and tug,
he goes,

520
00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.000
you're trying to get the people that run it.
You don't get the Johns,

521
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.420
you just scare them and you let them go.
But all of a sudden he's a famous guy.

522
00:32:24.421 --> 00:32:28.020
So now it's just like this big deal,
you know?
And everybody's just like,

523
00:32:28.021 --> 00:32:32.640
why if you Robert Crap,
do you need to go to a rub and tug?

524
00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:37.670
And I would say that's because that's how annoying it is to have a woman in your

525
00:32:38.131 --> 00:32:38.964
life.

526
00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:46.630
You can just get what you want without all the fucking bitch moaning and

527
00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:51.390
complaining.
Um,
well I don't know why he wouldn't.

528
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.950
If he did.
I mean,
it's all fucking alleged anyways.
You know,

529
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.870
it did happen to Florida.
So,
I mean,

530
00:32:56.871 --> 00:32:58.850
we've been beaten up and the dolphins for so long.

531
00:32:58.851 --> 00:33:02.420
I'm sure that's why they didn't fucking let them go.
But,
uh,

532
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:05.470
it's great that it happened because it gives people,
you know,

533
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.080
who hate Boston because they want all these fucking championships.

534
00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.700
MMM.
My favorite thing is when you talk about all the,

535
00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.670
the championships that they've won,
and like,

536
00:33:15.671 --> 00:33:18.700
people bring up like the eagles and the giants and it's just like,
dude,

537
00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:21.820
they were six and three.
I mean,
you're not gonna win all of them.

538
00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:26.380
I will take those three losses all day long to win six Superbowls.

539
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:31.080
MMM.
All fucking day long.
All Day long.

540
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:35.000
I'll take the 86 year fucking curse of the bay.

541
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.133
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

542
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.030
<v 1>To come back down three games to none</v>

543
00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:43.150
and to what they've been doing.
I mean,
it's like,
it's,
yeah,

544
00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.430
it's the pain that makes it great.
Um,
so anyways,

545
00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:50.910
any way to say it properly,

546
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.740
let me read a few more of these as podcast might be a little bit short because

547
00:33:55.741 --> 00:34:00.270
I'm beyond jetlagged and uh,
thank God I don't have a show tonight,

548
00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:03.660
but now I'm like wide awake because I came here and uh,

549
00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:07.560
I couldn't sleep on the plane.
I watched two movies that I really enjoyed.

550
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.320
I watched white boy Rick,
I got to give a shout out to that.
I mean,

551
00:34:13.321 --> 00:34:16.320
Matthew mcconaughey is always great.
He's always great,

552
00:34:16.321 --> 00:34:18.330
but the two people that played as kids,

553
00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:23.460
a white boy,
Rick movie,

554
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:28.500
let's see here.
I just thought the acting was superb in that movie.

555
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.410
Really,
really good movie.
And then I also saw,
uh,

556
00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:38.720
I might be able to figure it out.
There's,
I EMTB
um,

557
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:41.930
I also saw,
uh,
the,
the Freddie Mercury movie

558
00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.610
Bohemian rhapsody.
All right,

559
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:52.340
Richie Merit fucking killed it.
And then Bel Powley,

560
00:34:52.341 --> 00:34:55.280
both of them will fucking amazing.

561
00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:00.650
A really good movie.
And I'm like,
well,
these are also airplane reviews.

562
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.060
But I still think it was,
you know,
whenever you're in an air,

563
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:06.540
Judah Friedlander used to always say that when you run a movie,

564
00:35:06.541 --> 00:35:09.620
every fucking movie is good.
MMM.

565
00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:13.890
But these are actually really good movies.
And then I also saw a,
yeah,

566
00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.940
that Bohemian rhapsody,
Bohemian rhapsody.
And he always,

567
00:35:17.941 --> 00:35:21.810
the funniest part of that movie for me when I saw the original reviews of

568
00:35:21.811 --> 00:35:24.960
Bohemian rhapsody,
it's how I feel about that song today.

569
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:33.200
I don't know if it's just overplayed,
but that song drives me up the wall.

570
00:35:33.201 --> 00:35:38.120
I see a little Sillier,
wetter,
whoever,
man,
no,
no,
no.

571
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:42.340
They have no,
my mommy got my mum.
It's just like,
oh my God,
I get it.

572
00:35:42.341 --> 00:35:46.780
You could sing Jesus Christ about a fucking through line of a thought here.

573
00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.030
Um,
but I,
I really liked,
uh,
I liked that movie,
but,
um,

574
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.590
and I was,
I was in the air and missed all the,
uh,

575
00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:59.700
all the Oscar stuff.
But,
you know,

576
00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.790
I thought it was hilarious that spike Lee was upset.

577
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:08.590
It's just funny to meet when adults get mad that they don't win a fucking
trophy.

578
00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:13.000
You know?
It's just like,
why?
Why do you give a shit?

579
00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.890
Didn't you see how,
how they treated Martin Scorsese?
Yeah.

580
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:19.330
How long did he have to wait before he fucking,

581
00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:24.340
before he did fucking,
if,
when he finally got best director,

582
00:36:24.341 --> 00:36:27.790
when they finally gave it for him,
there wasn't,
it wasn't even his best one.

583
00:36:27.791 --> 00:36:29.620
It should have been for the other ones.
It's like,

584
00:36:29.621 --> 00:36:32.260
that's what's going to happen to you.
You know,

585
00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.510
they fucked Denzel on hurricane and then give him for the,

586
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:40.010
for that fucking King Kong.
Hey God,
not that on me.
They were always like a movie.

587
00:36:40.011 --> 00:36:44.740
You're too late.
You know.
I don't,
I dunno why.
I Dunno.
Why,

588
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:49.600
why would you waste your time getting that fucking,
I dunno.

589
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:53.650
Upset.
I did like that he was dressed like prince,
his grandfather though.

590
00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:02.470
Um,
anyways,
anyway,
uh,
I,

591
00:37:02.471 --> 00:37:07.000
and most of those other movies I didn't see,
uh,
I,
I didn't see,

592
00:37:07.001 --> 00:37:10.210
so I dunno.
What,
what,
what are you going to do?

593
00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.550
All right,
the next thing I got here,

594
00:37:13.551 --> 00:37:16.940
somebody of course giving me shit for a sane.

595
00:37:16.941 --> 00:37:20.840
I felt bad for Jessie Smollett.
I just felt bad as far as like,
oh my God,

596
00:37:20.841 --> 00:37:24.500
he's got to feel like the biggest fucking asshole ever in this guy.

597
00:37:24.501 --> 00:37:28.880
Of course gets all passionate about it because why would you get passionate

598
00:37:28.881 --> 00:37:32.750
about the corporations that dictate our foreign policy and have literally

599
00:37:32.751 --> 00:37:37.751
bankrupted this country when you can get mad at an actor that got 100% busted

600
00:37:39.411 --> 00:37:43.340
for what he did and nobody got hurt other than him,

601
00:37:43.341 --> 00:37:48.320
he totally destroyed his grades.
They can feel safe.
Bet You hope.
Who's kid?

602
00:37:48.321 --> 00:37:49.310
We rebounds.

603
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:54.470
The guy who was willing to let two innocent people right in jail.

604
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:59.000
I don't think he thought they were going to get caught considering he was acting

605
00:37:59.001 --> 00:38:00.200
like it was two white people.

606
00:38:00.201 --> 00:38:03.050
I think what it was supposed to happen was they were supposed to sort of semi

607
00:38:03.051 --> 00:38:06.210
beat him up.
He was supposed to blame it on fucking raw,
uh,

608
00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.750
white people and like the two guys that did,
is that what you're saying?

609
00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.490
The Guy was trying to cause even more racial division and anger in this country.

610
00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.180
Uh,
he didn't increase it or decrease it.

611
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:20.510
It wouldn't have it just what has just been another fucking story that lasted

612
00:38:20.511 --> 00:38:21.350
for three days.

613
00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:26.830
It is where it is and will remain that way and took people grow the fuck up.

614
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.161
Uh,
the Guy Oh,

615
00:38:28.161 --> 00:38:32.960
terrorized his coworkers by sending fake hate mail with mysterious white power

616
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:37.800
powder in it to his place.
Work,
Paul.
Yeah.
Head out of your ass.

617
00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:41.660
Bird.
All right.
Maybe I was wrong about that.

618
00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.930
I thought it'd be more of a unique take other than to say,

619
00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:49.700
you just said what everybody else said.
Congratulations sir.
You,
no,

620
00:38:49.701 --> 00:38:53.180
I still feel sorry for is you who does not have an original [inaudible].

621
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:57.210
I think what everybody else thinks,
oh,
that's entertaining.
I mean,

622
00:38:57.211 --> 00:39:00.830
if I just did that,
I could just be that big headed fucking lady.

623
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:04.250
Who's that lady who does that show when she turns her head to the side?

624
00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.010
Like Jim Rome,
you know,

625
00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:12.110
she gets all mad about cases about people who you've been just horrific things

626
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:16.010
have happened to them.
But if horrific things didn't happen to them,

627
00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.840
then she wouldn't have a mansion.

628
00:39:17.841 --> 00:39:21.920
So the whole shows kind of a weird thing to watch.
Um,
yeah,

629
00:39:21.921 --> 00:39:23.000
might as well be her.

630
00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:30.520
She looks like the cousin of that woman who had the slave themed wedding,

631
00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:35.960
who used to do the cooking show and on the fucking food network whenever fucking

632
00:39:35.961 --> 00:39:40.330
name is.
Um,
Jesus,
you guys think I'm in a bad move?

633
00:39:40.331 --> 00:39:43.940
Watch that person show always with a scowl on their face.

634
00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.920
She looks like that fucking monster.
And uh,
the fuck is it?

635
00:39:48.921 --> 00:39:51.050
The uh,
bugs bunny,
you know,

636
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:56.390
monsters have such interesting life.
So whatever used to say,
uh,

637
00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.860
when bugs bunny was doing the things here,
that no armed fucking monster,
right?

638
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:05.720
Um,
anyways,
sorry.
This is all jetlag fucking horse shit.

639
00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.093
Uh,

640
00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:09.200
<v 0>okay.</v>

641
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.570
<v 1>The fuck am I talking about here?
Yeah.
I,</v>

642
00:40:11.571 --> 00:40:15.740
anytime I see somebody just completely fuck their life up on some level human

643
00:40:15.741 --> 00:40:20.510
being,
the human being,
I just,
I just feel bad.
Like,
Oh God,
what did you do?

644
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:22.190
You know,

645
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.950
I don't condone it and think they should and I definitely think they should be

646
00:40:24.951 --> 00:40:26.580
punished.
I don't know why.

647
00:40:26.581 --> 00:40:31.330
I always look at that like go get that fucking Bernie Madoff guy.

648
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:33.870
I just can't imagine.
Just say,

649
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:36.930
I guess I'm looking at it like the person actually has empathy for other people.

650
00:40:36.931 --> 00:40:37.740
Maybe they don't.

651
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:41.880
I'm putting myself into that situation where I would be going like,
ah God,

652
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.750
every day everybody's smiling.
You're the greatest bill.

653
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:48.990
Thanks for making me all this money and I've got to be like,
thank you.

654
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.590
Not to say that I haven't been a piece of shit in my life.

655
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:57.180
Well maybe that's what it is because I'd been a piece of shit,
so I don't know.

656
00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:02.260
Excuse me for fucking feeling bad for an actor who made it and then fuck the

657
00:41:02.281 --> 00:41:03.240
whole thing up.

658
00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:08.570
That has got to be the most bizarre way ever to try and get a raise,

659
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.790
but I still don't think that that's why he was doing it.

660
00:41:10.791 --> 00:41:14.780
I think he had like some sort of victim fantasy or something like that.

661
00:41:14.781 --> 00:41:15.650
I think it was more that,

662
00:41:15.651 --> 00:41:18.940
I don't think that that's how you get a raise and if the,

663
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.530
and I'll see if he really thinks that that's the way it was.

664
00:41:21.531 --> 00:41:23.570
The was a way to get a raise.

665
00:41:23.571 --> 00:41:25.850
Like there was the whole fucking thing was so crazy.

666
00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:29.390
I feel like there's something about him that he's not all there and now he just

667
00:41:29.391 --> 00:41:33.460
make it fun as somebody that has some sort of mental issue.
I Dunno.

668
00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:37.210
Or He's like the world's dumbest criminal.
Maybe that's what it is.
I don't know.

669
00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:41.420
But you know what sir,
I will try to pull my head out of my ass and,
and,

670
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.580
and have your thoughts,

671
00:41:42.581 --> 00:41:46.270
which is what everybody else thinks and that'll be an entertaining podcast.

672
00:41:46.271 --> 00:41:50.280
Welcome to what everybody else thinks.
I'm your host Bill Burr,

673
00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.680
uh,
the new green deal.
Sir,

674
00:41:53.681 --> 00:41:57.220
did you get this mad that the first mammal went extinct due to,
well,

675
00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:00.670
human induced global warming.
Did you have that level of passion for it?

676
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:03.190
<v 0>Okay.</v>

677
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:07.340
<v 1>All right.
The new green deal.
Yo,
Billy planet poss</v>

678
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:13.790
I'm into saving the environment and I've been abstaining from plastic bags and

679
00:42:13.791 --> 00:42:17.720
straws and buying the new iPhone every year for most of my life.

680
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:21.440
But I'm starting to question the narrative of certain things.

681
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:27.080
Okay.
Uh,
you talked about AOC.
I don't know what that is.

682
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:32.090
The young Congress woman with big ambitions wasn't sure if you heard this,

683
00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:35.240
but in the New York green deal,
she's posting,

684
00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:40.780
there was a line item supporting those who are not able to work and those who

685
00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:45.650
are not willing,
uh,

686
00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:47.960
granted this isn't likely to happen.

687
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.820
I think it's insane to suggest that someone should get a check for sitting

688
00:42:52.821 --> 00:42:54.860
around on their ass.
My question is,

689
00:42:55.130 --> 00:43:00.130
if the US government decided to do this in civil war was pending,

690
00:43:00.291 --> 00:43:03.410
would you leave the country or refuse to pay taxes?

691
00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:04.840
<v 0>Okay.</v>

692
00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.320
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
Dude,
that,
that you went fucking vertical on that last line.</v>

693
00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.480
I mean,
if the US government decided to do it,
what the fuck?

694
00:43:14.481 --> 00:43:18.510
What could I do about it?
I mean,
I,
I guess I would,

695
00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:23.760
I essentially worked for free.
MMM.

696
00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.540
I Dunno,
but it's,
what's killing me is,

697
00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:32.400
is we,

698
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:37.260
we have the money to not with all the money that we pay in taxes.

699
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.080
If we would get out of these fucking wars,

700
00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:41.720
<v 0>okay.</v>

701
00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:45.320
<v 1>Which are going nowhere and if just bankrupted us and made a very few amount of</v>

702
00:43:45.321 --> 00:43:47.860
people in this country,
super fucking rich,

703
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:54.830
you wouldn't have to then in and like this person is now coming along and going

704
00:43:54.831 --> 00:43:57.020
after people and she's not,

705
00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:00.530
she's not going to be able to get all of those super rich people do not have

706
00:44:00.531 --> 00:44:04.040
their money in this country.
I saw this fascinating thing,

707
00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:08.960
I talked about this before,
how they,
they,
they get it out of the country,

708
00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:10.720
you know their corporation,

709
00:44:10.721 --> 00:44:14.300
he set up a phony corporation and at one of these fucking islands and all the

710
00:44:14.301 --> 00:44:15.200
money goes there.

711
00:44:15.201 --> 00:44:18.200
And then there were an employee of that corporation and then they set up another

712
00:44:18.201 --> 00:44:20.660
corporation and a different Ireland,
different company.

713
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.670
And then that deck cooperation bills,

714
00:44:22.671 --> 00:44:26.060
the first one and then there's another one in another country and that one bills

715
00:44:26.061 --> 00:44:29.570
this one and they just keep moving all of the money throughout these islands.

716
00:44:29.571 --> 00:44:33.720
All these key is is it's different countries.
So with each country,

717
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:35.010
the IRS,

718
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:39.990
I guess the amount of red tape they have to go through and at each stop,

719
00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:44.520
the corporation,
air quote corporation pays off somebody locally.

720
00:44:44.521 --> 00:44:46.170
So it does cost them money to do that,

721
00:44:46.171 --> 00:44:49.620
but not nearly as much as what they would pay in the United States.

722
00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:51.960
And then when it gets to like the seventh or eighth buck in place,

723
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:53.880
that corporation

724
00:44:55.710 --> 00:45:00.330
then gives the person in the United States who doesn't want to pay taxes,

725
00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:03.910
gives them a alone yeah.

726
00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.520
Gives them the money back in the form of a loan,
which isn't taxable.

727
00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.430
And then they just never pay it back.
And the,

728
00:45:10.431 --> 00:45:13.280
and the corporation quote forgives the loan.

729
00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:18.890
So the taxes that that person paid was paying off people in each one of those

730
00:45:18.891 --> 00:45:22.250
countries before it came back.
MMM.

731
00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:26.960
Which is very sophisticated and I don't know.

732
00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:30.770
That's how they fuck it.
Do it now.
This woman is not going to get those people.

733
00:45:30.771 --> 00:45:33.310
What she's going to do is get,
like I said,

734
00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.810
standup comedians that are suddenly selling tickets.

735
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:39.200
She's got to get kids out of college that,
you know,

736
00:45:39.201 --> 00:45:42.350
created movement watches or,
or started an APP.

737
00:45:42.351 --> 00:45:47.351
She's going to basically be going after and taxing the shit out of what makes

738
00:45:47.931 --> 00:45:49.190
this country great.

739
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:54.130
The fact that you can come from nothing and you,
you can get to that,

740
00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:58.390
the absolute heights,
you know,
depending on how hard you work,

741
00:45:58.391 --> 00:46:03.070
your idea and your luck,
anyone can make it.
Um,

742
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:06.730
she's going to be going after that and completely ignoring

743
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.270
these corporations that have bankrupted this fucking country.

744
00:46:12.271 --> 00:46:15.120
Polluted the fucking drinking water.
Turned up our,
our,

745
00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:18.510
our food supply into poison have made money,

746
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:21.920
millions and billions of dollars in pharmaceutical,
uh,

747
00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.650
the pharmaceutical industry and,
and,

748
00:46:23.651 --> 00:46:26.760
and with all these people overdosing and all these families that are ripped

749
00:46:26.761 --> 00:46:29.310
apart,
then Jenny,
she's not gonna go after any of those fucking people.

750
00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:34.500
She's just going to get someone like me who's just a fucking individual.

751
00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:39.780
That's it.
You saw what happened when Trump tried to tip,

752
00:46:39.781 --> 00:46:41.740
pull the troops out of Syria.

753
00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:46.470
You saw how both fucking Democrats and Republicans were like,
whoa.
They were,

754
00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:51.280
that's where their bread is buttered.
By keeping those corporations,

755
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:55.300
making all that money on that fucking war,
on those fucking wars.

756
00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:56.800
And then when they're done,

757
00:46:56.950 --> 00:47:00.340
they then get to go around and give speeches and that's how they wash their

758
00:47:00.341 --> 00:47:03.850
fucking bribe money.
And you watched this woman for all these big ideas she has.

759
00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:08.170
She's going to come out the other side.
She's going to be a multi,
multi,
multi,

760
00:47:08.171 --> 00:47:11.260
multi fucking millionaire.
She's going to have a fucking book deal.

761
00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:12.970
She's going to be on TV,

762
00:47:12.971 --> 00:47:16.360
she's going to go on the talk show circuit and everybody's going to just sit

763
00:47:16.361 --> 00:47:20.740
there and talk about what a fucking inspiration she is.
And um,

764
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:26.370
you know,
it's just,
it's all bullshit.
And then meanwhile,
you know,

765
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.530
anybody who fucking,

766
00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.680
when I had the balls to go after a dream and sleep on a futon until they were

767
00:47:32.681 --> 00:47:36.940
like 38 and started making some money is going to be paying 70% taxes.

768
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:40.980
I guess that that's,
that's the solution to it.
I don't know.
I,
I,

769
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:44.510
it doesn't seem like,
you know,

770
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:48.370
I know a lot of fucking people that if you just gave him a check every month

771
00:47:48.371 --> 00:47:52.390
would just sit on their fucking ass and play video games.
Um,

772
00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:55.510
just because this changing technology,
you have to fucking join it.

773
00:47:55.511 --> 00:47:59.860
Learn how to fucking fix a robot's ACL or some shit.
You know what I mean?

774
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:03.520
It's like,
I'm sure there's a bunch of mechanics out there right now.

775
00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.340
If you're smart,
you're starting to learn how to fix a,

776
00:48:06.341 --> 00:48:09.820
an electric vehicle rather than sticking with gas combustion engines.

777
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:11.950
Kind of trying to keep yourself ahead of the fucking game.

778
00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:14.230
That's what you have to do.
You got to fucking adjust.
Right.

779
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.320
I don't think the solution is to turn around,
you know,
I,

780
00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.820
if I was running shit to,

781
00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:24.860
to take more than 50% income tax off of anybody,

782
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.830
regardless of whether how much money they're making should be fucking criminal.

783
00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:34.070
There's no way the person who did the job should make less money then the person

784
00:48:34.491 --> 00:48:38.870
taxing you.
Um,
I dunno.
That's just my,

785
00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.350
my fucking opinion.
What the hell do I know?
I mentioned somewhat.
Tell me,

786
00:48:42.351 --> 00:48:46.130
I needed to take my head out of my ass.
But I would imagine if we,
you know,

787
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:50.960
converted to fucking solar power and an electric cars and all of that,

788
00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:52.490
we would take a massive,

789
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:57.790
massive bite out of the Middle East and all of those people that fund these

790
00:48:57.981 --> 00:48:59.750
fucking terrorist groups and,

791
00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:00.840
<v 0>okay.</v>

792
00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.400
<v 1>Two things.
They wouldn't have the money</v>

793
00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.200
<v 0>okay.</v>

794
00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:08.300
<v 1>To be any sort of a threat to us.
We wouldn't be fucking over there.</v>

795
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:11.270
And eventually they would just go back to fighting each other the same way they

796
00:49:11.271 --> 00:49:13.610
fucking did in eastern Europe.
When Russia pulled out,

797
00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:17.080
they went right back to picking up their fights.
They were like,
where,

798
00:49:17.081 --> 00:49:20.270
where are we?
And he went right back to fucking killing each other.

799
00:49:20.271 --> 00:49:24.910
So I don't know.
I know I'm over simplifying all of this shit,
but,
um,

800
00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.040
I would think because we're their biggest customer,

801
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:29.960
that if we pulled out of there,

802
00:49:29.961 --> 00:49:34.961
that would massively hurt any sort of terrorist groups ability.

803
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:36.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

804
00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.160
<v 1>To try and go after us,
you know,</v>

805
00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:42.450
I don't know the fuck do I know why do you guys ask me such deep questions?

806
00:49:42.451 --> 00:49:46.860
You know,
I don't fucking read the paper.
Right.
Longtime Ozzy lady listener,

807
00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:51.240
a good day bell,
longtime listener here from Melbourne,

808
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:55.170
Australia.
Who would love to hear your take on my situation?
All right,

809
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.500
well did you realize you have to listen to my bad Aussie Aussie accent there.

810
00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:02.400
I'm in the second half of my twenties out here.
We call that your late twenties.

811
00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:05.370
I work in a TV job.
I love,
I'm independent,

812
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:09.690
have great friends and enough hobbies slash personal interest to keep me busy

813
00:50:09.691 --> 00:50:14.250
and entertained in everyday life.
I've been told I'm a catch.

814
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:15.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

815
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:19.390
<v 1>But it ain't all rainbows and sunshine.
Uh,
not only am I single,</v>

816
00:50:19.391 --> 00:50:21.340
but by my cynicism,

817
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:26.410
by my citizen has become so powerful that it's compromising my ability to date

818
00:50:26.411 --> 00:50:28.970
or trust,
I think you want to say,
but my wife cynicism,

819
00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:30.860
a bit of a background here.

820
00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:35.390
Years Ago I was in a longterm relationship with ended in heartache for me and

821
00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:39.320
since then I've been through a sequence of disappointing dating experiences,

822
00:50:39.321 --> 00:50:44.270
which has left me more lonely and unlovable each time people have named me.

823
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:47.000
Good luck,
chuck,
because whenever I get involved with anybody,

824
00:50:47.001 --> 00:50:49.400
they settled down with the next person.
They come across.

825
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:51.770
I fear him becoming an angry person.

826
00:50:51.771 --> 00:50:56.630
Men seem to think I'm more of a good time then along that a long time or a good

827
00:50:56.631 --> 00:50:58.220
answer for boredom.
Uh,

828
00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:02.600
I also need seem to attract men in relationships or worst married.

829
00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:04.470
<v 3>MMM.</v>

830
00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:07.710
<v 1>But how can I become less of a cynic?</v>

831
00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:11.580
The reality is that some people just don't end up finding someone.
Well,

832
00:51:11.581 --> 00:51:13.950
not with that attitude.
Uh,

833
00:51:13.951 --> 00:51:18.210
they go through life falling in love alone or not at all.

834
00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:22.650
My mother has,
has been single for 10 years and doesn't intend on changing that.

835
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.350
Uh,
do you think some people are meant to be alone?

836
00:51:25.351 --> 00:51:28.710
Was there ever a point in your life where you thought you'd end up alone,

837
00:51:28.711 --> 00:51:30.720
cheers and go fuck yourself?
Absolutely.
I did.

838
00:51:30.721 --> 00:51:32.580
And I went through the same shit that you're going through.

839
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.280
<v 3>Okay.</v>

840
00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.600
<v 1>Yeah.
And I had,
you know,</v>

841
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:39.080
women I dated and then I fucked it up and then they'd go on the next guy.

842
00:51:39.081 --> 00:51:41.600
They'd marry him.
Yeah.
I had that happen a couple of times.

843
00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:43.283
<v 3>MMM.</v>

844
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:47.360
<v 1>And then I dated,
you know,
thought went through a while.</v>

845
00:51:47.361 --> 00:51:49.190
I thought women were psychos.

846
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.760
And then I just realized that what I was doing was I kept going up to roughly

847
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:57.230
the same kind of person.
I kept fishing in the same poisoned pond,
if you will.

848
00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:02.710
I think you just need to get a little therapy and become a little more positive.

849
00:52:03.021 --> 00:52:06.440
And obviously if somebody is married and in a relationship you shouldn't.

850
00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:07.860
<v 3>Okay.</v>

851
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.260
<v 1>You know,
I think that should be one of your first fucking questions.</v>

852
00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.560
<v 3>MMM.</v>

853
00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:17.520
<v 1>And there has to be something that you're doing.
And I'm saying this as,
as,
uh,</v>

854
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:22.470
as a way as a positive thing that if that's what you're attracting,

855
00:52:22.471 --> 00:52:25.650
there has to be something that you're doing that that can only happen so many

856
00:52:25.651 --> 00:52:28.140
times before you got to be figuring out what the fuck am I doing?

857
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:32.570
That's what I did was psycho women while I was just so like,
you know,

858
00:52:32.571 --> 00:52:34.890
you look at chicks who psychos and then after a while,

859
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.800
once you date like the third,
fourth,
fifth one in a row,
you like,
alright,

860
00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:40.110
what am I doing?
Oh,

861
00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:43.230
I'm deliberately going after these people cause I'm afraid to commit.

862
00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.910
And then when they break up with me,

863
00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:47.550
there's no fucking heartache because they're out of their fucking mind.

864
00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:50.470
<v 3>Um,
so</v>

865
00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:55.370
<v 1>I think some people were meant to be alone,
but it doesn't sound like you are.</v>

866
00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:59.960
If you are meant to be alone,
you would be way more okay with it than you are.

867
00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:03.260
And this doesn't just seem like you're looking at the herd and it's making you

868
00:53:03.261 --> 00:53:06.320
question yourself.
You sound like you want to find love.

869
00:53:06.321 --> 00:53:10.550
So what I would do is take some of your TV money and I would get a good

870
00:53:10.551 --> 00:53:15.551
therapist and I would do some work on yourself and uh,

871
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:20.570
start fishing in a different pond.
How about that?

872
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.390
Did I oversimplify what was going on?
I probably did.

873
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.130
<v 3>MMM.</v>

874
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.400
<v 1>Anyways.
Anyway,</v>

875
00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:35.460
I'm just gonna keep saying anyways,
I think that's one of my charms that I don't,

876
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:40.350
I don't have command with my own language.
Um,
all right.
That is the,

877
00:53:40.351 --> 00:53:43.140
uh,
that is the podcast.
Geez,
we got fucking deep on this one,
Huh?

878
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:45.230
<v 0>Okay.</v>

879
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:46.910
<v 1>Passing of Steven Brody Stevens.</v>

880
00:53:46.911 --> 00:53:51.470
My hottest solves the fucking Middle East problem,
the audacity to be doing that.

881
00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:56.630
And uh,
I don't know what else.
Look at it.
As Keith Robinson just texted me,

882
00:53:56.631 --> 00:53:57.620
he's like,
ha ha.

883
00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:02.480
Looks like Robert Kraft won't be going to the White House this year.
Oh yeah,

884
00:54:02.481 --> 00:54:05.000
I guess so.
Go cry with his six fucking trophies.

885
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:06.550
<v 0>Okay.</v>

886
00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:09.790
<v 1>Not to mention,
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't know.</v>

887
00:54:09.791 --> 00:54:12.160
I've never had this experience before that my teams,

888
00:54:12.161 --> 00:54:15.160
the team that wins everything.
It was,
it always this fucking petty.

889
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.920
That's all they do is just come up with petty shit.
Huh?

890
00:54:18.921 --> 00:54:23.530
I guess he won't be fucking dud.
That's like,

891
00:54:23.531 --> 00:54:25.410
okay.
Yeah,

892
00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:30.411
I guess we'll just have to fucking cry on Mark Trophies and move on.

893
00:54:30.491 --> 00:54:35.080
It'd be they're not taking the team away.
Who gives a shit?
And I don't like that.

894
00:54:35.081 --> 00:54:38.320
It's fucking,
it's Donald Trump.

895
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:40.181
He was probably,

896
00:54:40.181 --> 00:54:43.540
he was probably the driver and the getaway car from the rub and tug.

897
00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:49.990
Did you grab them by the pussies?
Um,
anyways.
All right.
Anyway,

898
00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:53.080
that is the,
uh,
that is the podcast.
Uh,

899
00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:58.090
congratulations to everybody out there.
That one,
the shiny things,

900
00:54:58.091 --> 00:55:02.260
my condolences for those who didn't.
Um,

901
00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:06.810
I hope people who watch movies and were offended by them could somehow move past

902
00:55:06.811 --> 00:55:11.380
it and find a reason to get up in the morning tomorrow.

903
00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:13.743
<v 0>MMM.</v>

904
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.200
<v 1>People would sort of,
it's a fucking award show.</v>

905
00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:19.190
<v 0>I mean,
there</v>

906
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:25.240
<v 1>don't,
don't they fuck it up in your business to top sales men.</v>

907
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:27.670
And everybody's sitting is fucking God Brown.

908
00:55:27.671 --> 00:55:30.910
Noser he's banging the fucking boss.
His daughter was getting married to her.

909
00:55:30.911 --> 00:55:33.340
That's why he fucking wanting,
you know,
isn't there always that shit?

910
00:55:33.341 --> 00:55:38.260
There's always gonna be that shit.
You know,
quit your fucking crying.

911
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.360
It's not what's,
what a fucking great country.
This is,

912
00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:46.053
<v 0>you know,</v>

913
00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.900
<v 1>it's such a great country.
People complain about the movies.</v>

914
00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:55.180
I didn't like the way it made people with red shirts.
Look,

915
00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:56.430
Ooh.

916
00:55:57.790 --> 00:55:58.623
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

917
00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:03.050
<v 1>He wanted his fucking polar bears.
Fucking drowning.
Um,</v>

918
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:06.000
add another flat screen to you.
Fucking TV.

919
00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:10.420
See Your fucking TV room c can fucking watch the Oscars and cry about it.
Um,

920
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:15.180
all right,
I'm off my fucking soapbox.
Uh,
here we go.
I'm in the bubble.

921
00:56:15.181 --> 00:56:18.690
Everybody.
I am in the bubble of this time.
Next week was going to be Monday.

922
00:56:18.691 --> 00:56:21.690
I'm gonna be doing my first taping and then the next day I'll do my next taping

923
00:56:21.691 --> 00:56:26.310
and then now we will be putting this hour and 30 minutes to fucking bed.

924
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:29.070
Uh,
I can't wait.
I'm very excited.

925
00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:33.940
I miss my daughter and wife terribly and I'm,

926
00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:38.580
I'm really gonna take it easy this year.
I really am.
I'm talking to my agent.

927
00:56:38.581 --> 00:56:41.940
I'm going to be the California kid.
I'm doing gigs out in fucking Cali.

928
00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:45.200
I'm just gonna stay in the southwest.
I'm going to fluff.

929
00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:48.360
I can't fly southwest of the Gig in under 50 minutes.

930
00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.240
I'm not fucking doing it and I'm just going to fucking chill.

931
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:56.790
I got an acting Gig this summer.
Then I'll bring in my wife and kid along too.

932
00:56:56.850 --> 00:57:01.830
And uh,
I'm just going to slip some life and let this thing come together.

933
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:03.330
Uh,
oh my God,

934
00:57:03.331 --> 00:57:08.331
my wife sent me this video of my kids singing the abcs and I do this thing.

935
00:57:08.941 --> 00:57:11.850
I don't know if I,
I probably already told you the shit.
So fucking jet lag.

936
00:57:11.851 --> 00:57:16.740
But I do this thing the way I sing,
the abcs,
I go a,
B,
c,
d e F,
g,

937
00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:20.160
H,
I,
J,
k l m n o,
p Gig.
You know,
bouncing up and down.

938
00:57:20.161 --> 00:57:22.170
She just laughs and all that stuff.

939
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:25.680
So now she can do the abcs and she throws the haze in there.

940
00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.860
She's like [inaudible],

941
00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:34.200
Hey t u v,

942
00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:35.753
hey,

943
00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:40.920
it's the cutest fucking thing over.

944
00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:43.050
And it's all that matters in life.

945
00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:48.660
And then you fucking put on the TV and you watch delts fucking whining because

946
00:57:48.661 --> 00:57:51.090
they didn't get the star on their forehead.
Who gives a fuck?

947
00:57:51.091 --> 00:57:56.070
You're making movies,
you're a millionaire,
you're bang and beautiful women.

948
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.400
You know,
what the fuck else do you need?

949
00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:02.160
I wanted the shiny thing.

950
00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.820
I like the flag.
We Academy

951
00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:12.440
fucking half the people in the world trying to just get a fucking sandwich.

952
00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:15.890
Boohoo I didn't get a trophy.
I will never get,

953
00:58:15.891 --> 00:58:18.530
I will never fucking understand that.
But then again,

954
00:58:18.531 --> 00:58:22.610
I do watch sports and I get excited that my team wins trophies and I'm about

955
00:58:22.611 --> 00:58:25.430
ready to fucking trash.
Keith Robinson and his,

956
00:58:25.431 --> 00:58:29.990
sorry ass fucking cowboys who the Patriots just passed for more super bowl

957
00:58:29.991 --> 00:58:34.720
titles.
Um,
we've one more super bowl titles.
What am I going to say?
Damn.

958
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:38.750
We one more super bowl titles and the last two decades than the cowboys have one

959
00:58:38.751 --> 00:58:40.220
in their entire fucking history.

960
00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:44.960
Tom Brady has more rings than all the Dallas Cowboy quarterbacks combined.

961
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:48.770
Oh,
I'll do,
I have some ammo and I have to take advantage of it now.

962
00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:52.760
Cause I know when Tom Leaves and bill Belicheck retires,
you know,

963
00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:57.590
I have faith in like the fucking,
but I also have wait Robert Craft,

964
00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:02.750
right?
Simply trying to buy a strip mall and checking up the stores.

965
00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:08.000
That fucking guy,
arguably the greatest owner of all time.

966
00:59:08.001 --> 00:59:10.790
When you look at his coaching hires,
he's hired three coaches.

967
00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:15.350
Bill Parcells a fucking,
what's his name there?

968
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:17.550
<v 2>Woo.</v>

969
00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:21.470
<v 1>It just totally forgot his fucking name.
Pete Carroll.</v>

970
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:26.600
Bill Belicheck three for fucking three hall of famers.

971
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:29.360
That's two Superbowl,
three Superbowl,

972
00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:33.410
nine super bowls amongst all of them.
Amazing.

973
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:37.460
All right,
that's it.
That's the podcast.
Go fuck yourselves.

974
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:42.500
And I will talk to you.
Uh,
I'll check in on you in a couple of days.

975
00:59:42.501 --> 00:59:46.490
I don't know where I'm going to be,
but I got Liverpool the next couple of,
uh,

976
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:51.680
the next couple of nights and,
uh,
very excited to be here.
I've never been here,

977
00:59:51.681 --> 00:59:54.020
and as much as I was making fun of all that Beetle Shit,

978
00:59:54.021 --> 00:59:58.160
I'm definitely gonna go look at it.
You know,
I got it.

979
00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.830
I'm not going to go to the pub where they fucking start is,
of course,

980
01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:04.040
I'm going to go right now,
I'm going to,
you know,
and know like,

981
01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:07.580
I don't think I'm going to go to all their fucking houses.
Rural is his way.

982
01:00:07.581 --> 01:00:11.360
Ringo was sleeping.
Was it?
How the fuck do I know that?
All right,
I'll see you.
