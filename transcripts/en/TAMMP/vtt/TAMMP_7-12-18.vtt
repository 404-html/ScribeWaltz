1
00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.000
Yeah.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.030
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill bird is time for the Thursday afternoon,</v>

3
00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:07.220
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.150
<v 2>Ah,</v>

5
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.350
<v 0>just checking in.
Are you?</v>

6
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.740
<v 1>What's going on?
How are Ya this?
Some happy people out there.</v>

7
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:21.330
There's some sad people out.
There was a wonderful couple of days of soccer.

8
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:22.650
Here are all the World Cup

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.730
<v 0>France.
Oh,
Hall Beats Belgium</v>

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.730
<v 1>and England falls to Croatia.
It's calming,</v>

11
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.530
omits calming.
Oh my file.
He looked it up to see like,
why did they keep saying

12
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.040
<v 0>that it's coming home?
You know,</v>

13
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.940
<v 1>I immediately assumed like,
well,</v>

14
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:48.941
obviously England must've won the most championships and this is their arrogant

15
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:53.090
fucking way of being like,
yeah,
this is where it rightfully belongs.

16
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.130
Kind of like when the Yankees win a world series and then all those fucking

17
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:03.131
talking heads on on Espn logo and everything is all is right in baseball again.

18
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.860
It's why.
Why?

19
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:11.861
Because a $200 million team won a fucking playoff series play off.

20
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.810
<v 0>Turns out that's not what it is.
Evidently the game of soccer.</v>

21
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.920
Now this might our football footie,
whatever the fuck you call it,

22
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.880
evidently it was according to the English,

23
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.760
it was created in England.

24
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.780
They were the ones who decided despite the fact that you have four limbs,

25
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:39.570
you can only use two.
They wanted a degree of difficulty.

26
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:41.520
They weren't like the animals over here.

27
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.320
You know where we get bored and I'm like,
pick it up,
you know,

28
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.490
tackle them,
which meant jump on his back and throw him to the fucking ground.

29
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:52.440
That now a tackle over there.
As you trip,

30
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.400
somebody stick your foot out and you trip up.

31
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.770
So evidently it started over there.
That's what they're saying.

32
00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:00.960
So that's what it meant because I thought it meant that they had the most

33
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:04.740
championships.
And then I looked up a all time World Cup champions.

34
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.220
All right,
what you got to do?
How the fuck do you not to do?

35
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:10.830
I don't give a fuck what the sport is.
I to know who dominated it.

36
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.820
Turns out Brazil since 1930 they won the most.

37
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:19.821
They've won five 58 60 to 794 and 2002 which is a fucking lot considering it's

38
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:26.730
every four years.
How many there've been one,
two,
three,

39
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:31.260
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,
91011121314 1520.

40
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.750
This is the 21st one.

41
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.760
They've won 21 like whatever they fucking was that 20% of 25% of them then

42
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:40.580
Germany?
Yeah,
they,

43
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.650
they got for Italy has four [inaudible] they should have had five in 94.

44
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.850
I remember that one.
Uh,
Argentina hand to God,

45
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.400
that guy,
whatever his name was.
Uh,
the hell was that guy's name?

46
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.400
Diego or some shit.
What the fuck was his name?
I used to know his name.

47
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:02.480
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

48
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.571
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

49
00:03:02.571 --> 00:03:06.020
One of those fucking names where it's just like the second they gave him that

50
00:03:06.021 --> 00:03:10.370
his name,
it's just like pussy is going to be raining down on this guy.
Right.

51
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.920
Um,
I forget the hand of God guy.
That guy.
It was weird.

52
00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:18.650
He was like in shape and he also looked fat.
What the fuck was his name?

53
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.960
Diego.
Eric Gamo was something like that.
I can't fucking remember.
Then,
uh,

54
00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:29.250
I got my hope.
I say this right.
I always,
always Uruguay or go away.

55
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.710
Won it twice.
And then England,
France,
and Spain of all one at once.

56
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.430
That's interesting cause I thought Spain was a powerhouse and I would've thought

57
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.880
in England won a bunch way back in the day when it's probably just a bunch of

58
00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:45.990
white guys running around.
Right?
Yeah.
I also don't want,

59
00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:49.020
so that's why they say it's coming home.
It's not some arrogant shit.
It's like,

60
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:52.020
Hey,
you know,
this game that the whole world loves,
you know,

61
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.440
not to pat ourselves on the back,
but guess what?
We came up with it.

62
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.650
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.610
<v 0>It's our shit.
Okay.
Everything,
you know,
every,
you know,</v>

64
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.020
it's not just all about colonization,

65
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.010
the caste system and it's slaving people of other colors around the world.

66
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:11.950
It's not just about,
that's not all we did.

67
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.410
Okay.
Yay.
Hey,
hey,
you want to focus on the negative?
You could do that.
Okay.

68
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.500
But you can't deny that the beautiful game of football known as soccer over here

69
00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:25.724
in the states.

70
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.070
<v 3>Okay.</v>

71
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.510
<v 0>As we sit around eating hobbies.
Right.</v>

72
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.310
<v 3>Okay.</v>

73
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.240
<v 0>Was evidently created in England.</v>

74
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.880
I don't know when they did it.

75
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.650
You think for it to have a World Cup by 1934 to sweep the fucking nation.

76
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.030
Wait a minute.

77
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.590
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.360
<v 0>They also had an empire back then.
Oh,
I get it.
So they came up with this game.</v>

79
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.000
They'd come in,
they'd fucking take you over.

80
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.180
They'd fucking kill a bunch of people and everybody was like,
man,

81
00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:01.510
these guys are fucking assholes,
man.
Hi.
Settle down.

82
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:06.370
Settle down when to teach you a little game.
All right.

83
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.000
You can't use your arms slaughter.

84
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:11.360
You had your arms chopped off because you couldn't find any gold anyways,

85
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.300
so this is going to work real well for you.

86
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.180
All I can use as your feet and your fucking head

87
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.370
and the game spread like wildfire across the globe

88
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.830
as England expanded her empire.

89
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.510
I never understood why it was considered female.
Was that the tone it down?

90
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:37.090
That was a bunch of Luna guys going around the world going there.

91
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:39.460
This is a nice place to live.
Too Bad.
There's other people here.

92
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.250
What can we do about this?
Hi,

93
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.260
everybody does it right.
Everybody's done it since the beginning of time.

94
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.990
You go back,
you go back far enough in history books.

95
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.390
This is what all guilty white people do.
Everybody.
Yeah.

96
00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:55.810
You know Africans enslaved other African jewelry always say that shit,

97
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.280
try get past it.
You know it's like the Billy Joel Song.
We didn't start the fire,

98
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.310
which has got to be the most classic,

99
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.510
the most classic fucking baby boomer response.

100
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.220
I mean what a fucking baby.
He couldn't even take a little bit of responsibility.

101
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.380
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

102
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.650
<v 0>You know,
hey,
you know we,</v>

103
00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:20.410
we can start with you and he starts naming all his shit.

104
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.230
Half of it is like pop stars like Marilyn Monroe.

105
00:06:23.231 --> 00:06:25.450
What did she have to do with foreign policy?

106
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.750
I know she fucked a couple of Kennedy's but I mean other than that,

107
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.350
I don't think that dictated whether or not we went into Cuba.

108
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.470
Doris Day fucking [inaudible] to Bubba popup trouble.

109
00:06:40.471 --> 00:06:43.750
Linda sue as the fuck he do.

110
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.010
He must've been on blow when he wrote that song.
It's like,
Billy,

111
00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:51.030
are you going to take any responsibility for this self centered cons that the

112
00:06:51.031 --> 00:06:54.930
baby boom generation was?
I'm not saying everything you did was bad.
I mean,

113
00:06:54.931 --> 00:06:57.030
he invented the Frisbee,
right?
Was that you guys,

114
00:06:57.031 --> 00:06:58.590
who was that the greatest generation.

115
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.503
<v 3>Okay.</v>

116
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.960
<v 0>I don't know.
Somewhere in there there's gotta be truth,
right.</v>

117
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.020
From the greatest generation.

118
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.410
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

119
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.860
<v 0>You know,
that generation also didn't want to play baseball.
Jackie Robinson,</v>

120
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:14.860
by the way,
uh,
to the baby boomers who are,
you know,

121
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.580
widely considered the most selfish cunts,
you know,

122
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.900
this country has ever produced.
Right.
Just sitting around staring at the navel.

123
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.300
You know,
this is the dawning of the age,

124
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.860
right?
That's the same generation that gave us hippies.

125
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.000
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

126
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.680
<v 0>But surely Bergen stocks.</v>

127
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.800
<v 3>Okay.</v>

128
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.230
<v 0>You know,
fucking in the mud at a concert.</v>

129
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.520
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.360
<v 0>I used to have a theory way back in the day,
you know,</v>

131
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:48.530
when they talked about HIV and aids,
they always said that,
you know,
it was some,

132
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.751
somebody,
you know,

133
00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:54.580
it was already somewhat a monkey or some shit and some guy in France.
Got It.
Um,

134
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.990
I never thought it was then.
I used to have a theory that,
you know,

135
00:07:56.991 --> 00:08:00.350
if you watched the woodstocks tapes and you just see all those naked white

136
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:02.810
people rolling around fucking each other in the mud,
I mean,

137
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:07.070
he can't tell me that something didn't come out of that,
you know,

138
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.230
at least a stronger strain of the mumps.
Right.

139
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.810
So anyways,
to get back to it,
you know,
I was,
I was,
uh,
working,
uh,

140
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.830
as an actor.

141
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.920
I was act during the last couple of days and I was talking to this dude going

142
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:27.320
like,
yeah,
how come England keeps saying it's coming home?

143
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:30.710
When they were talking about the World Cup and he goes out with his saying those

144
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.990
colonize and constantly fucking dude went off.
I was just like,
you know,

145
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:39.560
white people,
what,
when we're not all bad.
I mean there's some things,
you know,

146
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.520
Oh,
windows curtains,
you know,
we've done some nice things,

147
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.770
you know,
now you can look out your house and see all the,

148
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:55.120
the lack of opportunity,
right,
right.
From inside your house without white.

149
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.450
Am I actually taking credit for windows?
I Dunno.
I have no idea.

150
00:09:01.451 --> 00:09:04.870
I don't read.
Oh,
speaking of which,
oh my God.

151
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.550
Oh my God.

152
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.090
I said on my last podcast that the Obama's bought an $82 million house.

153
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.510
Turned out it was an eight point $1 million house.

154
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.500
It wasn't even 8.2 million.
That's how off I was it.

155
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.290
This is my favorite thing.
So now all these people like what?

156
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.910
We're all gone.
What did you do?
Your fucking homework man,

157
00:09:30.911 --> 00:09:34.090
like nothing makes people flip out.
Not even religion,

158
00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.650
unless you make fun of Muslims,

159
00:09:35.651 --> 00:09:40.510
then those fucking lunatics a liable to do something,
but fucking if you make,

160
00:09:40.511 --> 00:09:44.890
if you make fun of like a Democrat or Republican,

161
00:09:44.891 --> 00:09:47.260
nothing brings people out of the woodworks.
All these people are like,

162
00:09:47.261 --> 00:09:49.660
why don't you do your fucking homework?
Blah Blah.
Which is hilarious.

163
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.870
This whole podcast is based on me not doing any homework,

164
00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.770
not reading whatsoever,
so I'm just going to tell you,

165
00:09:56.771 --> 00:10:01.130
you political cuts out there.
You've got a lot of fucking nerve.
A lot.

166
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.050
I just said AIDS came for white people fucking in the mud at Woodstock.

167
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.510
Are you going to come back at me on that one?
What did you do?

168
00:10:07.511 --> 00:10:09.100
Your fucking homework,
man,

169
00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.280
this whole podcast exists for one reason and one reason only.

170
00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:18.760
It's to make you feel smarter.
Ice.

171
00:10:18.761 --> 00:10:21.430
We here at the Monday morning podcast and by we,

172
00:10:21.431 --> 00:10:24.850
I mean me in the voices in my head that agree with me.

173
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:30.940
We hear it.
The Monday morning podcast set the bar so low that even you,

174
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.140
you know with that college that you went to that advertised on television and

175
00:10:37.421 --> 00:10:41.530
you drove yourself there and they like living there was not even an option.

176
00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.250
They didn't have dorms.
They just,
you know,

177
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.260
was your college one giant sad building looking like a high school for people in

178
00:10:51.611 --> 00:10:55.750
their twenties yeah.
Yeah.
That's who you are.
And you know what,

179
00:10:55.751 --> 00:10:59.770
even you get to feel smart on this podcast.
So my favorite thing is

180
00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.130
if you go back and you listen to

181
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.500
<v 3>yeah,</v>

182
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.100
<v 0>my podcasts on Monday when I thought I was so fucking write about the Obamas</v>

183
00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:12.630
buying this $82 million house is somebody actually wrote into the podcast and it

184
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:16.110
goes,
you know,
Bill,
I love you.
Put,
why don't you do your homework?

185
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.490
Obama just signed a $62 million book deal.
Okay.

186
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.730
And this is what fucking hilarious.
He's telling me to do my homework.

187
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.030
He didn't even do the homework to look up to double check.
What the fuck?

188
00:11:28.031 --> 00:11:30.100
I said even safe if it was true.

189
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.540
He just took it for granted that I said $82 million house and then he's like,

190
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.950
he took that as truth and started looking up the guy's fucking book deal.

191
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.080
So what did she do?
Your fucking homework man.
All right.

192
00:11:44.081 --> 00:11:48.280
For the 9000000th time.
Okay.
On this podcast,

193
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.500
do not take anything I say seriously?
Okay.

194
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:55.810
You can disagree with their web and you can correct me and all that,

195
00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:57.580
but just don't get upset

196
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.350
and don't be fucking surprised.

197
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:02.420
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

198
00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.070
<v 0>that I,
I fucking don't read.
And then might,</v>

199
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.790
my facts might be off.

200
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:08.590
<v 3>Okay.</v>

201
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.560
<v 0>By a good $72 million.
Okay.</v>

202
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.210
You know that you guys sound like all you fucking political cuts out that bitch

203
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:16.750
and happy.

204
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.770
You sound like all these fucking fat actresses out here who are bitching about

205
00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:24.790
Hollywood acting as though they're surprised that so much of this fucking

206
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:26.680
industry is based on how you look.

207
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.300
<v 3>Okay.</v>

208
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.080
<v 0>What was that really a shocker?</v>

209
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.190
Had you never been to a movie,
you didn't notice a trend.

210
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.090
Do you think it's just you?
You know what I mean?

211
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.430
And you fucking sloppy tits.
Who's having a rough time?

212
00:12:43.431 --> 00:12:47.210
And I'm a fucking bald redhead and mail.
I have no sympathy for you.

213
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.760
Oh,
he's knocking down their fucking door to put me in an action movie,
you know?

214
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.800
<v 3>Okay.</v>

215
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.300
<v 0>I could be hell boy.
Do a fucking cycle of steroids.
I already have the head.</v>

216
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.730
You just fucking paint it red and you're ready to go.

217
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.240
I could do a headstand and fucking my head would turn so red.

218
00:13:05.241 --> 00:13:08.630
You could save feeds the amount of money to save on makeup and time alone.

219
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.190
<v 3>Okay.</v>

220
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.160
<v 0>They'll do a fucking handstand.
Okay.
You're in this seat.</v>

221
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:17.360
Um,

222
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.160
<v 3>okay.</v>

223
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:19.993
<v 0>Anyways.</v>

224
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:20.910
<v 3>Okay.</v>

225
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.960
<v 0>So I guess the Obamas bought an eight point $1 million house,</v>

226
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.790
not an $82 million house,
which then led me into this whole thing.

227
00:13:29.791 --> 00:13:32.490
Like he's on his,
he's,
this is his third book that he's written.

228
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.450
It's like he was writing books while he was president and you supposed to be

229
00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:37.770
running the fucking country,

230
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.840
fucking sitting there dealing with the Russians and all this terrorist groups

231
00:13:42.841 --> 00:13:45.690
and all that shit.
And then you're like fucking at nighttime.

232
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:47.210
<v 3>Okay,</v>

233
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.720
<v 0>take out a little legal pad.
It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times.</v>

234
00:13:50.721 --> 00:13:54.110
He's fucking assholes out right in the books.
They always get like somebody else.

235
00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.070
It's like written by Bill Clinton and the other guy who actually wrote the book.

236
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.020
Yeah.
I want to run a thriller a lot about you and me.
Right?
It right.
Like,
Oh,

237
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.530
you'll put your name and put my name on the cover and then you like write it.

238
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.023
<v 3>Okay.</v>

239
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:12.620
<v 0>What is that book about?
You've got to write what you know.</v>

240
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.710
It's gotta be something about somebody fucking sneak around on his wife.
Right.

241
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.860
Sticking cigars and people.
Oh,
it's too on the nose.
I wanted to be challenged.

242
00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:27.050
I wrote about a guy who was faithful.
Um,
sorry for the bad Bill Clinton.

243
00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.630
Uh,
now you guys,
Bill,
why don't you do your homework?

244
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.050
The book is actually bugs experiences,
Oxford,

245
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.420
Oxford in England,

246
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.290
the home where it all started.

247
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:41.690
<v 3>Okay.</v>

248
00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.450
<v 0>I take both of those games.
I was working both days,</v>

249
00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:48.200
so I have to go back and watch them and I gotta tell you,
man,

250
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.750
I am so fucking sold on that game though.
I don't know what,

251
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.300
I had so much fun making fun of soccer all these fucking years and it's uh,

252
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:01.400
it's crazy.
And then watching the highlights,
uh,
when a goal is scored,

253
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:01.940
like my whole,

254
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.090
my whole complaint about the sport is what makes the sport so great.

255
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.320
The fact that scoring is so God damn difficult.
The fucking,

256
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.360
that the emotion that gets led off when these people score,

257
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.400
I mean,
Jesus Christ,
like in my country,

258
00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:24.320
if you dump a beer on somebody's after some sort of point is scored,

259
00:15:24.321 --> 00:15:27.410
you're going to get into a fight over there.
I mean,
it looked like a fucking,

260
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.280
I don't know what it looked like.
It looked like a,

261
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:34.400
a sports bar combined with the money shot in a porno.

262
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.870
Everybody's jumping up and down,
just spray in booze all over the place.

263
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.460
Pardon me?
I think it kind of was a little annoying.
Like why,
why,

264
00:15:42.461 --> 00:15:47.260
why are you wasting all that good boots?
You know,
cause I'm a,
I'm,

265
00:15:47.261 --> 00:15:49.160
I'm,
I'm taking another month off.
You know,
me,

266
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.490
I impose my own little fucking sabbaticals,
you know what I mean?
And after that,

267
00:15:55.491 --> 00:16:00.320
that my little excursion over there to Europe,
oh my God,

268
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:05.350
there's just I aisle that says sluts Onca 1664 that fucking beer tastes so god

269
00:16:07.901 --> 00:16:11.030
damn good in that Goddamn glass in that one cafe,

270
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.950
uh,
over there in Europe,
over there in France.
Right then I refuse.
I've,

271
00:16:17.951 --> 00:16:20.670
I've seen it over here and I've been tempted to buy it and it's like,

272
00:16:20.671 --> 00:16:23.140
I'm not going to fucking do it because this is what happens.

273
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.490
Like when you go to Ireland and you drink Guinness over there and then he come

274
00:16:26.491 --> 00:16:29.820
back here and you want to continue it.
It fucking sucks.

275
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.480
And you know what else I did?
You know,
it's just unbelievably like,

276
00:16:33.481 --> 00:16:37.590
just on another level is Indian food in England.

277
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.850
I went to this fucking place.
The Indian food was so god good.
I've been,
I,

278
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.550
I've ordered it twice sense that once in France it was okay.

279
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.810
And then I ordered it here in La and it fucking sucked.

280
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.880
<v 3>Okay.</v>

281
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.410
<v 0>And I was like,
I got to walk away.
You know,</v>

282
00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.440
it's like you go to Paris and he come home and be like,
you know,

283
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.440
I'm going to have a French breakfast.
I'm going to get to Paul Saul.
Right.

284
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.170
And then you'd go down to the fucking supermarket and you get it.

285
00:17:04.171 --> 00:17:07.080
And it's like somebody pulled it out of this shoe,
you know,

286
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:10.950
it just all goes back to the winning wrong thing.
Yes.
Go on.

287
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.650
Um,
you know what I mean?
That's the only thing that sucks about traveling.

288
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.690
<v 3>Okay.</v>

289
00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.000
<v 0>You know what I mean?
Like A,
I'm,</v>

290
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.310
I think I'm going to do a Gig in buffalo coming up.

291
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.870
I haven't been there in fucking forever.

292
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.020
And what's going to happen is I'm going to go to Duffy's or that other fucking

293
00:17:28.021 --> 00:17:33.021
place where you know where they came up with buffalo wings and I'm going to eat

294
00:17:33.271 --> 00:17:34.740
them and they're going to be so God damn good.

295
00:17:34.741 --> 00:17:35.940
And then I'm going to come back out here.

296
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:39.210
I'm going to have that fucking crack and my,
my,
my system going,
well,

297
00:17:39.211 --> 00:17:39.631
I'm going to get,

298
00:17:39.631 --> 00:17:42.690
I gotta get some wings out here and when I eat them and they're going to suck.

299
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:43.770
And then it's just depressing.

300
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:50.880
You like the only place to get good wings.
It's in Buffalo.
It really is.

301
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.660
I've never gone to any other place other than buffalo that really knows how to

302
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:57.880
make good buffalo wings.
That's it.

303
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.700
Now I just lob that out there for all of you guys to lose your fucking shit

304
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.160
<v 4>urge.
You went,
whoa.
You,
you're good.</v>

305
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:07.920
<v 3>Okay.</v>

306
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.400
<v 0>Which you want to do is go to Cincinnati and go to fucking Mfi.</v>

307
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:12.840
Stay of the best ones.

308
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:14.923
<v 3>Okay.</v>

309
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.450
<v 0>I follow Joe Rogan on all social media and he posted this really fascinating</v>

310
00:18:19.451 --> 00:18:21.100
thing that within 10 minutes I was like,

311
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.050
I don't even know what the fuck this guy's talking about.

312
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.270
He was talking something about fasting

313
00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.950
and how it's actually could be good for you.
I mean,
I've read,
I mean,

314
00:18:29.951 --> 00:18:32.890
Dick Gregory wrote a whole bunch of books on this type of Shit,
right?

315
00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.400
Rest his soul and a saying how,
you know,
let's see.

316
00:18:36.401 --> 00:18:38.560
Oregon's rejuvenate and all of that type of shit.

317
00:18:38.561 --> 00:18:42.010
And I thought it was really fascinating.
Until about 10 minutes in,
I realized I,

318
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.700
I didn't understand what the guy was talking about and I looked at him and he

319
00:18:45.701 --> 00:18:49.960
was not in the best of shape.
He looked a little mushy,
you know,

320
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:51.940
which I would think would happen if you fast it,

321
00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.640
you'd get a little fleshy cause your body would keep eating muscle.

322
00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:59.200
You know what I mean?
I Dunno.
But anyways,
um,

323
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.510
the fuck was my point.
It's talking about food.
Oh Jesus.

324
00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:09.500
I don't fucking know.
I have no idea.
Troubled in the Su is

325
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.880
<v 4>JFK blown away.</v>

326
00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.950
<v 0>Tips the table over like a fucking baby.</v>

327
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:19.783
<v 3>MMM.</v>

328
00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.310
<v 0>Why am I talking about that?</v>

329
00:19:22.311 --> 00:19:26.450
Because I was watching TV late night and I watched all these,
uh,

330
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.560
old 80s

331
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.183
<v 3>videos</v>

332
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:36.680
<v 0>and that song came on,
you know,
I'm telling you,</v>

333
00:19:36.681 --> 00:19:41.570
my new show is 77 sunset strip with Efram Zimbalist jr who I was always a big

334
00:19:41.571 --> 00:19:45.980
fan of cause that FBI show and uh,
end up in,
you know,

335
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.060
I've been made to,
you know,

336
00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:51.800
I think yesterday was the first day I snapped while driving in a while and it

337
00:19:51.801 --> 00:19:53.840
felt weird and I immediately

338
00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.730
dialed that back down and my move for all you other angry guys out there like me

339
00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.640
and you're not angry,
you're not an angry guy.
You just,

340
00:20:03.641 --> 00:20:06.280
that's your default emotion.
Like,
you know what I mean?

341
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.870
I'd like to really be an angry guy.

342
00:20:07.871 --> 00:20:10.600
You just have to be like walking around seeding,
which I don't,

343
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:14.500
I walk around totally normal and then something happens and I fucking flip out,

344
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:19.000
you know,
and have a fucking meltdown and then it just takes people.
It's just,

345
00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:24.030
it's so fucking over the top that everybody forgets what a great guy was for the

346
00:20:24.341 --> 00:20:27.130
previous four hours.
That's essentially what it is.

347
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.190
And it's like a fucking five minute meltdown,
you know?

348
00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.230
It's like,
what about the other four hours was a good guy?
And it's just like,

349
00:20:35.231 --> 00:20:39.510
no bill.
No what you did in that five minutes negated all that.

350
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.850
It's like doing four hours of fucking cardio and then sitting down and eating a

351
00:20:42.851 --> 00:20:46.780
box of fucking Oreo cookies.
It's just,
it's,
you just negated all of that.

352
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:48.020
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

353
00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.850
<v 0>Silver,
you still a fat fuck emotionally.
So anyways,
I,</v>

354
00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:54.170
I listened to baseball.

355
00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.730
I listen to the red sox on Sirius Xm and uh,

356
00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.330
actually watched.
Then I came home and that's making me watch them again.

357
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.460
Fucking Chris sales up,
guide the beast.

358
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.430
He watched the game last night when he walked that guy,

359
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.770
he didn't think that he walked him and he got fucking mad.

360
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.950
She started throwing like 98,
99 miles an hour on the corners.

361
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.120
That crazy delivery.
Um,

362
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:19.850
I dunno,
we shall see that.

363
00:21:19.851 --> 00:21:22.300
I don't know who that bum was that they brought into the fucking eighth inning.

364
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:26.150
Then almost gave me were up four to nothing and he's like,
you know what?

365
00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:31.180
Let's make the gamblers nervous is a nice fatty hanging out over the plate.

366
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.830
Bam,
Bass head boom.

367
00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:38.120
Double four to one load 'em up and they finally got him out of there.

368
00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.540
Then our relief pitcher,
I don't know anybody's name,

369
00:21:41.541 --> 00:21:42.410
that guy who comes out there,

370
00:21:42.411 --> 00:21:44.840
he hangs his arm like he's driving a shirt or some shit.

371
00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.850
He came out there and shut them the fuck down.
Um,

372
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.690
so I'm,
I'm like a,

373
00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:56.050
I'm back into that shit and I'm actually going to be really sad when the World

374
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:59.410
Cup's over.
When is the finals that on Saturday,

375
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:05.150
that's going to be crazy one match for all the fucking models.

376
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.240
Can you imagine if that comes down to penalty kicks again?

377
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.940
I used to think that was the stupidest fucking thing ever.

378
00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:17.420
Like a world bass,
like a basketball championship coming down to foul shots,

379
00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:21.950
you know what I mean?
That would just be like boring as shit.
But now I get it.

380
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.080
I get it because if you fuck it up,

381
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.130
I really feel like the goaltender has like no pressure cause all he has to do is

382
00:22:28.131 --> 00:22:30.590
just guess,
you know,

383
00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:35.150
I love that they're guessing it's just a total guests.
And when they guess,
right,

384
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:36.780
they guess,
right.
They stand up like,

385
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.560
like there was some sort of intelligent thought there.
It's just like left,
right,

386
00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:47.260
left,
right diving left.
Fucky went right.
Um,

387
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:50.800
that always,
it's always funny when they guess wrong when they're,

388
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.900
they start to dive that way and they realize that guy went the other way and you

389
00:22:53.901 --> 00:22:56.750
just watched the goaltender,
like his whole body goes limp.
Like,
ah,

390
00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:01.400
I should tell the other way.
And he just fucking landed on the grass.

391
00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:08.390
But the pressure on the shooter,
they don't want to miss the net.

392
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.130
So I,

393
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:15.250
I'm gathering it takes massive balls to try to shoot it up top to go top corner,

394
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.860
which why wouldn't you just go there?
He's not going to fucking get that.

395
00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:19.791
Cause it's like,

396
00:23:19.791 --> 00:23:24.560
what if I miss then I'm that cunt that fucking missed for the rest of my fucking

397
00:23:24.561 --> 00:23:29.410
life in fat,
crooked,
great teeth,
fishing ship.

398
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.770
Eaton fucking assholes can get my grill everywhere I go for the rest of my life.

399
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:38.810
People who never accomplish shit now can take out the failure of their life on

400
00:23:38.811 --> 00:23:43.130
me cause I tried to go top shelf.
What do you guys call it?
What do we,

401
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.830
what do you guys call shelves over there?
The the boot.

402
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.720
What the fuck do you always have some stupid fucking name for it?
Um,

403
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.200
I've got to send on cooking shows.

404
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:55.940
Every ingredient you guys pronounce differently.
Oregano or Rogano,

405
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.860
tomato,
tomato.

406
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.200
Bazell Basel Second.
They just fucking with me.

407
00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.470
There wasn't one thing.
Did we hate England that much?
By the end of it,

408
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.330
I really think that we would like to summer school kids that came over here in

409
00:24:12.331 --> 00:24:15.610
like the weird religious people.
Yeah.

410
00:24:15.611 --> 00:24:18.790
We all came over here and you had people who weren't good in school.

411
00:24:18.791 --> 00:24:23.320
Fucking people that were too into religion and those two people combine made

412
00:24:23.321 --> 00:24:24.154
Americans.

413
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.190
That's why I am the product of that.

414
00:24:30.191 --> 00:24:33.670
And I thought an eight point $1 million house was $82 million.

415
00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:37.780
Why don't you do your homework but you go fuck yourself.

416
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.900
Do my homework.
I'm not in fucking school.
Alright,
only getting this.

417
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.560
There's business to thank.
All right,
let me,
let me read it.

418
00:24:47.561 --> 00:24:51.720
A little bit of advertising here.
JFK blown away.

419
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.810
The tipping over for can table.

420
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.570
I still love Billy Joel cause he got so hammered he drove his car through his

421
00:25:01.571 --> 00:25:05.140
fucking neighbor's living room window.
I mean can yet,

422
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:09.970
can you loan him enough sugar in your lifetime to get past that?
You know,

423
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.970
every day I'd be knocking on the door.
Hey Man,

424
00:25:12.971 --> 00:25:16.080
if you want to borrow a rake or a wheel barrow,
anything,
anything you,

425
00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:18.070
you know Barrow by the way,

426
00:25:18.071 --> 00:25:23.071
not barrel roll out the Barrow where Ray can some fuck and leaves.

427
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.360
By the way,
Dean del Ray from the letter B talk podcast on all things.

428
00:25:31.361 --> 00:25:35.770
Comedy has the legendary Henry Rollins on his podcasts this week.

429
00:25:35.771 --> 00:25:38.080
This is a dream guest for Dean del race.

430
00:25:38.081 --> 00:25:42.220
He'd want to listen to him fanboy out while asking all the questions.

431
00:25:42.221 --> 00:25:46.810
You always wanted to hear Henry Rollins answer.
Give a take a few.

432
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.160
Um,
check it out in the all things coming network.
Let there be talk.

433
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:56.190
Dean del Rey with the Great Henry Rollins who had such a funny bit on iron

434
00:25:56.891 --> 00:25:57.221
maiden,

435
00:25:57.221 --> 00:26:01.900
he actually made me question whether I was a moron for liking the band.

436
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.260
And then of course I put on one of their songs and I was like,
no,
I wasn't.

437
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:09.430
I wasn't
right.
It sounds,
uh,

438
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.600
we read this book about a bloke who had wings and he flew too close to the sun.

439
00:26:15.001 --> 00:26:19.140
So there's songs about a bloke who put some wings on and flew too close to the

440
00:26:19.141 --> 00:26:22.170
sun.
Um,
all right.
Butcher box.

441
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:29.050
Butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass fed and grass finished beef free range,

442
00:26:30.801 --> 00:26:33.830
organic chicken.
And this is right.
This is the money shot right here.

443
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.960
And heritage bread,
pork,
the best God,

444
00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.980
the import shop I've ever had in my life that I ever made in my house,

445
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.350
I think maybe one time and went to some five star restaurant.

446
00:26:46.351 --> 00:26:48.990
You know the rep fucking chefs walking around wearing clogs.

447
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.240
You got to go to one of those places,
you know,

448
00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:55.050
and there's all these old bald guys like me with these skinny young broads,

449
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.470
you know,
Aka their second or third wife.
You know,

450
00:26:58.471 --> 00:26:59.580
you gotta go to a place like that.

451
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:02.820
If you don't want to drop that kind of cash and you still want the best pork

452
00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:06.300
chop you ever going to have,
you got to get butchered bucks.
All right there.

453
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.850
There's my personal farther that I just made it personal.
Okay?

454
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.780
The incredible quality of butcher box meets starts with the commitment to

455
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:17.290
raising animals humanely and free of antibiotics and hormones before they kill

456
00:27:17.291 --> 00:27:21.240
them.
Each box comes with at least nine to 11 pounds of meat,

457
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:26.430
which is enough for 24 individual size meals.
You could feed a fucking army.

458
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.510
You can choose from five different box types.
All beef,
beef and chicken,

459
00:27:30.511 --> 00:27:34.410
beef and pork mixed box.
Go crazy,
man.

460
00:27:34.411 --> 00:27:39.180
Throws many animals in there.
As you can custom box let you choose your own cuts.

461
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.270
Come on,
man.
It's the fucking,

462
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.410
get the grill.
Go and get some butcher box.

463
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.760
This ad always makes me hungry.
That's how good the food has been.

464
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:56.070
A antibiotic slash hormone free butcher box believes in healthier food system

465
00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.870
where everyone has access to meets the way nature intended.

466
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.290
Now,
like these cows and mainstream where they got the fake tits and the fucking

467
00:28:04.291 --> 00:28:06.360
botox.
All right,

468
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.500

00:28:10.501 --> 00:28:13.560

this episode is brought to you by four sigmatic four sigmatic the leading online

485
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.640
purveyors of shrooms,
man.
That's right.

486
00:29:17.641 --> 00:29:20.010
There's Shalon shrooms on the Internet,

487
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:23.760
but really this company sells mushroom coffee that actually tastes great.

488
00:29:23.761 --> 00:29:28.170
It is damn good for you.
I fucking love mushrooms.
I would actually try this.

489
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:33.510
You know,
I love mushroom soup.
I've always wanted to try mushrooms.
You know,

490
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.930
I know.
I know where you're going to say.
Talk to Ari.

491
00:29:36.931 --> 00:29:41.190
Shaffir four sigmatic um,

492
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.600
is from Finland,
so you know,
it's good.

493
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.810
The same country that gave you Santa Claus.
Angry beards

494
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.230

I hit,
I would say as the goaltender for the Boston Bruins.

495
00:29:53.231 --> 00:29:56.020
Like he didn't already know that.
And of course,
mushroom coffee.

496
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.981
Did you know that?

497
00:29:56.981 --> 00:30:00.430
Finished people consume more coffee per capita than any other country?

498
00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:05.220
Almost three times more than Americans.
I don't like that.
We're losing to them.

499
00:30:05.221 --> 00:30:09.210
And coffee.
Mushroom coffee has half the caffeine of regular coffee,

500
00:30:09.211 --> 00:30:13.260
but it's twice as magical.
It's easy on the gut,
less acidic,

501
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.190
and you don't get the jittery feeling you get from regular coffee.
Dude,
I'm sold.

502
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:22.500
I'd love a nice hot cup of fucking mushroom coffee right now.
Um,

503
00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:26.630
evidently I'm drinking the mushroom coffee with lion's Mane and Chaga.

504
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.230
Lion's mane.
There's hair in the fucking coffee.
Tastes just like coffee.

505
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.130
Not like mushrooms.
Oh,

506
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.150
<v 2>ah,</v>

507
00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:41.390
<v 0>okay.

not to say it tastes like mushrooms,
I guess it doesn't.</v>

508
00:30:41.391 --> 00:30:46.040
It tastes like coffee.
Lion's mane.
Mushroom is your brain's best friend,

509
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:50.900
long used by Buddhist monks.
They never lose their shit.

510
00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.690
Right.
To help with focus during meditation.

511
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:57.860
I got to try this shit perfect for when I need to get shit done.

512
00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.460
Think of it as supercharged instant coffee come.

513
00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.610
I think how this is all in the past tense like I've done this in my life has

514
00:31:04.611 --> 00:31:05.540
changed for the better,

515
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:10.070
but I'm sold coming easy to use carry single serving packets.

Doodoodoo to Biondi is beyond these is sick of fucking being alone.

529
00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:01.380
But then England lost through the Croatians.

530
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:06.040
Now that cup is still on vacation and a coming.

534
00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.740
Um,

man,
the Croatian,

537
00:32:31.671 --> 00:32:35.040
some good looking God damn people and it's only 4.1 million of them.

538
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.200
According to Pete Davidson.
There's more people in New York City,

539
00:32:39.201 --> 00:32:43.040
then there's in their entire country and they are in the finals.

540
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.410
So I think I kind of have to root for them

541
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:51.650
cause they're the underdogs again.
No,

They actually had a Hashtag a hashtag things I don't tolerate.

616
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.100
Oh my God.
It had to be the most self serving fucking thing ever since.

helix.
There's nobody on the planet like you.

623
00:37:44.091 --> 00:37:48.830
So why the fuck would you buy a generic mattress built for everyone else?

624
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.980
Maybe cause you hate shopping.
I don't know.

Well,
I will,

626
00:37:55.101 --> 00:37:55.934

I don't think it does.</v>

655
00:39:49.211 --> 00:39:52.240
I think it's Hallux.
I feel like I knew this.

656
00:39:52.241 --> 00:39:55.720
I feel like I gave you shit about it.
Oh,
okay.
And now I don't remember.

657
00:39:55.870 --> 00:40:00.310
Now you don't remember?
Hey,
so last night
I went,

658
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:05.650
last night I was out and about,
I went to a bobcat.

659
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:10.210
Goldthwait has a new show on true TV called bobcat.

660
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.080
Goldthwait.
Uh,
was it monsters and um,

661
00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:17.050
Miss Smith's misfits in monster,
something like that.
I don't know what it is,

662
00:40:17.051 --> 00:40:20.290
but it's on true TV.
I watched an episode of it last night.
It's fucking,

663
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:24.220
it's classic bobcat.
It's totally original.
If you just look up,

664
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:27.880
if you just search bobcat Goldthwait right.
If you do that,

665
00:40:27.881 --> 00:40:30.460
you're going to find it's on true TV.
What was the last name?

666
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.790
What was the last night?
Wednesday.
Yes.
Wednesday.

667
00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.540
So Wednesday night at 10 o'clock on true TV.
That's all right.
There you go.

668
00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.390
So I went down to the premiere.

669
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.870
I got there late because I was working as an actor.

670
00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.200
I had to take off my little fucking tights when I was done acting.
Yeah.

671
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.400
I was feeling guilty because I wanted to go down there.
I had friends,

672
00:40:51.401 --> 00:40:53.680
I had to see them,
but I hadn't done standup in a minute.

673
00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.960
And I'm going to be in Portland and Seattle this weekend,

674
00:40:55.961 --> 00:40:57.730
so I got to shake the fucking rust off.

675
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:02.290
I wish I could go to Portland and Seattle with you.

676
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:06.520
Well Nia,
it's only a southwest or Alaskan flight away.

677
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:09.690
<v 7>Yeah.
I want to go.
I want to have a friend in Portland.</v>

678
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:14.610
I've always wanted to see Portland and I just feel like the microphone is so

679
00:41:14.611 --> 00:41:15.280
close to my right.

680
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.750
<v 0>Oh,
sorry.
Um,
yeah.
And I've never been to Seattle either.</v>

681
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.320
Both ways.
I've been wanting to go.
I invited you.
Yeah.

682
00:41:23.321 --> 00:41:26.680
You then can I get back to my story?
Oh,
sorry.

683
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:32.140
So this is what I love about La.
So I'm walking out,
I ubered over right,

684
00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.240
smoked a cigar with one of my great friends in this business.

685
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.690
And then I was walking out on APP,
man,
I didn't do standup.

686
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:42.640
Should I pause fucking Uber over there and then Uber home.
Fuck this.

687
00:41:42.641 --> 00:41:46.940
So I just start walking home and I walked by a fucking who does?

688
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.030
And there was these young comics parking up front,

689
00:41:50.031 --> 00:41:52.460
a comedy show come and they saw me coming down the street and they laugh,
hey,

690
00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:54.770
want to go to a comedy show?
I said,
no.
And they go,
do you want to go up?
I'm like,

691
00:41:54.771 --> 00:41:58.460
Nah,
thank you though.
And then I walked about 10 feet.
I was like,
fuck it,

692
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.020
I need to get a set in.

693
00:42:00.021 --> 00:42:05.021
And I went in there and I did a set at Hooters last night upstairs in the big

694
00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:10.060
room,
in the main room.
It was a bunch of young kids there while you were there?

695
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:15.740
No.
What about the buffalo shrimp,
Nina?
I literally walked in.
It was awesome.

696
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:19.820
They put me on like the fucking president.
They put me on immediately.
I went up.

697
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:25.250
I did 'em of course,
Bill,
everybody knows you at Hooters.
I um,

698
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.700
I went on and I said,
I do 10 to 15.
I feel like I did around 12.

699
00:42:28.701 --> 00:42:32.390
That felt like a 12.
I got my labs,
I shook the rust off and I fucking walked out.

700
00:42:32.391 --> 00:42:34.970
It was great.
It was perfect.
Then I walked out,

701
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.170
walked halfway down the block and there was a taxi,
which I love old school,

702
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:43.910
and I got into it.
I say,
I say,
you work in?
And he goes,
he goes,
yes.
And I got in,

703
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:48.510
I got,
I ain't doing,
he goes,
yeah.
So,
so I was like,
all right,

704
00:42:48.511 --> 00:42:50.020
I appreciate that.
And he goes,

705
00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:55.560
and he left this mother fucker where they fucking fucking drive it home.

706
00:42:55.561 --> 00:43:00.000
Just curse.
I can be myself just cursing everybody in the way.

707
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:05.160
That night.
Last night,
I had a great night.
Yes.
Without alcohol.

708
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.580
I don't need it,
man.
Can we just talk about Hooters for a second?

709
00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.150
I really love the Buffalo Shrimp.

710
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:17.610
Yeah,
it's swamp with buffalo sauce.
It's just like,
oh.

711
00:43:17.611 --> 00:43:21.150
And they give you like this blue cheese dipping sauce to go with it.
Oh my God.

712
00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:24.360
It's too blue cheese is the most disgusting.

713
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:26.250
One of one of the more disgusting foods.

714
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.050
You know that we watch an undercover brother and they were talking about how

715
00:43:30.051 --> 00:43:34.400
white people like white people,
like very underrated movie by the way.
So funny.

716
00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.560
Yeah.
How um,

717
00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:41.150
white people like Manet's and evidently black people don't.

718
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.060
I don't fucking know my whatever.

719
00:43:44.061 --> 00:43:47.320
I Dunno what I like Manet's within reason.

720
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:51.820
I like man,
he's like,
man,
he's on fries.
I like mayonnaise on roast beef.

721
00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:58.270
I like eating Manet's in front of people that don't enjoy Manet's.
Um,

722
00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:02.290
no,
I like a buy blue cheese is just fuck God.
It's like

723
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:08.200
Buffalo shrimp and,
and blue cheese dressing on my God.
It's just like,

724
00:44:08.201 --> 00:44:11.860
it's like a mucus.
It's gross.

725
00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.810
I think when you eat wings,

726
00:44:13.811 --> 00:44:16.840
you're just eat the wing cause you don't even use any of this sauce.
No rant.

727
00:44:16.841 --> 00:44:21.470
What about ranch?
What are your feelings about ranch?
Oh,

728
00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:24.270
it's all right.
I just

729
00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:32.250
know,
I know for a man he is,
you know,
I like ketchup.
I like mayonnaise.

730
00:44:32.251 --> 00:44:36.750
Mustard.
I like the basic hair.
Yeah.
I'm,

731
00:44:36.751 --> 00:44:41.640
I'm a basic white dude.
I like pickles.
Yup.
Uh,

732
00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.020
I like a snake.
Here's,

733
00:44:43.021 --> 00:44:45.310
here's a nice little surprise here as you can see that I've traveled.

734
00:44:45.311 --> 00:44:46.410
I like a stuffed.
All of,

735
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:50.790
does that make me interesting?

736
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.850
My walking it out to you was that some dance?

737
00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:01.200
They didn't land it from years ago.
Oh God,
I'm on Instagram.

738
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:04.380
I know all the latest dances are really neat and once you get up and do the

739
00:45:04.381 --> 00:45:05.490
mashed potato for me,

740
00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:11.640
I got to get you to do a a in my feelings challenge.
All right,

741
00:45:11.641 --> 00:45:16.170
go ahead and do it.
Well,
the dance,
you got to play the song to dance.

742
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.920
It's a dance that you do to a Drake song called in my feelings.

743
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:24.330
I can't stand Drake.
Do you love me?
Are you riding?

744
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.120
You haven't seen it.
I can't.
I can't stand that guy.

745
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:30.570
Not Literally that guy you used to,

746
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.150
you used to like Drake.
He used to always whining about somebody.

747
00:45:36.151 --> 00:45:38.130
It's just like he,
he's got this great life.

748
00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.430
He's banging models and I got to sit there and listen to him whine about the

749
00:45:41.431 --> 00:45:44.670
model that he used to fuck.
Who doesn't call them back anymore?
It's like Drake.

750
00:45:44.671 --> 00:45:48.870
You were just fucking her.
She moved on.
He's emotional.

751
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:51.210
He isn't.
He's selfish.

752
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:58.650
Um,
but he loves magic magic.

753
00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:03.150
I've seen like three different videos of him running away after a trick.

754
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.670
That's what's really funny about black people as you can.

755
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:13.110
You can see somebody hustling you lying to you and all that type of shit.

756
00:46:13.111 --> 00:46:17.370
You know,
like you just,
you can smell bullshit from a mile of fucking way,

757
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:21.810
but you get a magician does a card trick.
You guys run away like he's a witch.

758
00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:25.750
What the fuck was that?
Yeah,
cause that's that devil shit.

759
00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:35.220
It's that.
It's of hand near all that.
Oh No,
that's the devil.

760
00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:38.220
Yeah.
If that guy could do that shit,
if that guy could do that shit,

761
00:46:38.221 --> 00:46:41.220
he would just fucking like levitate into a bank vault.

762
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:45.810
You wouldn't be fucking hustle and doing magic on a street corner.
Right.

763
00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.613
It's still

764
00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:54.360
it just playing with evil forces with the magic shit.
All right.

765
00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.060
Playing with evil forces with the magic shit.

766
00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:59.220
You heard that that should be on a tee shirt

767
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.570
plain with the evil forces,
with the magic shit

768
00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:09.840
that has to be in a rap song has to be in something I don't like hate Drake.

769
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.380
I just like,
his fucking music is just like,
you don't,

770
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:16.350
you don't like this guys that just call up and they just dump your day the day

771
00:47:16.351 --> 00:47:18.870
on you.
It's just like,
do you ever in a good mood

772
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.680
what happened now Drake,

773
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:30.880
a lot of problems.
People are coming for him.
They're trying to expose,
you know,

774
00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:34.300
his family life that he was trying to keep private,
you know?
Yeah.

775
00:47:34.301 --> 00:47:37.360
That's none of my business.
All him anymore.
That was weak.

776
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:39.070
That was a week doing that shit.

777
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:46.750
We didn't start the fire.
All right.
I gotta get,
I gotta get off my day.

778
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:48.580
Oh my God.
I hate that

779
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.740
Charlie Chaplin.
Teddy Roosevelt fucking people from the past.
Bob Apo,

780
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:59.110
but Dopa to bell.
Stop fucking avoiding the topic.

781
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:04.410
Second generation did a lot of shitty things.
Trouble.

782
00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.880
It's the worst line ever.
All right.
Having said that,
I love,

783
00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:13.150
I like a lot of his songs.

784
00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.870
I feel like you don't talk enough about stuff that you enjoy it.

785
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.880
I feel like you're now going to talk about what you don't like about me in the

786
00:48:18.881 --> 00:48:21.160
relationship.
Okay.
Yup.

787
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:25.330
So I feel like coming up about the things that you like.

788
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.780
You always talking about what you can don't like and I just see what's going on

789
00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:31.330
and on how,
I love soccer and I hated soccer and I love it.

790
00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.090
But there's been this whole fucking transformation.
Yeah,

791
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.840
I missed that pile because you focus on the negative.
No,

792
00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:40.330
I think you have a nice size.

793
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:45.640
He's such a hassle.
We finally became friends again.

794
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:50.350
We're buddies again because of the work that I've put in.
Like,
excuse me,

795
00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:51.540
what about me?
No,

796
00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:55.390
I told you you becoming like this goth chick that shops at hot topic.

797
00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.870
That was your vibe.
Gloom and doom.

798
00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:02.360
A lot of really a modern references.
Did they?

799
00:49:02.361 --> 00:49:07.180
Do they not exist anymore?
I don't know.
Do they?
And I dunno.

800
00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:11.080
I haven't been to them on a while,
so fuck you haven't,
last time I talked to you,

801
00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:15.400
where are you?
I'm ethic grove.
Oh yeah.
But they don't have a hot topic.

802
00:49:15.401 --> 00:49:19.880
So do they still exist?
I Dunno.
They're high end.

803
00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:26.110
All right,
go ahead.
Shit on me.
What do you got?
No,
no,
you're right.

804
00:49:26.111 --> 00:49:29.740
We're friends again after having a little moment there.

805
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:33.790
So now I'm going to keep it positive.
I think you're great.

806
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:38.410
I think that you're are stick with the devil shit with the creepy vibes or

807
00:49:38.411 --> 00:49:42.710
whatever the fuck you said.
Um,
oh God.

808
00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.550
Anyways,
I was trying to end on an upbeat note.

809
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:48.430
Who Wore it better?

810
00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.840
The Marvin Gaye beard Drake or Marvin Gaye.

811
00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:57.760
Marvin Gaye obviously rock the Marvin Gaye beard.
Better than Drake would.

812
00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:03.430
Who wore that red hat better?
Marvin Gaye.
Jacques Cousteau.

813
00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:04.753
Marvin Gaye.

814
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:10.120
And now my goal is to try to get you not to say Marvin Gaye.

815
00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:14.680
Um,
who is more important?

816
00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.310
You know what?
I can't go that route.
You'll get upset with that one.

817
00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:25.870
I didn't even have anything there.
What'd you have to keep saying Marvin Gaye?

818
00:50:25.871 --> 00:50:26.671
It's an Improv thing.

819
00:50:26.671 --> 00:50:29.570
You should have gone to Jacques Cousteau then I could have gone the French way.

820
00:50:29.571 --> 00:50:32.480
I had the ocean outlet.
You just paid me into a corner.
Oh,

821
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:37.550
so it's my fault that you're not,
I dunno.
Good at Improv.

822
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.011
Yeah.

823
00:50:40.011 --> 00:50:44.900
I killed upstairs in the big room and didn't even bother to get buffalo shrimp.

824
00:50:44.901 --> 00:50:46.600
It's like,
yeah,

825
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.710
I was too busy killing upstairs.
Eto.

826
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:52.910
Hooter so when is your next Hooters,
the,

827
00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:56.800
at the Hooters in Hollywood and in the big room?
Well,
I guess they're moved,

828
00:50:56.810 --> 00:51:01.810
they're moving their show across the street to looters.

829
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:04.180
I don't fucking know.

830
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:08.390
Whatever's across the street did fucking Hollywood boulevard,
you know,

831
00:51:08.391 --> 00:51:10.760
we didn't have,
we didn't have any fire for the cigars there,

832
00:51:10.761 --> 00:51:12.550
so I had to go into tourist play,

833
00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:17.720
have had fire is that we rubbed some matches fucking to gather.

834
00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:22.190
Um,
and went into one of those touristy places and I bought a,

835
00:51:22.191 --> 00:51:25.910
I love California lighter for my buddy who hates la,

836
00:51:25.911 --> 00:51:28.130
which is worked twice and then it broke.

837
00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:32.630
It was like three bucks and then it ran out of lighter fluid.
They're so cheap.

838
00:51:32.631 --> 00:51:37.250
All those,
like they're always going,
hey man,
we got souvenirs for $5.
It's like,

839
00:51:37.251 --> 00:51:40.730
no,
you need to be solidly souvenirs for 50 cents,
if that.

840
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:44.060
My favorite thing is when you go to New York and they have that,
you know,

841
00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:48.350
that that foam rubber thing where you wear the crown from the fucking statue of

842
00:51:48.351 --> 00:51:53.000
Liberty.
People walk around with that.
Like I went to New York and I got this.

843
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:57.710
Can you imagine how many those are floating around the fucking ocean?

844
00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:01.770
Some poor fucking porpoises trying to swallow that thing.
All right,
we're out.

845
00:52:01.771 --> 00:52:06.140
I'm out of time here cause I got,
I got shit to do here.
Or is it 52 minutes?
Um,

846
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:10.040
thank you for coming on here in bringing the positivity.

847
00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:14.650
I try.
I'll do better next time.
I'll do better next time.

848
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:17.180
You did great with the devil shit with the evil stuff over there.

Um,

852
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:34.150

You can send a check in on your Thursday,
you'll fine.

857
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.220
<v 5>I
imagine</v>

858
00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.680
travel as much as

859
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:15.990
some of us,

860
00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:21.010
some of us live in houses,

861
00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.370
some of the light,

862
00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:37.870
<v 0>you guys see that coming.
I just saw a commercial</v>

863
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:43.410
for Kentucky Fried Chicken where the parents are all excited because the two

864
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:47.400
bratty kids won't sit still at the dinner table,

865
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:51.140
but they got them this fucking chicken and they're feeding it to and they're

866
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:55.560
basically very suddenly saying that there's drugs in this chicken that will make

867
00:53:55.561 --> 00:53:59.940
you a spastic children.
Chill the fuck out and spastic.
I mean like,
you know,
not,

868
00:53:59.941 --> 00:54:02.490
not the way they mean it over there.
And Great Britain.

869
00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:05.130
You can't say that on the comedy.

870
00:54:05.131 --> 00:54:09.150
So you can say it in a comedy club over in Scotland,
but you'll have a rough,

871
00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:12.720
they'll have a rough go of it.
If you say the kid was spastic over there,

872
00:54:12.721 --> 00:54:16.710
that means like severely mentally challenged over here.

873
00:54:16.711 --> 00:54:18.960
It just means you're not going to get laid to you 26

874
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:27.770
when you were in Grad school looking over a fucking cadaver,
right,

875
00:54:27.771 --> 00:54:30.050
with some other fucking nerve narrowed.
Right.

876
00:54:30.051 --> 00:54:31.280
And you're just sitting there going,

877
00:54:31.281 --> 00:54:34.430
you know the ankle bones connected to the knee bone,
right.

878
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.830
Has any of this made any sense?
What shouldn't?

879
00:54:36.831 --> 00:54:40.700
It's fucking Sunday night and I am spent and I got a whole bunch of Shit I have

880
00:54:40.701 --> 00:54:44.510
to do tomorrow,
so I got to do it tonight.
All right,
I'm off my game.

881
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:49.460
All right,
you,
you cleanse your liver and like 42 43 days or something like that.

882
00:54:49.461 --> 00:54:52.160
Every drunk I knows has told me that if he drunk,

883
00:54:52.161 --> 00:54:55.190
I know that does not have a medical degree.

884
00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:58.850
Has told me that if you go 42 43 days,

885
00:54:58.851 --> 00:55:03.830
you will cleanse your liver at least to the booze.
You know?
Now if you fucking,

886
00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:09.920
you start doing blow or a,
you know,
eating a bunch of trans fat fucking food,

887
00:55:09.921 --> 00:55:12.410
a feeding your kids,
Kentucky Fried fucking chicken,

888
00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:18.390
Jesus Christ.
What happened to parents and she got a drug,

889
00:55:18.391 --> 00:55:23.390
your kids to keep them under control,
you know,
you know what it is.

890
00:55:23.391 --> 00:55:27.470
Kids don't respect their parents,
they respect them,
but they don't respect like,

891
00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.950
oh my God,
this,
this person could wring my neck,

892
00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:33.830
could pick me up by my hair.
Right.

893
00:55:33.831 --> 00:55:37.220
Could grab a paddle and fucking,
you know,

894
00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.230
mostly hit my ass,

895
00:55:39.231 --> 00:55:43.130
but also kinda hit my lower back because I'm squirming right.

896
00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:47.630
That doesn't exist anymore.
So now these kids is so fucking out of control.

897
00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:52.370
These people have to go down to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Okay.

898
00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:53.220
And I,
I,

899
00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:58.220
I used the term chicken very loosely to go down in whatever that is that's in

900
00:56:00.051 --> 00:56:04.220
that bucket.
Okay?
It doesn't have a beak.

901
00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:09.520
It doesn't have feet.
If it's fucking,
you know,
chest,

902
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:13.370
his breasts to stick it out like the cast on fucking,
uh,
what was,

903
00:56:13.371 --> 00:56:17.540
what was that show with the Italians there on New Jersey Shore Jersey shore.

904
00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:21.350
Right.
My world.
That's not a fucking chicken.

905
00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:23.790
You know,

906
00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:28.230
you want the chicken that looked like Mark McGuire and his rookie season.

907
00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:32.190
You don't want to eat the chicken that looks like mark McGwire when he fucking

908
00:56:32.191 --> 00:56:34.920
played for the cardinals.
You know?

909
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:40.000
Do you eat a regular fucking chicken?
First of all,

910
00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:43.570
it's going to look like a pigeon tea because you so used to seeing those roid it

911
00:56:43.571 --> 00:56:47.890
up once that they have murderer's row that you got down there at your fucking

912
00:56:47.891 --> 00:56:52.480
Shaws,
right?
You Vaughn's you,
JC pennys,

913
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:55.660
wherever the fuck you buy your God damn check it.
You go down,

914
00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:59.140
you go down to any one of the main stream fucking supermarkets.

915
00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:04.840
Okay.
And I swear to God when you get to the chicken section,
okay,
if you've,

916
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:09.550
if you've slept for the last 30 years,
like that Van Gundy guy under the bridge,

917
00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:14.230
whatever his fucking name is,
Van Morrison,
the hell's his name,
Rip Van Winkle.

918
00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.690
Right.
It was one of those people,
one of the vans.
Um,

919
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:20.270
<v 3>okay.</v>

920
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:23.060
<v 0>If you slept for the last 30 years and you went down,
okay.</v>

921
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:26.300
And they showed you what a chicken wants,
you'd be like,
you'd be like,

922
00:57:26.301 --> 00:57:31.180
that ain't no chicken.
Okay?
It's a God damn Turkey.
I know.
Fuck Dyno

923
00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:33.400
<v 1>fucking Turkey.
When I say what?</v>

924
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:37.410
I ain't no such thing as a math path.

925
00:57:37.411 --> 00:57:42.000
Fucking chicken can't be done.
No Sir.
No Sir.

926
00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:46.860
Get off my property.
Okay.
I'm,
I'm done with your witchcraft.
Okay.
Hey,

927
00:57:46.861 --> 00:57:47.910

928
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:49.840
<v 3>Okay.</v>

929
00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:50.980
<v 1>Fuck off my property.</v>

930
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:53.633
<v 3>MMM</v>

931
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.200
<v 1>honey,

Um,</v>

932
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:03.500
<v 0>yeah,
you would think it was a fucking Turkey.
And the thing is,</v>

933
00:58:03.501 --> 00:58:06.350
is now it's a chicken.
And I remember I watched one of those food banks,

934
00:58:06.351 --> 00:58:08.390
one of those fucking liberal Goddamn thinks,
you know,

935
00:58:08.391 --> 00:58:11.690
talking about flying carpets and electric roads and all that bullshit.

936
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:13.820
Somewhere in there they were talking about,
you know,

937
00:58:13.821 --> 00:58:17.060
the food supply and I'll poison it is poisonous

938
00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:20.520
<v 1>poisoning.
And it is,
it is.
Um,</v>

939
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:25.770
so I fucking went down to a farmer's fucking mark yet.

940
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:30.330
And um,
I said,
I wanna,
I wanna,

941
00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:32.970
I wanna all I want.
I want to,
I want it all

942
00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:35.810
<v 0>natural fucking chicken.
I can't even talk.
I'm so tired.</v>

943
00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.970
One an all natural chicken.

944
00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:43.730
<v 1>The guy goes,
these are all natural.
And I said,
all natural.
And he goes,</v>

945
00:58:43.731 --> 00:58:46.820
well,
I'm like,
come on,
where is it?

946
00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:51.500
And he had to walk around the corner sitting over there,
lonely.

947
00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:53.240
I swear to God,

948
00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:56.570
looking like a dove look like in somebody killed the fucking dump.

949
00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:00.140
Because right there,
that one right there is 100% all natural.

950
00:59:00.141 --> 00:59:04.660
Nothing's wrong with it.
And I was like,
I was like,
what?

951
00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.760
That's what a chicken is supposed to look like.

952
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:11.270
And he raised his eyebrows and he,

953
00:59:11.271 --> 00:59:14.810
he kind of put his lips together so they were straight line.
And then he nodded,

954
00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:17.210
you know,
that looked at people do like,

955
00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:22.050
<v 0>like,
yeah,
I'm in the Matrix.
I realize I'm in the Matrix,
you know,</v>

956
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.660
I knocked the bitch up so I got to be selling these,
wrote it up.
Chickens.
No.

957
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:32.680
Um,
anyways,
anyway,
what the fuck I'm talking about?

958
00:59:32.681 --> 00:59:36.070
So basically that's what these people are eating over there.
Okay.
They are,

959
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:40.270
they are drug and up
the kids,

960
00:59:40.271 --> 00:59:45.271
but I can't get mad at him because I actually did that to Charlie Murphy and a

961
00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:49.030
Don l Rawlings.
I've told this story before,
Hey,

962
00:59:49.031 --> 00:59:50.920
I'll tell it against my fucking podcast.

963
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:54.790
I actually drug I the exact thing that they're doing in that Kentucky Fried

964
00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:56.560
Chicken commercial with it,

965
00:59:56.561 --> 01:00:01.540
trying to get the kids to sit still by just feeding him so full of these fucking

966
01:00:01.541 --> 01:00:06.541
trans fats from these Roy up beatless fucking chickens with the Dolly Parton

967
01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.710
breast diseases.
Right.

968
01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:13.990
I did that to fucking Donnelle and Charlie,

969
01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:19.590
I was hung over and we've taken a car service from Chicago xannies up to one of

970
01:00:20.171 --> 01:00:24.430
those whenever the fuck it was
Saint Charles,

971
01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.630
it was a three city run
and one of them was Saint Charles.

972
01:00:29.631 --> 01:00:33.560
So we're getting in the fucking Limo,
Don L's in rare form.

973
01:00:33.561 --> 01:00:34.670
Charlie's in rare form.

974
01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:39.050
They're fucking Gavin and trash and people and me and everybody and I just don't

975
01:00:39.051 --> 01:00:40.430
want to hear it.
I'm like,

976
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:44.570
I don't want to listen to these fucking guys running that Goddamn yaps in the

977
01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:48.050
back of this car the whole fucking way up.
I want a nice quiet ride.

978
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:50.930
This is going to suck.
And I walked outside,

979
01:00:50.931 --> 01:00:54.710
hung over and I walked into the Chicago where,
you know,

980
01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:58.430
almost got hit by three fat people.
And,
um,

981
01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:04.460
I looked up to street and I saw it,
I saw a Popeye's and I was like,

982
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:05.330
oh,
thank God.

983
01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:10.760
And I fucking walked in there and I got all this fucking Popeye's chicken with

984
01:01:10.761 --> 01:01:13.760
biscuits and all of this shit food.

985
01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.290
And I brought it back to the car and as the car pulled up,

986
01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:22.850
they came out and I say,
guys,
I got to sell some.
I got some food.
And they like,

987
01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.340
ah,
it's fucking great.
You know,
they were hungry or whatever.

988
01:01:25.341 --> 01:01:30.290
And they started showering that fucking Popeye's food and I sat back,

989
01:01:30.291 --> 01:01:31.730
nibbling on a drum stick

990
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:39.860
and I swear to God,
10 minutes later they were asleep.

991
01:01:40.550 --> 01:01:43.370
I'm not lying to you.
They were fucking asleep,

992
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.630
snoring the whole way up.
And I was just sitting there loving life,

993
01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.870
the whole fucking write up.
And I,
you know what,
I admitted to him later,

994
01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:55.310
they thought it was funny,
but that's basic what it is.
They called it the Itis,

995
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:59.570
that's what they call it when you eat that shit food and then you have to go to

996
01:01:59.571 --> 01:02:03.950
sleep,
they call it the Itis,
I guess.
And by they,
I meet African Americans.

997
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.480
Um,
they call it the fucking Itus and that's what they got.

998
01:02:08.481 --> 01:02:13.481
And the F and I learned that from Don l because I don't know how that man stayed

999
01:02:14.541 --> 01:02:16.490
in shape,
but he had the worst diet.

1000
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.400
He's one of those guys who like you stopped for gas and he comes out of the gas

1001
01:02:20.401 --> 01:02:23.490
station with like one of those gas station hot dogs.

1002
01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.310
And he would eat it and then he would immediately fall asleep.
And I,

1003
01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:35.230
and I would say to Charlie,
look at this guy,
he's sleeping and chat and be like,

1004
01:02:35.231 --> 01:02:37.420
yeah man,
he got the itis me.

1005
01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:40.060
Explain that to me and what that little bit of information,

1006
01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:46.380
it went into my evil white brain and I drug my two African American friends way

1007
01:02:47.921 --> 01:02:51.580
back in the year 2005.
Um,

1008
01:02:51.581 --> 01:02:54.220
and that's a little chicken story for you.
What time did you like that?
Everybody.

1009
01:02:55.690 --> 01:02:57.460
So that's what the fuck they're saying right there.

1010
01:02:57.461 --> 01:03:00.700
That's what Kentucky Fried Chicken is allegedly saying.

1011
01:03:00.701 --> 01:03:02.080
I guess they have to say a legend.

1012
01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:08.520
So their lawyers on retainer don't attack my fucking podcast as far as I can

1013
01:03:09.461 --> 01:03:12.120
tell.
I'm asking you right now,
uh,

1014
01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:16.870
Kentucky Fried Chicken hiding behind your fucking letters,
KFC.

1015
01:03:16.871 --> 01:03:18.730
Is that what the fuck you do?
Is that what you're saying?

1016
01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:26.050
If you've got kids who are not stimulated enough that they can't even sit down,

1017
01:03:26.401 --> 01:03:30.960
if you have a Reia of running around,
you got to tie your kids out,

1018
01:03:30.961 --> 01:03:34.320
opened the door.
You send them out in the fucking yard.
God,
God side,

1019
01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:37.080
get outside and play.
That's what you do.

1020
01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:40.080
Like a God damn one of those fucking Irish dogs.

1021
01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:42.390
It was bread dip too to herd sheep.

1022
01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:46.610
You've got to let that fucking thing run around.
Run around in circles.
Guy,

1023
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:50.310
get out there,
take a ball.
You just fucking throw it out and traffic.

1024
01:03:50.311 --> 01:03:54.750
Let the dog run around.
Dodgy cars.
It comes in,
it's going to lay down.
Okay?

1025
01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.570
It's not going to jump all over.
Company stick and it's cold nose,

1026
01:03:57.571 --> 01:04:01.080
right in their fucking who has.
That's what you got to do with your kids.

1027
01:04:01.081 --> 01:04:03.540
You've got to send them upside,
right?

1028
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:07.530
But to catch a Predator and all these other fucking shows,
you know,

1029
01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:11.370
all these shows on TV where people forget that kids are in a car with the

1030
01:04:11.371 --> 01:04:15.540
windows rolled up and the kids are too fucking dumb to roll them down or they're

1031
01:04:15.541 --> 01:04:18.840
too weak because they haven't gone outside and climb to fucking tree and they

1032
01:04:18.841 --> 01:04:23.670
stay in there and then their,
their brains get cooked like a boxer,
you know?

1033
01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.420
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1034
01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:27.810
<v 0>You know that dog boxes,
they don't,
they don't do well in the sun.
Well,</v>

1035
01:04:27.811 --> 01:04:31.410
we'll need to do fat kids.
If you leave the windows rolled up,
you know,

1036
01:04:31.411 --> 01:04:35.280
and they got those weak arms that all of that think the most tedious things they

1037
01:04:35.281 --> 01:04:38.750
ever did was take a wrapper off of a fucking,
uh,

1038
01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:43.530
an ice cream sandwich.
Right.
You can't leave them in the car.

1039
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:48.840
My mother left us in the car all the fucking time.
She would go to school.

1040
01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:53.070
She was going to school during the day trying to further her education and she

1041
01:04:53.071 --> 01:04:57.600
left five fucking kids in the car with the windows rolled up and money for

1042
01:04:57.601 --> 01:05:00.480
Burger King.
And she would say to us,
just go into the Burger.

1043
01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:04.860
That's the only time you were to leave this car overlay over the next three

1044
01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.560
fucking hours when I'm in class.

1045
01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.490
And she would disappear around the corner after we set.
Absolutely.

1046
01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:14.640
Mom and she walked away.
Ed.
Uh,

1047
01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.500
we immediately would get out of the car,

1048
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.580
start walking up and down the streets in Boston.

1049
01:05:19.490 --> 01:05:19.870
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1050
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:22.840
<v 0>We go into fucking burger king and we,
we'd have some to eat.</v>

1051
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.350
Do you know what would happen nowadays if they just saw five fucking dirty face

1052
01:05:26.351 --> 01:05:27.460
kids walking up and down,

1053
01:05:27.461 --> 01:05:32.461
calm AV Boylston street going into a burger king looking like the cast to

1054
01:05:33.021 --> 01:05:33.854
fucking Annie.

1055
01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:35.080
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1056
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.480
<v 0>Someone would have filmed it and my mother would have been in,</v>

1057
01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:38.800
they would have taken us away,

1058
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.120
<v 3>you know,
but,
but they didn't</v>

1059
01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.950
<v 0>cause there was no cameras back then or videotape ones.
I mean there was,</v>

1060
01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:48.500
but only people add them on like the news.

1061
01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:49.960
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1062
01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:54.220
<v 0>And a young Steven Spielberg.
So we went in there and we fucking got some food,</v>

1063
01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:58.300
climbed on cars and fucking yelled at people and Shit.

1064
01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:03.080
Ditto hanging on Platt parking meters.
And all that.
Hence,

1065
01:06:03.081 --> 01:06:07.130
we had the fucking forearm strength to roll down the windows and none of us ever

1066
01:06:07.131 --> 01:06:09.860
had an issue in the car.
And you know what?

1067
01:06:09.861 --> 01:06:13.010
I think that's one to grow on today.
You go people,

1068
01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:17.270
I'm not saying KFC is food.
I'm not,
I'm just kidding.

1069
01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:20.120
I'm not saying it's bad food.
Every once in a while who's kitten home?

1070
01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:21.530
He wants to,
we don't go anywhere.
Be Great.

1071
01:06:21.531 --> 01:06:24.440
If he could just fucking do heroin the way you can eat Mcdonald's,

1072
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:29.000
just like every once in a while he'd just be like,
you know what?
Yeah,

1073
01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:31.310
let's just fucking tie off.

1074
01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:36.770
Not off for the rest of the fucking day in like the people at work understood
it.

1075
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:38.070
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1076
01:06:38.070 --> 01:06:40.180
<v 0>You know?
Hey,
where were you yesterday on?
Yeah,</v>

1077
01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.330
I got this black tar heroin came in.
You know,

1078
01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:46.920
I hadn't done it like three months away.
Figured fuck it.
Oh,

1079
01:06:46.921 --> 01:06:48.630
is that what you did?
How was it?
How was it?
You know,

1080
01:06:48.631 --> 01:06:51.180
like you're like you went to Aruba,
you said,
oh,
I've towed.
It was awesome.

1081
01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:57.390
<v 5>I don't remember shit.
You know,</v>

1082
01:06:57.391 --> 01:07:02.391
he'd get a dick.

1083
01:07:58.810 --> 01:07:59.643
That's fine.

1084
01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:09.050
<v 0>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

1085
01:08:09.051 --> 01:08:13.220
It's Belper and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

1086
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:15.860
July 12th,
2010

1087
01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:17.603
<v 1>all la.</v>

1088
01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:25.950
I'm sorry.
I was really going to act like I could speak Spanish there.
Oh,

1089
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:30.910
allow yo soy comical and anemia.

1090
01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:34.270
Maybe Litchi
ornaments.

1091
01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:38.290
Santa's bent alone is Una COMESA.

1092
01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.350
I actually,
if you can't tell,

1093
01:08:41.351 --> 01:08:46.090
I've actually finally broken open my Rosetta stone that I got for Christmas two

1094
01:08:46.091 --> 01:08:50.050
and a half fucking years ago or whatever it is.
Yeah,

1095
01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.790
I got it for a year and a half ago.

1096
01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:55.900
December of 2008 I got a the Rosetta stone.

1097
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:59.560
Oh God.
Okay.

1098
01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:04.850
Black or Negro Roho um,
I,
I got it,
dude.

1099
01:09:04.851 --> 01:09:08.570
It's the shit.
It's a shit.
I'm going to be fluent in Spanish.

1100
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:11.480
I've always wanted to learn another language and I ain't trying to immerse

1101
01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:14.140
myself.
That's what I'm trying to do.

1102
01:09:14.141 --> 01:09:17.320
I'm trying to immerse myself in the language.
I'm listening to it on the radio.

1103
01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:22.320
I'm also listening to it.
Uh,
you know,

1104
01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:25.950
I'm listening to shit like this on a,
on my iTunes,

1105
01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:29.140
hoping I can pick up some shit.
You know you got to,

1106
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:32.310
you got to immerse yourself in the shit.
You got to listen to stuff like this.

1107
01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:45.740
A fucking great.

1108
01:09:45.741 --> 01:09:50.741
Is that got to have a fucking be able to fucking know what that means.

1109
01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:55.910
Sing that have pigment in my chest so I can actually wear that open.

1110
01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:58.850
I'm going to go stab a bull Latino shirt.

1111
01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:02.410
How much pussy would you get if he could fucking,
it's just unbelievable.

1112
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:05.760
It's half the shit that they say.

1113
01:10:05.761 --> 01:10:10.761
It sounds like fucking dirty talk when you're banging a girl in a neat pivot.

1114
01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.650
Litchi that means the girl is drinking them is drinking milk.

1115
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.710
There's no way to say that without just sounding like you're fucking,

1116
01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.830
it'll Ninette a bib and itchy.
Hey,
next time you guys are banging your girl.

1117
01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:28.840
Okay,
you got a Doggie style.
Just leaned down in her ear and just feel like,
ah,

1118
01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:31.330
maybe I need your vivid,
itchy.

1119
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.320
Should we even have an orgasm or a fucking world around an elbow when you win

1120
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:42.260
you in the face?
Either way.
Either way,
it's going to be funny,

1121
01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:48.150
but I want to be fluent in that shit.
And uh,
I'm liking Rosetta stone.

1122
01:10:48.690 --> 01:10:52.770
I really like it.
You sit there and you put on like a,
a bill,
Bellamy,

1123
01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:57.210
Janet Jackson Sorta headset,
you know,
and uh,

1124
01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:00.980
okay.
You put on some stretchy pants and then you put,

1125
01:11:00.981 --> 01:11:04.220
you put in the fucking CD Rom or whatever the hell it is.
And then they just,

1126
01:11:04.221 --> 01:11:08.260
they just start speaking to you like you're a baby sitting in the crib.

1127
01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.240
That's exactly what it is.

1128
01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:16.010
Two very stereotypical Mexican looking faces just sort of peer into the screen,

1129
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:20.880
like you're laying in the crib and then they just start speaking to you and they

1130
01:11:20.881 --> 01:11:24.030
tickle your tummy.
It's,
it's tremendous.
It's a tremendous,

1131
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:29.400
it's a tremendous way to numb.
I'm just fucking around dude.
It's awesome.
It's a,

1132
01:11:29.401 --> 01:11:31.500
if you were ever thinking about doing it,
like,
you know,

1133
01:11:31.501 --> 01:11:34.230
I always wanted to learn to speak a different language.

1134
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.820
Whenever I ride the subway,

1135
01:11:35.821 --> 01:11:39.630
I was nervous that Puerto Rican were actually calling me bad words.

1136
01:11:39.631 --> 01:11:44.190
What does [inaudible] mean?
Um,
is that even Puerto Rican?

1137
01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.500
This is what's killing me.
This is how fucking what I am.

1138
01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:48.990
I actually believe that I'm going to learn this shit.

1139
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:54.220
El Nina Bibby Litchi I'm going to learn this shit and uh,

1140
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:59.460
therefore I will be able to go to Mexico,
Cuba,
Puerto Rico,

1141
01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:03.990
Brazil or whatever,
and be able to understand every motherfucker out there,

1142
01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:10.160
even though people I know this dude who is Cuban and he tells me it's,

1143
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:14.190
it's really different.
Not totally different,
but I mean,
I dunno,

1144
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.720
he seemed a little peeved when I was like,
yeah,
and I can go to fucking Cuba.

1145
01:12:18.721 --> 01:12:22.230
I can go to Dominican Republic.
It's not the fucking same thing.

1146
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:25.680
All right,
sorry.
You know when it's one of those things,

1147
01:12:25.681 --> 01:12:29.450
I'm not even trying to be offensive and I offended you,
but it's like,
you know,

1148
01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.860
do you think when I go to Ireland or I went to,
went to Scotland,

1149
01:12:31.861 --> 01:12:34.740
I can understand those fuckers,
everything that they said,

1150
01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:35.940
but I knew what they were saying.

1151
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:43.370
Am I being ignorant right here?
Do you guys,
is it a complete,

1152
01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:47.940
it's not a completely different language.
Ah,
they'll,

1153
01:12:47.941 --> 01:12:49.920
Nina baby Lecce you can't say that.

1154
01:12:49.921 --> 01:12:52.800
And fucking Cuba and they won't know what you're talking about.

1155
01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:57.600
Is that because it calmed me communism?
You know,

1156
01:12:57.601 --> 01:13:01.440
I already stopped this podcast and started it again because I'm doing this

1157
01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.090
Sunday morning.
My fucking brain isn't awake yet.

1158
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:08.160
Stuttering like a goddamn jackass.
Uh,

1159
01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:13.460
pantaloneys spot dose will not come Isa.

1160
01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:19.740
I can't fucking wait.
I can't wait the first time somebody from uh,

1161
01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.680
I was going to say somebody from another language.
That's how dumb I am.

1162
01:13:22.681 --> 01:13:26.610
Somebody speaking Spanish talk shit about me because I'll tell you right now,

1163
01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:30.420
I would fucking do it all the time.
I would do it all the God damn time.

1164
01:13:30.421 --> 01:13:34.410
If English was a second language was not the main language of this country.

1165
01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.800
And I had another English speaking French I and,

1166
01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:41.700
and I was walking around people who did not understand English and it would be

1167
01:13:41.701 --> 01:13:44.850
our own little private language.
I would be shitting on people,

1168
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.150
right and left perverted stuff.
Can you imagine that?

1169
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:52.890
If nobody understood English,
everybody just spoke Spanish,
right?

1170
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:54.300
Your boss,
some can't.

1171
01:13:54.301 --> 01:13:57.480
But she's got a nice rack and you sit in there and she can literally walk by and

1172
01:13:57.481 --> 01:13:58.470
like,
dude,
I would tit,

1173
01:13:58.471 --> 01:14:03.260
fuck this bitch right on a God damn desk and then turn around me all La,

1174
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:04.890
me boss.
Ah,
you know,

1175
01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:12.400
no wonder they're so fucking laid back.
They can get it out.
I got to sit,

1176
01:14:12.401 --> 01:14:16.150
I got to sit on all this goddamn rage because I don't have some secret fucking

1177
01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:19.840
language.
All right.
All right.
Mexicans.

1178
01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.780
I mean you fucking hide out and I'm breaking down your code.

1179
01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:28.170
So I'm telling you this time next year,
you better watch your tongue.
Okay,
good.

1180
01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:34.450
Only I could turn learning in another language seat.
See you hear me stuttering.

1181
01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:39.190
It's in the morning.
Only I could turn speaking another language.
Am I only,

1182
01:14:39.191 --> 01:14:41.350
I could turn a love of language,

1183
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:45.860
relax Mexico.
Just relax.

1184
01:14:45.861 --> 01:14:49.570
Just really listened to a couple of my podcasts and realize how fucking stupid I

1185
01:14:49.571 --> 01:14:54.010
am and also how I get totally psycho into something for about 10 days.

1186
01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:59.220
And then I just walk away from it and then it just sits there gathering dust on

1187
01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:03.760
my desk.
Anyways,

1188
01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:09.070
so it was a big week this weekend in sports.
It's actually,
uh,
what time is it?

1189
01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:13.450
Right now it's 10 43 and this is the funny thing.
In 17 minutes,

1190
01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.840
the World Cup final is starting,

1191
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:20.500
which is basically the championship,

1192
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:23.140
one of the true championships of the world.

1193
01:15:23.141 --> 01:15:25.060
It's the entire world competes for it.

1194
01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:28.960
And as big a fucking sports fan as I am,

1195
01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.000
I could give a shit.

1196
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:37.110
The only thing that I would find less interesting than the World Cup final was

1197
01:15:38.471 --> 01:15:42.100
the Lebron James Hour long press conference to announce what team he's going to

1198
01:15:42.101 --> 01:15:45.220
fucking go to.
You know?
That's actually bullshit.

1199
01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:47.680
I totally respect the game of soccer.
It just,

1200
01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:50.500
it fucking bores the shit out of me.
And A,

1201
01:15:50.501 --> 01:15:54.010
we have a number of soccer fans on here and they send me emails and they get mad

1202
01:15:54.011 --> 01:15:58.420
at me.
They say,
it says,
Dear Bill Dude,

1203
01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.120
until you have a better understanding of the game,

1204
01:16:01.121 --> 01:16:03.220
you got to stop ragging on soccer.

1205
01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:07.510
Find someone that knows a little bit about the game and take some fucking time

1206
01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:12.340
and watch a couple of games.
Dude watch the World Cup finals.

1207
01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:17.440
Uh,
exclamation point.
Why?
Cause you fucking say so.
Um,

1208
01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:21.040
do you realize that if you added up everyone that watched the NFL,
the NBA,

1209
01:16:21.041 --> 01:16:22.690
the Nhl and MLB,

1210
01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:26.860
you would only have about half as many people that watch soccer.
Dude,

1211
01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:27.730
do you realize that?

1212
01:16:27.731 --> 01:16:31.270
I'm not so fucking stupid that I don't realize that you just pulled that stat

1213
01:16:31.271 --> 01:16:34.420
out of your ass.
Give me some numbers you didn't.

1214
01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:38.650
You said you would have about path is made about really?
Yeah.

1215
01:16:38.651 --> 01:16:43.120
You're going to guesstimate there.
Put that in your pipe and smoke it bill.

1216
01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:45.790
Thanks dude.
All right.
This is the deal.
All right.

1217
01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:48.310
I'm so sick of these fucking soccer cons.

1218
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:53.440
Trying to convince me that it's an,
an exciting sport.

1219
01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.140
Do you think that I haven't sat down and watched it

1220
01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.970
earlier this year when I watched the Olympics,
I got into curling.

1221
01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:05.170
I was watching the cross country skiing.
Will you shoot the gun?

1222
01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:09.070
I'm very open minded when it comes to sports.
Okay.

1223
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.390
But to sit there and killed two,

1224
01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:15.800
three fucking hours of my day to watch a zero to zero fucking game.

1225
01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:20.690
And watching these guys flop around like a bunch of Goddamn Pau Gasol every 10

1226
01:17:20.691 --> 01:17:24.140
fucking minutes.
It's,
it's,
I tried,
dude,

1227
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:29.090
I tried it just because the whole fucking world is watching the sport.

1228
01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.750
Does it mean that I should?
All right.

1229
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:37.100
The whole world was where an acid wash jeans and the life fucking eighties I

1230
01:17:37.101 --> 01:17:41.510
followed that trend and I got the embarrassing God damn pictures to prove it.

1231
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:45.740
Where the fuck did that get me?
You know what I like about soccer?

1232
01:17:45.741 --> 01:17:48.080
I like the highlights,
the highlights,
you know,

1233
01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:51.440
and they show it in slow motion motion.
Absolutely gorgeous sport to watch.

1234
01:17:51.441 --> 01:17:54.140
But to sit there for fucking two hours listening to those,

1235
01:17:54.141 --> 01:17:57.170
God damn mosquito horns,
you,
you're really asking too much.

1236
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:02.780
All right,
everybody flopping around like a bunch of God damn fucking girls.

1237
01:18:03.650 --> 01:18:06.530
Get off the goddamn ground.
Fucking pussies.

1238
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.430
The guy doesn't even touch you and you flop around on the ground.

1239
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:15.440
It's so a feminine.
That's what I can't stand about that sport.
You know,

1240
01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:18.140
this guy did bring up a good point.
He goes,

1241
01:18:18.141 --> 01:18:20.870
you're telling me the basketball players.
Yes,
basketball players do.

1242
01:18:20.871 --> 01:18:25.220
Basketball is a very fucking a feminine sport when it comes to that shit,

1243
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:31.010
that fake fucking flopping around.
Yeah,

1244
01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.680
no other,
you know,
that's the closest thing.
I'm trying to think.

1245
01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.690
There's a couple of guys in the NHL,
look,

1246
01:18:35.691 --> 01:18:39.110
there's always going to be a couple of broads in every sport,
you know,

1247
01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:43.160
but at least in,
in,
in the NHL soccer fan,
you know what they have,

1248
01:18:43.161 --> 01:18:46.850
they have a penalty for pretending that somebody hit you two minutes.
You get,

1249
01:18:46.851 --> 01:18:49.160
it's called diving.
Two minutes for diving,

1250
01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:52.430
get up you fag and getting a goddamn penalty box.

1251
01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:00.260
I was,
I dunno,
I,
I,
dude,
I tried.
I fucking tried.
I tried to watch the shit.

1252
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:02.630
I don't give a fuck.
Um,

1253
01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:06.530
I find the Premiere League way more enjoyable to watch.

1254
01:19:06.531 --> 01:19:09.740
I can watch that game,
but I got to tell you like,
I don't know what it is.

1255
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:13.490
I start to get a headache and I get a little bit of a stomach ache when I'm

1256
01:19:13.491 --> 01:19:18.491
watching it because the amount of effort that I have to put in to you know,

1257
01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:20.391
do,

1258
01:19:20.391 --> 01:19:25.310
to sit there and in two hours of your fucking life to watch a one to nothing

1259
01:19:25.311 --> 01:19:27.890
game.
That's why,
you know,

1260
01:19:27.891 --> 01:19:31.130
so I think I finally figured out why they fight in Nhl Hockey.

1261
01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:35.450
Cause you can actually have a one to nothing fucking games.
So you know,

1262
01:19:35.451 --> 01:19:40.100
then you basically have guys going,
it's legal to smash somebody's,
you know,

1263
01:19:40.101 --> 01:19:43.130
against the boards.
You can drop the gloves,
he could fight.

1264
01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:47.660
There's a lot of other exciting things that do happen.
All right?

1265
01:19:47.661 --> 01:19:50.030
But to sit there for two fucking hours.

1266
01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.640
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Ah,
yeah,
yeah,

1267
01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:59.570
yeah.
Ooh.

1268
01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:04.700
Oh it's the sports equivalent to fucking blue balls.

1269
01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:10.230
I don't fucking it.
I really don't.
I just don't.
I don't like it.

1270
01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:12.480
I don't fucking like it.
Okay.

1271
01:20:12.481 --> 01:20:15.480
And you can't make me fucking like it because the whole world likes it.

1272
01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:19.710
All right.
There's,
this is a major part of the fucking world.

1273
01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.960
Did you know they,

1274
01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.260
they take out a high grade piece of sandpaper and then they,
they,

1275
01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:27.030
they rubbed the girl's fucking clicks off.

1276
01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:30.060
Does it doesn't mean that I think it's right.
Wow.
That was really disgusting.

1277
01:20:30.061 --> 01:20:34.620
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
12 minutes into the podcast,
getting that fucking gross.

1278
01:20:34.621 --> 01:20:39.390
I should have saved that towards the end for the diehard fans.
Um,

1279
01:20:39.391 --> 01:20:42.600
so anyways,
dad,
that Lebron James Announcement,
um,

1280
01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:46.820
speaking of mind numbingly boring.
Um,

1281
01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:50.810
oh,
this is not,
think about fucking soccer.
Like I'm invited to this,
this,

1282
01:20:50.811 --> 01:20:55.811
this party where they're going to watch the finals and whenever you find a

1283
01:20:57.391 --> 01:21:00.500
person who's really into soccer,
you know,
yeah,

1284
01:21:00.501 --> 01:21:02.850
they always get like their little soccer shirt on.

1285
01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:06.390
They always have like these little fucking wimpy torsos.

1286
01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:09.950
If you notice that it was the last time you saw somebody jacked that was into

1287
01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.470
fucking soccer,
you don't always have like those little fucking,

1288
01:21:13.471 --> 01:21:18.420
those little European torsos,
you know,
you little seventh grade bodies.

1289
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.680
It does anybody lift weights or do pushups or anything in fucking Europe?

1290
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:23.851
Do you just,

1291
01:21:23.851 --> 01:21:28.620
you just take the torso God gave you and then you just start stuffing fish and

1292
01:21:28.621 --> 01:21:33.621
chips down your fucking throat and you just let it all sort of slide down until

1293
01:21:34.801 --> 01:21:38.520
you look like Jethro Tull.
Um,
all right.

1294
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:41.430
I think I've tried that shit enough.
Let's trash in American sports.

1295
01:21:41.431 --> 01:21:45.810
Let's talk about fucking Lebron James and his fucking,

1296
01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:49.980
first of all,
his howdy doody puppets shirt that he wore.
You know,

1297
01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:53.760
there really is this theory out there that black guys are so cool that they

1298
01:21:53.761 --> 01:21:56.790
really can wear any type of clothing and make it look good.
Well,

1299
01:21:56.820 --> 01:22:01.650
that was an example of when it doesn't quite always work.
I mean,
that was a,

1300
01:22:01.651 --> 01:22:02.760
I don't know what that was,

1301
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:07.080
that it looked like he was going to go sing on the Grand Ole Opry in like 1948.

1302
01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:12.270
Um,
all right,
the fuck am I talking about?

1303
01:22:12.271 --> 01:22:14.470
Let's get into this whole podcast thing.
All right.
Uh,

1304
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:18.690
the Lebron James one hour announcement for everybody out there who's saying how

1305
01:22:18.691 --> 01:22:23.040
fucking lame it was,
um,
you know who's fault that is?

1306
01:22:23.041 --> 01:22:24.570
It's your own God damn fault.

1307
01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:29.100
It's your own fucking fault for sitting there and watching it.
Okay.

1308
01:22:29.101 --> 01:22:33.150
It's not like ESPN lied.
They told you what it was going to be.

1309
01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:38.930
This is going to be a one hour special of an athlete announcing which team he's

1310
01:22:39.811 --> 01:22:43.470
going to go fucking play for.
I mean,
how long should that realistically take?

1311
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:47.760
It's like the fucking Oscars.
How long should it take to be and to,

1312
01:22:47.770 --> 01:22:49.740
to take to just fucking be like,

1313
01:22:49.741 --> 01:22:53.400
and the Oscar goes to Sean Connery

1314
01:22:55.050 --> 01:23:00.050
and the Oscar for the best fucking dress in a period piece goes to Claire.

1315
01:23:00.151 --> 01:23:01.440
Big Billingsley

1316
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:08.080
bill billings leak clear Billingsley fucking Douche bag bill burn.

1317
01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:11.560
Not even fucking awake trying to do a podcast to get it out of the Goddamn way

1318
01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:15.610
to go to some stupid ass fucking party that's showing the finals of a sport that

1319
01:23:15.611 --> 01:23:20.050
he doesn't give a fuck about.
That starts in nine minutes.

1320
01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:24.220
Oh my God.
Somebody hit fucking record.
Um,

1321
01:23:25.210 --> 01:23:28.330
yeah.
I mean,
you know what the fuck it was going to be.
Why did you even watch it?

1322
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:30.490
I mean,
can't you tell that that guy,

1323
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:35.200
that guy just got some fucking horrific and he just got horrific advice from his

1324
01:23:35.201 --> 01:23:37.420
people around him who they were just like,

1325
01:23:37.421 --> 01:23:42.220
we're going to create the biggest media stir ever.
All right,

1326
01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:45.670
we'll go to Chicago first.
We'll gain some interest.
We'll go to the Knicks,

1327
01:23:45.671 --> 01:23:48.610
we'll get some interest there.
We'll go down and fuck man.
Oh,

1328
01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:51.250
where the fuck is he going to?
Who gives a shit?

1329
01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:57.700
Nobody cares except the people in those fucking touts.
I got to tell you,

1330
01:23:57.701 --> 01:24:00.370
I really did enjoy him.
Fucking,
you know,

1331
01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:05.260
terror in the hearts on a Knicks fans because as always,

1332
01:24:05.261 --> 01:24:08.950
New York fans are the most fucking dislike a,

1333
01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:15.250
that's the sense of entitlement that fans of New York sports have just because

1334
01:24:15.251 --> 01:24:16.630
they live in New York City.

1335
01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:21.190
If I have to watch one more fucking asshole on TV,

1336
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:26.020
talk about the big stage in New York.
Okay.
Overrated.

1337
01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:29.680
Underrated for this week.
Overrated.
The big stage in New York,

1338
01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:34.840
there's only one big stage in New York.
It's in fucking Yankee stadium.

1339
01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:40.480
That's the only big stage that is in New York.
27 championships.
You go there,

1340
01:24:40.570 --> 01:24:42.100
there is pressure to win.

1341
01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.890
What does his big like when Lebron didn't pick fucking New York?
I'm on,

1342
01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:51.670
you know I'm online and I read three comments and I'm like,
there you go.

1343
01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:53.530
That's enough evidence for me.

1344
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:56.500
I'm going to judge every new fan in New York right now.

1345
01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:00.140
They were all sitting there going like,
oh,
he was afraid of the,
the,

1346
01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.150
the bright lights.
He couldn't handle the big stage of New York.

1347
01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:06.430
Let me ask you this,
Nick fans,

1348
01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:11.640
where is the big fucking stage for professional basketball in New York City?

1349
01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.810
Madison Square Garden,
that place,

1350
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.370
the biggest thing that happens in Madison Square Garden every year is Elton John

1351
01:25:21.371 --> 01:25:26.140
comes there and sell.
He fucking sells out 20 shows.
You know

1352
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:31.660
Bruce Springsteen comes there and sings his songs about New Jersey.

1353
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:34.750
The circus comes once a fucking year.

1354
01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:39.490
Those are the biggest days every year.
And Madison Square Garden.

1355
01:25:40.090 --> 01:25:42.550
All right,
and in case you don't know what I'm talking about,

1356
01:25:42.551 --> 01:25:47.551
next time you go there and there's yet another horrific played but made by

1357
01:25:47.651 --> 01:25:52.420
either the fucking rangers or the Knicks and you look up and discussed to that,

1358
01:25:52.421 --> 01:25:55.300
to the sports gods,
like what the fuck?

1359
01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:59.710
When you're done praying for some messiah to come in there and save those two

1360
01:25:59.711 --> 01:26:02.710
pathetic fucking franchises,
look up at the ceiling

1361
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:05.750
and tell me what you see.

1362
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:10.970
A striking lack of championship fucking banners.

1363
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:13.400
I'll even give you the God damn answers.
You'd dumb fucks.

1364
01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:19.900
There is no big stage and it's so fucking disrespectful of everybody to say that

1365
01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.750
all the fucking time.
Talking about Amy,

1366
01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:27.270
you know when they talk about the biggest stage in,
in,

1367
01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:31.160
in major major league baseball team.
What did they say?
Fenway Park.

1368
01:26:31.190 --> 01:26:34.130
How about Saint Louis?
Say they got,

1369
01:26:34.131 --> 01:26:37.250
they got 10 fucking world series titles.

1370
01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.120
That's not even a good example.

1371
01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:45.260
It's not like the Knicks are in second place with titles.
Dude,

1372
01:26:45.261 --> 01:26:50.060
Yankee stadium is the big stage and made major league baseball.
Okay?

1373
01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:55.520
The fucking Celtics have 17 NBA championships that we're all one in Boston.

1374
01:26:56.810 --> 01:26:59.060
All right.
The Los Angeles Lakers,

1375
01:26:59.061 --> 01:27:04.040
11 titles have been one there a once a year they hold hands with somebody from

1376
01:27:04.041 --> 01:27:06.140
Minnesota and they add the five that we're in.
That's,

1377
01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:07.160
that's the thing right there.

1378
01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.420
The Minneapolis Lakers have more titles than the fucking New York Knicks.

1379
01:27:11.421 --> 01:27:14.710
Do you guys understand that?
That a team that's dead,

1380
01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.920
dead fucking moved west.
All right.

1381
01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:24.040
That moved fucking West around the same time the Brooklyn Dodgers went out to la

1382
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:27.020
still has three more fucking titles than you do.

1383
01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:32.260
You don't have a big stage there and nobody is afraid to play in New York City

1384
01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:35.600
and there's certainly not afraid to play the fucking Knicks,

1385
01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:41.240
so get off your own dicks.
I'm sick of it.
All right.

1386
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:46.330
The jets having wanted since 69 the Knicks haven't worn it since 73 the mets

1387
01:27:46.491 --> 01:27:48.890
haven't won it since fucking 86

1388
01:27:51.230 --> 01:27:54.920
who else has left?
The giants are,
are a respectable franchise.

1389
01:27:54.921 --> 01:27:55.970
That's the best you have.

1390
01:27:56.090 --> 01:28:00.710
You have a respectable franchise that is one the same amount of super bowls as

1391
01:28:00.711 --> 01:28:04.520
the Patriots,
the packers,
the Redskins,
and the Raiders.

1392
01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:08.870
The giants are in the middle of the pack.
All right?

1393
01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.450
There's no big fucking stage.

1394
01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:14.630
And they sit there and they act like these sports writers in New York,

1395
01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:17.450
these fat mantated jackasses,

1396
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:22.750
these fill mushed nics are going intimidate a guy at the level of fucking Lebron

1397
01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:25.160
James.
They're not.
I hate to tell it to you in New York.

1398
01:28:25.161 --> 01:28:28.790
The reason why he didn't go to Madison Square Garden is cause you suck.

1399
01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:32.270
That's why,
I mean think about that.

1400
01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.670
Who the fuck wouldn't want to go play in New York?

1401
01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:41.200
You know New York is the city is the Paris of fucking of America.

1402
01:28:42.141 --> 01:28:45.590
It's the best fucking city we have.
All right,

1403
01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:50.060
but just because there's a bunch of people outside of Madison Square Garden

1404
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:52.730
succeeding and doing some shit,

1405
01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:55.130
most of whom aren't even from New York by the way.

1406
01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:58.273
That's another thing.

1407
01:28:58.970 --> 01:29:02.130
New Yorkers think they're the shit just because live there just

1408
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:06.330
<v 0>because they're standing on the corner of fucking 52nd and third eaten a slice.</v>

1409
01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:11.530
<v 1>You know,
if I can get there,
I'll make an ad anywhere.</v>

1410
01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:16.360
<v 0>Are you really making it with your dirty fucking sneakers standing there outside</v>

1411
01:29:16.361 --> 01:29:19.030
of Tad's steaks.
You're not doing shit.

1412
01:29:19.090 --> 01:29:23.020
None of you are all you fucking pieces of Shit fucking gathering outside of

1413
01:29:23.021 --> 01:29:24.220
fucking port authority.

1414
01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.250
<v 1>That's another thing.
Oh Man,
I'm trashing the York this week.
I don't give a fuck.</v>

1415
01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:34.290
Listen me,
I don't give a fuck who bill.
Really?
You're being dangerous.

1416
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:38.550
It's dangerous to make
yeah,
alone.

1417
01:29:38.551 --> 01:29:42.030
Bray and a danger resold.
Um,

1418
01:29:43.730 --> 01:29:48.550
do Frank Sinatra's from New Jersey.
Okay.
He was bridge and tunnel.

1419
01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:50.450
The kindness,

1420
01:29:50.450 --> 01:29:54.020
the kind of guy that Paris Hilton wouldn't have fucked in one of her whore

1421
01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:57.860
nightclubs down there in the meat packing district.
If he came in and said,
oh,

1422
01:29:57.861 --> 01:29:58.880
I live in Hoboken,

1423
01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:02.710
she would have turned a little pointy nose up to the ceiling and walked away or

1424
01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:06.990
in a big fucking Sasquatch feet that she tries to hide.

1425
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:12.220
Bye Jack.
And a God damn fucking ass in the air to eye level.

1426
01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:18.200
No girls would have banged that guy.
But what did he do?
He came in there,

1427
01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:21.770
he came in there and he fucking sang a song and he took over your fucking city.

1428
01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:25.550
The way a bunch of people from other states that you fucking New Yorkers looked

1429
01:30:25.551 --> 01:30:28.080
down on.
We come in there all the time.

1430
01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:33.120
We come in there and we blow away half to fuck a talent in New York because you

1431
01:30:33.121 --> 01:30:35.520
guys are standing there eating a slice of pizza,

1432
01:30:35.521 --> 01:30:40.200
looking at the fucking empire state building going,
oh,
it's open all night.

1433
01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:44.480
You're not doing shit.
You don't have a big stage.

1434
01:30:44.481 --> 01:30:49.410
You have a sorry ass fucking NBA team.
You know this.

1435
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:52.090
How dumb the fucking nics are.
Isaiah Thomas,

1436
01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:57.720
there was a league called the CBA that did find for like 30 fucking years.

1437
01:30:57.721 --> 01:31:00.800
And then what's his face?
Isaiah Thomas.

1438
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:05.540
Thomas became president of the league and in life,
three,
four years.

1439
01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:10.120
I don't have the fucking stats.
I Dunno.
Five years it went out of business.

1440
01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:14.880
Okay.
I'm not talking about,
you know,

1441
01:31:14.881 --> 01:31:17.460
a winning franchise went to a losing franchise.

1442
01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:21.980
I'm not talking about a franchise that existed in a city,

1443
01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:25.100
had to move.
I'm not even saying the franchise folded.

1444
01:31:25.101 --> 01:31:28.310
I'm talking about an entire fucking league.

1445
01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:31.460
He got it to controls.

1446
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:36.290
He pushed the yolk forward and just flew the shit right into the goddamn ground.

1447
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:40.160
All right?
And like bugs bunny.

1448
01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:45.250
He stepped out right before it hit the ground before any of it got on him.

1449
01:31:45.330 --> 01:31:47.760
And then the next go.
Yet that's our guy.

1450
01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:53.380
That's the guy we're going to get to run the fucking NBA franchise.

1451
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:58.870
The guy who fucking flew bootleg NBA,

1452
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:02.970
the Goddamn ground.
That's the fucking dude.
See,
that's why Lebron didn't come.

1453
01:32:02.971 --> 01:32:04.800
Not because he's afraid of the big stage.

1454
01:32:04.890 --> 01:32:07.440
You want to know who's afraid of the big stage?
Jeff Weaver.

1455
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:10.430
Jeff Weaver was afraid of the big stage.
Okay?

1456
01:32:10.431 --> 01:32:14.200
But Lebron James is not afraid of the big at the big stage.
Okay?

1457
01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:20.750
He could fucking put his nuts on Jeff weavers chest and hold them down in the

1458
01:32:20.751 --> 01:32:22.790
deep end of a fucking pool.
All right?

1459
01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:25.130
He's not afraid of fucking Madison Square Garden.

1460
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:28.100
<v 0>And I also thought it was really fucking ironic</v>

1461
01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:31.750
<v 1>that of the three emails that I read by New Yorkers,</v>

1462
01:32:31.751 --> 01:32:35.590
which I'm now judging all of them,
they were going like,
you know,
Miami.

1463
01:32:35.591 --> 01:32:40.100
That's Dwayne Wade's town.
If he goes down there and wins a championship there,

1464
01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:41.690
nobody's going to respect him.

1465
01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:47.420
<v 0>Can you fucking believe a New Yorker had the balls to say that with the fucking</v>

1466
01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:52.110
pile on team that the Yankees have been for the last 12 fucking years?

1467
01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:57.740
Every God damn free agent on the fucking planet just clinging to Derek Jeters

1468
01:32:57.981 --> 01:33:01.880
leg.
Show me how to do it.
I want to win one too.

1469
01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:07.750
Huh?
Roger Clemens,
that fed buffalo wing.

1470
01:33:07.751 --> 01:33:12.230
Eaton Jackass.
Was it hard up in Toronto?
Roger.

1471
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:14.870
Then he fucking comes down there and jumps in the fucking Limo.

1472
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:18.800
The fucking balls of these New York fans to sit there and question somebody's

1473
01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:23.330
piling on another team to go in a fucking championship.
I,
I can't even take it.

1474
01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:29.200
I think I got to drink some throat coat tea that I mentioned that on this

1475
01:33:29.201 --> 01:33:32.440
podcast cause I already deleted the other one when I was annoyed with how

1476
01:33:32.441 --> 01:33:35.340
fucking unfunny I was.
I'm great.

1477
01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:37.880
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the ratings for this in New York

1478
01:33:37.881 --> 01:33:42.110
City are going to be kind of low this week.
I got to throw Coty,
which is great.

1479
01:33:42.111 --> 01:33:45.530
If you stand on stage and you don't know how to write a joke and you have to

1480
01:33:45.531 --> 01:33:46.364
scream at jokes,

1481
01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:49.670
or even if you'd like to call your girlfriend account at the top of your lungs,

1482
01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:53.830
you know you have a do that and then the next day you want to do it again,

1483
01:33:53.831 --> 01:33:57.420
but you throw these two tore up.
You can't do it well,

1484
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:59.700
get organic throat coat tea,
everybody.

1485
01:34:00.650 --> 01:34:04.760
You could call your girl a cunt seven days a week,
365 days a year.

1486
01:34:05.670 --> 01:34:10.050
That'd be a great commercial,
right?
Just have the girl crying in the background,

1487
01:34:10.051 --> 01:34:13.710
sitting down in the fetal position as you're fucking sitting in the field.

1488
01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:18.230
Fetal position bill curled up in the fetal position bill,

1489
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:22.640
he had dumped,
fuck,
all right,
let's see.
What did I do so far in this podcast?

1490
01:34:22.641 --> 01:34:27.250
I pissed off anyone who isn't from America or I guess you know,

1491
01:34:27.710 --> 01:34:31.250
Americans who are also into soccer.
And then I trashed a,

1492
01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:36.030
a giant media market.
See right there,

1493
01:34:36.031 --> 01:34:36.480
Bill.

1494
01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:40.830
That's why New York is such the big stage because it's one of the biggest media

1495
01:34:40.831 --> 01:34:42.930
markets in all of the fucking cook for you.

1496
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:48.950
How pathetic are you fucking teams that you got to bring up the level of media

1497
01:34:50.250 --> 01:34:51.120
in your city,

1498
01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:56.420
the level of media gimme a fucking break.

1499
01:34:57.350 --> 01:35:01.430
<v 1>Two Championship banners,
1970 fucking three.</v>

1500
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:06.440
Do you know in 1973,
the Chevy Vega was considered a sports car.

1501
01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:10.070
And if you go on the game show network,

1502
01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:15.800
people lose their fucking minds about that car,
you know,

1503
01:35:15.801 --> 01:35:18.020
and you can win.
And then they opened the kernel,

1504
01:35:18.021 --> 01:35:23.021
bright little Chevy Vega and these people with their fucking big Greg,

1505
01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:26.420
Greg Bay,
Brady fucking belt buckles,

1506
01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:31.340
and they're fucking,
uh,
who's that dude from?
Knocked up,

1507
01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:38.200
observe and report the Seth Rogen fucking Afros go absolutely fucking ape shit

1508
01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:45.110
over a Chevy Vega.
That's when you guys want it.
Last.

1509
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:51.430
People from are dying of old fucking age on that team.

1510
01:35:51.651 --> 01:35:55.550
Who did you have an idea?
Who are the fucking,
the Nix,
the greats.

1511
01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:59.960
Who Do you got?
Bill Bradley.

1512
01:36:00.710 --> 01:36:04.610
Daddy became a senator and then he fucking died.

1513
01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:12.020
This is what it is.
You want to get down to brass tacks here?

1514
01:36:12.021 --> 01:36:16.970
What's really bugging me is,
uh,
in Boston we only have four sports teams.

1515
01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:21.530
Okay?
We're playing a fucking,
you know,

1516
01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:26.210
we got one,
one bullet in the chamber and those cunts down there in New York,

1517
01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:30.890
they're doubled down in two out of the four fucking sports every year.

1518
01:36:30.891 --> 01:36:33.560
This split and fucking aces in two different sports.

1519
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:38.270
So they pad their stats with championships.
But I respect the Yankees.

1520
01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:43.720
The Yankees are the greatest franchise in an an all for sports.

1521
01:36:43.821 --> 01:36:47.300
They got the fucking championships.
You have to respect it.
They got them.

1522
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:52.450
And I would never ever try to act like somebody was afraid to play in Boston

1523
01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:58.940
because of the media or whatever the fuck that you know or call it the big stage

1524
01:36:58.941 --> 01:37:02.030
in Boston.
All right.

1525
01:37:02.031 --> 01:37:04.490
I would never do that out of respect for the fucking Yankees.

1526
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:07.910
The fact that they have 20 more fucking championships than we do.

1527
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.610
Okay,

1528
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:15.610
so give me the fucking respect that I deserve as a Boston Celtics Fan,

1529
01:37:15.711 --> 01:37:20.711
that we have 15 more fucking NBA championships than you do fucking idiots.

1530
01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:23.810
The big stage.

1531
01:37:23.811 --> 01:37:28.811
I'm so sick of these fat mantated shitheads with their fucking game worn jerseys

1532
01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:32.990
and they yell shit at players on the field and they think that they're

1533
01:37:32.991 --> 01:37:34.010
intimidating them.

1534
01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:40.240
You know like the fact that you got a d up Koby Bryant that you know that night

1535
01:37:41.090 --> 01:37:43.940
isn't enough to make you nervous?
No,

1536
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.260
it's the fat fuck with the shaved head and fucking row 58 g

1537
01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:54.800
who Stew's Chanten airball air.
They don't care.
Then even fucking hear it.

1538
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.170
They don't even hear it.
Lebron James is not afraid to go to New York.

1539
01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:02.190
He wanted to win.
All right?
That's why the fuck he went to Miami.

1540
01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:07.670
But uh,
you know,
and I would really love it and this is the deal if,

1541
01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:11.430
if the fucking Lakers didn't exist,
um,

1542
01:38:11.610 --> 01:38:15.840
with this stupid tee shirts claiming that the Los Angeles Lakers have fucking
16,

1543
01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:17.280
because that's what the t shirt says.

1544
01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:19.920
It says Los Angeles Lakers 16 championships,

1545
01:38:19.921 --> 01:38:24.870
not Los Angeles Slash Minneapolis Lakers.
Um,

1546
01:38:24.930 --> 01:38:29.160
so now I have to become a Miami heat fan.
I really do.
But just for the record,

1547
01:38:29.161 --> 01:38:33.570
dude,
I don't like any of this shit.
I didn't like the 2008 Boston Celtics.

1548
01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:37.760
I didn't like that either.
Where you just go out and,

1549
01:38:37.770 --> 01:38:40.830
and just everybody piles on one team.
I don't fucking like it.

1550
01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:45.450
I don't like this age of the super teams.
It's a,

1551
01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:49.110
yeah.
And I don't even,
that's not,
I don't know what it is anymore.
It's like,

1552
01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:50.150
it's like,
uh,

1553
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:54.450
it's sports of becoming like what Ruth retail stores have become.

1554
01:38:54.450 --> 01:38:56.040
They're all like these superstores now.

1555
01:38:56.850 --> 01:39:00.330
There's not like just the regular hardware store.
That example,

1556
01:39:00.331 --> 01:39:03.450
I use every podcast.
It's always a hardware store with me,

1557
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:07.590
but fucking one trick pony.
It's all fucking,
it's all Walmarts now.

1558
01:39:07.591 --> 01:39:11.370
Home depots best buys,
all of that type of shit.

1559
01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:14.640
And uh,
I dunno,

1560
01:39:14.670 --> 01:39:19.670
it's not the same kind of pride like that that you had back in the day when you

1561
01:39:20.731 --> 01:39:25.731
watched red Arrow back get some unknown center from Golden State.

1562
01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.800
You know Robert Parish,

1563
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:33.600
who the fuck knew who he was before he came to the Celtics and he goes after

1564
01:39:33.601 --> 01:39:38.601
Kevin Mchale was in a highly touted draft pick and then Larry Bird,

1565
01:39:39.361 --> 01:39:42.840
he works on for like three fucking years and gets them to come to the Celtics

1566
01:39:42.841 --> 01:39:44.280
like that with some interesting shit.

1567
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:47.790
But nowadays when you got shit like Kevin Mchale,

1568
01:39:47.791 --> 01:39:52.791
a former Celtic is working for the grizzlies and he gives the fucking Celtics

1569
01:39:53.071 --> 01:39:56.250
Kevin Garnett for nothing,
for nothing.

1570
01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:59.550
Decimates an entire fucking franchise.

1571
01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:04.710
The same way Jerry West is fucking working for Memphis and gives the fucking

1572
01:40:04.711 --> 01:40:09.630
Lakers Pau Gasol for nothing.
I mean,
it's a,
I don't know,
I don't fucking know.

1573
01:40:10.770 --> 01:40:14.310
And the fact that these fucking knick fans are sitting there talking about that

1574
01:40:14.311 --> 01:40:19.311
guy piling on as the god Damn Yankees are Erin negotiations to try to get cliff

1575
01:40:19.831 --> 01:40:24.090
Lee.
Like they don't have enough with fucking Subathra Aja Burnett,

1576
01:40:24.091 --> 01:40:26.730
Marianna Rivera,
fucking Alex Rodriguez,

1577
01:40:26.731 --> 01:40:29.280
Al fucking to share all those guys.

1578
01:40:29.490 --> 01:40:32.220
I love all the names of fading away cause I don't even watch baseball anymore.

1579
01:40:32.221 --> 01:40:36.220
It's such a fucking stupid God damn sport.
Um,

1580
01:40:37.530 --> 01:40:42.180
do it.
If the Yankees got cliff Lee,
you might as well just mail them the trophy,

1581
01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:46.860
you know,
and um,
this is what it is.
I Dunno if I'm just this crabby old man.

1582
01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:51.450
I'm really trying to find the art in,

1583
01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:52.313
uh,

1584
01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:57.700
signing all these free agents because it just seems to me like whoever has the

1585
01:40:57.701 --> 01:41:02.701
most fucking money will eventually get most of the best guys.

1586
01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:07.570
You know,
occasionally you'll lose out on a guy,
occasionally a cliff Lee,

1587
01:41:07.571 --> 01:41:10.000
we'll go to the rangers,
you know,

1588
01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:14.890
or somebody will pick the fucking angels or maybe they'll go to the fucking red

1589
01:41:14.891 --> 01:41:16.720
sox or something like that.
But generally speaking,

1590
01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:20.230
you start with the fucking Yankees and then it just goes down.
I Dunno,

1591
01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.960
I just doesn't seem like there's any fucking skill that I had just been of a

1592
01:41:22.961 --> 01:41:25.900
five.
You know what it is.
I'm on my fucking period this week,

1593
01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:31.600
half hour a rag and about that shit.
Let's get to,
uh,
let's see.

1594
01:41:31.670 --> 01:41:36.520
Let's just totally fucking,
uh,
make a left turn here.
And,
uh,

1595
01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:42.100
somebody asked me some for some advice this week.
All right,

1596
01:41:42.101 --> 01:41:43.850
here we go.
This is,
this is now,
this is a quote.

1597
01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:48.900
This is a situation that I think a lot of people that all embrace can deal with.

1598
01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:55.030
Um,
let's see here.
Uh,
hey bill,

1599
01:41:55.210 --> 01:42:00.190
huge fan.
Love you.
Comedy a with the hope this won't get too long.
Um,

1600
01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:04.810
it starts with one of my good friends going out with this girl.
Uh,

1601
01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.730
they went out for about a,
uh,
right off the bat,
you know,
he can't,

1602
01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:08.890
can't you tell where this is going?

1603
01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:13.210
This story starts with one of my good friends going out with this girl.

1604
01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.230
They went out for about a year or two on honor,
on and off.

1605
01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:21.770
Come on bill.
Focus here.
Just try to read this smoothly.
All right,

1606
01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:24.280
let's start over and it starts with one of my good friends going out with this

1607
01:42:24.281 --> 01:42:29.020
girl.
They went out for about a year or two on and off.
I'm still though,

1608
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:30.820
even when they were together,

1609
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:34.540
they were never really good in quotes.

1610
01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:39.670
Here we go.

1611
01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:44.560
They fought basically all the time and just didn't seem right for each other

1612
01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:45.790
though.
Gee,

1613
01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:50.590
you know where this is going during the early stages of their relationship.

1614
01:42:50.591 --> 01:42:52.900
My friend thought I had a thing for her.

1615
01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:57.160
Ogz She's a,
she is a good looking girl.

1616
01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:01.420
She is a good looking girl and I was friends with her before they even got

1617
01:43:01.421 --> 01:43:02.710
together.
Dude,

1618
01:43:02.711 --> 01:43:07.711
you are so justifying what the fuck you either did or about ready to do.

1619
01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:11.230
I love it.
They weren't really good for each other.

1620
01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:14.710
Even when they were together,
they just,
there was something missing.

1621
01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:19.690
I actually knew her before he did.
Um,
here we go.

1622
01:43:19.691 --> 01:43:22.990
She is a good looking girl and I was friends with there before they were even

1623
01:43:22.991 --> 01:43:23.440
together.

1624
01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:28.440
I admit I might have inadvertently been a little flirty with her sometimes.

1625
01:43:32.110 --> 01:43:36.880
Oh,
I'm sorry it was I just flirting there.
There you have a future at uh,

1626
01:43:36.881 --> 01:43:41.881
at BP the next time they pollute an entire Gulf of a nation that they're not

1627
01:43:42.221 --> 01:43:47.220
even citizens of and they need to bring somebody out to stand behind the podium

1628
01:43:47.230 --> 01:43:48.490
through.
This is fucking great.

1629
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:52.940
I might have inadvertently been a little flirty with her.

1630
01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:56.780
How the fuck do you even do that?
How do you inadvertently flirt with somebody?

1631
01:43:58.100 --> 01:43:59.660
Wow.
You really look beautiful in that dress.

1632
01:43:59.661 --> 01:44:02.830
I'll tell you if you were my girlfriend,
I have ever Devin.
I mean,
wait,

1633
01:44:02.831 --> 01:44:05.390
what the fuck do you go with?
Oh,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That's right.

1634
01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:06.890
You're now my girlfriend.
I'm sorry.

1635
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:11.090
I thought you were my girlfriend for a second.
What was I thinking?
Jesus Christ.

1636
01:44:11.091 --> 01:44:13.760
I'm so embarrassed and my face turning red.
Oh my God.

1637
01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:18.320
I was just inadvertently flirting with you.
Right then.
Uh,

1638
01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:22.790
Jesus.
Uh,
here we go.
But any,
he goes,
this is what he says.

1639
01:44:22.791 --> 01:44:25.610
I might have inadvertently been a little flirty with her sometimes,

1640
01:44:25.611 --> 01:44:29.810
but that shit always happens with a guy and a girl.
I think,
dude,

1641
01:44:29.811 --> 01:44:33.880
the level of guilt just weighing you down as you're trying to justify all of

1642
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:38.030
this.
Uh,
either way I told him,
um,

1643
01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:42.740
I didn't like her,
which was true dude,
stop lying to yourself.

1644
01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:46.670
Anyways,
it passed.
However,
I always got this feeling that there was a,

1645
01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:51.620
there was still an undertone that he resented me since then.
Yeah.

1646
01:44:51.650 --> 01:44:56.420
Probably because of all the inadvertent flirting and the fact that you were

1647
01:44:56.421 --> 01:45:01.190
emoting that they weren't right for each other.
Um,
but anyways,
let's,

1648
01:45:01.191 --> 01:45:04.070
let's,
let's fast forward as he says,
fast forward now.

1649
01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:08.990
They've been broken up for at least a year and don't talk.
She says,

1650
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:13.220
uh,
he randomly texted her,
Texas,
her text her,

1651
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:19.510
Jesus Christ,
I can't even fucking read.
She says he randomly texted her,
but uh,

1652
01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:22.670
that she doesn't ever answer him.
But regardless of that,

1653
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:27.740
now this girl likes me.
What?
Oh my God,

1654
01:45:27.741 --> 01:45:31.790
I didn't see that coming.
Wait a minute.
Anyways,

1655
01:45:31.791 --> 01:45:36.791
but she actually likes me and basically says she wants to fuck my voice,

1656
01:45:37.251 --> 01:45:38.280
just cracked in the perfect

1657
01:45:40.850 --> 01:45:44.330
says she wants to fuck.
Am I getting excited?

1658
01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:49.370
I need some more throat coat here and basically says she wants to fuck.
Um,

1659
01:45:49.371 --> 01:45:54.371
she tells me stuff like she wishes she went out with me instead of him to begin

1660
01:45:54.951 --> 01:45:58.010
with.
Now I do all right with girls,

1661
01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.830
but I don't have them lining up or anything.

1662
01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:05.120
So I'm not trying to let a virtual shirt thing pass me by.

1663
01:46:05.150 --> 01:46:08.930
Oh my God.
And this is when it's getting Jerry Springer here.

1664
01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:12.710
Uh,
with most guys I don't,
I,

1665
01:46:12.770 --> 01:46:17.770
I'd feel like they'd not care if I went for it or at least understand why I did.

1666
01:46:20.970 --> 01:46:22.550
Did you realize what you're saying?

1667
01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:27.020
I think most guys wouldn't care if their best friend went out and bang their

1668
01:46:27.021 --> 01:46:29.930
fucking ex-girlfriend within a year of them going out.

1669
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:34.270
I think that they'd understand.
So anyways,
he goes,

1670
01:46:34.271 --> 01:46:35.600
so I think most guys want to stand,

1671
01:46:35.601 --> 01:46:40.601
but this buddy of mine is a little nuts and it's also a situation where he's the

1672
01:46:41.001 --> 01:46:45.950
type of guy that if he were in my position,
he do the same thing.
Ah Dude,

1673
01:46:45.951 --> 01:46:49.950
you just justifying.
You don't even need my advice,
you're going to do it.
Um,

1674
01:46:50.910 --> 01:46:54.540
my other friend who knows the whole situation says I should,

1675
01:46:55.050 --> 01:46:59.040
but others I've talked to about it.
Say I shouldn't.
Uh,

1676
01:46:59.041 --> 01:47:00.660
the last I talked to her,

1677
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:06.350
she said she wanted to hang out just me and her and then I should let her know

1678
01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:13.290
when I want to.
Uh,
all right.
I guess this thing's getting kind of long.

1679
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:14.700
I have one question.

1680
01:47:14.701 --> 01:47:19.470
Do I have any justification and fucking this girl and two,
if I do,

1681
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:24.150
would you say I should go through with it?
Okay.

1682
01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.220
All right,
sir.

1683
01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:32.010
There there's just this just a ton of shit going on here.
Okay.

1684
01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:36.810
Right off the bat,
you have to be honest with yourself.

1685
01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:40.290
All right?
You weren't inadvertently f a flirting with this girl.

1686
01:47:40.650 --> 01:47:42.930
You actually probably,
uh,

1687
01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:47.850
like this girl before this guy even got with her,
or maybe the fact that the guy,

1688
01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:50.190
your friend got worth there and he was banging her,

1689
01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:54.420
made you all of a sudden interested in her.
See,
I don't know,
you as a person,

1690
01:47:54.630 --> 01:47:59.430
you could be a very sadistic,
a human being.
Actually,

1691
01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:01.110
I'm going to go on a limb and say you're not,

1692
01:48:01.111 --> 01:48:04.500
because the fact that you actually give a fuck enough to write me and ask

1693
01:48:05.010 --> 01:48:06.210
whether you should do this,

1694
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:10.230
that means you actually have some sort of guilt about it.
Um,

1695
01:48:11.670 --> 01:48:14.590
so you won't get off on banging your fucking,
uh,

1696
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:18.360
best friend's ex girlfriend,
uh,
through this.

1697
01:48:18.361 --> 01:48:22.590
A lot of shit here that could blow up in your face.
Okay?

1698
01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:25.710
In a perfect world.
All right.

1699
01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:30.080
You're a man and you say,
you know what,
uh,

1700
01:48:30.230 --> 01:48:32.880
that's not going to be worth the,
the,
the blowback.

1701
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:36.390
It's not going to be worth the fucking damage that I'm going to do.

1702
01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:40.830
This guy's my best friend.
I,
even though he would do it to me,

1703
01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:42.870
I'm not going to do it to him.

1704
01:48:42.930 --> 01:48:46.440
And then I also need to stop being friends with this guy because anybody who

1705
01:48:46.441 --> 01:48:50.340
would go out and fuck my ex girlfriend within a year is not truly a friend.

1706
01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:53.910
I need to get better friends.
But despite all that,

1707
01:48:53.911 --> 01:48:57.180
I'm still not going to do what the fuck he would have done just because he would

1708
01:48:57.181 --> 01:48:58.014
have done it to me.

1709
01:48:58.470 --> 01:49:02.280
And you just walk away from the situation and you go out and you chat up some

1710
01:49:02.281 --> 01:49:07.140
other fucking broads.
That's,
that is like,
if you want to be knighted someday,

1711
01:49:07.530 --> 01:49:12.530
buy one of those fucking broads over there and a in the castle in England,

1712
01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:17.520
you know,
if you want to go over there with Surf Surf Phil Collins looking on

1713
01:49:20.010 --> 01:49:22.560
and get knighted,
that's what the fuck you do.

1714
01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:26.530
But if you're going to bang this broad,
um,

1715
01:49:26.850 --> 01:49:30.300
you've already fucked up.
Okay.

1716
01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:33.870
Fucking your best friend's ex girlfriend.

1717
01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:39.110
It's like committing a murder you want is few people involved is humanly

1718
01:49:39.691 --> 01:49:40.524
possible.

1719
01:49:41.010 --> 01:49:46.010
I learned that on an episode of uninformed when we had a cop come in and me and

1720
01:49:46.261 --> 01:49:50.650
my,
uh,
cohost Joe to Rosa were saying that,

1721
01:49:50.710 --> 01:49:54.640
um,
you know,
we were trying to come up with how to commit the perfect murder.

1722
01:49:54.641 --> 01:49:57.520
And I remember said,
okay,
I'd get me and a buddy of mine,
he goes right there,

1723
01:49:57.521 --> 01:50:01.240
you fucked up right there.
You fucked up.
He goes,
the more people you bring in,

1724
01:50:01.930 --> 01:50:04.180
the bigger chance you have of getting caught,
you know,

1725
01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:07.990
cause you're not going to rat yourself out.
But the other guy,
if he gets scared,

1726
01:50:07.991 --> 01:50:11.650
might go down to the police station and try to cop a plea.
All right?

1727
01:50:11.770 --> 01:50:15.310
That's the same shit with this.
If you're going to fuck your best friend's girl,

1728
01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:20.080
ex-girlfriend,
you don't go around and ask other friends going,
dude,

1729
01:50:20.081 --> 01:50:24.970
should I do with you?
Don't.
And you already did.

1730
01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:30.160
All right.
And then the other side of it is,
um,

1731
01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:35.890
I don't know how the two of these people broke up,
but uh,

1732
01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:42.130
you know,
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
And for all,
you know,

1733
01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:47.770
this chick might be a fucking psycho.
All right.
I mean,

1734
01:50:47.771 --> 01:50:52.771
I think it's a good thing that he's texting her and not the other way around and

1735
01:50:53.021 --> 01:50:57.460
that she is not texting him back.
Granted,

1736
01:50:57.910 --> 01:51:02.260
you're taking her word for it,
that that's what the situation is now.

1737
01:51:02.261 --> 01:51:06.370
For all you know,
it's the reverse and if it is the reverse,

1738
01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:08.560
she wants some sort of vengeance,

1739
01:51:08.770 --> 01:51:13.770
which means she goes out and bangs his best friend and then Lo and behold feels

1740
01:51:15.851 --> 01:51:19.780
guilty the next day and then has to tell him,
all right,

1741
01:51:19.810 --> 01:51:23.320
just to let you know that is on the fucking table.

1742
01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:28.870
If you really want to know whether or not you want a jerk,
if you want to jerk,

1743
01:51:28.871 --> 01:51:31.420
if you want to fucking,
I got ahead of myself here.

1744
01:51:31.421 --> 01:51:36.421
If you want to fuck this girl and not just go jerk off to her and after you'd

1745
01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.530
done,
if you still want a Banger,

1746
01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:43.420
you want a banger and then just fucking man up and deal with the fucking

1747
01:51:43.421 --> 01:51:47.190
consequences of it and go out and bang her because who gives a fuck as someday

1748
01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:51.820
you're going to be 80 and who gives a shit,
you know?

1749
01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:56.170
Or on the other side,
if you actually have feelings for this girl,
that's a whole,

1750
01:51:56.290 --> 01:51:57.430
then you should definitely do it.

1751
01:51:57.431 --> 01:51:59.980
If you actually feel like this girl could be the girl that you're going to spend

1752
01:51:59.981 --> 01:52:02.800
your life with,
then I would definitely say go for it.

1753
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:06.660
Knowing full well that your friendship with this other guy is,
uh,

1754
01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:11.290
is going to end.
Um,
I dunno.

1755
01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:15.910
So dude it,
you know what,
it's,
it's fucking on you.
You know,

1756
01:52:15.911 --> 01:52:19.540
if you asked me what I do at a,
yeah,
I would have,
back in the day I would have,

1757
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:21.790
but now that I'm an older,
wiser man,
I wouldn't,

1758
01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:25.330
I would just fucking rub one out to her and then be afterwards going,
oh,

1759
01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:28.600
thank God I didn't fucking do that.
Thank God I didn't do that.
And I was,

1760
01:52:28.601 --> 01:52:33.220
I would also fucking not hang out with the other guy because any guy friend of

1761
01:52:33.221 --> 01:52:35.830
mine that would fuck an ex girlfriend of mine within a fucking year,

1762
01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:37.600
I wouldn't want to be friends with,

1763
01:52:38.530 --> 01:52:40.390
even though I just described all of my friends

1764
01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:47.960
do it.
I don't know what to tell.
I don't know what to tell you.

1765
01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:54.220
You probably shouldn't do what you should.
You shouldn't do.
Just shut.

1766
01:52:54.221 --> 01:52:57.710
And you should go out and go fucking bank somebody else.
You shouldn't.
All right.

1767
01:52:57.830 --> 01:53:02.330
But I feel like a hypocrite because I would,
I would.
But then again,

1768
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:06.230
I'm also a fucking 42 year old guy.
Oh,
never got married.
So when,

1769
01:53:06.231 --> 01:53:08.600
so you're listening to a complete fucking scumbag here.

1770
01:53:08.630 --> 01:53:13.550
So Jesus Christ,
this is why I don't have a fucking advice show,

1771
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:18.930
you know,
because in my attempt to be honest,
I,
I,
I,

1772
01:53:19.130 --> 01:53:21.770
I tell you both things,
do it.
Don't do it.
I would,

1773
01:53:21.771 --> 01:53:23.990
but you shouldn't have a nice day.

1774
01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:28.970
Um,
you know what?
Let's,
let's go to the listeners.

1775
01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:31.840
I would love to hear from the women because they,

1776
01:53:31.841 --> 01:53:33.860
they're going to have on both sides.
They're going to have like,

1777
01:53:33.861 --> 01:53:35.480
you shouldn't do that,
your friend.

1778
01:53:35.810 --> 01:53:37.790
And then they're also going to be mad on some level.

1779
01:53:37.791 --> 01:53:42.410
Like why did guys feel like they own somebody just because they youth to go out

1780
01:53:42.411 --> 01:53:43.244
with them?

1781
01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:47.600
Because we're territorial with territorial that way.

1782
01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:53.080
And you have to understand that whoever you've banged in your life as a female,

1783
01:53:53.810 --> 01:53:58.760
um,
for the rest of your life,
that pussy is not yours anymore.
It belongs to him.

1784
01:53:59.270 --> 01:54:03.380
And you can say it's yours.
It isn't because he fucked it.

1785
01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:11.240
All right?
You know what?
I feel like,
you know,

1786
01:54:11.241 --> 01:54:13.400
there wasn't enough ignorance on this podcast,

1787
01:54:13.401 --> 01:54:15.980
so I feel like I had to just say something stupid like that.
But that's,

1788
01:54:15.981 --> 01:54:20.720
that's how guys work.
And,
um,
I'd even asked you,
this is your best friend.

1789
01:54:20.721 --> 01:54:24.350
Is he bigger than you are physically?
Can he beat you down?

1790
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:28.610
Does he take Jujitsu classes?
Um,

1791
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:32.900
has he ever had any murderous thoughts that he,

1792
01:54:32.901 --> 01:54:36.530
I'm sort of divulge to you at an,
you know,

1793
01:54:36.531 --> 01:54:41.531
a night of drinking too many Tequila shots and you see an a and the darker side

1794
01:54:42.441 --> 01:54:46.100
of him,
you know,
there's,
there's a whole bunch of Shit,
ah,

1795
01:54:46.130 --> 01:54:48.470
this is what she got to do.
This is what you gotta do.

1796
01:54:48.471 --> 01:54:53.180
Go out and get yourself a fucking pimp hat.
All right?

1797
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:57.980
And this is what you have to do.
You got to go to this girl and you,

1798
01:54:57.981 --> 01:55:02.330
you just gotta lay it on the fucking table.
That's what you gotta do.

1799
01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:05.900
You just gotta be honest with her and just say,
look

1800
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:11.570
sweetheart,
I have wanted to fuck you since 2006.

1801
01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:17.030
You don't say that,
but basically you finish your way into that.

1802
01:55:17.031 --> 01:55:19.310
You got to tell her that you've wanted to hook up with her.

1803
01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:24.410
And the only reason why you didn't,
this is the deal.
This is

1804
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:31.310
all right.
Well,
we had a little technical difficulty there.
I left you hanging.

1805
01:55:31.610 --> 01:55:33.470
Sorry about that.
The batteries just died.

1806
01:55:33.471 --> 01:55:37.150
I was right in the middle of trying to tell this dude how we could,
uh,

1807
01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:38.630
go out and bang this girl.

1808
01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:43.060
Now I got to fucking stick this into the goddamn garage band.

1809
01:55:43.170 --> 01:55:45.930
Splice it together,
which I already did at this point.

1810
01:55:45.931 --> 01:55:50.610
So why even bitch about it when you listen to this fucking thing?
All right,

1811
01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:54.900
let me wrap this God damn podcast up a telling this kid how to go out and fuck

1812
01:55:54.901 --> 01:55:57.630
his best friend's ex girlfriend.
All right.
This is what you do.
You got to,

1813
01:55:57.631 --> 01:56:01.140
you got to have a talk with this girl before you do it.

1814
01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:06.000
Don't just go over there and just fucking sneak over there.

1815
01:56:06.570 --> 01:56:10.140
You know,
with this nervous excitement,
fucking rail,

1816
01:56:10.141 --> 01:56:14.160
this girl bust your nut and then realize,
oh my God,

1817
01:56:14.161 --> 01:56:17.880
I have no fucking feelings for this girl.
And then you know,

1818
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:21.750
risking that she'll then,
you know,
be resentful.

1819
01:56:21.751 --> 01:56:25.110
All the bullshit I said in the first fucking installment of this God damn

1820
01:56:25.111 --> 01:56:27.540
podcast,
this is what you gotta do.

1821
01:56:27.570 --> 01:56:31.110
You gotta fucking get everything out in the open.
All right?

1822
01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:37.220
And fucking let her convince you that it's the right fucking thing to do and get

1823
01:56:37.981 --> 01:56:41.340
her to say that she ain't gonna say shit.
All right.

1824
01:56:42.090 --> 01:56:45.390
Get her to say that.
And when she says she's not going to say shit,

1825
01:56:45.570 --> 01:56:48.000
you have to reader.
All right?

1826
01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:54.480
Like a fucking seasoned goddamn pro.
You know,

1827
01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:58.770
the 27 fucking uh,
pantomimes align,

1828
01:56:58.771 --> 01:57:02.850
whatever that fucking goddamn movie was true romance.

1829
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:04.950
You got to look at her and Jay.
You,
you have to,

1830
01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:06.720
you have to make a fucking assessment.

1831
01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.910
If this girl can keep her fucking mouth shut

1832
01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:12.870
by presenting these scenarios,
you've got to be,
look,

1833
01:57:12.871 --> 01:57:14.480
I'm going to get worried that tomorrow.
What if you,

1834
01:57:14.481 --> 01:57:17.730
you're going to wake up feeling guilty and then you have to confess to him,

1835
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:22.890
you know,
I'm not going to feel,
I'm not going to feel guilty.
Yeah,
you are.

1836
01:57:22.891 --> 01:57:27.800
You're just fucking,
I don't know.
I'm really giving you shit advice,
dude.

1837
01:57:27.810 --> 01:57:31.380
I'm,
I'm trying to give you a fucking scumbag way to go out and go do this shit.

1838
01:57:31.410 --> 01:57:35.850
Just like,
I dunno.

1839
01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:39.240
I'm fucking bad at this,
man.
I have to be in the moment to what the fuck?

1840
01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:43.590
Dirt Bag,
God damn thing.
What I be saying.
All right,
this is what you do.

1841
01:57:43.710 --> 01:57:48.090
You don't go over a fucking,
this is what you do.
Don't go over a goddamn place.

1842
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:50.820
See,
this is the hard thing.
Now you've got to go out.

1843
01:57:50.821 --> 01:57:53.100
You've got to meet her in public.
Okay?

1844
01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:58.200
So there's no sexual fucking tension that you can act on.
All right?
So you,

1845
01:57:58.201 --> 01:58:01.530
Dick won't be like,
dude,
she's fine.
She's not lying.
She's not lying.

1846
01:58:01.531 --> 01:58:05.960
She's going to be cool.
What you have to do is,
um,

1847
01:58:08.890 --> 01:58:11.190
you're going to meet in a public place where then people can see a c two.

1848
01:58:11.191 --> 01:58:14.670
This is just,
it's just the fuck.
It's a,
it's a tough one.
Tell you what to it.

1849
01:58:14.671 --> 01:58:16.470
If you can actually fucking pull this off,

1850
01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:20.220
why don't you write me back and tell you,
tell me how you,
how the fuck he did it.

1851
01:58:21.810 --> 01:58:23.130
I remember a long time ago,

1852
01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:27.470
I was in the beginning of a relationship and I was banging this,

1853
01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:32.160
still banging this other psycho on the side.
And,
uh,

1854
01:58:32.370 --> 01:58:34.500
like a dirt bag,
you know?

1855
01:58:35.670 --> 01:58:38.780
And I remember there was going to be a point where the two of them were going to

1856
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:40.560
be at the same fucking place.

1857
01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:47.050
So I just dealt with it before.
It wasn't before we hooked up.

1858
01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:49.120
I just said,
look,
you've got to be honest with you.

1859
01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:50.980
This girl I'm coming down with,
we're new,

1860
01:58:51.070 --> 01:58:53.830
I'm starting to have feelings for all right.

1861
01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:58.240
I told her that I cleaned up everything on the side,
which I haven't with you,

1862
01:58:58.241 --> 01:59:02.430
so I need you to not act weird when I fucking come down there.
If I don't,

1863
01:59:02.431 --> 01:59:04.690
you know,
if I'm not saying hello to you.
Okay.

1864
01:59:05.230 --> 01:59:07.450
That was before I hooked up with her and she's like,
fine,
fine.

1865
01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:12.010
And then she went down there and then she did at cool because in her head she's

1866
01:59:12.011 --> 01:59:14.410
probably holding out like maybe if I had cool,

1867
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:17.860
he'll see how fucking cool I am and they don't want to be with me and not this

1868
01:59:17.861 --> 01:59:20.950
other bitch.
And meanwhile I fucking got away with it.

1869
01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:23.320
And you know what a part of me died.

1870
01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:26.980
Another fucking chunk of my soul came out and said,
dirty fucking game.

1871
01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:31.570
It's a dirty God damn game.
I'm a piece of shit.
Don't fucking listen to me.

1872
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:36.370
All right,
what else do we got this week?
But by the way,
dude,

1873
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:39.190
now that I've talked about it for 10 fucking minutes,
you got,

1874
01:59:39.191 --> 01:59:42.790
you got to write a Spec and let us know what happened.
All right?

1875
01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:47.950
You know,
I realize this might be like one of those stupid Hollywood movies.

1876
01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:52.180
And then I realized that's not the person I wanted to be doing.
If you do that,

1877
01:59:52.181 --> 01:59:55.570
I don't want to fucking hear it.
But if you done,
if you do the dirty bullshit,

1878
01:59:55.810 --> 01:59:56.730
I want to hear about it.

1879
02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:03.910
Would I be the worst fucking life coach ever?
Um,
all right,
here's a,

1880
02:00:03.911 --> 02:00:08.260
here's a segment,
corporate cons.
A bill for someone who flies as much as you do.

1881
02:00:08.261 --> 02:00:13.261
Can you take a shot at explaining the logic behind why a one way ticket almost

1882
02:00:13.541 --> 02:00:18.440
costs more than a round trip.
Um,

1883
02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:22.660
for a domestic,
for domestic flights,
maybe this isn't a problem.
However,

1884
02:00:22.661 --> 02:00:24.250
I'm flying from your,
uh,

1885
02:00:24.251 --> 02:00:28.510
from Europe at the end of the month on a one way ticket,

1886
02:00:28.511 --> 02:00:32.230
and it costs one and a half times more than a round trip trip ticket.

1887
02:00:32.590 --> 02:00:34.930
And I immediately said,
well,
why don't you buy the round trip ticket?

1888
02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:37.390
And he addresses this immediately and says,

1889
02:00:37.391 --> 02:00:41.530
and if the airline company can prove that I purchased a roundtrip ticket,

1890
02:00:42.010 --> 02:00:44.860
it was the attempt of not using the return for the flight.

1891
02:00:44.861 --> 02:00:49.120
They can legally charge for the price difference between the fares.

1892
02:00:49.810 --> 02:00:53.650
What the fuck is this normal business practice?
I hate to tell you what,

1893
02:00:53.770 --> 02:00:58.360
but it is because that's how corrupt our fucking government is.

1894
02:00:58.390 --> 02:01:01.930
That's how powerful corporations are around the fucking world.
They,

1895
02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:04.300
they do whatever they,
whatever they want to do.

1896
02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:09.340
And they have this thing where every quarter they have to show a profit.

1897
02:01:10.050 --> 02:01:11.860
All right?
Uh,
actually they have to,
to,

1898
02:01:11.890 --> 02:01:14.230
to show more of a profit than the previous quarter.

1899
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:17.710
They can't even just have the same amount of profit.
It's not enough.

1900
02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:18.790
And basically,

1901
02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:23.410
they've legally run out of ways to create revenue streams.

1902
02:01:23.411 --> 02:01:26.080
So what they're doing now is they're just stealing.

1903
02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:31.510
They're stealing from people.
All right?
If you have a one way ticket,

1904
02:01:31.690 --> 02:01:35.590
that means you're going home or you're starting a new life and you want to get

1905
02:01:35.591 --> 02:01:37.120
the fuck out of where you're at.

1906
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:40.100
So that's why they know that they can charge you a ton of fucking money.

1907
02:01:41.950 --> 02:01:44.240
All right?
And then,
well,
what are some buys?
A round trip ticket,

1908
02:01:44.241 --> 02:01:44.811
then we'll fucking,

1909
02:01:44.811 --> 02:01:48.740
we'll just write this little bill here and we'll have the senator who we fucking

1910
02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:53.900
paid for his God damn campaign help push it through.
Isn't that how it works?

1911
02:01:53.901 --> 02:01:57.350
They just call the senator.
I don't know anything.
Um,
yeah,
no,

1912
02:01:57.351 --> 02:01:58.280
it's a piece of shit thing.

1913
02:01:58.281 --> 02:02:02.670
So what you gotta do is you have to vandalize the airplane.
All right?

1914
02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:05.360
Do something to vandalize the fucking airplane.

1915
02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:08.870
I don't even do that cause all they're going to do is just pass that expense on

1916
02:02:08.871 --> 02:02:13.820
to us.
This is what you have to do.
Um,

1917
02:02:14.630 --> 02:02:19.630
you have to find out who it is that came up with that,

1918
02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:22.640
who created that?
Who was,
uh,

1919
02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:27.440
who was the lobbyist who push that thing through how that somehow became legal.

1920
02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:30.740
You got to find out where they live and then you just gotta.

1921
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:34.300
You gotta tailor them the whole fucking week.
Get that patterns down,

1922
02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:37.940
figure out when they go to the Goddamn Gym.
Alright,

1923
02:02:39.110 --> 02:02:42.920
borrow a pair of pantyhose from your fucking girlfriend,

1924
02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:45.710
put it over your head,
hide in some shrubs.

1925
02:02:46.130 --> 02:02:50.090
And when that dude comes walking out of the gym with that fucking towel around

1926
02:02:50.091 --> 02:02:50.660
his neck,

1927
02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:54.320
you just blast him right in the face and then you fucking choke them with your,

1928
02:02:54.321 --> 02:02:56.630
choke them.
You mushes face into the mulch

1929
02:02:59.390 --> 02:02:59.871
and you'd be like,

1930
02:02:59.871 --> 02:03:03.460
that's what a one way ticket from fucking Hollenback to the state yet content.

1931
02:03:03.710 --> 02:03:06.350
And then you get your fucking Ford Festiva and you drive away.

1932
02:03:07.070 --> 02:03:10.520
That's the only way to get back at him.
And,
uh,
and if you do that,

1933
02:03:10.521 --> 02:03:15.140
I'll give you a free DVD,
a underrated overrated for the week,
uh,

1934
02:03:15.710 --> 02:03:20.120
underrated,
the movie waiting.
Uh,
it's all about the world of restaurant,
waiters,

1935
02:03:20.121 --> 02:03:23.960
cooks,
et cetera.
It's funny,
honest,
and quite gross.

1936
02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:27.620
I imagine it is because I've worked in a couple of fucking restaurants and the

1937
02:03:27.621 --> 02:03:28.940
shit that goes on,
you know,

1938
02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:33.650
the shit that you'll do when you're not cooking for a family member is really a,

1939
02:03:33.651 --> 02:03:38.230
it's staggering.
I'll leave it at that.
Um,
overrated.
How,

1940
02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:40.010
and this is pretty bitter.
But anyways,

1941
02:03:40.011 --> 02:03:43.970
when you watch the special features on a DVD and there's always the making of

1942
02:03:43.971 --> 02:03:47.960
feature,
far too many of these features,
including the movie waiting,

1943
02:03:47.961 --> 02:03:52.310
then I just recommended have the actors and the directors jokingly calling

1944
02:03:52.580 --> 02:03:57.140
others on the film,
useless,
awful,
amateur,
amateurish,

1945
02:03:57.330 --> 02:04:01.970
et cetera.
Uh,
they'll talk about how the whole film is a disaster and it will,

1946
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:05.360
uh,
and we'll go straight to video.
Get it.

1947
02:04:06.110 --> 02:04:10.940
They don't really mean it.
They're joking around.
Lol,
lol.

1948
02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:15.870
See I told you it was a bitter one.
Yeah,
I guess,
you know,
I kind of understand.

1949
02:04:15.871 --> 02:04:17.510
I mean,
how many times can you just sit there and go,

1950
02:04:17.511 --> 02:04:22.511
Ashton Kutcher with absolutely brilliant in Madame of the butterfly,

1951
02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:26.180
the butterfly effect whenever the fuck it was called.
Um,

1952
02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:30.950
that seeing his reaction here is right up with Bruce Willis in die hard part

1953
02:04:30.951 --> 02:04:34.910
three when he turns around and looks at the green screen and pretends to be

1954
02:04:34.911 --> 02:04:38.190
looking at a jumbo jet.
It's was absolutely some of the best act.
I mean,

1955
02:04:38.191 --> 02:04:42.790
how long could you listen to that?
So they got to make fun of themselves.
Um,

1956
02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:44.190
I would go with arrogance.

1957
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:48.930
I would just talk about my scenes and how fucking amazing I am.
Um,

1958
02:04:48.990 --> 02:04:51.870
while I was pointing out the dumb shit that I did in it,
uh,

1959
02:04:51.871 --> 02:04:55.560
youtube videos for the week and do I,
I'm going to tell you,
man,

1960
02:04:55.590 --> 02:05:00.120
I think I'm recommended or at least the listeners of my podcast,

1961
02:05:00.121 --> 02:05:02.990
we're recommended some of the funniest and best fucking,
uh,

1962
02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:06.510
youtube videos out there.
How great would those youtube videos last week?

1963
02:05:06.511 --> 02:05:10.860
You know,
all right,
here's one duck face song search,

1964
02:05:10.890 --> 02:05:13.920
duck face song like quack,
quack,
duck face song.

1965
02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:18.750
And this is an amazing one.
Search fake Yo yo,

1966
02:05:18.751 --> 02:05:22.950
trickster fool's.
Every TV station everywhere.

1967
02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:24.180
I mean,

1968
02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:28.890
granted it could have been shorter but fake Yoyo trickster fool's,

1969
02:05:28.891 --> 02:05:31.080
every TV station everywhere.
This is hilarious.

1970
02:05:31.081 --> 02:05:36.081
This guy goes on and he claims to be a Yoyo champion and he actually sucks at it

1971
02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:41.250
and he talks all this shit and then he goes on there and he can't pull off any

1972
02:05:41.251 --> 02:05:46.251
tricks and he just stands there and leaves the morning news guy with the

1973
02:05:46.531 --> 02:05:51.450
awkwardness of him completely failing and not handling the failing and just

1974
02:05:51.451 --> 02:05:55.860
leaving it in the lap of the reporter and it's a,
it's fucking awesome.
Um,

1975
02:05:56.070 --> 02:06:00.210
AH,
here's one for all you kids and I'm going to use the young kid word.

1976
02:06:00.211 --> 02:06:05.160
This one is epic.
Um,
this one isn't on Youtube.

1977
02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:10.290
This is how cutting edge the Monday morning podcast is.
Uh,

1978
02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:15.320
go to www.everythingisterrible.com.

1979
02:06:16.530 --> 02:06:18.090
And then search for the video.

1980
02:06:18.091 --> 02:06:22.380
This is hip hop and uh,
it's awesome.

1981
02:06:23.010 --> 02:06:26.550
It's a fucking white lady.
Soccer mom,

1982
02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:30.210
you know,
and she's going to let you know what time it is.

1983
02:06:30.590 --> 02:06:35.220
I want to leave it at that.
Everything is terrible.com.
Um,
a couple more,

1984
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:38.880
uh,
for all unique fans out there who will,
licking your wounds,

1985
02:06:38.881 --> 02:06:43.881
go to go search a Lebron James Decision interview parody.

1986
02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:49.110
I think you'll enjoy that one immensely.
Uh,

1987
02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:51.570
fro you death metal fans who have a sense of humor.

1988
02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:54.600
And because this one really hinges on actually knowing the song,

1989
02:06:55.110 --> 02:07:00.110
there's a band called Cannibal corpse and the name of the song is hammer smashed

1990
02:07:00.331 --> 02:07:03.990
face.
And if you don't already know that song,

1991
02:07:03.991 --> 02:07:05.970
I suggest you listen to it first.

1992
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:11.490
Listened to Cannibal corpse hammer smashed face for as long as you can,

1993
02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:17.010
unless you're death metal fan.
And then you'll love it,
um,
or a fan of comedy.
Um,

1994
02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:21.540
and then go to search,
Cannibal Corpse Hammer,

1995
02:07:21.541 --> 02:07:26.130
smashed face,
smash face,
Disney radio version.

1996
02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:31.620
Some fucking genius out there.
Basically,
you know,
I guess death metals,

1997
02:07:31.621 --> 02:07:35.140
a lot of like,
I dunno,
the darker chords and he turned them all,

1998
02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:39.040
plays the same court but in a major court,
which are the happier ones.

1999
02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:44.080
And then he sings the song with the same lyrics.
It's fucking great.

2000
02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:46.840
Um,
and that is it.
You know what,

2001
02:07:46.841 --> 02:07:50.860
I didn't bring up asides from for hyping the month,
uh,

2002
02:07:51.010 --> 02:07:54.400
the FM podcast.com,
um,

2003
02:07:55.900 --> 02:07:58.300
is,
um,
I and all of this Lebron Shit,

2004
02:07:58.301 --> 02:08:03.301
I didn't really bring up like the fans of fucking Cleveland and yet another

2005
02:08:03.641 --> 02:08:06.610
fucking blow that those people have to take.
I mean,
it just,

2006
02:08:06.611 --> 02:08:11.611
it's brutal between the industry leaving that town and then I'll,

2007
02:08:12.161 --> 02:08:16.270
you know,
cc Sabathia he went,

2008
02:08:16.271 --> 02:08:20.410
ended up going in New York,
Manny Ramirez went to Boston.

2009
02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:22.870
Jim Tome may went to Philly.

2010
02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:28.500
I mean they had the team and now they finally get like fucking arguably I would

2011
02:08:29.891 --> 02:08:32.770
say the next Coby level player.
He's got a way to go.

2012
02:08:32.771 --> 02:08:37.540
But the next Coby level pay a player in Lebron James gave him a reason to go to

2013
02:08:37.541 --> 02:08:42.010
the downtown area.
It sucks.
It sucks because downtown Cleveland,

2014
02:08:42.011 --> 02:08:43.300
if you really look at the buildings,

2015
02:08:43.301 --> 02:08:48.301
if he can look past the scary homeless people in really look at the buildings,

2016
02:08:49.210 --> 02:08:52.180
uh,
it's beautiful.
It's just that,
you know,

2017
02:08:52.630 --> 02:08:54.250
getting back to these corporate cons,

2018
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:59.410
they just pulled up stakes and they left because they were sick of paying people

2019
02:08:59.411 --> 02:09:00.550
a fair wage.

2020
02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:04.330
And they were sick of having to pay for health insurance and they wanted to have

2021
02:09:04.331 --> 02:09:09.331
some eight year old go put the fucking grill on a God damn fucking caprice

2022
02:09:10.241 --> 02:09:15.040
classic.
I don't fucking though,
same thing with Detroit.
Those all those cities,

2023
02:09:15.041 --> 02:09:18.160
Buffalo,
all of them.
If you look at him,
the buildings,
they're very,
they're,

2024
02:09:18.230 --> 02:09:21.960
they're beautiful cities and you can see what they used to be and it's,

2025
02:09:21.961 --> 02:09:26.770
it's a fucking shame.
Um,
I dunno,
I dunno how to bring them back,

2026
02:09:28.330 --> 02:09:32.890
you know,
buy American,
which is why I'm going to get the fucking challenger.

2027
02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:34.271
Okay.

2028
02:09:34.271 --> 02:09:37.690
And if I find out that it's actually put together down and fucking Honduras,

2029
02:09:37.691 --> 02:09:40.870
I'm going to be fucking pissed.
All right.

2030
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:48.990
Al Challenger is dodge not put together in fucking whatever the fucking thing

2031
02:09:49.121 --> 02:09:53.770
is.
I'm going to learn Spanish,
God dammit.
And I'm going to have two podcasts.

2032
02:09:54.670 --> 02:09:59.320
I'll have one in fucking,
uh,
on glaze in one in fucking espanol.

2033
02:09:59.890 --> 02:10:02.410
Would that be great?
Then I could,

2034
02:10:02.550 --> 02:10:05.350
then I could actually trash people in their native language about how much

2035
02:10:05.351 --> 02:10:09.310
soccer is fucking boring.
All right.
