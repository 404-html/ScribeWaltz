00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:02.850
Hey,

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.420
Is Bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcasts from Monday,

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.680
May 16th,
2016 how's it going?
How are you?

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.440
How's your life?
Are you liking your life?
Are you enjoying your life?

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.340
Do you hate your life?
Would you like to make a change?
Well,

6
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:25.341
fortunately there's a solution with my new seven part eight track tapes.

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.160
I'll help you turn around your life by making me a rich motherfucker first thing

8
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:36.720
you do.
Um,
anyways,
I am in a great fucking mode.

9
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.650
It's actually a Sunday when I'm recording this.
When I'm recording this.

10
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.670
It's Sunday.
And,
uh,
I got the fucking

11
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.623
<v 2>shoes.</v>

12
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.823
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.640
<v 1>Juices are flowing.</v>

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.430
Blood is flying through my system right now.
Heart grade,
fucking wonderful.

15
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.133
You know why?

16
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.670
Cause I worked out the last two fucking days in a row and my brand new gerage

17
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:01.530
Raj,
fuck it,

18
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.553
<v 2>Jay.</v>

19
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.250
<v 1>Hello.
My New fucking gym.
It's finally done.</v>

20
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.390
I went back and I picked up my,
uh,
my truck.

21
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.420
You know my old fucking Ford truck that I had a in storage while they finished

22
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:21.390
it.
They did a phenomenal fucking job.
I,
I'll fit it.

23
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:24.540
The whole thing with a bunch of rogue fitness shit.
And um,

24
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.290
I never fucking show you my house.
I might have to make a video.

25
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.190
I might have to show is a little fucking chips,
a little cute.
Cim.

26
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.270
I'll give you a before and after,
you know,

27
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.150
I might even wear my leg warmers for you.
I'll give you a quick two second tour.

28
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.750
The God damn thing.
I got my atomic holds up top and a,
I got to tell you,

29
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:46.170
all freckles,
old freckles lost a lot.

30
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.870
A lot of what little he had.
Holy Shit.
I went onto the pegboard.

31
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.440
I felt like,
you know,

32
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.110
the 40 only first time you ever tried to do a pull up in your life.

33
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:55.830
It's like this.

34
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.860
It was like you were born without those muscles because you never use them.

35
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.520
You know what I mean?
It's not like you go,
oh,
what's on top of the fridge?

36
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.630
You know,
what do you do?
You jump up and down,
usually cash.

37
00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:07.140
You don't grab the top of it and fucking pull yourself up.

38
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.490
You little stupid feet squeaking on the front of the fucking weed as you try to

39
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:13.110
go up,
which is cheating by the way.

40
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.170
And if you ever made a video of it and you put it on Youtube,

41
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:20.430
I'm sure there would be hundreds of thousands of comments saying that it was an

42
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:25.260
epic fail refrigerator.
Uh,
pull up.
It's cause people like when you fail,

43
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.720
you know why?
Because they don't like themselves.
Um,

44
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.460
so it's done.
And uh,
I'm so fucking psyched.

45
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.860
Of course there's a few little doodads we've got to do.

46
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.620
Nia once an elliptical in there,
you know,

47
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.630
which is fucking hilarious to me because she could give a rats fucking ass about

48
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:49.500
this gym.
And still until it started coming together and now she loves it,

49
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.660
you know?
But what's great is it's the garage and everybody knows that the woman,

50
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.900
the wife,
the fucking,
the fucking lady over there,

51
00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:59.710
everybody knows that they get the house,

52
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.030
but the guy gets the garage and see the women think that they win because they

53
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:06.760
got the fucking house.
Right.
You don't want the house.

54
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.540
The house is where all the responsibility is.

55
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.260
The house is where the bills come to the houses where the fucking people knock

56
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:18.460
on the door and the cops come.
They go to the fucking house.
Nobody,

57
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.620
nobody goes to the garage.
The garage is fucking,

58
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.000
it's,
it's genius.
You know,
you act like it's a shit hole,
blah.

59
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:29.440
And we'd go up to the garage.
They're like,
yeah,
yeah.
Get out of the house.

60
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:32.390
They don't give a fuck.
You go into the garage at that said,
yeah,

61
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.010
she's getting no fucking idea.
You wait till I,
I,

62
00:03:35.011 --> 00:03:38.980
I get one of those little fucking Kegger raters out there and be doing keg

63
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:40.510
stands as I do curls.
Right.

64
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.770
Taking in calories as I burn them off at the same time while getting shit faced.

65
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.420
It's this new exercise video that I'm going to be putting out,
you know,

66
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.040
I dunno what I would call it to get what you need.
Alliteration,
right.

67
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.660
Drunk dips or some shit like that.
Right.
Just to get people to buy it.

68
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.950
Alcoholic aerobics as too wordy too now to worry too.
Two syllables.

69
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.060
I Dunno what I'll brainstorm on it.
You know,

70
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.200
all you gotta do is just have a fucking headband on and people will buy the

71
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:13.480
video.
If you promise them you're going to help him out,
right?

72
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.250
You have a fucking headband on,

73
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.950
they spray a little fake sweat on you and then you know,

74
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:21.910
all you got to get as a couple of hotties behind you just smiling and shit,

75
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.170
right?
The very least somebody can jerk off to it,

76
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.570
right?
The next thing you know,
they start flying off the fucking shelves.

77
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.070
And then what do you do yet?
You add onto the garage,
add on the garage.

78
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:39.700
I've told you guys forever my dream fucking house,

79
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.480
my dream house.
I don't even know what the house looks like.

80
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:47.260
I just know what the garage looks like.
The garage,

81
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.010
don't you say as my dad loved to say the garage Doe Isi would be a three car

82
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:58.240
garage,
right?
One for me,

83
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.020
one for her and the other for whatever.
My old fucking truck.
All right.

84
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.350
And then upstairs they all,
there'd be an upstairs.

85
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.350
The upstairs would have a gym.

86
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.960
It have a drum room and a fucking cigar bar slash fucking sports bar.

87
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.880
That's what it would be.
Okay.
One door in,

88
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:19.900
one door out,

89
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.730
maybe a fucking little ladder to go up onto the roof to buy you.

90
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.160
Right.
And that's,
I think if every fucking guy had that,
there's no fucking way.

91
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:33.760
You couldn't be a happily married man because he just could be in the house.

92
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.620
You got your kids running around.

93
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:38.230
Everybody's freaking the fuck out and he and I need a break.

94
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.630
I want to be fucking single,
you know,
without the whois.

95
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.660
I just want to fucking just sit a drink without you fucking people in my,

96
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.800
what's left of my hair.
That's where the upstairs comes in.

97
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.450
And then you just go up there.

98
00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.560
You have a great time while you slowly kill yourself,
you know?

99
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.850
And then with every cigar you smoke and every drink you have and you know that

100
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:07.490
you're one close,
one step closer to death,

101
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.300
which is a great thing because it's a release,
you know?

102
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.150
I don't know.
It started off happy.
It got a little dark there towards you.

103
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.930
You wouldn't know that.
I'm a happily married man,
uh,
by saying all that stuff,

104
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:22.880
but I also am by nature,
I am a fucking loner.
And,

105
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:26.990
uh,
you know,
I,
I just,
you know,

106
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:29.630
I just need to get away from people every once in a while and,
um,

107
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.990
I'll do that would be the fucking shit.
You know,

108
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.030
I have a couple of cool fucking dogs.

109
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.120
Those dogs at fucking lay around and like the howl,
you know,

110
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:42.380
like a fucking bloodhound,
right.
Just sit there watching the game,

111
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:45.530
getting hammered,
you know,
soundproof walls.
You can't hit your family.

112
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:48.680
He just sitting in there every once in awhile.
You look over your,

113
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.860
your fucking bloodhound.

114
00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:55.700
A rottie roughly what the dog would bark and join with you.
Yeah,
I'm,
yeah.

115
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:58.850
You fucking get it.
You fucking get it.
Right.

116
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.700
I hope you enjoyed that because that fantasy though,
man,
I,
that's it right there.

117
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.450
You know,
I don't know what it is.
Some people want the White House,

118
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:14.930
some people won a fucking Oscar.
And then some people just want,

119
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:18.620
we'd like to be able to get a Tan and have a two story fucking garage.
That's it.

120
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.060
You know?
Um,
I'm part of that third group,
part of the third group,
everybody.

121
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.460
So anyways,
um,
I fucking went down there,
um,

122
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.550
used all that rogue fitness shit that I bought and like I said,
you know,

123
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.680
these guys are not paying me or anything like that.

124
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:35.600
They actually sent me those colorful weights.

125
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:39.650
Now I don't know what the fuck to do with them cause I have more weight than I

126
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:44.180
need.
So I got some standup shows coming up in the La area.

127
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.540
If you're building a fucking gym,
you know,

128
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.520
and um,
oh,
how do I get,

129
00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:55.850
how do I make this a fair contest?
I don't fucking know.

130
00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.080
You build in a gym and you listen to the podcast and you want some colorful

131
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.660
plates,
some weights.
Uh,

132
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.960
I got them cause I was going to take it over to play it again.

133
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.960
Sam's have played against sports,
whatever the fuck they are,

134
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:11.270
but they just so God damn and Celtic,
you know what I mean?

135
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.780
If you think that baldheaded cont on the,
uh,

136
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:19.230
the pawn shop show how we just fucking,
you go in there and a man,

137
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.220
he got a bar of gold and the guy's like,
yeah,

138
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:25.190
you know how much you want for this?
You're like,
well,

139
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:30.050
the market value is fucking whatever.
Fucking $1,200 an ounce.

140
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.070
Why don't you give me a,
give me a thousand and outs?
And he's like,

141
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.830
so what you really want for it?
But I were on a fucking smash it over.

142
00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:39.890
You've got fuck yourself.

143
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.890
Like what a fucking business people coming in selling their old fucking hair

144
00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:46.580
dryers.
You know their ass out,
right?

145
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:49.480
And you've got to fucking take as much out of their crack as you can.
I get it.

146
00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:51.920
You know what?
It's a business.
I'm going to hotter than that guy.
God bless him.

147
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.690
God bless them.
All right,
so play it again.
Sports is the same fucking way.

148
00:08:56.691 --> 00:08:59.340
You'll come in with something with the price tag still on it and they'll go,

149
00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.660
yeah,
I'll give you like a dollar 50.
You know what I mean?
It's just like,
I mean,

150
00:09:02.661 --> 00:09:04.340
they make Richard Rollins look like a saint.

151
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.360
I mean,
these fucking guys bust you down so bad.

152
00:09:10.361 --> 00:09:11.980
It's like whatever you're selling them.
It's like,

153
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.050
how about I give to you for free,

154
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.990
but I get to hit you over the head with it first.
How about that?

155
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.490
Don't give me any fucking money.
I'm about to just mush it.
Right.

156
00:09:19.491 --> 00:09:22.390
And you're fucking,
I'm not doing that.

157
00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.910
So I would rather give it to a podcast listener for free,

158
00:09:24.911 --> 00:09:29.300
but I'm not shipping these fucking things.
Gets like,
uh,
I don't know what it is.

159
00:09:29.301 --> 00:09:33.980
I think it's two 45 pound plates to 30 fives.

160
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.760
I don't know what it is.
That fucking big and they're heavy.
That's all I know.
Um,

161
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.460
whenever they're free free weights.
So anyways,
um,

162
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:49.030
I went down there yesterday,
I did fucking chest and Tris.
Today I did the,
uh,

163
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.150
upper body stuff,
all the,
uh,
bodyweight shit.
Neither wanted the speed bag,

164
00:09:53.151 --> 00:09:55.550
which I thought was a little fucking stupid.
You know what I mean?

165
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.940
I always hated the speed bag unless you really training for a fight,

166
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.990
you know what I mean?
Do to do the,
then you go to your fucking cubicle.

167
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.600
It always seems so,

168
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.780
it just seemed fucking disrespectful to people actually fight for a fucking

169
00:10:11.721 --> 00:10:12.500
living.
Like the,

170
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.280
the level of respect that I have for people that do that for a fucking living.

171
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.810
Just the,
the,
the fucking courage it takes to do that.
Um,

172
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:25.190
but of course now it's up there and I'm down there.
What did that get?

173
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.560
That ball didn't dip abated,
but what it did,
data dump.
Look at that,

174
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:31.740
that fuck data,
that data that then I'm doing,
it popped back up,
up,
up.

175
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.310
So now of course,
now I'm going to get fucking obsessed with that shit.

176
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.540
I don't know where it's going to do for me.

177
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.660
I'm hoping it's going to bring my freckles out,
you know?
Um,
anyway,

178
00:10:40.661 --> 00:10:45.050
speaking of fights,
did anybody watched UFC?
You're upstream by day,

179
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:49.590
not of the red corner.
Did anybody see the UFC one 68,
eight,
eight,
eight?

180
00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.750
MMM.
Was basically,

181
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.540
I think the USA or the world versus Brazil.

182
00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.160
And I think Brazil once again proved that they are raw.
You know,

183
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.440
if you want to fucking get into a fight slash B in the missionary position with

184
00:11:05.441 --> 00:11:09.790
another person,
if you think you're coming out on top of it ain't happening.

185
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.270
They pretty much,
they pretty much dominated the fucking night.
But a,

186
00:11:13.271 --> 00:11:14.140
except for this one guy,

187
00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:16.960
and I'm not going to know the names and actually tweeted the guy,

188
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.300
I'm still not gonna remember his name.
He has a very fucking,

189
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.690
a unique name and it was fucking,

190
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.230
he's fighting this guy and this guy is making all these silly faces when he's

191
00:11:26.231 --> 00:11:28.420
going and they're going like the Brazilian dude,

192
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.170
I guess he was a champion or he is a champion.
That's right.
He's a champion.

193
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:36.730
And then he fucking,
uh,
that Jesus Christ that was having a few,

194
00:11:36.731 --> 00:11:40.090
when I was watching this,
he fucking,
he was fucking,

195
00:11:40.091 --> 00:11:42.640
he was a champion and he was supposed to fight.
He got hurt.

196
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.490
So he wanted to make sure he's 100% so he's coming down,

197
00:11:45.491 --> 00:11:47.290
he's making all these silly faces and shit.

198
00:11:47.291 --> 00:11:49.720
And I just remember the announcers go and like look,
and I was like,

199
00:11:49.721 --> 00:11:53.230
no biggest fighter.
He's had it for years and he's making faces.

200
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.050
The camera is not even nervous,
right.
All of this shit.

201
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.600
And then he comes to fucking white dude.
He fucking,
you know,
old Dudley do,
right?

202
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:03.210
He's got a police officer's haircut.

203
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.270
You like this guy could have been a state trooper and he's fucking comment down.

204
00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:07.991
And I'm like,
all right,

205
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:11.740
well let's see what's going to go on here at the white dude seems to be in a

206
00:12:11.741 --> 00:12:13.820
little better shape.
The Brazilian guy,

207
00:12:13.821 --> 00:12:16.750
surprisingly for a champion as a little bit of a dad bought,

208
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.730
you know what I mean?
And a whatever.
They start going at it and uh,

209
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.630
you know,
white boys taking it a little bit,
he's given it bag,
he's taking it,

210
00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:26.464
whatever.

211
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.850
Then all of a sudden the Brazilian guy starts just running at him and he fucking

212
00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:32.670
each one and he get in any regroups.

213
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.730
He starts running man again and this fucking guy,
the white to what?

214
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:40.570
The fucking state trooper haircut and he's backing up and as he's backing up,

215
00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:43.540
it gives them just a little fucking little right there,

216
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:46.090
Fred with the fucking a right hook.
Right?
Well,

217
00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:50.410
backing up and this fucking guy just,
he just shut off this guy's hard drive.

218
00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:55.300
He just fucking pip.
And the guy was just write down like a controlled implosion,

219
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:55.521
you know,

220
00:12:55.521 --> 00:12:59.260
when they take down a fucking building and everybody for some reason can take

221
00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:02.740
off work to go down and watch it,
you know,
that's what they wasted a sick day on.

222
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.390
Like,
Hey,
he's anyway,
I can breathe in that fucking,
uh,

223
00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.210
what do you call that shit,
not asphalt.
Oh Christ,
what the fuck do you call?

224
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:14.170
That shit is best dose,
right?
They can breathe it in anyways.

225
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.910
He fucking just hit the guy.
I keep just caught him the right way.
I mean,
granted,

226
00:13:18.911 --> 00:13:20.710
if he hit me with that,
I mean I would have been dead.

227
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.570
There'd be no podcast ever again,
you know?
Um,
but he just caught the guy,

228
00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:27.940
I guess.
Right.
And the guy just went right,
like a ton of bricks.

229
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:32.710
He fucking went down and the fucking white dude just lost it.
You know,

230
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.770
he just fucking,
who runs over to his corner climbs,

231
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.160
I thought was going to get on the fence.
He went right up and over,

232
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:42.550
hugged his halting and just kept screaming,
I'm a fucking world champion.

233
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.550
It was awesome.
Oh,
sorry.
Just blow out years here.
It was fucking awesome.

234
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.280
Do I get this too?
I think it's blue on my fucking ears.

235
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.750
It was just fun to see somebody like dad excited.
And uh,

236
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:58.030
then of course they said that he was from Cleveland.

237
00:13:58.031 --> 00:14:02.740
So I tweeted out Cleveland finally want to champion championship and a,

238
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:05.680
that's why I think that's what I tweeted out or something like that.
But,
um,

239
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.320
congratulations to that guy who I can put,

240
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:11.650
I don't not going to butcher his fucking name.
Um,

241
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.080
it was awesome to see him win a championship.

242
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.470
It's great for the city of Cleveland.
Right.

243
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.910
And even though it wasn't a team sport,
you know,
if you're in Cleveland,

244
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.700
you gotta be,
you won't be thinking this.
Cause you guys,
you know,

245
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:25.803
you've been beaten,

246
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:30.730
you've been beaten down by this sports gods for so long that you guys really,
uh,

247
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.230
you're afraid of having hope.

248
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.710
But I remember reading about Christopher Columbus when he came over to the,

249
00:14:37.891 --> 00:14:41.350
the the Americas,
which he thought was,
I dunno,
India.

250
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.850
I don't know what the fuck you thought.
Um,
before he got to land,

251
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:49.390
there was a couple of branches before he got the land and he started either,

252
00:14:49.391 --> 00:14:50.224
you know,

253
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.870
being nice to people are chopping off people's hands because they wouldn't give

254
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:58.700
them their gold fillings.
Uh,
depending on what movie you believe,
you know,

255
00:14:58.701 --> 00:15:01.220
I always loved that new studies find,
it's like,
what,

256
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:04.940
where the fuck was this information was it was an on a cocktail napkin and

257
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:09.260
somebody finally looked at it.
Huh?
Did you find one of those scrolls?

258
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:13.150
Was it written by somebody?
Hey,
by the way,
this is what really happened.

259
00:15:13.151 --> 00:15:17.570
And somebody just kept it for years and they just let the light go and go and go

260
00:15:17.571 --> 00:15:21.920
and then fall.
Maybe,
maybe the people that that survived what he did,

261
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.720
they had this shit written down.
I Dunno,
I think I'm fucking way off track here.

262
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.820
Where the hell am I?
Oh yes.
So anyways,

263
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:32.060
he's either way before he fucking got to land and he,

264
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:36.740
that was a halfway decent guy or an absolute fucking war criminal depending on

265
00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:41.030
what you believe.
Either way.
Don't you get the day off?
You know,

266
00:15:41.031 --> 00:15:43.310
sometimes people got to die to get a fucking day off.
You know,

267
00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:46.460
when you really think about it.
Um,
anyways,

268
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.110
the fuck was I talking about?
Yeah.
You see some fucking branches and shit.

269
00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:54.470
So there you go.
But guy from Cleveland is a champion.

270
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.480
All right.
It starts with once and now you gotta be looking at the Cavaliers.

271
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.530
I don't think they've lost yet.
You know,
it's funny.

272
00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:04.970
Everybody in Cleveland right now is going shot.
All right,
I'll shut up.

273
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:10.880
Just say it.
Um,
that's another weird city.

274
00:16:10.881 --> 00:16:14.390
Part of me wants Cleveland to win,

275
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.370
but there's just such a hilarious misery to the Cleveland Sports Fan.

276
00:16:19.371 --> 00:16:20.900
I almost want to see it keep going.

277
00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:26.630
So I guess I'm going to be happy either way.
I was really surprised at,
okay.

278
00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:30.140
See,
beat a beat.
The Spurs.
Um,

279
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.610
considering I never watched,
I just watched the Celtics,
but I was hoping that,
um,

280
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.650
I was hoping that,
uh,
Tim Duncan was going to get his sixth ring,
you know,

281
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.980
just so I'd have yet another thing to say to fucking Laker fans when they bring

282
00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:47.000
up Koby Bryant.
Well,
another guy during kobies time,
he was six.

283
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.100
He was a team player.
That one,

284
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:57.200
he really got everybody involved.
Uh,

285
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.460
did need fucking 90 million free agents to come in and help him out every

286
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:05.920
fucking year.
All right.
Sorry.
Anyway,
so let's plow ahead here.
Um,

287
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.340
what am I talking about here?
So,
yeah,
so congratulations.
And um,

288
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.570
I was disappointed with the Cyborg fight,
you know what I mean?

289
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.530
I would sit in there going like,
yeah,
I know.
I want to see this shit fight.

290
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:21.890
I want to see the,
you know,
and you know,
I got to tell you,

291
00:17:21.891 --> 00:17:24.170
the women's fights are usually better than the men's.

292
00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:27.120
I don't know why they go out,
like they go in and like fucking alley cats.

293
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.840
It's crazy.
Um,
I just don't understand how they can just hire,

294
00:17:31.841 --> 00:17:35.990
you can just kick somebody in with the barefoot and it doesn't hurt you too.

295
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:37.640
You know,

296
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.960
they should fucking have just regular people like me just go in and do MMA shit

297
00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:45.990
to each other and just watch this both crumble after the first strike punched

298
00:17:45.991 --> 00:17:50.810
once with your hand.
Ha Fuck.
You know,
you put in under your,
um,
anyways,

299
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:55.340
but she fought some chick.
She was like eight,
six,
and one.
So I'm like,

300
00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.440
what the fuck?
She's going to destroy it.

301
00:17:57.441 --> 00:18:02.000
This is going to be over in the first round.
And then Lo and behold,
Jesus,

302
00:18:02.001 --> 00:18:03.140
she fucking hits hard.

303
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:09.410
She fucking was just rain and punches.
And the other woman was,
was,
you know,

304
00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.710
still pool's getting hurt was still way better than I would have one jab and I

305
00:18:12.711 --> 00:18:15.350
would've been on my back,
but she was fucking eating them for well for a minute.

306
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:19.310
And then she went down.
And then there was a moment when she was always moving,

307
00:18:19.311 --> 00:18:23.180
but it looked like she was out and the guy stopped the fight.
Right.

308
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.410
Which he shut it.
I think it was right to stop the fight.
So in the end,

309
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.930
when they have the official decision,

310
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.640
they cut to her right now and everybody cheers,
gs Brazilian.

311
00:18:34.641 --> 00:18:38.510
It's a hometown crowd.
And when they cut to the other,

312
00:18:38.511 --> 00:18:43.370
the woman who lost sheets like holding back tears and she's just looking up,

313
00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:47.360
this is why I love this fight.
Or forever.
She was just looking up at the fucking,

314
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:52.260
the diamond vision thing,
whatever the big screen.
And she waited,
she,

315
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.970
she was on the scoreboard and the second she was on the scoreboard,

316
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:55.800
she just goes,

317
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.170
<v 3>I've never fucking tat tat</v>

318
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.690
<v 1>and the whole place Buddha.</v>

319
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:04.490
<v 3>Okay.</v>

320
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.520
<v 1>She was so fucking mad.
Um,</v>

321
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.220
which is understandable.
I mean,

322
00:19:10.221 --> 00:19:13.250
I can't imagine train in that fucking long and that God damn hard.

323
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.900
And then it's just over in like three minutes.
Um,
it must have been brutal,

324
00:19:17.901 --> 00:19:21.470
but um,
I dunno.
She was great.
She was all hard.

325
00:19:21.471 --> 00:19:23.150
So hopefully she'll come back or what have I done?

326
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:27.710
I was really into that last one and I,
that Cleveland Guy was hilarious.
He was,

327
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.710
he was talking to every,
he was like,
you know,
and I know everybody here,

328
00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:35.150
you don't like me because we're in Brazil,
but you guys make the sport great.

329
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.310
You called them out on it.
You know,

330
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.250
you're not voting for me cause I'm a fucking

331
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:45.170
cause I'm from Cleveland.
He should have been,
but I'm from Cleveland.

332
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.010
I'm used to this.
Um,
anyways,

333
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.650
let's see here.
I don't know if I have any advertising here.
Um,

334
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.850
hang on one second.
In the meantime,
I'll tell you a quick story.

335
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.480
You guys are all well aware that the,
uh,
the genius prince died.

336
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.110
Did you guys see that?
Do you get that and your papers just anyways,

337
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:11.090
out here in Beverly Hills,
they're having an auction on one of his guitars.

338
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.920
So yellow one that he did.

339
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.930
How many fucking times I got to type in my fucking password.
Come on.

340
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:23.570
Uh,
maybe cause I can't fucking remember it like that.
Fucked it up again.

341
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.760
Third Time's a charm,
huh?
Hmm.

342
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.440
I have to hum what it is or I fuck it up.

343
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.640
You imagine being this dumb and actually fucking having your own gym.

344
00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.060
It's kind of dangerous,
isn't it?
All right.
So e

345
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.010
they're actioning off one of his guitars.
It was the one that he used with the,

346
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.840
the new power generation,
the cream album,
I believe.

347
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.570
And somebody bought it a few years ago.
I can't believe it was even for sale,

348
00:20:48.571 --> 00:20:52.590
but some guitar collector admittedly doesn't play him.
He just collect some,

349
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.480
he paid 30 grand for this fucking thing.
So he says,

350
00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.680
I should read this word for fucking word.
This is so fucking priceless.

351
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.160
And he says like,
the reason why he's selling it is because,

352
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:12.210
you know,
it's become,
you know,
with the passing of prince,

353
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.900
it's become so valuable.
Um,

354
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:21.030
daddy's actually nervous to have it.
He's nervous to own the fucking thing,

355
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:25.170
right?
Which
fucking,
it's,
it's like,
dude,

356
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.060
why don't you just say,
you know what?
The Guy fucking just died.

357
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:34.950
Everybody's paying attention.
This is a great time to sell this fucking guitar.

358
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.870
I'm trying to make money off of this guy's death.
Um,

359
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.970
but can't you just say that?
You know,
I hear it.
Is Prince's guitar?

360
00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.230
All right,
I got to read what this guy said.
It's just so,
well,

361
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:53.000
there's nothing wrong with it.
You want to make a buck just,
you know,

362
00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:57.130
the guy died and I'm trying to make fucking money off of it.
All right.
Um,

363
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.090
but blah,
yellow
face goes.

364
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.970
I've been a prince fan since I was a little kid and that guitar always stuck out

365
00:22:04.971 --> 00:22:08.720
to me because it was super cool and stylish.
Said the current owner,

366
00:22:08.721 --> 00:22:12.500
we paid about 30 grand for it.
He said,
unfortunately,
as morbid as it is,

367
00:22:12.501 --> 00:22:15.050
when people pass,
their items become more valuable.

368
00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.830
I think something is valuable as this could be too risky to continue to have in

369
00:22:18.831 --> 00:22:22.340
my possession.
He's worried about his safety.

370
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:25.470
Get the fuck out of him and you try to make some money trying to make,
give me,

371
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:27.200
you're trying to make some money.

372
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

373
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:34.270
<v 1>That's so fucking creepy.
It's a really cool looking guitar,</v>

374
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:35.990
but I don't think I could own a guitar of,

375
00:22:35.991 --> 00:22:40.630
of a dead person who was way better at playing than I'll ever be.

376
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.940
Um,
I feel like that should be in like the rock and roll hall of fame so people

377
00:22:45.941 --> 00:22:49.150
could just go in and look at it.
Stay in your house.

378
00:22:49.151 --> 00:22:52.960
How fucking weird would that be?
Just having people over and people going.

379
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.240
Is that,
is it?
Yeah,
that's Prince's guitar.

380
00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.500
I would immediately be whispering to my wife going,
this guy fucking killed.

381
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.770
Let's get outta here.
Fuck.
Does he have his guitar?

382
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.400
It would immediately create me up,
but that's me.
You know,

383
00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:11.080
I'm paranoid son of a bitch.
He wants a fucking two story garage.
So me,

384
00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:14.380
do I not have any fucking reads this week?
I think I might have advertisers that,

385
00:23:14.381 --> 00:23:15.340
I don't know if you guys have noticed,

386
00:23:15.341 --> 00:23:19.300
but I have slowly but surely pissed all of them off.
Um,

387
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.800
no.
Well,
well maybe.
Maybe I do have some advertising.
He just hasn't sent it.

388
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:29.290
Nope.
I'm hitting the refresh button.
I don't fucking see it now.
You know what,

389
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:32.530
why are they so sense it don't,
they understand that if I shit on it,

390
00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:35.350
you guys actually listen to it and then maybe you'll buy it as opposed to just

391
00:23:35.351 --> 00:23:39.340
fast forwarding through all of it.
That's what I try to do.
I mean,
I'm just,

392
00:23:39.341 --> 00:23:43.390
you know,
I'm trying to help them make money right now.

393
00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.320
What the fuck are you going to do?
Well,
speaking of,
you know,

394
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.970
I played for about five,

395
00:23:47.971 --> 00:23:51.330
six years and then I stopped over the last couple of years when the downstairs

396
00:23:51.331 --> 00:23:54.930
was being redone and then I recently got back into it.
But,
you know,

397
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.810
this is the deal.
I play drums,
I fuck around and guitar and um,

398
00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:03.720
I've always wanted one of those lemon burst fucking,
uh,
Les Pauls.

399
00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:07.770
I'm trying to find one,
a lefthanded one.
I just think it's fucking,

400
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.400
I dunno,
but you know what kills me whenever I get to get a guitar,

401
00:24:11.401 --> 00:24:12.570
it was associate Les Paul.

402
00:24:12.571 --> 00:24:16.160
I just start thinking of all the fucking great music I've,

403
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:18.060
<v 0>yeah,</v>

404
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.030
<v 1>I've heard coming out of that thing and then when I pick it up,
it's just like,</v>

405
00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.230
oh Jesus.

406
00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:26.760
Am I the asshole that just bought a fucking guitar he doesn't deserve.

407
00:24:26.761 --> 00:24:30.960
I think I am.
All right,

408
00:24:30.961 --> 00:24:33.510
I'm going to pause here just if so I could just fucking,

409
00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:38.530
if I get advertising later,
I could just put it in here.
Um,
oh,

410
00:24:38.531 --> 00:24:42.210
maybe not.
So maybe if dealt,
see,
let's see what happens.
All right.

411
00:24:42.211 --> 00:24:45.660
Pausing here for some advertising that might be read later.

412
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:52.630
All right,
I'm back.
Did I read anything?
I Dunno.

413
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.520
I guess I'll find out later.
Anyway,
so,
um,

414
00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.970
it's only for 27 here,
Pacific coast time and in 33 minutes,

415
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.640
the blues,
San Jose Shacks,
fucking,
um,

416
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.070
game starts.
And um,

417
00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.790
I can't tell you how fucking excited I am about this and I already know how

418
00:25:12.791 --> 00:25:15.820
they're probably going to sell this game.
That's a tale of two cities,

419
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.190
two cities that I've never gotten over the hump there.

420
00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:23.710
Fans of add more heartbreak then a fucking blade blown up fucking spirit through

421
00:25:23.711 --> 00:25:28.600
the chest.
But one thing's for sure for one city,

422
00:25:28.601 --> 00:25:33.600
they'll be moving on to the Stanley Cup final,
not final.

423
00:25:33.601 --> 00:25:38.170
So as I always say,
the Stanley Cup final.
And for you,
the other team,

424
00:25:38.171 --> 00:25:40.990
more misery.
Well,
neither one should be ashamed.

425
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:46.450
Lave both knocked off between the toile humble to perennial giants in the west

426
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.820
with the La cakes and they'll fucking Chicago Black Hawks,
right?

427
00:25:49.821 --> 00:25:51.040
They're going to do some shit like that.

428
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:55.150
Somebody is going to make it to the Stanley Cup final.
I hate that.

429
00:25:55.151 --> 00:25:57.680
It's the final,
I like the finals and I hate when people go,
Ooh,

430
00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:00.020
there's only walleyball is all we want,

431
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.440
but there's seven games.
So finals.
Right.

432
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.230
I'd have no problem with that plural.
That's a great thing.

433
00:26:08.231 --> 00:26:09.540
You know when people go like,
yeah,

434
00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.860
all those countries over there in Europe or around the world go,

435
00:26:11.861 --> 00:26:12.740
why do you call it foot?
Yeah.

436
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.133
<v 0>You know,</v>

437
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.900
<v 1>ours makes sense.
It's football and somebody goes,
right?</v>

438
00:26:18.901 --> 00:26:21.120
If you want to be technical,
you should call it feet ball.

439
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.390
You use in both your feet.
What do you call it?
Football.
There you'd go.

440
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.560
You'd trouble right back and forth between your feet so much called football,

441
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.500
Fidi Ball,
footsie,
which called footsie.
In other words,

442
00:26:31.501 --> 00:26:34.920
why don't you go fuck yourself.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

443
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:38.250
I am really excited about this and,
um,
what I would like to do,

444
00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.150
don't you see is I would like to have,
uh,

445
00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.840
what am I giant ice cubes with some fucking booze in it cause I booze hard on

446
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:50.841
the weekends cause I fucking stare at a God damn script all week before I come

447
00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:54.180
home and booze heart,
who's getting to my drinking is out of control.
Um,

448
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.760
I think this is why people have children at some point in their life because if

449
00:26:56.761 --> 00:26:58.500
you don't,
you just drink yourself to death.

450
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.360
I'll tell you it's fun.
It's a lot funnier than shit diapers.
Um,
anyways,
I am,

451
00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:10.650
uh,
I'm nervous about this one.
I'm nervous.

452
00:27:10.651 --> 00:27:13.180
I had a belief that the blues were going to get by the Black Hawks.

453
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.840
I'm not kidding.
I'm much surprise.
And uh,

454
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.300
I had a belief that they could get by the,
uh,

455
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.380
the Dallas Stars and certainly what the goaltending issues,

456
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:27.090
which I didn't even know they fucking ad.
Um,
there's still went seven.

457
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.270
So I figured this when it makes sense that you get to the next,
each tie,

458
00:27:30.271 --> 00:27:31.470
you get a little blood tested.

459
00:27:31.471 --> 00:27:36.471
So I want to say whoever wins this is going to fucking win the Stanley Cup in

460
00:27:38.161 --> 00:27:41.250
the Stanley Cup,
Stanley Cup final.
Um,

461
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.700
but I was hanging out with Bart Nick last night and he knows more about hockey

462
00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:47.320
than I know about myself.
And he was saying that,
uh,

463
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.640
he thinks Tampa Bay lightning know even though their goaltender went down.

464
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.150
So we shall see.
Um,
I'm sticking with the blues.
Me.
Well,

465
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:59.610
we low me,
meet me at the fair,
I'm sticking with the blues,

466
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:04.410
that's my team.
And um,
cause my real team,
the Bruins didn't make it,

467
00:28:04.411 --> 00:28:04.981
but I still love him.

468
00:28:04.981 --> 00:28:07.830
I'm going to be there again in October and if they play the blues,

469
00:28:07.831 --> 00:28:11.610
I'm not going to give a fuck if they beat him fucking whatever,
12 to nothing.

470
00:28:11.611 --> 00:28:15.150
I won't give a shit.
Um,
speaking of which,
somebody sent me something about,
um,

471
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:15.901
you know,

472
00:28:15.901 --> 00:28:19.950
people always love to make points on all the dumb shit that I say on Twitter.

473
00:28:19.951 --> 00:28:22.650
Like,
I mean,
how many times do I have to admit that I'm a fucking moron?

474
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:27.030
You really don't need to correct me.
I realize that I'm an idiot,

475
00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:28.000
but somebody goes dictate.

476
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:32.280
It's not a lot of scoring and soccer and sends me like one day's worth of

477
00:28:32.281 --> 00:28:36.870
fucking scores.
It's just like,
okay,
well if you average it out,
I think I'm right.

478
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:43.020
You know,
you know what's funny about that fucking Leicester City Championship?

479
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:47.310
Do you now they found out that they won a championship cause to other teams

480
00:28:47.311 --> 00:28:51.600
played to like a one one tie.
There wasn't even a play off play off.

481
00:28:51.601 --> 00:28:55.830
There wasn't even a fucking play off.
Like here we go,
this is it.

482
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.130
We're down to the final two fucking teams.

483
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:04.200
We're going to play for 19 hours and hopefully at some point somebody's going to

484
00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:08.250
put the fucking ball and then in the net and the goal,
whatever,

485
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.630
and then it's going to be over.

486
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.710
Except it's going to be injury time that nobody knows what it is except for the

487
00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:17.820
fucking,
uh,
they'll refs and everybody starts whistling.

488
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.790
I didn't even have that.

489
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.470
They watched these two other teams play to with Tai and then everybody went

490
00:29:25.471 --> 00:29:29.250
crazy.
That seems really anticlimactic to me.

491
00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:31.470
I had to think he wants somebody to fucking kick the ball.

492
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.160
It goes into the fucking somebody scores.
Right.

493
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:41.040
And then collectively as sports fans,
you all fucking bust your nut.
No,
Haha.
I,

494
00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:46.070
it goes in
a bunch of people walking around and scarves,

495
00:29:46.071 --> 00:29:49.530
watching somebody with win,
get a fucking tie and then you're excited about that.

496
00:29:49.531 --> 00:29:53.510
And I,
I don't,
I,
I don't get that.
You know,

497
00:29:53.511 --> 00:29:57.020
you would think that a country that survived the fucking blitzkrieg like that

498
00:29:57.021 --> 00:30:00.020
level of excitement in your fucking life,
you think

499
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:05.950
you'd think use sports would,
would reflect it.
Maybe he hadn't.

500
00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.630
Maybe you have fucking grandparents had enough fucking excitement for one

501
00:30:08.631 --> 00:30:12.050
lifetime,
annual lifetime too.
So they just started watching that.
I don't know.

502
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.501
Well,

503
00:30:12.501 --> 00:30:15.440
maybe I don't understand enough about the game and I'm just a fucking moron.

504
00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:19.850
Maybe that's what it is.
And I don't know.
I have no idea what ever.
Go,

505
00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:23.210
go get some fucking fish and chips and go fuck yourself.
All right,
let's,

506
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:27.990
let's read some,
um,
let's read some,
uh,
some of this bullshit here,

507
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.020
but I got from this week,
oh,
by the way,

508
00:30:31.021 --> 00:30:34.290
I had a great weekend down and before I get to this,
I got an hour to fill,

509
00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:38.860
so don't worry about it.
Um,
I had a great weekend and I,

510
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:43.930
I've just been in a real slump as far as writing new bits just because,

511
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:49.040
uh,
my life has ground to a halt here.
It's like,
you know,

512
00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.080
I'm not going out.
I'm not doing anything.

513
00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:55.010
It's like my wife went to the Beyonce concert last night at,
uh,

514
00:30:55.011 --> 00:31:00.011
at the rose bowl and I was actually thinking I should have gone because there's

515
00:31:00.321 --> 00:31:03.380
no fucking way.
I wouldn't have got a bit out of that.
I would have felt old.

516
00:31:03.381 --> 00:31:05.390
It would've felt stupid.
I wouldn't know what the songs,

517
00:31:05.391 --> 00:31:07.880
when she come out fucking whipping or weave around and shit.

518
00:31:07.881 --> 00:31:12.230
That'd be something I could talk about.
Right.
Um,

519
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:17.460
but instead I went down to the comedy store and it did a couple of shows and,
um,

520
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.720
I actually went out,
let's have a comedians that are out there.

521
00:31:21.721 --> 00:31:26.721
And I was just so fucking sick of doing the same shit and trying to make it

522
00:31:26.821 --> 00:31:30.750
work.
I just,
every once in a while,
if you just go out there,

523
00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:32.370
<v 0>yeah.</v>

524
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:36.120
<v 1>And,
uh,
you're just not thinking anything and he just started fucking talking.</v>

525
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:40.560
It works way better and it breathes new life into all your jokes.

526
00:31:40.561 --> 00:31:43.920
I just kind of went out there and,
um,

527
00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.120
which is a very terrifying thing to do when you,

528
00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:50.640
if you've never done that in standup because you really feel like you're,
uh,

529
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:56.550
you know,
do you remember in like the Matrix when Keanu Reeves,

530
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:59.610
the trying to convince him to fucking step off that building and he's not going

531
00:31:59.611 --> 00:32:03.660
to fall to his death,
all he has to do is bully isn't it?
Was At that movie,

532
00:32:03.661 --> 00:32:05.530
it was a fucking Battlestar Galactica.

533
00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.010
Moonraker I don't know what the phone in those space movies,
right.

534
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:10.080
It wasn't even space but Scifi.

535
00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:11.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

536
00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:15.240
<v 1>Um,
he had to like,
believe it and if you believe it,</v>

537
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:19.200
then you find if you,
if you don't believe it,
you actually fall to your death.

538
00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.890
This is sort of one of those things,
but of course you're not going to die.

539
00:32:22.891 --> 00:32:23.820
You just going to,
you know,

540
00:32:23.821 --> 00:32:28.821
metaphorically die on stage is his basic stepping.

541
00:32:28.921 --> 00:32:29.061
Oh,

542
00:32:29.061 --> 00:32:34.061
off the building is basically just leaving your act behind and just fucking just

543
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:35.971
talking.

544
00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:40.410
So I just went out there and I just started riffing on fact that I made a smart

545
00:32:40.411 --> 00:32:44.520
move by not going to be on say,
because,
you know,

546
00:32:44.521 --> 00:32:46.560
when I went to Lady Gaga with my wife,

547
00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:48.383
<v 4>mmm.</v>

548
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.410
<v 1>You know,
I fucking,</v>

549
00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:56.320
I mean she was mad at me for like three fucking days after that one in defense

550
00:32:56.321 --> 00:33:01.160
of me,
which there really,
really is no defense.
I watched the Patriots,

551
00:33:01.161 --> 00:33:04.760
we lost I think to the ravens and the playoffs during the day.

552
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.850
So I was already drinking.
I already had that good six pack in me.
And then,
uh,

553
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.880
we took a car service to fucking lady Gaga and we went on the thing and it was,

554
00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:17.870
uh,
it's,
you know,
I'm all about seeing the band.

555
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.150
I want to see the drummer and all that type of shit.

556
00:33:20.151 --> 00:33:24.830
And she on this tour for whatever reason,
it's hard towards her choice,
whatever.

557
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.810
She had them in.
Like this house,

558
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.170
there was a fucking house and I couldn't see the drummer.

559
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:33.080
There was like a window.
I could kind of see his hands a little bit,

560
00:33:33.081 --> 00:33:35.660
a little bit of his head.
And that was it.
And it was just like,
what the fuck?

561
00:33:35.661 --> 00:33:40.370
I want to see the band.
And um,
I can't,

562
00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:41.690
it was so long ago.
I mean,
what the fuck?

563
00:33:41.691 --> 00:33:44.270
But I just started telling that story and how I fucking pissed her off.

564
00:33:44.271 --> 00:33:48.050
And then if I went to the Beyonce thing,
you know how I would,
I would just,

565
00:33:48.051 --> 00:33:50.180
you know,
you know,

566
00:33:50.181 --> 00:33:52.880
when they sang like that independent woman song and everything,

567
00:33:52.881 --> 00:33:53.780
just a dirty looks,

568
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:57.360
I'd be given most of the women there and no one that they were full of shit and

569
00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.840
that they shouldn't be putting their hands up in the air.
You know,

570
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.680
it was just a smart move that I didn't go.

571
00:34:06.681 --> 00:34:11.681
And my wife still has never gotten over my behavior at the lady Gaga concert to

572
00:34:11.811 --> 00:34:16.811
the point that I actually asked her to come on the podcast to talk about the

573
00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:19.460
Beyonce concert.
And she just goes,
no.

574
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.630
And I tried not to laugh.
I tried to hold it together and I go,

575
00:34:23.631 --> 00:34:27.140
what do you mean though?
She goes,
we think I'm a fucking idiot now.
She goes,

576
00:34:27.141 --> 00:34:30.340
I'm not going on the podcast and give you,
giving you a,

577
00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:34.000
an opportunity to start trashing beyond sake.
I'm not going to trash Beyonce.

578
00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.193
Okay.

579
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.890
I have to admit,
she started showing me

580
00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:49.620
video clips of the concert and she had it like the way she was holding,

581
00:34:50.451 --> 00:34:52.590
she was,
we were on the couch and she snuggled up next to me.

582
00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:56.620
So she's holding the kind of low to my,
you know,
near my stomach.

583
00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:01.600
And like three times I started laughing,
looking at the,
uh,

584
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.823
<v 4>yeah,</v>

585
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:05.850
<v 1>looking at the clips.
Um,
and look,
dude,</v>

586
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.560
I know she's way more talented than I could ever be out and I don't even

587
00:35:08.561 --> 00:35:09.700
remotely put it on a Shiller care,

588
00:35:09.701 --> 00:35:14.701
but it's just something funny to me about when everybody dances in unison and

589
00:35:14.951 --> 00:35:17.440
they have that,
you know,
that angry look on their face.

590
00:35:17.441 --> 00:35:21.160
It's just the funniest assist.
Like what is your,
what is the problem

591
00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:26.170
coming up?
And they got their arms out,
you know,

592
00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.590
and they're doing that little fucking thing with their head and their feet are

593
00:35:29.591 --> 00:35:32.350
running.
Uh,
it's just,
I can't,

594
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.950
I can't even dance like the fucking nerve of me to laugh at it.

595
00:35:35.951 --> 00:35:40.210
But it always strikes
is just,
it's,

596
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:43.260
it's absolutely ridiculous.
Something,
it's,

597
00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:45.930
I understand why it's awesome and people appreciate it,

598
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:50.940
but it's also really fucking funny to me.
I should say.

599
00:35:50.941 --> 00:35:53.970
I don't know why.
Maybe I get one,
I'm just a cut.
Don't listen to me,
so whatever.

600
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:58.590
So I made a great fucking move by not going to that concert.

601
00:35:58.591 --> 00:35:59.760
Made a very smart,

602
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:05.130
married a couple of years getting a wise in my old,
I just was just like,

603
00:36:05.131 --> 00:36:08.070
you know what?
I can,
that's,
that's the best.
When you start,

604
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:11.940
you start to know somebody and yourself well enough to be like,
you know what?

605
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:15.570
I see the fight coming.
You know what I mean?
It's actually,

606
00:36:15.571 --> 00:36:17.730
it's like slipping punches,
which I,
there's something else,

607
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:19.320
another reason why I suck at fighting escape.

608
00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.180
You could literally tell me on Thursday,

609
00:36:21.181 --> 00:36:26.181
I'm throwing this punch at this time and you would still not only catch me with

610
00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:29.670
it,
you like the feel whole hand or foot or whatever.

611
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:36.120
I just can't do it.
I,
I,
you know,
whatever,
I stink at it.
So,

612
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:39.840
um,
I saw this fight coming and I was just like,

613
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.040
I was like,
all right,
no.
And I gave my,
you know,

614
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:45.120
my ticket away and she took one of her girlfriends.

615
00:36:45.121 --> 00:36:48.660
So I look good with the friends and all of that fucking shit.

616
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.720
And I avoided a major fucking fight and I just went on stage cause I was like,

617
00:36:54.301 --> 00:36:57.720
I'm sick of my jokes.
That was the point of this shit.
I'm sick of my jokes.

618
00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:02.580
So whenever I get into this,
these,
um,

619
00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:06.670
whatever you call it,
writer's block,
even though I don't write whatever,

620
00:37:06.671 --> 00:37:10.270
just riffing block,
I guess cause I just sort of wing my shit.

621
00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:11.803
Um,

622
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:13.180
<v 0>yeah.</v>

623
00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.270
<v 1>I just say to myself,
what am I thinking right now?
What am I feeling?</v>

624
00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:17.861
And I was feeling,

625
00:37:17.861 --> 00:37:20.860
thank God I didn't go to Beyonce because me and my wife would get into a big

626
00:37:20.861 --> 00:37:25.060
fight.
So,
and you know,
it's funny,
I didn't even make that decision.

627
00:37:25.061 --> 00:37:28.140
I kind of as I was don my rare brought me up.
Yeah.

628
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.680
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

629
00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.020
<v 1>He gives the best fucking intros.
He said,
this fucking enjoy goes,
you know,</v>

630
00:37:33.021 --> 00:37:37.120
it's next guy coming to the stage.
Uh,
you know,
he never made me laugh.

631
00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.240
You know,
immediately people would just die.
They just fucking,

632
00:37:40.241 --> 00:37:43.400
he just does that stuff.
But,
you know,
people seem to enjoy him.
Um,

633
00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.680
I dunno.
I've written a lot of his stuff and just,
you know,

634
00:37:47.681 --> 00:37:49.390
just making me look like a complete asshole.

635
00:37:49.391 --> 00:37:53.380
So I went out there and it wasn't until after I shook his hand that I was

636
00:37:53.381 --> 00:37:56.770
actually thinking of the first bit I was going to do and I was just like,
Oh God,

637
00:37:56.771 --> 00:37:59.380
I can't,
I can't,
it's physically going to feel like shit coming out of her mouth.

638
00:37:59.381 --> 00:38:02.770
I can't even say it.
And then I just,

639
00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:06.430
over the years of just knowing that trick,
I was just like,

640
00:38:06.431 --> 00:38:08.290
what am I feeling right now?
It's just I'm feeling,

641
00:38:08.291 --> 00:38:11.410
I'm glad I fucking did go to Beyonce because I get new a three day fight with my

642
00:38:11.411 --> 00:38:16.411
wife and I just started talking about that and it just,

643
00:38:16.601 --> 00:38:17.434
it worked.

644
00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:22.890
And then I had this other chunk of material and I did the last joke without even

645
00:38:23.951 --> 00:38:26.610
setting it up from the other shit.
And it's still worth it.

646
00:38:26.611 --> 00:38:31.450
We just worked in a different way.
And um,
it was,

647
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:34.180
it was great.
It may be fucking love standup again cause I was really,

648
00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:38.630
no guy would ever hate standup but just this whole fucking writing every day.

649
00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:40.453
All right.

650
00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:45.230
<v 5>All right.
Now see the magic of technology is now</v>

651
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.590
10 oh one Pacific coast time.

652
00:38:49.591 --> 00:38:53.940
And I'm watching the third period of a Saint Louis,

653
00:38:53.941 --> 00:38:58.100
San Jose.
Um,
I take the fucking game.

654
00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:04.100
What's the first two periods?
One St Louis so far.
All right.
Let's see.

655
00:39:04.101 --> 00:39:08.670
Have you spoken as,
get on with the fucking sports here.
All right.

656
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:15.410
Uh,
you need to know how to cook when she got a broad your license.

657
00:39:15.411 --> 00:39:17.130
She's old school.
She know what I mean.

658
00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.520
Not only do you feel like you know your way around the kitchen,

659
00:39:20.521 --> 00:39:21.480
but cooking at home,

660
00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:26.370
eating healthier and saving money instead of ordering expensive takeout all over

661
00:39:26.371 --> 00:39:31.140
again.
But where do you start?
Blue Apron as you covered?

662
00:39:31.141 --> 00:39:35.220
Fuck for the last 10 or less than $10 per meal.

663
00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:39.210
Blue Apron delivers all the fresh ingredients and you need to create a home

664
00:39:39.211 --> 00:39:42.300
cooked meal.
Just follow the easy step by step instruction.

665
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.930
He's me of actually look really good.
Uh,
we,

666
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.360
this was around when I was a single seller.
Uh,

667
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.920
each meal can be prepared in 40 minutes or less.

668
00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:53.910
No overwhelming trips to the grocery store,
no more sad takeout.

669
00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:58.470
And that a how dietary preferences,
no matter your dietary preferences,

670
00:39:58.471 --> 00:39:59.191
Blue Apron,
Nix.

671
00:39:59.191 --> 00:40:04.191
It a bleed and prepared dishes like salmon with asparagus and new potato Hash

672
00:40:06.781 --> 00:40:10.050
and me Aov right in your own kitchen.

673
00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.170
I don't even know what happened.
That is,
what's up.
Fuck is they only

674
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.310
cook with the ingredients that you've never used before.
Like watermelon,

675
00:40:23.311 --> 00:40:25.860
radishes,
Pharaoh,
Pharaoh,

676
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:31.310
modal and purple potatoes and recipes are between 500 to 700 calories per

677
00:40:32.701 --> 00:40:35.760
portion.
Delicious and good for you right now.

678
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.250
You could get your first two meal for free.
Yes,

679
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:41.150
we wait for dotcom slash for that blue apron,

680
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.850

Oh,

681
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:52.570
Me On de Leon d no more sweaty balls to do.

682
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.980
Me On d and B's.
I'm drinking them.

683
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:57.880
Maker's mark towards down the fund.

684
00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:02.730
Off My fucking underwear dries up real quick and I don't care my ball good bronc

685
00:41:02.731 --> 00:41:03.001
in.

686
00:41:03.001 --> 00:41:07.890
So am I by the fucking 10 your queen is all right here.

687
00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.530
Whether you're wearing a suit or

688
00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:14.080
whether you're wearing a suit or

689
00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:20.470
you spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear unless you Matthew mcconaughey

690
00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:21.540
and then you're wearing that.

691
00:41:21.541 --> 00:41:25.710
She is running down the beach carrying a couple of hard whenever the fuck it is

692
00:41:25.711 --> 00:41:29.010
he does on TV.
That's a magazine anyway.

693
00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:32.280
But instead of making a statement like trouper man,

694
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:37.370
everyday clothes,
your underwear is probably boring.

695
00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.880
The undies is here to change that.
Well you know what she,
what it has on the way,

696
00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:43.160
it's pretty boring as it is.

697
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.950
Just read know so you know this fucking name on it.

698
00:41:45.951 --> 00:41:48.110
That's when it gets interesting.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:01.130
Every pair of me undies is made from sustainable mode out of dress fabric twice

702
00:42:01.131 --> 00:42:02.420

741
00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.500
<v 1>Let's get to some questions here for this week.</v>

742
00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:57.540
Oh,
um,

743
00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:02.880
speaking of which,
how great his song,
his top Jimmy.
I fucking love that song.

744
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:06.350
All right,
so I Annika.
Hey,
Bill,
love your podcast.

745
00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:11.560
I want him to tell you about my sister's cure for s a Sayada ACOG lie but don't

746
00:45:11.561 --> 00:45:14.010
worst.
Okay.
Cloud,
um,

747
00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:18.260
providence say chat and I one night only shy

748
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:23.660
my ass fucking
um,

749
00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:28.310
she suffered from Sciatica for years.
For years.

750
00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:31.940
Her doctor recommended she see a podiatrist.

751
00:45:31.941 --> 00:45:36.350
That's a foot doctor for all you civilians out there who filmed her from behind

752
00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:41.630
fucking creep as she walked on a treadmill.
Yeah.

753
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.670
What are these yoga pants,
by the way?

754
00:45:43.671 --> 00:45:48.020
I don't understand why guys are fucking so obsessed with yoga pants.

755
00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.040
I've never been yoga pants or like just,
you know what?

756
00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:53.720
I took too many yoga classes.

757
00:45:53.721 --> 00:45:56.900
I just know what the room smells like and I just feel like that's what you clamp

758
00:45:56.901 --> 00:46:00.900
smells like when you wear those.
And I know that's immature.
I'm sorry.
Um,

759
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:05.180
he immediately saw her right foot was rolling out is she walked,

760
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:10.750
he said this was causing her problems with Sciatica and he made custom orthotics

761
00:46:12.711 --> 00:46:15.560
shoes,
inserts that she wears most of the time.

762
00:46:15.561 --> 00:46:20.561
She said this worked immediately to completely eliminate her pain from Sadeka.

763
00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:25.640
Ooh,
she said,
after you start wearing the orthotics,

764
00:46:25.641 --> 00:46:30.350
you should visit a chiropractor to get everything back in alignment and you're

765
00:46:30.351 --> 00:46:35.300
good to go.
Give it a try and go fuck yourself.
Thank you so much for that.
Um,

766
00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:36.560
I don't think I have that issue,

767
00:46:36.561 --> 00:46:39.320
but I got the name of a good chiropractor and you know what,

768
00:46:39.321 --> 00:46:41.570
God dammit when I'm uploading this podcast,

769
00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:46.910
I'm actually going to go see a doctor because somebody sent me this thing on,
um,

770
00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:50.030
on Twitter.
Go Bill,
go see a doctor.

771
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:52.580
Jesus did we learn nothing from so and so.

772
00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.140
And it was somebody who was on Letterman who was,

773
00:46:55.141 --> 00:46:57.890
she had a shortness of breath and he kept blowing it off.

774
00:46:57.891 --> 00:47:00.140
He kept talking to people who weren't doctors and they're like,

775
00:47:00.141 --> 00:47:01.430
I'm sure you're fine.
I'm sure you find.

776
00:47:01.431 --> 00:47:02.990
Then he found out it was fucking lung cancer.

777
00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:08.180
Obviously that's not what I'm looking at here.
Um,
all right.

778
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.470
Uh,
so I will definitely go.
Oh,
thank you for that.
All right,
number two,

779
00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.810
uh,
Duke

780
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:21.350
where we'll Katelyn take his shit this week.
Um,
number two.
Hi Bill.

781
00:47:21.351 --> 00:47:26.351
I was a wall and floor Tyler for 27 years and my go to for any lower back pain

782
00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:31.780
was a gel ice pack in lying on a hard floor.

783
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:37.140
The Gel pack molds to the area that is sore and the hard floor keeps you spine

784
00:47:37.631 --> 00:47:40.540
flat.
Lie on your back.
Wait,

785
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:43.930
lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent.

786
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.900
Put the ice.
No.
What does that mean?

787
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:51.870
They bend and then lift them up or just to have the feet on the floor.
Um,

788
00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:57.310
can you put your foot down on the two?
Get jump up on the one.
Sorry.

789
00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:02.540
Thinking about prince now.
All right.
Um,
then we'll the ice pack and then try it.

790
00:48:02.541 --> 00:48:05.620
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
I missed the whole fucking thing.
It lie on your back,

791
00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:06.683
<v 0>right?</v>

792
00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:10.040
<v 1>You know what it is?
He wrote a bunch of words that are all like the same.</v>

793
00:48:10.041 --> 00:48:13.610
I have some sort of fucking dyslexia because he has lie like a bunch of times

794
00:48:13.611 --> 00:48:16.820
and feet lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent.

795
00:48:16.821 --> 00:48:20.360
Put the ice pack at the spot,
giving you trouble.
Leave it there.
Oh,

796
00:48:20.361 --> 00:48:23.930
I know why he didn't have any punctuation.
Leave it there for 15 minutes.

797
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:28.760
You can watch TV doing this then moves the ice pack and then try to feel like

798
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.970
you are pressing your spine into the floor.

799
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:35.660
Continue with the treatment once or twice a day until you feel better.

800
00:48:35.661 --> 00:48:36.770
I hope this works for you.

801
00:48:36.771 --> 00:48:41.180
I loved F is for family and reminded me of my childhood and I'm a 57 year old

802
00:48:41.181 --> 00:48:44.870
Australian male.
Love the specials and the podcast.
Hope you get better soon.

803
00:48:44.871 --> 00:48:47.750
Well that's good to know.
So you're 10 years older than me.

804
00:48:47.751 --> 00:48:51.110
Well that should work because we kind of age bill a little bit older than I than

805
00:48:51.111 --> 00:48:56.111
I was in 1973 or 74 he's about 11 years old and which would mean he would have

806
00:48:56.361 --> 00:49:01.270
been,
would have been born in 62 so that's right in your wheelhouse,

807
00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:04.400
right?
You probably be born and like what,

808
00:49:04.401 --> 00:49:09.020
58 59 yeah,
built.
That's how the math works out.
All right,
cool.

809
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:12.370
Um,
okay.
Australia mailable for,

810
00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.080
thank you so much for watching and please tell more people down there in

811
00:49:15.081 --> 00:49:17.030
Australia.
If you can to check it out.
Um,

812
00:49:17.031 --> 00:49:19.970
I actually heard a lot of times people say to put heat on your back ice,

813
00:49:19.971 --> 00:49:24.050
I guess is better.
Uh,
cause it,
if you have any sort of,
uh,

814
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:26.570
inflammation in the nerve or something like that.
I Dunno.

815
00:49:26.571 --> 00:49:30.470
I've been using a leaf and doing these stretches,
I feel much better.

816
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:32.840
And I haven't been sitting down at all.

817
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:37.190
I've actually been squatting like a Vietnamese gambler and,
um,

818
00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:41.930
I don't know.
I,
uh,
that's been working for me in these stretches.

819
00:49:41.931 --> 00:49:45.980
I still haven't quite
gotten it better,
but I'm going to walk,

820
00:49:45.981 --> 00:49:50.300
go to a chiropractor and get adjusted out Jesus.
And you know what?
I that,

821
00:49:50.301 --> 00:49:54.740
and I also need glasses finally giving into that because my,
um,

822
00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:00.410
every two years when you're at my advanced age,
you got to go get a physical,

823
00:50:00.411 --> 00:50:03.920
physical.
I want to get physical.

824
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:10.250
Um,
I got my pilot's license.
So you got to every,
you know,

825
00:50:10.251 --> 00:50:14.030
if you're a younger fella,
every floor lady lady,
every five years you,
you,

826
00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:17.840
you got to renew your medical,
um,
you gotta get it updated.
So with me,

827
00:50:17.841 --> 00:50:20.960
it's every two fucking years and I barely made it through.

828
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:24.500
And I'm literally like,
what the fuck am I doing here?

829
00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:27.530
I don't want to wear glasses,
just don't,

830
00:50:27.531 --> 00:50:29.720
I just don't want to have another fucking thing that I have to deal with.

831
00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:34.580
And I also have this paranoia that all glasses do is make you fucking eyes

832
00:50:34.581 --> 00:50:39.500
worse.
Kind of like a chap stick.
It just dries out your lips even more.

833
00:50:39.501 --> 00:50:41.990
That's like the big urban myth.
And then you get addicted to it,

834
00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:46.340
then he got to use it.
You know,
whenever I have dry ass lips,

835
00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:50.120
I just use a little Vaseline works like a fucking charm and then I just started

836
00:50:50.121 --> 00:50:51.650
pounding waters and then you're fine.

837
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:56.150
You fucking fine that fucking chapstick and all that shit.

838
00:50:56.151 --> 00:51:00.080
I don't like it and don't like it makes me have weird dreams,
you know,

839
00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:03.200
get that chemical in there and seeps right in the fucking face and it goes right

840
00:51:03.201 --> 00:51:04.490
to your brain.
And next thing you know,

841
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:08.290
you're just running around with an ax and your drinks.

842
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:12.980
You have to have a dream like that.
So raise a year screaming,
answer me.

843
00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:19.160
Uh,
I'm just making this shit up.

844
00:51:19.161 --> 00:51:21.470
People out.
I don't know what the fuck you want from me.
Usually the,

845
00:51:21.471 --> 00:51:24.320
the advertising takes up a little bit of time and I,

846
00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:29.330
and I don't have any full 48 another 12 minutes and then the game stats.

847
00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:35.270
Oh,
and I got another 15 minutes here.
Fuck.
Well thank you.
Thank God for Tivo,

848
00:51:35.271 --> 00:51:40.040
right?
All right.
Grass killin name.
Alright.

849
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.810
A fantasy,
revenge advice.
Hello billion.

850
00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.490
I'm a 23 year old male.

851
00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:50.840
I live with my parents in the country that even Australia makes.

852
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:55.760
Oh Wow.
They even Australia makes fun of two from a Australians here.
Oh,

853
00:51:55.761 --> 00:51:57.410
New Zealand.
Oh Jesus.

854
00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:01.040
I live with my parents in a country that even Australia make fun of New Zealand.

855
00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:03.950
I thought he meant a part of a country.
I can't read people.

856
00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:07.160
I love emphasis for family and can't wait for season two.
Thank you so much.

857
00:52:07.161 --> 00:52:09.890
Please tell more people in New Zealand about it if you haven't already,

858
00:52:09.891 --> 00:52:11.690
if he got the time.
I'm not trying to put you out.

859
00:52:11.691 --> 00:52:14.660
If you don't want to be that Douche,
don't be the Douche.
But if you do,
I'd,

860
00:52:14.661 --> 00:52:19.130
I'd appreciate it.
All right,
so here we go.
Fantasy,
revenge advice.

861
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:25.210
Sometime ago my father was using a lawn trimmer on the right side of the front

862
00:52:25.911 --> 00:52:26.301
yard,

863
00:52:26.301 --> 00:52:30.500
which is only a few feet from our neighbor's driveway while trimming the edges

864
00:52:30.501 --> 00:52:34.820
of small rock in the grass shutout and hit our neighbors parked car in the

865
00:52:34.821 --> 00:52:35.654
driveway.

866
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:39.260
Our neighbor was already at the front of his house and either saw or heard the

867
00:52:39.261 --> 00:52:42.890
bang and started yelling at my dad who was apologetic.

868
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.980
The rock the Rock,
put a small dent in the car,

869
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:50.750
which was hard to see even close up when I,
when I was told what happened,

870
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:54.230
my dad by my dad,
I was a little pissed that he yelled,

871
00:52:54.231 --> 00:52:57.800
but I knew he had a right to be upset and although it was an accident,

872
00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:03.010
my dad would happily pay for the damages because he knew he was at fault.

873
00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:07.730
Um,
our neighbor didn't talk to us again about a bill or anything,

874
00:53:07.731 --> 00:53:11.360
so we've quickly forgot about it and moved on.
A few weeks later,

875
00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:15.350
I was at the front of our house and I saw that the right side of our lawn was

876
00:53:15.351 --> 00:53:18.320
completely dead,
of foot inwards.

877
00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.820
I realized this fucking cunt had poisoned the area of the grass that would

878
00:53:22.821 --> 00:53:27.560
usually be cut using the trimmer.
Wow.

879
00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:30.320
This guy's got major communication issues.

880
00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.220
So this incident would never happen again to state my,

881
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:38.150
despite my dad telling him that he would only mold alon when the driveway was

882
00:53:38.151 --> 00:53:40.190
empty in the future.
Um,

883
00:53:40.191 --> 00:53:44.900
I asked my dad if he knew anything and he told me he had known for a few days

884
00:53:44.901 --> 00:53:46.580
but didn't want to make a big deal about it.

885
00:53:46.581 --> 00:53:50.420
My Dad is a very easy going guy who doesn't get bothered much myself on the

886
00:53:50.421 --> 00:53:53.040
other hand,
spent the night,
uh,

887
00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:56.270
the next few nights fantasizing about revenge.
Oh,

888
00:53:56.450 --> 00:54:00.790
it looks like you take after your Ma.
All right.
Get Dad's easy going.

889
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:06.050
He married a fucking hot blooded woman and she's,
you know,
she calmed her down,

890
00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.710
right?
And then you,
you,
you,
you got her fucking DNA.
All right.
I like,

891
00:54:09.711 --> 00:54:12.980
I like where this is going so far,
even though I'm not a big revenge guy.

892
00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:17.630
You Dad's easygoing.
It's his house already.
My Gut saying your dad's easy going.

893
00:54:17.631 --> 00:54:20.700
It's his fucking house,
you know?
Um,

894
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:22.140
<v 0>yeah.</v>

895
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.480
<v 1>Don't do anything to disrupt it.
And you said it.</v>

896
00:54:24.481 --> 00:54:26.790
I thought about doing the exact same thing to his lawn,

897
00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:31.680
but spelling out the word coward.
Oh my God.
That's fucking hilarious.

898
00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:36.150
I thought about pulling out all of his plants and dumping it on his car to send

899
00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:36.984
a message.

900
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:40.230
It's been a few months and I still get pissed off when I think about it,

901
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.100
but I decided not to stoop to his level and pull off a bitch move like that.

902
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.170
The only option would be to confront him,

903
00:54:46.171 --> 00:54:50.040
but there is no scenario in which that would end.
Well,
why not?

904
00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:56.170
Um,
why not?
Why can't you just next time you see him,
just say like,
dude,

905
00:54:56.171 --> 00:55:00.220
I got to tell you something.
I haven't been on this planet for a long time,

906
00:55:00.221 --> 00:55:03.220
so maybe I need to see more bitchy behavior,

907
00:55:03.221 --> 00:55:06.340
but that's the biggest pussy bitch fucking way.
I don't do that.

908
00:55:06.341 --> 00:55:09.580
It's going to cook.
I don't know.
I would just say,
hey,

909
00:55:09.581 --> 00:55:13.630
you have any idea why this part of the lawn died?
Isn't that amazing?

910
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:16.030
And I would do that to them every fucking time.

911
00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:18.670
Just do something to drive him nuts.
Anyways,
he goes,

912
00:55:18.671 --> 00:55:20.650
I've decided to do nothing and moving on,

913
00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:23.470
but it's been about a year and I'm still thinking about it.

914
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:27.460
What would you have done?
Am I justified to be pissed?
This pissed?

915
00:55:27.461 --> 00:55:31.870
And how the fuck do I stop myself from letting it get me in such a bad mood

916
00:55:31.871 --> 00:55:35.980
every time I walked past our front lawn and see the dead strip of launch?

917
00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:40.720
Thanks for listening,
Bill.
Come back to New Zealand.
Um,
your lawn is still dead.

918
00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:44.740
Look,
I'm not big on revenge,

919
00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:48.490
but the great thing that you have right now is you've waited a year.

920
00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.440
<v 0>Um Hm.</v>

921
00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:53.150
<v 1>So if you were to do anything,</v>

922
00:55:53.151 --> 00:55:56.700
obviously don't bring any physical harm to the person.
Um,

923
00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:58.520
he does seem to love that car.

924
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:03.140
It's just why would you do it?

925
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.193
<v 0>MMM.</v>

926
00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:08.140
<v 1>Why don't you guys read,
just replant the fucking grass.</v>

927
00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:12.700
That's what I would do.
I would replant the grass.
This is what you do.

928
00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:17.280
Replant the grass
and get all excited.

929
00:56:17.281 --> 00:56:20.820
And then without him knowing what you do is you set up a fucking video camera,

930
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:25.770
all right?
And he just videotape and you,
you try to catch them doing it.

931
00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.870
That's the best way to do it,
right?

932
00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:31.290
And then he has to fucking pay for it and then pay for the previous thing.

933
00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:34.230
The previous time he poisoned it.
Like that's what I would do.

934
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:36.840
You know what I mean?
There's obvious things that you could do.

935
00:56:36.841 --> 00:56:40.740
You could go to a fucking auto zone and buy one of those little catch trays that

936
00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:45.390
captures oil,
you know?
And then when the night you could undo his fucking

937
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:48.420
let all the oil out of his car on,

938
00:56:48.421 --> 00:56:51.570
screwed the thing on the oil pan and you screw it back up.

939
00:56:51.571 --> 00:56:56.120
And then he seizes the edge on his car.
You can go that route.
You know,

940
00:56:56.121 --> 00:56:59.660
there's no oil in the fucking car.
Um,

941
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:04.120
the key is what you have to do is

942
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:05.403
<v 0>okay,</v>

943
00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:08.690
<v 1>he would still figure it out.
So you can,</v>

944
00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:11.990
you can't do this is all bitchy fucking moves.
You know what I mean?

945
00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:13.670
You got to have a face to face thing.

946
00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:15.860
Or what I would do is I would just repaint three,

947
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:19.970
plant the grass and I would set up a fucking video camera

948
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.160
and maybe just say that.
Just say,
hey,
just so you know,

949
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:25.230
if you plan on poison Eric Grass,

950
00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:29.190
cause I know you're not a man and you would never say anything to my dad's on my

951
00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:33.930
self's face.
You know,
just so you know,
I got this security,

952
00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.930
you're going to be on video and we're going to catch you doing it.
Okay.

953
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.970
All right.
It costs us a lot of money and I,
I,
oh my God,
what a,
uh,

954
00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:46.350
in a perfect world,
could you just go over and just fucking take,

955
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:51.210
just answers the door and you go hi.
And he is Buddha right in the nuts,
huh?

956
00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:54.270
You would think they need just take a strip of the dead grass and you just start

957
00:57:54.271 --> 00:57:57.330
fucking beating his back with it.
That's what the fuck you wanted.
Do I,

958
00:57:57.331 --> 00:57:59.490
you know what?
I actually want to do that right now.
But you know what?

959
00:57:59.491 --> 00:58:03.510
You can't do it.
You know what?
Fuck him.
He did it to you.

960
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:05.100
He did it to you.

961
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:12.820
Oh Dude.
You know something.
I think you're,

962
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.370
I think what you came up with this the best.

963
00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:21.410
Why don't you just write coward?
No.

964
00:58:21.411 --> 00:58:23.930
Cause then he's going to do something else to your dad's house.

965
00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:31.430
Oh,
this guy's a cunt.
You know what?

966
00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:33.170
He doesn't have the balls to confront your dad.

967
00:58:33.171 --> 00:58:35.900
So when I think you'd do yet do the little cow thing and then set up video

968
00:58:35.901 --> 00:58:37.340
cameras and catch them doing something else,

969
00:58:37.341 --> 00:58:39.680
but then you've done something to him.
See,
it's just,
it's just awful.

970
00:58:39.681 --> 00:58:43.100
It's just as Bitchy,
tit for fucking tat thing.
I don't know what you have to do,

971
00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:46.040
but I feel like something has to be said.
At least

972
00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:52.940
I know what you do.
This is what you do.

973
00:58:52.941 --> 00:58:56.990
You go down to a fucking lady shoe store,
all right?

974
00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:59.750
And you buy a cheap pair of fucking women's shoes

975
00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:06.060
and next time you see you wrap it up like a present.
And you just give a tool

976
00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.480
and there's a card in there and everything,
and then you just,

977
00:59:12.481 --> 00:59:15.360
this is what you do.
You do that.
You just humiliate the guy.

978
00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:19.420
And he just open it up and just say,
hey sweetheart,
just want to get you,
you,

979
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:22.460
you just write from your heart about what a fucking bitchy is.

980
00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:27.220
It just is what you do.
Don't ever don't curse in it at all.
Right?

981
00:59:27.221 --> 00:59:32.110
It really nice and lovely.
Um,
but in that,

982
00:59:32.111 --> 00:59:33.130
without ever cursing,

983
00:59:33.131 --> 00:59:36.910
just let them know what an absolute fucking pussy he has for doing that bay.

984
00:59:36.911 --> 00:59:39.550
You Go,
oh,
that's,
I,
I think that,
you know what?
I think that's a winner.

985
00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:40.540
You know what?
I might have to,

986
00:59:40.541 --> 00:59:44.710
I might have to outsource this to my listeners if you guys have better ideas of

987
00:59:44.711 --> 00:59:48.700
what to do there.
Nobody gets hurt.
You made your point.
It's fucking hilarious.

988
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:52.610
And that's a funny,
you know,
you tell people that this guy did it and they go,

989
00:59:52.611 --> 00:59:56.380
so what'd you do?
He tell him,
I went out,
I went to a lady's Tish,
she was doing,

990
00:59:56.381 --> 00:59:57.640
I bought him a pair of pumps.

991
00:59:59.150 --> 00:59:59.520
<v 7>Okay.</v>

992
00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:04.260
<v 1>And then you get to laugh and every time you see him just wave and just start</v>

993
01:00:04.261 --> 01:00:06.270
calling them sweetheart Kim,
a pet name.

994
01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:11.580
Maybe you give him a woman's name like Diane or something.
Just,
hey,
Diane,

995
01:00:11.581 --> 01:00:12.720
how'd you like the shoes?

996
01:00:12.721 --> 01:00:16.710
And just every fucking day you can just do that forever.

997
01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:19.663
<v 0>I Dunno.</v>

998
01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.930
<v 1>It made me feel better about the situation.
Maybe you can do that.</v>

999
01:00:22.931 --> 01:00:25.810
Who the fuck knows?
Anyways,
good luck with that.
Uh,

1000
01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:30.340
but don't do any physical harm or real property.
That's the brilliance.

1001
01:00:30.341 --> 01:00:34.280
I must said genius.
Pat Myself on the back there.
Sorry about that.
Um,
that's,

1002
01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:39.130
that's what I like about the last plant is that you're not hurting him.

1003
01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:43.360
You write it eloquently.
You're not cursing.
There's nothing he can really do.

1004
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:48.610
You just bought him a gift that you'd give.
You'd give a woman,
it's perfect.

1005
01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:50.523
<v 0>You know,</v>

1006
01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:55.470
<v 1>I'd send them to the candy on Valentine's Day.
Just,
Ah,
just torture the guy.</v>

1007
01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.900
But you just keep giving them gifts,

1008
01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.393
<v 0>you know?</v>

1009
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.770
<v 1>I don't know what else,
what's some,
get them some flats.</v>

1010
01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:06.730
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1011
01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:10.780
<v 1>I Dunno.
Just a bunch of shit like that.
I don't know who the fuck knows.</v>

1012
01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:13.600
Maybe you just do it once and then that's it.

1013
01:01:13.601 --> 01:01:17.980
And then what you do and then right after that you replant the grass and then

1014
01:01:17.981 --> 01:01:20.830
you just let them know that you know that he did it and he's going to be too

1015
01:01:20.831 --> 01:01:22.600
much of a bitch to try to do it again.

1016
01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:26.860
And then he can tell you dad years later that that's don't tell your dad that

1017
01:01:26.861 --> 01:01:27.221
you did it.

1018
01:01:27.221 --> 01:01:30.270
And then years later you're telling me you did it when you're having a pint and

1019
01:01:30.271 --> 01:01:34.000
you guys can fucking laugh your balls off.
All right.
Work argument.

1020
01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:39.070
Um,
hey bill,
I work with some real morons.
I'm in sales.

1021
01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:43.630
So everyone is a hotheaded tool.
Really.
I thought you guys were like funny.

1022
01:01:43.631 --> 01:01:46.360
It always seemed like the salesmen were always breaking balls and being funny.

1023
01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.620
Um,
they all think they're living in a sales movie.
Oh,
okay.

1024
01:01:50.621 --> 01:01:52.830
Too many Glengarry Glen Ross.
All right.
Uh,

1025
01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.430
we have set accounts and nothing about our job requires us to generate new

1026
01:01:57.431 --> 01:02:01.150
business from cold leads,
but that doesn't stop these tools.

1027
01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.010
So the other day they're bitching.

1028
01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:05.980
About Saturday night live and how it's not funny anymore.

1029
01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:10.240
That's not really a big deal.
People always bitch about SNL even when it's good.

1030
01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:11.500
That didn't bother me,

1031
01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.480
but then they all started saying how they'd be funnier on the shell.

1032
01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:22.190
No,
Jesus.
Here we go.
This is like maybe watch.
No,
I guess it's not like that.

1033
01:02:22.191 --> 01:02:25.600
All right,
let's continue.
I'll just say it's like me watching UFC being like,
oh,

1034
01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:27.710
you know what I wanted done.
Um,

1035
01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:31.250
so this is when I chimed in and told them that it's harder than it looks and

1036
01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:35.210
that they did not.
They did not.
They did have a shot.
What?

1037
01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:40.210
And that they did have a shot.
Oh,
the,
oh,

1038
01:02:40.211 --> 01:02:44.230
that if she left out a word there said it's harder than it looks.
And if they,

1039
01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.100
if they did have a shot at having no stage presence or Rick or experience,

1040
01:02:48.101 --> 01:02:51.880
they would end up freezing up.
Then they'd be the guy who froze up,

1041
01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.530
whose face was everywhere.

1042
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:57.220
I made the point to them that if they were offered a spot on SNL,

1043
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:59.110
they'd be better to turn it down.

1044
01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:02.890
They'd have a happier life if they said no to SNL.
Jesus,

1045
01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:07.850
do you agree with this?
And if you are offered SNL,
would you take it?
Um,

1046
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:09.800
<v 0>okay.</v>

1047
01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.970
<v 1>Two.
I think that the people on SNL are funnier than a salesman.
Yes,
absolutely.</v>

1048
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:17.240
Absolutely.
Do I think that they would freeze up now?
Not necessarily.

1049
01:03:17.241 --> 01:03:20.990
They would probably,
you know,
maybe a few would freeze up.

1050
01:03:20.991 --> 01:03:25.520
Others would get dry mouth and still plow through it.
Others would ham it up,

1051
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:28.370
you know,
who knows.
Um,

1052
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:29.743
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1053
01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:31.260
<v 1>I dunno.
Um,</v>

1054
01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:32.560
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1055
01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.393
<v 1>their eye,</v>

1056
01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:37.490
if they offered me SNL I would know that they were in a lot of trouble.

1057
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:39.920
I am a 48 year old man next month.

1058
01:03:39.921 --> 01:03:44.260
I think that they like to try to get young talent and um,

1059
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:46.320
I think that window has closed.

1060
01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.550
Um,
I haven't said that.
I got nothing but respect.

1061
01:03:52.551 --> 01:03:56.250
It seems like haven't just trying to write a fucking cartoon where we got all

1062
01:03:56.251 --> 01:03:59.460
the fucking time when the world to do this shit where they have to come out with

1063
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:03.180
a brand new,
you know,
90 minutes minus fucking commercials.

1064
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:06.120
Um,
what's that?

1065
01:04:06.121 --> 01:04:09.810
90 minus 24 to get technical eight minutes every half hour.

1066
01:04:09.811 --> 01:04:13.890
That's 64 fucking 66 minutes a week.
Fuck you.

1067
01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:18.030
There's no way I've or I've heard nothing,
but that's an absolute,

1068
01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:23.570
it takes a special personality to be able to do that well,
to handle that.

1069
01:04:23.571 --> 01:04:24.740
And um,

1070
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:28.850
I would actually be worried about what it would do to my standup career,

1071
01:04:28.851 --> 01:04:32.120
having that level of a commitment.
Um,

1072
01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:37.300
which is why I prefer to do a role in a movie where it's just sort of like,

1073
01:04:38.101 --> 01:04:42.300
okay,
we got you from here to here.
So it's a finite thing with at SNL.

1074
01:04:42.301 --> 01:04:45.750
Shit is just like,
I don't know when they started,
when they stopped,

1075
01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:49.520
but it just seems to be a,
it's a hell of a commitment.
But,
um,

1076
01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:53.510
yeah,
so they go,
did I answer your question?
Um,

1077
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:55.250
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1078
01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:59.560
<v 1>I'll have to get offered SNL.
Who says fucking note of that?
Um,</v>

1079
01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:05.420
I dunno.
I Dunno if I get that on.
Why am I fucking stressing over this?

1080
01:05:05.421 --> 01:05:08.990
It's not happening.
But anyways,

1081
01:05:08.991 --> 01:05:12.560
thank you for sticking up for everybody on SNL.
I appreciate that.
All right.
Okay.

1082
01:05:12.561 --> 01:05:17.400
Here's the last one from a lady from a fucking lady,

1083
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:23.010
a woman proposing Yo baby cakes.
Belieber uh,
just curious.

1084
01:05:23.011 --> 01:05:26.190
What are your thoughts?
What are your,
what?
Oh,

1085
01:05:26.191 --> 01:05:28.950
just curious what your thoughts are.
Sorry everybody,
I'm bad at this.

1086
01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:33.720
Just curious what your thoughts are on women proposing love you.

1087
01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:37.530
Thanks for advocating for pitfalls.
Hope to see you soon.

1088
01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.500
Please don't use my name while they never show me your name.
MMM.

1089
01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:44.630
I think that's a bad move on the woman's part.

1090
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:47.530
Uh,

1091
01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:53.890
I think you guys generally speaking are more gung Ho to get married than guys

1092
01:05:54.441 --> 01:05:56.070
are.
And um,

1093
01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:01.370
if you propose to a guy and he's too much of a pussy to say no.

1094
01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:03.060
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1095
01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.720
<v 1>Um,
and then you ended up marrying the wrong person.</v>

1096
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:09.480
I think as a woman you should wait for the fucking guidance.

1097
01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.700
I think there's a reason why the guy asks.

1098
01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:13.150
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1099
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:16.150
<v 1>Uh,
it's because we don't want to do it.</v>

1100
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:20.150
So if we are actually asking,
then you know,
you with the na,
that one,

1101
01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:24.920
most of them ended up in divorce.
You know what?
I don't know.
MMM.

1102
01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:30.080
I don't know.
That could be maybe be kind of cool.
Okay.

1103
01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:34.250
There's something cute about it.
I can tell you that,
not talking down to you,
but,

1104
01:06:34.310 --> 01:06:38.830
uh,
I used to always fake proposed to Nia.

1105
01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:44.410
Now he's always go Nia,
I'm proposing to you right now.

1106
01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:46.120
And she would always be laughing,

1107
01:06:46.121 --> 01:06:51.010
knowing I was fucking around and I would always go,
I propose that we break up.

1108
01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:55.810
It was a silly joke and he used to always make her fucking laugh.
Um,

1109
01:06:58.930 --> 01:06:59.380
I dunno.

1110
01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:04.380
She was real cute during that time when she like wanted me to ask and uh,

1111
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:11.170
I dunno.
My wife's fucking adorable.
So I mean,
what am I going to do?
MMM.

1112
01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.300
Took a special kind of fuck a woman to trick me into doing this.

1113
01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:23.620
Uh,
she didn't trick me.
Anyways,
that's the podcast for this week.

1114
01:07:23.621 --> 01:07:26.620
I don't know if I have any advertising left anymore,
but who gives a fuck?

1115
01:07:26.621 --> 01:07:28.120
I never did it for that anyways.
Right.

1116
01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:30.970
I'll go out and go dance for my supper tonight.

1117
01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:35.950
You're advertising the water money,
although I loved it.
Oh,
I love that.

1118
01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:39.130
Advertising horror money.
Maybe I still have it.
Who knows?

1119
01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:45.780
That's the podcast.
Once again,
um,
I will try to take some video.
Uh,

1120
01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:48.760
this week I actually made a couple of ones,

1121
01:07:48.761 --> 01:07:51.580
but I made one for visy and I made one for fucking Dean del Rey,

1122
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:53.690
so it's got their name on it.
Um,

1123
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:55.540
when I say maybe I'll just post those fucking things.

1124
01:07:55.541 --> 01:07:59.410
I don't have to fucking move my truck out again.
Do it.
Anyways.
That's it.

1125
01:07:59.411 --> 01:08:02.740
That's a podcast for this week.
Thanks for listening.
Go fuck yourselves.

1126
01:08:02.741 --> 01:08:06.820
And I'll check on a Thursday.
Let's go blues.
