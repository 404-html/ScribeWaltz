00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.480
Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill Burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:07.240
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast there.
Huh?

3
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.030
Just checking in on Ya.
How are Ya?

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.160
Hang in with my wife on a rainy day and fucking nae.
What's up?

5
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.960
Hi,
how are Ya?
Nia?

6
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.730
There was a reason I brought you on this podcast.
And what is that reason?
Well,

7
00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:31.970
Nia,
as you know,
I am a blowhard.
Yes.

8
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.030
I talk and talk and talk and talk to the point.

9
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.900
<v 1>That I fall asleep.
There you go.
I was waiting.</v>

11
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.090
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.500
<v 1>Um,
so I actually ran to a question the other day.</v>

13
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:51.680
Believe it or not,
I'm walking on it.

14
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.960
Believe it or not.
Right?
Let's fix it.
Ah,
walking on air.

15
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.670
Salmaan sended me a fucking queer has John.
I couldn't answer it.

16
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.800
It blew my mind because even if I don't know the answer,

17
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.930
I still fucking talk to these people.
There you go.
That's a great song.

18
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:14.360
Let me get that piece of,
get the piece of fuzz off your mic.

19
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:17.930
That chairs are not as comfortable as they look.
Well,
they're made for men.

20
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.720
That's why these are men.
Chairs.
I need an Ottoman.
These are anti Bj.

21
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.750
Okay.
All right.
But you have,

22
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:29.780
how come there's not a second Ottoman for this chair?
Because this is,

23
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:33.320
this is a loaners.
You keep calling this a man cave.
It's not a man cave.

24
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.320
I don't call it a man.
Came to call it a man cave.
It's my office.

25
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.740
I don't ever call it a man cave and never call it that.
Wow.

26
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:41.240
Just like that on the podcast.
You're going to lie.

27
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.330
<v 3>I've never said I always go,
you can go to your office.
That's what I want.</v>

28
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:47.740
I'm banishing it from the what?

29
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.310
<v 1>Nia.
I didn't think that I called it a man cave.
Oh,</v>

30
00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:55.490
now you're backing down from it.
Yeah.
I believe he called this gas lighting.

31
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.550
You're making me seem like I'm crazy.
Maybe I'm crazy.
Anyway,

32
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:02.420
so this person had a question and it's a very delicate subject.
Near,

33
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.740
<v 0>yeah.</v>

34
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.920
<v 1>Alright.
Delicate.
Like my feelings.
You know,
people's,</v>

35
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:11.180
not much as I go on stage night after night and I try to act like I'm this tough

36
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:15.170
person.
If you really took the time to know me,
you'd know that it was foolish.

37
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.003
<v 0>That's true.</v>

38
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.960
<v 3>Oh,
I'm just talk so much shit.
See,
this is the problem.
This is why people,
boy,</v>

39
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.460
it's like people really think it's interesting to me how well your fans think

40
00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:33.461
they know you because you have this persona onstage and you're the angry guy and

41
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:35.600
that's certainly true.
Blue Limit Tell Ya.

42
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.460
But you're also just so full of shit.
Like you just talk so much.

43
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.660
Like you're all talk,

44
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.400
you just talk and talk and talk what you're just full of shit because you are

45
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.850
such a sensitive like giving like you know it's good shit.

46
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.610
Yeah.
But it's annoying because it's like you're walking around like,
hey,
Yay,
Yay,

47
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.980
Yay.
You know,
like choking

48
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.960
<v 1>the fucking microphone stand like you do.
Like it's weird.</v>

49
00:03:02.961 --> 00:03:06.610
I'd take the good with the bed.
People are like,
Oh God,
you guys went to Paris.

50
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:10.720
I met bill hated that.
And it's like,
no,
it's actually like his favorite city.

51
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.380
Oh Wow.
You guys went to the beach and Oh,
I bet bill hated that.
No,

52
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:16.570
we actually had a good time.
Like it's just so weird.

53
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.180
There's like this disconnect with Pete the fan again.
Oh,

54
00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:25.600
I bet he I the middle later that that's what it is.
It's always like,
Oh God,

55
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.880
I bet bill hated that.
And also it's like anytime,

56
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.170
any kind of picture on Instagram,
all of your fans,

57
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.580
God love Ya.
But all of your fans are like,
Ooh,
I bet bill.
You know,

58
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:38.720
they just will find something to bring you into it.

59
00:03:38.721 --> 00:03:41.470
It'd be like a post on my feed like,
oh Billy,

60
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:45.160
he likes to know shoes or whatever the fuck it is.
It's like,
it's crazy.

61
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.870
What's wrong with ted?
I mean nothing,
but it's just annoying.
Wow.

62
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:53.830
All that yelling.
That's all you had.
I know.
I really,
I really know.
I was like,

63
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:58.240
she ran out of steam lunch.
You know it's rainy day.

64
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:02.680
I really want to go take a nap right now.
You dragged me up here.
It didn't suck.

65
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.030
I know.
It's not bad.

66
00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:12.730
Everything in there good at just never ordered the good stuff.
Yeah,
I tired.

67
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.540
I decided to take a risk and it didn't quite pay off,

68
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.650
but it was still nice to have lunch with you.
I know.
And then we,

69
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.410
because we eating too much food.
I know.
No must know about that.

70
00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:24.660
We were eating the food and we realized we ordered too much,

71
00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:28.890
so we canceled one of the pizzas and he'd go,
which pizza do you want to cancel?

72
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.900
Yeah,
we should have canceled my pizza.
Yeah.

73
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:34.650
And I didn't want to fucking offend you getting all fucking pizza.
Me Today.

74
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.580
If I say abusing my white male privilege by saying,

75
00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:41.070
let's just get the simple sausage one.
Yeah.

76
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:44.870
You had to go with the fucking Wiener Schnitzel,
whatever the hell you got.
Yeah.

77
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.500
Yeah.
It didn't quite pay off.
It was still good,
but it just wasn't satisfying,

78
00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:50.880
I think is the word you're looking for.

79
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.120
Are you impressed how I've been getting up early and going to the gym?

80
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.020
Not really.
I mean,
you're still on European time,

81
00:04:57.021 --> 00:04:58.510
so it's not actually not that a professor.

82
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.820
Oh,
we'll be right back with searching for a compliment.

83
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.090
I am I impressed with you for being like still jet lagged?

84
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.650
No,
that's fine.
Present.
Maybe.
You know why?

85
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.700
It has nothing to do with me being jetlagged because you snore like a fucking

86
00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:23.720
offensive lineman.
Here we go on the snoring thing.
I gotta tell you.

87
00:05:23.721 --> 00:05:26.120
So you go through these periods,
you have such a cute little nose.

88
00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:27.970
How does it let noise noise come out of there?

89
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.890
Because I'm sleeping hard and I'm sleeping right.

90
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.170
That's this thing that you're doing now where every fucking five minutes you're

91
00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:41.630
shaking me in the bed like that doesn't do anything.

92
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.750
You up and you stop for a second is what she,
she starts fucking storm

93
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.450
you on this shit.

94
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.140
So what I do is I'm laying on my side away from her and what I do is I just

95
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:57.680
started shaking the bed.
I don't got it solved and it wakes her up and she'd go,

96
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.850
oh no,
the second you close your eyes.

97
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.470
<v 4>Okay.</v>

98
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.330
<v 1>Yeah.
It doesn't stop me from snoring.</v>

99
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:10.331
So I like what is the point of view and it's really starting to Piss me off.

100
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.120
I told you I will fucking,
I'll sleep somewhere else.
Okay.

101
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.390
All right.
But I've done that before and then after two nights you're like,

102
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:24.790
Yo Yo Yo won't coach you start doing the cute boys.
Well what's the,

103
00:06:24.791 --> 00:06:27.830
what are we supposed to do?
I snore.
You wake up.

104
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.520
We don't want to sleep apart from each other.
Yeah.
So what's the solution?

105
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.450
I'm ugly enough so I need as much beauty sleep I can get.
Don't say that,

106
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.400
but yeah,
no,

107
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.200
I guess I could get one of those breathe right strips or something like,

108
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.890
I don't know,
breathing wrong baby,

109
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.170
cause I never used to snore light that before the baby.
So I don't know.

110
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.740
I just think you're extra tired.
I'm sue snored the way I imagined.

111
00:06:52.741 --> 00:06:56.360
I snore after I drink like a third of bottle of fucking booze.

112
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.100
You were snoring earlier in the night when you first fell asleep last night

113
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.390
because I took that Mel at times and to taking that to get myself back on and

114
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.600
it's fucking work.
Great.
Okay.

115
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.860
<v 4>Okay.</v>

116
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.230
<v 1>So I mean,
I dunno,
I don't know what to tell you.
Hey,</v>

117
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.100
I still love you,
right?
No,
I know.

118
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.830
I won't be passed out laying next to you anymore.

119
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.130
Just stop shaking the bed.
It's like why?
What is the cause it works.
It works.

120
00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:27.690
A lot of times you roll over and you know you stopped like 20 minutes but now,

121
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.670
now you just like relentless.
She liked the fucking terminator was sleeping.

122
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.580
Tell me think I blew you up or some shit.

123
00:07:33.581 --> 00:07:35.770
You just fucking come back together again.
You start snoring.

124
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.200
All right,
well I'm sorry

125
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.290
so I might,
oh my God.

126
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.730
<v 4>Okay.</v>

127
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.700
<v 1>Why am I here?
What'd you call me in here for?
What is,
I don't know.</v>

128
00:07:53.701 --> 00:07:54.391
Cause you know what?

129
00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:57.780
I made a new year's resolution that I wasn't going to argue with you as much.

130
00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.250
Yeah,

131
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.430
you made a new year's resolution that you're not going to argue with me as much

132
00:08:02.431 --> 00:08:06.810
and it's been working.
So I need you to explain this.
What does that mean?

133
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.100
I'm just going to agree with you.
Is that what you think that I want?

134
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.090
Yes.
No winning.
It's not winning.

135
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.870
Like arguing with you hasn't worked.
I'll just agree with you.
All right.

136
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.190
I'm not trying to like cut off like the balls of your opinion.

137
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.900
I just need you to not be an asshole.
Come on that.
I don't know how to do that.

138
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.970
Oh really?
Come on.
I'm an asshole.
He married in asshole.

139
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.730
But that's kind of not fair on your side.

140
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.030
But you're married an asshole and now you want me to not be an asshole.

141
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.110
I didn't realize you were that big than that.
Why?

142
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.880
I knew you were.
I knew you weren't sure what it is.

143
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:55.060
I thought you were like a bad boy and then the bad boy turns and select a bad

144
00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.300
and then no,
but you're not a bad boy.
You're just like,
you're just grumpy.

145
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:02.910
And I before I was like,
oh you're edgy.
Like he's edgy.

146
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:06.120
Like it doesn't take any shit man.
Cause you were a casting director.

147
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.680
You put me in this box,
man.
Yeah.
Yeah.

148
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.190
He can play 28 to 35 he's edging.
You weren't even looking at me like a person.

149
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.330
No,
that's not true.
I thought you were amazing and you're really cool.

150
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:22.680
But I just feel like as you've gotten older you've just become like so cranky.

151
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:23.491
Somebody was like,
oh,

152
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:26.400
Bill Burroughs is going to make the best like cranky old man.

153
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:29.280
It's going to be hilarious.
And it's like,
yeah,
I have to live with that.

154
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.920
It's gotta be so hard.
It is.
You're so brave.
Me Brave.

155
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.440
What am I going to call my memoir?
Surviving Bill Burke.
Yeah,
that's it.

156
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.610
Surviving Belper becoming.
No,
it's just like I said,

157
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:48.690
it's annoying cause you're actually a very sweet person,
but everybody sees this,

158
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.890
this angry jackass.
No.
Then that's what the people want.
They don't.
Yes,

159
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:55.100
they do like me.
Believe it or not,
India,

160
00:09:55.290 --> 00:10:00.030
there's people beyond the walls of this fucking relationship that actually liked

161
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:04.410
me.
Granted,
they don't have to live with me.
I know I'm difficult to live with.

162
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:07.320
I'm literally telling you I'm going to try to just fucking agree.

163
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.960
Whatever harebrained fucking idea you have,

164
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:11.640
that's going to take up the whole fucking day.

165
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.090
Every you want to go after the cocoa Moko woke us fucking thing all the way up

166
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:19.590
to five.
It's just off football going on.

167
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:22.950
I'll tape it.
You did not take my games while I was away.

168
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.740
I thought I'd take the tape all your car Dashun horse shit.

169
00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:28.380
Whenever you're asking me to take Sebastian,

170
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:31.330
did you take Sebastian on the fucking news story?
You miss that toe?

171
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.560
I forgot cause I'll get caught up with the baby and shit and I forget.

172
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:37.980
But I really thought that I taped all your games while you were gone because I

173
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:40.560
sat there when I searched one,
the other two came up so I was like,

174
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.070
oh great record record record.

175
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.810
Sebastian was on like the fucking NBC nightly news and he was walking around the

176
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:48.870
comedy store talking about the history of place online.
Bill.

177
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:53.760
We can find it online,
but yes,
I did forget to Dvr it so I apologize for that.

178
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.470
You're right.
Hey,
you're right.
We'll,
we'll search for it online.

179
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:01.540
Wait for somebody to put it online.
Do we need to go to a couple of things?

180
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.750
Can we just work it all out in the podcast?
I'd love to go to couple's therapy.

181
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.310
Would you?
Why?
Because I feel like if there was another person there going,
hey,

182
00:11:11.311 --> 00:11:16.140
you know,
maybe bill has a point.
I could win one once,
once.
Just one.

183
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.220
Just wants,

184
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.620
if fact could find a way for you to admit that baby.

185
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.550
I know what can be a fucking Douche.

186
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.570
You went in a lot of them is the thing you just don't realize that you do.

187
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.460
Yeah.
So that's,
that's probably the biggest mind fuck you've ever given me.

188
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.610
You win a lot of them.
You just don't realize you do.

189
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.060
So you're so good that even when I'm winning I feel like I lose.

190
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.410
That's what you're telling me.
Wow.
I am amazing.
It's,

191
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.230
that is an amazing skill.
I don't know if I'd be proud of it.
Fair enough.

192
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.900
Fair enough.
You take in my lines.
I love it.
Fair enough.
Well,
you know what,
Nia,

193
00:11:55.901 --> 00:11:57.940
we went out to lunch today.
We,
we uh,

194
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.820
we did some other things that I'm not allowed to talk about yet because the,

195
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:06.220
you know,
I have to wait till the official announcement comes about.

196
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.440
I'll give you an idea.

197
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.710
There's something that's going on with me and it rhymes with Ranzit running.

198
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:17.030
<v 4>Okay.</v>

199
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:22.030
<v 1>I and I fully support you fully support and we're going to try and make this</v>

200
00:12:22.101 --> 00:12:22.934
relationship work.

201
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:28.280
Cause I ran Zishan from a fucking Douche.

202
00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.490
What if I loved you so much?

203
00:12:31.491 --> 00:12:34.940
I transition to a woman that enjoyed the Kardashians.

204
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:39.630
That's not what I want my life.
Gower's Clyde Dad,

205
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.820
I think so sad.
It's so weird.
You know I watch that show but I,
I hate them.

206
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.560
It's like,
so it's such a weird thing.
I am.
I hate watching it.
Do you think?

207
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.890
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't believe in hate watching.

208
00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:58.350
I think that's so juvenile and like ridiculous.

209
00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.850
That's probably some sort of like this.

210
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.660
Probably at some point you'll be able to get in trouble with that on social

211
00:13:03.661 --> 00:13:08.070
media.
I'm sure Renee Hill accused of a hate watching.

212
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.320
I don't recall hate watching,
but if I did hate watch,

213
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.080
I'd like apologize to the producers of those shows.

214
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.550
I'm on my phone and I'm just kind of like in and out.
Like,

215
00:13:20.551 --> 00:13:22.230
I don't even really know what's going on,

216
00:13:22.231 --> 00:13:25.830
but it's just there and they're talking at me and I know I don't,

217
00:13:25.831 --> 00:13:28.680
I don't have a good explanation for it,
but it is what it is.
Nowhere near.

218
00:13:28.681 --> 00:13:31.980
If you enjoy that show,
God damn it.
You Watch it.
Okay.

219
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.590
And I'll try other terrible reality shows.

220
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.830
So what's your top three terrible reality shows?
Uh,

221
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.910
currently it's Vanderpump rules.
Ah,

222
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.870
real housewives.
I don't mind Vanderpump rules,
you know?

223
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.300
Yeah.
Yeah.
You like those goods and I don't know,
just something like,
uh,

224
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.171
I don't get what's,

225
00:13:52.171 --> 00:13:55.920
I don't understand how you get a job at a restaurant and your manager becomes

226
00:13:55.921 --> 00:13:59.800
your life coach.
This just something hilarious about that to me.
Yeah.

227
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.650
She's like the mother figure,
but it's just like a young,
as I can tell,

228
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.940
she married,
she married,

229
00:14:05.941 --> 00:14:08.640
she's been married for like the longest side kids of her own.

230
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.890
She owns these businesses and then she employs these like young and beautiful

231
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:19.050
fame whores and uh,
deals a lot of their drama.
So the skinny dude who cried,

232
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.320
<v 5>sorry James,
you're firing me.</v>

233
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:24.790
Wait a minute.

234
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.870
Wait a minute.

235
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.980
<v 1>I love that she stuck to her guns.
She did your kids amiss.</v>

236
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.560
That kid's a mess.
He deserves to be fired.
Well,

237
00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:41.130
he doesn't need to get the life together.
You firing me?
Yes.

238
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.150
I don't know if that happened.

239
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.350
It just seemed like it was the longest I've ever seen somebody.

240
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.320
He had no argument.
He just kept,
I don't know.

241
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.240
That's what it felt like he was saying.
So they let that guy go.

242
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.290
He's fired off to show for what?
Not off the show.
He's still on the show.

243
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:01.690
He's just,
because he gets really drunk and he says really nasty things.

244
00:15:01.691 --> 00:15:05.540
So the people that work there,
namely the girls and he's always like,
you all fat,

245
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.393
whore,

246
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.820
fucking hustle.
Oh it's fucking great.

247
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.510
I love that guy.
Don't fire him.
And then the other guy,
Jack's right,

248
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.690
I was hoping he's going to get the job of the hockey club.
Yeah,
right.

249
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.700
Here's the whole thing was all that he was going to tweet.

250
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:28.790
He's going to do social media for like a minor league,

251
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.110
Florida based a hockey team.
So what kind of bullshit job is that?

252
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.390
How?
What kind of job is that to tweet for them and what way?

253
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.200
Got a game coming up.
That's really

254
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.600
good.
Instagram account.
Yeah.
You're generating excitement.

255
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:52.460
If this fights in this good hits and it seems like a good game and people want

256
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:56.600
to come out to buy tickets and spend money.
Yay.
That's what you do.

257
00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.170
Well Christ near you can follow restaurants on Instagram.

258
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.880
I just started following this amazing cheese board account and you're making fun

259
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:07.910
of this guy with the hockey team.
Cause somebody running a cheeseboard account.

260
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.500

I was like meg.
Oh it's incredible.

263
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.690
Munster cheese.
What are the cheeses?

264
00:16:20.691 --> 00:16:25.580
Begin name a cheese that begins with them.

267
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:37.850
Cheddar Bay.
Why is that a bad cause?
The cheese.

268
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.480
It's got to be mild Cheddar.
No,
that's a kind of Cheddar.
Cheddar is,

269
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.910
I dunno,

274

This is fucking amazing.
All right.
Family number four.

275

Okay,

All right.

277
00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:29.620
We need a cheese that begins with him or the Sullivan family as a chance to

278
00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:32.670
steal.
What do you got?

279
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.300
Um,
got one strike with a mild cheese.

280
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.280
I honestly don't know any other cheeses that begin with m.
Oh,
come on.

281
00:17:43.281 --> 00:17:46.430

282
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.950

284
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.660
I asked you to name of change begins with m and you said Montebello.

285
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:04.550
I got nothing.
Show me Montebello.

Dude.

286
00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:06.700
That's amazing that you could do that monsters all I had.

287
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.320
That's why I married you,
because you know all the cheeses.
That's all right,

288
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.800

Wait,

Sure.

295
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:44.690

302
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.170
It feels a little weird to be an adult dressing like a six month old baby.

303
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.200
It's so comfortable.

The fabric generally feels like actual heaven against your skin.

338
00:21:31.091 --> 00:21:34.960
This person was at a near death experience where God came down and tickle this

339
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.230
little privates.
Oh my God,

340

I need an underwear that feels like the hand of God welcoming my balls to the

341
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:45.100

396
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.780
Inevitably,
we all skimp on that full night of sleep.

397
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:22.810
Skip a workout or to or brush our teeth with a tired old toothbrush.

398
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.290
We're not perfect,

I love when you do the podcast and you,
you know,
that was great.

426
00:27:09.061 --> 00:27:10.300
You're funny.
You kill it.
Oh,

427
00:27:10.301 --> 00:27:15.000
it's girlfriend won't lose weight.

428
00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.140
Dear Billy,
Nutso fat,
this is from the other day.
Okay.

429
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:24.240
It's a very delicate situation.
Uh,
yes,

430
00:27:24.241 --> 00:27:24.870
I'm here.
Okay.

431
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:29.340
My girlfriend and I have been dating for three years going on four and I'm

432
00:27:29.341 --> 00:27:33.150
starting to have different feelings towards her because of her eating habits and

433
00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:37.440
the way she takes care of herself.
Since I met her several years ago,

434
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:42.650
she had co she kind of had a weight thing that was noticeable but didn't think

435
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:47.550
anything of it because I thought she would get on some sort of kick of wanting

436
00:27:47.551 --> 00:27:50.400
to lose some weight in the years to come.
Uh,

437
00:27:50.401 --> 00:27:53.950
well it's been three and a half years and oh,

438
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:55.290
you're already making a face over there.

439
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:59.730
Well it's been three and a half years and there's no stopping her from losing

440
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:04.350
weight,
weight,
losing weight.
She's 25 and I'm 30 and I don't know what to do.

441
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.140
She loves to see me gaining weight.

442
00:28:07.141 --> 00:28:11.670
She loves the sweets and is not a fan of running because it hurts her feet.

443
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.020
Help Bill.
I love her,

444
00:28:13.021 --> 00:28:16.740
but I don't want to spend my early thirties miserable in a relationship with

445
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:20.580
someone who doesn't want to take care of herself.
Thanks and go fuck yourself.

446
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.140
Now what does he say to her?

447
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.180
<v 3>First of all,
motherfucker,</v>

448
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:28.190
you fell in love with her when she was a little thick and you were just like,

449
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.000
oh,
so lose weight,

450
00:28:30.001 --> 00:28:33.870
but you still fell far and now you're mad that the bitch has gained weight.

451
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.260
It's like she obviously likes to eat.
You knew that from jump.

452
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.830
So why are you getting extra street on this one motherfucker from the jump ship?

453
00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.490
Okay,
so,
so what's the problem?

454
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:52.560
She won't she,
she just keeps gaining weight.
Bitch be getting fat and all right.

455
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:55.110
P H a t in it and the club.

456
00:28:55.111 --> 00:28:58.440
Now you're not in it for a second child because it makes her feet.
Yeah.

457
00:28:58.441 --> 00:29:01.260
Johnny is terrible for your knees,
so you know,

458
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.860
not everybody has [inaudible] fuck going to hurt your feet.

459
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:10.500
Not everybody likes the job.
There's other ways,
but I mean,
I don't know.

460
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.010
Don't you think?

461
00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.800
<v 1>Okay,
I'll play devil's advocate here.
All right.</v>

462
00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:19.210
You can't get what you get with somebody and you were in a particular way.

463
00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.250
You got to hover in that zone.
Yeah.
Okay.

464
00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.900
You can't get reality show fat on them.
Reality Show.
I'm just saying here.

465
00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:28.870
Let me ask you this then it what point?

466
00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.820
Remember how pasty I am?
All right.
Oh,

467
00:29:33.821 --> 00:29:38.760
I remember staring at every day my big,

468
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:42.940
I just start looking like a fucking snowman and then suddenly my gut,

469
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:43.930
when you don't want to get it,

470
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:47.680
can't go out anymore and it starts to drop and it starts hanging over your

471
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:51.880
fucking junk a little bit.
Well,
you know,
I mean,

472
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.190
you can't tell me.
You're not going to be like going like,

473
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.340
hey [inaudible] Michelin man,

474
00:29:57.341 --> 00:29:59.260
what are you doing wrong person to ask.

475
00:29:59.261 --> 00:30:02.650
Because I've never had a problem with a little extra on a guy.

476
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.640
I've never like thought it was like,
oh,
he's too fat for me or whatever.

477
00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:09.930
Like crazy obese.
Sure.
That's what I'm saying.
But I feel like what?

478
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.420
You're not on the thicker side.
I don't mind a little thickness to a guy.

479
00:30:13.421 --> 00:30:15.070
I think it's got a nice,
he's not saying that.

480
00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:19.990
I think that's where she started and now on the thick side and now she was,

481
00:30:19.991 --> 00:30:23.520
uh,
she was a thickie that maybe it could have taken a couple of blowing off a

482
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:24.700
couple of laps around the block.

483
00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:28.300
And he still God with heart and he's been with her three years since like,

484
00:30:28.301 --> 00:30:31.510
is she eating by herself?
Nia.
He looked at her the way men,

485
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.800
women look at men a lot of time.

486
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:37.660
This is a fixer upper and then he bought the house and all of a sudden that's

487
00:30:37.661 --> 00:30:39.370
your problem.
I've are,
I've always,

488
00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:41.800
I've said it before on this podcast and I'll say it again.

489
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.330
You don't fall in love with potential.
It's a trap.
Alright,
nick,

490
00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.490
can you help the guy out?
What am I supposed to say?
Well,
he always seemed,

491
00:30:48.491 --> 00:30:50.740
loves her.
How does he go?
Listen,
Tbi,
you know,

492
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.790
and you're fucking lay off the fucking strawberry shortcake here.
Uh,

493
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.880
well maybe,
let's see.
What would I say?
Uh,

494
00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:01.390
lead by example and be like,
you know what?
I want to be healthy.

495
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:05.140
Like I want to cook healthy.
Like I want to exercise more.
Like what do you think?

496
00:31:05.141 --> 00:31:08.510
Do you want to do it with me?
And that can be like a thing.
No,

497
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.570
that's how you do it.
This way to do it is to say,
I think women are too smart.

498
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:18.100
They'll see through you saying,
I'm sad if I came up.
You said,
hey,

499
00:31:18.101 --> 00:31:20.120
I've been thinking about eating some wrestle sprouts.
You want,

500
00:31:20.121 --> 00:31:22.150
need some Brussels sprouts with me?
Yeah.
It'd be like,

501
00:31:22.151 --> 00:31:24.460
what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
He's saying,
I'm fat.

502
00:31:24.461 --> 00:31:27.640
You fucking bald red cunt.
That's what it would come out of your mouth.

503
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:33.330
This guy obviously wants to be with this person,
right?
He's tough.

504
00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.970
He said he writes it a little bit funny,
but yeah,
but read that last part again.

505
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.600
I love her,
but like say that again.
Read that last part.

506
00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:43.900
Okay.
I love her,

507
00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:47.200
but I don't want to spend my early thirties miserable in a relationship with

508
00:31:47.201 --> 00:31:49.570
someone who doesn't want to take care of herself.
Yeah.

509
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.140
This is his fucking thing about people being fat fucks now and being proud of
it.

510
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.420
It's like you're killing yourself.
You're gonna die.
You're gonna,
you're gonna,

511
00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.730
you're not a doctor.
You can't say that.

512
00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:03.130
You don't know what like how I am not a doctor,

513
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.050
but I can't say that and I just did.

514
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.710
And I can say that because that's like me saying that you smoking cigarettes,

515
00:32:08.711 --> 00:32:12.010
you're going to get lung cancer.
You're not a doctor.
I can't say that.
Well yeah,

516
00:32:12.011 --> 00:32:12.731
no,
of course.

517
00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:16.540
But like sometimes just the way your body looks doesn't determine your level of

518
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:19.630
health.
Does she not work out at all?
That's what he's saying.

519
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:24.290
She's sitting there and she's eating and she's getting fatter and fatter.

520
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:27.040
That's not fair to the other person there.
I know,
but you know what?

521
00:32:27.041 --> 00:32:28.660
Sometimes it's not about the other person.

522
00:32:28.661 --> 00:32:29.950
Sometimes you're going through something,

523
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:32.440
sometimes you just want to fuck a fucking two years.

524
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:36.130
Sometimes you don't want to think about dieting and exercising all the time and

525
00:32:36.131 --> 00:32:40.280
being caught in that circle of constantly like,
I need to die.
I need to exercise,

526
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.010
<v 3>I need to die.</v>

527
00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:45.710
Like I need to learn how to eat well and maybe that's not something that she

528
00:32:45.711 --> 00:32:46.850
feels like doing right now.

529
00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:50.120
I feel like I'm talking about myself because I want to lose weight.

530
00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.740
I'm going been trying to lose this baby weight,

531
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:55.340
but like I just sometimes I just don't want,
this isn't about you.

532
00:32:55.341 --> 00:32:59.990
It's about this person.
Yes,
she sees me.
He,

533
00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.670
because I don't feel like necessarily being on that goddamn hamster wheel.

534
00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.240
I want to go back to my trainer now that I've recovered from my hernia surgery,

535
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:09.650
I'm going to get back into it,

536
00:33:09.651 --> 00:33:13.700
but like to think about eating healthy all the time and exercising all the time.

537
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:17.420
Like sometimes you just don't fucking want to,
are you going to dump me?

538
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:18.323
Are you going to like

539
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.920
<v 1>kick me to the curb?
You do.</v>

540
00:33:22.921 --> 00:33:24.480
You realize how fucking insane you are right now.

541
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.870
Like this was literally about another woman and you're fucking yelling at me.

542
00:33:27.871 --> 00:33:31.350
Like I said,
I know I'm trying to help this kid out so he can,

543
00:33:31.351 --> 00:33:35.070
he loves this woman and you know it.
It is.
It's a good thing to lose weight.

544
00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:36.750
It's not good for you.
Every five,

545
00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.200
every pound of fat is a hundred miles a capillary.
So we told me that one time.

546
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:43.260
So any time your heartbeat.
Yes.

547
00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.293
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

548
00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:48.850
<v 1>I don't remember,
but
somebody told me no,</v>

549
00:33:48.851 --> 00:33:51.640
but the thing is you put that weight on in this,
there's more mass.

550
00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.550
Your body has to grow more capillaries.
So cause that party would die.

551
00:33:54.551 --> 00:33:57.470
It needs oxygen.
Oxygenated blood.
I came to say it right.

552
00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:02.890
Oxygenate oxygen.
That's a tough one.
Oxygenated.
Oh God.

553
00:34:02.891 --> 00:34:07.690
We had a kid.
Wow.
Hopefully still be smarter than us.

554
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:12.280
Okay.
Yeah.
You can't just sell.
It has to grow that.
So then that's an extra like,

555
00:34:12.281 --> 00:34:15.010
you know,
it's like a paper route.
There's an extra five customers every day.

556
00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:19.150
Nobody wants to be overweight.
Okay.
Everybody wants to be in shape.

557
00:34:19.151 --> 00:34:23.320
Everybody wants to look at you.
Can you remove yourself?
I can.

558
00:34:23.321 --> 00:34:26.940
It's close to home.
It's close to home.
It's,
it's hitting close to home.
Alright.

559
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:29.320
Okay.
Fair enough.
All right.
Well you know what buddy?
I tried you.

560
00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:30.183
What would you do?

561
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:31.830
<v 0>Okay.</v>

562
00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:36.830
<v 1>I would buy a Ukulele and I would write a silly song about how she needs to get</v>

563
00:34:37.771 --> 00:34:38.604
in shape.

564
00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:44.910
And I would say that my Dick wrote it so they wouldn't be mad at me

565
00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:53.340
seriously though.
I would tell her that.
Listen,
I never told us before.

566
00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:57.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

567
00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:59.800
<v 1>Uh,
no,
because when I go down on you now,</v>

568
00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:04.480
I'm starting to get claustrophobic cause I feel like the walls are closing in

569
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:10.150
from both sides and from above.
And I just,
wow.

570
00:35:10.151 --> 00:35:14.800
I feel like it can't breathe the zero way.
No,
I don't know what I would say.

571
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:19.720
It's a tough one.
That's a tough one to answer.
So you're beautiful.

572
00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.770
I love you.
But if you don't hit the treadmill,

573
00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.160
I'm going to buy a human leash and start dragging around the block.

574
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:32.263
<v 0>I Dunno.</v>

575
00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.740
<v 1>Do you want to do this yoga class with me after work?</v>

576
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:37.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

577
00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:38.090
<v 1>Could do couple's</v>

578
00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:41.560
<v 0>yoga together.
I feel like you have to if you're going to,</v>

579
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:48.170
we've been to a yoga class together,
but you have to.
I think if you're,

580
00:35:48.171 --> 00:35:49.410
if you're really concerned about though,

581
00:35:49.411 --> 00:35:53.270
seriously you should suggest that you do stuff that's healthy together.

582
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:57.380
Like let's cook meals together.
Let's go to yoga class.
Think like that's,

583
00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:01.730
I feel like that's the nicest way to do it without making the person feel like

584
00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:06.350
you're singling them out or you know why I think she put herself say,
listen,

585
00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.210
I want to get into to really good shape.

586
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:12.940
I feel like I'm not in the shape I want to be in.
Uh,

587
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.250
<v 1>and I was,
you know,</v>

588
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.500
when I used to be in better shape before I met you just make that shit up.

589
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.440
Cause I used to go to the gym with a buddy of mine.

590
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:24.610
She's going to see through all of this.
He got to it.
It's got to be like,
Hey,

591
00:36:24.611 --> 00:36:26.950
you want to make dinner together?
Do you want to go to your other classes

592
00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:30.180
<v 0>together?
Just nice and easy.</v>

593
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:34.330
<v 1>I am like the way you make me healthy smoothies every morning.</v>

594
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.220
Something like that because I appreciate it.

595
00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:39.320
<v 0>That does healthy smoothies.
Okay,</v>

596
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:43.380
<v 1>well you know what,
this,
this is a tough one.
That's one of the hardest ones that,</v>

597
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:47.490
hey ladies,
any ladies out there,
um,

598
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.520
right in and,
and how can a guy

599
00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.180
or how would you tell him?
Yeah,

600
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.150
how can a man tell a woman that he loves,
he wants to stay with her,

601
00:36:58.151 --> 00:37:03.010
but she's putting on fucking weight,
you know,
and it's,
he's,

602
00:37:03.011 --> 00:37:05.080
he's helping her out.
Mia.
I know,

603
00:37:05.081 --> 00:37:08.380
but he didn't fall in love with like her body obviously.

604
00:37:08.381 --> 00:37:10.420
Like he fell in love with something else about her.

605
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.710
You can't say that it's an if you fell in love with the guy and then he puts on

606
00:37:14.711 --> 00:37:17.030
weight and he's his pot smoking.
Fucking guy would like to.

607
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.530
This ways that women can fall out of love with the guy that they fell in love

608
00:37:20.531 --> 00:37:24.220
with because he's letting himself go because he stopped going after it because

609
00:37:24.221 --> 00:37:25.350
he's partying too much.

610
00:37:25.351 --> 00:37:28.870
There's all the same and and putting on weight is in that.
Okay.

611
00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:33.850
Like someone like to fall in love with someone and then a couple of years later

612
00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:36.270
they like literally twice the size that they are.
That's,

613
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.100
that's selfish behavior but no,
but,
but,

614
00:37:39.101 --> 00:37:42.250
but the thing is I don't feel like it's necessarily selfish what else is going

615
00:37:42.251 --> 00:37:46.300
on in their life because maybe there's something that's leading into that extra

616
00:37:46.301 --> 00:37:48.610
eating or stress eating or whatever.

617
00:37:48.611 --> 00:37:52.300
Maybe there's something else going on that can anybody just be a lazy fuck and

618
00:37:52.301 --> 00:37:53.860
they're just eating fucking Sundays.

619
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.630
Why does it always have to be like I get touched funny by my mailman,

620
00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:02.470
so now I use fucking coco crisp to be a good human being and seeing beyond the

621
00:38:02.471 --> 00:38:05.860
superficial and the see what's in someone's heart and mind.
You know what?

622
00:38:05.861 --> 00:38:08.740
That's probably right.
My thing is Iowa,
I bury everything.

623
00:38:08.741 --> 00:38:11.980
So I just get up like a fucking robot.
I mean,
it's working for me,

624
00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:16.660
but I understand.
I Dunno.
I don't know.
I had,

625
00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:20.560
I had,
well,
you know what I accomplished,
I accomplished.
How difficult.

626
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:25.330
This is such a difficult thing to talk about,
you know,
Eh,
uh,

627
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.553
you know.

628
00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:28.183
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

629
00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:31.330
<v 1>You know,
bitches be getting fat.
I don't know what to tell you.</v>

630
00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.730
I'm joking.
I'm joking.
All right,
there you go.
Nia.

631
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:41.320
I think you look beautiful.
I been trying to bang you for like a fucking,

632
00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.170
since I came back.
That's true.
Europe,
you know,

633
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.320
I've tried all my smooth lines,
you know,
like,

634
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:49.420
can you do something about this over here?

635
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:56.100
I bought a little Atta boy over here.

636
00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.980
Even grabbing me and restaurants and things like that.

637
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.090
Even manhandling me even coming up behind me in the kitchen and that type of

638
00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:07.950
thing.
Yup.
I'll give it to you then.
Tell me a favor.

639
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:12.960
Don't put yourself out.
All right.
You know,
find it in your fucking heart.
Why?

640
00:39:12.961 --> 00:39:14.940
According to you,
I don't do anything.
I just,

641
00:39:14.941 --> 00:39:18.720
apparently I just lie there and just take it and don't participate.

642
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:21.360
I believe you cue shit on me first.

643
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:24.060
What do you mean you criticize my performance first?

644
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:27.780
I got defensive and I say that you're a fucking animal in bed.

645
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.910
I never said that you weren't.
All right.
Well there you go.

646
00:39:29.911 --> 00:39:32.640
We'll stop acting like I'm not fucking doing something for you.
You are doing,

647
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:34.280
you're doing a lot for me.
Don't laugh at me.
Right.

648
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.700
Oh,
Nia.
You know something else.
What?

649
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:44.210
You're not as complex as you like to act.
Okay.

650
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:46.810
You don't think I'm running around in there,
but I'm in there.

651
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.730
I'm between those ears.
Oh yeah.
Great comeback.

652
00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:56.500
That's it.
All right.
Jerk face.
Uh,
thanks for hanging out with me.

653
00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:00.680
Uh,
this happened me.
Oh,
we got to bring up William Stephenson.
Oh,

654
00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.880
a sad thing here.
After all the laughs,
uh,

655
00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:07.180
another great comic and other great friend and just somebody who I must have

656
00:40:07.181 --> 00:40:10.840
done.
I feel like I did a million shows with William Stephenson.
Unfortunately,

657
00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:15.370
he passed away.
Uh,
I believe it was on Monday of this week.
And,

658
00:40:15.371 --> 00:40:17.770
um,
I'm going to miss that guy.
I just,

659
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.240
we used to have so many running jokes cause we always just do late night shows

660
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:27.500
in New York City.
And I remember that stupid Mcdonald's thing came up,
but up,
up,

661
00:40:27.501 --> 00:40:29.050
up,
I'm loving it.

662
00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:32.300
And we would just come in and every time we would sing something different but

663
00:40:32.301 --> 00:40:34.210
at Blah Blah Blah,
I'm fucking it.

664
00:40:34.211 --> 00:40:36.940
Or just something stupid and it would just always make us laugh.

665
00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.930
We would always do it on like the third show when it was like half the fucking

666
00:40:40.931 --> 00:40:44.980
room was full.
And um,
you know what?
I got to find it.

667
00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:49.300
I have a great picture of me and him back when I had hair and Greg Giraldo.

668
00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:54.520
Yeah,
it's probably sad photo.
I guess I'm next time.
That photo Jesus Christ,

669
00:40:54.521 --> 00:40:57.790
he's as well.
It's how it works and yet,
you know,
it's like a forest fire.
Okay.

670
00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:02.290
You burned down a red head and awesome.
Some brunettes growth.
Um,

671
00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.510
all right.
So rest in peace.
William,

672
00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:08.740
you're one of the greats and I'm definitely gonna miss you and thank you to the

673
00:41:08.741 --> 00:41:12.280
comedy cellar and all those clubs that I got to work with them in.
Um,

674
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.420
he was just,
he was the best host,
you know,
used to host the shows.

675
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:19.480
He was the fucking best.
And I never heard him say a bad word about anybody,
so,

676
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:23.650
and he was a hell of a musician to play the piano.
I didn't know that.
Oh Man.

677
00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:28.300
He got to know him when he was a guest on tough crowd quite a few times he used

678
00:41:28.301 --> 00:41:31.030
to do,
but I didn't know that he played music too.
Oh yeah.
He's,

679
00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:35.480
Jeff Ross used to go on stage with them and he would play this really cool,

680
00:41:35.481 --> 00:41:39.920
perfect accompaniment music when Jeff used to do his poems.

681
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:44.030
Right,
right.
You know,
and he was just,
it worked great.

682
00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:49.030
And they had so much fun together on stage,
which is,
I gotta be honest,
you,

683
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.930
when I was watching bumping Mike's with,
um,
with Jeff and Dave Attell,

684
00:41:53.931 --> 00:41:57.350
it reminded me of that.
And I gotta tell you there's something about,

685
00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.440
I don't know,
there was something about that to comics going on stage,

686
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:02.510
watching them have fun and you end up seeing,

687
00:42:02.511 --> 00:42:05.230
they see like I've never seen Dave like smile as much as that.
It's,

688
00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:09.350
it's been great to watch.
So anyways,
rest in peace.
Uh,
William Stephenson,

689
00:42:09.351 --> 00:42:13.460
another great comic gone.
Um,
so anyways,
that's,
that's the podcast.

690
00:42:13.461 --> 00:42:15.170
You guys have a great weekend.
Enjoy the music.

691
00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:20.260
<v 6>There'll be another half hour of a greatest hit Thursday afternoon just before</v>

692
00:42:20.841 --> 00:42:23.500
Friday.
Monday morning podcast to fall was another 30 minutes.
All right,

693
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:25.940
that's it.
Get the treadmill.
You son of bitches.

694
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:34.783
<v 7>Wow.</v>

695
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:47.103
Ready,

696
00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:00.923
bye

697
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.273
sleep.

698
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:30.840
<v 8>Hey,
what's going on?
It's Belper and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,</v>

699
00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:35.010
January 17th,

700
00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:39.930
2011 that I'm actually doing Tuesday morning,
Tuesday fucking morning.

701
00:43:39.931 --> 00:43:41.550
And I know why a lot of you think I am.

702
00:43:41.551 --> 00:43:46.551
You probably thought I was grieving for an extra 24 hours because the patriots

703
00:43:46.591 --> 00:43:50.460
lost to the fucking hated green cunt jets.

704
00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:54.570
Um,
actually no,
I was in Atlantic city.

705
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.760
I was in Atlantic City and uh,
you know,
I didn't bring the podcast,

706
00:43:59.761 --> 00:44:01.470
all the fucking equipment back.

707
00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:04.830
I came into New York on fucking Tuesday.

708
00:44:04.831 --> 00:44:08.100
I didn't want to be lugging that shit around and then lug it down there and,
uh,

709
00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:12.530
like an asshole.
I didn't realize I had a six o'clock in the evening flight.
Um,

710
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.930
I'm kind of famous for that.
I never know when my flights leave.
I'm always like,

711
00:44:15.931 --> 00:44:16.351
Yay,

712
00:44:16.351 --> 00:44:21.000
I think I leave around 10:00 AM and then I find out it's 6:00 AM as I'm sitting

713
00:44:21.001 --> 00:44:23.910
at a bar drinking at three in the morning,
and then I go,
oh fuck.
Well,

714
00:44:23.911 --> 00:44:28.740
there's no reason to go to bed now.
Is there,
um,
anyways,
so let's,
uh,

715
00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:32.900
let's get down to brass fucking here.
Uh,

716
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.150
this is going to kill me.
Um,

717
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:40.050
out of all the podcasts that I've done for the last,

718
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.620
I've just loving how excited the jets fans are right now.

719
00:44:43.621 --> 00:44:46.260
I know they're sitting there with their fucking ear cupped right up to the God

720
00:44:46.261 --> 00:44:49.920
damn speaker.
You probably giving their fucking boss the finger.
Fuck you.

721
00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:52.360
Motherfucker.
I was waiting all season for this.

722
00:44:52.361 --> 00:44:57.180
There's a big fucking crow laying on his plate and I'm going to watch a meet

723
00:44:57.181 --> 00:45:01.950
every goddamn fucking bite and the feathers.
Um,

724
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.240
yeah.
Out of all the podcasts I've had to do,
this is,

725
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.520
this is to be one of the toughest ones,

726
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.440
toughest things I've ever going to have to say.

727
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:15.390
Congratulations to the New York jets,
their organization to their fans.

728
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.610
You're fucking deserved it.
You went up there,

729
00:45:17.611 --> 00:45:22.260
you were talking shit and you're fucking won the game.
And uh,

730
00:45:22.261 --> 00:45:26.520
and that's,
that's it.
You want it,
you won the fucking game.

731
00:45:26.521 --> 00:45:29.790
And uh,
this is what I think happened,

732
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:34.800
uh,
during the game.
I thought both teams came out.

733
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:39.900
There was so much fucking hype before that game.
And,

734
00:45:39.901 --> 00:45:43.440
uh,
I as always was a nervous Nelly all week.

735
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.710
You don't have as much shit as I talk about the jets and shit.

736
00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:48.210
If you notice when they played the Patriots,

737
00:45:48.211 --> 00:45:50.640
I never claim that we're going to win.
Remember that?

738
00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:54.080
Remember when we the 45 to three game,
remember that before and I was going,
hey,

739
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:59.010
I got a bed.
I got a bad feeling,
man,
that's from being a Boston sports fan,

740
00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:03.420
pre winning championships.
I just always,
I'm a,
I'm,
I'm waiting for the misery.

741
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:08.400
Um,
and I was getting into,
and this is another thing that I didn't like,

742
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:12.120
I didn't like that everyone was saying the Patriots were going to win.

743
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:17.030
And everyone was saying that I got to the airport,
you know,

744
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:20.540
this is me going in New York.
You go to the airport patriots,
uh,

745
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:24.030
or on the cover of sports illustrated.
And I know people go,
oh,

746
00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:28.560
the fucking Jake's,
you know,
this sports illustrated jinx.

747
00:46:28.561 --> 00:46:31.410
You ever think that maybe they just don't know how to pick a winner.

748
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:36.060
You ever think maybe that maybe that's their fucking problem.
Um,

749
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:41.520
I saw that and then I was watching a little bit.
Espn,

750
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:44.040
you only thing I liked was the jets were talking shit.
And I was like,

751
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:47.040
I hope they keep doing this,
just keep doing this.

752
00:46:47.041 --> 00:46:49.800
And I hope they get off the plane wearing fatigues,

753
00:46:49.801 --> 00:46:54.750
like the fucking Miami Hurricanes.
Uh,
that's what I was hoping.

754
00:46:54.751 --> 00:46:56.730
But,
uh,
I was talking to Versie,

755
00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:02.190
my gambling buddy and he was putting money on the Patriots and when he saw,

756
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:06.990
uh,
when rex Ryan said,
you know,
it's going to be me versus Bella check,

757
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.130
he texted me and was going,
dude,
it's over.
It's over.
Why would he do that?

758
00:47:11.131 --> 00:47:15.090
That's the dumbest fucking thing to say.
But Baba Baba and a,
I don't know,

759
00:47:15.091 --> 00:47:17.640
you guys won't believe me if I tell you the whole week I was going look though

760
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:23.600
our defense socks and I've been saying that all fucking year and he's gone.

761
00:47:23.681 --> 00:47:24.450
No did it did,

762
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:28.010
he's just like the giants when the giants went on their fucking run.
No,
it is,
it,

763
00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:32.620
it isn't.
And then he said something else.
He goes,
well,
don't worry.
I got to,

764
00:47:32.621 --> 00:47:36.880
we let up like 24 to 26 points a fucking game for two thirds of the season.

765
00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:41.380
We're starting for fucking rookies.
And he goes,
yeah,
but dude,
dude,

766
00:47:41.381 --> 00:47:44.540
you score like 35 points a game.
And that,

767
00:47:44.541 --> 00:47:48.820
that's when my fucking by heart sank into my stomach.
And I was like,
wow.

768
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:51.640
He just described Dan Marino's career.

769
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.260
How are we going to win the Superbowl?
We don't have a defense.
No worry.

770
00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:00.820
We got Marino.
Hey Daddy,
why don't you go out and score 40 today?

771
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.330
That only works in the regular season.
So

772
00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:09.910
I was like,
look,
all they got to do,
if they establish the run,

773
00:48:09.911 --> 00:48:13.720
we're fucked because they're going to chew up the clock and then Brady is not

774
00:48:13.721 --> 00:48:16.540
going to be on the field.
He can't hurt you if he's not in the field.

775
00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:20.710
So that's what I was worried about.
I was hoping we were going to rate the jets,

776
00:48:20.711 --> 00:48:24.300
but I was worried that if they got their running game going,

777
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:28.750
if lt started fucking running,
we were going to be in trouble.

778
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:33.100
Okay.
Cause I didn't buy into the fucking hype where it's like wow,

779
00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:37.870
this is what we did the last time.
Yeah.
But the time before we lost.
All right.

780
00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:41.980
It's not that we lost 28 to 14 five fucking years ago.

781
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.690
We lost like four months ago.
So I,
this is what I,

782
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.860
this is honestly in my heart of hearts,
what I think happened,

783
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:52.660
the Patriots came out and they picked up right where they left off and then

784
00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:55.840
Brady threw arguably the worst pass of his career.

785
00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:01.720
And I think the Patriots just got spooked.
They got,

786
00:49:01.721 --> 00:49:02.554
they were stunned.

787
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.730
And then the jet's got run the ball down right down to like what,

788
00:49:06.731 --> 00:49:07.870
like the 12 yard line.

789
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:12.900
And then they came out like the fucking keystone cops that first series.

790
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:17.290
Sanchez goes to hand off the ball and he trips is fucking running back.

791
00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:19.770
Then they ran a a fucking,
uh,

792
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:23.020
I blocked so much of this game up because of the pain of watching the Patriots

793
00:49:23.021 --> 00:49:26.740
lose,
but some sort of sweep and whoever was running it,

794
00:49:26.741 --> 00:49:30.190
fake somebody out and then bumped into his own Lyman and then they missed the

795
00:49:30.191 --> 00:49:34.990
field goal.
And I was like,
all right,
the jets a tight,
the jets are tight,

796
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.310
they're fucking nervous.
And then the patriots,
Kay.
And I really think though,

797
00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:43.120
because Brady had not fucked up since October,

798
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.560
I think because of the hype of the game,
they were like,
oh fuck,

799
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.230
not now,
not to this team.

800
00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.680
And for the rest of the game they were pressing and they went right down the

801
00:49:53.681 --> 00:49:58.450
fucking field.
He throws a touchdown pass in,
the guy drops it,

802
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.700
they get a field goal and then I just feel like the rest of the game they were

803
00:50:03.701 --> 00:50:04.870
playing in panic mode.

804
00:50:04.871 --> 00:50:08.740
Like they were up three to nothing and they were playing well,

805
00:50:08.741 --> 00:50:12.790
our defense sucks that they just,
it sucks.
Um,

806
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:14.350
but like the offense would come out and,

807
00:50:14.351 --> 00:50:17.680
and the jets went up seven to three and the patriots come out like they're down

808
00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.070
28 to three.
I just felt they never got into the rhythm.

809
00:50:21.071 --> 00:50:25.600
A lot of it was because of the jets had a monster fucking pass rush.

810
00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.700
But I,
I just was like,

811
00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:29.840
<v 4>yeah,</v>

812
00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.700
<v 8>you know,
they,
they,
they fucking call the fake punt.
Okay.
For,</v>

813
00:50:32.701 --> 00:50:35.630
she dropped a touchdown pass,
you drop the fake punt,

814
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:41.010
you throw a first down to Deon branch and he fucking drops it.
It was like they,

815
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.630
they would just,
I just don't think they up.

816
00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:48.170
They needed to go down on that first drive and score a touchdown.

817
00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:49.730
And the last thing they needed was Brady,

818
00:50:49.731 --> 00:50:53.350
the throw a pic and they just never got gold.

819
00:50:53.351 --> 00:50:56.540
We got going for half a second when we scored that touchdown and had the two

820
00:50:56.541 --> 00:51:01.541
point conversion and it was 14 to 11 and then,

821
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:06.430
uh,
then we had the momentum.

822
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:10.660
We are great.
And we fucking nailed the guy on the kickoff.
And I'm like,
okay,

823
00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:15.790
our defense has to pull one out of their ass here and fucking Clampton down and

824
00:51:15.791 --> 00:51:17.230
we have to get the ball back.

825
00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:22.260
And it was a moment in the fall that was the moment in the game and fucking,

826
00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:24.600
<v 4>yeah,</v>

827
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:29.600
<v 8>Mark Trent Dilfer Sanchez throws a fucking eight yard pass that turns into a 70</v>

828
00:51:30.691 --> 00:51:34.560
yard fucking game.
And that,
that for me,
that was fucking,

829
00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:39.820
that was it.
That was it.
Even though we scored that touchdown in the end,
uh,
it,

830
00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:41.850
it just,
it just wasn't a fucking day.

831
00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:45.870
Even we do onside kicks in the fucking ball seem to be laying there for x eight

832
00:51:45.871 --> 00:51:50.460
seconds and we were running around.
Where is it?
I don't see a jet with it.

833
00:51:50.461 --> 00:51:55.080
I can't find it.
Um,
anyways,

834
00:51:55.081 --> 00:51:58.410
but congratulations to the jets,
man.
You know,
you gotta hand it to them,
do it.

835
00:51:58.411 --> 00:52:02.790
They talked shit and they came in and they fucking want,
but I gotta be honest.

836
00:52:02.791 --> 00:52:06.990
It wasn't as amazing is everybody's making it out to be the same way.

837
00:52:06.991 --> 00:52:11.910
The Patriots are not as amazing as they were made out to be going into this

838
00:52:11.911 --> 00:52:16.560
fucking game.
And it's why I don't watch ESPN and I don't,

839
00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:18.630
uh,
I watched the gay,

840
00:52:18.631 --> 00:52:23.160
I had the game on mute because I knew the game was going to take seven years off

841
00:52:23.161 --> 00:52:27.420
my life unless it went like that 45 to three games,
which to be honest,
jet fans,

842
00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:30.990
I was still nervous when we were up like 28 to nothing.

843
00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:36.850
That's how bad our fucking defense was on that game.
But like,
I don't,
I don't,

844
00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.790
I don't know,
I guess because they're trying to get ratings,

845
00:52:39.791 --> 00:52:43.810
but I don't get how you go one and one during the regular season and then

846
00:52:43.811 --> 00:52:47.830
whatever you did the last time,
you try to act like that's who the fuck you are.

847
00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:51.070
And that's who the other guy is.
Or like the jets,
like there's nothing to,

848
00:52:51.071 --> 00:52:55.120
I gotta let you meals from jet fans.
This one guy goes,
the dynasty is over.

849
00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:58.780
And um,
it's like,
dude,

850
00:52:58.781 --> 00:53:02.260
we haven't won a Superbowl since 2004.

851
00:53:02.261 --> 00:53:04.090
It's been over for seven fucking years.

852
00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:08.410
The dynasty ended when Teddy Bruschi had that,

853
00:53:08.411 --> 00:53:12.700
that fucking mild stroke or seizure or whatever he had.
That was the end of it.

854
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:16.990
And then we,
you know,
we lost a few guys.
We were never quite the same.

855
00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:20.110
But the thing is that's been the same has been Bella check and Brady.

856
00:53:20.111 --> 00:53:23.830
So people are acting like they're beating the Superbowl team.

857
00:53:23.831 --> 00:53:26.850
This is the team that got raped by the ravens last year,

858
00:53:26.851 --> 00:53:30.630
first round or the fucking playoffs.
And uh,

859
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:36.250
you know,
so I dunno.
So whatever,
congratulations.

860
00:53:36.251 --> 00:53:40.300
I still have yet to be proven wrong about the jets though.
Okay.

861
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:43.780
If you guys remember,
because people,
forget what I said.

862
00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:46.810
They said they were going to win the fucking super bowl and they talked to all

863
00:53:46.811 --> 00:53:47.650
this fucking shit.

864
00:53:47.651 --> 00:53:51.610
All they have achieved at this point is getting back to the game that they lost

865
00:53:51.611 --> 00:53:55.720
last year.
So,
uh,
but you know,
whatever my teams out of it,

866
00:53:55.721 --> 00:53:58.450
so I'm done being a cunt.
So whatever good luck jet fans,

867
00:53:58.451 --> 00:54:01.630
you've got a 42 year monkey on your back.
Uh,

868
00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:06.220
I know what that's like times two plus fucking,
uh,
four years,

869
00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:11.440
two years,
whatever it was,
86,
86 fucking years.
So,
uh,
good luck to you.

870
00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.900
This is the thing,
I this,
let me give you the back story.

871
00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:18.930
I was watching this game by myself at the Borgata in Atlantic city.

872
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:22.543
<v 0>MMM.</v>

873
00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:26.020
<v 8>By myself with the mute on,</v>

874
00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:29.620
on the game because I can't,
when games are that big,

875
00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:33.250
I can handle any sort of comment that I consider more ironic.

876
00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.760
Cause at one point don branch caught a ball and he was all amped up and he was

877
00:54:36.761 --> 00:54:41.761
yelling over the jet sidelines and I hit mute and I hear Phil sims going Deon

878
00:54:41.831 --> 00:54:46.750
branch and he's yelling at Rex Ryan.
I don't know why he'd be doing that.

879
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:48.760
Yeah,
why would he,
why would he,

880
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:53.680
why would he yell at that guy who's been talking shit saying that the Brady,

881
00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:54.311
the Brady,

882
00:54:54.311 --> 00:54:57.880
that the Patriots are in a good team and people on their team of call a Brady

883
00:54:57.881 --> 00:55:01.240
and asshole.
Yeah.
Why do you think there would be some sort of chatter?
Phil Sims?

884
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:05.950
Did you play your entire career with the Bose headphones on?

885
00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:09.490
You fucking drove me nuts.
So I had fucking hit mute.

886
00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:15.390
I had to hit mute and uh,
ugh.

887
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:20.500
It was fucking brutal.
And I was,
and I texted Versie at halftime.

888
00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:25.420
This was another turning point at halftime.
Okay.
First of all,
what the fuck?

889
00:55:25.421 --> 00:55:28.300
We gave the Goddamn jets,
the ball on our own,

890
00:55:28.301 --> 00:55:32.950
48 or 30 yard line four fucking times.
And the first half,

891
00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:37.300
the fact that we weren't down like 28 to three at the half was a minor miracle

892
00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:41.470
and the defense actually was stepping up in that half.

893
00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:43.420
But you know,

894
00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:46.240
I knew it was going to come down to the fucking defense because I know a lot of

895
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:48.250
Patriot fans think it was the fucking offense.

896
00:55:48.251 --> 00:55:53.230
But the offense is entitled to have a bad day to struggle every once in a

897
00:55:53.231 --> 00:55:57.460
fucking blue moon.
Okay.
That's when the defense has to step it up.

898
00:55:57.461 --> 00:56:00.550
And we just did not have a defense that could do that.
Okay.

899
00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:04.000
If the defense could have stepped it up and got some three and outs braiding in

900
00:56:04.001 --> 00:56:05.530
them,
they would've got into a rhythm.

901
00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:10.560
We just couldn't get into a fucking rhythm because our defense has been like

902
00:56:10.751 --> 00:56:12.970
room temperature butter all fucking year.

903
00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:14.133
<v 0>MMM.</v>

904
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:19.200
<v 8>So anyways,
when we got that personal foul call,</v>

905
00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:24.440
that undisciplined play that like the San Diego chargers would back in the day,

906
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:29.410
I was just like,
I was,
I,
I hate to say it,
I was like this fucking game is over.

907
00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:34.180
You know,
I still watched,
cause I can't bail on my fucking team.

908
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:35.830
I still watch,
but I was just like,

909
00:56:35.831 --> 00:56:40.831
this fucking game is over like day of completely Ben rattled by the jets.

910
00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:46.410
They're completely out of their fucking game plan and they're playing

911
00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.680
like,
I like an inexperienced fucking team.
Um,

912
00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:52.700
<v 4>okay.</v>

913
00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:56.810
<v 8>And I texted Paul Versey and I wrote,
I fucking,</v>

914
00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:01.840
and then a capital letters told you we had this big debate was working down at

915
00:57:02.601 --> 00:57:06.860
the comedy cellar Friday and I get ready for my big shows with David Tell Jim

916
00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:09.410
Breuer and Jim and Jim Norton down at the Borgata.

917
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:14.390
So I didn't want to be the weak link on that fucking gigantic comedy show.

918
00:57:14.391 --> 00:57:15.470
So I was uh,

919
00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:20.090
just doing my shit around the city and versa gave me a ride home and he was
gone,

920
00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:22.280
dude,
it's going to be a blood bath.
I'm telling you,

921
00:57:22.281 --> 00:57:25.070
it's going to be a fucking bloodbath.
And I was going,
Paul,

922
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:29.440
our defense sucks.
All I gotta do is run the ball.
But that,
that,

923
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:30.890
you know what's funny is that didn't even,
that need,

924
00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.740
neither thing that we said happened.
I thought the jets,

925
00:57:33.741 --> 00:57:36.830
we're really going to establish the fucking run and chew up the clock.

926
00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:40.520
That's what I thought was gonna happen and no way,

927
00:57:40.521 --> 00:57:45.320
shape or form that.
I think Tom Brady was going to have that bad of a game.

928
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:47.000
I mean,
dude,
they were fucking off.

929
00:57:47.001 --> 00:57:51.290
Did you see that one play where Gronk Koski he's running a goal pattern and

930
00:57:51.291 --> 00:57:55.590
Brady throws an out.
It was just like,
what?
What the fuck is going?

931
00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:00.460
They were completely rattled and I don't know if it,

932
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:05.210
I think it was the interception slash all the shit talk and the jets were doing,

933
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:09.980
I think that they wanted to beat him that fucking bad.
That when he fucked up.

934
00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:11.340
<v 4>Okay.</v>

935
00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:15.840
<v 8>MMM.
With that fucking Jesus Christ.
I mean that,
that,</v>

936
00:58:15.841 --> 00:58:20.700
that thing was like a,
if rex Grossman made us instructional video

937
00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:25.470
on how to throw whatever that pass was,

938
00:58:25.471 --> 00:58:30.120
it wasn't a fucking a screen pass.
I don't know what it was.

939
00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:36.210
It was just a,
Oh my God.
It was just like,
I'm going to be picked it off.

940
00:58:36.211 --> 00:58:40.680
And I was like,
oh no.
Oh No.
Not now.

941
00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.530
Not this week.
Not to this fucking team.

942
00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.910
So I have to go down.
This is the funny thing.

943
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:50.700
This is the funniest thing about all of this.

944
00:58:50.701 --> 00:58:54.390
I've talked so much shit about the jets this year.
Last week,

945
00:58:54.391 --> 00:58:57.810
the jets lose to the fucking colts yet when the fucking game,

946
00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:59.310
which is why I think the cult,

947
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:03.930
the jets could win because when you win a championship,
not only are you good,

948
00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:08.130
but you have that stepped in.
Shit luck.
The tuck rule.

949
00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:12.150
What the fuck was that?
Right?
All right,
fuck it.
Give us the ball back.
Yay.

950
00:59:12.151 --> 00:59:13.830
We win the helmet.

951
00:59:13.831 --> 00:59:18.831
Catch you just and with the jets you have the colts calling timeout with 29

952
00:59:19.681 --> 00:59:21.350
seconds left.
You know,

953
00:59:21.351 --> 00:59:26.020
just in case we get the ball back with the 5.5 seconds left,
uh,

954
00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:31.050
take what call the time out here and have mediocre Mark Sanchez with the fucking

955
00:59:31.851 --> 00:59:35.540
deer in the headlights.
Give them a nice minute to chill out.
Gather his thought,

956
00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:39.530
give rex an opportunity to give them next three place so he can chill out.

957
00:59:39.531 --> 00:59:42.230
Next play 18 yard completion game over.

958
00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:47.630
You got to have that stepped in.
Shit.
Luck.
And I just feel like,

959
00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:53.240
I feel like the jets have that.
They have that,
uh,
oh my God,

960
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:54.530
we're gonna lose this game.

961
00:59:54.531 --> 00:59:58.220
And then somebody hits somebody out of bounds for no fucking reason.
Oh,

962
00:59:58.221 --> 01:00:02.840
wait a minute.
We just got a first down.
So
I dunno.

963
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:07.880
This should be a great fucking game this week.
All right.

964
01:00:07.881 --> 01:00:10.070
And I love being a jet hater.

965
01:00:10.071 --> 01:00:13.700
I love that the jets beat Pittsburgh the last time and that the game is in

966
01:00:13.701 --> 01:00:17.690
Pittsburgh and that Polamalu is playing this week.
And uh,

967
01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.230
and I love that ESPN will probably hype the shit out of the jets.

968
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:26.040
That's what I'm hoping.
That's what I'm hoping.
Uh,
so anyway,

969
01:00:26.041 --> 01:00:27.830
so I'm sitting there,
let's get to the misery now.

970
01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:31.760
The misery of my fucking life that day.
So I'm sitting there,
okay.

971
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:38.120
On one of the most unbelievable fucking weekends I've ever done in comedy.

972
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:40.160
Like I got to work with Jim Norton,

973
01:00:40.161 --> 01:00:45.161
Jim Breuer and David tell myself we were all on the same show at the Borgata.

974
01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.550
We played a 2100 Cedar or 20,
whatever,

975
01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:54.170
the fucking big one.
And we sold it out three fucking times.

976
01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:59.090
And I was just sitting there thinking like,
how fucking him it,
first of all,

977
01:00:59.091 --> 01:01:01.460
I had not seen Jim,
let's,
let's go through the lineup here.

978
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:02.990
I had not seen Jim Norton

979
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:09.490
do stand up a headlining set since before the opiate Anthony virus tours.

980
01:01:12.171 --> 01:01:14.960
That's how fucking long it's been because me and him came up together.

981
01:01:14.961 --> 01:01:18.730
So when I started headlining,
he started headlining.
And uh,

982
01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:22.400
he actually blew up,
uh,
before most of us from our,

983
01:01:22.570 --> 01:01:27.300
our graduating class,
he got on the opiate Anthony Show,
um,

984
01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:31.010
pre that whole scandal in the church.
He was already headlining.

985
01:01:31.011 --> 01:01:34.040
So I never got to really,
I never got to work with them.

986
01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:39.950
So he was,
he opened the show so,
and I,

987
01:01:39.951 --> 01:01:41.120
and I was going on next.

988
01:01:41.121 --> 01:01:46.100
So I got to stand there every fucking night watching him work,
watching him,

989
01:01:46.101 --> 01:01:50.660
switched some jokes around and the absolutely killing.
He was fucking hilarious.

990
01:01:50.661 --> 01:01:53.420
He's got this bit on,
uh,
that new show.

991
01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.510
Hoarders that fucking killed me every night.

992
01:01:57.470 --> 01:02:02.090
And uh,
it was,
it was fucking awesome.
Cause you know,
I do the road.
I do it,

993
01:02:02.091 --> 01:02:04.440
you know,
when I go out,
I go with the roads,
I go with Versie but I,

994
01:02:04.441 --> 01:02:07.250
I don't get to work with any of my peers,

995
01:02:07.251 --> 01:02:11.300
like the guys that I started out with anymore.
And then on top of that,

996
01:02:11.301 --> 01:02:15.800
then I had brewer and a tell and those were the guys when I came down from

997
01:02:15.801 --> 01:02:18.020
Boston and I was this fucking nerd,

998
01:02:18.021 --> 01:02:22.740
new comic and I'd be in the back of the Boston comedy club with like my
backpack.

999
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:26.910
I swear to God I had a backpack.
Right.
Cause I would walk around,
you know,

1000
01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:31.680
on the subway and I had all my shit and there my comedy notebook,
you know,

1001
01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.960
just in case comedy inspiration at me,

1002
01:02:33.961 --> 01:02:38.040
I was a total fucking nerd and I used to sit at the back of the Boston Comedy

1003
01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.920
Club,
which they should make a fucking movie about that place.

1004
01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:46.490
It was the ripest most intimidating fucking Rome I ever went into.

1005
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.290
Um,
I mean in a lot of ways it was worse.
I did the Apollo one time,

1006
01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:55.710
it was worse than that.
Um,
cause the Apollo,

1007
01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:59.760
there's this odd sort of no pressure because you're expecting to get booed.

1008
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:02.880
He still,
you don't want to get booed,
but if you get booed,

1009
01:03:02.881 --> 01:03:05.310
I mean the amount of p they booed.
Like Lauren Hill,

1010
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:10.140
like famous superstars have gotten booed so it's not that bad.
But like,
uh,

1011
01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:16.100
the way the Boston Comedy Club was run back in the day was completely opposite

1012
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:21.960
to a,
all the other comedy clubs that I make,
at least in my experience,

1013
01:03:21.961 --> 01:03:26.610
like this is how they would do it.
They would,
uh,
you know,

1014
01:03:26.611 --> 01:03:29.640
if you came down and you are a new comic and they were going to put you on,

1015
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.560
they put you on early in the show and they tried to,
uh,
you know,

1016
01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:39.561
assess where you were as a comedian by sticking you basically in the show where

1017
01:03:39.931 --> 01:03:43.410
they figured your talents we're at,
which is,
you know,
if you're newer,

1018
01:03:43.411 --> 01:03:47.420
they put you earlier in the show,
the Boston Comedy Club,
if you came down,

1019
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:49.890
they're like,
oh yeah,
you're new comic.
You want to go on all right.

1020
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:55.100
They put you on like three quarters through the show after like fucking Louis C

1021
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.251
Ck,
Jim Breuer,

1022
01:03:56.251 --> 01:04:00.780
Jay Moore had just leveled the fucking room and then you all right,

1023
01:04:00.781 --> 01:04:05.370
you want to go on next,
right.
And you literally would feel like,

1024
01:04:05.371 --> 01:04:07.260
you know those spike Lee movies where the,

1025
01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:10.950
where the main character that he'd be focusing on is just standing there.

1026
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.040
But the background is like slowly pulling away.
That's,

1027
01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:17.430
that's what I would feel like.
And I would immediately go from,
you know,

1028
01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.940
feeling like,
you know,

1029
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:24.930
five foot 10 to feeling like I was like three foot 10 I and I,

1030
01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:29.190
it was fucking unbelievable.
I was the worst.

1031
01:04:29.191 --> 01:04:32.580
And then all comics hung out in the back and you were convinced that they all

1032
01:04:32.581 --> 01:04:35.520
thought you sucked and they were all watching you.
It was,
it was brutal.

1033
01:04:35.521 --> 01:04:35.921
So anyway,

1034
01:04:35.921 --> 01:04:40.921
so I got to work with those guys this weekend and I'm,

1035
01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:46.610
I'm sitting there like a fan all weekend and the crowds were amazing and a,

1036
01:04:46.921 --> 01:04:48.870
but the whole weekend is fucking jets.

1037
01:04:48.871 --> 01:04:53.040
Patriots game is looming and I'm sitting here going,

1038
01:04:53.041 --> 01:04:57.660
this fucking game can go either goddamn way.
They won once we won once.

1039
01:04:57.661 --> 01:05:00.120
I don't know what the fuck everybody's talking about.

1040
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.580
Like this is going to be a cakewalk.
Our defense sauce.

1041
01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:09.390
All right,
and I'm just sitting there at one point,

1042
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.480
it was actually last week when the jets beat the colts.

1043
01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:16.230
I'm sitting there going like,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

1044
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.720
I'm literally talking to the comedy guts going,

1045
01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.800
what are the fucking odds that the team I've been talking shit about for the

1046
01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:30.890
entire fucking year.
He's not only,

1047
01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.330
<v 4>yeah.</v>

1048
01:05:32.330 --> 01:05:37.040
<v 8>Gonna make the playoffs back into the fucking playoffs.
Lose a playoff game,</v>

1049
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:39.440
but then fucking win the fucking thing.

1050
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:44.810
The next week they're going to play my fucking team.
All right?

1051
01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:46.850
And I'm going to be in New Jersey.

1052
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:48.080
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1053
01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:52.520
<v 8>The fucking game is at four o'clock or four 30 whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1054
01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:56.540
And I go on stage at eight in New Jersey,

1055
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:59.270
in front of a bunch of fucking jet fans.

1056
01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:04.190
Why does this keep happening to me?
It's unfucking.

1057
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:08.960
I can't,
I can't explain it.
I go down to Philly,

1058
01:06:08.961 --> 01:06:11.960
all that fucking shit out.
I guess that had nothing to do about sports.

1059
01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:16.070
Sports pulled me out of the mud down there.
Another fucking time.

1060
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:19.940
I have a random weekend booked at Caroline's.
Oh,

1061
01:06:19.941 --> 01:06:23.600
random fucking weekend.
They book it like six,
seven,
eight months out.

1062
01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:24.880
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1063
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.080
<v 8>And Lo and behold,
the weekend I come in,
the first night I come in,</v>

1064
01:06:29.081 --> 01:06:32.110
the night I fly in to do morning press.

1065
01:06:32.111 --> 01:06:34.210
I flew in on like a fucking Thursday or Wednesday,

1066
01:06:34.211 --> 01:06:37.870
I can't remember what the fucking Yankees win the world series.

1067
01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:39.700
And I'm staying in Times Square.

1068
01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:44.260
I'm trying to sleep and I can't cause all I hear is out in the fucking outside

1069
01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:45.094
my hotel window

1070
01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:52.070
and I'm sitting there with pillows on each side of my fucking head.

1071
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:53.510
So now I'm sitting,
yeah,

1072
01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:58.530
<v 10>no.
And I'm going,
this is classic,
my career.</v>

1073
01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:03.540
This is either going to be fucking amazing or an absolute God damn debacle.

1074
01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.840
And I was sitting in my fucking hotel room and Brady threw that tech and I was

1075
01:07:08.971 --> 01:07:13.080
like,
oh my God.
Oh my God,
please.
No,
please,

1076
01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:17.530
please don't.
Not this week for the love of fucking God kitchen.
Not,

1077
01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:22.890
I'm trying to go a hundred days without boozing.
Kenyan not do it this week.

1078
01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:26.490
I know we're not good enough to win the Superbowl this fucking year.

1079
01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.440
I know we're going to lose in the playoffs,

1080
01:07:28.441 --> 01:07:33.441
but can we just not lose to these fucking shit talking conch please.

1081
01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:37.680
Right.

1082
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:42.080
And then they fucking keystone cop did and missed a field goal and we drove down

1083
01:07:42.081 --> 01:07:46.590
there and I ended it just,
it just,
it just fucking unraveled.

1084
01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.260
And the whole time I'm sitting there going,

1085
01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:53.430
what is going to happen at my standup show?

1086
01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:55.580
<v 8>What?</v>

1087
01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:58.450
Cause I already have been walking around the casino in a day and all I'm seeing

1088
01:07:58.451 --> 01:08:02.050
is jets,
jerseys.
I see a couple of,
I'm in fucking Atlantic City,
New Jersey.

1089
01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:06.870
All right.
The Eagles are not in the playoffs.
There's no playoffs,

1090
01:08:06.871 --> 01:08:09.150
there's no eagles fans,
dance jets fans.

1091
01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:14.480
And I get to show to fucking do and I perform in an art where it's okay to yell

1092
01:08:15.951 --> 01:08:20.360
at you,
fucking suck you faggot.
It's okay to do that.

1093
01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:25.810
And I'm watching my team unravel and I'm just sitting there ironing my show

1094
01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:28.124
shirt.

1095
01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:33.723
<v 11>Okay,</v>

1096
01:08:33.730 --> 01:08:37.790
<v 8>go.
And not only do I got to do a podcast and eat fucking crow,</v>

1097
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:43.030
I now have to go down a dance like a fucking monkey for a bunch of God damn

1098
01:08:43.251 --> 01:08:46.340
elated jet fans who are,

1099
01:08:46.341 --> 01:08:49.970
who are probably going to be yelling JTS jets,
jets,
jets.

1100
01:08:49.971 --> 01:08:53.750
Every time I'm trying to do a punchline,
why does this keep happening to me?

1101
01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:58.410
Why couldn't I bet in fucking Ohio?
All right,

1102
01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:03.000
so now it's seven 30.
The game is basically fucking over.

1103
01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.430
And then there's a knock on the door at security to bring me downstairs,

1104
01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.400
which is absolutely fucking hilarious.
Like,
you know,
like,
I need that,

1105
01:09:11.401 --> 01:09:15.930
but you know,
I'll feed my fucking ego and the door opens up.

1106
01:09:15.931 --> 01:09:18.810
And I was just like,
I fucking knew it.
I fucking knew it.

1107
01:09:18.811 --> 01:09:21.360
I fucking called it that fucking Versie cunt.

1108
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:24.840
He's not answering his fucking phone.
I fucking told him,

1109
01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:28.950
I fucking told him I knew this was going to fucking happen,
right.

1110
01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.990
And,
uh,
the guys takes me downstairs and I'm thinking,
well,

1111
01:09:33.991 --> 01:09:38.910
you know what's great about this shit is they're taken me the Goodfellas way so

1112
01:09:38.911 --> 01:09:42.210
I can go down in the elevator.

1113
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:46.830
I'm in the catacombs behind the fucking massive theater.

1114
01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:52.020
I'll just sit there.
I'll watch the final fucking minutes of the game,
you know,

1115
01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:57.890
because unlike those other fucking fairweather fans who left Gillette stadium,

1116
01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.790
you know,
I'll get to that later.

1117
01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:06.060
But there's a reason why they build stadiums as big as they do.

1118
01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:09.930
It's for all the fairweather fucking fance.
All right?

1119
01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:14.640
And it's also why you should never be upset if somebody you love doesn't return

1120
01:10:14.641 --> 01:10:19.620
a fee,
a fucking fan letter,
because that's what fans are.
That's what they are,

1121
01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.530
you know,
entertain me.
I love you.

1122
01:10:22.531 --> 01:10:26.310
As long as you should do what I want and then you don't,
when you're down,

1123
01:10:26.311 --> 01:10:29.460
I'm going to walk out on you.
And I'm guilty of it too.

1124
01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:33.780
I've had plenty of fucking people that I've been fans of that went broke.

1125
01:10:33.781 --> 01:10:37.620
I never sent him any God damn money.
I just,

1126
01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:38.820
I just talked to my friend,

1127
01:10:38.821 --> 01:10:43.200
do what the fuck happened and what happened to Leif Garrett,
Leif Garrett.

1128
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:48.330
So anyway,
so I'm going down into the,
uh,
in the,
I'm thinking,
well,

1129
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:50.430
whatever,
or,
you know,
what the,
what the fuck?

1130
01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:53.580
There's no way it's going to be worse than Philly.
Um,

1131
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.410
I just got to address it the second I go out there,
right?
So on,

1132
01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:02.220
but at least I can just have this moment of peace if fucking deal with the fact

1133
01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:05.670
that what I kind of knew was gonna happen was gonna happen.

1134
01:11:05.671 --> 01:11:07.230
I just didn't want it to happen to the jet.

1135
01:11:07.231 --> 01:11:10.500
So I'm fucking decompressing from that loss.
I got to set it aside,

1136
01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:14.670
cause now I have to go fucking out there and be like a God damn cloud.

1137
01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:19.320
So as I'm sitting there watching the final fucking seconds of it,

1138
01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:24.321
all of a sudden I hear Jim brewer coming down the fucking corridor going,

1139
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:29.550
you fucking believe this shit.
You fucking,
it just keeps getting louder.

1140
01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:33.510
I'm like,
please don't walk into my dressing room.
And he just comes walking in.

1141
01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:36.620
He's like,
the fucking Patriot did.

1142
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:41.220
He starts miming jerking off in my face and he goes like,

1143
01:11:41.221 --> 01:11:45.810
he just blew a load in my face,
right?
He goes,
fuck you mother fucker.

1144
01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:46.570
Like I

1145
01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:47.980
<v 10>talking shit all weekend.</v>

1146
01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:52.030
It proceeds to start trashing me and the Patriots.

1147
01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:55.420
And it was actually fucking hilarious because I saw in him,

1148
01:11:55.421 --> 01:12:00.421
I saw me last year screaming about Peyton manning cause you only hear shit about

1149
01:12:00.551 --> 01:12:03.640
your team.
You know,
you never hear anything fair and balanced.

1150
01:12:03.641 --> 01:12:04.474
And he's sitting there,

1151
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:09.160
<v 8>oh Tom Brady,
he's so great,
his fucking quarterback ever.</v>

1152
01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:10.140
It was literally

1153
01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:13.890
<v 10>my rent from last year about Peyton manning.
So,
ah,</v>

1154
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:17.140
was I getting my just desserts and I,

1155
01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.570
he just kept trashing me and then I said like,
I'll fuck you.

1156
01:12:20.571 --> 01:12:23.720
You still haven't won one since 1969.
He goes,
fuck you,

1157
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:26.960
you sound like a Yankee Fan faggot.
And he's,

1158
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:33.800
I took a pounding from him.
Um,

1159
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:37.880
classic jet Fan though,
didn't say shit before the game was all fucking nervous,

1160
01:12:37.881 --> 01:12:40.490
just like every was,
everybody was admitted.

1161
01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.270
<v 8>I didn't get any emails from jet fans and afterwards,
you know what,</v>

1162
01:12:44.271 --> 01:12:49.260
only got a few and it was from the usual country ones that,
uh,
you know,

1163
01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:52.950
really need to go hug their dad or whatever.
So then I'm sitting there going,

1164
01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:57.870
oh my God.
And a Norton came in and he was kind of fucking laugh.

1165
01:12:57.871 --> 01:13:01.680
And he goes,
you're bummed out.
I go,
yeah,
I got him.
I know I'm past it,
dude.

1166
01:13:01.681 --> 01:13:05.720
I got to do this.
And I go,
hey guys,
give me a lot of jet fans out there.

1167
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:06.643
Isn't there?

1168
01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.233
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1169
01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:15.110
<v 8>Why,
why comedy gods?
Why did I have to be in Atlantic city?</v>

1170
01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.680
Why did I have to be working with Jim Brewer as much as I fucking love the guy,

1171
01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:22.130
why did I have to work be working with a jet fan?
You know why?

1172
01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:25.460
Because I deserved it because I've been talking shit all fucking year.

1173
01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:30.950
I actually became what?
I didn't want to be what I was trashing Rex Ryan for.

1174
01:13:30.951 --> 01:13:35.750
So anyways,
so now I'm standing out in the waste 20 fucking 100 people.

1175
01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:38.750
So I'm peeking through the curtain,
right?

1176
01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:42.740
Like some fucking open miker who's never been on stage before.

1177
01:13:42.741 --> 01:13:46.880
I look in the front row and what do I see?
I see like five jet jerseys,

1178
01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.870
some fat fuck with the jets hat and unless God,
Oh God,

1179
01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:55.400
Oh God,
here we go.
Here we go.
God dammit.

1180
01:13:56.990 --> 01:14:01.910
Ah,
fight.
If I could clone myself right now and put a fucking,
God damn,

1181
01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:04.570
I'm doing standup sport coat on this person,
I would.

1182
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:10.530
So Jimmy goes out there,
it all week.
He just kept,

1183
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:14.740
he just getting funnier.
It was,
it was really fucking awesome watching him.
Ed.

1184
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.740
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1185
01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:19.760
<v 8>He actually took one joke that was killing in the,
uh,
the end of a set.</v>

1186
01:14:19.761 --> 01:14:24.380
He put it at the beginning and it fucking just destroys and then he's just

1187
01:14:24.381 --> 01:14:27.530
murder up.
They keep murdered them twice Saturday night,

1188
01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:32.560
but his clearly just fucking take it to another level and I'm just laughing

1189
01:14:32.691 --> 01:14:36.560
going and Jimmy's going to have a set where I can't even follow him.

1190
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:40.070
Really comedy gods.
This is really going to fucking happen.

1191
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.680
And uh,
I'm sitting there and then this is okay for all you comedians out there.

1192
01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:48.690
I was like,
all right,
what do I gotta do?
What?
Oh,

1193
01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:52.280
well how am I going to get out of this?
What is,
what is the,

1194
01:14:52.281 --> 01:14:55.040
I can't just go out there and start doing my fucking act

1195
01:14:56.770 --> 01:14:58.210
and act like nothing's happening.

1196
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.820
I was thinking of going out there and the second they started yelling about the

1197
01:15:00.821 --> 01:15:02.740
jets,
I was gonna be like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'm taping the game.

1198
01:15:02.741 --> 01:15:04.660
Don't tell me what happens.
They'll tell me what happened.

1199
01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:08.750
But that would be funny for like three fucking seconds.
So I finally,

1200
01:15:08.751 --> 01:15:11.320
it's just going like what I always do whenever I,

1201
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:15.400
before I'm going out on stage and I just don't feel like I'm going to have a

1202
01:15:15.401 --> 01:15:19.270
good set and I don't feel like I'm funny.
I just said,
what am I feeling?

1203
01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:23.070
What am I thinking?
I am thinking,
fuck,

1204
01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.320
I can't believe the patriots lost.

1205
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:30.830
And I've all fucking states that I have to be in to watch them lose to the team

1206
01:15:30.871 --> 01:15:34.710
that I hate the most right now.
Why did I have to be in New Jersey?

1207
01:15:34.711 --> 01:15:37.830
And I was literally like,
up,
there's your opener.
That is your opener.

1208
01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.330
And that's what I went out to.

1209
01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:42.610
And all the jets fans would die and fucking laughing.

1210
01:15:42.611 --> 01:15:45.510
And then they left me alone.
They didn't give a fuck.
They will fucking elated.

1211
01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.210
And,
uh,
although I couldn't,

1212
01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:51.450
I couldn't slow down at any point during my set.

1213
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:54.930
Like the crowds are so great all weekend.
Usually when you have a crowd that big,

1214
01:15:54.931 --> 01:15:58.560
you can't really bring them down to try to build it back up again.

1215
01:15:58.561 --> 01:16:00.900
You have to kind of just killed the whole time.

1216
01:16:01.530 --> 01:16:04.770
I noticed you could bring up down,
which was so great the whole weekend.
But,

1217
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:07.260
but during that set,
every time I would bring it down,

1218
01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:09.440
that would always be one guy.
Yeah.
Fuck it.

1219
01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:19.650
So,
so I took my pounding,
so there you go.
Congratulations.

1220
01:16:19.651 --> 01:16:22.920
Seriously.
And I got to,
I have to,
I have to admit stuff to two.
I walked by like,

1221
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:26.130
you know when your team fucking loses a game like this,

1222
01:16:26.131 --> 01:16:30.570
will you give a fuck like this?
You cannot watch ESPN for a good three days.

1223
01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:35.550
And I haven't been able to do that a lot this year.

1224
01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.730
I couldn't do it when the Ravens raped us.

1225
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:41.820
I guess it was a year ago when the ravens raped us last year in the playoffs.

1226
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:46.710
Playoffs.
I didn't watch it for like three fucking days.

1227
01:16:47.490 --> 01:16:52.260
Um,
when the Lakers beat us in game seven,
you know,

1228
01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:56.730
when,
uh,
there were their 12th man came off the bench with those striped shirts,

1229
01:16:57.190 --> 01:17:00.480
it just started fucking calling fouls and technical files and all that shit.

1230
01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:04.250
I'll never get over that by the way.
Um,

1231
01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.510
I didn't watch it for like fucking four.
I couldn't eat,

1232
01:17:06.511 --> 01:17:10.280
I couldn't even watch TV cause I live in Los Angeles.
I had close the windows,

1233
01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:14.630
Lakers Faulker I had to deal with that.
Um,

1234
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:20.480
and then this one,
I've had three bad things come in threes,
right?

1235
01:17:20.481 --> 01:17:22.550
People I don't believe in that either.
You just,

1236
01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:27.530
you just start recounting after three.
Um,
and this is one of them.

1237
01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:30.200
I just,
but I just could not watch it.

1238
01:17:30.201 --> 01:17:34.970
I still have not watched one second of ESPN.
I flipped by real quick with,

1239
01:17:34.971 --> 01:17:39.850
with the,
with the mute button on and if there's a game on,
I watched the game.
Um,

1240
01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:41.150
<v 4>okay.</v>

1241
01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:46.150
<v 8>But I walked by a TV and I saw Rex Ryan doing the press conference.</v>

1242
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:50.240
I only heard a couple things he had,

1243
01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:55.220
but he had a genuine look of joy in his face.
And for half a second,

1244
01:17:55.221 --> 01:17:59.240
I was actually somewhere in my jet Hayton mind,

1245
01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:01.550
happy for the guy like,
ah,
the motherfucker,

1246
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:07.070
he did it and he fucking did it.
That son of a bitch eight Oh,
whatever.

1247
01:18:07.071 --> 01:18:08.010
I might be a conflict,

1248
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:13.030
but I can't take it to the level of truly wishing that level of misery.

1249
01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.030
You know,
they haven't won it since 1969 and me,
but to be honest with yourself,

1250
01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:23.030
this is what I think when you realize,
if you're a problem fan,

1251
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:27.530
where you're taking it to the point where you're really just,

1252
01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:31.220
I like the point that I've taken it.
Um,

1253
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:34.700
where it's just no fun to be a sports fan where you literally take it to the

1254
01:18:34.701 --> 01:18:37.910
point where you don't want a,

1255
01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:39.480
<v 4>yeah.</v>

1256
01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.400
<v 8>Like I remember like the,
the,
I probably age,</v>

1257
01:18:41.401 --> 01:18:45.840
like 11 years after the Red Sox won in 2004 every year,

1258
01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:49.290
praying for the Yankees to never win another fucking world series.

1259
01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:51.750
Like that wasn't going to happen.
You know,

1260
01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.410
$200 million every fucking year on the table,
you know,

1261
01:18:55.411 --> 01:18:59.970
plus a fucking great organization.
It's going to happen.
Um,

1262
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:04.290
it's just too much fucking energy.
So my team is out of it.

1263
01:19:05.010 --> 01:19:08.890
I have done shit talking,
and even if the jets fucking lose,
I,

1264
01:19:08.930 --> 01:19:13.140
I'm not going to do that to you because you beat my team and that,
and that's,

1265
01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.000
you know,
that's a fucking bitch move.

1266
01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:19.800
I'm not going to do it so seriously from the bottom of my jet hating heart.

1267
01:19:19.801 --> 01:19:22.320
Congratulations to all you guys.
You deserve it and joy.

1268
01:19:22.321 --> 01:19:25.500
You're fucking week and a know this,

1269
01:19:25.501 --> 01:19:30.501
that you guys next week now carry the pressure of being,

1270
01:19:30.670 --> 01:19:30.780
oh,

1271
01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:35.780
the only thing that stands in the way of a date rape is possibly going on to win

1272
01:19:36.211 --> 01:19:37.830
his third super bowl championship.

1273
01:19:42.370 --> 01:19:45.970
Dude,
Ben Roethlisberger quietly.

1274
01:19:46.710 --> 01:19:47.080
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1275
01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.220
<v 8>Very quietly.
I mean,</v>

1276
01:19:48.221 --> 01:19:51.580
date rape charges really drowned out a lot of on the field success.

1277
01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:56.200
Let's be fair,
very quietly.
Uh,

1278
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:57.480
<v 4>okay.</v>

1279
01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.780
<v 8>Could join the ranks of,
as far as I know,</v>

1280
01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.830
if he wins his third one,
he's on the only,

1281
01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:08.280
he's with Tom Brady and Troy Aikman.

1282
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:10.080
They're the only other guys who've won three.
Right.

1283
01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:14.430
And then there's only two guys have one.
Four is Montana and Bradshaw.

1284
01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:17.940
Am I correct?
Am I missing somebody?
I thought Jim Plunkett for half a second,

1285
01:20:17.941 --> 01:20:22.140
but that was Kenny Stabler and 77.
So,
uh,
Oh,

1286
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:24.930
let me tell jet fans.
I gotta get,
I gotta I owe this to you guys.

1287
01:20:24.931 --> 01:20:26.400
I've got to let you know all my misery.

1288
01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:28.190
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1289
01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:29.600
<v 8>So at the end of the show,</v>

1290
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:35.210
the show fucking ends and uh,
it's the end of the week.

1291
01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:36.411
And uh,

1292
01:20:36.411 --> 01:20:40.700
I took a bunch of pictures with fucking jet fans wearing jerseys and uh,

1293
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:44.610
it was actually,
we,
it was actually ended up being a good time,
but the,

1294
01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:49.380
the best thing was afterwards,
you know,
Norton into tell left,

1295
01:20:49.381 --> 01:20:51.440
cause you know,
they live in New York,
they took off.

1296
01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.230
Brewer was handed with hanging with some friends.

1297
01:20:54.231 --> 01:20:58.940
So I go back to my fucking room by myself.
No security,
no,
not the,

1298
01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:03.110
not now.
Look,
I needed it,
but I walked back through the catacombs,

1299
01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:06.650
the fucking Goodfellas way by myself.

1300
01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:09.050
Just thinking about the loss.

1301
01:21:09.051 --> 01:21:13.400
All I hear is the sound of my shoes hitting the tile floor,

1302
01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:19.490
walking to that service elevator that looks like shit because they,
you know,

1303
01:21:19.491 --> 01:21:23.270
they move furniture in.
It went up to my floor.

1304
01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:25.200
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1305
01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:30.120
<v 8>Went into this amazing suite that they had given me</v>

1306
01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:33.670
by myself.
I sat there,

1307
01:21:34.450 --> 01:21:39.340
I ordered room service and by myself with the TV off and only one light on in

1308
01:21:39.341 --> 01:21:43.000
silence.
I ate a cheeseburger,

1309
01:21:43.810 --> 01:21:48.010
some French fries.
And I got,
uh,
some cheesecake for dessert.

1310
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:54.930
And I just sat there.

1311
01:21:54.931 --> 01:21:59.760
I couldn't put the TV on and I just sat there in silence and then it hit me and

1312
01:21:59.761 --> 01:22:04.080
I was like,
oh my God,
I have to do the podcast and relive this.

1313
01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:11.840
So there you go.
I hope you jet fans deserved,
not deserved.
Outbeat do.

1314
01:22:11.841 --> 01:22:14.720
Jet Fans enjoyed that and I apologize that I,

1315
01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:17.750
when I got off the plane that I didn't come home.

1316
01:22:17.751 --> 01:22:20.660
I didn't come right home and do a podcast.
I could have,

1317
01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:25.040
but I really wanted to make sure that I did it justice,

1318
01:22:25.041 --> 01:22:29.030
that I got a good night's sleep.
I didn't want to do a lane podcast.

1319
01:22:29.031 --> 01:22:30.370
That podcast last week sucked.

1320
01:22:30.371 --> 01:22:33.590
I was getting ready to leave as the worst podcast I think I've ever done.

1321
01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:38.870
And uh,
I wanted to make sure that I,
you know,

1322
01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:43.220
I tried to remember all of my misery because I really felt,
you know,

1323
01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:47.690
that's one of the joys of winning is when a loud mouth can't from the other
team,

1324
01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:52.370
you know,
they're miserable.
So I hope I didn't leave any details out.

1325
01:22:52.371 --> 01:22:53.810
I got a couple of emails.

1326
01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:55.850
<v 11>MMM.</v>

1327
01:22:57.090 --> 01:22:57.451
<v 8>I Dunno,</v>

1328
01:22:57.451 --> 01:23:00.030
but here's what I wanted that somebody said there was a couple of things I

1329
01:23:00.031 --> 01:23:01.230
thought was funny.
Some guy,

1330
01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:06.430
a jets fan who went up to a fuck squirrel.

1331
01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:11.020
Oh,
you know what I have,
I have a feeling I'm just worried.

1332
01:23:11.021 --> 01:23:13.690
I'm not going to end up talking about the amazing look.
Can I just talk about it?

1333
01:23:13.691 --> 01:23:16.600
How Great Atlantic City was and why you guys have to see this show.

1334
01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:20.230
Because I think we're going to take it to Connecticut at one of the casinos up

1335
01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:23.350
there.
And even if we don't,
if things don't work out,

1336
01:23:23.351 --> 01:23:25.390
which I know they're going to cause it was a fucking,

1337
01:23:25.570 --> 01:23:28.540
I want to thank everybody who came out to the shows.

1338
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:32.800
It was really a fucking event.
Um,

1339
01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:36.640
and I don't overhype shows that I'm on,

1340
01:23:36.641 --> 01:23:41.641
but it was arguably one of the best comedy show easily that I've been on in the

1341
01:23:43.091 --> 01:23:44.770
last fucking 10 years,

1342
01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:50.050
and it's the strongest tore I v I think I've ever been on.
I mean,

1343
01:23:50.051 --> 01:23:54.560
those opie and Anthony ones were fucking amazing.
Those were amazing low.
Uh,

1344
01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:55.810
especially that night in Philly.

1345
01:23:55.811 --> 01:24:00.550
That's what's so funny about those fucking idiot Philly fans.
If you saw the,

1346
01:24:00.551 --> 01:24:05.320
you know,
the lineup that night was Patrice O'neil,
Robert Kelly,
Tracy Morgan.

1347
01:24:05.321 --> 01:24:09.970
Ralphie made Jim Norton,
me.
Who else was out there?
I'm going to forget.

1348
01:24:09.971 --> 01:24:13.460
Bob said it was fucking insane.
It was like one of,
you know,

1349
01:24:13.461 --> 01:24:16.690
when those rock and roll hall of fame shows where they bring out like fucking

1350
01:24:16.691 --> 01:24:20.890
all these musicians and stick them on the stage and then somehow it always
sucks.

1351
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:27.490
Is it ever good when you have 58 guitarist in 19 drummers?
It never,

1352
01:24:27.491 --> 01:24:28.510
it never sounds good.

1353
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:33.670
And then they always play like mama kin or some fucking standard hail,
hail,

1354
01:24:33.671 --> 01:24:37.150
rock and roll or some stupid shit that the way this is what is the first show?

1355
01:24:37.151 --> 01:24:39.850
And we played,
we were 60,
um,

1356
01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:43.840
except it was actually a great show.
But um,
this is so,

1357
01:24:43.841 --> 01:24:48.841
this will be the strongest one that I've been on since the ONA virus tour and a

1358
01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:51.280
opie and Anthony came down to it.
It was fucking great.

1359
01:24:51.281 --> 01:24:54.220
I was hanging out with both of them.
Um,

1360
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.290
Anthony is absolutely fucking hilarious and it needs to be a documentary made

1361
01:24:59.291 --> 01:25:02.350
about people who played blackjack.
He came,

1362
01:25:02.351 --> 01:25:06.400
he came in from playing blackjack and he had sweat under his armpits.

1363
01:25:06.670 --> 01:25:11.620
Like he had been playing full court basketball in a turtle neck sweater.

1364
01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.190
Um,
it was awesome.
And I wonder what,

1365
01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:17.380
I watched him gamble and he was hilarious and he was cursing out this fucking

1366
01:25:17.381 --> 01:25:20.140
retard who didn't know how to,
didn't know how to gamble.

1367
01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:25.540
He fucking hit on 17,
went over and then the dealer got 21.
And,

1368
01:25:25.541 --> 01:25:29.860
uh,
I swear to God,
if Anthony killed him right then and there,

1369
01:25:29.861 --> 01:25:32.650
I would have,
I would have become an accessory to murder,

1370
01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:34.540
not in that I would've helped him kill him,

1371
01:25:34.541 --> 01:25:38.950
but I definitely would have helped to hide Anthony from the authorities.
Um,

1372
01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:43.090
do you mind if we come in?
Mr Burn?
Uh,
do you have a warrant?
Yes,
we do.

1373
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:47.800
Uh,
yeah,
just,
uh,
just stay out of the bedroom.
Uh,
it's not really cleaned up.

1374
01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:53.020
Um,
anyways,
it was an unbelievable night and uh,

1375
01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:55.120
I don't know when we're going to do the show again,

1376
01:25:55.121 --> 01:25:58.090
but I have to tell you if you get a chance to see any of those three fucking

1377
01:25:58.091 --> 01:26:03.010
guys like Jim Norton's,
that is the funniest I've ever fucking seen him.

1378
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:08.180
Attell is a
fucking beast.
And Jim Brewer,
I'm telling you,

1379
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:13.330
has one of the top 10 funniest fucking bitch I've ever seen.

1380
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:19.730
Uh,
obviously I'm not going to,
you know,
ruined what the fuck it is.

1381
01:26:19.731 --> 01:26:24.731
But it starts off I was standing up watching him and by the time he was done,

1382
01:26:25.311 --> 01:26:29.090
I was slumped down.
I made us a fucking dirty casino rug.

1383
01:26:29.091 --> 01:26:32.120
If I could have fucking been laying on the ground laughing,
I would have,

1384
01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:33.690
but I was actually,
you know,

1385
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:36.320
I was crouching down and you have a c like when they gamble in China,

1386
01:26:36.321 --> 01:26:39.230
you know how they crouched down and I was sorta sitting like that but I was

1387
01:26:39.231 --> 01:26:42.890
fucking dying laughing like lean sideways into the wall.

1388
01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:45.200
This is how funny the joke was.

1389
01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:49.310
I actually was downstairs in the green room at one point and called Nia while

1390
01:26:49.311 --> 01:26:52.940
Jim was on stage and you could hear the show and I put the phone up to the bit

1391
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.920
and she was dying laughing.
So if you guys get a chance to see any of them,

1392
01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:02.810
go on their websites,
go see them because uh,
it,

1393
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:06.110
it was just a fucking unbelievable weekend and I really,

1394
01:27:06.111 --> 01:27:09.710
really hope that we get to do it again and a,

1395
01:27:09.711 --> 01:27:12.260
and I want to thank Jim Norton for putting the whole thing together.

1396
01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:17.720
It's just a great idea.
And the fans were fucking amazing.
They were quiet.

1397
01:27:17.721 --> 01:27:21.140
They would laugh and then they,
then they would be quiet and let you set it up.

1398
01:27:21.141 --> 01:27:24.580
I felt like I was working at the cellar,
you know where you are,

1399
01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.420
just a great comedy room,

1400
01:27:26.630 --> 01:27:31.220
but it was his fucking 2100 Cedar conference from.

1401
01:27:31.221 --> 01:27:34.010
So uh,
I hope you guys all had a great time.

1402
01:27:34.011 --> 01:27:38.480
I got ridiculous emails about people telling me how funny the show is and I got

1403
01:27:38.481 --> 01:27:42.110
like three emails from people telling me that was the first comedy show they

1404
01:27:42.111 --> 01:27:46.430
ever went to.
Um,
well all I can say as you pick the fucking right one.

1405
01:27:46.431 --> 01:27:51.080
So that's it.
So I'll let you guys know when we're going to be doing more.

1406
01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:53.750
Um,
all right,
so here's,

1407
01:27:53.751 --> 01:27:57.770
here's an email I got from a jet Fan who went up to Gillette stadium.
Alright.

1408
01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.790
Uh,

1409
01:27:59.330 --> 01:28:02.990
pat fans are all scumbags who shop at ll bean.

1410
01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:08.660
Be Honest,
Patriot fans.

1411
01:28:08.661 --> 01:28:13.661
If you really remove yourself from the situation and you go buy a patriots

1412
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:15.800
tailgate,
you know,

1413
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:20.720
you know those fucking boots that are like,
they're like leather on top,

1414
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:22.940
but they're made out of rubber on the bottom.

1415
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.040
They'll shoot those boots are actually the shit.
Yeah,

1416
01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:28.970
we are a bunch of rubes the same way.
If you go down to giants stadium,

1417
01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:33.920
it's like the fucking Jersey shore meets,

1418
01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:37.370
uh,
you know,
those already lang looking guys,
you know,

1419
01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:40.280
and I'm not trashing already leg because look at me.

1420
01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:44.620
I am a pasty face and beck from Boston.
Um,
that was,

1421
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:48.980
you know,
we really are the faces of our state.
When I think of New Jersey,

1422
01:28:48.981 --> 01:28:52.790
I definitely think of art,
art already Lang type of a guy and thought,

1423
01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:55.940
when you think a of Massachusetts,
don't you think about a book,

1424
01:28:55.941 --> 01:29:00.920
some Conan O'brien,
Bill burr looking fucking high hit thig to tattoo.

1425
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:02.303
Um,

1426
01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:05.580
so I'm not gonna lie with you and I'm not going to say that we aren't scumbags

1427
01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.570
up there.
Uh,
we are at doe.
That got is just uh,
uh,

1428
01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:12.330
just got it from Foxborough.
The experience was a good time,

1429
01:29:12.331 --> 01:29:14.840
expected some heckling going and uh,

1430
01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:19.110
made it out without getting hassled to hard overall was an awesome experience.

1431
01:29:19.111 --> 01:29:22.320
Watching all pat fans empty the stadium before the game was over.

1432
01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.000
My section was packed with jets.

1433
01:29:24.001 --> 01:29:28.560
Fans felt bad for the guy and his daughter who was surrounded on every side.

1434
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:30.000
I guess by jet fans.

1435
01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:35.300
I'm not sure if it's Foxboro or NFL fans in general that are just degenerate

1436
01:29:35.471 --> 01:29:40.290
scum bags.
Since I've only been to the metal lands prior to this for NFL Games,

1437
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.770
but here's a small list of Shit I saw throughout the day.

1438
01:29:44.730 --> 01:29:49.470
I saw a guy and his girlfriend get real racist with one jets fans sitting in

1439
01:29:49.471 --> 01:29:50.880
front of them.
Uh,
yeah,
that's,

1440
01:29:50.881 --> 01:29:55.881
that's Boston until he spit beer on the wrong group of people and it turned into

1441
01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:58.740
a pats fan versus pats fan fight.

1442
01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:03.611
You know,

1443
01:30:03.611 --> 01:30:08.200
funny that is because I've always resented Gillette stadium and the lighthouse

1444
01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:10.900
and the way they paved over the,

1445
01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:16.020
the scumbag experienced that going to a patriots game used to be over in Foxboro

1446
01:30:16.301 --> 01:30:19.630
stadium.
I hated how when we became a championship team,

1447
01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:24.130
all those corporate seats and all those fucking white collar douchebags who

1448
01:30:24.131 --> 01:30:25.180
started showing up,

1449
01:30:25.210 --> 01:30:30.210
it was a fucking keg party from 19 fucking 70 right through

1450
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:37.630
most of bill Parcells time.
Not until we started winning championships and a,

1451
01:30:37.631 --> 01:30:41.830
the shit started turning it around that all of a sudden there was this expecting

1452
01:30:41.831 --> 01:30:46.360
to win vibe and everybody started acting classy.
The bottom line is no fans,

1453
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:50.140
no fans are classy.
Uh,
unless you're winning,

1454
01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:53.260
then when you're winning,
it's easy to be like,
you know,

1455
01:30:53.410 --> 01:30:56.980
they're just a bunch of classes.
People,
you know,
what kind of behavior is that?

1456
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.640
Um,
it's like,
dude,
why don't you look into your fucking closet and,
and,

1457
01:30:59.641 --> 01:31:03.910
and remember how you act.
It's like Yankee fans.
Remember that Shit.

1458
01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:08.380
It was always red feather.
Red Sox fans are scumbags.
We have no class and blah,

1459
01:31:08.381 --> 01:31:10.720
blah,
blah,
blah.
And this is all why the Yankees were winning.

1460
01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:15.760
And then I remember when a rod slap the ball out of,
uh,

1461
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:17.920
was it Bronson or royals glove?

1462
01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:21.670
And the call went against him for the first time in history.

1463
01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:25.240
The Yankees got caught cheating.
You know,

1464
01:31:25.241 --> 01:31:28.270
if they're all the years of polling home runs into the fucking stands and

1465
01:31:28.271 --> 01:31:30.850
leaning into balls during,
uh,
when you picked off,

1466
01:31:31.690 --> 01:31:34.660
they've call finally went against him and the Yankee fans,

1467
01:31:34.810 --> 01:31:37.750
these classy fucking metropolitan.

1468
01:31:39.010 --> 01:31:44.010
We live in the Paris of United States littered the fucking field with fucking

1469
01:31:45.101 --> 01:31:49.780
trash.
All right,
so there you go,
sir.
So yes,
let me,
let me just finish.

1470
01:31:49.810 --> 01:31:51.970
He says,
uh,
but blah,
blah,
blah.

1471
01:31:52.810 --> 01:31:57.790
I saw dude cut off an entire line of track it and throw beers at someone's car.

1472
01:31:58.690 --> 01:32:03.370
This is after the game or maybe it was before the game.
Who knows?

1473
01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:08.530
And when confronted threatened the dude and said he was going to get his Gat and

1474
01:32:08.531 --> 01:32:11.170
I also saw a bunch of Douche bags on the way,

1475
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:16.900
on the way out on that shitty two lane highway guilty as charged route one baby

1476
01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:22.170
spiking beers at people's cars in dead stopped traffic looking to the Ford

1477
01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:28.720
looking forward to the podcast and gloating all week.
Yeah,
yeah,
definitely.
Um,

1478
01:32:29.530 --> 01:32:34.510
yeah,
no,
if you go,
if you go around the league,
if you go around the league,
yeah.

1479
01:32:34.570 --> 01:32:38.740
A sports fans are,
if they're losing their,
yeah,
they are scumbags.

1480
01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:44.170
Nobody.
Nobody's a good loser,
you know.
But there are definitely worse ones.

1481
01:32:44.171 --> 01:32:48.820
And someone actually asked me because,
uh,
it was one patriots fan.

1482
01:32:48.821 --> 01:32:53.440
I liked this guy.
He was pissed at all the pats fans that left.
Um,

1483
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:57.910
and I know a lot of jets fans and go,
yeah,
the fucking lame ass fucking fans.

1484
01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:02.470
It's,
I'll fuck you.
You Green faggots,
you do it too.
Everybody does it.

1485
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:06.460
Everybody does it.
And the only those people who stay,

1486
01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.560
those are die hard fans.

1487
01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:13.390
And if you noticed it's like 26 fucking people.
Okay.

1488
01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:18.070
You know those years when your team is like one in 15 and two and 14 and there's

1489
01:33:18.071 --> 01:33:23.071
26 people at the game and you know when your team is supposed to win some big

1490
01:33:23.801 --> 01:33:25.190
playoff game and then they,

1491
01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:30.190
they fucking lose and you're so embarrassed and,
but there's in this,

1492
01:33:30.191 --> 01:33:33.580
just that same 26 people,
that's the diehard fan.

1493
01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:38.620
And the only reason why they make the stadiums that fucking big is for the good

1494
01:33:38.621 --> 01:33:43.360
times when all the fairweather fags show up.
That's why.
That's why.

1495
01:33:43.361 --> 01:33:47.440
And you,
you saw how many die hard fucking Patriot fans they are.

1496
01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:50.230
There's the same level as diehard jet fans.

1497
01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.950
I'm telling you with that little fireman walkout,
he wouldn't,

1498
01:33:54.670 --> 01:33:59.080
would most jet fans walk out then that 45 be honest.

1499
01:33:59.110 --> 01:34:03.160
You Green greencards 45 to three d drubbing if that took place down in the

1500
01:34:03.161 --> 01:34:07.450
meadow lands,
Huh?
I know Hoe do I would've stayed.
Oh,

1501
01:34:07.451 --> 01:34:12.100
I would have been there with the hero.
Go and don't worry,
I'm still here for you.

1502
01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:15.100
You're full of shit.
You're full of shit.

1503
01:34:15.101 --> 01:34:18.250
You would have been out there on the fucking awful Jersey turnpike.

1504
01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:20.620
Y'All would've left.

1505
01:34:20.770 --> 01:34:24.280
I got so many emails of people telling me they shut off the game and discussed

1506
01:34:25.090 --> 01:34:27.400
all that type of shit.
All right,
so shut the fuck up.

1507
01:34:27.730 --> 01:34:31.570
Most people are fair weather.
Fuck it.
Fence.
So,
uh,

1508
01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:36.550
you know,
pat fans don't suck pat fans or just a,

1509
01:34:36.551 --> 01:34:41.500
they're an example of what a most fans are.
So I don't think you have any,

1510
01:34:41.501 --> 01:34:45.670
right.
Getting mad at an athlete.
If he doesn't sign your autograph,

1511
01:34:45.730 --> 01:34:50.590
sign you a fucking autograph.
You know,
because most of you,

1512
01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:55.680
if they're down 45 to three or 28 fucking 21 down by seven onside kick,

1513
01:34:58.321 --> 01:35:01.320
where the fuck were you?
You're already on route one,

1514
01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.520
so you have no right getting mad at him.
But uh,
that's what sports fans do.

1515
01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:09.090
They all suck.
Look at all those giant fans getting met.

1516
01:35:09.091 --> 01:35:11.140
They have the nerve to get mad at Tom Kauflin and,

1517
01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.960
and ask if he should be removed.

1518
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:16.530
The guys like two and a half years removed,

1519
01:35:17.610 --> 01:35:22.610
three years removed from beating an undefeated 17 point favorite in the

1520
01:35:22.831 --> 01:35:27.210
Superbowl and now everybody's acting like the game passed them by.
Um,

1521
01:35:28.290 --> 01:35:31.830
I dunno.
So I know this has been pretty much all sports this week.
It had to be,

1522
01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.450
it had to be,
uh,
but Patriot fans.
Okay.

1523
01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:42.150
A lot of you a zoned out from watching ESPN and all the hype about this patriots

1524
01:35:42.151 --> 01:35:42.600
team.

1525
01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:46.500
You got understand what Bella check did this year is he's rebuilding a fucking

1526
01:35:46.501 --> 01:35:51.450
monster.
And the fact that we were able to get as far as we did with the team,

1527
01:35:51.451 --> 01:35:55.920
that we had that awful fucking defense to somehow go 14 and fucking too,

1528
01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.230
when you let up 24 fucking points,

1529
01:35:58.231 --> 01:36:01.620
I can't wait to run it to this fucking dickhead down at the comedy store.

1530
01:36:01.770 --> 01:36:06.010
Another patriots fan who
was,
you know what?

1531
01:36:06.011 --> 01:36:10.910
I hate wins when you have a sports debate and somebody has a point.
Okay.

1532
01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.950
And not only did they not wait for you to finish,

1533
01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:17.310
they say that point and then they just keep repeating it.
He goes,

1534
01:36:17.311 --> 01:36:18.480
patriots are going to win it,
man.

1535
01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:20.280
They're going to win the fucking super bowl bell.

1536
01:36:20.281 --> 01:36:23.040
Bill Bellacheck has got these guys and I go,
wait a minute,
dude,
wait a minute.

1537
01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:27.120
They're letting up.
Like the defense is like last in everything in the league.

1538
01:36:27.121 --> 01:36:30.510
Three quarters of season.
He goes,
stats don't mean not the stats on me.
Nothing.

1539
01:36:30.810 --> 01:36:33.600
And I'm like,
dude,
they're letting up 24 to 26.
Jack told me nothing.

1540
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:37.410
Stan told me not to.
Now do stats don't mean everything.

1541
01:36:38.150 --> 01:36:41.790
I la,
Peyton Manning,
they don't mean everything.
But you know,

1542
01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:45.150
you can't ignore that.
I can't wait to fucking run into that guy.

1543
01:36:46.170 --> 01:36:48.500
I'm just going to walk up to him,
be Steph told me not eating.

1544
01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:51.960
She I told me in anything and of course he won't remember.

1545
01:36:52.230 --> 01:36:55.320
And then I'll just look like a psycho.
Is he drinking again?

1546
01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:58.680
Speaking of which people I am 93 fucking days,

1547
01:36:59.670 --> 01:37:03.450
93 fucking days into,
uh,

1548
01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:08.250
into this hundred day John,
I got seven.
Oh,
actually,
I'm sorry,

1549
01:37:08.251 --> 01:37:12.210
I'm 94 days to go.
So next week,
the Monday morning podcast,

1550
01:37:12.211 --> 01:37:16.830
I will be a hundred days in and a,
I'm actually going to the Bruins,

1551
01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:21.810
a la kings.
So just in case you think I'm going to retire as a sports fan,

1552
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:27.360
uh,
I'm not,
I have an odd sense of fucking relief.

1553
01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:33.050
I don't know,
maybe this podcast was like Cathartic.
I,
I have no idea what,
and um,

1554
01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:38.130
I dunno.
I Dunno.
Am I going to be able to watch it next week?

1555
01:37:41.130 --> 01:37:44.370
I think Jeff,
I think rex Ryan might be that,
you know,
when they say,

1556
01:37:44.371 --> 01:37:46.830
I tell you you hate it,
but if he played for you,
you'd fucking love them.

1557
01:37:46.831 --> 01:37:50.960
You know when they say about off Samuelson and I say,
no,
no,
I wouldn't.
Uh,

1558
01:37:52.110 --> 01:37:53.070
there's something about rex,

1559
01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:56.640
he reminds me of all the meat head friends had when we used to go out drink it

1560
01:37:57.450 --> 01:37:58.830
when I was younger,
you know.

1561
01:37:59.830 --> 01:38:00.500
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1562
01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:04.400
<v 8>But he's very hard to like,
he's very fucking hard to like,</v>

1563
01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:07.000
you know,
he's fat I,
and I was really,

1564
01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:12.240
you don't want it was about that guy.
Did you guys,
I don't know if it was made,

1565
01:38:12.241 --> 01:38:16.890
did you guys notice that he was losing weight rapidly the entire year because of

1566
01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:18.120
that lap band surgery?

1567
01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:22.010
And then right after that patriots lost,

1568
01:38:22.011 --> 01:38:25.500
he kind of leveled off for half a second and maybe put on a few pounds.

1569
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.851
Did you notice that?

1570
01:38:26.851 --> 01:38:30.810
Do you realize like the level of m and m's that guy was eating,
you know,

1571
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:32.740
after his,
I don't give up play him again.

1572
01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:37.900
He was trying to fucking calm down his mind.
Um,

1573
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:41.230
that was one thing I was looking at.
I was like,
oh my,

1574
01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:46.260
I hope this guy is losing his fucking mind and I just really don't want to lose

1575
01:38:47.251 --> 01:38:51.690
to these guys.
And we did.
Oh,
it fucking hurt.

1576
01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.560
It was like the end of Braveheart,
except I did cry out

1577
01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:03.180
and I didn't yell freedom,
but it definitely began with an f word.
All right,

1578
01:39:03.181 --> 01:39:04.540
there we go.
That's the end of that bullshit.

1579
01:39:04.590 --> 01:39:06.810
So let's get on with the a of the rest of the podcast people.

1580
01:39:06.811 --> 01:39:09.870
I am going to be in Arlington,
Texas.
Oh,
how funny is this?

1581
01:39:09.871 --> 01:39:12.180
I actually have an opportunity to go to the Superbowl this year,

1582
01:39:12.181 --> 01:39:15.930
which just trait change drastically because this jets one,

1583
01:39:16.110 --> 01:39:17.490
not that I don't have a ticket,

1584
01:39:17.491 --> 01:39:22.280
but there's no fucking way I'm going to go there if the jets are in it.
Uh,

1585
01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:25.800
I actually,
I might go cause I think I'm gradually getting past this shit,

1586
01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:31.360
you know,
come on.
Superbowl and fucking Dallas.
That'd be awesome.
Um,

1587
01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.590
yeah,
and that's also,
you know,
if I'm back on the sauce,

1588
01:39:34.591 --> 01:39:38.280
that could be a really good fucking time.
You know,
by the way,

1589
01:39:38.281 --> 01:39:42.300
is that jet fan who's a fireman,
is he actually a fireman and if he is,

1590
01:39:42.301 --> 01:39:47.190
what exactly does he fight fires because he's on all the home and away games.

1591
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:52.320
How much money is he making as a firefighter that he can afford to do that?

1592
01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:56.850
Is it one of those gay things where he's [inaudible] the,
the,
the fucking team,

1593
01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:58.970
the ownership or he's,

1594
01:39:58.971 --> 01:40:02.850
he's one of our super fans and that he gets like free season tickets.

1595
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:08.100
Um,
is he part of the nine 11 clause?
Is that what it is?

1596
01:40:08.101 --> 01:40:11.490
Because he has a fireman hat on that,
you know,
they're like,
okay,

1597
01:40:11.491 --> 01:40:14.160
well we can't make this guy buy tickets.
He's a firefighter.

1598
01:40:14.161 --> 01:40:16.470
We all feel fucking horrific after nine 11,

1599
01:40:16.471 --> 01:40:20.460
let's fucking Hook this guy up at guys like one of the luckiest sports fans
ever.

1600
01:40:20.730 --> 01:40:23.820
Although I do notice they always stick them down in the corner of the end zone.

1601
01:40:23.850 --> 01:40:28.200
They don't quite hook them up on the 50 yard line.
Do they?
Um,

1602
01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:33.230
is he a fireman?
I have no idea,
but I'm making fun of that guy all weekend.

1603
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:37.050
I do know that he's very close with his boyfriend who puts them on his shoulder.

1604
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:40.850
I still maintain that jet fans.

1605
01:40:40.851 --> 01:40:44.400
I will not back down on that if that was my fucking son.
Don't you ever,

1606
01:40:44.590 --> 01:40:47.690
ever put it another man on your fucking shoulders with fireman's hat?

1607
01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:49.820
You understand me?
If you got to fucking mustache,

1608
01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:52.760
I would never talk to you again.
Do you understand me?
Huh?
Hey,

1609
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:57.160
fucking talking to you.
As long as you carry my fucking last name.

1610
01:40:57.850 --> 01:41:02.200
All right.
They go to your room and think about it.
Um,
all right,

1611
01:41:02.201 --> 01:41:03.450
let's try and get something Outta here.

1612
01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:08.620
Let's try to get something fucking going on about this.
Uh,
right.
Where are we?

1613
01:41:08.621 --> 01:41:12.430
Where are we?
Oh,
here's a revenge story and this one's disgusting.
All right.

1614
01:41:12.431 --> 01:41:15.340
If there's any women actually still listening to this podcast after I did

1615
01:41:15.341 --> 01:41:19.870
fucking an hour about a God damn football game.
All right.
Revenge story.
Uh,

1616
01:41:19.871 --> 01:41:22.420
and I wrote gross in parentheses.
Okay.
Um,

1617
01:41:22.450 --> 01:41:25.120
I don't know if you still do those revenge stories anymore,

1618
01:41:25.150 --> 01:41:28.420
but I thought I'd pass mine along anyway.
All right.

1619
01:41:28.421 --> 01:41:31.810
I had this roommate in college who would chew loudly off.
That's,

1620
01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:33.910
that was one of my big pet peeves in life.

1621
01:41:34.030 --> 01:41:36.610
If you're a fucking adult and you eat with your mouth open,

1622
01:41:36.611 --> 01:41:39.040
I really think I should be able to leak legally.

1623
01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:43.820
Fucking stab you in the juggler with the utensil you're eating with Bita.

1624
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:47.560
Chap.
Stick a fork.
A fucking spoon.
Ali.
I got a fucking spoon in there.

1625
01:41:47.650 --> 01:41:52.600
I will butter knife slowly.
Fucking saw my way into that.

1626
01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:56.050
Um,
he would chew too loudly.

1627
01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:59.500
Scream into the phone when I was trying to watch TV.

1628
01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:05.040
Leave the toilet seat up when there were ladies over and generally gross out.

1629
01:42:06.491 --> 01:42:11.491
My girlfriend with his caveman like habits between that and his constant

1630
01:42:11.861 --> 01:42:16.600
messages,
uh,
I was having to clean up.
I got fed up after awhile.

1631
01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:19.390
I'm talking,
did nothing.

1632
01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:22.510
So I had to get creative since we shared a bathroom,

1633
01:42:22.511 --> 01:42:27.060
we also shared the toilet paper.
All right people,

1634
01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:31.950
I'm giving you an opportunity to hit stop right now.
All right,
you can hit stop.

1635
01:42:31.951 --> 01:42:33.480
You can hit pause.
You can fast forward.

1636
01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:36.330
It's probably gonna take me another minute.
Okay.
Have you done it?

1637
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:38.670
Cause I'm going to start reading in three,
two.

1638
01:42:40.050 --> 01:42:43.230
I took the role into my room,
unraveled it,

1639
01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:49.220
and with my girlfriends assistant drips some leftover Tj's on it.

1640
01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:57.050
Let me read that sentence again.
I took a role into my room,
unraveled it,

1641
01:42:57.410 --> 01:43:01.290
and with my girlfriends,
assistant assistants,
drip,

1642
01:43:01.291 --> 01:43:03.050
some leftover Tj's on it.

1643
01:43:04.650 --> 01:43:09.650
I made sure to space it out every few sheets so that it was throughout the role

1644
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:17.720
in,
in a small enough quantity that wasn't obvious.
Just exactly.

1645
01:43:17.721 --> 01:43:18.830
How did you do that?

1646
01:43:20.710 --> 01:43:24.540
Will you fucking choke in your cock on choking?

1647
01:43:24.541 --> 01:43:27.540
Choking and chalky joking,
is that what you were doing?

1648
01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.960
Did you have a fucking Turkey based or this is disgusting,

1649
01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:33.830
this is fucking disgusting.

1650
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:38.990
So He'd left a small enough quantity so it wasn't obvious the satisfaction of

1651
01:43:38.991 --> 01:43:43.991
knowing that when he white he would be rubbing my semen into his ass,

1652
01:43:48.490 --> 01:43:53.270
made the annoying habits far less annoying after,
after that,

1653
01:43:53.271 --> 01:43:57.980
whenever he would chew loudly or be annoying my girl and I would think of what

1654
01:43:58.090 --> 01:44:00.590
we'd done and just start laughing,

1655
01:44:00.591 --> 01:44:05.240
know that knowing that I had planted my seed inside of him,
so to speak,

1656
01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:07.790
highly recommended this to,

1657
01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:11.370
I highly recommend this to anyone who has an annoying rent.
A roommate.

1658
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:16.970
Ed has never been tested,
uh,
as an as tested negative for HIV.

1659
01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:19.340
Dude,
that is fucking disgusting.
First of all,

1660
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:22.130
how do you know when he went in there and wiped his ass?

1661
01:44:22.610 --> 01:44:27.320
Why are you thinking he sticking his finger up his ass?
And uh,

1662
01:44:27.321 --> 01:44:29.780
what did you do when you went in and had to take a dump?

1663
01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:33.340
You obviously brought in some different toilet paper.

1664
01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:39.160
Did you have like your ear up to a glass waiting to hear the sound of fucking

1665
01:44:39.161 --> 01:44:40.600
shit hitting the toilet water.

1666
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:45.970
And how did your girlfriend bring you to climax with that toilet paper right

1667
01:44:45.971 --> 01:44:49.060
there?
She just rubbed you out like it was a job.

1668
01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:52.680
Eh,
that's just fucking disgusting,
man.

1669
01:44:52.681 --> 01:44:56.130
That's really one of the creepy ones I've ever gotten a youtube videos this
week.

1670
01:44:56.131 --> 01:45:01.130
I only have one of them.
Um,
because I,

1671
01:45:01.131 --> 01:45:03.750
I seriously,
uh,
like I said,

1672
01:45:03.751 --> 01:45:08.070
I was flying back from Atlantic city and I didn't have time to go through all

1673
01:45:08.071 --> 01:45:12.090
the youtube,
so I apologize.
I only have one,
uh,
the left rights.
I'm on crack.

1674
01:45:12.091 --> 01:45:16.170
It's actually a really cool music video.
A silly song.
Uh,

1675
01:45:16.171 --> 01:45:18.720
maybe you can attach you just sort of one happy one.
Let me,
let me do the,

1676
01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:23.700
I've got a couple of advice and then I'm going to tap out here.
Uh,
all right,

1677
01:45:23.701 --> 01:45:28.560
advice.
I know this girl,
I've known her for a bit.
Uh,
we're friends,

1678
01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:31.140
we've been for a while.
Okay.
Now this one,

1679
01:45:31.141 --> 01:45:33.930
you know how everybody always trashes me for the way I fucking read.

1680
01:45:33.931 --> 01:45:35.880
I know I suck at reading,
but I have to let you know.

1681
01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:40.080
This is all in lowercase and there's absolutely no punctuation whatsoever.

1682
01:45:40.081 --> 01:45:43.110
I don't know if this guy text message this or what,

1683
01:45:43.111 --> 01:45:47.550
but this is not my fucking fault.
Let me try my best to read this.
All right,
Bill.

1684
01:45:47.551 --> 01:45:50.880
I know this girl.
I've known her for a bit and we're friends.
No period.

1685
01:45:51.150 --> 01:45:54.950
We've been for a while,
comma.
Anyway,

1686
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:59.940
about a month ago I asked her out on a date and she said yes,
comma,

1687
01:46:00.690 --> 01:46:04.180
continuing the sentence.
He doesn't have periods.
He just has calm is lowercase.

1688
01:46:04.230 --> 01:46:08.610
I took her out and we had fun.
No period.
We talk.
Shit

1689
01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:15.090
was Hunky Dory.
No Comma,
we kissed it.
No period.
It was awesome.

1690
01:46:15.690 --> 01:46:20.160
First date,
it was an awesome first date.
Hey,
there's a period,

1691
01:46:20.190 --> 01:46:22.080
no capital letter.
Then I,

1692
01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:26.820
I barely fucking heard from her.
No period.

1693
01:46:26.821 --> 01:46:30.600
I was running around like a fucking jackass.
No period.

1694
01:46:31.110 --> 01:46:34.710
Just trying to talk to her and I'm sorry the,
I guess it keeps going.

1695
01:46:34.711 --> 01:46:37.850
Just trying to talk to her and when we would talk it was fine.
Oh,

1696
01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:42.510
there's a period I was beating myself up going crazy.

1697
01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:46.680
No,
period.
I was some piece of shit.

1698
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:51.390
Anyway,
I pulled myself together and I asked her out again.

1699
01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:54.750
She wants against said yes.
Awesome.
Right.

1700
01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:58.350
Well not your fucking lack of punctuation.
That's not awesome.

1701
01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:03.960
So we go out again when cool.
Again,
I didn't kiss her this time.
I don't know.

1702
01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:07.530
It was just off.
But anyway,
comma,

1703
01:47:08.370 --> 01:47:12.210
that was no punctuation and all of that.
You fucking Dick once again.

1704
01:47:12.211 --> 01:47:13.130
I was fucking,

1705
01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:14.510
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1706
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:18.500
<v 8>once again,
I fucking didn't hear a thing,
so I said,
fuck it.</v>

1707
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:21.800
I don't need this right now.
And we just went back to being friends.

1708
01:47:21.801 --> 01:47:24.830
Never talked about it.
Just let it lay.

1709
01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:26.970
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

1710
01:47:26.970 --> 01:47:31.170
<v 8>fucking see double at this point.
Anyway,
lately I've been talking to her a lot.</v>

1711
01:47:31.171 --> 01:47:34.290
Like I said,
like I said,
we're friends,

1712
01:47:34.291 --> 01:47:37.350
but she's very clearly been flirting with me and I honestly,

1713
01:47:37.351 --> 01:47:41.910
I've been flirting back.
I still liked the girl.
No period,
no nothing.

1714
01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:47.190
But I just don't know if it's worth it.
You know,

1715
01:47:47.310 --> 01:47:50.610
period.
No question mark.
She's got a lot of drama.

1716
01:47:50.611 --> 01:47:53.910
She's one of these girls that gets drunk at a party and cries,

1717
01:47:53.911 --> 01:47:55.710
then ask people if she's pretty,

1718
01:47:56.910 --> 01:48:01.590
which she really fucking is like really hot dot,
dot,
dot,
dot,
dot.

1719
01:48:01.650 --> 01:48:03.420
Ah,
but I do like her,

1720
01:48:03.421 --> 01:48:06.300
I just don't know if I should put myself through this shit again.

1721
01:48:06.301 --> 01:48:08.370
What do you think bill?
I legitimately,

1722
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:12.120
legitimately we'd like your advice slash opinion.
Um,

1723
01:48:13.770 --> 01:48:16.230
okay.
The first thing I would do,
I would get some sort of spell check.

1724
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:19.200
I would get some sort of,
uh,
um,

1725
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:24.230
phonics or some sort of shit to teach you how to write.
All right?

1726
01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:27.960
People I know I suck at reading out loud,
but can,
can you do me a fucking solid?

1727
01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:32.520
I'm not reading any more fucking emails that,
that are like this.
All right.

1728
01:48:32.521 --> 01:48:35.520
Cause I,
this is literally is I'm,
I'm starting to lose my fucking eyesight.

1729
01:48:36.930 --> 01:48:41.730
Um,
so what do I think?
Yeah.
Okay.
This is what I think.

1730
01:48:41.731 --> 01:48:44.490
I think you should definitely not get dual relationship with this girl,

1731
01:48:44.491 --> 01:48:47.370
this girl that this girl is a fucking nightmare.
All right?

1732
01:48:47.371 --> 01:48:49.860
There's all kinds of red flags.
I don't know what happened to her.

1733
01:48:49.861 --> 01:48:53.130
And I can tell you right now,
you don't want to find out what's happening to her,

1734
01:48:53.190 --> 01:48:53.881
what happened to her.

1735
01:48:53.881 --> 01:48:58.800
You don't want to find out in that you don't want to have feelings for this
girl.

1736
01:48:59.470 --> 01:48:59.821
All right?

1737
01:48:59.821 --> 01:49:04.821
And when the other fucking bag of shit hits the floor and your heart is

1738
01:49:05.641 --> 01:49:07.140
underneath that,
you don't.
You don't.

1739
01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:09.480
You don't let a girl like this break your heart,
all right?

1740
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:12.930
You can see it from a mile away.
She is a fucking mess.

1741
01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:16.980
All right?
There's plenty of great girls out there.
You're a young guy.

1742
01:49:16.981 --> 01:49:21.840
Go find one.
All right?
Find a girl,
you know,
make a list of shit.

1743
01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:25.050
All right?
One of the big things,

1744
01:49:25.051 --> 01:49:29.730
if you want to find a really good girl is find one who has a great relationship

1745
01:49:29.731 --> 01:49:33.480
with her parents.
Hopefully they're still together,
all right?

1746
01:49:33.481 --> 01:49:36.820
That's another good thing.
Start with that.
But if they sit there,
you ain't got,

1747
01:49:37.730 --> 01:49:39.600
they got low self esteem issues.

1748
01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:44.190
You're going to kill a decade a your fucking life trying to build them up and
it,

1749
01:49:44.191 --> 01:49:47.830
you know what it's going to be.
It's going to be fucking exhausting.
All right.

1750
01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:52.030
And then because she doesn't think she's pretty,
she might act out sexually,

1751
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:54.640
um,
for some sort of,
you know.

1752
01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:55.930
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1753
01:49:55.930 --> 01:50:00.870
<v 8>I don't know,
like Geez,
I just really,
I'm an hour and six minutes in here.
Just,</v>

1754
01:50:00.871 --> 01:50:03.840
you know,
some sort of affirmation that she is pretty okay.

1755
01:50:03.841 --> 01:50:07.680
So what do I think you should do?
All right,
well if you're a well adjusted guy,

1756
01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:11.500
you'll just walk away from the situation and say that I'm not going to just bang

1757
01:50:11.501 --> 01:50:14.050
her and use that as a fucking Nacho.

1758
01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.490
My bedpost to make my ego feel good and I'm not going to hurt this person.

1759
01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.400
But if you're,
how most people are your age,

1760
01:50:20.401 --> 01:50:23.340
I would just say bang her and then uh,

1761
01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:29.080
I dunno,
it's going to be ugly.
If you want to bang this girl,
I got to tell you,

1762
01:50:29.081 --> 01:50:31.540
don't let your heart get involved at a,

1763
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:37.070
I dunno,
not,
not having seen her,

1764
01:50:37.071 --> 01:50:39.890
not seeing how hot she is and being older and more mature,

1765
01:50:39.891 --> 01:50:44.160
I would say just walk away and go find some,
well adjusted hottie that's,

1766
01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:47.900
unless you just want a bank.
So buddy,
but then you,
you can do that.

1767
01:50:47.930 --> 01:50:49.250
You know what it is about this thing.
You know what?

1768
01:50:49.251 --> 01:50:53.120
I don't like this too much fucking history.
You got to be able to leave.

1769
01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:54.380
You gotta be able to fucking,

1770
01:50:55.070 --> 01:50:55.270
<v 4>okay.</v>

1771
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:59.830
<v 8>Go out the side door.
If you just going to bank somebody,
you can't have this.</v>

1772
01:50:59.831 --> 01:51:02.920
Well,
we were friends at first and then it became romantic.

1773
01:51:02.921 --> 01:51:05.950
Then we went back to being friends and then we fucked.
Eh.

1774
01:51:05.951 --> 01:51:09.970
It's just a fucking nightmare.
Yeah,
I'd find someone else to fuck.

1775
01:51:09.971 --> 01:51:12.070
But if you don't give a shit,
yeah,
I banger.

1776
01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:16.750
But by no means don't develop any sort of feelings for her.
All right,

1777
01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:19.990
there you go.
There's my advice.
I'm going to do one more and then that's it.

1778
01:51:21.190 --> 01:51:25.440
All right.
This one has punctuation.
So if I fuck up,
this one is on me.
Uh,

1779
01:51:25.450 --> 01:51:26.510
hey bill,
first of all,

1780
01:51:26.511 --> 01:51:29.200
if I want to thank you for your breakup advice I listened to.

1781
01:51:29.201 --> 01:51:30.580
I think this is just a thank you here.

1782
01:51:30.730 --> 01:51:33.880
I listen to the podcast a few weeks ago and heard this guy's story about getting

1783
01:51:33.881 --> 01:51:36.220
dumped on Christmas Eve.
Oddly enough,

1784
01:51:36.221 --> 01:51:40.150
I was also at the end of a relationship with a girl who had,
who had had a kid.

1785
01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:43.750
She waited until a week after new year's when I was out of town,

1786
01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:48.130
a center flowers because I could tell something was off.

1787
01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:53.650
Something was up.
I mean,
and I had been gone a lot recently.

1788
01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:57.160
She called when I got off work and confirmed my suspicion.

1789
01:51:57.730 --> 01:52:01.480
I don't need to get into all that shit.
It happened.
And uh,

1790
01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:05.830
the point is I just listened to your podcast after it all happened and decided

1791
01:52:06.370 --> 01:52:10.850
that's how it had to be.
No point in scoring anything else up in my life.
No,

1792
01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:12.550
no point in worrying about anything.

1793
01:52:12.551 --> 01:52:16.330
Get back to the gym and focus on finishing school and my career.
That's right.

1794
01:52:16.331 --> 01:52:19.840
There you go.
There you go.
That's a great fucking move.

1795
01:52:19.841 --> 01:52:24.370
That's a self esteem move right there.
You're going to find somebody else.

1796
01:52:24.370 --> 01:52:27.700
You're going to get somebody better.
Go get in great shape and uh,

1797
01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:31.480
get your career going.
Phenomenal.
Fucking move.
Uh,

1798
01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:35.080
thanks for the words of encouragement.
I think they did some good big fan man.

1799
01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:39.910
I bought a DVD and I'll continue support the podcast.
Well,
thank you very much.

1800
01:52:39.911 --> 01:52:44.850
I appreciate that.
And thank you to everyone who's been listening to my podcast.

1801
01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:49.070
And once again,
congratulations to the jets,
their organization and the fans,

1802
01:52:49.071 --> 01:52:51.680
you deserved it.
You went into our stadium,

1803
01:52:51.710 --> 01:52:54.560
you kicked our ass to the point that all you saw,

1804
01:52:54.561 --> 01:52:58.660
how many true Patriot fans they're fucking are.
Uh,

1805
01:52:59.090 --> 01:53:02.180
but there are just as many true jet fans.
Be honest with yourself.

1806
01:53:02.210 --> 01:53:06.440
Be honest with yourselves when they sucked.
Do you watch them?

1807
01:53:06.890 --> 01:53:10.910
Do you think?
I watched a Celtic game from like 2002 to 2006.

1808
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:14.780
I didn't.
All right.
I jumped right back on that bandwagon.

1809
01:53:14.810 --> 01:53:18.560
I am a diehard Bruin Fan,
die hard patriot fan.

1810
01:53:18.590 --> 01:53:22.100
I was a die hard red sox fan,
but uh,
you know,

1811
01:53:22.101 --> 01:53:26.930
what happened was they won the world series and I felt like a degenerate gambler

1812
01:53:26.931 --> 01:53:31.580
who finally made a big score and I just walked away from the table and I was

1813
01:53:31.581 --> 01:53:34.640
like,
that's it.
I'm up.
I'm buying my little fucking houseboat.

1814
01:53:35.210 --> 01:53:38.330
I'm going to throw down the anchor and drink Pina coladas the rest of my life.

1815
01:53:38.331 --> 01:53:40.010
See you later.
Thanks for the memories.

1816
01:53:40.011 --> 01:53:44.610
And I haven't been able to get back into them.
Um,

1817
01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:50.300
since I gotta be honest with you.
And uh,
who else has left and the Celtics,

1818
01:53:50.301 --> 01:53:52.460
ah,
the Celtics.
I got back into the Celtics.
You know,

1819
01:53:52.461 --> 01:53:53.720
I'm not a big basketball fan.

1820
01:53:53.721 --> 01:53:57.080
I'm not a big professional basketball fan for the simple fact that the final

1821
01:53:57.081 --> 01:53:59.960
three minutes takes two hours and 17 minutes.

1822
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:03.440
I don't like how they travel and that's all.
I,
they travel all the time.

1823
01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:06.050
All the fucking time.
When I watch an NBA game,

1824
01:54:06.051 --> 01:54:08.420
that's all I do is I just sit there watching both teams,

1825
01:54:08.421 --> 01:54:13.250
even my team and I just go travel.
How did they not set up?

1826
01:54:13.670 --> 01:54:17.750
How do they not sit the fuck the guy fucking took that was three and a half

1827
01:54:17.751 --> 01:54:20.240
steps travel.

1828
01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:26.890
Um,
that that's,
you know,
I'm just not into it,
but uh,

1829
01:54:26.891 --> 01:54:30.500
I do like it when the Celtics and the Lakers are good.
That's when it's great.

1830
01:54:30.501 --> 01:54:33.590
That's the rivalry I like fucking watch in the same way.

1831
01:54:33.591 --> 01:54:38.591
It's sucks if the Canadians are awesome in the Bruins are bad or the other way

1832
01:54:38.631 --> 01:54:41.600
around.
I don't want the Canadians to suck.
I want it to be awesome.

1833
01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:46.400
The Bruins to be awesome.
I like to fucking colliding and a,
and that's it.

1834
01:54:46.401 --> 01:54:48.560
And Patriots fans keeping fucking heads up,

1835
01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:52.970
especially the 26 a year who actually stuck around to the end of the fucking

1836
01:54:52.971 --> 01:54:55.880
game.
All right,
keep your heads up.

1837
01:54:56.060 --> 01:55:00.380
Bill Belicheck is fucking the best God damn coach.
And um,

1838
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:04.670
you know what he did starting for rookies on defense.

1839
01:55:04.671 --> 01:55:06.800
What he did this year was fucking phenomenal.

1840
01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:12.020
We laid an egg in the worst possible time,
but uh,
you know,

1841
01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:15.500
don't be a Douche and puts you pat skier away for the fucking year.
All right?

1842
01:55:15.501 --> 01:55:19.190
Don't be like that.
Don't be like r B like that.
Who gives a fuck?

1843
01:55:19.191 --> 01:55:22.060
You think these athletes give a shit about you?
You know,

1844
01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:25.610
you think they're not going to walk by in and fucking airport with their fucking

1845
01:55:25.611 --> 01:55:27.680
$10,000 headphones on.
Actually,

1846
01:55:27.681 --> 01:55:30.530
they're not even gonna walk by you and the head at the fucking airport cause

1847
01:55:30.531 --> 01:55:35.290
they got their own goddamn plane.
Ah,
Jesus.
You know,

1848
01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:38.650
this podcast could really be endless because I never run out of shit to pitch

1849
01:55:38.651 --> 01:55:42.230
you bump.
That's a podcast for this week.
Uh,
that's it.

1850
01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:46.670
I talk to you next week.
God bless all he is.
Even the jet fans,

1851
01:55:46.671 --> 01:55:50.170
you fucking bring cons and everybody go fuck yourself.
I'll see ya.
