00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.520
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:05.640
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:10.050
August 10th,
2015.
How's it going?
How are you?

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.460
What are you doing?
Huh?
What are you doing?
It's Monday.

5
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.420
Do you get droid?
He listened to it on the way home on the way there.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.950
I put it up earlier this week,
or at least I tried to,
I have my brand new,
uh,

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.640
I switched internet carriers because it just wasn't getting any,

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.600
it's taken me forever to upload these podcasts and I'm all syked now.
So,

9
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:34.470
and I got this new fucking Internet,
right?
It's such a racket.
You know,

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.560
my old Internet soft in every room in the house.

11
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.390
My New Internet is unbelievable in the living room and you can't get any

12
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:46.440
connection anywhere else.
Nowhere else will the fucking light you on.

13
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.710
And it's frustrating.
But uh,
but whatever,

14
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.960
I uploaded my Thursday podcast,

15
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:56.961
it uploaded in like 17 seconds and it usually was taking me like a half hour to

16
00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:02.040
upload 30 fucking minutes.
Um,
just cause where I live,
there's does,
you know,

17
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.980
to low signal,

18
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.440
which evidently isn't a bad thing because I just ran into this fucking leg

19
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.040
and she was telling me all this shit about fucking electromagnetic shit passing

20
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:18.920
through your fucking head and was telling me,
ah yeah,

21
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:20.960
turn off your router every night,

22
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.520
give you your body a chance to get rid of all of this shit.

23
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.380
And uh,
I who,
who the fuck knows,
you know,

24
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.050
I guess when she was trying to claim,
but when you,

25
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.620
when you signed that fucking apple agreement,

26
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.420
there's something that you never read.

27
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:41.630
You just sign it that there's something in there that basically says,
yeah,

28
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.930
if this laptop gives you a ball cancer or fucking brain cancer with the phone,

29
00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:51.860
you can't sue us and all of that type of shit.

30
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.490
Which is totally believable cause all they gotta do is just push that through

31
00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:58.880
congress and none of those cons make any money and they need the money or the

32
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:03.170
rich people.
So they go,
hey,
you want to fucking still be in office?
Well though.

33
00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:04.004
Yeah,

34
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.990
you still want that side pace in your own private subway over the fucking thing.

35
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:12.560
They're right of the capitol,
the past,
his God damn pill.

36
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.650
And they go,
all right.
It's why we have fucking a income tax.

37
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:21.890
It's why we have all of this fucking shits.
Why I love Donald Trump.

38
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.330
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.860
<v 1>During that Republican debate,</v>

40
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.560
he actually have to shit you cons told me I should be walking around with tin

41
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:32.450
foil on my head.
He fucking said it during the debate.
He goes,

42
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:36.080
you give a politician money,
they'll do whatever you want.
And he goes,

43
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:38.480
I've given everybody money up here on this panel.

44
00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:40.790
And it was like 10 guys and only one guy goes,

45
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.820
that's fucking hilarious.
They'll do whatever you want.
So they go,
well,

46
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:49.640
what'd you give it to the Clintons for?
What did they want?
He goes,

47
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:53.390
I wanted Hillary to go to my wedding.
And you know what?
The bitch showed up.

48
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.630
She fucking showed up.
So there you go.

49
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.610
I don't know what the fuck that has to do with routers,
but I feel vindicated.

50
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.250
All you cops forever was sitting there telling me that I got my fucking,
uh,

51
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.400
my tin foil hat on because I didn't think it made a bit of difference whether

52
00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:13.820
you're voted in a fucking republican or a Democrat,
because you know,

53
00:03:13.821 --> 00:03:17.590
those fucking cops got enough money to put money on both horses so there's

54
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:19.850
shit's still getting pushed through.
Right.

55
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.920
That's why when they go on the fucking debates,

56
00:03:21.921 --> 00:03:23.870
they don't talk about the population problem.

57
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.210
They don't talk about genetically altered food.

58
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.350
They don't talk about fucking anything running out of water.

59
00:03:30.351 --> 00:03:33.410
They know all they talk about is fucking broads,

60
00:03:33.411 --> 00:03:38.411
getting jobs and education and fucking whatever the fuck we're doing over there,

61
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.520
it's supporting the tropes.
You know what I mean?
Hey,

62
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.950
am I out of my fucking mind here?
It didn't.

63
00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:49.370
We defeat Germany and Japan and like three and a half,
four years.

64
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.820
It's like four and a half years.
Well,

65
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.380
I'm with the Italians and whoever else was with the fucking Germans.
Right?

66
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.170
We got that fucker.
We got a world war.

67
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.220
We got a fucking world war done collectively.

68
00:04:04.221 --> 00:04:07.850
When the fuck did it start 39 40.
It was over by 45,
five years.

69
00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:10.820
We've got the shit over with.
What are we doing now?

70
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.550
We're all there with these fucking console they got as a jungle gym.

71
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.440
<v 1>15 years in his shift,
14 fucking years into it.
You want,</v>

73
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.980
it was what the World War II was.

74
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:24.100
We had no intentions of taking over the country and staying there.

75
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:26.170
That's what it is.
We have an occupation going on here.

76
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.510
So what are you going to do?
You're fucking there.
You know,

77
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:32.320
you're over there trying to build a Starbucks,
you know,
put up a staples.

78
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.840
You know,
you just got to be constantly engaged with the enemy over there.

79
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.863
<v 0>I Dunno man.</v>

80
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.040
<v 1>What a fuck do I get off talking about something that big?
You know,
why?</v>

81
00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:49.380
Cause there's my podcast.
What are you gonna do about it?

82
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.850
I'll tell you what you gonna do against.

83
00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:52.740
Sit right there and you got to fucking listen to it.

84
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.550
<v 0>Okay?</v>

85
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.290
<v 1>Oh,
not you.
Shut it off.
I don't give a shit.
Um,
anyway,</v>

86
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.750
so I finally have some good Internet.
Never deadly.
Uh,

87
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.610
cause I went from 0.3 megabytes per minute signal.

88
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:09.850
Now I have like 300 per minute.

89
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.220
Now I get up a load of podcasts in two seconds,

90
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:17.080
but I'll probably gonna fucking die in like a year and a half from the fucking

91
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:20.140
beam that's coming from the thing that floats over your house out there in
space.

92
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:21.490
Right?
The satellite.

93
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.010
How come fucking Steve Jobs died of cancer?
Pancreatic cancer.

94
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.170
You know what that was from,
right?
All those years,

95
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:32.590
they haven't that laptop sitting on his stomach because he was trying to beat

96
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:37.150
all Billy Gates.
Right?
And there he is having a signed a fucking agreement.

97
00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:39.280
This might give you cancer.
And he got,
he got fucking,

98
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.180
you got killed by his own monster.
It's like one of those Frankenstein movies,

99
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:46.730
right?
Fucking laptop picked him right up and throw them right in the lake.

100
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.150
It'll Steve,
he couldn't swim.
Cody.
Nope.
They had those gray,
new balance.

101
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:53.740
Just weighing him down.
Took him right down to the bottom of a goat.

102
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.500
Died an angry man.
One I heard.
What'd you have that built up by?

103
00:05:58.501 --> 00:06:02.650
Some guy who didn't fucking know him.
So I hear most of my shit.

104
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.890
Um,
anyways,
so I have not boozed.
Oh,

105
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.300
oh.
I miss itself.
Somebody gave me the green light to booze too.
I was like,
well,

106
00:06:13.301 --> 00:06:14.320
you know,
I'm not an alcoholic,

107
00:06:14.321 --> 00:06:16.720
but I was definitely drinking like one and this person was like,
well,

108
00:06:16.721 --> 00:06:19.000
I came from a family of alcoholics.
When you drink,

109
00:06:19.001 --> 00:06:20.890
does it get in the way of your life?
Because it's your life.

110
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.470
You're not able to function if you don't have it.
I was like,
no.
She goes,
no,

111
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:27.010
you're not an alcoholic.
I was like,
that was fucking great.

112
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.380
Can you do that the next time I get fat?
Can you tie your shoes?
Yeah.

113
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.920
Well you're going to fet.
Okay.
Can you just keep eating a banana split?

114
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.410
Who the fuck orders a banana split past the age of like six or seven?

115
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.850
Are you out of your fucking mind?
What do you try?

116
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:51.160
Don't you just stick a gun in your mouth?
Spin the barrel and pull the trigger.

117
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.070
Fucking banana split.
You.

118
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.760
What's funny about the banana split the back in the day that was like you

119
00:06:57.761 --> 00:07:02.080
ordered every flavor of ice cream.
You know back in the day there was vanilla,

120
00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:04.750
strawberry,
and chocolate.
That was it.

121
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.540
And he got it from the farmer down the street and there was no fucking

122
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.020
electromagnetic bullshit flying through your fucking head is you sat there,

123
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.030
you walked in,
right when you were like,

124
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.560
Hey Clem,
he,
oh yeah,
yeah.
Gimme all of them.

125
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.350
Give me a scope every there.

126
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.350
I want to pay your fucking mortgage tonight by order in three scoops of fucking

127
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.370
but your mortgage for the month.
I own three scoops of fucking ice cream.

128
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.390
That Ali,
one banana split and half sticking on both sides.

129
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.740
Like a banana fucking ice cream sandwich.
Oh,
doesn't that sound delicious?

130
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.490
I'm hallucinate.
None.
[inaudible] this is July 5th they haven't any chips,

131
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.630
any fucking ice cream.
No cookies,
no cake,

132
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:51.490
no fucking fast food,
no nothing.
And I'm a great shape.

133
00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:54.300
And you know what?
I'm bored.
I'm bored.

134
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.050
I miss the highs of sugar,
the lows of the salt coming back down.

135
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.690
All right?
We want to thank you for flying.

136
00:08:01.691 --> 00:08:03.770
We know you have a lot of choices out there,
right?

137
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:06.470
You just fucking shoving the Saltin after you go.

138
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.080
You went through the stratosphere with the sugar.
Get too high.

139
00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:14.200
Like fucking chuck Yeager when he do that.

140
00:08:14.201 --> 00:08:16.300
How you open up a fucking bag of Jacks?

141
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.660
You stick that Orange Shit right down your fucking throat.

142
00:08:19.661 --> 00:08:22.150
Don't you come on in for a landing

143
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.470
people please refrain from standing up.

144
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.780
Um,
I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about either.
Don't feel lost.

145
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.550
All right?
So anyways,
my way in today.

146
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:37.811
All right.

147
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:42.811
And I needed to be one 74 [inaudible] 74 and I weighed in at one 73.6.

148
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.680
All freckles is fucking killing it.

149
00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:53.080
I've lost 13 pounds on the nose.

150
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:58.081
Dan Marino number can Lisman number 13.

151
00:08:59.420 --> 00:08:59.940
<v 0>Okay,</v>

152
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.020
<v 1>I don't,
what else was number 13?
Whatever.
There's two people,
um,</v>

153
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.630
13 fucking pounds,
13 pounds,
and I'm actually a finally,

154
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.590
people are starting to go,
hey,
you losing weight.
That's how fucking fat I was.

155
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.940
I lose 13 pounds just to kind of be out of shape.
You know?

156
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.590
My man titties are going away.
You know,
I got a little belly,

157
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.300
you know what I mean?
Like,
yeah,
you have to have like a,

158
00:09:25.301 --> 00:09:30.301
like a fucking ever see a rack now or a raccoon or a squirrel goes out and eats

159
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.440
a whole pumpkin that sits there with his fucking belly.
All the standard.

160
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:37.160
That's what I look right now.
I look like a fucking squirrel.
Eight a pocket.

161
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.950
And you're like,
Bill,
why did you come up with that?
Because I saw it.

162
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.940
I fucking saw a squirrel after it did it and it was fucking sitting there.

163
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.490
The big distended,
I get like a trucker belly,
but it was adorable.

164
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.450
That's the kind of stomach I have right now.
Um,
so anyways,

165
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.430
not Jesus Christ.
I got to know what I want.
I gotta do.
I got another one.

166
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:03.480
It was my goal.
One 62.
I'm going down low this time.

167
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.300
I'm getting fucking skinny then and build them back up with the muscle,

168
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.450
right then I'm coming back on the booze and I figured by the end of the year it

169
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:13.500
can be over two bills as good for your heart.
Um,

170
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.680
whenever I'm psyched to have you back down to this God damn weight I feel,

171
00:10:17.681 --> 00:10:19.040
but I am in,
I am in a,

172
00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:20.880
I remember I was telling you guys like the different shape.

173
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:26.130
There's a with a jacket on in shape,
right?

174
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.690
Jacket off and shape.

175
00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:31.820
Buttoned down shirt shape a button down,

176
00:10:31.821 --> 00:10:32.900
tucked in shape.

177
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

178
00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.700
<v 1>I sport coat in there somewhere.
There's a sport coat.</v>

179
00:10:36.701 --> 00:10:39.260
Half the jacket is a sport coat.
Then there's a button down shape.

180
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.260
Then there's t shirt on tuck shape.
That's why I'm at.

181
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.270
Then there's tucked in t shirt,

182
00:10:44.271 --> 00:10:48.260
then there's no t shirt and then the granddaddy of them all sitting down,

183
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.260
no shirt on.
Still have a flat stomach.

184
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.590
The only thing you have is those little fucking wrinkles because you know,

185
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.250
if you actually reach up to get some cereals,
you don't want the skin to tear.

186
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.260
You need like you need it for when you reach

187
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.420
anyways.
Any fucking waste.
Uh,

188
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.940
all right,
so what should I talk about next?
Oh,

189
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.610
<v 0>okay.</v>

190
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.150
<v 1>Rest in peace.
Frank Gifford,
man,
I'm actually really sad about that.</v>

191
00:11:16.151 --> 00:11:20.740
I'm not even gonna lie to you,
man.
That guy was a,
he was the fucking man.

192
00:11:20.741 --> 00:11:23.890
He has such a great voice.
I mean he was part of basically,

193
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.560
he can't say he replaced Keith Jackson.

194
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.690
He replaced him on Monday night football and Keith Jackson,
Dandy,

195
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:36.280
Don Meredith and Howard Cosell.
There's never been a better announcing team,

196
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.610
at least in football as far as I'm concerned.

197
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.860
And I just remember being as a little kid when my dad would actually let me stay

198
00:11:44.861 --> 00:11:48.400
up and watch,
at least the first quarter came on at nine o'clock at night.

199
00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:53.401
So I get to stay up till like nine 39 40 when they would start that Shell and

200
00:11:54.411 --> 00:11:57.530
Frank Gifford would,
I mean Howard Cosell would be doing the highlights.

201
00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.770
That's why I got that thing when I was still doing the draft kings thing because

202
00:12:00.771 --> 00:12:03.830
of that man right there.
I rent an old James Simpson,
right.

203
00:12:03.831 --> 00:12:08.270
And he gets you all fucking amped up for the fucking game.

204
00:12:08.271 --> 00:12:12.770
And then they immediately come back with Frank Gifford,

205
00:12:12.771 --> 00:12:15.320
who just had the best fucking voice ever.

206
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.340
And then Dandy dawn would sing a song.
It was just,
it was the best man.

207
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.840
It was the best.
They always seem like they went out,
got some drinks afterwards.

208
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.730
It's just,
um,
the,
who's kidding,
who,

209
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:31.610
the kind of men that hipsters have been making fun of relentlessly and nerds

210
00:12:31.611 --> 00:12:33.260
have made fun of for whatever,

211
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.320
just basically the guy's guy for one or for whatever reason the guy's guy is,

212
00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:42.620
uh,
I dunno,
I guess cause most writers are nerds,

213
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.130
so they resent the guy's guy.
Cause when they walk into the room,

214
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.520
they've never held court.
I guess.
I don't know what it is,

215
00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.800
not saying I'm a guy's guy,

216
00:12:51.801 --> 00:12:54.290
but I would fucking love to hang out with those guys and I would shut the fuck

217
00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:55.370
up when they told stories,

218
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.243
<v 0>you know,</v>

219
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.510
<v 1>I dunno.</v>

220
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:03.560
It just seems like every fucking commercial now is if there's a guy in it,
right,

221
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.250
if he's not being a complete moron with some woman rolling her fucking eyes,

222
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.500
it's always like some guy out in the woods and he's like,
fucking,

223
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:17.060
uh,
you know,
got a bear and a headlock and chopping down a tree with his foot.

224
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.020
Just this overly ridiculously manly shit.

225
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:22.340
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

226
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.900
<v 1>It's annoying it to me that some do aspire to,
to be an outdoorsman.
You know,</v>

227
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:26.840
it'd be out there in the woods,

228
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.700
see something big and furry and fucking take it out.
You know,

229
00:13:29.701 --> 00:13:33.140
like that dentist did when he went over to Africa.
I mean,
say what you will.

230
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.740
It takes a lot of balls to smuggle a fucking lion's head out of,
out of Africa,

231
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:41.720
doesn't it?
As a dentist of fuck do you get off doing some CIA shit like that.

232
00:13:41.721 --> 00:13:45.710
He just got done doing a fucking composite on Friday.
A Monday.

233
00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:49.820
You're coming back with a lion's head.
It's incredible.
I don't,

234
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.610
I don't condone it.
I'm a big fan of fucking animals,
which is why,
you know,

235
00:13:53.611 --> 00:13:57.120
at the end of the day with all these electromagnetic fields taken a bunch of

236
00:13:57.121 --> 00:13:59.010
people out in the future,
that really doesn't bug me.

237
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.023
<v 0>You know,</v>

238
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.150
<v 1>it doesn't bug me.
We got it.
It's time for us to go it alone.</v>

239
00:14:04.151 --> 00:14:06.760
At least like thin the herd,
right?

240
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.840
Maybe these corporations are doing a good thing.
They're fucking,
they're,

241
00:14:09.841 --> 00:14:14.200
they're making like a,
uh,
corporation raid,
you know,

242
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.990
kills bugs dead.
Maybe go punch in.
Oh my God.

243
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.720
Can imagine the fucking nerds that are going to be dropping,

244
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.113
<v 0>you know,</v>

245
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.700
<v 1>full amount of fucking nerds that are going to die and then Jesus Christ.</v>

246
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:32.060
Then what are we going to do?
No.
Back to the fucking stone age.

247
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.730
You need nerds.
Just like you need the guy's guy,

248
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:36.803
<v 0>right?</v>

249
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.790
<v 1>You got to have somebody out there doing extra manly.</v>

250
00:14:39.791 --> 00:14:42.220
So you know what kills me is the amount of people that are making fun of Frank

251
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.600
Gifford had one fucking affair.

252
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.743
<v 0>You know,</v>

253
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.880
<v 1>if he had more than that,
fuck you.</v>

254
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.990
You walk a day in his fucking cleats being the star fucking halfback.

255
00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.770
You know the New York giants,

256
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.130
He played in the greatest game ever played against the fucking cold.

257
00:15:00.131 --> 00:15:04.750
She won a championship.
You played for USC,
you know?
Yeah.

258
00:15:04.751 --> 00:15:08.320
High School football team.
I mean football stadium in Bakersfield,

259
00:15:08.321 --> 00:15:12.830
California is named after you.
Let's see.

260
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:17.210
You handle that fucking those beautiful women throwing themselves at you.

261
00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:17.481
You know,

262
00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:20.840
Catholic Lee's giving you shit about where you're putting your shoes and all of

263
00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:25.200
that.
Then you go out and there she is bad.
No fucking Isaiah.
Yeah.

264
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.063
<v 0>You know,</v>

265
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.260
<v 1>you walk a day in those fucking,
you fucking don't do anything.</v>

266
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.630
Then you could judge frank until then.

267
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:38.400
You shut your fucking ringless championship fingers.

268
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.300
Gfe Cif,
ring less fingers.
I think that that's how I'm supposed to say.
Um,

269
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.610
anyways.
Yeah,
so that's it.
They're all gone.

270
00:15:47.611 --> 00:15:50.820
Keith Jackson is the last one and this is all making me feel very,

271
00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:55.320
very fucking old.
This whole changing of the guard man,
all of these guys,

272
00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:59.880
Vin Scully,
Keith Jackson,
Frank Gifford,
how cause sell all these guys,

273
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.680
you know,
as these new guys,
he's snarky fucking cons.

274
00:16:04.681 --> 00:16:08.280
Who come in and sit there taking the piss out of the fucking athletes,

275
00:16:08.281 --> 00:16:12.840
that ESPN thing,
which was kind of funny at first when they made the highlights.

276
00:16:12.841 --> 00:16:17.290
Kind of funny,
but I don't know.
I don't like it.
Now
you're a nerd.

277
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.450
It's why you're behind a desk.

278
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.290
That guy's an athlete and he's better than you and you won his life.

279
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.110
Quit taking pot shots at him when he's not around.

280
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.180
And I could say that because I never take pot shots on athletes.

281
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:32.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

282
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.970
<v 1>On this podcast.
Yes I do.
I've done it all the fucking,
I'm a fucking hypocrite.</v>

283
00:16:35.971 --> 00:16:37.810
What do you want from me?
What Bell?

284
00:16:37.811 --> 00:16:40.620
We'd like a quality podcast every once in a while.
Oh,

285
00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.420
would you stop with the hurtful shit?
All right.
What am I doing?
Hell,
it's,

286
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:48.480
let's read some advertising here.
See how long these people last?

287
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.580
Um,
all right,

288
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.080
<v 2>well,
we got a new advertiser this week.
Well,
God knows some slots have opened up.</v>

289
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.330
All right,
trunk club.
Everybody

290
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.250

291
00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

292
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.390
<v 2>Jesus Christ.
These people,
they've,</v>

293
00:17:06.391 --> 00:17:10.790
they write copy once and that means you're too busy firing up the grill and

294
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:13.850
sunning in the sand.
Even think about setting foot in a mall.

295
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.490
The problem is you still need to look fresh.

296
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.340
All snap trunk club gets it.

297
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:23.540
That's why they've taken the hassle man out of shopping by shipping you a trunk

One more time.

313
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:24.300
trunk club.com/bar all right,
let's blow through these this week.

314
00:18:24.301 --> 00:18:27.810
What do we say how people,
I only got two more.
All right is the newbies,

315
00:18:27.811 --> 00:18:31.920
the newbies on the block,
fresh fish,

316
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.860
Oh our friends here at next issue.

317

318
00:18:39.091 --> 00:18:43.080
there,
but who has time to sift through all the nonsense on the Internet?

319
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:48.660
Hey,
I'm on the Internet.
My podcast is all he call my podcast,

320
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.510
call it nonsense.

321
00:18:51.511 --> 00:18:55.020
for those of us who want premium content and don't have time to waste finding

322
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:55.920

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.610

you can try next issue for free right now when you go to next issue.com/burr and

336
00:19:44.581 --> 00:19:45.031
lastly,

337
00:19:45.031 --> 00:19:49.950
but certainly not leastly stamps.com there,

338
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.410
there's gotta be a better way to mail and ship stuff.

339
00:19:52.411 --> 00:19:54.810
Going to the post office takes up way too much time.

340
00:19:54.811 --> 00:19:59.730
Leasing a postage meter sucks and it's way too expensive.
Turns out,
guess what?

341
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.990
There's a way better way stamps.com with stamps.com you can buy and print

342
00:20:03.991 --> 00:20:05.370
official US postage,

343
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:09.810
not counterfeit official US postage for any letter or package right from your

344
00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:14.790
desk using your own computer and Britta even get special posted discounts.

345
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:15.571
She can't find it.

346
00:20:15.571 --> 00:20:20.571
The post office plus stamps.com is more powerful than a postage meter at just a

347
00:20:20.881 --> 00:20:22.200
fraction of the cost.

348
00:20:22.201 --> 00:20:27.201
You can save at least 50% compared to the postage meter and you'll avoid all

349
00:20:27.271 --> 00:20:31.230
those time consuming trips to the post office and you won't have to smell some

350
00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:35.340
old woman's hair.
I use stamps.com domain a lot.
All my posters,

351
00:20:35.341 --> 00:20:38.610

356
00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:55.051
microphone@thetopofthehomepageandtypeinabirdthatstampsdotcomenterbirthstamps.com.

357
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:59.400
That's it for hi stamps.com comment to burp.

358
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.940
All right there we did it.
We got through it.
It's over.

359
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.570
Um,
so anyways,
oh,
you know what,

360
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:10.630
I get finally fucking gave it to uh,

361
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.550
Jimmy Page for like the 50th time since John Bonam has died,

362
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:20.580
has figured out a new way to repackage the same fucking 10 11 albums that they

363
00:21:21.311 --> 00:21:26.140
made.
And I bought all of them every fucking time.

364
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:28.030
And this time I was like,
you know what?

365
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.890
Fuck you Jimmy page.
I'm done.

366
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:37.330
I'm done with you coming up with the same bag of fucking goods and it just

367
00:21:37.331 --> 00:21:40.000
putting a different fucking rapper on it.
And then,
you know,

368
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.440
we'll still never received phone,
never before seen photos at all of that shit.

369
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.470
Um,
so I ignored the first one.

370
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:50.950
I ignored the second one and now the final one came out,

371
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.050
led Zepplin presence,
led Zeppelin in through the outdoor and led Zepplin Coda.

372
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.510
And I guess the Cota one has been getting some rave reviews.

373
00:21:58.511 --> 00:22:01.900
So I finally said fuck it.
And I went down and I bought all three of them,

374
00:22:01.901 --> 00:22:06.190
but I didn't buy the boxing that came with a booklet.
Listen,

375
00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.720
never seen before photos,
but 99% of them have already fucking scene,

376
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:16.270
you know.
And uh,
I haven't had a listen to it yet,

377
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:17.620
but I went down,
I bought those.
I didn't get,

378
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.200
I didn't get the whole big fucking thing with the cds and all of that.

379
00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:23.080
God Damn Horse Shit.
Um,
and Jimmy promises,

380
00:22:23.081 --> 00:22:26.860
this is the last time that he's going to repackage this shit.
And uh,

381
00:22:26.861 --> 00:22:28.960
I did pretty good this time.
I only bought,

382
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.330
<v 3>yeah,</v>

383
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:35.280
<v 1>I only bought like one,
one issue of it.
I know they didn't,
one of them,</v>

384
00:22:35.281 --> 00:22:39.990
they won't like the very,
you know,
the,
that hey,
hey,
what can you do?

385
00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:41.070
Like it's still obscure.

386
00:22:41.071 --> 00:22:43.320
It's like he can listen to that whenever you want on the Internet.

387
00:22:43.321 --> 00:22:47.250
And it's also you fucking release that on some box set.

388
00:22:47.251 --> 00:22:48.390
I remember in the 90s,

389
00:22:48.391 --> 00:22:53.340
the one that had the fucking shadow of the Zeppelin over the cornfields.

390
00:22:53.341 --> 00:22:58.290
Right?
Isn't that what happened?
I don't fucking know.
I Dunno.

391
00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:58.830
But um,

392
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.920
I've been playing drums like a fucking maniac and I've been taking lessons

393
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.580
trying to work on my technique and it turns out I was doing everything wrong.

394
00:23:05.581 --> 00:23:08.370
So literally today I'm learning how to hit a fucking snare drum,

395
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.650
something I've done probably 100,000 times in my life thinking I was doing it

396
00:23:13.651 --> 00:23:18.510
correctly.
And um,
anybody who plays drums,

397
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:23.340
if you ever get a chance to just break down everything that you do,

398
00:23:23.341 --> 00:23:24.420
it's fucking amazing.

399
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.253
<v 3>MMM.</v>

400
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.120
<v 1>This teacher I have and he's showing me all this stuff where,
uh,</v>

401
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.900
just even like where I was hitting the shaft of the stick on the high hat,

402
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.630
I was hitting it where it was starting to taper so I wasn't getting,

403
00:23:37.631 --> 00:23:40.780
it was getting more of a tinny sound and he had me move it up.

404
00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:46.040
That was night and day,
the molar method of,
of just my arm,

405
00:23:46.041 --> 00:23:49.040
totally fucking relaxed,
getting a better sound.

406
00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:52.410
And then today he was showing me something,

407
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.310
I was playing something on the bellow this symbol.

408
00:23:54.311 --> 00:23:56.450
And because of the way I was holding the stick,

409
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.180
like whenever I hit the bell and you could hear the bell,

410
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:00.560
but it never sounded good.

411
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.770
But now because I wasn't choking the shit out of this stick.

412
00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:05.260
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

413
00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:10.080
<v 1>Like the stick has a different sound and it makes a different noise.</v>

414
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.340
It makes it more like,
it's like a brighter,
it was like I was chair,

415
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.230
I was choking on the stick,
which was choking off the sound of the symbol,

416
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.330
all the drums and all of that type of thing.

417
00:24:19.331 --> 00:24:23.020
And I would get fucking blisters and shit.
Um,
and I always say,
oh,

418
00:24:23.021 --> 00:24:25.570
I haven't played in a while.
So I got blistered.
It's like,
no,
you're dope.

419
00:24:25.571 --> 00:24:29.080
You're holding it fucking stick wrong.
So,
um,

420
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.740
<v 0>okay.</v>

421
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.460
<v 1>I Dunno.
So I'm going to just,
just do that like 15 times a day.</v>

422
00:24:34.461 --> 00:24:38.210
It's so it'd be like if she drove a car for 20 fucking years and all of a sudden

423
00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:42.490
somebody showed you a different way to drive a car and if you want,
but if you,

424
00:24:42.491 --> 00:24:43.550
as you got behind the wheel,

425
00:24:43.551 --> 00:24:46.070
be totally uncomfortable and you couldn't drive it as well as you could.

426
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:51.920
And the temptations just go back to the other fucking way is a,
is,
is the,

427
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.790
is the biggest battle out of all of it.
But,
uh,
I am going to,
uh,

428
00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:01.220
I'm going to stick with it and,
uh,
as I,
as I,

429
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:04.880
as I do as Shit,
you know,
I tried to stick with shit once they start to learn,

430
00:25:04.881 --> 00:25:09.430
speaking to that man,
I think,
uh,
all my shit's gonna come this week for me,
uh,

431
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.050
for the big green egg and I'm finally going to try and smoke something,

432
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.130
fuck it up,
and then fix it.
So I'm going to get the smallest pork shoulder.

433
00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:20.330
Maybe we'll just get some ribs and I'll try smoking those fucking things.

434
00:25:20.331 --> 00:25:24.730
Just see if I can actually get a,
a,
a,
uh,

435
00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.520
so I'm able to keep it at,
at a,
at a certain temperature.
I don't,

436
00:25:28.521 --> 00:25:30.110
I still don't get how you fucking do it.

437
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:33.950
I've watched all these goddamn youtube videos actually was on PBS today watching

438
00:25:33.951 --> 00:25:38.780
a barbecue show.
Uh,
by the way,
PBS,
unbelievably underrated.
PBS.

439
00:25:38.781 --> 00:25:41.480
It's like you watch something and then they show upcoming programs.
It's like,

440
00:25:41.481 --> 00:25:45.980
I want to watch all of that.
That all seems cool.
So,
um,

441
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:50.270
anyways,
but you know,
something,
let's,
I'm all over the fucking map today.

442
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.310
Speaking of Frank Gifford,
which I was like 20 God damn minutes ago.
Um,

443
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.020
<v 0>okay.</v>

444
00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:57.920
<v 1>Football season.</v>

445
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:59.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

446
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.610
<v 1>How far away is it now?
It starts in the second week of September.</v>

447
00:26:02.611 --> 00:26:04.860
Is that what the fuck it is?
I have no idea.

448
00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.110
All I know is Tom Brady comes back in the fifth week.

449
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.350
Nice and rested nice and pissed off.
So I'm fucking excited about that.

450
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.440
I know college football starts,
I think like the first week,

451
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:17.040
maybe of September.
Um,

452
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:21.820
I was sitting there fucking looking for something to watch today.
I watched,

453
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.730
uh,
a couple seconds of the wn Ba and I was like,
all right,

454
00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:30.990
let me find a baseball game,
which I couldn't find.

455
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.520
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

456
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.220
<v 1>cause I don't have the MLB package.
Um,</v>

457
00:26:35.221 --> 00:26:37.350
so there was no game on when I turned it on.
So then I,

458
00:26:37.351 --> 00:26:39.630
I watched a whole thing on that,
that,

459
00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.110
that 13 year old girl that pitched to the little league world,

460
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:45.570
watch something on her,

461
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.130
then went back to the w NBA and then there's just next thing you know,

462
00:26:50.131 --> 00:26:55.131
I'm watching like a fucking how to smoke meat on PBS because there's absolutely

463
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:59.040
nothing going on.
Maybe that's why they're doing all this Tom Brady Shit.

464
00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:03.370
It's just like completely fucking a slow news day.
Nobody knows what the,

465
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.760
you know,
like,
what do you do

466
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.910
fucking,
I,
I'm like the amount of,
I that's my best when I'm doing all this shit.

467
00:27:11.911 --> 00:27:15.240
Learn how to play drums,
taking the fucking,
uh,
autorotation class,

468
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.290
all of that shit.
I'm getting those things down.
Everybody.
The one 80 autos,

469
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:23.190
get it done.
I,
you guys don't give a fuck about any of this.
Let me,
uh,

470
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.270
here's something for you.
I bought those fucking Zeplin things on,
on vinyl.

471
00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:30.450
And I want to tell you guys that the reason why I buy vinyl is because I just

472
00:27:30.451 --> 00:27:32.430
think it looks cool.
It's a nice big,

473
00:27:32.431 --> 00:27:36.180
actually see what the album cover looks like.
You can hold it in your hand,

474
00:27:36.181 --> 00:27:38.590
you know?
Okay.
It doesn't,
you know,

475
00:27:38.591 --> 00:27:41.830
all of a sudden have a little cloud next to it and then I got to buy it again or

476
00:27:41.831 --> 00:27:43.750
something crashes.
I liked that,
but I'm,

477
00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:48.530
I'm going to be the first to tell you I cannot tell the difference even remotely

478
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:52.550
between vinyl,
a cassette tape,
a CD,

479
00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.050
or fucking digital.

480
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:59.100
I have no idea what little Steven is talking about and all these fucking rock

481
00:27:59.101 --> 00:28:02.190
stars at a scene that I am not going to be that guy that goes,
it sounds better.

482
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.710
Huh?
Can,
can you hear that?
Can you hear that Bass Drum pedal?

483
00:28:06.711 --> 00:28:09.760
That sounds the exact fucking same to me.
Okay.

484
00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.650
Same thing with all those reissued guitars is a reissued 1959 Les Paul.

485
00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.330
Here's a real one.
You hear the difference?
No Sir.
Not at all.

486
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.690
That's probably cause I have shitty years,
which you know what?

487
00:28:22.691 --> 00:28:23.830
There's a bliss in that.

488
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

489
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.880
<v 1>Yeah.
That's how I can drive a Prius.</v>

490
00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.213
<v 0>Okay.</v>

491
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.880
<v 1>I drove a Goddamn 2008 Prius in traffic right next to a fucking lamp.</v>

492
00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:37.270
Gainey today the dead.
You know what the fuck's he going,

493
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.830
dude,
you have a,
if you drive a Lamborghini down the street,

494
00:28:40.831 --> 00:28:42.570
you are a fucking jerk off.

495
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.680
The only time that car should be on the street is if it's driving up to a ramp

496
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:49.710
to be loaded onto a truck to then be taken to the track.

497
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.750
What kind of a fucking asshole?

498
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.580
I guess you drive around and just women fucking drop their panties.

499
00:28:56.581 --> 00:28:59.400
I guess that's why you do it,
you know?

500
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:02.640
But then by all means,
don't date.

501
00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:05.160
Don't date some woman that just runs up to your Lamborghini.

502
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.350
He can't fucking date that.
You can't.

503
00:29:07.351 --> 00:29:10.050
What you gotta do is you've got to drive around like a fucking Ford escort

504
00:29:10.051 --> 00:29:13.590
station wagon.
Right.
And then start hitting on women,

505
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.970
you know?
Well,
let me ask too,
that's too much.
That's too much of a test.

506
00:29:17.971 --> 00:29:21.720
What kind of fuck a woman wants that,
you know,
they're allowed to have standards,

507
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.440
you know?
Oh,
are we built?
Thank you.
Yeah.

508
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.920
I'd say drive around in a fucking,
uh,
uh,
late model.
Uh,

509
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.540
maybe a Nissan leaf

510
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.070
just drive around.

511
00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:39.750
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

512
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:43.370
<v 1>Yeah,
that'd be a fucking interesting,
like fucking prank shell.</v>

513
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:48.560
If you let a guy,
he pulls up in a Nissan leaf and he fucking hits on some chick,

514
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:53.510
right?
She tells him to fuck off and he drives away in his fucking electric car.

515
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:55.120
They drives around the Coney,

516
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:59.250
puts on a fake mustache and a hat and now he's in a Lamborghini just to see that

517
00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:03.380
her different fucking attitude.
But is that really fair?
That's not fair,
is it?

518
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:04.660
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

519
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.330
<v 1>Why wouldn't a woman want to talk to a guy in a Lamborghini?</v>

520
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.860
What is she supposed to do?
You know?

521
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.840
Well,
woman lays in beds going,
you know what?

522
00:30:15.841 --> 00:30:18.570
Someday I'm going to meet my prince charming and he's going to pull up in a

523
00:30:18.571 --> 00:30:21.210
Nissan leaf.
They don't think that,
do they?

524
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.780
I Dunno what they think.
Why would I talk for them?

525
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:29.310
Do you think Katelyn knows what they think now or Bruce now knows?

526
00:30:29.311 --> 00:30:31.740
Cause now he's Caitlyn.
You ever think about that?

527
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:34.550
<v 0>Okay.</v>

528
00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:36.980
<v 1>Do you think Katelyn looks in the mirror every once in awhile</v>

529
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.200
and talks to Bruce.

530
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.960
<v 0>Okay.</v>

531
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.040
<v 1>I can't,
I can't imagine what that must be like.
You know what I mean?</v>

532
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:50.130
Cause if you wanted to do that right now,
you've freed yourself,

533
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:55.500
but then you know what I mean?
Don't you miss the other person a little bit.

534
00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.110
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

535
00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:01.330
<v 1>Then you have all his fucking memories.
You'd like fucking Robo Cop.</v>

536
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:07.040
You know,
you
start having like flashbacks and shit.

537
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:09.953
<v 0>I Dunno.</v>

538
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.200
<v 1>I don't fucking know.</v>

539
00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:16.520
All I know is I wish Bruce gave a farewell.

540
00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.170
That would have been awesome.
You know what I mean?
Eh.
Great.

541
00:31:21.171 --> 00:31:24.960
Thai be and Bruce sold a lot of ways.

542
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.823
Yeah.

543
00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:28.230
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

544
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:32.530
<v 1>One that decathlon,
I was on chips,</v>

545
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.750
right?
Very great town with all you guys.

546
00:31:36.751 --> 00:31:41.550
I bought a day Ghalia being there for me.
Is it?

547
00:31:41.551 --> 00:31:43.750
This is a living wake

548
00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:47.970
for fucking Bruce Jenner and then he just walks off.

549
00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:52.890
You get to give them one more standing ovation.
I think that's what fucks me up.

550
00:31:52.891 --> 00:31:54.300
But I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

551
00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:57.763
<v 0>No.</v>

552
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.090
<v 1>Which happens when somebody fucking dies.
We didn't die.
He just became Caitlyn.</v>

553
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.170
I got to meet her to see if I can just be like,
Katelyn,

554
00:32:08.171 --> 00:32:12.220
do you mind if I asked Bruce a question?
What can I ask a Bruce question?

555
00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.540
How do I phrase this without getting in trouble with you?

556
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:18.243
<v 0>MMM.</v>

557
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:21.710
<v 1>Glancing down at a feet,
you know,</v>

558
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.580
see if he can fucking see all those years of running track and field down there.

559
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.090
You know,
I think Katelyn goes with a closed toe shoe when you,

560
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:32.570
<v 0>okay.</v>

561
00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:33.620
<v 1>Probably his hammer toes.</v>

562
00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.830
You can't do all those events without him fucked up feet.
You know what I mean?

563
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.080
I mean,
Jesus Christ,
if you danced in

564
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.810
<v 0>wicked for fun or rage stage for fucking five seasons,</v>

565
00:32:42.811 --> 00:32:46.380
you're feeding and be fucked up for life.
And that's a God damn musical.
This guy,

566
00:32:46.381 --> 00:32:49.810
this guy want to,
why don't you want to fuck a decathlon?
Okay,

567
00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:55.260
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
There's got to be some fucked up.
Fucking,</v>

568
00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.060
we just got the most fucked up feet.
Basketball players,

569
00:33:00.061 --> 00:33:03.780
tennis players.
Oh,
by the way,
I'm reading this Andre Agassi,

570
00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:08.070
a autobiography that somebody gave me.
Man,
it's fucking unbelievable.

571
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:11.490
Jesus Christ.
I'm only like,

572
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:17.670
like the first 60 pages.
He ain't one of those dads that just decided that,

573
00:33:17.671 --> 00:33:19.740
that it's like,
hey,
guess what you're doing?

574
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.370
You're going to be the number one tennis player in the world and you're sitting

575
00:33:23.371 --> 00:33:27.110
there like,
I just want to play with my legos.
And he's like,

576
00:33:27.111 --> 00:33:29.660
shut the fuck up and get outside.

577
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.320
I built you a tennis court and then you go out there and you just do that every

578
00:33:33.321 --> 00:33:36.770
fucking day and you don't want to do it.
It's unbelievable.

579
00:33:36.771 --> 00:33:41.771
What fucking kills me is he didn't want to do it and any still won Wimbledon.

580
00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.830
He still won the US Open.
Did he win the French?
I'm not sure.
Did He,

581
00:33:45.831 --> 00:33:48.770
did he get the career Grand Slam?
Oh,
I think that's time to look it up.

582
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:54.110
Let's put this apple computer that might be fucking radiate my nuts right now.

583
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:57.890
All right,
hang on a second.

584
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.070
I actually thought for half a second that if I did get it,

585
00:34:01.071 --> 00:34:04.370
at least I'd get a flat fucking stomach.
How obsessed in my with this shit.

586
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:09.680
All right,
Andre Agassi crushed me when I found out I was fucking two years old.

587
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:12.400
Oh look at that.
The Internet doesn't work in here.

588
00:34:12.401 --> 00:34:14.980
Isn't that fucking wonderful?

589
00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.880
Jesus fucking Christ.
Um,
I give up with the shit.

590
00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:26.700
Do you know today I want to use the calculator on my phone and I don't know what

591
00:34:26.701 --> 00:34:27.420
button I hit.

592
00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.840
It just fucking kept doubling the number and I couldn't get it to stop and I

593
00:34:30.841 --> 00:34:35.220
kept hitting clear and I finally,
I just set the fucking thing down.
I went over,

594
00:34:35.221 --> 00:34:38.880
I got a fucking pencil and a pen,
a pen,
I'm sorry.

595
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.550
And a pad of paper and I just worked it out the old fucking way.

596
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:44.110
And you know what?
My,

597
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:49.150
my brain and my hand will never be obsolete till I die.

598
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.440
Right then who gives a fuck as I'm dead,
you know?

599
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.460
No,
it's upgraded and I'll get the new one right.

600
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:03.630
That weird.
Everything about that.
Your hands,

601
00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:07.050
the same fucking hand that you've been jerking off with since you figured out

602
00:35:07.051 --> 00:35:09.570
how to do it then unreal.

603
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:12.451
You ever think about that?

604
00:35:12.451 --> 00:35:15.690
You bought it on my fucking hand is 47 fucking years old.

605
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.200
You think in the future you can just get like new shit.
You know what I mean?

606
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:25.050
Like on your car,
how you start,
it goes after a while,

607
00:35:25.051 --> 00:35:28.380
then you've got to get a new starter and you fuck as a car will last forever if

608
00:35:28.381 --> 00:35:29.610
you just keep replacing the parts.

609
00:35:29.611 --> 00:35:32.610
I think that that's what they're working on doing,
you know?

610
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:36.120
But God knows that won't be available to us if they ever figured out how to

611
00:35:36.121 --> 00:35:39.220
fucking do that.
Right.
They keep it for themselves.

612
00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.360
This is where the conspiracy theory guy comes in if they don't have that
already.

613
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:46.300
Um,
but they would keep that shift for themselves.
Right.

614
00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:49.510
And they just keep fucking,
you know,

615
00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:54.120
unscrewing and then re screwing a new fucking head on their body like a goddamn

616
00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:59.080
light bulb,
you know?
Then in the future you can pick out different heads,

617
00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.160
like,
what do you want to look like?
You know what I mean?

618
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:09.350
You can just try out everything
you want to be looking like a Schlub,

619
00:36:09.351 --> 00:36:14.090
but you could be like every fucking race,
every hairstyle.

620
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:14.953
You know,

621
00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.530
you just keep putting your brain in there and be like getting a new fucking car

622
00:36:18.531 --> 00:36:22.580
every couple of years.
Who doesn't want to do that?
Would you do it?

623
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:25.790
Would you just ride it out?
But anyways,

624
00:36:25.791 --> 00:36:27.110
I think that that they're going to fucking,

625
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.300
they gonna have it right now cause they're you there.

626
00:36:29.301 --> 00:36:31.850
You can grow like a fucking ear in a petri dish.
Right.

627
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.930
They could do that for years.
Then all of a sudden they stopped talking about it.

628
00:36:35.931 --> 00:36:40.340
They grow ear and a fucking petri dish and then all of a sudden there was no

629
00:36:40.341 --> 00:36:43.130
more talk about it.
You eat all those fuckers didn't stop with,

630
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.110
I bet they could do the whole head now.

631
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:48.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

632
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:48.933
<v 1>Think about it,
man.</v>

633
00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.080
What a Dick Cheney GFE he's got all those problems with his heart,
right?

634
00:36:53.081 --> 00:36:56.710
Where the fuck did he go?
I bet he's off somewhere getting a new fucking heart,

635
00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.690
getting a new ticker.
You know what I mean?

636
00:36:58.691 --> 00:37:03.160
Like a new crate motor came in the other day when that'd be fucking awesome.

637
00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:08.020
Then you just keep going.
You know what it is is

638
00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.790
the temptation to sell that to the masses.

639
00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:16.990
You know all the fucking money that he could make.

640
00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:20.680
Cause that's what the fuck they were in to right data.

641
00:37:20.681 --> 00:37:23.800
Eventually you have to do it and then they would give us,
you know,

642
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:28.450
we wouldn't get as good as fucking the hedge is.
They got,

643
00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:34.660
it'd be like whiskey.
They be drinking like Scotch,
like top shelf fucking shit.

644
00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.880
And we would just get like,
you know the bud light a heads,
you know,

645
00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.950
keystone light,
fucking heart hands or some shit.

646
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.040
And that would be like,
that'll be,

647
00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:50.830
that's going to be the goal in the future to make enough money that you can

648
00:37:50.831 --> 00:37:51.611
actually,
you know,

649
00:37:51.611 --> 00:37:54.250
when you get your replacement head you can actually get a good one,

650
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:57.160
like a decent look in one,
you know?

651
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:59.083
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

652
00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:04.410
<v 1>You go out,
you fucking get a get a deal or some shit.</v>

653
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.320
You come and just some money,
your parents can be like,
all right,

654
00:38:07.321 --> 00:38:10.170
I don't go out there and blow it all on her head.

655
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:14.340
Shaved some for feet and hands in the future.

656
00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.890
<v 4>Well,
mom,
if I have a better head,
I can get a better broad.</v>

657
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:20.760
<v 0>Okay?</v>

658
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.610
<v 4>I you don't need it do that.</v>

659
00:38:22.611 --> 00:38:27.560
You just save up money and you buy the broad,
you're with a better head.

660
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.780
She loves you for who you are,
Blah.

661
00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.990
<v 1>You there?
Can you see that?
The future I kid.
Oh,</v>

662
00:38:37.991 --> 00:38:40.600
I see a future where heads will be sold.

663
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:43.030
Where do they get their heads while they grow up?

664
00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.120
Then they'll have like bootleg heads you off to get lucky.

665
00:38:46.121 --> 00:38:49.390
Gheybi you got to have like your own fucking head farm.
You gotta be like,

666
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:51.760
it's gotta be like sanctioned by the government,

667
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:56.820
regulated and all that shit at Tarzana today I'll raid on a bootleg head farm,

668
00:38:58.301 --> 00:38:58.481
right?

669
00:38:58.481 --> 00:39:01.540
And then a big fucking greenhouse with a bunch of heads in there and everybody

670
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:03.880
running out.
Um,

671
00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:09.680
then Denzel plays the fucking greatest fucking bootleg head dealer ever.

672
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:13.890
You know,
kick off,
right?
He's got a bunch of fucking heads buying.

673
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:15.810
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

674
00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:17.680
<v 1>Right.
And everybody's like,
well,
that fucking movies,</v>

675
00:39:17.681 --> 00:39:21.400
just like his other movies just with heads.
Oh yeah.
Well,
you fucking right.
One,

676
00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.060
<v 4>you can't.
Um,</v>

677
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:29.550
<v 1>I right.
What the fuck up to,
how many minutes is it?
I'm just trying to fill time.</v>

678
00:39:29.551 --> 00:39:33.150
You know,
it gives a shit.
I'm all right.
By the way,
everybody,

679
00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.580
if you'd like to donate to this podcast,
um,

680
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:40.710
here's an easy way to do it that won't cost you any fucking money.

681
00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:45.550
Next time you go on to Amazon,
just go to bill,

00:39:48.841 --> 00:39:51.360
Then you're on Amazon.
No fucking big deal.
All right.

684
00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:54.120
And then they kick money back to me for driving traffic there.

685
00:39:54.121 --> 00:39:57.810
It doesn't cost you any money.
10% of the money I kicked back to Saint Jude.

686
00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.530
In fact,
I owe those fuckers a check this week.

you know,
I actually,
you know,
when I buy shit on Amazon,
I go through my website.

688
00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.110
What a cheap prick her.

689

I would go with that old guy.
Oh,

699
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:53.500

All right.
I know what kind of slow at the posters,

700
00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:55.630
but everybody else was like,
hey,

701
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.620
we'll send out your posters and we're going to take 90% of the profit.

702
00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:02.253

I'll refund your God damn money.
All right,

705
00:41:11.351 --> 00:41:12.610
It's just a fucking poster.

706
00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.813
<v 4>MMM.</v>

724
00:42:18.901 --> 00:42:22.950
they asked me if I wanted to name the show and I was like,

725
00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:27.530
And there's only one thing I could name it.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.400
<v 1>Led Zeppelin shot the song remains the same in that building.</v>

729
00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.570
What do I name my special?

730
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:42.150
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

731
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.380
<v 1>come on.
Thank you.</v>

732
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.700
<v 0>Does anybody remember laughter?</v>

733
00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:53.140
<v 1>Do you remember that Robert Plant said that he gets so much shit for saying that</v>

734
00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:57.880
he sees said that uh,
during the,
uh,
stairway to heaven,

735
00:42:57.881 --> 00:42:58.610
right?

736
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:02.950
He's like in the four is will echo with laughter.

737
00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.253
<v 0>Does anybody,</v>

738
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:10.260
<v 1>everybody shit on him because it was very topical.</v>

739
00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.290
They shot that in like 73 or 74.

740
00:43:13.291 --> 00:43:17.190
So the Vietnam War was winding down in the last 10 years.

741
00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:21.660
Anybody with the vision was shot and killed by alone,

742
00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:26.400
crazed gunman,
both Kennedys,
Martin Luther King,

743
00:43:26.401 --> 00:43:30.360
Malcolm x,
Medgar Evers,
all these fucking great people got whacked.

744
00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:36.270
And I was aware of Watergate was going on in the fucking gas prices were going

745
00:43:36.271 --> 00:43:41.271
up through the fucking roof or petrol is the fucking English people say it has

746
00:43:42.451 --> 00:43:45.810
all the,
that was a legitimate question in 1973.

747
00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:47.130
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

748
00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:50.310
<v 1>Does anybody remember?
Laughter?
Uh,
but then,
you know,</v>

749
00:43:50.311 --> 00:43:52.070
the 80s came and everybody was on coke do it.

750
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:54.750
What the fuck is this guy talking about?
I'm laughing all the way to the bank,

751
00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:59.130
bud.
Fox greed is good.
So yeah,
so that's the name of the show.

752
00:43:59.131 --> 00:44:00.420
Does anybody remember laughter?

753
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:02.970
And I liked it because led Zeppelin fans will get it.

754
00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.510
And I also like it because people who drive by,

755
00:44:05.511 --> 00:44:08.270
it'll look like the most arrogant thing ever.
Like I'm saying,

756
00:44:08.271 --> 00:44:10.640
I'm the greatest comedian ever,

757
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.230
and none of these other comics that making you laugh.

758
00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.830
Um,
so
yeah,
so that's happening.

759
00:44:19.831 --> 00:44:24.480
So I'm doing that and uh,
I already know what I'm going to do if they let me,

760
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:25.171
if they let me,

761
00:44:25.171 --> 00:44:28.050
I'm going to rent a drum kit and I'm going to bring it into that building.

762
00:44:28.051 --> 00:44:30.300
And during the day when it's completely empty,

763
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:34.530
I'm going to fucking in my fucking iPhone and I'm going to,
I'm going to play

764
00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:35.680
<v 0>okay</v>

765
00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.940
<v 1>to all my fucking Zeppelin,
shit,
Motley Crue,
all that shit that I came up with.</v>

766
00:44:39.941 --> 00:44:41.350
And then before the show starts,

767
00:44:41.351 --> 00:44:45.100
I'm removing the drum kit because I would never make you sit through that

768
00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.780
during the day.
I'm going to have a good fucking time.
Uh,

769
00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:54.400
me and Paul Versey are going to be,
uh,
doing it.
I might add somebody else.

770
00:44:54.401 --> 00:44:59.260
I'm not sure yet,
but as of right now,
it's being Paul Versey and uh,

771
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:00.620
<v 0>okay.</v>

772
00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.200
<v 1>Paul's fucking hilarious.
He was all excited about,
you know,</v>

773
00:45:03.201 --> 00:45:05.210
cause he had biggest nick nicks fan ever.

774
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:07.123
<v 4>MMM.</v>

775
00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.410
<v 1>And he said to me,
he goes,
dude,
you know what's funny?
He goes,</v>

776
00:45:10.411 --> 00:45:14.400
I already know what my opening jokes going to be.
He knows it in August.

777
00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.200
That's how much of a fuck I'm just going to say.

778
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:21.450
Somehow it has to be about the Knicks is what I'm guessing.
Um,
so anyways,

779
00:45:21.451 --> 00:45:25.860
let's get into the,
uh,
the questions here by the way,

780
00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:27.120
that it's an unbelievable,

781
00:45:27.121 --> 00:45:29.580
I can't believe I'm going to get to do that and I want to thank everybody who's

782
00:45:29.581 --> 00:45:34.581
come out to my shows over the years and spread the word a about my shit.

783
00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.670
Um,
so I get to do that fucking thing.
So that's a major,

784
00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:40.650
that's not even a bucket list thing.

785
00:45:40.651 --> 00:45:44.540
That's not something I even ever even thought of ever doing.
Um,

786
00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.440
there's a couple that I want to do that I really want to do.
Um,

787
00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:50.670
<v 0>okay.</v>

788
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:54.660
<v 1>Is A,
I want to do Royal Albert Hall at some point in England.</v>

789
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.810
I got to do that one cause that's another place that Zeppelin played.

790
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.170
Although that place really seems like a tight ass place and would not let me

791
00:46:01.171 --> 00:46:05.760
bring a set of drums in during the day.
But you never know.
They might,
you know,

792
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:11.220
who knows.
Um,
anyways.
Uh,
alright.
Frank Gifford,
everybody.

793
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.080
This is the first question,
Bill.

794
00:46:13.081 --> 00:46:16.020
I'm not sure if you're going to talk about frank Giffords passing.

795
00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:19.560
Do you have a favorite Monday night football involving Gifford?
Yes.

796
00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.240
Every one that he ever did.

797
00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:23.343
<v 4>MMM.</v>

798
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.760
<v 1>And of course the person talks about,
you know,</v>

799
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:29.340
all the women that he bagged and shipped,
which is really a nerd thing to do.

800
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.340
You know,
don't pick up,
let me,
what are you gonna do it?

801
00:46:32.341 --> 00:46:36.510
You fucked a couple of stewardesses.
Who gives a shit?
So what are you,
you know,

802
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:38.340
you had all these great accomplishments.

803
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:43.350
You know that the fucking guy down at home depot can keep his dick in his pants.

804
00:46:43.351 --> 00:46:44.910
Frank,
if it's supposed to be a saint.

805
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.550
The guy lived element in almost every decade.

806
00:46:47.551 --> 00:46:50.820
I think he did a pretty good fucking job,
you know?

807
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:52.210
<v 0>Okay.</v>

808
00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:55.900
<v 1>It God can't get mad at him if there's a god.
God,</v>

809
00:46:55.901 --> 00:46:57.220
she just be throwing his hands up.
Well,

810
00:46:57.221 --> 00:46:59.320
that's what I get for making a guy that good.

811
00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.670
This is fucking great hair and be in the halfback playing in New York,

812
00:47:03.671 --> 00:47:07.750
Heisman trophy winner,
Jesus Christ.
That's what I made beautiful women for,

813
00:47:07.751 --> 00:47:11.980
for guys like this to go out and fuck.
Um,

814
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.990
the,
the God in my head,
that's how we talks.
You know,

815
00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:19.780
he doesn't get mad.
Do you think he really gets mad?

816
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.480
Like what a Hitler comes on?
He doesn't like look at himself like,
Ooh,

817
00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:25.530
fucked up on that one.

818
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:31.630
I must have made that one on Sunday when I was half asleep.
All right.

819
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.340
National Book Day,
everybody.

820
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:36.280
I'm actually getting back to that Frank Gifford thing.
Like,

821
00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:37.430
<v 4>okay.</v>

822
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:40.130
<v 1>Those guys were,
were just Frank Gifford,</v>

823
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:44.780
Don Meredith and Howard Cosell.
Those guys were absolute gods to me.

824
00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:50.120
Brian Gumbel,
uh,
Bob Costas,
Al Michaels,

825
00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:55.820
um,
Keith Jackson.
You know,

826
00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:59.720
just all those guys.
I Love Bryant Gumbel and uh,
Mike Adam Lee,

827
00:47:59.721 --> 00:48:03.710
when they used to do NFL 81,
NFL 80 and all that shit,

828
00:48:03.711 --> 00:48:04.820
they will fucking amazing.

829
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:06.510
<v 4>MMM.</v>

830
00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:12.160
<v 1>I just grew up on all of those guys.
And sportswear.
I Dunno,
it was just,</v>

831
00:48:12.161 --> 00:48:13.660
it was just different back then.

832
00:48:13.661 --> 00:48:18.250
Sports was this small fucking thing of just sports fans.

833
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:20.080
You know what I mean?

834
00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:23.950
Like the Beatles didn't play halftime at the fucking super bowl.

835
00:48:23.951 --> 00:48:28.590
They just had a high school,
God damn band went out there.
You know,

836
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.920
this,
you know,
the first two Superbowls,
they weren't called soup bowls.

837
00:48:31.921 --> 00:48:35.850
They were just called the AFL NFL NFL NFL championship game.

838
00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.190
And do you know neither one of them sold out?

839
00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:39.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

840
00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:43.290
<v 1>It's fucking unreal.
Like that's how small it was.
And he used to watch,</v>

841
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.110
I used to watch the local news every fucking night.

842
00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:50.940
He used to watch a WBZ NBC W uh,
the Wbz channel,

843
00:48:50.941 --> 00:48:53.820
which was the NBC affiliate.
Yeah.
Jack Williams,

844
00:48:53.821 --> 00:48:57.120
who just retired was as Liz Walker,
Bob Lowe Bell

845
00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.250
<v 4>and uh,</v>

846
00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:03.140
<v 1>Bob Labella do sports.
It was like six,
seven minutes.
That was it.</v>

847
00:49:03.141 --> 00:49:04.670
He had to go around the whole fucking league.

848
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:07.970
And if you really wanted to see baseball highlights from around the league,

849
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:12.380
you would watch this week in baseball or football,

850
00:49:12.381 --> 00:49:15.650
you'd watch inside the NFL on Hbo.
And that came out.

851
00:49:15.651 --> 00:49:18.670
That was fucking unreal because all the,
anything else you had to do,

852
00:49:18.671 --> 00:49:21.650
you had to wait for NFL films to come up with something.

853
00:49:21.651 --> 00:49:26.090
So it's totally changed.
So those guys were bigger than life.

854
00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.480
Who is the guy used to be on ABC's wide world of sports.

855
00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

856
00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:35.430
<v 1>God dammit.
I was into everything.
Jackie Stewart,</v>

857
00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:37.260
when he would do the formula one racing here,

858
00:49:37.261 --> 00:49:41.440
that Scottish accent I thought was so fucking cool.
Um,

859
00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:45.330
then Scully,
of course.
Um,

860
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.530
and then you had all the local guys and back then you had all those Homer's.
I,

861
00:49:48.531 --> 00:49:50.690
you know,
I hate sports fans that can't stand.

862
00:49:50.691 --> 00:49:55.691
Homer announces there's nothing better than a fucking homer announcer says the

863
00:49:56.151 --> 00:49:57.050
greatest.
Do you know,

864
00:49:57.051 --> 00:50:00.170
there was a guy used to do the Bruins in between periods and he grew a beard and

865
00:50:00.171 --> 00:50:02.960
he wouldn't in,
and he wasn't going to shave it off until we won the cup.

866
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:06.860
Sky had a fucking beard,
my whole God damn life.
And I remember when they want it.

867
00:50:06.861 --> 00:50:08.420
In 2011,
I went on the Internet,

868
00:50:08.421 --> 00:50:11.180
tried to find the guy to see if he finally fucking shaved it off.

869
00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:12.873
<v 4>MMM.</v>

870
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:17.880
<v 1>So,
uh,
yeah,
these guys,
you guys who are young,
you'll see it someday.</v>

871
00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:19.430
The people that you loved when you were a kid.

872
00:50:19.431 --> 00:50:23.600
When they get old and they pass away,
it dead.

873
00:50:23.601 --> 00:50:25.550
Kidney had fucking makes you really sad.

874
00:50:25.551 --> 00:50:27.690
But then also there's also the thing like,
man,

875
00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:33.240
a couple more generations and then it's my turn.
It
uh,

876
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.590
whatever the fuck I'm having a great life.
And if I died tomorrow,

877
00:50:37.591 --> 00:50:40.890
I had a great time.
I had a great one.
I did all right.
National Book Day.

878
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:46.080
Dear Billy Shakespeare,
of course I use that one today.

879
00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:48.930
Sunday is a national book day.
Uh,

880
00:50:48.931 --> 00:50:52.680
you have an updated us on what you're reading and quite some time any

881
00:50:52.681 --> 00:50:54.730
recommendations.
Yes,
I'm reading a,

882
00:50:54.731 --> 00:50:57.960
the Andre Agassi a biography,

883
00:50:57.961 --> 00:51:01.140
which I think is called open and a tremendous,

884
00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.570
and the reason why I also haven't been updating you on anything that had been

885
00:51:03.571 --> 00:51:06.600
readings cause I don't read that much.
Um,

886
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:09.840
I tell you my wife bought that,
uh,

887
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:12.650
she bought that Kim Kardashian Book of nothing but selfies.

888
00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:15.660
Like she's really into like pop culture.
Oh,
we had that argument about it.

889
00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:21.540
I'm still seeing that book over by the phone.
Then I always have to turn it over.

890
00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.250
I always have to turn the fucking thing over.
I just can't,
there's just,

891
00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:32.010
you want me to just walk by and you watch some girl like,
you know,
doing that.

892
00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.010
Will they hold the camera up and they're trying to adjust their fucking heads,

893
00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:40.110
you know,
to try to look better looking or this is this,

894
00:51:40.111 --> 00:51:44.900
this angle right here is the way I look the best.
You know,

895
00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:46.170
somebody should make a fucking,

896
00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:52.130
there's gotta be a thread of just videos of people fucking doing that shit.

897
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.590
Does it bill,
does it have to be something like that?

898
00:51:56.591 --> 00:52:00.280
He had to be such a crabby old content.
Um,
yeah,

899
00:52:00.281 --> 00:52:03.400
that's what I'm reading right now.
I'm reading a,
the Andre Agassi,
uh,
open.

900
00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.470
That's what I'm reading.
And uh,
it's tremendous.

901
00:52:05.471 --> 00:52:09.130
And I like reading autobiographies by people that did great things,

902
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:12.490
which is such a stupid thing to say because,
you know,

903
00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:14.050
they just have some regular guy.

904
00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:17.980
That would be an interesting autobiography if you just never fucking strived for

905
00:52:17.981 --> 00:52:22.540
anything.
You know,
we just did is you just did the bare fucking minimum.

906
00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:25.570
He lived in a one bedroom apartment.

907
00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:29.230
You always had like a six of fucking Miller high life,
you know,

908
00:52:29.231 --> 00:52:32.290
some deviled eggs in there.
That was it.

909
00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.830
You sat there and listen to baseball games on the radio and he just stared out

910
00:52:35.831 --> 00:52:39.010
the fucking window.
You know,
there is something to be said about that.

911
00:52:39.011 --> 00:52:41.580
You're not hurting anybody,
you know.

912
00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:48.520
Anyways,
you know what,
I got to find out the name,
you know,

913
00:52:48.521 --> 00:52:50.430
that time a long time ago.
I mean,
uh,

914
00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:55.860
Bobby Kelly and Joe de Rosa made that short film cheap.
We were in,

915
00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:58.570
we were in the Tribeca film festival and we did a,

916
00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:04.300
and we were with this whole series of short films and this kid,

917
00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:08.910
I've got to find out the name of his,
he made this great short film.

918
00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:12.510
I'll find it out from de Rosa and I always say that I'm going to find out that I

919
00:53:12.511 --> 00:53:15.300
never do,
but I'm going to have this time.
Um,

920
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:21.290
he made this great short film about he had an uncle or his grandfather is

921
00:53:21.291 --> 00:53:23.690
something and uh,

922
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.890
he just didn't know anything them and he lived a life like that.

923
00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:31.780
And when he died,
he found the guy's diary.
He kept a diary sort of,

924
00:53:31.781 --> 00:53:34.660
and he was able to piece together this guy's fucking life.

925
00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.530
And it was funny cause he was,
he didn't know the guy,

926
00:53:38.531 --> 00:53:41.050
but it was a really funny,

927
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.403
<v 3>mmm.</v>

928
00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:48.190
<v 1>I want to say touching,
but I don't want to you guys to trash me.
But it was,</v>

929
00:53:48.191 --> 00:53:50.200
it was,
it moved you,

930
00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:54.970
but it was really funny and I think you'll,
what the fuck was the guys in line?

931
00:53:55.990 --> 00:54:00.990
His last words on his deathbed where that you said that's it.

932
00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:11.590
And I remember saying to Derosa after we saw the film,
I go,

933
00:54:11.591 --> 00:54:14.170
what do you think he meant by that?
And Joe said,
I don't know,

934
00:54:14.171 --> 00:54:17.260
but I would give my left arm to know what he meant.

935
00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:22.170
Like who says that's it?
Like,
you know,
you're going to die.
Like what?

936
00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:25.590
What did he feel that he knew he was going to die in that moment?
I got now.
None.

937
00:54:25.591 --> 00:54:29.740
I I fucking prime the pump here.
I got to get the name of that fucking thing.

938
00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:33.070
Yeah.
You know I'm to do,
I'm going to stand my wallet up here on the table.

939
00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.330
When I look at that,
I'll be like,

940
00:54:34.331 --> 00:54:36.940
why did I stand it up there and then I'll fucking remember.
Cause if I don't,

941
00:54:36.941 --> 00:54:41.180
you have to do shit like that.
I do.
I don't give a fuck if you don't.
Um,

942
00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:45.640
all right,
Trump dear Billy elect.
I don't agree with everything Trump says,

943
00:54:45.641 --> 00:54:49.090
but I wholeheartedly believe that he's the only person that can set this country

944
00:54:49.091 --> 00:54:50.530
on a course of honesty.

945
00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:55.270
I'd rather know what a guy is actually thinking and disagree then to not know

946
00:54:55.271 --> 00:54:59.680
what he's thinking and to have to have faith.
What are your thoughts?
Um,

947
00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:04.270
says phone store girl.
Uh,
on our,
sorry.
That's the next one.
Um,

948
00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:07.930
I 100% agree.
That's why he,

949
00:55:07.931 --> 00:55:12.931
even though he said all that stupid shit about Mexicans to just,

950
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:17.050
you know,
having a white like did take about that guide.

951
00:55:17.051 --> 00:55:21.670
The shitty says about Mexicans and stuff like it's fucked up as it is.

952
00:55:21.671 --> 00:55:25.810
It's like,
that's what a white guy who's lived on the top floor of a skyscraper.

953
00:55:25.811 --> 00:55:30.200
That's,
that's the kind of shit that,
that's the way they think.
I would die.

954
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:31.940
Bender the border,
Huh?
Yeah.

955
00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:36.330
Did you fucking drive by in your air conditioned to SUV for fucking 20 minutes.

956
00:55:36.331 --> 00:55:39.680
You don't want you talking about,
I'm not trashing,

957
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:43.240
I'm not trashing the guy like took that fucking shitty said about the bankers

958
00:55:43.241 --> 00:55:44.074
again.

959
00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:47.710
I felt vindicated when he was going like when they were giving him shit for

960
00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:50.110
declaring bankruptcy and he goes,
he goes,

961
00:55:50.111 --> 00:55:53.920
I've done hundreds and hundreds of deals four times,
four times.

962
00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.860
I've taken advantage of the bankruptcy laws by the way.
They are lies.

963
00:55:56.861 --> 00:56:00.190
So he's not doing anything illegal.
And he goes,
and by the way,

964
00:56:00.191 --> 00:56:03.670
let's not make out these people that loaned me money to be these innocent little

965
00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:07.030
daisies or whatever goes.
They're not exactly innocent.
He goes,

966
00:56:07.031 --> 00:56:12.010
these guys are killers and he's 100% right.
Hundred percent fucking right.

967
00:56:12.011 --> 00:56:13.180
Having said all that,
I mean,

968
00:56:13.181 --> 00:56:17.590
that money was also put in to the bags by mom and pop people,

969
00:56:17.591 --> 00:56:20.740
but it was printed up by the bankers and it's really not our money.

970
00:56:20.741 --> 00:56:21.650
It's their money and you're,

971
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:24.890
they give it to you and your job's to get into as much debt as humanly possible

972
00:56:24.891 --> 00:56:27.950
without going under and paying those cons for the rest of your fucking life.

973
00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:28.784
They are killers.

974
00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:30.493
<v 3>MMM.</v>

975
00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:33.590
<v 2>But having said that,
there's,
there's no way</v>

976
00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:38.610
<v 1>any one person could get this country in order because what would happen is if</v>

977
00:56:38.611 --> 00:56:39.421
he got elected,

978
00:56:39.421 --> 00:56:44.280
he would threaten everybody else who got in the other way and no one would work

979
00:56:44.281 --> 00:56:45.114
with him.

980
00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:46.693
<v 3>MMM.</v>

981
00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:50.790
<v 1>In a childish way.
And then they would blame him.</v>

982
00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:53.580
And then the guys who put the money behind,

983
00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:58.530
all the politicians also own newspapers and everyone would just smear Donald

984
00:56:58.530 --> 00:56:58.980
Trump.

985
00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:03.180
And then every fucking moron who thinks they know shit about politics would be

986
00:57:03.181 --> 00:57:05.910
like,
so it doesn't work,
doesn't fucking work.

987
00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.750
It'll go right back to the way that they wanted.
Um,

988
00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:13.590
to truly change any government to truly fucking change.

989
00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:18.780
When it's his corrupt is we are,

990
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:22.170
and most of the other governments,
I'm not just shitting on my country,

991
00:57:22.171 --> 00:57:23.370
but as corrupt as we are.

992
00:57:23.371 --> 00:57:26.550
The only way to do it is you have to have literally a revolution and people are

993
00:57:26.551 --> 00:57:30.510
gonna die and people are going to go on trial and there's going to be fucking

994
00:57:30.511 --> 00:57:34.680
firing squads and all that type of shit.
You know,
you don't just go like,
Hey,

995
00:57:34.681 --> 00:57:39.200
we've had enough.
And then the people in power go,
oh,
okay.
Hi,

996
00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:42.750
here's the keys to the castle.
Let's see how you do.

997
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:47.540
<v 2>Can I have a job if it doesn't go down like that?
So,
um,</v>

998
00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:52.430
but I will say,
um,
that guy,

999
00:57:52.431 --> 00:57:57.170
he's a of Donald Trump is a fucking star.
Uh,
but I also liked,

1000
00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:02.000
there was a couple of the guys in the panel I liked,
I liked a ran Paul.

1001
00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.600
And then I liked the,
uh,
the oldest fella there.
What the fuck's his name?

1002
00:58:06.590 --> 00:58:09.590
I can't remember.
But that guy from Jersey is a fucking dope.

1003
00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:12.650
He's just smart enough to seem smart.
But at the end of the day,

1004
00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.700
a these big fucking roast beef head.
He's a,
he's a fucking dope.

1005
00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:21.260
That guy should not go beyond the state level,
but he will.
He will.

1006
00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:24.410
Um,
all right.
Phone store girl.

1007
00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:25.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1008
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:30.320
<v 2>All right.
Billy boy.
Last week my girlfriend lent her cell phone.</v>

1009
00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:33.723
Oh,
what to you?

1010
00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:34.700
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1011
00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:38.620
<v 2>Last week my girl lent her cell phone because mine,
Shit,
the bed.
You,</v>

1012
00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.840
you missed a word there.
Lent me her cell phone.
Okay.

1013
00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.740
I borrowed a phone on the way to get,
oh Jesus.
Oh God.
Here we go.

1014
00:58:45.741 --> 00:58:49.380
I borrowed her phone and the way to get my new phone because I had some work

1015
00:58:49.381 --> 00:58:51.350
calls to make as it left the house.

1016
00:58:51.351 --> 00:58:53.540
I thought it was strange because it felt like,

1017
00:58:55.110 --> 00:58:57.630
because it felt like we would be breaking up soon.

1018
00:58:57.990 --> 00:59:01.230
I get to the place and a young cute chick is working there.

1019
00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:06.530
I ended up getting paired with her over the other miserable looking losers

1020
00:59:06.601 --> 00:59:09.000
working there.
Wow.
I thought this has got to go another direction.

1021
00:59:09.001 --> 00:59:11.610
I think he would say you went there and then she got some fucked up text.

1022
00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.110
All right,
here we go.

1023
00:59:13.111 --> 00:59:16.980
At one point I had to hand her my girlfriend's phone because I had taken a

1024
00:59:16.981 --> 00:59:20.310
picture of a number I needed to activate my new phone.

1025
00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:24.730
When the girl slid the picture slid the picture over by accident.
Yup.

1026
00:59:24.731 --> 00:59:28.030
You guessed it.
A picture of my girlfriend topless.

1027
00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:31.600
The girl's swipe back immediately and I just stood there.

1028
00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:36.430
I actually didn't even really react much,
just kind of took it all in.

1029
00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:39.220
She looked at me and goes,
good for you.

1030
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:45.920
Oh Jesus.
This girl's a Gamer that broke the ice.
This girl was very cool.
Yeah.

1031
00:59:45.921 --> 00:59:50.000
Yeah.
Think we joked around before and after the end.
After this incident.

1032
00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.280
All right,
this is what you need to do.

1033
00:59:52.281 --> 00:59:56.090
Break up with this other girl immediately cause you already said you feel like

1034
00:59:56.091 --> 00:59:58.540
you're going to break up and get out.
Seem upset by it,

1035
00:59:58.541 --> 01:00:02.550
which means you don't like this girl,
you know lover.
I should say.

1036
01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:07.100
Maybe you love her,
but not that way.
Dumper and get with this girl.
All right,

1037
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:12.410
and see where this fucking goes and hold back your heart though for a minute.

1038
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:15.880
This girl might be a fucking killer toe.
She might be a,
uh,

1039
01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.190
a study on the other side of the fence since she's gonna fucking break your

1040
01:00:19.191 --> 01:00:22.670
heart.
So just,
uh,
see where it goes.

1041
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:25.520
I'm already saying that before I get to the end of this.
Anyways,
he goes,

1042
01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:28.580
I get in the car and I realize I haven't seen the picture of my girlfriend.

1043
01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:30.090
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1044
01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:31.290
<v 2>She never sent it to me.</v>

1045
01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:34.530
Perhaps she didn't like it or perhaps it was for someone else.

1046
01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:36.990
What the fuck just happened?

1047
01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.053
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1048
01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.820
<v 2>Wait a minute.
You guessed it.</v>

1049
01:00:43.821 --> 01:00:47.180
A picture of my girlfriend topless to girls swiped back immediately and I just

1050
01:00:47.181 --> 01:00:50.480
stood there,
took it all in.
She said,
good for you.
That broke the ice.

1051
01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:53.750
We kind of joked around before and after the senses I get in the car and I

1052
01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:58.160
realized I haven't seen the picture of my girlfriend.
She never sent it to me.
Oh.

1053
01:00:58.161 --> 01:01:01.820
Cause it was on her phone.
Oh wait.

1054
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:07.560
She sent it to somebody else.
Do this is like a great movie.
Perhaps she did.
