1
00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.570
Okay.

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.950
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.503
<v 2>Wow.</v>

4
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.110
<v 1>What's going on?
It's bill burr is some Monday morning podcast.</v>

5
00:00:09.111 --> 00:00:13.330
So Monday,
February 6th,

6
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.070
2017 I'm doing it right after the Superbowl.
Um,

7
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.960
just cause I got the little one now and she's going to keep me up all night.

8
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.200
So I knew there was no way is everybody texted me right now.

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.233
<v 0>MMM.</v>

10
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.320
<v 1>I'm speechless.
Something you never hear from me.
I'm always running my mouth.</v>

11
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.570
I am absolutely speechless.
Speechless.

12
00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:37.130
I cannot believe we came back and won that game.
I'm not going to be that guy.

13
00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:41.600
God Dude,
I knew it.
I was like,
I had this feeling right.

14
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.580
I said this,
I didn't,
I had my fucking head in the oven at halftime.

15
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.030
We were so getting our ass kicked at like 21 to nothing when Brady threw a pick

16
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:56.270
six.
I have this theory at the NFL level that if you throw a pick six,

17
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.940
you don't win the game.
The too fucking good.

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.300
It's the most devastating fucking play.
Literally.
You know?

19
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.980
So I saw him one time at NFL films.

20
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.390
One of the players said that you are trying to score not only these other teams

21
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:12.360
stop you,
they turn around and score on that fucking play.
It's like,
I,

22
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.840
I can't believe it.
21,

23
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:19.820
three then was 28 to three.
I wasn't even like a,

24
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.080
I actually texted us somebody going like,

25
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:26.010
this is the longest fucking loss I've ever watched in my life.
I'm like,

26
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:30.990
this is just slowly going to,
what is this going to end up being like 35,

27
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.550
10 and they gonna bring that dare fucking bench in.
Um,

28
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.070
I had completely mentally thrown in the towel and I was just sitting here.

29
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.290
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.520
<v 1>Um,
you know,
and I couldn't scream and yell,
you know,</v>

31
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:45.300
I've got my girl now and it's just,
it's hilarious.
I'm just sitting here going,

32
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:48.870
well,
if she's keeping me calm,
but there was so kicking our ass,

33
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.270
I couldn't even get upset.

34
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.953
<v 0>MMM.</v>

35
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.960
<v 1>And if you watched,
when I was promoting,
uh,
my special,</v>

36
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.020
and when people would ask me about the game I was,

37
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.130
I was not comfortable at all.
And you know,
I went from like,

38
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:06.620
not even believing in Atlanta against Seattle,

39
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:09.770
picking against them again when they played green bay.

40
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.500
And I was just,
after I saw the way they played,
I was like,

41
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:19.130
man,
they got,
they got a great running back.
They got Julio Jones,

42
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.190
Matt Ryan seems dialed in,
all that shit that I sent.

43
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:24.290
And then right before the super bowl,
they're like,
dude,

44
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.980
they don't have one running back.
They got to,
they got that Coleman guy too.

45
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.070
So I was like,
fuck this.
I Dunno.
I just had,
I had that fucking,

46
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.520
you know that feeling you have when you get,
you think your team's going to lose,

47
00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:39.150
but you,
you,
you don't want to say it.
That's why I was saying everybody,
uh,

48
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:43.480
on those shows going like,
you know,
I'd bet the under,
um,

49
00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:46.840
which didn't come in and I said I would like the falcons getting,

50
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.040
if I could get five.

51
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.000
I think that I wasn't comfortable taking the Patriots given points.

52
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.383
<v 0>MMM.</v>

53
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.630
<v 1>So I can't say I called it on any fucking level.
I didn't.</v>

54
00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:02.500
I am absolutely fucking speechless.
I can't believe it.
I just cannot believe it.

55
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.470
And uh,
I've never said this before,
but I think I can finally say it.

56
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:07.300
I think Tom Brady's the greatest of all time.

57
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.710
I always gave the nod to Montana because he went to four.

58
00:03:12.711 --> 00:03:16.030
It took him four trips to win four.
But even then,

59
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:20.440
it's always up for debate because what if Montana had Bella check what you have

60
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:24.850
is the greatest head coach in arguably,
arguably the greatest,
if not now,

61
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.580
five rings.
It's a great argument.

62
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:31.570
The greatest fucking quarterback of all fucking time,
you know,
playing together.

63
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:33.810
I can't,
I cannot fucking believe it.
I can't,
I,

64
00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:36.350
and I didn't have any emotion the whole game.
I just,

65
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.960
cause we just so fucking losing.

66
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.250
So I was just sitting there and then as we move slowly,
I wasn't,

67
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:45.140
I wasn't even call saying that we were coming back.
I was la.

68
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.700
Maybe they'll make it a little respectable.
I don't know.
All right.
You know,

69
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:52.330
maybe we just lose by 10 and then,
you know,

70
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.790
we scored that first two point conversion.

71
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.310
Even then when we were going down the field,
I'm like,
what are the odds?

72
00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:58.990
We're going to get another fucking two point conversion.

73
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:03.330
We fucking missed a field goal.
We fucking screwed up.
And,
uh,
the,
uh,

74
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.170
the,
the,

75
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.820
the onside kick and I'm to the greatest Superbowl catches I've seen since the

76
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:12.880
helmet catch,
uh,
was Julio Jones,

77
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:17.140
Jesus Christ and what a fucking throw Matt Ryan was also running when he made

78
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:20.830
that throw.
I was like,
oh my God,
every fucking Superbowl now,

79
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.320
every Superbowl that there's that fucking ghost of [inaudible].
It is an Eli.

80
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:28.660
It's like the ghost of Eli fucking throw.

81
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.790
And for once we had a Edelman,
we had a circus catch back.
And,
um,

82
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.110
I dunno,
I,
I'm absolutely stunned.
And having said all that,

83
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.980
my condolences to the Atlanta Falcons fans.
I got no beef with you guys.

84
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:46.410
And I've been there plenty of fucking times.
Um,

85
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.630
certainly for the first,
you know,
36 years of my life,

86
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:53.230
if there was a fucking way to choke away a Goddamn game,

87
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:56.560
I saw a Boston team do it.
And for whatever fucking reason,

88
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.000
I don't know why this is happening.

89
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:01.960
I don't know why it's happened this fucking long,
just trying to enjoy it.

90
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.450
He says how spoiled Boston fans are.

91
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.530
My daughter's two weeks old and she's already seen her first Boston title.

92
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.700
It's fucking unbelievable.
And,
um,

93
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.440
I got a big kick out of Bill Maher trash the Patriots.
At first I thought it was,

94
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:24.010
he just trashing,
see talking sports.
That's like me talking politics.

95
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:26.460
This guy's getting outside of his lane.
But then I saw he was man,

96
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.280
I guess he was mad cause uh,
you know,
Brady and I guess somebody else.

97
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.260
I don't pay attention to all those fucking soap opera shit.

98
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:36.250
I guess they're like Trump supporters.
And I heard on the radio that,
you know,

99
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.030
I dunno Brady did or didn't go when Obama was there.
I don't fucking know.

100
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:43.630
So this,
this,
if the Patriots are,
aren't at the height of their hatred,

101
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:46.110
if he shows up now,
if he didn't go to the,
Oh,

102
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.580
the Obama thing and then shows up at the Trump thing,

103
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:53.410
that's going to be a complete shit show.
But they seem to thrive being hated.

104
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.410
So what a fucking season starts off with that fucking horse shit.

105
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.990
The biggest,
uh,

106
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.330
the as like witch hunt I've ever seen in my life,

107
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:09.860
that stupid fucking deflate gate thing and just all the justice that came out of

108
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:14.030
it,
the fact that it went to court,
it got laughed out of court to the point.

109
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:15.740
The judge was actually pissed.

110
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.420
Then they finally get the fucking thing.
They just,
I don't know,
they just,

111
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.660
oh well does,
we're a corporation.
We have a right to suspend our employee.

112
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:26.540
Yes you do.
He's our employee.
You're fucking suspended.

113
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.750
So then he sits there for fucking games and I just started thinking,

114
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:31.970
well five games in,

115
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:35.480
we have a rested pissed off Tom Brady without those fucking miles.

116
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:39.320
Maybe that'll be a good thing.
And just how poetic was the whole thing?

117
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.160
Do you know that line back from Indianapolis?

118
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.340
So I don't have any fucking beef with,

119
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:44.780
cause he said he didn't want to be in the middle of it,

120
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.860
but the linebacker who caught the ball that he brought to the sideline as a

121
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:53.690
souvenir,
um,
that touched off the whole deflate gate thing.

122
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:57.380
He tested positive for steroids and you got a four game suspension.

123
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.850
It's funny how we,
ESPN really didn't do,
you know,

124
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.490
you'd think they'd still be talking about that.
Yep.
Never happened.
You know?
Um,

125
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:05.390
and I also thought it was funny,

126
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:08.300
Bill mark called this cheaters as we're playing the Atlanta Falcons who got

127
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:11.330
busted pumping fucking crowd noise in,
but that's okay.
It's okay.

128
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.590
Who gives a fuck?
You know an NBA when they go,
you know,
on basketball they go,

129
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:18.860
the ball don't lie.
That's when I feel like just fucking happened.

130
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.280
After all of that shit vindication,
he comes back and he wins it.

131
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.450
And then Roger Goodell like,
like the end of a fucking diehard movie,

132
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.170
the police commissioner who didn't fucking believe in the rogue cop has to come

133
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:35.120
in and finally give in and be like,
you know what?
You are a good cup.

134
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.210
Here's your gun and your badge back.
Right?

135
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.450
Brady sitting there with his fucking dirty fucking wife Beater on

136
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.270
Jesus Christ and I will never fucking ever tell him you don't.

137
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:51.500
Keith Robinson called it.
I'm going to find the fucking text message.

138
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:54.290
I'm going to read you some of these fucks in texts right now because I hate when

139
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:58.700
fucking people fucking quit,
you know,
and then they don't admit to it.

140
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.230
I did.
I was like this,
this game is fucking over.
They're younger,
they're faster.

141
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.760
And then we,
we get a break in the game,
then they get a fucking big sack.
I mean,

142
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:12.380
there are really,
really good team.
Um,
hang on,
let me find this fucking thing.

143
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.320
I had a buddy of mine,
he texts me at halftime.

144
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:17.840
He said I took Atlanta and the under and I was like,
great bed.

145
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.600
I didn't hear from till after the overtime and then he texts me,

146
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.500
he just texts fixed.
Um,

147
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.200
all right.
Oh my God.
I felt so bad for fucking Atlanta's owner.

148
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.880
He seems like such a great guy,
you know,
and you know,

149
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.190
he looks like fucking grandpa monster and he made the fucking Cherry Jones.

150
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.180
Did Jerry Jones move?
You come down on the field before you put the game away.

151
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.320
Then he had to stand there.

152
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.660
You just see when he had that glum look on his face and his,

153
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.910
I don't know what it,
you know,
you never know what those super rich guys,

154
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:49.010
it's like,
is that your daughter or your fucking third wife?

155
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.640
Whoever the fuck that was with them just sort of glanced down.
I'm like Oh God,

156
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.150
he's going to be hitting the bottle.
That poor bastard.
Um,
all right.
Where are,

157
00:08:58.151 --> 00:09:00.540
where is it?
Uh,

158
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:01.630
<v 0>okay,</v>

159
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:02.650
<v 1>what did I say here?</v>

160
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:04.230
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

161
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:09.120
<v 1>Okay.
So first text I sent at 4:55 PM Pacific coast time.</v>

162
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.490
Have I ever told you might pick six rule.

163
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.000
If you throw a pick six during the NFL game,
you lose.

164
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.400
Not to mention we are down 21 nothing.

165
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.520
I bet the under its 59 the pate,

166
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.750
if the Patriots don't start playing defense to Falcons,
we'll score 60 lol.

167
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.650
He writes how hard the falcons give up a lead all the time.

168
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.680
He said that at 21 nothing.

169
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.520
This is Keith Robinson while now say the great Keith Robinson,
Tom Brady,

170
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.290
the greatest of all time.
Keith Robinson.
He's the Greg Keith Robinson.
All right.

171
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:40.861
Then I wrote,

172
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:44.070
we look like shit against the Texans and the Steelers weren't that tough.

173
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.850
<v 0>Uh,</v>

174
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.950
<v 1>okay.
Six,
19:00 PM this loss is taking forever.</v>

175
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.600
I had no belief.
Um,
you know,

176
00:09:55.601 --> 00:09:59.260
Glenn close in the natural when she stands up and he looks into the stands.
If,

177
00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.520
if,
uh,
let's say me and Robert Redford had an alternative lifestyle relationship,

178
00:10:03.521 --> 00:10:05.560
when he looked up in the stance,
I would have been gone.

179
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:11.700
What does seeing the back of my head walking out of the fucking stadium,
um,

180
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.250
he goes,
they can still come back.
And I just,
I just laughed.

181
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.790
I laughed at him and I just said,
they are younger and faster.

182
00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:23.930
AFC was weak and then there's no more texts for a while.
They writes back,

183
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.430
told you,
and then I wrote,
right,
you might be right.
Uh,
then I wrote,

184
00:10:28.431 --> 00:10:31.490
that's one of the best catches I've ever seen.
That was a,
the Julio Jones.

185
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.360
And then I wrote this grandpa monster on the falcons since when he was down on

186
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:38.300
the thing.
And then after that he was just calling me up and he just kept saying,

187
00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:42.680
this is what Atlanta does.
And I was like,

188
00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.040
you're right.
You're absolutely right.
I don't know,
but you know,

189
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.990
<v 0>okay.</v>

190
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:49.850
<v 1>I sat and watched the whole fucking thing.</v>

191
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.780
Thank God I didn't turn on some Mary Tyler Moore tribute.
By the way.

192
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.240
God rest her soul.
One of my favorites of all time.

193
00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:57.783
<v 0>MMM.</v>

194
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.570
<v 1>I cannot fucking believe it.
I cannot fuck him.
I just sat here.</v>

195
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.943
<v 0>MMM.</v>

196
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.390
<v 1>I just accepting defeat going like,
oh well,
you know,</v>

197
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.210
we'll see what the fuck I can't,
I can't fucking believe it.
I can't believe it.

198
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.440
So there you go.
Five fucking rings,
Tom Brady,

199
00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:19.190
the greatest of all time.
And uh,
once again,
I always have to say this,

200
00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:23.300
cause I fucking,
I went to that Green Bay packers,
a patriots' Superbowl,

201
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.090
you know Jesus Christ.
I watched the fucking,

202
00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:29.240
when the first year I watch the red sox was 1978.
Bucky Dent.

203
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.000
I still remember my mother's face and the kitchen

204
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.600
came in and I was like,
mom,
is there another game tomorrow?

205
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.960
She just looked over at me and didn't say anything.
She just shook her head,

206
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:45.800
shook it now.

207
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.980
Oh fuck.
Anyways.
Um,
all right.

208
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:58.330
Enough of that.
I don't even know what else to fucking talk about.
Um,

209
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.290
I got uh,
Oh,
you know what?
I did the ice house this weekend.

210
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.780
It was the first time.
It was great to see the bushes,
by the way,

211
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:07.660
cause I know that they were in the fucking the hospital,
whatever.

212
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.290
Regardless of your politics guys,
a war hero,

213
00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:14.920
you don't want to see somebody fucking,
I mean,
I guess your die at some point,

214
00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:17.740
right.
You know,
it took a lot of balls from to go out there.
You know,

215
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.940
I want it done that.
You know what I mean?
I get to my,
those fucking years.

216
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.570
You fucking wheeling me around and Shit it bill,
you want to throw the coin?

217
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.690
You know you want to fucking flip the coin in the beginning of the super bowl.

218
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:30.820
You out of your fucking mind.

219
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:32.890
I want to go out in public and throw a coin in a fun.

220
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.840
When people see me like this

221
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.870
blood pressure going through the fucking roof.
Um,

222
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:42.820
<v 4>okay.</v>

223
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.560
<v 1>Oh fuck.
Now the showing the highlights,
you know,</v>

224
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.460
you know what I really officially thought the game was over was when we called

225
00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:51.480
that fucking trick play in Atlanta.
It didn't even,
they didn't even,

226
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.760
they covered that too.
And I'm just like,
these guys are just fucking dialed in.

227
00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:00.580
Um,
anyways.
Uh,
yeah.

228
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:05.530
So I did the ice house this weekend and everything I talk about after this is

229
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:07.210
going to fucking pale in comparison.

230
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.910
The four Boston teams have won in,

231
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.560
in this century 10 fucking titles,
Dude.

232
00:13:16.561 --> 00:13:19.410
Rappaport's hilarious.
He fucking text me before the game.

233
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:20.840
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

234
00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.540
<v 1>He goes,
hey,
if you guys lose today,
you know,</v>

235
00:13:23.541 --> 00:13:27.530
I'm calling you and you better take my call.
And I said,
Oh yeah.
I go,

236
00:13:27.531 --> 00:13:30.320
what if the Patriots win?
Am I going to hear from you?
And he said,
no,

237
00:13:30.321 --> 00:13:31.154
I'll be at temple.

238
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:39.900
So at halftime I got my fucking head in the oven muttering to myself just

239
00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:44.200
walking around.
I can't,
I'm not watching the lady,
God,
God Dang.

240
00:13:44.201 --> 00:13:46.440
I thought she did a great job,
but I got,
I got it.

241
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.680
I always get nervous when somebody is coming down on those fucking wire things

242
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.340
that basically look like crazy straws that you straightened out.

243
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.070
I always feel like it at some point,
one of those things,

244
00:13:57.071 --> 00:14:00.590
it's going to snap and somebody is going to fall to their fucking death.
You,
you,

245
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.290
there's no fucking Gig in the world worth doing that.

246
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.650
The people who fucking do that,
uh,
the,
the level of faith that they have,

247
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.440
there's no fucking way I would do that.
But anyways,

248
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.640
so I'm out there model and modern in the kitchen trying to think what,

249
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.500
how the fuck I'm going to graciously congratulate the Atlanta fans,

250
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:20.951
you know,

251
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:23.500
and the amount of shit and I'm looking at my Twitter and all these fucking

252
00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:26.200
Atlanta fans.
Where are you Billy boy?
Hey,
they're freckles.

253
00:14:26.201 --> 00:14:30.470
You'd been all quiet and I'm just muttering in the kitchen to myself,
you know,

254
00:14:30.471 --> 00:14:31.580
it was lady Gaga is on it.

255
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.623
<v 5>Okay.</v>

256
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.110
<v 1>Right.
Um,
I guess my kid kept me calm.</v>

257
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:43.280
I just walked in as pissed as I wasn't pissed.
I was just fucking,
I was,
I was,

258
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.020
I almost said deflated.
How funny is that?

259
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.700
I was,
yeah,
I was just fucking,
I was depressed.

260
00:14:53.701 --> 00:14:56.220
I was like,
oh my God.
I mean Jesus,
it's one thing to lose,

261
00:14:56.221 --> 00:15:01.020
but you just get your fucking ass kick.
So I'm out there and uh,

262
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.130
I mean,
what the fuck?
I was thinking what the fuck was even talking about?

263
00:15:05.131 --> 00:15:06.870
You know what it is?
I'm watching these goddamn highlights.

264
00:15:06.871 --> 00:15:10.010
I'm still trying to figure out how the fuck we came back.
Um,
alright.

265
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.070
Tell enough already or not.
If we get it,
your team won a fucking Superbowl.

266
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.410
So anyways,
oh yeah.

267
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.310
What about that commercial during the Superbowl with that new fucking thing from

268
00:15:20.311 --> 00:15:22.590
Google,
that little speaker in your house,

269
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.050
you sitting there talking to your kid,

270
00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:30.370
reading it a story and it's fucking looking over your shoulder and then you just

271
00:15:30.371 --> 00:15:33.010
go,
hey,
go,
go low.
What noise does a whale make?
And it's like,

272
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.440
and then you laugh with your daughter.

273
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.640
Look at what point does the dad turned around?
Like,
Hey Google,

274
00:15:39.641 --> 00:15:41.740
you fucking listening to all of this shit creep,

275
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.990
right people please for the love of fucking God,

276
00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.700
for the love of God.
Do not bring that thing into your house.

277
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.930
<v 4>Okay?</v>

278
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.870
<v 1>Okay.
That's the modern day version of bringing like,
I don't know,</v>

279
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.110
a vampire or whatever.
I don't even know what it is.

280
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.510
Why?
Why?

281
00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:07.650
Why are people so fucking stupid when it comes to their own privacy?

282
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.250
<v 4>Okay.</v>

283
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.860
<v 1>That thing is just on.
What is it doing that's a listening.</v>

284
00:16:13.861 --> 00:16:17.880
You're literally bugging your own house.
I don't know.

285
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.900
I did the Joe Rogan podcast and he said the most depressing fucking thing.

286
00:16:21.901 --> 00:16:23.130
He said they're making

287
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.470
<v 4>okay.</v>

288
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:28.130
<v 1>Like cameras to size of grains of sand and they're just going to spread them</v>

289
00:16:28.131 --> 00:16:29.630
around like every fucking street.

290
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.830
So I told him I'd walk down the street with like a leaf blower.

291
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:35.260
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

292
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.190
<v 1>It just going to be everywhere.</v>

293
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.460
Everything's going to be filmed and it's just like that.

294
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.080
<v 4>Okay.</v>

295
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.320
<v 1>Big Brother Shit.
And it's just that book.
It's literally going to be,
well,</v>

296
00:16:44.321 --> 00:16:48.760
if you're not doing anything wrong,
I don't know what happened,
Bill,

297
00:16:48.761 --> 00:16:49.760
your team won a Superbowl.

298
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:54.370
Now you're going to fucking depress everybody anyways or the upside here.

299
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:55.720
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

300
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.950
<v 1>I went to,
um,</v>

301
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.010
<v 4>okay.</v>

302
00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:02.140
<v 1>I went to the ice house this weekend.
I did two shows and uh,
you know,</v>

303
00:17:02.141 --> 00:17:05.540
my special came out.
People really seem to be liking it.
Thank God.
Although,

304
00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:07.910
you know,
I did get some shit.
Anytime you talk politics,

305
00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:12.410
I got a lot of shift from a Trump fans and a Hillary fans,

306
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.980
you know,
they always start with the,
you know,
that wasn't funny.

307
00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.520
What happened to you,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I,
I've,
I've,
I don't know,

308
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.560
I've been around long enough to know like,
okay,
what was it was the,

309
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:27.700
was it the Trump fucking wall?
Joko?
Was it the fucking

310
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.000
<v 4>okay,</v>

311
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.290
<v 1>Hillary's pure evil,
whatever the fuck I said.
Um,
but anyways,</v>

312
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:37.850
I did two shows working out there with Joe Bart,
nick,
and uh,

313
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:42.460
Jimmy Burns and
I did an hour,
both shows.

314
00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:45.490
I was surprised.
I was really nervous because I thought with um,

315
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.860
having my daughter and everything,
um,
that like,
you know,

316
00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:53.800
I hadn't been going out to the clubs and we waited so long for her to come and

317
00:17:53.801 --> 00:17:56.140
everything.
I was just really nervous about where my act was going to be.

318
00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:59.140
So here's the deal,
everybody,
I'm going to the comedy zone.

319
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.630
I think it's already sold out in a Charlotte and uh,
I'm going to be working,

320
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.160
I'm going to be doing some clubs here over the next month or so,
uh,

321
00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:13.540
two months maybe we'll figure it out once I get literally get my act together

322
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.030
and I'm going to try to build up this new hour.
But I was really psyched like,

323
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.931
and then what happened?

324
00:18:20.931 --> 00:18:25.360
I went up there and I just was got into a good flow and a bunch of shit that

325
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.250
never said came out and then there was a bunch of shit that I,

326
00:18:28.251 --> 00:18:32.000
I kind of just left behind that kind of came back and I never put it on a

327
00:18:32.001 --> 00:18:33.310
special,
at least I didn't.

328
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:38.770
I always have a paranoia about that because once I do a special at once,

329
00:18:38.771 --> 00:18:40.480
I'd done editing and I never watch it again.

330
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.300
Like why the fuck would you sit there and watch your ship?

331
00:18:43.301 --> 00:18:47.330
What happens is I end up forgetting what the fuck I did from special does

332
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.790
special.
So there's always that danger.

333
00:18:48.791 --> 00:18:53.791
I might fucking repeat something or grab a punchline from something else.

334
00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.320
Um,
you know,

335
00:18:56.321 --> 00:18:59.800
God knows I've made every fucking mistake there is to make as a comic.
So,
um,

336
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.830
I was very happy about that and I want to thank every the ice house for letting

337
00:19:02.831 --> 00:19:05.780
me come out that way.
And um,

338
00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.173
<v 4>okay.</v>

339
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:08.930
<v 1>I Dunno.</v>

340
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.460
Oh and then we missed that fucking field goal and watch the highlights right
now.

341
00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:12.420
I've got to shut this off.

342
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.520
I gotta shut this off for this podcast is going to suck.

343
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.390
Probably is very suck for people.
You know I had no idea.
Fucking Atlanta.

344
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.430
Atlanta only one,
one fucking title.

345
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.970
It's entire sports' existence.

346
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:27.240
<v 4>Okay.</v>

347
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.040
<v 1>I thought the Saint Louis Hawks.</v>

348
00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:30.720
<v 4>Okay.</v>

349
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.010
<v 1>I thought they won a title.
So though.</v>

350
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.480
<v 4>Okay.</v>

351
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.620
<v 1>You know what I gotta look that up.</v>

352
00:19:35.621 --> 00:19:38.020
Cause that's a great way to give fucking Laker fan shit.

353
00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:43.510
You know if the Saint Louis Hawks actually won a fucking title.
Okay.

354
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.040
<v 4>Okay.</v>

355
00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.880
<v 1>This is some Bill Simmons Shit here.
The St Lou.</v>

356
00:19:47.881 --> 00:19:50.100
I'm gonna hit pause cause I don't want you guys fucking city alone.

357
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.550
Who gives a shit?
The Saint Louis Hawks and off they fucking won a title.

358
00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:59.710
They want to fucking title and Atlanta doesn't caught caught counted how the
fuck

359
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:05.730
de la Los Angeles Lakers fans count Minneapolis Lakers titles and that other

360
00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:09.360
title that they haven't that they wanted like the NBL or some shit as an NBA

361
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:10.194
title.

362
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:15.350
A NBA Saint Louis Hawks and be a title.

363
00:20:15.811 --> 00:20:17.340
I want to say they won one

364
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.440
1958 team coach when Saint Louis Hawks.

365
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.170
Well I thought we'd beat the hawks.
I know the Celtics beat him

366
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.290
cause that was at trivia question last time.

367
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:35.800
<v 4>Okay.</v>

368
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.200
<v 1>Saint Louis lost the Superbowl.</v>

369
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.110
They lost to the Patriots last time you lost a Stanley Cup final was to the

370
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:44.020
Boston Bruins last time.
The last two world series was to the Boston red sox.

371
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:49.030
Last Times they lost to the an NBA title.
The Saint Louis Hawks lost to the,

372
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:52.960
uh,
to the Boston Celtics,

373
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:56.550
but it says here in 1958 they won though.
Saint Louis Hawks say one.
Okay.

374
00:20:56.551 --> 00:21:00.730
So they one,
the 1958 fucking NBA finals,

375
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.460
they won.
All right.

376
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:07.750
And fucking Atlanta doesn't count that.

377
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:15.220
Let me make sure I say this right.
Saint Louis Winds,
Boston,
St Louis,
Boston,

378
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:17.620
St Louis.
St Louis.
Yeah.
They wanted six games.

379
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.430
Hawks when series six game Atlanta doesn't count that title.
See,

380
00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:25.810
that's why la is stuff.
They're the fucking worst with that shit.
You don't,

381
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:29.980
having said that,
I totally respect the lake of franchise,
but nobody,
nobody pads,

382
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:34.810
they're fucking stats like them because it was just this game.
The Celtics had,

383
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:35.980
I believe it was Friday night,

384
00:21:35.981 --> 00:21:37.930
we played the Lakers and they rebuild it and everything.

385
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:40.000
So it wasn't really like a Celtic Laker thing.
Uh,

386
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.760
it always sucks from the Celtics and Lakers play each other and we're not,

387
00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.590
you know,
if one team is good,
the other sucks.

388
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.500
It's not fun winning or losing those games.
It's just like,
all right,

389
00:21:49.501 --> 00:21:53.610
whatever this teams we're rebuilding or we're,
we're rebuilding.
But,
um,

390
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.170
so interestingly enough,
at that point,
all time,

391
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.750
the most regular season wins.

392
00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:01.980
<v 4>Okay.</v>

393
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.180
<v 1>The Lakers and Celtics were tied after all like 60 fucking years,</v>

394
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.940
like 3,200 something wins a piece.

395
00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.760
And whoever won that game night that night would go up by one.

396
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.040
You know what I mean?
So basically we went ahead.

397
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.330
They probably were ahead in the beginning in Minneapolis with George,
Mike and,

398
00:22:17.331 --> 00:22:18.164
and all those guys.

399
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.560
We got ahead in the sixties and seventies was kind of a push in the 80s,

400
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.390
but in the 90s,
in the,

401
00:22:24.391 --> 00:22:27.960
in the two thousands where we just had a rough time and they had those,

402
00:22:27.961 --> 00:22:32.160
the Colby era,
Colby shack and all those other fucking guys,
um,

403
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.090
they must have caught up.

404
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.950
I can't imagine how many games they picked up on us during those times until,
uh,

405
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.840
you know,
we took a page out of their book and bought a title in 2008.
Um,

406
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:49.780
so,
uh,
anyways,
we played each other and uh,

407
00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.020
and I remember they were showing the stats that always bugs me that they say

408
00:22:53.021 --> 00:22:57.160
that they have the Los Angeles Lakers have 16 titles eating.

409
00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.410
If you say the franchise,
it just bugs the shit out of me.

410
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.960
Really build doesn't really bug you when you're fucking team just won a

411
00:23:04.961 --> 00:23:08.440
Superbowl.
Yeah,
I guess not really.
Not really.
Anybody watched the fucking Bruins,

412
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.400
a maple leafs game.
I have all the sports packages this point.

413
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:15.290
I just sit here with my daughter on my chest and I just sit there and I watch

414
00:23:15.291 --> 00:23:18.370
the Games when my wife sleeps downstairs and when she cries,

415
00:23:18.371 --> 00:23:22.240
I go downstairs and I just changed the diaper and she keeps crying.

416
00:23:22.241 --> 00:23:27.040
That means she's hungry.
It's really kind of easy the first three months.
And um,

417
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:32.250
it sucks having to get up every like hour and eight minutes roughly at night.

418
00:23:32.861 --> 00:23:37.150
But I just,
um,
I dunno,
I just go into this fucking mindset.

419
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.010
She just bumps me and then I wake up and I just go,
daddy daycare.

420
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:46.890
I make a little joke and I'd get up and my fucking Achilles are so fucking

421
00:23:47.031 --> 00:23:47.420
tight.

422
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.200
Like there's something happens when you get old and I stretch all the fucking

423
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:55.880
time.
Can I stretch all the fucking time?
And um,

424
00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:59.010
I don't know if you guys,
if you're an old fucking,
maybe this is,

425
00:23:59.011 --> 00:24:01.440
I don't know if this is an old guy in old white guy,

426
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.880
an old red bald white guy thing,
but I will lay on the fucking couch.

427
00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.820
I swear to God,
I swear to God,
I laid on that couch.

428
00:24:08.821 --> 00:24:11.700
I will lay on a couch for like fucking 12 minutes

429
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.120
and if I go up,
get up to go to the fucking refrigerator,

430
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:19.110
it's like the first step.
I've taken an eight hours.

431
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.910
I have to like literally stop drives me up the wall.
I don't know.

432
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.970
I don't know what it is and I,
and fucking,

433
00:24:26.971 --> 00:24:29.490
no matter how much down dog stretch I do,

434
00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.780
it just doesn't seem to be working out.
So if you have that fucking problem,

435
00:24:33.781 --> 00:24:38.520
here's a great stretch case.
Some old guy shit before I even get out of bed now.

436
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:40.163
<v 4>Okay.</v>

437
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.250
<v 1>Except now that I have a daughter,</v>

438
00:24:41.251 --> 00:24:45.450
I just made me the lead jump up because I don't want to do it.
And I know if I,

439
00:24:45.451 --> 00:24:50.220
if I even contemplate,
you know,
laying there,
I'm going to,

440
00:24:50.221 --> 00:24:52.470
I'm going to fall back asleep so I have to immediately jump up.

441
00:24:52.471 --> 00:24:56.460
But like what I used to do before being a dad,

442
00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.860
um,
is uh,
I've just put your point,

443
00:25:01.861 --> 00:25:03.480
your toes [inaudible] niece.

444
00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.280
Just do that for like 10 seconds and then point them the other way for like 10

445
00:25:08.281 --> 00:25:12.960
seconds and then do clockwise and counterclockwise and then you can get out of

446
00:25:12.961 --> 00:25:16.320
bed and for all you young consult,
they laughing at me right now.

447
00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.870
Just remember this in 20 years.
Okay.

448
00:25:18.871 --> 00:25:23.070
Cause you don't want to be that guy that blows out his fucking Achilles cause

449
00:25:23.071 --> 00:25:24.990
you're never the fucking same.
All right?

450
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:30.030
Unless you got Koby Bryant money and you can go to Germany,
right?

451
00:25:30.031 --> 00:25:34.590
And go see Peyton Manning's fucking doctor and they stick your fucking blood in

452
00:25:34.591 --> 00:25:38.400
a centrifuge.
Whatever those fucking leftover Nazis are doing over there,

453
00:25:38.401 --> 00:25:43.240
right there are running around.
Um,
yeah,
you're gonna,
uh,

454
00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.540
you're gonna fucking pay the price.
So I gotta make sure I stay limber cause I'm,

455
00:25:48.541 --> 00:25:49.500
who knows.
I don't know when,

456
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.530
I haven't really done a lot of research about kids even though I have one.
Um,

457
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:57.720
I know at some point they do start running around and uh,

458
00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.390
you know,
for the first like eight,

459
00:26:00.391 --> 00:26:03.870
nine years of your life being a dad is a ground game,
you know,

460
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.400
you got to take it to the mat.

461
00:26:05.401 --> 00:26:08.690
So I gotta to make sure that I stay fucking limber.
Uh,

462
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.630
the best I can because I don't want to be that fucking,
you know,

463
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:19.110
I'm an old,
I am an old dead,
but I'm a fucking psycho so that I will,

464
00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.170
I will energy my way through this.
You know what I mean?

465
00:26:22.171 --> 00:26:25.070
You know what I'm gonna be,
I'm going to be like Steve Brogan,
my fatherhood.

466
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.550
I'm going to be like fucking Steve Grogan during the neck brace years and I'm

467
00:26:29.551 --> 00:26:31.120
just going to tough it out.
You know,
man,

468
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.080
when he would just stand there and there,

469
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.850
this is back when you could hit a quarterback and you would just see this

470
00:26:35.851 --> 00:26:40.851
fucking guy running full speed and he would stand there until the last second.

471
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.830
And then he'd let it fly to Morgan.

472
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.470
And right as they started the follow the ball,

473
00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:49.680
you just see the beginning of the impact and Steve Grogan and the other guy

474
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:52.740
would go flying out of the right side of your screen as they follow the ball to

475
00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:55.200
the left.
Um,
that's going to be me

476
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.480
as a fucking quarterback.
I mean as a,
as a dad.
So,
um,

477
00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:05.810
anyways,
so I hit the road,
I go to,
um,
you know,

478
00:27:05.811 --> 00:27:07.040
I'm going to a Charlotte,

479
00:27:07.041 --> 00:27:11.940
going to go to the comedy zone and I'm doing a couple of shows out there.
Uh,

480
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.280
if I get there early night,

481
00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:18.010
not if I'm going to go to the shallot Hornets game and,
um,

482
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.630
and,
and,
and I'm closing in by the way.

483
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.070
And I'm going to Duke Carolina and empty,
you know,

484
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:29.170
and I'm not smoking cigars cause I got this fucking life insurance thing and I

485
00:27:29.171 --> 00:27:30.630
gotta tell you I'm smoked a cigar and like,

486
00:27:30.631 --> 00:27:34.530
well over two months and I feel fucking,
I feel good about,
you know,

487
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.760
so I don't know.
I might just keep going.
Who knows?
Um,

488
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:42.510
it can't be that smelly dead coming in smelling like,
like I went to the track,

489
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:49.980
oh,
big fucking thing in my life.
My wife might let me bring the fucking,

490
00:27:49.981 --> 00:27:51.930
the game changer.
You know,
the flat top grill.

491
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:57.390
We've got it fucking downstairs in my backyard.
Right.
And uh,

492
00:27:57.391 --> 00:28:00.240
so the kitchen's fucking upstairs does Atlanta,

493
00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.860
this house is completely fucked up,
right?

494
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.310
So I got to run up and down the fucking stairs,
you know,

495
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:10.590
it's a pain in the ass.
So I finally,
she,
cause I got,
I got rid of a ton of shit.

496
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:16.050
Um,
I put my,
uh,
my old Ludwig kit up for sale.

497
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.090
Um,
dissembles everything.
It's the whole fucking John Bonham set up.

498
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:25.440
1971 green sparkle,
Ludwig,
uh,

499
00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:30.430
all the pasty symbols.
Even the Rogers high hat that he had.

500
00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:35.530
I'm finally letting go of that.
That fan boy era is done.
You know,

501
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.180
I had a lot of fun with that kit,

502
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:42.190
but it's just fucking gigantic and a 26 inch bass drum.

503
00:28:42.851 --> 00:28:47.560
I don't want that.
You know what I want?
I want to,
I want to 12,
14,
16,
22 kick ass.

504
00:28:47.561 --> 00:28:50.830
What the fuck I want.
I never liked the sound of those symbols.

505
00:28:50.831 --> 00:28:54.030
I liked the high hats,
but I never liked the sound of is the fucking right.

506
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.710
He could make it sound good.
I couldn't.
Um,

507
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.790
so I've been getting into a bunch of other different sounds,

508
00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.690
all this shit that I always heard in my fucking head.

509
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.730
I really just kinda came to this realization,

510
00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:07.430
<v 4>okay.</v>

511
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:12.040
<v 1>As someone who does that as a hobby that,
uh,
I dunno,</v>

512
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.840
that was you.
You're not really creating,

513
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.490
you're just sort of recreating when you do shit like that.
Like you,

514
00:29:17.491 --> 00:29:21.670
you get so into what musician that you want to buy,
all the shit,

515
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.940
the exact shit that they had and then what?

516
00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.140
It's fucking,
it's just,
yeah,
I dunno.
There was just,

517
00:29:29.141 --> 00:29:33.550
I just kept picturing John Bonham coming back to life and for whatever reason,

518
00:29:33.551 --> 00:29:37.730
walking into my house and then I go,
oh my God,
John bought them.
Eh,

519
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:41.020
you're like Jesus,
but you're a drummer.
Come on Ed.
Hey,

520
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:45.430
the way you know I'm a huge fan of yours.
Yeah.
Come on.
Chica,
my drum kit.

521
00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:49.870
And he would walk in and see his exact drum kit right down to the Rogers high

522
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:52.360
hat and then he would get like that fucking,

523
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.300
I was joking with a buddy of mine today.
Oh,
a text.

524
00:29:55.301 --> 00:30:00.010
He would get that single white female vibe for me and he would just slowly back

525
00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:04.810
out of the room like,
Hey,
yeah,
that's great.
This guy just fucking leave.
So,

526
00:30:04.811 --> 00:30:09.220
um,
I dunno,
I'm going to go out.
I'm trying out all the kits.

527
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:12.880
I heard that Gretsch broadcaster with the three plies,
fucking,
you know,

528
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:17.500
has a great sound DW,
obviously amazing drums.

529
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.611
I grew up,

530
00:30:18.611 --> 00:30:22.270
everybody that I watched used to play the Tam is Tom or how the fuck you say it?

531
00:30:22.271 --> 00:30:26.770
Pearl?
Uh,
the Ludwigs um,
you know,
it's funny,

532
00:30:26.771 --> 00:30:30.460
I feel right.
Always played sonar or whatever.
And uh,

533
00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:34.660
the Great Benny Greg plays those,
but they,
they know fucking nobody has them.

534
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:39.540
They're like these amazing fucking drums is super expensive.
And,
uh,

535
00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:43.030
I've never seen,
I've never seen him,
um,
you know,

536
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:47.200
not that I go to guitar center anymore.
You know,
I go this,

537
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:50.160
there's a place out here called uh,
uh,

538
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.340
professional drum shop and they got some great shit out there.
Plus it's more,

539
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:57.490
you know,
they're like a legendary place,
you know,
dude,
I went in there,

540
00:30:57.491 --> 00:30:59.890
I know this is all drum shit,
but I ran to a drum recently.
He goes,

541
00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:03.910
talk more drums,
man.
So I fuck it.
I talked to enough sports here,
right?
Oh,

542
00:31:03.911 --> 00:31:07.700
I didn't talk about,
he seemed McQuaids fight.
He fought this guy,

543
00:31:07.701 --> 00:31:11.570
I think that his last name is Smith.
Um,
oh my God.
They had a great fight.

544
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:15.790
It was an old school haymaker thing.
And,
um,

545
00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:20.330
McQuade got the best of him in the end just to fucking tough guys.

546
00:31:20.331 --> 00:31:24.350
But I'm McQuaid got the last shot in and the guy kind of went down.

547
00:31:24.351 --> 00:31:27.530
But I mean the guy took a bunch of shots.
But of course maple leaf fans.

548
00:31:27.531 --> 00:31:31.240
Well like,
Oh but Quaids wearing his shield.
What a fucking secret.

549
00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.940
I love when people say no matter what,
no matter how much,

550
00:31:34.941 --> 00:31:38.210
how convincing your guy wins the fight,
there's always a fucking excuse.

551
00:31:38.211 --> 00:31:41.240
But then my wife goes,
yeah,
cause I was reading the comments and go,

552
00:31:41.241 --> 00:31:43.100
this is fucking unreal cause I'm sitting there going like,

553
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:47.240
well why didn't Smith just punch McQuaids fucking helmet off the way McQuade did

554
00:31:47.241 --> 00:31:51.830
to him?
There was always that option.
Right.
Um,
but when I brought it up,

555
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:56.390
the leaf fans were bitching that McQuade had on a visor.
My wife goes,
yeah,

556
00:31:56.391 --> 00:31:59.510
I was going to ask you about that.
And I was just like,
yeah,
all right.

557
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.470
And he's got on half a welder's mask maybe,
you know,
throwing up

558
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.920
over and under most shots go to the side of the helmet anyways.
Right.

559
00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:14.210
I'm old enough to remember when guys who did wear helmets,

560
00:32:14.211 --> 00:32:17.660
fought guys who had helmets and then that was the pussy move.

561
00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:21.440
And now I guess to Pussy move is,
you know,
you can keep your fucking helmet on,

562
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.940
is somebody else's cutting up the fucking hand,
punching the plastic.

563
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:29.030
But if you have a visor then you're a pussy.
I don't get it.

564
00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:30.710
All I know is McQuaids one of the best fighters,

565
00:32:30.711 --> 00:32:33.380
one of the toughest guys in the league.
And it was a great fucking fight.

566
00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.920
And that game,
even though we lost,
was unbelievable.

567
00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:40.550
Was it six to five or something like that?
Five to four.
I can't even remember.

568
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:44.690
A Bruins and leaves,
always have great games,
really have great games.
And um,

569
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.410
you know,
even though we law,
I think we lost the last two,
we won three in a row,

570
00:32:48.411 --> 00:32:52.580
but the Bruins a playing way better,
way better.
And uh,

571
00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.040
they're plane like the Bruins again,
you know,

572
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:56.750
and I think we're actually up to like the seventh seed,

573
00:32:56.751 --> 00:32:59.300
so all the fucking belly ache and that I'm doing,

574
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:04.910
I should have just kept my fucking mouth shut.
Cause,
uh,
who knows,
you know,

575
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:09.140
now people write articles.
Are they picking too early?
So anyways,
the drum talk,

576
00:33:09.141 --> 00:33:13.820
get back to the drum shit.
Um,
yeah,
ran into somebody saying,
oh,

577
00:33:13.821 --> 00:33:16.970
you should fucking talk more about that drum stuff.

578
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:21.240
So that's basically what I want to do.
And then I want to get like a just to,

579
00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.090
I can't even like,
uh,

580
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.390
trying to explain the sound to a buddy of mine that I'm looking for with
symbols,

581
00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:31.580
but I'm going to try all of them out.

582
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.780
Sabian's Meinl I love the sound of those things.
At least.

583
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.540
You know what's weird is you see the professional guys play them and they make

584
00:33:38.541 --> 00:33:39.920
them sound so fucking good.

585
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:44.000
And then you buy the exact one and then you liked it doesn't sound the way it's

586
00:33:44.001 --> 00:33:48.890
thought of when he did it.
That's Kegera Committee.
Um,

587
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:54.140
so uh,
yeah,
so I'm going to sell that kit and then the money I get from that,

588
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:59.090
I'm going to,
the game plan is to buy that new kid brand fucking new.

589
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:03.890
No more of this fucking old shit trying to figure stuff out.
Oh,

590
00:34:03.891 --> 00:34:07.940
that was going to say about that pro drum shop place is how fucking great that

591
00:34:07.941 --> 00:34:08.774
places,

592
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:13.700
I had a snare stand and I'm one of the,

593
00:34:13.701 --> 00:34:15.860
you know the thing you screw into to hold it into place,

594
00:34:15.861 --> 00:34:19.760
whatever the fuck you call it.
What you call that a nut?
I have no idea.

595
00:34:19.761 --> 00:34:22.330
All I know is that got stripped and it didn't.
It didn't work anymore.

596
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.230
Now if you ever went to guitar center,
they'd be like,
Oh,

597
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:25.430
you know you've got to buy a new one.

598
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:28.550
I walked into there and the guy just takes it and he went in the back.

599
00:34:28.551 --> 00:34:33.080
He fucking machine the thing so it worked again.
He goes,
hey,
go.
I was like,

600
00:34:33.081 --> 00:34:36.080
how much?
He's like,
Hey,
I know three bucks,
four bucks.

601
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:44.090
That doesn't exist anymore.
Do you know whether that still exists?

602
00:34:44.091 --> 00:34:48.020
Straight across the board in one industry is when you go to a cobbler,

603
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:52.250
you go into a fucking shoe store.
Those guys,
they don't give a shit.

604
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:54.290
They're in there with all those chemicals.

605
00:34:54.291 --> 00:34:55.730
They don't even know what fucking year it is.

606
00:34:55.731 --> 00:34:57.830
You haven't tried to go into a newest shoe store where they,

607
00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.200
where were they actually repair shoes?
A cobbler.
I guess.

608
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:04.800
It seems weird to use that word but it,
I think that's what it is.
Right?
Um,

609
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:10.570
the modern day blacksmith a cobbler and you go in that you can't even fucking

610
00:35:10.851 --> 00:35:11.540
breathe.

611
00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.270
You gotta do that thing where you're trying to pinch your nostrils together as

612
00:35:14.271 --> 00:35:16.460
you talked to him yet.
Can you like he fixed his belt.

613
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.850
Can you are put some more sold on these and the guy's like,
hey,

614
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.660
we never used it and they never take like,
it's always like cash.

615
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:27.140
They're like right now to receipt.
You can't read any of their fucking writing.

616
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:30.890
I Dunno.
This is one of those,

617
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:34.100
you know something that's like a great place for like one of those fucking Harry

618
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.770
Potter type of movies to start like a new franchise.

619
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.230
Something about when you go to a cobbler,

620
00:35:40.231 --> 00:35:42.350
it's like stepping back into time and they'd be seen,

621
00:35:42.351 --> 00:35:45.090
there'd be some old weird guy maybe played by Billy crystal.

622
00:35:45.091 --> 00:35:47.280
They put some prosthetics on his nose is some shit.

623
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.670
Then you do that one time with that guy,
that guy from the Washington bullets.

624
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.030
Mayurasana did they do a movie together?

625
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.770
I don't know what the fuck it was one of those Ebeneezer scrooge fucking movies.

626
00:35:58.771 --> 00:35:59.281
But anyways,

627
00:35:59.281 --> 00:36:02.160
you think he going to the cobbler and there's some sort of back room area.

628
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:04.860
I love pitching out ideas for movies cause I'm never going to,

629
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:07.920
I'm not going to fucking write one might go through that fucking

630
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:13.440
axe grinder,
that fucking whore.
I,
why would you do that to yourself?

631
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.950
You know what I mean?
If you can travel the country telling shit and Dick Jokes,

632
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:21.951
why on fucking earth would you walk into that fucking heartbreaking of a fucking

633
00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:28.320
arena.
So I'm just only movie idea I have.

634
00:36:28.321 --> 00:36:30.960
I'm just throwing out there and I hope somebody fucking rights it makes it,

635
00:36:30.961 --> 00:36:35.760
I hope you make a fucking billion dollars.
I don't give a shit.
You know why?

636
00:36:35.761 --> 00:36:40.761
Because the Patriots Super Bowl and Tom Brady's the greatest quarterback of all

637
00:36:42.061 --> 00:36:46.920
time.
You could say it now.
Five fucking rinks.
Ah God,

638
00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:53.760
Jesus Christ.
Do you know sad?
Do you know he's fucking sad people?

639
00:36:53.761 --> 00:36:56.130
There are right now,
and I don't just mean in Atlanta,

640
00:36:56.131 --> 00:37:00.330
I just meet Patriot haters in general because the Patriots had been so fucking

641
00:37:00.331 --> 00:37:04.290
successful and they've been so fucking vilified,
you know,

642
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:08.550
for the shit that they do that everybody else fucking does,
right?

643
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.280
They fucking debt.
Literally watching them lose,

644
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:18.810
gives other people hope,
you know,

645
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.720
gives you hope that you can call up your cable company,

646
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:24.420
dispute the bill and get some money off of it.
Right.

647
00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:29.050
Gives you a hope that she can fuck in a,
you know,
an elected politician and they,

648
00:37:29.051 --> 00:37:32.980
they,
they're going to fucking not sell out to the corporations.

649
00:37:32.981 --> 00:37:34.990
You know what I mean?
That that's what the Patriots have become,

650
00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.990
that that's their level of fucking success.

651
00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:43.620
There's going to be a lot of slumped shoulders go to work tomorrow or maybe

652
00:37:43.871 --> 00:37:45.280
right now.
Maybe you're one of those people,

653
00:37:45.281 --> 00:37:49.450
maybe you're driving in your car right now and you showed us as so slumped.

654
00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.760
You're not even using your hands to fucking steer.

655
00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:56.290
He gets got your shoulders fucking wrapped around it.
Just all fucking

656
00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.910
caved in is the thrill ride says right.

657
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:02.320
<v 4>Okay.</v>

658
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:07.100
<v 1>Maybe one of those people.
Well,
you know what I say fucking grow up,
right?</v>

659
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:11.110
It's just a God damn game.
I would've taken the loss.
I was already ready already.

660
00:38:11.111 --> 00:38:13.450
I was sitting there writing my fucking concession speech.

661
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.593
<v 4>You know</v>

662
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:20.910
<v 1>unfucking believable.
All right,
let's get out of this fucking four techs here.</v>

663
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:25.060
I only know if I got the advertising yet for this week.
Oh yeah.

664
00:38:25.061 --> 00:38:25.770
So the game plans,

665
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:29.850
I'm going to buy that fucking kit and then I'm going to find some rehearsal

666
00:38:29.851 --> 00:38:34.560
space somewhere nearby.
Some fucking place for a couple of hundred bucks a month.

667
00:38:34.561 --> 00:38:38.370
And I'm going to fucking put it in there.
All right?
And whenever I can't,

668
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.690
that's going to be my fucking man cave.
All right?

669
00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.310
Cause you know what the fuck happens.

670
00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.100
<v 4>Okay.</v>

671
00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.980
<v 1>You know what I mean?
You have a kid,
you're married,
you know,</v>

672
00:38:45.981 --> 00:38:49.130
gradually all the shit just starts fucking disappeared.

673
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:51.003
<v 4>Okay.</v>

674
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.910
<v 1>My wife can't fucking wait.
She can't,
she couldn't fucking,
you know.</v>

675
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:55.590
<v 4>Okay,</v>

676
00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:58.470
<v 1>she's happy.
I like the drums,
but no fucking woman wants a fucking</v>

677
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.570
<v 4>okay.</v>

678
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:03.690
<v 1>26 inch bass drum in a fucking travel case,</v>

679
00:39:03.691 --> 00:39:07.210
like I'm on the fucking road with the rolling stones in another fucking four

680
00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:11.220
drum stacked up on top of that,
you know,
in front of the bed,
in the guest room.

681
00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.650
Nobody fucking wants it.
Well,
they don't want that.
So,
um,

682
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:21.090
I don't know,
but you know what?
I got to give this to her.

683
00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.570
She never told me to sell the fucking thing.

684
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.400
All I know is when I told her that I was selling it,

685
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:27.670
I saw the excitement in a right.
And then I tested her and I was saying,
yeah,

686
00:39:27.671 --> 00:39:30.310
but then I'm going to go buy another one and it's going to live right there.

687
00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:34.260
And then she just stared at me and I just started laughing.
Um,

688
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:35.870
<v 4>okay.</v>

689
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:40.280
<v 1>I'm trying not to be a dick though.
Now that I,
you know,
our dynamic has changed.</v>

690
00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.613
<v 4>You know,</v>

691
00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.950
<v 1>like I'm going to put my truck in fucking storage and I'll,
ah,</v>

692
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:50.040
drive it on the weekends.
I know there's a lot of married guys.
Why not going out?

693
00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:53.040
You're never going to drive it and then you're going to fucking sell it.
Um,

694
00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:56.620
I actually thought about selling it to,
you know,

695
00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.260
just this whole fucking streamline and mine in my life,

696
00:39:59.261 --> 00:40:02.350
getting my fucking shit down.
But um,

697
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:03.610
<v 4>okay.</v>

698
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:07.330
<v 1>I can't fucking do it.
I just,
when I drive that truck,</v>

699
00:40:07.331 --> 00:40:11.800
this stupid smile on my fucking face.
It's just I can't do it.

700
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:13.390
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

701
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.201
<v 1>Can't fucking do it.</v>

702
00:40:14.201 --> 00:40:16.450
So I'm just going to put it in storage and I'll eat that fucking money.

703
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:22.180
I hate being the storage guy.
I get stuff in storage.
Yeah.

704
00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:26.080
If people have stuff in storage are just too lazy to have a fucking yard sale,

705
00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:27.950
you know what I mean?
Just fucking salad.

706
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.093
<v 4>Sell it.</v>

707
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:34.950
<v 1>How long has it been there?
What is,
you know,</v>

708
00:40:34.951 --> 00:40:37.920
it's funny just hanging onto those fucking memories.

709
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:43.070
It's,
I'm telling you,
dude,
it's a fucking disease.
And I got it.
I got it bad.

710
00:40:43.071 --> 00:40:46.130
I'm a sentimental fool.
I gotta I gotta get rid of all of that shit.

711
00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:51.230
I never look at it.
It just becomes another box in the fucking attic,

712
00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.473
<v 4>you know,</v>

713
00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:56.280
<v 1>and you fucking die some day.</v>

714
00:40:56.281 --> 00:40:59.340
And then somebody looking through it and there's all this weird shit in there

715
00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.480
that you kept some menu from fucking Tulsa,

716
00:41:03.481 --> 00:41:06.240
Oklahoma for whatever.
Well,
what the fuck is it then?
You know,

717
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.290
he just given these people this big job that they got to go and throw their shit

718
00:41:10.291 --> 00:41:11.124
up.

719
00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.290
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

720
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:16.920
<v 1>How is this sona fucking,
is this a website?</v>

721
00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.330
Oh,
that's seminar.
The Nam show or all the shredders.
Go

722
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.770
see here.
You know,
it was in a Sam ash the other day,
right.

723
00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:28.610
<v 4>And uh,</v>

724
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.740
<v 1>I wanted to see if they had it.
What the fuck do I know?
I went there.</v>

725
00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:34.040
I actually can't say why I went there.

726
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.540
<v 6>I won't get caught.</v>

727
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:39.290
I just had all these extra drum sticks and I had all this shit that I was

728
00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:41.330
getting rid of that I just don't fucking use.
And I'm like,

729
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:42.200
what am I gonna do with this stuff?

730
00:41:42.201 --> 00:41:47.201
I can't sell old drum sticks on a fucking on Ebay or some shit.

731
00:41:47.841 --> 00:41:52.640
So what I did was I just bundled them all together and just left them in their

732
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:56.900
parking lot.
You know,
some kids get to walk in there and be like,
Holy Shit,

733
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.540
I had like 40 pairs of fucking all these different drum sticks over the years.

734
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:05.420
I just bundle them all.
Just stuck in there like a fucking cow bell.

735
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.313
A couple of the things.

736
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.970
So at that point I'm like,
all right.
I guess kind of was feeling guilty.

737
00:42:12.971 --> 00:42:16.660
So I went into Sam ash.
It was like,
I don't buy a fucking pair of drumsticks.

738
00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:21.520
And there was some kid in there just doing that fucking drum and where he's

739
00:42:21.521 --> 00:42:26.370
amazing,
but all the whole fucking thing.
It's just one fill after another,

740
00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.690
<v 5>those fucking</v>

741
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:32.230
<v 6>linear 32nd note.</v>

742
00:42:32.231 --> 00:42:37.231
Fucking Phil's played 9 million miles an hour every fucking after.

743
00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.510
It just all sounds the same.
But don't,

744
00:42:40.511 --> 00:42:45.160
we don't get Dr [inaudible] for fucking like,

745
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:47.350
I almost started laughing because the kid was amazing,

746
00:42:47.351 --> 00:42:50.950
but after awhile it's just like,
dude,
you sound like you're fucking,

747
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:56.470
you sound like a fucking snorted a couple of eight balls.
Jesus Christ.

748
00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:01.030
Maybe I'm just getting old.
I was,
well,
I put a little air in there.
You know,

749
00:43:01.031 --> 00:43:04.090
the old guy who can't play as good as a young kid and he's jealous of his chops,

750
00:43:04.091 --> 00:43:07.030
but Jesus Christ.
All right,
what am I doing here?

What are you gonna do?
Huh?

816
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.820
Fucking push your tits together and throw a little perfume down in the middle.

817
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:10.620

It matches.
It's,

826
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:36.160
it's cute.
You know,

827
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:39.650
remember back in the day when people had like a fucking answer machine and they

828
00:47:39.651 --> 00:47:41.690
would do it together.
Like hello,

829
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.160
this is the Johnsons and together we're happy.

830
00:47:45.161 --> 00:47:48.010
You know they do I fucking horse shit.
This is the underwear version of that.

831
00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:52.000
All right.
Mandy says special limited edition Valentines undies,

832
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:54.700

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.340
it's just cute as it sounds slash creepy.

834
00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:00.100
And if for some reason you and me on these aren't a perfect match,

835
00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:02.510
they'll give you your money back and let you keep the first parent.

836
00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.220

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:47.980
Everybody Dollar Shave Club always gives you a close,

880
00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:51.550
smooth shave and you can't beat the convenience or the price.

881
00:50:51.551 --> 00:50:55.660
You don't have to choose between settling for a cheap bag of disposables or

882
00:50:55.661 --> 00:50:59.630
paying out the nose for a razor with a laser pointer and 17 blades.
It's awful.

883
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:04.040
Then dollar shave club broke onto the scene with the smarter choice.

884
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.920
Before Dollar Shave Club,
there was no middle ground.

885
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.800
There was the haves and the have nots.
It was easy.

886
00:51:09.801 --> 00:51:12.410
It was either saved money and get a painful shave from a disposable,

887
00:51:12.411 --> 00:51:14.180
like the ones that you get for free to a gym,

888
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:18.710
which felt like shaving with a piece of glass or pay a fortune for the latest

889
00:51:18.711 --> 00:51:20.900
shaved breakthrough in quotes,

890
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:24.320
you didn't need like a laser chin detector are 17 more blades.

891
00:51:24.321 --> 00:51:27.710
It was fucking stupid.
Dollar Shave Club is the best of both worlds.

892
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:31.940

uh,

905
00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:20.190
let's all go to the lobby.
Bup,
bup up,
boo boo.
All right,
let's,
um,

906
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:24.410
let's read some of these fucking things.
Uh,
eight.
Did I call it a what?

907
00:52:24.411 --> 00:52:27.040
I said it was going to be a classic,
although I don't know if I can,

908
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.080
it's a classic for one side.
I thought it was gonna be a classic for both,

909
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:35.210
for both sides,
but I'm all right enough,
Bill.
Okay.

910
00:52:35.211 --> 00:52:37.370
The fucking Atlanta fans have suffered enough.
Okay.

911
00:52:37.371 --> 00:52:40.640
Let's just fucking get through this.
Okay.
Alright.
First football game,

912
00:52:40.641 --> 00:52:44.120
watched from sweet,
uh,
Bill Birdie,

913
00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:47.120
uh,
being from speed,

914
00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.620
saying that football is big here as an understatement.

915
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.620
I don't know how they talk over there,
but I,
that's actually a Swedish accent,

916
00:52:54.621 --> 00:52:56.880
isn't it?
I have no idea.
Uh,

917
00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.050
but I've been listening to your podcast for a couple of years now and you're

918
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:03.890
rambling over.
Nfl have made me interested.
I'll look at them.

919
00:53:03.891 --> 00:53:06.200
Maybe you just got me a job at the NFL,
you know,

920
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:08.440
maybe I could be on when you're a little Google things in your rump

921
00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:13.450
as you fucking talk and whenever the hell you guys speak over there.
Right.

922
00:53:13.451 --> 00:53:15.500
Each magic version.
That's what it sounds like to me.

923
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.320
I can't imagine what I sound like to you.
Probably a fucking asshole.
All right.

924
00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:22.730
I finally sat down and watched a game and it was the Superbowl that just ended

925
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:27.030
and what a game.
I'm sold Jesus Christ.
When the fuck did this guy send this in?

926
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:31.680
I love hockey mostly,
but I found a new game to love.
Tom Brady.

927
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:35.970
Best Qb ever says the Swedish commentators.
I have no clue,

928
00:53:35.971 --> 00:53:39.660
but I believed them,
I guess.
Uh,
thanks for getting me into the game.

929
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.250
Better late than never.

930
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:45.480
I love people who've could speak a second language that's fucking amazing.

931
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.640
Sorry for the bad English grammar dude.

932
00:53:48.641 --> 00:53:51.870
He did the fucking Boston accent perfectly in a second language.

933
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.510
He says it's early and I'm tired.
All the best to you.

934
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.080
Nia and the newborn baby girl loved the special.

935
00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:00.570
Looking forward to season two was,
uh,F is for family.
You know,
it's funny,

936
00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:04.740
I was just thinking I got to get over there.
I missed you guys in the last tour.

937
00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:08.580
I didn't do the Norway,
the Oslo,
Stockholm,

938
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:12.050
Helsinki run.
I got to make sure I do that at some point.
Um,

939
00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:13.670
<v 4>okay.</v>

940
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:17.300
<v 6>But,
uh,
any one,
Jesus Christ,
dude,
um,
I don't want to rain on your parade,</v>

941
00:54:17.301 --> 00:54:20.300
but you just w you know,
most football games are not that exciting.

942
00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:24.770
Do you know how boring the first half was?
Well,
I guess for me it was depressing.

943
00:54:24.771 --> 00:54:26.520
I guess it was exciting for Atlanta fans.

944
00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.070
<v 4>Okay.</v>

945
00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:30.050
<v 6>Oh God,
I can't,
you know,
I had a buddy of mine,</v>

946
00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:32.533
<v 4>mmm.</v>

947
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:36.480
<v 6>Actually he recently passed away,
which sucks,
but he told me this fucking story.</v>

948
00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:38.100
<v 4>Okay.</v>

949
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:42.690
<v 6>When the red sox had like two outs in 1986 against the mets,</v>

950
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:46.590
he had the wire office,
champagne bottle,

951
00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:49.290
and he had to put it back on after they lost.

952
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:58.140
Hey baby,
this'll be
for Atlanta fence.

953
00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:02.820
This'll be cathartic for you.
If you want to share your,

954
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.810
uh,
I thought we were going to win stories and then I had to put the fucking wire

955
00:55:06.811 --> 00:55:11.100
back on the champagne bottle.
I'll read them next week.
Um,

956
00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:13.410
or anybody out there,
if you have those,

957
00:55:13.411 --> 00:55:17.900
we're going to fucking win and then you lose the fucking game.
Um,

958
00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:20.570
I got a bunch of them I can share with you.
Uh,

959
00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:25.330
I got a bunch of those.
I got a bunch of those.
Um,

960
00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:30.310
those could be fucking really,
fas are fucking always hilarious.
It's so,

961
00:55:30.311 --> 00:55:34.160
that's comedy man itself.
When if it works out,
there's no comedy.
It's white.
When

962
00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:40.170
what'd you find?
Like if the Patriots fucking got their asses kicked out of it,

963
00:55:40.171 --> 00:55:42.730
that would have,
I already knew I was going.
We just got our asses wept.

964
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:47.340
I had the whole fucking thing worked out steady.
Came on gushing here.

965
00:55:47.341 --> 00:55:49.590
Like I just won the fucking publisher's clearinghouse.

966
00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:53.490
I cannot fucking believe they came back and won that game.
That is,

967
00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:56.670
I fucking stunned.

968
00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:03.860
CanNot fucking believe that.
All right.
British dentistry.
Hey Bill.

969
00:56:03.861 --> 00:56:07.790
I remember hearing that you used to be a dentist before your standup career took

970
00:56:07.791 --> 00:56:10.970
off.
So I have a dental quest for you.
I was not a dentist,

971
00:56:10.971 --> 00:56:12.380
but I love that you put that out there.

972
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:16.920
And then I'll probably end up on my a Wikipedia page.
Um,

973
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:21.080
I don't know why we British don't take dental care seriously.

974
00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:23.950
I have pretty decent teeth for British person,

975
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:28.780
probably in the top 15% of people,
British people.
That is,

976
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.680
I always brushed twice a day unless they get drunk and forget sometimes after

977
00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:36.970
going out drinking.
But I noticed that when I was in America,
my teeth were shit,

978
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:41.950
what the fuck are you lot over there in the land of Mcdonald's and Coca Cola

979
00:56:41.951 --> 00:56:43.570
doing to keep your teeth so clean?

980
00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:46.900
Is their toothpaste in the water supply or there was fluoride?

981
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:51.880
Sometimes they put in too much and people got those white spots in their teeth a

982
00:56:51.881 --> 00:56:54.110
seriously.
Uh,
do you do,

983
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:59.740
do you lot live at the dentist a lot?
Meaning all you guys,

984
00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:04.210
even the working class over in America seem to have good teeth?
Uh,
yeah,

985
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:09.580
we do.
Well,
I mean,
uh,
braces are a big thing over here.

986
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:12.940
I don't know if you guys have those over there yet.
Uh,
those are a big thing.

987
00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:18.100
People also can get like their teeth bleached caps are a lot better than they

988
00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:22.510
used to be.
Um,
yeah.
But at the end of the day,
dude,

989
00:57:22.511 --> 00:57:27.511
you gotta brush your teeth FTE and there's certain things like drinking coffee.

990
00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.640
I guess your tea over there would probably stay in the shit out of him.

991
00:57:30.641 --> 00:57:34.850
I'll tell you one that's fucking brutal.
Red Wine,
red,
red.

992
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:36.343
<v 5>Wow.</v>

993
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:42.820
<v 6>Makes your teeth gray.
Um,
yeah,</v>

994
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:45.730
just brush and floss.
You know,

995
00:57:45.731 --> 00:57:49.480
I got this life insurance test coming up cause I'm getting my affairs in order

996
00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:54.640
now that I've got a kid.
Um,
they told me,
they said,

997
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:57.760
have you been to the dentist?
And I said,
yes.
I said,
well,
is any gum disease?

998
00:57:57.761 --> 00:58:01.370
And I said No.
And they said,
that's good.
I said,
oh,
I go,

999
00:58:01.371 --> 00:58:03.010
they're worried about my teeth falling out.
And they said,

1000
00:58:03.011 --> 00:58:07.960
no gum disease can be a sign of something wrong with your heart.

1001
00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:13.780
I was like,
what?
I never heard.
I never heard that.
Never heard that.

1002
00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:15.970
I know if he had fucked up teeth that usually,

1003
00:58:15.971 --> 00:58:19.270
and led to you not a chewing your food as well,

1004
00:58:19.271 --> 00:58:21.970
which lead to stomach problems and then problems with your intestine and then

1005
00:58:21.971 --> 00:58:26.620
down to your ash.
It's all fucking connected.
Um,
but I had never heard of that.

1006
00:58:26.621 --> 00:58:27.251
So anyways,

1007
00:58:27.251 --> 00:58:31.420
he said to put in perspective how bad some British people are with dental

1008
00:58:31.421 --> 00:58:32.254
hygiene.

1009
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:36.490
I know someone who would only brush their teeth once or twice a week.

1010
00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:41.980
I had to buy them an electric toothbrush as a not so subtle hint that not

1011
00:58:41.981 --> 00:58:44.140
brushing your teeth is fucking disgusting.

1012
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.100
I guess there's a lot of truth to stereotypes.
PSL.

1013
00:58:48.101 --> 00:58:51.100
Be Amazed if you actually managed to read this without stuttering,

1014
00:58:51.101 --> 00:58:52.190
you illiterate.
Fuck,

1015
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.050
uh,
you know something.

1016
00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:03.660
If that whole fucking thing was just to get that joke and that was an absolute

1017
00:59:03.661 --> 00:59:07.860
masterpiece,
you know,
if you actually just pick that subject,

1018
00:59:07.861 --> 00:59:09.570
British stenner street,
just to fool us.

1019
00:59:09.571 --> 00:59:13.380
So we would actually read it and was all self deprecating,
just the end,

1020
00:59:13.381 --> 00:59:15.420
just to call me a fucking illiterate.
Fuck.

1021
00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:20.240
The stuttering illiterate fuck is great.
I have a tremendous,
um,

1022
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:23.920
I don't even know if you're serious anymore,
but yeah,
that's,
listen,
I,

1023
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:26.810
when I worked in a dental office,
all I did was just hand the shit.

1024
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:31.100
I was an assistant.
I was certified to take x rays.
I wasn't a hygienist.

1025
00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.600
I wasn't any of that other shit.

1026
00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.073
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1027
00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:38.520
<v 6>So anyways,
um,
yeah,
that was one of my first jokes.</v>

1028
00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:42.030
This guy came in and guy was like,
you know,
I don't stand in front of my teeth.

1029
00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:46.080
And I brushed my teeth almost every day at,
my joke was,
oh really?

1030
00:59:46.081 --> 00:59:47.280
Dee Dee a wipe your ass.

1031
00:59:47.281 --> 00:59:51.150
Almost every time you take a shit that may come on people is this thing on.

1032
00:59:51.930 --> 00:59:55.140
It's one of my first jokes.
Everybody there was a,
what do they call it?

1033
00:59:55.141 --> 00:59:58.020
Throwback Thursday.
Now I'm actress paying alimony.

1034
00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:01.200
If you just brush your fucking teeth,
I think you'll be fine.

1035
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:02.960
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1036
01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.010
<v 6>You know?</v>

1037
01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:08.790
And especially before you go to bed to just like go out drinking and doing all

1038
01:00:08.791 --> 01:00:13.210
that shit and then just go to bed and just let that shit just get it.

1039
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:18.270
It's gross.
It's fucking gross.
She brush floss.
And you should use mouthwash,

1040
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:22.380
you know,
and then you should find a fucking woman that does the same thing.

1041
01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.350
And that's the person you should be kissing over there.
Everybody else,

1042
01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:28.410
I don't know.
Jesus Christ.
Oh my God.
That's fucking gross.

1043
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:34.440
Anyways,
actress paying alimony.
Bill wondering if you saw this,

1044
01:00:34.441 --> 01:00:38.040
a fairly famous actress has been paying or unemployed husband alimony,

1045
01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:40.950
and she's complaining that he hasn't tried to get a job.

1046
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.580
She's paying him 20 grand a month.
Does that make him a bum?

1047
01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:47.330
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1048
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:48.710
<v 6>Is this like a trick question?</v>

1049
01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:54.390
If I had a son that ever fucking did that,
I would disown him.

1050
01:00:57.330 --> 01:00:59.160
That's fucking unbelievable.
I've seen that.

1051
01:00:59.161 --> 01:01:03.900
You know that that does happen when one of the,
uh,
alright,
here we go.

1052
01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.190
Let's let me read this thing here.

1053
01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:06.820
<v 0>Uh,</v>

1054
01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.640
<v 6>according to a court document,</v>

1055
01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:10.120
<v 4>okay,</v>

1056
01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:15.120
<v 6>So-and-so is paid over a half a million dollars to her former spouse since 2015.</v>

1057
01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:17.550
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1058
01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:20.100
<v 6>These funds include around 150,000.</v>

1059
01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.210
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1060
01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:24.330
<v 6>And such,
it's such residuals.
I'm not going to say who the fuck this is.</v>

1061
01:01:24.331 --> 01:01:26.910
I put people's dirty laundry out there even though it's already out here.

1062
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:28.743
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1063
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.910
<v 6>She gave birth to that daughter in March of last year.</v>

1064
01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:37.170
It's person alleges that the other guy cheated on him

1065
01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:41.550
<v 0>with the,
Oh,</v>

1066
01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:44.510
<v 6>he's saying that she cheated on him with her costar.</v>

1067
01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:48.880
A point of contention in the divorce.
The divorce has since been finalized.

1068
01:01:48.881 --> 01:01:50.660
The terms of support have not,

1069
01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:56.000
hence a temporary agreement where she has to pay this dude over 20 grand

1070
01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:56.863
monthly.

1071
01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:57.820
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1072
01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:00.520
<v 6>Well,
you know,
if they do get divorced shift,
she's out here in California,</v>

1073
01:02:00.521 --> 01:02:03.220
she's going to get fucked according to documents.

1074
01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:08.260
So-And-So is requested to be able to stop sending the guy those payments saying

1075
01:02:08.621 --> 01:02:12.280
that the guy has made no effort to get a job of his own and his living off of

1076
01:02:12.281 --> 01:02:13.114
her.

1077
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:15.140
<v 0>Uh,</v>

1078
01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:19.620
<v 6>yeah,
man.
I mean,
that's when you just start thinking murderous thoughts,
you know,</v>

1079
01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.040
I

1080
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.180
<v 1>think that's a,</v>

1081
01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:24.093
<v 4>yeah.</v>

1082
01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.660
<v 1>You know,
it's bad enough when a fucking woman does it.
I mean,</v>

1083
01:02:26.661 --> 01:02:28.250
I'm really doing like a double standard here.

1084
01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:29.780
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1085
01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:34.400
<v 1>But,
uh,
yeah,
dude.
I mean,
you're not a fucking man if you do something like that.</v>

1086
01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:37.940
And if you're a woman and you don't try to get a job,
you're a piece of shit.

1087
01:02:37.941 --> 01:02:41.750
But you know what?
I know that you don't give a fuck.
So you know,

1088
01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:46.640
women don't give a shit.
They actually get off of the fact that you fucking,

1089
01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.090
you know,
am I really going to turn this around?
Just slamming women?
I mean,

1090
01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:51.200
really gonna figure out how to do that.
When does a woman,

1091
01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:55.220
the woman's a victim in this Belfer.
Okay.
Um,
yeah,
that's complete bullshit.

1092
01:02:55.940 --> 01:03:00.560
It's complete bullshit.
I straight across the board think that's fucked up.

1093
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:02.210
All right.
Now.
Okay,

1094
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:05.960
she's a fucking drug addict and he has to stay at home the entire time to watch

1095
01:03:05.961 --> 01:03:09.620
their kid.
I mean,
they just had their kid that is actually his job.

1096
01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:11.630
They understand.
You know what I mean?

1097
01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:13.873
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1098
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:18.440
<v 1>Oh God.
Then for the grace of God go,
I,
Holy Shit.</v>

1099
01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:21.140
I just don't understand how it gets to that.

1100
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:22.220
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1101
01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:25.470
<v 1>You know what I mean?
How'd he get to that point where you're with somebody,</v>

1102
01:03:25.471 --> 01:03:28.740
you have a fucking kid.
I'm probably jinxing myself.
You have a kid together

1103
01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:31.520
and then eight,

1104
01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.010
like he decided to make another person together and within a fucking

1105
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:39.080
<v 6>two years of that,</v>

1106
01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:40.850
<v 4>okay,</v>

1107
01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:45.130
<v 1>you're getting the of Jesus Christ be one thing.</v>

1108
01:03:45.131 --> 01:03:47.010
If they had a one night stand but they were already married,
that's,

1109
01:03:47.011 --> 01:03:50.390
that's fucking nuts.
All right.
Who knows?
Maybe the guy just went nuts.

1110
01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:54.260
Maybe she did fuck around them.
I don't know.
All right.
Coaching daughters,
uh,

1111
01:03:54.261 --> 01:03:57.850
sports teams,
coaching.
Dot.
Well,
it's supposed to be,
uh,

1112
01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:02.600
an apostrophe there.
Coaching Daughter's sports team.
All right.
Congrats.

1113
01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:03.660
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1114
01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:06.670
<v 6>On not pulling out.
Ha Ha.
No,
thank you.
No,</v>

1115
01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:10.710
I was wondering if you will coach any of your daughter's sports teams when she

1116
01:04:10.711 --> 01:04:14.760
gets older.
What sports would you like to see her grow up to play?

1117
01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:19.290
Congratulations to you and Nia and thank you for another grade special.
Um,
oh,

1118
01:04:19.291 --> 01:04:24.210
you're welcome.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Um,
would I do that?

1119
01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:25.550
Uh,

1120
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:26.790
<v 4>okay.</v>

1121
01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:31.020
<v 6>I don't know.
I don't want to insert myself into my daughter's life like that.</v>

1122
01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:36.050
I'd like her to have to learn how to deal with another adult and especially if

1123
01:04:36.231 --> 01:04:38.930
she doesn't like him and learn how to fucking,
you know,

1124
01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:45.360
deal with a coach sets a little hard nose.
So whatever,
you know,
I mean,

1125
01:04:45.361 --> 01:04:48.180
I'm not going to be one of those people that,
you know,
blew my fucking kid.

1126
01:04:48.181 --> 01:04:49.560
If my kid stinks,
I'm not going to

1127
01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.640
<v 1>can make them play my kid.</v>

1128
01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.460
<v 6>Right?
I'm not going to be the,
I've just all of that shit.</v>

1129
01:04:56.461 --> 01:04:58.140
I don't understand any of that.

1130
01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.820
And if your coach is fucking hard nose and your kid comes home crying about it,

1131
01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:04.710
it's literally told toughen the fuck up.

1132
01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:06.030
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1133
01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:06.960
<v 6>Learn on a deal what you think.</v>

1134
01:05:06.961 --> 01:05:09.750
This is the first asshole you ever going to fucking run into in life.
It's,

1135
01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.613
it's not.

1136
01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:16.640
<v 1>You know,
you know what worked twice as hard.</v>

1137
01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:17.950
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1138
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:21.310
<v 6>Make that fucking guy regret that he ever yelled at you.
Oh,
that woman,</v>

1139
01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:24.790
that's what you do.
You just,
you just go fucking harder.
That's what you do.

1140
01:05:24.791 --> 01:05:29.110
What you don't do is fucking mope around about it and,
and try less.

1141
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:34.510
All right?
If your motivation,
even if your motivation is fuck this guy,

1142
01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:37.420
you know you're going to play better,

1143
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:42.430
but you got to use that negative shit and turn it into a positive.

1144
01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:46.390
And um,
I'm a big believer in uh,

1145
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:52.560
playing organized sports in organized sports has gotten a brutal reputation over

1146
01:05:52.661 --> 01:05:57.370
the years.
Some of it is justified,
a lot of it wasn't,

1147
01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:03.460
a lot of,
it was a bunch of uncoordinated people who did not have a good fucking

1148
01:06:03.461 --> 01:06:08.461
experience and then married someone else who was also on coordinated and then

1149
01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:13.600
watch their toddler growing up,
bumping into shit and was like,

1150
01:06:13.601 --> 01:06:14.710
oh my God,

1151
01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:19.510
they're going to suck at sports too and they're going to have the same pain that

1152
01:06:19.511 --> 01:06:21.280
I did or I had.
Right.

1153
01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:26.260
And then rather than steering them away from sports and going,

1154
01:06:26.261 --> 01:06:29.920
well,
hey,
maybe you are a writer or maybe you're into science.

1155
01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:35.850
These fucking uncoordinated cons had to stick them in sports.

1156
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:39.960
And then they had the dumb,
the whole thing down where everybody gets a ribbon.

1157
01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:44.130
I had a buddy of mine recently said,
what was it?
Somebody doing a joke,

1158
01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.660
I can't say it.
If it was a joke,
who the fuck told me this story?

1159
01:06:48.661 --> 01:06:53.610
It was was,
no,
it was somebody bit,
I can't do it.

1160
01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:56.860
Uh,
fuck it had to do basically with playing,

1161
01:06:58.920 --> 01:06:59.760
uh,

1162
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:05.880
little kids playing softball and when they first played they played without the

1163
01:07:05.881 --> 01:07:10.740
ball and they pretended that they hit the fucking thing so nobody would have the

1164
01:07:10.741 --> 01:07:14.520
pressure of making an error and they could be like nice catch way to go and all

1165
01:07:14.521 --> 01:07:19.200
of that shit.
It's fucking insane.
Um,
no,

1166
01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:23.640
I'm not going to do that.
And unfortunately my wife is on the same page and uh,

1167
01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:28.550
I told you that shit.
Somebody sent us some,
uh,
Boston,
you know,

1168
01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.770
sports shirts and they were,
they would,
you know,

1169
01:07:31.771 --> 01:07:36.360
with the logos of the teams and they were in pink and my wife was just going

1170
01:07:36.361 --> 01:07:40.080
like,
yeah,
she's not wearing those.
And I'm like,
why?
Cause you hate sports.

1171
01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.030
And she goes,
no,
because they're pink.
She goes,

1172
01:07:42.031 --> 01:07:45.210
if she's going to wear the team stuff,
she's,
she's wearing the team colors.

1173
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:47.270
I think I already told you this guys.
I was like,

1174
01:07:47.271 --> 01:07:51.300
do you have any fucking idea how much real sports fans would appreciate what you

1175
01:07:51.301 --> 01:07:53.910
just said?
You don't even like sports.
You have no fucking idea.
You just,

1176
01:07:53.911 --> 01:07:56.980
you just like,
you stepped in shit there.
That's like the,

1177
01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:03.550
that's exactly it.
Um,
anyway,
I don't have no fucking idea.
So we'll,

1178
01:08:03.551 --> 01:08:08.210
I coach.
Um,
no,
I wouldn't do that.
You know what,
if I was ever to coach,

1179
01:08:08.211 --> 01:08:12.670
I would be a,
I think I would be an assistant coach.

1180
01:08:12.671 --> 01:08:15.980
I'd be the Rah Rah guy if they were little and shit deck.
I couldn't fucking

1181
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.070
<v 1>sit there yelling at kids.
Um,</v>

1182
01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:20.600
and also I don't think I know enough about the fucking game.

1183
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:22.340
I've watched a bunch of sports,

1184
01:08:22.341 --> 01:08:27.080
but to actually coach a team and teach somebody how to get better,
I mean,

1185
01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:30.850
I think I'd be,
I'm,
I'll be a good dad if she wants to be a go in the backyard,

1186
01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:35.420
learn how to hit a ball or shoot some baskets.
I think I'm good at that.
But like,

1187
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:38.540
you know,
that's a hell of a responsibility.

1188
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:42.020
And I have a very volatile personality and I just,

1189
01:08:42.021 --> 01:08:44.900
I don't want to be the Earl weaver of fucking eight year olds out there

1190
01:08:44.901 --> 01:08:46.320
screaming and yell at Bull.
We'll see.

1191
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:49.850
We'll see other meditating and possibly going to therapy works out.
But

1192
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:51.463
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1193
01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.070
<v 1>I'm more excited just to see what she gravitates to.</v>

1194
01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:59.180
I'm going to expose her to as much music and different shit as I possibly can

1195
01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:01.040
and then just sort of stand back,

1196
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:06.040
see what she goes after and then just encourage her and if it's like a fee,

1197
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:10.190
if it's a phase,
it's a phase and then she moves onto something else.

1198
01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:13.730
But my parents were really cool about kind of letting us do

1199
01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.493
<v 0>mmm.</v>

1200
01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:21.400
<v 1>You know,
whatever the fuck we wanted to do.
Uh,
as far as trying shit in life.</v>

1201
01:09:21.401 --> 01:09:26.320
Like my parents never gave me shit about being a standup comedian.
And,
um,

1202
01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:28.390
<v 0>okay.</v>

1203
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:29.920
<v 1>That's pretty,
uh,
when I,
you know,</v>

1204
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:32.290
the amount of comics that I've run into where to this day,

1205
01:09:32.291 --> 01:09:35.170
like they're super successful and their parents still don't even respect what

1206
01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:38.350
they do,
thinking that they're just up there fucking around.
Um,

1207
01:09:39.730 --> 01:09:41.860
it's pretty amazing.
So I got really lucky in that department.

1208
01:09:41.861 --> 01:09:44.680
So that's one of the good things that I'm keeping from my,
uh,
my upbringing.

1209
01:09:44.681 --> 01:09:46.630
So long story short,

1210
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:48.103
<v 0>uh,</v>

1211
01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:51.550
<v 1>no,
but I will go to every fucker game.</v>

1212
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:56.050
I'll go to every game and I'm not going to argue with other parents and die if

1213
01:09:56.051 --> 01:09:59.770
the,
if the fucking referee stinks and is screwing my team,

1214
01:09:59.771 --> 01:10:02.830
I'm just going to sit there and just,
you know,
I'm,

1215
01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.660
I'm just not going to be that fucking guy.

1216
01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:10.190
I'm going to make jokes and I'm move.
I'll be laughing.
But uh,

1217
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:13.450
you know what the big thing is,
is when I go to her games,
I'm going to be sober.

1218
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:17.250
<v 5>So</v>

1219
01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:21.930
<v 1>that's gonna really toned down.
It's when I go to games that I've had a few,</v>

1220
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:25.680
I can't resist as a crowd.
There's jokes to be made.

1221
01:10:25.681 --> 01:10:29.490
Even way back in the day when I was fucking,
you know,

1222
01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.810
way more introverted.

1223
01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:35.930
I had a couple of beers and I would be Sullivan Stadium and I would yell out

1224
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.231
shit.

1225
01:10:37.231 --> 01:10:42.231
And people in my section would laugh and I would just build my confidence and

1226
01:10:42.271 --> 01:10:43.410
suck some game teams.

1227
01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:46.380
I would yell out the first thing it would bomb and then I would say anything

1228
01:10:46.381 --> 01:10:49.500
again until the third quarter and then I'd throw it out,
but only have like,

1229
01:10:49.501 --> 01:10:53.870
you know,
50% confidence.
So it only did okay.
And it'd be like my,

1230
01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.670
literally my bad setback then like bombing was,

1231
01:10:56.671 --> 01:11:01.140
I went to a game and I yelled out some shit and nobody laughed.

1232
01:11:01.141 --> 01:11:02.730
But I dunno,

1233
01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:07.500
it's not the way it used to be because everybody's so concerned about kids and

1234
01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:12.000
political correctness and fucking public drunkenness and shit.

1235
01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:13.500
But back in the day,
like

1236
01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.560
<v 6>what was going on in the field was,</v>

1237
01:11:16.561 --> 01:11:20.280
was about half as entertaining is what was going on in the stance.

1238
01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.390
It was just,
and it was all just sophomore acts stupid.

1239
01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:25.983
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1240
01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:29.030
<v 6>I remember sitting,
we had like N.
Dot.
N zones,
seats.</v>

1241
01:11:29.031 --> 01:11:30.440
We were sitting right at the corner.

1242
01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.313
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1243
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:35.310
<v 6>You know,
like past the goal line.</v>

1244
01:11:35.311 --> 01:11:39.270
We basically sitting like facing the end zone and then there was the end zone

1245
01:11:39.271 --> 01:11:43.860
seats and they used to have this beer commercial,
a light beer from Miller.

1246
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.620
And they used to have the big fights,
less filling tastes great,

1247
01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:49.320
less filling tastes like they were having a fight,
you know,

1248
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.890
over over if it didn't fill you up as much or if it tasted better.

1249
01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:57.630
So that became like this stupid thing that people did.
You'd be at,
at,
at uh,

1250
01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.230
someone figured out one time,
stood up and yelled at the other section,

1251
01:12:01.231 --> 01:12:04.980
said less filling at someone else,
stood up and screamed,
taste great.

1252
01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.590
And then we'd all be yelling like,
hey,
we're doing the commercial,

1253
01:12:07.591 --> 01:12:10.890
this is before youtube.
So this was actually fun.
So it'd be one session

1254
01:12:11.170 --> 01:12:14.150
<v 8>less.
Ellie thanks.
Glad last time.</v>

1255
01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:18.060
<v 6>Great.
In a course because it was a bunch of drunks,</v>

1256
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:23.370
drunk males.
It immediately went sophomores and it eventually became Yep,

1257
01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:28.210
<v 8>fuck you a chat.
Fuck you ain't shit.</v>

1258
01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:33.300
<v 6>And we would do that 20 times a game and it would be just as funny the 20th time</v>

1259
01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:38.050
as it was the first time cause we were all a bunch of immature fucking idiots.

1260
01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:42.100
<v 5>I miss those days,
you know,</v>

1261
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:46.190
<v 6>I really fucking Miss Duck.
That was lot of fun back then.</v>

1262
01:12:46.191 --> 01:12:48.410
Now it's just so you know the balls in play.

1263
01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.740
Don't go to your seed this from fucking old lady with a construction hat on

1264
01:12:51.741 --> 01:12:55.880
telling you to stop.
I don't know.
Ah,
I'm just a fucking curmudgeon.

1265
01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:59.270
What are you going to do?
But anyways,
uh,
that's the podcast for this week.

1266
01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:02.960
Thank you guys so much for listening and thank you everybody who's been watching

1267
01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:06.650
my special and giving me the great reviews,
um,
uh,

1268
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:10.430
really proud of this special.
And if you haven't had a chance to watch it,

1269
01:13:10.431 --> 01:13:11.660
please check it out.

1270
01:13:11.661 --> 01:13:15.680
Obviously that helps me out with my relationship with Netflix and my ability to

1271
01:13:15.681 --> 01:13:19.160
do eventually do another one.
And um,

1272
01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:21.990
if you've already seen it and you enjoyed it,
uh,

1273
01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:26.540
please tell somebody else to check it out and that's it.

1274
01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:29.600
And congratulations to the New England patriots.
Holy Shit.

1275
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:34.730
Championship number five.
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
And once again,

1276
01:13:34.731 --> 01:13:39.560
I'm not fucking around here.
My condolences to Atlanta fans.
I,
uh,

1277
01:13:39.561 --> 01:13:41.420
I have been there.
It fucking sucks.

1278
01:13:41.421 --> 01:13:43.730
But you guys got a hell of a team and I hope your back.

1279
01:13:43.731 --> 01:13:47.500
Then next year when you get you get your fucking window,
that's it.

1280
01:13:47.501 --> 01:13:49.180
Go fuck yourselves or check in on you.

1281
01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.870
Check in on you on Thursday and all you concent,

1282
01:13:52.930 --> 01:13:55.740
