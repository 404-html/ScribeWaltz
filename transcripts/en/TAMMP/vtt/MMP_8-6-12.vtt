10
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.280
it's probably been,
I mean,
we didn't,

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.600
we never did too many gigs together or anything like that.
We were always,

12
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:44.580
you know,
you were doing your thing.
I was doing mine

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.950
<v 1>in Jersey and I was,
uh,
the suburbs of Boston,

14
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.210
uh,
you Norton Voss,
that whole crew,
even though Voss probably started in the 70s,

15
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.420
but I'm just like,

16
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.150
you guys Kinda had the same thing where you weren't in New York City.

17
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:03.840
Like we both had to like migrate there.
Um,
and I,

18
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:05.340
and I feel like when I started coming,

19
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:08.400
I started coming down in New York with Patrice and like 94,

20
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:12.750
95 moved there and like 95.
And um,

21
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.420
<v 0>yeah,</v>

22
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.400
<v 1>I don't think I saw you when you had the long hair.</v>

23
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.050
I think you had your hair cut by then,
didn't you?

24
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.351
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:22.351
Well 92 93 is when me and Norton try to start hit going in New York City and

26
00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:26.410
just,
you know,
what part of she,
yeah.
And then about 94,
95,

27
00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:28.720
but whenever a Kurt Cobain came out like 93,

28
00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:32.410
late [inaudible] 94 when he died or when he came,
when the,
when,
when did,
uh,

29
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.960
he came out to like 96 though,
right?
No,

30
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.580
<v 1>he came out in September of [inaudible] 91 and then he died in April 94.</v>

31
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.550
And I only know that because of a,

32
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.130
<v 0>okay,</v>

33
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.940
<v 1>my love of metal and metal was over and all of a sudden I thought he was a dose</v>

34
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.810
when I first saw him,

35
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:52.380
when he was doing like making fun of the tap on Solos and that smells like teen

36
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:55.230
spirit.
I knew he was making fun of metal and I just was,

37
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:56.580
I thought the guy was a dick.

38
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.880
I'm one of the few people who had met set because everybody,
see,

39
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:01.140
I've talked about this in the podcast,

40
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:04.410
people seem to like when they bring up that nirvana album,

41
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.580
nevermind everybody seems to act like they knew that this,

42
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.640
that there was going to be this total shift in music and you know,

43
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:14.910
there was something in the air and all that and it was just,
it took,

44
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.670
I didn't get nirvana until after in utero and then I saw him in a,

45
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.740
when they did unplugged and right as I started to like him,

46
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.910
a cart killed himself.

47
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.200
<v 2>Yeah.
The,
I think it's all going to that album and the beginning of the,</v>

48
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:28.520
I don't want,
you know where it's weird about that.

49
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:31.070
It's like everyone thinks that that was the album that changed.

50
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.790
I mean it kind of was,
but it wasn't their music specifically.

51
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:39.791
It was MTV and radio decided that that metal wasn't cool anymore and then we're

52
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:43.490
going to stop playing.
You know what?
I haven't really like collectively,

53
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:47.960
like that is amazing that that album came out.
And the second that came out,

54
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.820
it was like all of a sudden all the bands I was watching weren't on MTV anymore.

55
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.570
I remember even

56
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.880
<v 1>Donna was bitching,
uh,</v>

57
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.670
she had some fucking catty little interview with Kurt Loder and uh,

58
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.270
he's like,
yeah,
you haven't made a too many videos off of this album.
She goes,

59
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.240
well,
why should I make them?
You guys don't show them any way.

60
00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:08.800
You don't show my videos anymore.
And he and a,

61
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.680
she kind of went right at them and then MTV,

62
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:15.310
like a bunch of pussies started showing her videos like right after that.

63
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.310
Like I would have been like,
yeah,
well fuck you.
You're old now.
Yeah,

64
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:21.620
I was a lowly,
but no,
what happened was they,
um,
you know,

65
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.650
and then Pearl Jam came about the same time.

66
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.220
They just saw MTV basically decided what,
what was popular and then,

67
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.300
and then every radio,

68
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:31.360
as soon as they started playing nirvana and Pearl Jam and it was the hot,

69
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.660
the new video,
every radio program across the country goes,
okay,

70
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:37.510
that's what we got to play now.
And they just totally discarded the metal.

71
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.950
So it wasn't that happen though.

72
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:43.270
Like they have like some fucking Bilderberg group of like radio stations.

73
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.510
Like they have like a conference yet year it's,

74
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.900
there's this one guy like you know,

75
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:50.650
one big program are probably the guy from fucking z 100 in New York,
right.

76
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.630
Whatever that Douche bag was.
And he started going,

77
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.050
well you know what Nirvana is the newer pearl jam and then everybody other radio

78
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:58.960
station.
What's New York ply in an La,
he's playing this all,

79
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:01.510
we got to play it and then they just copy.
It's just,
you know,

80
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.300
it's like the TV business one show successful on the try to put 50 more out.

81
00:04:05.301 --> 00:04:07.720
Like,
cause I remember that that was a overnight.

82
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.080
And I know I'm old now so I don't pay attention to like music changing.

83
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.900
But that's the last time I remember,
it was just like,

84
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:17.010
I thought it was going to be like headbangers ball and fucking,

85
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.750
you'd remember that the top,
uh,
what was that thing that,

86
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:23.290
that guy to tried to dress like a headbanger but wasn't the guy was from like

87
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:28.180
fucking Sweden.
I'm that European guy with the blonde hair and I'm Cari.
Yeah,

88
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:31.430
yeah.
No,
no.
Is he not when the race was that one of the original guys know,

89
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.230
he was like the guy to wear a leather jacket.

90
00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:37.250
We had to fluff up like Blonde Farrah Fawcett hair.
Yeah.
That was Adam Carr.
Yeah.

91
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.240
So he used the host,
that top 10 thing,
and I swear to God,

92
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.960
like the top 10 was like eight metal videos.

93
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:47.860
And like maybe Janet Jackson would slip in or fucking Jody Watley.

94
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.350
They'd be like one RMB thing.
And uh,

95
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:53.160
and then some like new kids on the block thing or something like that.
And,

96
00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:57.190
and then the rest of it was all fucking guns and roses,
skid row.

97
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.070
And I thought it was going to be like that forever,
obviously.
I mean,

98
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:03.910
it was a young kid.
I didn't know that music changed.
I thought disco suck,

99
00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:06.080
but I have to bring this up.
I talked to you,
right,

100
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.940
right before we started this thing was how I was trashing a lot of the metal

101
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.360
videos that I saw.
I came home one night,

102
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.390
like a late at night and I put on like VH one and I was astounded at how bad

103
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.950
some of the music was that I listened to.
And some of the videos,

104
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:27.640
like there was one quiet riot one where they actually sort of wrapped or did

105
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:31.360
some sort of scratching before their song came on.

106
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.820
I want to say it was about Russia.
I don't know if,
I don't know.

107
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.640
It must have been later one.
I combined shit but I like,
I don't know.

108
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:42.280
Some people think,
I don't know that I don't like metal.
I like it,

109
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.710
but I don't look at it like,
like with like,
uh,
just you know,
with blinders on.

110
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.630
No,
no.
I mean if you look back at those videos,

111
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:52.140
cause the VH one classic plays them all time metal mania.

112
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.170
I'll play like four hours.
I'm did a fucking awful Ronnie James Dio,
you know,

113
00:05:56.171 --> 00:05:58.070
I love Ronnie.
He was great dude.
And you

114
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.881
<v 2>know,
I personally know,</v>

115
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:02.870
but walking around with a sword and fighting these demons and you know I was

116
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.850
saying come on you,

117
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.480
you're playing him that he's going through the woods and he says,
hey dude,

118
00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:09.740
you met where they will out though when you were a kid you thought they were

119
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:13.430
sick,
were like,
did you see the new deal video dude,
it's fucking unreal.
Yeah.

120
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.720
And then you know they always,

121
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:18.040
and then the other like the poisons is always at the hot chick in there to warn.

122
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.400
So always had that.
It's like Holy Shit.
Do you see it on hot man?

123
00:06:20.401 --> 00:06:22.910
Is She fucking hot?
You look back six,
she's not that hot.

124
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.330
<v 1>No,
no they will all they will often.</v>

125
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.020
<v 2>It's funny cause we're going to have a Nana,
Nancy,
Nancy,</v>

126
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.710
Nancy and Ann Wilson from hard on our show and a couple of days and me and my

127
00:06:31.711 --> 00:06:32.131
friend Eddie,

128
00:06:32.131 --> 00:06:35.640
we're talking to how we used to jerk off to Nancy Wilson cause she had the big

129
00:06:35.641 --> 00:06:40.610
tits and she had to cleavage,
you know,
never is at the redhead.
Yeah,
yeah.

130
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.640
Just anyone.
Yeah.
They always had the tits out.
You know,

131
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.350
they had to in the eighties and I was like that was,

132
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.030
that's what I jerked off to an 87 88 do

133
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.880
<v 1>you remember when the other one got real fat and they tried to shoot around it</v>

134
00:06:50.881 --> 00:06:54.520
by doing like an extreme closeup of her face?
Yeah.
Yeah.

135
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.850
And they tried everything that they could,
she went,

136
00:06:56.851 --> 00:07:00.600
she was sort of like the original like fat chick from like Wilson Phillips.
Yeah,

137
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.900
yeah.
That she had like the,

138
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.480
I don't like when people get fat and they complain about this business and the

139
00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:08.430
pressure to stay in shape.

140
00:07:08.431 --> 00:07:13.290
It's like you want to be on a stage and eat whatever you want and it doesn't

141
00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:16.650
work that way.
You'll have to come into this business of fat.
Fuck.

142
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.300
Like if you come in that way like,
hey,
it's the fat fuck,
then you're,

143
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.850
you're all good,
but you can't become fat in this business.
You're going to,

144
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:29.250
you know,
you're going to get trashed.
Yeah,
absolutely.
I mean,
yeah,
she was,

145
00:07:29.251 --> 00:07:32.820
she was hot in the 70s and she will,
she definitely put it on.
I was,

146
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.320
I was reading an article on them.

147
00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:38.850
They were saying how the record company was so afraid to tell her just to lose

148
00:07:38.851 --> 00:07:40.770
weight that she was the record company,
you know,

149
00:07:40.771 --> 00:07:45.210
brought the band in without her and said please talk to her because we don't

150
00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:47.490
want to want to piss her off,
but she has to lose weight.
Right.

151
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.560
And the band went to,
when she got so fucking pissed,

152
00:07:49.561 --> 00:07:51.900
she left the record company at the time,
I think it was capitol,

153
00:07:51.901 --> 00:07:54.330
she like fuck them.
And she was wearing like,

154
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.600
these were all like that leather and stuff.
It's not a good thing.

155
00:07:57.601 --> 00:08:00.590
There's been a couple people who got fed.
George Thorogood got fat.
Yeah.

156
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.620
I still wore those,

157
00:08:01.621 --> 00:08:05.850
those snake skin leather pants and went to some fucking blues festival and he

158
00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:08.430
was there and he came up with these fucking things.
Dude,

159
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.630
he looked like he just had a kid.
It was,
it was awful.

160
00:08:12.631 --> 00:08:14.550
And it was like one of those things where it's like,
dude,

161
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.900
you got to do something where a button down and some jeans and hit the fucking

162
00:08:18.901 --> 00:08:23.250
treadmill.
It's just one of those,
if you like,
in this business.
Absolutely.

163
00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:26.710
You can't,
you can't,
um,
you know,
losing your hair or anything,
you know,
like that.

164
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.050
So I still have mine and I'm just saying,
fuck it.
I'm just letting it go.
Yeah.

165
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.290
Yeah.
It started,
I'm starting to go in the back and I'm just like,
uh,
I can't,

166
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:35.831
what am I gonna do?

167
00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:40.140
I'm a scalp the back of my head and then have that shit put in the front.
I just,

168
00:08:40.141 --> 00:08:43.080
I,
this is why I look at it,
you know,

169
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:47.130
if I was going to be the next Brad Pitt,
it would have happened by now.

170
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.730
I'm fucking,
you know,
it's like I'm 44 years old.

171
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.690
What am I gonna fucking be some 50 year old sex symbol.
You know,

172
00:08:54.691 --> 00:08:59.220
I'd be the just the,
uh,
I,
you know,
dude,
I do a podcast.

173
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:03.150
I told jokes I'm,
I'm good.
I can write,
I can make my fucking rent.

174
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.810
I don't need to go there and get my fucking face yanked back and have some pubes

175
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:10.350
taken from fucking my Dick.
And he stuck on my head.
I mean then the,

176
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.770
no matter what,
this business is going to be finished with me at some point.

177
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.460
So I've kind of made a rule that I am going to try to look like a fucking human

178
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:21.140
being at the end of this.
Um,
you know,
unless,
uh,

179
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.890
unless they so get like the facelift down.

180
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.710
If they get it down where you actually can still look like a human being.

181
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.410
Like I've been talking lately on stage.
You have you seen that,

182
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:34.710
that synergenic so whatever it is,
you know,
like those guys,

183
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:38.400
I look that shit up like those old guys who were shredded.
It's fucking,

184
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:41.160
they are on HGH.
That's what I thought it was.
Yeah.
There are,

185
00:09:41.161 --> 00:09:43.620
there are their on fucking,
that's why that guy has that tone.

186
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:46.500
Like he wants to fight his kids in better shape.
My kids,

187
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:48.690
he feels like he's getting ready to snap.

188
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:54.120
So like don't they say that that's like cancer causing like that the,

189
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:57.900
the HGH.
So like those guys,
that's this first wave of old guys.

190
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.170
They're probably gonna fucking something bad's going to happen in four to five

191
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:03.930
years and then they'll use them as Guinea pigs.

192
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:07.140
So I figured by the time we get there,
it's like Roy,

193
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:10.590
it's now like back when we were kids roids you know the shrinking of balls up,

194
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:14.790
you got fucking titties,
it was horrible and then you fucking died and now,

195
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.780
but now they got that,
that synthetic stuff,
they got the clear they get,

196
00:10:17.781 --> 00:10:21.780
they just keep making it better.
So real quick,
if they,

197
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.790
if they come up with a fucking pill for a full head of hair or you know anything

198
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.910
or if it just feels like your head's on fire for a minute,
I would do it.

199
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.730
But like as far as like scalping the back of my head,

200
00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:33.840
there's no fucking way doing that.

201
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.610
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean,
yeah,
I'm on the fence about that too.
I mean,
yeah,</v>

202
00:10:37.611 --> 00:10:41.380
I mean there's never been a sex symbol at all of a sudden that 44 now,

203
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.530
even George Clooney up made it like 32 or 33 and that was like late.

204
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.800
He was all he was,

205
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.330
he was around for 10 years doing a little bit parts and all of a sudden they got

206
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.340
er or whatever,
and then he became a sexist.

207
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.660
<v 1>And plus the advantage of kind of being a mess is no one really pays attention</v>

208
00:10:56.661 --> 00:11:00.440
to your aging as much as like,
like if you're in that people magazine,

209
00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:04.290
50 most beautiful people.
People always say the funny shit that,
oh my God,

210
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.420
you see so and so what happened

211
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.450
<v 2>her,
what happened to him?
It's like,
dude,
what the fuck happened to you?</v>

212
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.930
You're like,
you think you're like,
you know,
under glass not aging.
So yeah,

213
00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:13.130
you're right.
You're right.
I just,

214
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.680
I try to keep it as low maintenance as possible.

215
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.900
Jeans and a tee shirt and fucking whatever,

216
00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:20.900
and I'm brushing my hair and I'll fucking do anything I don't want makeup on

217
00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:23.120
when I go on TV.
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

218
00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:24.860
We had that God seriously I go to,
I don't,

219
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:25.821
<v 1>you know what's funny?</v>

220
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:29.200
I like how we're acting like being a sex symbol is actually an option.

221
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.960
<v 2>Yeah,
I know.
Like where to go going,
no,
we don't want that.</v>

222
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.880
If we just took care of ourselves a little better.

223
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.440
Well speaking of book will look,

224
00:11:35.441 --> 00:11:38.470
when I was late eighties early nineties when I had long hair,

225
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.270
I took like Bon Jovi's,

226
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.560
whatever style he had or David Coverdale from Whitesnake and I got a lot of

227
00:11:44.561 --> 00:11:45.191
fucking ass.

228
00:11:45.191 --> 00:11:48.850
So I was almost considered a sex symbol back then even though I wasn't,

229
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.020
but you can be a local sex symbol.

230
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:56.870
I was in Pennsylvania was a fucking 12 on a scale of one to 10 because they were

231
00:11:56.871 --> 00:12:00.790
still five years behind the hall.
Like,
Hey,
you know,
long hair thing.

232
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:03.670
So I would do all these gigs out in Pennsylvania.
Just fucking clean up.

233
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.860
<v 1>That's hilarious.
Do you ever go back there?
Like,
is that like your Germany,</v>

234
00:12:06.861 --> 00:12:09.770
like David Hasselhoff and you ever just go back to Pennsylvania and do like a

235
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.270
book signing or something?

236
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.200
<v 2>But no,
because once I cut my hair to cut me off,
they no longer liked boys over.</v>

237
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.510
They were mad.
They'll just like,

238
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.550
remember when Metallica cut their hair all the half their fans were pissed.

239
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.330
They fucking cut their hair.
What Felicity?
Yeah.
Who Cares?
Oh,

240
00:12:23.331 --> 00:12:26.090
sort of desks going to change your music.
So when I,
yeah,
they turned it on,

241
00:12:26.091 --> 00:12:27.110
made Pennsylvania too.

242
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.030
<v 1>Before all my listeners trashed me for knowing the Felicity thing.</v>

243
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.700
I took an acting class with a girl who was on the show.

244
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.720
It was some show called Felicity and every guy like 14 year old boy loved this

245
00:12:36.721 --> 00:12:41.140
girl Felicity.
And then she,
she got her,
uh,
uh,
you know,

246
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.300
I'm going to play softball now.
Haircut and the whole fucking show tanked.

247
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.670
And this actress was a little bit older,
so she was,

248
00:12:47.671 --> 00:12:52.380
she came in just bitch and one day because she finally had a fucking regular gig

249
00:12:52.381 --> 00:12:56.280
or something like that.
She wasn't like one of the main people.
Uh,
but you know,

250
00:12:56.281 --> 00:12:57.240
she was on like free,

251
00:12:57.241 --> 00:13:00.150
full fucking episodes of season and this chick cut her hair and like a hundred

252
00:13:00.151 --> 00:13:01.320
people lost their jobs.

253
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.780
<v 2>Well,
yeah.
So that's how I know what people see.
I could see that.</v>

254
00:13:05.781 --> 00:13:09.800
I remember when Cheryl,
I always start show pro was hot.
I always heard something.

255
00:13:09.801 --> 00:13:12.770
She's on that memo when she came out with that fucking soccer mom hair do for

256
00:13:12.771 --> 00:13:16.470
like a year,
not all off it.
It was really short.
It fuck is you look now

257
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.420
<v 1>do that.
You can't,
as a woman,</v>

258
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.980
if you come into the business fuckable hot or whatever,

259
00:13:22.981 --> 00:13:26.160
you have to look that way.
The whole,
it's the same thing.

260
00:13:26.161 --> 00:13:30.840
It's the same thing like,
uh,
um,
even as a guy,
as a guy,

261
00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:31.860
if you're coming in and you know,

262
00:13:31.861 --> 00:13:34.770
you're all shredded and you have abs in that type of Shit,
you got it.

263
00:13:34.771 --> 00:13:38.640
You have to,
you can't get fat,
you know what I mean?
Unless you,

264
00:13:38.641 --> 00:13:41.490
I guess you pulling some,
uh,
trying to win an Oscar,
but you can,

265
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.960
but you then have to go back and lose the fuck away.
Absolutely.

266
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.980
That's the thing too.
So if I look like fucking Ron Howard,
you know,
it's,

267
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.350
I've basically,
I realized now that I'm losing my hair,

268
00:13:52.351 --> 00:13:54.330
that I'm going to look like him my whole fucking life,

269
00:13:54.331 --> 00:13:59.010
which is really disappointing.
Um,
that,
you know,
there's no,
uh,

270
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.630
you know,
there's no fucking problem,

271
00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.650
<v 2>but you're,
you're 44.
I mean,
you'll,
you know,
one,
do you think it might,</v>

272
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.830
the career might start slowing down.
Do you think you got to at least 50,
50?

273
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.770
<v 1>I think it would say what you think it's going to start,
um,</v>

274
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.470
doing what I'm doing right.
If I just do it,

275
00:14:13.471 --> 00:14:15.180
if I make money off my podcast and I make,

276
00:14:15.181 --> 00:14:18.030
and I just keep putting out specials every couple of years,
I'm fucking good.

277
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:22.590
But my free time is priceless.
Like,
uh,

278
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.040
you know,
you get into this fucking business and they start going,
I want,

279
00:14:26.041 --> 00:14:26.461
you know,

280
00:14:26.461 --> 00:14:30.480
like you just think that you want a TV show and then I know you get kind of

281
00:14:30.481 --> 00:14:31.920
close to it and uh,
I mean,

282
00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:35.730
I don't know like you'll show if I was going to do one,
I like to show like,

283
00:14:35.731 --> 00:14:39.000
Yo is that metal show where it's like it's that's taped and pretty much real

284
00:14:39.001 --> 00:14:41.340
time,
right?
Maybe a couple of pickups or whatever.

285
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.730
And in real time for people not in show business he ever,
it's just basically,

286
00:14:44.731 --> 00:14:45.450
you know,

287
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.230
30 minutes show is shot in like 30 minutes and maybe if there's a couple of

288
00:14:49.231 --> 00:14:51.170
flubs if you said the name of the Amalgam wrong,

289
00:14:51.171 --> 00:14:53.570
you might have to go back and rerecord that.
But like,
uh,

290
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:58.550
those one hour one cameras,
those are,
that's 12 hours a day.

291
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.550
Like five,
six days,
I think it was at five days a week.
They shoot,

292
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.620
they shoot an episode every four days and they start the next one Friday and you

293
00:15:04.621 --> 00:15:09.470
just keep going.
I Dunno,
I guess it's like three months of your life,

294
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.490
right.
I'm to,
uh,
I,

295
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.970
I would rather just go slug it out in a strip mall and just make money that way

296
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.280
and then just come back here and then fucking play guitar or fuck around.

297
00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:25.550
Absolutely.
Men.
Um,
I love taking time off.
You know,
you got to do it.

298
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.820
Absolutely.
Just,
you know,
cause I was always like,
even I'd work on holidays,

299
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:31.970
I'd feel like if I didn't get onstage in two days,
I'm like,
what am I doing man?

300
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:35.810
Fuck,
I ain't gotta be Rusty Shit.
I'm like,
what am I,
what am I doing my career?

301
00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:39.570
Everybody's passing me by and now I'm like,
gives a shit.
Yeah.
No.

302
00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:41.810
Now you've got to like when you guys tape,

303
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.750
like you were out here right now in Los Angeles to tape.
Uh,
like how,

304
00:15:45.751 --> 00:15:48.170
how many of that meant to do what we're doing six episodes.

305
00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:50.900
This we already taped to a few months ago,
whatever they're going to put them.

306
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.140
But yeah,
we take two episodes in a day.
We take from three to seven.

307
00:15:54.141 --> 00:15:54.974
We knocked out two,

308
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.550
two hour episodes and four hours basically were like an hour break in between.

309
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.550
So week.
That's awesome.
Yeah,
we just pop them out and I noticed shit.

310
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.320
You know what I mean?
It's not like I got to study it.

311
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.920
We got guys from iron maiden and shit coming on,
which I've been fans for years.

312
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.730
Like I'm just interviewed one of my idols and does it,
you know,

313
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.320
a camera on which is awesome.
Jesus Christ.

314
00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:16.640
It's not too much research you like you've quietly created,

315
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.990
you created the cocreator on this show that no,
but no,

316
00:16:20.991 --> 00:16:24.890
I mean I pitched it with uh,
you know,
my buddy Eddie trunk,

317
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.370
he's a Dj in New York and he's been on for awhile and worked at record labels

318
00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:31.670
and stuff.
We became friends.
I go on his radio show and we just,
you know,

319
00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:34.790
debate metal and he goes,
I'm going to try to get this as a TV show.

320
00:16:34.791 --> 00:16:38.810
I'm going to be,
that guy is on like a whole other level.

321
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:43.340
Like he has to be the biggest metal fan ever.
That guy,

322
00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:48.290
like I like he takes it all,
like really like seriously.

323
00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:48.610
Like,

324
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:53.030
I feel like if I could get into a debate with him and he could actually convince

325
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:57.080
me that kiss is just as relevant as the Beatles.
Oh yeah.
Hey,

326
00:16:57.081 --> 00:17:01.460
can I get a little like I am seeing,
I mean I can sit there like I love ACDC,

327
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.930
right?
Uh,
but I mean they're not on the same level as the Beatles.
They just not,

328
00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:09.110
you know what I mean?
Like it's,
they're just not,
no,
no.
I love those guys.

329
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:10.020
I'm not trying to,
no,

330
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.340
I luck they right bands or anything and I love those guys to death by the way.

331
00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:15.620
I thought that was hilarious.
The way they describe your,
uh,
your show,

332
00:17:15.621 --> 00:17:19.220
at least on Wikipedia and they said,
uh,
that that metal show is the,
uh,

333
00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:21.320
the tonight show for ACDC fans.

334
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.380
That's the greatest phrase after who came up with that,

335
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.920
I know someone in a review,
someone that came there,
show him,

336
00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:31.100
reviewed it or something,
cause they want the VH one mom to say it's,
it's,
uh,

337
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:36.230
it's a cross between a view headbangers ball and the veal.
I'm like,

338
00:17:36.231 --> 00:17:37.800
get that fucking nobody.
I go,

339
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.760
no one that likes hard rock or metal watches the view once,

340
00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:43.940
not don't say that tickle knowledge.
It's successful show when they're like,

341
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.610
and they wanted me to set that and interviews and I would never say it and like

342
00:17:46.611 --> 00:17:49.470
they were getting really pissed.
Like he's got tell them to say it's car.
I go,

343
00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:53.250
I'm never saying that.
What is wrong with them?
Just them in general.

344
00:17:53.251 --> 00:17:55.770
See that's right.
When I hear stories like that,
I just like,

345
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.370
how do you just not go?
That is the dumbest fucking idea.

346
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.340
[inaudible] you know what I,

347
00:18:01.341 --> 00:18:04.890
I just feel like sometimes they just have to say something to justify the fact

348
00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:08.070
that they have a desk.
Because if they,
if there's,
if there's,

349
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:12.510
they just want to be like,
oh it's,
it's uh,
headbangers ball meets the view.

350
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:13.590
I came up with that,

351
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.540
that was my contribution to that show and now I want to go create something
else.

352
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:19.740
I guess that's how they go up.

353
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.280
I'm really not trying to sound like a bitter asshole,
but I am here.

354
00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:26.670
You have to be,
cause it's like,
come on,
we know.
Like no,
I that fan base,

355
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:29.930
when I go to an Oz fest I can go up to 20,000 people.

356
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.870
Do you watch the view and the fucking about 19,000 would punch me in the face.

357
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:38.550
Yeah we're going to ask it.
I'm not.
No one would say yes.
So why are we going?

358
00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:41.300
It's a cross between a headbanger as well and the view it as soon as the guy,

359
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.940
if I saw that,
cause I was telling my golf,
I saw that,
I call the view,

360
00:18:44.941 --> 00:18:47.220
I'm not watching that.
And you know what their thought is,

361
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.970
their thought is well this is a very male demographic.

362
00:18:50.971 --> 00:18:52.650
We got to get the females in there.

363
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:57.210
So then they throw in the view and just they can't,
you know what it is.

364
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.020
They can never make enough fucking money.
They just never make an enough,

365
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.920
they always have to do it and then they got to add some extra fucking thing and

366
00:19:04.921 --> 00:19:06.180
then when it nose dives,

367
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.240
then they'd put it on you and then you would have to bear that cross once you on

368
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.760
that show.
That was like the view.
But you had Ozzie on it and he'd be like,

369
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.750
that wasn't the idea of,
you know,
the other person gets to just skate away.

370
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:23.580
I know I've been lucky because um,
you know,
to producer gets it and you know,

371
00:19:23.581 --> 00:19:25.050
we fought for,
what would they real?

372
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:27.960
I think originally they want it to be like a rock of ages type thing.

373
00:19:27.961 --> 00:19:30.330
The goof on the eighties metal.

374
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.590
They wanted us to basically dressed in spandex and put wigs on and you know,

375
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.950
go that stuff.
And we're like,
absolutely not.

376
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.250
We're three fucking guys would know energy.
We're not physical.

377
00:19:41.251 --> 00:19:44.670
We just sit there and we'll talk heavy metal.
But I don't,

378
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:49.260
we don't make anything bigger.
I'm not,
we're not flashy.
We don't throw kicks.

379
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.280
I got to admit,

380
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.940
I've been real jealous watching some of the people you've gotten to talk to.

381
00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:56.880
Like just knowing you have iron maiden.
Iron maiden is one of my big,

382
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.060
like I fucked up that I didn't go see them.

383
00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:03.330
I could have seen them on the power slave tour.
I forget what it was.

384
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:05.210
My Dad was pissed at me as something I,

385
00:20:05.211 --> 00:20:09.900
I fucked up like two weekends before and somebody had another ticket and it was

386
00:20:09.901 --> 00:20:12.600
like,
you know,
I was young enough where I still had to ask permission.

387
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.650
It's still living at home like 16,
17.
And I was just like,
uh,
yeah,

388
00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:19.920
I got to let the old man cool off for an I.
I can't make that one.
And uh,

389
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.810
I actually think my friends didn't even make it to the show.

390
00:20:21.811 --> 00:20:26.550
They got so hammered.
My friends were idiots.
But,
uh,
that's one of the big ones.

391
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:30.700
And you,
I saw one time I was flipping through and I saw,
uh,

392
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.780
you had Jason Bonham on and uh,
you know,

393
00:20:33.781 --> 00:20:37.950
I'm John Bonham freak and I met him one time at Guitar Center in somewhere in

394
00:20:37.951 --> 00:20:42.390
Florida.
I Dunno why he was in there.
He was living down in,
um,
uh,

395
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.300
Fort Lauderdale coral springs for a while.
You think he still lives down there,

396
00:20:45.301 --> 00:20:49.360
Jason.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
Well I ran into him and he was cool as hell.

397
00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:51.700
He liked comedy and I got this like,
you know,

398
00:20:51.701 --> 00:20:54.670
cell phone pictures back then was like a flip camera and they usually awful.

399
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:56.560
Somehow it was fucking great.

400
00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.930
It was just this awesome picture of me and Jason Bonham.

401
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:03.610
And then I left the fucking cell phone in the Goddamn cab on the way to the

402
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:06.850
airport and I had never sent it to me.
Oh,
uh,
sent it,
uh,

403
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:11.020
emailed it to myself or anything.
So I was flipping through the fucking channels.

404
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.320
Dude,
I'm such a jump on them like freak that when like,

405
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.570
like when I shook Jason's hand,

406
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.320
like I was thinking like he shook his dad's hand at some point he had to,

407
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.990
if you know,
like you walk around going,
Hey dad,
but it just like,

408
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.310
I literally felt like a,
I dunno,
I was like the biggest fan boy ever.

409
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:31.360
So when I saw that you had them on the show him on the show as it's like Jesus

410
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.650
Christ,
I mean,
I would,
I,

411
00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.940
that guy would have like had to call security if I actually got to sit down and

412
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:39.880
ask them.
And it would be like 50 million questions about his dad,

413
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:42.880
but she's probably sick of answering.
Um,

414
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.600
<v 2>I think he,
um,
you know,
he doesn't mind that though.</v>

415
00:21:45.601 --> 00:21:46.930
He went out and does it holds up one thing.

416
00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:49.590
And supposedly I heard from a reliable source,

417
00:21:49.591 --> 00:21:53.010
there's going to be something going on with Zeplin at the end of the year.
Oh,

418
00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:54.220
is that right?
Yeah,
I don't,

419
00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.020
the guy wouldn't say what he's like a famous photographer was really close with

420
00:21:58.021 --> 00:21:58.890
Jimmy page.

421
00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.800
<v 1>Well,
I thought,
I thought Jason Played Great,
uh,</v>

422
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.680
during that last reunion that they did for the head,

423
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.570
the head of Atlantic records when he died.
Yeah.
And what I loved was,
uh,
he just,

424
00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.340
he,
he was doing like an amalgam of like studio and live shitty heard his dad do.

425
00:22:13.341 --> 00:22:18.200
Plus he had,
he had a lot of him in it.
Like I thought that he wasn't,

426
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.450
I mean,
that's got to be terrifying because like Zeplin fans and like drummers,

427
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.780
like,
um,
I hate,
like,
I look at like,

428
00:22:26.781 --> 00:22:29.900
there's a lot of people do like drunk crop covers on youtube and they'll do a

429
00:22:29.901 --> 00:22:32.570
drum cover of like a fucking,
you know,

430
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:37.280
some Zeppelin song and somebody will kill it and someone will be like,
good job.

431
00:22:37.281 --> 00:22:39.320
But there's only one John Bond him.

432
00:22:39.321 --> 00:22:42.980
It's like everybody knows that this guy doesn't think he's fucking John Bonham.

433
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.740
He just loves the guy.
And,

434
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.200
and it inspired him to learn how to play drums and learn how to place.

435
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.920
I've even seen it,
I'm like,
Jason,
Jason's Barnum Hall,
have like,
you know,

436
00:22:51.921 --> 00:22:54.890
him playing drums and he's fucking killing it.
And some would be like,
you know,

437
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.210
<v 2>yeah,
but he's nowhere near his dad and it's like nobody is right.</v>

438
00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.370
And he doesn't have a tee shirt saying,

439
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.150
I'm really near to my dad when it comes to drums.

440
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.830
It's just so fucking annoying.
Um,
and I don't even know why I read the comments.

441
00:23:09.831 --> 00:23:13.310
I just,
I think I just read them just to see that.
Just to get mad though.

442
00:23:13.311 --> 00:23:17.780
Of course.
If John was still around and Jason took Jay,
John Goes,

443
00:23:17.781 --> 00:23:20.900
I'm at a Zepplin and they hired Jason to play drums.
Then you'd go,
hey,

444
00:23:20.901 --> 00:23:25.460
you know you need his dad back.
There is no right.
No John,
but he's not around.

445
00:23:25.461 --> 00:23:28.330
What are you going to do?
So fucking just let Jason [inaudible] Jason.
Right.

446
00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:28.970
Which is why I don't

447
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:33.410
<v 1>mine.
When people trash Wolfgang van Halen.
I want Michael Anthony back there.</v>

448
00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.580
It's fucking annoying.
They finally got David Lee Roth back in.
Just

449
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.680
<v 2>get Michael Anthony back in there.
You can never,
he can,
they get,</v>

450
00:23:41.681 --> 00:23:46.190
that will never happen.
How does Eddie throw his son out of the band?
Oh yeah.

451
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.850
You know what I mean?
That's the problem.
And Alex's Day uncle,

452
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.720
he has to leave.
He's got to throw his son thing has to leave.
You know,

453
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.430
Michael's don't want a shell.
Michael and Sam are doing our show this week.
Oh,

454
00:23:58.431 --> 00:24:01.700
where were they going to be at work?
They're taping our show.
Oh,
I think is that,

455
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:04.990
uh,
this week?
Yeah.
I'll do you want to come out?
If you're around,

456
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.650
you want to come in a tape and I miss everything.
When is it?
Like why?

457
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.260
I think it was Wednesday.
Wednesday,
of course.

458
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:15.240
<v 3>Okay,
so it's time for a little advertising.</v>

459
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.750
Um,
all right,
people stamps.com.
Here we go.

460
00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.020
There are too many what ifs.
When you go to the post office,

461
00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:26.830
what if there's traffic or what if you can't find parking?
Oh,

462
00:24:26.831 --> 00:24:30.790
what if there's some smelly sob holding the door?

463
00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:35.530
Mommy,
I don't want to go in there.
He's smelly.
I don't care,
Judy.

464
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:40.120
Things get smelly in life.
You need to push past this.
I married your father.

465
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.140
This is our situation.
Get in there and get the stamps right.

466
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.740
No one wants to go through that.
What if it's closed when you get there?

467
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.820
What if you're too dumb to realize the sun went down and you don't realize that

468
00:24:51.821 --> 00:24:53.350
they're not in the post office anymore?

469
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.190
You understand here there's a lot of what ifs with their limited hours.

470
00:24:57.191 --> 00:25:02.140
You never know.
Avoid all that hassle.
Just use stamps.com what's that bill?

471
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.380
What is stamps.com?
Well,
I'll tell you,
you son of a gun,

472
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.040
a stamps.com is basically bringing the post office into your home,

473
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.990
your apartment,
your flat,
your duplex,
um,

474
00:25:12.991 --> 00:25:16.000
your tented city with stamps.com.
Anything you can,

475
00:25:16.001 --> 00:25:17.440
anything you can do with the post office,

476
00:25:17.441 --> 00:25:21.490
you can now do from the convenience of your own desk.
I've done it.
It's awesome.

477
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:26.320
You can buy and print official US postage using your own computer and printer.

478
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.920
It's great.
You feel like the king of the world,
uh,

479
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.730
get exact postage for any letter or package whenever you need it,
right?

480
00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:38.320
24,
seven,
unlike the post office,
stamps.com never closes.

481
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:39.783
Okay.

482
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:44.140
And you don't have to look at somebody's stupid face when you walk up there.

483
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.760
You know when they put that little thing,
sorry,

484
00:25:45.761 --> 00:25:50.080
this window's closed and you want to beat him with that little side.
Um,
anyways,

485
00:25:50.081 --> 00:25:53.230
I actually use stamps.com.
That's how I send out all of my DVDs.

486
00:25:53.231 --> 00:25:55.120
I put on a little almond,
a mailroom hat,

487
00:25:55.121 --> 00:26:00.100
and I weigh my DVDs and I send them off to a strip mall near you so I can then

488
00:26:00.101 --> 00:26:00.461
go out.

489
00:26:00.461 --> 00:26:04.810
Dance like a monkey and hopefully whore myself out after the shell and sell the

490
00:26:04.811 --> 00:26:08.560
DVDs.
But that's another sad story.

All right.

500
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:41.800
It's like the end of one of those nerdy movies.

501
00:26:41.801 --> 00:26:46.500
When you finally find a little thing.
Did I just mess it up at the end there?

502
00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:52.110
All right,
whatever stamps.com do it.
If you want to something for you,

503
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.500
he voiced everybody.
Would you like to have a,

504
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.570
would you like to have your cell phone ring,

505
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.710
but have people not know what your real number is?
You know,

506
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.720
wouldn't you like to get like have a cell phone,
right?

507
00:27:03.721 --> 00:27:06.510
And only your friends and family knew the real number to it.

508
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.750
And then you could come up with these virtual phone numbers that people could

509
00:27:09.751 --> 00:27:11.880
dial that but weren't really your phone number,

510
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:16.620
but your cell phone would still ring.
Would you be into that?

511
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:20.940
Would you be into a service like he voice that would allow you to do that and

512
00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:25.110
off these,
these virtual phone numbers,
you could actually a,

513
00:27:25.111 --> 00:27:29.610
you could do conference calling on your own new business and on the conference

514
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:33.930
call a feature,
we could have actually up to 95 people for each extension.

515
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.830
It's incredible.
It's basically,
it's a business phone number that will,

516
00:27:37.831 --> 00:27:40.890
that will ring on your cell phone.
Okay.

517
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:42.360
Without anybody knowing your personal one,

518
00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:46.050
which gives you the option of knowing whether it's a business one or a personal

519
00:27:46.051 --> 00:27:49.530
one at night answering it and whatever.
It's absolutely perfect.

520
00:27:49.531 --> 00:27:51.450
It's an amazing thing.
Um,

521
00:27:51.451 --> 00:27:56.451
they offer an entire service where you can a toll free local managing of

522
00:27:57.181 --> 00:28:01.890
outgoing calls.
This is all,
all the,
uh,
this is all the,
the,
the,
the,

523
00:28:01.891 --> 00:28:04.890
what are the options came to think this week.
Uh,

524
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.780
mobility all calls forwarded to a number slash people don't have to know your,

525
00:28:09.781 --> 00:28:12.780
uh,
your personal phone number,
virtual numbers.

526
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:16.470
So long as you have a real number you can give out fake numbers but it rings on

527
00:28:16.471 --> 00:28:20.910
your own number.
And if you don't pick up on your business,
uh,
your,

528
00:28:20.911 --> 00:28:25.890
your new virtual phone number,
they actually have professional accents,

529
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:31.110
a professional voice,
actors to give you any,
any sort of like,

530
00:28:31.111 --> 00:28:33.890
like an outgoing message.
Like if you want to give the illusion that you,

531
00:28:33.891 --> 00:28:36.540
your business is bigger than it is and you have a bunch of employees,

532
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:39.510
one of the options that they have is that you can actually have,

533
00:28:39.511 --> 00:28:40.111
like I personally,

534
00:28:40.111 --> 00:28:44.040
I would pick some sexy female voice with like a British accent.

535
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.400
Just gives your business credibility.
You know,

536
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:52.290
they'll send you emails with the text transcription of the voicemail or not.

537
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.680
The option is totally yours.
Uh,

538
00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:00.710
it's a great way to basically have all these different business lines without

539
00:29:01.681 --> 00:29:05.400
having to drill a bunch of holes in the wall and your house,
you know,

540
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:09.180
you've got [inaudible] welcome to you.
A which,
which it's IRS or whatever.

541
00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:10.440
I'm doing a bad accident.
You know what I'm saying?

542
00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.360
You can start the whole frigging thing.
So it's email,
uh,

543
00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:16.590
he voice check it out today.
Do I have a website here?
Where the hell is this?

544
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.560
Uh,
hang on one second.
Let me get this website.
Yeah,
it's easy.
voice.com.

545
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.880
There you go,
Bill.
He a genius.
Um,
once again,
he voices your mobile phone at work.

546
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:31.830
It's perfect for business,
a businessperson on the move.
Uh,
like myself,

547
00:29:31.831 --> 00:29:33.930
I'm actually going to get one of these phone numbers just because when I

548
00:29:33.931 --> 00:29:37.460
traveled from Club to club and all these,
uh,
different radio stations,
like my,

549
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:42.430
my phone number gets out there and,
and I,
I get weird phone calls sometimes.

550
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.600
You know,
I rented a car in Chicago like Avis,
like three months ago,

551
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:47.910
and then out of nowhere I got it.

552
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.130
I had to write down my fucking cell phone number.
And uh,

553
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:54.550
the guy worked at Eva's called me up.
I'll actually sent me a text.
Hey,

554
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:56.950
saw you stand up the other day.
Really funny.

555
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.070
I'm the guy who rented you the car at Avis,

556
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.100
which is beyond creepy and I'm a dude so I can only imagine how that would make

557
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:04.510
a female.
So it gives you a great,

558
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:10.020
like a privacy options while you still exist in the business world.

559
00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.680
Uh,
features eve voice offers includes call forwarding,
call routing,

560

toll free 800 numbers,

he voice your mobile phone at work.
Um,

567
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.890
that's one of those ideas where I'm just like,

568
00:30:44.891 --> 00:30:48.250
that right there is why I'm not a billionaire because I just look at that.

569
00:30:48.251 --> 00:30:53.170
Like that idea was just out there and uh,
I just did nothing.

570
00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:59.210
Why didn't I jump on that?
Like Youtube,
that's one of those ideas.
Um,

571
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.250
anyways,
but now I'm telling you about them,
so you gotta check them out.

572
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.220
These guys are great.
All right.
Um,

573
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.310
cause I've actually done half the shit that they do here and I paid a fucking

574
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:16.020
lawyer to do it.
It costs me a zillion dollars.
All right?

575
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:19.290
If you basically,
are you sitting in a cubicle right now?

576
00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:23.880
Are you wondering why you're making somebody else's dream come true while you're

577
00:31:23.881 --> 00:31:28.290
working towards that?
When you actually have an idea for a business,
you know,

578
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.090
well,
and you sit and they go,
well,

579
00:31:30.091 --> 00:31:32.400
I'd love to get myself incorporated to start my business,

580
00:31:32.401 --> 00:31:34.020
but it's going to cost a fortune.
Well,

581
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:37.410
at legal zoom.com if you've been waiting for the perfect time to start your

582
00:31:37.411 --> 00:31:40.350
dream business,
uh,
right now's the time to do it.

583
00:31:40.351 --> 00:31:45.351
You can incorporate your business or form an llc@legalzoom.com starting at just

584
00:31:46.201 --> 00:31:50.100
99 bucks.
It costs me like 1500,

585
00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:54.180
something like that.
700 1500,
I can't remember.
It was a lot of money.

586
00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:59.370
They'll do it for 99 bucks.
And if you have a family,
um,

587
00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:03.360
and you need to make sure that they're protected,
legal zoom also will help you,

588
00:32:03.361 --> 00:32:06.900
uh,
make out your last will and testament for just 69 bucks.

589
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.750
That's something that I have to do.
All right.

590
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.900
I have to make up my last will and testament,

591
00:32:12.901 --> 00:32:16.680
which is really a scary thing for me to do.
You know,

592
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:18.900
cause you're actually dealing with your own mortality.

593
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.160
And considering I just had a dream like I did last night,
it freaks me out,

594
00:32:23.161 --> 00:32:27.660
but I got to tell you if I'm going to do it,
I'm doing it for 69 bucks.
Um,

595
00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:31.710
in the past 12 years,
over 2 million Americans have used legal zoom for Llcs,

596
00:32:31.711 --> 00:32:35.040
wills,
trust,
trademarks,
and more.
This is basically,
look,

597
00:32:35.041 --> 00:32:38.790
if you're trying to start a business or if you need a will to protect your,

598
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.050
this is the place to go.
Uh,
you're gonna save hundreds,

599
00:32:42.051 --> 00:32:44.570
even thousands of dollars versus going the traditional route.

600
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.220
And I know what you think of.
Well,
what if I get bogged down?
What have,
what have,

601
00:32:47.221 --> 00:32:51.410
I can't figure it out.
They even have an attorney to help you if you need,
uh,

602
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.881
if you need help.

603
00:32:52.881 --> 00:32:55.760
Basically they have attorneys that you can call in that type of stuff.
All right.

604
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.630
Mandatory close.
Sorry.
It was supposed to.

605
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.590

611
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.020

So that's the deal there.
It is.

612
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.120
You want to start your business.
You want to be incorporated.

613

That is the cheapest,
most efficient way to do it.
Uh,

614
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.250
I wish they were around back when I got incorporated.

615
00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.790
Could have saved myself hundreds of dollars.
So they got legal zoom,

616
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:42.580
<v 1>I fucking miss everything.</v>

617
00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:46.090
And then we got Steve Harris taping that same day too from me.
Of course you do.

618
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.710
It's why wouldn't you,
why wouldn't you?
And then they'll raffling off a,
uh,

619
00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:55.770
John Bonam drum kit that you had paid and John Paul Jones and coming in on

620
00:33:56.081 --> 00:33:59.320
Thursday.
Can you make that,
ah,
you know,

621
00:33:59.321 --> 00:34:03.610
he's got some insane stories but isn't an in a,
is an in a metal band?

622
00:34:03.611 --> 00:34:08.320
Is Steve Gorman from a,
the Black Crows?
I did his podcast.
If you're ever,

623
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:11.680
I don't know if you know,
you were telling me about,
oh my God,

624
00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:14.920
he's got some great,
and I'm not going to tell any of them.
I'll tell them,

625
00:34:14.921 --> 00:34:17.860
see when we're off,
just to give you a,
just to some of the stories,
but I mean,

626
00:34:17.861 --> 00:34:20.830
I don't know what he wants out there.
Plus he lived them so he tell him better.

627
00:34:20.831 --> 00:34:23.650
But um,
I didn't,
hell that I get to know him.

628
00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.590
I think I do on this podcast is I got to know him and in the black Crowes came

629
00:34:26.591 --> 00:34:28.240
and they were playing the palladium one night,

630
00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.350
did some epic like three hour show,
like first half was acoustic,

631
00:34:32.351 --> 00:34:35.890
then they came out to the electric stuff was incredible.
And,
um,

632
00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.760
he's one of those just really just,
you know,
you know,

633
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:43.150
Ben through it and back and back again,
you know,
so just totally down to earth.

634
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:45.400
Totally cool guy,
man.
He would be great.
I mean,

635
00:34:45.401 --> 00:34:50.290
I don't know if black crows or to a rolling stone,
they would fit in.

636
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.570
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
I'll tell you,

637
00:34:52.571 --> 00:34:57.571
that guy would be a fucking amazing guests if he told half the story.

638
00:34:57.701 --> 00:35:02.140
So just one or two of them,
they just really like a,
you know,
it's,
it's,
you know,

639
00:35:02.141 --> 00:35:04.360
what it is,
is a comedian.
We have a bunch of stories,

640
00:35:04.361 --> 00:35:06.100
but so much of it is solo shit.

641
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.540
And as much as you might not get along with another comedian,
um,

642
00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:14.170
you don't have to go out on the road with them.
And it's just that thing of like,

643
00:35:14.171 --> 00:35:17.260
you know,
I've done a couple of comedy tours and it's just like,
you know,

644
00:35:17.261 --> 00:35:21.520
there's always,
there's the late guy,
there's the fucking loud guy,

645
00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:25.690
there's the dude to snoring.
You know,
there's always,
there's always in,

646
00:35:25.691 --> 00:35:27.760
you have to learn how to get along with those people.

647
00:35:27.761 --> 00:35:30.610
I don't know how the fuck these bands do it.
I don't either.

648
00:35:30.611 --> 00:35:33.600
Man being on a tour bus for frigging six months at a time.
No.

649
00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:38.070
And bunks and they all got that fucking story too.
Like the,
the

650
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.110
<v 2>tour ends,
like they just,</v>

651
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.650
they just all leave in different cars by then and they don't talk to each other

652
00:35:43.651 --> 00:35:47.590
for like fucking eight months.
Yeah.
It's unreal.
I mean,
I don't know.
Uh,

653
00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.270
I think that's how I would have been with my friends if I was in my early

654
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:52.860
twenties when you don't recognize like,
Hey,

655
00:35:52.861 --> 00:35:55.080
shit's getting out of control with everybody's relationships.

656
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:58.260
We need to have a sit down here and you just let it get to that point with a

657
00:35:58.261 --> 00:35:59.970
level of resentment is so high.

658
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.790
You don't even give a fuck that you're playing arenas.

659
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.790
You're going to walk away from that.
You can't get along with the Bass player.

660
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:10.110
Does that even,
it doesn't even make sense.
Right?
They,
um,
yeah.
Speaking of which,

661
00:36:10.111 --> 00:36:12.780
I will get an Aerosmith coming on the show this week.
Of course you do.

662
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.450
So of course.
Who else do you got that I'm not going to be able to come into?

663
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:18.330
I finally have a fucking hookup in this God damn.
Well actually,

664
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:22.810
whilst they're going to take on a Sunday,
not Joe,

665
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.750
Joe and Steve and it's the other three,
Brad,
Tom Hamilton and Joey Kramer.

666
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:31.590
That's even cooler though.
I know we want to set the unsung heroes of Aerosmith.

667
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.620
Yeah,
that's even cooler is I don't want to talk to Steven Tyler about fucking

668
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.060
American idol.
I don't give a shit.
You know what I mean?
He said he's done though.

669
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:39.301
Yeah,

670
00:36:39.301 --> 00:36:42.230
I know he has done but I'm just saying I didn't want to revisit that or any of

671
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.040
that crap.
So we've got these other guys coming on,

672
00:36:44.041 --> 00:36:47.100
but there was a point where they weren't that they'll step bands always been

673
00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:48.210
fighting for years.

674
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.150
There was a point that didn't even apply for two years and they were doing a gig

675
00:36:51.151 --> 00:36:54.600
over and like the buy and they were getting like $5 million to headline this big

676
00:36:54.601 --> 00:36:58.200
rock festival and they had to do to Gig.
They weren't going to cancel it.

677
00:36:58.201 --> 00:37:01.440
They didn't talk to Tyler for two years that Tyler didn't eat.

678
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.620
They didn't even talk to him before he walked on the stage.
He didn't,

679
00:37:04.621 --> 00:37:08.310
wouldn't even rehearse with them.
He didn't,
you know,
the four to one big show,

680
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.670
they didn't like the first time they saw him in two years is when he walked out.

681
00:37:11.671 --> 00:37:12.810
When they started,
when they opened up,

682
00:37:12.811 --> 00:37:15.150
we're like sweet emotion when he hit the microphone.

683
00:37:15.151 --> 00:37:18.310
That was the first time they even saw him.
That's how much they hated when Neely,

684
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.720
yeah,
he would,
he didn't fly that.

685
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.710
So then when they did the show was he's still putting his arm around Jackie.

686
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.420
He just went up there like nothing happened.

687
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.420
But then you saw like six months later I had another gig and fucking Joe knocked

688
00:37:28.421 --> 00:37:29.400
them off the stage.

689
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.490
They had a plot day at a whole lot stage going out to the crowd,

690
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.400
like a little at the end and Joe frigging nudged him and he went flying into the

691
00:37:35.401 --> 00:37:37.780
crowd and he broke his,
uh,
like his arm or something like that.

692
00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.710
He cancel a tour and Joe's like,
I do what?
I tell them all the time,

693
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:44.100
but you could see he did it on purpose like,
dude,
fuck you man.

694
00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:47.790
You sit home for two years.
That would happened.
I don't know cause he was a cop.

695
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.250
Just think as a us as a comic,
we have to deal off.

696
00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.550
I thought he fell off the stage and then he got mad because nobody in the band

697
00:37:53.551 --> 00:37:56.730
ran over to see what he was.
Well,
if you watched a youtube video,

698
00:37:56.731 --> 00:37:58.760
Joe nudges him and he goes,
I do what I do.

699
00:37:58.761 --> 00:38:00.450
Well you'll do right all the time to each other.

700
00:38:00.451 --> 00:38:01.920
But he thought he was right on the edge.

701
00:38:01.921 --> 00:38:05.210
You could see he fucking hit it on purpose,
but not yet.

702
00:38:05.211 --> 00:38:08.190
Just imagine what that's like sports right there.
I know.
Is that he,

703
00:38:08.191 --> 00:38:10.380
was he going through their head that he hit him with the shoulder?

704
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.860
Is that an El bus game?
A little fuck away from me.

705
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.440
He can't get mad at the other guys didn't come to see the shows.

706
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:20.100
Got to keep going.
They just kept playing,
hoping he was going to crawl back up.

707
00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.490
Wow.
But just imagine as a comic,
like say you know,

708
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.650
there's three or four of us touring together.
Right.

709
00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:28.800
And then all of a sudden one guy's being an asshole and doesn't want to do to

710
00:38:28.801 --> 00:38:32.520
tour six months from now and we've got to sit home for two years and can't play

711
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.040
right.
That will drive it.
I,
that would drive me out of my mind.

712
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.540
And then he goes on and does like a reality show.
Yeah.
I mean,
Joe Perry,
Justin,

713
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.020
just join another band.
Go Fuck.
I gotta get up on stage.

714
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:45.040
They sit home and do nothing.
I saw Joe Perry project went out.
I saw them at the,

715
00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:48.730
uh,
the house of Blues.
Oh yeah.
It was cool.
And then like,
you know,
when,
you know,

716
00:38:48.731 --> 00:38:51.220
when they come to la,
all the musicians,
so many of them out here,

717
00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:52.054
it's like New York.

718
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:57.390
So who came out like slash came out and a couple other guys like slashes to

719
00:38:57.581 --> 00:39:00.630
shit.
He came out and jammed with the opening band.
Like he doesn't get,

720
00:39:00.631 --> 00:39:04.690
he just doesn't care.
He just wants to play.
It was speaking of torture.

721
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:07.960
I mean it must've been tortured for him having a wait all those years for axel

722
00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:10.510
before he just finally said,
fuck it,
I'm going to do my own thing.
You know?

723
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.030
Well that's the thing that people always ask if we going to do,
you know,

724
00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:13.770
vaccines or whatever.

725
00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:16.090
Get the original band back together first of all and not broke.

726
00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.700
So that's not gonna happen.
They only do it when that broke axle band,
you know,

727
00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:20.920
guns is huge still.

728
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.650
And over in Europe they put forth in front of like 30,000 people.

729
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:28.240
So he's got money slash it makes money.
All doffs a frigging financial whiz.

730
00:39:28.241 --> 00:39:32.560
He's fucking get invited.
He owns like half a Starbucks.
He's good.
And you know,

731
00:39:32.561 --> 00:39:34.420
Steven did drummers,
the only one that's,
you know,

732
00:39:34.421 --> 00:39:36.640
he still has some money but he could,
you know,
he could use it.

733
00:39:36.641 --> 00:39:40.660
Izzy who wrote most of the songs is like a fucking gypsy and just lives in a

734
00:39:40.661 --> 00:39:43.030
frigging like RV and just travels across the country.

735
00:39:43.031 --> 00:39:45.970
So he doesn't need any money.
Wa what band is he?

736
00:39:45.971 --> 00:39:49.480
And he was selling the rhythm guitar player and guns and roses.
Yeah.
Yeah.

737
00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.310
Izzy in the Juju hounds was his,
it's all up there.

738
00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:57.820
You Solo records to so they don't need the money.
But um,
slash even said,
he goes,

739
00:39:57.821 --> 00:40:00.610
look,
he goes,
I'm in my fucking forties now.
He goes,

740
00:40:00.611 --> 00:40:03.520
and if we ever got back together,
the original band and the,

741
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:06.940
the opening band got off stage at nine o'clock and axle didn't want to go on to

742
00:40:06.941 --> 00:40:08.920
1130 way to make those fans wait.
He goes,

743
00:40:08.921 --> 00:40:11.290
I'd walk out the fucking door on the bus and I go,

744
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:14.620
I'd be in my bed by fucking 10 o'clock cause I would never put up with that.

745
00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:17.470
I'm not going to sit,
I'm not fucking sitting around for two and a half hours.

746
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.910
See that seems to be a problem is that they,
when I read slash his autobiography,

747
00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.590
you know the few books that I've read,

748
00:40:23.591 --> 00:40:26.440
if you ever saw like a list of the books that I read,
it be fucking hilarious.

749
00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:30.090
He's like a couple of classics count of Monte Cristo,
right,

750
00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.530
prince in the popper or some shit.
And then the rest is just all of core.
I've,

751
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:37.750
Tommy land is one of my favorite books.
I mean hammer of the gods.

752
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.600
I remember reading that thinking that they were the really sold their soul to

753
00:40:40.601 --> 00:40:44.920
the devil.
Right.
Other than,
yeah,
just some bad shit happens in life sometimes.

754
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:49.580
But uh,
I I remember reading the slash phone just go in like why and they,

755
00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:53.230
there's a point in the book where Matt Sorum finally just goes down and knocks

756
00:40:53.231 --> 00:40:57.430
on his dressing room drawers or is his,
uh,
trailer is like,

757
00:40:57.431 --> 00:41:00.130
get the fuck out here.
The fuck are we doing?

758
00:41:00.131 --> 00:41:04.240
Like it just seemed like everyone was just sort of appeasing every demand that

759
00:41:04.241 --> 00:41:07.420
he had.
I don't know if cause they were doing drugs and stuff and they're like,

760
00:41:07.421 --> 00:41:10.150
as long as I get my little fucking pile of heroin over here,
hey,
take,

761
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.310
take control the name of the band.
I don't give a fuck.

762
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:15.760
Like all that crazy shit that he did.
Um,
oh,

763
00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:18.550
you actually got like one of the few like sit down interviews with him,

764
00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:22.480
didn't you?
Would Axel.
Yeah.
What was that like?
It was amazing.
He's a good dude,

765
00:41:22.481 --> 00:41:26.110
man.
You know,
he's just,
look,
he's a hermit.
He's frigging private.

766
00:41:26.111 --> 00:41:28.440
He doesn't want any publicity.
You know,

767
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:32.140
he just sits at home and when he feels like going on tour and he tours and you

768
00:41:32.141 --> 00:41:34.350
know,
he's a maniac.
I like,
you know,
just that he,

769
00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.670
he asked everything has to be 100% perfect for him to go on stage from the,

770
00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:40.700
put a song out.
That's why it took him so long.
But he's a good dude.

771
00:41:40.701 --> 00:41:44.150
Once a perfectionist.
Jimmy's of total perfection.
Perfectionist.
Yeah.

772
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:47.240
And they just,
and,
but he's got a great sense of humor.

773
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:48.560
He's just a down to earth dude.
But,

774
00:41:48.561 --> 00:41:51.470
and there's so many rumors about the guy and we talked to him about it.
He goes,

775
00:41:51.471 --> 00:41:53.180
I don't even,
he goes,
what am I going to do?
A dress,

776
00:41:53.181 --> 00:41:57.450
a different room or every fucking five minutes about me know the London press

777
00:41:57.451 --> 00:42:01.020
said like a year ago said that he just,
he kills all the neighbor's dogs.
He,

778
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.310
he'd be backs over him when his truck and then he runs back over and he's like,

779
00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:06.950
what am I going to do?
Am I going to go out and issue?
He goes,

780
00:42:06.951 --> 00:42:10.590
some people think people think I'm this big asshole.
He cause whatever.
I just,

781
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:15.640
<v 1>how many rumors do you come up with with that?
That's the next one.
Like alien.</v>

782
00:42:15.641 --> 00:42:19.430
We already got that one.
Aa Battery runs over him again.

783
00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:22.700
<v 2>Yeah,
he runs them over again.
Jesus.
He's like,
so it goes to just,</v>

784
00:42:22.701 --> 00:42:26.400
there's so much bad shit about me out there.
He goes,
he's not going to,
I'm,

785
00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.020
and he addressed all the thing about being late.
He goes,
even as a kid,

786
00:42:29.021 --> 00:42:31.630
my job was right next door and I would still be a half hour late.

787
00:42:31.631 --> 00:42:34.990
I'm always just running late.
I'm an airhead when it comes to that.
But he goes,

788
00:42:34.991 --> 00:42:37.950
I like everything to be perfect.
Whatever I do.
And it just

789
00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:41.890
<v 1>take [inaudible] your head.
Like,
I don't know where my car keys out,</v>

790
00:42:41.891 --> 00:42:44.640
but when you hear 80,000 people with their,
what the fuck?

791
00:42:44.641 --> 00:42:48.510
Where are you energy or whatever.
They perform to 30,000 people.
I think,
uh,

792
00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:50.510
you know,
I don't know this.

793
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.980
<v 2>No,
there's gotta be something wrong with you.</v>

794
00:42:51.981 --> 00:42:56.090
Like if you were sitting backstage in an Improv or theater and the opening act

795
00:42:56.091 --> 00:42:58.430
got off and you just sitting back there and you hear the crowd,

796
00:42:58.431 --> 00:43:00.920
like what the fuck?
And you sit there for an hour and a half later,
I'm not ready.

797
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:04.610
I'm not ready.
No.
Yeah.
Make them wait another 45 minutes.

798
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.470
Does no way we do that in a million years.

799
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.350
<v 1>No,
I would be so afraid that that might,</v>

800
00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:11.420
that would be the last time anyone would ever come to see me.
Absolutely.

801
00:43:11.421 --> 00:43:13.270
And even do that.
A respect for the fans.

802
00:43:13.271 --> 00:43:17.200
I would do it out of fear of going back to what the fuck I used to have to do,

803
00:43:17.201 --> 00:43:21.340
you know?
Um,
speaking of that,
how much,
uh,
how much standup do you get to do like,

804
00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.640
uh,
during the year now with all your projects?

805
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:28.060
I know like two weekends a month I'm out,
you know,
do what rob stuff.

806
00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.600
See You doing it then?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I still,
you know,
do a funny bone,

807
00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:35.540
you know,
Improv.
Do you still go down to like the clubs in New York or anything?

808
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.210
I once in awhile I do to sell are killing me man.
I'm like the,

809
00:43:40.211 --> 00:43:41.770
I feel like I'm the only guy.

810
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:46.930
Like I go down to the comedy store and the Improv out here and like when I think

811
00:43:46.931 --> 00:43:50.700
about all the guys that I started with and all of that,
like I dunno,

812
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:53.920
like a lot of them,
they just don't come around to the clubs anymore.

813
00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.010
Maybe I need more of a home life.
You got a kid now,
right?

814
00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.960
<v 2>Yeah,
I've got a kid so that's tough,
you know,</v>

815
00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:04.010
you know that totally do a seller spot.
A 1210 eight happened and I can get home,

816
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:04.281
you know,

817
00:44:04.281 --> 00:44:07.130
and it never running late and then I get home at like one 30 or two cause I want

818
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:10.580
to hang,
you know,
and just be a,
you know,
talk and hang out and shit and you know,

819
00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:14.180
catch up with everybody and then you know,
he's up at fucking seven.

820
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.870
<v 1>Yeah.
You know what mean?
It was amazed at how Norton could,
you know,</v>

821
00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.690
once he got the opiate Anthony Gig,

822
00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:23.350
I remember like a few times I sat in for him and I would go out and try and do

823
00:44:23.351 --> 00:44:26.230
stand up that night and I was already wiped out if I had done the show that day

824
00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:30.010
and then try to get up at like five 30 in the morning,

825
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.770
like he's been doing that like what,
10 years?
12 years.
That's ridiculous.

826
00:44:34.771 --> 00:44:39.600
I don't know how he does.
He's a maniac.
Yeah,
during the day.
How does he do?

827
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.150
Yeah,
he said that he takes a nap during the day but still it's like,

828
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.590
you know he kits the early spot,

829
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:46.830
you know he gets is probably done by like 10 o'clock he said he goes to bed at

830
00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:49.050
like midnight and gets up at five

831
00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:54.690
five and in his brain is that quick.
Like he has one of the quickest minds.
Never.

832
00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:00.100
I,
I've never gone in there and I've seen him just like,
like not on even gym.

833
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.410
Like if he's tired,

834
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:07.190
his brain always seems like it's like minor down cause he's so fucking miserable

835
00:45:07.831 --> 00:45:09.430
at anything.
Will set them off.
You know what,

836
00:45:09.431 --> 00:45:11.850
I love what he does and I like how he send to that UFC shit.

837
00:45:11.851 --> 00:45:14.520
I like when he has the guys come in and they do the holds.

838
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:17.650
They'll like choke him and he'd be here.
That fucking noisy made.

839
00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.370
Put that on a loop.

840
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:23.820
I watched that one time when I was on the road just fucking laughing my ass off

841
00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:27.690
for like,
like just killed like a good 10 minutes on the road.
Just dying.

842
00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:30.790
Laughing.
Yeah.
You can get these guys put him in choke holds.
They frigging the,

843
00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.540
I was at one time this guy like what did he do?
He took it,

844
00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:39.540
he kicked him with his Shin like a right you right where you get a Charlie

845
00:45:39.541 --> 00:45:40.260
horse.
Right.

846
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:44.130
And they'll look on Jim's face was so priceless because it was like one of those

847
00:45:44.131 --> 00:45:46.620
pains that were so severe like it,

848
00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:50.880
it was like a pause before it's set in and then he literally looked like

849
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:55.190
nauseous and I remember Kenny was upset to go nick.
He's like,
fuck,

850
00:45:55.191 --> 00:45:57.000
do I do enough to hit them?
That hawk,
those bolts.

851
00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:02.010
Should we do enough to hit them?
Not Hard,
but it was,
it was worth it.

852
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:06.960
He's a trooper man.
He really a yes man,
they did.
That guy deserves everything.

853
00:46:06.961 --> 00:46:07.794
He gets it.

854
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:11.130
I mean that guy would get off a plane on fucking Christmas Day and do three

855
00:46:11.131 --> 00:46:13.620
spots at the seller until what?
The comic strip.
I'm like,
dude,

856
00:46:13.621 --> 00:46:17.790
you could take a day off.
Yeah,
I'll had a family fun.
I got to,
I got spots.

857
00:46:17.791 --> 00:46:20.170
I got to do it.
Yeah.
You remember that shit when we used to go down,

858
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:23.250
when we used to do the food spots at the cellar and we would do them and then

859
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:27.780
you'd play,
uh,
everybody would play chess and just shit on each other.

860
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:30.590
If you weren't playing chess upstairs at the olive tree.
Thank you.
Know.

861
00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:34.080
I love about that.
Thank God nobody was.
Cause I'm so fucking codependent.

862
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:38.310
If they were all drinkers,
I would have been boozing like every night with them.

863
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:42.420
Uh,
but thank God they weren't.
So everyone just sat around like,

864
00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.720
like Patrice never drank.
Jim doesn't drank.
Probably didn't drink.
Yeah.

865
00:46:45.721 --> 00:46:50.430
None of those guys drank.
And I remember,
uh,
getting into this,

866
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.960
this cycle of going down there and doing like a 12,
12,
30,
you know what's up,

867
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.590
David Tell was always a 12.
So I'd be on after,
I'm like 1245,
1250.

868
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.160
And then you just sit there and you always be like,
I'm going home early tonight.

869
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:04.520
I'm going home early.
And I seen it was like four in the morning.

870
00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:09.150
You want a times I took the subway home,
you take the six from Astor place.

871
00:47:09.151 --> 00:47:13.050
I take it up when I was living with fucking Bobby and we'd be getting off the

872
00:47:13.051 --> 00:47:18.051
train and the sun was coming up and people were coming out to go to work and uh,

873
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:21.000
it was so fucking busy.
It was kind of cool.

874
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.670
But then also I always felt like an album,

875
00:47:23.671 --> 00:47:26.310
cause I used to be like a morning person had like a paper route and all that

876
00:47:26.311 --> 00:47:27.540
type of shit.
And,
uh,

877
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:33.110
then you get in that awful cycle where you'd go to bed at like seven 30 sleep

878
00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:37.870
til like three or four and then you just wake up and do what?

879
00:47:37.871 --> 00:47:40.360
Get breakfast and it was time to go down in the fucking seller again.

880
00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.750
<v 2>Yeah,
that's,
that's a tough,
I,
you know,</v>

881
00:47:42.751 --> 00:47:45.390
I live with Norton for like four years and that's what,
that was his schedule.

882
00:47:45.391 --> 00:47:48.120
I would go to bed.
I like to,
I was never a six o'clock.

883
00:47:48.121 --> 00:47:52.500
I go to two and get up at 10 he was a guy that,
you know,
at seven in the morning,

884
00:47:52.501 --> 00:47:56.280
he'd still be up and then I have to wake him up at like six o'clock.
I go,
dude,

885
00:47:56.281 --> 00:47:57.530
you got spots you've got to sell.

886
00:47:57.531 --> 00:48:00.570
Or at eight o'clock I'd be waking them up at six o'clock.

887
00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:04.230
How long did you live with him?
Like three,
probably three years.

888
00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:07.710
And you guys were,
you guys seem like you'd be able to get along good.
Absolutely.

889
00:48:07.711 --> 00:48:09.960
Yeah.
We got along great and we live right outside the city.

890
00:48:09.961 --> 00:48:13.410
We paid like 300 bucks.
We left.
We had a,
I had a girlfriend at the time,

891
00:48:13.411 --> 00:48:16.890
they live with us,
so it was 900 bucks for Ren.
So we split it three ways,

892
00:48:16.891 --> 00:48:19.380
300 bucks a piece.
Perfect.

893
00:48:19.381 --> 00:48:22.890
We're fucking five minutes away from the Gw or the Lincoln tunnel was beautiful,

894
00:48:22.891 --> 00:48:25.560
is a shit hall.
It was fucking mauled all over the walls and stuff.

895
00:48:25.561 --> 00:48:29.020
We didn't care.
Act 300 bucks.
It's fucking beautiful.
I lived with

896
00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:34.090
<v 1>Bobby and uh,
we almost killed each other by the end and,</v>

897
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:38.290
but I actually learned how to let shit go bike.
Bobby has this,

898
00:48:38.291 --> 00:48:43.060
this great thing where he can get past shit.
And I didn't see,

899
00:48:43.061 --> 00:48:45.190
I didn't come from a school where you got past shit.

900
00:48:45.191 --> 00:48:48.400
It's like you did something to me and then we had,
fuck you,
fuck you.

901
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:52.330
And then the shit was over.
But I learned through him how to be like,

902
00:48:52.331 --> 00:48:53.500
all right dude,
you know,

903
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:57.970
you don't write somebody off because they spilled orange juice on your fucking

904
00:48:57.971 --> 00:49:01.270
little kitchen TV that you had there,
you know.
Um,

905
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:06.890
but we lived in,
we lived three people in a Walkthrough,

906
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:11.500
one bedroom apartment that was a one bedroom and then it was like a sitting
room.

907
00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:14.770
Right.
And they actually use that as like the bedroom.

908
00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:19.030
And then in the living room Bobby had a pullout couch that he slept on.

909
00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.550
It was ridiculous.
And they are our roommate.

910
00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.230
You anything in particular brought a chick back there?

911
00:49:23.231 --> 00:49:27.910
He always fucking walkthrough like Bobby put like shower curtain up.

912
00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:29.410
It was fucking hilarious.

913
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:33.340
And the guy always would come fucking any fucking like try and peek in to see

914
00:49:33.341 --> 00:49:35.050
the chicky with Oh yeah.
You know,

915
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.970
not during but like afterwards when you fucking land there.

916
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:43.180
So one time Bobby fucking,
you know the dude came walking through.

917
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.330
So Bobby was naked and he was underneath the covers.

918
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.310
So what he did when the guy was coming back,

919
00:49:48.311 --> 00:49:51.160
cause when he come back as the way you were laying in the bed and then he'd look

920
00:49:51.161 --> 00:49:53.110
to see,
I don't know,
see her titties or whatever,

921
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:58.390
Bobby pulled the covers off of himself and was laying there totally naked and

922
00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:02.050
the dude came walking in locked eyes with Bobby and Bobby's just like,
what's up?

923
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:07.510
I ain't never did it again.
He never did again.
It was fucking,

924
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:12.280
it was brilliant.
It was fucking brilliant.
It was classic Bobby Kelly,

925
00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:14.470
like,
you know,

926
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:17.890
I would have sat there for fucking four days trying to figure out how I'm gonna

927
00:50:17.891 --> 00:50:20.640
approach this subject with him.
He just got right to the cloud.

928
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:25.300
Just show him my junk.
That'll freak them out and I don't have to say anything.

929
00:50:25.301 --> 00:50:27.980
It was fun.
It was fucking perfect.
That's great.
I used

930
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.340
<v 2>to have a roommate where his dad used to come home and want to look at the girls</v>

931
00:50:31.341 --> 00:50:35.420
that were,
we brought home.
Oh yeah.
He was real creepy,
right?
Yeah.

932
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:36.254
He would always like,

933
00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:40.670
he fucked one of his son's girlfriend's after they broke up.

934
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:45.010
Wow.
Yeah.
Was totally a younger guy now.
I mean,
you know,

935
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:50.050
he was like 20 he was probably like 45 and we were 20 something like that.

936
00:50:50.961 --> 00:50:54.460
And He'd bald duty.
He wasn't good looking at all or anything like that.
Yeah,

937
00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:56.630
so he's old.
So I remember one time like we were,

938
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:58.150
we only had one bedroom were sharing.

939
00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:00.470
We had these two girls there and I was on the floor one and he was,

940
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:03.440
the son was in the bed with the other and he comes home and he's peeking in and

941
00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:05.370
he turned the light on.
He looked that,
never forget.

942
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.540
He looked at the bat and he couldn't really see it.
Then he looked in the ground,

943
00:51:09.541 --> 00:51:12.870
he saw this girl and she was fucking fat and this is what I got.
And he's like,

944
00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:17.850
who the fuck's with Orca down there?
I know he said,
Dad said that.
Yeah.

945
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:22.620
What did the girl do?
She,
I would just like,
Oh dad did tag you get outta here.

946
00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:25.820
And we just put it around them out.
I'll try to,

947
00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:30.100
but he didn't drown out at all because it was,
it was awful.
We were,

948
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:34.920
I was trying to hold it in cause it was pretty fucking funny.
Who's what,
Orca.

949
00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:35.853
Yeah,

950
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:39.470
<v 1>that the,
yeah.
I never had like,
I could never hook up with somebody.
I was,
I,</v>

951
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.491
some of my friends,

952
00:51:40.491 --> 00:51:43.550
they could just hit anything that fucking move just for the numbers I always
had.

953
00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:47.630
They had to be some sort of like some sort of attraction.

954
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:50.960
Uh,
I,
I remember a couple of times with my friends like,
dude,
what the fuck?

955
00:51:50.961 --> 00:51:54.770
And I was just like,
dude,
she froze and they'd be at least let it blow you.

956
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.760
And I was like,
yeah.

957
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:59.780
So I tried to do that one time and up hooking up with this girl and she was,
oh,

958
00:51:59.781 --> 00:52:03.620
she just was fucking,
I,
I don't,
you have a couple of the girls,
she's like young,

959
00:52:03.621 --> 00:52:07.390
but she wears like an old person's perfume.
Oh,
the war.

960
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:12.320
She was fucking 80 hall.
She smelled like she was fucking 80.

961
00:52:12.321 --> 00:52:13.580
And that's all I could remember.

962
00:52:13.581 --> 00:52:18.200
I just remember banging her doggy style with my head turned to the side.

963
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:21.190
It was horrific.
No,
that's,

964
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:24.770
<v 2>that's,
that's bad.
Yeah,
I did.
I went through that phase for awhile,
but then it,</v>

965
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:29.570
I needed,
you know,
it had to be quality,
but there was times where,
because I

966
00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:33.450
<v 1>quality dude,
I never saw it.
Like there was certain guys I saw,
you know,</v>

967
00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.700
they bring girls down to the cellar.

968
00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:40.200
I was never go broke girls down to the cellar.
I never like a,
I never trusted.

969
00:52:40.201 --> 00:52:42.540
Like I just feel you just bringing them down to the lions.

970
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:44.930
<v 2>Well yeah.
Yeah I know.
I know</v>

971
00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:49.450
<v 1>if someone didn't take her they at the very least,
you know,</v>

972
00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:53.680
I would go down there and take a pounding,
some epic fucking pounding.

973
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:55.210
I remember one night Patrice was getting,

974
00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:58.150
was going after Norton and Norton had some girl there and they got into it a

975
00:52:58.151 --> 00:53:00.010
little bit.
Uh

976
00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:03.150
<v 2>yeah cause no one doesn't like that.
Like if,
you know,</v>

977
00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:06.290
he says something cause Patrice will say something that a girl or something in

978
00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:09.590
Norton doesn't like to get,
you know,
if he perceives he's getting totally

979
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:13.410
<v 1>sense,
which totally makes sense.
But you know Patrice,
once he saw that,</v>

980
00:53:13.411 --> 00:53:17.850
that Jim was annoyed,
it was fucking hilarious.
It was really,
really fun.

981
00:53:17.851 --> 00:53:20.560
Jim Really got mad and that,
you know,
of course the,
you know,

982
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:22.300
they squashed it the next fucking

983
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:24.350
<v 2>what portray or did that what?
I brought a girl down.</v>

984
00:53:24.351 --> 00:53:26.430
She said something stupid while you're sitting at the table.

985
00:53:26.431 --> 00:53:30.240
He's trying to be nice and she just said something and I forgot what it was and

986
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:32.730
Patrice just laid into her and the girls are like,
oh I want to go.

987
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:37.020
We're going to get an ad of why is he so mean?
Yeah,
first I was bad.

988
00:53:37.021 --> 00:53:39.620
Now that I'm on my couch so he's an asshole.
I don't know.
You know,

989
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:42.260
I thought he was my friend.
I don't know why he would say it.
Meanwhile I'm like,

990
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:45.590
that was fucking funny.
You've deserved it.
But I wasn't going to say that.

991
00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:50.110
<v 1>No.
I would portray some Keith Robinson if they were ever there together.</v>

992
00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.780
It just was like,
why would you do that to self?

993
00:53:52.781 --> 00:53:57.460
Like I didn't have the skill to still get laid after parading.

994
00:53:57.461 --> 00:54:00.910
The girl passed those two fucking guys because they were either going to trash

995
00:54:00.911 --> 00:54:04.720
her or they were going to trash me and make me look like an asshole.

996
00:54:04.721 --> 00:54:09.520
Or even where I,
I really took some epic,
epic fucking poundings down there.

997
00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:12.700
I was not good at deck.
It took me,
I was not good at that game,

998
00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:17.350
just sit in their trash people because the way I learned the game was it was

999
00:54:17.351 --> 00:54:20.620
serious.
And you went right for the fucking juggler.

1000
00:54:20.621 --> 00:54:23.830
Like Bobby has that a little bit,
um,

1001
00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.730
which is why we probably almost killed each other when we were living together.

1002
00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:31.060
But,
um,
I don't know.
You know what I wanted to talk about here?

1003
00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:34.180
How far into the salary?
45 minutes.
By the way,
you're fucking great guest.

1004
00:54:34.570 --> 00:54:36.550
Thank God I appreciate them.
You know what I mean?

1005
00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.700
There's nothing better than when somebody comes over and they can just shoot the

1006
00:54:39.701 --> 00:54:42.520
shit.
They're the worst.
You know what,
if somebody comes there,

1007
00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:44.620
like I imagine on your show and be like,
yeah,

1008
00:54:44.621 --> 00:54:48.250
you had one of the greatest albums of the 80s.
What was that like?

1009
00:54:48.251 --> 00:54:51.670
And they were like,
Oh yeah,
that's nice.
Yeah,
it was good.
It was um,
you know,

1010
00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.593
yeah it was.

1011
00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:55.960
<v 2>There's some other ones that were good too,
but that was,
I know</v>

1012
00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.320
we always discuss that and like lucky that Guy Eddie Eddie trunk,
that's,

1013
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:02.131
you know,
one of the host.

1014
00:55:02.131 --> 00:55:04.380
He's been in the business for 30 years so he knows these guys.

1015
00:55:04.381 --> 00:55:07.540
So before he'll go look,
that's disguise a tough interview.
Right?

1016
00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:10.550
Same much or you can't get much out of them.
Or this guy just talks,

1017
00:55:10.551 --> 00:55:13.830
he'll keep going and going.
So we've got to cut him off so he knows which

1018
00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:18.940
<v 1>then I guess you can't name a name,
but who's been like just the toughest like</v>

1019
00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:21.740
<v 2>you know who is tough to interview but a great guy,</v>

1020
00:55:21.741 --> 00:55:26.330
one of the great as Lemmy from Motorhead,
cause he's an old cranky British guy.

1021
00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:30.160
Fuck,
I love La.
He's my favorite one.
Anyway,
when he passed,
man,

1022
00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:33.200
it's going to be a fucking sad.
I saw that documentary on him.

1023
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.630
Crazy and he's just a legend man.
But he's,

1024
00:55:35.631 --> 00:55:37.580
he just gives one more to answers and you know,

1025
00:55:37.581 --> 00:55:39.740
he needs a few cocktails and I'm the lighten up.

1026
00:55:39.741 --> 00:55:42.840
And if we're taking a three in the afternoon,
he's got to have a few jacks and,

1027
00:55:42.841 --> 00:55:46.100
um,
and,
but he just cause a lot of one word answers.
He goes,
Nah,
I don't,

1028
00:55:46.101 --> 00:55:49.730
I didn't like that Alma had to me.
It was terrible.
And that's his answer.

1029
00:55:49.731 --> 00:55:52.430
He's not being a dick,
but that's just the way he is.

1030
00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:54.500
So it's tough to get stuff out of him.

1031
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:56.860
<v 1>Uh,
he,
he makes,
he's a funny dude,</v>

1032
00:55:57.070 --> 00:56:02.070
me hope that guy that you can booze at that level still,

1033
00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:07.740
dude.
You know what I mean?
66 years old.
Smokes two packs of cigarettes a day.

1034
00:56:07.741 --> 00:56:10.590
Marlboro reds drinks a bottle,

1035
00:56:10.591 --> 00:56:13.290
at least a bottle of Jack Daniels a day and still does,
you know,

1036
00:56:13.291 --> 00:56:17.610
crystal meth from time to time and been doing it first since he was Jimi Hendrix

1037
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:21.420
roadie back in the day.
So he's been doing it since the early seventies.

1038
00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.200
I watched a documentary on him.
Yeah.

1039
00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:28.240
He just decided to try like every kind of bourbon or every kind of scotch.

1040
00:56:28.691 --> 00:56:31.810
I don't know what it was.
And he had all the bottles,

1041
00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:36.790
like on his window sill on the floor going up a bookcase.
I mean it looked like,

1042
00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:40.470
uh,
like if they ever said,
hey bill,
this is all the whiskey.
Uh,

1043
00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:44.770
you and your friends drank over the last 25 years.
And with him,

1044
00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:49.450
I think he was just knocking them out.
I Dunno dude.
He's,
he's,

1045
00:56:49.451 --> 00:56:51.620
he's,
he's taught more hardcore to Keith Richards,

1046
00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:56.170
like Keith Richards with the drugs and you know,
I read Keith's book.
Okay.
Also.

1047
00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:58.150
Yeah,
of course.
Cause that's my library.

1048
00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:01.930
He seemed like he said like basically,
you know,

1049
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:03.880
I think he has a drink every now and again.
But like,

1050
00:57:03.881 --> 00:57:06.640
since basically from 1980 on,
he's been clean.

1051
00:57:06.641 --> 00:57:11.641
But like the publicity publicity that he got when he was doing heroin and

1052
00:57:11.801 --> 00:57:14.740
getting arrested and everything,
like he was never able to shake that.

1053
00:57:14.741 --> 00:57:18.130
But he talked about like the way he did coke,
he goes,

1054
00:57:18.131 --> 00:57:20.080
you don't just sit there and just keep doing it.
And he's like,

1055
00:57:20.081 --> 00:57:23.440
you do a bump and then you get on with the party or whatever.

1056
00:57:23.441 --> 00:57:26.980
You know what I mean?
You don't get so fucking high,
you got to keep doing it.

1057
00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:31.980
He seemed like a really like in control kind of a user anyways.

1058
00:57:32.711 --> 00:57:36.040
You know what I mean?
He didn't like,
I mean as a comedian,

1059
00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:38.160
my all the reference is always like,
you know,

1060
00:57:38.161 --> 00:57:40.060
and then the nuclear holocaust comes,
you know,

1061
00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.630
cockroaches and Keith Richards and the only people he's going to be shooting

1062
00:57:43.631 --> 00:57:44.980
heroin into his eye.
And you just,

1063
00:57:44.981 --> 00:57:47.890
I just kept hearing that and I thought that that's how the guy was and I guess

1064
00:57:47.891 --> 00:57:49.420
he wasn't at all.
Yeah.
I mean he,

1065
00:57:49.421 --> 00:57:53.860
I think he had it like a good 15 year run from like 65 to 80 where he was just,

1066
00:57:53.861 --> 00:57:57.700
you know,
we drank coke and stuff like that,
but then he stopped.

1067
00:57:57.701 --> 00:58:01.360
So he's not really that,
but I mean has been doing it since,
you know,

1068
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:06.600
1970 that's unreal considering also that Betty Ford clinic didn't come around to

1069
00:58:06.791 --> 00:58:10.260
like what the mid seventies early eighties early.
Yeah.

1070
00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:15.130
So like nobody really knew like that first,
you know,
wave of people,

1071
00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:16.810
the Elvis's and them,
you know,

1072
00:58:16.811 --> 00:58:19.360
just people not knowing that somebody has a problem and they need like an

1073
00:58:19.361 --> 00:58:21.520
intervention.
I mean if you will,

1074
00:58:21.521 --> 00:58:25.610
getting high from 65 to 80 and you figured out an 80 that's pretty good.
Yeah,

1075
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:27.830
I think through it.
I,
I got a problem with that shit man.

1076
00:58:27.831 --> 00:58:30.700
And like the level that I like to drink.
I'm not an alcoholic,
but like,

1077
00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:34.410
you know that stupid joke,
I'm not an alcoholic,
but I drank like one like,

1078
00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:38.260
I mean I don't do Lemmy level of drinking,
but like,
um,

1079
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.480
I haven't drank in like a month,
just took a month off and uh,

1080
00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:48.200
I don't get like that.
Like,
Oh wow,
everything's awesome and,

1081
00:58:48.201 --> 00:58:50.630
and it just makes me want an everyday,

1082
00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:54.190
it's like I'm adding to the equation of how much I want to drink.

1083
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.650
Like after a week it's like I,

1084
00:58:55.651 --> 00:58:58.810
I'd love like fucking four beers and then the second week I had,

1085
00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:03.700
I'd love a 12 pack and now it's just like I want to drink like Lemmy feel like I

1086
00:59:03.701 --> 00:59:06.880
have to drink like that and then realize,
oh,
you can't do that.
Then I stop.

1087
00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:11.590
Then you stop.
I go like cold Turkey,
but I'm not like fiending for it.

1088
00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.620
I just fucking like it.
You know what I mean?
Absolutely.
Man.

1089
00:59:14.621 --> 00:59:16.460
I was never one of those to like,

1090
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:19.180
my grandparents always had like a drink at the end that at night,
you know?

1091
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:22.100
I'm like,
Eh.
I'm like as a comic we never did

1092
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:24.140
<v 2>that.
Were like,
ah,
you would just go to fucking God.</v>

1093
00:59:24.141 --> 00:59:27.350
You guys didn't cause I would have if you guys did.
I would have,
but yeah,

1094
00:59:27.351 --> 00:59:28.710
I never did it.
Especially it's like I'm,

1095
00:59:28.711 --> 00:59:32.240
if I'm on the road or about the fucking Fort Lauderdale for three,
four days,

1096
00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:34.670
y'all have some beers after the show,
maybe a couple of shots.

1097
00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:38.000
But you know when you're home doing comedy sets in New York,
I'm like,
no,

1098
00:59:38.001 --> 00:59:41.720
why don't,
I would never even think about having a beer or anything.
Thank God.

1099
00:59:41.721 --> 00:59:45.590
But now as I get older,
I'm like,
yeah,
I have a glass of wine,
have a couple.

1100
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:48.440
But I don't go that far.
I never,
that was never my,
uh,

1101
00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.630
I never had that problem with the alcohol.

1102
00:59:50.631 --> 00:59:53.510
I always just wanted to get a little buzz on just so I can wrap with chicks

1103
00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.780
cause I had no,
I was shy and stuff.
I had a little buzz on.

1104
00:59:56.781 --> 00:59:59.810
I'd fucking have some balls to go up to.
Let's say that that was my whole thing.

1105
00:59:59.811 --> 01:00:02.540
That's really why I started drinking.
That's why I never get into drug.

1106
01:00:02.541 --> 01:00:05.300
So you'd see my buddy's doing coke on Friday night.

1107
01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:07.640
We write and to go out to there and they would do coke and they would just

1108
01:00:07.641 --> 01:00:11.210
fucking just spent 300 bucks and just fucking want to talk all night.
I'm like,

1109
01:00:11.211 --> 01:00:13.700
let me just have fucking a six pack and let's go to the bar.

1110
01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.860
It's like a wrap with chicks.
What are you guys doing?

1111
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:19.310
You're not solving anything over there.
Fucking talking about American Indians.

1112
01:00:19.311 --> 01:00:20.020
Who gives a fuck.

1113
01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:23.290
<v 1>Do you know,
somebody told me a story about Patrice recently.
I never,</v>

1114
01:00:23.291 --> 01:00:26.320
I never heard this one was about,

1115
01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.560
he was talking to his mom about trying weed.

1116
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:35.110
He tried it a couple of times and was like,
and then,
you know,
tried it,

1117
01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:38.860
got high and then just got the munchies and eight and he told his mom,

1118
01:00:38.861 --> 01:00:39.820
he was just like,
look,

1119
01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.650
I'm just going to fucking save the money that I would've spent on weed and just

1120
01:00:44.651 --> 01:00:46.960
go buy the food.
Just fucking get right to that.

1121
01:00:46.961 --> 01:00:51.961
And it was just such a classic for trees where he was always analyzing and

1122
01:00:52.331 --> 01:00:56.980
breaking shit down that he didn't have to go through.
Fucking 20 is like,
dude,

1123
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:59.620
I gotta I have some friends,
you know,

1124
01:00:59.621 --> 01:01:03.520
in this business and outside of this business who have been regular users,

1125
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
like fucking getting a bag of weed every fucking week since we've been like 15.

1126
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.820
Right.
Through getting married and having kids.
And,
um,

1127
01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:18.180
I mean,
I guess it's all right if it doesn't get in the way of,
uh,

1128
01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.360
you know,
life.
But,
you know,
I got a couple of guys where it's just,

1129
01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:26.910
I dunno it at some point,
like I feel like a fucking [inaudible].

1130
01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.130
The thing with like booze is you can fool yourself by sitting there drinking

1131
01:01:30.131 --> 01:01:32.650
like a,
you know,
if you're sitting like in a parking lot,
you know,

1132
01:01:32.651 --> 01:01:35.470
shotgunning beers,
it's pretty obvious that,
you know,

1133
01:01:35.471 --> 01:01:36.700
you're too old to be doing this,

1134
01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.100
but you put on a sport coat and he had a whiskey bar.

1135
01:01:39.101 --> 01:01:43.180
All of a sudden you feel like this,
this sophistication to what you're doing.

1136
01:01:43.181 --> 01:01:44.830
And it's like,
no dude,
you're getting loaded.

1137
01:01:44.890 --> 01:01:49.430
You did this outside the Worcester Centrum before fucking Judas priest concert.

1138
01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.293
You're still doing it.

1139
01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:51.170
<v 2>Yeah,
it's just,</v>

1140
01:01:51.171 --> 01:01:54.710
you put in Scotch and a glass now instead of drinking fucking beer out of a can

1141
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.200
and the parking lot,
you know,
you're trying to class it up.

1142
01:01:57.201 --> 01:02:00.460
Although I never drank wine.
I'm like wines for fucking pussies wine.

1143
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:03.050
I'd see my friend.
What the fuck you drinking?
Why?
Nah,
it's good.

1144
01:02:03.051 --> 01:02:06.860
And it's nice and mellow.
I'm like,
oh,
what a fucking numb queer you are.

1145
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:09.580
And now and like the last five years I'm like,
I fucking,

1146
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:11.960
I buy the wine country twice.
I'm like,
this is awesome.

1147
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:15.490
I've always so I hate this bottle.
I hate that.
I like it.
It's a horrific,
terrific

1148
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:18.870
<v 1>hangover.
But I hate that.
I like it.
Cause to me wine was,</v>

1149
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.280
it was something that rich people did all right.

1150
01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.280
And then it was like the soccer mom thing,

1151
01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:27.510
like there's so many soccer moms out there like they were running joke is,

1152
01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:30.240
is if it's after four o'clock or after five o'clock,

1153
01:02:30.241 --> 01:02:33.450
you don't have a drinking problem if you sit down and have that glass of wine.

1154
01:02:33.451 --> 01:02:34.740
But from what I've heard,
you know,

1155
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:37.220
having kids and that type of shit you need a couple of years

1156
01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:39.930
<v 2>do at the end of the day.
But you have drink if you drink,
you know,</v>

1157
01:02:39.931 --> 01:02:44.040
find some good wine,
you won't get a hangover.
I like a Barolo.

1158
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:45.060
My uh,

1159
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:49.650
my girls a big wine wine connoisseur and she knows she was buying like 15
bottle,

1160
01:02:49.651 --> 01:02:50.730
$20 bottles.

1161
01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:54.540
And I was getting headaches that go the fucking up at the 40 a bottle and then

1162
01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:56.430
it's fine.
You don't get headaches at all,
so it's not,

1163
01:02:56.431 --> 01:03:00.000
it doesn't have to be a hundred dollar bottle,
but yeah,
no wines of wines.
Good.

1164
01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:03.630
Now I love it.
I'm like,
this is fucking great.
It's nice and mellow and chill.

1165
01:03:03.631 --> 01:03:03.850
Yeah.

1166
01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:06.810
Would a meal and I get a little buzz man or it's like I get a little buzz on

1167
01:03:06.811 --> 01:03:09.600
like a glass and a half.
I'm like,
this is fucking awesome.
He said,

1168
01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:13.140
take me like 15 beers and now you know what's weird?
I'm drinking,

1169
01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:14.820
I'm drinking fag beers now.

1170
01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:18.000
I call him all the micro brews and stuff and I was never in the night.

1171
01:03:18.001 --> 01:03:22.380
I was like,
fucking,
what are you drinking it?
What the fuck?
Hell,
it tastes like.

1172
01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:26.690
Just give me a fucking core is light.
Give me a bud,
stop with this shit.
And My,

1173
01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.760
my,
my girl and her whole family drinks,
all those.
And I used to make fun.

1174
01:03:29.761 --> 01:03:33.240
I'm like the fucking Fag Beers,
right?
How can I,
can I want to,
core is light.

1175
01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:36.070
I want a bud light.
I'm not drunk.
I fucking fag beer.
Right.

1176
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:40.590
I don't want to wheat ale summer fuck you.
And now that's all I drink.

1177
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.640
<v 1>Is that right?
Yeah.</v>

1178
01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:47.080
I go to the micro brews just because I feel like I'm sticking it to the man.

1179
01:03:47.081 --> 01:03:50.170
But then I'm like,
who is the man?
The guy who makes Budweiser.
I love that guy.

1180
01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:54.790
Like I'm actually upset that cores light for the first time ever outsold

1181
01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:59.710
Budweiser.
So technically Budweiser isn't the king of American beers right now.

1182
01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:03.760
So I've been ordering more Budweiser trying to help them get up and over the bar

1183
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:07.510
lately.
You know what I mean?
But I'm telling you retain their title,

1184
01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.810
<v 2>those micro brews and all like oh this shit.
Those were the ales and stuff.</v>

1185
01:04:10.811 --> 01:04:12.020
They don't give you a if,

1186
01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:16.160
I mean if you have eight or 10 yeah cause it's more pure.

1187
01:04:16.161 --> 01:04:18.520
And I never bought that shit.
I'm like whatever.
And I'm like,

1188
01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.510
I'm telling you just,
you know,
it's just better for you.

1189
01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:23.240
<v 1>I got the hang of it just came from fucking,
you know,</v>

1190
01:04:23.241 --> 01:04:24.440
you get to hydrate it with all the,

1191
01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.590
<v 2>well that could too,
but know especially the light beers,</v>

1192
01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:30.830
that they weren't something to it to make it light.
It's not fucking natural.

1193
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.400
<v 1>This is such a classic fucking like Bar Room.
Like none of us know.</v>

1194
01:04:35.401 --> 01:04:37.030
We don't know what the fuck was that?
We don't know.

1195
01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:42.260
It's like the alcohol takes out a,
you know,
you had a light process.

1196
01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.540
You fucking drank this some guy who just creaming on me.

1197
01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:46.020
What the fuck you getting a light for?

1198
01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:49.740
You know what's the hardest thing when you're dry to watch as those fucking Sam

1199
01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:51.790
Adams commercials like they,

1200
01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:55.680
they have to be responsible for so many people losing their sobriety when they

1201
01:04:55.681 --> 01:04:59.280
sit there and they fucking snort and the hops like Goddamn Tony Montana,

1202
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:02.310
they got one recently.
The guy literally jumps into the beer,

1203
01:05:02.311 --> 01:05:06.150
he's like swimming in beer and like when you're not,
like,
when I'm drinking,

1204
01:05:06.151 --> 01:05:07.680
I don't even notice those commercials.

1205
01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:10.440
But when I'm not drinking and I fucking see that,

1206
01:05:10.441 --> 01:05:14.380
like I actually get angry at the people at Sam Adams,
like [inaudible],
like,

1207
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:18.640
I don't know who came up with that,
but they're making it so fucking appealing.

1208
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:22.800
Right.
That A,
I dunno,
it th they,
they,
they annoy the shit on me,
but we're,

1209
01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:25.800
we're running out of time here.
We only got like a,
I mean,

1210
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.290
I guess I can go as long as I want,
but I don't want to fucking,
uh,
I go by the,

1211
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:31.840
uh,
the old showbiz adage of leaving them wanting more.

1212
01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:35.200
But that's why my podcast like 18 minutes,

1213
01:05:35.201 --> 01:05:38.490
22 and I love your podcast.
Oh,

1214
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:42.130
me and Paul Versey Paul verse,
he's get does a great,

1215
01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:46.870
he does a great Florentine telling you it's,
it's,
uh,
he got me,

1216
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:49.150
he's wanting to told me that you would do it because I didn't know you were

1217
01:05:49.151 --> 01:05:51.640
doing it.
And he's like,
dude,
he's like,
you gotta listen to Florentines puck.
Oh,

1218
01:05:51.641 --> 01:05:54.700
by the way,
hypey podcasts.
What,
where can people get it on iTunes?

1219
01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:58.960
Just comedy metal midgets.
It's called Jim Florentine comedy metal.
How many?
Yeah.

1220
01:05:58.961 --> 01:05:59.681
It's on my website,

1221
01:05:59.681 --> 01:06:03.500
Jim florentine.com I'm trying to think of how he does the impressions.

1222
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.690
What are you kidding me?
Garbage.
Didn't yell.
Fuck,
fuck.

1223
01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:12.670
Oh yeah.
I know.
Some guy tweeted me a day.

1224
01:06:12.671 --> 01:06:15.850
He goes,
dude,
you sound so miserable when you start your podcast off.
I'm like,

1225
01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:18.000
yeah,
I am.
I'm fucking,
yeah,

1226
01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:21.280
I'm fucking sitting in my office by myself and something fucking bothers me.

1227
01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:24.700
I go,
I'm going to do a podcast about it.
I'm fucking,
I'm,
yeah,
I'm angry.

1228
01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.500
How do you think,
I know you're a big Miami dolphins fan from no one year.

1229
01:06:27.501 --> 01:06:29.650
All these years,
years.
How do you think they're going to be?

1230
01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.300
It could be pretty good.
You know what?

1231
01:06:31.301 --> 01:06:34.740
I got new coaches and Nigga fucking old man parcels out of there.
What?

1232
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:35.830
It's fucking ancient,

1233
01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:40.490
1980s let's get some big bodies on the defensive offensive line.

1234
01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.060
Just stuff to run the,

1235
01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:45.660
and meanwhile it's been a passing league for the last 15 years.
You fat ass hole,

1236
01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:47.500
so thank God he's gone.

1237
01:06:47.501 --> 01:06:51.220
I fucking over write a piece of shit and you know they got a new guy in there.

1238
01:06:51.221 --> 01:06:54.670
He used to run the green bay on offense and they got that Tannehill got a rookie

1239
01:06:54.671 --> 01:06:57.430
quarterback and they got a couple of veterans.
So I'm psyched.
We'll see.

1240
01:06:57.431 --> 01:07:01.390
I mean they make our tenants six,
nine,
seven probably.
But you know,

1241
01:07:01.391 --> 01:07:05.650
new England's a fucking monster always going to be.
Yeah,
we check and Brady man.

1242
01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:08.180
Yeah,
we got lucky going to the Superbowl and you pay,
uh,

1243
01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:12.820
Peyton was out and when the Ravens beat us,
they just fucking choked.
Yeah,

1244
01:07:12.821 --> 01:07:16.300
absolutely.
No,
I paint and the Patriots and Miami's division,

1245
01:07:16.301 --> 01:07:19.900
I got no problem with them cause that's a well coached team and it just fucking,

1246
01:07:19.901 --> 01:07:23.290
they go for the kill.
They don't sit on leads when they're up.
27,

1247
01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:26.020
three is still throwing bombs.
I love that.
Well,

1248
01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:29.120
I know what you're going through as a fan because,
uh,

1249
01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:33.160
I had to deal with fucking Dan Marino.
Like I just was,

1250
01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.470
he just was unbelievable to me.

1251
01:07:35.471 --> 01:07:39.110
That guy is the best quarterback I've like,
he's,

1252
01:07:39.111 --> 01:07:43.450
he's the guy that I saw go from the college to the pro level and make it look

1253
01:07:43.451 --> 01:07:48.280
effortless.
Peyton Manning's a close second.
Yeah.
But,
um,
you know,

1254
01:07:48.281 --> 01:07:51.310
everybody see all these guys fucking breaking Dan Marino's records now it's

1255
01:07:51.311 --> 01:07:53.430
because of all the rules changes that they have.
Marina,

1256
01:07:53.431 --> 01:07:55.690
I always joked that marina would throw for 5,500,

1257
01:07:55.691 --> 01:07:59.320
6,000 yards until he had nobody,
he had no running game.
One of the,

1258
01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:00.670
one of the things that,
that,
uh,

1259
01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.360
I always talk about on this podcast is the fact that people give him shit that,

1260
01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:08.500
you know,
he didn't win a Superbowl and it's like the guy had no fucking defense.

1261
01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:11.590
You guys had like two white quarterbacks at one point.
Oh yeah.

1262
01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:16.150
We had the blackwood brothers [inaudible] yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
The Brood.

1263
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:20.960
<v 2>Yeah.
There was like nine white guys on defense and two black coach and Berg.</v>

1264
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.110
Yeah.
Yeah.
Doug batters and Alicia,
you know what it,

1265
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.330
Marino was telling me a story because I became friends and it was,

1266
01:08:26.331 --> 01:08:29.240
I worked on inside the NFL with them and he's Mike,
my ultimate idol.

1267
01:08:29.241 --> 01:08:33.350
He's the fucking greatest dude ever.
Marino.
He was Tom.
Dan does coordinator,

1268
01:08:33.351 --> 01:08:34.011
defense coordinator,

1269
01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:37.790
Tom Oliver Doddy who was the biggest piece of shit and he'd fucking rush three

1270
01:08:37.791 --> 01:08:40.340
old white guys.
And they would just keep,

1271
01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:44.240
that's why Ken O'Brien was a fucking genius against the g against my only

1272
01:08:44.241 --> 01:08:46.250
against Miami.
The guy was unbelievable.

1273
01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:49.310
He'd rushed three old white guys and they just leave another guy in the blood.

1274
01:08:49.311 --> 01:08:51.940
So it was six against story.
The quarterback had a mill,

1275
01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:53.750
you know all the time the world's,
so anyway,

1276
01:08:53.751 --> 01:08:57.860
he said before to San Francisco of dolphin,
a super ball,
a 49 has dolphins,

1277
01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:01.400
all of a Dadi to in the team meeting did a deep for the defense.

1278
01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.480
Saturday night before the Superbowl told him,
look,
I don't know what we,

1279
01:09:04.530 --> 01:09:07.550
we can't stop this team.
I don't know what to tell Ya.
I ain't got no plan.

1280
01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:10.820
And Marino heard that.
He goes,
dude,
he goes,
just stuck on the side.

1281
01:09:10.821 --> 01:09:14.350
It goes lie to them.
He goes,
fucking lied to him and just say we could.

1282
01:09:14.351 --> 01:09:17.720
We went down a plan because I would do it to my offensive line all the time.

1283
01:09:18.230 --> 01:09:21.580
Coming back and out of it.
You can block Bruce Smith.
No,
I can't.
You can.

1284
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:25.270
He's a fucking pussy.
You can block them.
Just fucking get him on his knees.
It,

1285
01:09:25.271 --> 01:09:29.270
cause I knew we couldn't,
but I gave the guy encouragement.
He goes,
well,
no exam,

1286
01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:33.410
Marino head,
he had no running back.
See like Delvin Williams,
Tony,
Nathan,

1287
01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:37.350
Kareem Abdul,
Sammy Smith,
he had nobody,
he had one guide.

1288
01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:40.280
Grimaldi Jabar gained 1200 yards one season.

1289
01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.850
He only had one running back rush for a thousand yards and a 17 year career.

1290
01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.590
Right.
And then he also had,
he had Don Shula who the game had passed them by.

1291
01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:52.280
Um,
and then who do you have?
Jimmy John's,
Jimmy Johnson.

1292
01:09:52.281 --> 01:09:54.860
Jimmy Johnson seemed like he wanted him out the door the second he got to the

1293
01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:59.170
Johnson hated them.
Right.
Mario told me a great story real quick.
You said,
um,

1294
01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:02.570
that's,
you know,
we're going to go along.
If he hated fucking know.
Damn Marina,

1295
01:10:02.571 --> 01:10:04.040
we're going to hate Jimmy Johnson.

1296
01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.310
Jimmy Johnson was a dick to them and it's a they,
there was no reason for it.

1297
01:10:07.311 --> 01:10:11.210
He goes,
I bought into his plan,
but he,
so anyway,
he said that one time he goes,

1298
01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:15.530
you know,
coach Shula Schuler was a coach.
He goes,
I'll tell you.
He goes,

1299
01:10:15.531 --> 01:10:19.490
Shula had a dog named Zamka.
How fucking bulldog names Onca.

1300
01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.440
That's a fucking coach.
He goes,

1301
01:10:21.441 --> 01:10:24.740
Jimmy Johnson and a little fucking Yorkie that he would bring on the,

1302
01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.520
on the team planes.
He goes,
well,

1303
01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:29.150
we're trying to play buffalo in the championship game.
And he's in,

1304
01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:32.660
he's in the first seat in a fucking plane.
Petten fluffy goes,

1305
01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:35.510
how am I going to fucking win when a coach that brings a fucking six pound

1306
01:10:35.511 --> 01:10:39.800
Yorkie named fluffy and he's fucking got on his lap fucking pet the thing when

1307
01:10:39.801 --> 01:10:42.560
coach Shula has got Sonka,
that's a coach.

1308
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:47.480
The d ever talk about getting annoyed with people talking about him not winning

1309
01:10:47.481 --> 01:10:51.910
a super bowl.
I'm not really,
he just said,
look,
you know what?

1310
01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.690
It's a team game.
What am I going to do?
You know,

1311
01:10:53.691 --> 01:10:56.540
you try and that's all he could do.
But he,
oh,
he,
oh,
he said,

1312
01:10:56.541 --> 01:10:59.180
everyone brings up the fake spike play.
He goes,
you know,

1313
01:10:59.181 --> 01:11:02.080
cause he works out of New York on CBS.
He's always in New York and he's like,

1314
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:06.650
all these jet fans called get den.
You know,
I hated you back then,
but I do like,

1315
01:11:06.651 --> 01:11:10.580
but that fake spike,
you killed us,
you know,
and he says,
he goes,
I just tell him,

1316
01:11:10.581 --> 01:11:14.610
get over it.
Just get over it already.
All right.
It was fricking 1991

1317
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.010
<v 1>get all he did that.
What did that do to them then?</v>

1318
01:11:17.011 --> 01:11:19.530
Knock them out and they weren't.
They were eight and five at the time.

1319
01:11:19.531 --> 01:11:21.870
The judge that we're going there,
we're on a roll.

1320
01:11:21.871 --> 01:11:25.590
They won like six straight and Marino did the fake spike and they didn't win

1321
01:11:25.591 --> 01:11:26.790
another game the rest of the year.

1322
01:11:26.791 --> 01:11:29.460
They went eight and eight and then they went one and 15 and actually they went

1323
01:11:29.461 --> 01:11:31.710
to and 32 after that game.

1324
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.270
What is with fucking New York and Boston?
I don't know if anybody else does it.

1325
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:41.400
They're always into like the,
the,
that old lady curse jinx.

1326
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.330
Like you didn't win another fucking game after that cause you sucked.

1327
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:48.930
That's a load.
That's why,
because you didn't fucking,
you weren't ready to play.

1328
01:11:48.931 --> 01:11:52.350
Not because he liked that whole curse of the babe horseshit.

1329
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:57.300
It completely ignores that.
The ownership of the red sox were like,
you know,

1330
01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:01.140
they could have started the clan with some of their fucking ideas and like the

1331
01:12:01.141 --> 01:12:05.310
whole game changed once Jackie Robinson went in and they completely fucking

1332
01:12:05.311 --> 01:12:09.540
ignored it.
And then also let's say that even if they weren't racist,

1333
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:13.950
like what the Yankees did going from,
you know,

1334
01:12:13.951 --> 01:12:16.410
I mean they got Babe Ruth,
uh,
they bought him,

1335
01:12:16.411 --> 01:12:21.150
but they got Lou Gehrig to Joe Dimaggio to Mickey Mantle.

1336
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:25.410
That's like,
it's like going Jordan to Jordan to Jordan.

1337
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:29.260
One fucking franchise did that and that was the real deal back then when you

1338
01:12:29.261 --> 01:12:32.610
went to spot talent and they came up through your system and it's just like,

1339
01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:37.160
you never going to see that again.
Like,
especially now,
like I'm,

1340
01:12:37.161 --> 01:12:39.390
I'm not a big fan of these,
like these pile on teams.

1341
01:12:39.391 --> 01:12:43.410
I thought it was really weird that Miami got like the shit that they did and

1342
01:12:43.411 --> 01:12:45.330
it's like,
why doesn't anybody shit on the Lakers?

1343
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.620
Like they do just basically every fucking year with what my team,

1344
01:12:49.621 --> 01:12:52.650
the Celtics did in 2008 we thought that title.
Yeah.
You know,

1345
01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:57.130
but the Lakers do it every fucking year and,
and,
and they're like,
Colby,

1346
01:12:57.131 --> 01:13:01.350
he's got five championships.
One more,
uh,
you know,
we equals Jordan.
It's like,

1347
01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.490
dude,
Jordan had Luc Longley and fucking my listeners like bill,

1348
01:13:05.491 --> 01:13:07.980
we've heard this is the only time go fuck yourself.
I don't give a shit.

1349
01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.240
Luc Longley and Fucking,
uh,
Bill Cartwright,
its center.

1350
01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:13.471
And the only,

1351
01:13:13.471 --> 01:13:16.800
the only big guy that I remember them signing was fucking Dennis Rodman.
Yeah.

1352
01:13:16.801 --> 01:13:20.580
Robin they got from Detroit and they had him during his last three productive

1353
01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:23.720
fucking years.
But like a Scottie Pippin,
that was the,

1354
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:28.500
his guy with the head blonde hair dude and Bj fucking Armstrong me break.

1355
01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.940
Yeah.
Well you're right.
Absolutely.
They,
um,

1356
01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:33.930
but also in respect for my listeners,

1357
01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:38.880
my hatred of the Lakers is so fucking blinding that it really kills any sort of

1358
01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:42.060
rational thoughts.
Having said that,
I love Colby.
I love his mentality.

1359
01:13:42.061 --> 01:13:45.960
I loved when he doesn't win a championship and he doesn't just go water skiing

1360
01:13:45.961 --> 01:13:49.620
right after he loses,
he fucking goes right into the front office and is like,

1361
01:13:49.621 --> 01:13:53.250
what the fuck?
Yeah.
Get me some guys like that.

1362
01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:56.130
I wish everybody would do that.
No,
absolutely.

1363
01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.030
I hate when they fucking smile after I just lost a game on and they start

1364
01:14:00.031 --> 01:14:02.450
hugging it out and they started hugging and shit like that.
Say,
hey,

1365
01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:06.630
how's it going at you at the last second and a fucking field goal of 47 yarder

1366
01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:09.870
and then you're smiling and two seconds later,
patting them on the head.
We do.

1367
01:14:09.871 --> 01:14:14.830
We do that as comics.
If we a bad set and fucking fuck.
Yeah,
let's go.
I'm a fuck.

1368
01:14:14.831 --> 01:14:17.920
Yeah.
I'm going to want to sell cds.
Hey,
what's,
that was fucking great.

1369
01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:21.760
It's fucking saying it back a miserable.
Absolutely not.
Well,

1370
01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:24.130
let me ask you this last thing I got to have you on again though,

1371
01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.370
I would love to.
Every guest could be as effortless.
I'm telling you.

1372
01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.720
I appreciate you and dom,
I rare was another one just fucking sat down here.

1373
01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.210
We just,
we came into the house,
shot the shit upstairs,

1374
01:14:34.211 --> 01:14:38.320
came down here and turn on the Mike shot the shit,
turned it off,
walked upstairs.

1375
01:14:38.321 --> 01:14:40.600
It just was seamless.
Um,

1376
01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:45.040
but I was gonna ask you like this new thing that hopefully it's just a fucking

1377
01:14:45.041 --> 01:14:45.874
little blip.

1378
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:49.000
I actually get always refills old to talk about is this new thing where people

1379
01:14:49.001 --> 01:14:53.380
will film a comedian at a fucking comedy club and then you put it up and you

1380
01:14:53.381 --> 01:14:57.550
have to apologize for a fucking joke.
Is that the most insane fucking thing?
It's,

1381
01:14:57.551 --> 01:15:02.110
fuck,
it's,
it's,
it's brutal.
It is just fucking the biggest,

1382
01:15:02.111 --> 01:15:04.100
biggest bunch of fucking pussies.
Well,

1383
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:06.310
you know I love is every joke that they've done it,

1384
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:11.350
the crowd in the club is laughing.
Yeah.
And then they go,
it sparked outrage.

1385
01:15:11.351 --> 01:15:15.250
It's like where,
yeah,
it,
the title tailors their fucking little fucking,

1386
01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:18.130
I'm going to tell you did I said,
I was saying,

1387
01:15:18.131 --> 01:15:21.820
I go basically that come into our work and filming us at a moment that they

1388
01:15:21.821 --> 01:15:24.670
think we're doing something wrong and they've given it to the boss,

1389
01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:28.960
which is our audience or the public and going,
hey,
do something about this.

1390
01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.210
Look what they did.
That's like magic.
I said,

1391
01:15:31.211 --> 01:15:35.050
imagine if we go into someone's work tomorrow and the Guy Smoking Pot at fucking

1392
01:15:35.051 --> 01:15:36.490
lunchtime or he's looking at porn.

1393
01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:39.470
There's computer when he's supposed to doing his fucking pay,
whatever right.

1394
01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:42.700
Doing is fucking spreadsheet.
And we go and we filmed my girl boss,
look,

1395
01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.590
he was looking at porn.
Look,
what are you going to do about it?
But even then,

1396
01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:51.270
I don't think that's a fair comparison because trying out new material is,

1397
01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:55.650
is not smoking weed at work.
He's,
you're doing what you supposed to be doing.

1398
01:15:55.700 --> 01:16:00.190
Know some of the best bits come out of of doing something edgy and there is a

1399
01:16:00.191 --> 01:16:02.950
style,
this shock comedy,
there's dark comedy.

1400
01:16:02.951 --> 01:16:07.090
That is all that type of stuff in feud is fucking sit there and act like you

1401
01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:10.720
hired this guy to,
to to look at.
People aren't here at my fucking opinion.

1402
01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.270
So let me,
I'm sorry.
I said,

1403
01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:17.710
imagine if Redd Foxx and you know it's San Fran and Sundays he was a filthy

1404
01:16:17.711 --> 01:16:19.660
comic.
I mean disgusting on stage.

1405
01:16:19.661 --> 01:16:23.350
Imagine what people were feeling were recording him and going listen to this.

1406
01:16:23.351 --> 01:16:25.450
He wouldn't had a show,
a show or whatever off the air.

1407
01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.350
I know he's talking about eating some girl's asshole,
you know,

1408
01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:31.030
and when no one talked about that in the fucking early seventies,

1409
01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:32.160
I don't think people care about it.

1410
01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:37.000
It would be if he said something about the president or if he says it like this.

1411
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:40.270
Um,
like that toll Dane Cook joke.

1412
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:45.280
He was basically letting people know that this addition of Batman isn't as good

1413
01:16:45.281 --> 01:16:48.130
as the other one.
That's the way I looked at it.
That's what I got out of it.
Yeah.

1414
01:16:48.131 --> 01:16:50.920
He just said it's a shitty movie.
Yeah.
And then people get out.
Yeah.

1415
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:55.680
He's advocating.
He isn't,
he isn't such,
it just,

1416
01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.540
I just stay out of the clubs,
you know,
the wrestling,
the WWE had to apologize.

1417
01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:01.180
So what did it,

1418
01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:03.820
cause they made a joke about what it was such a fucking great joke.

1419
01:17:03.821 --> 01:17:04.960
This manager is,

1420
01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.010
is talking shit to the crowd about the wrestler that he's,

1421
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.100
<v 3>and he's going,
you know,
so and so would have the guy's name is,
he goes,</v>

1422
01:17:13.101 --> 01:17:17.870
he's like Colby Bryant in a Colorado Hotel Room.
Unstoppable.

1423
01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.780
Right.
It was,
and he delivered a big,
it's funny.
Yeah.

1424
01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:25.700
And he not only did you have to apologize,
he had to apologize to somebody,

1425
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:30.850
a specific person who wasn't Colby or the girl.

1426
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:35.030
Right.
I was Mike something or other,
I remember,
you know,
reading and passing,

1427
01:17:35.031 --> 01:17:39.320
but it's like,
it's getting to the point of like,
it's sort of a,
I like,
uh,

1428
01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:40.570
it's ridiculous,
but I,

1429
01:17:40.571 --> 01:17:45.060
I look at it like it's kind of scares me because it seems like,
uh,

1430
01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:49.130
if,
if allowed,
it's the beginning of like,

1431
01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:51.590
you're going to like start censoring people.
They,

1432
01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:54.950
they say in the beginning don't film the comedians.
And that's another thing too.

1433
01:17:54.951 --> 01:17:58.790
None of these comics uploaded that shit to try to,
uh,

1434
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:01.910
reach anybody else other than,
yeah.

1435
01:18:01.930 --> 01:18:04.420
<v 2>Who the fuck they were performing too,
you know?
Absolutely.</v>

1436
01:18:04.421 --> 01:18:06.940
And you know what I mean?
Someone made a good point.
My friend was saying,
he goes,

1437
01:18:06.941 --> 01:18:10.060
you know what I mean?
Basically what they're doing is they're,
it's illegal.

1438
01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:13.210
There are illegally recording you,
right.
You have to,
in most states,

1439
01:18:13.211 --> 01:18:16.650
you have to have permission to record somebody.
So we're basically doing is,

1440
01:18:16.930 --> 01:18:21.090
is doing is illegal by secretly tape recording us.
Right.
You know,

1441
01:18:21.490 --> 01:18:22.360
comedy clubs need to,

1442
01:18:22.361 --> 01:18:25.270
what they have to do is they have to fucking leave everybody's phones and cell

1443
01:18:25.271 --> 01:18:28.900
phones at the fucking,
at the bar before they walk in the room.
Oh,

1444
01:18:28.901 --> 01:18:29.734
they're not going to do that.

1445
01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:32.020
They're not going to that because they want to turn over the crowd quicker.

1446
01:18:32.021 --> 01:18:33.880
They don't give a fuck.
I know it's too bad.

1447
01:18:33.881 --> 01:18:37.210
Someone that you considered considered as art should do that.
Go Look,

1448
01:18:37.211 --> 01:18:39.840
you leave in your fucking phones and I'd record is put them here.
I put them in.

1449
01:18:39.841 --> 01:18:44.260
What I do notice though,
the only people that they ask to apologize,

1450
01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:47.110
there are people who have like hit TV shows.
You know what I mean?
True.

1451
01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:50.400
Absolutely.
So I think,
uh,
I think I'm safe.
I don't know about you.

1452
01:18:50.401 --> 01:18:53.800
You don't have to know.
It's VH one classic.
It's like a basic cable.

1453
01:18:53.801 --> 01:18:57.640
It's only checked the NFL network.
We're only at 40% of homes doing it.

1454
01:18:57.641 --> 01:18:58.780
You know what I actually think.

1455
01:18:58.781 --> 01:19:03.250
I think that they way that into into consideration those groups where they sit

1456
01:19:03.251 --> 01:19:06.880
there and they go,
okay,
how big is Jim Florentine?
How big is bill?

1457
01:19:06.881 --> 01:19:09.730
How big about this guy?
This guy has got like,
you know,
whatever,

1458
01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.300
like what memo on Corolla made fun or like transgender people or whatever.

1459
01:19:13.301 --> 01:19:15.520
He goes,
I don't know what the hell are you are?
Whatever his joke was,

1460
01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.010
he did it on his podcast and they tried to go after him and they go,

1461
01:19:18.130 --> 01:19:21.210
what are they going to take away his podcast?
It's his own podcast,
right?

1462
01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:25.210
He's got like dotcoms you know,
like fucking advertised or whatever.
Then I can,

1463
01:19:25.211 --> 01:19:27.480
he said he doesn't have any and so he didn't apologize.

1464
01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.040
No he didn't Apollo cause they couldn't do anything.
That's perfect.

1465
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:32.500
He's got his own network.
What is it going?
What are they going to do?

1466
01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:37.420
They try perfect.
He didn't say one word.
Fuck Yo.
That's perfect.
I know.
So yeah,

1467
01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:38.283
that's how I look at it.

1468
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:39.710
<v 3>See that's,
that's my thing.
Why,
why,</v>

1469
01:19:39.770 --> 01:19:42.740
why do you want to go to the next level where all of a sudden you have to start

1470
01:19:42.741 --> 01:19:47.140
apologizing for trying out material?
You know,
I get it.
This is the deal.

1471
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:49.450
If I was sick of doing the road,
I would,

1472
01:19:49.770 --> 01:19:54.770
I would be a more apt to want to go that other route.

1473
01:19:55.730 --> 01:19:58.310
But like,
I dunno,
I dunno.
This is this,
this is supposed to be about you.

1474
01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:02.320
<v 2>I'm sitting here fun,
psycho analyze comics.
No,
I hate it.
It's,</v>

1475
01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:06.310
it's the worst thing that can happen.
The comedy.
Yeah,
it's the worst.

1476
01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:10.370
It would be long.
I want to take chances.
Well,
I just look at it,
look,
if they,

1477
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.770
they,

1478
01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:15.390
there is the style of comedy that those people who get offended are looking for

1479
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:20.100
exists out there.
Okay.
You didn't go to that show.
You know,

1480
01:20:20.101 --> 01:20:22.830
you didn't have to click on it.
You didn't have to listen to it.

1481
01:20:22.831 --> 01:20:24.870
You chose to listen to the fucking thing.

1482
01:20:24.930 --> 01:20:29.640
And the guy who said it didn't choose to film an upload it.
Somebody else did.

1483
01:20:29.641 --> 01:20:33.810
So,
I don't know.
I'm talking in circles here.
My mom is 74 years old.

1484
01:20:33.811 --> 01:20:38.370
She's super religious.
She's just watches like touched by an angel all day.

1485
01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:43.110
She found the tool,
my shows in 20 years when the two of my comedy shows,
right.

1486
01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:46.140
So I wanted a vital like six months ago,
mom come to me,
she goes,
no,

1487
01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:47.670
I don't like the words that come out of your mouth.

1488
01:20:47.671 --> 01:20:49.050
You're going to make me uncomfortable.
I go,
look,

1489
01:20:49.051 --> 01:20:51.690
I'm going to be cleaned tonight cause I was working on the clean set.
Right.

1490
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:53.790
And you know what she said?
She goes,
yeah,

1491
01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:55.920
but I don't know about the other acts on the show.

1492
01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.080
I don't know what they're going to say.
So I'm going to stay home.

1493
01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:01.890
That's how does a 74 year old woman get it?
But nobody else does.

1494
01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:04.380
I don't know what the other racks are gonna say,
so I'm going to stay home.

1495
01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:05.460
It makes that choice.

1496
01:21:05.461 --> 01:21:09.000
She didn't want to go into that situation had she gone down there,

1497
01:21:09.810 --> 01:21:12.480
she knows what she's getting herself into.
Exactly.
Done.
She goes,

1498
01:21:12.481 --> 01:21:16.370
well I made that choice to go down there even though my son was in,

1499
01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:19.190
but I went to a show.
How does she get it right.

1500
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:22.200
Does that bother you that she's only come out twice?
No,
not at all.

1501
01:21:22.201 --> 01:21:24.240
Cause I could feel uncomfortable.
What are in the audience?

1502
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:30.480
I said this on TV one time I did George Lopez Jari did stand up on it.

1503
01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:32.790
I said Penis and my act and she's like,
oh,

1504
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:37.920
I can't believe you embarrass the family.
You have nieces.
What?
They sought out.

1505
01:21:37.921 --> 01:21:38.870
What do you I go mom,

1506
01:21:38.871 --> 01:21:43.080
if I start thinking about my fucking 10 year old niece when I'm writing jokes,

1507
01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:47.370
my career's over now how did you with with the mom is religious?
Is that we do.

1508
01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:51.510
Did you rebel against it?
Of Brutal.
It was brutal.
Yeah.
Pro.

1509
01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:56.010
Yeah.
How bad did she make you a dress and like sue on tied it all in the boy,

1510
01:21:56.011 --> 01:22:00.720
all that stuff and you know,
sign me up for die Catholic schools my whole life,

1511
01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:05.400
you know,
put in,
I'm from,
Oh my God.
Oh yeah.
From you know,
kindergarten base.

1512
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:08.350
Now what point will you,
uh,

1513
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:10.980
deciding that this wasn't the road for you,

1514
01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:14.610
was it what the priests were saying or like what,
why?

1515
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:16.400
Probably have after like the third group,

1516
01:22:16.410 --> 01:22:18.960
cause all my friends were in public school and I wanted to hang out with them.

1517
01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:20.030
I was hanging it and you know,

1518
01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:22.400
I just hated it right off the bat and they were like,
no,

1519
01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:24.450
it was a better education on the cow.
How is it?

1520
01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:28.140
I got fucking priest teaching me math.
He doesn't know about fucking math.

1521
01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:33.510
A non is teaching me fucking English,
you know?
Yeah.
That's a better education.

1522
01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:35.910
Right.
You know,
even in high school,
my fucking,

1523
01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:40.560
you went all the way through till senior year house through senior year.
Wow.

1524
01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:44.790
Yeah.
I got thrown out of the two schools.
Two schools for being out of control.

1525
01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:48.870
And what was that?
What was it was out of control.
Why they had these,

1526
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:51.660
they were bragging,
you know what,
I make the announcements in the morning.

1527
01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:53.190
Oh you know what?
Whatever.
You know,

1528
01:22:53.191 --> 01:22:55.110
so you have to say a prayer and all that shit.
So they said,

1529
01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:58.710
oh we just bought these wrestling maps who spent a lot of money on it for a gym

1530
01:22:58.711 --> 01:23:00.210
class.
So please take care of them.

1531
01:23:00.211 --> 01:23:04.230
So fuckings my next gym class later that day I fucking caught him out where

1532
01:23:04.231 --> 01:23:08.290
razor,
it was like fucking $3,000 worth of wrestling match.

1533
01:23:08.291 --> 01:23:11.980
And I cut the fucking stage curtains to why?
I don't know.

1534
01:23:11.981 --> 01:23:16.440
Just cause they said take care of them.
I don't really take care of them.
Be,

1535
01:23:16.441 --> 01:23:18.760
you know.
Okay fine.
I'm going to cut them up with razor blades.

1536
01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:21.850
And how did you get caught?
Well they didn't know it was made.

1537
01:23:21.851 --> 01:23:23.410
They knew it was from us,
from our class,

1538
01:23:23.411 --> 01:23:26.230
cause we were like the last class of a day,
like eighth period or whatever.

1539
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:28.780
So they knew it was somebody in our class and it was only me and two other

1540
01:23:28.781 --> 01:23:30.160
fucking derelicts and a class.

1541
01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:33.370
So they narrowed it down to us three and they had us in the office every day.

1542
01:23:33.371 --> 01:23:36.460
We know you did it.
They'd punch me in the face,
smack me,
pull my hair,

1543
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:39.790
stare at the wall.
We get hours.
Yeah.
And I'm like,
okay,
fine.

1544
01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:42.820
I would stare at the wall.
I wouldn't admit it.
I had a fucking swear on a Bible.

1545
01:23:42.821 --> 01:23:45.400
My mom took me to a,
our local priest and she goes,

1546
01:23:45.401 --> 01:23:47.890
I want you to swear on a Bible.
You didn't do this.
And I swear on a Bible,
ugh.

1547
01:23:47.891 --> 01:23:50.800
And I didn't do it.
Yeah.
Which is hilarious if you don't believe in this shit.

1548
01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:52.840
Yeah.
I'm like,
yeah,
I'll do that.
I'll fucking be up.
Put me,

1549
01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:55.690
give you a whole stack of yeah,
whatever book.
Yeah.
I don't give a shit.

1550
01:23:55.691 --> 01:23:57.880
What puts lashes?
Look,
I'll swear on that toe.

1551
01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:02.140
So did you start partying and that stuff?
Uh,

1552
01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:06.070
he started getting into the weed and drinking probably like 14 or 15 I was good

1553
01:24:06.071 --> 01:24:09.700
in sports.
Like baseball was on the freshman team.

1554
01:24:09.730 --> 01:24:14.440
I was playing on the soccer.
I played on the Varsity team as a freshman.

1555
01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:17.950
But then like sophomore year I started getting into their frigging varsity as a

1556
01:24:17.951 --> 01:24:20.890
freshman.
I was a lefty pitcher.
I was really good.

1557
01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:23.710
At some point I was a good hit or two I played first base,

1558
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:27.530
but then I just started drinking and getting into smoking pot and cigarettes my

1559
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:30.340
sophomore year.
And that was it.
So did you,
did your mom,

1560
01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:32.050
did she and my dad was pissed.

1561
01:24:32.051 --> 01:24:34.750
Did your mom know you were doing any of that stuff?
Not really.

1562
01:24:34.751 --> 01:24:36.610
Cause I had older brothers.
They would kind of like,

1563
01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:38.800
you know that that's why I started getting really metal.

1564
01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:42.520
They'll bring them to concerts at 14 I saw fucking ACDC.
What?
Bon Scott.

1565
01:24:42.970 --> 01:24:46.980
That's another 12 year old kid.
You asset the powerage tour?
No,
it was a,

1566
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:48.130
it was highway to hell.

1567
01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:53.210
Jesus Christ on mom for Ted Nugent at Madison Square Garden.
And I saw him a,

1568
01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:56.410
an ACDC and I forget who else.
I think it was def Leppard.

1569
01:24:56.411 --> 01:25:00.400
Maybe it what bond like two times before he died because my brothers would bring

1570
01:25:00.401 --> 01:25:03.790
me,
I was 12 and they were like 18 and like all we want to bring up.

1571
01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:06.970
So I saw all these shows.
Holy Shit.
Sane.

1572
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:11.230
So you would go from Catholic school to then going down to one of those goddamn

1573
01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:14.770
shows at 12 yeah.
Partying with your older brothers.
Yeah.

1574
01:25:14.771 --> 01:25:17.080
They would like get me high.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Dude,

1575
01:25:17.081 --> 01:25:19.900
you had a fucking awesome childhood now.
It was great.
I mean,

1576
01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:23.410
I was angry because I was fucking stuck in Catholic school and shit like that.

1577
01:25:23.411 --> 01:25:26.290
But yeah.
Uh,
but no,
it was absolutely man.

1578
01:25:26.291 --> 01:25:27.720
But all the brothers would bring home my albums,

1579
01:25:27.730 --> 01:25:30.370
like all the pillows of this black sabbath and his Ted Nugent,

1580
01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:33.130
Aerosmith and my colleague just fucking great.
That's awesome.

1581
01:25:33.131 --> 01:25:37.660
My younger brother's got that out of me.
I was second oldest,
so they,
uh,

1582
01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:39.760
you know,
I didn't know shit.

1583
01:25:39.761 --> 01:25:44.560
Like my first album was a Mitch Miller Sing along with Mitch and the gang.

1584
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:47.740
Okay.
Or shouldn't even know who they are.
They line,
I know.
Yeah,

1585
01:25:47.770 --> 01:25:51.700
they're like Polka.
Yeah.
Won't you come Home Bill Bailey?
Like that type of shit.

1586
01:25:51.701 --> 01:25:56.701
And then I got Aerosmith's greatest hits was my first foray into like fucking

1587
01:25:56.801 --> 01:26:01.390
real music,
but my first concert was a Er doc and Judas priest.

1588
01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:05.840
Nice.
No.
Oh yeah,
no,
it was,
yeah,
that's right.
I was,
I thought it was a loudness.

1589
01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:06.381
It was dark.

1590
01:26:06.381 --> 01:26:10.940
And Judas Priest loudness opened up for ACDC on the who made who tour that

1591
01:26:10.941 --> 01:26:14.450
Japanese heavy metal band.
Um,
there's still around.

1592
01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:18.230
Are they really?
Yeah,
we were going to have the guitar player play on our show,

1593
01:26:18.231 --> 01:26:20.950
but he had a cane.
He couldn't get a,
because you've gone out to go see any,

1594
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:24.800
any of a band's from like the that aren't like huge,

1595
01:26:24.801 --> 01:26:27.680
like the Metallica as the ACDC set are still playing arenas.

1596
01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.680
Like I'll go out to Vegas every once in a while doing a gig out there and I'll

1597
01:26:30.681 --> 01:26:34.310
see like slaughters playing with like fucking warrant a couple other guys.

1598
01:26:34.311 --> 01:26:35.660
Have you gone out to any of those shows?

1599
01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:40.600
I just saw Sebastian Bach last night at and,
okay.
Yeah.
Oh you did?
Oh yeah,
I is.

1600
01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:43.110
How was it?
It was great man.
He still can sing.

1601
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:46.010
He's got a good band behind them and stuff.
So yeah,
I always go see shows.

1602
01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:50.240
Now is he going to get together?
Uh,
with skid row?
He wants to,

1603
01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.250
does one guy in a band that doesn't want to do it?

1604
01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:55.790
The only other guy who can remember rob a few.
So was drama.
Drama.
Yeah.

1605
01:26:55.791 --> 01:26:59.750
Rachel in is to basically make something or like say about guitar player.

1606
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:03.680
So who doesn't want to do it?
I think Rachel,
a bass player,
he,

1607
01:27:03.681 --> 01:27:07.280
he hates a bash and so much that he won't do it and they got offers like 100

1608
01:27:07.281 --> 01:27:10.120
grand to do festivals overseas.
They could do so what,

1609
01:27:10.121 --> 01:27:14.330
what kind of money does that do to have Rachel?
I don't know.

1610
01:27:14.331 --> 01:27:16.790
I guess he gets to publish it on those first couple of records.

1611
01:27:16.791 --> 01:27:17.870
You know youth gone wild.

1612
01:27:17.871 --> 01:27:20.330
I remember you every time I think that that would be trickling down.

1613
01:27:20.331 --> 01:27:25.040
Now the kids are just down like it is just sports stadiums and shit like that.

1614
01:27:25.041 --> 01:27:26.570
I guess he's got money coming in.

1615
01:27:27.690 --> 01:27:29.450
