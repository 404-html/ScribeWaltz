00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.350
Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast?

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.130
I know it isn't.
What am I talking about?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:09.131 --> 00:00:11.710
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast dead.

4
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.290
I'm just checking in on you.

5
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.060
I'm just checking in to see how your God Damn Day is going.

6
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:26.200
I know lately the podcast who spend a little bit quiet.
I understand.

7
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.003
All right.

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.530
I was transitioning from one part of the country to another part of the country.

9
00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:36.520
I didn't have my,
my technologies with me,

10
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.280
speaking of technology now these fucking movies that I want to see right now and

11
00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:45.850
I just don't have the God damn time.
I want to see that Mr. Rogers movie.

12
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.830
I want to see mission impossible and I want to see,

13
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.950
uh,
it was some movie called eighth grade where they were like,

14
00:00:53.951 --> 00:00:57.130
this is what it's like to be an eighth grader and the during the social media

15
00:00:57.131 --> 00:01:00.940
time I'm like,
oh,
I should see that.
You know,

16
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.730
cause I need to relate to some young people.

17
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.750
So my jokes keep working with them.
I mean,
not eighth graders,
but you know,

18
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.410
in a blink of an eye,
the way I'm aging,
that kid will be in fucking college,

19
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.140
right?
You can't ignore the youth,
the ignore the EUC.

20
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.740
You grow old with your fucking crowd.
And then next thing you know,

21
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.360
you're doing shows at three in the afternoon on a little fucking booze cruise

22
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.960
going around the marina.
You know,

23
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.890
five foot two eyes are blue,
but oh,
what those five foots could do.

24
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.950
Are you singing that song has,
hey,
hey Shane,

25
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.580
shame right up there in some fucking mustard stain,

26
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:43.410
tuxedos yelling at your agent plays to sell tickets to this town.

27
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.630
They ain't happen.
And to me,
um,
I'll tell you what did happen to me.

28
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.550
This is very embarrassing and it's of a physical nature.

29
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.560
It's a part of my body.

30
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.590
And this is a time when I feel everybody has been emoting and,

31
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.760
and we've gotten rid of the shame.
So I just want it.
Before I tell you this,

32
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.440
I just want to thank all of you

33
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.030
for being considerate and thoughtful of my feelings during this difficult time.

34
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.340
All right.
So my,
my sciatic nerves
came back.

35
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.971
Oh,

36
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:23.730
it came back with a vengeance because I didn't keep going to the muscles to keep

37
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:27.910
fucking making sure you know,
that,
you know,

38
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.930
whatever the fuck happened the first time it didn't happen again and it got all

39
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:32.400
messed up again.
And uh,

40
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.110
we were trying to figure out what triggers it and like,
well,
flying helicopters,

41
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:41.040
you know,
I fly the smallest one that exists,
so there's,

42
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.350
there's nothing about it that's has to do with comfort.

43
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.910
It all has to do with weight and balance and get in the fucking thing off the

44
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:49.380
ground.
As long as you can sit down,

45
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:52.080
they don't give a shit if you're on a bed of nails.

46
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:55.320
And I think it's just maybe that,
that's what's aggravating it.
She's like,

47
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.620
all right,
what else you got?
I played drums.
I'll sit there for an hour,

48
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:02.080
an hour and a half trying to figure out how their cute little Asian girl played

49
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:06.460
good times,
bad times,
so easily,
effortlessly.
Right.

50
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.170
What else?
I sit in a writer's room,
I fly in planes and all that type of shit.

51
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:14.680
And she goes,
all right.
She was listening and then she just basically told me,

52
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.290
<v 0>okay,</v>

53
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.860
<v 1>in,
you know that my problem is,</v>

54
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.360
is I have no ass.

55
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.990
Over the years I've just sat down so long,

56
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.990
what little ass I had is now gone.

57
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.610
So a bill,
Billy,
no goop,
no glutes,
right?

58
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.560
Is Al Pachino would say he's got no ass.
Right?

59
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.540
So it's just,

60
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.620
it's just essentially bones,
nerves,

61
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.950
veins and arteries and skin.

62
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.560
There's no muscle tone back there.

63
00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:55.890
I basically have Michael Douglas's ass in basic instinct,

64
00:03:55.891 --> 00:04:00.470
whatever that one was when he was like fucking 65 and decided to do the yet.

65
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.790
Remember that was like a big thing with like white guys back then,

66
00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:07.791
be it happy in an old guy and just showing your ass Dennis Franz on fucking Nyp

67
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.260
de Blue,
fucking uh,

68
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.960
Michael Douglas in basic NC state.

69
00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:18.420
One of those movies where he was just fucking throwing chicks around,

70
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.440
which you could never do anymore.
Like it was just,

71
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.130
he was beating them and fucking them at the same time.

72
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.250
And I'll tell you the bride's back in the day,
they loved it.

73
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.080
It was considered a hot seat nowadays.
Oh Jesus.

74
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.160
What was that couch made of?
Dead.
He bent her over.

75
00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:37.560
Was that fucking medata ostrich for

76
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.670
that's offensive to women and nature right now.

77
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:45.910
I don't know what you do.
I don't know.

78
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:48.280
I haven't seen a love seat in this new progressive time.

79
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.320
I imagine the guy is sitting there with his hands folded.

80
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.310
They skills bay.
Would it be all right if I

81
00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.890
<v 0>okay.</v>

82
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.650
<v 1>Leaned across the table and got a little closer to you.</v>

83
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.590
I'm offended.
Um,
anyways,
what am I talking about here?

84
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.640
So I have to do some fucking squats,
you know,

85
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.310
and I got a bone bruise.
I'm falling apart here.
People.

86
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:20.311
I've got a bone bruise on my left knee because my beautiful daughter or I'm

87
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:22.180
loving as I'm teaching her how to play catch.

88
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:25.060
And we've got this giant bag of these plastic balls,
right?

89
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.030
And I think she's right handed,
which I'm not going to lie to you.

90
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:29.880
I want her to be a lefty.
If you're a lefty,

91
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.310
you can get to the show with an 85 mile an hour fast ball.
We all know it.
Okay?

92
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.620
You start throwing right handed.
You got to come with the gas.

93
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:36.600
It's gotta be fucking,
I don't know,

94
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.080
it's gotta be like fucking 102 miles an hour at this point.
So anyways,
she just,

95
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:46.060
she'll pick up two at a time and then she runs at me and just throws them both

96
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:46.930
at the same time.

97
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.480
And I just play like goalie and we got had wood floors and I was crawling around

98
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.020
on the hardwood on my knees and uh,
I dunno,

99
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.430
I thought I fucking towards something,

100
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:01.970
but thank God yesterday I found out it's just a bone bruise so it's going away.

101
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.840
But um,
yeah,
so he is a big deal.

102
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:09.620
I gotta I have to go on the Internet and I got to make sure I do my squats
right.

103
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.630
Okay.
And I have to get my pasty flat ass.

104
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.660
I got to get some padding back there or evidently this is going to,

105
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:19.760
it's going to become even worse.
You know what I mean?

106
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.760
I've decided that I'm going to get fucking,
uh,

107
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.010
I'm going to,
I'm going to get my ass back.

108
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.040
I've decided that rather than be that old white guy who has the inflatable

109
00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:36.760
cushion that he fucking sits on,
I can't be that guy.

110
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.770
You know what I mean?
Taking people up in a helicopter,

111
00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:44.350
like looking like a Badass and like,
hang on a second guys,

112
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.930
just fucking man.
You know,
everybody just loses all confidence.

113
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.510
Does this guy know how to fly this fucking thing?
Um,

114
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.990
anyways,
uh,
that's my deal.
You know,

115
00:06:58.991 --> 00:07:01.900
and I'm also a child of the 80s and you know,
who's kidding who?

116
00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:02.651
Let's all be honest.

117
00:07:02.651 --> 00:07:05.680
Nobody did legs in the fucking eighties unless you're a bodybuilder.

118
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.720
Everybody just,
you barely even did your back.
You know,

119
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.770
everybody was just fucking,
everybody just did like,
what are your bedsheets?

120
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.350
What you been doing dirty?
Put Up to 25 fucking 36 ties.

121
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.700
Kay could try out for the patch dove,
right?
That's all it was about.
And it was,

122
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.010
I'll tell you,
you go to a fucking gym,
all right?

123
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.970
And if you have to bench,
you're waiting for the B.

124
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.160
Going to stand there like a line at Starbucks at like eight in the fucking

125
00:07:38.161 --> 00:07:41.300
morning waiting to get on the bench.
But I'll tell you where there's no fucking,

126
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.660
I'll tell you right now with is no line.
You go into the leg room.
Oh my God.

127
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.770
It's like walking into a furniture store.
Go ahead buddy.
Try them all out.

128
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.410
See which one you like.
Right?

129
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.090
It's like going into light and leave the purple building.

130
00:07:57.091 --> 00:07:59.850
Does that play still exist?
Um,

131
00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:04.340
I'm making a lot of Boston references and you probably like,
why bill?
Are Ya?

132
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.380
Oh,
you fucking cunt.

133
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.730
The battery thing just fucking beat.
Are you fucking kidding me?
I swear to God,

134
00:08:14.731 --> 00:08:17.100
I just can't get a God damn fucking break.

135
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.320
Abs going to talk to this runs out,
I guess in 43 seconds.

136
00:08:23.321 --> 00:08:27.370
42 seconds.
I'm talking Boston ship because the,
uh,

137
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.390
the Yankees,
oh,
when the Yankees come to town,

138
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.310
the red sox Yankees stats tonight and uh,

139
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.630
prices and in and judges out,
right?

140
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.460
But all they're missing as a hitter.

141
00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:45.520
We mentioned missing our star Pitcher and I needed that guy cause I got,

142
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.730
I got a hundred bucks riding on every game with these two different Yankee fans.

143
00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:52.520
50 bucks each.
I need a price to go in there and shut those fucking pin.

144
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:57.510
Stripe comes down.
Now we don't have our ace and in uh,

145
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.420
not price with the fuck am I talking about?
Uh,
the other guy,
their prices.

146
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.070
The Guy I need not to fuck.
All right,
I'm back.
You know what?

147
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:09.720
It wasn't a battery issue.
It was,

148
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:14.130
the memory was full full of me running my fucking Yap.
I'm sitting there.

149
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:17.610
Same prices out.
A sale is out.
Is it Chris Sale?

150
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.750
I've only been on the bandwagon here for the last month.
He's out.

151
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.070
He said he had something that's been building something that's been bothering

152
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:30.690
him.
You know what'd you get your period?
Um,

153
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:35.060
he can't play
fucking a Mike Judge.

154
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.810
Aaron judge is out for the Yankees,
right?

155
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.360
He's standing there like a fucking Paul Bunyan.
I mean,

156
00:09:41.361 --> 00:09:43.420
how do you not hit the guy?
I mean,
Jesus Christ,

157
00:09:43.421 --> 00:09:45.500
he's like the size of the goddamn backstop.

158
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.690
Get a bone chip in the palm of his hand.
Isn't that amazing?
A guy that,

159
00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:51.510
that fucking pig,

160
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.470
all you have to do is throw a ball at his hand and all of a sudden he can't play

161
00:09:54.471 --> 00:09:56.120
a game of baseball.
I mean,

162
00:09:56.121 --> 00:09:58.700
you're talking about a guy who could literally rip the pillars out of the

163
00:09:58.701 --> 00:10:02.990
fucking parking lot,
you know,
and then you hit him in the hand.
He's like,

164
00:10:02.991 --> 00:10:07.430
how am I going to play Patty cake?
I can't come out for the red sox series,

165
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.610
but you know,
that is the history of the Yankees.
You know what I mean?

166
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.090
You know,
they got a lot of free agent guys and they're all really soft,

167
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.210
just like a,
all their fans out in the bleachers.

168
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.660
All those fatties out there that do the roll call.

169
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.400
Like that's the big thing in life,

170
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.740
fe area and wave at us.
It was neck fat,

171
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:34.850
fucking jerk offs out there.
Um,

172
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.360
it's unbelievable that you can have a team that,
that's,
that's successful,

173
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:43.700
that they would,
they would,
uh,
be involved in something.
Well,

174
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.370
I just don't get it.
I don't get the fucking why MCA.

175
00:10:46.371 --> 00:10:49.310
I don't get why we have a fucking mascot.

176
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.310
I don't get why we sing sweet Caroline.
I don't,

177
00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:55.280
you know what it is that they're trying to get rid of the animals.

178
00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.560
You know what I mean?
I mean,
the Yankees fans,

179
00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:00.810
they borderline doing a fucking musical.

180
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.360
I thought it was an advertisement for that.

181
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:06.740
What was that show they had all those years?
Uh,

182
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.630
with the puppets avenue Q.
That's what I thought it was.

183
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.290
I was looking at the scoreboard going said,
coming out of that.
No,

184
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:16.940
those are full grown adult males.
Oh.

185
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:20.630
[inaudible] good.
You roll call or

186
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.740
get alive.

187
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.020
We're going to say your name until you acknowledge us.

188
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.630
And I know I'm coming down hard on the Yankee fans.

189
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.630
I realized this is not all of you guys.
This is all he fucking 12% of you,
um,

190
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.030
with your little gang of baseball fans.

191
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.920
But as much as I do that,

192
00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:48.921
I don't think anything is worse than watch should fucking Dude Dubai Buddo do

193
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.640
Bateau and that song comes on.

194
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:53.280
You see all those women putting their head on their boyfriend.

195
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:55.683
You know what I mean?

196
00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:01.830
That right dead that moment there is why women in general are not in positions

197
00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:03.520
of power.
They sit there,

198
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:08.521
they try to blame guys specifically bald blue eyed white males like myself,

199
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.250
which by the way,
I'm really offended.
Okay.
I mean,

200
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.720
and I got to tell you something right now.

201
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:19.080
If I hear one more feminist interrupting my privilege during the day,

202
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:25.330
me just walking through one open door after another and I have to listen to her

203
00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:29.950
fucking rhetoric.
I swear to God I am.
I am going to,

204
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.700
I will pull all of my money out of the stock market and cause it to crash money

205
00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:40.771
that I didn't earn money that was given to me from my ancestors by stealing it

206
00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:44.860
from people who did not look like me.
Okay.

207
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.800
Sorry,
I'm just steering into the stereotype.
Um,

208
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.710
oh really built.
We thought you were fucking serious.
Uh,

209
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.000
what am I talking about here?
This is why women,

210
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.320
it's so many of them do not attain a position of power because all you have to

211
00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:05.770
do is put on sweet Caroline and it makes them want to tilt their head and put it

212
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:10.540
on their man's shoulder.
Okay?
That is not leadership quality.

213
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.870
Okay?
That's,

214
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.170
that's what the fuck I would do if I was running a company right now and God

215
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:21.430
knows it be all this fucking pressure as the guy who started the company to step

216
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:25.990
aside and let a woman run it,
Z can act like you're fucking progressive.

217
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.720
You know what I mean?
Where are the ladies when it's all being built?

218
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:35.190
They're nowhere to be found then when it's built,
hey,
we want to do it tow.

219
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.840
Now that you completed it.

220
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.700
We want to fly planes too.

221
00:13:40.701 --> 00:13:44.180
Now that all the guys died and we figured out what not to fucking dope.

222
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.270
No offense to Amelia Earhart,
the chick that fucking,
uh,
also crushed it,

223
00:13:51.271 --> 00:13:54.650
but for some reason nobody talks about her.
Um,

224
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.200
I talking about,
I'm just fucking around everybody.

225
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.440
I have no problem with people of Eddie.
Fuck it back.
Grab the epitope.

226
00:14:04.441 --> 00:14:09.430
It though.
Um,
where am I?
Let me,
uh,

227
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.590
let me,
let me complete this.

228
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.570
<v 2>Okay.</v>

229
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.390
<v 1>I have to do a fucking radio tour for two hours starting at eight minutes.</v>

230
00:14:15.391 --> 00:14:17.010
And how long have I done in the podcast?

231
00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:21.630
Is it going to work out with a math workout?
Nine in five are 14,

232
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.390
son of a bitch.
I still got half a podcast to go.
I'm gonna have to wait.

233
00:14:24.391 --> 00:14:27.700
Wait till the end of this shit.
Um,
Oh bill,
why are you doing a radio tour?

234
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:32.701
Because I'm promoting rough and rowdy going to be in Youngstown,

235
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.300
Ohio.
All right.
There's no women.

236
00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:40.480
They're putting their heads on their guy's shoulder.
They put their head,

237
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.720
their ear does the guy's chest after they hit him with a fucking pen and make

238
00:14:43.721 --> 00:14:45.460
sure it's fucking heart's still pumping.
Okay.

239
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.690
I'm talking a tough town and Youngstown.
It's going to be great.

240
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:52.280
We got pride versus prejudice.
All right?

241
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:57.380
We have a gay man who's fighting a convicted felon who does not like gay people.

242
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.710
All right?
We got a cop fight and a skateboarder,

243
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.400
and now we've got a bunch of Cleveland Brown fans getting in the ring with

244
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:05.520
Pittsburgh Steeler fans.

245
00:15:05.521 --> 00:15:09.650
And that God knows the browns cannot beat the Steelers on the grid iron.

246
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.210
But can the people of Cleveland beat up the people of Pittsburgh?

247
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:15.980
Now you'd think generally speaking,

248
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:19.910
the people of Pittsburgh are a little softer than the people in Cleveland.

249
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.040
All right?
They have six super bowl titles.

250
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:26.480
They haven't had a fucking steel mill in generations out there.
Okay.

251
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:29.750
I've gone there.
It's a tech city now.
All right?

252
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.130
They got all the beautiful bridges.
They got rid of three rivers.

253
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:38.090
The team plays on natural grass now.
I mean,

254
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:40.700
it's one of the quaintness towns you'll ever go to.

255
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.720
Nobody can walk up this fucking hill.

256
00:15:42.721 --> 00:15:45.830
So they got a God damn elevator trolley thing that brings you up.

257
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.740
I think Pittsburgh is ripe for the taking

258
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:55.500
and uh,
go to rough and rowdy brawl to order the fight.
I'm telling you right now,

259
00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.460
hang with the recorded or hanging that night with your buddies.
Watch it.

260
00:15:59.461 --> 00:16:04.140
It's going to be a,
I will be commentating,
forgot to mention that,

261
00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.420
that says a little cherry in there that I just throw.
Okay.

262
00:16:06.421 --> 00:16:08.880
Little fucking sugar cube.
Oh freckles.

263
00:16:08.881 --> 00:16:12.900
We'll be sitting down on his lack of an ass evidently.
And uh,

264
00:16:12.901 --> 00:16:16.650
I'll be there with the big cat in the El Pres.
Uh,

265
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.970
two wonderful individuals,
you know,
who are preventing a lot of bar fights.

266
00:16:20.971 --> 00:16:22.440
I feel,
I feel like,
um,

267
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.020
people with headgear and gloves are going to be able to get all their

268
00:16:25.021 --> 00:16:28.590
frustrations out.
It's going to be a wonderful night of entertainment.

269
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:33.510
I am not going to miss a second of it and um,
you know,

270
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.160
I would appreciate it if you guys would order it.

271
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.800
It would make me look good if I could help pump up their fucking numbers.

272
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:42.800
I love what they do over there.
I hope you do too.
If you do,

273
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:46.370
please order the fight and that's the end of this problem.
How do you like that?

274
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.390
And right the day before the fucking fight,
I'm going to be in Rochester,

275
00:16:50.391 --> 00:16:51.970
New York home mystique for Gad,

276
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.550
or at least he played with the Rochester Crusaders according to his,

277
00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:00.730
according to his drum instructional video that I actually own on VHS and on DVD.

278
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.330
All right.
I never could commit to the laser disc.

279
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.960
I was afraid of unpopular technologies.

280
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.830
After Robert Kelly talked me into getting a mini disc player,

281
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.650
which I still have with the t shaped microphone.
I can't find the chat,

282
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:23.150
but I have all these little fucking cassettes of uh,

283
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.553
you know,

284
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:30.920
wherever many cds of my sets from years gone by and I want to listen to them.

285
00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:32.870
And people like,
well,
why don't you take him somewhere?
It's like,

286
00:17:32.871 --> 00:17:36.500
cause I have no idea what I'm saying on these fucking thanks.
All right.

287
00:17:36.501 --> 00:17:38.750
I used to mutter to myself between sets,

288
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.460
throwing out all kinds of crazy shit and in this fucking today's climate,

289
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.430
God knows what,
what the shit you said fucking,
um,

290
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.190
when we're talking 20 years ago,

291
00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.780
<v 3>been 20 years ago,
I was dating this woman.</v>

292
00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:57.110
I used to literally drag around the city by her hair and nobody had a problem

293
00:17:57.111 --> 00:17:57.800
with it.
Okay.

294
00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.530
You think I'm going to dump off my fucking mini display or to somebody,

295
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.410

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:25.470
<v 0>Okay.</v>

301
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.660
<v 3>I was in such a good mood when I would wake up in the morning,</v>

302
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:32.370
but I was so grumpy at night,
you know,
just happened to sit there and fucking

303
00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.960
stare at the wall.
Um,
I,

304
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.680
it's weird like this,
this time of day,
I don't miss it,

315
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.190
There's nobody on the planet like you.
Little fucking so.

316
00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:21.600

All right,

337
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.930

The truth is most of us are brushing our teeth wrong,

338
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:49.510
not long enough and forget to change
our brush on time.

339
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.420
Former porn stars,
gagging on it.

340
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:57.610
That's because most brands focus on selling flashy gimmicks rather than better

341
00:20:57.611 --> 00:21:02.020
brushing but not quip.
So what makes quip so different?

342
00:21:02.021 --> 00:21:05.530
You may not have asked.
Uh,
please mention I'll talking points below.

<v 6>Wow.</v>

428
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:59.580
<v 1>Um,
and uh,
yeah,
I have really had no intentions.</v>

429
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.880
I'm going to drink one day next week celebrating with Joe to Rosetta Stone.

430
00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.790
Rose his birthday on August six.

431
00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:09.360
Make sure you give all twinkle toes a little shout out.
All right.

432
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.150
Make sure you get that little saloon whore.

433
00:27:11.151 --> 00:27:15.870
A little tippy of fucking cowboy hat day.
He'd love to hear from you.
Uh,
Joe,

434
00:27:15.871 --> 00:27:19.950
by the way,
is really an incredible inspirational speaker on a,

435
00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.080
have you guys seen Joe de Roses?
Uh,

436
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.760
Instagram mean he has.

437
00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:30.870
He's sitting there shirtless with his awful bodies.
Like he always goes,

438
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:33.060
what's up hard bodies?

439
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.200
Joe To Rosie here telling you that you don't have to be a slave to your diet.

440
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.470
I Dunno.
Just look up at Joe de Rosa or is it at Joe to Rosa comedy?

441
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.520
Just look up Joe de Rosa Instagram.
Maybe I can do it for you.

442
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:50.370
I'll make it easy for you because she's felt you're probably pretending to type

443
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:54.780
right now.
Acting as though you're working a Joe to Rosa Instagram.

444
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.340
He's on the gram.
Oh,
and I'm not connected to the fucking Internet course.

445
00:27:59.341 --> 00:28:04.110
Why would I be,
why would I in this day and age be connected to the Internet?

446
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.120
It's just most of the free world is.

447
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:11.430
Most of the free world is right there connected to it.
They're connected.

448
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.670
They're connected to the know.
I don't,
let me type this in here.

449
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.970
Brow at all.
Right.

450
00:28:17.971 --> 00:28:22.460
Joe To Rosa.

451
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.690
Instagram right away.
All right GRANDPA.

452
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:33.500
It's at Joe to Rosa comedy.
J.
O.
E d e

453
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.030
<v 5>R.
O.
S.
A</v>

454
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:39.490
<v 1>comedy.
Um,
there you go.
Why don't,</v>

455
00:28:39.491 --> 00:28:42.100
why am I hyping his Goddamn Instagram page?

456
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.860
What does Joe to Rosa ever done for me?

457
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.420
Other bench other than being being a power for the last fucking 15 years.

458
00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.360
Um,
all right.
What the what to talk about?

459
00:28:54.361 --> 00:28:58.170
I was just promoting rough and rowdy by the way,
the cop versus the skateboarder.

460
00:28:58.171 --> 00:29:01.110
That fight is actually,
that one's called pig versus punk.

461
00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.970
So you get pride versus prejudice.
Pig Verse Punk,
Eh,

462
00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.060
uh,
where could you go from there?

463
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.380
Palookaville [inaudible]
it'll boxer fight.

464
00:29:14.381 --> 00:29:19.110
Say a politician.
That could be a good one.

465
00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.670
They should have just sort of an,
uh,
an endless one foot with the letter P.
Huh?

466
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:29.800
You could have a,
somebody with a bladder problem.

467
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:34.050
Peer verse
poorer.

468
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:39.730
Go the bladder problem.
Fight somebody who's a economically,
uh,

469
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:44.290
in the Shit House.
I don't know.
Okay.
Maybe there's not an endless one.
I Dunno.

470
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.650
Maybe I'm wrong.
I'm just spit balling here people.

471
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.200
It's all I'm trying to do.
Just spit balling.
So anyways,
I got to,
uh,

472
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.270
I'm going to go see a nutritionist for the first time ever tomorrow and uh,

473
00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.620
I'm going to get that taken care of.

474
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.710
I did the lat pull down machine 70 fucking pounds.

475
00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:06.400
Gradually I'm putting it back together the way it really happens.

476
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.870
Not like on Dr Phil where he's like,
yeah,

477
00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.570
all you need to stop,
pause,

478
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.820
trigger her in the face and like somebody who I would actually punch a woman to

479
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.890
face the fact that he said that like it's going to get rid of everything that he

480
00:30:20.891 --> 00:30:25.600
saw as a child in that moment on Dr Phil Stout works.
That's going to be,

481
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:29.320
it's going to take that guy in an entire lifetime to stop punching women in the

482
00:30:29.321 --> 00:30:33.370
face or shooting heroin or jacking off in public whenever the fuck it is he's

483
00:30:33.371 --> 00:30:36.820
doing.
Right.
But not all Philly.

484
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:41.050
Philly makes it seem like he solves it right then in there with a little fucking

485
00:30:41.051 --> 00:30:43.360
catch phrase is some bullshit.
That's why,
you know,

486
00:30:43.361 --> 00:30:47.350
back in the day when I used to watch police academy and I would see private

487
00:30:47.351 --> 00:30:49.990
hooks under the cute little black girl,
you know what I mean?

488
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.350
And she'd be all mousy,
like,
hey,
you hit that kick and the guy,

489
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.171
you got to get a scream.

490
00:30:54.171 --> 00:30:57.690
And then in the end she'd get her nerve up and she jumped out of nowhere with a

491
00:30:57.691 --> 00:31:00.250
gun out and she goes,
don't move dirt bag.

492
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.030
And then you'd see police academy to when she'd go back to being this little

493
00:31:04.031 --> 00:31:07.780
mousy person again.
And you're like,
what the fuck?
Okay,
that's bad writing.

494
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:09.820
That's what I thought.
That's lazy.

495
00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:14.230
You're going to have to do the exact same arc all the way to don't move dirt bag

496
00:31:14.231 --> 00:31:16.870
again.
And I used to think that that was lazy writing,

497
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:21.210
but now having tried to,
to fix,

498
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:27.370
to control my temper,
no,
I'll flip out,
be like,
I don't want to do that again.

499
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.170
And then I'm fucking,
you know,
working on a,

500
00:31:30.171 --> 00:31:32.860
working on a working on and I'm good for three weeks and then I,

501
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.980
I have a relapse.
You know,

502
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.880
private hooks is one of the most accurate characters ever,

503
00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.540
ever written because you seeing somebody trying,

504
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:46.420
they have a breakthrough and you think,
is this it that I finally break through?

505
00:31:46.421 --> 00:31:48.310
And then,
uh,
nope,
it was just a blip.

506
00:31:48.311 --> 00:31:52.120
Now you're going back to being mousy again and she had to work on it through

507
00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:56.380
like 1819 police academies and I don't know if she ever got there,

508
00:31:56.381 --> 00:32:00.610
but I think we all could relate simply by the fact that she was just out there

509
00:32:00.611 --> 00:32:05.470
trying.
There you go.
So that's nine minutes,

510
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:09.070
nine minutes and 13 minutes.
That's 31 minutes.
Jesus Christ.
People.

511
00:32:09.071 --> 00:32:10.210
I think I'm done here.

512
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:15.940
I'm back up to regular volumes.
Tune into the red sox,

513
00:32:15.941 --> 00:32:19.480
Yankees if you want to check that out.
Um,

514
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.120
but definitely this Sunday man,
make me look good.

515
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:25.660
Make it seem like I drove some traffic to this wonderful event.

516
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:30.870
Go to rough and rowdy brawl.com to watch pride verse prejudice pig first punk

517
00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:38.830
and Cleveland Brown fans trying to do with the browns have never done on the

518
00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.310
field,
which is beat something

519
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:42.200
<v 3>from Pittsburgh.
Ah,</v>

520
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.600
why did you have to be mean?
Because you know what?
It makes people listen.

521
00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.050
All right.

522
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:48.980
<v 7>Enjoy this music.</v>

523
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:53.060
And then we'll have another half hour of greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon

524
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:57.080
podcast just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast,

525
00:32:57.081 --> 00:33:01.010
and the Thursday gone by from years ago or possibly last month.

526
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.870
I don't know how it works.
God bless you.

527
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.520
Have a great weekend and a two and then I'll be dressed in shabby.

528
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:11.210
I'll be in Youngstown for the first time ever.
And everybody else see you.

529
00:33:11.211 --> 00:33:15.290
Rochester in New York on Saturday night with the Great Dean del Rey in the

530
00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:19.040
opening slot.
All right,
God bless you.
And then United States of America.

531
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.513
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

532
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:14.490
<v 3>So at the beginning of fucking $6 million man,</v>

533
00:34:14.491 --> 00:34:17.700
you know when that little fucking kite that he's fought flying,

534
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.400
why don't they ever show that fucking show in reruns?

535
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:24.180
That's one of the greatest goddamn shows ever.
Do you guys ever see that?

536
00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:29.310
You have any idea how fucking huge it was when the $6 million man fought the $7

537
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.143
million man

538
00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:43.830
and he punched his fucking face off his face came off

539
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:53.270
on television in like 1974 do you have any fucking idea?
Think about that.

540
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:57.620
Pre Internet,
pre cable,
pre any sort of special,

541
00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.500
if you look how bad the graphics weren't,
Star Wars,

542
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.320
<v 8>the judgements between frames,</v>

543
00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:06.610
all the tiny moving parts are minuscule but projected at the proper speed.

544
00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:11.740
24 frames per second.
These individual movements will flow seamlessly together.

545
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:19.750
Actually models which can be carried in the palm of your hand.

546
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.701
<v 3>Since like three,</v>

547
00:35:20.701 --> 00:35:25.701
four years before that Lee Majors Punch this dude who was the fucking bad guy in

548
00:35:27.471 --> 00:35:30.350
everything.
Oh Man.

549
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.410
Do you remember the one where the $6 million man fight up fucked in the snow?

550
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:36.743
<v 0>Yeah.
Fuck.</v>

551
00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.470
<v 2>Okay.</v>

552
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.480
<v 1>Good.
As an expert and a French author [inaudible]</v>

553
00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.910
<v 3>outside that mansion and they had everybody in slow motion and that black dude</v>

554
00:35:45.911 --> 00:35:49.570
jumped like 10 feet in the air was going to kick him.
He's going,
yeah.

555
00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:50.923
<v 9>Wow.</v>

556
00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:53.680
<v 3>Flying through the fucking air.</v>

557
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.390
Are you going to stand how sheltered I was as a kid.

558
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:03.010
I didn't even know who Bruce Lee was.

559
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.690
I don't even know what Kung Fu fighting was.

560
00:36:04.691 --> 00:36:09.240
And I didn't realize that TV shows were ripping off,
you know,
uh,

561
00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:12.320
enter the dragon and all that shit that people were flipping out about.

562
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:15.580
Cause I was just a little kid.
So I saw that shit.
I,
I,

563
00:36:15.581 --> 00:36:18.400
it was the most unbelievable thing ever.
He fought big foot.

564
00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:23.230
He fought a black Bruce Lee and he fought the $7 million man and he punched his

565
00:36:23.231 --> 00:36:27.490
fucking face off and tell them they just don't,
they don't make,

566
00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:32.350
it's impossible to compete now that's just,
they've just done too many things.

567
00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:37.300
You know.
It's Kinda like when you go to write a movie script,
you're like,
oh,

568
00:36:37.301 --> 00:36:38.380
everything's been done.

569
00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:41.710
And they act like all these guys back in the forties and 50s were brilliant.

570
00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.770
It's like fuck you.
There was only like five movies were ever made.

571
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.480
How hard was it to be brilliant back then?

572
00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:50.950
It's like inventing shit and eat in the 18 hundreds oh look,

573
00:36:50.951 --> 00:36:55.120
it's a coat hanger.
You can hang your coat on it.
Holy Shit.

574
00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.700
Let's put his name in the history books.

575
00:36:57.701 --> 00:37:00.100
Everyone can fucking remember this for the rest of the time.

576
00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.530
I don't even know what you could event.
You always great.

577
00:37:02.531 --> 00:37:06.610
It's still inventing a simple shit.
Is that Billy Mays guy?

578
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:09.720
You know that Baird if fuck every night he just starts swab

579
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:10.900
<v 1>Billy Mays.</v>

580
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:15.850
I Billy made sure for the Jupiter Jack the most convenient hands free device for

581
00:37:15.851 --> 00:37:18.100
any cell phone guaranteed.

582
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.240
<v 3>That dude,
he doesn't even event the shit.</v>

583
00:37:21.241 --> 00:37:24.630
I think he invented like three things and then he's just got a sweat shop but

584
00:37:24.631 --> 00:37:29.040
like smart fucking kids from Thailand and he just comes walking in.

585
00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:32.820
I keep Barda myself on the iron.
Come up with some shit.

586
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:35.800
Then like three weeks later he's on TV.
Yeah.

587
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:36.930
<v 1>Billy Mays.</v>

588
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:42.270
Are you tired of burn their hair off your forearm or your art and your putting

589
00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:46.500
down cause your third marriage didn't work out and you still have to date and

590
00:37:46.501 --> 00:37:47.460
your fifties

591
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:54.530
hey dosing the fucking thing you stick in front of the iron that doesn't burn

592
00:37:54.671 --> 00:37:56.850
your forearm but still irons the fuck.

593
00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:01.450
<v 3>Good shirt.
Um,
anyways,
Oh let me get,</v>

594
00:38:01.451 --> 00:38:03.970
let me get back to this thing.
Sorry.
Huh?
See like that.
There you go.

595
00:38:03.971 --> 00:38:06.430
I wanted to stand up.
Mo gave you some fucking laughs.
Okay.

596
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.830
<v 1>And his left eye.
What does his I do,
it's like a zoom lens on a camera.</v>

597
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.500
A Zoom Lens.
Amazing.

598
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.610
<v 3>It's like a bounce.
So anybody want watch 60 minutes.</v>

599
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.130
This past week they did a,

600
00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:03.290
they did this feature and that feature on mountain lions and all California is

601
00:39:04.141 --> 00:39:09.141
the only state that has mountain lions just walking around

602
00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:14.620
<v 10>Los Angeles and its suburbs are home to 19 million people.</v>

603
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.950
The only mega city in the world where mountain lions,

604
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:23.160
also known as cougars and Pumas live side by side with humans for 13 years.

605
00:39:24.521 --> 00:39:27.160
The National Park Service has been studying the animal.

606
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:30.120
<v 3>Uh,
I'm going to fuck this up in a,
in a park,</v>

607
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:36.020
I guess maybe the size of like Griffith Park or Runyon Canyon or or whatever

608
00:39:36.451 --> 00:39:39.810
those ones are out.
Uh,
out in the valley,

609
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.850
<v 10>22 wanders the hills of Griffith Park,</v>

610
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.700
a small enclave in Los Angeles,

611
00:39:45.701 --> 00:39:50.680
frequented by hikers and visitors to the parks.
Famed Observatory.

612
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:54.630
<v 3>I guess they have these fucking things.
And,
um,
so anyways,</v>

613
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:59.660
I was watching it because a few of the places where I hike with my dog and this

614
00:39:59.941 --> 00:40:01.820
thing has intermittently,
this does,

615
00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:05.040
this group of fucking mountain lions has been around there.

616
00:40:05.041 --> 00:40:07.350
But fortunately they try to avoid you,
I guess

617
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:13.380
<v 10>a trail camera caught this one,
a stone's throw from the rooftops of suburbia</v>

618
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.520
<v 3>and these animals do their best to,
you know,</v>

619
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:21.090
stay elusive and away from us,
um,

620
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.130
at least during the day if they're not fucking hungry.

621
00:40:23.131 --> 00:40:27.690
But they showed this fucking,
uh,
these people,
these mountain lion,
right.

622
00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.210
Okay.
They were having some work done.

623
00:40:30.211 --> 00:40:34.320
So they had somebody going underneath the house into the crawl space of the

624
00:40:34.321 --> 00:40:36.270
house and they will write up against this park.

625
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.290
And the guy went down there and he immediately came back up and he was fucking

626
00:40:40.291 --> 00:40:44.970
like white as a ghost and they were like a dawn.
That is,
you know,

627
00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:49.290
fucking white people trying to speak Spanish.
Right.
Oh eight.
Um,

628
00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:51.960
is it French?
I don't know.
Um,

629
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:57.690
and a guy comes out of the fucking hall and was like,
yeah,
man,
I fucking,
uh,

630
00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.990
there's a mount line down there.
I just came faced tonight.
Get outta here.

631
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.480
You're shy,
I guess.

632
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:10.230
And they will like,
he's like,
yeah,
it's fucking down there.
And,
and so anyways,

633
00:41:10.231 --> 00:41:13.860
they interviewed this fucking La couple and they had the quintessential fucking

634
00:41:13.861 --> 00:41:14.880
la couple.
Okay.

635
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:19.670
<v 11>A mountain lion in your house,
Bro.
And Shy.
He said that on the mountain lion.</v>

636
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.100
He goes,
yeah,
man.
Face to face,

637
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:26.480
eye to eye to eye with me.
And he music terrified.

638
00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:31.810
<v 3>You know what I mean?
He looks like the leading man of a B movie,
right?</v>

639
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.040
She's got like bleach blonde hair.
She's

640
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.940
<v 1>wearing,
fuck me pumps.
She's on 60 minutes.
Where in fuck me pumps.</v>

641
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:42.780
It's fucking hilarious.
Walking around,
done up to the nines.
And uh,

642
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:48.020
I actually,
uh,
it was pretty cool.
I was trying to figure out where the house was.

643
00:41:48.021 --> 00:41:52.010
I Google mapped it and I think I was able to find it,

644
00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.530
but I'm a fuck.

645
00:41:54.531 --> 00:41:58.940
The state is so fucking insane with the droughts,
the fires,

646
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.150
the rattlesnakes,
the coyotes,
the mountain lions.

647
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.690
You know what everybody's saying?
This place is so phony and so plastic.
Well,

648
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:10.340
you know,
it can get,
uh,
that can all go away pretty damn quick with the wildlife.

649
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.050
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

650
00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:35.620
<v 3>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

651
00:42:35.621 --> 00:42:39.340
It's built bar and it is the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

652
00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:44.420
August 2nd,
2010.
Oh my God.
Martha,

653
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.150
can you believe it?
It's already August.
Could you believe it Martha?

654
00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.340
Actually,
I can't Karen,

655
00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:55.720
because it was just July in my entire life.

656
00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.200
August has come after July,
so yes,

657
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:04.620
I can believe that it's August 2nd.
Why do you have to do that?

658
00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:09.330
Do what that,
you know,
why can't you just,

659
00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:13.500
you know,
have frivolous conversation?
Why do you have to be,

660
00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:18.410
why do you have to be such a cunt?
No,
I'm sorry.
Well that's what's your big,

661
00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.740
um,
anyway.
Oh,
O g h.
Oh my God.

662
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:29.450
What the fuck did I do last night?
I was going to do the podcast last night.

663
00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:32.720
That was the plan.
Boys and girls,

664
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:37.250
ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages.

665
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:41.000
I was going to do the podcast last night,

666
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:44.780
I was going to upload this motherfucker a midnight my time,

667
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.720
you know,
for all my friends out there and the fucking,
uh,

668
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:52.730
Great Britain out there in Ireland and Iceland,
you know,

669
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:56.000
that'd be like eight o'clock in the morning for you.
Right?
You get up,

670
00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:00.650
you people in Iceland throwing down some hay for your fucking Jakks,

671
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:04.190
taking out your pan flute,
skipping around,
looking for the gold.

672
00:44:04.191 --> 00:44:08.030
He's not what you do out there.
Yeah,
well that's what I think it though.

673
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:12.000
Cause I took geography and America.
Yeah.

674
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:16.050
So you know what's up,
Holla and how's your windmills?

675
00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:20.900
Now you're clicking your fucking wooden shoes together.
That's my version.

676
00:44:20.901 --> 00:44:22.940
That's my version of hall.
And they don't even have cell phones out.

677
00:44:22.941 --> 00:44:27.020
Their cell phones is still using pitchforks to get their point across.

678
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.700
Um,
that didn't even make sense.
But what did I do instead?

679
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:38.130
You know,
this is the classic life of the loser.
All right?

680
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:41.910
And if you are a loser,
not saying you are,
okay.

681
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.270
Hypothetically,
if you are a loser,

682
00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:48.870
you're going to recognize this pattern.
Okay?

683
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.880
And this is the pattern of the loser.

684
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:56.750
You'll see the loser knows what he or she is supposed to do and the and,

685
00:44:57.031 --> 00:45:01.080
and then you never do it,
and that is a pattern of a loser.
All right?

686
00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:02.310
Did they make any fucking sense?

687
00:45:02.311 --> 00:45:07.311
It started like I was gonna make this huge fucking point and then my headache

688
00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:10.140
really just kicked in there,
but let's,
let's try it.

689
00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:13.020
Let's try to put the wheels back on the cart here.
All right.

690
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.820
Just like those people.
I'm out there in Finland right now

691
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:26.190
and all the people down and fucking Australia wrestling those poisonous snakes

692
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:30.090
as the aborigines fucking sit there with that.

693
00:45:30.091 --> 00:45:34.140
That white God damn tooth sticking through their nose.

694
00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:39.030
You know that shark tooth that Greg Brady had around his fucking neck when he

695
00:45:39.031 --> 00:45:40.920
was going to be the next Johnny Bravo

696
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.600
just sitting there fucking staring at me.
They're aborigine,
man.

697
00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:47.520
You think I need that shit?
You think?

698
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:50.010
You think I'm the one who kicked you off your fucking land?

699
00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.440
I'm a Goddamn indentured servant to the fucking banks.

700
00:45:55.441 --> 00:46:00.150
They're half naked aborigine dude.
All right.
To Stop fucking staring at me.

701
00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.800
All right.
With Your Thong.

702
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:11.430
You're fucking sad face.
All right.
I didn't create plastics.

703
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.140
I'm just dealing with it.

704
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:18.660
Why don't you show me how to fucking join whatever it is your thinking about

705
00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:21.090
rather than fucking judging me.
And by the way,

706
00:46:21.091 --> 00:46:25.170
could you help me with this fucking snake over here?
Um,
anyways,

707
00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:28.800
this is what the loser does.
Um,

708
00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:35.060
yeah.
I was gonna.
I was,
I was going to do x,
Y and z button stand.

709
00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:36.990
I did fucking d and F

710
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:42.660
fucking idiot.
Instead of knowing that God damn podcast,

711
00:46:42.661 --> 00:46:45.420
I went out and I drank last night.
Oh Gee,

712
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:49.620
I wish I had two whiskeys and to Miller high life.

713
00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:52.920
Why did I have Miller high life?
You know what?
Cause the bottle look good.

714
00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:54.270
I like the way the bottle look.

715
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:58.650
It's one of those nights there's a shiny looking bottle.
I like that.

716
00:46:58.651 --> 00:46:59.191
I'm going to have that.

717
00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:02.280
I'm going to block out those fucking awful Miller highlife commercials.

718
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:03.600
I hated those commercials.

719
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:08.160
That fucking plumber with his greasy fingers picking up that deviled egg.

720
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:11.550
It's like,
are you trying to stay at Budweiser?
Right.
These fucking heads.

721
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:15.210
All right.
This is just anger,

722
00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.380
just of frustration at myself.

723
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:24.960
I don't know why I did the things I did last night.
I shot pool,

724
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:29.940
you know,
like I'm fucking Willie Mosconi.
You know that's it.
Yeah.

725
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:30.920
We as a man,

726
00:47:30.921 --> 00:47:34.220
you just walk up to a pool table even though you know you suck and you just

727
00:47:34.221 --> 00:47:35.240
thinking it'd be like,
you know,

728
00:47:35.241 --> 00:47:39.440
seven ball corner pocket and it's going to fucking go right in and never goes
in.

729
00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:43.340
You know,
just like your life.
You think it's on target.

730
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:46.460
It think it's heading right towards your way,
where you want it to go.

731
00:47:46.461 --> 00:47:49.520
And Bam bounces off the fucking wall and next thing you know,

732
00:47:49.521 --> 00:47:53.390
it's all the way on the other side of the fucking table.
This is ridiculous.

733
00:47:53.391 --> 00:47:57.140
I shouldn't be doing this right now.
I resent.
I'm resenting.
I'm blaming you guys.

734
00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.500
I'm fucking blaming you.
Sitting in your God damn cubicles.

735
00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:02.300
What do you think about that?
What did he do?

736
00:48:02.301 --> 00:48:05.360
He can't fucking do anything about it.
What do you do?

737
00:48:05.361 --> 00:48:08.180
You're going to send me fucking emails complaining.

738
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:14.160
Yeah.
Well I don't give a shit.
I don't fucking,
I mean,
had breakfast,

739
00:48:14.161 --> 00:48:18.210
Jeff sitting in my pajamas doing that thing.
When you're hung over,
you know,

740
00:48:18.211 --> 00:48:19.800
we just sort of rub your feet together,

741
00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:23.490
trying to give yourself some sort of soothing feelings on the other.

742
00:48:23.491 --> 00:48:27.300
Render your body because your fucking head is throbbing so much.
Well,

743
00:48:27.301 --> 00:48:32.301
maybe I can offset the headache with a soothing feeling between my footies and

744
00:48:32.671 --> 00:48:33.810
of course it's not working.

745
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:39.490
Oh Fuck Jesus Christ.
Two whiskeys and two bears.

746
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:44.530
I feel like I fucking,
uh,
I dunno.
Like,
I dunno what,

747
00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.810
like I had a fight in the parking lot and I lost.

748
00:48:46.811 --> 00:48:50.710
And last thing I remember with somebody grabbing my big ears and bouncing my

749
00:48:50.711 --> 00:48:54.790
head off the asphalt as I'm growing,
I a writer,
right?
You won,
you won,

750
00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:58.180
and then you just slip off into a dream.

751
00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.273
<v 12>Ooh.</v>

752
00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:05.150
<v 3>Um,
you know,
it's weird.
I woke up whenever I wake up,
hung over.
Um,</v>

753
00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:07.230
you know,

754
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:11.070
one of the first things I do is I just start cursing out the woman in my life.

755
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.490
You know,
this is my remedy.
Forgetting over a hangover.

756
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:19.160
You know,
you wake up and you see him,
you know,

757
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:21.500
and you're trying to get the fucking,
you know,
yeah,

758
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:25.760
that goddamn cement out of your eyes.
He's,
you're trying to open them up.

759
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.950
And of course,
because you're hung over and you want to be alone,

760
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:35.580
the vibe you're putting out is you want to be alone.
What happens?

761
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:40.020
You create,
you attract what you fucking fear.

762
00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:45.320
Not only another human being right in your goddamn face,

763
00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:49.100
it's gotta be a female.
Okay?
And God knows,

764
00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:51.320
can they ever stop running their yaps.

765
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:55.070
It's like even when they don't have something to say,

766
00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:59.390
they're going to fucking talk because as much as they talk a good game,

767
00:49:59.391 --> 00:50:03.830
I'm an independent woman and I got my money,
motherfucker,
all that shit.

768
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:07.880
At the end of the day,

769
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:13.580
all these broads are afraid of the same thing.
They're afraid of silence.

770
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.863
That's what it is.

771
00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:19.460
You know that when you watch one of those goddamn shows or in my life,

772
00:50:19.461 --> 00:50:24.461
you walk by and your girls watch and one of those goddamn shows Wa and why am I

773
00:50:24.681 --> 00:50:28.760
bringing my voice down?
Like she's still in the apartment?
She,
but you know what?

774
00:50:28.761 --> 00:50:30.590
He just want to bring my voice down here.
This is,

775
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:34.190
I'm either talking about the Illuminati or I'm talking about these fucking

776
00:50:34.191 --> 00:50:38.330
bitches.
Um,
this is all hangover talk here.
So,

777
00:50:38.331 --> 00:50:41.510
oh fuck all you guys,
if you're taking this seriously.
All right.

778
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:46.040
Rule number one,
or is it number two at this point?

779
00:50:46.041 --> 00:50:50.810
You don't fucking take the podcast seriously.
Okay.
All you girls out there,

780
00:50:50.811 --> 00:50:55.460
you get your panties in a bunch.
[inaudible] why does he make fun of man?

781
00:50:55.730 --> 00:51:00.590
Well,
it is,
it balance it out because that's life sweetheart.
And Life isn't fair.

782
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:05.330
Why don't you go listen to one of those fucking 20 Twat podcast with the fucking

783
00:51:05.331 --> 00:51:09.950
broad over there running hurt God damn.
Yet between her cleavage.
Huh?

784
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:15.430
Why don't you go do that sister Pam would get tampons in your purse just in

785
00:51:17.761 --> 00:51:21.170
case.
Whew.
I am in a mood.

786
00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:27.020
Um,
yeah,
so I'm sitting there and I got,
they're afraid of silence.
Stay on target.

787
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:30.063
They are,

788
00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:34.820
they're afraid of silence and that's why they talk about nothing.
Oh,

789
00:51:34.821 --> 00:51:35.720
that's what I was trying to say.

790
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:40.380
You walk by the TB and your girlfriend's sitting there,
right?
She do.
You know,

791
00:51:40.381 --> 00:51:44.150
sitting there on the couch right in the couch.
Sidesaddle he now they sit,

792
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:49.070
leaned up against the arm with their legs to the side rubbing if footies

793
00:51:49.071 --> 00:51:53.330
together that a peaking out of the Afghan.
What?

794
00:51:53.331 --> 00:51:56.300
I liked this show.
You Watch your shows.

795
00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.900
Do I say anything when you're watching your shows?
I joke.

796
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.330
So why didn't you extent shot up?

797
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.190
So you know,
you walked by the fucking TV,

798
00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:15.410
you walked by the Goddamn TV and what and what is it?
What is on the TV?

799
00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.120
You know what?
I don't even remember.

800
00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:19.640
I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Oh yeah,

801
00:52:19.641 --> 00:52:24.140
they're just running their yaps.
Oh,
I got it.
Hey,
we go.
I'm hooked.

802
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:27.540
Backed up to it.
Then we go,
there was a little awkward.
This,
they're like,

803
00:52:27.541 --> 00:52:32.000
you ever see when a,
when a jet tries to refuel in mid flight,
you know,

804
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:34.460
and that Shark Dick is hanging down.

805
00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:39.200
I know what a shark Dick looks like.
What do think about that?

806
00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:44.330
Is that scandalous enough to get on TMZ and my low level of notoriety?

807
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:45.080
I do.

808
00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:50.080
I was watching this fucking a nature show and these fucking creepy humans cause

809
00:52:50.781 --> 00:52:55.781
that's what we are pull is great white shark out of the fucking sea.

810
00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:01.550
And the sharks laying there like,
I can't fucking breathe over here.
Right?

811
00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:04.670
And they got this little garden hose going into his mouth and it seemed the

812
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:05.750
sharks looking like,

813
00:53:05.751 --> 00:53:10.751
really this is the same as in he isn't fucking hailing a mouthful of ocean.

814
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:16.250
You little fucking true value hardware garden hose that you got my fucking

815
00:53:16.251 --> 00:53:20.690
mouth.
What are they doing?
Get away from my Dick please.

816
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.080
And they literally reached down and between a couple of faults,

817
00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.260
they pull out this shark cock,

818
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:31.490
which amazingly enough looks just like the fucking,
uh,

819
00:53:31.491 --> 00:53:35.180
that,
that tube that they refuel in the air for with,

820
00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:38.990
or whatever the fucking preposition is that a preposition.
I don't fucking know.

821
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:44.220
Trying to complete a sentence over here and that's what it looks like.
All right,

822
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:44.581
there you go.

823
00:53:44.581 --> 00:53:49.440
That portion was dedicated to all our troops over there in Afghanistan and then,

824
00:53:49.441 --> 00:53:53.820
uh,
Tuscaloosa,
um,
you know,
it's a weird thing.
I was sitting in the airport.

825
00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:56.840
I'm going to get back to the broads.
I'm going to give them a break right now.

826
00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:01.310
Okay.
I tried,
I tried to knock them out in that round and now I'm fucking winded.

827
00:54:01.311 --> 00:54:04.540
I'm taking a round off his debts,
starting to score points.
I'm just giving them,

828
00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:07.010
I'm just giving them hope.
Taking a round off,

829
00:54:07.011 --> 00:54:08.270
but I'm coming out with the next one.

830
00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:12.110
I'm putting a glove in their face like Larry Holmes and I'm coming with the

831
00:54:12.111 --> 00:54:15.860
overhand right.
My favorite fucking thing in boxing.
Um,

832
00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:20.540
God,
what was I just talking about?
I was talking about Shark Dicks.

833
00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:24.040
I'm gonna have to shark dicks.
Oh,
I know.
I'm in the airport.
All right.
Can,

834
00:54:24.041 --> 00:54:25.540
this is just going to be all momentum.

835
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:30.340
I'm going to just try to not stop talking for 50 minutes because when I stopped

836
00:54:30.341 --> 00:54:35.230
talking,
the throbbing in my head is actually audible.
All right.

837
00:54:35.231 --> 00:54:37.180
Slow it down,
Bill.
Let's take it down a little bit.

838
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:40.720
A little fucking some fucking smooth jazz here.
All right,

839
00:54:40.721 --> 00:54:43.890
so I'm sitting in the fucking airport.
This was an awkward thing,
right?
Uh,

840
00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:48.340
at least troops came walking by and these people spontaneously started to

841
00:54:48.341 --> 00:54:53.120
applaud,
you know,
and I didn't know what to do.

842
00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.610
Do I join in?
It just didn't seem right.

843
00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:00.410
But then you don't want to not fucking show your appreciation,

844
00:55:00.411 --> 00:55:03.040
but applause just seems weird.

845
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:07.630
It just seemed weird and I was trying to put myself in their fucking position.

846
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:13.320
Like,
you know,
you just came out of Fallujah,
did what you had to do over there,

847
00:55:13.321 --> 00:55:15.900
and then you get fucking however it works.
Next thing you know,

848
00:55:15.901 --> 00:55:20.040
you're on jet blue and you land at an airport and there's a soccer mom.
Woo.

849
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:24.150
Good game.
Good game.
You know,

850
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:27.010
I don't know what to do.
Definitely appreciate them.

851
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:29.070
But so that's for the troops out there.

852
00:55:29.071 --> 00:55:33.630
Do you want applause in the airport or is it fucking weird?
You know,

853
00:55:33.631 --> 00:55:36.510
cause we don't want to do that shit that happened to the troops when they came

854
00:55:36.511 --> 00:55:40.470
back from Vietnam and all those fucking hippies were like,
hey man,

855
00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:42.900
that wasn't cool when you burn down,

856
00:55:42.901 --> 00:55:45.930
that Dude's hut me and we don't want to do that,

857
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:50.760
but I don't want to have an overcorrection,
you know,

858
00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:56.610
what do you like Dan [inaudible] bed is that fucking song.
They play it up.

859
00:55:56.611 --> 00:55:59.700
I'm trying to think of like college football songs,
you know,

860
00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:05.500
here come the troops,
but I'm an APP bomp bomp Bam.
And on and on.

861
00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:10.120
And in order to want to go,
he had a Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

862
00:56:10.121 --> 00:56:14.950
You don't want to go like two high energy.
There's gotta be a happy medium

863
00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:20.260
between sitting there being like,
oh,
the leaves are brown.

864
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:22.660
And then sitting there,
you know,

865
00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:28.700
applauding like somebody just sank a putt.
It just didn't seem right.

866
00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:32.240
All right.
So anyway,
so you walked by the TV and there's the,

867
00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:36.830
in the broad's always.
They're always talking about how much more,

868
00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:40.800
uh,
I guess,
how much,
what better communicators,
females are,

869
00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:44.490
which I've probably proven of the last fucking 14 minutes of this podcast.

870
00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:49.200
Um,
and now he did.
Oh,

871
00:56:49.201 --> 00:56:54.120
if a woman actually says 20,000 more words a day,
then a guy does.

872
00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.910
Do you realize that yet?
Do you think?
I didn't notice.

873
00:56:56.911 --> 00:57:00.600
I thought it was 40,000 more.
Okay.
And let me tell you something.

874
00:57:00.601 --> 00:57:03.690
They're fucking a sinkhole.
We

875
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.880
just,
because you're saying more words doesn't mean you're saying anything.

876
00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:09.853
All right.

877
00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:14.880
You basically filler your way through silence with your girlfriend because both

878
00:57:14.881 --> 00:57:19.710
of you are sitting there.
Yeah.
Afraid that if you stop talking,

879
00:57:19.711 --> 00:57:23.190
you're going to hear the sound of your boob sagging.
All right.

880
00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:28.310
Oh yeah.
Well,
that's what I think it is in my own fucking ignorance.
All right,

881
00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:31.250
let's get on with the podcast here.
People,
I'm sorry.
I had to,

882
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:34.730
I had to do a little cardio there just to get myself through the first 15

883
00:57:34.731 --> 00:57:39.130
minutes,
you know,
now I can fucking chill.
So I woke up,

884
00:57:39.131 --> 00:57:40.930
hung over today,
obviously,

885
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:45.540
and I'm attack and the broads because I'm hung over and not for the most part,

886
00:57:45.541 --> 00:57:49.240
I don't like him.
Um,
I like to look at them.

887
00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:54.670
I liked to come over and stick my dick in him,
you know,
but after that,

888
00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:55.121
it's like,

889
00:57:55.121 --> 00:57:59.150
why don't you get out in the kitchen and make me one of them fucking blog ms

890
00:57:59.151 --> 00:58:03.880
sandwiches when she just fucking love to be that guy,

891
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:09.940
you know?
Just find some little fucking mouse of a woman to live with.

892
00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:16.620
Just blame your entire afternoon on her.
Where the fuck is a fucking room up?

893
00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:23.170
Oh,
you had it last.
What the fuck did you say?
I guess it was my fault.

894
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:30.350
This is terrible.
This isn't even comedy anymore.
This is just me.

895
00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:34.780
So I woke up this morning,
hung over as I've mentioned 98 times.

896
00:58:34.781 --> 00:58:39.100
And for some reason I woke up and uh,

897
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:42.250
this song was in my head.
I just woke up.

898
00:58:42.251 --> 00:58:44.050
But this was the song that was in my head right here,

899
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:53.410
hung over off my ass.
And all of a sudden,
I just hear Elvis,

900
00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:02.410
Joel,
shake me your be hitch.
Ooh,

901
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:07.640
that's one of the great fucking songs by Elvis Presley and a,

902
00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:11.530
when you really listen to the lyrics,
um,
it's,

903
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.680
he's a fucking psycho.
He stock in this broad,

904
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:18.400
how they in the kitchen,
Holly in the whole,

905
00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:23.070
let me go on to do your head a good at
because,
well,

906
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:28.090
and saw the kitchen kitchen in the kisses starts a team of wild horses couldn't

907
00:59:28.831 --> 00:59:33.040
pull us apart.
He's singing about rape everybody,

908
00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.810
but he gets that.
Oh,
and it's,
and it just smooths it all out.

909
00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:43.180
And that's why he was the king.
Only the king can make rape seem,

910
00:59:43.181 --> 00:59:46.810
uh,
like it's,
it's the right thing to do for both parties.

911
00:59:47.590 --> 00:59:52.390
Let's just be clear on that for both parties.
All right,

912
00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:54.270
let's get on with the podcast.
Okay.
I,

913
00:59:56.410 --> 00:59:59.440
I fucking love that song and I really do.

914
00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:04.090
And I was working the Orleans and,
and a casino with Tom Papa in the marriage.

915
01:00:04.091 --> 01:00:06.390
Refs,
Tom Papa.
Um,

916
01:00:06.391 --> 01:00:09.100
I was coming out on stage like that and I felt love for half a second.

917
01:00:09.101 --> 01:00:13.030
I felt like 1 million bucks.
If I have a fucking second.

918
01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:17.370
Can you believe it's August?
Um,
all right.

919
01:00:17.371 --> 01:00:20.070
So let's get on with the podcast.
Last week,
ladies and Gentlemen,

920
01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:25.000
I had the pleasure of performing on the David Letterman show.
And,

921
01:00:25.001 --> 01:00:26.100
uh,
most of you went out,

922
01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:31.130
you watched it and you all sent me wonderful emails about it and I would read

923
01:00:32.091 --> 01:00:34.820
you the wonderful emails,
but they're not funny,

924
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.410
but you are in luck.
You know what ones are funny?

925
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:42.860
The ones where people did not like my performance.

926
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:45.500
So let's read a couple of those.
Shall We?

927
01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:50.450
All right now my fucking nose is running.
Okay,
here we go.
Here we go.

928
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:53.840
I did a little coke last night.
Everybody.
No,
never had the balls.

929
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:58.160
Never had the balls to mess with that shit.
Okay?

930
01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:03.650
Uh,
this is a,
this is somebody and I was always,
um,
uh,

931
01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:07.050
for those of you whenever I read my hate mail,
um,
both of these,

932
01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:11.460
the two hate mail emails that I would be reading,
uh,
this morning,

933
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.240
all of a sudden I sound like right now like a teacher teaching a really boring

934
01:01:15.241 --> 01:01:19.860
class.
You know that you're in,
you know,
first class of that semester,

935
01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:24.440
right?
You finally got yourself a little bit of Poon Tang.

936
01:01:24.441 --> 01:01:27.770
You're happy.
You floating around,
everything's going to be great.
You're thinking,

937
01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:32.160
okay,
let's see all my teachers are going to be,
and then that do.

938
01:01:32.161 --> 01:01:34.940
She comes out.
Welcome

939
01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:40.220
to meteorology in the media.

940
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.840
My name is mister cunt face and Mr [inaudible] face when I'm in third grade,

941
01:01:48.141 --> 01:01:51.740
I'm sorry,
I'm hung over.
I couldn't come up with my name is Mr Magilla Kati.

942
01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:55.190
Over the course of the next three months,

943
01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.850
we're going to be delving into the water for all the meteorology in the media.

944
01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:04.240
You will be required to write to 27 page papers

945
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.470
on cirrus clouds.
It lived the codas.

946
01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:17.150
Okay,
so cirrus clouds were first discovered.

947
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.260
Yeah,
the 1600 risk by bad weather.

948
01:02:22.261 --> 01:02:24.370
They laugh and they picks up the fucking marker.

949
01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:27.720
He's writing across that fucking bored.

950
01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:30.050
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

951
01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:34.210
<v 3>so your Makkah is Lars yet the third</v>

952
01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:39.730
at first,
before I said mark is a Catholic at the or,

953
01:02:39.731 --> 01:02:41.350
they thought the cirrus clouds.

954
01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:47.930
We're actually the God's sake that your wife was account.

955
01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:53.440
I get nothing.
What's the breathing annoying it was supposed to be.

956
01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:55.330
Um,
all right,
let's read the hate mail here.

957
01:02:55.331 --> 01:02:59.980
So what happens with all of all of my hate mail is when people don't like my act

958
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:04.560
is he can't just write me evidently and just say that you don't like my act.

959
01:03:04.561 --> 01:03:06.900
You don't appreciate what it is that I do on the stage.

960
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:11.400
What you have to do first is you have to establish what an incredible sense of

961
01:03:11.401 --> 01:03:16.401
fucking humor you have and how open you are to all different forms of humor.

962
01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:21.430
You know,
it's that classic thing like those douchebags on Youtube.

963
01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:26.580
Obama's a fucking idiot and I'm a Democrat,
right?

964
01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.430
So then we can be like,
wow,

965
01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:33.540
this guy is left and even he doesn't like this lefty guy.

966
01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:37.050
So this is what they do.
All right,
so here.

967
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:42.200
So these both these emails follow to a Goddamn fucking t did the motherfucking u

968
01:03:44.641 --> 01:03:47.960
and V,
um,
they follow it here.

969
01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:52.120
They follow that pattern bill.
Just read the fucking thing.
Okay,
here we go.

970
01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:56.650
All right.
Hi there.
How this one starts starts off.

971
01:03:56.651 --> 01:04:00.310
Nice enough.
Hi there.
I've been a fan for a while.

972
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:04.590
You seem to have a unique take on things.
Look at this,
Huh?

973
01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:10.290
Pat me on the head but me sniffer hand making me nice and fucking relax.

974
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:15.770
I loved your bit about the muffins and the mass vehicular murder.

975
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:17.223
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

976
01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:21.880
<v 3>so there you go.
She just showed how we,
it just,</v>

977
01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:24.430
her sense of humor spans the globe

978
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:29.310
whether I'm attacking food are actually running over human beings on the

979
01:04:29.311 --> 01:04:33.520
sidewalk.
She finds it all funny though.

980
01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:36.880
And here's the rub though.
As a stay at home mom,

981
01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:39.340
I now completely despise you.

982
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:44.650
I did this bit about being a stay at home mom.
Um,
so anyways,

983
01:04:44.651 --> 01:04:49.651
she says the hardest part about being a stay at home mom is being respect is

984
01:04:49.801 --> 01:04:54.300
being disrespected by everyone.
I now hope the worst for you,

985
01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:58.800
despite what funny acts you may think up in the future.

986
01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:03.000
You are a jerk and deserve the worst that life has to offer.

987
01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:09.323
<v 4>Okay.</v>

988
01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:10.880
<v 3>I don't fuck it.
I don't,</v>

989
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:16.820
I don't understand like this is the classic fucking person where everything is

990
01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:19.930
until it comes around to some shit in her life.

991
01:05:19.931 --> 01:05:24.400
And I make some fun is some shit that she's doing,
being a stay at home mom.

992
01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:29.580
And now all of a sudden she goes from being a fan of mine to now I am a jerk and

993
01:05:29.621 --> 01:05:34.170
deserve the worst that life has to offer.
That's,

994
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:38.410
that's a fucking hard courts that you deserve.
The worst that life has to offer.

995
01:05:38.411 --> 01:05:41.050
So what?
I'm going to get leprosy and uh,

996
01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:46.110
be constipated all at the same time and fucking survive a plane crash,

997
01:05:46.721 --> 01:05:51.130
but not in a good way,
you know?
Anyways,
I don't fucking know.

998
01:05:51.131 --> 01:05:54.730
Rarely you're going to take it to that level.
So I wrote her back and I said,

999
01:05:54.731 --> 01:05:55.870
a sweetheart,

1000
01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:59.830
Oprah Winfrey called your job the toughest job on the planet,

1001
01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:03.970
on national television and got an applause break of approval.

1002
01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:08.950
How much more respect do you need?
I think that's a great point.

1003
01:06:08.951 --> 01:06:13.150
If I can step outside the email,
break the fucking fourth wall.

1004
01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:16.950
Is that what it is?
The third wall?
I never knew what the fuck it was.
Huh?

1005
01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:22.990
Oprah Winfrey's on TV saying you have the toughest job on the planet and

1006
01:06:22.991 --> 01:06:25.420
everybody claps.
All right.

1007
01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:29.320
Did she say being a standup comedian is the toughest job on the planet.

1008
01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:32.320
You think you know what it's like to be fucking disrespected.

1009
01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:36.550
You Apron wearing sheltered son of a bitch.
Huh?

1010
01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:40.600
You want to talk about being disrespected?
Look at fucking comedians.

1011
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:45.160
Anytime they show a comedian in a movie.
Is it a Chris Rock level comic?

1012
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.180
It never is.

1013
01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:51.420
It's the fucking hack with the lampshade on his head going Wakawaka right.

1014
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.070
Didn't the fucking comedian get shot in his gut during Scarface?

1015
01:06:58.510 --> 01:07:00.400
Ah,
did a fucking stay at home.

1016
01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:04.900
Mom gets shot in the fucking stomach with that Mr. Potato head mask on her face

1017
01:07:04.901 --> 01:07:06.220
during that show.
No.
You know why?

1018
01:07:06.221 --> 01:07:08.350
Cause she was at home taking care of the fucking kids

1019
01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.910
at Jesus Christ.
I'm just gonna read the rest of this email.

1020
01:07:12.911 --> 01:07:14.140
That didn't even fucking make sense.

1021
01:07:14.141 --> 01:07:19.141
It started off funny and then it just went right off the rails like a Prius that

1022
01:07:19.151 --> 01:07:23.820
you can't fucking stop.
Um,
anyways,
uh,
she says,
so I wrote,

1023
01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:27.070
I wrote how much more respect do you need?
And then I said,
meanwhile,

1024
01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:29.500
there are children working in sweat shops.

1025
01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.610
Would you rather be a stay at home mom or an eight year old sewing Adidas

1026
01:07:33.611 --> 01:07:35.470
together for 16 hours a day.

1027
01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:41.590
I came up with another great example that I,
I wish I had used on TV.

1028
01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:43.810
How about how about you work on one of those fucking oil rigs?

1029
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:45.820
Like those poor bastards who worked for BP?

1030
01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.140
Then all of a sudden out of nowhere the fucking thing explodes.

1031
01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:55.360
You standing on a metal structure in the middle of the goddamn ocean and next

1032
01:07:55.361 --> 01:07:59.050
thing you know blows up,
probably blew out both your eardrums.

1033
01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:03.550
He had deaf now and you're on fire.
All right?

1034
01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:08.700
And your only option is either burning to death or jumping off of basically the

1035
01:08:09.221 --> 01:08:11.260
equivalent of the top of a brownstone

1036
01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:16.940
trying to enter the water without doing the world's biggest flaming belly flop,

1037
01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:21.650
right?
You land in the water,

1038
01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:26.060
second and third degree burns in salt water,
alright,

1039
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:30.890
pus and blood is oozing into the water and now all you can do is pray to God

1040
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:35.600
that the coast guard gets there before is see as sharks eat you alive.

1041
01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:37.821
All right?

1042
01:08:37.821 --> 01:08:41.240
You want to do that or you want to watch Bob the builder for the 800 time

1043
01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:45.920
lighten up.
And then I wrote,
Oh,

1044
01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:48.110
and don't despise or hope the worst for me.

1045
01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.960
That causes premature aging hugs.

1046
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:55.190
I know that was kind of mean to say,
but you know what?
Go Fuck Yourself.

1047
01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:57.980
All right,
here's another one.
Once again,

1048
01:08:58.070 --> 01:09:01.010
we have to establish credibility at the top of the email.

1049
01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:05.060
Are you guys ready for the credibility to be established?
Jesus Christ,

1050
01:09:05.061 --> 01:09:08.600
I know I am.
Here we go.
Ah,
Bill,

1051
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:13.870
I am never appalled or capital letters offended by comedy that I see in here.

1052
01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:20.090
All capitals,
his sentence.
I have a great sense of humor.

1053
01:09:21.230 --> 01:09:25.100
Wow.
This is unbelievable.
Isn't that amazing?
Podcast listeners,

1054
01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:30.250
this person is never appalled or offended by comedy that she sees or hears.

1055
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:34.820
She has a great sense of humor.
She has such a great sense of humor.

1056
01:09:34.821 --> 01:09:39.110
People that she had to yell at at me and emails.

1057
01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.790
All right,
so this no way she had a problem with my act,
right?

1058
01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:48.550
Let's read the rest of the email,
however,
oh gee,

1059
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:53.060
your appearance on the David Letterman show that I just watched,

1060
01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.600
just put down women and motherhood to an extent that is just downright

1061
01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:04.010
unbelievable.
Dot Dot,
dot.
Now she's going to yell again and tasteless.

1062
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:08.450
Now she yells for the rest of this email,
but I'm going to spare you guys.

1063
01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.600
All right.
I'm going to read it and soothing tones,

1064
01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.640
but she's screaming the entire time.

1065
01:10:13.641 --> 01:10:16.960
That's what I'm guessing because it's all capital letters.
Um,

1066
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:19.220
this is what she says.

1067
01:10:19.221 --> 01:10:24.221
I challenge you to be a single parent and raise a child and work and attend

1068
01:10:25.701 --> 01:10:30.701
college alone without any help just in case you don't know what being a single

1069
01:10:32.121 --> 01:10:35.370
parent mates.
All right?
Um,

1070
01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.970
you have no idea how hard it really is.

1071
01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:43.660
I am disgusted with your act and will not ever buy any of your DVDs,

1072
01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:45.410
et Cetera.

1073
01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.610
For the first time in my life,
I am disgusted with comedy.

1074
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.170
Your comedy,
that is like a,
she starts speaking like in film nor,

1075
01:10:57.470 --> 01:11:01.760
and I'm disgusted with his comedy.
Y'All comedy that is,
see,
Eh,

1076
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:04.360
23.
Skidoo.
All right.

1077
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:09.370
Your Act touched on many topics that you were disgraceful and very unappealing.

1078
01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:14.340
And then she got so mad she stopped writing sentences.
Um,
first of all,

1079
01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:18.850
sweetheart,
I wasn't making fun of a single,
uh,
single,
uh,

1080
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.400
parents that was making fun of single parents.
Nobody would laugh.

1081
01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:25.890
I was talking about stay at home moms.
All right?

1082
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:30.940
You don't remember that line hanging out all day making grilled cheese

1083
01:11:30.941 --> 01:11:32.980
sandwiches.
You given a puppet show,

1084
01:11:32.981 --> 01:11:36.820
you dress like a dragon and then some other adult comes home and gives you
money.

1085
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:41.020
You like a big kid.
That's some other dove coming home,

1086
01:11:41.021 --> 01:11:43.690
giving you money is your fucking husband.
You dumped broad.

1087
01:11:43.691 --> 01:11:46.960
Do I gotta fucking spell it out to you?
So I just wrote her back.

1088
01:11:46.961 --> 01:11:49.030
I just said I wasn't talking about single moms.

1089
01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:51.610
I was talking about stay at home moms.
You weren't listening.

1090
01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:55.280
<v 2>Yeah.
Okay.</v>

1091
01:11:55.690 --> 01:12:00.430
<v 3>Alyssa.
I'm not going to do the show anymore.
If I have to put up with this.</v>

1092
01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.180
I'm just kidding.
I love these fucking hate mail things and that's all I got.

1093
01:12:04.181 --> 01:12:06.190
I got,
I got to to uh,

1094
01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:11.370
bad emails and then I had one guy who wrote like a five page dissertation on uh,

1095
01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:19.410
on the shirt I was wearing under my suit or something like that.
And uh,

1096
01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.370
then I just went home a phobic with him.
I just wrote a,

1097
01:12:23.371 --> 01:12:27.480
that's one of the gay ass emails I've ever received.
Uh,

1098
01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.220
thanks for the fashion advice.

1099
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:35.530
And then he wrote back trying to act as if I got a bunch of emails from guys

1100
01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:39.850
telling me to wear a carnation in my front pocket or whatever the fuck he was

1101
01:12:39.851 --> 01:12:40.684
saying.

1102
01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.020
And he wrote this big long fucking four page email and then I just hit him with,

1103
01:12:44.021 --> 01:12:48.580
come on sweetie,
don't be like that.
And then it ended it.
I got,
I got a lot of,

1104
01:12:48.581 --> 01:12:51.670
a little weird emails this week.
Somebody saw date night and said,

1105
01:12:51.671 --> 01:12:54.970
I need to be more choosy.
When I picked my roles,

1106
01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.430
which I thought was fucking hilarious.

1107
01:12:57.490 --> 01:13:01.300
Like someone who has eight lines in a movie is actually getting offers around

1108
01:13:01.301 --> 01:13:05.620
town.
We got to get this guy.
The way of telling you,

1109
01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:10.390
the way he stands next to other people talking in the film is incredible.

1110
01:13:10.391 --> 01:13:14.780
He is the best at it.
You know,
I got to be more choosy with,

1111
01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.793
with a fucking,

1112
01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:17.503
<v 2>yeah.</v>

1113
01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:20.710
<v 3>Evidently because I wasn't doing stand up in the movie date night.</v>

1114
01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:24.700
Like the role of my character was the straight man and the more the straight or

1115
01:13:24.701 --> 01:13:29.410
I played it,
the more opportunity for the other person to be funny in the seed.

1116
01:13:30.130 --> 01:13:32.780
That's your fucking job,
you know?

1117
01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:37.190
And I did the job and if I think that wasn't the job that I was supposed to do,

1118
01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:39.650
I would think that the director might have said something.

1119
01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:44.480
And just because I'm a fucking comedian doesn't mean I'm going to walk around,

1120
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:47.360
you know,
with a lampshade on my fucking head.

1121
01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:48.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1122
01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.900
<v 3>I'd love to be in a bad ass fucking movie.
What do you think I want to do?</v>

1123
01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:56.030
You know,
you think I want to be in raising Arizona part to actually,
that would,

1124
01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:58.820
but uh,
I'd also like to be in a,

1125
01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.970
they can never make a movie as good as a good fellas.

1126
01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:04.580
I'd love to do some shit like that.
Play a fucking psycho.

1127
01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:09.410
Put the lotion in the bucket,
but wouldn't want to do that shit.
Alright.

1128
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:14.050
You dumped.
Fuck am I,
I don't need to be more choosy about my roles.

1129
01:14:14.051 --> 01:14:18.130
I need to take anything anybody gives me.
Yeah.

1130
01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:21.610
Fucking shot that movie a year ago.
I haven't done another one.

1131
01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.660
Is that choosing enough for you?
Not Been.
I've gone.

1132
01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:30.220
It's not like I'm not trying.
All right,
let's,
uh,
let's plow ahead here.

1133
01:14:30.221 --> 01:14:33.790
Let's get on with the,
what else do we got going on?
Oh,
by the way,

1134
01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.370
if I want to thank everybody.
Seriously,
I was just fucking around there with the,

1135
01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:40.990
uh,
the letter stuff.
I had an unbelievably great time and,
uh,

1136
01:14:40.991 --> 01:14:43.330
that was my best Letterman if I do say so myself.

1137
01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:49.060
I finally figured out the pacing that I have to go on TV.

1138
01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:49.990
And uh,

1139
01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:55.450
what I always used to try to do is I used to try to go comedy club speed,

1140
01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:59.590
but TV audiences for some reason laugh and clap a lot more.

1141
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.120
And then I would,

1142
01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:05.110
I would try to do was plow through the applause and get the tag of the joke in

1143
01:15:05.111 --> 01:15:09.040
there.
And uh,
I dunno,
it's like a whole different animal.

1144
01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:13.000
You got to figure out what do you do when they're applauding,

1145
01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:20.260
you know,
why did the chicken cross road to get the US side?

1146
01:15:20.261 --> 01:15:23.050
Woo Woo.

1147
01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.540
Maybe that's why I didn't applaud when the troops came by because I thought that

1148
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:32.740
they would feel as awkward as I do when you're just standing there going,
okay,

1149
01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:36.100
thank you.
Yes,
I know that was the greatest joke in the history of the world.

1150
01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:42.070
I am tremendous.
Where do you get alone of this one?
Um,
all right,

1151
01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:46.060
let's read some that's reached some,
uh,
oh,
and by the way,

1152
01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.920
later on that night,
um,
in celebration,

1153
01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:55.200
I had the most ridiculous fucking weekend,
um,

1154
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:59.620
that an adult can have.
And part of most of his,
because,
uh,

1155
01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:05.710
you know,
I chose what I wanted to do in life was exactly what I wanted to do.

1156
01:16:05.711 --> 01:16:08.350
And secondly,
I'm not married and I don't have any fucking kids,

1157
01:16:08.351 --> 01:16:13.030
so I don't have any responsibility.
Hence,
I,
uh,

1158
01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:16.360
I get to live the life of a,
a gay guy.

1159
01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:20.260
You mean notice how happy fucking gay men are?

1160
01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:24.430
You know why that is is because they got the fucking double whammy.

1161
01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:26.320
They're a fucking man.

1162
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:31.350
So they can earn way more an hour than the fucking broads over there and then

1163
01:16:31.361 --> 01:16:35.050
they don't have any God damn kids.
So once you get around 40,

1164
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:40.030
if you've done great and your,
your career,
you have all this disposable income,

1165
01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:41.740
you know,

1166
01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:46.740
and the only way to kill the voices in your head that you should add a fucking

1167
01:16:47.411 --> 01:16:52.411
kid by now is to go out and do frivolous bullshit to fill up the free time.

1168
01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:57.760
And that's what I've been doing.
So I actually,
this weekend,
um,

1169
01:16:58.630 --> 01:17:01.960
one of the things I got to do this past weekend is so fucking unbelievable.

1170
01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:06.040
I can't even tell you how I even went down,
but I did take video of it.

1171
01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:10.280
And if you want to watch the video,
you can only go one place everybody.

1172
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:14.120
And that's the M podcast.com.
Huh?
You like that?

1173
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:19.750
Look at that and exclusive Monday morning podcast video that will only be shown

1174
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:27.910
on the [inaudible] podcast.com of course until some douchebag takes it and puts

1175
01:17:28.161 --> 01:17:31.440
it up on Youtube.
So go to the MLM,

1176
01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:36.460
podcast.com and a watch a video of something that I got to do.

1177
01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:39.380
And uh,
I don't even,

1178
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:43.790
I can't even begin to tell you how that whole fucking thing went down and how I

1179
01:17:43.791 --> 01:17:48.680
got to do it,
but,
uh,
was one of the great things I got to do in life.

1180
01:17:48.681 --> 01:17:49.790
So I got to do that,

1181
01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:54.620
which I won't be telling you because I'm trying to become a smarter businessman

1182
01:17:54.621 --> 01:17:56.900
here.
All right.

1183
01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:59.870
The only way you should hit pause right now and go to the FM podcast right now,

1184
01:17:59.871 --> 01:18:03.710
if you're not following along anyways.
Um,

1185
01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:07.700
I got to do that unbelievable activity.
And then,
uh,

1186
01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:10.161
what did I do?

1187
01:18:10.161 --> 01:18:13.760
I did Letterman on Monday and then Monday night I went down to the bitter end

1188
01:18:13.761 --> 01:18:17.180
and I watched that fucking amazing guy,
Oz.

1189
01:18:17.181 --> 01:18:20.450
Noy this guitarist,
if you ever get a chance,

1190
01:18:20.451 --> 01:18:24.500
have you ever in a New York one Monday a night,
this guy,

1191
01:18:24.501 --> 01:18:28.190
Oz noy goes down and he,
I don't know,
I can't even describe what the fuck it is.

1192
01:18:28.191 --> 01:18:32.380
He does.
Very,
very unique guitarist and he,
uh,

1193
01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.830
I don't mean you got to see him live.
You have to fucking see him live.

1194
01:18:36.831 --> 01:18:38.840
His youtube videos do not do him justice.

1195
01:18:38.841 --> 01:18:40.960
You got to go down and see him live and um,

1196
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.540
and he's always playing with these top notch musicians.

1197
01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:47.060
He had a will leave from the Letterman band was there.

1198
01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:50.930
Steve Ferrone from the average white band actually went out and got a fucking

1199
01:18:50.931 --> 01:18:53.840
picture with them and Shit,
uh,

1200
01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:56.480
from the average white band and now Tom petty and he's played with a zillion

1201
01:18:56.481 --> 01:18:59.630
other people.
One of my drumming heroes got to meet him that fucking night.

1202
01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.520
And,
uh,
the guy on keyboards is one of the original guys from the e street band,

1203
01:19:04.521 --> 01:19:05.780
but I'm not into the e street band.

1204
01:19:05.781 --> 01:19:09.710
But this guy was the shit and I just watched these fucking unbelievable

1205
01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:11.900
musicians and sat in the crowd.

1206
01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:15.950
These guys was so fucking good that actually had the comforting thought that,

1207
01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:20.951
you know what robots will never take over fully.

1208
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:25.920
Robots will never fully fucking take over because they'll never be able to do

1209
01:19:25.921 --> 01:19:27.820
what I just fucking saw.
I mean when he,

1210
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:31.100
you're gonna write a program for passion,

1211
01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:36.770
God know some fucking egg head with no passion is probably figuring that shit

1212
01:19:36.771 --> 01:19:41.420
out.
Figuring out how to make a robot sweat.
Will it plays fucking guitar.

1213
01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:50.600
That'll be,
that'll be the big fucking breakthrough.

1214
01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.720
That's why drum machines never fully took over cause it's just somebody

1215
01:19:53.721 --> 01:19:58.190
programming the shit,
you know?
It's not a human being playing it.

1216
01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.520
Right.
Is that where,
I don't know.

1217
01:20:01.521 --> 01:20:05.840
I'm too fucking hung over and actually have a fucking a fucking touching moment

1218
01:20:05.841 --> 01:20:10.000
here in the podcast all a couple of weeks ago,
I told you guys how to dump,

1219
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:14.340
how to get out of a fucking relationship.
All right.
Um,

1220
01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:17.370
and if you ever want to learn how to not get into a relationship,

1221
01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:22.820
go download a Andrew dice Clay's live album at Dangerfield that the,

1222
01:20:24.411 --> 01:20:26.840
uh,
the day the laughter died.

1223
01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:30.820
And one of my favorite bits of all time that he does is a,

1224
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:35.080
I think it's called hot and how to not get into a relationship.

1225
01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:38.560
So if you don't even want to deal with how to get out of relationship,

1226
01:20:38.561 --> 01:20:41.730
listened to dice Clay's bit on how to not get into,

1227
01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:46.010
into a relationship and a,
but then if you fuck up and you get into one,

1228
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:48.060
listen to my podcast from a couple of weeks ago and I'll,

1229
01:20:48.061 --> 01:20:52.450
I'll give you the blueprint on how to get out.
All right?
So anyway,

1230
01:20:52.451 --> 01:20:54.430
so this brought up the whole getting dumped

1231
01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:59.260
and people have been sending me emails about getting dumped or breaking up and

1232
01:20:59.261 --> 01:21:01.930
the awkwardness and all that type of shit.
He's some great stories.

1233
01:21:01.931 --> 01:21:04.120
Here's one for you getting dump a bill.

1234
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:08.680
How's listening last week and wanted to tell you about the worst way I was

1235
01:21:08.681 --> 01:21:11.560
dumped.
Uh,
when I was in high school,

1236
01:21:11.561 --> 01:21:15.550
I had a friend who was a girl and I was in love with her in a pathetic,

1237
01:21:15.551 --> 01:21:19.270
never getting laid way while she was banging half the football team.

1238
01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:25.600
Oh Dude.
That's like that movie last,
uh,
last American virgin.

1239
01:21:25.690 --> 01:21:29.080
Right then I already used that reference on the podcast.
I don't give a fuck.

1240
01:21:29.081 --> 01:21:33.070
I'm hung over anyways.
I,
after high school,
graduate graduation,

1241
01:21:33.071 --> 01:21:37.660
we started dating even though we went to different colleges.
Seven hours apart,

1242
01:21:38.610 --> 01:21:40.180
um,
over.
Yeah.

1243
01:21:40.210 --> 01:21:43.690
I love how she starts dating you then because the football team left her and

1244
01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:48.190
went to 47 different colleges,
so she just needed a dick to ride.
Um,

1245
01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:51.820
over fall break I went to visit her and stayed at her place for the weekend.

1246
01:21:51.850 --> 01:21:53.260
On the last night at midnight,

1247
01:21:53.261 --> 01:21:58.261
she told me she was seeing someone else and then expected me to stay at her

1248
01:21:58.501 --> 01:22:02.580
house that night.
Oh,
what a cunt.
Um,

1249
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:08.060
I got up and pack my shit.
And as I was about to leave,

1250
01:22:08.061 --> 01:22:11.630
I did my best Brando impression to let her know how she,

1251
01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:15.230
how she fucked up.
Um,

1252
01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:19.490
and as I started to go out the door after making my dramatic statement,

1253
01:22:19.491 --> 01:22:22.430
she said,
don't you need your keys?

1254
01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.060
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1255
01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:27.890
<v 3>Oh,
this poor bastard.
He goes,</v>

1256
01:22:27.891 --> 01:22:31.280
I forgot my keys on the table all the way across the room.

1257
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:35.540
So I had to walk all the way across,
back the back,

1258
01:22:35.541 --> 01:22:40.541
across the room in shame to grab my keys and then drove seven hours back to

1259
01:22:41.211 --> 01:22:45.030
college in the middle of a,
in the middle of the night.
Dude,

1260
01:22:45.031 --> 01:22:49.460
let me tell you something.
You got,
you got half a victory there.

1261
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.940
Um,
because you did leave and you know,

1262
01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:56.840
and you did,

1263
01:22:56.841 --> 01:23:01.280
you had the ability to walk all the way across the room to get your keys.

1264
01:23:01.281 --> 01:23:06.281
And at no point during that long fucking did you break down in tears.

1265
01:23:07.770 --> 01:23:12.680
You didn't.
All right,
don't you need your keys?
Ah,

1266
01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:17.820
ah,
that's fucking brutal.
That's like,
that's like mean.

1267
01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:22.020
Yeah.
Because you know what she thought,

1268
01:23:22.021 --> 01:23:23.730
I guess that you were going to stay there for the night.

1269
01:23:23.731 --> 01:23:26.340
So I guess she went mean there.
Don't you need your keys?

1270
01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:28.760
Obviously you need your keys.

1271
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:33.870
If she was trying to let you down easy when she'd be like,
mmm,

1272
01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:38.830
be forgot your keys here and just would have the decency to look down at the

1273
01:23:38.831 --> 01:23:42.440
floor.
Don't you need your keys

1274
01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:50.250
now?
This is what I want to know from you.
And that's seven hours.
Drive back.

1275
01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:53.250
How many different snappy comebacks did you come with for?

1276
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:57.050
Don't you need your keys?
I bet you were so fucking distraught.

1277
01:23:57.051 --> 01:24:00.500
They didn't even make sense.
Don't you need your keys?
Don't you need,

1278
01:24:00.501 --> 01:24:03.680
you can't write.
That doesn't even make sense.
But you know,

1279
01:24:04.710 --> 01:24:09.490
it's something you'd say.
Aww,
you poor bastard.
Whatever.

1280
01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:13.990
You know what the good news is?
She probably has three kids right now.

1281
01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:17.530
Her body's looking like she's standing in a fun house mirror and she probably

1282
01:24:17.531 --> 01:24:21.910
has some sort of fucking STD.
So,
you know,
there you go sir.

1283
01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:27.700
It all worked out in the end,
didn't it?
All right.
Uh,
bad covers.

1284
01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:31.000
This is from back in the day we talking about,
um,
when,

1285
01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:34.750
when an artist comes around like a lady Gaga,

1286
01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:36.533
you know,

1287
01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:41.540
when she comes around and she wraps herself in toilet paper and holds a fucking

1288
01:24:42.001 --> 01:24:45.000
dildo and everybody's like,
she's thinking a fashion thing,

1289
01:24:45.001 --> 01:24:48.840
but she shocking Middle America,
uh,

1290
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:52.020
holding like a black baby while playing chess.

1291
01:24:56.690 --> 01:25:01.690
Is there anything worse than that?
Paint by numbers.
Shock,
you know,
and then,

1292
01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.680
then the fucking douchebags who cover it,
just stand right in line.

1293
01:25:06.650 --> 01:25:08.300
She's pushing boundaries.

1294
01:25:09.690 --> 01:25:13.500
She's rejecting what it is to be a woman.
Oh God,
shut up.

1295
01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:18.080
She's wearing a silly outfit.
Isn't that what she's doing

1296
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:23.970
as a fan?
Blowing on her twat hanging off her belt buckle.

1297
01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:27.960
And then I'm supposed to sit there and be like,
I can't even process this.

1298
01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:33.420
This is cutting edge art.
I mean,

1299
01:25:33.421 --> 01:25:34.440
what is she really doing?

1300
01:25:40.890 --> 01:25:42.340
<v 13>Oh,
good phase.</v>

1301
01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:45.290
<v 3>Oh my God,
I can't handle it.</v>

1302
01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:50.340
This is like what Jimmy Hendrix came out.
No,
it isn't.

1303
01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:55.110
There's like when Cindy Lopper came up,
she braided half her fucking head,

1304
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.290
right?
And dance down the street with their fucking shoulders going up and down,

1305
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:03.740
yelling at Captain Lou Albano.
It's,
it's kind of on level.

1306
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:08.270
I remember when Cindy Lopper did that shit and then she didn't do anything.

1307
01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.220
And next thing you know,
she's on,
she's on that fucking,
uh,

1308
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:16.940
who wants to be a CEO getting fired by that guy who I don't even think has any

1309
01:26:16.941 --> 01:26:21.740
money or any Donald Trump fans out there.
I don't think that guy is rich.

1310
01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:24.620
I really don't.
I don't,
I don't buy it.
If this guy is such,

1311
01:26:24.650 --> 01:26:28.190
if he's so fucking rich and has all these goddamn businesses,

1312
01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:32.360
how does he have time to do a reality show and in critique,

1313
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:35.270
who's better at running a lemonade stand?

1314
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:39.680
Cindy Lopper or Bret Michaels is,
is that what it,

1315
01:26:39.681 --> 01:26:42.380
what a fucking a

1316
01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:47.030
fucking whatever the hell he is.
What do you,
what do you call a guy like that?

1317
01:26:47.031 --> 01:26:51.050
He's,
he's,
he's a,
uh,
a conglomerate,
a media conglomerate.

1318
01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:55.220
What the fuck is he called?
A A,
I can't think of the word.

1319
01:26:55.221 --> 01:26:58.430
I'm too fucking hung over.
It's not like one of those ingenue names.

1320
01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.680
And I know it's not that way.
I know what that,
that's not what it is.

1321
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:05.510
Ingenue means you're a,
you're a good looking core core good looking whore.

1322
01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:10.430
Who some day
my brain is so fucked right now.

1323
01:27:10.431 --> 01:27:13.130
I just combined good looking in horror and she's a good,

1324
01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:18.190
she's a Gore Al Gore Al Gore,

1325
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:22.370
who is a bitchier fucking body.
Al Gore or fucking Bill Clinton.

1326
01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:23.713
Both of them,

1327
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:28.670
the big mother and hips sachet and around the White House with their fucking

1328
01:27:28.671 --> 01:27:32.840
suits on Eaton Stouffer fucking pies.

1329
01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:38.090
Um,
I am so off to track right now.
Um,
we're talking about bad covers.

1330
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:40.910
No,
I'm,
this is,
this is,

1331
01:27:40.911 --> 01:27:45.200
this is what I really believe about Donald Trump for all his fucking Trump
water.

1332
01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:49.190
Trump tower,
Trump casino,
Trump helicopter.

1333
01:27:49.191 --> 01:27:53.180
Trump toenail clippers.
I don't think that that guy,

1334
01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:59.270
if you gave him fucking,
if you gave him 12 hours,

1335
01:27:59.271 --> 01:28:02.540
I don't think that he could come up with more than 6,500 bucks in cash.

1336
01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:07.310
I think he's just completely leveraged out.
But his projects are so big.

1337
01:28:07.311 --> 01:28:10.640
He's like the banks like he,
he's too big to fail.

1338
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:15.350
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck am I talking about?
Where the hell am I?

1339
01:28:15.351 --> 01:28:20.000
Let's get back to bed covers.
All right.
Bad covers.

1340
01:28:20.001 --> 01:28:21.460
Here's one for you.
Uh,

1341
01:28:21.490 --> 01:28:25.520
Madonna when she did a American pie,

1342
01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:31.340
um,
yeah,
that song kind of sucked to begin with.

1343
01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:34.580
And then,
um,
just in case you didn't realize it sucked,

1344
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:39.260
Madonna came in and proved it.
Yes.
This song did suck.

1345
01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:44.300
Now even if you completely switch it up and put that club beat underneath it,

1346
01:28:44.391 --> 01:28:48.770
it's still gonna fucking suck of Jesus.
I'm just running on a momentum,

1347
01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:53.990
you know?
Did I really just do a lady Gaga impression?
I'll fuck you.

1348
01:28:53.991 --> 01:28:57.440
You enjoyed it.
You enjoyed it.
You know,

1349
01:28:57.441 --> 01:29:02.070
you do a podcast hung over.
I want to see how good you do.
Yeah,
I didn't think so.

1350
01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:06.810
I didn't fucking think so.
Um,
here's your youtube videos for the week.

1351
01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:10.410
We're just blowing through the topics here.
Youtube videos for the week.
A pug.

1352
01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:14.760
Pug Sings Batman theme.
Look that one up there,
right?

1353
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:16.530
Pug as in the dog.

1354
01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:21.560
PUBG pug as opposed to a Gore pug sings Batman theme.

1355
01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:24.900
Um,
drunk ass knock out.

1356
01:29:26.290 --> 01:29:29.640
A lot of this shit's going to have to do with alcohol this week.

1357
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:32.910
A wasted guy at Coachella,

1358
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:36.060
Coachella is c o c h e l l a.

1359
01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:42.390
And here's one for you,
a do something difficult and you know what?

1360
01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:46.680
I actually forgot the most fucked up one of the week.

1361
01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:50.670
I have to just bear with me here.
I have my,

1362
01:29:50.690 --> 01:29:53.040
the microphone laying on my chest right now.

1363
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:57.420
I want to say somebody used to do that.
Didn't like one of those,

1364
01:29:57.810 --> 01:30:01.080
those guys late at night when they're trying to sell you shit before they came

1365
01:30:01.081 --> 01:30:05.490
up with the Janet Jackson Mcdonald's drive through headset.

1366
01:30:05.530 --> 01:30:09.840
Didn't they have like that hands free device where the microphone just dangled

1367
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:15.300
from your neck?
I want to say that they had that all the other guys,

1368
01:30:15.301 --> 01:30:17.610
that's a movie coming out that the other guys,

1369
01:30:17.670 --> 01:30:22.380
I actually had an audition for that movie and I got all the way down to the part

1370
01:30:22.381 --> 01:30:26.460
where the guy who got the part was fucking,
he,

1371
01:30:26.461 --> 01:30:30.300
I think he went in before me and killed it.
So now when I see that movie,

1372
01:30:30.301 --> 01:30:33.660
I'm like,
ah,
look.
So fucking funny.
I could've been in there with eight lines.

1373
01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:38.190
God dammit.
All right.
The fucking,

1374
01:30:39.130 --> 01:30:39.720
all right.

1375
01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:44.720
What's the name of this video woman finds man in bed,

1376
01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:49.560
something like that.
Oh,
here.
Women.

1377
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:53.970
Woman wakes up to find intruder in her bed.

1378
01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:58.800
You gotta see this one?
It's so fucked up.
I don't even know if it's real.

1379
01:30:59.430 --> 01:31:04.320
It looks like a fucking in living color sketch.
Um,
all right.

1380
01:31:04.321 --> 01:31:07.590
Overrated.
Underrated for this week and the overrated or underrated this week.
Uh,

1381
01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:10.980
you guys really took it to another level here.
This is fucking phenomenal.

1382
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.530
All right.
Underrated.
Uh,

1383
01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:17.550
first kid in your junior high that admitted to jerking off.

1384
01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:25.290
That might be one of my favorite underwriters of all time.

1385
01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:29.580
What a fucking champ had kid was.
You know,
you know,

1386
01:31:29.581 --> 01:31:33.750
some people are still trying to find themselves at 35 or possibly 42,

1387
01:31:33.810 --> 01:31:38.520
like myself.
That kid knew the fuck he was in junior high.

1388
01:31:40.110 --> 01:31:42.570
Hey,
jerking off I do it.
Fucking feels good.

1389
01:31:43.890 --> 01:31:46.590
Fucking rub one out in next class.
I like to teach her.

1390
01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:50.730
She's still with something for me.
One,
I'm the last guy in the,
in the,

1391
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:54.630
in the fucking row.
Just don't turn around,
you'll be fine.
Um,
number two,

1392
01:31:54.631 --> 01:31:58.590
whoever commented that Roger Ebert now looks like one of the muppets from the

1393
01:31:58.591 --> 01:32:02.050
land of Confusion Video Jesus Christ.
On a side note,

1394
01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:06.430
that is one of the creepiest videos ever.
Yeah,
man.

1395
01:32:06.431 --> 01:32:10.150
Poor Roger Ebert,
Jesus Christ.
You know what I mean?
How ironic is that?

1396
01:32:10.151 --> 01:32:14.860
That he spent his life criticizing people and then he gets fucking mouth cancer,

1397
01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:19.240
you know,
and he's,
he's still criticizing shit.
He's like,

1398
01:32:19.241 --> 01:32:23.440
he's like the God damn a terminator.
Um,

1399
01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:26.530
Jesus Christ.
And if that's true,
what the fuck am I going to get?

1400
01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:31.480
The fuck's going to happen to me.
All this shit that I spew.
Number three,

1401
01:32:32.110 --> 01:32:37.030
Leopold butter's Scotch.
Next to Carmen,

1402
01:32:37.031 --> 01:32:41.320
the best character on South Park.
I hope I said the dude's name right.

1403
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:45.300
I love South Park.
I really loved and,
and I'm actually,
I'm going to,
uh,

1404
01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:48.550
I'm starting to watch the boondocks because everybody told me that's the shit.

1405
01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:53.530
So watch it with me.
And,
uh,
let's watch a quality show together.

1406
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:56.500
What do you say?
People.
Anybody else watching?
Breaking bad.

1407
01:32:56.501 --> 01:33:00.490
I can't believe I've been watching it for three fucking seasons and I haven't.

1408
01:33:00.491 --> 01:33:04.090
Um,
I haven't,
uh,
haven't really talked about it.

1409
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:07.390
I fucking love it.
It's a God damn.
It's a great show.

1410
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:11.320
But I've yet to get into that advertising.
Mad,
mad,
mad men.

1411
01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:16.210
Mad Money.
The fuck is it?
I don't know how everybody walks around smoking.

1412
01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:21.040
Um,
I heard it's great and everybody on that shows dressed in suits,

1413
01:33:21.041 --> 01:33:25.720
which I like a number four underrated.
This is another great one.
This is a new,

1414
01:33:25.721 --> 01:33:30.460
this is this.
This is this person's first contribution to the podcast and a,

1415
01:33:30.461 --> 01:33:34.840
I think this person should be a staff writer is another fucking gem number four

1416
01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:39.910
station wagons in the 80s with the rear seats facing out the back window.

1417
01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.140
Kids have everything today,
but they missed out on that one.

1418
01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:49.560
Do you know my parents had an 83 caprice classic maroon with the fake wood going

1419
01:33:50.321 --> 01:33:55.150
down the side,
top of the line,
the wire wheels,
cloth,

1420
01:33:55.151 --> 01:33:59.770
Maroon fucking,
uh,
interior.

1421
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:05.800
We drove all the way out to Chicago one time,
all the way out to Chicago.

1422
01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:10.660
I was in the Middle Cup of my siblings were sitting in the back and I was

1423
01:34:10.661 --> 01:34:15.130
jealous that they got to sit,
you know,
seeing what we just fucking saw.

1424
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:20.080
And then my parents sat in the front ned bench seat that blocked the AC and they

1425
01:34:20.081 --> 01:34:21.670
wouldn't let us put the windows down.

1426
01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:26.460
My fucking dad would sit there with his hands in front of the,
you know,

1427
01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:31.660
he's hands on the vent like an inch away from the vent feeling the AC coming
out,

1428
01:34:32.170 --> 01:34:36.550
you know,
completely fucking selfish.
And will they,

1429
01:34:36.551 --> 01:34:40.210
can we turn it on?
We can.
We put the windows down and like,
no,
we got the AC on.

1430
01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:44.020
Yeah.
Well the big cloth bench seat is fucking blocking it

1431
01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:48.100
and we just sat there looking at farmland whizzing by.

1432
01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:51.730
My brother's actually got to stick their heads out the window in the back,

1433
01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:56.890
you know,
like a couple of fucking months and I sat there in the,

1434
01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:59.840
just had to sit there taking it.
All right.
Number five,

1435
01:34:59.841 --> 01:35:02.030
underrated kids in the hall.
Absolutely.

1436
01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:05.600
When people bring up the greatest sketch shows of all time,
you know,
they'll say,

1437
01:35:05.601 --> 01:35:09.350
Mr show,
they'll say Dave Chappelle and uh,

1438
01:35:09.351 --> 01:35:11.330
the people in the know also say kids in the hall.

1439
01:35:11.331 --> 01:35:13.790
And I'd have to definitely go with that.
All right.
Overrated.

1440
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:19.700
Humping in the shower apps a Fuckin lutely that's exciting.

1441
01:35:19.701 --> 01:35:24.680
When you're in college,
you know that sensation of water,
you know?

1442
01:35:26.230 --> 01:35:29.360
Yeah.
Hopping in the shower is weird.
Then the water's hitting her booty crack.

1443
01:35:29.361 --> 01:35:31.700
It starts making a weird noise.
You know,

1444
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:35.810
it's a water shoots up from her fucking ass crack.

1445
01:35:35.811 --> 01:35:40.550
It's hitting you and your lower jaw,
you know,
who can concentrate.
Um,

1446
01:35:40.551 --> 01:35:44.930
number two,
uh,
bartenders that claim to have created their own drink.

1447
01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:53.150
Is it ever good?
It's never fucking good.
Uh,
overrated.

1448
01:35:53.151 --> 01:35:57.320
Bourbon Street.
I got to go at the end.
That is overrated.

1449
01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:58.640
You fucking go down there.

1450
01:35:58.641 --> 01:36:01.760
It's a bunch of God damn tours who can't hold their fucking alcohol.

1451
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:05.510
And then there's a bunch of God damn wolves on the side streets waiting to

1452
01:36:05.511 --> 01:36:09.410
fucking stick a knife in your neck.
Uh,

1453
01:36:09.411 --> 01:36:14.340
also overrated national spelling.
Bee contests are overrated.
Uh,

1454
01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:15.890
I dunno,
I dunno if I go,

1455
01:36:15.891 --> 01:36:18.830
I actually liked those ones and I think it's great that those kids learn how to

1456
01:36:18.831 --> 01:36:23.090
fucking spell.
It's something that I wish I learned how to do and um,

1457
01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:25.093
I root for,

1458
01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:28.130
I want him to win the spelling bee and I also want them to get laid before the

1459
01:36:28.131 --> 01:36:31.220
36.
Um,
and here's a random one.

1460
01:36:31.221 --> 01:36:34.370
Go on Google maps and you know when he can hit satellite,

1461
01:36:35.230 --> 01:36:37.500
it actually looked down,
you know,

1462
01:36:37.501 --> 01:36:40.470
and actually bring yourself down on the street with that little man.

1463
01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:43.950
Here's one for you in the middle of France.

1464
01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:46.140
This is what you want to look up his,

1465

Google map that hit the satellite.

1479
01:37:39.701 --> 01:37:44.140
Bring the little man down on the street and tell me what the fuck that is on

1480
01:37:44.141 --> 01:37:46.180
that porch.
Tell me that's not a fucking alien.

1481
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:52.260
There's an alien on the porch and the satellite cut the picture of it.
I Dunno.

1482
01:37:52.290 --> 01:37:56.400
Who knows?
It's probably a goddamn beehive.
That was a fucking way to go.

1483
01:37:56.850 --> 01:37:57.540
But I like it.

1484
01:37:57.540 --> 01:38:02.370
I take it that it has a lot to do to good theme for this podcast.
You know,

1485
01:38:02.371 --> 01:38:06.180
for a hung over son of a bitch with nothing in his,
in his,
in his stomach.

1486
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:10.500
Other than the two slices of pizza that I ate at one in the morning.
La Pizza,

1487
01:38:10.501 --> 01:38:14.400
by the way.
See,
you know,
it was good.
Um,
you know,
something I just realized,

1488
01:38:14.401 --> 01:38:17.580
I feel like I haven't said anything funny in the last 20 minutes.

1489
01:38:17.670 --> 01:38:18.600
How long ago was that?

1490
01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:22.200
Clinton Gore with they're bitchy bodies sachet and around the White House.

1491
01:38:22.201 --> 01:38:26.010
I know that that was funny.
Uh,
the sound of their milk,

1492
01:38:26.011 --> 01:38:29.490
white hips hitting that fucking suit material.

1493
01:38:34.770 --> 01:38:39.450
Nationwide healthcare,
just walking around the Oval Office,

1494
01:38:41.370 --> 01:38:45.360
both of them,
Eh,
you know something I'm going to,

1495
01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:48.330
I'm going to vote them that in my lifetime.

1496
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:53.460
The too bitchy as that's the bitchy as tandem that has ever,

1497
01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:58.220
ever been in the White House.
You know what I mean?
I'll tell you right now,
I,

1498
01:38:58.310 --> 01:39:01.350
and I didn't vote for him for,
well actually 96.

1499
01:39:01.351 --> 01:39:03.150
Actually in 96 I did vote for Clinton,

1500
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:07.560
but after that I've just gone rogue because then Clinton just turned out to be

1501
01:39:07.561 --> 01:39:10.920
the same fucking dude that,
that,
that,
that other guy,

1502
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:14.760
the angry guy with the pen Bob Dole.
Right.

1503
01:39:15.210 --> 01:39:18.360
Either he did the same shit.
They all do the same shit.
Oh,

1504
01:39:18.361 --> 01:39:21.300
you fucking morons who voted for Obama and now you're surprised.

1505
01:39:21.301 --> 01:39:25.110
Can you believe he's pretty much doing what Mccain would've done?

1506
01:39:26.490 --> 01:39:30.050
And I'm not talking about the is shit,
I'm talking about the Afghans.
Yeah.

1507
01:39:30.051 --> 01:39:33.900
I had a fucking,
I don't even know what I'm talking about,
but I'm sick.

1508
01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:36.330
All you douchebags bitching about all the taxes.

1509
01:39:36.331 --> 01:39:38.430
Do you really think you're going to have to fucking wars?

1510
01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:44.780
And at some point when all the rich people get up from the table after they take

1511
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:47.580
fucking show and screw man,
when you did that,

1512
01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:50.640
you walked in with your buddies and he ordered a big fucking meal and when the

1513
01:39:50.641 --> 01:39:51.690
waitress went up to bar,

1514
01:39:51.691 --> 01:39:55.950
y'all ran out the door and you jumped into your fucking AMC Gremlin and drove

1515
01:39:55.951 --> 01:40:00.570
away laughing,
laughing your ass off.
And that poor Brian had to pay for it.

1516
01:40:03.090 --> 01:40:04.830
Do you know that there's a place in Norwood,

1517
01:40:04.831 --> 01:40:07.800
Massachusetts called the Cafe Venice.

1518
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:12.210
And I did that 20 years ago and I still feel guilty about it.

1519
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:17.580
I went in there,
and I'm not going to name names,
but it was a bunch of names,

1520
01:40:17.581 --> 01:40:19.050
there's too many names to name.

1521
01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:24.470
And we stood up and we were Gunna pay and we,

1522
01:40:24.691 --> 01:40:27.030
and the waitress was just not there.

1523
01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:32.940
And we just waited and waited and waited and waited.

1524
01:40:33.930 --> 01:40:35.430
And I'm like,
where the fuck is she?

1525
01:40:35.431 --> 01:40:39.030
And then there was that tension and there was somebody,

1526
01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:44.240
there was this weird laugh and somebody out of the group walked out the door and

1527
01:40:45.241 --> 01:40:48.540
then there was that panic.
Oh my God.
It was like that musical chair game.

1528
01:40:48.570 --> 01:40:52.020
You didn't want to be the last one standing when the music's playing,
playing.

1529
01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:55.300
Cause then you got to pay for the check.
And then we all just fucking

1530
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:58.720
just bursted out the door.

1531
01:40:59.790 --> 01:41:02.610
And I remember it because it was really dark in the cafe Venice.

1532
01:41:02.611 --> 01:41:04.200
I don't even know if it even exists anymore.

1533
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:09.000
And then we went out into the sunlight,
couldn't fucking see shit,

1534
01:41:09.001 --> 01:41:12.030
just running towards something that looked like the shape of our car.

1535
01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:16.910
Just that young
fucking energy that you had.

1536
01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:21.680
We could actually be stuffed with food and still run and laugh and still get

1537
01:41:21.681 --> 01:41:22.610
away,
you know?

1538
01:41:23.290 --> 01:41:27.440
And we just got in the car and just laughed our asses off the hallway.

1539
01:41:27.441 --> 01:41:28.101
And I immediately,

1540
01:41:28.101 --> 01:41:31.220
afterwards I felt guilty because I knew that she would have to pay for it.

1541
01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:35.190
And uh,
this is how young I was.

1542
01:41:35.191 --> 01:41:40.080
I actually ordered a large milk with my Italian meal.

1543
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:47.040
I was like 18 or 19 and I was one of those guys who just never stopped drinking

1544
01:41:47.041 --> 01:41:49.620
milk.
I didn't stop drinking milk until I was like,
I dunno.

1545
01:41:49.650 --> 01:41:53.670
Somewhere in my fucking late twenties I used to drink.
I loved it.

1546
01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:58.350
I loved the nice cold glass of fucking milk.
And I had it with like every meal

1547
01:41:59.930 --> 01:42:03.170
and it was,
you know,
my first time at 18 we're all of a sudden,

1548
01:42:03.171 --> 01:42:05.030
you're not realizing you're hanging out with the adults.

1549
01:42:05.031 --> 01:42:10.031
I just graduated high school and everybody's ordering and they go,

1550
01:42:10.341 --> 01:42:13.380
yeah,
let me get,
let me get a,
you know,
some fuck the league,

1551
01:42:13.450 --> 01:42:18.450
Tony with the fucking meat sauce over there and I'll get a fucking coke in a

1552
01:42:18.501 --> 01:42:22.390
while.
Everyone's ordering coax a bear and blah,
blah,
blah.
And I was like,
uh,
oh,

1553
01:42:22.391 --> 01:42:26.810
I have this spaghetti and meatballs and I a have a large milk.

1554
01:42:27.110 --> 01:42:31.760
And there was this pause and then the ball breaking began and it never fucking

1555
01:42:31.761 --> 01:42:35.480
ended for the rest of it,
you know?
And uh,

1556
01:42:37.470 --> 01:42:40.440
whatever.
I Dunno what the fuck I'm saying.
What the fuck am I saying?
Oh yeah,

1557
01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:44.520
yeah.
So they,
we got to fucking wars for eight goddamn years.

1558
01:42:44.521 --> 01:42:48.990
And then all the corporations got up from the table,
ran out to their fucking,
uh,

1559
01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:52.740
top of the line,
bulletproof SUV,

1560
01:42:52.890 --> 01:42:57.600
and they drove off and yet they left us with the tab and all you guys think that

1561
01:42:57.601 --> 01:42:59.010
we're not going to have to pay it back.

1562
01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:03.060
You think the taxes aren't coming to fuck?
They're coming.
Oh,
they're coming.

1563
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:08.040
There you go.
That was my fucking what's going on with the world

1564
01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:13.330
now?
Fuck you.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1565
01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:16.290
<v 1>Whatever.
I made it to an hour.
I made another one.
That's all it is.</v>

1566
01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:17.693
That's all it is.

1567
01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:22.630
It's like the drew Carey show the last nine seasons with it just going,

1568
01:43:22.650 --> 01:43:27.270
whatever it's syndication money.
Who gives a fuck?
Let's just bring in some fat,

1569
01:43:27.271 --> 01:43:32.160
broad with crazy makeup and have drew yell at her when People Watch it.
Great.

1570
01:43:32.190 --> 01:43:37.080
We'll all get fucking paid.
We're all going to get fucking paid hate.

1571
01:43:37.081 --> 01:43:38.880
Anybody read that story in that magazine?

1572
01:43:38.881 --> 01:43:42.630
I think it was Esquire magazine about that guy who fucking went on the prices.

1573
01:43:42.631 --> 01:43:47.620
Right?
And like a card counter.
He,
he just,
he broke the bank.

1574
01:43:47.621 --> 01:43:52.120
He went both showcases in the 37 years or whatever,
the shock,
the

1575
01:43:52.230 --> 01:43:54.000
<v 3>prices,
right,
has been on the air.</v>

1576
01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:59.390
No one has ever guessed the exact amount of the showcase that they bid on and

1577
01:44:00.641 --> 01:44:01.474
this guy did it.

1578
01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:04.930
And all you have to do is come within 50 bucks or 100 bucks and you win both

1579
01:44:04.931 --> 01:44:08.350
showcases.
And this guy,
he fucking,

1580
01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:11.350
he nailed bullshit.
He hit it right on the head.

1581
01:44:12.710 --> 01:44:17.150
And so the point they thought he was cheating because everybody was winning that

1582
01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:21.230
day and they can't figure it out if it was him or if it was this other guy in

1583
01:44:21.231 --> 01:44:23.480
the audience who was fucking tip and people off,

1584
01:44:23.481 --> 01:44:26.210
cause he would give it away cars.
And I guess the price is right,

1585
01:44:26.211 --> 01:44:27.830
has to pay for the prizes.

1586
01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.090
So evidently drew Carey didn't think that the episode was going to air,

1587
01:44:32.330 --> 01:44:35.030
so he was kind of a Dick when he said you won both.

1588
01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:38.300
And then I guess they ended up fucking airing it during like a sweeps week.

1589
01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:42.080
So he kind of looked like a dick,
but,
uh,
I guess,
uh,
prices,
right?

1590
01:44:42.081 --> 01:44:44.530
People were not thrilled.
So is this,

1591
01:44:44.531 --> 01:44:47.300
this whole article and he's saying the,
uh,

1592
01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:52.330
he's only guilty of being an avid fan of the show and the price is right fucked

1593
01:44:52.971 --> 01:44:57.930
up by,
they would have reoccurring prices.
I'm Rena reoccurring prizes,

1594
01:44:58.980 --> 01:45:02.390
like they had some sort of smoke around there.
One of those eggs,
smokers.
You've,

1595
01:45:02.391 --> 01:45:05.300
have you ever seen those?
Fucking thanks.
Um,

1596
01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:11.120
and he knew the exact fucking price of it.
So when he was in contestants row,

1597
01:45:11.150 --> 01:45:15.380
they will,
like the egg smoker.
Somebody was like 1500 and Egos,

1598
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:19.330
you know?
And if you don't know the exact prices,
somebody says 1500,

1599
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:22.490
you think it's about 1500?
You usually go 1501.

1600
01:45:23.570 --> 01:45:27.930
Oh you say 1200 to try to get the next,
you know,
300 in your favor.

1601
01:45:28.230 --> 01:45:32.970
He said,
like,
fucking a,
I'm going to go with the 1478.

1602
01:45:33.090 --> 01:45:36.690
And he nailed it first.
Fred fucking flat.

1603
01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:40.380
Am I really going to go through the whole episode?
It's out there people.

1604
01:45:40.381 --> 01:45:44.380
But would have to go to the [inaudible] podcast.com this weekend I'm going to be

1605
01:45:44.381 --> 01:45:46.750
down in La Jolla,
California,

1606
01:45:46.810 --> 01:45:49.690
just outside of San Diego playing the comedy store,

1607
01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:52.240
my home away from home out here in La.

1608
01:45:52.241 --> 01:45:56.440
I'm going to do the one down in La Jolla and uh,
bring your ass down there.

1609
01:45:56.441 --> 01:46:01.150
I got a brand new hour as shit and uh,
I can not wait to go down there.

1610
01:46:01.190 --> 01:46:05.380
I'm going to spend the fucking weekend down there,
get a sunburn on the beach,

1611
01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:10.490
maybe do a little golfing.
And uh,
even though I don't golf,

1612
01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:11.870
I just like fucking,
you know,

1613
01:46:11.871 --> 01:46:14.840
going out there and slowing it down for the other cuts on the course.

1614
01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:19.940
And that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.
God bless all he is.
And uh,

1615
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:23.320
by the way,
in two weeks,
I want to be at the Newport Yannick Center in Newport,

1616
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:24.050
Rhode Island,

1617
01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:26.750
and I'm going to be at the Hampton Beach Ballroom Casino in Hampton,

1618
01:46:26.751 --> 01:46:30.030
New Hampshire.
Uh,
I got to sell a ton of fucking ticket.

1619
01:46:30.031 --> 01:46:33.050
So if you're not doing anything for the love of God,

1620
01:46:33.170 --> 01:46:35.900
you and all your friends come on down,
get hammered.

1621
01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:38.930
If you're the waitress from the cafe Venice,
please show up.

1622
01:46:38.931 --> 01:46:43.190
I'll give you a DVD and I'll give you the fucking 100 bucks with interest that I

1623
01:46:43.191 --> 01:46:43.700
owe you from

1624
01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:48.230
<v 14>fucking goddamn 22 years ago.
All right,
everybody have a good week.</v>
