1
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.990
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:09.130
April 14th,
2000 and flood a,
uh,

3
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.200
Jesus Christ.
I've been sitting here.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.300
<v 0>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.030
<v 1>Uh,
I'm still,
uh,
in France.</v>

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.370
This is the last fucking week I'm in France.

7
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.960
<v 1>Um,
last couple of days here.</v>

9
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.290
So that's why I'm still using the garage band thing and it sounds a little
weird,

10
00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:26.680
but I've been sitting here for fucking a half hour.

11
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.820
<v 1>Waiting for the lovely Nia to leave the apartment so I can do the Goddamn</v>

13
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.710
podcast.
She's probably going to come back here in the end,
but uh,
I just,
I mean,

14
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.550
does anything take fucking longer?

15
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.410
I know this is a hacky bit and it's been done a zillion times by every comic out

16
00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:48.370
there was a fucking sweater and works totally clean.

17
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.890
I see this and women do that,
but there's anything fucking take longer.

18
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.290
Then a woman getting ready to leave.
I actually had a die and laughing.

19
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.140
She grabs his fucking bag and the amount of shit she's putting in it as,
okay,

20
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.820
you're going on an excursion.
She had medicine in there.

21
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.690
She grabbed like fucking three different things to put on her head or around her

22
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:17.280
neck,
scarves,
fucking whatevers.
I don't know.

23
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.300
Why does it take him?
So,
um,

24
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.870
I just kept saying,
get the fuck out of here

25
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.243
anyways,

26
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.510
so I didn't know what the fuck I'm going to talk about this week because I

27
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:36.420
haven't been doing shit.
I haven't watched shit.

28
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.270
I haven't talked on his cell phone in forever.
Um,

29
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.550
I'm completely out of the loop.
Like I finally just checked in with the NHL,

30
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.560
nhl.com to see what the hell was going on.
Um,
oh,

31
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:53.820
and by the way,
if you lived over here,
uh,
you would,

32
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.980
you would get into soccer or football.
Uh,

33
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.200
you'd get into rugby,
you'd watch all those sports Ed,
you'd enjoy it.

34
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.400
They're great games.

35
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:08.100
That's what I realized once a Ben over here fucking long enough.

36
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.360
And at some point you have to watch your goddamn sporting event,

37
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.020
you know,
and uh,

38
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.050
you go in there and everybody's into the thing and you just,

39
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.480
you just get sucked into it.
Like,
I'm,

40
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:24.930
I'm actually rubber necking down when I walked by screens and there's a soccer

41
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:29.490
game on and I never want I,
you know,
I don't watch it at shit.
Um,

42
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.090
and late last night I did catch,

43
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.023
<v 0>uh,</v>

44
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.590
<v 1>the ending of the masters.
I think Bubba Watson won.
I hope he did.</v>

45
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.280
I saw when he birdied any went up by three and then I checked in on the Internet

46
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:49.730
when he had two holes to play and he seemed like he had it.
Um,

47
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.180
but I promised my wife I would come back here and watch.

48
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:56.240
I swear to God the Devil Wears Prada.

49
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.160
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.370
<v 1>You know,
trying to keep the peace.</v>

51
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.920
<v 0>I agree to come back and watch this fucking film</v>

52
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.240
<v 1>and uh,
I gotta tell you it was worse than I thought it was going to be.</v>

53
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.550
I figured if Meryl Streep is in it,
you know,
it's gotta be good on some level.

54
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.540
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.960
<v 1>Watch that movie or somebody,
somebody can,
somebody,
actually,</v>

56
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:24.550
I don't want to do this to a guy.
Is there a woman out there that can do this?

57
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:29.551
Can you somehow cut that movie down to how many times a seem starts with one or

58
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:35.860
two people walking fast into the scene.

59
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.200
<v 0>Okay.</v>

60
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.550
<v 1>That whole fucking,</v>

61
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.970
the whole ridiculousness of fashion in general and these fucking people walking

62
00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:49.250
in,
okay,
I need six dresses of this at Blah,
blah,
blah,
Blah Blah and all that.

63
00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:49.970
And like,

64
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.970
I couldn't watch the movie because within the first three minutes I'm yelling at

65
00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:59.220
the screen
to Meryl Streep's character.

66
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.510
You don't get it yourself.
You silver haired can't.
Right.

67
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.770
So Nias is punching me.

68
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.090
And she was just so ridiculously mean in that movie that after a while I didn't

69
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:16.920
have any sympathy for the big brown eyed girl who sat there getting abused.

70
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.480
So finally,
after like a half hour,
I start like not enough.

71
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.180
Granted I got a couple of beers in me,
you know,
more than a couple of,
okay,

72
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.530
I've been drinking this shit over here.

73
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.550
1664 it's hilarious with typical Americans needs sit and they go,

74
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:36.240
was that the year,
the French Revolution?

75
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.140
And the only reason why I knew it wasn't it was because I just,
you know,

76
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.750
being in France,
you stumble across some shit about that.
Again,

77
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:47.400
I think that was 1789 so we looked it up to see what the significance was and it

78
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:49.410
was just the year that the brewery started.

79
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.300
So anyway,
so I've been knocking those things back.

80
00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:55.950
Those have been my core light over here,

81
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.700
the 1664 whatever the fuck he Ernest and anyways,

82
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.710
so I lasted about maybe 45 minutes into it and the dude for Martha Rogers in it

83
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.450
and they didn't give him anything to do,
the poor bastard.

84
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.710
All he had to do is just sit there and be like,
what?
She was being a bitch again.

85
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.440
Can I make you some food?
Do you look hot?
I want to fuck you.

86
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.940
That was his scene every fucking time you saw him.
Um,

87
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.580
so anyways,
you like,
I'm reviewing this movie that came up,

88
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.250
I thought like three years ago,
I guess it was like 10 years ago,
but so anyway,

89
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:34.251
so I pass out slash falls and right before I go to sleep I say to Nia and go,

90
00:05:35.821 --> 00:05:40.410
wake me up when she tells this woman to go fuck herself.
And she goes,
okay,

91
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:43.760
I will.
And she didn't,
you know,

92
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:45.810
I guess why would you,

93
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.970
why would you wake up somebody who finally nodded off who's been calling?

94
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.430
One of the main characters is silver haired content.
I understood the decision,

95
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.950
you know,
but the next day I woke up and I said,
so what did finally say to her?

96
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.020
And she goes,
actually,
she didn't say anything.
She just sort of walked away.

97
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.920
What a horrible movie.

98
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.933
<v 0>MMM.</v>

99
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.400
<v 1>Oh.
Anyways,
uh,
where we're staying,
the guy who runs the place is from a,</v>

100
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.630
you some London,
and he was talking about some,

101
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.580
that Woody Allen movie that had won an Oscar.
I was downstairs.
He goes,
did you,

102
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.530
did you say that?
I go,
yeah,
yeah.

103
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.750
And I go,
yeah,
I liked it.
I thought it was great,
and he goes,

104
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:37.670
you thought was great.
She goes,
I thought it was absolute rubbish.

105
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.400
I love when he goes,
people say that rubbish,

106
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.550
absolute rubbish didn't go anywhere.

107
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:46.490
It's like it movie starts.

108
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:49.820
The woman's crazy and I can't do the English accent.

109
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.670
He basically said in the end of the movie,
she's still crazy.
He goes,

110
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:55.910
I thought a movie's supposed to lift you up and take your sub where he said,

111
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:58.980
the movie didn't take you anywhere.
And I do admit,
I,

112
00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:03.800
I couldn't argue with this criticism of it.
I still liked it.
Oh Jesus.

113
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:07.440
What am I fucking Siskel and Ebert over here?
Um,

114
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.450
I got nothing to talk about people.
I really don't.
So as I was mentioning,

115
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:14.600
I checked in with the,
uh,

116
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.250
with the NHL to see what was,
uh,
what was going on.
And Lo and behold,

117
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.080
it's time for the playoffs.
So having not watched any of the shit

118
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.580
for weeks,
now I'm going to give you my picks.

119
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.400
These are my picks are right.
First round.
We got the Bro.

120
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:36.610
It's airway go bro wins.

121
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.250
Here we go first.
The Detroit Red Wings.

122
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.050
Who are now in the east for those of you who have been sleeping.
Um,
yeah.

123
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:47.330
I don't know.
I think I'm going to go with the [inaudible] on that one.

124
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.700
Then you got the fucking hated habs against the lightening.
I'd take the habs.

125
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.340
I think Pittsburgh is going to beat the blue jackets and I liked the flyers to

126
00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:00.440
beat the fucking rages.

127
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.540
<v 0>MMM.</v>

128
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.570
<v 1>Over in the West.
The best thing about the west,</v>

129
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:07.660
if you're a fan of a team from the east is that they're all going to beat the

130
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:10.540
shit out of each other and only one's going to be left in the finals.

131
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.680
That's the only thing I can say about that because,
uh,

132
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.910
they look fucking strong out there.
Uh,
I'm gonna say,
uh,

133
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.960
Minnesota and an upset over the ABS.

134
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:22.090
Uh,

135
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:26.950
unfortunately I don't think Saint Louis is going to get by Chicago and polling

136
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:31.660
for those guys to finally fucking make a run.
Uh,

137
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:34.990
and I'm going to beat Dallas and I think that kings are going to beat San Jose

138
00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:38.590
and those are my picks with absolutely no information behind them.

139
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.580
I have not watched a hockey game in two weeks.
So there you go.

140
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.230
No information behind those pics.
I'm picking them like a fucking,

141
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.120
like a check when you know what that means.
Most of those have probably come in,

142
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.040
don't,
don't put any money on it cause I don't,
I don't want to deal with that.

143
00:08:56.041 --> 00:09:00.420
So you're probably asking yourself,
so they're fucking French.
Freddy,

144
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.650
what the Hell did you do this week?
I continued butchering their language.

145
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.880
I picked up to new new expressions are a couple of words.

146
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.610
Uh,
an old plats means a flat water.

147
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:14.800
<v 2>Okay.</v>

148
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.660
<v 1>Uh,
excuse me while I miss sue.
Uh,
is Yuval Jay own old plats?</v>

149
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:26.180
Mitzi.
You know,
it's funny too,

150
00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:30.020
I noticed the way they sit,
they don't say we,
they say why

151
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.330
right way.
And then it means like,
yeah,
so if you say we,

152
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.230
that's like you going yes.
And then they immediately know,

153
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.390
even with that one word that you're a tourist.

154
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.660
Forget about your fucking Bruins hat that you're wearing it,
you know,

155
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.650
they say,
would you like a beer?
And you go,
yes instead of,
yeah,
yes,

156
00:09:50.651 --> 00:09:54.280
I would like a beer.
Mr. Thank you.
If you please.

157
00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:01.720
But they've been cool as hell.
So anyways,
um,

158
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.390
I actually went out to,
uh,
Omaha beach this weekend.

159
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.650
I got to tell you something.
Um,
if you ever get a chance,

160
00:10:11.651 --> 00:10:14.470
you got to do it.
It was

161
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:16.880
<v 2>okay.</v>

162
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.930
<v 1>Uh,
you know what a,
it's not really something you can,
I can't express in words.</v>

163
00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:25.490
It was,
it was,
uh,
unbelievably moving.

164
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.390
It was iconic.
Um,

165
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.350
I,
I don't,
I don't know where to start all week.

166
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:38.580
We set up a private tour cause I can't stand,

167
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:44.850
I hate group tours because when you go on group tours,
you know,

168
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.300
aside from seeing fat people in Jean shorts,

169
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:54.260
there's going to be that Douche who like has read up on this subject in,

170
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:58.950
is actually going to try to out nerd the nerd given the fucking tour.

171
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:04.710
And you know,
which all it does is just drag the tour out.

172
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.580
Like,
you know,
I mean,
I'm into it,

173
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:12.810
but I don't need to hear every fucking nookie nook and cranny,
you know,

174
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.220
just give me the fucking bullet points.
Give me the highlights.

175
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.380
Alright.
And with that,
if I want to go deeper into this shit,

176
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.460
I'll do it on my own.
You know what,

177
00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:29.700
you know if there's going to be somebody standing at dress like some civil war

178
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:34.260
reenactor right.
Just that shit.
So I don't want to deal with that.

179
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.890
And uh,
and then also if you have a question,

180
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.480
you don't have to wait for anybody else.

181
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.790
So basically why I choose to do it like that.

182
00:11:45.791 --> 00:11:50.320
So basically you show up
and uh,
the driver takes you.

183
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.010
We stayed in a,
is it by you?
You,
I don't know where

184
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.230
<v 3>the hell it is.
I don't know how you say it.
Um,</v>

185
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.690
oh,
this is fucking hilarious.
So I rented a car.
Um,

186
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.560
once again,
control freak.

187
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:10.120
I don't have to take a fucking shuttle out there with another 20 Douche bags.

188
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.800
I don't,
all right.

189
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.390
So we rented this car one way from a,

190
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:20.170
we took the train from Paris up to buy you.
And uh,
it was amazing.

191
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.680
Just an amazing ride,
you know,
beautiful scenery and that type of thing.

192
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:26.140
Unless you're looking at somebody's house,
then it's always ugly.

193
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.290
Houses near train tracks are always ugly.

194
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:32.800
Cause basically what you're seeing is the backyard is somebody who can't afford

195
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.470
to not live right next to the fucking train tracks.

196
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:40.390
But when you get out of the towns,
the scenery is beautiful.
Um,

197
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.810
so we get out it,
uh,
by you or whatever,
it's what I'm going to call bay.

198
00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.960
You buy you whatever the fuck you call it.
And I go to the,
uh,

199
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.430
the rental car place and now we're in the shit.
Okay.
In Paris,

200
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:57.850
she run into people that can speak English.
We're fucking out there and you know,

201
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:02.500
for the most part nobody speaks any English.
And uh,

202
00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:03.700
when it was actually fun,

203
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.250
I kind of learned what my wife does when she talks to people.

204
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.370
Like she doesn't understand most of what they're saying.

205
00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:14.260
She just looks at what they're doing.

206
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.830
And at some point they'll give away kind of,

207
00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:20.410
they'll betray basically what the fuck they're saying.

208
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.270
<v 1>And what it is is not freaking out.</v>

209
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.290
And you kind of got to sit in the pocket and wait for them to point at
something,

210
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:33.480
do some sort of shoulder shrug because you're renting a car,

211
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.010
which you've done a zillion times.
So you know what happens the,

212
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:42.750
they basically say,
hey,
how are you?
And you're like,
Hey,

213
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.270
my name is so and so.
I want a car.
And then they'll say,

214
00:13:45.271 --> 00:13:49.020
the next thing is do you have an id or do you have a reservation number?

215
00:13:49.021 --> 00:13:53.100
You kind of know this series of questions and there's just something about,
uh,

216
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.920
there'll be either one word that you pick up or just something that they,
they,

217
00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.460
they point or something.
Like I asked this woman where the bathroom was,

218
00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.250
<v 3>we went out to this fucking Jesus Christ.</v>

219
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.550
We went out to this,
I don't know what you call it,

220
00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:13.580
what do you call it when people just take their old shit?
And they just,

221
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:19.090
they all go to the same dirt parking lot of bizarre of a market.

222
00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.220
We went to this fucking market.

223
00:14:22.221 --> 00:14:26.270
So the great thing about this market was they had it in the same place in the

224
00:14:26.271 --> 00:14:29.150
middle of the country every fucking week.

225
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:34.200
<v 1>And,
uh,
so somebody built like a little restaurant up there.
We could go drink.</v>

226
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.360
It was the greatest market I've ever been to.
Right.

227
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.420
Sitting there waiting around all this shit.
I got to tell you,
my wife find pumps,

228
00:14:41.421 --> 00:14:43.710
some gems in there,
but I just don't have the patients.

229
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.940
It's just sitting out on a damn table.
It just looks like shit to me.

230
00:14:47.941 --> 00:14:51.740
So I went in and had a couple of beers and a,

231
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:55.920
this woman didn't speak any English.
And finally I asked her,
uh,
you know,

232
00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.840
way late,
late toilet,
and she's still looking at me like,
what?
And I'm like,

233
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:04.370
Jesus Christ,
I can't even convey that to you,
the fucking toilet CBU play,
right?

234
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:05.870
So,
uh,

235
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:13.050
she starts going a mile a minute and French and I'm like,
I'm fucked.
I don't,

236
00:15:13.051 --> 00:15:17.010
and she's pointing out the door and I have no idea what she's saying.

237
00:15:17.011 --> 00:15:20.850
And then she kinda does this loop around sort of motion with their hand.

238
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.350
And I'm like,
oh,
it's outside and around the fucking corner and low bow that was,

239
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:26.810
<v 2>yeah,</v>

240
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.570
<v 1>WC water closet.
That's what they call it.</v>

241
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:30.930
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

242
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:35.100
<v 1>They call it a water closet.
Cause that sounds much better than uh,</v>

243
00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:40.310
than a shit check,
whatever the fuck you'd call it.
Right.
So I go in there and uh,

244
00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.020
I didn't have my phone on me.
I really wish I could have taken a picture.

245
00:15:43.021 --> 00:15:43.854
I basically,

246
00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:49.470
you stand on this porcelain thing and there's a hole in the ground you just pee

247
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.260
into.
It's like these two porcelain,

248
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.640
like things you're supposed to stand on.
I'm like,

249
00:15:56.641 --> 00:15:58.620
I'm not fucking standing on those things.

250
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:00.560
<v 2>Okay.</v>

251
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.450
<v 1>So I stood behind the porcelain thing and I got a Little Act God,
Ya know,</v>

252
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.670
like Larry Bird and the three point contest,

253
00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:11.690
just one after another going right in the hole.
And you know,

254
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.600
I missed the last 10 seconds.
Um,
anyways,

255
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.800
what was my point?
Oh,
so anyway,
so we got to,
we got to obey you,

256
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:21.890
buy you whatever the fuck you call it.
And um,

257
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.160
oh yeah,
so all that's right.

258
00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:29.830
So I'm renting a car and this is something that I've known,

259
00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.950
I've noticed now that is international.

260
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.070
Anytime you rent a car one way,

261
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.410
<v 2>okay,</v>

262
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.530
<v 1>that location is going to give you the fucking,</v>

263
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:45.140
that car that nobody wants to rent.
It's going to be a fucked up color.

264
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.660
It's going to be a fucked up model.
Something about it.

265
00:16:47.661 --> 00:16:51.970
You know what these people rented.
We rent,

266
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.200
we're two people,
that's all we uh,

267
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:59.280
they gave us this giant Mercedes van that I got nine passenger fucking van and

268
00:17:02.261 --> 00:17:06.910
I'm driving through these little European streets with this thing.

269
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:08.560
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

270
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.110
<v 1>With like two pieces of luggage all the way in the back.</v>

271
00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:13.000
And I know what you think and we'll build some Mercedes.

272
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:17.770
This is what you don't realize about Mercedes is they have a lot of low end

273
00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:22.540
fucking under powered cars that they don't send over to the United States.

274
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.670
A lot of those,
uh,
I'd,
I'd just,
they just feel they can't compete with Honda's.

275
00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:31.750
Toyota's and I dunno,
whatever the Americans are putting out or what.

276
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.380
But this thing was an underpowered hunk of shit with the Mercedes emblem on the

277
00:17:35.381 --> 00:17:38.400
steering wheel.
And a,
I was turning,

278
00:17:38.401 --> 00:17:42.370
I can't tell you how many fucking times I clipped a corner trying to drive this

279
00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:45.400
bus around the corner.
So,
um,

280
00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.100
long story short,
I'm driving this giant Partridge family,

281
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:54.270
Mercedes Benz truck down the Damn Street.

282
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.010
We get to our hotel,

283
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.023
<v 0>uh,</v>

284
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.400
<v 1>everything,
everything's great.</v>

285
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.230
<v 0>And um,</v>

286
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.390
<v 1>we take a quick cat nap and then,
uh,
this guy shows up,</v>

287
00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:11.391
this guy from Scotland and he took us on this unbelievable tour of basically,

288
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.550
um,
Omaha beach in this other area.
Some point,

289
00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:18.780
I already forget the name of it.

290
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.190
And this guy was an absolute maniac,

291
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:29.180
absolutely obsessed with World War II and obsessed with d day.

292
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.450
And he had all these photographs that he had.

293
00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:38.530
He blown up from other books and was talking about misinformation and,

294
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.540
and it was an incredible tour.
The first point of the tour,

295
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.410
you actually like the pill boxes and stuff,
you know,

296
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.880
with the Germans had their machine guns or it was a little barracks.

297
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.910
It was a place to keep their ammunition.
This still there,

298
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.150
you know,
the guns aren't there,

299
00:18:57.151 --> 00:19:02.151
but basically where they were is still there and you get to walk into these

300
00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:07.341
things like on the ground where these cement bags that Germans had put,

301
00:19:08.701 --> 00:19:11.510
you know,
when it's rained and it own,
it all turned hard and out.

302
00:19:11.511 --> 00:19:14.100
Like you can't even if you look at him actually look like rocks,

303
00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:18.300
they look like white rocks but they're actually bags of cement and you just look

304
00:19:18.301 --> 00:19:21.630
in that going like a German soldier,
set those fucking things down.

305
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:23.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

306
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.980
<v 1>And then all the events happened in the,
here they sit 70 years later it,</v>

307
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.620
it gave you goosebumps and um,

308
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.470
this guy knew all the history.
He goes,
this is where private so-and-so came in.

309
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.820
He threw a grenade,

310
00:19:38.821 --> 00:19:43.440
you can see the shrapnel on the wall and you're looking and there's the fucking

311
00:19:43.441 --> 00:19:44.274
shrapnel.

312
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.560
We walked into this one bunker and right to the right was a little like probably

313
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.230
just enough for someone to stand.
And it had like a,

314
00:19:55.231 --> 00:19:58.830
and it was about two inches below the floor that you were at as far as like

315
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.060
where the floor was there.

316
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:05.270
And it was a little shower and our tour guy said Hitler got gassed in World War

317
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:07.110
One.

318
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.940
So he made sure that all of these bunkers had showers in case cause I guess,

319
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:15.110
you know,
it was such a horrific experience for him.
You know,

320
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.240
that he made sure like none of the troops were going to get caught out there

321
00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:22.020
like he did.
And uh,
it was just really bizarre,

322
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:27.600
like human moment from one of the most evil people on the fucking planet.

323
00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:30.330
It's like,
wow,
that guy actually did something nice.

324
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:37.860
So they go people,
he's not all bad when you walk into a German bunker,

325
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.510
he made sure they all had a little shower.
So there you go.

326
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:49.210
There's,
there's one good thing.
He's still has six to 9 million,

327
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.093
you know,

328
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.780
bad things in the other raw part of the ledger.

329
00:20:55.781 --> 00:20:57.150
But he does have that one thick.

330
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.980
I bet that was the thing after he blew his brains out,

331
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.620
if there is an afterlife and God was giving him shit,

332
00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:08.370
I bet he just kept coming back to that.
But,
but,
but I went to,

333
00:21:08.371 --> 00:21:11.560
I put on shower,
did not have to do that.

334
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:20.080
Uh,
you know,
he lost his temper and started yelling at God.
You know,

335
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.190
God just sat there shaking his head.
But part of them had to be like,
I made this,

336
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.980
what the fuck was I doing on that day?

337
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.980
And then he just presses that little button under his desk,

338
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.730
which is why would it be under his desk?
Like what's he nervous?

339
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.550
He's running shit.
He's like the dawn of all dawn's.

340
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:43.450
I bet he just let them talk.
Sit there,
stammering dancing around,

341
00:21:43.451 --> 00:21:47.810
sweating before he fucking open the trap door.
Um,

342
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.650
anyways,
what am I talking about here?
Let me,
let me do a little,

343
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:57.580
a little bit of advertising and I'll get back to this shit here and I apologize

344
00:21:57.581 --> 00:22:00.280
for the sound of the clicking.
I know this is annoying,
but what do you,

345
00:22:00.281 --> 00:22:03.880
what do you want from me?
Well,

391
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.760
You know I hate when they do that.
Shut off the podcast right now.

392
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.130
The fuck I'm doing.
You guys solid here reading your ad.

393
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.760
Then you tell him to shut up my podcast.
You know what they did?

394
00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:58.470
You know they sat there in that little,

395
00:24:59.400 --> 00:24:59.870
<v 4>okay,</v>

396
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.850
<v 3>what are their advertising cubicles?</v>

397
00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.110
<v 4>Okay?</v>

398
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:04.610
<v 3>You know,
they just sat there going like,</v>

399
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:05.570
<v 2>problem is,</v>

400
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:10.260
is they hear the ad and then they're listening to the rest of the podcast has

401
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.113
that data.

402
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.330
<v 3>Well,
what if we told them to turn it off?
Then I'll go fuck yourself.
All right.</v>

403
00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:20.920
So anyways,
so,
um,

404
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:22.730
back to the tour.

405
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.850
So we're walking in and out of these bunkers and um,

406
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.950
oh my God,
he ain't even on the way there.
This tour was so good.

407
00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.730
Like they had all like those,
uh,
I guess English people call them hedge rows,

408
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.310
you know,
back in the day to mark your property,

409
00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:44.780
he grew these giant like rows of bushes.
Then,
I forget what they're called,

410
00:25:44.781 --> 00:25:47.730
but they hit the guy actually let us get out and touch some of them.

411
00:25:47.731 --> 00:25:51.870
They had like these,
these thorns on them that would just rip you to shreds

412
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.120
<v 4>and um,</v>

413
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.240
<v 3>you know,
they would like seven,</v>

414
00:25:56.241 --> 00:25:59.570
eight feet high and could be upwards of eight feet across.

415
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.710
There was no way to get through them.
So I know when that saving private Ryan,

416
00:26:03.711 --> 00:26:05.870
they showed a little bit of the fighting that was going on,

417
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.750
but you couldn't even see through them even today.
Most of them,

418
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.060
you couldn't even see through them.

419
00:26:11.061 --> 00:26:14.690
So as you're walking up the road right on the other side and you could have been

420
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:18.200
an entire,
you know,
I dunno what do you call it,

421
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:21.080
a platoon or a division of Germans.

422
00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.013
<v 4>Uh,</v>

423
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.500
<v 3>it was absolutely insane.
So they used to send patrols out,</v>

424
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:31.450
they tack a little way through it and they would send a patrol into these
fields.

425
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:36.990
And I guess the rule of thumb
and war,
which I,
you know,
I,

426
00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.600
I don't know anything about it.
They never,

427
00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:45.050
they never shoot at a patrol because then you only get like three,

428
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:46.111
four guys.

429
00:26:46.111 --> 00:26:50.100
What you want the patrol to think is that it's safe and then they wait to the

430
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:55.101
entire company basically march is three quarters of the way into the field.

431
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.180
When they have nowhere to hide,

432
00:26:57.181 --> 00:27:01.620
they would just mow him down and the Germans would put like just a couple of nes

433
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:06.330
machine gun nest could handle each one of these fields.
I mean,

434
00:27:06.331 --> 00:27:10.380
it just seemed like after he got off the beach,
you're thinking like,
okay,

435
00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:13.410
now it's going to get a little easier.
And it's just,
it was just a,

436
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.830
it was a shit show.
Basically,
so anyways,
um,

437
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:21.480
so we saw the initial,
uh,
area,

438
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:24.600
whatever the fuck that was called,
and then he's taken us down to Omaha beach.

439
00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:29.300
And I got to tell you,
it was like,
uh,
you know,

440
00:27:29.301 --> 00:27:33.110
it's crazy.
It's a famous beach.
You look at it and it's undeniable.

441
00:27:33.111 --> 00:27:37.010
That's Omaha beach.
And this guy broke down the,
uh,

442
00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:38.680
the entire thing.
You,
you know,

443
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:43.690
I didn't even feel worthy of like walking onto the beach like it,

444
00:27:43.771 --> 00:27:48.320
it had like that level of effect on me,
which I,
I,
you know,

445
00:27:48.321 --> 00:27:53.030
I did,
I didn't know what I was going to think when I got there,
but it was,
um,

446
00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:56.723
it's incredible.

447
00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:01.770
He shows you the pictures and then he starts pointing out on the bluffs with the

448
00:28:01.771 --> 00:28:06.540
Germans were,
and how few that there were,
but I guess the bombing run,

449
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:07.351
we fucked it up.

450
00:28:07.351 --> 00:28:11.220
We didn't do it right on that one where we did it much better on the other

451
00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:15.150
beaches,
Utah and all that.
But we,
uh,
I dunno.

452
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.670
I Dunno.
It was,
it was,
uh,
if he,

453
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.160
if you can somehow get over here and do it,
you know,

454
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.040
all you gotta do is just get the plane ticket.
You can stay in a hostel,

455
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.760
have a banana,
this you're fucking breakfast,
jump on a train and go out there.

456
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:33.300
I highly suggest anybody who's

457
00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:34.620
<v 2>yeah.</v>

458
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.910
<v 3>Ever thought about doing it.
Uh,
you will not be disappointed.
And then in the end,</v>

459
00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:44.950
um,
the end of the tour,
he takes you up to this cemetery,
uh,

460
00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:49.990
the American cemetery.
It's just,
it was,
it's unbelievable.
It's unbelievable.

461
00:28:49.991 --> 00:28:52.970
And they play taps at the top of every hour and right as we got there,
that,

462
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.400
you know,
probably there for like three minutes and you look at it,
all of,

463
00:28:57.401 --> 00:29:02.170
all of those graves,
all of those people that died trying to stop this maniac.

464
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

465
00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.800
<v 3>And,
uh,
and then they play taps.
I mean,</v>

466
00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:10.880
it's overwhelming to say the least.
Um,

467
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:14.060
and then of course there's also the English cemetery,

468
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.560
which a lot of Americans don't know because we watch the American movies and

469
00:29:18.561 --> 00:29:22.620
they make it seem like it was just the Americans who were over there.
Uh,

470
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.270
as always,
but you know,
something,
you know what the fucking,

471
00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.690
this English guy downstairs was laughing,

472
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:33.830
giving me shit about how all the American movies,
like even Argo,
he goes,

473
00:29:33.831 --> 00:29:37.160
you know,
uh,
the English and Dutch helped you guys out with that.
And I go,
well,

474
00:29:37.161 --> 00:29:40.250
you know,
you guys will make your movie then.
And he's laughing.
I'm like,

475
00:29:40.251 --> 00:29:41.980
you guys do it too.
I'm one time I was on

476
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.813
<v 1>opie and Anthony,</v>

477
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.090
the great opie and Anthony Radio program with little Jimmy Jamie door.

478
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.290
And these guys came in from England and they had made a documentary about,

479
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.280
uh,
the late great beast of a comic Bill Hicks.

480
00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:02.680
And they were talking about how bill Hicks went to England.

481
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:05.680
That's where he had to go to get his,
his buzz going,

482
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.270
and then came back and took America by storm.
And he's sitting there saying,

483
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:15.220
[inaudible].
And he said this,
one of the documentary guys was going,

484
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.450
uh,
in while England was listening to Bill Hicks,

485
00:30:19.451 --> 00:30:22.660
people in America were busy wasting their time listening to,

486
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.100
listening to carrot top.

487
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.293
<v 4>And</v>

488
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.700
<v 1>I forget if I said it on air or not and I want to,
I was just like,
dude,</v>

489
00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:33.940
you realize that you're in America right now.
You do realize that.

490
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:35.530
So if you're going to spin these yarns,

491
00:30:35.531 --> 00:30:39.700
like I was alive during this fucking time.
It's,
is that what I was doing?

492
00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.660
And I'm not shitting on carrot top either.
I think the guy's flooding,
but like,

493
00:30:43.661 --> 00:30:47.740
I was like,
oh,
I thought I was listening to Carlin and,
uh,
Sam Kennison.

494
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.850
I thought I really liked Sam Kennison and evidently I didn't.

495
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.690
Uh,
you know,
everybody does that shit.
You know,

496
00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:00.550
we did everything and we understood and these guys were idiots.

497
00:31:00.551 --> 00:31:05.380
So,
uh,
so fuck you English.
You know,
you do the same shit.

498
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:06.750
Anyway,
so

499
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:16.210
I've been over here too long.
I'm not going to lie to you.
As Fun as this is,

500
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.720
this is the most relaxed I've been in forever.
And uh,

501
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.540
but I am ready to go home and I'm ready to go back to work.

502
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.040
I'm ready to start telling jokes again,
and I miss the hell out of my dog.

503
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:29.420
I'm literally walking around.
Um,

504
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.130
every dog I see,
we're staying in this fucking,
uh,

505
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.370
uh,
Saint Tropez or as the locals call it central pay.

506
00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.450
Uh,
yeah,
I know you're like Jesus Christ.
Bill.

507
00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.050
I know this is the vacation and all fucking vacations.

508
00:31:49.051 --> 00:31:52.680
I haven't taken one in forever,
so whatever.
I'm blowing some DVD money over here.

509
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:58.050
Um,
and I got to tell you something.
We're actually here.

510
00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:03.060
It's this,
this summer season starts literally the day after we leave.

511
00:32:03.061 --> 00:32:03.871
So it's kind of cool.

512
00:32:03.871 --> 00:32:06.390
It's a lot of locals and people are just starting to trickle in.

513
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.163
<v 4>And</v>

514
00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.690
<v 1>do you remember that 50 cents?
Uh,</v>

515
00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:15.230
do you call it a song called the wrap is a called a ditty.

516
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:18.740
A P diddy.
I don't know what the fuck you call it,
but you remember that one.

517
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:23.720
I teach you how to stunt
and for people out there as white as me,

518
00:32:23.721 --> 00:32:24.980
which means I basically

519
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.313
<v 4>show you,</v>

520
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:29.703
<v 1>um,</v>

521
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:34.480
how to blow all your money on depreciating assets and make yourself a target

522
00:32:34.481 --> 00:32:37.240
every time you drive down the street.
Um,

523
00:32:37.241 --> 00:32:40.160
I believe that that's what's stunting is,
um,

524
00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:46.370
<v 3>where you walk around with a chain that has a dollar sign on the end of it,</v>

525
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.000
may not have some precious metal,
adds a smart thing to do.

526
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:55.850
Um,
and before all the racist people out there think I'm just talking about,

527
00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:00.440
uh,
African Americans and not,
I'm talking about anybody that's new to money.

528
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.280
Like that's what you do.
Uh,
but these people out here,

529
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:07.010
rich,
old white dudes,

530
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.270
they do the same thing but in a much more subtle way.

531
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:16.460
They show off their fucking wealth.
It's fucking it.
First of all,

532
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:21.020
these French guys out here,
the heads of heroin,

533
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.220
these sons of bitches is incredible and they all have this same haircut.

534
00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:28.960
It's like basically a,
how would I,
how would you describe it?
It's the,

535
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.560
it's like the hockey mullet,

536
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:36.790
but with a page boy quaff at the end of it,

537
00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:41.470
it almost curls back into itself and then they,
they push it back.

538
00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:43.060
It's like a mullet.

539
00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:45.060
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

540
00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:49.980
<v 3>meets a number.
Remember Jackie Stewart,</v>

541
00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:52.410
the Formula One race car driver,

542
00:33:52.411 --> 00:33:57.411
they all have that Irish spring fucking cut into some soap with the knife in the

543
00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.060
70s haircut.
And um,

544
00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:06.890
they have their beautiful wives and they have this sweater draped over him with

545
00:34:08.041 --> 00:34:10.860
a fucking like,
and then they have like one piece on them,

546
00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:15.060
be it a watch glasses,
but it's only one.

547
00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.840
It's one thing that just says I have more money than fucking God.

548
00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:25.790
And then the rest of it is just really neatly put together.
Um,

549
00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.830
it's called having class people.
You know,

550
00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:33.930
you don't sit on the hood of your new car holding up handfuls of cash and use

551
00:34:33.931 --> 00:34:35.610
that as your fucking Facebook page.

552
00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.850
That's what people do who just got money and always wanting money.

553
00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:43.350
These cards here,
these frogs with their fucking money,

554
00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:45.780
these guys,
um,
it's,
it's ridiculous.

555
00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.420
And then every once in a while,
and Oh,

556
00:34:49.421 --> 00:34:53.980
this is another thing that I like is their cars.
They're their whips.

557
00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.860
What I like about these guys,
because they're,

558
00:34:56.950 --> 00:35:01.210
they understand money and how it works.
Um,

559
00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:03.101
they,

560
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:08.101
a lot of them bought some top of the line car like 20 years ago and just kept it

561
00:35:08.441 --> 00:35:11.470
in an impeccable shape.
Like I saw this guy,

562
00:35:11.471 --> 00:35:16.150
he had basically like the 1993 version of the Mercedes.
Uh,

563
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:22.000
what's the top end?
Big One there,
the ESL fucking whatever,

564
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.270
five 55 50.

565
00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:28.750
He had the 1993 version of this and think pulls up absolutely immaculate.

566
00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:30.250
It looks showroom,

567
00:35:30.251 --> 00:35:35.251
brand new and he parked it and he got out and I was able to ask him in broken

568
00:35:36.311 --> 00:35:40.830
French what year the car was,
um,

569
00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:45.810
what would I say,
collage,
blah,
blah,
blah lotto or something like that.

570
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:51.500
And he just beamed with pride and he said 1993 and I was like three VN and he's

571
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.890
like,
you know,
it was,
it just,
he could,
he knew,
he knew.

572
00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.790
Obviously it was some stupid American try to talk to him,
but he,
he uh,

573
00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.070
I was really fucking cool this,
I've seen a couple of people over here,

574
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.290
they don't just buy out a flashy car.

575
00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:07.020
Like they fucking loved that car and they keep it really nice.
I saw like a,

576
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.310
like a 1987,
um,

577
00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:15.660
BMW like m five,
that was looked like in showroom condition.

578
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.610
Um,
so you've got that level of wealth.
And you know,

579
00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:24.750
it's funny too is Nia has just been trashing me because I refuse to buy any

580
00:36:24.751 --> 00:36:29.751
almond Santra pay close and I'm walking in my sweatpants and I got this hat that

581
00:36:32.251 --> 00:36:36.210
I got at that Mario,
the new thing.
And I look like an asshole.

582
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.470
I'm not even gonna lie to you.
I mean,

583
00:36:37.471 --> 00:36:41.410
I even like go to walk out and I see my dad jeans that I'm putting on.
I,

584
00:36:41.411 --> 00:36:44.790
I really look like an asshole,
but I'll give a fuck.

585
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.510
They sit there and buy some salmon colored shorts,
right?

586
00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:51.990
And some dumb sweater to drape over my fucking shoulders.
Um,

587
00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:55.900
anyways,
uh,

588
00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:02.080
you sit down along the fucking water and just one giant God damn boat after

589
00:37:02.621 --> 00:37:06.830
another is sitting there.
And I'm trying to think like,

590
00:37:06.831 --> 00:37:09.460
how much fucking money would you have to have this guy,
this guy,

591
00:37:09.461 --> 00:37:11.720
he's going to fucking boat down there.
I swear to God,

592
00:37:11.721 --> 00:37:14.270
it's gotta be like a $7 million.
It's a,
yet.

593
00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.300
It's got a fly.
This guy,
this guy's book was so fucking big.

594
00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:22.960
I'm sitting in the cafe and I'm,
I'm looking across the street,

595
00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:28.770
across the sidewalk and into the back of this guy's boat and I'm watching.

596
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.090
I thought he was wanting,
this is fucking hilarious.

597
00:37:31.091 --> 00:37:33.430
I thought he was watching a karate movie on his TV.

598
00:37:33.431 --> 00:37:35.620
He was actually watching dancing with the stars.

599
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.830
It shows you what,
what is,
what has happened to karate movies.

600
00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.090
They become too crouching tiger and not enough hidden dragon,

601
00:37:46.091 --> 00:37:47.260
if you know what I mean.
You know,

602
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:52.090
I'd like to see a little more marked for death in my,
you know,

603
00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:56.110
my movies and Judas Freelander always told me mark for death introduced the

604
00:37:56.111 --> 00:38:00.310
breaking of bones into martial arts movies anyways.

605
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:02.190
And I,
yeah,
so I'm basically,

606
00:38:02.191 --> 00:38:06.610
I'm sitting there and I'm watching this guy's TV on his fucking boat from a cafe

607
00:38:06.611 --> 00:38:08.590
across the street.
That's how big this boat was.

608
00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.600
That's how big that fucking TV was.

609
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:15.670
And it's just been parked there all week.
Or doctor,
whatever you say.

610
00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.470
And,
um,

611
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:24.370
at one point I'm coming back into town to buy my 900 fucking cigar of the week

612
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:28.000
and I'm looking on the boat and I see a guy,

613
00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:33.250
it's a chef on the boat,
dressed in like,

614
00:38:33.251 --> 00:38:35.850
you know,
I'm going to go cook a gourmet meal.
I'm just saying like,
I'm,

615
00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.360
how much is that cost a year?

616
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.693
<v 4>Right?</v>

617
00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:45.350
<v 3>You gotta give him at least 8,500 grand of fucking year to just be ready at any</v>

618
00:38:46.471 --> 00:38:47.520
no point.

619
00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:51.690
Like to jump on your boat and make you a fucking sandwich.

620
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:57.780
And I,
I just want to fucking learn how to say,

621
00:38:57.781 --> 00:39:02.160
permission to come aboard and French.
And I just want to find like,

622
00:39:02.161 --> 00:39:03.720
how did you make that?
What did you do?

623
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:10.020
How the fuck do you have that level of money?
Right?
Is that nuts?
Sorry.

624
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.060
I hope I'm not boring.
You guys would this shit over it anyways,

625
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:15.570
so let's get back to the buy you think?

626
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:17.503
<v 4>MMM.</v>

627
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.220
<v 3>We ended up going to this museum when we were there that had all this video and</v>

628
00:39:24.221 --> 00:39:29.010
all these pictures and that type of stuff.
And what was really cool
was,

629
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:33.860
um,
I'd never seen footage like this.
I think a lot of it was,

630
00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.340
you know,
French footage.
And first of all,

631
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:41.970
their museum was way more inclusive.
Like it had,

632
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:45.600
it had the,
the,
the,
uh,

633
00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:52.330
American troops,
British troops,
Canadian troops and French,

634
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.240
the French troops and everything.
You know,
a lot of people like,
you know,

635
00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:58.870
break the French balls,
you know,

636
00:39:58.871 --> 00:40:01.750
my impression of a French soldier and you just put your arms up like you're

637
00:40:01.751 --> 00:40:06.280
surrendering.
I guess it took the Germans like about five,

638
00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:10.600
six weeks to take over France.
And in that time,

639
00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.560
um,
France lost 90,000 troops,

640
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:20.140
not like casualty,
like dead.
That's not even just the wounded.

641
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.350
So they put up a hell of a fight.
But I gotta be honest with you,

642
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.490
if we live that close to the Germans,
we would have fucking lost.
Okay.

643
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:30.340
And we would need somebody to bail us the fuck out too.

644
00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:35.050
And I know right now you go and give me a fucking break.
It's like,
fuck you.
Okay?

645
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:39.630
To this day,
look at their top end cars.
Look at our top end cars.

646
00:40:39.631 --> 00:40:40.740
They're still kicking our ass.

647
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:48.720
I know the Cadillac Corvette,
that's probably the best we have,

648
00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.900
but it's nowhere near what they would do with.

649
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.610
That was another thing that was great on the tour.

650
00:40:53.611 --> 00:40:55.770
They were talking about how much better their weapons were.

651
00:40:55.771 --> 00:40:57.810
So when we fucking kill a German,

652
00:40:57.811 --> 00:41:01.530
we'd pick up their machine gun cause this shit was better than ours.

653
00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.400
We basically,
we,
we fucking wore him down.

654
00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.730
We just come and we came up with what happened and how we finally took the beach

655
00:41:10.731 --> 00:41:15.660
on d day,
eat it.
They ran out of bullets.
We just kept coming

656
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:21.750
this fucking,
they call this guy the butcher of Omaha beach.

657
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.330
He was in this position that was,

658
00:41:24.331 --> 00:41:27.330
they put a gun into the back corner of a hotel

659
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.020
and he was just fucking,
you know,
doing what [inaudible] wanted to do with the,

660
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:36.170
you know,
with this,
God damn,
I don't know what the fuck millimeter he had.

661
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:42.010
And he went through seven hours of ammunition and fucking three hours by the end

662
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:49.300
they was shooting like that weaponry where every third bullets of flair.

663
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.370
And that's how we ended up knocking out.

664
00:41:53.371 --> 00:41:55.310
Could we finally could see where the fuck they were.
I mean,

665
00:41:55.311 --> 00:41:58.660
it was just what happened on that day.
I,

666
00:41:58.661 --> 00:42:02.050
you can't even fucking put it into words and then Dab a moron like me trying to

667
00:42:02.051 --> 00:42:02.884
explain it.

668
00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.373
<v 2>MMM.</v>

669
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:07.770
<v 3>I,
I just,
I,
I can't even imagine it.</v>

670
00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:11.250
I can't even fucking a man as much as like the beginning of saving private Ryan

671
00:42:11.251 --> 00:42:11.761
shows it,

672
00:42:11.761 --> 00:42:16.050
like just to actually just rather than watching some video or movie of it to

673
00:42:16.051 --> 00:42:19.500
just be standing on the beach and this guy's telling you the stories showing you

674
00:42:19.501 --> 00:42:22.980
the pictures.
Do it.
It was,
it was unbelievable.
Unfucking believable.

675
00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:26.700
So anyways,
um,

676
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.400
I got water in my ear.

677
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:34.160
I've had it my fucking year and I've tried every goddamn thing.

678
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:38.660
I've tried blowing a hairdryer into my ear.
I've tried jumping on one foot.

679
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:43.450
I tried sleeping on my side.
It's great.

680
00:42:43.451 --> 00:42:47.020
It's basically just gradually drying up.
And a,

681
00:42:47.021 --> 00:42:49.950
I'm really hoping when I get on the plane,
my ears not gonna fuck with me.

682
00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:51.900
Me Actually,
you know,

683
00:42:51.901 --> 00:42:54.400
what's going on the Internet looking for fucking everything.
Like,

684
00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:58.840
as I'm losing my mind,
I feel like I'm trapped in my own head.
That's how many,

685
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.690
how much water was in there and they were doing the shit.

686
00:43:01.691 --> 00:43:04.900
Make a suction with your own hand.
None of that shit works.

687
00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:10.740
So she finally reads it.
You see,
you go to the pharmacy and you get some,
uh,

688
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:16.920
alcohol and you squirt the alcohol in your ear and add on.

689
00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.390
And I'm just like,
I'm going to put more liquid in there.

690
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:24.730
So I just decided to wait it out.
It's been driving me fucking nuts.
Anyways,

691
00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.940
let's,
uh,
let's bang out of the last couple of,

692
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:33.860
does anybody have like anybody know anything that you can do to get water out of

693
00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:36.270
your ear before I get on a plane and start screaming?

694
00:43:36.271 --> 00:43:39.860
Is the air pressure changes as they pressurize the cabin?

695
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:45.200
Um,
anyways,
here we go.

00:45:57.841 --> 00:45:58.674
burr.

738
00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:00.043
<v 1>All right,</v>

739
00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.480
<v 3>back to the,
uh,
back to the podcast here.
Um,</v>

740
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.390
<v 1>oh,
by the way,
everybody</v>

741
00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:09.841
<v 3>over here,</v>

742
00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:14.841
it seems is either drives a fucking scooter or a God damn motorcycle and uh,

743
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.880
to the point we actually think it's safe,

744
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:20.700
but the dude downstairs is telling me they have more,

745
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.950
more damn accidents over here than anybody else.

746
00:46:22.951 --> 00:46:26.940
But then I'm also thinking whether you got more people on scooters than anybody

747
00:46:26.941 --> 00:46:29.550
else,
and you've got a ton of fucking money over here.

748
00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:32.380
<v 1>So you know what that means?</v>

749
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:35.660
Does that means you basically you can go out and go buy yourself a bike that's

750
00:46:35.661 --> 00:46:38.570
way beyond your capabilities,
right?

751
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:44.570
It also means that you have a complete disregard for 99% of human life.

752
00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.230
Like most rich people do.
You have a sense of entitlement.

753
00:46:48.231 --> 00:46:50.930
You're going to ride your fucking scooter and your motorcycle like that.

754
00:46:50.931 --> 00:46:53.540
That's what I'm saying.
Why am I saying that?

755
00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.380
Because I like riding motorcycles every once in a while and it scares the fuck

756
00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:59.240
out of me that something bad's going to happen.

757
00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:04.070
So what I do is I just justify it away in my head the same way I do when I smoke

758
00:47:04.071 --> 00:47:08.300
a cigar gone.
I don't smoke that many of these fucking things.
You know?

759
00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:11.990
It's what you always am not going to get cirrhosis of the liver.

760
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:17.270
There's plain isn't going to fucking all of a sudden make a left turn and then

761
00:47:17.271 --> 00:47:20.870
nobody can find it.
That's what you do to get through life.

762
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:23.540
It's what you have to do.
Yeah.

763
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:28.010
She's not going to divorce me and take me for everything I got and I'm sure it

764
00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:32.860
puts these claim.
Yeah,
it's only for chocolate by,

765
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:36.250
I'll hit the treadmill tomorrow.
Isn't that what you do?

766
00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:42.300
The Shit.
You just justify it rather than sitting down go,
no,

767
00:47:42.301 --> 00:47:44.610
this is a dumb thing to do.
This is going to make me fat.

768
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.850
I need to wear an extra condom.
Marsha,
probably just go jerk off.

769
00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:49.523
<v 4>You know,</v>

770
00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:53.160
<v 1>maybe if you don't call somebody a gray haired cunt during all the chick flicks,</v>

771
00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:58.170
maybe she won't divorce you and take Kelly's shit.
Right.
You could do that.

772
00:47:58.171 --> 00:48:01.800
That's,
that's called being an adult.
I think it's about time.

773
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:08.600
You all right talking to you right now,
the listener,
it's about time.

774
00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.660
You guys fucking growed up.
Do you understand me?

775
00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.840
I'm getting so fucking sick and tired now kid.
Um,

776
00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:18.740
anyways,
oh,
a last week,

777
00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:20.123
<v 4>mmm.</v>

778
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.300
<v 1>Me and a,
the lovely knit at a,</v>

779
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:29.070
one of our classic debates,
which is basically

780
00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:34.380
the two of us talking over each other and then yelling,

781
00:48:34.381 --> 00:48:38.130
stop interrupting me like most healthy couples do.

782
00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:42.900
Um,
so anyways,
last week,
uh,
for those of you didn't listen,
uh,

783
00:48:42.901 --> 00:48:43.920
what happened was some,

784
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:49.220
what happened was this guy sent an email and he was basically saying that the

785
00:48:49.351 --> 00:48:52.650
woman has been dating for the last six years.
When they got together,

786
00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.110
she was beautiful,
had an amazing body,

787
00:48:55.170 --> 00:49:00.170
and now she has a new stressful job and she's put on like 60 to 70 pounds.

788
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:03.990
So he's talked to her about her weight.
He said he's concerned.

789
00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:07.230
He bought our gym membership.
He's trying to get her healthy meals.

790
00:49:07.231 --> 00:49:11.610
He packs her lunch.
He's going out of his way to try and help her out.

791
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:16.500
And uh,
evidently she's not going to the gym and he found some fast food wrappers

792
00:49:16.501 --> 00:49:21.020
stuffed under the seat of her car or something.
And,
um,
and he's like,

793
00:49:21.021 --> 00:49:25.160
what am I supposed to do?
And Nia flipped out on the guy and I defended the guy.

794
00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:30.080
All right.
And then the listeners,
you guys,

795
00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.880
you guys all chime did not all yet,

796
00:49:31.881 --> 00:49:34.910
but a lot of you sent me emails and a lot of people gave me props.

797
00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:41.040
Um,
for,
am I allowed to say that as a white guy gave me,
um,

798
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:46.270
compliments for staying in the pocket and not allowing myself to be railroaded.

799
00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.170
And then they also criticize me as saying,
you know,
it's a big job.
Be,

800
00:49:51.171 --> 00:49:52.670
feel beautiful,
intelligent.

801
00:49:52.671 --> 00:49:57.671
Could just still only hear what she wants to hear at a,

802
00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:00.560
I would throw that right back at you.
Right back at you.

803
00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:05.510
It would be amazing that you can see her doing that and not notice that you're

804
00:50:05.511 --> 00:50:07.220
doing the same thing.
Just as a guy,

805
00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.790
you're doing the exact same thing that you're given a shit about.

806
00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:12.143
<v 4>You know</v>

807
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000
<v 1>basically what happens there when you have a story between a man and a woman in</v>

808
00:50:18.011 --> 00:50:21.940
a relationship is you just insert yourself into the story.
So it was a guy,

809
00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:22.900
who would you be?

810
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:28.200
You'd be the guy who had the hot girlfriend who now put on 60 to 70 and now has

811
00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.480
is the guy said has sloppy tits.

812
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.890
<v 4>Okay.</v>

813
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:38.330
<v 1>As a woman,
you listened to the story and you listen to,</v>

814
00:50:38.331 --> 00:50:42.950
I have a stressful job.
I'm putting on weight,
I'm doing the best I can.

815
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.950
And the person that I love just said I had sloppy tits.

816
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.870
So her reaction and my reaction were completely normal.
All right?

817
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:53.480
It has nothing to do with intelligence.
It just says to do,
you know,

818
00:50:53.481 --> 00:50:54.440
it's like a fender bender,

819
00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:56.713
<v 4>right?</v>

820
00:50:57.850 --> 00:50:58.220
<v 1>You know,</v>

821
00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:01.770
fuck can we are what you blow right through a stop sign and t bone somebody.

822
00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.420
And when you get out,

823
00:51:03.421 --> 00:51:06.010
the first thing you're going to say is what the fuck we had done.

824
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:09.900
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

825
00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.140
<v 1>yeah.
That stop sign was grade.</v>

826
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:17.430
You're going to come up with some line of Bullshit.
So,
um,
whatever.

827
00:51:17.431 --> 00:51:22.330
You know the deal,
everybody just fucking,
you know,

828
00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:26.890
people here,
what the fuck they want to hear.
All right?
And they respond to it.

829
00:51:26.891 --> 00:51:29.650
So I don't give a shit either way.
God bless you for listening.
But you know,

830
00:51:29.651 --> 00:51:32.740
you don't have to say the,
I mean,

831
00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:35.380
I don't mind you saying how she was being ignorant or whatever,
but some of it,

832
00:51:35.381 --> 00:51:38.050
sometimes,
you know,
the Little Iga,
you gay,
you get a little disrespectful,

833
00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:42.820
the level of derogatory that you fucking,
you take it too,

834
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.863
you know,

835
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:48.580
because you can be anonymous and as you sit there and your cubicle,

836
00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.760
or maybe you have an office,
maybe the office guy,
right?

837
00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:53.920
And you've got that little fucking thing there.

838
00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:58.280
You know those marbles at the end of the the metal things and you're,
you're,

839
00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:03.070
you're there on the pendulum and you fucking swing it and click,
click,
click,

840
00:52:03.071 --> 00:52:07.750
click,
click,
click.
Great.
Just taking away the second.
So the day,

841
00:52:07.751 --> 00:52:11.830
whatever that fucking thing is called,
if you own one of those,

842
00:52:11.831 --> 00:52:15.580
how soon before you get the giant globe in the corner,

843
00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:21.760
that's something a hipster would do.
You know,
I really don't like about hipsters,

844
00:52:21.761 --> 00:52:25.330
which is a really hacky thing to not like half the shit that they make fun of.

845
00:52:25.331 --> 00:52:28.420
They don't even understand.
Like,
uh,

846
00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:31.180
I've noticed a lot of hipsters say like,
they,

847
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:34.030
they're obsessed with tail fins on cars.

848
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:38.500
They think they're so cheesy that they're fucking awesome,
you know,

849
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.210
and they don't even understand the function.

850
00:52:40.211 --> 00:52:42.370
I'm like back in the day with that technology,
you needed them.

851
00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:48.090
Tailfin basically kept the rear end of the car at high speeds on the ground so

852
00:52:50.351 --> 00:52:53.300
you could have more control and you wouldn't get fucking killed.
Now granted,

853
00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:57.070
we put a tail fin on a fucking car that's never going to reach those speeds.

854
00:52:57.071 --> 00:52:59.080
Yeah,
it is funny.
But a Nissan Maxima,

855
00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:01.480
I mean I think you get up 120 miles an hour,
right?

856
00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:06.430
It should have had a tail fin in the early nineties.

857
00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.600
And people enjoyed it.
They liked them,
they looked cool.

858
00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.820
So you stuck them on your car,

859
00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:17.920
even if it didn't need one the same way you put rims on Adda don't going to be

860
00:53:17.921 --> 00:53:20.520
fucking started with that shit.
Um,
so anyways,
um,

861
00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:23.300
I'm probably going to cut this thing short this week because,
uh,

862
00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.130
my internet connection is really horrific out here

863
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:30.780
<v 3>to the point I'm going to have to send this podcast and sections because,
uh,</v>

864
00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.071
I got a bad feeling.

865
00:53:32.071 --> 00:53:35.010
If I try to send the whole thing at once that I'm going to get three quarters of

866
00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:37.910
the way through,
my Internet connection is going to crap out of me.
And,
uh,

867
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:41.760
that's going to be my day trying to send this fucking thing.
So,
um,

868
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:46.740
that is that as a podcast for this week,

869
00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:48.163
um,

870
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:53.790
I hope you enjoyed my little travel fucking diaries.
I don't know.

871
00:53:53.791 --> 00:53:58.740
Next week I'll be back,
you know,
so or of Wa Abby.
At Doe.

872
00:53:58.741 --> 00:54:01.350
Go Fuck Yourself.
That's the podcast for this week.

873
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:06.020
Next week I'll be back home and I'm really ready to go home.

874
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.710
I want to see my dog.
I want to watch some hockey.
You know,

875
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:14.280
I want to eat that American food that makes you fat.
I can't tell you something.

876
00:54:14.281 --> 00:54:18.210
I'm eating like a fucking animal over here and um,
I barely put on any weight.

877
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:19.600
<v 2>Okay.</v>

878
00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.330
<v 3>All right.</v>

879
00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:23.810
I don't know what kind of poison is in our food over there in the states,

880
00:54:23.811 --> 00:54:28.150
but I'm telling you,
I am eating like a fucking boy.

881
00:54:28.151 --> 00:54:31.040
You know something over here you kind of nibble but you're doing it the whole

882
00:54:31.041 --> 00:54:31.874
day.

883
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:32.910
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

884
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:35.370
<v 3>Like all the lunch places close at two o'clock.</v>

885
00:54:35.371 --> 00:54:38.610
So then you have cafes and I always bringing out some sort of pastry or some

886
00:54:38.611 --> 00:54:41.680
shit,
not Jesus Christ.

887
00:54:41.681 --> 00:54:44.950
Listen to me sitting in a cafe and pastries.
What the fuck happened to me?

888
00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.960
I gotta get back to the states.
Um,

889
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:51.990
I will be back next week and the podcast will sound at least semi professional.

890
00:54:52.721 --> 00:54:56.950
I appreciate you guys tough on your way through these things.
And like I said,

891
00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:01.570
once again,
if you ever get a chance to go visit Omaha beach,
you gotta,

892
00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.690
you gotta do it.
You definitely got to do what?
I highly recommend it.
All right.

893
00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.090
That's it.
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
