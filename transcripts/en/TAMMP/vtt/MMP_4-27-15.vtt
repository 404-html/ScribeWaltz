00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.390
Hey,
what's going on?
How are you doing?

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.610
Um,
it's bill burns Monday morning podcast.
I literally,

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.990
literally have just woken up and decided that I have to do this fucking thing

4
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:20.670
cause I gotta go,
I gotta jump back on the bus,
jump back on the bus.

5
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.920
He had an overdue,
a Jackson,
Mississippi.
You know,

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.040
I'm nervous about Mississippi,
you know what I mean?

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.960
This is the one state that scares other southern states.
You know,

8
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.990
they just,
it's like the Texas of the south.
It's like,

9
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.640
um,
it's like the Ted Kennedy of the Kennedys.

10
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.120
What's another good example?
You know,
it's like the,
uh,

11
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.820
it's like the Kiwi or the birds.

12
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.590
It's just this little fucking state without winks,
you know?

13
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.800
Everybody's just hoping,

14
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.520
just hope of one day it's going to sprout.

15
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:07.610
It's fucking wings and something's going to happen.
I can be honest with you,

16
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:11.090
I don't know shit about Mississippi,
you know what I mean?

17
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.040
Although last night in Huntsville,
Alabama,
Bama,
Huntsville,
Huntsville,

18
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:20.570
Alabama,
you know,
everybody around here calls it comes Phil.
You know,
they do.

19
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.810
Of course they do because what do you do?
Yeah.

20
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:28.520
Don't be adult like the town next to our towns better than your town.

21
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.520
We have the exact same fucking trees and there's an invisible line,

22
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:35.030
but our trees are better.
Right?
Nobody likes nobody.

23
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.950
Everybody makes fun of the town next to him.

24
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.190
Everybody makes fun of the state next to him.

25
00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:41.990
Everybody makes fun of the country next to him.

26
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:45.740
It just keeps going and going and going and it ca are continence better in your

27
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:49.970
continent.
I like our ocean better than y'all Roshan writing.
Next thing you know,

28
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.170
he's shooting a couple of missiles.
Um,

29
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.260
so I'm on stage here in Huntsville.

30
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.800
You know what kills me was we were here for a day and a half and we got in the

31
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.170
night before and uh,

32
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.230
the same place that I performed at Dj Fontana was there the night before.

33
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.770
I swear to God and all,
a lot of the youngsters are going like,
oh my God,

34
00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:14.630
who's Dj Fontana?

35
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.310
<v 2>Or,
or,
or,
or,
or,
or</v>

36
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.670
<v 1>no,
not that kind of Dj.
He backed up.</v>

37
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.990
He was Elvis's drummer.
The real of this,
not the impersonator

38
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.880
Sukkot case.
You didn't know Elvis was,

39
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.270
I guess now he does like an Elvis tribute thing.

40
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.150
And I know a lot of you guys probably thinking,
that's fucking sad.
Well,

41
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:40.290
what's he supposed to do?

42
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.680
What are you supposed to do when you're a drummer and the guy that you back up

43
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.770
fucking dies at 42?
What are you going to do?
I mean,

44
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:52.880
you're going to live for another 30 fucking years.
You need some money,
right?

45
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.510
Well,
you goofball consult the lamb assault little blue.
You're going to do it.

46
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.120
Just find some guy that could do impersonation of him.

47
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.410
It's a tough gig being a drummer.
There's very few of them there.

48
00:03:04.411 --> 00:03:07.410
When the fucking lead singer either tells him to fuck off,

49
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.510
you know,
or they die.
Usually the drummer's fucked.

50
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.230
The lead guitarist can somehow come up with the band.

51
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.910
<v 3>Okay.</v>

52
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.040
<v 1>Now I'm trying to think.
Uh,
you know,</v>

53
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.320
I would say Dave Grohl,

54
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.400
Dave Grohl was the only guy I've ever seen come out of that thing,
you know?

55
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.870
<v 3>Okay.</v>

56
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.160
<v 1>And go on and be on top and actually be as big as his other band was.</v>

57
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.020
None of those larger Nevana fence.
No one will ever eclipse nirvana.

58
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.410
Nirvana,

59
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.270
put hair metal down where belonged religious.

60
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.270
They just made these songs and like start off loud and they were quiet or loud

61
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.840
or quiet and then they will allow,
will allow to then that was it.

62
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.730
That was the Song Bay on ramped.
Could you do,
do,
um,

63
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.200
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about a babbling here as always.

64
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.060
So many ways.
Dj Fontana was there.
I could gone and I could,
I could,

65
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.170
could've met the guy.
I don't know if I could have met the guy,

66
00:04:09.171 --> 00:04:11.360
but a fucking kills me.
I could at least see him play

67
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.000
a little bit.
Nice.
So anyways,

68
00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:21.080
I want stage last night in Huntsville,
Alabama,

69
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.840
Huntsville,
Alabama.
And um,
I,

70
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.770
I mentioned that I didn't believe in God and it got really kind of quiet and

71
00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:33.030
whatever,
and I was just like,
come on guy and I'm going drink it.
I'm just,

72
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.820
I just think I'm fertilizer when I'm dead.

73
00:04:34.821 --> 00:04:36.710
I just go into the ground and that's my job.

74
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.240
I didn't think there's a beautiful thing.

75
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.620
I go into the ground and I make the soil richer.
Right?

76
00:04:42.621 --> 00:04:47.300
Or maybe I become a fossil fuel for the next fucking thing that takes over the

77
00:04:47.301 --> 00:04:49.190
planet and it doesn't like the town next to him.

78
00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:51.520
It doesn't like to state and then so on and so forth.
Right.

79
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.373
<v 3>Okay.</v>

80
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.750
<v 1>So me in the crowd yells Ah,
better not say that and miss shipping.</v>

81
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.130
Oh God.
That was the creepiest thing.

82
00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:08.580
I think anybody's ever said better not say that Mississippi.

83
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.800
I was right then somebody had j Geils fucking cute up.
My blood runs cold.

84
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.470
Um,
I dunno.
I'm looking forward to going.
I believe it or not.

85
00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:21.270
I'm looking forward to going to Mississippi.

86
00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:24.540
I'm looking forward to interacting with those people and I'm looking forward to

87
00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:27.330
like a,
you know,
making a couple stereotypes go away.

88
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:29.700
Although I know there's going to be a lot that will reinforce it.

89
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.690
You know,
I know there's going to be a lot of,
stay on the main highways,

90
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.790
get off at like a burger king and then get the fuck back on the bus and get

91
00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:45.330
outta here.
I know that might be elements of that,
but you know,

92
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.650
I did look up some comedy clubs and I started to see who was playing there.

93
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.911
And uh,

94
00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:54.500
this is tour that's going around called the standing ovation toward that stars

95
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.520
some more,
some more.
Uh,

96
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.600
Tony Rock did a couple of dates aren't as Jay,
one of the funniest comics ever.

97
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.310
And um,

98
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.330
<v 3>okay.</v>

99
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.220
<v 1>You know,
they all came through here.
I think they did already.</v>

100
00:06:08.221 --> 00:06:11.100
I Dunno does that second right?
They came down here.
They had a good time.

101
00:06:11.101 --> 00:06:14.390
Cory Hoechlin came down here.
Um,

102
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.680
<v 3>okay.</v>

103
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.161
<v 1>It's weird.</v>

104
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:18.890
You would think that that would just be white comics coming down here with

105
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:21.160
Mississippi's fucking reputation.
Do you know?

106
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.080
All I found was as far as comics that I knew they were all black.

107
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.290
So anyways,
we'll see what happens
to all freckles.

108
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.333
I think I'll be fine.

109
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.740
I just don't need somebody with a fucking hardcore southern accent.
Go on a

110
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.250
tuck in if I don't say that Mississippi.
I uh,

111
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:45.050
I had another guy last night.

112
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.360
I'm getting deep in the south right now is what's going on.

113
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:48.650
Because last time I talked to you guys,

114
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:52.070
I think I was just rolling into Memphis and um,

115
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.760
<v 3>okay.</v>

116
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.140
<v 1>You know,
since then we did tree for it,
then we did New Orleans and uh,</v>

117
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.380
it was all good.
The Huntsville is the first time.
It was just like,
wow,

118
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.160
I'm really in the south here just with a couple of heckles because I was talking

119
00:07:05.161 --> 00:07:09.890
about how,
you know,
Oh,
I love sec football and how I wanted to,
uh,

120
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.940
come through it,
go to Alabama game and a Auburn game.

121
00:07:14.941 --> 00:07:17.610
And I would have loved to go to the Alabama Auburn game,
but it's,
you know,

122
00:07:17.611 --> 00:07:22.560
it's Thanksgiving weekend every year and there's no fucking way,
you know,

123
00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:25.470
you can ever make that game unless you live in Alabama.

124
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.700
You can't leave your wife,
you know,
if your wife had family,

125
00:07:29.701 --> 00:07:33.480
you just can't do it.
Just fucking carved up to Turkey,

126
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.340
you know,
give sacks and then jump on a fucking red eye to Alabama,

127
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.750
which is what I would have to do.
Um,
although it is a Saturday game,

128
00:07:42.751 --> 00:07:44.460
I might be able to get away with that.

129
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:46.340
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

130
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.130
<v 1>I might be able to get away with it.
But anyways,</v>

131
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.930
so I was just talking about,
uh,
I was saying how I liked both teams.

132
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:58.170
I was very being very impartial.
I was reside war Eagle Rove,

133
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.290
Todd's screaming.
It was fucking awesome.

134
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.760
And somehow I started talking about how fucking bad ass it is.

135
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.193
I said,
c'mon,

136
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:07.130
<v 3>yeah</v>

137
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:07.760
<v 1>damn fans.</v>

138
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.710
You got to admit that fucking eagle flying down from the top of the stadium

139
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:14.630
right on to the guy's arm.

140
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.020
He got to admit that's the shit he got admit.

141
00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:20.690
That's the shit some Alabama Fam said,

142
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:23.690
my favorite thing was when the eagle flew into the glass.

143
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:25.670
I guess it went into like the luxury boxes.

144
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.170
It just flew right into it and they will laughing,
you know?
And I'm like,
yeah,

145
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.340
mostly like,
oh,
give me a fucking break.
It happened one God damn time.
I go,
sir,

146
00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:37.940
how many fucking play glass windows if you walk in?

147
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:41.500
I walked into when your life and the guy was like,
no,

148
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.890
I have a walked in and here I go,
give me a fucking break.
I go,

149
00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:49.880
when often when Auburn returned that field goal against Alabama,

150
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:53.720
you probably walked through the side of your house and the place went fucking

151
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:54.410
nuts.

152
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:59.410
Auburn flipped out screaming at Bama fans like right.

153
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.410
And then when it all died down,
somebody in the back yelled out,

154
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.620
go back to Mississippi

155
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.380
was just like,
and the crowd went right.

156
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.480
It was really very high school.
And I was like,
wait a minute,

157
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.700
I haven't been to Mississippi yet.
You know?

158
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.730
And not only that,
I've been fucking on your side Sir,
I brought him down.
But,

159
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.190
but on your side,
the whole fucking show here I am talking about,
you know,

160
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:33.220
equal pay and how if you just make women make the same amount of money,

161
00:09:33.221 --> 00:09:37.370
these guys and you don't change anything else,
it's not fair.

162
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:38.770
<v 0>Okay.</v>

163
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.350
<v 1>It's just something I'm doing on my act somewhat.
Yeah.
Believe it or not,</v>

164
00:09:41.351 --> 00:09:45.880
that bit is actually empowering to women
after I brow beat him.

165
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.600
You know,
it's a fun job.
Anyways.
So this is the Monday morning podcast.

166
00:09:49.601 --> 00:09:53.350
I'd even say the date yet for April 27th the last Monday,

167
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:59.730
the last fucking Monday in April in 2015 they'll never be another Monday in

168
00:10:00.971 --> 00:10:05.830
April,
2015 you can say that you were there,
you were there,

169
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.930
you lived it,
you enjoy.
Did you put your hands in that soil and you felt it?

170
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.420
Um,
so what are you going to do?
Huh?
How did you do this month?

171
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.650
How'd you do this month?
We had good husband,

172
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.930
a good father,
a good mother.
How?

173
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.040
Even chowing down.

174
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:28.550
<v 0>Okay.</v>

175
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.530
<v 1>Mid doin.
All right.
What do you need to do?
You need to fat.
Shame yourself.</v>

176
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.340
Check in on yourself.
Just checking in on you on the last Monday.

177
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.600
Yeah.
I actually had somebody come up to me and said,
Geez,

178
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.620
bell thought she going to be a lot bigger.
I'm like,
what the fuck?

179
00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:44.100
I'm average height.
He's like,
no fat or the way you should on yourself.
I said,

180
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:46.650
dude,
I've been killing it at the gym.
My friend.

181
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:52.320
I go to the gym everyday.
It's just become a part of your life.

182
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.930
And if you don't pay a fee where you go to the gym everyday,
you can't.

183
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.370
I said,
you'll go to that cookie gym everyday.

184
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.330
I keep saying every month you go to gym every day.
Um,

185
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.420
so that made me feel all right.
And by the way,

186
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:14.100
to all this fat shaming I've been doing,
making people fat,
shame themselves.

187
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.091
Uh,

188
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:19.800
I had a couple come up to me and said that collectively they had lost like 80

189
00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:22.530
pounds.
I had a,

190
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:26.130
and then I've had like three or four different people say one guy had lost over

191
00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:30.570
a hundred pounds.
The other guy lost 80,
and I think there was a 60 in there.

192
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.220
So there you go.

193
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:33.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

194
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.020
<v 1>You Watch that fucking show the biggest loser where they screaming in your face,</v>

195
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.990
save money,
screaming your own face.

196
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.460
Go into the fucking bathroom,
take off your goddamn shirt.

197
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.240
See where you sit.
All right.

198
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.660
See where you're at in the rankings.

199
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.020
Be honest about your torso is looking at,
and I just look yourself in the mirror,

200
00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:59.330
huh?
Brow beat itself.

201
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.070
And then you end on a positive note right after you fucking what the fuck is

202
00:12:04.071 --> 00:12:08.720
going on,
right?
Then you bring it around in the end,
we're better than this,

203
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.530
right?
We get one life,
we get one body,
we're not fucking doing this,

204
00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:15.770
and you have your turn it around and all you gotta do is you just get a break.

205
00:12:15.771 --> 00:12:19.490
That fucking sugar salt thing.
When you wake up in the morning,

206
00:12:19.491 --> 00:12:23.240
that thing that's telling you to get an egg mcmuffin and things it telling you

207
00:12:23.241 --> 00:12:25.700
need fucking pancakes and all that shit.
You got no,
you know what?

208
00:12:25.701 --> 00:12:27.350
Shut the fuck up.
You override it.

209
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:31.250
You override those cravings and you go down and you just make yourself some

210
00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:34.040
fucking oatmeal,
nothing in it.

211
00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.290
You fucking slam that down with the banana.

212
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:41.750
Some berries assumption like that and then you fucking,
you level yourself off.

213
00:12:41.751 --> 00:12:46.550
What's that shit they give you when you're trying to get off heroin?

214
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.450
Methadone,
I don't know what the fuck it is.

215
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.210
OATMEAL is the food version of that.

216
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:54.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

217
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.020
<v 1>It's the food version of that.
By the way,
dude,
I,
I,</v>

218
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:01.610
I don't follow a couple of people on a Facebook and uh,

219
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.511
they just sent it,

220
00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:05.660
all of these fucking links to what the fuck they're doing to our food supply

221
00:13:05.661 --> 00:13:09.530
minutes.
Really?
God Damn scared.
It's really fucking scary,

222
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.190
you know?
I think that's how they're going to solve the population problem.

223
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.590
Next day I'm going to fucking turn the food in a poison.
There you go.

224
00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:22.550
If nobody's allowed to say what is in the food,
it's terrifying.

225
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.810
Fucking apples that don't turn brown.
What is wrong with people?

226
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.830
What the fuck is wrong with those God damn people that work in those,

227
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.310
those corporations.
I,

228
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.100
you know that type of debt type list psycho shit.
You know,

229
00:13:37.101 --> 00:13:39.740
you haven't played like your pick up boop,
a pickup hockey.

230
00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.530
If you just feel you ever just play with a sociopath,
he,
you know,

231
00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:45.770
you can play in for anything.
He just feel it.

232
00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.410
That fucking person as willing to do anything.

233
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.710
It's unreal.
Speaking of which,

234
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.770
how about those Boston Celtics?
What a,
what a great God damn sees.

235
00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:02.620
I've got to say that first before we get into the negativity of the game

236
00:14:02.621 --> 00:14:06.790
yesterday.
And God knows I don't fucking watch the Celtics.
You know,

237
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.200
God knows I don't fucking why I still love him.
But you know,

238
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.790
you only got time for so much,
right?
You read the real fucking hoop guy.
Oh,

239
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:18.610
you're a hockey guy.
I don't know Joe,
Joe Barton.

240
00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:22.270
It's the only guy I know that can talk intelligently and in depth about both.

241
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.710
I don't know how to fuck he does it.
Um,
but anyways,

242
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:27.910
the Celtics were in the playoffs.

243
00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:31.720
We made the seventh seed basically don't have any stars.

244
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:34.870
It was a hell of a coaching job by that guy that everybody's saying is a great

245
00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:37.540
coaching higher.
It's gonna repeat what other people say,

246
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.250
but actually watched the game.

247
00:14:39.251 --> 00:14:43.600
I've actually watched Ben Ben Watching Hoop because I'm on tour here with lie

248
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.330
hadn't VRC and um,

249
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.270
<v 0>okay.</v>

250
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.850
<v 1>You know,
it's just been,
uh,
you know,
I've been watching some of the stuff,</v>

251
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.920
they've been like good games I guess.
But,
uh,
I watched the,
uh,

252
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:57.730
a lot of that Celtics game yesterday.
Hope it's Celtic pride.

253
00:14:57.731 --> 00:15:00.850
We at least wouldn't get swept,
but,
um,

254
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.750
I got to tell you that fucking Kevin Love inches,
his shoulder,

255
00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:13.020
you know,
and then he turns around and he blames sweet,
innocent,

256
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:17.940
beautiful flowing hippie hair co Kelly,
was it Kelly?

257
00:15:17.941 --> 00:15:19.830
All Olynyk Avi say his name.

258
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.880
How dare he suggest that that was a dirty play.

259
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.560
You think that this is that I'm not being impartial here because of a Celtics

260
00:15:28.561 --> 00:15:32.400
fan.
Okay.
The ball goes up.
It's to rim.

261
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.320
Okay.
Now,
right out of the gate,
right out of the gate,

262
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:41.970
it's already the Cavaliers fault because if dad fucking jerk off foot took the

263
00:15:41.971 --> 00:15:43.350
shot,
hit the shot,

264
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.840
there was no way that Kelly would have been concerned about the left arm of,

265
00:15:48.841 --> 00:15:49.920
of Kevin Love

266
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:56.460
and felt the need to create a link within his body and then turn to the side and

267
00:15:56.461 --> 00:16:00.060
spoon with it.
Had the Cavaliers,

268
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.130
whoever the fuck it was.
I mean,
you get Lebron.

269
00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:07.110
Why didn't you say I'm going to dunk on everybody?
Not,
we've got to take a shot.

270
00:16:07.111 --> 00:16:10.770
Had to get fancy.
Right.
Rubbing it in.

271
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.210
I'm just fucking with you.
Um,
I don't even,
yeah,
I don't know anything about hoop.

272
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:20.010
Part of me wants to think that Kelly stinks cause he just looks like he stinks.

273
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.700
I don't know shit about who,
but I look at that guy and I look at it like that.

274
00:16:23.701 --> 00:16:28.470
That's not the guy I'm picking.
Um,
we just look like one of the,

275
00:16:28.471 --> 00:16:32.970
you don't like those spazzes you play with who just suck.
So they just,

276
00:16:32.971 --> 00:16:36.210
they're always fucking grabbing you.
You don't remind him.

277
00:16:36.211 --> 00:16:37.440
Remind me what I was a kid.

278
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.240
<v 3>Okay.</v>

279
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.830
<v 1>And then me and my brother fell out of a tree simultaneously because when you're</v>

280
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:45.400
trying to teach my other brother,
try and show me other brother,

281
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.820
it was as part of those,
this tree we used to climb up and um,

282
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.430
and you know,
the main trunk went up and then it's split.

283
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:55.770
<v 3>Okay.</v>

284
00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:00.300
<v 1>And as it went further up,
obviously the,
the gap got greater and greater.
Right.</v>

285
00:17:00.301 --> 00:17:02.820
Just like a horse legs.
Um,

286
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.240
there was the hort tree.
Um,

287
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.410
why couldn't the tree be giving birth?
Shut up,
Lee.
Uh,

288
00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.960
so we got up to a certain height and there was no branches on one side,

289
00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:23.070
one side of the trunk that went up until you got to a certain height.

290
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.630
And the only way to get over to the other side of the tree was you had to swing

291
00:17:27.631 --> 00:17:29.640
across on this dead branch.

292
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.960
So my older brothers swung cross and then I swung across and then my younger

293
00:17:34.961 --> 00:17:39.460
brother wouldn't fucking do it because it was a dead branch because you know,

294
00:17:39.461 --> 00:17:42.070
he's like,
it's a dead branch.
I'm not doing it.
We're like,
yeah,

295
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.950
we way more than you.
And we did it and he wouldn't do it.

296
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:50.100
So we go,
all right,
what if we both hang on this fucking together?

297
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.520
Then if it doesn't break,
then you'll do it.
And he's like,
yeah.

298
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.200
So we both go out and we hang on the branch.
My brothers on the inside,

299
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.760
he weighs more.
I'm on the outside,
we hang on it,
it doesn't break.
We go,

300
00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:05.100
all right,
come on man.
Let's go swing across the branch.

301
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.370
And he still wouldn't do it.
He goes,
do it one more time.

302
00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:11.010
So this time I'm thinking like,
wow,
it's the fucking dead branch.

303
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.380
I want to get on the inside.
So I got on the inside,

304
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:19.230
my older brother got on the outside that go and say,
look,
it's safe.

305
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.260
It's fucking safe,
crack.
And the thing just snapped.

306
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.030
So we weren't going down to the ground and I'm coordinated.

307
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.060
My older brother is not coordinated and I'm fucking getting ready to land

308
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.000
somewhat.
In a way we'll,
I'll get hurt the least.

309
00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.690
And as my brothers going down,
you know,

310
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.180
ass and back of the head first,

311
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:47.570
he reaches out and grabs my shoulder and pulls me into his uncoordinated

312
00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:53.310
nightmare.
We slammed down on the ground,
he got knocked out.

313
00:18:53.311 --> 00:18:54.630
I didn't,
I remember he got knocked out.

314
00:18:54.631 --> 00:18:58.940
He was laying face down on the fucking dirt and he was going like,
Eh,

315
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.620
and we will meet my other brothers.
Would you laugh and think?

316
00:19:02.621 --> 00:19:03.750
And he was fucking around.

317
00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.850
And my dad had just happened to pull up.
He's like,
Christ,
you know,

318
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.200
I'm not gonna name names.
So he goes,
what's he,

319
00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:14.490
what's he doing laying in the dirt?
He's like,
Oh,
for Christ sake.

320
00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:19.290
He said unconscious.
Right.
But I remember like,

321
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.750
he fucking reached out and grabbed,
I said,

322
00:19:21.751 --> 00:19:25.590
what the fuck are you grabbing on me for?
Cause he wasn't coordinated.

323
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.080
And that's how I feel,
uh,

324
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:32.090
that Kelly part of me thinks that he stinks so bad that that was actually him

325
00:19:33.691 --> 00:19:34.411
playing basketball.

326
00:19:34.411 --> 00:19:39.411
But my final verdict was it was dirty because I just never see anybody ever grab

327
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.860
somebody's arm like that in basketball.

328
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.060
And it was just weird.
Like,
what are you doing?

329
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.770
It was like he was carrying a giant Salami or some shit.

330
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.750
And then at the last second,
he liked fucking turned his body.
And I,

331
00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:58.080
you know,
I'm going to have to side with cavalier fans.

332
00:19:58.081 --> 00:20:02.010
I think that was a dirty fucking play.
And um,

333
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.500
you know,
I don't know.
It was good to see Parkinson's.

334
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:13.360
I don't know why we have a fucking traitor,
that guy,
you know,
I,
I,

335
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.690
I don't know.
Maybe now,
I don't know about hope.

336
00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:17.790
Maybe it was a good fucking move when,
when we traded him,

337
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:21.060
I didn't think that that was a good move,
but whatever.

338
00:20:21.061 --> 00:20:26.061
Congratulations to the fucking cavalier and uh,

339
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.750
congratulates the Celtics for a great,
uh,
a great season.
But,
um,

340
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.530
I really hope that wasn't a dirty play because that's the number one thing that

341
00:20:34.531 --> 00:20:38.010
I fucking hate.
I hate when he can't beat a team.
Then you just hurt their player.

342
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:43.011
And that just really affects the Cavaliers on the next level and just fans in

343
00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:48.720
general.
If you could've seen a totally healthy fucking cavalier take on a,

344
00:20:48.721 --> 00:20:51.000
I want to play the bucks of the bowl so it can be talking hope here.

345
00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:52.613
<v 4>MMM.</v>

346
00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.420
<v 1>Okay.
Now one of the best guys is out and you might have fucked the whole season.</v>

347
00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.960
You weren't going to win anyways.
Why would you do that?
I Dunno.

348
00:21:00.961 --> 00:21:03.160
I think it was a,
I think it was a dirty play.

349
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

350
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.440
<v 1>In fact,
it was so dirty.</v>

351
00:21:06.441 --> 00:21:10.400
I'm sure the Pittsburgh Penguins are calling Kelly Olynyk right now and asking

352
00:21:10.401 --> 00:21:11.240
me if she could skate

353
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.520
till you die.
I'll tell you right now,
Kelly,

354
00:21:17.521 --> 00:21:21.900
that is ring of honor level stuff here at the Pittsburgh Penguin Organization.

355
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:26.010
There's nothing we like better than someone who's willing to hurt somebody who's

356
00:21:26.011 --> 00:21:30.030
better than them on another team during a deciding game in the playoffs.

357
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.860
Um,
that should be under the Pittsburgh Penguin logo.

358
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.440
Good Lord.
Have they had some of the worst,

359
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.880
most fucking reprehensible human beings on their team forever?

360
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.930
Um,
or they've had some great ones.

361
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

362
00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.320
<v 1>I guess the smart,</v>

363
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:53.060
it's like they fucking draft the Mario Lemieux and then they go,
all right,

364
00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:55.910
who's going to try to end his career?
Let's get that guy to,

365
00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.550
let's just make sure this fucking piece of shit is blowing out knees on the

366
00:22:01.551 --> 00:22:05.010
other team and not blowing out our knees.
Maybe.
Maybe it's a fucking,
maybe.

367
00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:10.040
Maybe it's an intelligent move.
I don't know.
I don't pretend to know things.
Sure.

368
00:22:10.041 --> 00:22:13.100
You don't build.
Your whole fucking podcast is based on it.
I'll go fuck yourself.

369
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.013
<v 4>MMM.</v>

370
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:19.230
<v 1>Anyway,
so let's do a little reading out loud.
Shall We?
You guys ready for this?</v>

371
00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:24.270
If had your morning coffee,
you fucking drug addicts.
I can't get my day going.

372
00:22:24.271 --> 00:22:26.790
Is it like looking cuff?
You know,
that's why I never drank coffee.

373
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.900
Other than that,
the fact that it tastes like dirty water.
Um,

374
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.100
granted I never had it hot.
I used to drink my dad's when he went to work,

375
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:40.020
I take sips of it,
one of his fucking stone calls and uh,
you know,

376
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:43.500
that whole I'm going to be an adult and I just sip it was fucking disgusting.

377
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.320
I'm glad I never got into it.
People can't start the day.

378
00:22:46.321 --> 00:22:49.830
They just sit there with their brown coffee,
stained fucking tastes.

379
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:51.700
<v 0>Okay.</v>

380
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.540
<v 1>You know how many hours of your life,
how many days,
how many weeks a month,</v>

381
00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:01.110
a year life are you going to waste standing in a line at Starbucks?

382
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.860
Every time I go to a fucking airport,
the second they bring that thing up,

383
00:23:04.861 --> 00:23:08.310
these junkies are just standing there.
You know,

384
00:23:08.311 --> 00:23:11.150
like they're waiting for Springsteen tickets so they can do teach.

385
00:23:11.151 --> 00:23:15.030
I love tea with the fucking fucking score to have,
uh,

386
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.750
some whip cream
coming out there,

387
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:23.460
you know,
with like a heroin shake.
Uh Oh gee,
Bill,

388
00:23:23.461 --> 00:23:26.840

464
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.410
speaking of truck stops,

465
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:30.440
we actually stopped at one somewhere in fucking Alabama or Mississippi when we

466
00:28:30.511 --> 00:28:33.540
were coming up from,
uh,
uh,
New Orleans.

467
00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:37.590
Do you know what it means to Miss New Orleans?

468
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.050
That's where my baby go goes.

469
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.070
She gives me a hand job.

470
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:49.490
She used humidity for a lubricant when she jerked my Dick in the middle of

471
00:28:50.461 --> 00:28:55.320
Jello.
Pulling it out of my CEUs is stuck a suit.

472
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.300
Um,
but your day on decker way and keeping moving.

473
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.440
Sorry.
Uh,
yeah,

474
00:29:04.441 --> 00:29:07.800
we stopped off at a truck stop and uh,
you know,

475
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.610
I had to relieve myself not once,
but twice,
if you know what I mean.

476
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.640
And I go into this fucking bathroom and there's some trucker already unit in

477
00:29:16.741 --> 00:29:19.770
there dropping a deuce and I'm already laughing my ass off cause I'm like,

478
00:29:19.771 --> 00:29:23.040
I'm only one toilet away and I'm on a bus,
what am I going to do?

479
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:24.840
I got to go and I'm like,

480
00:29:24.841 --> 00:29:29.220
am I really going to take a dump next to a fucking trucker in Mississippi at a

481
00:29:29.221 --> 00:29:30.450
truck stop?
I got to do it.

482
00:29:30.451 --> 00:29:33.810
And then all of a sudden like every truck trucker from here to Tuscaloosa

483
00:29:33.811 --> 00:29:36.990
fucking came in there and I had to leave.
It's like I can't fucking do it.

484
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:40.350
And I kept trying to walk in there,
you know,
when there was nobody there,

485
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:43.780
there was always five truckers and that original truck or never moved.

486
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.020
He was just sitting there just,

487
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.160
I dunno shitting his brains out or couldn't,
oh my God,

488
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:55.230
he had these awful white Seinfeld sneakers that were all fucking creased up and

489
00:29:55.231 --> 00:29:57.520
dirty dad jeans.

490
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.690
It was one of the fucking low points of my standup career,

491
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.730
although I was laughing my ass off.

492
00:30:03.731 --> 00:30:07.090
Cause VRC goes in there and he comes back out and I just started laughing.
He,

493
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:12.130
he says going to do it.
I can't,
I can't,
I need,
I can't.
Um,

494
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:18.670
it's fucking,
it's not all luxury being on a tour bus,

495
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:21.490
just put it that way.
But um,
oh I didn't mention,
you know,

496
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.040
a lot of people gave me shit cause when I would go to these cool places,

497
00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:26.530
I never mentioned what they are cause I don't want to ruin them for the locals

498
00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:29.940
but fuck it.
I'll switch that up.
You know,
cause people are going to do,

499
00:30:29.941 --> 00:30:33.460
you don't realize how arrogant you are that you feel like,
you know,

500
00:30:33.461 --> 00:30:36.640
you just mentioning it on your podcast is going to ruin those places.
All right,

501
00:30:36.641 --> 00:30:40.000
so let's see.
So we went to New Orleans,

502
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.450
New Orleans and um,

503
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:48.160
I played this amazing theater that I could not pronounce a beginning was an s

504
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.660
and a only know is Bob Dylan was going to be performing in the next week,

505
00:30:52.661 --> 00:30:56.920
which is a pretty big fucking thrilled be performing on a stage that he performs

506
00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:58.960
on that because that's what he's selling these days.

507
00:30:58.961 --> 00:31:01.990
He just loves this place so much.
Um,

508
00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:08.890
and it was just an amazing fucking show and it's such a great time.

509
00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:13.480
And then we had a couple of days off,
so the next night,
you know,

510
00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.850
he,
this is the deal with New Orleans.

511
00:31:15.851 --> 00:31:20.200
If you go to New Orleans and he just go to Bourbon Street,
if you're in your 20s,

512
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:23.680
you probably enjoy,
if you're in your thirties or older,
you're going to be like,

513
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.830
not only is this fucking an absolute shit show,

514
00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:31.840
this is one of the worst cities in the country.
It's dirty,
it's evil,

515
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.430
it's dirty and evil,
whatever.
Sorry,
I needed a third one.
However,

516
00:31:36.431 --> 00:31:40.840
if you get the fuck out of there and you go in,
you go north of the Goddamn city,

517
00:31:40.841 --> 00:31:43.460
whatever fucking direction it is,
um,

518
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:46.900
you're going to see those beautiful houses and you will literally go from going

519
00:31:46.901 --> 00:31:50.200
like this fucking places.
Awful too.
Wow.
I could live here.

520
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.800
So we went to a place called a commander's palace for some of the best seafood

521
00:31:55.991 --> 00:32:00.070
I've ever fucking had.
A,
if you go into New Orleans,
I'm telling you right now,

522
00:32:00.071 --> 00:32:04.660
take your wife over there.
Okay.
Watch your,
shut the fuck up.
No,
sorry.

523
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.360
That just for some reason was thinking Harvey cartel,
when he tests,

524
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.420
he has to take the gun and smash it on the nose.
Once you shut the fuck up,

525
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.750
let's go get a Taco.
Um,

526
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.760
and then afterwards we wanted to go smoke a cigar and,
um,
you know,

527
00:32:18.761 --> 00:32:22.090
it's like I knew some cigar bars down around the French quarter and I was like,

528
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:24.220
I don't want to go down there.
You know,

529
00:32:24.221 --> 00:32:28.000
you go down there and it's just a bunch of drunks.
It's just,

530
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.580
it's like the Jerry Springer show,
you know,

531
00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:34.210
the Jerry Springer show just has the worst representation of every race,

532
00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:37.720
every demographic.
When you go down to Bourbon Street,
that's what you have.

533
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.760
You have the worst from every state.

534
00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.820
And then you have the worst people in New Orleans hovering around them,

535
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:48.320
trying to take advantage of them in any way possible self.
I was like,

536
00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:52.170
there's gotta be something better.
So I waited,
was the shit.
Um,

537
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:56.180
and he told us about this place called a dose Jeff Ace dose,

538
00:32:56.181 --> 00:33:01.130
like a Spanish for two,
d,

539
00:33:01.131 --> 00:33:03.620
O s e and then Jeff A's,
j e f,
f,

540
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:08.650
e as they had these great cigars and then they had this live music that we

541
00:33:09.741 --> 00:33:11.390
listened to.
Oh,
did I already tell you this?

542
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.140
I think I mentioned it on the podcast last week.
I'm sorry dude,

543
00:33:15.141 --> 00:33:17.420
I don't even know where the fuck around right now.
Um,

544
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:23.030
but we just had the best,
I'll even say it again.
We had the best time,
best food,

545
00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:27.680
best place I've been to as far as where to eat in New Orleans and uh,

546
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.860
just the coolest fucking bar.
This unbelievable live music.

547
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:36.080
And I'm telling you,
if you,
if you do that alone,

548
00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:40.070
you'll fucking,
you want to go to New Orleans every goddamn year.
Um,

549
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.450
so anyways,
having said all of that,

550
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:50.230
let's congratulate everybody who got out of the first round in the NHL playoffs.

551
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.710
All right.
I Dunno what's going on with Detroit and Tampa Bay.

552
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.540
I haven't been able to keep up with that.
Congratulations to the Minnesota wild,

553
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:05.570
you know,
great series for you guys and my condolences to St Louis Blues fans.

554
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.430
I mean I'd,
I know what the fuck he got to do.

555
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.940
What are the St Louis Blues got to fucking do to get out of the first round of

556
00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:13.970
the fucking playoffs?
That was the team.
I was like,

557
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:16.010
oh this is the guys I'm gonna root for these fucking guys.

558
00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:21.220
I thought they were going to make a run at least go a couple of series.

559
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.200
Fucking brutal.

560
00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:29.270
What did St Louis fucking blues fans due to the hockey gods?

561
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:35.520
They really are like the fucking Los Angeles Clippers of,

562
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:39.830
of hockey.
It's just,
they're just never going to get out of the first round.

563
00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.430
I don't know shit about who,
but I'll tell you right now when the fucking,

564
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.510
the Spurs won game two,
that series was over.
It's over.

565
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.840
They're going to turn on every fucking thing that they know about how to win a

566
00:34:50.841 --> 00:34:54.380
championship and it's going to be done because the clippers,
they don't have it.

567
00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:58.490
And I can say that cause I don't want troop.
So congratulations to them.

568
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.120
Congratulations to the ranges.

569
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:07.040
I know the ducks won Calgary flames.
Um,

570
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:11.840
who else is out there that I'm forgetting?
There's gotta be one other series.
Oh,

571
00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:16.400
the Blackhawks.
Blackhawks won.
So who do you like out there?

572
00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.990
Black Hawks.
Flames,
ducks,
Minnesota.
I mean,

573
00:35:20.991 --> 00:35:22.520
he got to go with the experience,
right?

574
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:26.360
You gotta go with the Blackhawks even though they fucking every fucking other

575
00:35:26.361 --> 00:35:29.420
period they got a different guy in there.
Crawford than the other guy.

576
00:35:29.421 --> 00:35:33.410
Then Crawford and the other guy and then the other guy and then Crawford think

577
00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:36.260
are off and then the other guy.
But somehow they made it work.

578
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:40.590
Somehow they made it work.
So,
um,
who am I rooting for out the I'll,

579
00:35:40.591 --> 00:35:44.860
I'll root for the Calgary flames and want to root for them because in 1989,

580
00:35:44.861 --> 00:35:49.240
they beat the Montreal Canadiens back when the Bruins could never beat them.
Um,

581
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.660
so that was nice to watch it.
So I've always liked Calgary because of that.

582
00:35:52.661 --> 00:35:53.650
And then Laney,
Mcdonald's,

583
00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:56.740
they got the fucking red headed guy with the psycho mustache.
C'Mon dude.

584
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:58.060
It was fucking killing it.

585
00:35:58.061 --> 00:36:01.180
The guy looked like he just stepped out of a fucking mind shaft and then he'd go

586
00:36:01.181 --> 00:36:05.590
in and score God damn goal.
Right.
Then he'd smile like it was Christmas.

587
00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.000
How could you not love that guy?

588
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:09.870
<v 4>Right.
Um,</v>

589
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:15.830
<v 1>it's been a lot of great fucking Calgary flames over the fucking years.</v>

590
00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:19.730
Our McGuinness dirt,
he's got the hat is fucking shot and hockey.

591
00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:25.100
It's like fucking 200 miles an hour.
Right.

592
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:29.690
All right,
sorry.
And let's see over in these two else.

593
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:33.810
Who else wants it?
Just feel like I'm forgetting to can grow all.
Let's see.
The,

594
00:36:33.811 --> 00:36:36.890
the,
the,
the fucking,
we got a game seven dawn,

595
00:36:36.891 --> 00:36:41.891
we between the islanders and the capitals ranges.

596
00:36:42.231 --> 00:36:45.470
One,
I don't know what happened with Detroit.

597
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:46.800
<v 4>Okay.</v>

598
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.570
<v 1>And uh,
Tampa Bay.
But uh,
like I said,</v>

599
00:36:50.571 --> 00:36:53.490
congratulations to everybody and that wraps up my hockey talk.

600
00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:59.860
I'm fucking with you.
You silly sock.
Frenchies you fucking assholes.

601
00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:02.140
You fucking assholes.

602
00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.890
Almost got pushed to a game seven after going up three zero.

603
00:37:05.891 --> 00:37:09.520
And I didn't write why didn't talk one line is shit cause I didn't want to jinx

604
00:37:09.521 --> 00:37:12.760
it all was I hope.
And that you guys went down that way,

605
00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.700
but then part of me wasn't cause the Bruins did that and then the next year we

606
00:37:15.701 --> 00:37:18.520
want a cup and I don't ever want you guys to win another one,

607
00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:23.940
but I have to begrudgingly grudgingly admit you got your best shot and years

608
00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.530
this year.
You do.
Although I've got to tell you,

609
00:37:26.531 --> 00:37:30.580
you're very easily could have lost that series if Ottawa pulled out two more

610
00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:33.200
games because then they would have won it four to two

611
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:38.720
<v 5>[inaudible] you got a really hard time bringing it series home.</v>

612
00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:43.900
<v 1>Um,
no,
they were really close games and uh,
Ottawa played like fucking,</v>

613
00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.790
you know,
they played great.

614
00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.960
It wasn't great series and a fucking crushed me to watch Montreal when he should

615
00:37:49.961 --> 00:37:52.570
be happy.
Montreal fence.
I'm a Bruins fans and uh,

616
00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:56.140
it really hurt me that you guys want and I actually follow you guys.

617
00:37:56.410 --> 00:38:01.170
I have the Montreal Canadian App on my phone and always goes five minutes to

618
00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.640
gain tank.
Gets your snacks ready.
Ah,

619
00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:08.230
it's so fucking awful kitschy snacks ready put on you.

620
00:38:08.231 --> 00:38:11.470
Silly suck,
right?
Kits,
your snacks ready.

621
00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.270
It gives me chills every time I read it.
But it makes me hate him more.

622
00:38:16.271 --> 00:38:18.850
And I love it.
It's part of the game at this part of sports.

623
00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.820
He got to have that team that you fucking hate.
You know,
sad.

624
00:38:21.821 --> 00:38:24.820
I would be of Montreal Canadiens somehow that whole franchise folded,

625
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.710
I would be at a loss.
Who Do I hate the fucking saved.
Um,

626
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:36.050
so anyways,
uh,
I think they got their best chance.
I mean,

627
00:38:36.051 --> 00:38:38.030
all the really big powerhouse,

628
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:44.200
powerhouse Western teams have kind of been dethroned the La Kings did make it

629
00:38:45.171 --> 00:38:47.360
even though I thought they did,
they didn't even make the playoffs.

630
00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.780
Vancouver's is shallow.
What?
They used to be there out of it.

631
00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.800
St Louis looked like they were stacked to me,
you know,

632
00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.800
and a bunch of fucking goal scores.
They're out of it.
I mean,

633
00:39:00.801 --> 00:39:02.510
Minnesota is in,
it's so the ducks,

634
00:39:02.511 --> 00:39:06.350
the ducks sex I think could surprise to people,
but um,

635
00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.870
they just don't have like that.
Like,
you know,

636
00:39:08.871 --> 00:39:12.500
like last year when the fucking Black Hawks and kings will come and you like,

637
00:39:12.501 --> 00:39:15.560
all right,
whoever wins this fucking war is taking the cup.
You just know it.

638
00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.860
You just knew it.
I'd not feel that.
And I've,
you know,

639
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.460
Black Hawks and under,
the longer you hang in there,

640
00:39:22.461 --> 00:39:23.870
you get a little longer in the tooth.

641
00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.810
I do feel that the Black Hawks are going to win it again.

642
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.133
<v 4>MMM.</v>

643
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:32.800
<v 1>I Dunno,
I'm going to state the obvious.</v>

644
00:39:32.801 --> 00:39:35.200
It's either Black Hawks ranges are Canadians,

645
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:40.240
chief bill way to go out on a fucking limb.
And then I,
then I hedge my bet going,

646
00:39:40.241 --> 00:39:42.040
but I'll tell you the ducks,
they could surprise.

647
00:39:42.041 --> 00:39:47.041
Some people see that I basically picked air almost everybody that's still left.

648
00:39:47.531 --> 00:39:50.230
So then I can be like,
dude,
what did I say?

649
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.730
What did I say on the last Monday of fucking April?

650
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:59.460
Do you guys want it in June?
I said this shit back in April.
I said it,

651
00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.940
I should be coaching a team.

652
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:06.960
I'm the fucking dose that talks about shit like that.
Um,
20 years,

653
00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.890
congratulations to Canadians.
You know,
you know,
you know,

654
00:40:08.891 --> 00:40:12.880
my hatred for you really isn't to that level.
I do wish that you never win one,

655
00:40:12.881 --> 00:40:17.050
but I also find it funny to hate like that.
Right.

656
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.940
Okay.
Anyways,

657
00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.430
let me know what I have left here to talk about before I get into the goddamn

658
00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:26.740
questions.
I do have to get back.
I have to get on a bus.

659
00:40:26.741 --> 00:40:30.310
That's what I'm up fucking early and ride on my way over to Jackson.

660
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:34.680
You better not say that shit.
And Jack,
he better not to say that.
And Mississippi,

661
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.730
Jesus Christ,
they made me want to go home.
Um,
so anyways,

662
00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:44.620
what am I going to do in Jackson,
Mississippi?
I have no idea.
Um,
but I,
I,

663
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.200
I am going to,
uh,
try to hang out with some locals,

664
00:40:47.201 --> 00:40:50.380
maybe grab a beer with somebody and um,

665
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.500
then we're going to head down to mobile,

666
00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:58.180
Alabama and I'm going to give myself a self guided tour of the USS Alabama,

667
00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.190
or maybe at least at sub,

668
00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.850
and then the tour's winding down.

669
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.870
All we have left is Kentucky and fucking,
uh,
Evansville.

670
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:11.380
And then we're on to the Kentucky Derby.
Um,
to,

671
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.270
you know what's hilarious is this whole trip,

672
00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:16.180
we've all been like picking out what the fuck we're going to be wearing to the

673
00:41:16.181 --> 00:41:19.120
derby.
Fucking Versie was looking at,

674
00:41:19.121 --> 00:41:22.090
he wanted to keep by these white shoes with this white belt,

675
00:41:22.091 --> 00:41:24.880
like fucking herb Tarlek and I'm telling,
I was like,
dude,
you gotta do it.

676
00:41:24.881 --> 00:41:27.340
You got to dress like a complete jerk off and get a fucking hat.
That's,

677
00:41:27.341 --> 00:41:30.880
that's what it is.
And a Oh Billy red face here.

678
00:41:30.881 --> 00:41:34.640
I actually a I learned how to tie a bow tie,
you know,

679
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:42.050
accomplishment.
Um,
so we're fucking getting excited about that.

680
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:42.973
And um,

681
00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:48.350
I guess the racist start at 10 30 in the morning and then they go all the way to

682
00:41:48.351 --> 00:41:51.470
like the race,
which starts at like six 20 or something.

683
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:55.130
So experienced drinkers,
no.
All right.

684
00:41:55.131 --> 00:41:57.200
I need to pace myself.

685
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:58.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

686
00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.960
<v 1>So racist start at 10 30 in the morning.</v>

687
00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:05.190
Obviously you start with a screwdriver or a bloody Mary.

688
00:42:05.191 --> 00:42:08.550
I just like a screwdriver because I feel like at least I'm fighting off a cold

689
00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:13.110
while I'm fucking kicking my liver.
All right.
Um,

690
00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:16.550
anyways,
I'll do it.
Speaking of which,

691
00:42:16.551 --> 00:42:18.330
I didn't know what he wants right after that game,

692
00:42:18.331 --> 00:42:22.080
we're going to leave and then we're going to go watch the fucking Mayweather

693
00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.680
Pacquiao fight.
And um,
I dunno,

694
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.930
I think the safe bet is to be like,
oh,

695
00:42:27.931 --> 00:42:31.200
fucking Mayweather's going to win a decision on points.

696
00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:36.390
So then they have the rematch.
That's the safe thing.
What do I want to see?

697
00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.450
I want to see somebody knock out the other guy.

698
00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.700
It's kind of hard to root for that when,

699
00:42:42.701 --> 00:42:46.180
you know they're getting a concussion and they getting fucking brain damage.
Um,

700
00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:50.530
and it's also hard to root against Mayweather because of his record.

701
00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.940
I'd like to see that guy get to 50,
you know,
but uh,
you know,

702
00:42:54.941 --> 00:42:59.770
it's every time you watch like a fucking up when they hype a prize fight.
Yeah.

703
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:03.660
Once you see a guy that you think you don't like it,

704
00:43:03.661 --> 00:43:06.330
then they just show his backstory and just like,
you can't be against them.

705
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:12.240
You know,
I saw this one on,
on,
on Mayweather
and uh,

706
00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:17.910
you know,
he's showing me who he was 14,
he jumped on a boat and went to Malaysia.

707
00:43:17.911 --> 00:43:22.530
Did speak the language of these other fighters.
It was like crying and stuff,

708
00:43:22.531 --> 00:43:23.361
leaving his family.

709
00:43:23.361 --> 00:43:26.610
He wanted to go back and then his best friend got killed in the ring and then he

710
00:43:26.611 --> 00:43:31.470
had to go in right after him was fucking awful man slacking off.

711
00:43:31.471 --> 00:43:34.140
So He's been through all of that shit right then may,

712
00:43:34.141 --> 00:43:37.770
whether it comes from that dysfunctional family,
you know what I mean?

713
00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:40.830
I don't fucking know.
I love her.

714
00:43:40.831 --> 00:43:43.540
They're bringing up all this shit that the guy did in this past may,

715
00:43:43.541 --> 00:43:46.020
whether we went to fucking jail for it and all that type of shit,

716
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.840
and it's just like ESPN,
this such fucking scumbags.

717
00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:55.020
Like why?
Why are you bringing up his domestic violence now?

718
00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:58.530
Because you give a shit about that or because you're out of shit to talk about.

719
00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:03.000
It's so fucking dumb.
And then you're going to bring that up.

720
00:44:03.001 --> 00:44:05.040
Like you're really doing some investigating,
reporting.

721
00:44:05.041 --> 00:44:08.540
Like you really give a fuck about battered women and then he all you can.

722
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:13.550
Then you go right back to hype and the fight fight all the fucking century at

723
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.980
just fucking drives me up the Goddamn wall.
You know what I mean?

724
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:20.160
Then also these fucking groups,
you know,

725
00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.740
that are trying to stop women from being battered.

726
00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.980
They wait to this big fight to jump on the guy when he's promoting,

727
00:44:25.981 --> 00:44:27.750
they come out of the woodwork.
It's like,

728
00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:31.530
does it not matter that he battered women when he's not training for fight?

729
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:37.710
Oh fuck it.
This like watching somebody campaign for president.
Um,

730
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:42.810
it's like a strategic when you have to give a fuck and when you bring it up.

731
00:44:42.811 --> 00:44:45.860
Well,
because if a lot,
if we give a fuck now,
which is pissing into the wind,

732
00:44:45.861 --> 00:44:47.010
cause nobody's going to listen.

733
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.610
We got to wait to this guy's promoting something and then we strike.

734
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:54.710
Then we say we care.
Um,
anyways,

735
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:58.290
I don't fucking know.
I'm just hoping it's going to be a,
a,
a,

736
00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.200
that'd be a great fight.
I don't want to see me whether just fucking,
you know,

737
00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:05.190
slipping every punch for another 12 rounds and as I stare at the fucking paper

738
00:45:05.191 --> 00:45:08.970
view,
money going down the goddamn drain,
I love the fact that nobody can hit him,

739
00:45:08.971 --> 00:45:11.200
but at some point it's like,
you want to see a fight?

740
00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:13.443
<v 4>Okay,</v>

741
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:17.060
<v 1>I just want to see somebody get hit.
Um,
all right.</v>

742
00:45:17.061 --> 00:45:21.680
This person wrote this fucking book called behind,
uh,
called uh,

743
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:23.640
<v 4>okay.</v>

744
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.530
<v 1>It's coming out.
It's called a,
what the fuck is,</v>

745
00:45:26.531 --> 00:45:31.380
it's called Clinton cash and it's basically going to out the Clintons of how

746
00:45:31.381 --> 00:45:34.800
they got their cash,
which is the funniest fucking thing ever.
To me.

747
00:45:34.801 --> 00:45:38.640
It's like you could write Obama cash,
Bush cash,

748
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.700
anything but fucking Johnny Cash show.

749
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:45.150
Gvh You could do that about any fucking politician out here.

750
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.430
Where do they get the cash?
It's all salesy.

751
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:50.480
This is why I don't fucking get into this shit.
I can't do,

752
00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:51.330
I just don't understand.

753
00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:56.331
People who just sit around and they blame the problems of this country on

754
00:45:56.521 --> 00:46:00.390
conservatives,
or they blame the problems of this country on the liberals,

755
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.910
the liberal agenda,
the corporate agenda.
It's like,

756
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:06.780
how about politicians don't make any fucking money at all yet.

757
00:46:06.781 --> 00:46:09.690
They're all multimillionaires.
How about that?

758
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:15.030
How about this set up to be bribed?
Stop with this fucking horse shit of like,

759
00:46:15.031 --> 00:46:17.910
you know,
uh,
there are public servants do.

760
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:20.940
They did this whole thing on senator senators make a couple hundred grand a
year,

761
00:46:20.941 --> 00:46:23.070
which is nothing to sneeze and sneeze at.

762
00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:27.780
But like the amount of them that are multi,
multi,
multi fucking millionaires,

763
00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:30.090
they all get heads up on land deals.

764
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:33.480
They had their own private businesses that just go through the fucking roof.

765
00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.690
It's the biggest fucking scam I've ever seen in my life.

766
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:37.800
And then if you bring it up,

767
00:46:37.801 --> 00:46:40.860
everybody calls you conspiracy theorist and then they just sit there just

768
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:45.510
fucking blaming the other party.
This is adults that do that shit.

769
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:48.310
So I dunno what I,
I was,

770
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:51.600
I would recommend reading Clinton cash and just know that you could fucking

771
00:46:51.601 --> 00:46:53.400
write that probably about every politician,

772
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:58.890
even Jimmy Carter who seemed to be like the best,
at least human being.

773
00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:00.943
<v 4>MMM.</v>

774
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:02.071
<v 1>Jimmy Carter.</v>

775
00:47:02.071 --> 00:47:05.850
What I loved about that guy was he handled the fucking hostage situation without

776
00:47:05.851 --> 00:47:10.800
getting into a war with Iran.
We got everybody back.
You know

777
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:16.320
the one tragedy was when we tried to rescue them,
that midair collisions.

778
00:47:16.321 --> 00:47:21.180
So some American servicemen did die,
all right?

779
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:26.640
But it was like single digits as opposed to what the fuck we got going on over

780
00:47:26.641 --> 00:47:28.920
there now.
Which,
and you're not going to solve it.

781
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:34.540
Do you think you could have a war that would make Bruins and Montreal Canadien

782
00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:38.650
fans like each other?
Yeah.
What?
We're going to hate each other,

783
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:40.870
hate each other back then.
We hate each other.
Now.

784
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:42.280
We're going to hate each other for fucking ever.

785
00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:46.850
And that's how it works over there in the Middle East.
All right.
I Dunno,

786
00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:50.130
I'm in way over my head here.
I'm just going to shut the fuck up.
Let's,
uh,

787
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.470
do a little more advertising here.
Then I'll read some.
Uh,

788
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.580
I'm gonna read some fucking average,
um,

789
00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:01.270

794
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:19.120
You have an itch behind your ear and that just makes you cough.

795

I know a razor that costs a few bucks delivery.

798
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:31.510

799
00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.800
But you really have to try the razors to dollar shave club.com razors.

802
00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.720
a couple of dollars.
You'd have to be an idiot to keep overpaying.

803
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.370
You'd have to be,
why would you do that?

804
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:54.010
And then they get their fucking locked behind that little cage thing.

805
00:48:54.011 --> 00:48:56.680
You got to wait for the old guy who should have retired,

806
00:48:56.681 --> 00:48:59.740
but there was no money leftover because of those dicks on Wall Street.

807
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:04.930
So now he's got to be security at a cvs.
Yes,

808
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:08.530
I did just do air quotes.
Um,
anyways,
don't pay triple the price.

809
00:49:08.531 --> 00:49:11.590
When you can get fantastic a shaved delivered for a couple of bucks,

810
00:49:11.591 --> 00:49:12.370
you'd have to be an idiot.

00:51:47.991 --> 00:51:48.651
questions,

853
00:51:48.651 --> 00:51:53.410
anything you want me to go off on a just fuck around on Thursdays and a,

854
00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:56.310
if you'd like to email the Monday morning podcast.
Um,

855
00:51:56.330 --> 00:52:00.020
it's bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com.
All right,

856
00:52:00.021 --> 00:52:03.320
let's get into the questions here for the week.
Um,

857
00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:06.980
so god trailer,
hey bill promise.

858
00:52:06.981 --> 00:52:11.600
I'm not trying to bust your ball a repeat.
This is not an attack.

859
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:12.770
Before the tour started,

860
00:52:12.771 --> 00:52:16.250
you said you weren't going to mention the names of food places and cool spots to

861
00:52:16.251 --> 00:52:17.084
visit.
Uh,

862
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:20.780
Rita called you out on not supporting local businesses and you justified your

863
00:52:20.781 --> 00:52:24.320
position on the Thursday afternoon podcast just before Friday.

864
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:27.680
You talked about the cool cigar lounge built out of a trailer.

865
00:52:27.681 --> 00:52:31.760
Just curious if this is an exemption or a harmless contradiction.
I repeat.

866
00:52:31.761 --> 00:52:35.180
I'm not being a dick.
Thank you.
Know,
I actually thought about what that guy said.

867
00:52:35.181 --> 00:52:39.290
If you've been listening to the podcast,
I actually,
uh,
mentioned the name.

868
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:40.483
Um,

869
00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:45.640
but also it's the reason why I mentioned that guy was he went out of his fucking

870
00:52:45.651 --> 00:52:50.651
way and he had like a 6,000 square foot fucking restaurant that he had to fill.

871
00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:55.340
This wasn't some little mom and pop place in the corner that's been there

872
00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:59.420
forever.
It was a brand new God damn business.
The guy totally hooked us up.

873
00:52:59.421 --> 00:53:03.530
He kept it open after hours and all that stuff.
So I felt like I owed it to them,

874
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:04.850
but I gotta be honest with you,

875
00:53:04.851 --> 00:53:07.940
as much as I gave that guy shit for giving me Shit,
you know,

876
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.460
I'm one of those guys,
he give me shit if,
if you're right,

877
00:53:10.461 --> 00:53:11.420
I'll give you shit back.

878
00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.120
And then it rolls around my big head for a couple of days and then I'll come

879
00:53:14.121 --> 00:53:16.370
back and be like,
all right,
you're right.
You know?

880
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.990
I like to think that that makes me a fucking somewhat of an enlightened human

881
00:53:20.991 --> 00:53:24.170
being.
If I was really enlightened in the moment,
I could stop.

882
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.260
Daddy would stop insulting.
It'd be like,
wait,
wait.
You know what?
You're right.

883
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.350
You're right.
That's a big moment in your life.

884
00:53:31.351 --> 00:53:36.060
Especially if you're an angry cunt like me to be able to stop mid argument and

885
00:53:36.061 --> 00:53:39.540
just be like,
you know what?
You're right.
You're right.
I'm sorry.

886
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:44.550
And then what's funny is it ends the argument and then you also get to see the

887
00:53:44.551 --> 00:53:48.240
other person like frustrated because they want to keep yelling at you and now

888
00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:52.770
they can't,
you know?
And then if they keep yelling,
then you get to be like,
dude,

889
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:55.440
I said,
I said,
you were right.
What the Fuck Modi you want from me?

890
00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:58.740
And then they're actually the deck at that point.
You know,

891
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:03.480
it's a great thing to do.
All right.
Slumlord retirement bill,

892
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:07.380
I keep hearing you mentioned becoming a slum Lord and then retiring.

893
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:10.860
I'm actually doing something very similar,
but I'm not a slumlord dude.

894
00:54:10.861 --> 00:54:14.960
I would never be a slum Lord.
I would never fuck people over.
Uh,
he,

895
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:20.040
he said I buy properties and low income area in,
in all cash,
fixed them up,

896
00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:24.120
refinance them,
and then rent them out.
Every time I've done this,

897
00:54:24.121 --> 00:54:26.430
I've gotten more cash out than I put in.

898
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.670
And the mortgage is always way less than the rent.
It's unbelievable.

899
00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.580
But my thing is if you're in low income areas,

900
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.450
they're the first ones that get fired during a bad economy.

901
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:41.670
You know?
Then what do you do?
I couldn't,
I couldn't,

902
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:44.730
I could not fucking evict somebody unless they were a complete piece of shit.

903
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.480
I don't know if I have the heart for this because I'd actually like to buy

904
00:54:48.481 --> 00:54:51.720
something in a low income area of fix it up and give somebody a nice place,

905
00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:55.380
a nice safe fucking place to live,
you know,

906
00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:56.940
that wasn't a pressing.

907
00:54:56.941 --> 00:55:00.090
Maybe give them hope and the kids try harder in school and they get the fuck out

908
00:55:00.091 --> 00:55:03.570
of there.
That's what I'd like to do.
See,
I don't have the heart for this anyway.

909
00:55:03.571 --> 00:55:06.480
So what was supposed to do is just be like,
yeah,
it looks fine.

910
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:11.400
Let people live in squalor,
have one toilet on each floor,
you know,

911
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:16.500
dark,
moist areas.
Bring back tuberculosis.

912
00:55:16.501 --> 00:55:20.190
I'll make my money like the fucking asters to.
Um,
so what I'm trying,

913
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:25.400
so I'm sworn I'm struggling with now is if slash when I should quit my job,

914
00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:30.780
I'll have enough rental income by the end of next year to replace my job.

915
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:34.590
I would love to just quit and hang out with my kids and just live a stress free

916
00:55:34.591 --> 00:55:36.510
life.
But my wife has a different opinion.

917
00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:41.190
She thinks I should keep my six figure job and just keep doing this in the on

918
00:55:41.191 --> 00:55:45.180
the side because we would have way more money.
It's an easy office job,

919
00:55:45.181 --> 00:55:46.260
so I see your point,

920
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.850
but I can't get over how amazing it would be to retire in my early thirties and

921
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:54.900
be able to spend my time however I want.
What do you think I should do?

922
00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:58.860
What would you spend your free time doing?
Thanks.

923
00:55:58.861 --> 00:56:00.780
Go Fuck yourself to first of all,

924
00:56:00.781 --> 00:56:04.860
congratulations man on absolutely crushing it and making money work for you.

925
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:06.690
I know there's a lot of you guys listen to go.
Ooh.

926
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:09.390
Don't fucking six figures and could flow.
Can you?

927
00:56:09.391 --> 00:56:14.391
Wouldn't most of you unfortunately would go out and spend six figures a year.

928
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:17.910
He'd go out and buy some flashy fucking car.
What does this guy do?

929
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:20.550
He went out and he,
he,
he made his money.

930
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.740
He reinvested it and made it work for him.

931
00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.253
<v 4>MMM.</v>

932
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:28.160
<v 1>What I think you should do is what your wife saying.
I would,
I would.</v>

933
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:29.640
<v 4>Okay.</v>

934
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.420
<v 1>Keep working for another 10 years and reevaluate and take that money.</v>

935
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:34.610
<v 4>Okay.</v>

936
00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:39.610
<v 1>That you making over the next 10 years and keep doing what you're doing and then</v>

937
00:56:40.491 --> 00:56:42.290
you'll really be able to retire.

938
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.450
<v 4>Okay.</v>

939
00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:44.890
<v 1>You'll be super comfortable.</v>

940
00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:46.643
<v 4>MMM.</v>

941
00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.080
<v 1>I gotta be honest with you.</v>

942
00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:53.090
Like what would I do if I were tired in my early thirties?
I would probably,
uh,

943
00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:55.280
<v 4>yeah,</v>

944
00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:00.130
<v 1>I'd Kinda be bored shitless.
I would,
I like working.
I like tore.</v>

945
00:57:00.131 --> 00:57:02.360
And I like doing all of that.
Like when I say that I will,
I'll,

946
00:57:02.361 --> 00:57:03.950
I'll exit out of this business.

947
00:57:03.951 --> 00:57:07.400
What I really mean is I'll be in a position in this business where I won't have

948
00:57:07.401 --> 00:57:11.360
to do anything I don't want to do.
I won't have to embarrass myself.

949
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:14.750
I won't have to go on dancing with the stars and all of that Shit.
You know,

950
00:57:14.751 --> 00:57:18.270
whatever the fuck you do whenever you,
your career is tanking.

951
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:19.893
<v 4>MMM.</v>

952
00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:24.770
<v 1>But I think what you're doing is fucking amazing.</v>

953
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:28.460
And that's what people need to do is you got to learn how to make you money.

954
00:57:28.461 --> 00:57:32.390
Can either fucking set you free or it can fucking enslave you.

955
00:57:32.391 --> 00:57:34.790
And I didn't know shit about money and I just keep reading it.

956
00:57:34.791 --> 00:57:39.410
And reading and reading and I baby stepped my way into learning about it.

957
00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:43.520
And that's how I ended up having this fucking opinion on bankers and what they

958
00:57:43.521 --> 00:57:48.120
do to people.
And it's an absolute sin that they don't teach you about money.

959
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:51.860
Three the most important fucking thing when you're in school.
So,

960
00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:55.090
but fortunately there's libraries and books are free there.

961
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.553
<v 4>MMM.</v>

962
00:57:57.550 --> 00:57:58.360
<v 1>That you can,</v>

963
00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:03.360
you can educate yourself the greatest education other than staying away from

964
00:58:04.001 --> 00:58:07.850
drugs wearing a condom and shit like that.

965
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.823
<v 4>MMM.</v>

966
00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.670
<v 1>You got to do what you're doing,
man.</v>

967
00:58:11.671 --> 00:58:15.660
I think that's fucking great that you're doing it.
Um,
I would,
uh,

968
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:19.760
I dunno if I would lose it if I went to a low income area,
I would,

969
00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:21.240
I would fix the fucking thing up,

970
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:24.480
but I would do it in a way that they wouldn't make the other people in the area.

971
00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:26.733
<v 4>MMM.</v>

972
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:30.880
<v 1>Two too jealous that would make them want to go in there and rob the people.</v>

973
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:33.220
But the,
the guts of the fucking building,

974
00:58:33.221 --> 00:58:34.960
I would make sure that I did it up right.

975
00:58:34.961 --> 00:58:37.840
And people would not have fucking leaky sinks in that type of shit.

976
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:41.740
I'd make sure that they were fine.
Uh,
my only concern,
like I said,

977
00:58:41.741 --> 00:58:44.050
was that they're the first ones who get fucking hatchet.

978
00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:47.380
And when the economy tanks cause diagnosed the concept the top,

979
00:58:47.381 --> 00:58:49.960
they're not going to cut off their own fucking arm.
You know,

980
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:54.130
those poor people would need that.
He can't expect people to do that.
So anyways,

981
00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:57.840
congratulations.
I hope to be in your position someday,
sir.
It's a,

982
00:58:57.850 --> 00:59:01.780
it's a goal of mine.
All right.
Pacquiao versus Mayweather,
a bill.

983
00:59:01.781 --> 00:59:04.720
Is this a legit fight in your opinion?
Do we have a dog in this fight?

984
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:07.240
It's absolutely legit fight.
And um,

985
00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:12.460
I like both of these guys and uh,
I'm just hoping it's going to be a great fight.

986
00:59:12.461 --> 00:59:14.380
I'm sorry to give you that country fucking response.

987
00:59:14.381 --> 00:59:16.690
But if I had to pick somebody,

988
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:20.080
I just love how may were the talks,
all that shit.

989
00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:24.010
He's got those cars and he throws his money and it pisses everybody off a fuck.

990
00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:28.390
I really liked both of these guys and I love that packy out came from absolutely

991
00:59:28.391 --> 00:59:32.740
fucking nothing.
Um,
and that he sings and he fucking,

992
00:59:32.741 --> 00:59:35.950
he becomes a senator and all this other shit.
Um,

993
00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.020
I love both of these guys.

994
00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:40.560
<v 4>Okay.</v>

995
00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:43.990
<v 1>It's going to be weird to see one of them loose.
Um,</v>

996
00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:47.400
but it better not be a fucking draw.
I can tell you that.

997
00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:50.550
All I know is I'm going to be fucking wearing a pink bow tie with a matching

998
00:59:50.551 --> 00:59:55.450
fucking thing in my pocket and as see us soccer that go,

999
00:59:55.451 --> 01:00:00.240
you watching it like that.
That's all I know.
Uh,
did we dressed in linen?

1000
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:05.760
All right,
when I go to watch it.
All right.
Dental health,
dear Billy.
Wisdom teeth.

1001
01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.350
Um,

1002
01:00:07.590 --> 01:00:12.210
my wife thinks I have perfect teeth and says I don't do enough to deserve them.

1003
01:00:12.211 --> 01:00:16.590
I floss occasionally,
usually brush twice a day and I've never had any cavities.

1004
01:00:16.591 --> 01:00:18.570
I'm 42.
She says it's genetics.

1005
01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:22.110
She is to do a ton more to achieve the same whiteness.

1006
01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:25.170
Just wondering what your thoughts are on the genetics.

1007
01:00:25.171 --> 01:00:30.120
Arguments make sense to me.
Look at the Brits.
Um,

1008
01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.570
you know something,
I don't know what the deal is with their fucking teeth.

1009
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.240
I mean,
they're not as bad as everybody makes him out to be,
but,
um,

1010
01:00:36.241 --> 01:00:40.890
there's definitely an issue over there,
a stereotype,
but it's spot on.

1011
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:42.310
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1012
01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:45.790
<v 1>What at that,
that's a sentence,
a stereotype,</v>

1013
01:00:45.791 --> 01:00:48.040
but a spot on what at that all right.

1014
01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:52.930
What are your rituals having worked in the dental office,

1015
01:00:52.931 --> 01:00:57.160
some of those mouthwashes that boasts whitening actually stained teeth according

1016
01:00:57.161 --> 01:00:59.560
to a class action lawsuit.
Yeah.

1017
01:00:59.561 --> 01:01:04.561
I just brushed my teeth in the morning and the evening and then I floss.

1018
01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:06.280
I don't have any cavities either.

1019
01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:08.683
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1020
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:10.910
<v 1>Yeah,
I would see.
Yeah,</v>

1021
01:01:10.911 --> 01:01:13.460
there's definitely genetic cause this type of people that have that brush and

1022
01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:16.160
floss and all that,
and then just their,
their teeth,

1023
01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:20.840
they rot out of their fucking heads.
I don't know what they're doing.
Um,

1024
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:25.210
I do know that when you eat sugary stuff,
uh,

1025
01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.140
it's not the sugar that eats away your teeth.

1026
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:29.990
It feeds bad bacteria in your mouth that attack your teeth.

1027
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:33.800
I think I do remember that from my days working in a dental office,

1028
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:38.750
but my ritual is every six months I get my teeth cleaned.
Um,

1029
01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:42.530
and my ritual is also,
if the guy says,
I have a cavity,
I get a second opinion.

1030
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:45.410
That's only happened one time and I didn't.

1031
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:49.700
Sometimes they misread x rays and they'll dig into a perfectly good fucking

1032
01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:53.370
tooth and then you got a filling and then if shit gets under the filling next

1033
01:01:53.371 --> 01:01:56.210
scene or you need a root canal,
then it gets pulled in and need a partial,

1034
01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:59.690
then you need dentures.
It just goes down the fucking hill.
So,
um,

1035
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.000
if you don't have any cavities and somebody says you have a cavity,

1036
01:02:02.001 --> 01:02:06.710
always get a second opinion.
Um,
that's all I can tell you.
And other than that,

1037
01:02:06.711 --> 01:02:09.710
brush twice a day,
not three times floss.

1038
01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:11.453
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1039
01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:15.930
<v 1>Yeah.
I don't know.
I,
you scope or Listerine.</v>

1040
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:21.700
I haven't had a problem with them standing your fucking teeth.
Uh,

1041
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:25.850
so why don't you use mouthwash first and then brush your teeth?
It's pretty easy.

1042
01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:29.930
I would stay away from red wine.
As you're drinking it,
you smile at somebody,

1043
01:02:29.931 --> 01:02:33.740
you have great teeth.
He like a fucking vampire.
All right.
Fiances,

1044
01:02:33.741 --> 01:02:37.160
gay best friend,
a Billy red state tourist.
Uh,

1045
01:02:37.161 --> 01:02:41.510
I need some advice from you and maybe Nia,
I apologize if I spelled it right now.

1046
01:02:41.511 --> 01:02:45.020
You didn't.
Uh,
she has the time.
Well,
unfortunately I'm on the road here.
Uh,

1047
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:49.610
my fiance is living with me and also carrying my baby girl who was doing August.

1048
01:02:49.611 --> 01:02:53.450
Congratulations.
She's been friends with this gay guy for a long time.

1049
01:02:53.451 --> 01:02:55.910
She says he's the only one who can make her laugh so hard.

1050
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:57.620
She almost pisses herself.

1051
01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:01.100
I'm fine that they are close and I'm fine with them being gay.

1052
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:04.670
I was raised in Texas where homosexuality is,
isn't as welcome.

1053
01:03:04.671 --> 01:03:05.570
There is some places,

1054
01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.890
especially since I went to a Baptist church all of my life before your rant,

1055
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:13.990
it was never a hate gays kind of preaching.
It was more of a homosexual.

1056
01:03:13.991 --> 01:03:17.780
He is unbiblical and it's a sin.
Love them anyway.

1057
01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.100
You guys save yourselves in the end.
Um,
anyway,

1058
01:03:22.101 --> 01:03:25.370
my perspective is people are free to do what they want as long as they don't

1059
01:03:25.371 --> 01:03:26.240
impose it on me.

1060
01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:29.570
She went to spend a few days with her gay friend and his boyfriend,

1061
01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.140
and when she came back she told me a few stories about the fun they had,

1062
01:03:33.141 --> 01:03:36.950
including when he had to use the restroom so bad.

1063
01:03:36.951 --> 01:03:39.200
He went in while she was showering.

1064
01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:42.050
I'm not against them being friends,

1065
01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:46.010
but I think he should have had enough respect for me as a man to not walk into

1066
01:03:46.011 --> 01:03:49.490
the bathroom.
Why,
why a woman was in the shower,
gay or not.

1067
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:52.340
He still has a dick and shouldn't walk into a shower.

1068
01:03:52.341 --> 01:03:55.970
Another man's woman is naked.
Should I bring this up or should I leave it be,

1069
01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.490
if I should,
if I should bring it up.

1070
01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:02.060
What should I say without hurting her feelings?

1071
01:04:02.061 --> 01:04:06.740
Keep in mind she is pregnant and hormonal,
uh,
love.
You.

1072
01:04:06.741 --> 01:04:11.330
Love the show.
The Texan.
Um,
I would have,
I would just have a ps.

1073
01:04:11.331 --> 01:04:15.850
My baby has a high chance of being a redhead.
Lots of reds on her side in mind,

1074
01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:18.300
including both of our mothers were.
There you go.

1075
01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:21.560
You'll have a funny little bastard.
Oh,
I'm sorry.
You have a,
you have a daughter.

1076
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:26.650
She'll be a hot shit then.
Um,
all right.
Uh,

1077
01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.720
what would I say?
I would,
I would have an adult conversation with them.
Just say,

1078
01:04:30.721 --> 01:04:35.190
listen man,
I'm not trying to be a dick.
Um,
it's not cool.

1079
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:39.270
That's not cool for you to be going in there.
Um,
when my wife is in there.

1080
01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:45.100
All right.
I,
I just,
and then what's the and what's,
I don't know,

1081
01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.720
I don't know how you say this to the guy.
Just as a man,
you know,

1082
01:04:49.721 --> 01:04:53.440
I don't want you going in and going to the bathroom while my wife is naked in

1083
01:04:53.441 --> 01:04:58.060
the shower.
Okay.
That's it.
That's it.

1084
01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:01.630
And by like,
you know,
I'm gay or whatever,
as I listen,
I don't care.

1085
01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.520
I don't care that you're gay.
You know,
I,

1086
01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.850
I don't have any problem with you being gay.

1087
01:05:06.851 --> 01:05:11.530
I have a problem with you going in naked while my wife is in the shower.
Okay.

1088
01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:15.820
You crossing a line there and I don't want you to cross that line again.
Okay.

1089
01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:16.980
That's it.

1090
01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.520
We're call and I would leave it at that and I wouldn't even tell you wife about

1091
01:05:20.521 --> 01:05:25.110
it.
And if he tells you wife and she brings it up with you,

1092
01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.470
just say,
listen,
I'm not comfortable with that.

1093
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:31.620
I don't want another naked man peeing while you're in the shower.

1094
01:05:31.621 --> 01:05:33.180
I don't think that's unreasonable.

1095
01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:34.970
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1096
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:38.030
<v 1>I don't think that's unreasonable.
And if she gives you shit to just be like,</v>

1097
01:05:38.031 --> 01:05:42.320
look,
can you just respect me on this?
Okay.
We had it out.

1098
01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:46.160
He agreed with me.
All right,
I'm doing this because I love you.

1099
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.983
<v 4>All right,</v>

1100
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:51.910
<v 1>go put it on the real housewives.
I'll sit here with you.
But just,
you know,</v>

1101
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:55.120
there's,
if there's a line here,
I think you're totally within your rights,

1102
01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:58.620
just in general.
You know what I mean?
Like,
yeah,
no,
I don't want you to do that.

1103
01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:00.443
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1104
01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:05.030
<v 1>You're fucking right to say that just because you say no to somebody who's gay</v>

1105
01:06:05.031 --> 01:06:08.360
does not,
you know,
it does not make you fucking homophobic.

1106
01:06:08.361 --> 01:06:12.290
They are human beings and they're capable of,
of crossing lines.

1107
01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:15.270
He crossed the line.
You don't like it.
It's not.

1108
01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:17.930
It has nothing to do with him being gay has to with the fact that he's a man.

1109
01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.540
He treated them like a fucking man.
You treat him the way he treated straight,

1110
01:06:20.541 --> 01:06:24.080
man.
There's nothing wrong with that.
At least I don't think so.
No.
Jesus.

1111
01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:26.810
All right.
That's the podcast for this week.
Everybody,
uh,

1112
01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:28.480
if you'd like to donate to the podcast now,

1113
01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:31.400
there's a very way easy way to do it that,
um,

1114
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:33.500
does not include you spending any money.

1115
01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:37.520
Next time you go to amazon.com just swing by a bill bird.com.

1116
01:06:37.521 --> 01:06:38.720
Click on the podcast page.

1117
01:06:38.721 --> 01:06:43.550
You Click on the Amazon link on the right hand corner or right hand mid page.

1118
01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.790
It takes you right to Amazon and I get credit for driving traffic there.

1119
01:06:46.791 --> 01:06:49.790
They kicked me a little bit of cash.
Um,

1120
01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:53.210
and it doesn't cost you any extra money if you'd like to do it.
Thank you.

1121
01:06:53.211 --> 01:06:56.360
If you don't,
I respect it.
Whatever.
That's the deal.

1122
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.050
That's the Monday morning podcast.
I'll check in with you guys on Thursday.

1123
01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:03.590
Have a nice couple of days in a read up on money.
We end up on money.

1124
01:07:03.591 --> 01:07:05.820
Get your money to fucking work for you.
Um,

1125
01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:08.740
I highly recommend you do not put it in the fucking stock market.

1126
01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:12.350
I think that's the biggest fucking scam ever.
I am a big believer in buying,

1127
01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.550
