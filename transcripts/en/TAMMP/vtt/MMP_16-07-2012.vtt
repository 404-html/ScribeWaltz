00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.090
Hey,
this is bill burr.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.190
This is actually an intro before the intro to the podcast.

3
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:12.690
This is not the official podcast at this point.
Um,
I was on the road and,

4
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:16.500
uh,
I recorded the podcast on Thursday.

5
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:21.501
I did it into my iPhone and my iPhone wasn't synced up to my computer and I'm

6
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:25.140
too much of a fucking moron to be able to figure out how to deal with that.

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.790
So I had to fly back,
give it to my tech guy.
So I just,

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.110
now it's fine.

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.680
I just wanted to let you know that that's what it is because in five seconds

10
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:37.380
you're going to hear me talking about,
hey,
it's Thursday.

11
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:42.300
Look at me doing it all fucking early.
All right,
so that's the,

12
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:45.360
that's the reason for that.
Before you send me your emails,
all right,
go.

13
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.240
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's built birds.
The Monday morning podcast from Monday,</v>

14
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.180
July 16th,

15
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.420
2012 a recording at this week on my iPhone.
I'm on the road,

16
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.220
so I wasn't going to bring my mixer and all that other shit.
Um,

17
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.550
got a big week.
I'm actually recording this on a Thursday before I do my show.

18
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:09.560
So if something amazing happened,
like,
uh,
somebody very important died,

19
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.280
or if that asteroid hit the fucking planet,
that's because,
uh,

20
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.540
and I'm not addressing it.

21
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.380
It's not like I'm doing some hipster thing trying to act like I don't notice

22
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.130
it's Thursday here.
And,
uh,
I'm in Boston right now.

23
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.480
The friendly confines I've been behind enemy lines since 1995.

24
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:31.481
So back here in Boston and I figured what better time to do a podcast with a

25
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:34.130
fellow Boston sports fan.
Um,

26
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.340
Dave Portnoy's is my guests this week.

27
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.000
I feel like I have a real show here by the way.
Uh,
he saw the creator,
yeah,

28
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.800
the creator of Barstool sports.com which,
uh,
is so big now that I've,

29
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:49.700
I've heard it's now in New York,
Philly,
well,
New York's version of Barstool.

30
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:53.870
Obviously they're not talking Boston sports,
but,
uh,
before we get into this,
it's,

31
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:58.100
it's like a,
you know,
his,
his website is,
you know,

32
00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:02.990
all things Boston and then it just shoots off from there from political stuff
to,

33
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:05.940
uh,
the smoke show of the week.
Right?
The hot shoe.

34
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.430
Pretty much anything that we feel like talking about it.

35
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.490
We have the Boston version of New York,
Philly College version,
but it's a,

36
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.090
it's almost like a guy gossip site if you want to write that way,

37
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.730
but geared towards,
let me ask you this,
because you know,

38
00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:23.870
everybody can get a bunch of hits and that type of Shit on,
uh,

39
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.940
on the Internet,
you know,
but like to actually make money off of the Internet.

40
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.731
That's what I want to do.

41
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:32.650
All right out of the gate was to congratulate you that you actually tried.

42
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.740
And you know,

43
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:37.520
there's like major movie studios trying to figure out how to fucking make money

44
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.210
on the internet because everybody like pirates,
they're,
uh,

45
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:44.300
their movies and all that type of stuff.
So congratulations dude.

46
00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:48.380
Welcome to the world of making money and not really technically having a job.

47
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.000
Yeah,
no,
it's not a bad place to be.
It's not a bad place to be and it's a,

48
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:55.580
it was a long Brian,
but we're here now.
What,
how,
how long,

49
00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:57.160
how long has it been since you started doing,

50
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.070
school's been around for like seven years.
Started as a newspaper.

51
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.030
<v 2>So it was,
you know,
you see the racks and improper Bostonian,
all that crap.</v>

52
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:07.390
We were just a free gambling rag,
four pages,
black and white.

53
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.750
You see you started off giving people picks and stuff like that.
It was,
yeah,

54
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.730
it was sorta like that.
I mean,
I was like,
uh,
I met,
I was a degenerate gambler,

55
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.020
so I hated my job.
Nice.
Tried to move to Vegas,
get a job.

56
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:23.170
Well I W I,
I wait,
wait,
wait.
How bad did the gambling get?

57
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:25.090
We like one of those guys like,
oh,

58
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:28.690
it's five hour energy on the way to your phone on the way to Foxwoods.
No,
no.

59
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:31.540
I was never really big Foxwoods guy.
Much more sports.

60
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.510
You can't get in trouble so much at Foxwoods because he needed the money in your

61
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:34.840
hand.

62
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.910
You can get into trouble and much more with like sports because they'll give you

63
00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:41.260
a credit.
But I mean,
I used to gamble a lot,
hated my job.

64
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.210
How far in did you get?

65
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:46.460
Like how much you make in a week and how much did you owe?
I mean,
I,

66
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.470
well this will be all relative,
but I mean I,
I've been down 30,

67
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:54.630
40 grand before.
That's a shit done.
30,
40 grand.
Yeah.

68
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.140
Are they like knocking on your door at that point?
Well,
you know what,

69
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.270
you have relationships.
My Guy who I've gone through,
my,
uh,

70
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.400
he'll love this part and he talking about,

71
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:10.030
but I've been going through him since college,
so I,
and it gradually,
you know,

72
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:12.310
like I did.
Fortunately you don't go through him anymore.
Right?

73
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:16.060
Just in case there's any problems.
I mean,
I was still mutual acquaintances,

74
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.580
but you see each other around the holidays,

75
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.140
you get to be such a degenerate and you get to be so loose.

76
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:26.980
Like I never win.
Never.
I mean,
I gambled since I've been alive,

77
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:31.180
I've probably collected two weeks and 30 years.
So it's like I,
you know,

78
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:34.840
I'm always going to lose.
So if I lose,
it's now to the point.
If I lost,

79
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.350
let's just throw a number.
If I lost 20 units,
I only have to pay a 10.

80
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.060
I get unbelievable discounts and it's never knock on your door.

81
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:45.460
You always knows I'm going to pay.
Like most of it worked here.

82
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.160
So it's never been like,
dude,
I never had the heart for it.

83
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.380
<v 1>I long time ago in like the late eighties,</v>

84
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.640
the Patriots sucked.
I forget what year,
but they was supposed to be good.

85
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.700
I think it was 89 and I wasn't,
you know,

86
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.660
I'd spent all my money on season tickets and uh,

87
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.750
and they just kept losing.
So I was like,
fuck this,
I'm going to,

88
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.400
I'm going to win some money back.

89
00:05:07.401 --> 00:05:11.630
So they will losing the everybody and the buffalo bills came to town and this is

90
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.000
89.
So it was before they were the run and gun and everybody knew but,
but the,

91
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.060
but this was the fucking team before they did.

92
00:05:17.061 --> 00:05:21.440
And like the bills always sucked between Oj and the running gun.
They just,

93
00:05:21.441 --> 00:05:24.800
you know,
they had a couple of decent years so you know,
I buried in,

94
00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:27.650
which was 50 bucks in my life or something like that.
I buried them.

95
00:05:27.651 --> 00:05:30.440
And so I think Miami and they both,
uh,
and I,

96
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.120
the Patriots in Miami and they both didn't come through when I was down like 100

97
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.370
bucks.
I was making like one 75 a week and that was enough for me.
I did it once.

98
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.190
I think the greatest thing that ever happened to me is I,

99
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:41.750
I didn't win the first week.
Like,
did you win the first week?

100
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.820
<v 2>No.
No.
Most people generally do when no,
I just,
you know,</v>

101
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.760
I just had the disease.
It's like I love doing it.
I know.

102
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.360
Luckily for me I haven't done it and it's all probably,
actually,

103
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.190
this is how I rationalize in my brain.

104
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:57.830
I don't think it would have done barstool if I didn't have that.
Like gene,

105
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.310
because there's so much risk with what we do.
Even now,
like concerts,

106
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.670
concerts or it's like stock market type shit.
It's like,
you know,

107
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.990
that's how we make a lot of our money.

108
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:09.520
We do these like basically raised for college kids.
Get those blackout party.

109
00:06:09.521 --> 00:06:12.290
Exactly.
So we'll rent out buildings and you know,

110
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:14.420
we're basically pet on kids buying the tickets.

111
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:18.950
Like we're laying out tens of thousands of dollars before we do it open.
Tell,

112
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.950
tell the listeners a little bit about that because I didn't know about those.

113
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:23.510
I know you did all the talking,

114
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.020
the stuff about sports and all that type of stuff.
So you,
you host these things.

115
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.010
A blackout Pongo parties we started gives you shit,
right?
Yeah.

116
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:32.120
We get shit from everybody.

117
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.490
We're like enemy number one of Boston and lately moving,

118
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.450
I mean somehow we've ended up,

119
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:41.990
I mean the calls from 2020 we were on inside edition with that thing.

120
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.070
Who's the guy who's the gay guy with the short blonde hair?
Good looking guy.

121
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.280
Anderson Cooper,
Anderson Cooper.
He,
they called.
I mean,

122
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:51.720
it's all about the Blacko parties for,

123
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.350
even though everyone's kind of doing similar stuff.
But these are Raves,

124
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.840
I'm going to take it or no,
if he's gay and not,

125
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.670
I'm not trying to out that guy in the product.
No,
I think he's,
no,
I think he is.

126
00:06:59.671 --> 00:07:03.620
He,
I dunno.
No,
he's out.
He outdid himself.
Oh he did?
Yeah.
Okay.

127
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.380
So you've maybe used the Thursday excuse.
No,
he's,

128
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.240
you may want to research it and taste.

129
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.860
You don't have them now and it makes sense.
He's got great half always looks gay,

130
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.800
guys always have great,
no,
my wife thinks he's the hottest guy,

131
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:20.801
but I'm 99% sure that he's said he's gay.

132
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.980
And if he has such a classic podcast moment,

133
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:27.410
we don't even know and I'm going to go with it.
It's like it's fucking fact.

134
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.160
Well there's nothing I got nothing you can sue me for.
So it would allegedly,

135
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.390
who gives a fuck either put my reputation on it and no matter what,

136
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.970
even if he hasn't said,
I'm pretty sure he is.
But I think you said it,

137
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.190
but it's your podcast,
not mine.

All right,
have a nice week.

191
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.280
<v 2>I'm glad we got that cleared up.
I don't even remember.</v>

192
00:11:04.281 --> 00:11:07.310
Now I'm off track what I was talking about.
You're talking about to a blackout.

193
00:11:07.311 --> 00:11:09.710
So basically what we do with the blackouts,
um,

194
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.670
I'm going to guess if you didn't know that Anderson Cooper wasn't cared,

195
00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:15.710
that you don't really know what like Edm music is either.
Do you,

196
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.710
you met Edm dance music?
You know,

197
00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:22.700
only because it was on the cover of rolling stone.
Did recently just that,

198
00:11:22.701 --> 00:11:27.590
that danger mouse not danger about sia dead.
Dead Mouse.
A dead mouse.
No,

199
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.250
I didn't always dead.
Mt.
Five Mt.
Five dead.

200
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.690
My five cause I was saying that my five,
my girls going,

201
00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:36.200
I think it's dead mouse and they use this a five is like an s it where's the

202
00:11:36.201 --> 00:11:36.860
mouse set?

203
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.590
I'm not going to pass judgment because two years ago I didn't know what it was.

204
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:44.510
But now like now I'm in that scene,
I'm I,
that's what we do.
So it's basically,

205
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.340
as far as I can tell,

206
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.580
it's house music with lasers and lights and shit bouncing off kids eyes.

207
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.600
That's what it is.
So it's old school,
like just,
you know,

208
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.360
kids are doing drugs fucked up out of their mind.

209
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:03.310
And those are the parties we do.
Now.
I'm not saying it well that that's if,

210
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.730
if Mayor Menino heard me say that,
he'd be like here knocking on my door.

211
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:10.420
But so we do these parties,
we don't supply any of the stuff.
But the lasers,

212
00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:15.400
the lights,
the hardcore music.
And is that element,
well it's,

213
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.840
it's a rave.
I mean it's a rave.
It's a frigging rife.
That's really what it is.

214
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.720
But it's not just us,
it's what college kids do now.

215
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.060
<v 1>No,
I actually saw some of the,</v>

216
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.790
some of the video of some of the girls and stuff like that.

217
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:30.340
If I was a younger man that would be the place I would go,

218
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.060
whether I liked that music or not.
And um,

219
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.240
you actually had like some fun,
eventually we will get to sports on this.
Guys,

220
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.910
I know you had some fall out though.
Like you,
you did some,

221
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.940
like on your website you had some sort of a,
um,

222
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.880
some sort of a joke or whatever and they uh,

223
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.890
that a rape joke and then you went on TV.
I got to tell you,
dude,
that took balls,

224
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:53.290
man.
Like you sticking up for your joke like that.

225
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:55.570
Like I would have stuck up for my joke,

226
00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:59.860
but I would have done it with a little more tech.
I'll have a link to it on my,

227
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:02.010
uh,
for podcast listeners.
She was just

228
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.990
<v 2>Lisa Guerra.
Yeah,
man.
She came in,
she's the girl who wasn't close to Joe.</v>

229
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.740
She's been in playboy by the way.
And used to do the weather girl for sports,

230
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:14.190
for CBS sports.
That Lisa Greer,
she's gorgeous.
Yeah,
well she was,
but anyways,

231
00:13:14.191 --> 00:13:18.360
the joke was,
look at me,
I'm getting price.
No,
I listen,

232
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:23.180
I call it as a C.
I mean,
I know she wouldn't look at me,
but whatever.
Um,

233
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.030
point is,
we had a,
there was a story in Europe,

234
00:13:27.031 --> 00:13:32.031
Australia where a guy got accused of rape and was acquitted in his defense was,

235
00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:35.070
she was where the judge greed with the defense.

236
00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:39.150
He was wearing skinny jeans and there's no way he could've gotten the jeans off

237
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.770
without her consent because they were skinny jeans.
So that got him off.

238
00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:46.140
That got him off.
So that was the story.

239
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:51.630
So are our take on it.
And it was the same take as we do with everything.
I mean,

240
00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:53.700
we make fun of everybody was,

241
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:58.920
it came out in the story that she was a size six.
And so I said,

242
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:03.090
who cares about the rape side of things aside sick should never be wearing

243
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.540
skinny jeans.
You gotta be like,
Oh,
that's that big.
Yeah.
Well,
for skinny jeans.

244
00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:09.710
Yeah.
I think you gotta be a zero or a two for a skinny jeans.
Um,

245
00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.810
and I don't like skinny plus a fat girl.
You're saying,
and skinny jeans.

246
00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:14.840
That's what I was saying the problem.
But they were like,
well the,

247
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.000
maybe that's why she,
they couldn't get him off.
Exactly.

248
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.330
And that's how we got off.
And then I took a step further and said,
who cares?

249
00:14:21.331 --> 00:14:24.780
But that you actually,
if you're going to wear skinny jeans,

250
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:29.250
you probably deserve to be raped anyway.
So it was actually a fat joke.
Yeah,

251
00:14:29.251 --> 00:14:33.400
that's exactly what actually affects exactly what it was.
I get

252
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:38.250
<v 1>it.
So you go,
and so,
so anyway,
Dave goes on this show,
you'll see in the clip,</v>

253
00:14:38.251 --> 00:14:40.650
this girl goes right at you.
It's just like,
you know,

254
00:14:40.651 --> 00:14:44.040
you think rape jokes are funny or something.
You were like,

255
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.550
somehow she was saying,
you think that joke is funny and you're like,
yes,
I do.

256
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.380
And then she,
then she tried to,
to cook you,
she tried to spin it and be like,
oh,

257
00:14:51.381 --> 00:14:55.580
so you find reg funny.
You're like,
no,
I don't,
but I,
I did.
She goes,

258
00:14:55.581 --> 00:14:58.550
well then I don't think you understand how offensive that joke is.

259
00:14:58.551 --> 00:14:59.001
And then you're like,

260
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:02.420
well evidently I don't and I totally got what you were saying.
You was like,

261
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.960
at least what I think he was saying.
Well you're basically saying like,

262
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.840
like I would equate it to like seeing an old lady fall down a flight of stairs

263
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.880
in real life.
Not fucking funny.
Horrific.
Okay.
In a will Ferrell movie.
Right.

264
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.780
Hilarious.
And cause because it's so horrific.
Right.
All right,

265
00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:22.781
so you actually did a like a roundabout like fat,

266
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.990
like sort of a fashion joke.
You sort of making it like go on like a,

267
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.720
that's basically ladies,
you know,

268
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:34.130
if you're a size six don't try to slam your fat ass into a by no means we're

269
00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:38.330
condoning condoning rate.
And that's what everyone was twisted on us in.

270
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.750
But it was funny though,
but you didn't even explain it to her.
You just,

271
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.890
you just answered her questions and didn't try to enlighten her at all.

272
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.560
And that's when I watched the clip.
I was just like Jesus Christ.

273
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.020
Cause I w I would have been like,
look,

274
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:54.800
the joke was about this and then I would have backed out saying,
you know,

275
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:57.260
it's not my problem if people don't get my jokes,
I,

276
00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.440
that's the way I would have handled it.
You just were like you,

277
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.910
you were like fucking all over north and screams.

278
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.410
You know what it came across it.
And here's the weird thing.

279
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:08.900
A lot of people think that clip made me look like an asshole.

280
00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.430
And I remember people being like,
fuck,

281
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.130
I would think that a bunch of people think that you're a piece of shit out

282
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.220
exactly like this,
this fuck,
uh,
you know,

283
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.820
my mother in law sit and watch and you know,
channel four,
it's like,
Oh shit,

284
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.210
son in laws condones rape,
like what's going on?
But the thing about it,

285
00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:27.140
what you just said,

286
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:31.880
that they probably an inside edition showed 30 seconds to me talk.

287
00:16:31.881 --> 00:16:34.340
And I was in there for an hour and a half and I mean,

288
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.120
at one point I thought we were going to fight each other.
Dude,

289
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.980
I got to tell you that when you're getting interviewed,
the longer it goes,

290
00:16:39.981 --> 00:16:43.370
that's like the first 48 where at some point in the interview you have to be

291
00:16:43.371 --> 00:16:43.641
like,

292
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:48.350
am I being charged with anything because if not I'm going to leave or if I am I

293
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:48.890
want a lawyer.

294
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.820
But the longer you talk that's the same thing doing like standup specials.

295
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.570
Like I remember back in the day,
uh,
the first time I got to,

296
00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.330
I got a half hour on comedy central.
They were like,
uh,

297
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.340
you know it's,
you know,
it's going to be 22 minutes cause they have,

298
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.250
they have eight minutes of commercials and a half hours.
So they wanted us to,

299
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:11.450
they were like bare minimum.
We need at least 28 minutes.

300
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.410
So I did 28 minutes on the nose.
Other guys would go over,

301
00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:16.540
cause the way I looked at it,

302
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.100
I have no power over how they're going to edit this cause it's,

303
00:17:19.101 --> 00:17:23.720
so I'm going to give them a little extra footage as I can.

304
00:17:23.721 --> 00:17:26.270
And what ended up happening was they took a whole joke.

305
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.340
They just took the whole bit out.
I love the bit,
but I only lost,

306
00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:33.800
it was only one thing to be upset about.
So I think when you get into those,

307
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.540
those interviews,
uh,
like further down the line you should be like,
you know,

308
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.110
it takes them an hour and a half to ask you about a fucking rave and one joke

309
00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.440
and we're all over the map and work dumb idiots.
I mean they came to our office,

310
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.290
this camera crew and were like serving him tea and crumpets.
Oh you like crack

311
00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.290
<v 2>a little joke thing to we're buddies with these people.</v>

312
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.990
That's one of the first things you learned that was not your friend.
No,
no,

313
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:58.260
but we were,
we were rolling out the red carpet.
Like they were friendly.

314
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:01.800
His house.
Super Nice.
Great.
What you're doing with your website.

315
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:02.920
It's really must be great,
you know,

316
00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.430
like meeting young people who are doing things.

317
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.990
But the second that interview ended,
I knew,
I knew that she was going to be,

318
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:10.980
I mean there was,

319
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:15.300
I and I met the camera guy who also did a 2020 thing that we just did.

320
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.500
And even he says like it was one of the more contentious interviews and they're

321
00:18:19.501 --> 00:18:23.250
built to be contagious because it was,
it was that exchange,

322
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.850
that type of tension the whole time with this lady at the second you sat down,

323
00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.290
you felt she was already,
I mean we said stuff like she's,

324
00:18:31.291 --> 00:18:34.680
I mean I forget the exchange we had,
there was some exchanges where it was like,

325
00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:37.530
she's like,
well,
I'm a feminist.
Like,
well I saw you naked in playboy,

326
00:18:37.531 --> 00:18:38.790
so I don't think the Fed,
you know,

327
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.390
they think you're a feminist and it was that type of exchange.
Oh my God,

328
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.770
they're going to release this on DVD and I see the library,
Hey,

329
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:52.110
I would pay five grand cash for the full interview.

330
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.010
I actually think it would make me look great because they cut up like what

331
00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:58.350
you're talking about.
She didn't have any of the back contents.

332
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.110
I asked her a hundred times like,
did you read the blog?

333
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.780
You're just saying I can don't rape.
Do you even know what it's about?

334
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.790
She couldn't answer it.
You know,
she asked me,

335
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.240
do I actually think at the end of the day to use that overlies expression that

336
00:19:11.821 --> 00:19:15.270
they love having a guest like you?
Cause at the end I'm going to use it again.

337
00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:19.410
The end of the day they want people to watch and if they have an interview like

338
00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:20.480
you,
yeah,

339
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.310
I think there's that weird push pull thing where they're acting like they're

340
00:19:23.311 --> 00:19:24.270
completely outraged.

341
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:29.190
But they're totally psyched that your being what they think is,
is an asshole.

342
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.130
Right.
And I'm an easy target and I'm probably someone like you.

343
00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:35.730
And then you were sitting there and a tank top.
Well that,
that's my,

344
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.000
that's my army gear.
Like if Rand's,
I'm wearing now,

345
00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:44.001
but if I show up to a professional interview in a purple tank top similar to

346
00:19:44.311 --> 00:19:44.521
this,

347
00:19:44.521 --> 00:19:48.120
and it's a little more outrageous than when I wear that means I know you don't

348
00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:52.740
like me across.
I'm gonna try to make a,
not a mockery,
but it's like my mental,

349
00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.460
I know I'm about to meet,
be made into an asshole.
So you like that.

350
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.270
If you're going to try and screw me,
I'm not putting on a suit and tie.
Right,

351
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.370
exactly.
I'm not going to try.

352
00:20:00.371 --> 00:20:03.180
I already know you're going to make me look like a jerk.
That's actually jerking.

353
00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:07.500
Hilarious.
That's the acid you dress.
You know what they'd say as a comedian,

354
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.430
you're supposed to dress to the level of the room.
You know what I mean?

355
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:13.650
Like if you're going to do like,
you know some a room,

356
00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:16.650
you don't come in their dress like a bum and then you know if,

357
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.990
if you're doing some hellhole you can dress it down.

358
00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:22.770
But I always feel like you know,
you,
you know,
you at least one a in a hell.

359
00:20:22.771 --> 00:20:26.040
Rome have some sort of moat between you and the animals.

360
00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:29.860
So if you have some sort of,
I'm in show business shiny shirt on that,

361
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.590
that can kind of help tell you like,
I don't know the whole backstory of that,

362
00:20:34.591 --> 00:20:39.480
but all I know when I watched that I was just like,
uh,
you know,

363
00:20:39.481 --> 00:20:43.140
that's a lot of comedians and friends of mine,
Opie and Anthony Show,

364
00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:45.630
I should send him that clip.
Like if they haven't seen it,

365
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.220
like I think they would get a kick

366
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.050
<v 1>out of,
I'm not saying they can donate one way or the other,</v>

367
00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:52.270
cause I'm not trying to get anybody to drag it on the ship.

368
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:57.271
But just the to to the way you did that and there was no like you didn't cause

369
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.500
I,
like I said,
I would have tried to explain the joke.
I didn't blink.

370
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:07.690
She fucking don't face the right back out.
It was,
it was real.
It was funny.

371
00:21:07.691 --> 00:21:11.890
So I'm see my face actually,
and when I rewatch it,
like I almost grind my teeth.

372
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.170
I knew it was coming and was like,
I just can't ring up to art.

373
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.100
Don't back down right here.
Just go right back out her.
Well,

374
00:21:18.101 --> 00:21:21.360
it's going to be interesting as you do more and more of those interviews since

375
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:25.070
I'll be looking now for the tank top.
He's got an Izod,

376
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:29.420
he kind of likes this guy.
Maybe the thing so,
well now that we're,
we're uh,

377
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.710
I didn't,
can we even like,
like we haven't really even talked sports.

378
00:21:32.711 --> 00:21:36.910
I got to tell you about the most depressing thing that I've heard as a Boston

379
00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:38.320
sports fan is like,

380
00:21:38.321 --> 00:21:43.210
I was excited that Dwight Howard was possibly going to go to Brooklyn.
And My,

381
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.270
my whole thing is anybody but the fucking Lakers,
like,

382
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:51.810
because I just feel like they are better at the free agency game and they got,

383
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:55.970
they have the city that the dude's want to play in.
All right.

384
00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:00.220
They got better whether they got,
we got basically we have humidity,

385
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:03.160
we have the winter and we have racist.

386
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.800
La has better weather,

387
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.130
celebrity ass and racist.
You know,

388
00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:11.600
cause I always tried to have like all the racists are in Boston.
Like,
you know,

389
00:22:11.601 --> 00:22:14.860
all you gotta do is just see the LAPD greatest hits and you can kind of see a

390
00:22:14.861 --> 00:22:18.850
through line.
Um,
but I mean out here it really is like fucking that.

391
00:22:18.851 --> 00:22:20.370
That's why it made me cringe.
Like when I,

392
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.830
when I watched the Bruins loose at that overtime goal and those assholes wrote

393
00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:25.720
that meet had shit on Twitter.
And I'm like,

394
00:22:25.721 --> 00:22:30.370
do you realize that's actually affecting the Celtics ability?
Probably.
Could you,

395
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.470
could you keep that as a big story?
Yeah,
it was brutal.
I think I,

396
00:22:33.471 --> 00:22:35.740
but honestly with that shit,
I think,

397
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.790
I think maybe your Lala land buy lists because I don't even care about the

398
00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:43.410
Lakers.
I'm so the heat right now or like the,

399
00:22:43.411 --> 00:22:45.940
the just my eye,

400
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.720
I've sent her an expansion franchise titles.
I would have rather the heat.

401
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:53.950
It's the Lakers,
the Lakers,
Lakers heat in the finals this past year,

402
00:22:53.951 --> 00:22:57.790
I route 100% of the Lakers.
Not even a question in my mind.

403
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.640
That's how much I hate Miami.
I think that's the general consensus.
Uh,

404
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.730
35.
Do you remember Lakers,
Celtics and the agent?
No.
I remember that.

405
00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:08.920
You've let go of that yet?
No,
I haven't let go of it.

406
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.160
I haven't let go of it because there was even there when we had the Lakers

407
00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:12.870
Celtics.

408
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.120
I know that's nine when they call fucking 12 files on us and five and you know,

409
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.920
I know,
I know.
Listen,
I was there.
I,
I know.
But then again,

410
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.300
this whole ray Allen thing now too,
it's Lebron.

411
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.730
I they're my least fit.

412
00:23:27.731 --> 00:23:31.360
Lebron's my least favorite human on earth in the heat or right now,

413
00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:36.190
my least favorite team on earth.
Oh,
you so you still hate Lebron spies and why?

414
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.710
I just eat,
I hate everything about just the fact they want,
but well,
it,

415
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.210
I'm fascinated.

416
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.390
This is really fucking hard for me to talk about now because he wants so it

417
00:23:45.391 --> 00:23:46.100
steals a lot

418
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.940
<v 2>of the shit that I had gone.
But before you're going to talk about,
oh no,</v>

419
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.510
it's all the reason that I hated it in a more like he's never won,

420
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:55.130
but he's been called all those whole life.

421
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.180
I hate that we charge is fucking 20 grand to go to his birthday party.
You know,

422
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:03.470
I hate how he twit something like did he send you like an invite and then I read

423
00:24:03.471 --> 00:24:08.300
about it,
the off speed on the Internet,
on the Internet.
Um,

424
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.300
all the shit he does.
I mean,
it just,

425
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.440
everything about him drives me Berserk.
Now granted,

426
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.830
the fact that you used to choke in the clutch and all that shit,
I mean,

427
00:24:18.831 --> 00:24:19.664
it's hard to talk about.

428
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:21.280
<v 1>I know you just,</v>

429
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.840
you literally as you were telling me that he was unwinding a fucking paperclip.

430
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.850
Don't want to tell you something.
You gotta let that Shit Go.
It's tough.

431
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.590
What about the range and older?
How old are you?
I'm 44.
All right,

432
00:24:32.591 --> 00:24:34.750
so you got me by a little bit.
Yeah,
I got you by a lot,
dude.

433
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.520
You learn a lot in the next nine years where you know what it is,

434
00:24:38.521 --> 00:24:40.540
is something about hitting 40.
Well,

435
00:24:40.541 --> 00:24:43.810
you're coming down the back stretch and you're like,
dude,
if I'm lucky,
um,

436
00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:47.500
this is mid life.
You know,
that's fucking 40 forties,
80,
right?

437
00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:51.730
4,400 4,488.
The way I drink,
forget about it.
It's over.

438
00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:54.730
So there's something where you just kind of get to a point of like,

439
00:24:54.731 --> 00:24:58.850
am I going to be this angry?
I'm not saying you're angry,
but like am I on,

440
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.670
am I going to be like this?
Uh,
I,
I,

441
00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.830
<v 2>there's a certain point I won't let it go too well,
but I've gone to that.</v>

442
00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.660
I Hate Lebron.
Nobody is cornered me on Lebron.

443
00:25:08.661 --> 00:25:11.390
I haven't talked about him at all since you want to use to talk about him every

444
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.520
day?
I've just pretended it didn't exist after they won,

445
00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:17.510
but then you brought him up in the La thing.
I'm saying if I lived in La,

446
00:25:17.511 --> 00:25:21.080
I'm sure I would hate the Lakers more because you're from here and you're out

447
00:25:21.081 --> 00:25:24.180
with all those people.
But now that that there might be some truth to that,

448
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.063
but I think,

449
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:29.270
I think the general consensus right now for people living around here is is the

450
00:25:29.271 --> 00:25:31.450
heat and then I,
like you said right now and go in there,

451
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.080
just makes it a million times worse.

452
00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.720
<v 1>Well,
I look at Ray Allen like,
look,
we brought him here to do a job.
He did it.</v>

453
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:37.411
Okay.

454
00:25:37.411 --> 00:25:41.730
The guy was total class act and in the end he saw the other shoe was going to

455
00:25:41.731 --> 00:25:46.350
drop,
I felt and he didn't want to go out like that.
And it's,
I dunno,

456
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.930
<v 2>the outlet,
what they offered them.
You're,
you're,
you've been soft.</v>

457
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.220
You've been softened up I think by the La Sunshine.
Other foot,
other foot drop.

458
00:25:54.221 --> 00:25:55.054
Huh?

459
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.060
<v 1>I just look,
I think it's one of those things where you,</v>

460
00:25:58.061 --> 00:26:01.130
you feel like someone is slowly breaking up with you and you just say,

461
00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:04.040
you know what,
rather than go through another two years of this shit,

462
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:09.170
I'm going to leave.
Uh,
I,
I did my thing here.
I just,
you know what it is,

463
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.980
the thing about,
uh,
athletes is you always see the shit that they do,

464
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.190
but the owners for the most part in the shit that goes behind the scenes,

465
00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:19.070
those guys are faceless.
You know,
they're like the bankers.
No,

466
00:26:19.071 --> 00:26:21.290
I mad as I am about the fucking bankers.

467
00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:26.120
I can't put one face on anybody of who the fuck did this to this economy.

468
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.440
And I feel a lot of times that like,
like guys,
they just,
you know,
you're just,

469
00:26:30.441 --> 00:26:33.230
you're up.
You're out there hanging out to dry eye.

470
00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:37.400
Ray Allen was rail in nothing but a class act in Boston right up until he left.

471
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.600
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
So I look at like the has to be a fucking reason why he did that.

472
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.720
No,
I,
yeah,
he mom comes to the game.
Wholesome Guy,

473
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.830
not as selfish guy.
Well,
no,
I think he is a little bit of a selfish guy.

474
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.030
I think that while we're learning,

475
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.900
well I think the reasons they're saying it and come back is he was insulted by

476
00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:57.300
how hard they went after cagey,
but not him.

477
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:01.500
He was insulted that they weren't building the offense a little bit more around

478
00:27:01.501 --> 00:27:03.930
them.
I mean selfish,
nothing.
I don't think he said that.

479
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.540
He didn't use those words insulted.
He just said,

480
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:09.630
I felt there was a feeling right now what it's going through as the Boston

481
00:27:09.631 --> 00:27:13.540
sports blender and by the time it comes out the other fucking side and we'll all

482
00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:16.920
be like,
he said,
fuck thoughts.
But no,
he said in the thing like,

483
00:27:16.921 --> 00:27:19.140
my heart's always in Boston.
I don't care what you fucking do.

484
00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:23.300
How many teams are in the Mba?
26 I don't know.
30 30 yeah.

485
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.540
You picked the one that you can't go to.
You have just picked another one.

486
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.830
Like that's,
I don't look,
there are fucking expansion franchise.

487
00:27:31.831 --> 00:27:36.300
I don't even dignify the heat as like,
I haven't been to Miami Dude.

488
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.780
Yeah,
but I mean Lebron.
Then he went down.
I don't care about the fame.

489
00:27:39.781 --> 00:27:43.500
You think humidity is bad here and then you got fucking hurricanes and then half

490
00:27:43.501 --> 00:27:47.040
the fucking cities you're going to get into a Goddamn fucking gun fight if you

491
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:47.950
go to it and then,

492
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.640
then you go out to Miami beach for all these rich guys are and it's all these

493
00:27:50.641 --> 00:27:53.280
creepy fucking guys in 66 years old dress,

494
00:27:53.281 --> 00:27:56.790
head to toe and Linden was 10 year old checks.
Broaden that show.

495
00:27:56.791 --> 00:27:59.520
Talking about that.
I don't care about,
I don't think she was,

496
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.550
I don't care about the fans.
It's all Lebron.
I fucking hate Lebron.

497
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.180
I don't want him to win the fact he's going there and hit the big three.
I hate,

498
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.660
I hate fostered.
I hate all they complain about everything.

499
00:28:09.661 --> 00:28:11.340
Every other like the Pacers series,

500
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.850
all they did was say the pace who's taking cheap shots versus,

501
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.230
and there were mugging the pacers in the middle of it.

502
00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:21.720
Do we have any other topic?
That's what I think Dan based fixed.
Oh,
so do I.

503
00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.600
I thought for the longest time I said they were fixed and then they fucking came

504
00:28:24.601 --> 00:28:29.370
on.
I saw like Paul Versey right now,
dude,
I called it,
um,
the fucking,

505
00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.380
you know,
they end up having like a mob dup ref.

506
00:28:31.381 --> 00:28:35.020
Like if at the very least the thing that I can say is like they,

507
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.170
it is an unbelievably inconsistently officiate a game.

508
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.920
Like you have a watch go like a baseball game and like the strike zone is like

509
00:28:43.921 --> 00:28:48.510
what the fuck?
Right.
But it's what the fuck?
The whole,
the whole game.
Okay.

510
00:28:48.511 --> 00:28:52.290
So by the time you get up,
second time,
maybe third time he kinda got,
okay,

511
00:28:52.291 --> 00:28:55.770
this guy's calling them really fucking low or he's calling that outside thing.

512
00:28:55.771 --> 00:28:58.260
I don't know if it's the way he's standing,
but it's consistent.

513
00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:02.700
Like when I became convinced that it was fixed,
I went to the Celtics Utah game,

514
00:29:02.701 --> 00:29:05.100
the one where Gardner had a twisted,

515
00:29:05.101 --> 00:29:09.450
his knee messed up his need for that season and I was watching the game and I

516
00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:11.670
swear to God,
watch that tape.

517
00:29:11.671 --> 00:29:15.840
There are moments where you can literally take somebody's head off,
no call.

518
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:18.570
And then like five minutes later you even look at a guy,

519
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.600
there's a file and then to that knee that you pulling on the reins,

520
00:29:21.601 --> 00:29:25.400
letting it go upon a that is,
that is totally,
yeah,
that's shaving points.
Yeah.

521
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.220
Bluechip Timmy.
Yeah,
and I mean obviously the Celtics heat,

522
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.100
not to keep harping on it,
but the call,
they didn't call and Rondo,

523
00:29:32.101 --> 00:29:35.690
I mean really changed the whole series at the end the game too.
Oh,

524
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:40.540
and then Wade went down.
They call,
I mean there was a dunk or was it,

525
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:44.950
I mean it from Celtics with 45 seconds or would have been up to,

526
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.780
to down to with 45 seconds.
Set the defense.
Bad Memories,

527
00:29:49.781 --> 00:29:53.230
bad memories,
the whole thing.
Like I said,
I walked it out on my mind.

528
00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:57.880
I just got to look,
I'm not worried about the Miami Heat and the too,

529
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.010
I hope like,
I just don't want the Lakers,

530
00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:03.250
first of all the Lakers count of Ba Championship as,

531
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:08.180
as you're worried about like the total franchise record.
You know what?

532
00:30:08.181 --> 00:30:11.650
And you know what he'd really is do is I sit in la and there's the sports show.

533
00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.070
It is the worst fucking sports show on TV and always comes on after the Lakers

534
00:30:15.071 --> 00:30:16.390
games.
Like just when I was like in New York,

535
00:30:16.391 --> 00:30:19.390
I used to always watch the Yankees root against them and I watched the Lakers,

536
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:24.391
I root against the Lakers and at the end of the fucking a Lakers game,

537
00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:29.260
this is show it's Michael Cooper.
Uh,
uh,
what,
what's his face?

538
00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:32.320
Reggie Miller's sister Cheryl and this,

539
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:35.950
this Asian dude and it is the worst fucking sports show.

540
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.390
They're trying to be like edgy.

541
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:40.600
Like when the Celtics got knocked out by the heat,
Michael Cooper came on,

542
00:30:40.601 --> 00:30:42.560
he had these yellows,
giant silly sunglasses.

543
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.140
He had these giant green ones on and he's like,

544
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:51.130
I'm wearing these and I'm taking him off to show that the Celtic season is over

545
00:30:51.131 --> 00:30:52.300
and some stupid stuff like that.

546
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.330
And like I would love to tell that guy one day it's like,

547
00:30:55.331 --> 00:30:56.920
this is going to break your heart.
Michael.

548
00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.400
I know you think that you are part of the Celtics Lakers rivalry,

549
00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:03.400
but no Boston fan has nightmares about Michael Cooper.

550
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:06.610
They have nightmares about worthy magic.
Kareem.

551
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:10.300
Those gave us nightmares in the 80s but all,
when I think of Michael Cooper,

552
00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:14.700
I think of a guy he can suck,
but he was a guy that sucks.
Sucks.
Who?

553
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.890
Who does socks?
Always socks.
That's all I think of Michael Cooper.

554
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.180
I think of a guy who thought for half a second he could block Dr j and that
dunk.

555
00:31:22.181 --> 00:31:24.940
He was like,
I can do it.
Oh no I can't.
And he got dunked on.

556
00:31:24.941 --> 00:31:26.830
So I think maybe that's what it is.

557
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:31.950
That's why my hatred of the was so ridiculous and then tone down because it's

558
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:33.160
where you live.
Yeah.

559
00:31:33.161 --> 00:31:37.570
And I go to sports bars and New York wasn't as bad because they could actually

560
00:31:37.571 --> 00:31:39.190
talk the game after they gave you shit.

561
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:43.900
La is really bad because it never gets beyond like,
you know,
Celtics a bitches,

562
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:47.770
you guys suck.
Go Lakers MVP.

563
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:53.010
Like it never goes into actually talking to the game where like with Yankee
fans,

564
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.630
those guys to talk baseball,
I'll give that up to them.
They know the game,

565
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:59.320
they can talk it and uh,
I just,
it drives me fucking nuts.

566
00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:03.490
You're going to be interviewing you listen,
venting.
You got Lakers,

567
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:07.660
you got la like in your,
in your brain.
I don't think.

568
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.460
I think if you pull people around here right now,
nine out of 10 if you could.

569
00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.670
That's really interesting.
I,
I actually believe it now.

570
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.450
So the way to ask the question I guess is if the,

571
00:32:19.451 --> 00:32:22.750
he played the Lakers and the finals this past year,
who would you root for it?

572
00:32:22.751 --> 00:32:26.050
We put it on the blog.
It was almost universal.
He,
I mean,

573
00:32:26.051 --> 00:32:27.820
Lakers people want the Lakers.
You don't want to,

574
00:32:27.821 --> 00:32:29.800
because Colby already had his titles.
These,

575
00:32:29.801 --> 00:32:33.340
there's nothing when a guy wins his first,
like when Peyton manning one is for,

576
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:36.720
it's like once you win one,
you can't ever take it back.
You know what?

577
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:42.020
They don't hate Lebron.
No,
I don't.
He didn't,
he didn't say,
Ooh,

578
00:32:42.021 --> 00:32:45.530
maybe I'm going to come to Boston.
He didn't the guy,
look,

579
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:50.450
I think the guy like,
uh,
he had,
he had something that he had to get over.

580
00:32:50.451 --> 00:32:53.540
He had to get overtaken the shot at the end of the end of the,
uh,

581
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.960
end of the game and I felt during the Celtic series he took that shot at the end

582
00:32:56.961 --> 00:32:59.840
of regulation and like gain five or six against six.

583
00:32:59.841 --> 00:33:02.240
He destroyed us in game five.
I forgot what game was.

584
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:06.340
He took it and he missed and my body goes see fucking us by mile.
Yeah,

585
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.000
I thought he climbed it off the rent.

586
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:12.080
But my thing is is he had the balls to test like a breakthrough.
You got to,

587
00:33:12.081 --> 00:33:14.880
and you know,
we didn't go in,
but he,
he did it.
And then for the rest of that,

588
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.280
you know,
that championship run,
the guy didn't,

589
00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:22.350
<v 2>she didn't believe it.
The Lebron podcasts buddy.
I mean that's the show me.</v>

590
00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.220
He didn't put some on the back on his back.

591
00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.730
He had the balls to take the last shot.

592
00:33:27.731 --> 00:33:31.030
When people are saying he's the best player and like the history of basketball.

593
00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.870
Now.
I'm not saying a lot of people say that.
I mean they compare them to Jordan.

594
00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:38.680
You didn't say it,
but you said he had the balls.
Well,
when I watch ESPN,

595
00:33:38.681 --> 00:33:40.680
I don't listen to what they say.
Like they,
they're,

596
00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.030
their deal is the deal is to sell the game.
Yeah.

597
00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.340
So they're all going to go skip Bayless and just say time.
It'd be say whatever.

598
00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.310
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm not saying he's not one of the greats.
Uh,

599
00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.670
all of that ship off me three times VP before he wanted anything,

600
00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:59.560
but now we want anything even.
What do they win?
I mean,
what did they,

601
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:04.330
what did they win with Cleveland?
They went to the finals.
Dude,
who cares what?

602
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:05.290
They have a list.

603
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.460
Do you think a Cleveland Fan can't even give him credit for going to the fucking

604
00:34:09.461 --> 00:34:13.900
finals and add white to walk into Cleveland at any fancy?
What do you,

605
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:17.320
are you glad Lebron James Ever played for you?
Fuck No.

606
00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.660
None of that's important because he left his hometown.
Treat them like dirt.
He's,

607
00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:26.520
he's the Anti Christ though.
He isn't.
He's a,
I don't look,

608
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.890
I think he got really bad advice.
Some idiot agent goes,
you know,

609
00:34:29.891 --> 00:34:34.891
be a great idea is if you make cities beg for you and then sit and talk about it

610
00:34:35.051 --> 00:34:37.740
for a fucking,
like not even a half an hour

611
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.500
<v 1>or whoever would,
I think it was like Dad,
the guy we interviewed them.</v>

612
00:34:39.501 --> 00:34:42.970
It was like his idea,
whoever the fuck was around him,
he should have got fired.

613
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:44.720
There's so many stories out there.

614
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.740
They didn't see that with him being just an ass.
Well,

615
00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:52.180
until I got to hang out with somebody and see them being asked before I sign off

616
00:34:52.181 --> 00:34:56.860
on that.
But uh,
um,
yes.
All right.
Let me ask you this.
Going around,
uh,

617
00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.930
is uh,
another thing,
the Patriots with Bob Craft,
right?

618
00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.770
<v 2>That's our video with that.
That was your video.
He broke that video.</v>

619
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:07.000
You broke that video,
correct?
Yeah.
That was sent to us.
Well,

620
00:35:07.001 --> 00:35:09.550
I haven't revealed how that was sent to us.
A lot of people vast,

621
00:35:09.551 --> 00:35:13.090
but the person who sent it ass anyways.
Yeah,
we got that video.
We got that.
Um,

622
00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:15.040
we broke it the night before in the morning.

623
00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.540
<v 1>So that guy,
I was actually,
how do you feel,
not that you guy,</v>

624
00:35:19.541 --> 00:35:24.160
you guys big enough at this point where people like sports places and stuff are

625
00:35:24.161 --> 00:35:26.730
coming to your sites?
Like,
like looking at it,
right?

626
00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:31.060
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
stuff in our world,
in blogging world there,</v>

627
00:35:31.061 --> 00:35:35.180
there's maybe like,
there's a handful of sites that kind of all in our range,

628
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:39.440
so something gets posted on one of it's,
it will go everywhere because,

629
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.390
yeah,
because enough of the bigger sites I'll end up with it and then it'll,

630
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.170
I mean like channel seven interviewed me about it yesterday.

631
00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:48.870
They came over and we got credit,
you know,
just like anything,

632
00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:52.020
I'm sure with jokes even,
um,
you know,
it,

633
00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:54.120
it comes a free for all for people trying to kick.

634
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:58.170
How long did it take you to go from that?
Uh,
and this is how we interviewed two.

635
00:35:58.171 --> 00:36:00.940
I go all over the fucking place.
So let's go back to that new speech.

636
00:36:00.941 --> 00:36:04.620
Said you were handing out that was a newspaper.
If yes,
how long did it take you?

637
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.170
Um,
and,

638
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:10.380
and how long did it take you to go from that to actually seeing like some sort

639
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:13.950
of like movement,
like this could actually start going?
Yeah.
You know,

640
00:36:13.951 --> 00:36:17.190
it was one of those things,
we did the newspaper,
uh,

641
00:36:17.191 --> 00:36:21.500
for about three years before the website.
Then the website came and it was in,

642
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.480
you won't be a c on the podcast,
but it's like a slight slope.

643
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.000
I always looked at it like it was,
you know,

644
00:36:27.001 --> 00:36:30.960
the times or it's like very close to make him not having to shut down.

645
00:36:30.961 --> 00:36:33.960
Even took a job because it was a full time job,

646
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:38.070
but I took another one and no money.
Yeah,
exactly.
So the Internet,
yeah.

647
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.940
I had to take another one.
I lasted like one day because I just couldn't do it,

648
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:47.000
but it was always a slow rape joke.
You wore a tank top,
they're like,

649
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:51.570
who is this fucking guy?
Um,
so it was always a slight growth and it just,

650
00:36:51.571 --> 00:36:54.570
in my heart it was like,
it always felt like it was growing.

651
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.260
And then I don't know what happened.
People ask me that all the time.
Like,

652
00:36:58.261 --> 00:37:00.390
when did you realize you kind of were over the hump?

653
00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:05.010
And I think the number one thing that happened that I started realizing is the

654
00:37:05.011 --> 00:37:07.860
more I'd go out Boston people would be like,
Hey Prez,
what's going on?
You know,

655
00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:11.640
that's my nickname on the,
on the hand on the thing.
And that's what it was like,

656
00:37:11.641 --> 00:37:16.260
Huh.
Maybe you know,
it's starting to work and it,
it just kind of continued.

657
00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:19.020
And we've always,
as in terms of making money on the Internet,

658
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.650
I mean we've always been good at,
we're so small,

659
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:26.120
it's not just advertising and I'll try and fucking anything like [inaudible] and

660
00:37:26.121 --> 00:37:28.770
we'll be aggressive and risk to go different areas.

661
00:37:28.771 --> 00:37:32.370
So like the concert thing isn't really an internet thing where less at the

662
00:37:32.371 --> 00:37:36.210
riskiest thing you'd say that you've done.
Yeah,
probably other than starting it.

663
00:37:36.211 --> 00:37:39.060
Like we in value investing a decent amount to start it just to buy,

664
00:37:39.061 --> 00:37:42.690
look those news racks that you put in the street and to pay for the printing of

665
00:37:42.691 --> 00:37:45.150
the paper.
But you know,
I had a sales background,

666
00:37:45.151 --> 00:37:48.210
so I called up all the casinos and offshore.

667
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.380
So like at you ever heard of like party poker?
Uh,

668
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.440
it's one of the big online poker places.
Like when you see it on ESPN,

669
00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:57.990
all the guys are wearing either party poker,
poker stars.

670
00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:01.800
Like we met with those guys in Vegas.
I met a couple of Indian guys.

671
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:05.280
They just built like a frigging a computer program for it.

672
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:09.180
So we were in with them and the beginning and we had enough money to last like a

673
00:38:09.181 --> 00:38:13.110
year or two.
And then I just Kinda,
people are always look,
I like the Quirky Shit.

674
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:17.010
Like I never intended to be a writer or a character on the blog.

675
00:38:17.011 --> 00:38:21.390
It just Kinda just kinda developed,
which I think when people ask me,

676
00:38:21.391 --> 00:38:25.040
I think that's why it's Kinda successful because there was no plan to it.
Right?

677
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.210
Necessarily.
It wasn't like my podcast,
I had no plan.

678
00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.030
I just started doing them and then all of a sudden it just,

679
00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.250
it just sorta you find your way with it.

680
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:36.670
But I at least I had like stand up to fall on.
So during those two years,

681
00:38:36.671 --> 00:38:37.690
the ups and downs of it,

682
00:38:37.691 --> 00:38:40.360
were you having like those nights with like your thoughts awaken you up?

683
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:42.770
Like what the fuck am I doing?
Those thoughts?
I mean,

684
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:46.840
I still have those thoughts and we did a tour last year with this guy,

685
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:50.770
Mike Posner,
who,
uh,
he's writing like Bieber songs now,
so he's doing well,

686
00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:54.430
but I fucking hate them.
Like poison.
I mean,
no one was coming to see the shows.

687
00:38:54.431 --> 00:38:57.480
We invested so much in it.
I thought,
I thought we were going to,

688
00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.940
how many promoters is saying that about me?
Red handed,
fucking town.

689
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:05.740
And so two tickets.
That's how the promoter fucking fields,
that's how I felt.

690
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.440
And it's like,
I want to throw,
I always make it right.
This guy,

691
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:12.670
I always try and I always make it.
If ever I'm doing good right now,
you know,

692
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:17.590
it took me 20 fucking years.
But um,
back in the day,
you know,
I always,

693
00:39:17.591 --> 00:39:22.390
if I ever had any sort of guarantee like Michael Jackson did with the Sullivan

694
00:39:22.391 --> 00:39:26.380
family when that closed down and they made a reason,
they lost the Patriots.
Yeah.

695
00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:26.921
But I mean,

696
00:39:26.921 --> 00:39:30.940
it's really the city of Foxborough worried that this little fucking 80 pound man

697
00:39:30.941 --> 00:39:32.890
was going to somehow come there and scare of your buddy.

698
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:37.510
So the Foxboro canceled the concert and then,

699
00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:40.120
uh,
well they didn't have it.
Michael Jackson is like,
well,

700
00:39:40.121 --> 00:39:42.130
you were supposed to pay me whether they perform or not.

701
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:46.000
And then the Sullivan family who owned the Patriots back in the 80s had to end

702
00:39:46.001 --> 00:39:48.970
up selling it and they sold norelco razor guy.
Well,

703
00:39:48.971 --> 00:39:51.520
they sponsored the whole fucking toward not just here.

704
00:39:51.521 --> 00:39:54.130
They had the whole Michael Jackson tour,
which isn't debacle.

705
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.280
Like I remember reading the finance is one of our writers,
uh,

706
00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:01.180
Jerry Thornton road.
Uh,
he's best pager writer in the city.
He's awesome.

707
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.120
And he wrote a great piece on that whole thing.
Um,
but yeah,
the,

708
00:40:06.121 --> 00:40:10.480
the promoter thing,
promoters,
I mean,
that's a tough racket.
Like we,

709
00:40:10.481 --> 00:40:12.340
the thing that we switched with our black out,

710
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:16.090
we used to have to pay the talent and now we don't,
like we,

711
00:40:16.091 --> 00:40:18.400
we just use kind of our name,
the bar stool.

712
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.050
And these kids had just rented a party.

713
00:40:20.051 --> 00:40:22.990
So that takes a huge risk but deal not only that,

714
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:26.980
dealing with some of these guys,
like you don't have to name any name,
no name,

715
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:30.000
any names,
but I don't know what,
give me a bad story.
And some,

716
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:34.170
some artists comes in.
I mean it's got,
well I already named names,
but uh,

717
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:37.120
you know,
you don't seem to have a problem.

718
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:40.270
Like I usually try to,
uh,

719
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.240
I don't have a problem naming is,
I don't,

720
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:46.480
I feel like we're pretty straight with everybody and people fucking trash us if

721
00:40:46.481 --> 00:40:49.930
they want to.
But I'll,
I won't trash anybody who doesn't deserve to be trashed.

722
00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:53.590
The only reason I said him,
he does it well,
we have this entity does.
Okay,

723
00:40:53.591 --> 00:40:56.710
so he goes out.
He didn't,
it's not like he's not trying to sell tickets.

724
00:40:56.711 --> 00:40:59.140
He must've gone above and beyond.
No,
he didn't.

725
00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:02.870
He wasn't like tweeting about the contracts,
helping to promote it.
Oh yeah.

726
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.100
Well then yeah,
go fuck yourself.
I show up and it's like,
we'll lose and you know,

727
00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:08.950
close to six figures and you're telling me in the green room you want like

728
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:12.220
fucking prime rib and shit.
It's like,
I'm losing my shirt.

729
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:16.750
You want a hundred green towels?
It's like,
you know what,
fucking yeah,
go,

730
00:41:16.751 --> 00:41:19.720
go buy some.
Yeah.
Have,
have a slice of pizza and call it a day.

731
00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:24.670
I'm getting murdered here.
So it's shit like that.
But do you know,
as a performer,

732
00:41:24.671 --> 00:41:27.880
you know,
you know,
like back in the day,
you know,

733
00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:31.230
going in whether you sell tickets because they used to try and shoot,

734
00:41:31.231 --> 00:41:33.980
I did this fucking,
it was early days of my space

735
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:37.370
<v 1>and they would just slam and tours together because of like the Dane Cook thing.</v>

736
00:41:37.371 --> 00:41:38.600
Everyone was watching going,
oh my God,

737
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.290
he blew up on my space and they just thought it was a,
what I think of him.

738
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.000
Can you not say that on your,
uh,
do you think he's funny?
Yeah.

739
00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:49.070
You just fucking great and that he really takes,
it takes a beat eight.
Yeah,

740
00:41:49.071 --> 00:41:53.720
he took it and unnecessary fucking beating.
But they're just,
it's just,

741
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:58.040
it's part of unfortunately going into the public eye,

742
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:02.290
everybody at some point is going to get beat down.
You know,
it all,

743
00:42:02.291 --> 00:42:05.090
it all just depends.
You could just take fucking,
you know,

744
00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.940
one shot a month to the jaw for your entire career.

745
00:42:07.941 --> 00:42:10.820
It's still a shot to the family.
It happens all the fucking time.
People send me,

746
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:12.410
I try not to read emails,

747
00:42:12.411 --> 00:42:15.410
but I have to read them because I got to keep up on this stuff.
But like people,

748
00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.840
you know,
if you're in the wrong mood and you don't have your defenses up,

749
00:42:17.841 --> 00:42:22.680
they can trash it.
But he had a whole other fucking level.
Um,
yeah dude.

750
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:27.740
I'm like,
I'm you,
you have strong Boston Street street credibility.

751
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.940
Like w are our readers are officials.
And this moment though,
dude,

752
00:42:31.941 --> 00:42:35.990
after this they'll probably be like that fucking Douche support and Lebron.

753
00:42:35.991 --> 00:42:38.840
Fuck him.
I'll never go to another one of his shows.
It's like,
it's,

754
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.760
it's not something that you can,
uh,
you can,
you can really control.
So,
um,

755
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.830
but like back in the day when I,
when I would go to do like those studies show,

756
00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:47.960
they try and try and put together this,

757
00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:51.170
my space touring and then this is the whole tour.
It was just like,
well,

758
00:42:51.171 --> 00:42:52.850
you got 10,000 friends.

759
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
He has 15 and you got eight so together that's like 30 something we can go play

760
00:42:58.221 --> 00:42:59.500
2000 seat theaters.

761
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:04.510
Like that was the thought process and there was no link between the two?

762
00:43:04.731 --> 00:43:06.080
No through line.
Like you know when they,

763
00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:07.430
when they do to try to package it and sign,

764
00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.400
can you put like a fucking bluegrass guy with a,
with a death metal band?

765
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.630
There was no through line.
So we would show up some of the venues we did.
Okay.

766
00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:18.320
And the ones that we did and we would walk in,
nobody would say hello to us.

767
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.140
That'd be like one fucking bottle of Snapple in the back.

768
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.570
And you'd look out and there'd be these bunch of people out there and they're

769
00:43:23.571 --> 00:43:26.870
like,
this is paper.
They papered the room,
which to people outside the business,

770
00:43:26.871 --> 00:43:28.420
that means they gave it away.
They just a,

771
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:31.520
they gave away free tickets to try to get people to come in there and drink so

772
00:43:31.521 --> 00:43:34.070
they can make some of that money back and a,

773
00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.950
those are the nights you or even meet the fucking promoter if you do,

774
00:43:36.951 --> 00:43:41.030
it's for like two seconds.
So we had a story.
All right.

775
00:43:41.031 --> 00:43:44.980
We did a concert and again,
this is the same.
Poor again,

776
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:47.810
fucking a bloodbath and one of the acts,

777
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:53.140
one of the accident show up and we're in the back room in the guy who was tour

778
00:43:53.211 --> 00:43:55.320
manager comes in and says they,

779
00:43:55.380 --> 00:44:00.380
they said the main guy wouldn't go on stage unless I gave him four grand cash on

780
00:44:01.621 --> 00:44:06.260
the spot on the fucking spot.
Why would you do that?
Exactly.

781
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:06.930
That's,

782
00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:11.510
that's the stuff that I actually made a video coming home from that because I

783
00:44:11.511 --> 00:44:15.530
was so mad like I,
I just took the flip cam still.
This guy hadn't,

784
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.950
wasn't even selling tickets.
No.
That's the thing.
We were,
let me ask you this.

785
00:44:18.951 --> 00:44:21.440
What if he was selling one?
If he sold the place out,

786
00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.970
you'll make an off suck your Dick.
I feel like I would do,

787
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.270
if you're selling out,
I will treat you in.

788
00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.070
I'll still treat you good even if you aren't,
but I expect some

789
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:36.510
<v 2>concession on the other end.
At what point do you know?
I will just say,</v>

790
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:41.070
let's say a 2000 seater.
How far before the Gig do you know you're taking a bath?

791
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.140
Do you like this?
This motherfucker got,

792
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:46.790
some people have a lot of walk up traffic like last second.
We don't,

793
00:44:46.791 --> 00:44:51.390
we haven't typically.
Occasionally we do.
Um,
you know,

794
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:55.230
we've done now enough of these where we'd been to the same places.

795
00:44:55.231 --> 00:45:00.231
So if we've been at house of Blues Boston and we do a show how it sells,

796
00:45:00.331 --> 00:45:03.630
there is pretty indicated of,
you know,
of how it will do across.

797
00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:07.380
So it's like if we fucked up and then sell anything at loopholes,

798
00:45:07.381 --> 00:45:11.310
which is 1900 and providence and then I know we're dead.
Well,

799
00:45:11.311 --> 00:45:15.240
let me ask you what a manager say when you call up that client hasn't sold any

800
00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:18.660
tickets yet.
The clients still wants the money.
What do they say to you?

801
00:45:18.661 --> 00:45:21.930
Do they ever go,
I know he's out of his fucking mind,
but now they have a tap out.

802
00:45:21.931 --> 00:45:26.650
They don't know.
They're not,
not to me,
they haven't,
um,
an agency we do.

803
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:31.020
We got,
and just dealing with stuff that we never dealt with.

804
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:35.490
And you know,
I almost like the interview.
I talked to agents like,
oh yeah,

805
00:45:35.491 --> 00:45:38.310
how much,
like,
we don't negotiate what I trust you,
you trust me.

806
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:43.510
And they would just take me with like a big club,
like that old game boy for,
uh,

807
00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:48.410
for whatever that system was and bashed me over the head with it.
So,
you know,
I,

808
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:52.460
I'm jaded.
I am tough to deal with now for those people because it's like,
I,

809
00:45:52.461 --> 00:45:57.240
I'm so,
I'm so on edge and just ready to snap on people.

810
00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.660
So I almost need a buffer zone.
I almost need a buffer zone.

811
00:46:00.661 --> 00:46:05.460
I didn't know that we could ever have talent anymore because it's,
it just,

812
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:09.210
it was,
it drove me nuts.
And being an agent sucks too.
You gotta like,

813
00:46:09.211 --> 00:46:13.800
just constantly be,
you know,
kissing her right now what the scope of you get.

814
00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:15.720
You have your website and you have this,
this,
uh,

815
00:46:15.721 --> 00:46:18.450
a blackout tour that you're doing.
Um,

816
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:22.950
I don't even know if we even like talked to people about Barstool sports.com and

817
00:46:22.951 --> 00:46:27.460
it's just,
it's like,
no,
I said,
we have talked about it.
It's funny you did enough.

818
00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:30.990
What did they say?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'm saying on this podcast,

819
00:46:30.991 --> 00:46:34.730
we haven't talked about it at all.
And just for,
you know,

820
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:37.770
people who are new to this,
because it seems to me that,
you know,

821
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.770
the fact that you're in Boston then New York and Philly and now soon to be in

822
00:46:40.771 --> 00:46:45.600
Chicago,
that eventually you're going to have one in all.
Uh,
yeah,
we'd like to,

823
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:46.470
uh,
you know,

824
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:50.280
our hardest thing in which I underestimated when I started this thing,

825
00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:54.900
it's really hard for us to find the people,
the people.
I liked the writing.

826
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.690
It's a,
like we,
we've been lucky.
I shouldn't say lucky.

827
00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.850
Can People send you shift?
Always want,
we're always looking for where is that?

828
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.160
Cause I know like as a blah,
I talk sports a lot,

829
00:47:05.161 --> 00:47:07.080
so I have a lot of sports fans and I gotta tell you,
man,

830
00:47:07.081 --> 00:47:10.410
people send me some stuff and I get some funny emails and like,

831
00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:14.400
people send me questions and shit and like,
like,
uh,
the,

832
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:17.480
there's some really funny people out there.
So that's what we're looking for.

833
00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:22.290
Tips at Barstool,
sports.com.
Just that they want to write.

834
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:26.790
All we asked for samples.
Gips.
Yeah,
like I'm not gonna sit there.

835
00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:29.860
A lot of people,
we get a lot of this like hire me.
I'm great.

836
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.420
Like I'm not even a reply to that.

837
00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:35.200
But if you are serious just send like look at our site for a minute.

838
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.860
Be like this is how they write and send us a sample of what you think would
work.

839
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:42.310
If it's good I will 100% get back to you.
We're always looking for writers,

840
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.600
always looking for new cities.

841
00:47:43.601 --> 00:47:47.570
I mean I was looking for Chicago for three years before we finally found a guy I

842
00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:51.150
thought could do it and it's just one guy.
You start with like a half dozen.

843
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:56.470
We start with a half dozen.
I wish we a is one guy basically runs per city.

844
00:47:56.590 --> 00:48:00.220
So you're their job requirements really to post a new blog,
which is like,

845
00:48:00.221 --> 00:48:00.521
I don't know,

846
00:48:00.521 --> 00:48:04.990
a paragraph or two current events type thing every from nine o'clock in the

847
00:48:04.991 --> 00:48:08.110
morning to basically five at night.
I mean it's a grind.
Beats a real job,

848
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:09.550
but it's,
it's a lot of writing.

849
00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.880
You have to come up with a paragraph of funny shit.
It's basically,

850
00:48:12.881 --> 00:48:16.750
I mean we're like current events so it's will you scour the Internet looking for

851
00:48:16.751 --> 00:48:20.080
weird shit,
whether it be sports or just,
you know,

852
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:23.530
I'm trying to think of a weird one of your favorite weird stories that you guys

853
00:48:23.531 --> 00:48:26.080
kind of where we have so many weird ones.
Like what's,

854
00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:28.180
what's the latest one that you guys do that today?

855
00:48:28.181 --> 00:48:33.181
Even in Wrentham I don't like they banned American flags and rent them because

856
00:48:33.371 --> 00:48:36.580
somebody complain that there were too many American flags on the 4th of July.

857
00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:42.490
So they banned them totally out.
I need,
can you do that?

858
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.880
I guess?
I guess so.
I mean that's a pretty weird stories,
right?

859
00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.330
So what now what if I have a Taliban flag,

860
00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:52.690
there's nothing in there so we can have a bunch of those fucking home.

861
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:54.730
And she was saying that it was the,
I should clarify,

862
00:48:54.731 --> 00:48:58.310
it was the Weymouth housing authority.
So it was like in I guess the,

863
00:48:58.311 --> 00:49:02.740
the subsidized housing.
But I mean I could go look at this thing.
There's so many.

864
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:07.150
I mean I know there was a story about the check with the biggest tits and the

865
00:49:07.151 --> 00:49:09.990
history of the world.
They were just huge black aluminum,

866
00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:13.450
the saggy titties to the ground.
I mean there's literally,
that's,

867
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:18.570
that's the beauty of the Internet is whenever you think you've run out a weird

868
00:49:18.731 --> 00:49:23.530
stuff,
there's,
there's always more.
We're going to be something else.
Well,

869
00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:27.310
I'll give you an example of a,
I answer questions every week.
You want to,

870
00:49:27.311 --> 00:49:30.040
you want to like people actually for some fucking reason,

871
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.970
<v 1>like ask me advice.
I don't know why I like,
I can't,</v>

872
00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:37.630
I'm not good at reading out loud.
I,
I'm,
I'm a moron,

873
00:49:37.631 --> 00:49:41.830
but for some reason they asked me stories.
So this is girl with interesting past.

874
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:46.240
Uh,
all right,
so I'm going to need your expert advice on something.
I'm an expert.

875
00:49:46.241 --> 00:49:47.650
I've been currently,
cause I have a podcast.

876
00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:50.500
I really should start doing like some sort of disclaimer before I do these

877
00:49:50.501 --> 00:49:53.260
before somebody tries to sue me.
Uh,
okay.
Recently,

878
00:49:53.261 --> 00:49:56.530
I moved back home after college and started seeing a girl who went to my high

879
00:49:56.531 --> 00:49:59.860
school,
but who I never really talked to.
Things were going great.

880
00:49:59.861 --> 00:50:04.360
She's really funny for a broad,
uh,
pretty cute,
not to mention a,

881
00:50:04.361 --> 00:50:05.350
has a heightened,

882
00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:10.750
say mentioned has as heightened of a sex drive is I do.
Well,

883
00:50:10.751 --> 00:50:11.960
maybe that's where the problem lied.

884
00:50:11.961 --> 00:50:15.370
So I was telling my high school buddies how I started seeing this girl and

885
00:50:15.371 --> 00:50:19.880
thought she was a,
the bee's knees.
Um,
he just lost a range up.
Um,

886
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:22.960
that's when one of my pals said,
wait,
you know,

887
00:50:22.961 --> 00:50:26.560
me and Steve and another childhood friend of mine smoked a bowl,

888
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.160
an Eiffel tower,

889
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:32.120
towered her in the back of a minivan a couple of years ago.

890
00:50:32.121 --> 00:50:35.270
This is like one of these dirty Sanchez.
Thanks Eiffel Tower.

891
00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:38.720
I don't know what an Eiffel Tower do you not?
Let me try to guess.
Let's see.

892
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:41.750
The Eiffel Tower.
It's when you,
you,
uh,

893
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:46.070
you build an Eiffel tower with an erector set and you stick it in her ass while

894
00:50:46.071 --> 00:50:49.920
you,
uh,
where Baret it.
It's like a,

895
00:50:49.921 --> 00:50:53.810
you make two dudes making the Eiffel Tower this way.
She's in the middle.

896
00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.170
Oh,
okay.
That's right.
I think I heard that one.

897
00:50:57.410 --> 00:51:01.400
Isn't that more like the London Bridge?
It may be that the Eiffel Tower.
Okay.

898
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:05.420
Anyway,
so now I have an issue,
the girl,
so basically these two guys,

899
00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:09.050
they smoked a joint and they a bowl and they fucking two on wonder if that God

900
00:51:09.051 --> 00:51:11.150
you are here.
Cause he's,
he said that like,

901
00:51:11.151 --> 00:51:15.020
I fucking knew urban dictionary whenever,
when,
when in doubt,

902
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:18.790
I'm one of those guys.
The Internet scares me.
Um,
so now I have an issue.

903
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:19.700
The girls great.

904
00:51:19.701 --> 00:51:23.630
But knowing two of my close childhood friends once penetrated her at the same

905
00:51:23.631 --> 00:51:27.740
time,
uh,
kind of puts a damper on things.
He says pretty gay,

906
00:51:27.741 --> 00:51:29.210
which I kind of have to go along with.

907
00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:33.540
I never understood the two guys with one girl.
Oh well I,
yeah,

908
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:38.390
I've asked about this,
that,
that's sort of like a,
like if you cross swords,

909
00:51:38.391 --> 00:51:41.420
I think then you become gay.
I don't think you can become gay,

910
00:51:41.421 --> 00:51:45.710
but I think that you're easing engine to being gay.
Yeah,
no,
I,

911
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.220
you know what I'm saying?
I'm just saying this is what I look like.
Okay.

912
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.500
I'm going to hook up with the girl.

913
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:56.920
The only thing they could enhance that is either another girl or like,

914
00:51:57.141 --> 00:52:00.360
I dunno.
Fucking good fellas playing in the backroom picks up there.
No,

915
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:02.930
I even then,
I don't want to hear Joe [inaudible] voices on fucking,

916
00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:07.130
so to add another,
all you did was add another dick.
You know what?

917
00:52:07.131 --> 00:52:11.390
I think it's either it's either gay or it's like you just,

918
00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:15.770
it doesn't mean you have to show heterosexual that you could just fucking

919
00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:20.390
hydrive.
No,
I'm firmly,
I,
I've said that I'm not a believer.

920
00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:24.950
Yeah,
no,
I really don't.
I don't want it to two on one guy.

921
00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:28.130
But this guy's question is this question whether he's got dumped this girl,

922
00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:31.880
I think,
I think that's where we're going here.
What should I do?

923
00:52:31.881 --> 00:52:33.650
Should I cut off cold Turkey?
You said bring it up.

924
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.860
He said it'd be the better person.
Say I have.
Fuck it.
Who Cares?
I'm no puritan.

925
00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.350
Thanks bill.
Love your podcast.
All right.
First of all,

926
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:43.490
this girl must be fucking the shit out of this guy that he's even asking this

927
00:52:43.491 --> 00:52:48.150
question or is brutally ugly,
something something going on it.

928
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.720
I like,
okay.
I think you already answered the question.

929
00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:54.020
[inaudible] should you break up with this girl?
Look,
the honest thing is,

930
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:57.170
is if you don't give a fuck and you actually liked this girl and then I'd stay

931
00:52:57.171 --> 00:52:58.250
with their personally,

932
00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:03.410
just every time I would go to kiss her just picture,
you know,

933
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:07.870
it's fucking two of my friends high fiving over or doing are going to be able to

934
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:12.770
Jose Conseco fucking Mark Maguire,
the forearm smash.
Yeah.
There's,

935
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.500
there's no fucking way.
No,
that's one of the all time,

936
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:18.770
no brainers in the history of earth.
That would be a deal breaker.
I had a guy,

937
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:23.060
a guy wrote in a few weeks ago,
said he,
he met some girl perfect.
And you know,

938
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:27.260
gorgeous,
great personality,
funny,
all that fucking shit.
And then,
uh,

939
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:32.270
at the end he signed out that she did a little bit of porn and uh,

940
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:35.460
and he broke up with her and he felt fucking bad about it.
But I just,

941
00:53:35.461 --> 00:53:38.760
it's just one of those things that would bother me a heck of a lot less than the

942
00:53:38.761 --> 00:53:41.010
Eiffel tower scenario that this guy just laid out.

943
00:53:41.011 --> 00:53:43.930
So what are you saying this then?
It's your,
it's your buddies.
You're what?

944
00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.700
You're going to fucking watch a football game.
I,
it's,

945
00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:51.160
you get any kind of team scores high five,
five.
You think that their model,

946
00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.290
it's much worse when you know the people.
I think,
I mean,
porn is a job,

947
00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:57.810
whatever I want for it either.
I mean,

948
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:00.480
I'm not saying I would prefer not

949
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:05.520
before I met her.
So it's like,
but if I had to choose one or the other,

950
00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:10.590
no brainer,
give me the porn over the point.
Your buddies,
Eiffel Tower and a girl.

951
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:13.920
Yeah.
But you know,
some of those porn star chicks after a while,

952
00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:19.310
they just so fucking like item to the lights out in their eye.

953
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:25.150
You know what I mean?
Like just something happens.
I'm not gonna say no,

954
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:30.270
but at what if you actually really loved her and you just moved away and broke

955
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:35.130
up with your buddies?
Yeah,
no,
I,
that's all it.
The get rid of them.

956
00:54:35.131 --> 00:54:38.340
But how can he love,
you can't,
that's a deal breaker.
I mean for me,
I could not,

957
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.390
I could not do it.
That would haunt me for the rest of my name.

958
00:54:40.391 --> 00:54:41.040
I gotta tell you though,

959
00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.190
he has great friends that the fact that they told him before he got too

960
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:48.690
emotionally involved.
Uh,
I don't know.
He says he's coming out to the,

961
00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.640
the place down the yacht club this weekend.
I'm doing this Gig of the year.

962
00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:54.060
I'd like to know what it looks like when when you meet him,

963
00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.570
how does he introduce himself on the guy with the girlfriend who got Eiffel

964
00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:01.230
Tower?
Well,
cause he won't,
I've already heard this podcast so you won't know.

965
00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:03.310
I Dunno.
I Dunno if he will that,

966
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.990
hey send me a picture and we're going to judge you if you're ugly,
you won't.

967
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:11.260
Or even if he doesn't know,
I mean he,
he may know you got the email.

968
00:55:11.261 --> 00:55:13.800
Like I sent you an email about my girlfriend.
Get Eiffel Tower.

969
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:17.760
Like that would be the intro.
Yeah.
I've actually,
I've had people do that.
It gets,

970
00:55:17.761 --> 00:55:19.990
it can get,
we can get weird with these things.
All right,

971
00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:23.430
we got time for another one here,
right?
All right.
Uh,
did the right thing.

972
00:55:23.431 --> 00:55:27.180
Basically.
You haven't seen my girl in a week.
Oh,
asking if I,

973
00:55:27.181 --> 00:55:28.490
if he did the right thing.
All right,

974
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:33.780
you're a fucking champ for putting up with my four reading out loud skills here.

975
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:35.820
Uh,
all right,
Bill.
Did I do the right thing?

976
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.590
Basically haven't seen my girl in a week.

977
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:42.180
There's this massive outdoor party slash celebration going on in my city,

978
00:55:42.181 --> 00:55:47.181
Calgary where over a million people come and basically just drink fuck in party.

979
00:55:47.311 --> 00:55:51.270
That faces off for a week.
Sounds like when you're blackout a and say,

980
00:55:51.271 --> 00:55:54.450
and the saying is like the one in Vegas.
What happens in Calgary?

981
00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:58.380
Stand peas stays during the stampede.
All right,
here's the story.

982
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:02.530
I'm trying to hang out with my girl all day,
but she's busy.
Uh,
no problem.

983
00:56:02.531 --> 00:56:06.090
She finally tells me her and her friend,
her friends left her and she's alone.

984
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:07.890
I'm watching the UFC fight,

985
00:56:07.891 --> 00:56:12.270
but I decide to get into a taxi and go find her and pick her up.

986
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.321
Then she says,

987
00:56:13.321 --> 00:56:17.310
while I'm in route that she's actually at this bar with this guy she met earlier

988
00:56:17.311 --> 00:56:20.940
on.
He lost his friends too.
How convenient.

989
00:56:20.941 --> 00:56:24.780
I thought she said that it was the polite thing to do to help him,
uh,

990
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:28.150
Jesus help him out,
which I never understood.
Basically,

991
00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:31.810
they were out getting trashed together at this bar.
I pulled up in a taxi,

992
00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:34.030
she was on the patio with his out of town,

993
00:56:34.031 --> 00:56:38.380
random guy at a table and saw me and kind of drunkenly stumbled over to the

994
00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:39.970
taxi,
uh,

995
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000
whereby I locked the door and just told her have fun and rolled up the window

996
00:56:45.071 --> 00:56:49.930
and told the taxi to leave.
Went back to the u s FC fight.
Had a great night.

997
00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:53.230
Uh,
granted we aren't married,
but we,
you,
uh,

998
00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:57.040
but we have been dating seriously for the past year or so.
What should I do?

999
00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:01.350
Um,
are first of all,
do you think he did the right thing at that?

1000
00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:04.170
At that moment it's a roll the window up and drive away.

1001
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:06.250
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1002
00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:11.230
<v 1>I wouldn't last me.
I was a long story.
He,
he dated her all along.
Yeah,</v>

1003
00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:15.310
he's actually somebody I was going to compliment how succinct they put this eye.

1004
00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:17.770
So he started at this.

1005
00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:21.360
How did you get from the state of Pete thing to the UFC?
You know what,

1006
00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:22.450
my awful reading,

1007
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.210
you probably zoned out for half a second and that's not your fault.

1008
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:27.280
He was just the Calgary stampede thing.

1009
00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:30.740
It's the big thing where everybody fours it up,
Fox each other.
He's at,

1010
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.590
he's watching UFC fight at home.

1011
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:37.900
His girl tells him to come down and fucking meet them and then she says,
oh,

1012
00:57:37.901 --> 00:57:42.550
my friends left me.
And then it goes,
oh,
I'm with this guy.
You know,

1013
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:45.840
I don't even fucking remember at this point.
He's fucking friends left hand.

1014
00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:46.590
What I,

1015
00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:50.770
the thing I got from his mom once she ended up in the cab with two groups of

1016
00:57:50.771 --> 00:57:53.320
friends who left?
No,
no,
she was still at the bar with the guy.

1017
00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:54.500
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1018
00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:58.940
<v 1>She basically was [inaudible].
She was at a bar.
She didn't get lead by a friend.</v>

1019
00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:01.850
She was with her friends.
She met some hot guy and they're like,
hey,

1020
00:58:01.851 --> 00:58:05.060
what happens in Stan feeds,
you know,
have fun.
They fucking take off.

1021
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:09.290
She asked with this fucking guy,
his friends are gone and she goes,
oh,

1022
00:58:09.291 --> 00:58:12.410
my friends left me here.
Come and get me Damsel in distress.

1023
00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:16.820
He stops watching the pay per view fight goes down to get this broad on the way

1024
00:58:16.821 --> 00:58:17.390
over,

1025
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:21.200
she drops the bomb that she met some other guy who conveniently got left by his

1026
00:58:21.201 --> 00:58:26.000
friends and uh,
the fuck did she say that?
Cause she does.
I don't know.

1027
00:58:26.001 --> 00:58:29.120
That's what the fuck's going on.
So anyway,
so she fucking comes down.
He sees it,

1028
00:58:29.121 --> 00:58:31.130
says have a nice night.
Rose up the fucking window.

1029
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:36.170
He saw them just sitting there.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
So I got to read it again.
I,

1030
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:38.960
well,
it's,
there's so many things then why not?
Yeah,
no.

1031
00:58:38.961 --> 00:58:40.430
Then he did not do the right then.

1032
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.240
Just fucking let her in the car there at the same bar.

1033
00:58:44.241 --> 00:58:47.450
This girl was at the bar when she called him pick me up.
He drove to the bar.

1034
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:51.650
She's still at the bar sitting at the bar and hit with,
with that guy.

1035
00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:57.350
But it's an old white guy.
I'm going to totally fucking this fucking story.
No,

1036
00:58:57.590 --> 00:59:02.450
I get it.
But who fucking cares?
The guy was at the bar.
You say,
who cares?

1037
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:04.430
All right,
this is good.
This is point counterpoint here.

1038
00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:09.170
I say he did the right fucking thing.
Why?
Because I wasn't born yesterday.

1039
00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:12.350
And I'm not saying you were not trying to insult you,
but like,
I'm just like,

1040
00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:16.040
I know what the fuck and go down in a bar.
Okay,
but why the fuck,

1041
00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:17.730
especially during stampede week?
Well,

1042
00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:21.830
you know what that means at the very least he was rubbing her pussy over a

1043
00:59:21.831 --> 00:59:22.430
fucking,

1044
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:25.400
<v 2>uh,
first slacks.
You have weird readers.</v>

1045
00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:30.610
Like what if this stampede is such a big deal on such an awesome party?

1046
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:36.170
Why are you sitting home at alone watching UFC in the middle of fucking stampede

1047
00:59:36.171 --> 00:59:36.590
week?

1048
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:40.610
You're asking for this girl to do whatever to what a did you get fingered or

1049
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:43.520
whatever you just said under the bar.
Like it's,
it's stampede week.

1050
00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:46.580
Go fucking party.
Don't sit home and watch UFC.
Yeah.

1051
00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:49.390
<v 1>Oh,
so you're saying it's this guy's fault that he,
that he was sitting there.</v>

1052
00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:53.000
They don't,
yeah,
they put a chastity belt on her and let her go out.
If that's,

1053
00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:53.870
listen,

1054
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:56.120
<v 2>no,
not even that.
I'm putting this in my shoes.</v>

1055
00:59:56.121 --> 01:00:00.620
If I have a girlfriend and she goes out for a stampede week with our friends at

1056
01:00:00.621 --> 01:00:03.800
a bar,
says it,
you know,
whatever.
She said,
come pick me up.

1057
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:07.130
Like I'm not going to be pissed if there's a dude sitting with her at the table,

1058
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.100
like it's a fucking bar.
If she wants to,
a couple of them,

1059
01:00:10.101 --> 01:00:11.030
she wanted to call them.

1060
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:18.230
<v 1>I don't have that much faith and women.
I just know what I,
I don't know.</v>

1061
01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.070
I just don't.
I don't,
I know what I've done.

1062
01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:24.920
I know what I've done with women in bars in that situation.
When they call,

1063
01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:29.210
my boyfriend got me up.
I think every guy after a while you've rounded third.

1064
01:00:29.211 --> 01:00:29.780
Yeah,

1065
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:34.100
<v 2>in a bar.
Yeah.
That's just a weird then then why call your boyfriend?</v>

1066
01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:39.150
<v 1>Well,
I mean,
look,
it ain't about her.
It's about this guy.
Let's go.</v>

1067
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.740
What I'm going to say.
He did the fuck.
That was a strong move.
He said,

1068
01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:44.680
have a nice night.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Does it vary?

1069
01:00:44.681 --> 01:00:47.660
At least you got to just say it's not fucking cool for you to be doing that shit

1070
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.240
and you're going to,
it's not my fucking fault.

1071
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:52.400
It's whore week and you decided to be a whore.

1072
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:55.970
That means if I go to Vegas on a business trip,
that's your fault.

1073
01:00:55.971 --> 01:00:58.400
If you let me fucking go down there.
Honestly,
if I go to them

1074
01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:02.520
<v 2>Vegas and I stay in my room to watch UFC when she goes out,</v>

1075
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.700
<v 1>it's Calgary stampede week.</v>

1076
01:01:05.701 --> 01:01:10.100
So there's a bunch of guys what happens out smelling like fucking oxygen coming

1077
01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:14.820
to town.
No Dude,
why can't he go out?
Plus it was I,
he can't go up,

1078
01:01:14.821 --> 01:01:19.250
but this is my thing.
My thing is is if you ask if,
if,
if it's,

1079
01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.400
I will agree with that in a little bit,
but I'll tell you this.

1080
01:01:23.401 --> 01:01:27.330
If it's fucking whore week,
all right,
and your,

1081
01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.150
if your girl can't survive for a week,
yeah,

1082
01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.020
you don't have a fucking relationship anymore.
You know what I mean?
I,
yeah,
no,

1083
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:37.230
I put put could put your lovely wife go down in New Orleans,

1084
01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:42.330
walk down Bourbon Street and,
and still be a faithful woman.
She could write.
Yeah,

1085
01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:43.680
I hope so.
Well there you go.

1086
01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.470
<v 2>Let me put this way.
I'm still not,</v>

1087
01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:51.210
if I see a crew that she's going with that's like six single girls,

1088
01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:51.841
she's like,
hey,

1089
01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:55.530
we're going to fucking New Orleans or Vegas for the week and like I,

1090
01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:59.700
I'm not happy about that.
No,
not at all.
No,
no,
no.
So this guy is sitting home.

1091
01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:03.330
This,
this is the image in my head.
Get it.
I get what you're saying.

1092
01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:06.750
He's a fucking idiot saying and he's like,
fuck you,

1093
01:02:06.751 --> 01:02:09.210
I'm going to go home and watch more UFC fine.

1094
01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.490
By the time you fuck pulled out of the parking lot,

1095
01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.700
she was probably getting real for real this time.
But you showed,

1096
01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.930
you showed her I'm going to go home,
I'm going to continue to watch it.
You know,

1097
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.460
I think you might convince me.
I at least I like his self esteem and he's also,

1098
01:02:23.461 --> 01:02:26.340
he's in a relationship.
Fuck you on.
Watch the fight,
I guess.

1099
01:02:26.341 --> 01:02:29.730
I guess the lesson here resigned on horror night.
You have to protect your pussy.

1100
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:33.690
Yeah,
you do.
Yeah.
What happened?
Was it at home,
right?
And what,
this guy's the,

1101
01:02:33.691 --> 01:02:37.080
what happens in stampede week or whatever he said,
stays in stampede week.

1102
01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:40.050
Get your ass out a little living room.
He's saying,
what should I do?

1103
01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:44.180
<v 1>Uh,
I I think at the I and I totally,
David told you,
see your point,</v>

1104
01:02:44.181 --> 01:02:46.540
but I think you know,
Eh,

1105
01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.400
<v 2>you made the mistake of trust in your girl and when you can't trust someone,</v>

1106
01:02:49.401 --> 01:02:50.330
which you now realize you yeah.

1107
01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:54.160
<v 1>Can't,
it's over.
It's Michael Corleone says,
Oh,</v>

1108
01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:57.940
it's over godfather part two.
So I would get out of that.

1109
01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:00.130
So before we wrap this up,
man,
I had a great time.

1110
01:03:00.131 --> 01:03:03.640
I learned about your website and all that type of stuff.
Uh,
and uh,

1111
01:03:03.641 --> 01:03:08.050
I'm always psyched when I see somebody who got out of the fucking Matrix,
right?

1112
01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:10.730
You had the balls to me that people I get,
I get it.

1113
01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:12.820
People read all 10 that can I do this?
Can I do that?

1114
01:03:12.821 --> 01:03:16.120
Like it just takes the balls to go do it.

1115
01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:19.240
You just do a little bit every fucking day and you somehow get there.

1116
01:03:19.241 --> 01:03:20.220
So before we get out of it,

1117
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:23.700
I got to talk red sox because I am elated that they are,

1118
01:03:23.701 --> 01:03:27.460
they are tied for last place right now because all I ever wanted to do was see

1119
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:31.230
when it,
once they want it fucking twice and now it's senior level.

1120
01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:34.630
So you have an ebb and flow,
you know,
the old guard is gone.

1121
01:03:34.631 --> 01:03:37.420
Now we've got to build up the new team and I'm starting to see empty seats at

1122
01:03:37.421 --> 01:03:42.310
the Games and I'm loving that because I wanted to go back to not singing that

1123
01:03:42.311 --> 01:03:46.300
douchey song during the seventh inning.
No more pink red sox hats.

1124
01:03:46.301 --> 01:03:48.220
And I want to be able to just walk up and go to a fucking game.

1125
01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:54.320
<v 2>Yeah,
I don't,
I'm,
I'm not mad that there unless,
I mean I still root for him,</v>

1126
01:03:54.321 --> 01:03:57.620
but I uh,
not for the same reasons you,
I don't,
I mean the,

1127
01:03:57.621 --> 01:04:01.250
they left just a sour taste in my mouth after last year.
The collapse,

1128
01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.930
hate Beckett.
Hate him,
like poison.
Um,

1129
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:06.890
I don't even know that I can really root for him as hard as I used it,

1130
01:04:06.891 --> 01:04:11.120
as long as he's on the team.
Um,
I love when he said it was my day off.

1131
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:14.870
You liked that?
I loved it.
Oh,
I hated that day off.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Yeah,

1132
01:04:14.871 --> 01:04:18.650
that's exactly what he was saying.
Fuck you to,
you know he wasn't.
Yeah,
it was,

1133
01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:22.340
it wasn't saying to the fence.
He was,
I don't like,
I don't know that guy.

1134
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:26.720
He saying fuck you to the fucking press.
Stop sneaking around.
Follow me.

1135
01:04:26.721 --> 01:04:29.200
You bunch of fucking garages.
Nah,
he was,
he was,

1136
01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:33.020
he got scratched because it was hurt and he played golf and he makes $20 million

1137
01:04:33.021 --> 01:04:37.550
a year and he didn't even any won a world series force.
Who fucking cares?

1138
01:04:37.551 --> 01:04:42.530
You want me to do?
I do.
No,
no.
I just be all I do.
I do.

1139
01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.490
I,
all I wanted to do was see him,

1140
01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.360
what it wants to want to fucking twice and they hung up because you biggest

1141
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.550
choke and professional sports history.
I mean,
no one will ever top deck.

1142
01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:52.910
So another topic,
you can lose four games in a row,

1143
01:04:52.911 --> 01:04:56.690
but you won't be a $215 million team with four first ballot hall of famers.

1144
01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.850
You're not just not going to be,
it's not going to happen again.

1145
01:04:58.851 --> 01:05:01.450
The only person who could do it again is the fucking Yankees because the other

1146
01:05:01.451 --> 01:05:04.790
one was a spent $20 million.
Who was the plumbing staff on that?

1147
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:09.930
Which was the Yankees or the Red Sox?
The Red Sox.
Yep.

1148
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:14.150
<v 1>When we went it was shilling Bronson or Royal Pedro Martinez.</v>

1149
01:05:14.151 --> 01:05:17.620
Low Derek Lowe and Wakefield.
Yeah.
So no,
no.
Yeah.

1150
01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:20.500
Wakefield was back at on that team.
No,
he was on oh seven Oh,

1151
01:05:20.501 --> 01:05:22.810
so then who fucking cares because you already had your one,

1152
01:05:22.811 --> 01:05:24.370
you don't care about your second and then it went to,

1153
01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:27.670
you don't care if a guy is just he,
everybody says he's an asshole.

1154
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:30.940
Universal from media.
The fans,
that area,
you don't care.

1155
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.150
It doesn't like ruining for somebody who was an asshole.

1156
01:05:34.151 --> 01:05:37.870
It doesn't bother you in the least.
I like bear and chicken too.
Yeah,
but,

1157
01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:42.420
and if I could do it in between podcasts for only Ken,
but you know what I,

1158
01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.930
you know,
I think they,
I think they fucked up last year.
I think that they,

1159
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:49.510
one of the fucking problems is,
is when shit goes bad,

1160
01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:53.350
people don't accept the fact that shit goes bad.
Okay.

1161
01:05:53.351 --> 01:05:56.260
And it's one of those deals where it's not always going to be roses.

1162
01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.850
And sometimes when it goes bad,

1163
01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.730
it doesn't mean you got to fucking dismantle everybody.

1164
01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.640
Like I think what the red sox did after last year,
granted,

1165
01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:06.310
you got to get rid of some people who aren't fucking playing and not earning

1166
01:06:06.311 --> 01:06:08.140
their paychecks.
I definitely understand that.

1167
01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:12.310
But the fucking get rid of everybody.
It's like now you know,

1168
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:17.670
everybody is not as good a FC and going to the cubs is not in a better

1169
01:06:17.831 --> 01:06:21.940
situation.
Tito,
I understand he was sick of the media.
He rapped at least,

1170
01:06:21.941 --> 01:06:24.500
but everybody who was the media was the team.
Well,

1171
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.700
I think everybody lost by the end of it.
By then.

1172
01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:29.350
Everybody goes their separate ways.
It's like watching,
you know what was like,

1173
01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:30.970
it was like watching a great band break up.

1174
01:06:30.971 --> 01:06:34.750
It was like watching David Lee Roth leave fucking van Halen and then you,

1175
01:06:34.751 --> 01:06:37.000
I'm watching Sammy Hagar,
who's all right,

1176
01:06:37.001 --> 01:06:40.210
but he's not David Lee and then David Lee Roth,
when he's in Van Halen,

1177
01:06:40.211 --> 01:06:42.130
he's a fucking rock star.
He gets out of that thing.

1178
01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:45.100
He became a fucking lounge singer and I'm telling you,

1179
01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:47.860
I really believe that that's what's going to,
I think Tito is going to be fine,

1180
01:06:47.861 --> 01:06:50.860
but I just think I don't disagree with,
I mean you said,

1181
01:06:50.861 --> 01:06:54.190
but here's my point with the red sox.
I think these guys make so much money,

1182
01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.380
millions upon millions upon millions of dollars.

1183
01:06:56.650 --> 01:07:00.400
And then it bothers me when they bitch about them.
I get the media,

1184
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:03.400
but guess what?
The media is what gives the information and the fence.

1185
01:07:03.401 --> 01:07:06.790
The fence is why you make so much money.
So just to blow it off,

1186
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:10.660
like with its talent,
your talent is why you make so much money,

1187
01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:12.820
but it,
listen,

1188
01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:16.840
you can be talented at picking up trash and those guys don't make the money that

1189
01:07:16.841 --> 01:07:19.360
baseball,
like that's a unique,
weird talent.

1190
01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:23.020
Like if I could fucking fills stadiums.
Yes,
correct.

1191
01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:26.530
But it's no different than this early.
Another talent that doesn't make that,

1192
01:07:26.531 --> 01:07:30.030
it just happens.
You found something that the American public is,
I,

1193
01:07:30.031 --> 01:07:34.030
I really honestly think I remember reading this thing where it Ringo Starr drama

1194
01:07:34.031 --> 01:07:37.900
for the Beatles just in case,
you know,
I know he's fucking,

1195
01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:42.820
he decided when he was like 70,
71 he goes,
I'm not signing any more autographs.

1196
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.430
I'm done.
And I remember somebody wrote like,

1197
01:07:45.431 --> 01:07:49.630
Sky's been sign autographs for 50 fucking years.
Somebody said,
uh,
he goes,

1198
01:07:49.631 --> 01:07:54.310
that's fucking bullshit.
Because the fans were the ones that made him famous.

1199
01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:59.320
Like the fans all got together and had a meeting and went,
okay,

1200
01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:01.510
which band are we going to make famous?
It's like,

1201
01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:06.220
isn't it more that the Beatles made music that was so fucking compelling?

1202
01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:10.880
You couldn't ignore it.
It's like,
I think that like that,

1203
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:15.130
that whole fucking philosophy that they're the ones that they're the reasons why

1204
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.460
make a zillion dollars.

1205
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:21.110
They're not okay because I don't have the power to make Michael Jordan not make

1206
01:08:21.111 --> 01:08:21.891
a zillion dollars.

1207
01:08:21.891 --> 01:08:25.820
That guy is so fucking unbelievable that you were going to watch him.

1208
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:28.010
You're going to watch Colby,
you're going to,
well actual bra.

1209
01:08:28.011 --> 01:08:30.710
And those guys have like,
like you're talking one,

1210
01:08:30.711 --> 01:08:35.420
1 million to the fucking population level talent like that.
And they,

1211
01:08:35.421 --> 01:08:35.950
and they,

1212
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:39.470
the amount of hours and the sacrifice and all this shit that they go through and

1213
01:08:39.471 --> 01:08:42.980
all the guys,
they got to fucking beat out to climb to the top of that mountain.

1214
01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:47.510
And then the reward is,
or gs and money.
Correct.
Absolutely.

1215
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:51.560
But at no point do I sit there and I go,
now Lebron,
you can make it.

1216
01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:55.070
I have decided me.
No,
but it is.
No,
it's not whether you make it,

1217
01:08:55.071 --> 01:08:58.220
it's the collective interest.
It's without,

1218
01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:02.330
without the interest in baseball,
which is really Irregardless of them.

1219
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:05.810
Like people love baseball.
People love sports.
People love music.

1220
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.890
But without that demand,
you know they're going to make nothing.

1221
01:09:09.891 --> 01:09:13.070
And their talent is unique to what they do.

1222
01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:16.730
But I guess threatened to what we,
we've threatened to walk away.
Love it.

1223
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:19.100
We have nothing better to do.
Right?
Like I,

1224
01:09:19.101 --> 01:09:24.020
I would love to fucking turn my back and different times to have turned by back

1225
01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:26.960
on a bunch of different sports.
And in the end of it,

1226
01:09:26.961 --> 01:09:30.470
I'm just alone with my thoughts.
And I have,
if it was up to me,

1227
01:09:30.471 --> 01:09:34.060
I would a boy called the college football until they got a real fucking playoff

1228
01:09:34.061 --> 01:09:35.990
system.
And that's like the thing that bothered me the most.

1229
01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.430
It's never going to happen.
I agree with you.

1230
01:09:37.431 --> 01:09:41.450
It's an ingrained is never gonna go away.
But that doesn't mean like,

1231
01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:46.950
and you take a different way.
I look at it as like they're my client in a way.

1232
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:48.520
Like I,
they're,

1233
01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:52.940
they're being paid to entertain me like the press and part of it.

1234
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:57.170
Well let me ask you this.
So now this guy is entertaining.
Yoo Hoo.
Okay.

1235
01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:02.060
I think the player now what responsibility you ads cause I don't think that
fans,

1236
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:07.300
fans feel like I go buy a ticket and that gives me the right to dump something

1237
01:10:07.881 --> 01:10:12.560
in run our tests face where I would know no one would throw a drink and Ronald

1238
01:10:12.561 --> 01:10:14.710
test space in a bar,
right?
No I don't.

1239
01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.180
All of a sudden he has on a Jersey you feel like you can do that.

1240
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.260
You can feel like you can yell shit about something.
Let me do this guys.

1241
01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:24.290
Guys say whatever you want it did.
You feel it.
You can say,

1242
01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:27.320
I don't think you can thump.
I don't no contact nothing.

1243
01:10:27.321 --> 01:10:31.530
But you can be as mean as your human completely disregard me.

1244
01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:33.890
Okay.
Well if I think if you think that you,

1245
01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.010
that you can go like to the point of like when somebody has a kid that was born

1246
01:10:37.011 --> 01:10:37.940
with some sort of a,

1247
01:10:37.941 --> 01:10:42.050
you know a medical problem and yellow asshole move.

1248
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:43.130
But that's like the type,

1249
01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.160
that's the type of shift that that comes with that big bag of fucking money.

1250
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.360
And my thing is what I,

1251
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:52.390
what I see is that media and the fans all want to hold the athletes accountable,

1252
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.580
but we don't,
we don't like,
but we feel like,
oh well,

1253
01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:57.500
well then you shouldn't have got famous.

1254
01:10:57.530 --> 01:11:00.440
You shouldn't have become a baseball player and I and I should be able to take

1255
01:11:00.441 --> 01:11:04.040
out my miserable fucking childhood on you and you shouldn't turn around and

1256
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:05.900
telling you to go fuck myself thing.

1257
01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:10.840
You should be able to take out your miserable fucking nine to five as Keith

1258
01:11:10.841 --> 01:11:15.530
folks at Burger King job on him who's making 20 million to play kids.
What?

1259
01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:19.350
I liked that he said Burger King job because he treated whoever fucking said

1260
01:11:19.351 --> 01:11:22.830
whatever to him with the same amount of respect.
But that's that to me,

1261
01:11:22.831 --> 01:11:25.770
we look at different ways like I have no problem.
You know what?

1262
01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.700
Take that key folk.
You can say,
if someone's pay me $20 million,

1263
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.130
I will stand up there.
You can fucking throw rocks at Man.
I don't fucking care.

1264
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:34.290
You're talking a good game.

1265
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:38.520
You're talking to go can't go out and do it and do it day after fucking day that

1266
01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:39.780
has nothing.
And here's the thing,

1267
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:42.270
you're going to have to have people like you remember how you felt in that

1268
01:11:42.271 --> 01:11:43.500
fucking interview when that girl was,

1269
01:11:43.501 --> 01:11:48.390
was when you felt like you were going to fucking to your job every fucking day.

1270
01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:53.760
I am very fond of gain is if you're a public eye that comes with it.

1271
01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:57.960
Like you said,
you take it different like August face to face,

1272
01:11:57.961 --> 01:11:59.130
but I mean I get brutal.

1273
01:11:59.131 --> 01:12:01.980
I think it's really easy from where we're sitting to be like,
dude,

1274
01:12:01.981 --> 01:12:06.090
you know what I would do if I had that kind of dude,
I wouldn't give a fuck.

1275
01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:09.390
The thing about it is is once you make past a certain amount of money,

1276
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:13.350
it doesn't fucking matter like how much more you have and like,
you know,

1277
01:12:13.351 --> 01:12:15.900
buying a bunch of shiny shit at the end of the day,
it's not going to make you,

1278
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:18.540
there's a few key things that are going to make you happy in life.

1279
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:23.220
And one of them is,
is peace,
inner peace and silence,
which you,

1280
01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.430
when you get to that level of fame,
okay.
You,
you don't,

1281
01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:30.290
you don't really have that anymore in certain fucking shitting habit.
Like,

1282
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:34.050
I mean there's guys who aren't assholes back at going back to the example like

1283
01:12:34.051 --> 01:12:38.280
no one fucking like dirt junior doesn't get treated like Beckett does.

1284
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:42.390
Beckett in going back to that example of the you like when he said fair enough,

1285
01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.610
like I like I was not looking at that,
that there was,

1286
01:12:44.611 --> 01:12:46.920
there are athletes that are assholes.
Okay.
All right.

1287
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:50.250
Well I was kind of playing devil's advocate,
but I mean I don't think people,

1288
01:12:50.251 --> 01:12:54.450
I mean you look up or teases kind of Yap in the water this year,
but I mean he,

1289
01:12:54.451 --> 01:12:56.910
he's people loving.
There's beloved athletes,

1290
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.990
but then there's asshole athletes and all I'm saying you're going to like the

1291
01:13:00.991 --> 01:13:01.560
backup on,

1292
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.780
he was like coming off what happened last year and all the fried chicken,

1293
01:13:04.810 --> 01:13:07.150
all the Hoopla and all of the media he missed.

1294
01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.640
He missed a start because it was hurt and then he wouldn't golf.

1295
01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:16.740
To me that's just,
I don't give a fuck about anybody.
That's all he said.

1296
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:19.920
I don't,
I don't think the beer or anything last year at anything to do with them

1297
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.120
stinking.
I think everyone drinks.
I just look at it like,
you know,

1298
01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.950
this is going to be a story.
Like you're,
you're,
I mean,

1299
01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:29.940
he didn't know he was going to get,
he,
you know,
he got caught.
He got caught like,

1300
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:35.250
like a fucking,
um,
it's like,
you know,

1301
01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:38.280
when somebody fakes it back injury,
I'm a data guy.

1302
01:13:38.281 --> 01:13:41.490
Like they were showing these insurance fraud things.
It was fucking hilarious.

1303
01:13:41.491 --> 01:13:42.810
This guy faked a back injury.

1304
01:13:42.811 --> 01:13:46.260
He was suing this insurance company and then he goes out and goes golfing in the

1305
01:13:46.261 --> 01:13:48.190
warmup exercise he was doing when he was on there.

1306
01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:52.080
It was so fucking lies is like visually I can explain this to people.
It was,

1307
01:13:52.081 --> 01:13:53.850
he had the club,
you know,

1308
01:13:53.851 --> 01:13:56.610
behind his neck on his shoulders with his hands hanging over it.

1309
01:13:56.611 --> 01:13:57.444
And he was doing those,

1310
01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:02.360
the psycho like taekwondo twists and uh,
it,

1311
01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.090
uh,
it,
and they also showed him lifting something heavy out of his trunk.
Like,

1312
01:14:06.091 --> 01:14:08.400
yeah,
I think he had like know charcoal,
the barbecue,

1313
01:14:08.401 --> 01:14:11.590
like the guy was just live in the fucking life.
That was hilarious.
Look,

1314
01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.760
I'm not saying you,
you like how I answered the question.
I just think he did.

1315
01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:20.210
I think he owes the same reason why I like,
well I like,

1316
01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.570
I think a lot of people cower in front of the press.

1317
01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.600
I'm not saying where the guy was,
right or whether he was wrong.
I loved it.

1318
01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:27.340
I love you.
Just kept going to do it.
It's my day off.

1319
01:14:27.341 --> 01:14:29.880
I'll do whatever the fuck I want to like.
That taps into my,
yeah,

1320
01:14:29.881 --> 01:14:33.040
go fuck yourself.
I don't like having a boss.
I know.
Yeah.

1321
01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.700
He shouldn't have done that.
He got caught.
He should have owned up to it.

1322
01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.770
He should've probably handle it better,

1323
01:14:38.771 --> 01:14:42.910
but just as a comedian watching somebody to tell a crowd to go fuck themselves.

1324
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:46.780
There's always something about that that,
that,
that,
that does make me laugh,

1325
01:14:46.781 --> 01:14:51.620
but I,
this is my thing,
like,
um,
when you talk I go fuck them.

1326
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:55.240
Like in an angry way.
Like the people who buy a ticket to this,

1327
01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:57.010
this is what I would say.
I used to always go,

1328
01:14:57.011 --> 01:14:59.050
you know what I love about mom and pop's places,

1329
01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:01.090
you know the customer's always right.

1330
01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.720
And I talked to a guy owned a place and he goes,
no,
he goes right is right.

1331
01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:09.250
And I was like,
you know what you are right.
And I think that if fans,

1332
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:14.530
I'm generalizing,
fans should have more writers.
Right?
Okay.

1333
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.430
Don't expect this guy we made tonight.
It can he,

1334
01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.010
he can't eat chicken and drink beer before fucking start.

1335
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.740
But you can make fun of his kid who has fucking autism.

1336
01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:27.160
I mean give me a fucking break and while I paid for a ticket and that's your

1337
01:15:27.161 --> 01:15:31.030
fault for making it as a baseball player and I can sit here with no fucking

1338
01:15:31.031 --> 01:15:31.900
responsibility.

1339
01:15:31.901 --> 01:15:35.710
What's so fucking ever and act like a total cunt and throw a drink in your face

1340
01:15:35.711 --> 01:15:38.290
and not expect the guy to come in and stands and punch me in the fucking face.

1341
01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:42.670
Like I like with,
I agree with you.

1342
01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:45.830
I agree with you probably are.
I do that.
Like if,

1343
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:48.560
if someone says something like that,
I had no problem in the play,

1344
01:15:48.561 --> 01:15:49.540
you're going to beat nick guy.

1345
01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:53.500
If a guy won't answer a question on why he fucking golf,
don't he was hurt.

1346
01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.140
That's a different thing for me.
But I would never,
I mean,

1347
01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:57.910
yeah you shouldn't there,
there,

1348
01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.620
there is a line that just normal and this is almost like it goes full circle I

1349
01:16:02.621 --> 01:16:07.210
guess.
I think like rationally like,
but I've done the unknown rational person.

1350
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:11.170
Like you're not normal if you go to that extreme like,
hey,

1351
01:16:11.171 --> 01:16:14.140
you're fucking kid has autism.
That's like a fucking idiot.

1352
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:18.680
Like that's just a fucking lunatic idiot that nobody should sell those racist

1353
01:16:18.681 --> 01:16:22.420
after the Bruins games play test,
right?
Yeah,
exactly.
So that's,

1354
01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:25.060
we're 100% on the same page there.

1355
01:16:25.061 --> 01:16:29.080
I'm talking more like sometimes guys get mad when they get booted and shit.

1356
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:32.650
It's like,
really no,
no,
no,
no that,
that no that then you're being a pussy.

1357
01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:33.011
I'm not,

1358
01:16:33.011 --> 01:16:36.760
and I'm not saying the reason why I'm going so hard defendant athletes on this,

1359
01:16:36.761 --> 01:16:40.870
it's just because I feel like that like this side isn't present.

1360
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:44.560
There's never any sort of like a fan has any sort of responsibility.

1361
01:16:44.561 --> 01:16:47.620
Like what about like walking up for an autograph when he's eating dinner?

1362
01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:52.540
I think eaten dinner is a sacred thing.
You don't do it.
I think if they're,

1363
01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:54.880
if they're walking down the fucking street,
that's part of the game.

1364
01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.420
But if this sitting there at dinner,
like I think people even people know that,

1365
01:16:58.421 --> 01:17:00.500
you know when I was in San Francisco and fuck it was in a restaurant,

1366
01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:03.670
Joe Montana was two tables away.
Who's fucking unreal?
And somebody asked me,

1367
01:17:03.671 --> 01:17:04.570
do you ask him for an autograph?

1368
01:17:04.571 --> 01:17:08.110
And I jokingly said I wouldn't ask screech for an autograph and he was fucking

1369
01:17:08.111 --> 01:17:12.450
eating.
I'm not messing with.
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't fuck with me.
What am I doing?

1370
01:17:12.451 --> 01:17:14.680
I'm assigned my Napkin and then lose it.

1371
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:18.410
I meant more on the thing I wouldn't ask Rowan is appetizers on a Napkin I'm

1372
01:17:18.411 --> 01:17:22.610
going to lose.
I wanted to ask either,
but I hope if I ever became that famous,

1373
01:17:22.611 --> 01:17:24.890
which I obviously won't,
but if you did or somebody to,

1374
01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:29.150
I hope I will never get mad either.
It's like that.
It's absolutely,

1375
01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.590
there's always how you would hope.
But like,
um,

1376
01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:39.580
I think that like the only way to truly understand what it's like cause you

1377
01:17:40.131 --> 01:17:41.030
know,
dude,

1378
01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:45.050
I mean nobody fucking bumps me when I'm going to fucking like I have like a cult

1379
01:17:45.051 --> 01:17:48.410
following in comedy clubs and other than that,
nobody knows who the fuck I am.

1380
01:17:48.411 --> 01:17:51.740
So I have this great,
I'm in,
I'm in the perfect place in this business.

1381
01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:54.770
I'm known enough where I can sell tickets and make a good living,

1382
01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:59.700
but I walk around and nobody fucks with me.
But I've been around,
you know,

1383
01:17:59.701 --> 01:18:04.160
with certain events where I've done standup with super fucking famous people and

1384
01:18:04.161 --> 01:18:07.800
dude,
it doesn't look like fun.
It looks like a,

1385
01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:11.930
it looks like they never look comfortable and they just want to get the fuck out

1386
01:18:11.931 --> 01:18:13.700
of there.
And it's one of those things where people go,

1387
01:18:13.701 --> 01:18:16.790
well then why the fuck did you become a musician?
Why did you do that?

1388
01:18:16.791 --> 01:18:20.180
And my answer to that would be like when,
when you start out,

1389
01:18:20.181 --> 01:18:25.181
what you think being famous is and then what it really is is for the most part

1390
01:18:25.191 --> 01:18:27.740
miles and miles apart.
And then when you see like,
uh,

1391
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:30.200
like just from when I started,
when I started doing,
I mean,

1392
01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:31.550
I guess it was the fucking Internet,

1393
01:18:31.551 --> 01:18:34.710
but I started in [inaudible] 92 there was no cell phones with this biggest,

1394
01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:39.110
his fucking chair.
There was none of these cameras and film and stuff.
And like,

1395
01:18:39.111 --> 01:18:42.890
it's like everybody's become like the,
the spies and like,
I mean,

1396
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:45.590
like that has an affect my world.
But like when I look,

1397
01:18:45.591 --> 01:18:49.400
I've seen guys who are like,
it's just everywhere they fucking go.

1398
01:18:49.401 --> 01:18:53.120
People see and they'll just come walking up to you like filming you and say

1399
01:18:53.121 --> 01:18:56.960
what's up to my friend?
And I think after a while,
like it's just like anything,

1400
01:18:56.961 --> 01:18:58.970
it just,
it just fucks with you.
It's like,
look dude,
I get it.

1401
01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:02.330
I totally appreciate the,
I just want to fucking chill here and,
and,

1402
01:19:02.331 --> 01:19:05.630
and have something to eat.
And it's one of those things that,

1403
01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:09.470
but for the on the fan side,
it's like,
dude,
I've been rooting for you.
You know,

1404
01:19:09.471 --> 01:19:12.110
I'm spending money on New Jersey.
I put money in your fucking pocket.

1405
01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:15.560
This is my five second window where I'm going to see you,
you know,

1406
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:17.480
make this five seconds of my life.

1407
01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.540
And I think people are human and they don't let,

1408
01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:24.080
don't let those guys be human where every once in awhile I'm going to get so

1409
01:19:24.081 --> 01:19:26.900
much shit from your fucking people on the website.
No,
I mean,
you know,

1410
01:19:26.901 --> 01:19:30.680
I think you're doing,
you're straddling the fence both ways.

1411
01:19:30.681 --> 01:19:34.370
So I don't think you will get shit.
I mean I just,
and we are in that world.

1412
01:19:34.371 --> 01:19:35.240
I mean,
we're an internet,

1413
01:19:35.241 --> 01:19:39.050
so that's our living with people taking your country or a country and you should

1414
01:19:39.051 --> 01:19:43.490
be treated like one.
But I think sometimes,
you know,
on,
on either way,
you know,

1415
01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:46.160
fans booing you,
you're not fucking hidden and that,
that comes with it.

1416
01:19:46.161 --> 01:19:47.630
And if you cry about that,
you're a con.

1417
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:51.530
But like if you go to a game and you're yelling that type of shit,

1418
01:19:51.531 --> 01:19:54.450
you know about people's families or you know,
other things like,
you know,
they,

1419
01:19:54.451 --> 01:19:58.620
they see,
then they find out like psycho fans find out like what the,
you know,

1420
01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:01.370
they know what the wives look back and I started harassing them in the snow.

1421
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:04.490
It's all over.
There's extremes in both sides.
I mean,
and then you have athletes,

1422
01:20:04.491 --> 01:20:07.980
guys like Charles Barkley uniformly,
everyone says awesome.

1423
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:11.600
Like daisy Buchanan's year ago,
two years ago when he was playing,

1424
01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.800
was he playing for at that point it might even been a silver,

1425
01:20:13.801 --> 01:20:17.550
the 76 and he was just hanging out and he was cool as hell.
And you know,

1426
01:20:17.551 --> 01:20:17.911
it's funny,

1427
01:20:17.911 --> 01:20:21.150
he didn't make a big deal out of the fact that he was Charles Barkley.

1428
01:20:21.151 --> 01:20:24.730
So he's the raw,
so nobody rushed him.

1429
01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:28.410
And I think when you come in,
you know,
with like felt ropes around you,

1430
01:20:28.411 --> 01:20:31.650
I think you actually build up the two we're going to go like on for an hour and

1431
01:20:31.651 --> 01:20:36.540
16 here.
Um,
all right.
Wrapping it up here a day.
So fucking nice to meet you.

1432
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:40.460
Thanks for letting me swing by.
Here are barstool sports.com and if,

1433
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:44.220
if people out there who are insane about sports and you want to start,

1434
01:20:44.221 --> 01:20:47.820
you want to get out of your miserable life and that fucking cubicle and I

1435
01:20:47.821 --> 01:20:48.990
actually write about something.

1436
01:20:48.991 --> 01:20:51.100
Are you always wanted to ride or whatever you think you can do it?

1437
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:55.000
Where should they send it to?
Chips?
A bar stool,
sports dot.
John T,

I'll talk to you next week.
And uh,
that's it.

1440
01:21:03.691 --> 01:21:04.950
Let me shut this thing off here.
