1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.810
Hi.
Uh,
we're ready.
All right.
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:06.810
It's bill bar and it's time for the Thursday afternoon.
Just before Friday,

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.730
Monday morning podcast.
And I don't know,

4
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:10.620
I've just been getting a bunch of guests lately.

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.530
It's time for another special one.
And I got another legend,

6
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.290
the legend here.
I got the one and only Stephen Perkins from Jane's Addiction.

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.360
Hi Bill Porno for Pyros infectious grooves and your latest project,

8
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.950
the think experience,
which we will be getting into.
Uh,
first off,

9
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:33.180
thank you so much for doing this.
I've been a,
a,
a huge fan of,

10
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:36.570
you've already been talking and what happens when you break before you do a

11
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:41.210
podcast?
It's like,
dude,
just save that,
try and save that.
Say Nothing.

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.750
Just let it flow.
Let the levy break.
Yes.
When the mic is on.
Yes.
So,
um,

13
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.690
we were talking about,
uh,

14
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.190
basically the influence of the Internet and how good these,

15
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.330
these kids are at playing now,
but how it's like,

16
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:57.810
almost like they all grew up in the same town.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

17
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.260
Because everyone can just kind of go on youtube and if there's some sick kid in

18
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.960
Minnesota,
you didn't have to live there to see him.

19
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.260
You just put it on and you watch it and then his influence goes into where you

20
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.570
<v 1>are and then it's so widespread so quickly and there was such a fine romantic</v>

21
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:19.140
feeling to find a drummer or a record and fall in love with it and learn how to

22
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:22.770
plate it.
Uh,
no one else knew what you were working on your home alone.

23
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.740
It could have been a cold train,
it could abandoned van Halen,

24
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.810
it could have been both at the same time,
you know,

25
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:32.811
and try to kind of fuse this hybrid of yourself alone and the romance of a drum

26
00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:35.400
stick and a and an and the rhythm.

27
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.610
<v 0>How did you,
how did you come about?
Well,
your style like,</v>

28
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.220
like blew my mind when I first,
I first heard you,

29
00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:44.100
I missed the first few Jane's albums because I was,

30
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.380
I was neck deep in,
in and hair metal and all that.
And,

31
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.110
um,
when ritual came out,
it's just like,

32
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:56.430
that was the first time I really heard somebody with a,
uh,

33
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.450
that kind of music.
Just the sound of that and just all the snare,

34
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:04.110
just placement and all that.
It just,
it just wasn't that approach of like,

35
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:07.800
all right to enforce the snare and then I'm going to do some syncopated shit and

36
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.890
absolutely,
you know,
the base does this and I'm going to follow it with my foot.

37
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:15.010
And you just had you,
it was completely,
it was like almost upside down.
Like how,

38
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.200
how did you arrive at that?

39
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.193
<v 1>Well,
I was,</v>

40
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.440
I think the great drummers have great musicians around them and that brings the,

41
00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:27.220
the competition in the jam room brings better performances out of each other.

42
00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:30.310
So I was ultra aware of technique and chops,

43
00:02:30.311 --> 00:02:33.400
but I knew that really wasn't my forte.

44
00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:36.640
I didn't want to be a fast lightening drummer and they really find a place for

45
00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:41.530
that.
And the music I loved,
my early love was jazz buddy rich gene Krupa,

46
00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:46.050
Elvin Jones.
But no one in Los Angeles played trumpet,
Saxophone,
even piano,
right?

47
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.320
No one even played bass.
Everyone played guitar.
So then what are you going to do?

48
00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:52.060
You're going to bite into rock and roll.

49
00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:56.500
But that swung the award from Sabbath bottom.

50
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.740
And then I started to check out what the of Motown men and how that influenced

51
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.930
Ringo and Charlie and Ginger Baker and they were playing these Motown beats but

52
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.320
surrounded by great songwriters,
right?
And so this,
this fusion,

53
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:15.970
this hybrid of jazz swinging and the flash of rock and roll.

54
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.910
And then I kind of hit a ceiling.
I was bored.

55
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:23.500
I didn't know what other record to by genesis rush,
everybody,
everything.

56
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.020
And I said,
you know,
I,

57
00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:30.021
I've found through the Beatles probably Indian tabla rhythms and that opened the

58
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:32.800
door to African rhythms,

59
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:37.630
which was fella cootie in Bobbitt tune de Ella tune g chase these guys deep.

60
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.250
I have no idea what that these records were just as important as the,

61
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.100
the Abbey road record.
I tried to make that impression on myself.

62
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.280
Let those records become part of how important the rhythm can be,

63
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:53.920
not just these great songs that you grew up with,
listen to new rhythms.

64
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.630
And so those rhythms started to infuse my creative side.

65
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.990
And then I joined the marching band in high school.

66
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.590
So they have one shot chops and everyone was competitive.

67
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:09.490
One in first chair and everyone was showing what they had the flash.

68
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.790
So that could be bad for your playing creatively,

69
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:17.050
but it's good for your endurance and your confidence.
And how did,
how did you,

70
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:18.130
when were you

71
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.210
<v 0>mature enough when you went in there to see that this isn't what it's about,</v>

72
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.580
where it's like I would compare that in,
uh,

73
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.810
I'd done a little bit of acting work and in a few,
very rarely,

74
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:33.320
but a few times I've gotten into a scene with somebody and it's the silly as

75
00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:37.010
this sounds,
they get in like I'm going to out act you.
Yeah,
exactly.
Rather than,

76
00:04:37.011 --> 00:04:40.640
hey,
we're doing this together,
let's,
you know,
let's,
let's work together.

77
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.030
They get in,
they're like,
I'm going to out create you.

78
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.530
<v 1>It's a,
there's a tennis match.
It's going on,</v>

79
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:50.740
but you can't always ace the guy cause there's no match.
You want to rally.
Right.

80
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.200
So you do want to once in a while it's just,
you know,

81
00:04:54.201 --> 00:04:58.500
slam it in pink wine but you can't slam it every time.
Let's play,
let's rally,

82
00:04:58.501 --> 00:05:00.480
let's laugh,
let's communicate.

83
00:05:00.481 --> 00:05:04.080
And I think growing up in the Varo at 15 on,

84
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.980
it was my love affair with guitar and drums.

85
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.450
I didn't know much about base and that rhythm section yet cause no one played

86
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:14.520
bass.
I always want it to match the,

87
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.220
I always heard that if you played bass you could get into like 20 bands

88
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:22.080
immediately.
We ended up using the drums or guitar and sang if find one,
you know?

89
00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:23.070
Right.
So,

90
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.250
but I think when the band Jane's actually kind of to become aware of our,

91
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.940
what was important was the lyrics and the phrasing and he's not going to sing

92
00:05:35.221 --> 00:05:38.730
like this hair metal thing where you sing it four times and then you sing the

93
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:41.790
next thing four times.
It's not going to rhyme.
It doesn't rhyme.

94
00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:46.380
He says something once and then we react and then he says something three times

95
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.160
and then he says,
motherfucker.
And then you punch it behind them and then,

96
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:54.210
you know,
and then so it's a poem with song and then,
you know,

97
00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:59.211
so I think we started to become ultra aware of it's an emotional performance.

98
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.700
It's real estate.

99
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.930
Where are you going to place yourself and who are we going to get out of the way

100
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:10.790
of Doodoodoo kick up,
you know,

101
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.760
where are you going to,
where are you going to put your plant?

102
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.730
And it almost like a monopoly game.
You go over and over,

103
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.820
then you buy boardwalk and then you put a house on it.

104
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:20.900
Then you put a hotel on it.

105
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:25.400
You make your event more worthy when you guys know when you guys were going in

106
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:29.720
that direction because he means so much of it is,
you know,
you want to make it.

107
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.100
I mean,
you don't want to be homeless.

108
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.090
And what you guys were doing was so different despite when I listened to it,

109
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.120
you know,
uh,
you know,

110
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:42.120
a lot of your influences were the stuff that those guys that I was listening to

111
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.120
them the metal years were listening to.

112
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.260
When you start to make that departure of like,

113
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.850
this does not sound like what,
what,
you know,
that big thing,

114
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:55.640
what they're looking for.
Like what are you looking for a man?
What's the look?

115
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.650
This what was going on?
85 the strip was coming to an end,
motley rat poison.

116
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.880
It was already ending.
Then they all been signed and it was repetitive,

117
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:07.280
redundant to rivet and of each other.

118
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.630
What Jane's addiction would go downtown and there was x and the minute men,

119
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.670
the Chili peppers and fishbone,

120
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.080
and they weren't successful as far as getting signed to a major.

121
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.490
They kind of hit a ceiling.
The punk rock ceiling flag was there for,
you know,

122
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:26.600
fear.
It was circle jerks.
It was fucking fantastic,

123
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:28.160
but they weren't going to get any bigger.

124
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.460
I remember x got a song in the Charlie Sheen movie,
the baseball movie,

125
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.080
and I was like,
oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
The ex got a song in a movie.
That's what I get.

126
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.270
He said,
because punk rock hit a ceiling.

127
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.050
So there was that moment where metal was done,
punk rock post-punk.

128
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.760
So when you're world metal was done in [inaudible] 85 yeah,
there's already done.

129
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.400
It was gone in my world that then exactly three exact,
it was still poor,

130
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.530
but as it,
as a player,
and to create it as a,
it's,

131
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.740
it was trying to turn the key a little and change,

132
00:07:57.741 --> 00:08:00.320
I didn't want to be Tommy Lee anymore.
You know,

133
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:04.670
there was a moment you watch like,
because like say,
you know,
you was still a kid.

134
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.420
So MTV was so huge to our generation and,
and you know,

135
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:12.800
this scene is over.
Yeah.
And,
and right as you're saying,
it's over.

136
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:17.520
MTV is just as blowing and blowing it up to the next level.
And to the point,
man,

137
00:08:17.521 --> 00:08:20.480
when they,
they,
they would do like the top 10 and it was like,

138
00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:24.370
other than like a Paula Abdul and a Janet Jackson,
Michael Jackson,
like they,

139
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:27.730
they could break in,
um,
George,
Michael,
those people come.

140
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.740
But the rest of it was all pretty much hair metal if video's not civil or

141
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:38.450
pedestrian,
but safe in our opinion and completely produced in just the machine.

142
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.760
So what would you watch?
Was there someone,

143
00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:44.720
was there a cool MTV out there that you are watching or we would go dig out,

144
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.390
which was,
you know,
Eric and Perry,

145
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:50.120
which are almost 10 years older than me and Dave,

146
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:55.350
they would help us realize the importance of joy division and Bauhaus in new

147
00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:58.270
order,
an echo and Susie,
do you know,

148
00:08:58.271 --> 00:09:02.850
I'm just discovering joy division now almost 40 years later.

149
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.780
That kind of simple storytelling.
Yeah cause me and Navarro,

150
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:08.670
we're about van Halen and we wanted to show off.

151
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.850
They wanted to tell a story like those guys and cinematic set a scene and just

152
00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:17.540
tell the led the lyrics speak and of course me and they were still 18 whatnot.

153
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.900
We can play watch this and that's what the world needed.
The metal,

154
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.060
that's what la needed went global,
but it was the end of metal and a punk.

155
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.021
You know,

156
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:32.490
even the chilies and fishbone had records out and our very first tunes before

157
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:33.324
ritual,

158
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.720
dare I say influenced La funk idiots rule the pigs and Zan do too.

159
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.560
It was a chilly pad.
Could have been with the chili peppers show or a fish show.

160
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.940
And then we started to find our storytelling and our,

161
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.110
and I think our best moment back then was then she did on ritual.
When the lyric,

162
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.153
like I'm saying,

163
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.180
the lyric doesn't go four times and the music doesn't go three times behind it.

164
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.430
It's just that

165
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.120
<v 0>concisely,
that album,
I learned how to meditate.
I swear to God,</v>

166
00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:06.440
I used to put it on the liftoff.
Yeah.
And I would put it in,
I would put it,
uh,

167
00:10:06.441 --> 00:10:07.190
and I was really,

168
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:12.190
it was like the first time in my life I was realizing that I was fucked up cause

169
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.800
I look like Ron Howard,
my family looked like the Brady bunch.

170
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.500
We went to church every week and I thought,
hey,
you know,

171
00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:21.560
I got this off when I was a fucking,
you know,
I went to work,

172
00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:25.280
I was a good worker and all that.
And it wasn't until,
uh,
that way,

173
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.680
that's that weird thing.
I was running around 2122.

174
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.960
And that's right when you're supposed to be done with college.

175
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:31.340
You're supposed to know what you want.

176
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.240
You're on your way to your dream or whatever.
Put everything else behind you.

177
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.990
Move on.
Yeah.
And I felt I was just sorta like floating,
like what the fuck?

178
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.640
Like that whole part of my life has done,
college just went by.

179
00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:48.460
I'm still a freshman basically.
Now what,
what the fuck am I doing?
And um,

180
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.860
I don't know.
That's my issue started coming up so well,
the,
the ritual record,

181
00:10:51.861 --> 00:10:54.740
even though it was the end of the band was the,

182
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.700
<v 1>this,</v>

183
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.960
what you're hearing is us on tour and shaving all the parts and playing them

184
00:10:59.961 --> 00:11:03.770
live and becoming an emotional organism.

185
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.340
And that's the documentation of what we sounded like.
And it was,

186
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.450
if we had a great manager,
he would have said,
take a year off.
I see a future.

187
00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.930
Right.
We had a good manager just so you guys are gonna break up,
break up.

188
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.610
He wanted what was,
now we didn't give it to him,
so we didn't have any guidance.

189
00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:23.370
But infectious came immediately.
I was in Hawaii.
Those guys showed up.

190
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.150
But Robert and Trey,
you know,
arbitrary heal and Mike Mirror,

191
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.240
they're going on tour the Ozzy in two weeks.
I'm in a new band.

192
00:11:29.241 --> 00:11:32.660
So I didn't even think it was the wrong choice to break up.

193
00:11:32.661 --> 00:11:37.010
But why with something so beautiful and colorful,

194
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.820
just call quits.
No,
take a break.
And maybe you know,

195
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.480
like any hot relationship,
maybe take a break and then maybe see if it's,

196
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.420
it's still worthy but we didn't have any.
Yeah,
little space.

197
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.710
<v 0>And then they have a date night and hey see if you still like each other.</v>

198
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.710
<v 1>I am so happy how the,</v>

199
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:57.940
the porno for pyros sound became something that was different and we were able

200
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:01.540
to grow and we didn't.
I love and I love the uh,

201
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.000
the second album that's still one.
Uh,
was it take,

202
00:12:06.001 --> 00:12:10.540
he shouldn't be God's earth.
Bali.
I loved that album,
that,

203
00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:14.890
that making,
that record was using all the money Warner's gave us to travel,

204
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.160
write songs and then you just a little bit of money to record it.

205
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:24.210
I remember being all excited to watch Larry Sanders cause you guys were on and

206
00:12:24.331 --> 00:12:26.070
you've put way you go in and we uh,

207
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.950
yeah we had it all set up to do pets and then we got up there.

208
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.170
That's going to be a boring,
let's do me hot.
And that was a little more,
you know,

209
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.760
little charge but the band itself was,

210
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:41.710
was based on what I was saying earlier that that rhythm and phrasing of Perry

211
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.000
and I wanted to bring,

212
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.950
we didn't want to try to get a guitar soloist like we had in Jane's the

213
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:49.050
greatest,
right?

214
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.290
So Peter was more of a songwriter on acoustic guitar 12 string and we were out

215
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:56.800
with songs and with bongos around the camp you,

216
00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.450
you had like Bango six where you would normally have like rack toms because we

217
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:02.081
wrote the tunes,

218
00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:06.640
Campfire style with Bongos and acoustic guitars when we went into the studio,

219
00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:09.430
those sounds and frequencies needed to be there.

220
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:14.431
So I started to incorporate this hand drumming riding style into the drum kit

221
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.850
and make it a hybrid drum set.
So I'm not going to rely on beats.

222
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.610
So when you recorded that,
did you play with sticks?

223
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:25.360
So were you playing with your hands on hot rods and sticks?
Good question.

224
00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:28.630
You know,
the hot rods or the kind of splinter drumstick that,
oh,

225
00:13:28.631 --> 00:13:32.560
is that what that perfect thing quieter,
right?
Oh yeah.
And they kind of,
you know,

226
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:33.760
you can get into it still,

227
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:36.490
but you don't have to quite the attack and articulation.

228
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.630
A little bit of more of a spread.
But I,
the approach,

229
00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:44.710
because the bass player Martine was from Holland and he grew up with music.

230
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:48.370
I couldn't reference any sabbath tune or,
and he's up like,
you know,

231
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:50.560
there's upland Tony,
you know,
he grew up in Holly,
he couldn't,

232
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.130
so that made it quite interesting,
you know,
as far as a rhythm section,

233
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.870
we had nothing to kind of fall back on.
So it was all very fresh.

234
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.990
That's also interesting that someone could live in a part of the world that they

235
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.730
hadn't heard of.
Sabic exactly.

236
00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:06.760
That's Kinda sorta didn't everybody's like hard drive.

237
00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:10.690
It was an important like in America or Britain or the world.

238
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:16.220
That's interesting.
So right now you think you're doing right now is,
uh,

239
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.470
uh,
think experience.
That's right.
And this is like,
this is,

240
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.190
this really sounds cool.
So this is an la,
of course.
I'll look cool.

241
00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:28.680
Shit seems to happen.
Your,
especially when I'm on the road,
when you miss it.
Yes.

242
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.890
When you're in West Virginia,
uh,
it's wisdom art park.
Yeah.

243
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.480
This is a great experience.

244
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:38.620
What we're doing is the saxophonist from pink Floyd and supertramp and Toto

245
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:39.760
Scott Page,

246
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.870
me and him hooked up many years ago and we've always thought,

247
00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:48.460
wouldn't it be great to do pink Floyd music and our own way Norwood from

248
00:14:48.461 --> 00:14:52.610
fishbone,
the Bass player,
Kenny Olson,
the guitar player from Kid Rock,

249
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.450
we all were kind of hanging out in this pink Floyd state of mind.

250
00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.990
The Art Dome Wisdom opened up downtown and there were looking to fill the days.

251
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:07.510
Sometimes they've got a spin class,
sometimes they've got a,
you know,

252
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.990
a sound bath,
but it's always with these cool visuals.

253
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.830
So we brought the band in there and then you basically,

254
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.840
you can have either a folding seat,

255
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.500
a beanbag or a futon bed and the visuals above you.

256
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.980
It feels like you're a VR situation without the mask.

257
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.110
So even the band members experiencing what the audiences,

258
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.990
I'll see you laying down so when you look up at the dump,

259
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:33.810
so I was like wrap around.
Exactly.
I'm so fucking massive.
I'm still going.
Okay.

260
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.750
There's a couple of shows coming up.
You got to go.

261
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:40.250
There's other domes there that you can trip out on before the show and then the

262
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:44.810
big dome homes about 500 people and we play about an hour and a half of all

263
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:48.620
Floyd music with about 11 musicians to come and go with different singers.

264
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.120
You can look at the band,

265
00:15:50.121 --> 00:15:54.860
but why everyone's tripping and oohing and Ahhing at the events are you looking

266
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:54.971
at,

267
00:15:54.971 --> 00:15:59.690
I'm freaking out looking up and I've always wanted back in the day what it was

268
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:03.860
like not to be the cast member but the audience member during my Gig,

269
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:07.040
especially Jane's and Porno and shit was going on.

270
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:11.250
What's it like him there and I really am,
I'm just this,

271
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.830
we're seeing all the same thing.
Don't you find that once you've been like,
uh,

272
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.840
it took me a while but I'm about 27 years in now.
Okay.
Seasoned at this point.

273
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:26.000
And one of my favorite things to do is to actually walk into someplace big or

274
00:16:26.001 --> 00:16:26.630
small,

275
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.870
whether it's going to be the show and is nothing on like I don't have to go to

276
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:34.871
work and school and I get to sit there and watch comedy or watch a band was a

277
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.080
gain experience.
Oh,
I love it.
I love that is my fuel,

278
00:16:42.081 --> 00:16:43.850
my father to play more.

279
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:48.970
I love a big show even though sometimes musically you're disconnected and Faros

280
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.740
way over there and s you know Perry's hanging on a rope,

281
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.640
there's no visual moment,
but it's also some guide bungee jumping in a,

282
00:16:55.641 --> 00:16:59.000
in a Ferris wheel and you're playing mountain song.
It,
this is,

283
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.200
what are they thinking?
I love that.
So I kind of get that experience.

284
00:17:03.201 --> 00:17:05.360
I get to be an audience member.

285
00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:08.810
What is that like when you're on your way up and it's like the first place is

286
00:17:08.811 --> 00:17:09.644
you're playing,

287
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:13.150
it's almost the guys in your band are almost hitting your symbols and stuff that

288
00:17:13.151 --> 00:17:16.070
tie and then all of a sudden it's just like,
Oh hey,

289
00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:17.900
we finally in a place where there's a little bit of wrong,

290
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.350
I don't have to play like this.
I can actually have my kid,
you know it's true.

291
00:17:21.351 --> 00:17:24.910
Well,
what we try to think that and when that gets big,
we tell the techs,

292
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.610
please set us up close as much as possible even though we need to be spread for

293
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:31.730
the people way out there because once you start losing that,

294
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.750
that intimate connection with the band,
the music does change.

295
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.780
It's kind of like being in a on a phone call and the room is quiet.

296
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.720
You're going to know everybody,
every,
every word you're thinking,

297
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:45.590
but if the room is loud and noisy,
you can like,
Oh hey,
do you know what?
Yeah.

298
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.470
Oh Hey man,
come on in and you know,
that's kind of how the big shows are.

299
00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:51.410
You're like,
all right,
I'm with the guitar player.
Then I did that.

300
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.450
I haven't noticed something else is going on.
Right.

301
00:17:53.451 --> 00:17:56.040
And then ever cause you concern like you know,

302
00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:59.010
cause you always see a hair all like the Amy had four people,

303
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.600
four different personalities.
Absolutely.

304
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:03.270
At one point you're just playing and you like,

305
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:07.560
this is my best friend way the fuck over this standing in front of a fucking
fan.

306
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:12.120
He hasn't looked at me the whole show.
What are we doing?
Who are we?
What is,

307
00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.490
where's the band?
And somebody like crowd surfing and it,
which is,

308
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.770
that's the weirdest thing about music.
It was then becomes the height and,

309
00:18:19.771 --> 00:18:21.810
but then there's that,
that disconnect.

310
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.890
I mean I gotta think about Youtue and the chilies and Metallica,

311
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.630
there's this connection they have with each other.
That is,
Eh,

312
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.830
it seems to be very well spreaded in tight,
you know,
and the,

313
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.840
even though even stand close to each other on stage or they go satellite stage,

314
00:18:38.911 --> 00:18:43.911
a small little stage off the big one to show that unit and to feel that unit

315
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.370
because I almost would feel like you guys would have to uh,

316
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.660
you know when you get as big as like that with a band that you would almost have

317
00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:55.140
to schedule together time so you don't lose what got you there.

318
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.360
The one thing that's great about always with chains,

319
00:18:57.361 --> 00:19:02.361
we have a backstage jam room and that is a smaller instrument is a small amp,

320
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:03.624
small kit,

321
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:08.610
little pa and we go back there and play our favorites plus the tunes maybe to

322
00:19:08.611 --> 00:19:11.670
warm up.
Maybe tunes will be on stage.
I might possibly not,

323
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.030
maybe a friend will come and sing with us.
Those moments,

324
00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:20.290
right are the moments memories of 1986 we wrote the tunes on Santa Monica and

325
00:19:20.581 --> 00:19:25.560
vine.
Now those early days we shared a rehearsal place BulletBoys,

326
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:30.240
fishbone,
GNR and Jains.
And after you rehearse,

327
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:33.900
you put your gear in the corner and then you bring it back the next day.

328
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:34.801
And I remember,

329
00:19:34.801 --> 00:19:37.830
you know the bullet boys got a record deal and all of a sudden they had nuclear,

330
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.890
oh shit.
Yeah.
Then Benji and I got big,

331
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.100
their ship moved out and they got their own room,
you know,

332
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.910
but you could see progress,
you know,
and again it's possible.
No,

333
00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:50.940
but then that's that,
that,
that panic thing.
Like as a comic you start looking,

334
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:55.290
well that guy,
he started two weeks after I did,
he's moving and he's up there.

335
00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.480
I like,
I must be doing something wrong.

336
00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:02.580
So you actually sharing this space with people who are playing the music that

337
00:20:02.581 --> 00:20:06.700
people were saying,
this is it.
And you still had that,
that thing we did.

338
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.390
The other guys like gene error,
bullet boys.

339
00:20:09.391 --> 00:20:12.210
Were they listening to what you were doing?
I'm tied with Jimmy.

340
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.190
Dan to the drummer from the boys,
a bullet boys.

341
00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:17.190
And he said he was recognizing what was happening.

342
00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:22.191
He was not only feeling the sound was becoming redundant,

343
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.720
that was happening.
What's next?

344
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.030
But also the precision and the technique,

345
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:33.840
the technical plane was being lost in that type of metal music.

346
00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:38.820
And so we were trying to bring back our love of rush,
you know genesis.
Yes.

347
00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:41.730
You know,
there was like,
Whoa,
listen to what these cats are playing.

348
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.130
Even though there's a story we need to tell were from Hollywood and somethings

349
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.910
going to and mirror the lyrics of the mirror.

350
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.970
You know what I was thinking that was Saint Oh buddy of mine the other night.

351
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.730
Like in everybody like ragging on discos,
like a big thing.

352
00:20:54.731 --> 00:20:57.100
Everybody is like the worst fucking music ever.

353
00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.200
I will say the heavy metal ballad are some of the worst songs.

354
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.470
There's a few good ones scored me and it's just a fucked everybody.

355
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:09.480
I mean the Scorps did one big one lady lady something or about what it,

356
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.010
what about the,
you know,
the Berlin Wall?
I can't recall,

357
00:21:12.011 --> 00:21:13.600
but I couldn't remember who was home sweet home,

358
00:21:13.601 --> 00:21:16.660
which that that's not one of the worst ones.
But there are some out there,

359
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.760
the bands that became derivative,

360
00:21:18.761 --> 00:21:23.300
derivative derivative of a motley crew and yeah.
Yeah.
And then they,
that was,

361
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.950
they had to do that.
Now remember Keith Moon,
they said,
Keith,

362
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:29.020
when did you stop destroying the drums?

363
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.880
It's somehow stopped though.
You didn't notice,
but they stopped for this,

364
00:21:33.881 --> 00:21:37.390
you know,
and he said when it was in the set list of song number seven,
you know,

365
00:21:37.391 --> 00:21:40.300
destroying the drawn,
she had to do it.
They were done.

366
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:46.990
Act like you're upset at your,
at your,
uh,
your drum kit here.

367
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.370
Oh my God.

368
00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:56.371
A 24 inch bass drum head with a nothing shocking artwork.

369
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.950
Right.
We got to take a picture of this together afterwards.
Everybody can see it.

370
00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:01.960
You know,
you would love it.

371
00:22:01.961 --> 00:22:05.140
Especially because you love art and music and you play drums.
There it is.

372
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.770
That thing's been on the drum head and on the drums on tour,

373
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.300
but we never poke a hole in it.

374
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:14.010
We quit the mic mountain on the inside cause I can't take this.
You asked.
No,

375
00:22:14.011 --> 00:22:17.170
are you kidding?
It's a gift.
It's a gift to you because you low enough.

376
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.890
This is going up and my drum room dude,
you got it man.

377
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:23.590
What you do for music and art.
And I was,
uh,

378
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.170
I don't know if you've seen my act lately.
I don't know if I'm doing all of that.

379
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.880
Well,
he said it was a good thing.
I inspire you to go to a different direction.

380
00:22:30.881 --> 00:22:35.640
Like my act is basically like a heavy metal ballad and I'm sending it under

381
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:40.180
inspiring other comics to go into a different direction.
Well,

382
00:22:40.181 --> 00:22:44.320
my advice to anybody trying to,
to be a drummer or a musician,

383
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.730
of course it's technique,

384
00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:50.731
but don't look for that pat on the back because that's a bore you want to piss

385
00:22:50.801 --> 00:22:51.634
people off.

386
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:56.790
My actual goal is a drummer is to think of my three favorite artists.

387
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:03.220
They're the big ones,
seven to Delhi because he can paint like Rembrandt,

388
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.810
but he doesn't,
he puts a fucking rooster come out of the head.
It looks real.

389
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.520
You look closely,
it's broken.

390
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.570
And then there's MC Escher with the black duck and the white duck and the

391
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:18.550
rhythms and just continue the patterns.
I,
that's a drumming pattern in,
in art.

392
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.100
So this is way beyond me.
And then there's Pollock.

393
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.860
He spent his whole life like all of us trying to become,

394
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.370
he uses a brush and I wanted it to be behind them.

395
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.150
And then he said he threw the paint and that's what I thought.

396
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.390
That's what do I do when they give me a rock riff?

397
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.990
I'm going to do Baba tune geology.
Twingy
no,

398
00:23:37.991 --> 00:23:42.190
I don't be on me dude.
I hate when I go to museums,
they make me feel dumb.

399
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.070
So I go there and I'm just like,
I don't get everybody's doing,
but my

400
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.180
<v 0>wife is gradually trying to get me to be a little more uh,</v>

401
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.290
<v 1>well if the rhythm is so visual and of course even our bodies,</v>

402
00:23:53.291 --> 00:23:57.610
whatever your digestive rhythm is or your sleep rhythm,
you're,
whenever it is,

403
00:23:57.611 --> 00:23:59.410
we all have a rhythm that makes us feel

404
00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.680
<v 0>well,
what are you,
what are you,
what are you thinking when you're playing?</v>

405
00:24:02.681 --> 00:24:07.681
Because you always have like the biggest smile and it's like even if I didn't

406
00:24:07.901 --> 00:24:11.530
play drums,
I'd be watching you guys having the time of his life.

407
00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.090
<v 1>I am.
That is the,
I can't do wrong.</v>

408
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.490
Of course I can drop the stick or pull off something.

409
00:24:17.491 --> 00:24:20.790
The Ego can strike you if you think too much,
like you got it right,

410
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:25.680
but I can't do wrong as far as I remember seeing gene Krupa played drums in a,

411
00:24:25.681 --> 00:24:29.310
in a movie and they showed a guy conservative couple.

412
00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.880
He was tapping his hand and the wife's like,
ah,
but they went to her foot.

413
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:34.450
She was tapping her foot.
Right.

414
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.500
That's what drums make me feel like I cannot lose.

415
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.590
I'm going to make people feel good and life fucking sucks.

416
00:24:40.591 --> 00:24:44.970
Everything sucks or the world and moves the shit.
What is good is like my kid,

417
00:24:44.971 --> 00:24:49.560
my wife and the drums and I,
there's something fun.

418
00:24:49.561 --> 00:24:52.650
I remember my friends came by and bought a cow bell and they learned how to play

419
00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.550
beautiful girl or a dance the night away.
Van Halen

420
00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.550
and my friend's like Colin Jesus.
Then it was like,
you know,
this is exciting.

421
00:25:02.551 --> 00:25:05.940
It's hitting a home run for my friends or strangers,

422
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.290
<v 0>but it's,
it is.
I got,
you know,</v>

423
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:12.610
I got to compliment you hear as far as like the fact that your whole career,

424
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:17.680
you've always been going towards the art thing and then some out pays off,

425
00:25:17.681 --> 00:25:21.640
which is very rare because usually when you go that route,
it's painful.
Yeah.
Yes,

426
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:26.160
yes.
You're on the,
you're on the futon train is,

427
00:25:26.161 --> 00:25:28.750
is usually where it,
where you're at,
but you've,
you've always,

428
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:33.820
and then you will arrive with Jane's and then you still were able to go back to

429
00:25:33.821 --> 00:25:36.910
be like,
no,
this,
this feels good.
Let's,
let's put the Bongos in here.

430
00:25:36.911 --> 00:25:41.360
Let's do that.
Which was what nobody was doing that and what,
um,

431
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.850
I've experienced this in,

432
00:25:42.851 --> 00:25:47.851
in my career where I've gotten something and then I think of my next move on my

433
00:25:48.071 --> 00:25:49.780
next moves thinking,
well,
I'm here.

434
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:54.610
I got to try to stay here or go to that next thing in.
And it's like,
uh,
you know,

435
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.150
a two week or a two month hangover.
Absolutely.
The rush of that thing.

436
00:25:58.151 --> 00:26:00.370
And you've gotta be like,
we're not,
wait a minute.
Why did I,

437
00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:04.060
what was the reason I got into this business?
What did I want to do?

438
00:26:04.061 --> 00:26:08.170
So then it always goes back to going down to the clubs,

439
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.790
trying out a new bid,

440
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.680
having making another comic laugh and have them come come to you going to do

441
00:26:14.681 --> 00:26:17.760
this something there and then fee and then driving home,
you know,

442
00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.410
did a guest spot made no fucking money driving home,

443
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:24.190
excited going and then you're thinking and you're talking to yourself and people

444
00:26:24.191 --> 00:26:27.120
looking at you at red lights and you don't give a fuck all night.

445
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.180
I'm going to go down.

446
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.110
<v 1>That's the organic fuel that I still get.</v>

447
00:26:32.111 --> 00:26:35.620
I love those drum events and competitions even though the gospel chops of

448
00:26:35.621 --> 00:26:39.970
invaded.
But you see everybody must've rehearsed for the last two months.

449
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.950
You see even see the pros that have a 40 minute performance they you can tell,

450
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.250
you can tell if you,
I mean I would think cause those kids,

451
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:50.970
that's such a huge shot,
that guitar center thing kind of put it to sleep now.

452
00:26:50.971 --> 00:26:54.240
But you're right,
it was big.
It helped.
No,

453
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:56.270
I mean I still follow those and like a couple,

454
00:26:56.290 --> 00:27:00.060
two or three drummers that I became huge fans and watching their bands and
stuff.

455
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:04.530
And um,
but it's good for this.
It's good for the scene.

456
00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:08.880
It's good for drummers.
Yeah.
I those competitions,
like,
you know,

457
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.500
it makes a pros and amateurs tuneup,

458
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:17.370
practice more,
practice more.
That's it.
Let me,
I,
I tried to ask,

459
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.300
uh,
if I remember when I get with somebody of your talent level.

460
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.880
So the big thing you're always chasing,
no matter what you're doing,

461
00:27:23.881 --> 00:27:27.210
is kind of getting into a zone where it's like you're not even thinking and it's

462
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:28.470
just flowing through you.
And if any,

463
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.000
do you have a way of like,

464
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:37.500
um,
if you feeling like I'm in my head and I'm thinking about,

465
00:27:37.501 --> 00:27:38.820
and now I'm hitting the bass drum and I,

466
00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:43.130
but do you have any mental exercise that you do to a,
Steve,

467
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.230
get Outta your fucking head.
You're in New Jersey right now.

468
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.730
Look at that person over there.

469
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.180
Take him like do you have any tricks to get you out of the worst artistics

470
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.400
space,
which is sitting between your fucking ears?
Absolutely.

471
00:27:55.401 --> 00:27:58.920
Thinking what are you doing?
I mean there is so many ways.

472
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.570
As a drummer I can sit and practice and I'm alone a lot and there's a lot of

473
00:28:03.571 --> 00:28:06.720
alone time and a lot of my musician friends have a different schedule and not a

474
00:28:06.721 --> 00:28:10.470
lot of my musician friends have a job.
What am I going to do in my day?

475
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.390
I don't want to be faster.

476
00:28:12.391 --> 00:28:16.500
I just want to be more alert and be able to pull things off that I'm thinking

477
00:28:16.501 --> 00:28:17.520
with the technique.

478
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.270
But there is the time I'm sitting at the drum kit and I'm like,

479
00:28:21.271 --> 00:28:24.350
this is 100% meat.
This is so boring.
Right.

480
00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:28.200
Do a one 80 what exactly don't exactly what you wouldn't play.

481
00:28:28.201 --> 00:28:33.060
Go against your instinct and force it over and over and see what happens.

482
00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:37.490
Yeah.
And so I have to force myself to,
it's a,
you know,

483
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.790
get away from the endurance and the technique and the speed and the flow.

484
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:44.490
What's,
what's going to Zap me creatively?

485
00:28:44.491 --> 00:28:48.390
How the heck am I going to wake up creatively and come up with something new?

486
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.180
Is it putting a Bango in front of me that would help,

487
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.060
but that's not going to do it.
I've got to hit the thing.

488
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.660
How do you do this on tour?
You're on tour.
You're 40 fucking dates in.

489
00:28:57.661 --> 00:29:02.240
You want to go home,
you miss your wife and kid and your lights go down.

490
00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:04.290
Crowd's going crazy,
and you're thinking like,
oh Jesus,

491
00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:06.690
I would love to go back and take a fucking nap.
What do you do then?

492
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.490
I'm a complete believer in waking up and exploring cities,

493
00:29:11.491 --> 00:29:15.750
towns,
people,
the best sandwich shop,
the best record shop,

494
00:29:15.751 --> 00:29:19.590
the fountain where the punks hangout and then bring that to the Gig.

495
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.870
Even feed it to the singer.
Hey,

496
00:29:21.871 --> 00:29:26.160
they got a fountain down on Third I was at the fountain on the other place.

497
00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:30.690
Goes nuts.
That's a turnoff for everybody.
I love that.
And I,

498
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:35.310
and I put that into my plane,
right?
And I,
I tried to,
okay,

499
00:29:35.311 --> 00:29:37.590
why am I here?
Only play for 75 minutes.

500
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.530
This is a whole day away from home or whatever,
you know,
I'm missing.

501
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.930
<v 0>And so I do try to fuel it with that.
I'm fucking lucky.
I'm out of town.</v>

502
00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:51.910
I'm,
I'm,
I got a gig tonight.
Let's go enjoy.
I as a drummer,
the recognition,

503
00:29:51.911 --> 00:29:55.180
you don't get much of it.
You walk around town.
I don't have anybody bothered me.

504
00:29:55.181 --> 00:29:56.560
I don't know if that would be an issue,

505
00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:01.540
but I can imagine if you don't want to be recognized and you want that world to

506
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:04.930
get out there,
it could be a bummer.
Right.
Fucking really famous.
You know,
like,

507
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:05.861
you know what,
I always wish,

508
00:30:05.861 --> 00:30:09.640
I always wish they had that thing from star trek going be at home with your wife

509
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:11.650
and kid and kissed him.
I'm going to work.
And then they just,

510
00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:14.950
you just big beam beam you'd have,
Toronto is something,
I mean,

511
00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:18.430
how many times I want to clone to send them off to do the Gig.
Yeah.

512
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.700
And that's why I like Ag.

513
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.800
That's always a scary thought because then I sit there going,

514
00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:28.450
who the fuck am I to be?
Not,
you know,
enjoying this right now.
But then it's like,

515
00:30:28.451 --> 00:30:32.410
oh that,
well,
that's what makes human beings move forward is you get bored.

516
00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:35.710
Exactly.
We cannot just be there and just go,
this is perfect.

517
00:30:35.711 --> 00:30:40.460
I'm going to die over and over.
You know what I do is I just,
I go out and,
uh,

518
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.380
I try and just walk out and not say anything for my act.

519
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.890
This is how I get myself out of my head.
And then if that's not happening,

520
00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.840
even when I go into my joke,

521
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:54.100
what I start to do is I just try to tag it with different lines and blah,
blah,

522
00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:54.640
blah,
blah.

523
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.930
You don't be like the music music equivalent be improvin whatever like musical

524
00:30:58.931 --> 00:31:01.090
phrase it is,
and let's blow that out.

525
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:04.930
It's usually takes 92nd now it's going to take two minutes and 10 seconds.

526
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:05.521
But just,

527
00:31:05.521 --> 00:31:09.370
just the fact and those last 40 seconds that it's something that I hadn't said

528
00:31:09.371 --> 00:31:13.660
before,
even if it sucks,
even if I'm eating shit,
it's just like,
oh,

529
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.840
I'm bombing in Columbus,
Ohio is where I am right now.

530
00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.420
These people don't feel like they're getting their money's worth.

531
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:21.130
And then that gets the adrenaline going.

532
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:24.700
So I learned over the years because I used to not know how to get out of that

533
00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:28.840
and I would spend weeks or possibly months and then you get into like writer's

534
00:31:28.841 --> 00:31:32.980
block and I had to like figure out like how my brain works.

535
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:37.270
Like it works in a very straight line where like if I introduce yourself,

536
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.640
well if I,
like if I thought about a show,

537
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.540
I said three things that I liked and if I said one that I said early in the show

538
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:45.160
and then one of the middle of one,
the end,

539
00:31:45.161 --> 00:31:47.860
if the first one I thought about was in the middle,

540
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.520
that's where the tape starts and everything before it gets erased.
Gotcha.

541
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.210
It's like,
all right,
I don't know what the fuck that is,

542
00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.000
but that's how my brain works.
So I have to,
um,

543
00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:02.800
I've kind of learned like I don't tape shows and when I say something and I'm

544
00:32:02.801 --> 00:32:05.230
trying to remember,
I can't,
I just,
I let it go.
And Michael,
that's,

545
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.690
that's how it was said.
I learned that from watching you guys.
It was just like,

546
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:11.350
hey,
that's how the song came out that night.
That's the fill I played.

547
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.750
That's the thing,
the guy saying you don't have,

548
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.330
everything isn't so fucking precious,
precious.

549
00:32:16.331 --> 00:32:18.370
And there's also a sense of humor to it.

550
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:22.750
And that's what me and Navarro in Perry playing the chain song so many times

551
00:32:22.751 --> 00:32:24.190
with different bass players.

552
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:29.400
We have to duff mckagan and we had everything up Chris and flee and we kind of

553
00:32:31.781 --> 00:32:32.770
play with the arrangement.

554
00:32:32.771 --> 00:32:36.440
Perry might just not sing the first and dance around and Clayton,

555
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.980
it's playful and you got the no,
it's just,
you know,
this is,
that's

556
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.420
<v 1>a serious man.
It's a song.</v>

557
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:45.470
But if you're in the moment that makes it fun and I'll do something to like make

558
00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:49.730
my tech laugh or for Navarro or we'll do something backstage prior to the show,

559
00:32:49.731 --> 00:32:53.120
have an Halan ref and then Dave will pull it out during the Gig and look at me.

560
00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.470
That's fucking so cool.
It's kind of,
that's so cool.

561
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.920
He's a powerful force that they'll,
people are enjoying it at the same time.

562
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:04.280
There's an inner inside show within the show.
Yeah,

563
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:07.880
that is so fucking cool.
What are the dates of this?
This uh,

564
00:33:07.881 --> 00:33:10.530
the first weekend of April and the last weekend of April.
It,

565
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.030
that wisdom art park.
All right,

566
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:15.680
so the first two weekends in here because I'm going and I'm actually going to

567
00:33:15.681 --> 00:33:19.100
buy tickets before first weekend and last weekend.
Oh,
first Friday and Saturday.

568
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:19.300
All right.

569
00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.160
So I have to go to the first weekend because I'm out of town the last weekend

570
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:25.790
and I'm going to fucking get these tickets before this thing hits because I want

571
00:33:25.791 --> 00:33:28.750
to go see that.
I want to be fucking laying on my back listening.

572
00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:32.340
It's the next level experience and I'm going with the beanbag too.

573
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.700
Can I request that the,
I'll make sure you have the bag.

574
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:38.180
I had my nine year old come and he has brought like three or four friends and

575
00:33:38.181 --> 00:33:38.540
they were,

576
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.810
the other room's got a VR mask and one room is made of mirrors and light and

577
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.700
they were just exploring everything.
Right.

578
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:49.670
And it's so cool because now my music means more than just a,
he's a drummer.

579
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.150
They can realize and,
and his friends that it's an experience.

580
00:33:53.151 --> 00:33:54.110
I'm just a slice of it,

581
00:33:54.111 --> 00:33:59.111
but I want them to share this new technology because it's there and you know,

582
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:02.510
we can't ignore it and it's,
the Ai is here,

583
00:34:02.511 --> 00:34:04.640
but I want to use it as entertainment.

584
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.590
But of course there's other ways that they should think.

585
00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:10.700
It's cool that you play drums.
He loves it.
Man.
That's awesome.
You know,
sit there.

586
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.940
You know,
usually they get to the teenage years.
It's like,
Oh my God,
dad out,

587
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:18.830
he's dying being a rock star and he's nine.
He's got time.
Oh,
that's so cool.
Well,

588
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:22.890
um,
I don't know.
What else did I want to talk about here?
Oh,
you got a,

589
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:27.050
what do I got down here?
Oh,
I wanted to talk to you about the,
uh,

590
00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:31.110
when did you start playing barefoot?
This is what I'm going deep.
Let's go.

591
00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:32.960
People who aren't like drummers are listen,
like what?

592
00:34:32.961 --> 00:34:34.100
They've got home from school,

593
00:34:34.101 --> 00:34:39.101
1213 shoes and socks off that and then play drums till about five or six.

594
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.490
So I think that's just the natural taking the shoes and socks off at home.

595
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:48.670
And I play heels up and I play with the balls of my foot and my toes and I move

596
00:34:48.681 --> 00:34:52.580
up and down the pedal so there's no comfort zone with the,
for the shoe on.

597
00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:56.180
I get cramps in my toes going like a snail in there.

598
00:34:56.181 --> 00:34:58.940
It's like it's not working right.
But uh,

599
00:34:58.941 --> 00:35:01.920
there is something to say about the,

600
00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.310
the feeling of an extra weight of a shoe.

601
00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:07.190
And I definitely get a different sound when I have a shoe on and maybe there's a

602
00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:08.600
little more beef behind it.

603
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:11.510
I was going to ask you if like you're at a club and I was Steven's,
hey,

604
00:35:11.511 --> 00:35:13.610
come in and sit in.
You don't say hang on a second,

605
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.510
Mr. Rogers and take off your shoes and socks.
It's awful.
No,
I don't.

606
00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:22.400
I'll use what they guide.
But if when I get comfortable behind my kid,

607
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:27.140
I'd prefer to be in a pair of shorts and nothing else.
And play.

608
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.800
Do you still have the kit that you played on ritual?
Do you still have it?

609
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:35.870
What kind of drum kit was it?
That was wasn't my 1980 or 79 Ludwig.

610
00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.500
That was a Ludwig and then on ritual,
while that would doing ritual,

611
00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:45.030
we used some of my brand new Dwu kit as well,
which was just weeks old,

612
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.710
but there was a tour that we just finished using the same drums over and over.

613
00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:51.660
So you have that feeling,
and this is funny,

614
00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:54.720
when Jane's addiction got our first 10 [inaudible],
we go,

615
00:35:54.721 --> 00:35:57.570
let's go buy a new gear.
Navarro played Marshall's.

616
00:35:57.571 --> 00:36:01.560
He went and got Mesa Boogie Bass player played an peg.
He got trace Elliot.

617
00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:05.700
I had cracked Zildjian's.
I went and got pasty.
We went to rehearsal.

618
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.050
Sounded horrible.
Where was our sound?
It just,
we just bought a bunch of new gear,

619
00:36:10.051 --> 00:36:13.590
just put it in the corner.
It was a waste of money.
We got our old shit back.

620
00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.590
Oh no,
because that was how we sounded.
We needed,

621
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.530
we need to go by gathering.

622
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:20.583
<v 0>Isn't that funny?</v>

623
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:25.690
Like longing for this other stuff and you already had it.

624
00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.490
We had what we needed man.

625
00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.040
And I remember just putting all this shit in the corner.
He's got,

626
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:31.620
Oh while there was 10 k know.

627
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.113
<v 1>Huh?</v>

628
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:38.130
<v 0>What is,
you also did a project with one of the players from all the strokes,</v>

629
00:36:38.131 --> 00:36:40.040
right?
That's right.
Nikolai the base

630
00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.300
<v 1>player and I have a base,</v>

631
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:46.630
we have a band called the summer moon and we just did it maybe about 1530 shows

632
00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:51.800
opening for Guinea Harrison.
And it's such a cool community of young,

633
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.270
thoughtful musicians,

634
00:36:53.271 --> 00:36:58.271
creative people that are hungry to change and try new ideas onstage backstage in

635
00:36:59.931 --> 00:37:01.010
this,
in the studio.

636
00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:05.220
<v 0>Is that a,
is that a new project that you're working with?</v>

637
00:37:05.221 --> 00:37:08.300
Like the album's coming out on the moon?
We did an EPA about the,

638
00:37:08.301 --> 00:37:10.770
about a year ago and there's another eep common right now.

639
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:13.980
Cause that ban the strokes was a band that I was like,

640
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:18.981
I was like officially like old because I was freaking out and I was just like,

641
00:37:19.741 --> 00:37:23.040
I don't know who anybody is.
Kids.
So what is that name a kid?

642
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.050
And I was looking at him going like,
Oh my God,

643
00:37:25.051 --> 00:37:29.160
I'm like almost like 15 1215 years older than them.
And,

644
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.310
but that's another thing,
like I have to go back.

645
00:37:32.311 --> 00:37:35.070
All the music that I missed when I was growing up,

646
00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.170
I had to go back and start listening to that.

647
00:37:37.171 --> 00:37:39.870
And then there was the shit that I missed in the 90 especially hip hop and all

648
00:37:39.871 --> 00:37:41.040
that stype of stuff that I missed.

649
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:45.720
And then now I'm kind of getting into the two thousands and it just like just

650
00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:50.100
someone like 20 years too late for those guys.
So I,
uh,

651
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:54.460
I dunno this shit,
there's so much shit that to try and listen to.

652
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.250
<v 1>So,
but you know what I loved at the end of the eighties,</v>

653
00:37:56.251 --> 00:38:00.240
early nineties was the sound of the drummer.
He had something to say,

654
00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.680
Primus and Soundgarden and tool and Earl,

655
00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:07.290
the pearl jam and every drummer had something different than the other.

656
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.330
And they think the metal days,

657
00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:11.970
you're talking about every drummer wanted to be t Lee and the,
you know,

658
00:38:11.971 --> 00:38:16.200
they just,
it wasn't happening,
but it was a chance now to be yourself.

659
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.660
And if things change,
again,
it comes in waves.
You know,

660
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:20.700
that creative flow from the rhythm section.

661
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.390
Have you seen the Motley Crue movie yet?
The Darrell man,
I can't wait.

662
00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:29.110
<v 0>Oh,
it's so good.
It's so,
it's so like it's just,</v>

663
00:38:29.111 --> 00:38:32.740
it's perfect motley crew.
It's just awesome.

664
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:38.110
Ridiculous.
Just total and true.
True.
Yeah.

665
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:40.960
Cause somebody from the La Times gave one of them shit going like,
you know,

666
00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:43.920
cause they showed like all the groupies that they were banging and everything we

667
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.340
thing and they were just like,

668
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:50.080
just total lies the time you need to blah blah,
blah blah.

669
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.500
I think it was Tommy,
he was just like,
well I mean it happened.
I mean,

670
00:38:53.501 --> 00:38:56.470
do you want us to like rewrite history?
What are we doing here?

671
00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:01.600
And a story we're telling the story.
Yeah.
It was a really,

672
00:39:01.601 --> 00:39:05.650
uh,
yeah,
it was lie plastic motley crew and it was dark.

673
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:09.080
But in the end it overall,
it was like fun.
Yeah.
It was just,

674
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:12.910
and you walked out like,
dude,
what the fuck was that?
Like classic Motley show.

675
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:16.240
I just,
I can't say enough good things about,
uh,

676
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:20.620
I always fuck up that expression.
It's just fucking awesome.
I just loved it.

677
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.770
I loved it.
Well,
I got to play with Tommy.
We had methods,
may mayhem,

678
00:39:23.771 --> 00:39:24.640
double drummer,

679
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.150
and we sat right next to each other and I took the floor Tom out and that's

680
00:39:28.151 --> 00:39:31.720
where his high hat was.
That's how close.
Oh Wow.

681
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.060
And then he's saying you play guitar while I drummed in,

682
00:39:34.061 --> 00:39:35.890
then he joined me and let me tell you,

683
00:39:35.891 --> 00:39:39.130
I mean did the rehearsals were the highlights because he had two hours of me and

684
00:39:39.131 --> 00:39:41.680
him,
the band for hours and then they would split.

685
00:39:41.681 --> 00:39:46.010
He's like Perkins being you going all night.
It's t lead double drummer.
Yeah.

686
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:49.470
It was just,
I was just looking at his bad ass.
He is,

687
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:52.930
and I was just listening to that album that the one that was just called Motley

688
00:39:52.931 --> 00:39:56.090
crew where they had that,
that other sets,
right.
Dude,

689
00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:58.990
that album is so fucking underrated.
There's like it,
first of all,

690
00:39:58.991 --> 00:40:01.420
they put out an hour and you can see what they were doing.
It's like,
oh,

691
00:40:01.421 --> 00:40:03.550
we got a new singer,
we got to go hard.
It's,

692
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:08.560
I think it's Tommie's best drumming and mixed fire,
mixed best fucking riffs.

693
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.130
And that singer was just,
it was,
it was,
it was,
uh,
was incredible.

694
00:40:12.131 --> 00:40:15.280
And I was listening to,
I put it on,
it was at the gym.
It's like an hour long.

695
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:18.520
It was kind of perfect.

teeth.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:32.370
Why three out of four of us use bristles that are old,
worn out and ineffective.

I'm,

805
00:46:47.491 --> 00:46:49.650
I'm in love with it.
I'm going to have an affair.

806
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.760
I have to talk to my wife about this toothbrush and that's why I love quip and

<v 4>Hey,
what's going on?
It's Belper and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday.</v>

859
00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:46.480
The fuck is it?
March 28th,
2011.
Oh my God.

860
00:50:46.481 --> 00:50:48.820
How is march already over

861
00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.990
and like a lamb out like a lion?

862
00:50:52.991 --> 00:50:55.960
Did the fucking goats see its shadow?

863
00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.960
That's one of the great things about living in a desert.

864
00:50:58.961 --> 00:51:02.140
You don't have to listen to that dumb shit when it comes to February and March.

865
00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:05.830
You know when you live in the desert,
the desert area,

866
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:10.420
I don't have to deal with that shit.
What do you think's going to happen?

867
00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:13.750
It's been so mild in the beginning of March.

868
00:51:13.751 --> 00:51:17.410
Does that mean it's going to get temp temp to west towards the end?

869
00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.690
I don't know.
There Sharon.
I don't know what's going to fucking happen.

870
00:51:22.691 --> 00:51:26.800
All I know is that it's going to be 70 degrees out every day for the rest of my

871
00:51:26.801 --> 00:51:29.350
life.
Provided I stay out here.

872
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:34.210
I'm speaking of the desert.
I a actually visited,
a friend of mine,

873
00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:38.960
visited it at it,
a friend of mine,
um,
out in the desert buddy.

874
00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:43.860
Mine is,
had,
uh,
at a baby girl.
Well,
he didn't have it.
His wife had it.
Who else?

875
00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:49.420
Douche.
I'm sorry.
It's an old joke.
I'm sorry.

876
00:51:49.421 --> 00:51:51.820
I'm get settled in here and getting settled in.

877
00:51:51.821 --> 00:51:55.450
Let me get settled into the podcast before you start rolling your fucking eyes

878
00:51:55.451 --> 00:52:00.230
at me.
And yet God damn cubicle.
All right.
Little Miss.
Ooh,

879
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.790
I'm going to get an office someday.
Is that what you think that,
that,

880
00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:06.130
that cubicle represents?
Look at.

881
00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.780
They already gave me half the walls and no ceiling.
I mean,

882
00:52:10.781 --> 00:52:14.950
where else can you go from here some day?
I'll have a door.

883
00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.060
Um,
I got news for Ya.
All right.

884
00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.130
If you're in a cubicle right now,

885
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:26.190
why don't you fucking grow a Dick that includes the old ladies.

886
00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:31.750
Get some fucking balls.
All right.
Take out a quarter.

887
00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:37.360
And why don't you stick it in those plastic bolts that are holding the walls of

888
00:52:37.361 --> 00:52:40.570
your cubicle?
Upper right?
I'm not saying take your fucking cubicle down.

889
00:52:40.571 --> 00:52:41.890
Why don't you just loosen them up,

890
00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:46.430
add a little chaos to the day so the next time your boss comes over like dead

891
00:52:46.431 --> 00:52:51.110
Douche in that movie office going,
Yay,
I'm going to need you to,
yeah,

892
00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:52.960
when he leans on that fucker,

893
00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:58.780
maybe he'll fall backwards and smack his head off that all weather carpet,

894
00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:04.230
you know that has a very thin layer of padding and then it's concrete and then

895
00:53:05.021 --> 00:53:07.990
you could act like you're concerned.
I don't know what happened.

896
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:09.400
And as people sit there,

897
00:53:09.401 --> 00:53:12.790
you know freaking out because the guy's eating his tongue at that point in the

898
00:53:12.791 --> 00:53:15.400
middle of a fucking seizure.
You just,
you know,

899
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:20.530
subtly really tighten the bolts.
So then it looks like,
Hey,

900
00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:24.670
maybe this,
you know,
there's no evidence of why this guy just fell over.

901
00:53:24.671 --> 00:53:29.220
Maybe has health problems,
at which point his health insurance,

902
00:53:29.221 --> 00:53:30.390
they're going to fucking drop him.

903
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:34.680
He'll then be seen as unstable by the company and guess what?

904
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:38.310
His fucking office is going to open up.
All right.

905
00:53:38.311 --> 00:53:41.580
That's how you get a fucking office nowadays in corporate America.
Okay.

906
00:53:41.581 --> 00:53:45.030
You think you're going to sit there with your nose to the fucking spreadsheets,

907
00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:49.650
you know,
doing all that actuary horse shit,

908
00:53:49.651 --> 00:53:54.210
trying to figure out how long the average person's prostate.

909
00:53:55.610 --> 00:53:58.200
I had a fucking,
whatever the fuck you guys do out there.

910
00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:01.620
If you live in Nebraska and you have four headed fleet from a fucking court

911
00:54:01.621 --> 00:54:05.550
field,
you have an average lifespan of 67.8 years.

912
00:54:05.551 --> 00:54:09.840
Nobody cares.
You know,
she amazes me about that shit.

913
00:54:09.841 --> 00:54:14.010
That's somebody's passion,
like just sitting like the way I love comedy.

914
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:17.670
You know the way a serial killer loves murder.

915
00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:22.940
There's somebody out there sitting in a cubicle just looking at figures and just

916
00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:26.640
seriously has a song in their heart.
You know,

917
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:31.700
a little bit of Christmas in their eyes as they try to figure out how long the

918
00:54:31.981 --> 00:54:34.290
average person in Japan is going to live.

919
00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:37.890
Now that there's radioactivity in the ocean,
you know,

920
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:43.140
they want to get there first to predict the death day of somebody over there.

921
00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:46.140
I got to met to that shit that's going on over there in Japan.

922
00:54:46.141 --> 00:54:49.020
I told you about that last week,
but that's just fucking freaking me out.

923
00:54:49.021 --> 00:54:53.640
Those poor people over there.
Uh,
you know,
and I'm telling you,
I,

924
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:57.130
considering I don't go to the Catholic church anymore,

925
00:54:57.150 --> 00:55:00.240
I'm going to start going to the Church of fucking Ted Nugent.

926
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:04.170
I'm not going to start referring to myself as uncle bill and feel like as though

927
00:55:04.171 --> 00:55:06.480
I'm rebelling against something.
But I definitely,

928
00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.600
I definitely think I need to secure my perimeter.

929
00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:17.570
Do you know my girl won't let me get a fucking water bubbler water bubbler,

930
00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.370
not one of the a water cooler.
She just won't let me do it.
She's,

931
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:23.190
she's such a fucking broad.

932
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:29.010
I'm sitting there watching the disaster unfolding over there in Japan.

933
00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:33.000
Go and look at these poor people.
They live on a fault line.
Just like us.

934
00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.670
Look at the panic and fucking confusion.

935
00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:40.230
When you take the average person who doesn't know how to live outside and you

936
00:55:40.231 --> 00:55:44.310
force them to live outside,
they're walking around,
you know,

937
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.930
without a laptop and a cell phone.
Probably for the first time,

938
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:52.350
I'd say in 15 years,
but that's more American.

939
00:55:52.351 --> 00:55:55.950
We're talking Japan here probably for the first time in 30 years over there,

940
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:58.410
you know,
with their fucking advancements.

941
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:01.230
And it's just like I'm looking at them like,
okay,

942
00:56:01.231 --> 00:56:04.260
number first thing you fucking want.
Yeah,

943
00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.790
you want some water when can go 30,
30 days without food.
Right.

944
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.630
But water,
you can only go three days.
So here I am going,
you know,

945
00:56:12.631 --> 00:56:14.100
we've got a couple of fucking,
you know,

946
00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:18.650
gallon jugs of Arrowhead in a,

947
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:22.650
that's not an advertisement.
There's no advertisement on this podcast yet.
Okay.

948
00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:25.360
But I am subtly throwing it out there to arrowhead.

949
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.720
Let me just start mentioning products on my podcast.
You know,

950
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:33.570
I'm sitting here in my craftmatic adjustable bed.
Dude,

951
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:39.460
he's totally whoring himself out.
The fucking podcast sucks now.
Wow.

952
00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:40.323
Fucking put your,

953
00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:45.150
you put your fucking head down in your plastic desk right now.
All right.

954
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:51.310
Right there.
Fucking staples.
Shut your face.
Anyways,
so we got,
uh,

955
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:56.050
we got like two gallons of fucking water in our refrigerator and that's it.
Okay.

956
00:56:56.051 --> 00:57:00.970
Those coolest man he got,
he got five gallon jugs.
So you get two of those.

957
00:57:00.971 --> 00:57:05.950
You always have about,
you know,
roughly at least five gallons of water anywhere,

958
00:57:05.951 --> 00:57:10.300
all the way up to like seven to nine.
Who the fuck knows,
right?
Well,

959
00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:13.210
maybe you get lucky.
The earthquake hits when you got two full ones,

960
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:17.890
and then when everybody around you is dying of fucking thirsty and you're

961
00:57:17.891 --> 00:57:21.910
sitting in there sipping your water,
you know,

962
00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:23.830
sipping your water,

963
00:57:23.831 --> 00:57:27.880
running your hands through your gold coins with the fucking nine millimeter

964
00:57:27.881 --> 00:57:31.900
between your fucking legs,
you're going to,
you're going to feel,
okay.

965
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.340
See,
that's how Americans look at a disaster.

966
00:57:36.341 --> 00:57:39.460
It's not let's all get together and try to fight through this.

967
00:57:39.461 --> 00:57:43.600
I told you last week,
it's gangs in New York over here.
All right,

968
00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.870
English people before you get on your fucking high horse,

969
00:57:46.871 --> 00:57:50.080
if there was a fucking giant earthquake that affected all of Europe,

970
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:52.240
you're going to get,
you're going to help the French people out.

971
00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:56.530
You're going to help out the Krauts,
[inaudible],
all those guys,

972
00:57:56.531 --> 00:57:58.780
they're with their wooden shoes over there in Holland.

973
00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:04.690
Fucking tap dancing along with a fucking cow or some shit.

974
00:58:04.691 --> 00:58:09.670
Whatever they do over there smoking weed,
you're not going to help out.

975
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:14.110
You're not all right to shut your faces.
Anyways,

976
00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:16.180
so this is what I'm talking about.

977
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:20.950
I'm talking about preparing yourself for a fucking disaster.
All right,

978
00:58:20.951 --> 00:58:22.570
and what is my girl concerned about?

979
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:26.530
I just don't know where we're going to put it.
It just,

980
00:58:26.531 --> 00:58:31.090
you need to measure it first.
We can't put it over there.

981
00:58:31.091 --> 00:58:32.980
That doggie dishes there.

982
00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:38.230
The doggie dish is going to float out the fucking windows,
you know?

983
00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:41.410
No wait,
we're up on the second floor and on the hill.

984
00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:45.460
We're on in the hill on a hill,
right?
We're going to be fine.

985
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:49.600
I'm further enough away from the fucking ocean.
I'll tell you,

986
00:58:49.601 --> 00:58:52.420
if a tsunami hits me,
where the fuck I'm at,
I don't want to live.

987
00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:57.190
You know what I mean?
Kevin Costner though.
Real Kevin Costner,

988
00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:01.090
not even him playing his character in waterworld.
They'll real Kevin Costner.

989
00:59:01.091 --> 00:59:04.000
We're probably float out of the Hollywood hills right past me.

990
00:59:04.001 --> 00:59:07.780
That's when I take out my nine millimeter and I fucking aim it right at his

991
00:59:07.781 --> 00:59:10.990
receding hairline.
You know,
I should fucking talk.
Right.

992
00:59:10.991 --> 00:59:15.670
And I just fucking blow his brains out and I take his little raft,
you know,

993
00:59:15.671 --> 00:59:18.730
there's going to be some half dress hot hot little whore on,
on the,

994
00:59:18.731 --> 00:59:19.900
on the raft to right.

995
00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:26.380
Can't have a fucking disaster movie unless there's a scantily clad whore in the

996
00:59:26.901 --> 00:59:30.350
middle of it.
Um,
so anyways,
yeah,
that's what the fuck she is all about.

997
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:32.750
That's what the fuck she's all about.

998
00:59:32.751 --> 00:59:35.570
She doesn't know where we're going to put it.
And I'm sitting there going,
well,

999
00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:35.931
you know,

1000
00:59:35.931 --> 00:59:40.130
I could break down some of the shit in my office and she's just like water

1001
00:59:40.131 --> 00:59:43.550
poplar,
water cooler and an office that's just,

1002
00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:45.251
you know,

1003
00:59:45.251 --> 00:59:49.600
I was watching that fat con to went to jail for the stock shit the other day.

1004
00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:54.150
Never remember her name.
And uh,
what does it Mandy,

1005
00:59:55.630 --> 01:00:00.000
she's got that Goddamn bowl cut.
I know.
I know.
This one.
I'm going to scream it.

1006
01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:01.140
I'm going to tell you right now,

1007
01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:03.840
later on the podcast when I'm not thinking about it,
I'm going to remember it.

1008
01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:09.150
I can't fucking it.
I keep thinking Rhonda Shear.
I know it's not that.

1009
01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:13.410
What is your flubs is the name of the chick who fucking shows you how to make a

1010
01:00:13.411 --> 01:00:15.930
pie,
but for some reason doesn't do it.
She goes,

1011
01:00:15.931 --> 01:00:17.730
this is how you make the perfect Pumpkin Pie.

1012
01:00:17.731 --> 01:00:21.030
And then she calls in some immigrant to do it for on a cooking show.

1013
01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:22.110
How I keep having it.

1014
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.150
Why don't we keep thinking Madeline?
She said fucking ship from Connecticut.

1015
01:00:29.151 --> 01:00:32.790
Self made woman.
I respect her.
You know,
I felt bad for her.

1016
01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.580
She was the Oswald's of Wall Street.
She was the patsy.

1017
01:00:36.581 --> 01:00:38.650
She's the one that went down.
They didn't get any of the bankers.

1018
01:00:38.651 --> 01:00:42.790
They just got her right knee.
She gets her pubes highlighted.

1019
01:00:42.791 --> 01:00:47.350
Do you think she has that kind of money?
Martha Stewart.
Bam.

1020
01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:50.200
I got it.
Uh,
you know,

1021
01:00:50.201 --> 01:00:54.580
you'd be having some money when you get your pubes dad baby.
Y'All ready?

1022
01:00:54.581 --> 01:00:56.170
Next for this next motherfucker come,

1023
01:00:56.171 --> 01:01:00.550
which is the stage is mother fucker representing day.
I'm sorry,

1024
01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.490
I had a flashback to some old shows.
Uh,
anyways,

1025
01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:08.380
he's speaking of survival.
Okay.
I drive a Prius,

1026
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:12.470
you know,
so you know what I love about it.
Prius is,

1027
01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.020
it's not the gay his car on the road anymore because Nissan has come out with an

1028
01:01:16.021 --> 01:01:19.380
all electric car called the leaf.
Okay.

1029
01:01:19.381 --> 01:01:23.130
I challenge you to come up with a gay or name for a car.
All right?

1030
01:01:23.131 --> 01:01:27.060
And I'm not attacking the fucking homosexual assault for there.
All right?

1031
01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.220
As far as I can tell,

1032
01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:32.130
there's a lot of gay guys that could kick the living shit out of me and have

1033
01:01:32.131 --> 01:01:32.851
their way with me.

1034
01:01:32.851 --> 01:01:37.851
So the last thing I want to do is make someone mad at me who oddly may want to

1035
01:01:38.581 --> 01:01:39.414
fuck.

1036
01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:45.960
I'm just saying it's gay as in it's fucking lane.
Okay.

1037
01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:50.220
And all you fucking gay people can go fuck yourselves.
All right.

1038
01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:53.160
That's what words do.
They morph into other shit.

1039
01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:55.650
Gay use domain mean really happy.

1040
01:01:55.860 --> 01:02:00.060
The gay nineties the 1890s were known as the gay nineties that didn't mean there

1041
01:02:00.061 --> 01:02:03.930
was a bunch of guys out there blowing each other.
Right.

1042
01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:07.470
Just meant everybody was happy.
They were happy and gay.

1043
01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:12.510
Those are the gay and that old anxiety song.
The new year song may all equate,

1044
01:02:12.511 --> 01:02:16.850
ditch be forgotten about Duba okay,
Eh,

1045
01:02:16.851 --> 01:02:20.460
let's all be gay,
right?
Something like one of those fucking songs.

1046
01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:25.650
Uh,
is it in the birthday song?
The word gay is in something.

1047
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.800
I don't know what it is.
It's a song that I hear like once a year and I'm like,

1048
01:02:28.801 --> 01:02:30.690
yeah,
that's funny.
That gay used to mean happy.

1049
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:34.110
Now it means you want to dive on your girlfriend's muff

1050
01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:39.570
whilst you have a muff yourself.
You know,

1051
01:02:39.571 --> 01:02:42.270
isn't that kind of just greedy?
You know,

1052
01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:48.210
it sorta the biggest loser of sexuality to be gay.
You know,
I have a dick.
Oh,

1053
01:02:48.211 --> 01:02:49.680
I kicked you once is not enough.

1054
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:54.530
You selfish can't you got to go have another one?
Jesus Christ.

1055
01:02:54.531 --> 01:02:59.190
He's fucking gluttonous gay people.
Um,
these,
why do the POC?

1056
01:02:59.191 --> 01:03:02.100
I tried to do a fucking podcast last night and it sucked.

1057
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:05.790
I need a good night's sleep before I do a podcast cause I was driving out from

1058
01:03:05.791 --> 01:03:10.770
the dance here,
uh,
because my buddy had a,
a,
you know,
his wife had a baby,

1059
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:13.500
a beautiful,
beautiful fucking baby girls.

1060
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:15.930
And it's such a relief when you show up in the baby's gorgeous.

1061
01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:19.380
Isn't it such a fucking relief,
you know,
cause some of them when they come out,

1062
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:24.090
obviously they're like a little bit early or they're a little weird looking.

1063
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:28.640
Their fucking head hasn't fused together yet.
Right.
And they look like,
uh,

1064
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:34.170
they look like an octopus.
Some of them,
if you chopped off four of its arms,

1065
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:40.860
actually six of its arms and then you put two legs in place of the two arms.

1066
01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:45.570
Right.
Bill,
we get it.
We can do basic math.
Yeah.
You don't have,

1067
01:03:45.571 --> 01:03:49.920
it's got those little octopus heads and you've got to sit there.
Hey.
Wow.

1068
01:03:49.921 --> 01:03:52.530
Look at that.
Uh,
yeah.
Why don't you,

1069
01:03:52.531 --> 01:03:55.050
is there any way you can stick it back in front of the a couple of weeks,

1070
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:58.890
you know,
Vellum thinks you've attacked in your podcast.

1071
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.380
I draw the line at babies still yet.
Why do you draw the line of babies?
Huh?

1072
01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:06.300
Cause you can feel it kicking in your womb.

1073
01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:12.030
I am really just being crass on this one.
Um,
who gives a shit?

1074
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:15.180
How far into this podcast are we?
Oh,
13 minutes,

1075
01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:18.560
halfway through the first period over halfway.

1076
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:21.650
Speaking of how that you guys see the Bruins Bruins made the a just clenched a

1077
01:04:21.651 --> 01:04:23.730
playoff berth by finally beaten.

1078
01:04:23.731 --> 01:04:28.731
The fly is v Time I watch a Bruins flyers game they lose unless it's a playoff

1079
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.533
series.

1080
01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:34.050
And then they just when the first three and then lose the next fucking four.

1081
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:38.490
But as the first time I watch the Bruins flyers game in a long time and uh,

1082
01:04:38.491 --> 01:04:43.491
they actually want to God damn good team flyers have and the fucking rangers

1083
01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:48.630
scare the shit out of me with Henrik Lundqvist motherfuckers stop and

1084
01:04:48.631 --> 01:04:52.470
everything.
But I think Tim Thomas is a better goalie.
Uh,

1085
01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:56.400
and I think we know something.
We've oddly adjusted very well.

1086
01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:02.100
Uh,
once we trade it all Douche face there and he does have a Douche face.

1087
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:03.263
Phil Kessel,

1088
01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:07.740
you guys watching the NFL network where for some reason when they say NHL
hockey,

1089
01:05:07.741 --> 01:05:11.220
they have to tap.
The guys do these stupid dramatic,
like they'll,

1090
01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:16.170
they're not facing the camera and then they turn around and they're all sweaty

1091
01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:19.300
and they this look on their face,
not happy,
not sad.

1092
01:05:19.301 --> 01:05:22.930
Just sort of staring intensely at that.
It's like I get it.
It's hockey.

1093
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:26.920
It's an intense sport.
You know the guy couldn't towel off before this.

1094
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.530
Is he sweating from being under the lights?

1095
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:33.640
Am I really supposed to believe that he just skated over to the bench and you

1096
01:05:33.641 --> 01:05:36.820
were able to black out the entire arena and now he's staring at you?

1097
01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.130
Well some of them look cool.

1098
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:42.640
Some of them look intimidated and some of them look okay.
But Phil Kessel,

1099
01:05:42.641 --> 01:05:44.050
he just looks like a Douche bag.

1100
01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.270
I don't understand it cause he's a fucking great player.

1101
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:51.420
But you see his puffy baby fat cheeks when he turns around and he just looks

1102
01:05:51.821 --> 01:05:55.780
like the kid that you would cross check even if his fucking parents were

1103
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:58.660
standing on the side,
you know,
if you play like street hockey,

1104
01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:02.590
then you try to play it off.
Oh I'm sorry.
And is he cried?

1105
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:07.730
It would make you have a nice feeling,
right?
And your heart,
you know,
my,

1106
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:12.460
the only psycho like that
wasn't there always one kid in your neighborhood.

1107
01:06:12.461 --> 01:06:15.160
You just love to see cry,
you know.

1108
01:06:15.161 --> 01:06:19.600
And was there anything better that when somebody else did it and you didn't do

1109
01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:19.751
it,

1110
01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:24.730
so you could actually sit there and laugh and enjoy the kid crying and he didn't

1111
01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:27.520
have to run away when his parents came running out of the house.

1112
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:31.180
Does that scenario even exist anymore with you fucking

1113
01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:37.890
this new generation of fucking cons out there who spent their entire childhood

1114
01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:42.070
inside on the Internet and playing fucking video games?
You missed out.

1115
01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:46.450
You missed out back in the day when you used to play outside.

1116
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:50.890
There was always one kid and he was fat or he was fucking weird looking.

1117
01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:55.000
So what you did was you picked on him.
Unless he was funny,

1118
01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:00.100
he realized,
okay,
I gotta be funny.
You know,
kind of like make,
when I was a kid,

1119
01:07:00.101 --> 01:07:04.570
I looked like opie with a little bit of Ralph mouth and I realized,

1120
01:07:04.571 --> 01:07:06.370
I realized this.
I'm like,
wow,

1121
01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:10.390
I'm the only one who has this fucking hair color in my neighborhood.

1122
01:07:10.450 --> 01:07:14.170
I look like a fucking freak.
I bet.

1123
01:07:14.171 --> 01:07:17.440
I bet to start fucking common with the jokes here.
I did and that's what I did.

1124
01:07:17.441 --> 01:07:20.860
I used to God sign a little Tuxedo and I would just start,
hey,

1125
01:07:20.861 --> 01:07:22.660
interesting happen thing happened Amea,

1126
01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:24.720
the middle of getting potty trained or whatever.
I would,

1127
01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:28.630
I would have jokes because uh,
yeah he used to get the shit kicked out of me.

1128
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:31.750
What do you think that kick of ginger days?
It's something new.

1129
01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:36.610
I think we always haven't been picked on.
Um,
anyways,

1130
01:07:36.611 --> 01:07:39.160
what the fuck am I talking about here?
Well that's something that I get,

1131
01:07:39.161 --> 01:07:42.040
I've gotten a lot lately from people.

1132
01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:44.260
People think I don't understand the Internet,

1133
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.370
which I think is absolutely hilarious.
Like this something to get it Kinda,

1134
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:53.830
it is what it is,
you know what I mean?
It's like how don't I get it?

1135
01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:58.420
Cause I call you out when you do dumb shit.
You know,

1136
01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:01.630
I was on the Joe Rogan podcast,
uh,

1137
01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:06.640
this past week and a fucking amazing podcast.

1138
01:08:06.641 --> 01:08:09.850
I go there and Joe's like,
dude,
you know,
whatever time you want to come over,

1139
01:08:09.851 --> 01:08:12.730
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I said,
all right,
why don't we say 12 noon?

1140
01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:14.950
Cause I don't want to get stuck in rush.

1141
01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:19.310
Basically how it works out here in La is you got to schedule everything between

1142
01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:23.610
between 10 and two in the afternoon.
That,
anytime I haven't been any.

1143
01:08:23.611 --> 01:08:28.140
When do you want to meet?
Between 10 and two.
All right.
Buddy of mine,

1144
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:32.540
Al Madrigal,
hilarious comedian.
Definitely check them out.
Al Madrigal,

1145
01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:36.910
he's the one who he told me to do that.
So I go 10 between 10 and two now.

1146
01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.710
I'm not going to go there at 10 in the fucking morning.
I said,
all right,

1147
01:08:39.711 --> 01:08:43.670
I'll go there at 12 noon.
So I'll do 12 noon.
I'll get out of there.
Two,

1148
01:08:43.671 --> 01:08:46.280
two 30 all avoid rush hour traffic.
Right.

1149
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:50.270
And His fucking podcast is so much fun.
I think we did like a three and a half,

1150
01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:54.410
four hour fucking podcast.
You know,
it took us like a half an hour to settle in.

1151
01:08:54.411 --> 01:08:58.220
So we started at 1230,
you know,

1152
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.700
he gave me this coconut water that was so fucking delicious.

1153
01:09:01.701 --> 01:09:05.870
I actually came home and immediately went on to Amazon in order to fucking case

1154
01:09:05.871 --> 01:09:09.560
of it.
12 pack is what I got.
You know,
alligator armed it.

1155
01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.880
Uh,
now cause I didn't want to get a case,

1156
01:09:13.881 --> 01:09:16.310
I just wouldn't want to deal with my girlfriend going first,

1157
01:09:16.311 --> 01:09:20.090
a water cooler and now a case of coconut water.

1158
01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:24.650
Where are we going to put the cereal?
I didn't want to deal with that,

1159
01:09:24.651 --> 01:09:28.460
so I only got the fucking 12 pack.
All right.
So anyways,

1160
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:31.280
we start the podcast and we just have a great time.

1161
01:09:31.281 --> 01:09:34.640
Fucking went through the whole thing.
I definitely suggest you listen to it.

1162
01:09:34.641 --> 01:09:36.800
I of course don't have the link because I'm an asshole,

1163
01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.810
but just look up Joe Rogan podcast.
He gets like 250,000 hits a week.
Um,

1164
01:09:41.811 --> 01:09:44.180
so you'll definitely be able to hear it.
But in the end of the podcast,

1165
01:09:44.181 --> 01:09:48.980
I got in this huge fucking argument with his,
uh,
with his male assistant,

1166
01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:54.950
a tech guy,
whatever the fuck you call them,
the guy who sits there.
And uh,

1167
01:09:54.951 --> 01:09:59.570
you know,
it was constantly adjusting knobs on the mixer.
Um,

1168
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.480
we've got an a stupid fucking argument about whether or not someone had the

1169
01:10:05.481 --> 01:10:10.190
right to take my podcast,
put it on a website that had advertising on it.

1170
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:16.010
And I basically said they didn't,
you could,
you know,
I put my podcast out there,

1171
01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:20.240
it is free,
but it's still my intellectual property.
I give it away for free.

1172
01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.380
So you take it for free,
you can't take it and then start making money off it.

1173
01:10:24.381 --> 01:10:29.300
And there was a website that was,
had all these podcasts and they will,

1174
01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:31.460
they,
you know,
they got them all on one website,

1175
01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:35.330
hence a ton of people went to the website.
Why?

1176
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:38.510
Because of the creation of the artists.

1177
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:41.210
Their intellectual property was getting hits.

1178
01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:44.750
No one was going to the website to look at the fucking website with nothing on

1179
01:10:44.751 --> 01:10:48.830
it.
They were going there to listen to the podcast and on their homepage they had

1180
01:10:48.831 --> 01:10:51.380
advertising.
So all these podcasts,

1181
01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:55.010
we're getting eyeballs to go to the fucking website.

1182
01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.930
All right.
And they go there and they read advertising.

1183
01:10:59.931 --> 01:11:02.960
And that's how you sell advertising by the amount of fucking people you get to

1184
01:11:02.961 --> 01:11:06.560
your website.
So how you supposed to do that?

1185
01:11:06.561 --> 01:11:11.360
I supposed to contact the artists or the owner of the work and say,

1186
01:11:11.361 --> 01:11:16.020
listen,
we want to use the ship.
We're going to be selling advertising.
All right,

1187
01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:18.990
we'll take our cut.
You take your cut,
that's fine.

1188
01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:20.220
That's what the fuck he supposed to do.

1189
01:11:20.221 --> 01:11:23.880
You can't just take it and put it on your site and start making money off of it.

1190
01:11:23.881 --> 01:11:28.230
And for some reason he was saying it was my fault because technology existed for

1191
01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:30.570
them to do that.
So hilarious.

1192
01:11:30.571 --> 01:11:35.190
He completely ignored all the laws of intellectual property,
copyright laws,

1193
01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.140
fuck all that.
You know,
it's like,
you know,
if you steal somebody's car,

1194
01:11:40.141 --> 01:11:43.400
that's grand theft auto.
But if you go out and you go buy one of,

1195
01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:45.780
what do they call those?
Those little Jimmy things,
those slim Jims,

1196
01:11:45.781 --> 01:11:48.150
we can unlock the door to your car.
You know,

1197
01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:51.180
if you have one of those that you know,
it's not stealing.

1198
01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:53.460
It's the dumbest,

1199
01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:56.380
the stupidest fucking argument I've ever gotten into in my life.

1200
01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:01.570
I'm arguing what the actual law is and this guy is talking about technology,

1201
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:06.100
but technology exists for me to do something illegal,

1202
01:12:06.130 --> 01:12:10.540
therefore it's not illegal.
Was fucking retarded.

1203
01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:14.440
And the only thing more retarded was the fact that I couldn't fucking tap out of

1204
01:12:14.441 --> 01:12:16.910
the argument.
I can't believe I never brought up.
Well Dude,

1205
01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:21.930
I actually called my lawyer who went to law school and majors in it with a focus

1206
01:12:22.661 --> 01:12:26.320
in entertainment law.
And not only did he tell me I was 100% right,

1207
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:29.410
he actually said I could sue that website if I want it to,

1208
01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:31.780
which I'm not going to,
but that's how right I was.

1209
01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.230
Jesus fucking Christ.

1210
01:12:35.231 --> 01:12:39.190
I mean a laptop exists that's legal to buy in a laptop.

1211
01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:42.130
And what the technology of a laptop and a little bit of smarts,

1212
01:12:42.131 --> 01:12:45.460
I can break into your online bank account and take all your fucking money.

1213
01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:50.290
Does it mean that it's not illegal because laptops are legal?
I don't.

1214
01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:52.030
It was the dumbest fucking argument ever.

1215
01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:57.120
And it lasted for 45 minutes and of course it got a zillion hits.

1216
01:12:57.491 --> 01:13:01.750
Joe was telling me it got the most fucking responses.
All right,

1217
01:13:01.751 --> 01:13:04.720
and you're going to sit there and tell me I don't get the Internet.
I get it.

1218
01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:09.640
I get it.
People like arguments,
they like arguments.

1219
01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:13.120
And they like stealing shit and not get and you know,

1220
01:13:13.121 --> 01:13:17.920
and not fucking paying for stuff and then acting like they don't understand what

1221
01:13:17.921 --> 01:13:18.491
you're talking about.

1222
01:13:18.491 --> 01:13:21.970
It goes right back to that all that stealing music that everybody did.

1223
01:13:21.971 --> 01:13:26.320
Remember that shit and all the artists got mad going just stealing our music and

1224
01:13:26.321 --> 01:13:30.310
every sake we nuts steal it.
Hit man was sharing files.

1225
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:35.940
No,
we were stealing it.
Look what we did.

1226
01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:41.000
We destroyed and I say we because I was online.
Why?

1227
01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:42.980
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1228
01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:47.360
<v 4>I was online wire for a good eight months before someone finally was just like,</v>

1229
01:13:47.361 --> 01:13:49.100
dude,
we're stealing music.
How can we do that?

1230
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:51.590
Then that's someone can steal your fucking comedy.
This is bullshit.

1231
01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:54.170
And I know a lot of you right now sit.
And they'd go,
well yeah,
you go,

1232
01:13:54.171 --> 01:13:57.290
you stalled music gift for someone ought to be able to steal your fucking

1233
01:13:57.291 --> 01:14:01.820
podcast and fucking avid.
Now two wrongs don't make a right.
Okay.

1234
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:04.880
Just cause I go out and murder somebody doesn't mean somebody can come over and

1235
01:14:04.881 --> 01:14:09.620
murder somebody.
I know we're both going to get charged with murder.
All right.

1236
01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.160
I didn't say I was a perfect person to this people.

1237
01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:14.680
I think it shows what a big person I am,

1238
01:14:14.681 --> 01:14:18.700
that I can admit to some of my wrong doings in the past.
But anyways,

1239
01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.780
after fucking 10 years is still a music look,
look at the music business.
Okay.

1240
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:28.600
It's over.
It's fucking over.
Steven Tyler is on,
on,
uh,

1241
01:14:28.601 --> 01:14:33.070
American idol talking to people who work at a fucking Cinnabon telling them that

1242
01:14:33.071 --> 01:14:34.690
they have good voices and that they have,

1243
01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:38.200
they're going to have some sort of career in,
in,
in a,
in a fucking

1244
01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:44.120
art that where the whole business model has been completely fucking destroyed.

1245
01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.080
You guys haven't noticed that shit.

1246
01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:50.950
Musicians are like in movies now.

1247
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:52.810
They're doing everything but segging I saw there's a,

1248
01:14:52.811 --> 01:14:56.110
there's a new show out where Christina Aguilar as a judge,

1249
01:14:56.111 --> 01:14:59.710
the lead singer of Maroon five is a judge.
Some country singers,
a judge,

1250
01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:04.290
all these guys
who cook,
who used to be able to sell out the staple center.

1251
01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:08.880
It's the whole fucking thing.
It's over.
So,
uh,
I dunno,

1252
01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:12.750
did that even make sense?
I didn't know what the fuck my point was.

1253
01:15:12.751 --> 01:15:16.350
I can't sell it to staples center.
All right,
go fuck yourselves.

1254
01:15:16.351 --> 01:15:19.980
But I was right in that argument and uh,
I actually,
I had a great

1255
01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:25.920
time this week because I didn't read one of the emails that was sent to me about

1256
01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:29.040
that stupid argument.
I would just see it,
Joe Rogan's podcast,

1257
01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:34.080
a RSS feed,
any of that shit.
I just deleted all of them.

1258
01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:37.620
It was fucking was fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.

1259
01:15:37.621 --> 01:15:42.210
So I didn't have to read that and argue with strangers who don't understand the

1260
01:15:42.211 --> 01:15:45.090
laws.
So there you go.
I hope as some of that man,
you know,

1261
01:15:45.091 --> 01:15:46.590
I realized halfway through that is none of you,

1262
01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:48.480
most of you probably didn't even hear the fucking argument,

1263
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:52.050
but you'll probably go to Joe Rogan's podcast to listen to it.

1264
01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:56.340
Won't you see that?
Look at me spreading the podcast love.

1265
01:15:57.150 --> 01:16:01.320
Uh,
all right with that,
with that running of the fucking mouth,

1266
01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:06.120
what do I have coming up here?
People this week I'm actually going to be,
um,

1267
01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:11.280
what am I going to be?
I'm in town this week.
I'm actually working on April 2nd.

1268
01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:15.570
I let me get the exact date here in case I screw this up.
The name of the show,

1269
01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:18.660
it was Kevin and beans,
April foolishness show.

1270
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:23.160
They do it at the Gibson amphitheatre.
I did it last year and had yeah,
April 2nd.

1271
01:16:23.190 --> 01:16:28.190
I had an unbelievably great time and I'm absolutely loved doing doing this gig

1272
01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:35.190
because not only do I get to work with a bunch of comedians that I never get to

1273
01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:38.910
see anymore,
it's all a bunch of headliners.
Uh,

1274
01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:43.950
as far as the fuck and I can see of course I don't have any of the fucking
names.

1275
01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:47.370
Who the hell's on a Patton Oswalt's on it.
Jimmy Kimmel's on it.

1276
01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:52.830
I'm on it.
Kevin.
A beads,
I forget.
I can't remember what the lineup is.
Fucking,

1277
01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:54.270
I think Dana Gould might be on it.

1278
01:16:54.271 --> 01:16:56.940
I shouldn't name names here cause I don't know.
It's going to be awesome.

1279
01:16:56.941 --> 01:17:01.050
All these guys that I love watching him work are going to be on it at a and on

1280
01:17:01.051 --> 01:17:02.520
top of that to Gipsy Gibson,

1281
01:17:02.521 --> 01:17:05.700
MP theater is used to be called the universal amphitheater.

1282
01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:09.260
And that's the one where the blues brothers,
they,

1283
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:12.440
when they recorded a briefcase full of blues with my favorite,

1284
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:16.200
one of my favorite drummers of all time,
Steve Jordan.
Uh,

1285
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:18.230
that's what they did it right there on that stage.

1286
01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:21.860
And they were opening for Steve Martin back when he wore the white suit with the

1287
01:17:21.861 --> 01:17:25.130
fucking air through his head.
I'm a geek for that type of shit.

1288
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:26.990
Theater history.

1289
01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:32.260
I always try to find out and I sit there really Charlie Chaplin play played

1290
01:17:32.361 --> 01:17:37.310
here,
Buster Keaton like that dumb shit,
you know.
Um,
so anyways,

1291
01:17:37.311 --> 01:17:41.990
I'll be doing that on April 2nd and then,
uh,
what else do I got?

1292
01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:46.580
Oh,
I'm going to be in Maryland at the record theater for two shows on April 8th.

1293
01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:51.560
And then I'm going to be at the tower with the ANA in Philadelphia,

1294
01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:54.290
Pennsylvania on April 9th.

1295
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:57.650
And then later on that month I'm hitting two cities.

1296
01:17:57.651 --> 01:18:01.940
I haven't done stand up ever or in a longtime Milwaukee.
Never been there.

1297
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:07.100
Going to be at the,
uh,
the,
the PAPP's theater in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.
April 22nd.

1298
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:11.420
On April 23rd,
I'll be at the Royal Oak Music Theater in Detroit,
Michigan.

1299
01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:13.520
I have not been there since I did,
uh,

1300
01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:18.020
the Chappelle show tour with Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings.

1301
01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.350
And I think we did that.
We did that.
Went back in 2004.

1302
01:18:21.351 --> 01:18:24.950
So it's been seven years since I've been there.
So,
um,

1303
01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:27.680
so please come out to that.
And with that,

1304
01:18:27.681 --> 01:18:31.850
let's get on with the podcast questions for the week.
Where is it?
Oh,

1305
01:18:31.851 --> 01:18:36.080
did I not again,
open the fucking thing?
Jesus Christ.
Bill,

1306
01:18:36.081 --> 01:18:40.810
you call yourself a radio host or a podcast host.
Is that,

1307
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:45.230
is that what you call me?
Uh,
is that what you call yourself,
Bill?
All right.

1308
01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:49.730
Open.
Fuck.
What can I talk about here?

1309
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:50.630
What can I talk about?

1310
01:18:50.631 --> 01:18:54.650
Can I talk about how the Bruins raped the Montreal Canadiens seven to nothing?

1311
01:18:54.651 --> 01:18:59.160
Did you guys see that fucking game?
Absolutely raped them.
And,
uh,

1312
01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:02.420
I got to tell you they deserved every fucking second of that cause this still

1313
01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:06.530
bitching about that said Dana,
Ciara hit,
Ya know,

1314
01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.460
he finished his fucking check.
The problem was,

1315
01:19:10.461 --> 01:19:14.450
is that they still have that fucking bored,
that,
that piece of glass right there.

1316
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:18.620
That's the problem.
The problem is the NHL have seen for years,

1317
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:22.940
guys almost get their fucking heads taken off on that part of the ice.

1318
01:19:22.941 --> 01:19:25.910
What you should do is just somehow make that thing collapsible.

1319
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:28.190
Move it away from the ice.
I don't know what the fuck to do,

1320
01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:32.450
but there's got to be okay if I can have a car that has a collapsible front end

1321
01:19:32.451 --> 01:19:35.990
of the engine is designed to go underneath me rather than into the,

1322
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.910
into my fucking torso.
There's no way the Nhl can't have that.

1323
01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:43.160
I'll put the clip on there by the way,

1324
01:19:43.161 --> 01:19:48.110
on the [inaudible] podcast.com so you guys can see,
um,
see that hit,

1325
01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:53.400
I mean it was brutal because the guy fractured one of his vertebraes and uh,

1326
01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.560
so I felt bad about that.

1327
01:19:54.561 --> 01:19:57.950
But then they were talking about the severity of the guys concussion and it

1328
01:19:57.951 --> 01:20:01.520
turns out the fucking Douche went to the movies like three days later with this

1329
01:20:01.521 --> 01:20:05.930
allegedly severe concussion.
Gotta love Mark Recky for calling him out.

1330
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:09.780
He was actually taking heat shower,
just saying.
Yeah.
You know,
I don't,

1331
01:20:09.781 --> 01:20:11.260
I think he exaggerated it.

1332
01:20:14.970 --> 01:20:19.590
Oh awesome.
Is that he did that,
you know,
already no one helped fucking sensitive.

1333
01:20:19.591 --> 01:20:23.460
They are up there.
This so fucking sensitive up there in Montreal.

1334
01:20:23.461 --> 01:20:27.630
It's not like Toronto.
Toronto's a fun God Damn City Montreal,

1335
01:20:27.631 --> 01:20:30.390
some of the most beautiful women you ever going to see in your life.

1336
01:20:30.391 --> 01:20:33.240
But the men are just so fucking sensitive.

1337
01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:39.860
They actually have the police looking into that hit somebody to think about

1338
01:20:39.931 --> 01:20:43.380
somebody got checked into the fucking boards.
Okay.

1339
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:46.800
And unfortunately right with a glass starts,
you know,

1340
01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:48.870
or the glass in between the benches,
you know,

1341
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:54.950
and that they want to like put one of the Bruins in jail for playing hockey.

1342
01:20:56.850 --> 01:20:57.683
You know,

1343
01:20:57.870 --> 01:21:00.960
I'll tell you what's funny is 10 years ago they weren't even been a penalty on

1344
01:21:00.961 --> 01:21:05.720
that play.
Um,
anyways,
so this is the deal.
Um,

1345
01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.920
the new email,
if you want to send me an email,

1346
01:21:07.921 --> 01:21:10.950
if you want to send me more fucking emails about,
uh,

1347
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:13.740
agreeing or disagreeing with my argument on Joe Rogan,

1348
01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:16.380
he sent it to bill@thefmpodcast.com.

1349
01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:20.520
Please send me your underrated overrated lists.
Your advice,

1350
01:21:20.521 --> 01:21:23.520
if you have any questions,
your stories of revenge.
You know,

1351
01:21:23.521 --> 01:21:26.700
all the shit that we've been doing throughout the years here and ask,

1352
01:21:26.701 --> 01:21:30.840
speaking of overrated,
underrated,
uh,
I got one.

1353
01:21:30.841 --> 01:21:33.630
He for you as far as something being overrated.
You know,

1354
01:21:33.631 --> 01:21:38.010
what's overrated is outlets.
You know,
you don't,

1355
01:21:38.011 --> 01:21:41.460
when the broads get all excited,
we're going to the outlets they got in.

1356
01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:44.730
They got a fucking,
what a hell do they shop at?

1357
01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:49.760
They got to Jordan Mash at JC penny in a fire leads outlet to any of those

1358
01:21:51.271 --> 01:21:55.950
stores still exist or did Macy's just fucking buy up all of them,

1359
01:21:56.060 --> 01:22:00.570
you know,
whatever,
whatever the fuck they buy,
you know,

1360
01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:05.160
they got all those stories.
Oh my God,
it's going to be blah,
blah,
blah.

1361
01:22:05.161 --> 01:22:07.020
So you go in there as a guy going,
all right,

1362
01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:08.970
well maybe this won't cost me as much fucking money.

1363
01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:12.840
What do you want a pair of shoes,
sweetie?
Hey,
let's go to the outlet.

1364
01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.350
Sounds like a fucking,
you know,

1365
01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:20.160
sounds like a dream because when you really think about it,

1366
01:22:20.161 --> 01:22:24.390
it doesn't make any fucking sense.
Why is it so God damn cheap?

1367
01:22:25.650 --> 01:22:28.160
Why did they suddenly decide that they just didn't want them?

1368
01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:33.200
Is Make as much money on that shirt that that seven year olds sewed together in

1369
01:22:33.241 --> 01:22:37.380
the Philippines as they would in a mall.
What is it about the outlet,

1370
01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:41.100
you know,
if you use common sense,
you actually think,

1371
01:22:41.101 --> 01:22:44.970
well they're probably not marking them down as much as they think that as they

1372
01:22:44.971 --> 01:22:49.320
say they are and it's probably a bunch of shit that nobody wanted a bunch of

1373
01:22:49.321 --> 01:22:53.460
shit that didn't sell well at the malls and now they got to get fucking rid of

1374
01:22:53.461 --> 01:22:57.030
it.
Isn't that what it is?
That's been my experience.
You go to the,

1375
01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.130
they're overrated.
You go to an outlet.

1376
01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.310
And another thing that they liked doing is they like to say that the,

1377
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:06.490
the actual retail price is about 30% more than it usually is.

1378
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:11.020
And then they give you a 2% discount and you feel like you're getting like 32%

1379
01:23:11.021 --> 01:23:15.550
off.
You know,
cause people suck at math.
They'll do Adidas shell toes,

1380
01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:19.420
usually $126 now,

1381
01:23:19.421 --> 01:23:23.980
only 68
you know,
what a fuck are they,

1382
01:23:23.981 --> 01:23:28.330
you know,
168 or whatever to whatever the fucking number.

1383
01:23:28.331 --> 01:23:32.980
I just said the shell toes,
there's no arch support whatsoever.

1384
01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:37.630
It's the same fucking design that you've had for the last 40 fucking years.

1385
01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:39.970
So there's no,
there's no extra cost.

1386
01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:43.390
You don't have to hire somebody to design a new fucking sneaker,
right.

1387
01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:47.080
It's like a God damn Porsche to saint fucking design forever.

1388
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:51.380
So whatever.
So we go there and she goes in,

1389
01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.130
she goes into Prada and I walk in and it,

1390
01:23:55.170 --> 01:23:57.670
it's still a fucking ridiculously expensive shoe.

1391
01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:02.820
I got so fucking mad at my girl at that thing I was telling us saying,

1392
01:24:02.951 --> 01:24:07.150
listen,
listen,
we're going out to the desert.
My buddy had a kid.

1393
01:24:07.151 --> 01:24:09.720
It's his first kid.
I want to go out there.
We that that's,

1394
01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.790
that's what it's supposed to be about.
But you know,
fucking women,

1395
01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:17.320
they can't just go out and go do,
stay.
Always got to get something.
Yeah.

1396
01:24:17.321 --> 01:24:21.220
If you notice that all you young studs out there banging away,
having one,

1397
01:24:21.221 --> 01:24:23.020
even if you have a one night stand with them,

1398
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.580
they still try to get a tee shirt out of it.
He noticed that.

1399
01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:30.040
Can you feel how you teach it?
Then they just walk out with it.
The fucking weird.

1400
01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:33.190
They like,
they like serial killers.
Like they'd taken some sort of a trophy,

1401
01:24:34.210 --> 01:24:36.850
making a God damn food.
Who Doll give me,
you know,
it was one of the,

1402
01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:40.930
that was one of the,
uh,
one of the turning points is me as a single guy.

1403
01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.670
When I asked for the tee shirt back,

1404
01:24:43.090 --> 01:24:46.070
I started doing it and I a t shirt BEC and I,

1405
01:24:46.071 --> 01:24:48.310
I loved it because they didn't know what to cause.

1406
01:24:48.311 --> 01:24:52.150
They were pissed that they asked for it.
Then I asked for it,

1407
01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:56.230
but then they also didn't want to come off as some selfish cunt,

1408
01:24:56.231 --> 01:24:58.400
so then they had to take it off.
But there's just still

1409
01:24:59.910 --> 01:25:01.810
the conflicting emotions on their face.

1410
01:25:01.811 --> 01:25:04.960
Mad that you asked and then trying to play it off like they're not mad.

1411
01:25:04.961 --> 01:25:08.620
So you can see that they're actually a good girl who will jump on your Dick

1412
01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:13.090
after knowing you for about four and a half hours.
Right.
So anyways,

1413
01:25:13.091 --> 01:25:17.410
overrated outlets.
All right,
if fucking overrated.

1414
01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:21.040
Unless there's a bunch of stores that you like,
then it's just convenient.

1415
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.070
That's the best you're going to get.
You know,

1416
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.390
it's convenient while at least I don't have to walk through a food court and two

1417
01:25:28.391 --> 01:25:32.650
levels.
I like that.
It's just one level.
I do like that aspect of it.

1418
01:25:32.651 --> 01:25:36.460
But in general,
I don't see the fucking deals.
It's like,

1419
01:25:36.461 --> 01:25:37.890
how do you know how to,

1420
01:25:37.891 --> 01:25:42.730
like Vegas used to be mob run and now it's corporate corporate owned and

1421
01:25:42.731 --> 01:25:46.930
gradually the,
the $8 steak disappeared that you could get good,

1422
01:25:46.931 --> 01:25:49.630
you can get a steak for like six bucks,
you can anymore.

1423
01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:52.570
They turned them all into buff the buffets,

1424
01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:56.050
it's like the $20 buffet and then he got to go there and feel like,
you know,

1425
01:25:56.410 --> 01:25:57.730
you ate your money's worth.

1426
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.720
So you go there and eat 10 times more than you normally would have and then you

1427
01:26:01.721 --> 01:26:05.240
fuck you,
you killing yourself,
you have each so much,
you start sweating.

1428
01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:09.800
You just have such a bizarre combination eating like rice and then a slice of

1429
01:26:09.801 --> 01:26:13.670
cake,
so fucking pancakes and then it's a piece of fish.
You know,

1430
01:26:13.671 --> 01:26:15.710
your body's just like,
dude,
what the fuck?

1431
01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:19.220
And you finish it off with like a pickle and then he's just sitting there,
right.

1432
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:22.610
Look at it like that guy on man versus food.
You know,

1433
01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:26.090
when it gets down to the final two bites and he goes into what I call the

1434
01:26:26.091 --> 01:26:30.530
thinker pose,
you know where he sketched got his fist up against his skull.

1435
01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:38.510
Yeah.
It's the same thick outlets.
That's just,
it's,

1436
01:26:38.511 --> 01:26:41.590
it's the same hype that people used to say about Vegas.

1437
01:26:41.591 --> 01:26:46.510
People finally have stopped saying the,
the $6 steak bullshit.
Um,

1438
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:49.480
all right,
so there you go.
That's overrated.
Underrated for the week.

1439
01:26:49.481 --> 01:26:52.630
Please keep sending those in people.
I love,
I love reading those things.
Um,

1440
01:26:52.810 --> 01:26:55.930
all right,
advice for this week.
These are,

1441
01:26:55.931 --> 01:26:58.840
I'm becoming just sort of the relationship advice person.

1442
01:26:58.841 --> 01:27:02.620
I don't know how this has happened considering I've,
uh,

1443
01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:07.870
I've never been married.
I don't have any kids,
you know,
so I don't know.
You know,

1444
01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:12.680
I'm basically the Steve de Burgh of relationships.
You know,

1445
01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:16.270
I'm somehow still in the league,
still in the game,
pulled in the clipboard,

1446
01:27:16.271 --> 01:27:20.130
but I haven't taken a fucking snap and like nine years.
Uh,

1447
01:27:20.290 --> 01:27:23.140
that's what I am standing on the sidelines as all you guys are getting married

1448
01:27:23.141 --> 01:27:27.010
and having kids just sitting here fucking wearing a headset.
All right,

1449
01:27:27.011 --> 01:27:31.660
but you guys want advice?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Um,

1450
01:27:32.350 --> 01:27:34.900
okay.
So I've been together with my girl for almost four years.

1451
01:27:34.901 --> 01:27:38.760
Got Married last September in 2010.
Uh,

1452
01:27:38.770 --> 01:27:41.560
these past weeks have been hell.
I'm a very honest person,

1453
01:27:41.561 --> 01:27:45.700
so I felt lately that me and my wife have not been close.

1454
01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:48.490
So I talked to my wife and told her how I felt and it,

1455
01:27:48.610 --> 01:27:52.330
and if we continue like this,
things can end up in divorce,

1456
01:27:52.331 --> 01:27:56.800
not things will he stressed,
can all capital,
can end up in divorce.

1457
01:27:57.150 --> 01:28:01.690
So we talked it over and all seemed okay.
A Sunday,
the 20th,

1458
01:28:01.691 --> 01:28:05.440
I asked her when she was coming home,
uh,
this was a 10,
20:00 PM.

1459
01:28:05.650 --> 01:28:10.360
She told me in the next 20 minutes,
I said,
okay,
cool.
I'll see you at home.
Uh,

1460
01:28:10.361 --> 01:28:13.630
I was driving home from a farther city,
so it took me longer to get home.

1461
01:28:13.810 --> 01:28:18.250
I get home at 12:00 AM and she is still not home.
So I call her and say,

1462
01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:21.130
please tell me if you're not going to come home on time.
So I,

1463
01:28:21.190 --> 01:28:25.570
so I know you're okay.
All right.
Sounds like a decent guy.
What does she do?

1464
01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.350
She starts yelling at him,
say,

1465
01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:30.310
<v 6>uh,
uh,</v>

1466
01:28:31.650 --> 01:28:32.483
<v 4>I lost my place.</v>

1467
01:28:32.710 --> 01:28:37.180
She starts yelling at me saying I was helping my damn friend stop being an

1468
01:28:37.181 --> 01:28:42.160
asshole.
Then she hung up.
Wow.
Uh,

1469
01:28:42.161 --> 01:28:44.950
she got home and yelled at me and everything and we argued.

1470
01:28:44.951 --> 01:28:48.070
She went to bed mad at me and I slept on the couch.

1471
01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:52.110
First Time I've ever done that in our relationship as par for the course.

1472
01:28:52.111 --> 01:28:53.170
You got married in September,

1473
01:28:53.171 --> 01:28:56.080
you go through the honeymoon phase right through the holidays and all of a

1474
01:28:56.081 --> 01:28:58.570
sudden Valentine's Day comes up.

1475
01:28:58.571 --> 01:29:03.090
That's more excitement now you were in the march is the real deal.

1476
01:29:04.230 --> 01:29:06.630
Okay.
If you can get along in March that that's that,
that's,

1477
01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.980
that's a good benchmark.
You know,
there's nothing going on in March.

1478
01:29:10.981 --> 01:29:14.550
There's no Valentine's Day.
There's no holidays.
Unless she has a birthday,

1479
01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:16.510
then it doesn't count.
They bill.

1480
01:29:16.511 --> 01:29:18.880
Why don't you shut the fuck up and read the rest of the email?
All right.

1481
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:22.230
All right.
I will.
All right.
Next morning she leaves to work and I tell her,

1482
01:29:22.231 --> 01:29:26.190
I hope you hope you know me.
Sleeping on the couch is not a good thing.

1483
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.120
And she goes,
well,
me not kissing you before I leave isn't a good thing either.

1484
01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:34.020
Jesus,
later on Monday,
she says,

1485
01:29:34.021 --> 01:29:37.980
I am not sleeping at home tonight.
I don't know if I want to be with you anymore.

1486
01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:43.020
Jesus Christ,
dude,
this is like fucking going vertical here.

1487
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:46.660
She's in the space shuttle.
Um,

1488
01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:49.530
it's Friday now and all week she hasn't come home to me.

1489
01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:54.810
She won't even tell me where she is sleeping.
Barely answers my texts or calls.

1490
01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:58.080
She told me she isn't happy.
I don't treat her good.

1491
01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.210
She doesn't love me the way she used to,

1492
01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:04.920
but not once did she sit me down like a civil person and tell me to change.

1493
01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:09.420
She just up she up and just left.
Bill,

1494
01:30:09.421 --> 01:30:12.210
please tell me if you love someone and you're married,

1495
01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:16.800
would it be easy to just up and leave like that?
Uh,

1496
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:21.270
leave that person with no warning and not giving the person a chance and less

1497
01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:24.690
she has another secret.
Oh Gee,

1498
01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:30.420
I think he suggesting that she might have another guy.
Uh,

1499
01:30:30.421 --> 01:30:33.690
she's filing for divorce soon,
Toby,
to keep everything.

1500
01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:38.130
She just wants her vehicle.
I'm dying inside and had been going crazy.

1501
01:30:38.370 --> 01:30:40.500
I cannot believe she would put me through this.

1502
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.780
She said she's been thinking of this for two months but never sat me down so I

1503
01:30:45.781 --> 01:30:49.440
can work on being a better man while do two months is a long time.

1504
01:30:49.441 --> 01:30:51.240
When you only been married since September,

1505
01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:55.950
that's basically 20% of your marriage?
I would think so anyways.

1506
01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:58.260
He goes on to say she had nothing when we met.

1507
01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:02.430
I drove her to school every day and her parents did not care for her.

1508
01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:06.150
I did everything for her.
Why would she screw me like this?

1509
01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:11.460
The boy.
All right.
Um,

1510
01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:15.270
so what advice do you want here?
You want me to know why she would do this?

1511
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:20.070
All right,
let's,
let's,
all right.
I'd have everything she said there.

1512
01:31:20.071 --> 01:31:23.550
I know all my listeners right now are pretty much convinced that she's out

1513
01:31:23.551 --> 01:31:27.600
fucking around on you and uh,
you know,
whose kid and hope they definitely,

1514
01:31:27.601 --> 01:31:29.520
I don't think would be wrong to think that,

1515
01:31:30.090 --> 01:31:35.090
but I think the fly in the ointment here is your description of her relationship

1516
01:31:35.371 --> 01:31:39.480
with her parents when you said that you drove her to school and did everything

1517
01:31:39.481 --> 01:31:43.620
for her yet her parents did not care for her.
Uh,

1518
01:31:43.621 --> 01:31:47.040
this is something that I noticed in my horrific dating past.

1519
01:31:47.970 --> 01:31:50.760
Uh,
if you want to get somebody stable,

1520
01:31:50.761 --> 01:31:55.110
you have to come up with some sort of list of qualifications that they have to

1521
01:31:55.111 --> 01:31:59.010
pass or at least they have to pass most of them.
And one of the things,

1522
01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:01.000
if you want to get a well adjusted female,

1523
01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.273
<v 6>mmm.</v>

1524
01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:07.820
<v 4>I'm not saying that they can't come from divorced,</v>

1525
01:32:07.821 --> 01:32:12.390
but they have to have a good relationship with their parents.
Okay.

1526
01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:16.680
I found that to be a major red flag if I was on a date and I found out that the

1527
01:32:16.681 --> 01:32:20.310
person I was on a date with was not speaking to either their mother or their

1528
01:32:20.311 --> 01:32:22.050
father or would say,

1529
01:32:22.051 --> 01:32:27.000
my dad's a piece of shit or I fucking hate my mother or a,

1530
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:28.560
we don't talk right there.

1531
01:32:28.561 --> 01:32:32.790
I'm telling you just run and the other direction because I don't know,

1532
01:32:32.791 --> 01:32:37.380
it just seeps into your fucking relationship and they do shit like this.
Cause I,

1533
01:32:37.381 --> 01:32:39.200
I'm thinking if you were doing every,

1534
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:41.430
if she came from a household where her parents,

1535
01:32:42.510 --> 01:32:46.740
people who are supposed to love her unconditionally and they weren't doing shit

1536
01:32:46.741 --> 01:32:51.480
for her,
and then you come in there and you start doing everything for her,

1537
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:57.390
just just out of never having that in our life on some level,

1538
01:32:57.421 --> 01:33:00.540
she's going to fall in love with you.
Even if she doesn't love you.

1539
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:04.800
She loves you because you're giving her what her parents never gave,
gave her,

1540
01:33:05.370 --> 01:33:10.110
gave her,
you know what I mean?
But that doesn't mean that she loves you.

1541
01:33:10.111 --> 01:33:10.944
And I think that that's,

1542
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:13.710
and then you combine the fact that she had a fucked up relationship with your

1543
01:33:13.711 --> 01:33:16.260
parents where there was no love and that type of stuff.

1544
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:21.120
She doesn't know what love is and can't communicate.

1545
01:33:21.570 --> 01:33:23.190
And when she's not feeling it,

1546
01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:25.500
she doesn't know how to get out of it like a fucking adult.

1547
01:33:25.530 --> 01:33:29.910
Hence she just leaves you.
And then because she's been searching for life,

1548
01:33:30.150 --> 01:33:34.710
love her entire fucking life,
rather than just going out on her fucking own

1549
01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:38.700
and just being alone and figuring out what she wants,

1550
01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:42.390
it kind of seems like she already has another guy and she's just swinging to

1551
01:33:42.391 --> 01:33:46.920
that dude,
uh,
gold right into another relationship.
So I'll tell you this,

1552
01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:47.760
this is what I would do.

1553
01:33:47.761 --> 01:33:52.260
I would consider myself fucking lucky that she did it this quick,

1554
01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:55.860
that you found out that you were married to a psycho and that she only wants her

1555
01:33:55.861 --> 01:33:58.200
fucking car.
All right?

1556
01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.970
So what I would do is give her her space.
Don't call her,

1557
01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:07.860
be civil,
work the fucking thing out,
sign the divorce papers,

1558
01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:12.360
let her get her fucking VW thing,
whatever the fuck she drives.

1559
01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:17.250
And let her and her baggage drive down to the Goddamn street.
All right?

1560
01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:21.870
Then you fucking,
I dunno.
Do Usual Shit.
Go to the gym.

1561
01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.340
Cry It out.
Go to the fucking gym.
All right.

1562
01:34:26.970 --> 01:34:30.900
Don't beat yourself up.
Don't start drinking.
Don't start becoming a fat.
Fuck.

1563
01:34:30.930 --> 01:34:34.470
All right.
Turn this shit around.
I'm telling you,

1564
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:39.380
I don't come up with some healthy fucking way to deal with this shit.
Uh,

1565
01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:42.180
and don't do the Guy Shit where you're fucking white.

1566
01:34:42.181 --> 01:34:45.150
Knuckle your way through it and booze and go bang a fat chick.

1567
01:34:45.151 --> 01:34:48.870
Don't do that shit.
All right.
Fucking,
you know,

1568
01:34:48.871 --> 01:34:51.780
curl up in the fetal position and cry it out and just tell you,

1569
01:34:51.781 --> 01:34:54.210
keep telling yourself you're going to meet the right girl.
Do that.

1570
01:34:54.211 --> 01:34:57.770
But that one right there,
dude,
flush that one down the fucking toilet and kids,

1571
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:59.910
it's a blessing.
It's a blessing.
Do.

1572
01:34:59.911 --> 01:35:04.100
Can you imagine if you had a kid with that fucking nightmare and for the rest of

1573
01:35:04.101 --> 01:35:07.690
your fucking life or at least for the next 18 goddamn years,

1574
01:35:07.730 --> 01:35:11.270
she's going to be in your fucking life and he got to listen to her opinions,

1575
01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:15.530
which would totally affect on some level your relationship with the next great

1576
01:35:15.531 --> 01:35:16.430
girl that you're going to meet.

1577
01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:18.830
The next girl is going to be a great girl cause you've been through the shit

1578
01:35:18.831 --> 01:35:22.610
with this cunt.
Trust me.
All right.
It's going to hurt.

1579
01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:28.100
Just fucking deal with it.
All right,
platoon,
take the pain.
All right.
Okay.

1580
01:35:28.101 --> 01:35:30.840
That's it.
Next one.
All right,
bill,
being in this girl now though,

1581
01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:32.680
now the relationship won't be bill me.

1582
01:35:32.710 --> 01:35:37.310
This girl is stationed overseas in the military.
Uh,
England.

1583
01:35:37.311 --> 01:35:38.780
Lucky enough due to our jobs,

1584
01:35:38.781 --> 01:35:43.700
we see each other a couple times a week for meetings and at the gym here on my

1585
01:35:43.701 --> 01:35:44.900
47 dilemmas.

1586
01:35:45.130 --> 01:35:49.100
This is a chance of being deployed and all of that business due to the war with

1587
01:35:49.101 --> 01:35:53.570
yogurt face in Libya.
The least of my worries.

1588
01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:57.650
Oh by the way,
did you see that fucking,
there was a couple of,
uh,

1589
01:35:59.770 --> 01:36:01.300
what does it,
Osher,

1590
01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:05.630
Beyonce and Mariah Carey actually did private new year's gigs for a,

1591
01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.270
for 1 million bucks.
Did New Year's gigs for Qaddafi's kids.

1592
01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:14.170
Can you fucking believe that?
How much fucking money do you mean need to make?

1593
01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.033
You know

1594
01:36:16.330 --> 01:36:21.070
you're going to take a gig where you going to go dance like a God damn fucking

1595
01:36:21.490 --> 01:36:24.940
clown for a mass murderers,
kids.

1596
01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.670
Then you take that fucking blood money.

1597
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.980
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1598
01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:31.600
<v 4>Stick it in your bank account.</v>

1599
01:36:32.230 --> 01:36:35.560
Go Buy yourself some fucking glitter or whatever the hell you do when you're a

1600
01:36:35.561 --> 01:36:40.180
god damn singer by some more streamers to hang on your fucking mic stand.

1601
01:36:40.181 --> 01:36:41.320
And then when you get busted,

1602
01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:45.310
you try to play it off like you had no idea who Kadafi is

1603
01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:48.480
and what he's done.
Yeah.

1604
01:36:48.481 --> 01:36:52.590
You couldn't remember that he claimed he was behind the Pan Am bombing that

1605
01:36:52.591 --> 01:36:55.020
killed fellow Americans.
The fuck is wrong with you.

1606
01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:56.660
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1607
01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:00.350
<v 4>I love that shit.
Where they tried to play it off like they had no idea.
Okay.</v>

1608
01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:04.580
At the low level of entertainment that I'm at.
Anytime I do a private Gig,

1609
01:37:04.970 --> 01:37:06.710
they always tell you what the deal is.

1610
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:11.780
I don't do private gigs anymore cause as Dane Cook,
classically put,

1611
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:13.520
you feel like you're being rented.

1612
01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:18.400
That's the greatest way to describe how you feel when you do that kick.

1613
01:37:18.401 --> 01:37:21.470
See if you do want to see if you come out to a comedy club or a theater to see

1614
01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:25.070
my act,
you get my act and I get to say whatever I want,

1615
01:37:25.071 --> 01:37:30.071
but if you hire me to perform for your your company or a private fucking

1616
01:37:30.951 --> 01:37:35.320
Christmas party or some shit like that,
like I used to do those gigs,
uh,

1617
01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:37.610
there's always a list.
This is what they do.

1618
01:37:37.611 --> 01:37:42.611
Stay away from this and you either comply to the list or you just don't take the

1619
01:37:43.941 --> 01:37:47.960
Gig.
The last thing you do is say,
yeah,
yeah,
no,
no,
no problem.
Then you show up,

1620
01:37:47.970 --> 01:37:52.580
you do your Lenny Bruce fucking set and then walk away thinking you're a bad
ass.

1621
01:37:52.581 --> 01:37:56.130
You're not a bad ass.
You just an asshole if you're to go in there and curse.

1622
01:37:56.131 --> 01:37:58.380
And they wanted a clean comic.
You shouldn't taken the Gig.

1623
01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.610
They're hiring you private gig.
Right.
So buddy,
any either.
Anyways,

1624
01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:07.890
anytime I do a Gig,
if there's somebody in a fucking wheelchair,

1625
01:38:08.010 --> 01:38:11.820
if there's somebody mentally handicapped,
just that shit alone,

1626
01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:13.770
they'll poke their head in the back.
Hey,
just to let you know,

1627
01:38:13.771 --> 01:38:16.920
I don't know what jokes you do,
but this is the situation out there.

1628
01:38:16.921 --> 01:38:20.700
Just giving you the heads up so there's no problem.
There's no fucking way.

1629
01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:23.340
They're agents didn't say,
hey listen,

1630
01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:27.540
just to let you know you're performing for the children of a mass murderer.

1631
01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:31.680
This is how they feel about females over there.
Stay away from this.

1632
01:38:32.370 --> 01:38:36.690
You're able to gyrate this much during songs.
There was a whole fucking,

1633
01:38:36.691 --> 01:38:38.190
it's $1 million gig.

1634
01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:42.990
There's no way the agent lets the artists go in there not knowing who the fuck

1635
01:38:42.991 --> 01:38:47.991
they're performing for with performing to risking losing their commission on $1

1636
01:38:50.490 --> 01:38:52.380
million fucking Gig.
They're completely full of shit.

1637
01:38:52.381 --> 01:38:56.040
They're just giving the money back cause they got fucking caught.
I,
that's,

1638
01:38:56.340 --> 01:39:00.330
I think it's horrific.
Absolutely horrific.
So anyways,
back to the email.

1639
01:39:01.290 --> 01:39:06.240
Um,
so we've both been here being this broad for about six months.
Six months.

1640
01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.160
Okay.
Let me recap here.
Up until this point,

1641
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:12.840
he sees his girl a couple of times a week.
All right?
Okay.
So the two dilemmas,

1642
01:39:12.841 --> 01:39:17.370
he works with the girl and also if he starts developing feelings at any point he

1643
01:39:17.371 --> 01:39:21.690
could get deployed to Olivia and she couldn't,
she might not or they might both.

1644
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:25.860
And uh,
there'll be in separate parts of the country,
not fucking seen each other.

1645
01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.220
You know what I mean?
I don't fucking know.
I don't even have to say,

1646
01:39:29.221 --> 01:39:31.950
how the fuck can we start a third war?
We couldn't even afford one.

1647
01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:36.720
I really don't understand it.
All right,
let's continue here.
Uh,

1648
01:39:36.721 --> 01:39:38.850
we've both been here about six months and in that time,

1649
01:39:38.851 --> 01:39:41.640
everyone on the basis tried to get into this chick's pants.

1650
01:39:42.030 --> 01:39:46.260
She's a bomb shell for certain.
No one seems to get clothes.
How,
uh,

1651
01:39:46.290 --> 01:39:50.370
however I come to find out,
she's basically got dumped,
uh,

1652
01:39:50.371 --> 01:39:54.420
when she left her last base state side and has been cooped up in her house off

1653
01:39:54.421 --> 01:39:56.640
base trying to keep in touch with this dude.

1654
01:39:56.641 --> 01:39:59.190
She's rarely gone out and hasn't given date dating or whatever.

1655
01:39:59.191 --> 01:40:01.560
Much of a thought as far as I can wager.
Meanwhile,

1656
01:40:01.650 --> 01:40:05.160
I've been busy being miserable on my own as well as this,

1657
01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:09.930
as I had this stint with some cock Copchick over the winter and that basically

1658
01:40:09.931 --> 01:40:12.060
died about two to three weeks ago.

1659
01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:17.180
I started talking to this broad and spending time together regularly after work.

1660
01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:19.920
Nothing too seriously,
but apparently I can make her laugh.

1661
01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:23.640
I'm getting the notion that she's moving on from her old relationship.

1662
01:40:23.641 --> 01:40:25.860
Things seem to be going swimmingly.

1663
01:40:26.490 --> 01:40:29.790
I'm just not certain I can take the multiple risks and try to make a situation

1664
01:40:29.791 --> 01:40:30.480
out of this that will,

1665
01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.170
that wouldn't somehow end up in some sort of complete disaster.

1666
01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:37.950
I'm technically shitting where I eat and it's not like I could just quit this

1667
01:40:37.951 --> 01:40:39.930
job tomorrow.
I'm in the fucking military.

1668
01:40:40.170 --> 01:40:42.690
I'm trying to avoid certain disaster yet.
However,

1669
01:40:42.691 --> 01:40:45.240
I'm primed to be in the zone for a good,

1670
01:40:45.241 --> 01:40:49.050
real good looking piece and perhaps a healthy relationship thereafter.

1671
01:40:49.230 --> 01:40:53.830
I'm not sure how far,
how far to take this thing.
I'm conflicted.
I could a laugh.

1672
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.640
Thanks for the podcast.
All right.
All right,
dude,

1673
01:40:57.641 --> 01:40:59.860
these are very fucking mature concerns.

1674
01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:01.853
<v 6>MMM.</v>

1675
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:07.370
<v 4>This is all up to you.
You got to figure out how you feel about this girl.</v>

1676
01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:10.670
All right.
And then act accordingly.
All right.

1677
01:41:10.671 --> 01:41:14.330
If you want to fucking just bang this girl,
if you figure that out,

1678
01:41:14.331 --> 01:41:15.860
if you just want to bang this girl,

1679
01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:20.050
just be upfront and tell her that it's just a sex thing and she,

1680
01:41:20.051 --> 01:41:21.740
the goes for it or she does it.

1681
01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:22.980
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1682
01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:23.381
<v 4>All right.</v>

1683
01:41:23.381 --> 01:41:27.190
And if she goes for it and you bang her and then you don't call her afterwards

1684
01:41:27.191 --> 01:41:31.090
or you,
you know,
you're just still not having feelings for,

1685
01:41:31.330 --> 01:41:36.160
she can't get mad legitimately because you talked to her about it up front.

1686
01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:38.050
Of course there's always that,
you know,

1687
01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:42.760
18% psycho rule where she could be thinking,
well,
after he fucks me,

1688
01:41:42.761 --> 01:41:46.060
he's going to realize what a great person I am and then we'll have in a

1689
01:41:46.061 --> 01:41:47.350
relationship,
you know,

1690
01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:52.700
I would be a little bit nervous about this girl because she's still hanging onto

1691
01:41:52.710 --> 01:41:53.521
this other person.

1692
01:41:53.521 --> 01:41:57.300
So I don't know if she's just wounded or if she has an actual psycho.

1693
01:41:57.450 --> 01:42:01.140
So I will tell you this,
if you just have a fuck buddy relationship with her,

1694
01:42:01.570 --> 01:42:03.750
this is the key.
All right?

1695
01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:07.650
You have to space out the times when you bang her.

1696
01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:11.550
All right?
And when you bang her,
she can never spend the night.

1697
01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:13.770
You also can't watch a movie with her.

1698
01:42:13.771 --> 01:42:18.180
You can't do any sort of things that indicate you have some sort of relationship

1699
01:42:18.450 --> 01:42:21.030
beyond fucking all right?

1700
01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:25.780
And you have to bang her like the filthy fucking whore that she is.

1701
01:42:26.430 --> 01:42:30.810
That's basically how you sustain a fuck buddy relationship.

1702
01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:34.830
You fucking,
you leave and that's all you do.
We are fuck buddies.

1703
01:42:34.831 --> 01:42:39.180
We're not movie slash fuck buddies.
We are fuck buddies and that is it.
All right.

1704
01:42:39.181 --> 01:42:42.600
If she calls you up and asks you to come over there and help hang a fucking

1705
01:42:42.601 --> 01:42:46.950
picture,
you don't have time,
you can't fucking do it.
All right.
That's it.

1706
01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:50.660
You are,
you are a dick and that's it.
Now,

1707
01:42:50.661 --> 01:42:52.310
if you want to have a fucking relationship with her,

1708
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:55.430
you've got to figure out if you really liked this girl,
at which point,

1709
01:42:55.431 --> 01:42:56.270
if you're mature enough,

1710
01:42:56.271 --> 01:43:00.170
you probably shouldn't try and fucker cause that will cloud everything.
Uh,

1711
01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:02.600
personally,
I've never been able to do that.
So good luck to you.

1712
01:43:02.630 --> 01:43:05.990
Those are your two options.
Fuck buddy relationship,

1713
01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:09.260
figuring out what the fuck you want to do and then act accordingly.

1714
01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:11.600
All right sir.
Good luck.

1715
01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:13.553
<v 6>MMM.</v>

1716
01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:18.700
<v 4>Hey Bill.
Uh,
I'm going on my 11th hour of work today,
but up it up.
Oh,</v>

1717
01:43:18.701 --> 01:43:22.240
I can read that part there.
Too many names here.
Okay.
Anyway,
spill.

1718
01:43:22.241 --> 01:43:25.120
I was fat and in a destructive relationship for most of college.

1719
01:43:25.330 --> 01:43:29.700
My confidence was just about ruined before I dumped the cut.
Uh,
and,

1720
01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:33.520
and I lost about 70 pounds.
Good for you.
See,
this guy did the right thing.

1721
01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:37.120
He got it for that guy.
With the first question.
This guy here,

1722
01:43:37.121 --> 01:43:41.200
he got out of a relationship.
All right?
And you look what happens.

1723
01:43:41.201 --> 01:43:44.830
It goes to the Jimmy drop 70 pounds.
Good for you.
Since then,

1724
01:43:44.831 --> 01:43:47.800
I've been with a lot of women and haven't had trouble meeting women.

1725
01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:51.590
I just know how to act confident.
I have fine,

1726
01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:56.620
but I do have trouble finding the line between asshole aggressiveness and simply

1727
01:43:57.321 --> 01:44:00.500
being confident.
Um,
all right,

1728
01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:04.010
well you're already banging a bunch of women.
You've lost 70 pounds.

1729
01:44:04.011 --> 01:44:06.620
It sounds like you're killing it.
So what,
what happened?

1730
01:44:06.621 --> 01:44:08.090
Did you piss off a couple of women?

1731
01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:11.040
What is your definition of asshole aggressiveness?

1732
01:44:11.070 --> 01:44:14.660
Or you talking to them and be like,
hey baby,
you just reach up and grab a titty.

1733
01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:18.890
You know,
this is the thing about being confident,

1734
01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:22.940
which you got to do is be confident about yourself,
but don't insult the woman,

1735
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:25.750
don't I,
I've never liked that.

1736
01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:29.480
Like some guys do that what they do is they go up there and how they,

1737
01:44:29.481 --> 01:44:34.100
how they get the girl to be in a weak position is they sort of,
uh,

1738
01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:38.240
say things to her that,
that kind of makes her like insecure.

1739
01:44:39.210 --> 01:44:43.250
Um,
I dunno what,
what is a good example of that type of stuff?

1740
01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:48.350
Like I know you can just make some sort of comment about the clothes they're

1741
01:44:48.351 --> 01:44:52.820
wearing or just something or just be like,
oh,

1742
01:44:52.821 --> 01:44:56.000
what is an example?
I see.
I never did that.
Not because I'm a fucking great guy,

1743
01:44:56.001 --> 01:44:59.960
just because I,
I have a need to be liked so I could never go that way.

1744
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:01.370
Um,

1745
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:06.080
although I have found that like reacting to other hot girls walking around the

1746
01:45:06.081 --> 01:45:09.800
club with a lot of girls will somehow,

1747
01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:12.890
I don't know,
it's just weird thing with that,

1748
01:45:12.891 --> 01:45:16.130
like that sort of their competitiveness,
you know,

1749
01:45:16.131 --> 01:45:19.760
if he could just get into conversation about them,
about,
you know,

1750
01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:22.760
how hot you think some other girl is.
I know that sounds fucked,

1751
01:45:22.761 --> 01:45:24.110
but this has actually worked for me.

1752
01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:29.900
And then you just start talking about what you like in women,
what turns you on,

1753
01:45:29.901 --> 01:45:32.540
and then you steer the conversation into sex and then you're in there.

1754
01:45:32.541 --> 01:45:37.541
So I would say for me the difference between being an asshole aggressive is if I

1755
01:45:38.271 --> 01:45:39.590
actually say something mean,

1756
01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:41.700
<v 6>uh,</v>

1757
01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:43.500
<v 4>I dunno.</v>

1758
01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:46.950
I don't think should ever be mean to a girl to try to get her to fuck you.

1759
01:45:46.951 --> 01:45:48.930
I just think that's like a cowardly way into it.

1760
01:45:48.931 --> 01:45:53.810
But you know for you to be a cocky ass hole
and if they just,

1761
01:45:53.811 --> 01:45:57.580
if they say that they compliment you about how you look,
just be like,
yeah,

1762
01:45:57.581 --> 01:46:00.540
I know I'm a,
you know,
I'm a good looking guy.
I don't know what it is.

1763
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:03.810
Women like me just along those fucking lights.

1764
01:46:04.410 --> 01:46:08.120
You just do that as,
as you sorta make it funny itself.

1765
01:46:08.130 --> 01:46:09.810
Then you show you have a sense of humor.
I would,

1766
01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:11.910
I would try to go that fucking route.
I don't know.
But once again,

1767
01:46:11.911 --> 01:46:15.090
you're talking to a guy,
looks like Ralph malf itself.
It probably works.
You know,

1768
01:46:15.091 --> 01:46:15.421
you guys,

1769
01:46:15.421 --> 01:46:18.350
maybe you guys can be assholes if you actually have some sort of pigment and

1770
01:46:18.351 --> 01:46:21.450
your hair.
Um,
all right,
let's plow ahead here.
A bill,

1771
01:46:21.451 --> 01:46:24.210
a friend of mine who I played in the bandwidth for over a year in high school,

1772
01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:29.211
lost his mother to a sudden Sart sudden heart attack at the memorial service.

1773
01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:34.350
I get out of my Dorky hippie Ford fusion hybrid at the Church and see a smoking

1774
01:46:34.351 --> 01:46:39.351
hot chick climbing out of a white 2010 Ford Mustang gt with racing stripes and

1775
01:46:40.710 --> 01:46:45.360
walks inside.
Dude,
that sounds like the beginning of a great fucking movie.

1776
01:46:46.290 --> 01:46:51.270
You know,
the nerd and his little douchey car.
And then some Hottie,
you know,

1777
01:46:51.690 --> 01:46:55.770
was it Christie Brinkley from those fucking a European vacation movies?

1778
01:46:56.540 --> 01:47:01.290
Um,
anyways,
it was mysterious and intriguing at the same time.
Exactly.

1779
01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:05.870
Uh,
I didn't know too many people at the funeral and uh,

1780
01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:07.020
I was the only guy.

1781
01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:07.910
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1782
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:11.990
<v 4>What?
I didn't know too many people here as I only met the guy through my younger</v>

1783
01:47:11.991 --> 01:47:14.690
brother.
It was not super close with him.

1784
01:47:15.970 --> 01:47:19.130
Then what the fuck are you doing with the funeral?
At the funeral.

1785
01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:25.780
Jesus Christ.
I'm his mother was an artist,
so after,
after the receiving line,

1786
01:47:25.781 --> 01:47:29.710
there was a reception with her art displayed around the room and I was sipping

1787
01:47:29.711 --> 01:47:34.090
coffee and looking at some of her art.
This is a fucking coolest funeral.

1788
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:36.550
Looking at some of our art on the wall,

1789
01:47:36.551 --> 01:47:39.490
I glanced to my right and there she is standing right next to me.

1790
01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:42.790
I lean in and I say,
I like your car.

1791
01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:46.000
45 minutes later after learning,

1792
01:47:47.050 --> 01:47:51.050
she is a nurse at a local hospital and graduated from my,

1793
01:47:51.051 --> 01:47:54.190
I learned that she was a nurse from a local hospital and graduated from my high

1794
01:47:54.191 --> 01:47:57.500
school.
Okay,
dude,
is this girl like a call girl?

1795
01:47:57.501 --> 01:47:59.060
If this sounds like a fucking call girl,

1796
01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:03.730
she just shows up in a hot car dressed like a fucking Hati.

1797
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.830
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1798
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:09.750
<v 4>and she's a fleshy wearing the nurse's outfit.
Anyways,
he goes on to say,</v>

1799
01:48:09.751 --> 01:48:14.700
I knew her family a little bit.
She loves sports.
Oh,
love sports care.

1800
01:48:14.701 --> 01:48:17.940
I decided to say goodbye to her and not ask for her number.
I mean,

1801
01:48:17.941 --> 01:48:22.380
it's a fucking funeral,
dude.
There's no rules when it comes to getting late.

1802
01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:26.610
Okay.
I don't give a shit if you're fucking tread water after a tsunami.

1803
01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:31.650
All right?
She didn't have time to put a brown.

1804
01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:34.320
She's got a t shirt on.
What you,
you're not going to fucking,
you know,

1805
01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:38.350
can't ask for a number at that point or fucking cell phones underwater,
I guess.

1806
01:48:38.351 --> 01:48:42.700
You know.
Hey,
you want to uh,
form a two person circle over here.

1807
01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:47.730
I heard it keeps the sharks away.
Sorry.
I'm anyways,

1808
01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:52.570
Blah Blah Blah.
But thanks to Facebook I get,
I find a route.

1809
01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:57.480
I find where the fuck she is her name and she has all these pictures.
Uh,
uh,

1810
01:48:57.490 --> 01:49:00.370
but she has all these pictures of her and some Chunky kid worse than the college

1811
01:49:00.371 --> 01:49:04.150
version of me.
She also has some status about a great Valentine's Day about,

1812
01:49:04.151 --> 01:49:05.770
but nothing about being in a relationship.

1813
01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:08.590
I know this sounds like teeny bop ship at this girl was amazing.

1814
01:49:08.591 --> 01:49:12.010
We hit it off and I sure don't want to fuck it up with some awkward shit.

1815
01:49:12.011 --> 01:49:13.660
We've exchanged a few emails and stuff,

1816
01:49:13.661 --> 01:49:16.900
but I don't know how to find out her deal without just asking.

1817
01:49:16.901 --> 01:49:20.080
I also don't want to come on too strong and ruined the friendship fetus by

1818
01:49:20.081 --> 01:49:22.630
creeping her out.
I want to ask her to her.

1819
01:49:23.410 --> 01:49:26.170
I want to ask her to the antisocial network show that you guys are doing with

1820
01:49:26.171 --> 01:49:28.690
Jim Norton.
Jim Breuer and David Tell,
uh,

1821
01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:33.400
but I have a real fear of ruining the great vibe we have with something she

1822
01:49:33.401 --> 01:49:34.600
might not be accepting.
All right.

1823
01:49:34.601 --> 01:49:36.760
Do what's you're basically doing by sitting here.

1824
01:49:36.761 --> 01:49:40.390
Being timid is you're getting yourself into that Chris rock friend zone.

1825
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:43.030
You have to meet.
You have to make a move right now.

1826
01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:46.990
You talked to her at the fucking funeral,

1827
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:49.780
talked to you for 45 minutes of at a funeral.

1828
01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:53.770
You didn't ask for the number right there.
You should have lost the game,

1829
01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:58.240
but because everybody gets a ribbon with this generation,
this Facebook,

1830
01:49:58.241 --> 01:50:01.210
so you get to fucking make it up.
Now she's exchanging emails with you.

1831
01:50:01.211 --> 01:50:02.980
How many more fucking clues do you need?

1832
01:50:03.670 --> 01:50:07.750
She has a vague sort of relationship status on her Facebook.

1833
01:50:08.850 --> 01:50:13.580
Ask her to the fucking shell.
It's perfect.
All right.

1834
01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:16.240
You're going to a comedy show will make her laugh.

1835
01:50:16.630 --> 01:50:19.990
You sit there laughing it up with our accidentally put her hand on your hand on

1836
01:50:19.991 --> 01:50:23.410
a fucking thigh and your red.
I know it's not that easy,
but dude,

1837
01:50:23.411 --> 01:50:25.780
you need to ask her out sooner rather than fucking later.

1838
01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:29.490
And a have a go to a comedy shelf.
That'd be a great,

1839
01:50:29.491 --> 01:50:34.270
I think that'd be a great idea.
And a,
that's it.
All right,
so ask a route.

1840
01:50:34.330 --> 01:50:37.600
That's my advice for this fucking week and I apologize for my horrific reading.

1841
01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:41.980
Let me give you some youtube videos here.
That'll all be up on theM podcast.com.

1842
01:50:41.981 --> 01:50:46.820
The official fan,
a website of the Monday morning podcasts.

1843
01:50:46.821 --> 01:50:49.840
We had 7,500 hits last week.
That's the most we've ever gotten.

1844
01:50:49.841 --> 01:50:53.650
So I want to thank everybody who has been going there.
Um,
so here we go.

1845
01:50:53.651 --> 01:50:55.020
Here's a youtube videos for the weekend.

1846
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:58.510
If you don't want to go up and look at them individually on Youtube,

1847
01:50:58.511 --> 01:50:59.530
you can look at them all right.

1848
01:50:59.531 --> 01:51:03.040
And our neat little row on the [inaudible] podcast.com.
All right,

1849
01:51:03.970 --> 01:51:08.740
for those of you who are into drugs,
man,
um,
we got a great one,

1850
01:51:08.741 --> 01:51:13.660
about a 1961.
It's a video on mushrooms and I believe,

1851
01:51:13.661 --> 01:51:15.760
I can't really tell what's going on here.
Uh,

1852
01:51:15.761 --> 01:51:18.940
I think it's the beginning of ecstasy.
I have no idea what,

1853
01:51:18.941 --> 01:51:22.390
but it's just great listening to the weird music that they're playing when they

1854
01:51:22.391 --> 01:51:26.770
describe what these mushrooms do to you.
Um,
Elvis is date rape,
blue,

1855
01:51:26.771 --> 01:51:30.460
Hawaii Blue Hawaii trailer.
Um,

1856
01:51:30.510 --> 01:51:33.040
it's just a bunch of clips of Elvis right before he bangs.

1857
01:51:33.041 --> 01:51:36.790
A lot of checks and some of the shit that he gets away with just being mean and

1858
01:51:36.791 --> 01:51:41.791
being really misogynistic and not to mention what's fucking hilarious is he

1859
01:51:42.581 --> 01:51:46.570
doesn't have a shirt on in most of it cause he's on the beach and you just to

1860
01:51:46.571 --> 01:51:49.600
see what being in shape look like.
Back in the day.

1861
01:51:49.601 --> 01:51:54.601
He has no abs and he has these little seventh grade arms in a little fucking

1862
01:51:56.351 --> 01:51:59.280
chest,
little chicken chess,
but basically in shit,

1863
01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:04.000
in shape back in the fifties and sixties just meant you weren't fat.
Uh,

1864
01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:05.980
he just suck in your gut a little bit,
but,
uh,

1865
01:52:05.981 --> 01:52:10.750
he has the most horrific bathing suit I've ever seen in my life.
And uh,
I dunno,

1866
01:52:11.230 --> 01:52:15.320
you could basically do a nine hour seminar at a feminist convention if,

1867
01:52:15.321 --> 01:52:19.450
if they just show this entire,
just the movie trailer alone.
Um,

1868
01:52:19.650 --> 01:52:22.810
and this is a bizarre video,
is a hidden camera bridge.

1869
01:52:22.811 --> 01:52:25.000
Cunt threatens to ruin ex's life.

1870
01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:28.240
This guy's marriage is falling apart and he's filming it.

1871
01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:31.020
It's just really bizarre.
Uh,

1872
01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:33.730
if you like watching something really fucking awkward,

1873
01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:37.870
just definitely check it out.
And um,
oh,
here's a new one.

1874
01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:42.070
This is what I call a pre nine 11.

1875
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:43.690
These youtube videos.

1876
01:52:43.691 --> 01:52:48.691
We just see people doing shit in public that nowadays would end with a felony

1877
01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:53.960
and the person on TV scolding them.
Um,
I know I've showed this video before,

1878
01:52:53.961 --> 01:52:57.320
but man jumps out of stands and catches football just in case for the new

1879
01:52:57.321 --> 01:53:01.220
podcast listeners on one Monday night football game,
uh,
the bears first,

1880
01:53:01.221 --> 01:53:05.540
the packers,
somebody kicked a field goal and as it's going through the uprights,

1881
01:53:05.541 --> 01:53:09.740
this guy jumps out of the stands and catches it.
I mean,

1882
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:13.520
you'd get tasered and you'd be put in jail immediately.
Now,

1883
01:53:13.521 --> 01:53:18.410
and not only does this guy not get tasered,
he goes back to the fucking stance.

1884
01:53:18.411 --> 01:53:20.330
He's allowed to continue watching the game.

1885
01:53:20.630 --> 01:53:24.560
And Dan Deardorff and Al Al Michaels had just laughing their fucking asses off

1886
01:53:24.561 --> 01:53:28.010
thick.
It's the greatest thing ever.
And it just makes me think about,
oh,

1887
01:53:28.011 --> 01:53:29.570
it wasn't a great before nine 11,

1888
01:53:30.110 --> 01:53:32.090
we didn't get to have a great time and do shit like that.

1889
01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:34.370
And it was just considered all innocent fun.

1890
01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:38.090
And it didn't have to be treated like it was that it was at a a Sama bin.

1891
01:53:38.091 --> 01:53:41.360
Ladin who just jumped out of the fucking stance and a,
all right,

1892
01:53:41.361 --> 01:53:46.160
the next youtube video,
this is a,
this is one for John Bonam fans.

1893
01:53:46.161 --> 01:53:49.640
This is a very rare video,
or just one I've never seen.

1894
01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:54.970
It's a Paul Mccartney video where it's Paul Mccartney and wings and friends at

1895
01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:59.030
some horrifically awful,
awful song called the a rock stra theme.

1896
01:53:59.570 --> 01:54:00.201
But they,
you know,

1897
01:54:00.201 --> 01:54:03.260
one of those things where they put together like an all star cast of people to

1898
01:54:03.261 --> 01:54:06.500
raise money.
I'm kind of like a precursor to the,

1899
01:54:06.501 --> 01:54:10.400
we are the world thing and they have three drummers to three drummers and one of

1900
01:54:10.401 --> 01:54:13.520
them is John Bonam is not only is he not playing Ludwig's,

1901
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:15.590
he's playing this drum kit.

1902
01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:20.150
I don't know if it's a north drum kit or there was another drum kit out there

1903
01:54:20.151 --> 01:54:24.650
called the sting ray in the late seventies and early eighties.
They had these,
uh,

1904
01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:29.920
this radical design on the drums where they sort of had the bottom of the drum.

1905
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:31.820
It looks like it's made,

1906
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:34.310
if you out were on acid and you were looking at a drum kit,

1907
01:54:34.311 --> 01:54:38.120
looks like it's melted and it's pointed out at the crowd.

1908
01:54:38.121 --> 01:54:39.890
Allegedly it made your Tom sound better,

1909
01:54:39.891 --> 01:54:44.360
but it's the only time I've ever seen John Bonham not playing.
Uh,

1910
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:48.050
one of his famous Ludwig kits in any of the drummers out there.

1911
01:54:48.051 --> 01:54:51.650
Can you please tell me what the kid is?
Cause I looked it up on the internet.

1912
01:54:51.651 --> 01:54:55.580
I tried to find images of sting,
ray drum kits,

1913
01:54:55.670 --> 01:54:56.990
and um,

1914
01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:02.480
I saw a couple of the modern ones where they had the warp,
uh,
Tom's,

1915
01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:06.860
but I couldn't find any of the classic ones.
Uh,

1916
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:10.700
I look through my old modern drummer one magazines and I couldn't find it.

1917
01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:14.390
But if anybody knows the name of the drum kit,
I'd love to know.
Uh,
all right.

1918
01:55:14.391 --> 01:55:17.420
And that's it.
I think that's it for this,
uh,
for this week.

1919
01:55:19.130 --> 01:55:23.190
Um,
yeah,
that's it.
A couple of movies.
Somebody says to move.

1920
01:55:23.191 --> 01:55:27.740
We do avoid battle Los Angeles.
Uh,
it is,

1921
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:31.460
it was like Independence Day took a shit all over the expendables.

1922
01:55:31.850 --> 01:55:33.020
Just didn't buy into it.

1923
01:55:33.021 --> 01:55:36.710
Maybe it's because I've been sober for a while and I saw it with a few potheads

1924
01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:38.150
who loved it to death.

1925
01:55:38.330 --> 01:55:42.740
Wouldn't shut the fuck up during the movie and kept making stupid comments like,

1926
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:47.460
dude,
we're fucked.
Um,
yeah.
I mean,
come on.

1927
01:55:47.461 --> 01:55:49.900
Who goes to Bat Los Angeles and actually thinks it's going to be cherry.

1928
01:55:49.901 --> 01:55:53.940
It's a fire.
Which I actually thought that movie sucked.
Uh,
yeah,

1929
01:55:54.150 --> 01:55:57.720
I think you need to smoke the meat.
That's the movie that that movie is for.

1930
01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:01.410
Potheads that's one.
You know,
you don't eat a fucking,
you know,

1931
01:56:01.411 --> 01:56:06.020
a little weed cookie and go see and have a good time.
Um,
seat.

1932
01:56:06.030 --> 01:56:09.750
That's right there.
There you go.
There's something positive about weed.

1933
01:56:09.751 --> 01:56:14.751
It makes mu awful movies like battle Los Angeles enjoyable and like relevant.

1934
01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:20.490
And somebody said Lincoln Lincoln lawyer was awesome.
All right,
that's it.

1935
01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:24.210
That is the podcast for this week.
You guys all have a great week.

1936
01:56:24.211 --> 01:56:27.510
Thanks for everybody who,
uh,
listens to the Monday morning podcast.

1937
01:56:27.511 --> 01:56:32.070
If you want to hear that epic argument,
uh,
that I had with a red band,

1938
01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:35.130
you know,
and yes,
we are friends.
We got along great.

1939
01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:38.340
Actually did a set itselves comedy whole,
we laughed about the arguments.

1940
01:56:38.341 --> 01:56:40.140
So you know,

1941
01:56:40.170 --> 01:56:43.710
there's no reason to gossip anything beyond if you just really want to listen to

1942
01:56:43.711 --> 01:56:48.360
a great argument of two people who just don't know how to say,
agree to disagree,

1943
01:56:48.930 --> 01:56:50.460
uh,
I definitely suggest to listen to.

1944
01:56:50.490 --> 01:56:54.690
I also definitely recommend subscribing to Joe Rogan's podcast.

1945
01:56:54.691 --> 01:56:56.940
It's fucking awesome.
I had a great time on it and that's it.

1946
01:56:56.941 --> 01:56:58.230
That's the podcast for this week.

1947
01:56:58.710 --> 01:57:03.710
I will see some of you at the Gibson MP theater on April 2nd for the,

1948
01:57:04.171 --> 01:57:07.380
uh,
Kevin and been comedy show that raises money for,

1949
01:57:07.381 --> 01:57:12.210
I forget what cause I know it's a great cause because no one ever raises money

1950
01:57:12.211 --> 01:57:16.650
for terrorists.
Right?
I guess unless you do a comedy show and like Saudi Arabia,

1951
01:57:16.710 --> 01:57:18.870
isn't that what they do?
You know,

1952
01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:21.510
that's how they raised money with their filthy fucking oil money.

1953
01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:26.100
Then they funnel it through the mosque is not how it goes down cause that other

1954
01:57:26.101 --> 01:57:29.490
paper trail goes down.
Do you guys leave?
Read Rolling Stone magazine?

1955
01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:33.480
You've got to check it out on these two pot heads who became international arms

1956
01:57:33.481 --> 01:57:35.610
dealers.
It's really interesting to watch too.

1957
01:57:35.611 --> 01:57:38.040
Kids get involved in that type of shit.

1958
01:57:38.041 --> 01:57:43.041
And also to see how that game is run and also kind of makes you understand

1959
01:57:43.111 --> 01:57:48.060
whilst why certain countries really do not like other countries and kind of

1960
01:57:48.061 --> 01:57:50.040
what's going on,
it's just completely fucked.

1961
01:57:50.710 --> 01:57:55.360
<v 0>Um,
so I definitely rank,
recommend checking that out,
man.
I,
that's it.</v>

1962
01:57:55.410 --> 01:57:58.800
All right.
Can I just shut the fuck up now?
I'm going to shut the fuck up now.

1963
01:57:58.820 --> 01:58:00.280
All right.
You guys have a great week.

1964
01:58:00.281 --> 01:58:02.050
Go Fuck yourself and I'll talk to you later.

1965
01:58:04.290 --> 01:58:09.290
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>
