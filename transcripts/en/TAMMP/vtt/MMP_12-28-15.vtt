00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.730
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:06.570
It's bill burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:11.570
December 28th,
2050 the final

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.470
<v 2>Monday</v>

5
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.270
<v 1>of 2015.
All right.
What are you going to?</v>

6
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.740
<v 0>Huh?
You gotta take advantage of it?</v>

7
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.610
You're going to get out there and fucking head.

8
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.340
<v 1>I just saw this really douchey commercial.</v>

9
00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:30.490
I'm recording this Sunday while I'm watching the end of the Seattle game and

10
00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:34.890
watching the packers get their fucking asses kicked by cardinals.
Um,

11
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.810
I just saw this commercial,
right?
This,
this lady,
she's in her car,
right?

12
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.460
Cute as a button driving along and she's in this city and she's like,

13
00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:50.461
there's over 2 million for his 60,317 people in this city and only one me.

14
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.460
And then she goes,
I like those odds.

15
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.150
And then this chick starts singing

16
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.090
<v 2>fucking fight or whatever.
The fuck.</v>

17
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.470
<v 1>So stupid.
I never seen hype over.
Absolutely nothing.
Like,
well,</v>

18
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:16.020
what do you mean you like those odds?
There's a,
is there a way to improve those?

19
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:19.740
Odds are you're going to drive up on the sidewalk and try to lower the fucking

20
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:21.510
numbers.
Yeah.
I like those.
Yeah.

21
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:25.950
I don't feel like fucking taken out anybody today.
I guess I can live with that.

22
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.603
Ah,

23
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.460
is this like the result of like sports,

24
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.200
like athletes and rappers and stuff?
Shit.
Talking.

25
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.870
It's become such a part of the culture that you got to say something dumb like

26
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:42.480
that.
Like back in the day you'd moved to the city and you'd be like,

27
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.770
oh Jesus Christ,
look,
go to these people.
I mean I pulled away,

28
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.050
I put my head down and I gave it the old college try and hopefully things work

29
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:57.561
out for me and I could get my own little piece of the pie here right now.

30
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.160
<v 0>Yes.
Fucking 3 million people here and just me.
Yeah.
Yes.
Suck my Dick.</v>

31
00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:03.994
I can handle that.

32
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.890
<v 1>I can drive into the street and your Ford focus the fuck are you talking about?</v>

33
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:13.590
What are you getting the trunk of your car that gives you that much confidence?

34
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:18.260
Huh?
Where do you go?
You got some gold bars,
Huh?
Um,

35
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.753
anyways,

36
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.450
I'm watching the end of the Seattle game here cause I feel like the Seahawks are

37
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:26.700
going to come back.
You know,
all sneaky Pete,

38
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.210
everybody's fucking talking about this guy.
They're talking about that guy.

39
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:35.110
Slowly but surely Seattle is clawing their way back into it.
Um,

40
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.910
hopefully there'll be on the road so we don't have to listen to how loud they

41
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:42.990
are.
Again,
low here in Seattle.
It's such a loud stadium.

42
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:46.710
We're gonna allow there.
You're just worried about Seattle.

43
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:49.830
You don't see one lumberjack in the fucking crowd,
you know,

44
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.840
with all the logging that goes on up there.

45
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.070
It's a bunch of coffee drinking cunts,

46
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.160
wearing a little curt with the Kurt Cobain fucking goatee.

47
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.310
Um,

48
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.770
you'd think every once in a while you'd find somebody actually wearing a flannel

49
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.980
because there were a lumberjack.
Not because they're into pearl jam.

50
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.880
That's all I'm saying.
It was Eddie did.
Eddie vetter,

51
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.450
did he use to cut down trees?
How about Kurt Cobain?

52
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:18.790
Did they use to do that stuff?
Is that what they did?

53
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.690
Is that why they dress like that or where they mocking with a dressing like

54
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.240
lumberjacks in an ironic way.
Um,

55
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.130
and if foreshadowing of the hipster movement that took hold somewhere in the mid

56
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:37.420
two thousands,
or maybe they were just cold,
you know,

57
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:40.060
it's always raining out there and they have to sing.

58
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.860
Maybe they wanted to protect their instrument.
I don't fucking know.

59
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.870
Um,
I saw,

60
00:03:47.871 --> 00:03:52.600
I got jogging down the street today in jeans and like these sneakers that were

61
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:53.111
mocking,

62
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:56.590
running sneakers and then he had a tee shirt on in this weird sort of tank top

63
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.120
and the exact same haircut of people I used to see have in like 1975.

64
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.800
You know,
it was just like this.
You try and really fucking hard.

65
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.600
I don't,
I don't,
I don't,
I don't understand it.
I don't understand.

66
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:15.250
Just your whole fucking wardrobe and you'll look is mocking another decade.

67
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.420
Is that what it is?
I don't fucking,
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't pretend to know.

68
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.260
Anyways,
let's talk a little sports here.
As much as people can't fucking stand,

69
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.740
a lot of people can't stand.
I don't give a shit,
you know,
I don't give a shit.

70
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:29.410
I don't have any advertising this week.
Okay.
That's what it's come down to.

71
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.020
You know,
me being a smart Alec in all of these fucking ads.

72
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.080
Right?
And then you guys egg and beyond.
Oh yeah.

73
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.810
You guys egging me on.
You know,
I,
I can't walk away from a fucking easy laugh.

74
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.600
Um,
now look at me,

75
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.050
Amanda in the year empty handed,

76
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.370
60 minutes of podcasting and no advertising

77
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.150
and only just one.
Me.
I like those odds.

78
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.170
Fucking toe shoes.
Good Lord.

79
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.660
I'd rather eat glass and fucking have to watch that whole fucking Yolo.

80
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.430
You know how we do a daily,

81
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:19.870
everything is so fucking important.
Me and my brothers,

82
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.640
um,
Oh don,
I just sound like an angry old man.
I'm not actually,

83
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.510
I'm actually got my feet up.
I'm drinking a Miller.
I'm having a good time.

84
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.240
Is a snow globe within reach?
I mean,
I don't have a lot to complain about.
Um,

85
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.700
you know,
and we're all extinct.

86
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:39.520
I think that's going to be the big thing that aliens,
we'll look at one day,

87
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.190
you know,
but they'll find,

88
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.000
they'll unearth is snow globes and they'll try to figure out what the fuck they

89
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:49.960
meant.
You know,
they probably think it was some sort of power source.

90
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.400
They hovered their hands over it.
Entity somehow could.
Anyway,

91
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:57.810
so let's talk about the,
let's talk about a little bit of football.
So,

92
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.233
<v 0>mmm.</v>

93
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.900
<v 1>I got,
you know,
word,
I don't even know how the fuck I found out about it.</v>

94
00:06:04.901 --> 00:06:07.210
That Peyton manning was accused

95
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.680
by all people,
Al Jazeera and God knows,

96
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.650
if you want to know about the national football league,

97
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:19.220
I don't know about you guys,
but I go to Al jazeera.com,

98
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.043
you know.

99
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

100
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.950
<v 1>I sift through all the Mohamad stories and the fuck it,
uh,</v>

101
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.520
what the u s government's really doing it.
I get to their,
their sports page.

102
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:34.180
<v 3>Okay.</v>

103
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.010
<v 1>And I uh,
yeah,
then I try to see what's going on in,
in NFL football.</v>

104
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.820
So
according to this,
this Al Jazeera,

105
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.250
you know,
Al Jazeera USA,
all right.
The off shoe,

106
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.900
you know what kind of like those Suny fucking colleges,

107
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.360
w Sony,
Dell High,
Suny Syracuse,
what are the,

108
00:06:57.361 --> 00:07:00.740
and all those fucking get off those colleges that have like more,

109
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.470
more change than like Mcdonald's.

110
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.140
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

111
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.850
<v 1>right.
You know what I'm talking about?
So anyway,
so they did some sort of a,</v>

112
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.000
the u s version,
um,

113
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.540
did some sort of investigative reporting and a allegedly found out that,

114
00:07:18.751 --> 00:07:19.680
uh,
you know,

115
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.150
Peyton manning and among others had been using HGH and Blahblahblahblahblah now

116
00:07:24.151 --> 00:07:27.030
do I believe in,
I don't give up.
I don't even give a shit personally.

117
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.160
But what was bugging me was the unbelievable lack of coverage.

118
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.480
You know,

119
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.320
it's a patriots fan watching my team get accused of every fucking thing under

120
00:07:37.321 --> 00:07:42.321
the sun and every fucking accusation being taken as the absolute fucking truth,

121
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.940
right?
Right.
Through fucking baseball season.
You know,

122
00:07:47.941 --> 00:07:51.720
other owners hiring people to investigate us.
And guess what?

123
00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:56.510
The fucking study that the losing fucking owner paid for came up with,
right.

124
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.740
Not a fucking word,
not a fucking word about it.
Fucking hilarious.

125
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.940
They're saying that Peyton's wife is a pharmacist.
I mean,

126
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:11.270
there's enough circumstantial evidence here to get Tom Brady fucking a six game

127
00:08:12.211 --> 00:08:16.590
suspension.
It ain't gonna happen.
You know,
why?
Cause it's not the patriots,

128
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.660
it's not the Patriots.
And also it's Al Jazeera.
So I think,
uh,
at some point,

129
00:08:21.661 --> 00:08:24.510
the whole support the troops,
you know?

130
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.290
<v 0>MMM.</v>

131
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.210
<v 1>Where we're trying to give them freedom.
Somehow that kicks in I think to it.</v>

132
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.260
But uh,
you know,
I just look at,

133
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:35.680
<v 0>okay.</v>

134
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.510
<v 1>Personally I don't think he did it all right.
However,</v>

135
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.110
if he did,
I don't give a shit and I don't know.
No,

136
00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:48.300
it doesn't change any of his fucking numbers.
To me.
The guy was on the ropes,

137
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:53.820
you know,
his fucking neck was dislocated from the rest of his body.

138
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.200
You,
we could spin it around like an hour.
I mean,

139
00:08:57.201 --> 00:08:58.880
you can't play football like that.

140
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.060
So he goes overseas or whatever the fuck he did.
Right.

141
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:06.980
He goes over to the Colby Center,
they stick his fucking liver in a center.

142
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.130
Fuge whatever the fuck it is that they do over there,
you know,

143
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.050
they spend your blood around the thing and they stick it back in.
Yeah.

144
00:09:16.051 --> 00:09:17.300
And then you're like a vampire.

145
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.120
You just set up in the coffin and next thing you know you're taking someone to

146
00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:23.910
the rack.
I don't have a problem with dad.

147
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.380
I love that athletes do that shit.
I'm not saying Peyton did,
obviously,

148
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:29.910
I don't think he did.
Ah,
cheeses.

149
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.040
And now the fucking card and it's got a God damn safety.

150
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:34.350
If they don't take this away,
they're going to take this away.

151
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:35.340
<v 4>Okay.</v>

152
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.870
<v 5>We got a penalty all the day.</v>

153
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:41.871
Facts personal fast tackling the quarterback too hard.

154
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.280
He got it boss full.
That's illegal.
You can't touch him in the head.

155
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.880
You can't touch him in the April.
Be careful around his waist.

156
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.180
If you could just sort of pick them up and lay him down like a toddler that fell

157
00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:00.330
asleep on your cell phone and you're just going to talk a man.

158
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.450
We won't have to throw all these damn flax.

159
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:09.350
<v 1>Um,
anyways.
I don't think he did the ship,</v>

160
00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:13.670
but if he did,
I'd be excited.
I'd be happy that he did it.
You know why?

161
00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:17.510
Because eventually,
whatever,
whatever those fucking doctors learned,

162
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.860
allegedly what it shooting that shit into fucking GRANDPA's neck there.

163
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:28.850
Eventually that's going to help me out someday when I'm old or it's funny,

164
00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:31.430
I'm older than him,
but his body,
his body is like fucking,
you know,

165
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:36.500
20 years older than me.
Right.
Although he does have a nice head of hair.

166
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.580
I'm just saying everything that these athletes have taken,

167
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.870
especially the illegal shit,
that's all going to help us in the future.
Who knows?

168
00:10:44.871 --> 00:10:48.500
Maybe something that they're trying to take to get that ball and socket joint

169
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.960
back into place.
So suddenly find that the,

170
00:10:50.961 --> 00:10:55.550
that a side effect is it grows a nice lion's mane worth the hair.
Right.

171
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.750
And then while I'm going to be lining right up for,

172
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.890
that's what happened with Viagara,
they would,
they would go out,

173
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:03.940
I can't remember what the fuck it was supposed to do.

174
00:11:03.941 --> 00:11:08.060
It was supposed to do something else.
Then all of a sudden the guy's like,
yeah,

175
00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:11.660
you know why?
Yeah,
my left hand's still twitching,
but God damn it,

176
00:11:11.661 --> 00:11:13.640
my Dick is standing up.

177
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.310
And then they would probably be sitting in the boat while I stop thinking about

178
00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:21.430
sexual things.
We'll try to do an experiment here.
And he's like,
no,

179
00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:22.031
you don't understand.

180
00:11:22.031 --> 00:11:25.780
I'm not thinking about anything and my deck is not stood up in years.

181
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.570
And then they all went,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

182
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.740
And they told the guy to just sit down.
Right.

183
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.560
And then all the scientists got together and they would just go like,

184
00:11:38.561 --> 00:11:39.910
wait a second,
wait a second.
We just,

185
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.040
it didn't fix fix his lefthand twitching,
but it made his dick stand up.

186
00:11:45.041 --> 00:11:49.300
Now I just hear me out.
Um,

187
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.530
this might be a little gross,

188
00:11:50.531 --> 00:11:55.531
but I have this sneaking suspicion that a lot of guys over the age of 70

189
00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.500
<v 4>okay.</v>

190
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.760
<v 1>That if they still could would whip their dick out and fuck something.</v>

191
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:05.723
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

192
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:10.890
<v 1>But I think that this is a very large untapped market of old guys with flacid</v>

193
00:12:12.841 --> 00:12:15.300
Cox that we could bring back to life.

194
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.870
Get them back out there,
you know?

195
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:20.860
<v 4>Okay.</v>

196
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.930
<v 1>Fucking some prostitutes and get them into that.</v>

197
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.470
They've been thinking clear for the first time in their life since they hit

198
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:30.880
puberty.
Let's,
let's,
let's get them back into trouble again.
What do you say?

199
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.380
I want to see an 80 year old get a sexual harassment case,
don't you?

200
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.800
And actually,
you know you've got the blue pills,
so who knows?

201
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:42.430
All I'm saying is all you fucking Patriot cuts out there.
Haters out there.

202
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.170
All right.
Been in the Patriots up and down.

203
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.300
Lie in your asses off.

204
00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:53.301
So they stole playbooks and they filled the last practice and all those lies

205
00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:58.581
that were told that were presented as truth until ESPN detracted them at 1230 in

206
00:13:00.211 --> 00:13:04.710
the fucking morning.
Bunch of fucking cowards.
Right?
I want you guys to,

207
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:08.770
I want you to treat this circumstantial evidence on old,

208
00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:13.620
long neck Magoo the same fucking way you did on the dimpled wonder there in New

209
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.840
England.
I want you guys to fucking talk about it.
Okay?

210
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.120
I want you to talk about how they've gotten away with murder.

211
00:13:18.121 --> 00:13:20.220
I want you to trace it back to Jim or say,

212
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.670
and I want to see this be a big fucking scandal that goes right through baseball

213
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.900
season,
right?
Can you guys do it?
Come on.
I think you got it in Ya.

214
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:29.580
<v 4>Okay.</v>

215
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.550
<v 1>I made,
if you could take fucking air pressure for fucking eight months.</v>

216
00:13:32.551 --> 00:13:37.110
I know you can take HGH and his wife's a pharmacist.
Come on.
It's right there.

217
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.250
All the circumstantial evidence you need.
Yeah.

218
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:45.420
Where'd you read this now to Sarah.
That's game set.

219
00:13:45.421 --> 00:13:48.520
Match at a buffalo wild wings.
Um,

220
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.480
<v 4>okay.</v>

221
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.010
<v 1>Anyways,
I love it.
I love it.</v>

222
00:13:52.011 --> 00:13:54.890
It's nice to see somebody else get falsely accused and they don't have a fucking

223
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.310
goddamn whatever the fuck is on the side of our helmet.
Got Damn it.

224
00:13:58.311 --> 00:14:01.160
Those are ugly uniforms.
I've hated those things since day one.

225
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.353
<v 4>Okay.</v>

226
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.000
<v 1>I don't understand why this quarterback is where Neil Lomax is.</v>

227
00:14:06.001 --> 00:14:10.590
Old Number or is he wearing number five?
I have no idea.

228
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.630
Um,
oh,
by the way,
the uh,
patriots lost to the jets.

229
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:20.820
We lost to the jets and a congratulations to the jet fans out there.

230
00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:25.320
I know.
You're all excited.
You're all excited.
You're like,
oh my God,

231
00:14:25.321 --> 00:14:26.160
we fucking beat him.

232
00:14:26.161 --> 00:14:29.340
A Windsor where and I know that they're really injured and stuff and I know,

233
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.470
but Blahblahblahblahblah and Oh my God,

234
00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:35.070
can you believe that that guy fucked up the coin toss.

235
00:14:35.071 --> 00:14:38.460
He won the coin toss and then he said he was going to kick off a blah,
blah,
blah.

236
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.130
And this is how dumb jet fans are.

237
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:47.120
They actually think that that wasn't a calculated move by the genius bill

238
00:14:47.941 --> 00:14:50.500
Bellacheck.
Everybody thinks that's a big fuck up.

239
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.130
Maybe one thinks that guy's going to get yelled at by bill Bellacheck.

240
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.880
You ever think that maybe bill told him to go and do that?
Say go out there.

241
00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:03.160
All right.
Is the deal.
If they win the coin toss,
they're going to get the ball.

242
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.060
All right?
If we win the coin toss,
you just tell him you gonna kick it.
All right,

243
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.730
because here's the deal.
We're really injured right now.
All right?

244
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.010
Okay.
W We,
we,

245
00:15:14.011 --> 00:15:17.740
we got nobody left for a fucking division two team here at this point.

246
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.230
All right?
I don't know about you guys,

247
00:15:20.231 --> 00:15:22.240
but I would love to play the jets in the playoffs.

248
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.250
We all know we can kick their fucking ass,

249
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.900
but the problem is it's those green cards might not make the playoffs.

250
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.570
Okay?
Now we've made it look good here.
Okay?

251
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.180
We've tied them to the regular season.
Let's,
uh,
you know,

252
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.430
let's just make sure they win this one.
Maybe they'll law,
maybe they'll fucking,

253
00:15:40.431 --> 00:15:44.900
when a nice tackle by the quarterback on a fumble.
Very nice.

254
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.330
Um,
maybe they'll low,
you know,
they be,

255
00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:48.950
we'll get to meet him again in the playoffs.

256
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.310
Then will be healthy and then we'll kick their fucking ass.

257
00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:54.080
There'll be one less thing we got to worry about.

258
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:58.960
And I know people in New York City,
a big thing in New York season,

259
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:04.390
a city is a regular season winner for 90% of your fucking tapes.

260
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.350
Not for the GI.
It's not for the Yankees,

261
00:16:06.351 --> 00:16:10.610
but for the rest of them it's a big fucking deal.
Okay.

262
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.120
It's a big deal.
If the next one,
a regular season game,
it's a big deal.

263
00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:18.890
If the Brooklyn Nets,
oh,
the New York mets or the New York jets,

264
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.360
the New York Rangers and New York Islanders,
the buffalo bills,

265
00:16:23.361 --> 00:16:27.440
the fucking sabers,
any of those other nine ass fucking teams.

266
00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:30.980
If they went anything,
it's a big deal.
So congratulations.
Um,

267
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.510
I'm fucking with you,
man.
We totally screwed up,
but a,

268
00:16:33.511 --> 00:16:36.240
and that could actually be a good thing for us.
You know,

269
00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.700
I'd love to play the fucking jets again.

270
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.860
I liked the odds of us playing the jets again,

271
00:16:40.861 --> 00:16:42.780
having lost to them the previous time.

272
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:47.880
That's one less week I got to worry about having said that,
I think,

273
00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:50.430
uh,
I think it's,
this is,

274
00:16:50.431 --> 00:16:54.720
this is not in depth analysis whatsoever,
but you got to admit Seattle,

275
00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:01.140
uh,
Carolina or fucking Phoenix,

276
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:05.010
Phoenix looks like fucking world beaters.
Um,

277
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:07.650
I just don't think the AFC has it.

278
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.180
I don't think I always say that every fucking year.
We won it last year,
you know?

279
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.990
But who knows.
I don't,
I don't think we do all right enough with that shit.
Oh,

280
00:17:15.991 --> 00:17:18.360
by the way,
you know,
it's so,
you know something.
I don't want to hear about it.

281
00:17:18.361 --> 00:17:21.330
I don't want to hear about the fucking 72 dolphins drinking their fucking

282
00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:26.160
champagne again.
You know,
I'd love to see a picture of that.

283
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.680
All those five foot nine defensive Lineman,

284
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:34.840
that's stupid ass tape.
I was so sick.
I hear it about those fucking guys,

285
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.730
you know enough already with the celebrating you had they,

286
00:17:39.731 --> 00:17:42.190
those constant and have to deal with any sort of pressure.

287
00:17:42.191 --> 00:17:46.360
What's compared to nowadays going undefeated.
I gotta be honest with you.

288
00:17:46.361 --> 00:17:49.930
I don't even think the panthers really going to deal with anything,
you know?

289
00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.070
No one gave a fuck.

290
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:56.830
It's Carolina don't get it only matters if it's in Boston or New York.

291
00:17:56.831 --> 00:17:58.610
It's the only place pressure matters.

292
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.090
There's no pressure anywhere else in the fuck everyday.

293
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:05.270
But he sells you fucking live and it's just apple pies sitting on a window sill,

294
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.960
you know,
tell you guys just soft

295
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.940
fucking with you.
Um,

296
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.400
I would lovely Tony Roma's reaction to that.

297
00:18:16.401 --> 00:18:20.150
After all the fucking shit he's taken a Dallas,
it's bad enough.

298
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.170
You got to get yelled at by people who can't fucking even play the game at a

299
00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:25.010
high school level.

300
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:29.240
You got to look at people who get botox shot to their face wearing a cowboy hat,

301
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.510
questioning your abilities under center.
I mean,
I just,

302
00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:36.020
I just don't understand it.
It's gotta be brutal itself.
But anyways,

303
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.230
getting back to the 72 dolphins,
so it's fucking conscience.
Back in the day,

304
00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:44.900
like I told you,
it's sports was the last five minutes of the local news.

305
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:49.580
That's it.
That was it.
There was no big fucking story.
You know,

306
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.180
young people watch sports back then were sports fence.
That was it.

307
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:58.930
Half the halftime show at the super bowl would be like some local college band

308
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.210
and then that I'd done that Tech Tech Tech Tech Day.

309
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.780
It'll be a regular fucking halftime.

310
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:09.100
They played the super bowl during the day was like light out on the,

311
00:19:09.321 --> 00:19:10.640
on the fuck at east coast.

312
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.213
<v 4>Okay.</v>

313
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.470
<v 1>They play it outside.
Okay.
Sorry.</v>

314
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.890
Um,
anyways,
I,
I really don't want to hear about that.
I,

315
00:19:21.891 --> 00:19:25.810
I'm just being honest.
I'm not trying to be a cunt.

316
00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.070
I'm just saying,
by the way,
I'm watching this,
as I mentioned,

317
00:19:30.071 --> 00:19:32.020
I'm watching this Arizona Green Bay game.

318
00:19:32.021 --> 00:19:34.660
Is anybody else hearing that fucking lady?

319
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:39.690
Every time the packers have the balls screaming or that little kid every time

320
00:19:40.961 --> 00:19:42.710
they,
every time there's a play.
You just his presence.

321
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.610
<v 4>Wow.
Okay.</v>

322
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.880
<v 1>It's been driving me nuts.
Um,
all right,
20.
I'm just switched over.</v>

323
00:19:55.881 --> 00:19:59.810
23,
10 St Louis Silva,
Seattle.

324
00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.260
Seattle's got the ball and they're driving.
Oh,

325
00:20:02.261 --> 00:20:05.990
this is perfect it down by two scores.
Two touchdowns.
They're going to win 24,

326
00:20:05.991 --> 00:20:09.680
23 there's three minutes left.
We'll see what happens.

327
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.770
We will see what happened.
You know,
it's funny,

328
00:20:12.771 --> 00:20:14.690
you guys already know what happens.
Why am I saying this?

329
00:20:14.691 --> 00:20:18.260
Like it's an amazing thing.
All right,
so here's something for you this weekend,

330
00:20:18.261 --> 00:20:22.580
right?
I drove out to visit some family,
right?

331
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.670
So Faye,
Emily,
and I'm

332
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.860
the fucking,
uh,
you know,

333
00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:35.240
we leave at like 11 in the morning because my wife likes to sleep,
you know,

334
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.540
and one thing I've learned,
I want thank,
you know,
when I was a kid,

335
00:20:38.541 --> 00:20:41.390
like I'm in my house.

336
00:20:41.391 --> 00:20:43.760
If someone was sleeping and you had something to say to them,

337
00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:48.180
you just started talking to them,
which was so fucking annoying.

338
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:50.600
And um,

339
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:52.840
<v 0>okay.</v>

340
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.110
<v 1>I just fucking,
you know,
I just don't do that to people.
You know what I mean?</v>

341
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.800
I've tried to correct a few of the fucked up things that happened to me.
Um,

342
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.660
so my wife sleep and I'm just sitting there going,
oh my God,

343
00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:05.620
this trappers can be horrific.
Which it was,
of course it was absolutely horrific.

344
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.203
And um,

345
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.040
<v 0>okay,</v>

346
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.630
<v 1>we ended up,
we get on the highway,</v>

347
00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:13.210
I would drive and one drive and drive and it's just this fucking ridiculous

348
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:17.140
traffic.
And then my wife,
of course,
it has to be all right.

349
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.460
Which is one of the things that happens when you travel with a woman.
Okay?

350
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.260
They're going to be putting makeup on the car.

351
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.230
They're going to make your fucking an hour late at least.

352
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.360
And at some point they're going to have to pee.

353
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.650
So she's trying to hold it and she find just cause I can't hold it,
I got to go.

354
00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:37.740
So I pull off the first fucking exit and the first fucking exit I pull into,

355
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.690
um,
it was like a circle k in a McDonald's.
And so I go for the Mcdonald's.

356
00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:49.660
And uh,
it turns out that Mcdonald's is part of this fucking,
uh,

357
00:21:49.661 --> 00:21:53.080
one of the what equals an outlet mall.

358
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.220
And this is the day after Christmas.
And,
uh,

359
00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.090
I would think the day after Christmas,
there'd be nobody at a fucking mall.

360
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.353
<v 0>Right.</v>

361
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.600
<v 1>You got all your gifts.
It's fucking over.
Right.
Stay home.</v>

362
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:14.540
Enjoy the day off,
dude.
I get the,
it's fucking mopped.

363
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:16.980
You can't even get in.

364
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.020
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

365
00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.860
<v 1>Like my wife had to get out in traffic because she couldn't hold him or to run</v>

366
00:22:21.861 --> 00:22:23.060
into the fucking Mcdonald's.

367
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:28.300
And then I'm stuck in this traffic jam of fucking animals.

368
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:29.970
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

369
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.090
<v 1>Bunch of fucking animals.
They're all walking.
First of all,</v>

370
00:22:33.091 --> 00:22:34.380
they're not walking on the sidewalk.

371
00:22:34.381 --> 00:22:37.440
They're walking out where the cars are driving,
looking for parking spots,

372
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.060
and of course they're walking three,
four abreast.

373
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:42.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

374
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.510
<v 1>I swear to God with the population problem,</v>

375
00:22:44.511 --> 00:22:46.850
shouldn't you at least be able to just clip the last one?

376
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.990
Just fucking run him over a bunch of fucking animals just walking around,

377
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:55.550
coming out with more bags of shit.
It's like,
did she just get a bunch of shit?

378
00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.240
So,
um,
of course my wife goes in there,

379
00:22:59.241 --> 00:23:02.300
you know she's going to use the ladies room and there's always a fucking line.

380
00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.340
I don't know what they do in there.

381
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.470
<v 0>Okay.</v>

382
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:08.560
<v 1>But you know,
whatever,
whatever a guy does,
if a woman's doing it,</v>

383
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:10.860
you got to add like another 60% yeah.

384
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.960
<v 0>Time.
All right.</v>

385
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.080
<v 1>It takes you a minute.
It's going to take her a minute and 40.</v>

386
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:19.853
<v 0>Right.</v>

387
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.350
<v 1>You get involved with something that's going to take you 10 minutes.</v>

388
00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:24.880
You know what?
See it.
You see what happens?

389
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.830
It's going to take them 16 minutes and so on,
and that's on a good fucking day.

390
00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.300
It's on a good fucking day.
So she goes in there.
You of course,

391
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:39.260
it's like fucking 9 million.
Let all that so fumble.
That's a fumble,

392
00:23:39.261 --> 00:23:43.430
right?
Dad's knee wasn't on the ground.
The ball k bad right there,
right?

393
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:48.030
It's a fumble game over the ranch.

394
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:54.310
Are they going to beat him twice in one season?
Same Old Rams.

395
00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.700
What do we got here?
They go into the video booth.
Be Carol is upset.

396
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:04.260
The rams are doing little dances like Dave.

397
00:24:04.261 --> 00:24:06.990
Dave done something in the last fucking 15 years.

398
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.300
What are they so excited about?
Oh,
they got the ball.

399
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.250
I was just going to say,
how the fuck is it raining in the,

400
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.650
in a,
in Saint Louis.
They got a dome.

401
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.410
Then I realize the home team's cause I,
I'll never get used to that.

402
00:24:26.411 --> 00:24:31.150
The home team not wearing white.
Ah,
that's funny.
This guy,

403
00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:36.010
this guy's yelling at somebody in the crowd.
I don't care.
I don't give a fuck,

404
00:24:36.011 --> 00:24:40.660
man.
I don't give a fuck.
You know what he's saying?
Yeah.
We want a Superbowl.

405
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.310
You never won shit.
I don't give a fuck.
Yes you do.

406
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.850
Um,
that's hilarious.
Oh,
the rams.

407
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.030
Why are they all the rams are being idiots right now.
They're fucking,

408
00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.750
they're talking trash to the Saint Louis fans.
How does that help you?

409
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.500
How does that help you give them something to rally around?

410
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

411
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:08.170
<v 1>This is hilarious.
Seattle fans are getting the treatment they exist,</v>

412
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:12.380
they fucking deserve,
and they,
I,
you know,

413
00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.360
I guarantee they're going to get fucking offenders.
Um,

414
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.430
oh my God.
Well,
at least there are a bunch of lumber jacks and the crowds,

415
00:25:19.431 --> 00:25:21.720
so they should,
you know what?
Now that it's raining and they're losing,

416
00:25:21.721 --> 00:25:25.080
like all the fucking tech geeks are going to go leave and go to a coffee shop,

417
00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.760
take out their mittens.
You know,
those fragile women too,
that like drink coffee,

418
00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:33.920
they got to hold it with both hands because they're,
they're fucking,
they're,

419
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.660
their appendages are always fucking cold.
Does that we call your fingers,

420
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.250
Phalanges tarsals metal tarsals Phalanges.

421
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.210
Carpals metacarpals Phalanges.

422
00:25:42.211 --> 00:25:46.050
Isn't that what I learned to biology class way back in the day?
Uh,

423
00:25:46.051 --> 00:25:46.711
for Christ sake,

424
00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:50.660
quit running the fucking ball and try to get a first down your pussies lay up

425
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.390
for all the ball and this area that rarely,
why is it easier and another area.

426
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.060
All right,
don't let it go.
You know,

427
00:25:57.061 --> 00:25:58.680
this is usually the time I would take a break.

428
00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:02.040
I take a break and I would read a read a little bit of advertising.

429
00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.550
I never thought I'd say this.
I actually miss it.

430
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.350
I actually miss reading out loud.
Well,

431
00:26:07.351 --> 00:26:09.150
why don't I read about Peyton manning out loud?

432
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.120
A little bit of advertising this week.
Paint.

433
00:26:13.121 --> 00:26:17.580
Manning said he is furious and disgusted at an Al Jazeera report.

434
00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.360
The second it says Al Jazeera,
this thing just holds no fucking water

435
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.000
that identified the Denver Broncos quarterback.
You know,

436
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:29.600
what a fuck does Al Jazeera get off doing a fucking,
you know what I mean?

437
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:34.550
Everybody getting out of their wheelhouse.
It's like when I was on Jimmy Fallon,

438
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:36.890
I was talking about Mcdonald's.
They started making salad.

439
00:26:36.891 --> 00:26:40.130
You don't make salads the fuck are you doing?

440
00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:41.930
No one's going to Mcdonald's to get a salad.

441
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:46.630
Nobody goes to Al Jazeera to fucking learn about what's going on in the NFL.

442
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.640
Yeah,
he's fucking idiots.
Correct.

443
00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.560
When am I be better homes and gardens and find out what's going on in fucking

444
00:26:54.561 --> 00:26:57.950
hockey?
You know,
I'm sorry,

445
00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:01.100
I should be a little more openminded.
Shouldn't I?
Right.

446
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:05.150
Being the Hollywood liberal cunt that I am or should night,

447
00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.140
so my wife has a new vehicle and uh,

448
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:14.170
it's got all the latest technology on it and this thing,

449
00:27:14.451 --> 00:27:17.180
it has like these sensors.

450
00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.540
So if you get anywhere near anything,

451
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.890
like when you're first starting to get close to it just goes

452
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:25.410
<v 6>boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.</v>

453
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:26.640
<v 1>Get up closer.
It goes,</v>

454
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.760
<v 6>but more,
more,
more,
more,
more,
more,
more,
more,
more,
more,
more,
more,
more,
more,
more.</v>

455
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.690
<v 1>And then when you're [inaudible] way of,
you're in danger of hitting,</v>

456
00:27:32.691 --> 00:27:33.524
somebody just goes,

457
00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:40.020
so every time you back out of my fucked up driveway,

458
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.070
because there's no room and it's shaped like an upside down triangle.
Well,

459
00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:49.000
the walls start closing in whenever I'm backing up the fucking thing,
it's gone,

460
00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.540
<v 6>baby,
baby,
baby,
baby,</v>

461
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.600
<v 1>do the health.
And I'm just in there,
just go on,
shut the fuck he</v>

462
00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.970
screaming like it literally,
I have to.

463
00:27:59.971 --> 00:28:04.890
Same fucking anxiety I had when I back that thing up because of those stupid

464
00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:05.910
fucking ringing things.

465
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:10.200
It's like when I was a kid and I used to watch those action movies and I used to

466
00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:14.640
believe at some point that that Stallone or Schwarzenegger could actually die in

467
00:28:14.641 --> 00:28:17.970
one of their own movies,
you know,
you know,
in the end when they would be like,

468
00:28:17.971 --> 00:28:21.630
do I clip the red wire,
the white wire,
you know,
and it's counting down three,
two,

469
00:28:21.631 --> 00:28:24.870
one.
Like that level of stress as I'm just backing out.

470
00:28:24.871 --> 00:28:28.560
So what I've learned to do is I've learned to block it out.

471
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.280
Like now I just accept that that's what it's gonna do you know,

472
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.810
when I was actually thinking this must be like,
what field goal kickers do?
Well,

473
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:41.520
they don't see those fat meat tinted fucks behind the,
uh,
they just see the,

474
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:43.890
they just see the goalposts.
Right.

475
00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.630
And I'm just going to put it right through there.
And they don't,

476
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:50.631
they don't see all those people flapping their arms and screaming and jumping up

477
00:28:51.151 --> 00:28:55.560
and down and doing whatever the fuck it is that they feel like they should be

478
00:28:55.561 --> 00:28:59.700
doing.
You know?
Or like when you go to take a foul shot,
it's the same thing.

479
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:03.420
Like that's the mental space.
I feel like I have to go into just a back,

480
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.530
a fucking care van or whatever the fuck we got here.

481
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.400
I did not fuck you call it style of vehicle out of the goddamn driveway.

482
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.493
<v 5>MMM.</v>

483
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:17.350
<v 1>Anyways,
can you tell him filibuster in here.
You know,</v>

484
00:29:17.351 --> 00:29:19.960
I'm just trying to get to a half an hour then I'm going to do the fucking,
uh,

485
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:22.900
I'm going to do the reeds for that.
We all,
by the way,

486
00:29:22.901 --> 00:29:27.370
thank you for everybody for rap and who've been watching.
F is for family.
Uh,

487
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.910
I just,

488
00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:32.910
I got word from somebody who knows one of the guys at the top of a Netflix food

489
00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.300
chain there and they said that F is for family,
is killing it.

490
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.180
So I want to thank you guys for that.
And uh,

491
00:29:40.181 --> 00:29:42.740
we're already starting to think about,
you know,

492
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.580
what we can do in season two to take it to a new level.

493
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.980
Um,
you know,
provided they fucking,
you know,
give us one.
We'll see.

494
00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:56.280
Oh,
who's that?
Which Barbara is that?
Is that Tiki or Rod Day?

495
00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.430
I don't know.
Oh,
but you know what?
The Guy,
the guy won Fox.

496
00:30:01.431 --> 00:30:04.940
That's the guy used to be on ESPN long time ago and all of a sudden he was just

497
00:30:04.941 --> 00:30:09.740
gone.
He was,
God,
you know that he was one of the guys,

498
00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:12.800
I got the idea for that pilot I did with the always sunny guys that for some

499
00:30:12.801 --> 00:30:14.150
reason they didn't fucking pick up

500
00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.440
one of those guys that was just there and then they're just gone.
You're like,

501
00:30:18.441 --> 00:30:21.980
what the fuck ever happened to that guy?
Whatever happened to hang on a second.

502
00:30:21.981 --> 00:30:23.470
I gotta I gotta turn the light on.

503
00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.150
<v 0>It's getting dark here.
Hey,</v>

504
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:30.040
here's something positive you guys can think you can think about here.

505
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:35.830
<v 1>Is that as of what the 22nd or the 21st or whatever the days are now getting</v>

506
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:41.060
lighter.
Al fucking lighter.
Um,

507
00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.030
how do you know if you're broke it tone?

508
00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.050
I don't know what the fuck is wrong with my toe.

509
00:30:48.051 --> 00:30:51.290
Every time I've branded a little bit,

510
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.190
I get a shot of pain.
I can't tell if it's just cause I'm fucking old.

511
00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.950
I just have old feet.
Now
speaking of old feet,
I was in cvs,

512
00:31:00.951 --> 00:31:02.300
you know,
they got the foot aisle.

513
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:06.510
I was trying to find these Ziploc bags cause uh,

514
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.920
I'm going to make a bunch of those round fucking ice cubes.

515
00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.430
I'm sticking them in a Ziploc bag and stuffing them in the cooler for the Rose

516
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:17.490
Bowl.
So when we drink scotch at like seven in the morning,
had a glass,

517
00:31:17.491 --> 00:31:20.390
as you know,
we can have a little round ice cubes.
You know what I mean?

518
00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:23.390
It's all about the fucking tail gate,
right?
So this is all I'm thinking about.

519
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.710
So I'm going into cvs.

520
00:31:24.711 --> 00:31:28.640
I went to the gym this morning and it wasn't open so early.
I got there,

521
00:31:28.641 --> 00:31:30.230
but the cvs was open.
So I was like,

522
00:31:30.231 --> 00:31:33.470
I know I'm going to go in there and I'm going to get some zip lock bags and I

523
00:31:33.471 --> 00:31:35.900
come walking in there and there's two employees.

524
00:31:35.901 --> 00:31:39.350
One of them is fucking vacuuming,
the other one's stuck in the God damn shelves.

525
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:41.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

526
00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:42.200
<v 1>So,</v>

527
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.250
and all I see is a bunch of self checkout things and people checking themselves

528
00:31:46.251 --> 00:31:49.370
out and I'm like,
I'm not fucking doing this.
So I just walk up to the register,

529
00:31:49.371 --> 00:31:49.971
I'm standing there,

530
00:31:49.971 --> 00:31:54.500
I'm standing there and then the lady comes by with the vacuum cleaner and the

531
00:31:54.501 --> 00:31:58.430
fucking store is open.
She goes,
oh,
it's just,
just a self helps are open now.

532
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.490
And I just said,
well I don't do that.
And I just said,
I just left the shit,

533
00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.610
walked out,
what it should have been.
It's like,
I don't do that stuff.

534
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.360
I need someone to help me at this register right now.
And they're just like,

535
00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:12.210
well I can't help you because if I get,
you know,

536
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.760
there's no customer service anymore.
And when I was,

537
00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.150
I left and I just sat there thinking about it going like,
you know what?

538
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:24.720
That's going to be the future
and the future,
there's going to be,
nobody works.

539
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:28.300
So you just gonna walk in like at night when there's nobody there,

540
00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:33.930
they're going to stock the shelves and then they're just gonna fucking leave.

541
00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:38.590
And then during the day,
you know,
you walk in and then you,

542
00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:42.420
what you have to do is you pick out whatever's there and then you scan it,

543
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:47.370
you bag it yourself,
and then you leave.
And if you go and try and steal anything,

544
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:51.300
there's going to be one of those big Robo cop look at things in the corner and

545
00:32:51.301 --> 00:32:53.130
it will fucking blow your brains out.

546
00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.760
And it will be justified because human life won't mean shit at that point

547
00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.450
because it's not going to be enough food or water left.
So you know,

548
00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:06.420
and no one's going to feel bad that you're dead.

549
00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.210
Even your own family at that point,
they're like,
good,

550
00:33:09.211 --> 00:33:13.830
well one less fucking grumbling stomach in the house.
Right.

551
00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.890
That's what I got out of that experience.
So then anyways,

552
00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:22.690
I go up to the fucking gym,
you know,

553
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.600
kills me.
There's a person at my gym and they have a pit bull and they,

554
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.400
they tie it up to the rail and they go in and they work out.

555
00:33:29.401 --> 00:33:32.340
And every time I come walking out and I look at that pit bull,

556
00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:35.610
it looks so fucking sad.

557
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.080
It's ECO walking.
I was just looking at you like,
are you my owner?

558
00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:46.920
Because I'm not enjoyed sitting hair feels so fucking bad for the thick.

559
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.190
It's unbelievable.
That contempt.
I have few humanity.

560
00:33:50.191 --> 00:33:52.770
You just give me one fucking,
I love dogs.

561
00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:59.120
They're the fucking,
I don't even mind cats and that costs,
you know what I mean?

562
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:01.550
But then I polluting rivers,
right?

563
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:05.570
Cats don't make me fucking scan my own shit and bag it.
Do they,

564
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.940
although they do shit in the house,
but you know that when you get them,

565
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:15.570
that's a great play right there.
You know something,
the guy,
you know the uh,
oh,

566
00:34:15.571 --> 00:34:16.760
I was calling Russell Peters,

567
00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:20.350
the rustle a Rabinow which said what the fuck's a quarterback first?

568
00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:21.900
I Dunno any but Russell Wilson,
right.

569
00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:24.810
Thank God he turned around so I can read it on his back and he fucking over

570
00:34:24.811 --> 00:34:28.290
through somebody and back in the day the guy was jumping up,

571
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.610
you know back in the day safety would come over and just fucking give the guy a

572
00:34:32.611 --> 00:34:37.170
nice fucking head shot and he pulled up.
He did hit him that that is a good tech.

573
00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.320
That is a good thing.
It hasn't been done for good reason.

574
00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.960
I mean they just did it because why?
They don't want to get fucking sued,

575
00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.780
you know?
You know I heard that will Smith concussion movie that a,

576
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:50.460
the NFL made him take a lot of shit out of it.
You probably like,

577
00:34:50.461 --> 00:34:53.210
what the fuck does NFL have to do with Hollywood?
Well,

578
00:34:53.211 --> 00:34:55.860
if you follow the family fucking tree of the corporations,

579
00:34:55.861 --> 00:35:00.861
I think it somehow ESPN is owned by ABC and they owned some movie fucking thing

580
00:35:02.021 --> 00:35:04.290
and the NFL is on ESPN.
They go,
Hey,

581
00:35:04.291 --> 00:35:08.140
can you take out all the shit that implicates us for looking the other way?

582
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:11.190
It just Disney fire just a little bit.

583
00:35:11.191 --> 00:35:15.210
Could you do that force or also go to another network and they were like,
yeah,

584
00:35:15.211 --> 00:35:19.810
sure,
absolutely,
absolutely touched dad.

585
00:35:19.811 --> 00:35:24.090
Seattle.
See that now?
That right there,

586
00:35:24.091 --> 00:35:27.930
it should scare people as much as those rams fans are fucking wave in at the

587
00:35:27.931 --> 00:35:28.980
Seattle fence.

588
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:34.820
You know we're going to go hold a fucking candle light village village for a

589
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.710
village.
Oh No.
What is the word?

590
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:43.010
A candle light.
It's not village.

591
00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:47.680
Do you know how many times I fucking heard that in my life and I've never said

592
00:35:47.681 --> 00:35:50.790
it out loud and I don't know how to say it.
Does this mean I'm dumber?

593
00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.180
It's just like happen to people.

594
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:53.733
<v 4>Okay.</v>

595
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.983
<v 1>Candlelight.</v>

596
00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:59.340
You know this is what I do now when I don't know something I'm going to write

597
00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:00.243
typing

598
00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:06.940
had I wrote hand head a vigil is what it is,

599
00:36:07.491 --> 00:36:11.120
right?
Fillage candle

600
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:16.680
light and it's coming up.
Dinner
vigil.

601
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:19.050
The fuck is a vigil.

602
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:25.540
It sounds like the name of a fucking old guy.
Vigil.
Get it here.

603
00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.101
A vigil,

604
00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:31.390
a period of keeping awake during the time usually spent asleep,

605
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:36.130
especially to keep watch a prey.
That's hilarious.

606
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.250
Anytime you light candles at night,
people call it a vigil.
It's like,
dude,

607
00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:44.200
well what?
When's your bedtime without right then it's not a virtual yet.

608
00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:47.980
You gotta you gotta fucking be here.
One in the morning,
two in the morning.

609
00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:51.580
All depends on what you're dealt.
You do coke.
Would you do coke tonight?

610
00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.670
All right,
well you got to be holding that candle still at seven in the morning.

611
00:36:57.130 --> 00:37:00.100
Um,
all right.
What are we doing here?
What are we doing here,
bill?

612
00:37:00.101 --> 00:37:02.410
We're fucking looking up words cause you were a dope.
All right,

613
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:07.090
well you know that happens.
It happens.
Fucking relax.

614
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.810
All Right,
Time Dad.
37 minutes and weekends.
We can read a few here.

615
00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:15.850
We can read a few.
Jesus,

616
00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.510
how fucking fucked up is that Terry Bradshaw's shingles commercial.

617
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:24.220
He just barged into people's houses and start showing them pictures of open

618
00:37:24.221 --> 00:37:29.200
source.
I have no idea what shingles is,
but he said,
do you eat chicken?

619
00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.510
And the person was like,
yeah,
he goes set out.

620
00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.330
They always scare the fuck out of you.
But then you look at Terry,

621
00:37:34.331 --> 00:37:38.470
he doesn't have any open source.
So you know,
he didn't get vaccinated,

622
00:37:38.471 --> 00:37:40.810
so I think he's just complaining that it hurt a lot.

623
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:43.560
Shit.

624
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.570
And I gotta look up shingles and you know they're going to take me to the roof

625
00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.030
shingles.
Shingles say,
oh my God.
You know,

626
00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:55.510
to only white people get shingles or do they only care about white people

627
00:37:55.511 --> 00:37:56.410
getting shingles?

628
00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:01.740
It's one or the other because all of the show in some just drawn white guy where

629
00:38:03.131 --> 00:38:08.131
it looks like somebody just an alien clawed his rib cage shingles,

630
00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:14.620
herpes zoster.
Oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus.

631
00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.740
The fuck part of the Internet.
Am I on?
You know,

632
00:38:17.741 --> 00:38:21.910
it's fucked up when when the first like 10 are all medical before you even get

633
00:38:21.911 --> 00:38:26.500
to Wiki.
Wiki is usually the first thing.
Like with vigil,
they don't give a fuck.

634
00:38:26.501 --> 00:38:30.670
Right.
All right,
you got to go to Wikipedia.
Take it to my level.

635
00:38:30.671 --> 00:38:35.360
Shingles also known as Zoster,
herpes zoster or Zoster,

636
00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:35.950
I don't know.

637
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:40.660
Or Zona is a viral disease characterized by a painful skin rash.

638
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.220
I'll toughen the fuck up.

639
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.120
Put some talcum powder on it with blisters involving a limited area.

640
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:53.820
Typically the rash occurs on either the left or the right of the body or face in

641
00:38:54.911 --> 00:38:59.380
a single stripe two to four days before the rash occurs.

642
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:02.320
They may be pain or tingling in the area.
Otherwise,

643
00:39:02.321 --> 00:39:03.880
there are typically few symptoms.

644
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:07.840
The rash usually heals within two to four weeks.
However,

645
00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:10.720
some people develop ongoing nerve pain,

646
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.540
which may last for months or years.

647
00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:18.040
A condition called posts therapy,
hectic,
neurologic,
Ludia.

648
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:21.640
In those with poor immune function,

649
00:39:21.641 --> 00:39:24.970
the rash may occur widely if the ration falls,

650
00:39:24.971 --> 00:39:29.860
The eye vision loss may occur.
Well,

651
00:39:29.861 --> 00:39:33.880
I got to tell you nothing and that told me to get a vaccine on roll the dice

652
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:38.620
gives a shit.
It's a great excuse to take three,
four weeks off of your life.

653
00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:43.090
I'd love to come in,
but I got shingles and then you know,

654
00:39:43.091 --> 00:39:46.480
they clear up in two weeks and two weeks later you're like,
Nah,
I still got them.

655
00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.610
Think I should be good next week.

656
00:39:48.611 --> 00:39:51.400
He'd just take a month off of the fuck would want to do that.

657
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.370
You get to act like a homeless person,
but you're inside,

658
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:59.740
which I think is probably the best kind of homelessness.
Right.
I'm sorry.

659
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.260
All right,
let's get to some questions here for the week.
Um,

660
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.120
all right,
hang on,
hang on,
hang on,
hang on.
You know,

661
00:40:07.121 --> 00:40:09.940
I never thought I'd like Miller Lincoln and they brought back this old school

662
00:40:09.941 --> 00:40:14.170
bottle and I keep them nice and cold and I don't know.
I like a pilsner.

663
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:18.970
Alright,
psychosis.
Um,
oh wait a minute.

664
00:40:18.971 --> 00:40:23.680
What the fuck am I doing?
This 17 seconds left.
Here comes an onside kick.

665
00:40:23.681 --> 00:40:27.370
Seattle is down by six points.
Alcoa present.

666
00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:32.350
It kicks the ball off and he kicked it out of bounds.
Ah,

667
00:40:32.351 --> 00:40:36.220
Jesus,
the headsets coming off.
I love when that is any better.

668
00:40:36.221 --> 00:40:38.890
When your coach takes the headset off,
it's fucking over.

669
00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:43.690
It takes it off with a smile on his face,
I should say.
All right,
here we go.

670
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:48.250
Psychos.
Hey belt.
You get a lot of emails with very specific situation.

671
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.640
A situation,
situation

672
00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.750
is ECC on the Sopranos.
All right.

673
00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.990
I'm not going to lay out every detail of what I'm dealing with,

674
00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:04.000
but I'd like to get some advice from you.
How do you deal with psychosis?

675
00:41:04.001 --> 00:41:08.830
Do you ignore them?
Do you engage and confront them?
A very general question.

676
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:09.281
I know,

677
00:41:09.281 --> 00:41:13.870
but let's say someone is talking shit and they're just a sociopath making shit

678
00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:17.380
up.
I ignored it,
but now the problem is getting bigger.

679
00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:21.280
I'm thinking about just blowing the whole thing up and confronting everyone

680
00:41:21.281 --> 00:41:24.520
involved.
Again,
I know I'm not giving you all the details,

681
00:41:24.521 --> 00:41:28.600
but the truth is it's just that simple and I don't want to bore your listeners

682
00:41:28.601 --> 00:41:30.610
with dramatic details.
Well Dude,

683
00:41:30.611 --> 00:41:34.940
the traumatic details is how I stretched the shit out for an hour.
Anyways,

684
00:41:34.941 --> 00:41:38.870
he goes,
I should mention,
I do have to see the psychos occasionally,

685
00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:43.610
so it's not like an out of sight out of mind thing.
Thanks,
love the new show.
Oh,

686
00:41:43.611 --> 00:41:44.444
thank you.

687
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:46.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

688
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:49.680
<v 1>All right,
so you know,
you're not talking about psychos on the train.</v>

689
00:41:49.681 --> 00:41:53.910
Psychos on the train.
You just ignore.
You know what I mean?
Until you can't,

690
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.040
they're coming at you.
Then you got to do it.

691
00:41:56.041 --> 00:41:58.050
The old front kick a little right there,
Fred.

692
00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.380
You always got to go with your feet with fucking psychos.

693
00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:06.090
Gotta go with your feet.
You don't want any open skin touching a psycho.

694
00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.860
You don't know what they got.
They bite,

695
00:42:07.861 --> 00:42:11.430
they scratch the fucking horrific you gave me.
All right there.
Fred,

696
00:42:11.431 --> 00:42:12.450
right to the fucking chest.

697
00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.970
Like that guy who fucking kick the guy in his leg broke.

698
00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:16.290
He used to come into the the,

699
00:42:16.291 --> 00:42:20.490
the octagon with like a fucking like a spider.

700
00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.780
The fuck was his name.
He's one of the legends of all time there.

701
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:28.560
I'm not disrespecting and right now I just don't watch enough of that UFC stuff.

702
00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:32.610
All I know is if I could steal any move for mixed martial arts,

703
00:42:32.611 --> 00:42:37.290
it would be his front kick.
We're a guy knows you.
He's in a fight with you.

704
00:42:37.291 --> 00:42:40.470
A professional fighter knows he's in a fight with you and yes,

705
00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.440
front kick is so God damn sly.

706
00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:48.060
It comes right up and underneath,
right between both his arms,

707
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:52.080
right under the person's job,
right day a Fred,
you're then you're on your back.

708
00:42:52.081 --> 00:42:52.950
It's fucking over.

709
00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.233
<v 0>MMM.</v>

710
00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:00.280
<v 1>Anyways.
Uh,
how do you deal with psychos?
All right.</v>

711
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:04.640
I you saying women are,
these men do ignore them.
Do you engage,

712
00:43:04.641 --> 00:43:06.380
confront that very general question.
I know,

713
00:43:06.381 --> 00:43:08.900
but let's say someone is talking shit and they just,

714
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:13.820
they're just a sociopath making shit up.
I,
I'm always a fan of walking away.

715
00:43:13.821 --> 00:43:16.610
If you could just walk up there,
just psychos,
just fucking walk away.

716
00:43:16.611 --> 00:43:18.230
But you got to see him every day.

717
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:19.813
<v 0>MMM.</v>

718
00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.610
<v 1>You know what dude,
you need to write back in next week.</v>

719
00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:24.550
<v 0>Okay.</v>

720
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:28.420
<v 1>And give me more details cause I got to see like what is your relationship to</v>

721
00:43:28.421 --> 00:43:29.254
them?

722
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:30.400
<v 0>Okay.</v>

723
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.700
<v 1>You know,
or is what they're saying.
So embarrassing.
You don't want to tell me.</v>

724
00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.510
You don't need to tell me what the fuck they're saying or doing.
Um,

725
00:43:37.511 --> 00:43:39.970
you said I do have to see the psychos occasionally.

726
00:43:39.971 --> 00:43:41.440
He got to see him occasionally.

727
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:43.290
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

728
00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.070
<v 1>Yeah.
I,
yeah,
I don't,
I don't.</v>

729
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

730
00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.110
<v 1>I Dunno.
I don't,
I don't know what to tell you,
dude.
This is so fucking vague.</v>

731
00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.000
Yeah.

732
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:50.360
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

733
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.720
<v 1>I have no idea.
I can tell you that if they're in your,
uh,</v>

734
00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:01.330
I dunno,
I'm a big,
you know,
cutting the head off the snake kind of thing.

735
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:03.820
And that doesn't mean you got to fucking confront somebody.
I mean,

736
00:44:03.821 --> 00:44:08.350
you just cut him out of your life.
It's just done.
You know what I mean?

737
00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:12.100
And sometimes that involves a conversation.
Sometimes it just evolves.
Just,

738
00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:17.660
just creating a new life somewhere else.
Go to a different bar,

739
00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.620
get an east sound young,
get another fucking job,
whatever the fuck it is,

740
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:26.210
just leave,
get on with your fucking life.
Gives a fuck.
Life's too short.

741
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.970
You know what I mean?
But you don't need to be getting involved in,
you know,

742
00:44:28.971 --> 00:44:33.540
screaming and yelling and that reality show stuff and oh no,
you didn't bitch.

743
00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:38.160
And then he fucking slap each other.
Whatever the fuck happens nowadays.
Um,

744
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.840
I wouldn't,
uh,
I wouldn't be involved in it.

745
00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:44.370
<v 4>Okay.</v>

746
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.760
<v 1>It,
I mean,
I'm just,
I don't know what the fuck to tell you though,</v>

747
00:44:46.761 --> 00:44:49.440
do you didn't get me off information.
I'm sorry.
I feel like I'm failing you here.

748
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.820
Uh,
so right in again next week and I'll do my best.
All right.
Okay.
No presence.

749
00:44:53.821 --> 00:44:58.530
So JJH dear bill,
love your work.
I know you will judge me and hate me,

750
00:44:58.531 --> 00:45:03.310
but hear me out.
Uh,
I been with my boyfriend for more than a year.
We're,

751
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:07.920
we're both young.
Uh,
women.
There's such geniuses.

752
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.290
You know what I mean?
Like she already has me going like,
no,

753
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:14.310
I won't judge you all.
I mean,
hurry the fuck you going to say,
you know,

754
00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:16.140
did their brilliant.

755
00:45:16.141 --> 00:45:20.240
She just fucking write down that star Trek Shit that where they put the worm and

756
00:45:20.241 --> 00:45:24.810
the guys how much she used.
She's already,
she's in my brain.
All right.

757
00:45:24.811 --> 00:45:27.510
We are both young but from completely different backgrounds.

758
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:32.540
I am a European from a middle class family while his family is loaded and their

759
00:45:32.791 --> 00:45:36.990
culture is generally very generous.
Don't get me wrong.

760
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.830
I make my own living and can afford anything I want.
We love each other crazily,

761
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:45.330
I travel all the time and get them presence on a weekly basis.
Perfumes,

762
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.770
perfumes.
All right,
I'm going to say that's a language barrier thing.
Colognes,

763
00:45:49.771 --> 00:45:52.650
you mean shoes,
clothes,
you name it.
Uh,

764
00:45:52.651 --> 00:45:56.640
I love making my loved ones happy and never expect anything.

765
00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.920
I pulled my wallet out for every single dinner and we always pay half if we stay

766
00:46:01.921 --> 00:46:04.590
in a hotel or travel.
How you're all aces so far.

767
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:09.420
Why am I going to judge you or hate you?
Gee,

768
00:46:09.421 --> 00:46:13.850
what's going to happen in the second half here?
Um,

769
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:18.540
lightly,
lightly.
Uh,
it was our anniversary.

770
00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:22.650
I got him a nice present,
but he didn't get,
he didn't even give me a flower.

771
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:27.480
Said,
I'm so sorry.
I'll make it up tomorrow.
Uh,

772
00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:32.100
she goes on the kind of person who always says,
no,
come on.
I don't need anything.

773
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:36.870
Uh,
for Christmas,
I invited his family and friends,
cooked an amazing dinner at,

774
00:46:36.871 --> 00:46:40.410
gave every single one of them presence.
Didn't get a thing

775
00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:42.930
from him too.

776
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:48.600
I live far away from where I'm from and he's the only one I have.

777
00:46:48.601 --> 00:46:53.060
So I felt like a kid who had been bad the whole year and woke up the next day to

778
00:46:53.061 --> 00:46:55.620
a Christmas tree was called,
oh,
he didn't even get you anything.

779
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:58.530
I tried my best to stay positive.

780
00:46:58.531 --> 00:47:02.130
At the end of the day I can go and get myself any stupid stuff I want.

781
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.110
It's really not about things.

782
00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:08.280
I've never felt so bad about myself and I'm really,

783
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:15.930
am I really so shallow to cry about a stupid President present?
But I promise,

784
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:23.050
but I promise it would make me so happy to know that he found the time to pass

785
00:47:23.541 --> 00:47:28.270
by a shop and get me a lip gloss or whatever.
All right.

786
00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.930
Um,
no.
Who doesn't appreciate Nice stuff?

787
00:47:31.931 --> 00:47:35.170
I constantly give gifts to family members.
We were all in a great location.
Okay.

788
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:38.320
You've said this a zillion times.
I would love to hear your opinion about it.

789
00:47:38.321 --> 00:47:41.080
I know this makes me sound like a materialistic can not,
if you went,

790
00:47:41.081 --> 00:47:45.790
you made a dinner and bought them all this other stuff that Jesus Christ,

791
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.080
but I wanted to keep the email minimal.
You didn't keep it minimal.

792
00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.290
And I like how you keep going.
The,
Hey,
I'm just,
you know,
I'm just,

793
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.740
this might be your problem.
I know you're going to hate me,

794
00:47:56.741 --> 00:47:59.560
but I know I don't know what you're doing here.

795
00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.780
I don't want you to think I'm blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
You almost see you.

796
00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:07.520
I think you need a little more self esteem unless this is your own way of,
uh,

797
00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:11.820
get me to say what you want.
Anyways,
he said,

798
00:48:11.821 --> 00:48:15.660
he saw me sat and asked what was wrong and I couldn't hold it anymore.
I said,

799
00:48:15.661 --> 00:48:19.170
it was Christmas time and it did not get a single gift from anyone in this
world.

800
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.100
Uh,
try not to sound like I'm blaming him.
I said,

801
00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:27.430
my parents or brothers or whatever,
he said,
I should be grateful for what I have.

802
00:48:27.431 --> 00:48:28.264
It's Cetera.

803
00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:32.880
I cried and apologized and said how bad I've made them feel.

804
00:48:32.881 --> 00:48:37.170
But you got him something too.
But I have a feeling nothing will change.

805
00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:38.671
When I was little,

806
00:48:38.671 --> 00:48:42.750
I would save for months to get my family something he never experienced anything

807
00:48:42.751 --> 00:48:46.110
like that.
He has everything you could possibly imagine,
I guess presence,

808
00:48:46.111 --> 00:48:50.190
our norm,
receiving them,
not giving them,
oh,
I don't know.

809
00:48:50.191 --> 00:48:53.430
I really wished to get the answers.
Am I dumb shell a person.

810
00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:57.120
I don't want to stop giving him presence for the essential occasions,

811
00:48:57.121 --> 00:49:00.270
even if he never gives me a thin thank you for everything.
Happy New Year.

812
00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:02.580
If this email is even remotely true,

813
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.120
that guy's a fucking sociopath and you can do way better.

814
00:49:06.121 --> 00:49:09.440
I don't give a fuck how much money as if that's remotely true.

815
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:12.043
<v 4>Okay.</v>

816
00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:17.100
<v 1>I find it hard to believe that his family came over.
You cooked him a dinner,</v>

817
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:20.700
you got all of them gifts and they didn't get you anything.

818
00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:22.423
<v 4>Okay.</v>

819
00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:24.120
<v 1>Um,</v>

820
00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.710
if that is true and he's rich and you're from a lower class,

821
00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.710
I'm starting to thank the family doesn't think you're good enough for them.

822
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:35.790
They wanted to make a statement and maybe they don't even need to.

823
00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:39.420
The fact that he didn't get you anything.
Maybe he's just banging you

824
00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.780
Barlow.
It's kind of weird.

825
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.740
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

826
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.470
<v 1>To spend a,</v>

827
00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:48.050
<v 4>okay.</v>

828
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:52.730
<v 1>The holidays with some checky just bagging.
I don't know.
If something's a,</v>

829
00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:55.190
something's not right,
then you're not happy.

830
00:49:55.191 --> 00:49:57.280
You're not getting what you want and he doesn't see,
you know,

831
00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:01.640
he seemed like he was a cunt about it.
So I would say,
uh,

832
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:05.390
2016 move on to something else.

833
00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:07.860
<v 4>Okay.</v>

834
00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.150
<v 1>That's what I would say.
You know,</v>

835
00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:14.010
unless he really just has fuck you money and then you got to do what he's going

836
00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:18.980
to do eventually is have a mistress on the side,
a monstrous,
you know,

837
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.350
<v 4>yeah.</v>

838
00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:23.620
<v 1>Start fucking the God.
No,
uh,
yeah.
We'll get rid of the guy.</v>

839
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:28.190
If what you're saying is even remotely,
it's such a one sided fucking story.

840
00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:34.100
I find it hard to believe that anybody could be that fucking cold are oblivious

841
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:36.530
and that's coming from me who's was a fucking dope.

842
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:40.250
But if that is even remotely true,
yeah,
I would just get out of the relationship.

843
00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.380
It's great.
You're not married,
you don't have any kids.
It's simple.

844
00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.890
It's a conversation,
you know,

845
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:50.540
nowadays it could be a text message dear so and so and not feeling it.

846
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.940
Take it easy.
Send

847
00:50:56.390 --> 00:51:00.890
and you change your number or just,
yeah,
it's,
yeah,
it's
all right.

848
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:04.340
Local sports.
Talk a dear Billy Cosell.

849
00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.780
I'm listening to some old podcasts and hearing you justifiably bitch about

850
00:51:08.781 --> 00:51:13.010
sports talk radio in sports commentating,
uh,
has uh,

851
00:51:13.011 --> 00:51:14.360
has become really comforting.

852
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:18.680
I thought maybe I was becoming a miserable grump in his thirties,
but I'm not,

853
00:51:18.681 --> 00:51:22.940
I live in Houston and like any other city with a sports presence.

854
00:51:22.941 --> 00:51:27.440
I'm tired of all of all of what I call sports drama.

855
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:28.790
I'm a little younger than you,

856
00:51:28.791 --> 00:51:32.540
but I remember the days when the game was all was all people talked about the

857
00:51:32.541 --> 00:51:35.290
actual game,
not just the pointless what ifs,

858
00:51:35.291 --> 00:51:38.510
the consume every program and conversation next time you,

859
00:51:38.511 --> 00:51:40.460
are any of your listeners listen to any of that,

860
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:45.380
follow up each comment with these questions.
Did they say anything?

861
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:50.930
Does this provide any insight beyond that of some jackass at a bar?

862
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:54.560
Is this what my grandfather fought for during the Big One?

863
00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:58.640
I'm not completely pessimistic though.

864
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.480
I think there are some great analysis analysis out there and people who stay

865
00:52:02.481 --> 00:52:05.900
focused.
I try and only listen to people who aren't trying to create a name for

866
00:52:05.901 --> 00:52:09.530
themselves through loud mouth comments and wild claims just to gain attention.

867
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.830
I still like listen to people talk about sports in some respect,

868
00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:18.380
a rant inspired boy in some respect.

869
00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.570
Rent inspired me to look for something else.

870
00:52:20.571 --> 00:52:24.350
So I found a local podcast called Houston sports talk.

871
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:26.540
I think you've edited out some words there.

872
00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:29.150
I read every word of that sentence and it made no sense to me,

873
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.080
but I think you're,

874
00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:35.060
you're listening to a new podcast and Houston called Houston sports talk
anyways.

875
00:52:35.061 --> 00:52:36.800
Plain and simple.
It's been a lifesaver.

876
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:39.560
Thanks for making me feel better about my position on this subject.

877
00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:44.510
Love F is for family.
Oh,
thank you.
Yeah,
you gotta be uh,
you know,

878
00:52:44.511 --> 00:52:46.010
as much as I make fun at Espn,

879
00:52:46.011 --> 00:52:49.370
you got to have some empathy where they're trying to fill up 24 hours a day and

880
00:52:49.371 --> 00:52:52.190
a lot of times there just simply isn't enough to do it,

881
00:52:52.191 --> 00:52:55.880
which is probably one of the main reasons why the Tom Brady fucking thing went

882
00:52:55.881 --> 00:53:00.590
right through baseball season.
Um,
there was just no other scandals going on.

883
00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:05.540
Air quotes,
scandals.
Um,
so that's what they do.

884
00:53:05.541 --> 00:53:07.630
I just,
I can't sit there and watch it.

885
00:53:07.631 --> 00:53:11.900
Like right now the game is over and I'm watching some guy,
Dan Quinn,

886
00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.050
uh,
you know,

887
00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:19.730
giving out game balls and people clapping in all different states of dress link.

888
00:53:19.731 --> 00:53:23.150
What,
why do I need to see this?
I don't give a shit.
I know the Falcons won.

889
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.690
I just want to see the highlights.
I want to see some guy in a jock strap.

890
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.180
I don't,
I don't need to see that.
You know,

891
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:33.220
<v 8>I write down there was a huge win for the falcons.</v>

892
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:35.610
A little it of the national football league,

893
00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:39.150
<v 1>but was it too little,
too late?
And we were,</v>

894
00:53:39.151 --> 00:53:43.870
so there's the couches Jessie on the chopping block.
What's next for,

895
00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:47.110
for Matty ice.
Does he stay in a letter?

896
00:53:47.111 --> 00:53:51.670
Is he going to re up or is he going to look for greener pasture?
Um,

897
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:56.200
all right.
Dating someone with zero ambition,

898
00:53:56.890 --> 00:54:01.000
a Billy Dick Fingers.
I don't even know what the fuck that means,

899
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:06.340
but I like it.
I got to tell you,
I like it.
A Billy Dick Fingers.

900
00:54:06.341 --> 00:54:07.850
I recently staff

901
00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:13.750
listening to your podcasts and you've got me hooked.
Always loved to stand up.

902
00:54:13.751 --> 00:54:18.340
And when I found out you have a podcast,
shit was like a gift from God.
Ah,

903
00:54:18.341 --> 00:54:21.800
aren't you a sweetheart?
Um,
anyways.
Anyway,

904
00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:26.260
I had been dating this lady for almost three years now.

905
00:54:26.261 --> 00:54:29.350
Things are going well,
but I'm starting to get a little concerned about her.

906
00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:33.670
She started hanging around some people who I feel are a bad influence to her.

907
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:38.170
They drink and she lets them drive her drunk.
Oh God,
that's not good.

908
00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:43.420
And all they do is smoke pot and Dick around.
Now I like when my girl,

909
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:47.290
uh,
can get out of the house and go out,
have fun with the friends,

910
00:54:47.291 --> 00:54:51.220
but it starting to influence a personality.
And whenever I tried to call her out,

911
00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:56.020
she says bullshit.
Like,
okay mom,
or let me live my life.

912
00:54:56.350 --> 00:55:01.090
I recently been getting my creative slash ambitious crunch on and then working

913
00:55:01.091 --> 00:55:04.120
on big things,
turning my hobby of music into a profession.

914
00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:09.160
I'm trying to come up successfully in life and found myself at a critical point

915
00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:12.220
where I need to cut all the negative people out of my life.
Dude,

916
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:15.400
you got your fucking head screwed on straight.

917
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:21.520
Exactly.
You're doing shit,
she's not doing shit right.

918
00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.080
This goes to the same way,
the other way around.
If you,

919
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:26.950
if you're a woman and you got your shit together and you're with somebody does

920
00:55:26.951 --> 00:55:29.440
not have their shit together,
you should be looking at,
you know,

921
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:34.090
and you fired some warning shots and they're like,
okay mom,
whatever.

922
00:55:34.091 --> 00:55:37.570
It's just like I dude,
alright,
go live that life.

923
00:55:37.571 --> 00:55:41.050
But those fucking people will drag you down with them.

924
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:46.790
All right,
God damn anchor around your neck.
So anyways,
content,

925
00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.910
I love this email so far.
Um,

926
00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:54.220
right now her lack of ambition in need to sit around all day and smoke pot has

927
00:55:54.221 --> 00:55:57.280
kind of soul crushing and disappointing.
I really love this girl,

928
00:55:57.281 --> 00:56:01.150
but I'm afraid I'll lose her to the shithead friends and she'll become a

929
00:56:01.151 --> 00:56:02.410
completely different person.

930
00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:06.340
How do I try and help her get her shit together without seeming like a

931
00:56:06.341 --> 00:56:09.100
controlling Douche?
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
Well,

932
00:56:09.101 --> 00:56:12.280
I would memorize your last three sentences and I would just say it to her in a

933
00:56:12.281 --> 00:56:16.150
nice way.
Just say,
listen,
I'll paraphrase what you wrote.
I really love you,

934
00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:21.220
but I'm afraid that I'm going to lose you.
And I had the shit had friends.

935
00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:24.430
All right?
I can't do it.
When you listen,
you just set it down.
Just say,
listen,

936
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:29.320
I need to talk to you.
All right?
Put down the bond focus.

937
00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:34.210
All right.
You know,
I love you,
but I gotta tell you,

938
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:37.990
I've been concerned with the people that she'd been hanging around with lately

939
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:43.000
and I'm really feeling like it's starting to some,
let me finish.
Let me finish.

940
00:56:43.001 --> 00:56:46.480
You don't have to agree with me.
I feel like it's an influencing your behavior.

941
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:49.450
Before you hung out with these people,
you are doing x,
Y,
and z.

942
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:53.770
Now you just kind of sit around the house smoking pot all day in it's soul

943
00:56:53.771 --> 00:56:55.690
crushing to me,
okay?

944
00:56:55.691 --> 00:56:59.230
It doesn't motivate me and I love you and to see you sitting there doing nothing

945
00:56:59.231 --> 00:57:02.500
with your life is killing me,
all right?

946
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:07.930
I need you to turn it around.
Okay?

947
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.530
And this is not a little thing.
This is a major crossroads.

948
00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:15.010
I can't say that this just say,
I need you to turn.

949
00:57:15.011 --> 00:57:17.650
I need you to do something about it and then this is the deal.

950
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:21.460
Either she does or she doesn't and if she doesn't,

951
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:24.970
you fucking walk cause I don't give a fuck how much you love this woman.

952
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:28.930
You're going to end up resenting resenting her and hating her because she's

953
00:57:28.931 --> 00:57:31.690
going to take you down with her.
That's it.

954
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:37.660
That's the mom that some other year kids sitting around fucking,
you know,

955
00:57:37.661 --> 00:57:42.160
smelling like Bong water,
watching Bravo TV all fucking day.

956
00:57:42.161 --> 00:57:46.870
The he can't have,
you can't have it.
You can't have it.
It's it.
All right.

957
00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:50.940
This is what you'd take her out back like fucking like Pauly Paul.

958
00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:55.090
He talked to Henry Health about drugs.
Stay away from that shit.

959
00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:59.500
I'm not saying slap her in the face after you say it.
You know,

960
00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.410
just sit there as you're cooking something.
Stay away from that shit.
All right?

961
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.290
I don't want that shit in my life.
That's not going to happen to me.
All right.

962
00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:09.250
I've got a friend of mine,
he's got a wife,
was a total fucking pothead.
Okay?

963
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.070
He's only making 30 grand a year.
That guy was on his way to being an executive,

964
00:58:12.071 --> 00:58:13.240
right?
That ain't happened for me.

965
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:17.510
He's going to die in that cubicle if that didn't happen,
and to me,
don't you,
you.

966
00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:21.820
You're doing exactly what you need to do here and you questioning the right

967
00:58:21.821 --> 00:58:22.720
thing and I'm gonna tell you something,

968
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:26.380
you're going to be successful in life because not only did you recognize this

969
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:29.470
and the person that you're with,
despite the fact that you love him,
all right?

970
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:34.260
You motivated yourself and you understand already to get negative people out of

971
00:58:34.261 --> 00:58:36.730
your life to it.
You got to fucking do it.
Okay?
This is,

972
00:58:36.731 --> 00:58:41.440
this is a onetime conversation.
All right?
That's it.

973
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:47.380
Get your shit together.
You say it nicely.
All right.
If you don't see,

974
00:58:47.381 --> 00:58:51.490
you don't see him turning around.
That's it.
That's it.

975
00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:53.200
Fuck that dude.

976
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:58.360
There's so many fucking great motivated people out there that you could be with,

977
00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.930
okay?
You don't,
you don't need to shift the fucking [inaudible].

978
00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:03.490
You were already a parent.
You don't even apparent yet.

979
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:07.360
You've got a big fucking babysit in there that's on drugs.

980
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:12.040
The worst kind of a baby and an adult.
One on drugs.
Oh,

981
00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:16.240
he got me heated here.
Sorry.
All right.
That's the podcast.
Um,

982
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:19.150
I'll talk to you guys on a Thursday,
which I believe is New Year's.

983
00:59:19.151 --> 00:59:22.910
Is that New Year's Day?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What's Today's date?

984
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:27.020
That's set it earlier,
right?
Monday the 28th,

985
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:31.220
29 30 31.
I'll do one.

986
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:32.990
I'll do one and maybe I'll have Paul Versey.

987
00:59:32.991 --> 00:59:35.750
He's going to be in town because we're going to be at the,
uh,

988
00:59:35.751 --> 00:59:40.070
the Orpheum in downtown La.
The two wonderful shows everybody,
um,

989
00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:44.870
to end this amazing fucking year that I had every year just keeps getting

990
00:59:44.871 --> 00:59:47.570
better.
And uh,
this year was no different.

991
00:59:47.571 --> 00:59:49.070
I want to thank everybody who's been watching.

992
00:59:49.071 --> 00:59:52.400
F is for family and tweeting about it and Facebook and doing all the social

993
00:59:52.401 --> 00:59:56.000
media.
Uh,
oh wait a minute.
Look at this.

994
00:59:56.001 --> 00:59:57.470
Manning under fire.

995
00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:02.680
It's made the local El de la knows what a fucking travesty.

996
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.100
If anybody has never done roids.
It's Peyton manning.

997
01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:11.660
He's had a dad body his entire fucking career.
Leave the guy alone.

998
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:15.770
Evie did a cycle.
Just to get back out there.
It's because he loved the game.

999
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:19.700
It gives a fuck.
Ah.
Anyways,

1000
01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:23.660
that's coming from a patriots fan too.
I love the Guy,
you know?
Fuck it.
You know,

1001
01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.850
I've given a lot of shit over the years,
but he was a rival.

1002
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:29.330
What do you want from me?
All right.
Anyways,

1003
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.320
that I want to thank everybody wants it again for a telling people about it,

1004
01:00:33.321 --> 01:00:37.590
for watching it,
for rewatching it.
Please keep spreading the word.
Um,

1005
01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.040
that's the best hope we have for getting a second season.

1006
01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:44.570
Netflix has a ton of content and a finite amount of money.
So,

1007
01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:45.380
uh,

1008
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:48.050
just because we're doing well doesn't mean we're going to get a second season.

1009
01:00:48.051 --> 01:00:52.610
So please help spread the word and a,
and that is it.
That is it.

1010
01:00:52.611 --> 01:00:57.380
That is all I will talk to you on Thursday.
All right.
And I'll check it on you.

1011
01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:58.340
All right.
See you.
