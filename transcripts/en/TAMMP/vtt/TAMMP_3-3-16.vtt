00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.090

Just before Friday.

3
00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:09.230
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.363
<v 1>Ah,</v>

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.220
<v 0>just checking in on you.
How come I can't fucking hear myself?</v>

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.670
What do I get to plug this in right here.
Can I hear myself?
There we go.

7
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:21.690
Now it can hear myself.
You know,
can't hear myself.

8
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.700
Psycho.
I was talking with about,

9
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:27.570
with Dean del Ray last night outside of the comedy store.

10
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.400
He was talking to me about how,
you know,

11
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.210
you don't like when singers get old.
They can't,
you know,

12
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.430
they can't sing the way they used to.
Right.
Jason's,

13
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.140
this is going to be a long way.
You know,

14
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:46.080
like I was watching Christopher Cross last night,
you know,
my wife,

15
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.210
I came home and Neil was crank and you know,
say

16
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.460
<v 1>no.
The boat,</v>

17
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.660
whatever the fuck he says his that ran rant.
I do win.

18
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.640
All right man.
I do.
We'll get it right.
Listen to that shit goes,

19
00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:07.900
look off such a lower to go listen to that shit.

20
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.270
<v 0>So she was sitting there talking,
a fuck it,</v>

21
00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:15.610
I'll just keep going on this thing and I'll get back to dean in a minute.

22
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.510
She kept talking about,
she goes,
what kind of like fucking music is this?

23
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.140
She's like,
is this like soda of uh,
you know,
she was saying it was sorta disco.

24
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.270
He,
I'm like,
there really isn't,
it's sort of post disco.
What'd you call that?

25
00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:33.080
Adult contemporary,
you know,
Kusa raw nuts

26
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.310
<v 1>cause I like to wear and then it goes on such a low where to go</v>

27
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.310
<v 0>and they always have like the fucking,
like really like,
uh,</v>

28
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.810
like to session musicians say like so good.
It's,

29
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.620
it just doesn't sound like it's even alive.
I,
you know,
it's weird.

30
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.750
I liked the music,
but just some of the shit,

31
00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:57.010
like the drummer was amazing on those fucking,
it's just too slick,

32
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.240
you know?
I Dunno what the fuck it is.
But anyways,
I was talking to Dean and um,

33
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.920
we were talking about,
I hate when people like bitch,

34
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:07.920
when a singer gets old and then he can't sing the way used to.

35
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.910
And it's just like,
well,
yeah,
because back in the day they used to sing.
Yeah.

36
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.310
Like Robert Plant gets a ton of shit.
It's like,
dude,

37
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:18.750
you go sing the fucking immigrant song every night for fucking a two year tour.

38
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.740
You're just,
you're done.
Right?
If you watch,

39
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.400
somebody might not saying he can't sing now,
but I mean,

40
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.690
what do you want from the guy?
He's out there drinking booze,

41
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:31.290
he smoking cigarettes and he's fucking singing every goddamn night as opposed to

42
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:35.670
these modern day people who learn from the other guys the same way.

43
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.150
No drummer drives a Rolls Royce into a swimming pool anymore.
Right.

44
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.380
Did I almost say swimming pool?
Swimming Pool.
Right.

45
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:47.730
Nobody drowns in their own vomit anymore.
It happens every once in a while.

46
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:52.560
It fucking happens.
But you know,
you'll learn.
It's like when I came in,
um,

47
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.430
when I came into this business,

48
00:02:55.431 --> 00:03:00.340
I saw a bunch of comics from the 80s that didn't pay and,
and fucking

49
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.900
<v 2>senate all up their nose and they had their wages garnished and it was like they</v>

50
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:08.410
were on punishment for like 10 years.
So my,

51
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.810
my wave of comics,
you know,

52
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:13.810
stayed away from the blow and the booze and that type of shit.

53
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.220
And then what was funny,

54
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:19.720
I got about 15 years end of this shit and I noticed that people started partying

55
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:22.900
again.
You know,
just cause I,

56
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.330
they probably looked at us like we were sitting there like we were part of the

57
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:26.420
Osman family,
you know.

58
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.650
So then another thing that they say is all wowed.
You see so and so man,

59
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:36.910
he got old.
Oh Wow.
She got old.
And that always bugs me.
So say,
well,
what the,

60
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:41.120
what the fuck happened to you?
You're not losing your looks.
Oh,
look at that.

61
00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:44.500
You say that enough.
And now look at all these fucking celebrity.

62
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:48.040
So walking around,
they get in their fucking lips inflated.

63
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.790
They get net that Goddamn Botox,
you know,

64
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.080
inject it in their face so they can be like laminated to have that nice shiny

65
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:59.800
face
because nothing says youth,

66
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.220
like a shiny unmoving face.
Right.
I Dunno.

67
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.710
I Dunno how the hell I got into that.
Um,
I am going to go see a,
a,

68
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.950
I'm going to go to a rock concert tomorrow night.
I'm going to UNMUTE,

69
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.110
I don't even know what the kids call them nowadays.
Um,

70
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.110
I'm going to go see mute mass tomorrow night.
Very excited about that.
Um,

71
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.060
it makes me feel like I'm somewhat not an old guy to be going to this thing.

72
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.280
And a,
I'm so old,

73
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:28.890
I can't even like classify what their music is because,
uh,
I had,

74
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.080
I was hanging with a dean last night,
a couple of other people,

75
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.120
a couple of other oldies like myself.

76
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:38.620
We were all just coming to the realization that rock music is dead.
It's just,

77
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.560
it's dead and there's nothing we could do and it's,
it,
you know,

78
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:43.900
it's not coming back.
And if somebody tries to bring it back,

79
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:48.520
there'll be considered retro.
Right.
Am I out of my fucking mind?
But it sits over.

80
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.120
So last time you saw somebody playing a guitar,

81
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.300
<v 3>okay.</v>

82
00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.100
<v 2>I don't mean some Flamenco fucking shit or doing your acoustic version of a,</v>

83
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:03.850
of a rap song.
I don't fucking mean that.
I mean like just somebody,
uh,

84
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.300
I dunno.
I know there's a lot of people scratching their heads going,
well,

85
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:10.720
what about all that death metal and all that shit?
I of course I'm,
I'm not,

86
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:13.690
I'm not talking about that.
I'm not talking about any,
anything.

87
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.330
I'm just talking about,
basically,

88
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:21.331
I'm just an old man wondering where the hair metal went 30 years after it died.

89
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:26.110
36 years,
maybe after it fucking died.
I'm just an old man rambling on a podcast.

90
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.250
Don't judge me.
Huh?
What about you?

91
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.230
What do you do right now?
You sit in a traffic,
right?
You're a little fucking car.

92
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.220
Drive over a puddle and the fucking water comes up through the floor boards.

93
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:41.950
You're judging me.
You think I haven't been there.

94
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.890
I'm fucking with you.
Um,
so last night to show is a Dean del Ray.

95
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.750
Just a sick fucking show.
I'm Dave Attell popped in who once again,

96
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:54.910
every time I see that guy performed,
stand up,
it's just,

97
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:59.660
I talked to Bart Nick and I was like,
is he ever not going to be the best?
Um,

98
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.750
and there's no way for me to say what he says or I'll say burn his jokes,

99
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:06.440
but he was just like,
he's one of those guys that he has me dying,

100
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:08.330
laughing and half to half is set.

101
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:12.440
I mean the dying laughing or I'm just standing there just,
just watching.

102
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:16.700
I'm just shaking my head like,
how the fuck do you come up with that stuff?
Um,

103
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.980
so one of,
I guess what I'm saying here is,
um,

104
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.770
I like Christopher Cross and if you have a chance,
go see David.
Tell,

105
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.060
I think that that was the purpose of the first six minutes,
right?

106
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.850
Is that what it is?
I'm not Jesus Christ.
Oh Geez.

107
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:36.320
I didn't tell you this man.
Like
I was traveling a lot and I was,

108
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.330
I was eating really poorly by last trip there,
uh,
when I was in a Foxwoods,

109
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.120
right.
Got To town early,
visited,
visited a friend of mine,

110
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.170
the one fortunate it was in the hospital but is now out.
And,
um,

111
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.510
you know,
so I was eating like shit that day and then I fucking,
uh,

112
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.620
went up to fox woods and I ordered room service and I lied to myself that I was

113
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:01.970
going to work out it on Sunday when I could have worked out.

114
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:05.180
I went to the Yukon game with Versie Versie hooked me up with the ticket,

115
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.470
the gentleman that he is,
and I went there and I like shit.

116
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.350
So,
uh,
you know,

117
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.470
you combine eating like shit and then getting on a plane for six hours and not

118
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:21.170
drinking enough water and then all of a sudden,
you know,

119
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.080
the train's not coming out of the station.

120
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.200
So,
you know,
one day the train doesn't come and it's like,

121
00:07:34.201 --> 00:07:36.620
God,
maybe it'll come the next day.
It doesn't come the next day.

122
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.170
And then the third day,
uh,
you know,
I'm like,
what the fuck?

123
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.380
Trey never comes again.
Then the,
uh,
the station dice.
So,

124
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:49.220
uh,
I start thinking,
I gotta go to fucking,
you know,

125
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:51.140
I got to go to a pharmacy.

126
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.660
You get a stool soft,
no,
right.
All that shit.

127
00:07:56.661 --> 00:08:00.530
But then I just got all paranoid and I was just like,
you know something,

128
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.590
the thing about the corporations is that they don't want to just get you,

129
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.310
they want to get you hooked and they want to have you keep coming back.
So I got,

130
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:12.830
I really started thinking about it going like,
well wait a minute.

131
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.840
If I go down and I take this stuff,
they'll probably be something in there,

132
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:23.120
in the little pill that tells my digestive track to just stand down.

133
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.440
Yeah,
we don't need you anymore.
Don't worry.
We got it all right.
Daddy's home.

134
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:28.880
He's going to take care of everything.

135
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.360
And then I'm going to become hooked on these fucking pills and I'm going to be

136
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:33.650
one of those guys.
You see,

137
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.590
having to eat blueberries every morning for fucking breakfast,

138
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:40.560
trying to turn his system around,
not realizing that he's fucking himself.
Fuck.

139
00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:43.250
Cause he went fucking himself over it because he,
uh,

140
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.940
he's eating them fucking pills every day where he's going and getting them

141
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:51.590
fucking pills.
Right?
So,
oh,

142
00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:53.060
freckle juice,
his brain.
And it's like,

143
00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:55.780
there's no way that Julius Caesar never had a problem.

144
00:08:55.781 --> 00:08:59.590
Taking a shit and I know that there was no cvs pharmacy for him to go to,

145
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.690
so I just looked up natural,

146
00:09:01.691 --> 00:09:05.180
a natural cures in a woo.

147
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.980
I found one that worked for all freckles.
I know this is gross,

148
00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:11.140
but it's a really important thing.
I went out,
okay,

149
00:09:11.141 --> 00:09:15.130
it's a teaspoon of olive oil and then you squeeze some lemon in it.

150
00:09:15.131 --> 00:09:18.130
You do it with the on an empty stomach and you're fucking,

151
00:09:18.131 --> 00:09:21.070
you know you do a shot of it in the morning.

152
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.880
And the only thing I can compare it to as far as how well it worked,

153
00:09:24.881 --> 00:09:29.260
you guys ever watch gas monkey garage and they get some old fucking car and they

154
00:09:29.261 --> 00:09:32.500
haven't turned over the engine in a while.
All right,
so what do they do?

155
00:09:32.501 --> 00:09:34.840
They take off the fucking the air filter housing,

156
00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:38.200
all that shit and they got that shit.
They sprayed to the carburetor,

157
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.890
the opened the butterfly and they have it wide open and they go,

158
00:09:41.891 --> 00:09:44.760
I give it a shot and the guy turns it over you.
The fucking thanks.

159
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:48.310
Starts showing up.
That's basically what I did.
You know,

160
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.670
teaspoon of olive oil and some lemon.

161
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.320
Can you do a shot of that on an empty stomach?
I mean,
you fucking own good.

162
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.710
You're all good.
You're on fucking grease rails for the rest of the day.

163
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.270
I stand by it.
I'm Bill Barr and I fucking,
uh,

164
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:11.860
I stand by this and I approve of this message.
Oh my God.

165
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.300
Just what nobody wanted.
Or at least I didn't want.

166
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.300
It's down to Hillary and Donald fucking Trump.

167
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.230
Unfucking believable.
How to,
how did we get here?

168
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.060
You know what?
Cause we

169
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.640
unbelievable.
No who do fucking,

170
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.650
both of those are going to be my two choices.
I'm not doing it.

171
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:39.460
You know what I mean?

172
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.300
Even though I didn't agree with everything that Bernie Sanders wanted to do,
uh,

173
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:49.410
I have to vote for a guy that went outside the usual fucking places to get his

174
00:10:49.601 --> 00:10:53.320
money for his campaign.
Just to fucking encourage somebody else to do that.

175
00:10:53.321 --> 00:10:56.200
And I really can't stand when people say that that's a waste of a vote.

176
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.140
I don't think it is because I think each time,
each election,

177
00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:04.170
a guy like that gets a little bit farther and I actually think it's great that,

178
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.680
uh,
that the Democrats and Republicans,

179
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:13.480
the best that they could come up with at this point is Hillary Clinton and

180
00:11:13.481 --> 00:11:17.660
fucking Donald Trump.
I mean,
Jesus,
all the juice.
This is fucking

181
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:19.980
<v 4>okay.</v>

182
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.600
<v 2>I don't really think there's a lesser of two evil here.
I just,
I just,
it's,</v>

183
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.720
you have it sitting on the last row of a plane,
you know,

184
00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:32.470
and they're serving the breakfast and they're just like,
all right,

185
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.060
your choices today.
All right,

186
00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:40.010
ham and cheese omelet or a bucket is shit with Granola,
right?

187
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.070
Yeah.
Like,
ah,
fuck it.
Then they go and you're like,
oh,
fuck it.

188
00:11:43.071 --> 00:11:45.740
I'm going with the fucking ham and cheese omelet.
There's no choice here.

189
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.210
It's not even a choice.
Right.

190
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.680
We do have a limited selection of the practices,

191
00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:56.610
so we apologize if when we get to you,

192
00:11:56.611 --> 00:11:59.670
what you want is not available to Lee.
You're like,
I'm fucked.

193
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.010
And you just sit sitting there is every row.
Why wouldn't you just hear the you?

194
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:07.530
How do you see how you say ham and cheese?
Ham and cheese omelet.
Okay.

195
00:12:07.531 --> 00:12:11.990
And if you said ham and cheese omelet every once in awhile there's some martyr

196
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.100
that goes it.
Yeah.
Take the bucket of Shit.
Right.
Um,

197
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.220
and then by the time it gets to you,
you know they're all gone.
Even heard of Sam.

198
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.550
Sorry sir.
I'm sorry man.
We don't have any more ham and cheese omelet.

199
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.100
I understand.
I understand you're upset,

200
00:12:26.101 --> 00:12:29.610
but I don't choose how many ham and cheese omelets or on this flight.

201
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.520
Well,
I'm sorry you feel that way.

202
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:38.690
Well please go to American airlines.com/ org.net and I air your grievances there

203
00:12:38.731 --> 00:12:41.070
and our robot,
we'll get back to you.
Right?

204
00:12:41.071 --> 00:12:44.580
So then they come up to you and of course just,
you just have to go.

205
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.460
So you're,
all we have left is the bucket of Shit,

206
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.590
which you like that with the Granola,

207
00:12:50.591 --> 00:12:54.580
the granola kind of takes the edge off of the shit.
Is that,
would that be okay?

208
00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:56.400
And you still have to sit there and be like,

209
00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.740
you just drag her through it even though it's not her fault,
you know,

210
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.160
you don't have what happened to him and she's on with.

211
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.180
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

212
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.820
<v 2>You don't have any of that just started curiosities.</v>

213
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.880
You ever started the back row and work your way to the front just to kind of

214
00:13:11.881 --> 00:13:13.890
even it out.
You know,
you never do that.

215
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:18.330
How come you always start up front and work your way back to that poor excuse

216
00:13:18.331 --> 00:13:21.450
for a of a kitchen?
Why do you do that?
You know what I mean?

217
00:13:21.451 --> 00:13:24.720
So I thought that this was all coach.
Evidently there isn't,

218
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.160
evidently there's the ham and cheese party coach and a bucket of shit,

219
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.580
sir.
Why are you being hostile?
Nine 11 safe.
The terrorists,

220
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:39.250
the terrorists fight the terrorists.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,

221
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.200
how the fuck did I get into that?
What was I talking about?

222
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.270
Oh No,
I was talking about,
Oh yeah,
the,
the fucking,
all the election.
Jason's,

223
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.810
I got so lost in doing that.
I don't remember what I was talking about.
Yeah.

224
00:13:53.811 --> 00:13:57.320
That's basically what we're left with were basically sitting on in the last row,

225
00:13:57.321 --> 00:14:00.680
middle seat right next to the bathroom on a DC nine.
You know,

226
00:14:00.681 --> 00:14:03.620
we can't even look out the window and the engine is just blocking it.

227
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.090
And if you like me,

228
00:14:05.091 --> 00:14:09.290
you heard of this story the one time the engine failed on the tarmac,
thank God,

229
00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:12.740
but a piece of it flew through the fuselage and into this woman's head and

230
00:14:12.741 --> 00:14:17.390
killed her.
That's what I always think about.
But you know what?
I also,
I also do,

231
00:14:17.391 --> 00:14:21.890
it's because,
uh,
you know,
I didn't really look it up.
Somebody just said it to me,

232
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.850
but last night I did look something up because someone was trying to tell me

233
00:14:25.851 --> 00:14:26.870
that some comedian,

234
00:14:26.871 --> 00:14:31.871
actually an American comedian went to Dubai and had a little bit of coke in

235
00:14:33.321 --> 00:14:36.620
there,
fucking suitcase that they forgot about,

236
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.450
got caught with it and got automatic 10 years.
Um,

237
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.900
and I'm just like,
really?
I go walk to American comic.
And they were like,
yeah,

238
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:51.340
yeah,
dude,
American comic guys fucked.
Nobody had a name,
no nothing.

239
00:14:51.341 --> 00:14:54.280
And I looked it up and for the life of me,
I can't find it.

240
00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:00.660
You know what I did find was that there was this fucking half Iranian,

241
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:06.070
a half Swedish male model who got busted with some sick amount of coke.

242
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:11.170
Somehow got a life sentence.
They didn't kill him,
but they,
um,

243
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.090
they did kind of reduce it down to 10 years.
So he's got 10 years.

244
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.890
So he made a rap song in jail,
like dyke.

245
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.420
Remember that guy shine who was with j Lo and puffy?

246
00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:25.870
I'm going way back to the 1990s when people still watch music videos.

247
00:15:25.871 --> 00:15:30.310
Maybe it was the year 2000.
Right.
And,
uh,
uh,

248
00:15:30.311 --> 00:15:35.110
what's his face used to do a,
the TV show.
Oh God,

249
00:15:35.111 --> 00:15:38.290
what was it called?
Carson Daly used to do that show,

250
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:43.540
the top 40 fucking videos,
whatever the fuck it was called.
Um,

251
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.910
during that time,
right in members shine did the fuck.
And he did the,

252
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.990
made a song over the Rikers island phone.
This guy did the same fucking thing.

253
00:15:51.991 --> 00:15:56.050
And I got to admit like,
yeah,
I dunno.
I,
I didn't,

254
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.650
I didn't have sympathy for the guy.

255
00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:58.710
<v 5>Okay.</v>

256
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.360
<v 2>Which is weird.
It's odd for me.
I was just,</v>

257
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.700
you know what it was cause he was acting like Pete rose.

258
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.300
It was still all about him.
He was like,
I didn't have any drugs in my system.

259
00:16:06.301 --> 00:16:07.500
I was blah blah.
It's like,
yeah,

260
00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:09.720
but you were going to distribute the shit you con to,

261
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.490
he didn't give a fuck what happened and those people,

262
00:16:11.491 --> 00:16:14.190
you're trying to make some money.
You knew what the fine was.

263
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.710
You roll the dice and you're fucking lost.

264
00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:24.100
Well,
kind of an asshole goes anywhere in Asia with drugs.

265
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.790
You're out of your fucking mind.
You're out of your fucking mind.

266
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.540
Yeah,
it's fucking over.
They have a zero tolerance.

267
00:16:32.541 --> 00:16:36.770
The only thing they do is make the drugs and ship it over here for some fucking

268
00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:38.460
reason.
That's what I don't get.

269
00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:44.640
If you get caught with drugs over there yet,
completely fucked.
But God damn it,

270
00:16:44.641 --> 00:16:48.150
they will make some in a minute.
Right.
Well I guess that's Afghanistan.

271
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.290
Afghanistan is kind of the wild west,
right?

272
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.480
You'd think the fact that we've been at war with them for almost a decade and a

273
00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.840
half,
you'd think that I would fucking know a little something about them.

274
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.780
I don't know.

275
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:04.810
<v 5>Okay.</v>

276
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.410
<v 2>What do I know about those guys?
Who is the number one band in Afghanistan?</v>

277
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:14.490
You know what I mean?

This is still going to be us.
Space up opportunities.

00:18:56.861 --> 00:18:59.630

All right,

307
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.960
this got us out of America.
Let's read about this.

308
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.610
Somebody decided not to be a teller.
Telemarketer,

309
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.260
Her customer service guy leaves India and goes into Afghanistan.

If that was ever on wheel of fortune or you bought a vile and you said a,

316
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:37.780
if you couldn't solve that,

317
00:19:37.781 --> 00:19:41.440

323
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.330
It's like,

This is the townies from U s I.
L.

334
00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.870
You still lamp patty and Tamil Nadu.

335
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.830
Is it weird that did it met?
Made me want to get some Indian food.

336
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.440
Is there anything better than garlic naan?
I don't know.

337
00:21:10.441 --> 00:21:15.441
I've spent and lonely independence day on August 15th at a Sikh temple in Kabul

338
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.063
or he had to,

339
00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:21.450
had taken refuge after his Afghan visa expired.
Well,

340
00:21:21.451 --> 00:21:24.480
how the fuck do you let that happen?
Mr Rander?

341
00:21:24.481 --> 00:21:29.100
Jude had hash who came to Afghanistan on the promise of a job as a security

342
00:21:29.101 --> 00:21:34.101
guard in an American military base for $800 every month had been swindled out of

343
00:21:36.181 --> 00:21:41.181
150,000 rupees or 2,300 bucks by his employment agent in India.

344
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.010
Oh,
I'll tell you,
it's filthy.
You know,

345
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.660
after paying the money and waiting here for three months to 28 year old,

346
00:21:48.661 --> 00:21:52.710
found out that there was no job and was left with just enough money for his

347
00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:55.410
phone and his cigarette.
Oh my God.

348
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.200
Jesus fucking Christ.

349
00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.680
Do People in like Asia just laugh at American movies like our ideas of what

350
00:22:05.681 --> 00:22:10.630
trouble is?
Can you imagine that?
Can you imagine?
Somebody just said,

351
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:14.050
hey,
you want a job in Afghanistan?
And you go,
yeah,
I'll fucking do that.

352
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.440
I feel like there's a lot of American military right now nodding their heads

353
00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:19.450
like,
yeah,
we know what that's like.
Yeah,

354
00:22:19.451 --> 00:22:24.240
you get there and it's not what they promised.
Absolutely.
Um,

355
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:26.441
you show up,

356
00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:28.900
you think you're going to be a hero and then they tell you you got to buy your

357
00:22:28.901 --> 00:22:33.700
own uniform.
Um,
after paying the money,
there was no fucking job.

358
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:37.750
He's got enough money for phone and cigarettes while do that is just,

359
00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:39.400
that is next level evil.

360
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.360
The Indian embassy in Kabul said that as of mid August 70 distressed Indians.

361
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.480
That's the way they put it.
Right?

362
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:55.200
Like posttraumatic Stress Syndrome instead of the classic George Carlin Bit bit

363
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.760
shell shocked.
Right.
Who was similarity,
similarity,

364
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.390
abandoned and were sent back to India.
All these sent back,

365
00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:09.220
I'll thank God last year they were 160.
Oh,
so I see what this evil guy goes.

366
00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:12.040
He goes,
well look,
then we fuck them over and then they get freaked out.

367
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:15.460
But then they just go to the embassy and then they pay for it,
you know,

368
00:23:15.461 --> 00:23:19.210
fuck you on paying my taxes.
These guys will be all right.

369
00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:21.580
And then they justify it,
right.
Then they go out and they buy themselves,

370
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.290
you know,
some shiny shoes and a car.

371
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.680
The Afghan Sikhs had given many of the Indians refuge in their temple and Kabul

372
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:34.270
a described them as mostly poor folk who had taken loans and sold off land to

373
00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:36.730
pay commission to fraudulent employment agents.

374
00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.600
They came with the hope of earning double the money paid for low skill jobs in

375
00:23:40.601 --> 00:23:43.330
India.
Do you know when I landed,
landed in Dubai,

376
00:23:43.331 --> 00:23:45.890
when I connected there with no cocaine in my fucking

377
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.110
<v 2>suitcase.
Do you know that?
Somebody told me that,
you know,</v>

378
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:57.490
there's basically the slave labor camps that total debt built Dubai and uh,

379
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.510
a lot of them were people from India and they get promised,
yeah,

380
00:24:02.511 --> 00:24:06.800
you come over here,
you know,
the,
the poorest of the poor come over here.

381
00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:08.930
You're going to make like fucking nine zillion dollars.

382
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:12.210
You're going to have a play station.
And then when you go back,
you know,
whatever,

383
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:13.940
you can bring your family over here and all that.

384
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.480
And they show up and the first thing they do is they confiscate their fucking

385
00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:19.010
passports.
And these people just be,

386
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.780
they can't leave and they just become slaves.
And a,

387
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:27.230
the number one cause of death is like suicide.
You know what I mean?

388
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:33.910
Controversy at the Oscars.
I want,

389
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:38.020
I want to play a plumber.
American troubles,

390
00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:46.150
um,
fucking unbelievable.
Unfucking believable,
man.

391
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.930
Well,
I'm glad this person got back.
Jesus Christ.
That's the type of Shit,

392
00:24:49.931 --> 00:24:52.750
you know.
Do you remember that show arrested abroad?

393
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.530
I remember back in the day on the,
uh,

394
00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:01.810
the opie and Anthony Program,
the tragically now gone,
Opie and Anthony Program,

395
00:25:01.811 --> 00:25:03.910
one of the great radio shows of all fucking time.

396
00:25:03.911 --> 00:25:08.240
I remember we were talking about that and we were watching that arrested abroad,

397
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:13.240
which just made you never want to travel outside of the United States again,

398
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.870
or whose kid?
No.
You know,
they made it really fucking racial.
It was just like,

399
00:25:16.871 --> 00:25:19.480
you're white.
Stay in the white zone.

400
00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:23.770
You could go to England,
you can go to Canada,

401
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:28.810
do not go south of San Diego or you are on your road.
Right.

402
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.280
But at the end of the day,
as much as these people were like fucking,
you know,

403
00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:34.720
in jail,
they always,
you know,

404
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:39.400
most of them did something extremely fucking stupid where,

405
00:25:39.401 --> 00:25:40.390
you know,
they,

406
00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.640
they went out and bought platform shoes and hollow them out and put a bunch of

407
00:25:45.641 --> 00:25:49.450
fucking,
you know,
heroin in there and a couple baggies,

408
00:25:49.451 --> 00:25:53.080
a coke up their ass.
And it's just like that.
You never saw midnight express.

409
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:54.680
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

410
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.000
<v 2>If you can find that clip.</v>

411
00:25:56.001 --> 00:25:59.870
I remember a long time ago we kept riffing on that.

412
00:25:59.871 --> 00:26:02.390
That Irish guy would just go,
you know,
when he got busted,
he just,

413
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.490
I just kept thinking,
what have I done?
We want it to get done.
You fucking,

414
00:26:07.491 --> 00:26:09.350
you fucked yourself over.
Get Dope.

415
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:10.993
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

416
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.550
<v 2>I Dunno.
I Dunno.
How fucked up is your life that like,
that's your option.</v>

417
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.130
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

418
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:20.720
<v 2>You'd like,
that sounds good.
Like,
I mean,
thank God I,</v>

419
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.730
I just out of sheer dumb fucking luck.

420
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:24.990
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

421
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:29.460
<v 2>Landed in the skin I have in the country.
I mean like I really got like at Delta,</v>

422
00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:34.050
you know,
a fucking an ace and a 10 I really did.
I've totally lucked out.

423
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.060
You know what I mean?
If somebody ever came up to me,
it was just like,
Hey,

424
00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:39.810
do you want to put some heroin in your ass and try to make it across the border?

425
00:26:39.811 --> 00:26:44.470
It's just,
it's,
it's an emphatic,
definite.
And the final as final answer.
No,

426
00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:49.810
no,
I'm good.
I'm fucking good.
Don't need to do that.

427
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.280
You know,
dude,

428
00:26:51.281 --> 00:26:55.390
I would go back to having a fucking paper like I did in the third grade right

429
00:26:55.391 --> 00:26:59.410
through freshman year.
To be honest with you.
I would actually do that job again,

430
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.640
you know,
get a nice workout in the morning.
If I didn't live in a fucking city,

431
00:27:03.641 --> 00:27:07.840
I would be a paper boy in a fucking second.
Was fucking great.

432
00:27:07.841 --> 00:27:11.050
You got up before everybody else.
It was really peaceful.
It's quiet.

433
00:27:11.051 --> 00:27:14.450
Fucking birds were chirping.
Yeah,
you had to deal with the weather,
but that,

434
00:27:14.451 --> 00:27:18.580
that's what made you a fucking man.
You know,
you put on your Poncho,

435
00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.540
you put on your thick socks,

436
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.700
fucking nostrils,
freezing together.
Oh God.
It was brutal.

437
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:32.130
I never,

438
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.270
there was nothing fucking better than when back when there were actually four

439
00:27:35.271 --> 00:27:39.560
seasons on the east coast when the springtime came.
Okay.

440
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.850
And then you got up in the morning and you didn't have to wear a jacket.

441
00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.430
I cannot even describe to you how fucking unbelievable that was.

442
00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:51.530
MMM.
And the same way,

443
00:27:51.531 --> 00:27:54.590
the ominous feeling is when it first started getting cold and you're like,

444
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.640
oh fuck.
Here comes another one.
Yeah.
MMM.

445
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.570
I told you this story before and I had this bike,
this fucking,

446
00:28:02.571 --> 00:28:06.710
it was basically one of those beach bikes with white wall tires.

447
00:28:06.711 --> 00:28:09.670
I was always a sucker for fucking white walls.
And I did,

448
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.620
I sort of pointed at the bike making fun of it.
My Dad loved it.

449
00:28:12.621 --> 00:28:17.180
And he grew up in the fifties,
right?
Oh yeah.
We got big tires right there,

450
00:28:17.181 --> 00:28:19.540
those big fucking peewee Herman bikes.

451
00:28:19.541 --> 00:28:22.700
So I bought the bike and everybody was laughing at me.
All my friends had these,

452
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.540
you know,
pre like fucking,
uh,

453
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.810
we're all those fucking BMX bikes.
It was pretty BMX.
It was all,

454
00:28:29.811 --> 00:28:32.090
everything was all about Schwinn,
the Apollo three speed.

455
00:28:32.091 --> 00:28:33.020
They all had these cool bikes.

456
00:28:33.021 --> 00:28:37.220
And I had this giant Fucking Pre pee wee Herman peewee Herman fucking bike.

457
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:42.410
And I remember one time my older brother took it and everyone was laughing and

458
00:28:42.411 --> 00:28:43.310
he wrote it down.

459
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.340
The driveway is fast as he could in attires was so big and thick.
They,

460
00:28:47.341 --> 00:28:51.360
when he fucking locked him up,
it actually made the sound of a car and went like,

461
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.230
yeah.
And then everybody thought the bike was cool and then they would,
you know,

462
00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.210
that's how I ended up fitting it.
People will come along,
I look at it,

463
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:03.130
it's stupid fucking bike and I'll need to do is lock them up once and then they

464
00:29:03.131 --> 00:29:05.290
laughed and thought it was cool and it was all right.
They all,

465
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:10.291
they look past my orange hair and my freckles and that's the way they did 76,

466
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:14.650
um,
anyways,
yeah,
I would do that job in a fucking second.

467
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.200
Somewhere along the line,
it became an adult's job.

468
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.270
And it was a combination of when,
you know,

469
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:24.300
we finally addressed the fact that there was a sexual predators out there.

470
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.930
And then also the show has made you feel like there was one behind every fucking

471
00:29:27.931 --> 00:29:31.930
tree.
Um,
so anyways,
yeah,

472
00:29:31.931 --> 00:29:36.330
so that went out the fuck the economy went to shit and it became an adult's job.

473
00:29:36.331 --> 00:29:41.010
But anyways,
let me read the,
uh,
let me read the fucking,
what the hell is,

474
00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:45.740
let me do the live reads.
Hey.

He hit him on the tonight show.
Yes.

491
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:56.490
<v 6>I can't find a was most annoying thing as much as you hate that you do it all</v>

492
00:30:57.551 --> 00:31:00.760
the time now.
That was the most annoying.

493
00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:02.933
<v 2>Stop doing that.</v>

494
00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:08.150
That was magic Johnson son Eja Eja and when he was talking about him,

495
00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.720
I'm not saying he's a bad person,
but like,

496
00:31:12.721 --> 00:31:17.250
he's just like going up because people would just walk around and get excited

497
00:31:17.251 --> 00:31:21.660
about sunglasses and shoes and shit.
It's just like,
that's the big fucking thing.

498
00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.680
The material.
Oh,
read the material is

499
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:27.180
<v 6>when people were like,

500
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.300
<v 2>no,
it's fun.
It's like gross.
Look,
I respect somebody that has style.
Yeah.</v>

501
00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.990
Like when we watch and come on,
come on over to the microphone.
When you,

502
00:31:33.991 --> 00:31:38.570
you taped a Chappelle show's block party,
right?
Yes.
Great fucking film.
Yeah.

503
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.220
So we watched that and when a Lauren Hill came out,
right?

504
00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.190
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Crazy.
Exactly.
Great stuff.

505
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.560
But she has sit around talking about her shoes.
I mean,

506
00:31:48.561 --> 00:31:53.000
and then she goes out and crushes it and syncs this fucking sock.
Okay.

507
00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.570
But for someone to just sit there and just sit there and talking or it'd be

508
00:31:56.571 --> 00:32:01.310
excited about blazers.
It fucking soft garters and shit.

509
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:04.130
It's just,
I dunno.

510
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:07.910
And then Kiwi like just like your days all we're going to go out and go shop for

511
00:32:07.911 --> 00:32:12.440
five fucking hours.
I don't understand B.
What?
I said I love it.

512
00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:15.200
Hey by the way,
you know something I'm going to fucking,

513
00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.060
I'm going to handle the garage.

514
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.200
Oh cause you know no cause you keep poopooing the whole thing.

515
00:32:21.201 --> 00:32:24.620
Now I understand what yeah,
you know something.
If it was a common era,

516
00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:27.910
it was a common area,
you would be excited.
You think I'm not interest.

517
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:31.380
<v 6>Then having a little gym here at the House,
I think that's a great idea.</v>

518
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.190
Who wouldn't want to have their own little gym so they don't have to go out to

519
00:32:35.191 --> 00:32:36.024
work out.

520
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.870
<v 2>Okay.
Now did you guys hear what she just said?
How did she describe it?
Twice.</v>

521
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:43.740
Little.
Oh,
you little gym.
Yeah,
you guys.
Yeah,
you will still,

522
00:32:43.741 --> 00:32:47.490
Vince used to have that bit.
Whose joke is that was well,
Sylvan insane.

523
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:50.770
I see in your,
your little Mercedes.
Oh,

524
00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:55.740
you little Rolex taking me down.
I'm not taking you down.

525
00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.810
I'm just telling you.
You know,
you're calm.

526
00:32:57.811 --> 00:33:01.350
Tone is like when a pilot just goes through turbulence and even he's scared,

527
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:03.970
but he doesn't want to scare you.
So he just speaks in that calm.

528
00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.080
I really hate when you referenced yourself.

529
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.400
I really hate when you reference your own.
What am I supposed to do?
I don't know.

530
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.710
It's who I am.
I don't know,
but it's a reference.

531
00:33:13.711 --> 00:33:16.650
Your own self is like so annoying.
And so,

532
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.930
<v 1>cause I've got redo the garage.
I don't give a fuck.</v>

533
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.320
Fucking hell.

534
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.280
<v 2>All right,
let's get into the,
uh,
the advertising for this week.</v>

535
00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:37.700

539
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:52.000
<v 6>It's like itching to beat the band.
It's crazy.</v>

540
00:33:52.001 --> 00:33:53.340
You gave her her allergy pill.

541
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:56.090
<v 2>No I actually forgot to.
Did you really?</v>

542
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.120
Can you come over to the mic so people don't have to lean forward into their

543
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:01.660
dashboard?
Is it driving here?
People can hear it.

544
00:34:01.661 --> 00:34:04.010
You're the only one who screams into the microphone.

545
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.430
Like completely defeating the purpose of why a microphone exist.

546
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.930
I'm the only one who was screaming into a microphone.
No,
but

547
00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.240
anyway.
Oh yes.

I've found what I want here is a rogue fitness.

549
00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:26.030
Gee It would be nice if rogue fitness would trade some equipments or some free

550
00:34:26.031 --> 00:34:27.020
advertising.

551
00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:33.080
<v 6>RML three w fold back Welmont rack.
Say it again.</v>

552
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:38.470
The rogue are m l three w fold back wall mount rack made in the USA.

553
00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:42.810
<v 2>This is what's great.
It can fold back into the wall.</v>

554
00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:46.800
So if you have a small garage like me that's built for a fucking,
you know,

555
00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:51.400
1928 model t Ford.
If there was one,
some gearheads we actionable.

556
00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:55.690
Do we just continue in 1927?
I don't care.
I don't make them.
Um,

557
00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:59.460
what's great is it has a pull up bar on it.
It's got,
you can,

558
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.690
you can move the thing up and you could do squats.
Nobody does their legs.

559
00:35:03.691 --> 00:35:07.410
From my generation,
it's all about the upper body weight doing today,
judge,

560
00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.920
to buy back and triage.
You ever going to do your legs?
Do it.

561
00:35:10.921 --> 00:35:12.300
I walk around all the time.

562
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.030
<v 6>Why?
Why?</v>

563
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:18.380
Why do certain guys have like these little chicken legs and these huge upper

564
00:35:18.381 --> 00:35:22.280
bodies?
What is that about?
Is that like,
that's a deliberate style,

565
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.630
like they're doing that on purpose?

566
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:24.160
<v 2>No.</v>

567
00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:28.760
What it is is when you walk up to the sink and you flexing in the mirror from

568
00:35:28.761 --> 00:35:32.840
your waist down is below the vanity.
So you can't see out of proportion.
You are,

569
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:37.190
yeah.
Yeah.
Plus legs.
It's not sexy.
It's not fun.
It's hard.

570
00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.360
It's work.
Everybody.
I mean you go to any fucking gym in the world.

571
00:35:40.361 --> 00:35:43.420
If you want to go bench press,
if there's two people in there,

572
00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:46.210
there's only going to be two benches and they're both going to be occupied.

573
00:35:46.211 --> 00:35:49.710
That's all guys do.
Every guy,
there's a zillion exercises,

574
00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:52.670
but every guy goes over the bench press.
What do you put a little bull?

575
00:35:52.671 --> 00:35:56.380
They do 25 I'll be full.
Good Times.
Right?
But all that other shit,

576
00:35:56.590 --> 00:36:01.180
there's very few people that actually when you go to the gym have like a

577
00:36:01.181 --> 00:36:05.620
proportion by the ladies are all about the squats and everything because that's

578
00:36:05.621 --> 00:36:07.480
your,
that's your problem areas.

579
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.350
It's the biggest part of your body as the legs.
Yeah.

580
00:36:11.351 --> 00:36:13.750
And actually if you build up your thighs,
your build up the,

581
00:36:13.751 --> 00:36:16.390
that's the biggest muscle.
It allegedly burns enough fat.

582
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:20.140
And I could get rid of my belly here.
See belly belly.

583
00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:21.250
I was trying to be a gentleman.

584
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:24.303
<v 3>Nothing.</v>

585
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.970
<v 2>Oh,
freckled con Belew caught
nothing.</v>

586
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.680
I'm not dumb.
There's a lot of the CB a pooch.
There's a lot of things.

587
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:40.350
You've got a baby bump.
I got it.
I got it.
Um,

588
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:44.090
just a lot of too much for good.
Yeah.

589
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.330
There's a lot of good reviews or this thing.
Yeah.
I've got four stars.

590
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:53.070
Or is it five?
Five stars?
Five stars?
Yeah.
Have you researched it?
Um,

591
00:36:53.071 --> 00:36:57.430
I'm going to handle all of it.
Do you tapped out this morning?
All right,
fine.

592
00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:59.700
Fine,
fine.
I'll let you handle it.

593
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.160
You let me handle it and I'll let you know how it is.

594
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:05.070
And when I walk around and I'm shredded and I'm proportioned,

595
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:08.460
you're going to be like,
you know what?
God dammit,
I was wrong.

596
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.230
Are you going to put it in?
And I'll say,
I forgive you.

597
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:14.970
I going to put up a mirror somewhere so you can watch yourself while you shred

598
00:37:14.971 --> 00:37:17.500
it and see what,
see what she's doing.
You little jam.

599
00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:20.330
You going to put a mirror up?
I'll be right back.
You scared me.

600
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:22.330
You scared of what I'm going to become.

601
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:30.300
All right.
Let me read the fucking advertising so I can get on with the day here.

602
00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:35.150
All right.

607
00:37:48.981 --> 00:37:53.981
A thing of the past tracker is a coin size device that locates,

608
00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:58.640
misplace keys,
wallets,

612
00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.040
precise location with the tap of a button.
It's that easy.

613
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.650
Lose your phone.
No problem.

614
00:38:18.651 --> 00:38:23.651
Cliffy press the button on tracker and your phone rings even when it's on

615
00:38:24.771 --> 00:38:25.604
silent.

Here's some more music from Andrew Feminists and he's the one,

657
00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:56.630
he's the reason why I know about mute math and I'm very excited.

658
00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:01.670
I'm going to take the lovely Nia there.
I'll see you guys in the crowd.
Uh Huh.

659
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:04.690
Did I miss most of the podcasts?
Yeah,

660
00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.220
unless you want to do a little bonus time here.
How about you cleo?

661
00:41:07.221 --> 00:41:11.350
You want to do some bonus time?
Nate Keshet.

662
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:16.100
Hello Buddy.
Just going to delete everything and get down.
Go lay down.

663
00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:21.440
Go on.
Yeah,
step right on it.
Yep.
Step right on it day ago.
Get over on your bed.

664
00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:23.150
Get over there.
Go on.

665
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:27.610
<v 3>Go on.
My mom laid out.
Did you talk about the Oscars?</v>

666
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:32.220
<v 0>I talked about the Oscars the last time.
What did you talk about?</v>

667
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:33.980
I was talking how

668
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.920
<v 2>white people fucking crushed it again this year.</v>

669
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.333
I mean,
I don't really have,

670
00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:44.130
are you allowed to be proud as a white male heterosexual?
Sure.

671
00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.860
Your face is other people.
Sure.
Uh,
I don't,

672
00:41:47.861 --> 00:41:50.300
I actually don't have anything else to contribute this stuff.

673
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:55.370
You don't have anything else to contribute?
I wrapped up the podcast.
I did.
Sorry.

674
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.940
I know I got all excited and I realized I got nothing.
No,

675
00:41:58.941 --> 00:42:01.520
I thought I talked Chris Rock's monologue was fucking tremendous.

676
00:42:01.521 --> 00:42:03.020
I thought he addressed it and I thought it was,

677
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:05.000
we was well balanced and he's like,
yeah,

678
00:42:05.001 --> 00:42:08.210
we're just looking for an opportunity you take.
You can't get mad at that,

679
00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:13.720
you know?
No.
It is funny watching adults wanting to win a trophy though,

680
00:42:13.721 --> 00:42:17.870
if that is funny to me.
Cry.

681
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:23.520
Um,
Eddie to be nominated for an Oscar though,
wouldn't you?
What's that?

682
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:27.560
What have you like just crushed it in a movie and there was talk of like at the

683
00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:31.400
studio and stuff of you being nominated and they wanted you to do a campaign and

684
00:42:31.401 --> 00:42:34.880
all that kind of stuff that I would like to be the guy that everybody says

685
00:42:34.881 --> 00:42:38.690
should it got nominated and then didn't.
So then everybody feels bad for you,

686
00:42:38.691 --> 00:42:42.310
but you don't have to campaign or go to the shelf.
That's the sweet spot now.

687
00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:44.030
Okay.
That makes sense.
Yeah.

688
00:42:44.031 --> 00:42:45.920
You don't wanna be the guy that gets fucking nominated.

689
00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.530
Then you got to sit there with the camera on your face as the guy with the

690
00:42:48.531 --> 00:42:52.880
fucking good.
Good.
What's that?
What's that fucking kettle?
Kettle Drum,
right?

691
00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.960
It's like the Timpani.
Yes.
Just like they're not going to give it to me.

692
00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.700
Look at me.
I'm a balding fractal.
Fuck.
Right.

693
00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:02.180
And then they give it to the good guy with the square jar and then he goes up

694
00:43:02.181 --> 00:43:06.190
there and then I sit there going,
oh gosh,
such a long way to go.

695
00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:11.690
We're killing.
This
was funny.
Fucking 12 minutes ago,

696
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:16.850
the first 58 times we've done it.
Yeah.
That's what I would like to be.
All right.

697
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:21.620
You want to be the guy that people said got fucked over because then people feel

698
00:43:21.621 --> 00:43:24.980
like you're still,
there's you like the underground band.

699
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:27.630
Is that what you're going for?
Yeah.
Underground.
Yeah.

700
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:30.710
Keep putting your eyebrows up.
Like,
I haven't figured out this fucking business.

701
00:43:30.711 --> 00:43:33.770
I have all these dishes who get nominated.

702
00:43:33.771 --> 00:43:36.720
The next thing you know they're fucking doing crest commercials and they're

703
00:43:36.721 --> 00:43:40.460
sitting court side on the fucking game and then people get annoyed because they

704
00:43:40.461 --> 00:43:42.260
start seeing them when they shouldn't be seeing him.

705
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.630
And then you're just fucking everywhere and it's just like,

706
00:43:44.631 --> 00:43:48.230
there's a hole in the ozone layer.
Hey Guide from this fucking movie.

707
00:43:48.231 --> 00:43:51.530
What do you think about it?
Who I fit the constituents and he just like,

708
00:43:51.531 --> 00:43:56.090
why am I listening to this guy from the reboot Brady bunch talking about what we

709
00:43:56.091 --> 00:43:59.060
should do in Afghanistan and then you jump the shark and you're done.

710
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.850
You want to be the guy that people are going like he got fucked man,

711
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:05.150
that movie so much fucking better,
but blah blah blah blah blah.
Yeah,
you want to,

712
00:44:05.151 --> 00:44:07.850
you want to be just underneath it so people know who you are.

713
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:10.430
So they still show up to see a dick and shit jokes.

714
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:14.420
But you're not overly exposed.
I like your philosophy.

715
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:22.020
Not that I,
there's nothing else to it.
I agree with you.
What I,

716
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:24.080
I seriously do.
I'm not joking.

717
00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.260
You've probably said that like three times in the 12 years that I've known.

718
00:44:27.261 --> 00:44:30.960
You said what?
I agree with you.
I agree with two.

719
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:36.450
I have nothing to add.
Yeah,
but I don't like it.
Okay.

720
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:39.870
This is like when Vince Vaughn was on Jimmy Fallon and knew Jimmy was trying to

721
00:44:39.871 --> 00:44:43.260
get in his head when they were going to play a what's in the box that's fucking

722
00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:47.700
bit it.
Call.
What's in the box?
What's in the box?
It's fine.
All right.

723
00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:52.550
I to go lie the liars box.
Yeah,
dude,

724
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:57.480
that was a clinic.
That was a clinic that Vince Vaughn put on there.
All right.

725
00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:01.560
I'm uh,
I'm out of time here,
right?
Enjoy the rest of the podcast.

726
00:45:01.561 --> 00:45:03.450
I'll talk to you on Monday.

727
00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:46.830
All right.
Here's this sexuality situation.
Everybody.
Um,
hey bill,

728
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:49.610
I need your advice on something.
Uh,
this is,
uh,
not,

729
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.410
this is not about a breakup dating are gold diggers,

730
00:45:52.411 --> 00:45:53.940
but I think your advice could help me,

731
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.420
could help me out on an extremely awkward position.

732
00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.040
I'm 19 and I'm home from college for this Ama.

733
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:04.470
I've been home for about a month and I live in North Carolina,

734
00:46:04.471 --> 00:46:06.450
but go to college in Arizona.
Dude,

735
00:46:06.451 --> 00:46:11.070
good move Arizona with all those fucking whores out there coming to class and

736
00:46:11.071 --> 00:46:15.750
like bikini tops.
And you're out there with your Q to than cute southern drawl.

737
00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:20.640
How much asks are you getting?
Well,
let's find out.
Shall We?
Okay.

738
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:25.230
While I was away at college,
I have opened up to new ideas such as politics,

739
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:29.840
politics,
religion,
and about my sexuality and my bike,

740
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:34.050
and I am bisexual.
At the beginning of summer,

741
00:46:34.051 --> 00:46:36.930
I started hanging out with my old friends from high school,

742
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:41.460
one of which was gays.
We had messed around in high school,
but nothing serious.

743
00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.520
What does that mean?
You flicked his balls a little bit.

744
00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.840
Sorry.
The fucking joke is there.
I'm going to do it.
All right.
Come on.

745
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:56.380
Take it like a man.
Like everybody else.
Okay.
Everybody gets trashed on this.

746
00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:57.640
Here we go.

747
00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.790
So this summer he and I were hanging out at my house and nobody was home.

748
00:47:00.791 --> 00:47:04.510
We started and we started to drinking.
Oh Gee,
she's playing some music.

749
00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:09.670
Why am ca and he started to smoke some weed,
man.

750
00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:11.650
Then after about two hours,

751
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.210
we decided to do the dirty Jesus Christ.

752
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:18.080
<v 3>Okay.</v>

753
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.770
<v 2>Okay.
Here we go.
Login away through here.
Halfway through US getting it on.</v>

754
00:47:21.771 --> 00:47:26.050
My mom walks into the room and catches us in the act.

755
00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.110
Wow.
Now talk about the needle going off the fucking record.

756
00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:37.720
She started yelling at me,
wanting me with the mail.
She had just gotten,

757
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:41.740
I'm surprised you didn't turn the hose on.
You kicked my friend out of the house,

758
00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:46.870
then banned him from ever coming over again and started screaming about the

759
00:47:46.871 --> 00:47:50.710
Bible and a bunch of religious shit.
By the way,

760
00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:52.510
this all happened when I was in a,

761
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:56.890
in a panic trying to get some clothes.
Oh my God,
Dude.

762
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:59.170
What a way to come out.

763
00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:01.590
<v 4>Okay.</v>

764
00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:05.720
<v 2>Oh,
I think it was Mitch was a giant neon.
I'm gay sign hanging over you.</v>

765
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:11.240
Wow.
That's a fucking situation there,
Huh.

766
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:15.940
Ever since then my mom and dad had been forcing me to go to a few religious nut

767
00:48:15.941 --> 00:48:20.450
jobs that are supposed to convert me from bisexual to heterosexual.

768
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:21.800
That's hilarious.

769
00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:25.640
You know like you're going to convert a truck from two wheel drive to four wheel

770
00:48:25.641 --> 00:48:30.050
drive,
like it's that fucking easy.
This is a huge pain in the ass because one,

771
00:48:30.051 --> 00:48:33.290
there are churches on every corner in North Carolina and two,

772
00:48:33.291 --> 00:48:37.040
I don't want to change,
so you shouldn't,
dude,
you can't.

773
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:40.310
You are who you fucking are and they're going to have to accept it.
Also,

774
00:48:40.311 --> 00:48:43.970
my parents had been treating me differently now and it's really weird and

775
00:48:43.971 --> 00:48:48.780
awkward every time we talk.
So I guess my question is how do I deal with this?

776
00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:53.420
So this is might be outside the realm of my lack of extra expertise here.

777
00:48:53.421 --> 00:48:57.380
Do I tell them that I don't want to go to some religious fat fuck who a Jesus

778
00:48:57.381 --> 00:49:01.570
Freak and whose stomach is as long as his vowels.

779
00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:04.190
I always got that southern draw.

780
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:10.190
You can't be suck and day yet.
Um,

781
00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.370
or should I just pretend to be straight until the under summer,

782
00:49:13.371 --> 00:49:17.570
then go back to living the life I want to live at college also.

783
00:49:17.571 --> 00:49:21.800
How do I keep saying with people telling me that I am living my life wrong and

784
00:49:21.801 --> 00:49:25.400
that God is judging me.
I hope that wasn't too sad,
dude.

785
00:49:25.401 --> 00:49:29.720
It's a fucking epic story.
Thank you for sharing.
Sharon it here.
Um,
all right.

786
00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:31.730
This is a deal,
dude.
You,
you need new friends.

787
00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:35.180
You need to keep the friends that accept you for who you are.

788
00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:38.620
And the ones who aren't,
you just got to phase them out.
Your parents were,

789
00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:41.930
your parents will come around,
you know,

790
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:47.600
they got to come around cause you're,
you're their son.
Alright.
Stereotypically,

791
00:49:47.601 --> 00:49:51.290
probably your mom before your dad or whatever.
But I don't know,
maybe they will,

792
00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:54.140
maybe they won't,
but what the fuck are you gonna do?

793
00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:55.650
<v 4>Okay.</v>

794
00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:59.580
<v 2>You know,
you are who you are.
You got to go be who you're going to be and uh,</v>

795
00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:02.840
<v 4>okay.</v>

796
00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:06.560
<v 2>As far as do you tough it out for the summer,
that,
that stuff that's up to you,</v>

797
00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:09.560
that's up to you if you're going to keep going back.
I mean,

798
00:50:09.561 --> 00:50:12.880
if I was going to keep going back to some shit that I wanted,

799
00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.960
didn't want to go to,
I would just,

800
00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:18.030
<v 4>okay.</v>

801
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:19.340
<v 2>I would have fun with it.</v>

802
00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:25.480
I would just act like a fucking moron and I would keep acting like I was almost

803
00:50:25.611 --> 00:50:28.700
cured.
And then at the last be like,
but don't you think John Travolta's

804
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:32.360
<v 0>cute?
Oh No,
no.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm just fuck with the guy who just have a good time.</v>

805
00:50:32.361 --> 00:50:36.560
If you can't get out of it,
if you don't want to,
you know,
fight,
you know,

806
00:50:36.561 --> 00:50:40.100
if you don't want to be like Hitler and try and fight on three fronts and ended

807
00:50:40.101 --> 00:50:41.840
up in a fucking bunker,
uh,

808
00:50:41.841 --> 00:50:45.290
maybe just start with to get some new fucking friends.

809
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:51.350
Uh,
that's it,
dude.
That's brutal man.
That's brutal.
But uh,

810
00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:53.960
you'll get through it.
You'll get through it and you'll find some fucking people,

811
00:50:53.961 --> 00:50:57.260
you know?
I don't know.
It's weird.
In a weird way.

812
00:50:57.261 --> 00:51:00.770
Everybody does that beyond that shit.
You know,
as a comedian,

813
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.750
I never fit in anywhere.
Everywhere I went,

814
00:51:02.751 --> 00:51:06.920
like when I fucking had jobs and they would be sitting there and I had my little

815
00:51:06.921 --> 00:51:09.320
Michael J.
Fox fucking suit and tie on,

816
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:13.310
like thinking that this is what I was going to do and everybody was going in for

817
00:51:13.311 --> 00:51:16.970
some fucking meeting.
I'd never gave a fuck.
And I never,
I just felt,

818
00:51:16.971 --> 00:51:20.330
always felt like an outsider until the day I walked into a comedy club.

819
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:24.680
And I basically found people who were the same kind of weird that I was.

820
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:27.940
So they didn't seem weird to me.
A bit of admittedly,

821
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:29.570
comedians roll out of our fucking mind.

822
00:51:29.571 --> 00:51:32.030
So that's what you have to do in a gay way.

823
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:36.890
You just got to go find some heterosexuals who are accepting of you and go get

824
00:51:36.891 --> 00:51:39.470
some gay friends and uh,
you know,

825
00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.860
you're gonna have a great life and you're going to have abs until you're 60,

826
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:44.870
evidently.
Cause that's how it works with gay people.

827
00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:48.383
<v 4>Fuck off.</v>

828
00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.880
<v 0>B O u r and that's it.</v>

829
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:52.423
<v 4>There you go.</v>

830
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:07.763
Yeah.

831
00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.810
<v 0>All right,
sisters,
a through c.
Here we go.</v>

832
00:52:55.740 --> 00:53:00.050
Tired of giving advice to guys with psycho suicidal girlfriends or people with

833
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:03.770
STDs.
Well,
I got something a bit later,
a few here.
Uh,

834
00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:07.160
kind of like the cores lite version of your typical advice.
Thank you.

835
00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:10.790
And it's perfect for the middle of the summer.
We kicked my feedback on this one.

836
00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:16.300
So I know this lady who I've been friends with uh,

837
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:21.770
for a while now and banged one time,
she's the oldest of three sisters.

838
00:53:21.771 --> 00:53:23.570
So we all call her sister a.

839
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.960
About two years ago I made out with sister be in a club,

840
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:32.910
not my initiative,
um,
and ended up having sex with her the same night.

841
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:36.120
Jesus Christ.
Dude,
I went out with her.
Do,

842
00:53:36.121 --> 00:53:39.210
do they have like that thing on the back of their SUV where they have the stick

843
00:53:39.211 --> 00:53:42.780
figures of the entire family and you just slowly keep exiting them out

844
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:48.990
and the family doesn't understand.
Is somebody trying to kill my daughters?
No,

845
00:53:48.991 --> 00:53:53.960
I'm just trying to fuck all of them sir.
Well that's a relief.
All right.

846
00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:58.940
Um,
anyways,
I went out with her for awhile.
Oh,

847
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:00.030
this is sister B.

848
00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.750
And it was surprisingly not awkward when we were hanging out all together,

849
00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:08.220
even though everyone knew the situation.
Jesus Christ,

850
00:54:08.221 --> 00:54:11.670
what's southern state are you in sir?
Um,

851
00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:15.120
I'll go fuck yourself people down south.
That was funny.
Um,
some months later,

852
00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:16.950
sister be left me for one of her,

853
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.860
one of my friends and got over it quickly enough.

854
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:23.340
But when you got over it quickly enough,

855
00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:28.170
and nowadays I'm still in contact with sister a and B since I'm not the kind of

856
00:54:28.171 --> 00:54:30.480
guy that holds a grudge for that kind of stuff.
Well there you go.

857
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.401
It's very mature,

858
00:54:32.401 --> 00:54:34.440
which means you really didn't give a fuck about either one of them.

859
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:36.660
So why are you going to be all upset?
You know,

860
00:54:36.661 --> 00:54:39.780
like you own their pussy once you fuck it.
I hate when,
I hate when guys do that.

861
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:42.060
Anyways,
recently census to see,

862
00:54:42.061 --> 00:54:45.300
started talking to me more frequently after talking for a bit.

863
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:50.510
She said she could pose for me since I'm a painter and she's a model and a 10

864
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:54.600
all the fucking way I might add,
oh you fucking creep.

865
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:58.190
You fucking creep.
You fucking creep.

866
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:02.090
So she was a 10 the whole time.

867
00:55:02.091 --> 00:55:06.140
So basically you're in a holding pattern banging her oldest sisters waiting

868
00:55:06.141 --> 00:55:09.840
until this girl was of age so you could fucking painter Jesus Christ.
I got to,
I,

869
00:55:09.841 --> 00:55:11.810
you know,
I might have to stand up and applaud this one.

870
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:14.480
This guy's taking it to another level.
Dude,

871
00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:19.440
this is a fucking epic situation here.
So you go see,
here's my question.

872
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:25.630
Does that proposition mean anything?
Don't you need my advice?

873
00:55:25.631 --> 00:55:29.290
I need advice from you.
How do you fuck every girl in the same family?

874
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:35.480
Jesus Christ.
This is like,
you know how long that's been a,

875
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:38.990
it's been since there's been a triple crown winner in horse racing.

876
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:42.640
The last time someone won the Kentucky Derby,

877
00:55:42.641 --> 00:55:44.170
the Preakness and the breeders' Cup.

878
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:47.800
Is that what it is or is that a soccer match?
I don't fucking know.
I don't know.

879
00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:48.633
No fucking horse.

880
00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:53.230
Since the late seventies I would guarantee that it's been since the late

881
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:55.630
seventies sent somebody has booze bank three.

882
00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:00.280
I think a lot can do two in one family,
but to get all fucking three,

883
00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:02.770
two,
three,

884
00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:07.390
two is a respectable three is it?
No,

885
00:56:07.391 --> 00:56:10.150
it's beyond respectable.
Two.
Three.
Okay.

886
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.520
Everybody knows was three is in the sporting world too.
That,

887
00:56:12.521 --> 00:56:15.370
that's a fucking dynasty.
Okay.

888
00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.250
You just put yourself in there with fucking Bill Russell.

889
00:56:19.330 --> 00:56:22.480
You put yourself in there with,
with,
with the fucking,
uh,

890
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.960
Magic Johnson Lakers.
You know,
I wouldn't say the Colby Lakers.

891
00:56:28.961 --> 00:56:31.950
You know when you go out and you get Phil Jackson and fucking check that,

892
00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.860
that's that new ship that the kids like.
I don't like that shit.
Um,

893
00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:39.730
either way,
dude,
you're talking fucking dynasty.
Oh wait,

894
00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.440
magic never won three in a row,
but he had the Celtics to fuck with named when?

895
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:45.850
Three out of four years.
Give me a fucking break.
Um,
so he,
he's Michael Jordan.

896
00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:49.510
There we go.
So here's my question.
Does that proposition mean anything?

897
00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.660
Is it a trap?
Should I try to bang her?

898
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:58.240
Should I try and bang her too and get a third strike or keep my dick in my pants

899
00:56:58.241 --> 00:57:01.510
and avoid a potential shit storm?
And if yes,

900
00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:06.340
do you have any tips,
special tips on this special situation?

901
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:09.970
All my friends are telling me to do so,
but I thought I'd ask him.

902
00:57:09.971 --> 00:57:13.210
We'll refine mine like yourselves before I did a move.
Dude,

903
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:16.780
you're looking at me like,
dude,
you're beyond me right now.
Okay.

904
00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:21.280
This is like Bull Durham.
I'm fucking Kevin Costner.
Um,
I'm,
I'm a lifer.

905
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:23.380
Okay.
You're,
you're,

906
00:57:23.381 --> 00:57:26.530
you're going up to the show pit and brand new balls every fucking day.
I will.

907
00:57:26.531 --> 00:57:31.420
I will you tell me.
Okay.
I never banked two girls in one fucking family.

908
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:32.770
You know,

909
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:36.280
I was psyched if I was able to tag a couple of friends and we were all hanging

910
00:57:36.281 --> 00:57:37.120
out at a bar one night.

911
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:40.360
And you get that feeling like I fuck both of you and you both know it and you

912
00:57:40.361 --> 00:57:44.260
both loved it.
I hope.
Please,
please tell me you liked it.
Digital like it was.

913
00:57:44.261 --> 00:57:48.370
I okay.
Um,
dude,

914
00:57:48.371 --> 00:57:53.110
I think you got to do it.
You got to do it.
You know,

915
00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:57.160
you,
you've been above board the whole time.
Sister,
rain since to be,

916
00:57:57.161 --> 00:57:59.350
they all fucking knew everything right now.

917
00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:01.420
I understand this is a little delicate.
Okay.

918
00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.260
He's trying to snip the last wire here.
This is the kid sister.

919
00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:08.470
This is it going to blow up in your fucking face.
Uh,
it's worth it,
dude.

920
00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:14.560
It's worth it.
It's worth losing a couple of limbs and your nose on this one.

921
00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:18.760
You got to do it
the fuck.
You know,
Dude.

922
00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:23.620
What the fuck
she says to you?
I,

923
00:58:23.621 --> 00:58:26.170
yeah,
you're,
you're a painter.
All let me take my clothes off.

924
00:58:26.171 --> 00:58:29.950
He get paid my fucking Twat.
That's not art too.
That's foreplay.

925
00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:33.400
Give me a fucking break.
It'd be one thing if you're in a classroom of people,

926
00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:38.260
it's just you and she's standing there naked.
Dude.

927
00:58:38.261 --> 00:58:40.830
That's like one of the depth they ever done that porn senate,

928
00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:44.500
that scenario in a porn at Jesus Christ,
you might have fun.
A new angle

929
00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:51.310
through.
That's phenomenal.
That is fucking phenomenal,
dude.

930
00:58:51.311 --> 00:58:54.320
You gotta do it.
You got to do it.

931
00:58:54.321 --> 00:58:58.870
Did John Elway retire when he only got one?
He came back for another,
right?

932
00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:02.560
You got to do it to w

933
00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:06.940
two that's like when Bush fucking the first Bush.

934
00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:11.800
He stopped and he didn't get to sit down.
You got to go all the way on this one,

935
00:59:11.801 --> 00:59:14.450
man.
All right.

936
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:19.950
You gotta be like Marlon Brando in fucking apocalypse now.
He just,

937
00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:24.550
you just,
you just the fact you left the program.
All right.

938
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:26.103
And

939
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:27.710
<v 4>okay,</v>

940
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:31.340
<v 0>I don't care how mad these girls get,

941
00:59:31.341 --> 00:59:36.341
you are at the precipice of becoming an absolute fucking legend.

942
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:39.690

<v 0>legit.
Who?
Who can,
who can,
who's going to be able to top that dude.</v>

944
00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:46.010
There is celebrities who've had orgies,

945
00:59:46.011 --> 00:59:49.340
they've had five on ones and all that type of Shit,
okay?

946
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:54.830
But I guarantee you they never fucked three fucking girls in the same family

947
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:57.860
when they weren't famous,
not famous.

948
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:02.060
You're doing this shit with the gift of Gab.
Whatever the fuck you're doing,

949
01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:03.620
do you do this?
You got to write a book,

You know,
that's what you should do.</v>

952
01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.910
Collection of the most amazing pussy getting stories ever that you can somehow

953
01:00:11.911 --> 01:00:16.530
confirm,
all right,
and it has to be none of that bullshit.

954
01:00:16.531 --> 01:00:19.230
The second you get famous,
you get money.
That doesn't count,
all right?

955
01:00:19.231 --> 01:00:21.510
That's garbage time.
Okay?

956
01:00:21.511 --> 01:00:24.680
They put the fucking second team in there and you just fucking Titone layups.

957
01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:28.310
That's bullshit.
I'm talking about just regular dude.
You do.

958

You talk yourself into it.
[inaudible] you're a fucking legend.
You got to do it.

959
01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:36.790
All right.
This might halftime speech.
I'm going to quote Joe Barton.

960
01:00:36.791 --> 01:00:41.791
Nick quoting John Madden today is going to be the greatest day of your life,

961
01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.910
but only if you win.

962
01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:23.763
<v 4>Okay?</v>

963
01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:32.640
By the

964
01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.600
<v 0>way,
I think it's time.</v>

965
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:36.480
I think we're about 17 minutes in and think it's about time.

966
01:01:36.481 --> 01:01:41.100
I patted myself on the back.
How about that?
Download speed last week.

967
01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:45.180
Huh?
How about that?
I didn't hear any complaining.

968
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:50.680
You know,
hundreds and hundreds of people bitch,
Moan and and fuck.
Woo.

969
01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:58.380
Right?
So I finally fixed the God damn problem and what am I get?

970
01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:01.140
I get like five tweets going,
hey,
I really appreciate it.

971
01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.740
You know what happened in the rest of you con you went on to bitch about

972
01:02:04.741 --> 01:02:09.450
something else.
You don't like the photo on my fucking page.
You know,

973
01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.130
you have a stop and thinking about,
you know,

974
01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:14.790
maybe finding out what you're really upset about Jesus Christ.

975
01:02:14.791 --> 01:02:19.080
Could I use that advisor?
Um,
all right,

976
01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:23.090
let's talk about something in the news,
shall we?
You know what?

977
01:02:23.091 --> 01:02:26.870
I think they shouldn't have to fucking sing the news the way they do in the

978
01:02:26.871 --> 01:02:29.270
Catholic church.
You know,

979
01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:34.380
<v 1>there was a guy who got attacked by two monkeys in South Africa.</v>

980
01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.680
He decided he was going to go down there and try to rehabilitate some

981
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:45.150
chimpanzees.

982
01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.180
Dad had been abused and they turn around and drag them for two kilometers and

983
01:02:49.181 --> 01:02:53.260
kicked the shit out of him.
What a dumb fuck.

984
01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.760
Why would you fly across the world to get your fucking ass kicked?

985
01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:00.370
Did you guys hear about this dude,

986
01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:05.870
<v 0>South Africa,
Texas student attacked by chimp improves.</v>

987
01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:11.450
Thank God he improves this poor fucking bastard.
He's a ranger,
right?

988
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:15.260
He loves animals.
This is the thing about animal lovers.

989
01:03:15.261 --> 01:03:20.261
You got to realize that once you go past a certain level of domestic animal and

990
01:03:20.901 --> 01:03:24.170
you start getting into the wild,
no matter how much you love them,

991
01:03:24.171 --> 01:03:25.460
they're not going to love you back.

992
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:33.260
Wild animals.
I like that.
Dick,

993
01:03:33.261 --> 01:03:36.950
you shouldn't have gone out with you know that person have cheated on you.

994
01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:41.540
That person who just doesn't have your back.
Wild animals do not have your back.

995
01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:43.700
You dog has your back.

996
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:48.730
You cat borderline cats kind of have that creepy vibe that if shit went bad,

997
01:03:48.771 --> 01:03:51.950
they'd decide with the intruder.
You know what I mean?

998
01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:58.910
Fish.
They just don't have any fucking say.
They're like a Stepford wife,
you know?

999
01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:03.770
That's why dogs are the best they,
it's,
they truly fucking love you.

1000
01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.350
My dog fucking loves me,

1001
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:08.480
will be on a walk and all of a sudden she just look up me.

1002
01:04:08.481 --> 01:04:13.190
It's almost like she's smiling.
You know how fucking warped,
why sound?

1003
01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:17.060
She's probably just panting and it looks like she's smiling and she's probably

1004
01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:19.760
going like,
why does he have this fucking rope around my neck?

1005
01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:22.400
It doesn't make any sense to me.
If I really wanted to,

1006
01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:25.460
I could rip his fucking face off,
but in my world,

1007
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:27.920
I'm so in love with my dog and look,
she's smiling,

1008
01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:33.680
but that's not bad when you just have a dog.
I think people who fucking,
you know,

1009
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:38.900
fuck with animals for a wild animals,
they start thinking like,
oh,

1010
01:04:38.901 --> 01:04:43.710
look at the Cheetah.
Oh,
she's playing AAA and all of a sudden grow off.

1011
01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:47.960
This fucking launches itself that you
all right.

1012
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:53.830
I believe that we came from monkeys.
I believe that we came from the apes.

1013
01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:57.680
I believe something else.
So there's three in a row in this sound smooth.

1014
01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:03.890
Um,
but I by no means think that,
uh,

1015
01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.680
that those fucking things like us,
I don't give a shit if I teach it.

1016
01:05:06.681 --> 01:05:10.370
Sign Language and the chimps sit net going in sign language.
Hey,

1017
01:05:10.371 --> 01:05:12.770
I think you're a cool guy there.
Freckled face cunt.

1018
01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:18.070
You know that there's no fucking way I'm ever going on the other side of the God

1019
01:05:18.631 --> 01:05:21.430
damn cage.
This poor bastard was on the other.

1020
01:05:21.431 --> 01:05:24.460
He was on the other side of the cage.
He just got too close.

1021
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:31.240
That's how fucking insane a wild animal is.
Chimpanzees,

1022
01:05:31.241 --> 01:05:35.080
they say have the strength of six,
six men.

1023
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:40.870
This dude got attacked by two chimps that would be like getting attacked by a

1024
01:05:40.871 --> 01:05:44.740
flash mob.
Okay.
Like 12 fucking people.

1025
01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:49.510
They just grabbed this motherfucker by his ankles.
They reached underneath.

1026
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:53.890
I mean,
I don't what kind of bullshit cage they had was like a compound,
you know,

1027
01:05:53.891 --> 01:05:56.680
so they put up that,
that,
that cheap wire shit,

1028
01:05:56.681 --> 01:06:00.040
when you don't want to rabbit to come in and eat your lettuce right in your

1029
01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:03.640
garden.
Like they put that shit up.
So this fucking guy sitting there,

1030
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:06.820
you know as they go doing that shit and he's like,

1031
01:06:06.821 --> 01:06:08.960
what are you guys joining Jeremy?
We adjourn telling me,
right?

1032
01:06:08.961 --> 01:06:12.580
And he's trying to sign to them.
You guys want to play Frisbee,
right?

1033
01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.100
And they sitting there talking to each other going just two more inches,

1034
01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:18.550
two more inches.
Look at this dumb motherfucker who wants to play Frisbee right?

1035
01:06:18.551 --> 01:06:21.910
And they reach underneath,
grab him by his fucking ankle

1036
01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:27.940
strength.
The 12 men,
they fucking pull them right underneath that God damn thing.

1037
01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:31.150
Like when you go to Quiznos and they stick you sub right through that poor

1038
01:06:31.151 --> 01:06:33.640
excuse for a fucking a brick oven,

1039
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.800
yanked the fucker right underneath.
Oh my God.

1040
01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.580
And then they dragged them full like another fucking two kilometers.

1041
01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:46.660
However fucking far that is.
I don't know.
In my world.

1042
01:06:46.661 --> 01:06:51.590
That's a,
what's that about?
A mile and a quarter.
Cause I know like 40 kilometers,

1043
01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:54.370
like 60 kilometers is like 40 miles an hour.
Who gives a fuck?

1044
01:06:54.371 --> 01:06:59.140
They drag this son of a bitch basically through the length of every football

1045
01:06:59.141 --> 01:07:03.940
stadium in the NFL and I can guarantee you it wasn't the nice turf that those

1046
01:07:03.941 --> 01:07:07.030
guys play on.
This was the natural habitat.

1047
01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:10.600
Like I can't imagine the vice grip strength,

1048
01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.270
those,
those fucking things,
man.

1049
01:07:13.271 --> 01:07:17.440
They'll rip your foot off the rip your balls off the rip your face off the rip

1050
01:07:17.441 --> 01:07:20.650
it off.
Like you open a fucking God damn thing,

1051
01:07:20.651 --> 01:07:24.340
a yogurt God damn ice cream when you just take the lid off,

1052
01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:25.420
they do that to your face.

1053
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:29.890
What the fuck are you doing near these God damn things.
You know

1054
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:33.160
Jesus fucking Christ.

1055
01:07:33.161 --> 01:07:36.790
I would have to tranquilize had guns and I would be wearing one of those
fucking,

1056
01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:40.060
you know the suture where when you think you're going to get bitten by a shark

1057
01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:43.180
that chainlink shit.
There's no fucking way.

1058
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:47.980
There's no way fucking catcher's mass welded to my face.

1059
01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.100
I'm not going to it in here.
And not only that,

1060
01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:54.310
these aren't just regular fucking chimps that have been swinging around eating

1061
01:07:54.311 --> 01:07:58.930
bananas,
occasionally eating another monkey alive,
right?

1062
01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:03.400
This isn't that shit.
These are ones that were abused.

1063
01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.370
They were already fucked with.
Okay.

1064
01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:11.730
And having adopted a fucking abused dog and the God skitzo Shit that that thing

1065
01:08:13.301 --> 01:08:15.040
does,
I can't fucking imagine

1066
01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:20.400
a God goddamn schizophrenia fucking ate two of them straight.
The 12 God,

1067
01:08:20.401 --> 01:08:24.700
they are men and you're gonna walk near the cage trying to sign,
hey,

1068
01:08:24.701 --> 01:08:28.660
how about the weather frank or whatever fucking human named he gave him.

1069
01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.840
You're right,
Yardi your fuck and God bless you.
Your heart's in the right place.

1070
01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:35.110
Fortunately,
this kid doesn't seem like he had any damage like that,

1071
01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.270
but like this dude was so in shock,

1072
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:41.080
like they will finally able to just like stitch him up and stabilize him.

1073
01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:45.190
And evidently he's not in critical condition and it doesn't seem like,

1074
01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:49.390
it seems like he still has his balls,
his feet and his face,

1075
01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.820
which is incredible.
But they say,
you know,

1076
01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:56.860
he has bite marks and a and fractures plural.

1077
01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:01.150
Oh my God,
just treating me like a fucking rag doll.

1078
01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.530
That is the most horrifying shit in the world.
To me,

1079
01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.220
nature is the most horrifying shit I would rather have.

1080
01:09:10.410 --> 01:09:12.310
Well,
let's see.
You know what,
the human equivalent,

1081
01:09:12.311 --> 01:09:14.950
someone has to come into my house with a fucking chainsaw.

1082
01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:18.970
I can deal with the God damn.
I could deal with the machete.

1083
01:09:20.230 --> 01:09:23.410
All right.
I could deal with that.
Chainsaws that,
that's hardcore.

1084
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:27.750
I could fuck up machete.
I could deal with,
I think I could fucking do the,
the,

1085
01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.930
the sugar ray Leonard,
you know,

1086
01:09:28.931 --> 01:09:32.350
stick my face out and then pull it back when you took a swing and then fucking

1087
01:09:32.351 --> 01:09:33.590
try to take both of your legs down.

1088
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:38.983
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1089
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:44.190
<v 0>Ah,
only hardcore boxing fans got that one.
Um,
but the,</v>

1090
01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:48.900
I mean if you were in a room with the chimp and that thing goes fucking ape

1091
01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:53.210
shit,
no pun intended.
That thing is on the floor.
It's up on the ceiling.

1092
01:09:53.211 --> 01:09:55.070
It's across the room.
It's like,

1093
01:09:56.690 --> 01:10:00.650
it's like a comment and you're sitting there dealing with human speed

1094
01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:07.120
too.
That's why we got the brains that we have.
This,

1095
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:11.120
why was so much smarter.
We have to be because we're so fucking slow.

1096
01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:13.633
You know what I mean?

1097
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:17.090
You ever see a white guy who gets dunked on and those highlight films,

1098
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:22.450
you know that fucking guy that they bring off the bench when the teams either up

1099
01:10:22.611 --> 01:10:26.990
by 30 or down by 30 that guy,
that's what we are in nature.

1100
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:30.980
Even the fucking athletic humans,
you,
you know when nowhere near.

1101
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:36.130
Just think like a how fast a fucking snake is a fucking pit Viper Viper,

1102
01:10:36.531 --> 01:10:41.360
right?
Nothing fucking,
you don't eat your bit and that thing has left,

1103
01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:44.120
left the fucking building before you even did,

1104
01:10:44.121 --> 01:10:48.230
before that signal from your fucking leg going,
hey,

1105
01:10:48.231 --> 01:10:51.980
we just got bit by a Goddamn pit viper even reaches your brain.

1106
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:53.480
That snake is already leaving

1107
01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:57.440
and then you go and then the real is,

1108
01:10:57.441 --> 01:11:00.440
and as the realization that you got bit hits you,
you are,

1109
01:11:00.441 --> 01:11:04.310
you're already collapsing.
Why the fuck would you go out there?

1110
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:08.300
You know?
I don't know.
We,
we had to be that fucking smart.

1111
01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:14.180
I can't imagine that the God damn fear back in the fucking

1112
01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:18.410
day you're walking around with a bunch of Goddamn neanderthals or whatever it,

1113
01:11:18.411 --> 01:11:22.220
Nina talls,
I guess I supposed to say.
I sit in the her fall my entire life,

1114
01:11:22.221 --> 01:11:27.020
but it's meander tall,
I guess.
And what else was it?
There was two tribes.

1115
01:11:27.021 --> 01:11:27.860
One of them died off.

1116
01:11:27.861 --> 01:11:31.100
There was an the enter talls and then there was the fucking crow magnums.

1117
01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:35.240
And I forget what the fuck we are.
One of them,
one and the other ones.

1118
01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.070
The other one of them's was a little bit smarter and the other ones were a

1119
01:11:40.071 --> 01:11:43.520
little dumber and dumber ones died off.
All right.

1120
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:48.500
And some people have a little bit of that Crow Magnum or Neanderthal in him,

1121
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:52.400
you know,
because you know that people,
they fuck right.

1122
01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:57.140
It's going to be the dumbest education of podcasts you've,

1123
01:11:57.141 --> 01:12:01.320
you'll ever going to fucking here.
I just totally lost my train of thought.

1124
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:03.990
What the fuck was I talking about?
Oh,
Niana toss.
Right.

1125
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:09.480
So I can't imagine what,
just fucking walking around.

1126
01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.640
Did you ever see that shit when they did that whole thing?

1127
01:12:11.641 --> 01:12:14.880
I'm crow manikins Indiana tall is like,
one of them was like fucking slower,

1128
01:12:14.881 --> 01:12:19.050
like the fucking white dude in the NBA and one of them was a little bit quicker,

1129
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:20.070
a little bit smarter.

1130
01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:24.030
So they fucking did this shit where like when they would show him like taking

1131
01:12:24.031 --> 01:12:28.920
down some prehistoric bison,
like the fucking little smarter ones,
you know,

1132
01:12:28.921 --> 01:12:31.560
they could fucking,
you know that that Shit,
they could slip a punch,

1133
01:12:31.561 --> 01:12:33.330
they could throw a goddamn spear.
They could do,

1134
01:12:33.331 --> 01:12:38.100
they could do it from a fucking distance.
Like this fucking jackass.
He wasn't,

1135
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:42.330
he was too close to the God damn cage.
The fucking Chromatin is whatever.

1136
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:46.500
The dumber ones they would like fucking day would just brute strength.

1137
01:12:46.501 --> 01:12:49.500
They would fucking run and try to tackle the thing and someone would,
you know,

1138
01:12:49.501 --> 01:12:50.790
separate their shoulder,

1139
01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:54.210
a break and elbow and there's nobody around to set that shit.

1140
01:12:55.410 --> 01:12:59.910
Every step in your fucking nonexistence shoes,
your big stupid prehistoric foot.

1141
01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:04.500
It's just shoving that pain shoot through your body.
I just can't imagine,

1142
01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:09.510
I can't imagine sitting there looking out of a cave in everything is that much

1143
01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:14.190
faster than me.
And I don't have a fucking door.
I don't have a gun.

1144
01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:17.270
You just must be just sitting here like,
ah,

1145
01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:21.240
and he can't really communicate to the other person because language hasn't been

1146
01:13:21.241 --> 01:13:24.450
developed yet.
So you just having that,
what the fuck?
Look on your face.

1147
01:13:24.451 --> 01:13:28.950
That was probably one of the first phrases invented like,

1148
01:13:28.951 --> 01:13:31.350
are you shitting me or the kill you?
Can you fucking believe this?

1149
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:39.200
I Dunno,
but God blessed that dude,
you're an animal lover.

1150
01:13:39.201 --> 01:13:42.170
I totally know where you're coming from.
But for the love of fucking God,

1151
01:13:42.171 --> 01:13:46.310
those things are not your friends.
Okay?

1152
01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:48.400
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1153
01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:53.110
<v 0>I Dunno.
Start [inaudible] and stay away from that fucking cage.
Jesus Christ.</v>

1154
01:13:53.111 --> 01:13:54.280
Can you imagine that

1155
01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:01.700
I am getting dragged away by two fucking abused chimps.

1156
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:07.110
Then you know God damn well he saw that fucking Oprah won't episode.

1157
01:14:07.111 --> 01:14:10.290
That woman came on with no face.
I know.
We was fucking thinking of that shit.

1158
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:15.500
I hate those mother fuckers.
He noticed.
I like gorillas.

1159
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:18.200
I hate chimpanzees and I hate those little monkeys,

1160
01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.420
the little motherfuckers that throw their shit at you.

1161
01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:23.120
I can't stand those fuckers.
And I hate chimpanzees.

1162
01:14:23.121 --> 01:14:26.630
I always hated those motherfuckers.
I didn't know why,
and now I know why.

1163
01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:31.780
That was my inner fucking whatever the fuck caveman telling me.

1164
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:36.410
Get the fuck out here.
Go back to the cave.
Stupid.

1165
01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:42.950
I don't trust them.
I don't,
I don't trust those fucking things.

1166
01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:44.960
You ever go to the zoo and you just fucking,
you'd just,

1167
01:14:44.961 --> 01:14:46.550
your eyes meet with like a lion.

1168
01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:52.640
Just that fucking look on their face when they,
they,

1169
01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:55.100
they just,
it's,
I've said this before,

1170
01:14:55.101 --> 01:14:58.460
it's like what the same look like when a hooker looks at you like it's,

1171
01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:02.010
it's the real deal.
You know this,

1172
01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:05.180
this is some fucking bullshit flirting,
playing hard to get,

1173
01:15:05.181 --> 01:15:08.570
get a couple of drinks out of you.
It's,
yeah,
you got 20 bucks.

1174
01:15:08.571 --> 01:15:11.750
I will suck your Dick.
What?
You know,

1175
01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.310
lions got that same look on their face.
Like,
yeah,
if you know,

1176
01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:19.130
if you weren't in that fucking armored vehicle or on the other side of this,

1177
01:15:19.131 --> 01:15:23.340
yeah,
if I was hungry,
I would eat you.
And no matter how much you screen,

1178
01:15:23.341 --> 01:15:23.990
that wouldn't give a shit.

1179
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:28.820
It'll actually excite me more to rip your fucking head off.
There's no way.

1180
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:31.940
There's no way.
There's no fucking way.

1181
01:15:33.710 --> 01:15:36.600
That's why I watch all those animal thinks about it.
I'm fascinated and I love,

1182
01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:40.040
and I appreciate all those people that put themselves in harm's way because

1183
01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:45.050
there's no other way to really gauge how strong an animal is until you see it

1184
01:15:45.051 --> 01:15:46.400
slap around a human being.
Like,

1185
01:15:46.401 --> 01:15:50.010
I can't watch too fucking grizzly bears wrestle and slap each other.
They're,

1186
01:15:50.011 --> 01:15:51.830
they're in the same weight class.
You know what I mean?

1187
01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:56.890
If I see him bitch slap a human being and watch the guys head spin around a

1188
01:15:57.291 --> 01:16:02.180
couple of times,
like,
wow,
all right,
I get that.
I can now gauge that.
Let's like,

1189
01:16:02.181 --> 01:16:06.610
yeah,
like,
like kilometers versus miles.
All right.

1190
01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:07.690
I think we killed that subject.

1191
01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:08.753
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1192
01:17:08.050 --> 01:17:13.050
[inaudible]

1193
