00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.200
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.440
It's bill burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for January 23rd,

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.500
2017 what's going on our,
yeah.
Oh Man.

4
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:17.310
What a weekend.
Holy Toledo.
Holy Dayton.

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.470
Holy Sydney.
Ollie's,
Cincinnati.
Holy Cleveland.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.160
What a fucker weekend.
I had good Lord.
First of all,

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.760
I sat there with an Afghan and some Kleenex and watched the entire women's march

8
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.410
and I have to say I was so moved.
I'll be honest with you,

9
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:38.370
I haven't watched a second of it.

10
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.220
The only reason why I'm bringing it up just cause like 50,000 people on Twitter.

11
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:43.740
Like,
dude,
I can't wait to hear your take on the women's March.

12
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.270
I didn't fucking watch it.
I,

13
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.860
I cannot,
I can't.
I,

14
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.690
I did I ever tell you guys how much I believe in protesting,

15
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:59.130
but how much I can not watch it?
I'm always let down.

16
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:02.850
I'm always disappointed.
It's always just a bunch of bad chance.

17
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:05.820
Like I watched the Madonna speech thing.
I did do that.

18
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.010
<v 1>Just because I,
uh,
you know,
I relate to Madonna like her.</v>

20
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:16.790
I also stayed at the party too long.
You know,

21
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.620
I became the old creepy person's still at the club.
I did it.
I've done it.

22
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.500
I totally get it.
I get it.

23
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.500
She's fucking brilliant,
man.
She goes there,
right?

24
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.920
She knows she has all these eyeballs on her,
so she,

25
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:37.100
she's done this their entire career.
This is how you stay relevant.

26
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.650
All right.
Long after people give a fuck,

27
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.240
this is how you stay in this.
She goes and she just doesn't give a speech.
I mean,

28
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:51.470
how easy would it have been to give the speech without dropping the f word?

29
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.600
Right?
But if you do that,
you're not going to get any free presser.

30
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.280
She throws a couple of f bombs in there.
God knows.
I know how that works.

31
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.420
I made a lot of money off that word.
Good for you,
Madge.
Right,

32
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.080
but that's not going to be enough because she's thinking probably in her head,

33
00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:09.261
you know,

34
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:13.010
I already kind of did the dropping the f bomb thing on the Letterman interview

35
00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:16.520
like 20 years ago.
Critics will be like,
oh,

36
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:20.630
more of the same from Madonna,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I need to take this to a new level.

37
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.200
What does she do?
Threatens to blow up the White House.

38
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.013
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.620
<v 1>Daddy about blowing up the White House.
Did you,</v>

40
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.260
did you really think that you thought about doing that?
But Ghana,

41
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.510
how did you think like,
exactly how were you going to execute this plan?

42
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.710
We're going to put on a Wiley coyote suit and fucking climbed the fence.

43
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.840
The little thing of dynamite going around.

44
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:47.790
You know when you're backing up with the fucking wire,

45
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.860
Madonna did she,
you didn't think about that.

46
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.550
You just know if you say some shit like that,

47
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.220
it becomes an issue of national security no matter who the fuck says it.

48
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:00.731
So there you go.

49
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:04.590
Now you get Fox News going like should we consider this a terrorist threat,

50
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.710
right?
Classic.
And then what does she do?

51
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:13.060
What is the Cherry on top?
She sings one of her hits songs.

52
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.130
We're now all those women.
How much fucking money do you think she made?

53
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.960
<v 0>Are you with me?</v>

54
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.060
Yeah.
Do you believe in,

55
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.240
<v 1>this is off my fourth album,</v>

56
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.490
I believe at first debuted it on on the blonde damn fishing tour goes a little

57
00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:38.660
something like this.

58
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.420
Give me a dollar bay bear.

59
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.030
You can download this song not to Juno.
You know,
I'm,
give me a fucking break.

60
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.700
Fucking ring everybody up there with their fucking,
I dunno,

61
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.860
I couldn't watch it.

62
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.560
Like I had to watch some Madonna thing cause when I heard she did that,

63
00:04:00.561 --> 00:04:04.670
I was like this woman is,
she's fucking brilliant.
That woman is,

64
00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:09.020
she is showbiz 24,
seven.
That's why she's still around.

65
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.953
She did that.

66
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.020
She said she should've gotten booed when she started singing that song.

67
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.651
People should have been like,

68
00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:19.880
is this bitch fucking try to get 99 cents off of me?

69
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.883
<v 0>I Dunno.</v>

70
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.650
<v 1>That's the only thing I watched.
It was like five minutes.</v>

71
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.020
Well actually I watched her speech and then I was like,

72
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:32.400
well I got to hear the song.
She sinks and it was fucking perfect man.
You know,

73
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.960
I love that she sang the Lady Gaga Song.
Um,
anyways,

74
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.550
um,
and of course underneath all of those there was like,
you know,

75
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.760
some 17 minutes speech from Michael Moore.

76
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.380
That's shameless bearish.
Sit out there trolling for pussy,
you know,

77
00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:51.660
play in the under.
I understand card.

78
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.000
I really hate how he dresses like John Goodman when he was on Roseanne.
You know,

79
00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:02.940
he's always walking around with this big dumb fucking,

80
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.640
I just got done working on the on,
you know,

81
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.590
assembling cars that fucking Hattie wares.

82
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.670
I didn't know if there is no fucking with it.
I can't sit through that fucking,

83
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.740
I can't sit through any of it in this,
in this stupid chance.

84
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:18.570
And we're going to do this and we're going to do that.

85
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:22.410
And you just want to be like you're not,
you're not,
you're all going to go home.

86
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.220
You're all going to get 50,000 different fucking cars and that's going to be the

87
00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:26.521
end of it.

88
00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:28.650
And y'all are going to get to say that you were there and you put your fucking

89
00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:32.130
fist in the,
I know this is cynical is shit,
but I mean Trump did the same thing.

90
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.050
Did he not his acceptance speech.
Something else I barely saw any of,

91
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.580
I just watched the clips
when it comes,
when it comes to

92
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.170
like all of this type of shit.
I just watched the highlights.
Like,

93
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:49.410
if you never watched sports and all you did was just watch sports center,

94
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.260
you know what I mean?
But you never watched the game.

95
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.080
That's basically how I watched the ship.
Trump did the exact same thing.

96
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.960
He sitting up there,
Hey,
these,

97
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.280
these corrupt Paul to Church for you to do for themselves.

98
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.160
Well guess what?
It stops.
No.

99
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.250
How Donald,
how does it stop now?

100
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.440
He sounded like a fucking,
some loud drunk in a bar.

101
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.160
Dude.
You know what I would do if I was running stuff?
No,
you,

102
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.860
I kicked them all out.

103
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.340
Anybody takes a dime to fucking earlier.
I mean,

104
00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:31.330
it sounded like he did.
He just rent the untouchables.

105
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.710
It was like Kevin Costner is fucking speech in that movie.
Like what?

106
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.310
You're the president.
This is what I'm worried about.
That guy.

107
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.000
I'm worried about that guy cause he thinks being president is like,

108
00:06:43.001 --> 00:06:47.590
he just bought an old casino and he's going to go in and get all the people that

109
00:06:47.591 --> 00:06:50.020
were fucking,
you know,
loafing around.

110
00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:52.180
He's going to fire them and then replace them with,

111
00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:54.940
it's like you can't get rid of these.
How are you gonna get rid of these people?

112
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.430
How are you going to prove that they're doing what you're saying?

113
00:07:00.431 --> 00:07:01.780
You would have to expose them.

114
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

115
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.493
<v 1>All of them.</v>

116
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

117
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.890
<v 1>Both the blue ties and the red ties,
the red bras in the Blue Bras.</v>

118
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.790
Right.
They're all going to collectively get together and be like,

119
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:16.490
this guy's gonna make us all look like fucking scumbags.

120
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.270
We're just not going to work with,
I mean it was just a bunch of bull.

121
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:22.970
It was a bunch of shit.
It's just not,
you're not going to do that.

122
00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:26.360
That's not how the town works.
You're not the boss.
You can't go,
you're fired.

123
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.880
You have to run shit by people and then they're going to be cons.

124
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.490
They are,
they will.

125
00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:37.910
All Democrats are already going to be a cunt to you because you wear a red tie

126
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.490
and they're going to do the exact same shit the Republicans did to Obama where

127
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.090
they're not going to work because you were a different color.
Tie

128
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.070
you to come in and you're going to give some Tufts speech.
You know,

129
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.490
he should have been standing there holding like a,
like a piece of a two by four,

130
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.760
you know?
I don't know.
It was like,
it was very,
um,
you don't,

131
00:07:57.761 --> 00:07:59.710
when you're watching a movie and you're enjoying a movie,

132
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.940
then all of a sudden they just remind you that,
oh,

133
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:03.410
this is just the fucking movie.
Cause you go,

134
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:06.170
you know that that would never happen.
That's what that speech look like to me.

135
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:10.520
But I didn't see it.
I didn't see that either.
I just watched the highlights.

136
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.550
So you probably say,
well bill,
why didn't you see anything this weekend?

137
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.011
You know why?

138
00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:18.860
Because I had something a little more important in my life that happened.

139
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.893
<v 0>Okay.</v>

140
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:27.580
<v 1>I had to watch the New England Patriots Win The AFC championship game.</v>

141
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.830
There was a battle this weekend.
People,

142
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.970
and I don't mean women and people without voices standing in the rain wearing

143
00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:43.060
berets
or a prisoner,
jumpsuits,

144
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:47.150
whatever the fuck somebody was wearing on that day.
You know,
it's funny,

145
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.730
my daughter's speech is the amount of people milling around in the background,

146
00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:56.520
not even listening,
smiling,
look and listen for a couple seconds.

147
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.220
<v 0>You'd throw your hand in the air and then you just go fucking schmooze with</v>

148
00:08:59.221 --> 00:08:59.791
somebody else.

149
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:03.060
It was a big fucking Hollywood party and I can say that cause I watched three

150
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:07.470
minutes of it.
Um,
there was another battle going on here.

151
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:11.880
People and this,
this isn't,
by the way,
this isn't like an anti Trump thing.

152
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.230
This isn't an anti woman thing.

153
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:15.990
It's just one of those things of like what the fuck is everybody getting so

154
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:16.824
excited about?

155
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.910
<v 1>Are you ready?
I said,
are you ready?
And they're all going yes.
And it's like,</v>

156
00:09:21.911 --> 00:09:24.760
for what?
What are we doing?
Where are we going?
What's going to happen?

157
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.800
We're going to walk up there.
We're going to chance some shit.
Okay.

158
00:09:29.801 --> 00:09:32.380
You think if they walked up,
let's say the walked up to the White House,

159
00:09:32.381 --> 00:09:35.260
cause I don't know where they went.
Let's say they all start chanting.
Okay,

160
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.820
Donald Trump is in there.
Okay.
First of all,
me as a civilian.

161
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

162
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:41.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

163
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:46.810
I can go to a best buy and I can get a pair of those Bose noise canceling

164
00:09:47.331 --> 00:09:51.060
headphones and I can press a button and I can't even hear a fucking jet engine.

165
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:55.090
Yeah.
That I'm on.

166
00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.760
Or The guy talking too loud on his cell phone.

167
00:09:57.761 --> 00:10:01.270
I can just press that fucking thing and it's over.
Okay.
And I'm just a citizen.

168
00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:06.271
Can you imagine the pair of Bose fucking headphones that you get handed when you

169
00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:07.630
become president?

170
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.550
<v 0>Okay,</v>

171
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.700
<v 1>so you don't have to hear the chanting of the disenfranchised.</v>

172
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.753
<v 0>Right.</v>

173
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.500
<v 1>I bet you can't even see them.</v>

174
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.710
You know they fit right underneath this to pick not the to pay part.

175
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.050
The part that's still real that the Ben Franklin part of his fucking hairdo.

176
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.320
Right.
Probably just sticks them in his ear.

177
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.320
You know the ladies there,
you'd probably just sat there,
right?

178
00:10:32.321 --> 00:10:34.510
Just with his binoculars on,
you know,

179
00:10:34.511 --> 00:10:36.430
rubbing himself as he's looking out the window.

180
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.170
I'm sorry.
All right.
Oh God.

181
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:48.450
When did I become such a cynic?
You know what?
I don't,

182
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.930
I like to think it's life experience,
but what are you going to do?

183
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.020
<v 2>What are we going to do it?
Why do we,</v>

184
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.550
<v 1>what's going to happen?
Nothing.
Cause we all have to leave.</v>

185
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.190
Well,
I've got to go to work tomorrow.

186
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:05.963
<v 0>Okay.</v>

187
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.690
<v 1>We have to go to Work Bay Bay.</v>

188
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.900
You know it's funny about Madonna's showing up to this one.
It's like,

189
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:15.390
don't you live in England?
Why the fuck didn't you go to that rally?

190
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.830
I wanted it to blow up the fucking White House.
Oh yeah.

191
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.740
Can I see your passport please?
Did you go through customs first there?

192
00:11:23.741 --> 00:11:28.110
Uh Oh,
Jason's just stay in at the party.

193
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.920
Stay in at the club too fucking long.
Um,

194
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.660
what I'm doing is I'm challenging the images of what is said.
No you're not.
No,

195
00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:39.410
you're not.
You're not,
you're not challenging anything I get out yet,

196
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.750
if she was a guy,
she be that guy at the Christmas party.
You had to,
you know,

197
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.050
those guys who put the tie around their head and it becomes like,
you know,

198
00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:50.550
this is their big rebellion like that.

199
00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:53.620
That's who she cheapy that person with the fucking man tits.

200
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.180
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

201
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.810
<v 1>You know,
saying wildly inappropriate things to some fucking intern.</v>

202
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.000
Uh,
just walks into work on Monday.
Just has to not look at anybody.

203
00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:10.060
Just close the door to his office and be like,
Oh God,
how long,

204
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.920
how long do I have to just sit,
feel the shame of,
of my behavior.

205
00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:18.700
Last Saturday night.
Um,
anyways,
there was another battle going on.

206
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:19.570
It was the battle

207
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.880
between the city of Boston and the city of Pittsburgh.
I don't know,

208
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:26.980
with all the screaming and yelling this fucking weekend,

209
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.540
I don't know if anybody noticed that.
Uh,
yesterday

210
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.550
in the sporting world,
the world that you can actually trust.

211
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.930
Um,
well,
they do give a lot of speeches,

212
00:12:39.931 --> 00:12:42.420
a lot of locker room speeches and everybody actually is on the same team.

213
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.620
Then they go,
I'll go out together and they try to achieve a goal.
Um,

214
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:48.930
<v 0>okay.</v>

215
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.680
<v 1>The Boston Bruins and the Pittsburgh penguins played each other on the same day</v>

216
00:12:52.681 --> 00:12:57.040
that the new England patriots and the Pittsburgh Steeler place.
Now I know it,

217
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.000
if you're not from this country or if you just can't,
you can be like,
well,

218
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.450
I mean it's a really,
do Boston is the Bruins not the patriot.

219
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.680
You guys know why the Patriots called the New England patriots?

220
00:13:07.681 --> 00:13:10.140
This is really actually a sad tale about this team.

221
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.180
We were the Boston patriots initially.

222
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:18.220
And what ended up happening was,
uh,
because you know,

223
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.910
they were in the AFL and it was an upstart league and,
uh,

224
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.520
all the talent,
a lot of talent was in the NFL.
Nobody really gave a fuck.

225
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:32.130
So in an effort to try to get more fans,
they switched from Boston.

226
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.200
They thought if they said New England,

227
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.790
they could get enough people trickling down from Maine,
New Hampshire,
Vermont,

228
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.520
up from Connecticut and Rhode Island.

229
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:43.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

230
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.120
<v 1>To maybe fill up a little bit of Fenway fucking park or ever they played</v>

231
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.140
Nickerson fields,
all these places where they played.
That's the reason why.

232
00:13:51.141 --> 00:13:53.810
So anyways,
so the first game,

233
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.110
the Bruins come out right.

234
00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.800
And they played Pittsburgh and for half the game we were doing all right.

235
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.720
You know,
after half the game,
it was fucking two to one.

236
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.860
And then I don't know what happened.
I don't know.
I didn't know what happened.

237
00:14:09.861 --> 00:14:14.300
I didn't see the game.
I was,
uh,
I was,
you know,

238
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.270
doing some other shit,
but I was watching it on my phone.
It was like two to one.

239
00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:19.850
I'm like,
all right.
The hanging in there,
hanging in there and then I fucking,

240
00:14:19.851 --> 00:14:23.900
I don't know,
I felt like I walked around for 20 minutes.
I look back at my phone,

241
00:14:23.901 --> 00:14:27.920
it was like five to one.
We got fucking smoked.
So,

242
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.200
you know,
people giving me Shit on Twitter going,
uh,

243
00:14:31.201 --> 00:14:35.660
there's one same thing's going to empty patriot.
And I gotta be honest with you.

244
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:40.990
I had no feeling one way or the other about that game yesterday as far as like

245
00:14:41.451 --> 00:14:44.090
a,
you know,
what do you think's going to happen?
I had no fucking idea.

246
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.730
Nothing was going to surprise me.
Um,

247
00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.400
if the Steelers came in and beat us,
it wasn't going to surprise me.

248
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:54.590
Um,
after the way,
you know,

249
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.440
I would just look bad against the Texans and I was not,
you know,

250
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.710
didn't have too much confidence in our offensive line.

251
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:03.950
And I know Pittsburgh always has like a great defensive line in that type of

252
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:08.510
shit.
So I didn't know what the fuck was going to happen.
So I was very surprised.

253
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.600
It,
um,
you know how well everything worked yesterday and uh,

254
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.050
just fucking amazing.

255
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.110
And I was sitting there watching the game on this hospital TV,

256
00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:24.500
you know,
and the TV was so fucked up.

257
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.060
It was because,
uh,
you know,
that's fucking hospital TV dude.

258
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:29.761
Like it has like that.

259
00:15:29.761 --> 00:15:32.510
You don't like those waves they used to do when someone was going into like a

260
00:15:32.511 --> 00:15:36.580
fucking,
like a dream sequence.
That's what it was too.

261
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.770
That's what it was like.
So I couldn't even tell what quarter it was a,

262
00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:42.610
how much time was left and thank God they kept saying what the fuck had score

263
00:15:42.611 --> 00:15:44.060
was cause I can barely see it.

264
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:45.420
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

265
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.400
<v 1>And um,</v>

266
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.880
that's all I did was in the hospital and I was just fucking watching football

267
00:15:50.881 --> 00:15:55.160
games on this fucking TV.
They just had like these lines just,

268
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.110
they weren't doing like the bull,
the wavy thing.
They would just sort of,
um,

269
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.530
you know,
just going from left to right.
We'll just,

270
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.770
and they just just kept fucking going.
I couldn't see what was going on.
So,

271
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.530
but fortunately I was sitting there and I watched the game with my brand new

272
00:16:11.531 --> 00:16:12.380
baby dog

273
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.410
laying on my chest for the old game was one of the fucking greatest,

274
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.430
arguably the greatest moment of my life.
Did I mentioned that?

275
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.920
Did I forget to bring that up?

276
00:16:23.921 --> 00:16:28.360
That old fucking Billy the kid list is finally a father.
Um,
yeah,

277
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.840
my wife gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.
She's perfect.

278
00:16:31.841 --> 00:16:35.590
She's absolutely gorgeous.
And I'll spare you all the cliches,

279
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.050
you know,
that everybody says.
Um,

280
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.570
because one thing I really did learn throughout this whole process,

281
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.830
which is really as the guy you're observing this amazing thing

282
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.850
is that,
uh,
you know,
just don't tell too many fucking people.

283
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.880
That's all I can tell you.
You know,
I know I said it on the fucking podcast,

284
00:16:56.881 --> 00:16:58.860
but I don't run into you guys.
I mean in your life,

285
00:16:58.861 --> 00:17:02.700
don't tell too many people you have in a fucking kid because I swear to God the

286
00:17:02.701 --> 00:17:06.300
amount of misinformation or even if it's good information,

287
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.840
it's like a lot of people don't know how to fucking convey information in a

288
00:17:09.841 --> 00:17:13.410
compelling way.
So you're just sitting there just smiling,

289
00:17:13.411 --> 00:17:17.070
thinking when is this going to be over?
And um,

290
00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.940
yeah,
people will fucking,
it's so nuts.
They,

291
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.180
whatever they went through,

292
00:17:24.181 --> 00:17:26.370
they tell you that that's what you're going to go through.

293
00:17:26.371 --> 00:17:30.390
So you end up going in there and you have everybody else's experience in your

294
00:17:30.391 --> 00:17:33.480
fucking head swimming around when the reality is

295
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.780
<v 0>okay,</v>

296
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.050
<v 1>this is not their experience.
It's your experience.</v>

297
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.300
And however you react to whatever you do,

298
00:17:40.301 --> 00:17:44.080
whatever you think and all that is fine.
It's your fucking experience.

299
00:17:44.081 --> 00:17:46.600
Cause I was sitting there almost having like an outer body experience thinking

300
00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:49.000
like,
why aren't I feeling this?
Why am I feeling this?

301
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.390
Instead of that I thought I was going to feel this and blah,
blah,
blah.

302
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:56.220
And I was literally in my head for like fucking,
I don't know,
like 15 minutes.

303
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.370
Um,
so many ways.
Um,

304
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.130
that was my fuck.
My was my weekend.

305
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:06.990
I became a father and I got to see the Patriots go to their unprecedented ninth

306
00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.970
Superbowl.
Um,

307
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:15.620
so my wife and my beautiful daughter come home today I have to do the Jimmy

308
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.700
Kimmel show because I'm,

309
00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:22.701
I'm promoting my next standup special that comes out on Netflix on January 31st

310
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.810
taped at the Ryman theater in Nashville,
Tennessee.

311
00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:29.973
<v 3>MMM.</v>

312
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:31.981
<v 1>You know,</v>

313
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:36.510
which is home of the original Grand Ole Opry and a legendary place I got to play

314
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:39.270
at a number of years ago when I did,
uh,
Vince Vaughn,

315
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:43.080
wild west comedy tour festival thing they have out there in Nashville.

316
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.680
And of course,
like every performer who goes there,

317
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:49.050
you just fall in love with the place.
It's just a magical place.

318
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:52.450
So I got to do my special there and um,

319
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:54.471
you know,

320
00:18:54.471 --> 00:18:57.890
very proud of this one and if you guys can get the word out and just let people

321
00:18:57.891 --> 00:19:02.300
know that,
um,
that,
uh,
that I got a special coming out.

322
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.950
It's on January 31st.
Um,
I don't know how the ratings work on Netflix.

323
00:19:06.951 --> 00:19:10.730
I don't know,
but basically people got to watch it.

324
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.970
If you watch it then it comes up on the thing where people can actually see it

325
00:19:13.971 --> 00:19:17.560
in the Sea of like 20 million shows that they have on that,
um,

326
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.940
worldwide network.
So,
uh,
please tweet about it,

327
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.270
Facebook about it,
social media about it and all that type of stuff.

328
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.780
And I hope you guys enjoy it.
Um,
I'm really proud of this special,

329
00:19:29.781 --> 00:19:34.100
I love the way it came out and all that stuff.
So that's what I got going on in.

330
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:39.020
Uh,
my wife and daughter come home tonight.
Um,
so that's it.

331
00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.120
This is the last time my house is going to be quiet,

332
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.040
but I've been having a great time so far.

333
00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:46.400
I got my fucking diaper changing thing down.

334
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.670
My swaddle game is that like I'd say,
you know,

335
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.830
it's about at 80%.
That's like the biggest fucking thing.

336
00:19:54.831 --> 00:19:58.940
I suck at burping.
I'm not good at debt.
You know what I mean?

337
00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.780
Cause I mean there's only so hard you can go on a baby's back before you think

338
00:20:02.781 --> 00:20:05.930
like,
am I,
am I like beating a baby right now?
And I don't want to do this.

339
00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.320
<v 2>So,
um,</v>

340
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.440
<v 1>anyways.
Anyways,
oh I forgot this too.</v>

341
00:20:15.441 --> 00:20:18.440
I got to see my apologies once again.

342
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.670
Two weeks in a row to the Atlanta Falcons.

343
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.750
I sorry.
So sorry

344
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.970
<v 2>that I doubt</v>

345
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.310
<v 1>Jesus Christ,
the Atlanta Falcons look like fucking world beaters.</v>

346
00:20:35.311 --> 00:20:38.880
I had been converted in two short weeks.
I went from,

347
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.900
isn't this the fucking team that had to pump in crowd noise because it was so

348
00:20:46.081 --> 00:20:51.081
quiet at their fucking stadium did they didn't have to do that a couple of years

349
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.450
ago.
Didn't they get caught doing that?

350
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:55.990
And everybody laughed because it wasn't the New England patriots cheating.

351
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.890
So then it wasn't a big federal offense.
Didn't that happen?

352
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.760
Isn't that the franchise we're talking about here where they got some little

353
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:07.990
slap on the fucking risks where the Patriots would have got 12 zillion dollars

354
00:21:07.991 --> 00:21:11.770
in fucking fine then in in law stuck a bunch of first round draft picks.

355
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.310
I know.
It's okay.
It's okay.
We got,

356
00:21:15.311 --> 00:21:18.100
we got a little upset for a second cause we saw a little red in the uniform.

357
00:21:18.101 --> 00:21:21.130
Then look all that's not the patriots.
So then it's just sort of funny.

358
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:26.740
Isn't that this franchise?
Um,
now look at the place.
The place is packed.

359
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.370
The place is packed.
Everybody's loud.
And I got to tell you something right now,

360
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.500
80% of the people in that fucking stadium should have been hang in there.

361
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.730
Hang in their fucking heads in shame because where were you?

362
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:42.640
Where were you when they were bad?
Huh?
You know where you,

363
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:44.440
where you got damn Georgia fans.

364
00:21:44.441 --> 00:21:47.320
You can't even show up to the Braves when they make the fucking playoffs.

365
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:51.600
You can't even sell out your fucking stadium.
I don't,

366
00:21:51.601 --> 00:21:54.750
I don't get Atlanta when it comes to that type of shit.
I don't,
I don't get it.

367
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.380
Like they just stand there.
Not a pro city fucking town.

368
00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:03.170
They've lost two hockey teams,
you know what I mean?

369
00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.730
Twice divorced.

370
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.760
They had the Atlanta flames.

371
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:10.460
<v 0>Okay.</v>

372
00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:10.880
<v 1>Right.</v>

373
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.810
Wasn't enough to have Bobby Orr and all these great guys from the 70s comment to

374
00:22:14.811 --> 00:22:18.620
their town.
They didn't give a shit.
They were down the street.

375
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:23.120
Right between them.
Hedges,
Hey,
wait,
watching some fucking college football.

376
00:22:23.121 --> 00:22:25.940
That's what the fuck they were doing.
And what are the,
what the NHL say?
I,
well,

377
00:22:25.941 --> 00:22:28.910
what,
what,
what,
what,
what were we thinking?
Let's get the fuck Outta here.

378
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.810
And they went to Calgary and became the Calgary flames.
Right?

379
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:38.120
And then for whatever reasons,
because they're the NHL,
you know,

380
00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.630
because they're stubborn.
God dammit,

381
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.850
we're going to put another team and they're 20 fucking years later.
Here you go.

382
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.000
The Atlanta thrashers,
which I've never done it.

383
00:22:47.001 --> 00:22:50.180
I didn't know what the fuck that is.
Thrashes waiver thrashing.

384
00:22:50.181 --> 00:22:53.750
I just picture somebody's shaking their kid,
you know what I mean?

385
00:22:53.751 --> 00:22:56.210
And you're sitting there in the car next to him in the parking lot going,
ah,

386
00:22:56.211 --> 00:23:00.440
at what point do I intervene?
Um,
that should have been their logo.
Right?

387
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.410
Some adults shaken a toddler.
I know that's a bad image,
but it's a tough game.

388
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:11.360
It's a tough fucking game.
And what happened?
You didn't show up to those either.

389
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:16.580
So they,
they,
they fucking move them to Winnipeg.
Um,

390
00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.140
I'm just fucking with you guys.

391
00:23:18.141 --> 00:23:21.260
And now all of a sudden now they're great and everybody shows up.
You know,

392
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:25.610
everybody's fucking pointed.
They had everybody's,
you know,
fucking doing that,

393
00:23:25.611 --> 00:23:27.410
that millennial thing.

394
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:32.810
When your team's doing well and you start fucking vigorously nodding and turning

395
00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:36.710
around at the rest of the crowd.
Ah,
that one drives me up the fucking wall.

396
00:23:36.711 --> 00:23:37.640
The nodding thing

397
00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:44.030
that I think that's sign language for all day.
Um,

398
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.220
anyways,
Jesus Christ,
that fucking team,
if there's any justice in the world,

399
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:52.100
they're going to go in his Superbowl favorites,
but they're not.

400
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.850
And what's great is there,
they're going to be able to

401
00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:57.953
<v 3>mmm.</v>

402
00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.460
<v 1>Use that as um,</v>

403
00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:02.820
<v 3>yeah.</v>

404
00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.400
<v 1>You know,
whatever,
whatever they say to get them hyped.</v>

405
00:24:05.401 --> 00:24:07.740
They don't believe in us and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

406
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.530
It's not going to be disrespected the falcons.
What it is,

407
00:24:10.531 --> 00:24:13.950
is when the super bowl comes around is when a bunch of people who don't watch

408
00:24:13.951 --> 00:24:16.650
sports show up and they're going to show up and be like,

409
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.030
who's playing in the game?
Oh,
Tom Brady,
the Patriots.

410
00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.670
I know who this team is.
The Falcons did.

411
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.750
Are they from Tennessee?
Like people who don't know sports,

412
00:24:27.751 --> 00:24:31.170
we'll know the Patriots and they'll just throw 100 bucks in the game and they'll

413
00:24:31.171 --> 00:24:32.040
put it on the patriots.

414
00:24:32.041 --> 00:24:35.940
Cause that's a fucking team may know which affects the Line Cause Vegas tries to

415
00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:37.470
get money on both sides of the ball.

416
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.480
So that's what's it going to and that's what's going to end up happening.

417
00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.380
That's why back with that year when the patriots lost to the giants,
which one?

418
00:24:43.381 --> 00:24:46.590
The first time when uh,
we were undefeated,

419
00:24:46.591 --> 00:24:48.830
that's why we were 17 fucking point favorites.

420
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:52.980
Not because we were 17 point favorites cause every mouth breathing dumb cunt

421
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:57.180
that went to Vegas put money on the undefeated team and they were trying to get

422
00:24:57.181 --> 00:24:58.014
money on this.

423
00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.213
<v 3>Um,</v>

424
00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.660
<v 1>the other side of the ball,
and if you don't fucking believe me,</v>

425
00:25:02.661 --> 00:25:06.740
a month earlier we paid,
we played the giants we want unlike at the last drive,

426
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:11.270
the last second and we let up like 33 fucking points in one by like three or

427
00:25:11.271 --> 00:25:12.104
four,

428
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.480
how a month later you become a 17 point favorite to a team.

429
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:21.200
A month earlier.
You played in all only one by four points.
If you can achieve,

430
00:25:21.201 --> 00:25:23.810
you can figure out the fucking map on that one.
It's beyond me.
So yeah,

431
00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.950
I'm predicting that the Patriots are going to go in,

432
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:32.330
they're going to be considered the favorites and uh,

433
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.111
but they're not,

434
00:25:33.111 --> 00:25:36.200
I think the Falcons are the favorites and I think this is their year.

435
00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.620
I think they're a team of destiny.
Okay.

436
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.610
Now people who are into superstition know exactly what I'm doing.

437
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.970
Cause you're thinking,
hey bill,
you're a patriots fan.
How the fuck would you,

438
00:25:46.971 --> 00:25:51.320
how would the hell could you ever say that?
I got a system.
Your people,

439
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.900
when the falcons played Seattle,
I said Seattle was going to win.

440
00:25:56.110 --> 00:26:00.820
And who won those dirty birds of Georgia dirty,
filthy in bread.

441
00:26:00.821 --> 00:26:03.580
Fucking birds in Atlanta,
right.

442
00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:08.080
Download birds of Atlanta,
of Atlanta,
Georgia.
Right.

443
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:13.320
Then last week they go to play Aaron fucking Rogers and the Green Bay packers.

444
00:26:13.841 --> 00:26:15.340
And what did I say?
Ah,
you know,

445
00:26:15.341 --> 00:26:18.820
I had a little more respect that I'm going to go with the Green Bay packers

446
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.360
and what are those dirty stinking filthy fucking birds too.

447
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:26.800
<v 3>Okay.</v>

448
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.760
<v 1>They went in there and Greenbay got their asses.
Who</v>

449
00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:37.920
by those glorified pigeons,
right by those fucking seagulls,

450
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:42.060
by those filthy dirty birds,
that's how much fucking goes on in Atlanta.

451
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.700
You know what I mean?
Even though like logo has a fucking STD right now.
Sorry,

452
00:26:45.701 --> 00:26:48.350
I was a bad joke.
Anyways.
Um,

453
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:53.220
so I've picked against him two times and both times the Falcons went,

454
00:26:53.221 --> 00:26:56.190
so now that plane,
my team in the Superbowl,

455
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.620
so here's my philosophy.

456
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:03.990
Now I'm going to pick Atlanta and I'm going to say that they're gonna win.
Um,

457
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.490
I gotta be honest with you.
If Atlanta's getting points,
you're out of your mind,

458
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:12.150
not the fucking take it.
I think personally,
they're fucking defenses.

459
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.110
Unbelievable.
That fucking Julio Jones is like,
I don't know,

460
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:19.330
like he doesn't even look like a,
he looks like he's,
he's,

461
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.820
he looks at a full grown adult playing with like high school kids that fucking

462
00:27:23.821 --> 00:27:24.130
pass.

463
00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.780
He caught and he just started shredding tacklers and then that last guy gave him

464
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:31.650
like two or three stiff arms.
I get Jab,
get the fuck out of my face.

465
00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:35.400
Go Fuck yourself right there,
Fred.
Touchdown.
Um,

466
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.110
that guy's a major fucking problem.

467
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.660
They're running back is a major fucking problem.

468
00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:44.040
I'm obviously Matty ice looking like the MVP of the fucking lead.

469
00:27:44.041 --> 00:27:48.030
They get the three headed monster.
Thank gone on our offense and their defense.

470
00:27:48.031 --> 00:27:49.590
I don't know anybody's fucking name.

471
00:27:49.591 --> 00:27:54.510
All I know is the flying around the field fucking up every team that I think is

472
00:27:54.511 --> 00:27:58.560
going to beat them.
So
if they're going to get points,

473
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.260
um,
that's a pretty good bet if you ask me.
So we'll see.
We'll see what happens.

474
00:28:03.261 --> 00:28:06.500
You know what Bella checks going to do?
He's going to double fucking Julio.

475
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:10.220
Joe Daddy's going to try to do it then I'll let,

476
00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:14.710
should I have no can idea what's going to happen.
I have no idea.
Um,

477
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:18.960
I've been busy and I'm so happy that my wife is no longer pregnant.

478
00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.580
You know,
other dads out there know what it's like in that final fucking,

479
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.570
the final fucking month is just so brutal where it's just like they are so

480
00:28:27.571 --> 00:28:30.120
uncomfortable and there's literally nothing you can do.

481
00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.140
A one of the most helpless feelings I've ever had.
And,
uh,

482
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:39.430
I'm just so happy that now she's on the other side of that.
Uh,

483
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.400
I was as thrilled for her as it was for myself becoming a dad,

484
00:28:44.401 --> 00:28:47.730
just that she date that was over.
Um,

485
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.730
so Jesus Christ,

486
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:53.880
like I already knew my wife was tough considering the amount of like,
I,
you,

487
00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:56.700
I lose most fucking arguments to our cause she just,

488
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.240
but watching it go through what the fuck she went through.
Jesus Christ,

489
00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:04.920
whole level,
new level of respect for her toughness.

490
00:29:04.921 --> 00:29:06.930
You know what I mean?
Like my wife,

491
00:29:06.931 --> 00:29:11.700
what she went through could literally watch like a UFC event.
It'd be like,
yeah,

492
00:29:11.701 --> 00:29:12.600
these guys are pussies.

493
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.750
So anyways,
where I gotta I gotta read some fucking advertising here.
Don't,

494
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:25.800
I'm sitting here running my,
Yep.
Um,
all right.
All right.
Where are we going here?

495
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.110
Where are we going to type in my password?
Sorry.

496
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.100
There we go.
All right,
let's get to the,
Oh,
here we go.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Oh,

497
00:29:38.101 --> 00:29:40.920
you know what?
I forgot to bring up.
By the way,
remind me,

498
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:44.290
I'm going to talk to you about this move that Aaron Rodgers does as a QB.

499
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:46.870
I didn't see him do it all day yesterday.
I got to talk about,

500
00:29:46.871 --> 00:29:51.570
because I might forget he's got this fucking move.
It's brilliant,

501
00:29:51.571 --> 00:29:55.470
right?
He,
he,
when they do like a seven step drop,
right?

502
00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:01.280
This people rushing in from either side and the tackles a blocking them and you

503
00:30:03.511 --> 00:30:08.511
see that they're going to get around them on the outside and Aaron Rodgers is

504
00:30:09.151 --> 00:30:12.870
just gone far back enough where that's the line to sack him.

505
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.520
So the move all quarterbacks do in that moment is they then step back up into

506
00:30:17.521 --> 00:30:18.354
the pocket.

507
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

508
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.100
<v 1>So those guys,
you know,</v>

509
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.500
<v 0>okay.</v>

510
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.710
<v 1>Basically the goal around the outside or have to try to go to the inside and</v>

511
00:30:25.711 --> 00:30:30.660
then they're back in front of the tackle.
Okay.
But you know,

512
00:30:30.661 --> 00:30:31.920
sometimes they still break through.

513
00:30:31.921 --> 00:30:36.750
What he does is he starts to step up and he gets between the tackles.

514
00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:40.680
So then those guys who are rushing to the outside then try to make a move to go

515
00:30:40.681 --> 00:30:42.390
to the insight.
And then he immediately,

516
00:30:42.391 --> 00:30:44.310
the second they both commit to go back inside.

517
00:30:44.311 --> 00:30:49.311
He pops back to the fucking outside and he actually with that movement has his

518
00:30:49.801 --> 00:30:53.040
tackles lot lined up with their men.
It's fucking amazing.

519
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:56.880
He does it all the fucking time.
And you know,
just sat watching Tom Brady,

520
00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:00.510
Jesus Christ.
Did you see that first sack?
The Steeler had were like,

521
00:31:00.511 --> 00:31:05.040
I swear to God it was like Tom,
the batteries,
if he was like a robot,

522
00:31:05.041 --> 00:31:06.660
they shorted out for half a second.

523
00:31:06.661 --> 00:31:10.710
He's just didn't see the guy and then he kinda did like so bloody kind of

524
00:31:10.711 --> 00:31:12.750
freaked out.
Then he spun around and laid down.

525
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.630
He looked like a deer in headlights on that one.

526
00:31:15.631 --> 00:31:19.680
He's just not the most mobile fucking guy in the world,
but everybody knows that.

527
00:31:19.681 --> 00:31:23.970
So,
um,
I don't,
that move is to shit.

528
00:31:23.971 --> 00:31:27.990
And here's something I don't understand that no wide receiver ever does.

529
00:31:27.991 --> 00:31:30.780
You know,
when they do like a fucking reverse,
double reverse or whatever,

530
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:35.100
and you know,
when the defense is string in and out and it's not going to work,

531
00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:40.080
you can see it's not going to work.
You know and it's just dying a slow death.

532
00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:43.080
I don't mean when you know it doesn't work and the receiver gets the right
there.

533
00:31:43.081 --> 00:31:46.830
Fred obviously tuck the ball away,
but how come when it's dying a slow death.

534
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.040
Why did they start doing this?
Oj fucking dancing around shit.

535
00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:53.730
Why don't they just throw the ball away for an incomplete rather than taking the

536
00:31:53.731 --> 00:31:57.680
fucking five to seven yard loss?
Has anybody ever seen anybody do that?

537
00:31:57.681 --> 00:31:58.620
That that is my,

538
00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:03.980
that's my football question for this week is anybody seen a wide receiver honor

539
00:32:04.531 --> 00:32:09.240
averse and it wasn't fucking working out of fucking nowhere,

540
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.630
right?
Has anybody seen a wide receiver?

541
00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.050
Just basically do that play as well is all I'm asking for.
The love of God.

542
00:32:18.051 --> 00:32:19.910
Can Somebody fucking tell me that they've seen that?

543
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:23.690
I don't understand why they don't do that.
Why?
Why the fuck would you do that?

544
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.230
They need it.
You don't get hit.
You don't lose a bunch of yard bill.
We all right?

545
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:32.420
All right.
Let me read the advertising here for this week.
All right.
Oh Shit,

546
00:32:32.421 --> 00:32:35.470
everybody but up,
up,
up.

547
00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:39.900
Biondi is beyond the fees go up to the bowl.
Doo,

548
00:32:39.901 --> 00:32:41.050
Doo Doo.
To me,

549
00:32:41.051 --> 00:32:46.051
Andy's Biondi and just what you're told by Bill Bell love fucking check.

550
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.580
He's the greatest fucking couch.

551
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.740
I don't give a heck that he stole some signs and the flight it up ball.

552
00:32:54.741 --> 00:32:58.910
At the end of the day,
those are misdemeanors,
so stopping and currents,

553
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.330
he's the greatest coach of all time.

554
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:07.610
He really is.
He's the greatest coach of all fucking time.
You know what I mean?

555
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:10.660
Tom Brady,
I swear to God,
I'm thinking,

556
00:33:10.661 --> 00:33:13.250
I'm finally going to say it might be the greatest quarterback of all time.

557
00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:19.010
This is their seventh fucking Superbowl over 15 fucking years.

558
00:33:19.011 --> 00:33:20.150
You go back in time,
you named

559
00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:25.890
the steel has had their heyday from 74 to 80 and then it was,
oh

560
00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.970
right.
People get old,
people get old,

561
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.640
they fucking move on and then you gotta get a new group of people and then it

562
00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:36.280
just not as good as the other people.

563
00:33:36.281 --> 00:33:40.120
It's so fucking hard to just keep it going where you stay at that level of

564
00:33:40.121 --> 00:33:42.760
success.
Forget about now with the free agency,

565
00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:48.370
the a league parody and all of that shit that these coaches now have to deal

566

00:35:18.011 --> 00:35:19.910
he'll have his face on it.
You know what I mean?

589
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.280
I still don't get the matching pair of,
she must,
you know,

590
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.630

You don't have to like,

I don't understand this campaign.
Just going to keep reading it.

All right?
Me undies,
those that your special,
someone deserves a special fabric,

595
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:46.800
which is why their underwear is made exclusively out of modal,
modal,
a fabric.

596
00:35:46.801 --> 00:35:48.810
What the touch three times softer than cotton.

597
00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.060

602
00:36:01.771 --> 00:36:04.950
I'm getting claustrophobic.

How many more of these fucking things?

634
00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:07.160
Two more,
right?
stamps.com always the fucking headliner,
I believe,
right?

635
00:38:07.161 --> 00:38:11.370
They were always the last guys.
What do we got left?
What do we got?
Low Code.

Let's,

Okay.
Blue Apron.

637
00:38:14.361 --> 00:38:17.450
Everybody.
Oh,
you're hungry.
We'll sit the fuck down and listen to this.

638
00:38:17.451 --> 00:38:19.460
Not all ingredients are created equal,
fresh,

639
00:38:19.461 --> 00:38:21.380
high quality ingredients make a real difference.

640
00:38:21.381 --> 00:38:23.900
So it's important to know where your food comes from.

641
00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.110
You know those people across the street that always wears sandals and they're

642
00:38:27.111 --> 00:38:30.440
always going down to farmer's markets,
right?
You want to go down there,

643
00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:32.090
you want to get the good fucking ingredients,

644
00:38:32.091 --> 00:38:35.890
but you don't want to go down there smelling all those feats,
right?
Feats.
Yeah.

645
00:38:35.891 --> 00:38:39.980
If the all them feet.
Thank God.
Well,
what does this the fucking place style?

646
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.700
I don't want to smell that shit when I'm looking at fucking a Rutabaga.

647
00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:47.440
All right.
Blue Apron.
Talk about your personal experience.
Blue Apron.

648
00:38:47.441 --> 00:38:52.300
I have no experience with them.
Okay.
I don't fucking test out the products.

649
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:56.860
My,
my fucking podcast guy,
Andrew tested him out.
He tested it out.

650
00:38:56.861 --> 00:39:00.820
He said it was fucking delicious.
All right,
and I trust that man's taste buds.

651

All right.
For less than $10 per person,

652
00:39:04.741 --> 00:39:07.000

They're thieves and it's squash along with proportion ingredients to make

657
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:22.930

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:34.580
Why won't we eat horses in this country?
Will lead fucking cow a right.

661
00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.110
We'll suckle from a cow will eat it's fucking ball,
his brother,

662
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:44.510
but horses,
we won't eat them,
but we'll get on their backs and ride them.

663
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.280
I think that that's what it is.
Somebody gives you a ride to the store.

664
00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:51.080
You can't turn around and eat them.
You know what I mean?

665
00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:54.260
Unless you Jeffrey Dahmer.
Blue Apron has several delivery options,

666
00:39:54.261 --> 00:39:55.690

All right,

680
00:40:39.361 --> 00:40:43.020

682
00:40:47.221 --> 00:40:50.130

That means trips to the post office.</v>

690
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:25.630

that's not fucking easy thing to do.
I don't know if,

706
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.300
can I tell you I came out if I told you then on Thursday,
I think I did.
I did.

707
00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:34.620
I finally figured it out.
My recipe.
You got to slow cook it for 90 minutes,

708
00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:38.190
not 60 minutes.
Or I have to learn how to tenderize meat a little bit better.

709
00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.560
I need to learn at a beat the meat a little.

710
00:42:40.561 --> 00:42:44.130
You get it at a little jerk up joke there.
Sorry.
All right,
let's,
um,

711
00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.500
did I talk about everything I wanted to talk about in the podcast?

712
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:51.550
I believe I did.
I believe I did.
Um,

713
00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.550
you don't fucking layers is,

714
00:42:54.551 --> 00:42:58.790
my wife keeps telling me to go to the firehouse to make sure the fire station to

715
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:02.330
make sure that the,
the,
the kid's seat is put in correctly,

716
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.350
which I think it is.
I mean,
I fucking good,
but I think a bunch of,
you know,

717
00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.960
I try to rip it out.
I couldn't rip it out,
you know what I mean?

718
00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:12.590
And I think my fucking arm,
so just as strong as a two car accident,
right.

719
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.820
So I've gone over to the firehouse twice,

720
00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.310
the one in my neighborhood.
I've been over there to fucking times.

721
00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:25.440
Every time I've ever gone by that park and firehouse,
the trucks are there.

722
00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.930
Somebody has fucking Washington.
Every time I go by the house,

723
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:32.020
the two fucking fire house,
nobody's there,
trucks are gone.

724
00:43:32.021 --> 00:43:34.360
I'm ringing the doorbell and there's nobody there.

725
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.960
And I'm sitting there thinking,
well,

726
00:43:36.961 --> 00:43:40.290
maybe at least the guy who makes the fucking Chili,
he doesn't hang back.

727
00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:43.110
The second time I went there to the fucking TV was on.

728
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:47.610
So I dunno.
I've been driving around in my wife's car,

729
00:43:47.611 --> 00:43:51.270
which I didn't like it first.
You know,
all these fucking cars,
this shape,

730
00:43:51.271 --> 00:43:54.810
like dinner rolls,
they all look the exact fucking same.
And uh,

731
00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.650
but now I actually actually kinda like it.
You know,
it took me a minute,
you know,

732
00:43:58.651 --> 00:44:02.340
it's a fucking Bronx car.
What are you gonna do?
Um,
anyways,
let's,

733
00:44:02.341 --> 00:44:03.720
let me read some of the,
uh,

734
00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:07.950
the questions for this week that I'd fucking copy and paste them that I at least

735
00:44:07.951 --> 00:44:12.360
do that for the love of Christ.
Now,
I didn't,

736
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:15.690
of course not.
Why would you do that bill?
If you did something like that,

737
00:44:15.691 --> 00:44:18.660
then that would mean that you were actually fucking paying attention.
All right,

738
00:44:18.661 --> 00:44:23.470
let's just read them from here.
Okay.
Weight loss slash fat shaming.
Hey there,

739
00:44:23.471 --> 00:44:26.490
Billy bassinet.
I actually know what a bassinet is now.

740
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.040
A congrats on pregnancy.
Uh,

741
00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:32.820
and you and the Lovey Neil will make pretty good parents.
That's hilarious.

742
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:36.270
I'm emailing you because I wanted to thank you and Joe Rogan for all of your

743
00:44:36.271 --> 00:44:39.990
shit and enabled me to lose 120 pounds.

744
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:45.360
That's a whole person I started back in November of 2015 through.
That's amazing.

745
00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:50.910
And I've kept it off and continue to get to my goal of 220 pounds.

746
00:44:50.911 --> 00:44:54.960
I was three 57 when I started.
He goes,

747
00:44:54.961 --> 00:44:56.100
that's a fucking plane.

748
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:04.910
Well,
it gets a gun,
isn't it?
Three 57 magnum.
Uh,
anyway,

749
00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.780
thanks for,
uh,
for the shame and motivation.

750
00:45:08.781 --> 00:45:12.950
You freckled con good luck and best wishes to you and your growing family 2017

751
00:45:12.951 --> 00:45:16.220
in the coming years.
Oh,
and by the way,
go fuck yourself.
Uh,

752
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:20.210
in the best way possible.
Think Stranger.
I,

753
00:45:20.211 --> 00:45:23.240
you know what that meets anyways.
Oh dude,
that's great.
I'll,

754
00:45:23.241 --> 00:45:25.970
I could use some advice because I've been,
um,

755
00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:28.370
during the last few weeks,

756
00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:34.010
I should really say like the last two months of Nia score deal is what I'm going

757
00:45:34.011 --> 00:45:37.760
to call it.
Because it was not a,
like pregnancy is a fucking ordeal.

758
00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:43.070
You're sick the first fucking third and then there's this,
you know,

759
00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:46.520
I have this storm the second trimester and then the,
it's just like,

760
00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:48.650
it's fucking horrible.
You know,

761
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.220
if you don't have any sympathy for your wife during the pregnancy,

762
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.650
you're not in love with her.
You fucking married the wrong person.

763
00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:56.900
I can tell you that.
So anyways,
um,

764
00:45:58.210 --> 00:45:58.710
<v 0>okay.</v>

765
00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:01.020
<v 1>Anyways,
yeah,
I've been,
I put on some,
I put on a little bit of weight,</v>

766
00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:03.810
nothing too crazy.
I can't pit in the fucking elliptical,

767
00:46:03.811 --> 00:46:07.020
but I just kept making comfort food.
Um,

768
00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.650
and then what would happen was,
you know,
she eat a little bit of,
it's sort,

769
00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:11.730
sorta like it,

770
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:14.850
and then all of a sudden would just be totally for whatever reason,

771
00:46:14.851 --> 00:46:18.150
hormonally would be totally turned off by it.
Like the next fucking day.

772
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:21.120
And I made enough for two people and I'm not going to throw it out,

773
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:26.060
you know what I mean?
So I got to fucking,
I got to finish it.
You know,

774
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.800
I ate almost a whole shepherd's pie myself.

775
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:33.630
If this beef bridgewell she,
she goes too heavy.
She couldn't deal with it.

776
00:46:33.631 --> 00:46:36.930
So yeah,
he's supposed to have red meat a couple of times a month.

777
00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:38.580
I've had it four times this week.

778
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.940
Um,
but you know what,
I finished the day with the salad.

779
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:49.620
I never make myself salads either.
Um,
I just,

780
00:46:49.621 --> 00:46:52.890
I just never know what the fuck to put in them.
You know what I mean?

781
00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:56.220
And I finally just,
I just started with basics,
right?
I go to the grocery store,

782
00:46:56.221 --> 00:46:57.180
this is what I've been doing lately.

783
00:46:57.181 --> 00:47:00.450
It's been working for me as I go there and I'd get that prewashed fucking

784
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:02.340
lettuce that they have in there,
you know,
cause

785
00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:03.660
<v 0>okay.</v>

786
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.493
<v 1>You know,
basically what happened,</v>

787
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.100
a few people had to die by unwashed fucking lettuce.
Now they wash it up for us.

788
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:09.420
So you get that shit.

789
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:10.960
<v 0>Okay,</v>

790
00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.890
<v 1>I get three different colored peppers,
green,
red and the orange.
Right.</v>

791
00:47:14.891 --> 00:47:17.470
I cut those fucking things up,
cut up some cucumbers,

792
00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.080
throw all of that in a bowl.

793
00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:24.910
Then I got some tomatoes on the vine in a bowl outside the fridge and a little

794
00:47:24.911 --> 00:47:25.900
parmesan cheese.

795
00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:30.670
And then I just have everything all chopped up and ready to go pre shredded

796
00:47:30.671 --> 00:47:33.400
fucking Palmer,
John and all that.
So then at night when I get hungry,

797
00:47:33.401 --> 00:47:36.430
before I do something stupid,
I just make a quick fucking salad,

798
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:40.270
a little bit of the Paul Newmans fucking Balsamic vinegarette on it.

799
00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.240
I make a face like I don't want to fucking eat this.

800
00:47:43.241 --> 00:47:46.380
And then a couple of bites in.
Yeah,
you're into it.
It's over.
You get it go.

801
00:47:46.381 --> 00:47:48.760
And it's like trying to fucking write a term paper back in the day.

802
00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:49.960
He kept putting it off,
putting it off.

803
00:47:49.961 --> 00:47:51.910
Then when you finally sat down and you just fucking did it.

804
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:55.020
Same thing with Dina Salad.
I try to do that.
You know,

805
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:56.800
if I'm going to eat past seven o'clock.

806
00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:58.453
<v 0>MMM.</v>

807
00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:01.140
<v 1>I tried to have that and then I have like a scotch.</v>

808
00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:08.490
It's the Ron Burgundy,
um,
diet or whatever.
Um,
all right.

809
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:12.420
Work Meeting.
Uh,
dear Billy red tank.

810
00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:17.490
That isn't the one that the clients I work with have a task me to share an

811
00:48:18.481 --> 00:48:23.290
inspirational quote or poem during our bimonthly team meeting.

812
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:24.124
Sorry,

813
00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:28.620
concept working with asked me to share an inspirational quote or poem during our

814
00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.220
bimonthly team meeting.
Oh my God.

815
00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.830
Well,
if there's ever a sign you've got to quit this fucking job.
Personally,

816
00:48:37.831 --> 00:48:41.280
I'd rather tell them to go fuck themselves,
but since this would be frowned upon,

817
00:48:41.281 --> 00:48:43.680
I find myself in need of your expertise.

818
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:47.610
Do you have any inspirational quotes that you can share with me?

819
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:53.120
So that I can keep pretending that I'm not dead inside.
Uh,

820
00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:53.350
dude,

821
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:56.620
you're not dead inside what you are as you're an intelligent human being who

822
00:48:56.621 --> 00:48:59.020
knows that this is silly and you're sick of being traded,

823
00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:00.550
treated like a fucking child.

824
00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:06.620
This is like some shit that like when I was still in school,
you know,

825
00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:09.590
and had to sit there with my hands folded on my desk.

826
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:14.240
Dude,
I swear to God,
the,

827
00:49:14.241 --> 00:49:19.241
the corporate world is so fucking cold and so out of touch with like how human

828
00:49:19.541 --> 00:49:23.350
beings even fucking work or they totally understand it.

829
00:49:23.351 --> 00:49:28.150
And this is how they just break your spirit.
You know what it is,

830
00:49:28.151 --> 00:49:31.320
is you probably,
you guys have these mind numbingly boring fucking

831
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.600
<v 0>jobs,
right?</v>

832
00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:38.060
<v 1>They probably don't pay enough money for you to be fucking excited by it.</v>

833
00:49:38.061 --> 00:49:40.610
So now what they're going to try to do is have you,
uh,

834
00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.153
<v 0>you know,</v>

835
00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:45.320
<v 1>go out and they won't even do it for you.</v>

836
00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:50.330
They won't even come up with like a fucking,
you know,
their own like little,
uh,

837
00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.840
you know,
like the Raiders just win baby.
You know what I mean?
The cubs.

838
00:49:53.841 --> 00:49:55.910
Let's play too.
They can't even come up with around this is,

839
00:49:55.911 --> 00:50:00.170
this is their fucking job.
Well,
look,

840
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.430
you know what you have to do,

841
00:50:01.431 --> 00:50:04.580
but what I would love for you to do is write your own fucking poem where it all

842
00:50:04.581 --> 00:50:08.570
rhymes and you just trashing this thing,
whatever the fuck this exercises,

843
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:12.320
what rhymes with clients.

844
00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:16.730
Let's see.

845
00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:24.440
One of the most exciting plays in baseball is when a speedy here lays down a

846
00:50:26.251 --> 00:50:30.890
bunt.
I am dead inside.

847
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:32.990
I don't like this job

848
00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.470
and certainly not working with you cunts.

849
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:44.310
Uh,
consider this my last fucking day.

850
00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:47.530
Don't worry,
I don't have a gun,

851
00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.560
but I would like to say fuck all of you and your mother's too.

852
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.880
<v 0>Okay,</v>

853
00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.950
<v 1>now I'm out of a job.
I,
I don't know what I'm going to do.</v>

854
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:59.580
And then you just leave.
Go on and get drunk.
I don't want,

855
00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:03.070
I don't know what the fuck.
All right,
dog wins marathon.
Hey Billy.

856
00:51:03.071 --> 00:51:05.680
Probably a debt.
I am.
I'm a father now,

857
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:10.090
which means I now get to fucking act like I know things that people who don't

858
00:51:10.091 --> 00:51:13.900
have kids,
no,
don't know,
whatever.
You know they do it or you don't understand.

859
00:51:13.901 --> 00:51:17.090
You don't understand.
Your baby's looking in your eyes.
Shut up.

860
00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:21.500
You didn't wear a condom.
All right?
That is your fucking big.

861
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.320
That's what,
that's what you did.
All right.

862
00:51:24.321 --> 00:51:28.920
Stop acting like you walked in the mood.
Oh,
do you have a baby?

863
00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:32.460
Oh my God.
What is that?
12 billion of those fucking things.

864
00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:37.920
It's like saying you have a hat.
All right,
dog wins marathon.
Hey Billy,

865
00:51:37.921 --> 00:51:41.220
probably a death thought you liked story.
Uh,

866
00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.110
but it's my head thought you'd like this story.

867
00:51:44.111 --> 00:51:48.820
A dog left his house and started running a marathon and ran alongside runners

868
00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:53.050
and finished the whole thing.
He finished seventh.
Congratulations.

869
00:51:53.051 --> 00:51:56.530
Get the fuck Outta here.
Now I have to watch this video.

870
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:03.030
He ran the whole fucking,
no,

871
00:52:03.031 --> 00:52:07.120
he didn't.
Luda vine,

872
00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:12.250
Lord the vine.
The ran the entire 13.1 miles without a leash or human companion.

873
00:52:12.251 --> 00:52:16.510
Okay?
First of all,
13.1 miles is not a marathon.
Oh,

874
00:52:16.511 --> 00:52:20.440
half marathon.
Sorry.
See,
other misinformation starts.

875
00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.100
He fucking called in a marathon and then I start blaming CNN.

876
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.033
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

877
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:29.630
<v 1>dog wins marathon.
He want half a marathon.
See,
you already started the lie.</v>

878
00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.050
Give Cpr after running a fucking marriage.
Don,

879
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:40.040
a runners in Alabama may have bitten off more competition than they anticipated

880
00:52:40.061 --> 00:52:42.930
in a race earlier this month.
All right,
now it makes sense cause I was like,
who,

881
00:52:42.931 --> 00:52:46.660
what kind of a fucking dog owner would leave his front door wide open and the

882
00:52:46.661 --> 00:52:51.250
God damn thing just runs out.
It runs fucking 13 miles away.

883
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.070
Oh,
obviously somebody in Alabama,

884
00:52:55.780 --> 00:53:00.040
a dog finished in the top 10 in the elk Mont half marathon.

885
00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:05.100
The trackless train trek on January 16th and has been quite the Internet

886
00:53:07.181 --> 00:53:12.040
sensation.
What is a trackless train trek?
They used to be trained tracks.

887
00:53:12.041 --> 00:53:15.760
There
was this,
the underground railroad is,

888
00:53:15.761 --> 00:53:20.630
this is how the slaves got out of there.
Yeah.
You know,
we laid him daily,

889
00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:24.330
escaped up this way,
but we could,
we blocked it off.
Now we just do a marathon.

890
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:26.263
Um,

891
00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:30.420
<v 0>why people only marathon elevate the act like,
like I do it too,</v>

892
00:53:30.421 --> 00:53:34.440
like racist white people or only in the south.
That's not true everywhere.

893
00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:40.290
Um,
Lud Vine,
a bloodhound lives nearby and a bloodhound.
Oh,

894
00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:43.980
I fucking love those.
That's an a bloodhound.
Okay.

895
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:47.490
<v 1>Oh yes it is.
Baldwin has runs its faces all flying backwards,</v>

896
00:53:47.491 --> 00:53:51.420
so it looks like a fucking retriever.
That's one of my favorite dogs ever.

897
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.180
Oh God.
Damn.
It's making me miss my dog.
All right,

898
00:53:54.181 --> 00:53:58.170
let's plow through this blood vine.
A bloodhound lives near,
by the way,

899
00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.600
update on Clio is a,

900
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:03.150
the new owners sent me a fucking picture and it was up on the couch sleeping

901
00:54:03.151 --> 00:54:03.870
like a baby.

902
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:07.740
Loving life probably doesn't even remember us because it's a dog and it lives in

903
00:54:07.741 --> 00:54:11.560
the fucking present.
And uh,
so that was,
that was good to see.
But I,

904
00:54:11.561 --> 00:54:15.180
when I saw it I was like,
Oh fuck yeah.
Um,
anyways,

905
00:54:15.181 --> 00:54:20.130
she competed without human or leash.
Her owner doesn't even run.

906
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:23.370
That's what makes the store.
You know what?
I don't like this story.

907
00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:24.700
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

908
00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.780
<v 1>I don't like this fight.
I don't like,
this is one of these just like,</v>

909
00:54:27.781 --> 00:54:32.410
let's just go,
ah,
altogether.
Casey,
this is a nice,

910
00:54:32.411 --> 00:54:36.760
heartwarming story for everyone.
Um,
all right,
best man.

911
00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:41.380
Hey Billy Bitch tits.
But that's one of the most popular ones.

912
00:54:41.381 --> 00:54:44.530
You guys always call me that Billy bitch tits.
Is it the alliteration?

913
00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.890
I do pushups.
I don't have bitch tits yet.
Um,

914
00:54:47.891 --> 00:54:50.290
I recently proposed to my girlfriend.
Congratulations.

915
00:54:50.291 --> 00:54:52.960
And we're getting married in December.
Congratulations.
Uh,

916
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:57.850
when my lady asked me who I wanted as my best man,

917
00:54:57.851 --> 00:55:02.610
I realized I wasn't close enough to anyone to ask them.
Uh,

918
00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:06.310
I have friends and coworkers and family,
but I'm not really close with them.

919
00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:09.850
Not enough to choose one best man.
Anyway,
so what that,

920
00:55:09.851 --> 00:55:12.310
is this a fucking pitch for a Hollywood movie?

921
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:16.530
Didn't Kevin Hart have to,
didn't,
this is a Kevin Hart movie.

922
00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:18.450
So with that being said,

923
00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:21.990
what are the chances of you showing up and being my best man?
If not,

924
00:55:21.991 --> 00:55:26.730
can you get me in touch with Joe Rogan?
Thank you.
Where's your,
uh,

925
00:55:26.731 --> 00:55:28.260
where's your wedding going to be at?

926
00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

927
00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:34.690
<v 1>If I got a Gig,
if I got a gig nearby,
I'll fucking do it.</v>

928
00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:36.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

929
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:39.970
<v 1>I'll come down.
Whatever you need.
I'll me tell you something about a lot the,</v>

930
00:55:39.971 --> 00:55:42.720
something that a lot of people don't know about Larry.

931
00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:44.630
<v 0>Okay.</v>

932
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:47.570
<v 1>Okay.
This guy</v>

933
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:52.560
fucking,
this guy listens to the Monday morning podcast,

934
00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:56.310
start doing the Madonna thing.
I'll just start hyping my fucking podcast.

935
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:59.880
That's what I'll do.
I'm going to do the Madonna thing.
I want to wear a bra.

936
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.970
I was like,
you know,

937
00:56:01.971 --> 00:56:05.670
when I came here I thought about blowing up this fucking reception area.

938
00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.480
Uh,
cause I didn't like the cake.

939
00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:16.460
Why is the groom on the left and not the people read from left to right?

940
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:21.810
Why is it the lady first?
Um,

941
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:25.030
Eddie,
I know what the fuck what I do.
I don't know.
Maybe I'll do that.

942
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.380
I have no fucking idea.

943
00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:29.083
<v 3>MMM</v>

944
00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:31.770
<v 1>No,
I'm not going to do it cause then I have to go through the whole fucking</v>

945
00:56:31.771 --> 00:56:34.290
ceremony.
I got to present the ring and do all of that shit.

946
00:56:34.291 --> 00:56:36.990
I don't want to fucking do that.
I barely wanted to be at my wedding

947
00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:41.040
even though I had a great time.
That's where I learned about myself too.

948
00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:42.421
I swear to God,

949
00:56:42.421 --> 00:56:46.350
what I fucking learned about myself is the level of social anxiety that I have,

950
00:56:46.351 --> 00:56:47.184
that,
um,

951
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:51.270
the amount of big moments in my life that if I could just fast forward through

952
00:56:51.271 --> 00:56:55.710
them and get on the other side of them,
I would gladly do it to not,
I mean,

953
00:56:55.711 --> 00:56:58.710
after I have the experience,
I always think like,
well,
what the fuck was I?
So,

954
00:56:58.740 --> 00:56:59.573
yeah,

955
00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:00.290
<v 3>okay.</v>

956
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:01.700
<v 1>You know,
anxious about.</v>

957
00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:02.850
<v 3>Okay.</v>

958
00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:06.450
<v 1>And,
um,
I actually,
you know,
by the,</v>

959
00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.510
like my wedding was one of the best nights of my life,
but like,
you know,

960
00:57:09.511 --> 00:57:12.400
my wife went into labor and Shit,
you know,

961
00:57:12.401 --> 00:57:16.050
I'm driving her over there and everything and,
uh,
you know,

962
00:57:16.051 --> 00:57:19.380
there was that part of me was just going like,
just thinking like,

963
00:57:19.381 --> 00:57:22.410
I hope this is over as quickly as possible.
And it was,
wasn't,

964
00:57:22.411 --> 00:57:24.630
there was like a selfish thought.
It had nothing to do with luck.

965
00:57:24.631 --> 00:57:27.210
I don't want my wife going through any more of this pain,
which I definitely,

966
00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:29.370
there might have been the most emotional I got,

967
00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:32.060
listen to her screaming and fucking pain was,
that was fucking brutal.

968
00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:33.693
<v 3>MMM.</v>

969
00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:38.380
<v 1>Anyways.
Uh,
but like,
yeah,</v>

970
00:57:38.381 --> 00:57:42.970
I had this feeling like if I could just like hit fast forward and just be on the

971
00:57:42.971 --> 00:57:47.430
other side of this thing,
I would do it in a second.
And um,

972
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:51.790
I thought about that like my entire fucking life I've had,
I had,

973
00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:55.360
I had never really realized I had this social anxiety with all of this shit.

974
00:57:55.361 --> 00:57:59.200
Like I just want to,
I just get fucking through it,
get on the other side,

975
00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:03.310
I'm on the other side.
I made it through nothing humiliating happened.

976
00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:08.020
Now I can fucking relax.
I felt like that for like the first,
um,

977
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:12.340
probably nine years of every standup show that I did,

978
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:15.550
like the level of relief that I had after,

979
00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:17.380
like once I got on stage I would be fine.

980
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:19.673
<v 3>MMM.</v>

981
00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:23.470
<v 1>And then you just doing your act and then even if you're bombing or whatever,</v>

982
00:58:23.471 --> 00:58:24.340
it's like,
it's,

983
00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:28.500
the clock has started and with every second it's closer.

984
00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:32.780
The event is closer to being over.
You know what I mean?
It's,

985
00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:36.310
it's still waiting and not knowing that's,
that's what is always

986
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.410
<v 3>okay.</v>

987
00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:39.630
<v 1>Always fucking given me anxiety.
Like,</v>

988
00:58:39.631 --> 00:58:42.930
I'm the amount of standup shows that I've done and um,

989
00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:45.000
<v 3>yeah,</v>

990
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.630
<v 1>impossible situations that you go through as a comedian when you're coming up.</v>

991
00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:53.160
For me it was never,
it was already over by the time I got on stage.

992
00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:54.430
<v 3>Okay.</v>

993
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:56.890
<v 1>Cause now you just go out there and now you just deal with stuff and you know,</v>

994
00:58:56.891 --> 00:58:58.270
he tell people to go fuck themselves.

995
00:58:58.271 --> 00:59:01.570
The plow three till they get you and you look stupid and you feel like an

996
00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:02.404
asshole.
But

997
00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:03.593
<v 3>okay.</v>

998
00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:07.350
<v 1>Then you say good night and then it's over and then you could just fucking
relax.</v>

999
00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.350
But when you stand in there for me,
for me,

1000
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:14.220
when you're standing there at the side of the fucking stage waiting or

1001
00:59:14.221 --> 00:59:18.810
metaphorically,
you know,
go in there.
I mean,
I don't know.

1002
00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.680
I can't believe this was one of the craziest fucking weekends,
my life.

1003
00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.170
You know what I mean?

1004
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:29.120
From the women's March to Donald Trump getting sworn in to the Patriots,

1005
00:59:29.121 --> 00:59:34.121
go into another fucking super bowl and a becoming a dad was a hell of a hell of

1006
00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:36.260
a four days.
I can tell you that.

1007
00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:39.993
<v 3>I Dunno.</v>

1008
00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:42.480
<v 1>Very thankful to be honest with,
you know,</v>

1009
00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:45.540
all jokes aside that I finally got to have that experience of becoming a dad

1010
00:59:45.541 --> 00:59:48.170
because it was getting to the point of like,
I don't know if I'm going to,
uh,

1011
00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.340
I don't know if I'm going to get this experience.
And it's,
it's weird.

1012
00:59:52.341 --> 00:59:57.341
I feel like I lived my youth straight to my golden years and now I'm the middle

1013
00:59:58.431 --> 00:59:59.930
part.
I'm just doing it.
I was joking.

1014
00:59:59.931 --> 01:00:01.520
I think I've met you even said this on podcasts.

1015
01:00:01.521 --> 01:00:04.520
I'm like living my life like a terantin no movie where it's like completely out

1016
01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:08.810
of sync.
You know,
John Travolta is walking by in the background,
you know,

1017
01:00:08.811 --> 01:00:11.060
the diner scene in pulp fiction.
My ruining is,

1018
01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.770
do I still have to say spoiler alert,

1019
01:00:12.771 --> 01:00:17.240
even though that fucking movie came out like 22 years ago,
23 years ago.
Um,

1020
01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:20.090
anyways,
status the,
uh,
the podcast for this week.

1021
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:24.050
Tune in to Jimmy Kimmel tonight and,
uh,
I don't know what I'm going to do.

1022
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.230
I don't know what I'm going to fucking talk about.
All I know is I got the,
uh,

1023
01:00:27.231 --> 01:00:31.310
the preinterview coming up.
What were some of the things she'd like to touch on?

1024
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:37.310
Huh.
Well,
can I do the con poem for my podcast?

1025
01:00:37.311 --> 01:00:41.880
I don't think so.
Uh,
we shall see.
We'll see how this one goes.

1026
01:00:41.881 --> 01:00:44.690
So I'm very excited.
I never done the Jimmy Kimmel show and,
um,

1027
01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.620
here's something so cool.
That fucking guy is,
I met him one time and,
um,

1028
01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:55.010
I think I was down at Lago where I'm going to be bill burn France on January

1029
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:59.980
31st on La Cienega boulevard right down here in Hollywood.
And uh,

1030
01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:03.050
he came down to the show to see somebody else and I met him and I started

1031
01:01:03.051 --> 01:01:05.480
talking to them about how Bill Walsh wrote this book.

1032
01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:07.613
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1033
01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:12.920
<v 1>You know,
the,
at the height of his,
you know,
just being like the bill Bellacheck,</v>

1034
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:15.020
Vince Lombardi guy of his era,

1035
01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:19.250
he was approached to write a book on football and he wrote like,

1036
01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:25.640
he,
like he basically showed the outline and he had diagram plays and it was like

1037
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:30.150
you had to be a coach to understand the book and the uh,

1038
01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:31.430
the publisher or whatever the,

1039
01:01:31.431 --> 01:01:34.260
the company he was doing the book with was basically like going,
dude,

1040
01:01:34.261 --> 01:01:38.930
you gotta like
we can't put this book out.
Like you gotta be like a,

1041
01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:44.060
you've got to be like a football coach to even understand any of this shit.

1042
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.520
How about some pictures of you with Joe Montana,

1043
01:01:46.521 --> 01:01:48.950
how about some family stories and blah,
blah,
blah.
And he was just like,

1044
01:01:48.951 --> 01:01:52.610
now you want me to write,
write a book about football,
this is it right here.

1045
01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.960
And he just fucking put out this thing.

1046
01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:58.961
So the book bombed as far as not making money with just regular joes,

1047
01:02:01.041 --> 01:02:04.310
like even myself,
the amount of football that I watched,
but amongst coaches,

1048
01:02:04.311 --> 01:02:06.890
evidently that book became like a Bible.

1049
01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:11.120
And if you can find like a hardcover version,
you find them on the Internet.

1050
01:02:11.121 --> 01:02:15.740
I think they go for like three,
400 bucks or something like that.
And,
um,

1051
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.860
whatever.
I was telling us,
telling Jimmy that story and he was laughing,

1052
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:24.480
thought it was funny or whatever.
And uh,
and I was joking going like,
you know,

1053
01:02:24.481 --> 01:02:25.650
I want to actually get that book.

1054
01:02:25.651 --> 01:02:28.680
Maybe I'll finally understand the cover two defense or whatever the fuck is a

1055
01:02:28.681 --> 01:02:31.590
nickel defense and that type of shit.
So sure enough,

1056
01:02:31.591 --> 01:02:35.820
like fucking three weeks later I get this package from Amazon.
It was from,

1057
01:02:35.821 --> 01:02:39.930
from him and he actually bought me the book and,
um,
I thumb through it,
dude.

1058
01:02:39.931 --> 01:02:43.050
And I'm telling you,
it's like you're,
you,
it's like you've,

1059
01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:48.000
you feel like you stole a team's playbook.
Um,
so anyways,

1060
01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:51.300
uh,
so,
but I've never been able to do is show every time I tried to do a show,

1061
01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:52.950
like something would come up.

1062
01:02:52.951 --> 01:02:56.940
So this is my first time doing it and a so tune in tonight,
I'm open,

1063
01:02:56.941 --> 01:02:58.290
I'm going to go there and,
uh,

1064
01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.350
be able to repay them by being a little bit funny on his show.
But once again,

1065
01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:06.410
my new standup special walk your way out comes out January 31st on Netflix.

1066
01:03:06.901 --> 01:03:11.520
Please tweet about it.
Please let everybody know.
And,
um,
and that's it.

1067
01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:14.250
Thank you for listening to the podcast.
I'll talk to you later.
