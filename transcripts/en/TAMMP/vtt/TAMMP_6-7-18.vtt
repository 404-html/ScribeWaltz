00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.750
Hey,

It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:08.420
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
Yeah.

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.710
<v 2>Ah,</v>

4
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.210
<v 1>just checking in.
Hey,
uh,

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.960
what's going on?
Just checking in on you.

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.980
How's your Thursday afternoon going?
Oh,

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.240
Billy Billy Ballou.
He left Ireland.

8
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:29.840
He left Dublin for fuck sakes.
And um,

9
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.860
now I'm in a,
I'm in London.
I,

10
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.220
I flew into a fro.
Yeah.
Um,

11
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.700
the typical Heathrow experiences just,

12
00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:48.701
I just don't fucking understand what the problem is with that God damn airport.

13
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.240
I hate that fucking airport.
I love it because I'm going to London,

14
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.010
but I hate it when I get there.
Oh,
I was flying from Dublin to London,

15
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:02.270
which is like flying from fucking La to San Francisco,
essentially.
Nice.

16
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:03.140
Easy flight.

17
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

18
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.830
<v 1>You're on southwest.
They're doing stand up,
you're waiting for it to be over.</v>

19
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.020
And by the time they finished their routine,

20
00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:16.021
they already landing and they've begun where there were now landing routine with

21
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.110
him,

22
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.110
imitate fucking c three Po and fucking Darth Vader or whatever it is that those

23
00:01:23.621 --> 00:01:25.120
people are trying to do over there.

24
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.633
<v 0>MMM.</v>

25
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.990
<v 1>Anyways,
I guess they feel like there's a lot of nervous flyers over there.</v>

26
00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:35.980
And for some reason,
bad standup comedy is the thing,
I guess.

27
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:37.750
Then you're not afraid to die because you're like,
well,

28
00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:40.900
at least if the plane crashes,
I don't have to hear the end of this routine.
Oh,

29
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.890
Bill,
that's no way to,
it's Thursday,
man.

30
00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:47.230
It's supposed to be a happy event.
Yeah.
So anyways,

31
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:51.160
I'm flying from Dublin and to eighth row and um,

32
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.260
everything's goes great.
Take off on time.
Land a little bit.

33
00:01:57.261 --> 00:02:02.240
Early Gate is ready,
you know.
But I did the unforgivable,

34
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:07.040
I checked a bag,
which I never do,
I didn't want to do on this trip,
but you know,

35
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.300
my wife talked me into it.
Um,
which I'm actually glad she did.

36
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:16.280
Once I get the bag and I unpack and actually have some of my stuff,
you know,

37
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.090
I have some options for different outfits.
Sorry.

38
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.733
<v 0>MMM.</v>

39
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.350
<v 1>So everything goes great.
And then,
you know,
I get off the plane,</v>

40
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.750
I'm standing there,
I get the information.
Oh,

41
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.350
I don't have to go through customs because that was already fucking in Dublin or

42
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:34.470
whatever,
which I didn't think was part of the,
uh,

43
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:36.630
the whole Great Britain fucking reach.

44
00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:38.520
I th I would think if I was in Northern Ireland,

45
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:42.780
if I felt food from Belfast to London,
they'd be like,
all right.

46
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:44.430
I was in the Republic of Ireland,

47
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.983
<v 0>you know,</v>

48
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.120
<v 1>I was there.
They're not part of Great Britain.
Are they other Great Britain?
Was,</v>

49
00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:56.380
was,
was,
uh,
England,
Wales,
Scotland

50
00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.630
and Northern Ireland.

51
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.610
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

52
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.443
<v 1>whatever.</v>

53
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.100
<v 3>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.430
<v 1>Maybe because I'm in the European Union,
I don't know what the fuck it is,</v>

55
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.900
but then I thought they did the Brexit thing,
but maybe that hasn't happened yet.

56
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.420
I don't know.
All I know is I haven't gone through,

57
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.770
I didn't have to go through customs,

58
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
so I was sacked and I go down to the fucking stupid carousel thing,

59
00:03:20.131 --> 00:03:21.420
whatever,
the baggage claim.

60
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.690
<v 3>Okay.</v>

61
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.240
<v 1>And it's already turned on.
I'm like,
you fucking kidding me.</v>

62
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.440
And I see three bags come out.
Then there's a little space,
little space,

63
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.870
little space,
and I see two bags coming out.
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

64
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:32.830
They're already unloading it.

65
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.600
So I stand there for a good five minutes and it's just those three bags,

66
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.160
little space,
little space,

67
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.550
little space that then the two bags and then I start recognizing the bag saying,

68
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.560
oh,
these are just bags that were sitting here.

69
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.003
<v 3>You know,</v>

70
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.270
<v 1>five people didn't make it,</v>

71
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.570
were sold in the human trafficking and they haven't claimed their bags.

72
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.630
I Dunno what the fuck happened,
right?
Um,

73
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.200
or they went ahead of their flight or their bags got on and they didn't know who

74
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:03.940
the fuck notes.
And I was standing there.
10 minutes goes by,
15 minutes goes by,

75
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:08.020
20 minutes goes by the belts on the same fucking three bags,

76
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:11.230
a little bit of space.
So the space,
it was fucking two bags.

77
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.880
And um,
I'm just like,
you know,

78
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.590
this is just every fuck I went up to stand there for like 50 fucking minutes,

79
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.380
wait for my fucking bag.
It's just like that fucking airport.

80
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.470
It just breaks you goddamn spirit.

81
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.060
Cause every fucking time it's a different fuck over a c and never see it coming.

82
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.140
If that always happened,
I would be like,
okay,
here's the deal.

83
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:40.720
I'm not checking a bag.
Or if I checked the bag,
it'd be like,

84
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:43.900
just settle in because you know it's going to be 50 minutes.
All right,

85
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.830
go sit down,
get yourself some bangers and mash,
whatever the fuck it is.

86
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:49.960
These people lead over here and you know,

87
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:53.860
show up 45 minutes later and pick up your fucking bag.

88
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.800
What killed me is how everybody else just accepted it and I was the only person

89
00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:01.620
standing there going,
what the fuck is wrong with this airport?
What do they got?

90
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:03.210
Three fucking baggage handlers.

91
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.740
Then what kills me is when that they finally started unloading the bags,

92
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.920
they unload like five of them
and then,

93
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.910
and then you see people on your flight grabbing them and then there's no more

94
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:18.130
bags for like 10 minutes.
It's like,
what the fuck happened?

95
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.760
The guy doing it just to,
just to have a fucking stroke.

96
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.260
<v 3>Okay.</v>

97
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.510
<v 1>There's nobody back there to help them.
You get like concerned?</v>

98
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.083
<v 3>MMM.</v>

99
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.720
<v 1>Oh,
why didn't I wasn't concerned.
I was selfish.
I'll,</v>

100
00:05:32.721 --> 00:05:36.320
he gave his show was about was my bag.
So anyways,
I get my fucking bag.

101
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.120
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

102
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.110
<v 1>And uh,
I make it over here to the hotel.
And,
uh,</v>

103
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.090
after the night before I was played the three arena in Dublin,

104
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.000
one of my favorite shows,
those fucking people are just

105
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.210
<v 3>okay.</v>

106
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.000
<v 1>And it's like double specific to,
to Dublin.
They like the best fucking hecklers.</v>

107
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.020
I don't even know

108
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.450
<v 3>how,
but they made like nine 11.
Funny.</v>

109
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.230
<v 1>Oh,
just in an absurd way.</v>

110
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.360
I was on stage and I was talking about like how much the country changed,

111
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.010
you know,
since nine 11 when I said nine 11,
somebody in the crowd went,
whew.

112
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.950
You know,
and they might've been in American agreeing like,
Ooh,
yeah.

113
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.100
You know,
the country did really change after that.

114
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.280
Just kind of an obvious statement.
Now that I'm repeating it,

115
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.440
but the way they did it,
it made it seem like they were cheering on nine 11.

116
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.020
So I riffed about that.
I said,
Oh yeah,
you excited about tragedies?
Oh yeah.

117
00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:41.700
I,
you know,
I've always hated skyscrapers.
I just said something like that.

118
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.080
It made everybody laugh.
So then I started the joke again,
add it,
go,
you know,

119
00:06:46.081 --> 00:06:48.520
ever since nine 11.
And then the whole crowd goes,
Woo,

120
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.140
just to be Dicks,
you know,

121
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.690
still that I roll with it and I just start,

122
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.550
start every fucking joke now with some American tragedy as go,

123
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:07.090
yeah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
You know,
I believe that was around,
uh,

124
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.960
Pearl Harbor.
And then they'll all go,
woo,

125
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:17.310
Ooh,
so fucking childish and stupid.
Right?
So after like the third one,

126
00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:19.080
I said,
I got,
you know what Ireland,

127
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.180
I really wish I knew about your fucking tragedies.
All right.

128
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.700
But I'm an American.
I don't have time to care about other countries.

129
00:07:26.701 --> 00:07:31.350
And it was just like this little fucking stupid inside back and forth thing that

130
00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:34.650
will never happen at another show.
Um,

131
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:41.180
and uh,
I dunno,
it was just the classic classic,

132
00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:42.650
I dunno,
Dublin crab.

133
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.253
<v 3>MMM.</v>

134
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.490
<v 1>I had such a fucking great,
I came,
it's just such a fucking great city.</v>

135
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.640
So then I go over,
uh,

136
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.550
last night to do Royal Albert Hall and um,

137
00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.900
I don't even know how to describe it.
Like,
uh,

138
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.260
I still feel like it was like,
I dreamed it,
like it didn't really hit,

139
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:09.440
it went by so God damn fast.
And when you walk in there,

140
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:14.441
if you're a fan of led zap on that place essentially looks the exact same as it

141
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:19.400
did when you watch,
you know,
that concert footage,

142
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.560
the outline for my money,
the best concert footage,
um,

143
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.720
of led Zeppelin that exists just the way it looks,
the way it's shot that film.

144
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.273
Um,

145
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.530
I've tried to do a stand up special to make it look like that.

146
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.890
You just can't do it.
It's just of that,
yeah,
I guess you'd have to film it,
but,

147
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.780
um,
I just walked right down.

148
00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:45.430
It was like John Bonham's fucking that,

149
00:08:45.431 --> 00:08:49.540
that maple kit he had was right fucking here.

150
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.860
It was crazy.
And I'm on when,
when I got announced to go out,

151
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.400
I can't remember it was that constant or not.
There's one word,

152
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.580
Robert plant walks off stage and grabs a joint,

153
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.670
smokes it and holds it up to the camera.
Like that's what I thought.

154
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:03.960
It was such a fucking,

155
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.760
it was the weirdest experience walking out because I felt like I'd been there

156
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.350
already just because I've watched that concert film so many times and no,

157
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:15.560
I didn't get a chance to play drums because,
uh,

158
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.220
I did the show in Dublin the night before,
which I had to do,
cause you know,

159
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.960
I had to make sure,
um,
I did one show in Europe,
you know,
if there's always that,

160
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:28.050
just a little bit of a different vibe.
So I had,
you know,
that was more important,

161
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:30.530
you know,
to have a good show then to,
you know,

162
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.620
go there and hack away at the drums for like an hour.
But,
um,
I believe me,

163
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:38.970
I definitely got my money's worth.
The crowd was fucking amazing.
Um,

164
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.300
and I just had this whole weird feeling the entire time I was up there.
Like,

165
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.830
why am I so relaxed with a combination of,
Holy Shit,

166
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.030
I'm in Royal Albert Hall

167
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.240
<v 3>and then,
you know,</v>

168
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:56.560
<v 1>actually fucked up a couple of jokes because I was looking at the architecture.</v>

169
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.570
I can't fucking believe I'm here.
Um,

170
00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:07.110
my parents came out,
my wife came out for the show.
Um,

171
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:12.370
my manager and agent came out and,
uh,
it was just awesome.
It was like everybody,

172
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.240
you know,
I,

173
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.130
I can't eat if you ever get a chance to come over here and see anything there.

174
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.610
Um,
it really is just one of those places.

175
00:10:22.611 --> 00:10:27.050
And I put some photos up on Instagram and um,

176
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.840
Yup,
that's it.
And now,

177
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.350
now Billy boy is on vacation.

178
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.540
I think I did like an hour and 15 minutes in the show and I was sitting there

179
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.610
going,
I forgot to look at my watch.
And I was like,

180
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.570
I can't tell if I've been up here for an hour and a half,
40 minutes,

181
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:51.180
a half hour,
or a little over an hour.
Cause I,

182
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.570
I,
I dunno,
I don't think since Carnegie Hall,

183
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.770
there's been a couple of places that you play and you're just like,
um,

184
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.260
I shouldn't be here.
That's what you're thinking.

185
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.610
Just looking at how beautiful it is and then seeing like when you walk to the

186
00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:09.450
dressing room,

187
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:15.650
you can't help but look at the photos and I'm looking like everyone from Freddie

188
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.810
Mercury,
David Bowie,
Frank Sinatra

189
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.080
in like 1963,

190
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:26.250
evidently the fucking Beatles and the rolling stones played there on the same

191
00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:27.084
bill,

192
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.973
<v 3>you know,</v>

193
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.650
<v 1>and then I'm walking out there going like,
hey,</v>

194
00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:37.000
you know what the fuck's up with chairs and you just,
you know,
your act just,

195
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.410
just,
just shrinks down either.
I was kind of the thing you had to like fight off.

196
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.290
But,
um,
my agent asked me like,
after the show,

197
00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:50.990
he goes,
so what venue do you want to play next year in London?
I was like,
ah,

198
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.320
this one,
you know,

199
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.590
where the fuck do you go from here?
Um,
and they're all like,

200
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:02.920
well,
you know,
it's like booked three years out.
I'm like,
I don't give a shit.

201
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.900
I don't care,
you know?
Um,
unbelievable.

202
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:12.280
So thank you so much to everybody who came out to the show.

203
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:15.010
And afterwards I was able to,
uh,
you know,

204
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:17.990
run out there and say a to some people,

205
00:12:17.991 --> 00:12:20.950
signed some posters and uh,

206
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.920
I appreciate the people that hung out and were patient because like I said,

207
00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:26.500
it had a lot of family and friends back there.
You know,

208
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.310
it was sorta my pre birthday celebration,
they had a cake and shit like that,

209
00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:31.720
so I had to do that and I ran out there.

210
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:35.860
So you got tired of waiting for me and you left.
I apologize.
But uh,

211
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:37.240
for the record I did come out.

212
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:38.903
<v 0>MMM.</v>

213
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.110
<v 1>And the people there were just like ridiculously nice annual,</v>

214
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.280
there's all these people.
I had like three people from Poland going,

215
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.560
you got to deal with Shell in Poland.

216
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.873
<v 0>MMM.</v>

217
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:54.130
<v 1>Somebody from Romania,
somebody from Jordan.
When I was in Dublin,
I did a show.</v>

218
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:59.131
There was this dude from Hong Kong told me he flew in because he saw a clip of

219
00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:01.210
me on Conan O'brien.

220
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.310
How fucking crazy as the internet,

221
00:13:05.311 --> 00:13:10.311
that's as some guy in Hong Kong watching clips of the Conan O'brien show.

222
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:15.210
And then he sees me as a guest,
Colin and makes me look good is always,

223
00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:19.450
and now he wants to come to my show.
He w he goes,
I got tickets for the,

224
00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:23.970
the Dublin show and the London show and he was there by himself.

225
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.920
I was just like,
all right,

226
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.130
this guy's either going to stab me or this is one of the coolest people I've

227
00:13:29.131 --> 00:13:31.320
ever met in my life.
Fortunately it was the latter.

228
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.510
So,
um,
anyways,
now I'm on vacation.

229
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:44.430
I'm on vacation.
Do you guys realize the next part?

230
00:13:44.431 --> 00:13:48.570
This is my last podcast in my forties,
man.

231
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.390
Oh,
fucking Billy over the hill.
Where to dude,
dude,
dude,

232
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.390
dude,
dude,

233
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.160
I'm turning fucking 50 on Sunday,
Sunday,
Sunday.
Um,

234
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.970
actually feel good.
You know,
I don't,
I'm not going to feel any fucking different.

235
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.770
I don't think between now and Sunday.
Other than when somebody says,

236
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.260
how old are you?
I don't say for I say fear now.
50.

237
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.040
Um,
that's it.
Oh,
Billy.

238
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.990
Billy red nuts is 50 fucking years old.
Who would have thunk it?

239
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.230
Um,
so anyways,
so then we ended up hanging out.

240
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.460
We went out to a bar afterwards,
only had a couple of drinks,

241
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.760
smoked an unbelievable cigar and

242
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.793
<v 0>mmm.</v>

243
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:43.650
<v 1>Then there was like this little casino thing that we went to.
Me and my manager,</v>

244
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.480
my agent and my lovely wife,
um,

245
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:51.570
or did some dim sum at like fucking two in the morning and we watched a game for

246
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:55.580
the NBA finals.
Uh,

247
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.770
which was a great game once again,

248
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.800
but it's just golden state has too many fucking too many people.

249
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:06.640
Man.
It's like a,
I dunno,

250
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.420
I guess it's genius that the Nva let's these teams

251
00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.620
become what they are,

252
00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:18.630
I guess with all the fucking everybody piling on because then guys like me,

253
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.660
I just watch rooting against that team.

254
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:27.620
<v 0>Um,
but um,
you know,</v>

255
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.290
<v 1>it's kind of boring though,
you know,
the last two years again,</v>

256
00:15:32.291 --> 00:15:34.900
VA kind of knowing at the beginning of the season,
well yeah,

257
00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:38.300
obviously these guys are going to win it and then they do,

258
00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:39.650
I mean this is not even like,

259
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.363
<v 0>I dunno,</v>

260
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.010
<v 1>remember that year of [inaudible],
you know what,
I couldn't get into,</v>

261
00:15:47.011 --> 00:15:49.890
I couldn't get into the Dream Team when we went to the Olympics and they would

262
00:15:49.891 --> 00:15:54.870
dunk it on Ethiopians and shit.
It was just like this,
just like this is,

263
00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.950
it was the most boring fucking,
and they always talk about that team.

264
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.370
Well that was the way it is.

265
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.530
Assemblage of talent in basketball history.
Yeah.

266
00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:09.540
Going up against probably the weakest.

267
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.450
I would rather watch the Globetrotters play the fucking Washington generals.

268
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:20.750
They watched the Dream Team pay for play fucking Rwanda or whatever the hell we

269
00:16:21.061 --> 00:16:24.480
were doing that year.
You know what I mean?
But what was good about that

270
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.420
was they so kicked the shit out of everybody that sense then,

271
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.480
you know,
Europe,

272
00:16:32.481 --> 00:16:36.530
like raise the bar the way they play now and now some of the best players in the

273
00:16:36.531 --> 00:16:41.180
league or from Europe,
which was unheard of when I was growing up.
So I guess,

274
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.193
I don't know,

275
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:46.550
something good will come out of this golden state warrior team that they'll just

276
00:16:46.551 --> 00:16:49.970
be,
I don't know,
all the stars will be on two teams.
They,

277
00:16:49.971 --> 00:16:53.960
she just take the all star team in the east and the West.
Right.
And just,

278
00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:56.570
just have that be the league.
Right.

279
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.420
Or at least just have him go to the NBA finals and then you just get what to

280
00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:03.500
watch.
Everybody try

281
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.130
as opposed to the all star game and nobody pays any defense.

282
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.430
I don't fucking know.
Um,

283
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.550
<v 3>okay.</v>

284
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:15.440
<v 1>So anyways,
uh,
that's it man.</v>

285
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.900
I did Royal Albert Hall.

286
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:23.870
Part of the history of freckles is part of that.
I can't fucking believe it.

287
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.070
Can't believe it.
I was saying that to somebody.

288
00:17:27.071 --> 00:17:29.170
I say you believe fucking 26 years ago,

289
00:17:29.171 --> 00:17:32.380
you sign up for a stupid fucking open mic and it leads to this.

290
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:34.813
<v 0>MMM.</v>

291
00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:35.700
<v 1>Never.</v>

292
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.970
Never in my wildest dreams where I ever think I would ever sell one ticket in

293
00:17:38.971 --> 00:17:43.520
London,
you know,
or any place in Europe.

294
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:47.710
Forget about getting to play that place.
So that one,
you know,

295
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.300
there's ones that stay you.
Um,

296
00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:56.320
that's definitely one.
Um,

297
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.410
you know,
the nine 11 shelf that will stay with me.

298
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:03.910
The absurdity of that,

299
00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.800
the vicar street one that I did Dublin,
um,

300
00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:14.590
I had a great one in Oslow,
my first really good show in Europe.

301
00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.360
These are all of the European ones that stick it.

302
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.160
Germany was fun when I was teasing him about Hitler.

303
00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.900
I've had so much fucking fun over here.
Um,

304
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.640
I just got to figure out how to do these dates now that I got the Kiddo,

305
00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:34.380
but everybody's over here,
by the way.
My lovely daughter is here.

306
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:39.330
She's such a riot.
She woke up this morning.
I stayed out late.
Right.

307
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.420
So
obviously she,
you know,
mia gets her up and everything.

308
00:18:45.421 --> 00:18:48.960
She puts her in the bed.
She's next to me and I have my eyes closed.

309
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.280
And then she just,
I just,
it looks over at me.
She just goes,
hi.

310
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.303
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

311
00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:02.290
<v 1>I start cracking up and then she left.
And that's,</v>

312
00:19:02.291 --> 00:19:05.230
that's just the greatest way ever to start the date.
Nia,

313
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.400
how much fun was last night?
Oh,
that's great.
That's really great.

314
00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.380
Um,
what are we doing today?

315
00:19:12.381 --> 00:19:17.270
We're got to go get some bangers and mash and mushy peas.
Yeah.
Yeah.

316
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:23.560
Okay.
You look beautiful.
Nini.
Thank you.
I like your dress.

317
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.910
So what we're going to do today,
hey,
if anybody lives in here,

318
00:19:30.911 --> 00:19:35.330
our lives around in London,
if you know a place where they have good food,
uh,

319
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.070
please text me.
The dim sung actually was great last night,
but,
uh,
I don't know.

320
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.780
We've been kind of striking out here.
I know there has to be good food here.

321
00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.830
There has to be.
Okay.
Everybody has the food network.

322
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:53.220
There has to be some food in London that's actually seasoned correctly.

323
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.860
Um,
I don't under,

324
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.450
I just don't get it.
You know,
I mean,
they got salt and pepper,

325
00:20:04.451 --> 00:20:08.140
but after that it just goes off the rails.
That fucking guy that,
uh,

326
00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:13.000
the hell's kitchen guys from here,
people from here can cook.

327
00:20:13.001 --> 00:20:16.600
Where the fuck are they?
Gordon Ramsay?
Does he got a receipt?
Well,

328
00:20:16.601 --> 00:20:18.310
I don't know if I want to go to his restaurant because you know,

329
00:20:18.311 --> 00:20:22.180
those celebrity chefs,
they loaned their name to something.
It's hit or miss.

330
00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:26.830
Some of them are involved.
Other rooms just like how much.
Yeah.

331
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.980
I don't give a shit what my fucking name on it.

332
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.550
Um,
anyways,

333
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:38.260
so tonight I'm going to try to find a place where I can watch potentially the

334
00:20:38.261 --> 00:20:42.220
Washington capitals when their first Stanley Cup,

335
00:20:42.221 --> 00:20:44.830
the bed in the league since 1974,

336
00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:48.790
God bless 'em if 45th season,

337
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.270
I really want to see a vet.
You can get a cup,
you know?
Um,

338
00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.190
I dunno,
I,
but also,
you know,
then the other side is if Vegas comes back,

339
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:01.571
you know,

340
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:06.571
and every Washington capitol fan just fucking hung their head because they know

341
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.880
if anybody could blow a fucking three,
one lead.
But I,
I just think this,

342
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.350
this capital's team is different.

343
00:21:13.351 --> 00:21:15.980
I'm not trying to chink some or anything like that.
I'm just going to fucking,

344
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.940
you know,
I'm not any of that stupid sports chink shit.
Okay.
This fucking team,

345
00:21:20.941 --> 00:21:25.200
like,
you know,
the coaching
that's going on here,

346
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:31.380
you know,
they saw who the nights were and gave one and they said,
oh,

347
00:21:31.381 --> 00:21:34.860
is that how you applied?
Well,
here's our adjustment to it.
And God dammit,

348
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.900
they've won the next three in a row.

349
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.130
And I really hope I get to find a place where I can watch that game.

350
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.620
Maybe I'll go back down to the casino again.

351
00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:45.283
<v 4>MMM.</v>

352
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:50.340
<v 1>And watch it.
But,
uh,
Oh man,</v>

353
00:21:50.341 --> 00:21:51.330
that reminds me of this time.

354
00:21:51.331 --> 00:21:56.331
I watched a patriots game when I was in Australia at a fucking casino at like

355
00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.250
four in the morning.
I think

356
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.300
it was four in the morning the next day.

357
00:22:03.301 --> 00:22:08.130
And I was watching son was four in the morning on Monday in Australia and I was

358
00:22:08.131 --> 00:22:11.790
watching Sunday afternoon football.
It's like a 14.

359
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.000
I think I was watching the one o'clock game or something.
It's like a 14 hour.

360
00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:18.350
Is it a 14 hour difference?
No,
it's like that's how long the flight is,

361
00:22:18.351 --> 00:22:22.230
is 14 hours.
I can't fucking remember.
It's something ridiculous like that.

362
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:23.843
<v 4>MMM.</v>

363
00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:30.410
<v 1>So anyways,
I don't even know if I have any fucking advertising.
Um,</v>

364
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.940
yeah,
I don't know what to tell you.
That's it.

365
00:22:33.941 --> 00:22:36.520
It's actually sunny out here in London.

366
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:40.540
I was worried that it was going to be all fucking shitty weather.
Oh by the way,

367
00:22:40.541 --> 00:22:45.040
you know I ended up being like ridiculous traffic getting to the um,

368
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:46.530
<v 3>yeah.</v>

369
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.590
<v 1>Getting to the venue last night cause they were building some new hotel called</v>

370
00:22:49.591 --> 00:22:54.591
the mandarin out here and they had some massive fire like half something like

371
00:22:56.101 --> 00:22:58.430
half the firefighters in,

372
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:05.130
in all of London where they're fighting the fucking thing.
Thank God.

373
00:23:05.131 --> 00:23:08.700
Like you know the hotel wasn't open yet,

374
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.440
although that wasn't what I was saying in my show.

375
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.200
I was so upset about the fucking traffic.

376
00:23:13.201 --> 00:23:14.820
I was saying I was wishing it was full of people.

377
00:23:14.821 --> 00:23:18.210
Maybe they would have been less traffic on the road.
Oh,
Bill.
Why would you,
why?

378
00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:19.044
Why?

379
00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:20.870
<v 3>Okay.</v>

380
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:24.290
<v 1>Why would you say something like that?
Um,</v>

381
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.720
so that fucking burned down.
It's probably an insurance job.
You know,

382
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:31.920
I wonder,

383
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.910
I wonder if they can actually looked that up right now on my European Internet,

384
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.360
which is going to have all kinds of shit,
dude.

385
00:23:38.361 --> 00:23:41.730
They literally had an advertisement for fucking field hockey over here.

386
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:47.370
It's like field hockey.
Is that a,
that's a,

387
00:23:47.371 --> 00:23:52.000
that's a sport
like on TV sport.

388
00:23:52.001 --> 00:23:53.110
I know it's a sport.

389
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:54.590
<v 3>Okay.</v>

390
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.860
<v 1>They just got some weird shit over here when it comes to this sports stuff,</v>

391
00:23:58.861 --> 00:24:02.610
you know,
and let me guess.
I'm not fucking signed in.
Right.
Uh,

392
00:24:02.611 --> 00:24:06.100
you fucking so and so Wifi.

393
00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:11.840
Enter your room number and to your last name.
You know,

394
00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.470
I went to the casino last night,
they asked for my driver's license.

395
00:24:14.471 --> 00:24:17.410
They wanted to take like a fucking picture of me and I was in such a good mood.

396
00:24:17.411 --> 00:24:20.860
I let them do all of that.
I'm like,
well,
I guess I in your system now.
They go,
no,

397
00:24:20.861 --> 00:24:24.250
no,
no,
we don't.
We don't.
We don't keep it.
It's like,
yeah,
you do.

398
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:30.040
You're taking a fucking picture of me.
Like where?

399
00:24:30.041 --> 00:24:34.800
Where does all of that go?
You know,

400
00:24:34.801 --> 00:24:36.450
I just got a fucking phone call,

401
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:41.550
a message from American Airlines saying that somebody's got my,

402
00:24:41.551 --> 00:24:43.860
a frequent flyer number in,

403
00:24:43.861 --> 00:24:46.770
might've been trying to see where I was flying and blah,

404
00:24:46.771 --> 00:24:50.040
Blah Blah and all of this bullshit.
And it's just like,

405
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:55.650
so we need you,
uh,
you know,
we need you to call us and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

406
00:24:55.651 --> 00:24:57.720
It's like,
what the fuck do I got to call you guys for?

407
00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:03.060
Why don't you guys fix your fucking weak ass system?
This isn't on me.

408
00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.960
I love like when when like your information might've been compromised,

409
00:25:06.961 --> 00:25:10.500
you call them up and they tell you what you need to do.
It's like,
no,

410
00:25:10.501 --> 00:25:14.130
you know what you need to do.
Stop putting everything up on fucking computers.

411
00:25:14.131 --> 00:25:19.120
Go back to fucking notebooks and pens
so far,

412
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:23.740
like the paper trail that you leave.
It's really impossible now.

413
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:25.763
<v 3>Okay.</v>

414
00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.800
<v 1>That's what it fucking kills me about that guy that almost went to jail,</v>

415
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.980
but he sat next to Larry David.
If the Dodgers game,

416
00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.870
it's like there was no record of that guy anywhere paying for parking,

417
00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.520
getting a hot dog,
his cell phone.
They couldn't track it to the game.

418
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:42.840
You know,

419
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.440
he didn't go through some intersection where there was a camera with his dodger

420
00:25:46.441 --> 00:25:51.360
hat on going into fucking
Carlito's way canyon,

421
00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:56.220
wherever the fucking Dodgers play.
Um,
Carlitos Canyon.
What the hell is it called?

422
00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:01.650
Chavez Ravine.
Huh?
I don't know.

423
00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:07.230
Anyways,
what the fuck was I looking up?
Oh,
London fire.

424
00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.420
So I'm going to do a bunch of touristy shit,
I think today with my parents.

425
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.040
Hopefully if they're up for it,
you know,

426
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.530
I don't think I've ever seen Buckingham Palace.

427
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.800
I liked that dude who just got married by the way.
I don't know.

428
00:26:23.801 --> 00:26:26.490
There's just something about his face.
She like this.
I,
you know,

429
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.700
you can just see how much he's going to annoy the shit out of his wife

430
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:33.310
accidentally.
Come on,
man for can you fucking just for once the Internet.

431
00:26:33.311 --> 00:26:34.240
Can you work for me?

432
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:39.700
London Fire Hotel Safari.

433
00:26:39.701 --> 00:26:43.150
Can't verify the oh,
continue.
I don't give a shit.

434
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.840
My stuff's already been compromised.
Login.

436
00:26:52.141 --> 00:26:54.420

Got It.

437
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.640
And they're now in the dark web looking at fucking kitty porn.
All right,

438
00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:02.490
you are logged in.
Okay,
wonderful.

439
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:07.370
London is the last time I'm trying this.
Everybody.
London Fire

440
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.040
Bill Burns Burns it up last night at the fucking,
sorry.

441
00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:14.840
Ego just kicked in.

442
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:16.530
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

443
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.680
<v 1>The London Fire Brigade.
No,
that's not what I want.</v>

444
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.920
Fire Brigade.
That sounds like a fucking musical

445
00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:30.000
hotel.
Fire
fucking London.

446
00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.440
All right,
here we go.

447
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:39.623
<v 3>What do we got here?</v>

448
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:46.770
<v 1>Mandarin Oriental.
Huge blaze.
Oh Dude,</v>

449
00:27:46.771 --> 00:27:51.660
look at that fucking thing.
Sorry.
You need flash to play this.

450
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.090
Enable it in your browser out.
Go Fuck Yourself.

451
00:27:56.210 --> 00:28:00.020
Plumes of smoke.
Hey look who's here.

452
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:01.303
Hi.

453
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:03.703
<v 3>Huh?</v>

454
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:10.020
<v 1>How you doing buddy?
Oh,
okay,</v>

455
00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:14.940
cool.
And totally be out of here.
So she can do that.
Okay.
You got it.

456
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:19.140
All right.
Bye.

457
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:22.451
All right.

458
00:28:22.451 --> 00:28:27.100
A total of 36 hotel guests and 250 members of the hotel staff were evacuated.

459
00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:31.120
All there were fucking people in their singer.
Robbie Williams was among them.

460
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.943
<v 3>Uh,</v>

461
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:38.070
<v 1>I dunno who Robbie Williams is.
It sounds like a teen idol,</v>

462
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.190
even if he's old or she,
right.

463
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.710
The blaze reach or they,

464
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:45.050
<v 3>okay.</v>

465
00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:50.050
<v 1>The blaze reached several floors but was quickly extinguished or those,</v>

466
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:58.250
the London Fire Brigade set,
uh,
the London Fire Brigade,
Nia,

467
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.440
the fire brigade,
not to firefighters.
Again,

468
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.880
not the fucking Hook and ladder.
What welcomed?

469
00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:10.640
They never do the hook and lateral play anymore in the NFL?
Never one of that.

470
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:15.110
It always seemed to work back in the day.
That's what I'm saying.
Huh?
It's like,

471
00:29:15.111 --> 00:29:19.520
what?
Are you going to watch the NHL hockey with me tonight?
No.
No.

472
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:23.950
Why not?
You love sports.
You just don't realize it yet.
Oh,
I'm,

473
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.980
I'm looking for something I had to ask you about hearing your podcast.

474
00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.030
I'll let me hit pause.

475
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:30.930
<v 3>She's gonna take her around.</v>

476
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.520
<v 1>All right.
Um,</v>

477
00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:41.560
all right.
Sorry about that.
I'm just planning our damn day here.

478
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.550
Billows and belows,
Robbie Williams 44 describes the drama.

479
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:49.420
I went on the balcony and looked up and there was just billows and billows of

480
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:53.620
smoke.
I came back in from the balcony and said,

481
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.120
the hotel's on fire.
Oh,

482
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.320
this guy's a smart fucking so smart guy.

483
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:04.780
And then the hotel's on fire and there's a lot of smoke.

484
00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.580
But I mean,
what else would you say?
He really,

485
00:30:09.581 --> 00:30:11.890
he got the information out.
The hotel's on fire.

486
00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.240
I probably would have came back in and wouldn't be like,
yeah,

487
00:30:17.241 --> 00:30:20.630
what the fuck date I was,
you know,
added all these extra words.

488
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.490
And then the next thing,

489
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:27.730
a knock at the door came and there was a bellboy there and they said,

490
00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:32.630
get out.
I like this.
This is very,

491
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:38.080
who's that playwright that just has really fucking choppy dialogue like that.

492
00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:41.140
Or like when you watch law and order,
you know,

493
00:30:41.141 --> 00:30:45.340
they have to get so much information and they actually timed your lines.

494
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.320
When you do an episode of that show,

495
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.670
they don't care about emotion that just like say it faster.
All right.

496
00:30:51.671 --> 00:30:53.260
Williams and his wife,

497
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:58.620
Ida felled 39 ran down and external fire escape to safety.

498
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.030
Oh,
there's a video.
I don't need flash for that.
Oh man,
that's a beautiful hotel.

499
00:31:04.031 --> 00:31:08.880
I thought it was under construction.
Wait a minute.
Wow.

500
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:12.780
You know what billows and billows of smoke?

501
00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:19.550
Well,
what started it
all right.

502
00:31:19.551 --> 00:31:23.540
Can't emphasize enough how well the of actuation operation isn't put together

503
00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:27.020
now being moved to a nearby hotel for safety.

504
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:33.260
Well,
who gives a fuck about you?
Ah,

505
00:31:33.261 --> 00:31:36.650
you can't say that.
This is how it is.
Every dev,
even things about everybody now,

506
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:41.160
right?
Hotel's on fire.
Shaking my head.

507
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:46.480
<v 3>Lol.
Fuck my life.
Yolo.</v>

508
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:54.610
<v 1>He's a guy.
Just wrote,
hope you work are okay.
Anna,
subtext.</v>

509
00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:58.660
Uh,
I'd like to comfort you slash maybe turning it into some sort of sexual

510
00:31:58.661 --> 00:31:59.494
activity.

511
00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:03.840
<v 3>Um,
all right,</v>

512
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:09.800
<v 1>I think that's a good place to end.
Um,
all right,</v>

513
00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.030
that is a good friend of mine out here in London.

514
00:32:14.031 --> 00:32:17.960
Says I am now on vacation and I'm going to laze about doing.
Fuck all.

515
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.380
Um,
and then that's it.

516
00:32:21.381 --> 00:32:24.500
And then I come back to La and I'm going to get this fucking hour

517
00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:25.870
<v 3>yeah.</v>

518
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:30.670
<v 1>Of Shit.
A whipped into shape and maybe do another special,
I dunno.</v>

519
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:36.130
I Dunno what I'm supposed to do in this new landscape of 15 minutes.

520
00:32:36.131 --> 00:32:37.870
Specials,
hour specials.

521
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:39.853
<v 3>Um,</v>

522
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:40.910
<v 5>well knows.</v>

523
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:45.680
I got to figure out what the fucking next move is so I can keep coming over here

524
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:50.420
and uh,
having an unbelievable time.
Sorry if this podcast wasn't funny,

525
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:53.920
I'm still kind of floating from what happened last night.
Uh,

526
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.740
I still cannot believe I got to do that.
Um,

527
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:03.020
it's just,
yeah,
no words.
Speechless.
They actually had me sign the book,

528
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:04.580
you know,

529
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:09.260
and they like to you to sign the guestbook at Royal Albert after you did the

530
00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:13.490
Gig.
And once again,
I can barely move.
I wrote something like that.

531
00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:17.090
Just speechless.
You know,
I,
I don't know.
I didn't know what to say.

532
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:18.230
So it just said,
thanks.

533
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:23.060
Thanks for letting a fucking all shit and Dick Jokes over here.

534
00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.530
Spend an hour and 15 minutes on that stage.
Can't fucking believe it.

535
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:32.390
Unbelievable.
All right.
That's it.
Enjoy the music.
And,
uh,

536
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:37.450
<v 6>I'll talk to you when I'm in my fifties age.</v>

537
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:41.710
All right,
here's a couple advertisements here.
Uh,

538
00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.670
express VPN.
You know,

539
00:33:45.671 --> 00:33:50.380
with all the news lately about data hacks and breaches,
data hacks and breaches,

540
00:33:50.381 --> 00:33:54.740
sorry,
it's hard for me not to worry about my digital privacy.
Well,

541
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:58.330
there's an understatement no matter what you do online,
your prop,

542
00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.640
your mobile carrier,
Internet service provide,

543
00:34:00.641 --> 00:34:04.750
are tracking it all bastards,
Comcast,
Verizon,

544
00:34:04.751 --> 00:34:05.680
Time Warner.

545
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:10.120
The list goes on these nosy bastards of trying to figure out what you're doing.

546
00:34:10.121 --> 00:34:12.760
Companies like these have a record of every single thing you do.

547
00:34:12.761 --> 00:34:16.120
Every website you visit,
every email you send,
it's ridiculous.

548
00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:21.310
So that's why I decided to take my privacy back by using express VPN.

549
00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:25.690
Is that what I did?
I wasn't aware of that these days.

550
00:34:25.691 --> 00:34:29.860
I don't use the Internet without it.
I hate when they write copy like this.

551
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:33.730
I totally believe in this.
If this is what they're going to do.
How about that?

552
00:34:33.731 --> 00:34:35.140

APPS that run theme of earthly and the background of your computer,

558
00:34:56.471 --> 00:35:01.180
phone and tablet turning on express VPN protection only takes a click no matter

559
00:35:01.181 --> 00:35:02.470
what you do online,

560
00:35:02.471 --> 00:35:07.060
whether you have something to hide is or you think you'd done that you don't

561

express VPN is for you.
Uh,

562
00:35:09.551 --> 00:35:14.551
if you're on unsecured Wifi and wanting to keep hackers and spice from seeing

563
00:35:15.401 --> 00:35:18.040
your data express VPN is for you,

564
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.480

565
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.410
the occasional porn.

566
00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:27.850
And if you don't want providers like Verizon recording your entire online

567
00:35:27.851 --> 00:35:30.130
history and then selling it to the whole world,

568

Your stomach and the rest of your life or it war.
Um,

578
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.601
you need to eat,

580
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:22.071
only things wash and the only fast things that deliver are not what you want.

581
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.490
That means you don't want fast food.
Why don't these people realize I'm dumb?

582
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.310

H I.
M.

605
00:37:59.051 --> 00:38:03.970
S is that hairline slowly starting to move backwards,
would it?

606
00:38:03.971 --> 00:38:08.140
How is this seven years ago?
Any bald spots yet?
Yeah,

607
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:12.310
all over my head.
How will you feel a year from now if you're,

608
00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:15.760
if it's business as usual up there?
I asked you,

609
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:20.440
do you want a bald spot to pop up or do you want to do something about it first?

610
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.620
Do you realize how big a vat of whatever the hell this is?

611
00:38:23.621 --> 00:38:24.454
They're gonna have to sell me.

612
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:28.000
Do you want your hairline to recede or do you want to do something about it

613
00:38:28.001 --> 00:38:32.350
first?
Why do guys turned to weird solutions or do nothing?

614
00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:34.960
What's called fucking being a man.
You,

615
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:38.800
I don't like other insult insulting me here.
Uh,

616
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.410

617

635
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:58.450

Sorry.

636
00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.010

637
00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:05.040
I m s.com/burr for hims.com/bar one more time cause I said it the wrong way for

638
00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:06.790
hymns

639
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:08.490
<v 2>doc.
Slash.
Bar.</v>

640
00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:52.770
<v 6>I got site subs right now.
I did a show in Dublin,</v>

641
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.633
Ireland

642
00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:55.443
<v 3>and</v>

643
00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:56.920
<v 6>all the crowds were great,</v>

644
00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:01.950
but I gotta tell you that those fucking people in Ireland as a funniest bit,

645
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:06.900
I can't even explain.
I swear it.
Well,

646
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:09.830
there's something about like when I go through Great Britain and Ireland,

647
00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.140
it's like Scotland and Ireland.

648
00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:16.880
They liked the knuckle heads that I grew up with.
And when I go to London,

649
00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:18.380
London is like,

650
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:23.650
it's kind of like all the people that I met when I went to New York that were

651
00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:27.130
from Boston.
So they,
they did move away from where they were from,

652
00:41:27.131 --> 00:41:31.210
but they still brought that thing with them cause people in London are
hilarious.

653
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:36.211
But I was doing a show Dublin on Monday night at the,

654
00:41:36.341 --> 00:41:40.640
the,
the vicar,
a vicar street theater or something.
Just this awesome venue.

655
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:42.800
And uh,
anyway,
so it was,

656
00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:47.120
it was on a Monday night and it's a really hard night to try and sell tickets

657
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.790
and these people showed up in force.

658
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:51.260
<v 0>Okay.</v>

659
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:56.170
<v 6>And I can't even tell you how
they were fucking hilarious.</v>

660
00:41:56.171 --> 00:42:01.171
Like I was on stage and there was this thing I was talking about about people

661
00:42:02.111 --> 00:42:06.100
hugging their kids and how that could put is a good thing.

662
00:42:06.101 --> 00:42:08.680
But if you do it too much,
it could potentially make a week or so.

663
00:42:08.681 --> 00:42:13.681
I mentioned and all I've been telling this story for like six to eight months

664
00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.530
and I've been saying how that,
you know,
my mother wasn't a hug,

665
00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:20.110
hug her and didn't hug us when we were kids.

666
00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:24.310
And people just listen and it's just a small detail that leads to this other

667
00:42:24.311 --> 00:42:25.690
part that I want to talk about.

668
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.530
So I've said that line

669
00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:34.260
uneventfully that's even a fucking word with no,

670
00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:38.430
no issue whatsoever for like six months.

671
00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.930
Now I'm in fucking Ireland and I just throw that line out there like I'm not

672
00:42:42.931 --> 00:42:44.460
even thinking about it and say,
yeah.
I said,
you know,

673
00:42:44.461 --> 00:42:47.790
my mother didn't hug me when I was a kid and I'm getting ready to say the next

674
00:42:47.791 --> 00:42:51.300
sentence.
And like 15% of the crowd goes,
aw,

675
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.560
I'm not even doing it the way they did.

676
00:42:57.561 --> 00:43:01.250
It just collectively broke my board.

677
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:04.520
It was just such the classic fucking,

678
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.990
it was like that Boston Irish thing that I grew up with distilled to its purest

679
00:43:08.991 --> 00:43:11.990
form with actually real Irish people were

680
00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:13.820
<v 0>okay.</v>

681
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:17.210
<v 6>You'd almost have to be that a fucking understand what was behind it.</v>

682
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.990
It was like I opened the emotional door,

683
00:43:20.991 --> 00:43:25.490
just a crack in automatically.
It's just,

684
00:43:25.491 --> 00:43:28.810
they just bust your balls about it.
Like,
ah,
you're fucking,
you know what I like?

685
00:43:28.811 --> 00:43:30.560
And you think they,
I think we got hugs.

686
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:35.770
You freckled can't shut the fuck up and tell the judge I can't even,
it just,
I,

687
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.260
I've been trying to,
I would try to explain it to Nia.
She laughed,
but it's still,

688
00:43:39.261 --> 00:43:42.410
yeah,
you kind of had to be there and then,

689
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:44.140
<v 0>yeah.</v>

690
00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.030
<v 6>You know,
so I laugh.</v>

691
00:43:45.031 --> 00:43:47.750
So when I'm a fucking trying to get your sympathy and trying to get to this
mess,

692
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:50.110
next part you assholes on the whole crowd.
Fucking laughs.

693
00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.880
<v 0>I see.
When I was growing up,
uh,
you know,
my mother never hugged us.</v>

694
00:43:54.881 --> 00:43:56.860
We didn't come from a family like that.
You know what I name

695
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.863
<v 8>say?
This</v>

696
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:07.120
island of no hugs.
I have your blood in me,
so don't fucking look at dam.

697
00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.500
That's totally what that was.

698
00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:16.020
Mom's did nagase a bucket.
What are you pitching a box?

699
00:44:16.021 --> 00:44:18.590
You Pussy for the love of God.
Let me get through it.

700
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:27.870
Do you need any fucking countries?
I've said that in and nobody says shit.

701
00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:35.280
An extra fun to try it and then we'll have a drink.

702
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:39.330
All the fucking Goddamn Mary.
Yes.

703
00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.780
I guess you still have bullying but it continues on it.

704
00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.760
<v 6>And then like a half hour later,</v>

705
00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:57.520
what I had done when I was over there was I bought a bunch of DVDs with me.
Um,

706
00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:01.590
like just the,
uh,
basically the DVD itself,

707
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:02.920
this little paper thing.

708
00:45:02.921 --> 00:45:05.530
And I was just handing them out to people cause I'm trying to get them to show

709
00:45:05.531 --> 00:45:07.690
other people,
you know,

710
00:45:07.691 --> 00:45:10.570
when I'm out there so I can keep coming back.

711
00:45:10.571 --> 00:45:13.430
Basically trying to get them to spread the word in my comedy.

712
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.000
And then someone's just like,
well why don't you just put it on Spotify?

713
00:45:16.001 --> 00:45:18.670
You're dumb fucking,
I'm like,
yeah cause I'm old.
Alright.

714
00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:22.210
I feel like I have to bring the hard copy.
So I tell these assholes,

715
00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:26.260
then I've given them free DVDs at the end of the show

716
00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.930
and I'm halfway through that spiel telling them that they're getting a free DVD.

717
00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:36.580
All right?
And I'm in the middle of it and I hate this guy in the back.

718
00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:38.890
That guy goes,
oh fuck off.

719
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:48.100
I don't even think I didn't even,
he explained what I was doing.

720
00:45:48.101 --> 00:45:50.440
I don't know if I had gotten to the part where they were free.

721
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.510
I don't know what the fuck.

722
00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.290
Always the fact that I was trying to once again go to a nice place where,
hey,

723
00:45:56.291 --> 00:45:58.330
you know,
I really appreciate you guys coming out.

724
00:45:58.331 --> 00:46:02.050
This really means a lot to me and I want to keep coming back here cause I think

725
00:46:02.051 --> 00:46:04.190
he got a great comp country or whatever at night.

726
00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:08.260
She's just opening the door that much.
Oh fuck off.

727
00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.040
So I finally just looked at,
I went,
Jesus Christ,

728
00:46:12.041 --> 00:46:13.540
they were already laughed and I was like,
you know what?

729
00:46:13.541 --> 00:46:16.930
I played in 20 almost 22 years as a comedian.

730
00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:22.140
I have played in front of some miserable motherfuckers but you guys and they

731
00:46:23.261 --> 00:46:27.170
were already laughing are the most miserable fucking concert I've ever been in

732
00:46:27.171 --> 00:46:31.630
and they loved it,
absolutely loved it.
And um,

733
00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:35.620
it killed me that I couldn't go out drinking with the crowd cause they had a

734
00:46:35.621 --> 00:46:39.010
fucking go a head,
an early flight of course,
all the way over to Helsinki.

735
00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.430
Totally.
And I like I did,

736
00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:44.010
I brought a bunch of Dvds and everything that complimentary.

737
00:46:44.011 --> 00:46:44.940
If you guys coming up,

738
00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.200
<v 8>you said fuck off.
You don't want them</v>

739
00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:52.840
to take one.

740
00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:00.120
[inaudible] like I drove into the back of your car.

741
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:26.290
[inaudible]

742
00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.033
<v 2>Huh?</v>

743
00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:58.420
<v 5>I did the Kilkenny festival and Kilkenny Ireland and that one,</v>

744
00:47:59.001 --> 00:48:02.330
I don't remember Manet's on fries as much as I remember how many pints of

745
00:48:02.331 --> 00:48:07.331
Guinness I drank and this we got hammered and this great laugh than I had with

746
00:48:07.791 --> 00:48:11.210
dom.
I rarer,
me and dom were like,
we were just like,

747
00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:15.470
we would like cliff and norm at chairs and just walking around that city and

748
00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:18.350
everybody else would go to bed and we would still be like carousing right.

749
00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.000
So one night we're walking up,

750
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.930
it's like fucking at probably two in the morning on like a Sunday night.
So,

751
00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.350
you know,
sleepy town,
everybody's asleep.

752
00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:31.580
We're walking up these cobblestones and the fucking moonlight.
Alright.

753
00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:32.960
Like werewolves in London,
Shit.

754
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:36.910
It had rained so they would like the moonlight was glistening and we're walking

755
00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.430
up and it's fucking quiet as hell on were drunk and were laughing but trying not

756
00:48:40.431 --> 00:48:42.780
to,
you know,
wait for somebody to throw up in the shutters.
Right?
Hey Joe,

757
00:48:42.781 --> 00:48:44.440
hey required here.
Right.

758
00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:48.010
And we were walking up the thing and we're trying to find a bar that's still

759
00:48:48.011 --> 00:48:52.780
open and all of a sudden we just heard these,
these,
you know,
these Irish singers.

760
00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:56.620
Okay.
What time was this?
This was like two in the morning on a Sunday night.

761
00:48:56.621 --> 00:48:59.980
So we just start following the sound of them singing,
come up please.

762
00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:03.220
Cobblestones.
And then it sounds like the beginning of a great movie,
right?

763
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:04.670
Came up and become down.

764
00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:07.810
We see the light on in this bar and we come walking in it.
By the time we get in,

765
00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.270
um,
you know,

766
00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.940
this guy was singing with two other people and they had gone up to the bar,

767
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.440
so it was only one guy singing when we came walking in and we come walking in

768
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.010
and it's just a bunch of townies sitting there way more seats than people.

769
00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:25.770
Little empty,
but a small place.
And this guy's on stage just singing.

770
00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:30.770
I got my,
my shake 80 82 80.
He's singing this fucking thing,
right?

771
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:35.000
And we're taking the bar and we look and there's this guy sitting right in front

772
00:49:35.001 --> 00:49:37.940
of the stage and dude,
he was passed out at a level.

773
00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:42.290
You'd never get this drunk in an American bar.
They'd send you home,
dude,

774
00:49:42.291 --> 00:49:45.650
this guy,
he looks good.
This guy was completely passed.
I'll never forget,

775
00:49:45.651 --> 00:49:50.600
he had one arm was slung over the back of the chair and then his head was just

776
00:49:50.601 --> 00:49:53.180
hanging straight down.
When you're still behind him,
you couldn't see his head.

777
00:49:53.181 --> 00:49:55.480
You just saw like his,
that this is next.

778
00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.250
So the back of his neck and he was just sitting there hanging in there.

779
00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:02.540
It looked like he had gotten shot and we walked in and nobody was really talking

780
00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:06.200
and this is guys slumped over and all we hear is it and everybody turns around

781
00:50:06.201 --> 00:50:09.240
and looks at us.
And meanwhile that guy's in the background going,
Eh,

782
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.770
green alligator,
long neck,
goose show,
whatever.

783
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:17.090
And he fucking look at each other.

784
00:50:17.091 --> 00:50:20.570
And it was like one of those things where we now we can't leave.
So we are,

785
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.150
we walk up to the bar and they ask,
you know,

786
00:50:23.151 --> 00:50:26.210
really thick Irish brogue what we want in order to a couple of genesis.

787
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:28.080
And I'm sitting there trying to hold it the other,

788
00:50:28.081 --> 00:50:32.520
cause I know I can't look at dom and I'm hearing dom starting to laugh and this

789
00:50:32.521 --> 00:50:35.430
guy is still singing and dom starts,

790
00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.740
dom starts riffing,

791
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:43.430
he starts riffing lyrics to what this guy singing and he's just in my ear going,

792
00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:47.850
I get,
I shuffled [inaudible] and he's to this thing and do it.
We started,

793
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:53.650
we started fucking laughing and we couldn't stop like to school goes and the

794
00:50:54.181 --> 00:50:58.620
whole thing was what was keeping it going was if there's tension like in like in

795
00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:02.430
high school or Middle School when the teacher goes to the next personal left,

796
00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:06.480
yeah.
Gets fucking detention.
Like that tension makes you,

797
00:51:06.481 --> 00:51:08.180
you can't stop fucking no,
no.
Yeah.

798
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.650
So we knew they were looking at it and I'm getting nervous.
Like I,

799
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:12.630
they think we're laughing at their country and all this.

800
00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:16.170
So I'm trying to be polite and not laugh at all.
It just,
it just do it.

801
00:51:16.171 --> 00:51:18.300
It was this fucking wave of laughing.
I remember,

802
00:51:18.301 --> 00:51:22.320
I've never seen dom like I was looking at,
he literally like,

803
00:51:22.321 --> 00:51:26.720
his mouth was open and he had tears.
It,
it,

804
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.510
and then what was cracking me up was it looked like almost like he was crying

805
00:51:30.511 --> 00:51:33.000
and that what that guy was singing was making me cry.

806
00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:36.380
So then there was another wave of laughs,
oh my God,

807
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:38.910
the guy's just slunched over and,
and the whole time.

808
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.520
And then like the bartender would look at me like,

809
00:51:41.521 --> 00:51:43.590
what the fuck are you laughing at?
And I would look over,

810
00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:47.610
look away and all I could look at with this guy slumped over and it's this guy

811
00:51:47.611 --> 00:51:48.780
on stage and he was singing,

812
00:51:48.781 --> 00:51:52.680
he had his eyebrows up and he was hitting these fucking high notes and do it
was,

813
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.350
it was torture,
but it was a great laugh.

814
00:51:55.351 --> 00:51:59.820
But it was that whole thing probably took all of four minutes.
But like Mike,

815
00:51:59.821 --> 00:52:03.840
Mike,
Mike,
my stomach was fucking killing me.
Oh my God.

816
00:52:03.841 --> 00:52:04.840
I would have loved to see the,

817
00:52:04.841 --> 00:52:06.930
I would have loved to somewhere in those adventures.
I think

818
00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:11.760
<v 2>I picked up.
Oh,
that's a great story.
That's fine.</v>

819
00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:01.660
<v 5>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

820
00:53:01.661 --> 00:53:06.661
It's bill burns the Monday morning podcast for June 7th,

821
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:12.280
2010 how the hell are you?
What's going?
Are you get better?

822
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:14.563
<v 4>MMM.</v>

823
00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.930
<v 5>Jesus Christ.
I can't get away from that fucking oil spill.</v>

824
00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:20.143
<v 4>No.</v>

825
00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:23.180
<v 5>Try to go out to a bar.
You try to drink your troubles away.</v>

826
00:53:23.181 --> 00:53:26.070
And every time I look up to some fucking burger getting picked up

827
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:29.730
<v 6>by scientist,
you know,
I like,
I wouldn't,
you know,</v>

828
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.080
when they pick up the bird,

829
00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:33.630
they still have to make sure that the bird doesn't like fucking bite.

830
00:53:33.631 --> 00:53:38.410
The shit out of him still was picking up a Pelican,
you know?

831
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:41.730
And he's got his,
he's got his gardener glove and he's holding the beak shut.

832
00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:46.440
He's fucking stupid animals.
It's like,
dude,
I'm trying to help you.
You know,

833
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:50.670
I can't help you if you don't want help.
You know,
you dumb fuck,

834
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:55.500
look at me.
The one at each show.
Would I be gingerly picking you up?

835
00:53:55.501 --> 00:54:00.500
Why are you trying to bite me?
That shit you're covered in his oil.

836
00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:04.390
All you dumb.
Fuck.
If you weren't such a stupid bird,
you,

837
00:54:04.391 --> 00:54:08.660
you'd understand the gas combustion engine,

838
00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:14.180
you know?
Um.
Anyways,
whatever.

839
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:19.400
Blaming the victim here is fucking unreal,
man.
Can they just kept that shit?

840
00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:23.510
All right.
You know,
I'll Dama my dual can it,
can,
they just can't.

841
00:54:23.511 --> 00:54:25.010
They just put a top on it,
you know,

842
00:54:25.011 --> 00:54:26.900
for the first time I actually looked at the spill.

843
00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:29.000
There's certain things that I just can't watch.

844
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:31.430
The second I heard what was going on down there,

845
00:54:31.431 --> 00:54:35.390
it's like I'm not going to watch that shit because I have absolutely no power

846
00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:40.310
to,
to stop it.
All I can do is just sit there watching it going,

847
00:54:40.311 --> 00:54:43.610
fuck,
you know,

848
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:48.800
whatever.
What are you gonna do?
What do you,
what the fuck?

849
00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:53.940
How the fuck do you stop it
once the blue spoon.

850
00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.750

00:55:08.971 --> 00:55:11.780
Who have just side whoever just rolled your fucking eyes,
right?

856
00:55:11.781 --> 00:55:14.900
You don't have a medium energy day.
Well,
you don't put in the fucking effort.

857
00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:20.540
You know,
like what's his face that power forward for the fucking Lakers,

858
00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:24.860
who's full of gummy bears and every other fucking game is sugar crashes and he's

859
00:55:24.861 --> 00:55:28.910
not worth a shit.
How are we sick?
His name is not Lamar Odom.

860
00:55:28.911 --> 00:55:32.030
I always think it's Riley Odom who I believe was a guy who played for the

861
00:55:32.031 --> 00:55:33.080
fucking Broncos,

862
00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:37.880
Riley old hymns and the 70s what was it?

863
00:55:37.881 --> 00:55:42.110
Haven Moses.
I Dunno.
I Dunno where these names come through,
but I'm sick.

864
00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:46.730
You know everybody fucking talking about the God damn oil spill.
You know,

865
00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.940
acting like human beings are the fucking worst.

866
00:55:48.941 --> 00:55:52.090
Went down there and we're trying to help these filthy animals in and in,

867
00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:55.220
in the effort to help them.
This does still attacking us.

868
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:57.370
<v 9>Okay.</v>

869
00:55:57.370 --> 00:56:02.350
<v 6>You know,
it's like,
dude,
I can't help you.
You know,
you have to want help.
Okay,</v>

870
00:56:02.351 --> 00:56:05.110
you got it.
You got to want to change.
You got to want to come out of the Muck,

871
00:56:05.111 --> 00:56:06.730
dude.
All right.

872
00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.050
I got to fucking pull you onto this sludge and cover your mouth at the same

873
00:56:11.051 --> 00:56:14.650
fucking time.
What it was this,
some sort of Jujitsu,

874
00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:19.900
some animal Jujitsu.
Oh,
Jesus.
Morning Sweetheart.

875
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:22.630
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

876
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:25.390
<v 5>What was with little,
yeah,
okay.
You know,</v>

877
00:56:25.391 --> 00:56:28.510
some days when your significant other walks by a you just now this is one of

878
00:56:28.511 --> 00:56:29.740
these days,
you know,

879
00:56:29.741 --> 00:56:32.050
those couple of points that I want to make in the relationship.

880
00:56:32.051 --> 00:56:34.210
I'll wait till tomorrow to try and make those points.

881
00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:41.500
Whew.
Jesus Christ.

882
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:47.400
She looked like a fucking future hall of fame quarterback in the twilight of her

883
00:56:47.861 --> 00:56:52.120
career in the morning.
You know,
that's how she,
when she walked by Jesus Christ,

884
00:56:52.121 --> 00:56:54.340
that was such a great fucking reference.
And I butchered it.

885
00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:58.810
She looked like a future hall of Famer in the twilight.

886
00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:02.890
I th I think I did it backwards.
What MCV?
Paula pit pitbulls tail.

887
00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:06.130
He liked that Cleo.
You're like,
I don't pull it.
I just hold onto it.

888
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:11.890
<v 6>All right.
Get out of my face.
Look at you.
You're not covered in oil.</v>

889
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.020
Would you try to bite me if I pulled you out?
You wouldn't,

890
00:57:14.021 --> 00:57:18.330
you'd be sitting there going,
oh,
all right.
So anyways,
um,

891
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:22.630
speaking of the Lakers and Celtics,
um,
it's just,

892
00:57:22.631 --> 00:57:26.940
just a fucking insane time of the year with the NBA finals and the Nhl finals

893
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:29.020
are on at the same time.
You know,

894
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:33.250
and women just go crazy cause they loving it.

895
00:57:33.251 --> 00:57:35.200
They love and every second of the sports,

896
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:42.390
my girl watches every fucking TV show then involves let's take the dumbest

897
00:57:43.301 --> 00:57:48.250
comment from the stupidest state and uh,
just start documenting their family,

898
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:50.150
you know,
and then that,

899
00:57:50.151 --> 00:57:54.820
then the people start ramping up the stupid because the cameras are on.

900
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:57.020
I went in there,
she was watching something.

901
00:57:57.050 --> 00:58:01.930
They had just a bunch of dumb skanks from Jersey planning a fucking wedding in

902
00:58:01.931 --> 00:58:04.450
rather than addressing the real issue,

903
00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:08.050
which is that these people are gonna fucking procreate.

904
00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:11.980
They're actually dealing with this little shit about,
oh my God,

905
00:58:11.981 --> 00:58:13.440
I wanna wear Chiffon

906
00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:18.940
and all my skanky bridesmaids,
you know,

907
00:58:18.941 --> 00:58:23.230
with their scraped out uteruses from all those abortions have to wear the same

908
00:58:23.231 --> 00:58:26.170
fucking color.
I mean that's television people.
I don't think it is.

909
00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:30.220
It's not television.
How do we go from Lawrence Welk to that number?

910
00:58:30.221 --> 00:58:31.690
When we had family values,

911
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:35.320
Lawrence Welk had so many morals.

912
00:58:35.321 --> 00:58:39.480
It was actually creepy hub on then to two,

913
00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:43.540
go on youtube and go look up the Lawrence Welk show.

914
00:58:43.541 --> 00:58:48.010
There was a dance team on there.
Bobby and Susie or something.
Just the widest,

915
00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:52.390
purest.
Um,
let's go spoon with Jesus.

916
00:58:52.391 --> 00:58:55.350
Fucking white names you could ever come up with.
And they used to do these.

917
00:58:55.780 --> 00:59:00.780
They used to fucking dance these stupid smiles on their face and it was just

918
00:59:01.091 --> 00:59:05.610
that classic little skippy dues.
Skippy do all across the fucking

919
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:11.710
the fucking stupid dance floor,
you know?

920
00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:15.250
You know they both had fucking eating disorders.
God goddamn dancers.

921
00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:17.980
You've got to have the body of a fucking seventh grade or your entire life.

922
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:21.650
It's like if 35 years old,
what do you eat?
Huh?

923
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:28.280
Fucking handful of cottage cheese before you go out the God damn door.
Cleo,

924
00:59:28.281 --> 00:59:30.950
get up.
Get away from me.
Come on.
You sniff it up my feet.

925
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:32.360
I'm trying to focus here.

926
00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:34.170
<v 4>Okay.</v>

927
00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:36.780
<v 6>Dogs are so fucking emotional.
Look at that.
Look on your face.</v>

928
00:59:36.781 --> 00:59:40.920
You really just had a sad look on your face.
Now you're making me feel bad.
Hmm.

929
00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:46.800
Anyways,
talking about the Lawrence Welk show.

930
00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:52.890
Go look that shit up.
It was just,
it was just,
it was fucking horrible.

931
00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.830
Some of those shows back then,
you know,
that's,

932
00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.600
that's kind of like what I grew up on.
Ya know,

933
00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.590
I just saw those shows and I sat down and watched it for the longest time.

934
01:00:01.591 --> 01:00:05.460
That was like music to me,
you know,
and I asked for,
uh,

935
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:09.780
I want to record,
I want to,
I wanted some music for my birthday at the,

936
01:00:09.781 --> 01:00:12.300
I don't even know what,
I didn't know what it was.
I just wanted to record,

937
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:13.933
give me a record.

938
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:19.080
And the first record I was given was a sing along with Mitch and the gang.

939
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.440
It was a Mitch Miller record.
You know,

940
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.760
I always wondered why I never got laid in high school.
But you know,
when,

941
01:00:25.761 --> 01:00:29.220
when you're,
when you're weaned on roll out the barrel,

942
01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.830
oh,
he's other kids at singing like fucking Aerosmith and led Zeppelin.

943
01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:42.150
And I'm like,
won't you come Home Bill Bailey,
won't you come home?
You love her.

944
01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:43.740
<v 10>Whoa.</v>

945
01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:49.310
<v 6>You know what kind of kid and the third grade wants to play the Banjo.</v>

946
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.070
I didn't know any better.
I didn't know that there was electric guitar.

947
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:56.690
I actually liked it to book fucking Mickey Finn.

948
01:00:58.030 --> 01:01:02.360
Huh?
The fucking something.
Or Robert E.
Lee.
That was like one of my favorite song.

949
01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:06.800
Ted Heath Orchestra Elks parade.
Those are my jams.

950
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:10.750
I used to sit there and you know,

951
01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.700
normal kids would sit there and they'll listen to like some fucking

952
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:15.530
<v 4>yeah.</v>

953
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:19.010
<v 6>You know,
classic rock and then fantasize about being able to play it.</v>

954
01:01:19.011 --> 01:01:23.600
First of all,
the fucking hot broads in their 14th fifth,
fourth grade class,

955
01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:26.030
you know,
normal fantasies.

956
01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:30.620
I was actually thinking about playing the trumpet Solo on one o'clock jump

957
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:38.710
that'll get on bill that have them all lined up,
you know,

958
01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:43.090
the extra saliva mouths with their fucking braces.

959
01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.460
I always loved that when kids got braces.
I lucked out.

960
01:01:45.461 --> 01:01:48.800
I never had to have braces.
Kids had braces and like the,

961
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:52.210
they'll give body thinking it's food for the first fucking two weeks trying to

962
01:01:52.211 --> 01:01:53.044
break it down.

963
01:01:56.870 --> 01:02:00.170
Very shakable um,
ah,

964
01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.770
fucking elastic bands.

965
01:02:02.771 --> 01:02:05.260
What are these fucking pussy kids have nowadays where they got that?

966
01:02:05.261 --> 01:02:07.780
He got that clear channel Shit they put in there.
Whatever the fuck it is.

967
01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:11.680
The clear I was at the fucking stuff the athletes take

968
01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.473
<v 4>mmm.</v>

969
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.980
<v 6>At a fucking what the fuck is.
And you know that that shit where</v>

970
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.370
<v 5>it's just a plastic mouth guard you put in your mouth and you don't have to go</v>

971
01:02:23.371 --> 01:02:25.680
through the torture.
The kids,
you know,

972
01:02:25.681 --> 01:02:28.650
from my grade had to go through this is like,
really,

973
01:02:28.651 --> 01:02:31.640
that's like old school standup material,
you know,

974
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:34.740
having to go there and get your fucking braces tightened.
You know,
right now,

975
01:02:34.741 --> 01:02:37.440
Mike,
Mike,
Mike,
Mike,
Mike,
Mike,
Mike,
Mike,
Mike.

976
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:41.900
I ain't [inaudible] on my computer screen.
Went to um,

977
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:47.130
the save mode and what it does is it,
it,

978
01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:52.131
it puts up all the albums that I've downloaded onto my douchey fucking iPod,

979
01:02:52.141 --> 01:02:52.980
which sucks,

980
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.120
which breaks every six months or needs to be updated because he can't handle the

981
01:02:57.121 --> 01:03:00.990
new technology.
I have an,
I have a nice mix of music here,

982
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:05.490
Gordon Lightfoot.
Oh,
this is some easy listening to shit.
Sting.

983
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.570
God smacked.
Let me try to get some credibility.
Houses of the holy,

984
01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:12.960
one of the worst lead's up on albums ever except for two songs.

985
01:03:12.961 --> 01:03:17.370
The rain song and fucking no quarter,
the crunch is,

986
01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:21.570
I am going to elect is one of the worst songs ever written by a great band.

987
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.353
<v 4>MMM.</v>

988
01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:29.630
<v 5>Oh,
Stevie wonder,
what does that one songs in the key of a odd,
is it Jay z one?</v>

989
01:03:29.631 --> 01:03:32.630
I don't know why I have that.
Which one is that one?

990
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:35.750
Is that the one where he was going to retire,
but then he didn't lamb of God.

991
01:03:35.751 --> 01:03:38.270
The Romantics.
Remember that one?
What I like about you,

992
01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:43.160
when they had the red suits on red leather suits and there was nothing wrong

993
01:03:43.161 --> 01:03:43.994
with it.

994
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:49.760
I'm at one with Justin Timberlake steps on the crystal ball,
the disco ball,

995
01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.260
cause he was bringing sexy back.
Remember that?
Wham,

996
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:59.540
Wham,
wham,
um,
Neil young harvest moon,

997
01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:05.060
Merle.
Travis,
look at me.
I'm all over the fucking map.

998
01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:08.930
1950s hits and highlights the nerves.

999
01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.080
Any this best of brick.

1000
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.570
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1001
01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:15.640
<v 5>Jeff Beck truth that album.
Huh?</v>

1002
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:19.900
Remember that one that had half a led Zeppelin one Chaco Pastoria

1003
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.240
<v 6>audio slave.
It's a super group.
Okay,
let's plow ahead here.
Um,</v>

1004
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.060
I started to talk about Lakers,
Celtics,
and,
uh,

1005
01:04:30.061 --> 01:04:33.420
I'm gonna extend an olive branch right now and rather than doing the usual and

1006
01:04:33.421 --> 01:04:37.420
going off and that type of shit,
I want,
I want to,
you know what?

1007
01:04:37.421 --> 01:04:39.180
I'm even going to drag in the hockey fans too.

1008
01:04:39.181 --> 01:04:42.390
I want to talk right now to fans or the Celtics,
the Lakers,

1009
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:46.870
the Black Hawks and the flyers because,
uh,
I,

1010
01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:50.190
I got a question because I'm having a fucking heart attack.

1011
01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:52.440
I'm aging like seven years,

1012
01:04:52.441 --> 01:04:57.441
which eat with each point that is scored or not scored in a,

1013
01:04:58.330 --> 01:05:01.240
the Celtics Lakers series.
And a,
I going to ask you,

1014
01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:06.060
you big sports fans out there.
Why do we give a fuck?

1015
01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:08.363
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1016
01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:13.390
<v 6>You know what?
It's,
it's fucking stupid.
I get it.
I get,
I mean,</v>

1017
01:05:13.391 --> 01:05:14.110
you know,
you were this,

1018
01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:18.580
I give a fuck so much than I'm actually jealous of people who don't give a shit.

1019
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:24.280
Like last night after I watched the game,
like,
you know,
I felt like I got,

1020
01:05:24.281 --> 01:05:27.940
I got acquitted or something.
Like that's the level of stress.

1021
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.870
I'm just sitting there,
you know,

1022
01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:36.820
like fucking r Kelly thinking there's no way.
There's no fucking way.

1023
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:41.800
Holy Shit.
They had video.
It looks just like you.
I know,

1024
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:44.740
but it's not me.
You know?

1025
01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:49.090
All those years it'd be offended when everybody says we all look alike.

1026
01:05:49.091 --> 01:05:54.091
Now I'm saying we all look alike because I peed on a 12 year old amongst other

1027
01:05:55.271 --> 01:05:58.670
things.
All right,
let's plow ahead here.
Um,

1028
01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:04.210
why do we give a fuck to that law?
Like I'm sitting there like,
this is,

1029
01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:08.170
this is how much I give a shit.
I know you guys are going to think this is nuts.

1030
01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.080
I actually had an opportunity to,

1031
01:06:10.081 --> 01:06:12.220
somebody at the last second had a ticket to the game.

1032
01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:16.030
It's a 20 minute fucking ride down the street and I turned it down.

1033
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:21.550
I turned it down because I,
first of all,
I already went to an NBA finals game.

1034
01:06:21.551 --> 01:06:26.290
I already went,
okay,
so I checked that off the bucket list.
I went to the Lakers,

1035
01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:30.130
Celtics actually lost Lakers,
Celtics final.
You don't.

1036
01:06:30.131 --> 01:06:32.560
If you're going to go to a final game,
that's the great thing.

1037
01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:37.330
And I went into enemy territory with my fucking Celtic shirt on and I basically

1038
01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:42.100
paid like 400 bucks or whatever the fuck to sit in the last row of the staple

1039
01:06:42.101 --> 01:06:46.630
center to every five seconds to have somebody go sale takes our beaches.

1040
01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.510
You know,
I,

1041
01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:56.520
it's like I paid to get verbally fucking abused and to not hear the commentating

1042
01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.530
and all that type of shit,
but it was still awesome to be there.
But,
um,
I,
I,

1043
01:07:02.531 --> 01:07:07.390
it's like I give a fuck too much.
I want to hear the God damn game.

1044
01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:11.530
I don't want to sit there and have to look around fat fucks and drunks getting

1045
01:07:11.531 --> 01:07:15.380
up to get their goddamn beer and listen to their stupid shit.
I know it's,

1046
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:19.420
it's not worth it.
I'm paying money to be tortured.
I don't want to do it.

1047
01:07:19.421 --> 01:07:22.120
So I actually stayed in my living room

1048
01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:25.930
and I watched the game on mute.

1049
01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:31.350
I can't even listen to the fucking announcers cause they drive me nuts.

1050
01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:35.050
And half of it is because sometimes they say dumb shit.

1051
01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:40.051
And the other half is because I'm so psychotically into my team that I am

1052
01:07:40.421 --> 01:07:44.230
convinced that everyone in the booth hates my team,

1053
01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:46.840
secretly hates my fucking team.

1054
01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:51.220
I actually have a debate with Paul Versey comedian,
right?
Dude,

1055
01:07:51.221 --> 01:07:53.680
who opens up for me.
You people in New York on the east coast,

1056
01:07:53.681 --> 01:07:58.330
you've seen them don't act like you haven't,
um,
or even down in Atlanta.

1057
01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.550
Oh yeah.
The dude,
I don't name names,

1058
01:08:00.551 --> 01:08:04.090
he may or may not have been the guy I went to fucking the master's with in bed

1059
01:08:04.091 --> 01:08:07.410
on the turtles.
But anyways,
um,

1060
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:12.940
he's convinced that Tim McCarver hates the fucking Yankees and I'm like,
dude,

1061
01:08:12.941 --> 01:08:14.620
he hates the fucking red sox.

1062
01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:19.850
And then we just kind of came to a conclusion that,
uh,

1063
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:20.893
you know,

1064
01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:25.490
it's kind of in our head and also the Tim McCarver might kind of be a Douche a

1065
01:08:25.491 --> 01:08:29.150
little bit.
I think he likes the cardinals because that's who we played for.

1066
01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.300
But whatever,
I'm getting off track like that.
Don't you wish,

1067
01:08:32.301 --> 01:08:35.840
do you have a wishlist?
Sometimes you didn't give a fuck.
You know what I mean?

1068
01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.050
Like after I did my show and went down.
I mean,

1069
01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:41.840
actually after I watched the Lakers game,
I went down the street and,
uh,

1070
01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.060
I did stand up and a,

1071
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:47.660
I came walking in and I was talking to some dude who was from New Hampshire.

1072
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:52.220
So I'm like,
oh,
Celtics,
right?
And he's like,
yeah,
yeah.
He goes,
they win tonight.

1073
01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:57.410
And I'm like,
you fucking Dick.
You fucking,
yeah,
they won.

1074
01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:58.731
Yeah,
they want.
Okay.

1075
01:08:58.731 --> 01:09:01.850
So now you get to have the joy that they won and you didn't have to go through

1076
01:09:01.851 --> 01:09:04.700
the fucking cardiac arrest that I went through.

1077
01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:08.660
Oh,
it's unreal.
When the Lakers stock coming back,

1078
01:09:08.661 --> 01:09:11.810
I got to walk out of the fucking room.
Literally,
I walk out of the room,

1079
01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:16.100
come back in,
I peek,
peek back into the fucking my can't fucking take it.

1080
01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:20.030
It's like the oil spill.
It's like this fucking thing that I want to turn out.

1081
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:24.380
Right.
And,
and it isn't,
and there's nothing I can fucking do about it.

1082
01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:28.640
I'm just sitting there fucking helpless,
you know?

1083
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:33.380
I don't know what I gotta do.
I gotta I gotta be on like a fucking stair master,

1084
01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:36.650
like some broad will.
I watch it to get that extra energy out.

1085
01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:39.590
I fucking like every like seven minutes.

1086
01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:44.591
I'll take the mute button off and I can listen to a sentence and a half before

1087
01:09:44.691 --> 01:09:48.560
van Gundy or somebody else.
All these,
these fucking guys who played the game,

1088
01:09:48.561 --> 01:09:49.371
coached the game,

1089
01:09:49.371 --> 01:09:52.550
know way more about the game and I am immediately convinced that they don't know

1090
01:09:52.551 --> 01:09:53.960
what the fuck they're talking about.

1091
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:57.470
And I start yelling at my TV like a God damn maniac.

1092
01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.590
I'll tell you what else fucking sucks.
That's right.

1093
01:10:01.591 --> 01:10:04.770
I'm on a roll here about shit that sucks fucking,

1094
01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:07.320
I lived in New York,

1095
01:10:07.321 --> 01:10:12.060
like I'm so fucking sick of living in the city that is the arch rival of the,

1096
01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.070
of one of my teams,
you know,

1097
01:10:14.071 --> 01:10:17.790
and all day long I got to look at these fucking Laker flags flapping off the

1098
01:10:17.791 --> 01:10:22.020
side of the cars.
You know those things.
A Gay,
by the way,

1099
01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:23.740
you drive down the streets with,
you flew

1100
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:29.490
with your fucking team flags in the window.
You seen those little clip on.
Thanks.

1101
01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:34.260
Actually I see them and I start,
I start getting angry.
You know what I mean?

1102
01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.400
Like it's a fucking alcaide a flag.
Do they have a flag?

1103
01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.530
You know,
what is,
what does it have them a sneak it into a pizza parlor,

1104
01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:47.580
crouching in a cave
fucking punks.

1105
01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:53.140
Um,
I just,
I,
I see them and I just want to fucking,

1106
01:10:53.170 --> 01:10:58.170
uh,
you know,
I don't know for some reason,
like,
like wire cutters.

1107
01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:03.000
I don't know why you'd need wire cutters to cut a plastic poor excuse for a

1108
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:05.730
flagpole.
I just want to snip them off

1109
01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:12.960
when we went.
What did we really bill,
you take it to that level.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I,

1110
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:14.680
<v 9>okay.</v>

1111
01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:17.770
<v 6>I don't do it,
but like,
I want to,
I want to,</v>

1112
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:21.250
I would've gone to that Laker game,
uh,

1113
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:26.270
yesterday and I would've fantasized about beating the shit out of everybody in

1114
01:11:28.741 --> 01:11:33.660
my row,
you know,
and the Celtics winning by 40.

1115
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.380
It's not healthy.
It's not fucking healthy.
Look at my leg,

1116
01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:42.080
my legs fucking shaking right now.
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here.
So,

1117
01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.320
yeah.
So basically I lived,

1118
01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:46.400
I lived in New York during the height of the curse of the baby.

1119
01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:49.100
Every time I wanted to go see the red sox,

1120
01:11:49.101 --> 01:11:54.101
I had to sit and fucking Yankee stadium had people go 1918 you know,

1121
01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:57.680
and I got that Catholic fucking,
you know,
punish me shit.

1122
01:11:57.681 --> 01:12:01.010
So I'd show up with my red sox shit on,
you know.

1123
01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.080
And at that point we hadn't won in 86 years.

1124
01:12:03.081 --> 01:12:06.740
So all I could do was just personally attack the looks of the person,

1125
01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:09.710
you know,
make fun out of their hat,

1126
01:12:09.711 --> 01:12:13.280
looks stupid on their head or some shit like that.
And they would be like,

1127
01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:17.180
well what,
what does your have to do with championships?
Nothing.

1128
01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:20.240
You fucking idiot.
We haven't won in [inaudible] 86 years.
I got nothing here.

1129
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:22.800
All you can talk about is how you,
how,

1130
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:26.930
how neatly your man tits sit on your fucking,
your beer belly.

1131
01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:34.530
I Dunno.
So then whatever the red sox finally won and I can breathe,

1132
01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.730
you know,
what song is that?
I can breathe again,

1133
01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.680
can breathe again.

1134
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.400
One of those fucking 80 songs he thought really meant something

1135
01:12:47.710 --> 01:12:51.230
<v 12>down and down and down and have now</v>

1136
01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:56.960
<v 6>the fuck was it.
I was a lot of reverb.
Reverb makes up for a lot.</v>

1137
01:12:56.961 --> 01:13:01.130
That's like the poor man's fucking autotune.
Um,
anyways,

1138
01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:06.080
fuck am I talking about here?
Yeah.
So then that shit ends,
you know,
Celtics,

1139
01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:08.150
a dead in the fucking water then I,

1140
01:13:08.190 --> 01:13:11.450
they're technically not even a fucking NBA team.
When,

1141
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:14.540
when I make the decision to move out here and I move out here,

1142
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:17.870
you don't want the most underhanded deals in the history of sport.

1143
01:13:17.871 --> 01:13:21.260
Kevin Mchale somehow dissolve.
We'll give you our best player for nobody.

1144
01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.710
Give it back to our form of fucking team that I used to play for.

1145
01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.690
And next thing you know where the shit,

1146
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:31.640
and then I got a sale takes at Bhs and I gotta listen to them fucking these

1147
01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:36.050
fucking flags.
They hate it.
Why can't this business being like,
you know,

1148
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:39.770
Oregon,
this is how much I fucking hate.

1149
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.050
Like I'm sitting there watching the game,
right?

1150
01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:46.310
And all of a sudden I see Hillary Swank,
you know,

1151
01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:50.000
court side,
the worst court side,

1152
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:53.390
and all of fucking basketball is the fucking Lakers.

1153
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:58.010
Jesus Christ,
those people with their fucking laminated faces.

1154
01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.620
This is how fucking fucked up people are out here in la.

1155
01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:07.310
They get plastic surgery in their twenties.
It's like you,

1156
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:11.980
you Outta your mind,
you debts.
Take a picture yourself in your 20s.

1157
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:14.800
When you get to your 50s,
then hand him the picture and be like,

1158
01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.940
I want to look like that.
You know,
give them something to work off of.

1159
01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:23.830
Give these guys 30 years to fuck up other people's faces before they get to

1160
01:14:23.831 --> 01:14:24.664
yours.

1161
01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:26.320
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1162
01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.590
<v 6>Jesus Christ,
you know,
stop eating fried food.
Get on a fucking treadmill.</v>

1163
01:14:29.591 --> 01:14:33.820
What's wrong with you?
Right?
I'm telling you for coming,
you know,

1164
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:38.450
game six,
you know,
like I'm going to go,
yeah,
if it,
if,

1165
01:14:38.451 --> 01:14:41.350
if there is a good six,
this is going to be a game six.

1166
01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:46.060
This is going to be a torturous fucking series.
Um,

1167
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.030
I am worried about the Celtics Garnette his heart and Paul Pierce,

1168
01:14:49.031 --> 01:14:50.650
it hurt their fucking,
uh,

1169
01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:55.060
the van Gundy's go their car nuts only gone up with one hand.

1170
01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:00.130
That's all I heard.
We got to use two hands for a rebound.
I hit fucking mute.

1171
01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:03.550
I'm like,
you think he doesn't fucking know that?
And then my buddy Paul verse,

1172
01:15:03.551 --> 01:15:06.700
he calls up,
he goes,
dude,
I think Garnett's heart.
He kept rubbing his shoulder,

1173
01:15:06.701 --> 01:15:08.950
right?
And then all of a sudden my buddy called me today.
He goes,
yeah,

1174
01:15:08.951 --> 01:15:13.620
the saying that on the radio,
he fucked up his shoulder.
See,

1175
01:15:13.621 --> 01:15:18.220
that's why I don't listen.
Put It on fucking mute.
You know,

1176
01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:18.770
I don't know.

1177
01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:23.580
I don't like how just all these fucking people will now act like,

1178
01:15:23.581 --> 01:15:26.880
like the same way the Lakers won the first game,

1179
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:30.810
then all of a sudden other Celtics fucking fished.
Right.

1180
01:15:31.050 --> 01:15:33.870
And now the Celtics won.
Now who the Lakers foot can be good.

1181
01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:38.130
Do they play two games?
It's one,
one.

1182
01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:42.930
It's a great fucking series so far.
Okay.
It's the usual fucking thing.

1183
01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:46.410
They always got to act like whatever just happened.

1184
01:15:46.411 --> 01:15:50.270
His law for the rest of the rest of fucking time.
I can't,
I it,

1185
01:15:50.271 --> 01:15:52.440
it drives me fucking nuts.
But I gotta tell you this dude,

1186
01:15:52.441 --> 01:15:57.150
I owe a IOP Alga Saul and apology.
All right.

1187
01:15:57.151 --> 01:15:59.130
Now I'm not going to be a dick here and be like,
well,
you know,

1188
01:15:59.131 --> 01:16:01.200
Garnette is in fucking 100% whatever.

1189
01:16:01.201 --> 01:16:03.330
That guy's going strong to the fucking hoop.

1190
01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.070
He is not the guy he was a two fucking years ago.

1191
01:16:08.071 --> 01:16:09.570
That guy playing fucking great.

1192
01:16:09.571 --> 01:16:14.571
That fucking baseline reverse jam he had was the shit was the shit.

1193
01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:16.831
You see this,

1194
01:16:16.831 --> 01:16:21.831
this is a Celtics fan given pau Gasol props in the middle of the fucking series.

1195
01:16:21.991 --> 01:16:26.991
And I wish more you fucking sport cunts could act like that instead of fucking,

1196
01:16:27.841 --> 01:16:28.141
you know,

1197
01:16:28.141 --> 01:16:32.700
latch and you're hitching up the trailer of your loser life up to your fucking

1198
01:16:32.701 --> 01:16:36.180
team to the point.
So you get so into it that you can't even,

1199
01:16:36.181 --> 01:16:39.450
you can't even appreciate it.
A fucking good play.
You know,

1200
01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:46.210
he's fucking red sox fans who fucked Derek Jeter.
Really,
really

1201
01:16:47.710 --> 01:16:50.410
fucking stupid.
You know,
guys,
the Shit fucking,

1202
01:16:50.411 --> 01:16:53.770
you know of the best players I've ever fucking seen.
You know,

1203
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:57.300
the way he handles his shit on and off,
you know,
do I want the guy that went,

1204
01:16:57.301 --> 01:17:00.460
fuck no,
but am I going to sit here like an asshole,
you know,

1205
01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:04.540
and act like this dude isn't a great player or that fucking reverse jam.

1206
01:17:04.541 --> 01:17:07.650
Pau Gasol head was the shit.
I want to know how Pollock is.

1207
01:17:07.651 --> 01:17:10.220
Saul became a Laker.

1208
01:17:11.650 --> 01:17:14.650
He's a fucked up looking white dude.
If that doesn't say Celtic,

1209
01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:15.670
I don't know what does.

1210
01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:23.410
And this is really like the classic Celtics Lakers series where they've always

1211
01:17:23.411 --> 01:17:26.830
been just,
you know,
faster,

1212
01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:30.210
always had more talent and we've always just been,
you know,
like this,

1213
01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:33.490
this fucking,
you know,

1214
01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:37.090
fucking fucked up look and team.
But somehow we win.

1215
01:17:40.290 --> 01:17:45.130
How many good looking Celtics have there,
Ben?
I mean this

1216
01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:52.800
Larry Bird,
Dennis Johnson,
Kevin Mchale,

1217
01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:57.540
Kevin Mchale I guess had dreamy eyes if you're just focused on that,

1218
01:17:57.541 --> 01:17:59.610
but the rest of his body,
good Lord.

1219
01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:05.000
He looks like his fucking arms are so God damn long.

1220
01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:08.330
He looks like he would walk like that thing in the and,
and uh,

1221
01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:12.170
what was that movie with the CIC crawled up out of the,
well,
was that the movie?

1222
01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:16.850
Oh is it that other movie that the,
the uh,
oh Jesus Christ.

1223
01:18:16.851 --> 01:18:19.820
One of those Japanese horror movies with that fucking thing crawls.

1224
01:18:19.821 --> 01:18:23.720
And as it moves its hands,
its back legs would step over its front fucking legs,

1225
01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:26.330
like some sort of mute and crab.

1226
01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:32.280
I Dunno,
I don't fucking know.
Kendrick Perkins.

1227
01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:37.490
I saw Kendrick Perkins,
by the way,
a lobby of this hotel about a week ago.

1228
01:18:37.491 --> 01:18:41.420
That guy is a fucking mountain of a man.

1229
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:45.320
He's a fucking mountain,
you know,

1230
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:48.800
and to think that he looks like medium size next to Shaq,

1231
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:50.780
these fucking people that ate.
Oh,

1232
01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:54.080
if you ever get down on yourself that you never made,

1233
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:58.010
you never made it to the professional ever stand next to a professional athlete

1234
01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:03.250
and just realize that it was game over by third grade when there's people

1235
01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:07.430
walking around with that sort of fucking bionic DNA.

1236
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:11.540
Jesus Christ.
I can't believe I was allowed to go to gym class.

1237
01:19:11.541 --> 01:19:13.160
Pass the fucking sixth grade,

1238
01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:20.690
my pasty fucking Forrest Gump legs.
Um,
anyways,

1239
01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.410
so let's get back to this shit man.
Why of why,
you know,
maybe,

1240
01:19:25.411 --> 01:19:28.400
maybe you guys can just answer me that.
Why the fuck do we care so much?

1241
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:28.971
Like right now,

1242
01:19:28.971 --> 01:19:33.971
you know who's getting their God damn fucking heart's ripped out and our aging

1243
01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:38.140
of the fans of the Black Hawks in the flyers.
All right.
This,

1244
01:19:38.141 --> 01:19:42.770
this is one of these great series where somebody is finally going to have that

1245
01:19:42.771 --> 01:19:45.140
Advil lifted off their chest.

1246
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:49.460
Blackhawks have a 1 cents 61 the flyers have a 1 cents 75.

1247
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:54.440
Okay?
75 isn't as bad as 61.
But you know what the fuck?

1248
01:19:55.490 --> 01:20:00.110
You know,
I was writing on my Facebook page.
We pulled out of Vietnam in 1975.

1249
01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:06.150
All right?
There was only one kind of cheerios in 1975.

1250
01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:07.980
You understand?
I've got a deadline.
Am I putting

1251
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.980
<v 5>this in historical perspective here and can I dumb it down to the Rubik's cube</v>

1252
01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:18.690
was still about six,
seven years away.
People the last time the flyers want it.

1253
01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:23.910
Okay,
lovely.
You just got gotta fucking dumb everything down.

1254
01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:28.260
Um,

1258
01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:40.620
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1260
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:46.920
I want to take this podcast and next level is what I do is I do the podcast
then.

1261
01:20:46.921 --> 01:20:48.810
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
You know,

1262
01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:52.240
I upload it and I sent it to the dude who runs that page and he puts all the

1263
01:20:52.241 --> 01:20:55.630
fucking,
you know,
all the references up,
all the youtube videos and everything.

1264
01:20:55.631 --> 01:21:00.280
Then we try to sync it where we,
we both fucking put it on at the same time,

1265
01:21:00.281 --> 01:21:02.320
you know,
taking it to the next level.

1266
01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:04.180
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1267
01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:08.830
<v 5>Totally lost.
Just lost my fucking train of thought here.
Um,
oh,
that's right.</v>

1268
01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.140
He sent me this article.
This is the classic,

1269
01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:16.820
just dumb and down just pussy way that we're running this country right now.

1270
01:21:16.821 --> 01:21:19.970
These stairs,
p people actually,
I guess the,
uh,
the nationwide,
uh,

1271
01:21:19.971 --> 01:21:24.470
the national spelling bee is coming up,
you know,
and everybody laughs at these,

1272
01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:27.620
these kids who go up there,
they're right at their fucking awkward years,

1273
01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:28.551
you know what I mean,

1274
01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:31.580
where they have the nose of the adult and like the fucking teeth of a fucking

1275
01:21:31.581 --> 01:21:36.020
two year old,
you know,
12 year old.
So,
um,

1276
01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:40.720
they have haven't the national spelling bee and Washington DC,

1277
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:42.550
they celebrate these,
uh,

1278
01:21:42.551 --> 01:21:46.600
these brainiac fucking kids that eventually will work for a corporation.

1279
01:21:46.601 --> 01:21:49.870
And without really knowing it will probably work on some device that'll Sunday

1280
01:21:49.871 --> 01:21:53.710
kill millions of people,
you know,
in other words,
the future.

1281
01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:59.260
So there's people actually they're picketing,

1282
01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.710
dispelling B.
All right.
I had to,

1283
01:22:02.711 --> 01:22:06.670
I had to fucking read this to actually believe it.
Okay.
It says,

1284
01:22:06.671 --> 01:22:10.520
not all s spellers headed for Washington DC for the National Spelling Bee,

1285
01:22:10.570 --> 01:22:14.980
spelling bee on June 1st through the third think English spelling is a good

1286
01:22:14.981 --> 01:22:19.981
thing that should be celebrated with spectators and judges inside the Grand

1287
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:22.410
Hyatt Hotel,
uh,

1288
01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:25.660
awhile while spectators and judges inside the Grand Hyatt Hotel will be

1289
01:22:25.661 --> 01:22:30.460
pondering the spellings of obscure words and admiring the efforts of contestants

1290
01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:31.790
outside on the street.

1291
01:22:31.791 --> 01:22:36.490
Some members of the American Literacy Council and the Simplified Spelling

1292
01:22:36.491 --> 01:22:37.324
Society,

1293
01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:43.140
Aka the s s s we'll be trying to convince Passerbuys that the English spelling

1294
01:22:45.041 --> 01:22:47.050
is a problem that needs fixing.

1295
01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:49.530
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1296
01:22:49.530 --> 01:22:52.170
<v 5>Why are people so fucking dumb?
Okay.
And now that's something.</v>

1297
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:56.310
If you want to get support,
simplified spelling society,

1298
01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:59.220
you don't go to the fucking nationwide spelling bee where the,

1299
01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:00.660
the kids just learned,

1300
01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:02.180
<v 3>okay,</v>

1301
01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:04.370
<v 5>how to spell fucking rheumatoid arthritis.</v>

1302
01:23:04.371 --> 01:23:07.370
So whenever the fuck they're going to ask him,
can you use an authentic,

1303
01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:12.850
your grandmother has rheumatoid arthritis.
Okay.
That was mean.

1304
01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:16.330
Ah,
rheumatoid arthritis.
Isn't that two words?
Um,

1305
01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:18.630
why won't you just go to a bar?

1306
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.870
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1307
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:23.560
<v 5>You want to get names on that fucking petition.
That's who you're doing it for.</v>

1308
01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:25.450
The dumb fucks.

1309
01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:29.980
This is the point these people have it said like those insides side,

1310
01:23:29.981 --> 01:23:31.870
they may admire the efforts of the contestants,

1311
01:23:31.871 --> 01:23:36.760
but they will have signs and sandwich boards with slogans such as I'm through

1312
01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:37.720
with,
through.

1313
01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:39.330
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1314
01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:43.200
<v 5>In other words,
t,
H,
r,U ,
and t.
H.
R.
O.
U.
G.
H.
I'm through with,</v>

1315
01:23:43.201 --> 01:23:47.970
through and enough is enough spelled e.
N.
U.
F.
E.
N.
U.
F,

1316
01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:51.750
and enough is too much spelled e.
N.
O.
U.
G.
H.

1317
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:56.070
Their aim is to alert parents,
educators,
politicians,

1318
01:23:56.071 --> 01:24:00.600
business people and others concerned about the unacceptable level of illiteracy,

1319
01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:05.630
illiteracy among English speakers to the fact that a prime cause for this is

1320
01:24:06.451 --> 01:24:09.390
English spelling.
Do you get it?

1321
01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:15.500
The reason why there's such a high level of illiteracy is not because we

1322
01:24:16.321 --> 01:24:19.410
constantly cut funding to the public schools,

1323
01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:25.220
not because spelling is something that's even fucking stressed by most people

1324
01:24:25.261 --> 01:24:29.280
anymore.
It's because the words are too difficult to spell.

1325
01:24:30.210 --> 01:24:32.880
One of the pickers pickers,
one of the picketers.

1326
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:35.340
This is hilarious and I can't even fucking read.
I'm part of the problem.

1327
01:24:35.341 --> 01:24:37.890
I might sign these people's petition.
Um,

1328
01:24:37.891 --> 01:24:41.610
one of the picketers at the ALC chair and the SSS member,

1329
01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:45.390
Allen Mole from Boulder,
Colorado,
put it this way,

1330
01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:51.560
are odd spelling retains words like cough bowl through and though this increases

1331
01:24:53.641 --> 01:24:58.641
illiteracy and crime fix it and you fix a host of problems,

1332
01:24:59.730 --> 01:25:02.520
we want to fix it to this guy is basically saying

1333
01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:06.180
<v 6>that the reason why there's serial killers,</v>

1334
01:25:06.181 --> 01:25:10.980
there's people holding up fucking Mcdonald's,
there's purse snatchers,

1335
01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:12.560
<v 3>okay.</v>

1336
01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:17.560
<v 6>And all this type of shit is because cat is not spelled with a k,</v>

1337
01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:22.870
you know,
I mean on once side.

1338
01:25:22.871 --> 01:25:26.170
I fucking respect this guy because he's actually has a cause.

1339
01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.410
He actually got off his couch and said,
you know what?

1340
01:25:29.411 --> 01:25:33.400
I'm going to do something about this.
This is the reverse of what I was trying.

1341
01:25:33.401 --> 01:25:37.750
Maybe that's why.
Let's get smart America bombed on my podcast.

1342
01:25:38.770 --> 01:25:42.160
You know,
you guys,
we'll wait for this sss guy to come in here.
You know,

1343
01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:46.840
I mean not,
not to be the classic person who goes,
what's going to happen next,

1344
01:25:47.050 --> 01:25:51.700
but what is going to happen next?
Two plus two was like four or five,
three,

1345
01:25:51.701 --> 01:25:54.010
you know,
as long as you within one,
we'll give it to you.

1346
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:57.860
Rounded off to the nearest right answer.

1347
01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:02.750
Learn how to fucking spell your lazy fucks as pathetic.

1348
01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:07.640
And I also like how to like the illiteracy illiteracy problem is,
you know,

1349
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:10.600
that's the reason why this fucking crime,
you know,
law.

1350
01:26:10.630 --> 01:26:12.920
I bet those fucking bankers,
you know,

1351
01:26:12.921 --> 01:26:15.860
those bankers are literate and they're great at math.

1352
01:26:16.230 --> 01:26:18.710
They're great at fucking math where it always works out for them.

1353
01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:22.220
The fucking cunts.
They went till fucking Ivy League schools.

1354
01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:27.100
Why did I,
why did I take her off?
I believe schools,

1355
01:26:28.090 --> 01:26:32.050
Ivy League schools,
they went to Ivy League fucking schools and went to Brown.

1356
01:26:32.170 --> 01:26:35.770
They went to Cornell.
Wentworth.

1357
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.840
I Dunno,
that's one for you that,
that did some party fucking,
uh,

1358
01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.380
you know,
something that's,
you know what killed it?

1359
01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:48.700
What killed it was a was cable.
That's what,

1360
01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:53.830
that's what,
that's what really made people dump cable and the Internet.

1361
01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:57.940
800 fucking channels.
You know,
people used to,
back in the day,

1362
01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:02.770
they used to load up a something called a station wagon.
All right.
First of all,

1363
01:27:02.771 --> 01:27:06.160
everybody had like five fucking kids back in the day.
All right.

1364
01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:08.860
Which was a great thing to do.
You know,

1365
01:27:09.010 --> 01:27:12.250
cause you know a couple of them are going to be fuck ups.
Okay.

1366
01:27:12.251 --> 01:27:14.650
And you can let it go.
You can let it go.

1367
01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:18.370
That's why parents who have only one kid is so fucking over protective,

1368
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:22.840
but peck protective is because they went all in world series of poker.

1369
01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:25.510
They pushed all the chips and this is their one fucking hope.

1370
01:27:25.511 --> 01:27:29.890
That kid can't be a fucking serial killer.
You have seven,
eight fucking kids.

1371
01:27:29.891 --> 01:27:34.500
You know one of them,
you know
you can handle it.

1372
01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:39.840
You can fucking handle it.
If one of them's a phase,
the black sheep,

1373
01:27:39.841 --> 01:27:44.000
what are you going to do?
You know,
what the fuck are you going to do?

1374
01:27:44.001 --> 01:27:45.560
I mean the guy,
he's a

1375
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.750
transvestite and sometimes pyromaniac.
Huh?

1376
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:52.760
Anybody remember that line there?

1377
01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:58.210
He met a transvestite and sometimes pyromaniac the greatest line ever uttered on

1378
01:27:58.701 --> 01:28:00.050
the fucking a and e channel,

1379
01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:04.250
possibly in television history when they were talking about these ds,
this,

1380
01:28:04.251 --> 01:28:08.540
this serial killer tandem.
That's how they described one of the guys.

1381
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:12.440
One of the guys was just killing somebody on his own and then he had to leave

1382
01:28:12.441 --> 01:28:13.274
town

1383
01:28:14.150 --> 01:28:16.460
<v 5>because the heat was getting too high and he went to a new town,</v>

1384
01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:20.000
hangs out in some shady bar,
and that's where he meets his,
his,
his,

1385
01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:22.720
his serial killer partner.
You know,

1386
01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:24.860
Kinda like what Bill Gates met that other fucking nerd.

1387
01:28:24.861 --> 01:28:28.280
And they made the first laptop.
These two serial killers came together

1388
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:34.220
and to describe his partner that the fucking,
that Bill Curtis guy goes there.

1389
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:37.490
He met a transvestite and sometimes pyromaniac

1390
01:28:39.810 --> 01:28:44.400
<v 6>back in the day people we had station wagons and there was a whole bunch of</v>

1391
01:28:44.401 --> 01:28:48.510
fucking kid.
He didn't have to have a fucking spelling bee.
Okay,

1392
01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:52.890
you have a spelling bee because you only have one kid and the kid can't compete

1393
01:28:52.891 --> 01:28:55.620
against himself.
You've got to go with a bunch of other fucking kids.

1394
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:59.700
Back in the day we had station wagons and they were full of fucking kids.

1395
01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:02.430
All right.
And you just,

1396
01:29:02.431 --> 01:29:06.300
you drove somewhere and on the way there,
you know,

1397
01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.470
you listen to Mitch Miller.
Okay.

1398
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:13.940
<v 13>Bullies [inaudible] room,</v>

1399
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:18.360
<v 6>right?
And you fucking,
you said Shit like,
um,</v>

1400
01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:20.910
do you get your,
your parents would quiz you.

1401
01:29:20.911 --> 01:29:24.870
What are Ivy League schools named the capitols of states,

1402
01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:29.520
you know,
that's what the fuck you did.
And you stopped at a rest area.

1403
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:34.530
Your Dad sent you in there by yourself.
There was no problem,

1404
01:29:34.531 --> 01:29:35.610
there was no worries.

1405
01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:42.100
And you walked in there and some guy exposes himself to you it or not a deal

1406
01:29:43.501 --> 01:29:45.960
with it.
It just buried it.

1407
01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:50.010
You got back in the fucking car and next thing you know you're at a dairy queen,

1408
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:53.310
sort of enjoying the ice cream,
but sorta not.

1409
01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:02.220
That's when America was intelligent back when we used to have like five,

1410
01:30:02.221 --> 01:30:06.470
six kids and you throw him in a fucking station wagon and then you quizzed him

1411
01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:12.360
and as you drove to some poor excuse for a tourist attraction,

1412
01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:12.991
you know,

1413
01:30:12.991 --> 01:30:17.991
you go out to go look at fucking while build Cody's fucking log cabin.

1414
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:24.080
You know,
your dad be sitting there seething with anger,

1415
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:30.290
left arm,
all sunburned from having it hanging out the side fucking window.

1416
01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:35.820
The rest of them ghost white.
Now,

1417
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:39.520
was it spelling tests,
quizzes and dairy queen.

1418
01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:45.240
Somewhere along the line it became OMG laughing my fucking ass off all this

1419
01:30:45.911 --> 01:30:49.900
abbreviation.
These people want to turn it into that.
Fuck that man up.

1420
01:30:49.930 --> 01:30:52.750
You pussies learn how to spell God damn words.

1421
01:30:54.250 --> 01:30:57.970
I did it for a month.
I'm a better speller because it because of it.

1422
01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:01.540
Because it I'm not,
I've already forgot.

1423
01:31:02.650 --> 01:31:04.930
I finally conquered the word restaurant though forever.

1424
01:31:04.931 --> 01:31:08.680
I couldn't remember whether you went.
It's rest.

1425
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:13.870
And then a U.
R a.
N.
T.
I could never remember if the you came,
which,
which a,
the,

1426
01:31:13.871 --> 01:31:17.830
you came after.
Is it restaurant or restaurant?

1427
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:23.710
Gretar aunt.
It's a restaurant.
These fucking people would spell it.

1428
01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:28.100
R.
E.
S.
T.
R.

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:36.060
<v 6>You know that's restaurant.
How do I spell that?
Phonetically?</v>

1432
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:43.170
R.
E.
S.
T.
O.
N.

Okay.

1433
01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:47.750

T.
R.
O.
N.
T.
Restaurant.

1434
01:31:48.850 --> 01:31:50.870
Let's go to the fucking restaurant.

1435
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:56.600
I look,
I'm getting so worked up like these guys are actually going to succeed.

1436
01:31:58.100 --> 01:31:58.933
Um,
you know,

1437
01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.470
it's like listen to the people down the south when they talk about the south

1438
01:32:02.471 --> 01:32:05.440
Gilda rise again.
Is it,

1439
01:32:06.190 --> 01:32:09.610
are you going to secede from the union?
How did that work up the first time?

1440
01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:14.020
Um,
wow.
Look at me.
What is wrong with me?
All right,

1441
01:32:14.021 --> 01:32:18.610
let's get to some youtube videos for the fucking week.
Um,
for the fucking week.

1442
01:32:18.611 --> 01:32:23.320
Listen to me with my tough talk.
Um,
all right,
hang on a second.

1443
01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:28.000
I've got a couple actually really good a drum videos for you guys to watch.

1444
01:32:28.001 --> 01:32:30.580
They're actually hilarious.
Somebody sent me this on my uh,

1445
01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:35.910
on my Facebook and the name of this video is this drummer search.

1446
01:32:36.491 --> 01:32:38.800
This,
this drummer is at the wrong gig.

1447
01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:40.400
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1448
01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:45.070
<v 6>And it's just a guy where he is fucking,</v>

1449
01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:46.780
this guy is awesome.

1450
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:52.830
He is performing like it's still 1986 and they are opening for like fucking

1451
01:32:54.851 --> 01:32:58.750
motley crew and he is trying to blow Tommy Lee off the stage.

1452
01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:01.360
That's the way he is performing.
And they are,

1453
01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:06.340
they're playing at like just some fucking banquet and everybody else has,

1454
01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:10.780
I'm playing at a banquet energy and this motherfucker is just like,
I don't know.

1455
01:33:10.810 --> 01:33:15.610
I've played drums for fucking years and I would have to slow the video down to

1456
01:33:15.611 --> 01:33:19.450
try and figure out how the fuck he's doing some of this shit.

1457
01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:21.680
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1458
01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:25.250
<v 6>He does this move with his both his arms.
He looks like he's in a dryer.</v>

1459
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:30.620
It's the only way to describe it is fucking code is flying around is somehow he

1460
01:33:30.621 --> 01:33:32.990
never misses a beat.
It's fucking awesome.

1461
01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:37.370
But it looks absolutely ridiculous yet.
Awesome.
Yeah,
just check it out.

1462
01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:41.390
All right.
And you can watch all these videos if you don't want to search.
Okay.

1463
01:33:41.391 --> 01:33:44.930
I'll make it easy for you.
Just like the SSS people go to the,
uh,

1464
01:33:45.230 --> 01:33:48.860
the man podcast.com and uh,

1465
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:52.130
we'll have all that shit update for you.
Here's another one.

1466
01:33:52.131 --> 01:33:56.870
Korean drummer rocks out.
This is actually from a long time ago,

1467
01:33:56.871 --> 01:34:00.720
but this guy is just fucking,
you know,
it's just what,

1468
01:34:00.721 --> 01:34:04.670
what drumming and performing is all about this guy.
He's the shit.

1469
01:34:04.970 --> 01:34:07.490
A lot of times people,
I'm the drummer I'm sitting by and all these drums,

1470
01:34:07.491 --> 01:34:10.190
no one's going to look at me,
this fucking guy,
you can't not look at them.

1471
01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:14.270
And they got this hot girl sing in the song,
you know,

1472
01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:18.170
and he's fucking,
he's starts headbanging and these,
I think this,

1473
01:34:18.171 --> 01:34:22.280
this guy's like headbanging before people knew how to head bang,
um,

1474
01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:24.920
in is the last thing.
Uh,

1475
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:28.370
you can go on youtube and na checkout because I tried to download this album.

1476
01:34:28.371 --> 01:34:29.960
It's the first Arrow Smith album,

1477
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:33.230
which I haven't listened to I think in about 15 years.

1478
01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:35.930
It's such a great album.

1479
01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:40.960
It's the one that dream on was initially on that's only like the really the real

1480
01:34:41.331 --> 01:34:44.090
head off it.
And they usually play like mama kin and stuff in concert,

1481
01:34:44.091 --> 01:34:46.040
but they're,
it,
they're,
they're so fucking,

1482
01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:49.290
the album is so like raw and Steven Tyler's voice,

1483
01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:51.440
he sounds so young and he's just,

1484
01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:55.980
he's right at the beginning of like a few of like his signature ways of like

1485
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:58.910
phrasing and stuff.
And uh,

1486
01:34:59.690 --> 01:35:01.250
it's just a fucking killer album.

1487
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:06.140
And my favorite song on it is a song called moving out by Aerosmith and,

1488
01:35:06.141 --> 01:35:10.580
uh,
it's great.
They'll just,
the production of it and everything,

1489
01:35:10.581 --> 01:35:11.960
it's just so fucking like,

1490
01:35:11.961 --> 01:35:15.860
it just sounded like they scrape their last couple of fucking dimes together and

1491
01:35:15.861 --> 01:35:20.060
put it out.
Um,
and I'm actually going to go to a fucking,

1492
01:35:20.061 --> 01:35:21.530
I'm going to go to Amoeba records today.

1493
01:35:21.531 --> 01:35:23.570
I'm going to fucking buy that album because,
uh,

1494
01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:27.410
I tried to download it on iTunes and they don't have it.
Isn't that a surprise?

1495
01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:32.320
Isn't that a fucking surprise?
Um,
I don't know who to blame on that one.

1496
01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:35.650
Is it Aerosmith?
Cause they're like,
well,
I don't like the production of that.

1497
01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:37.570
Or we have,
you know,
our two hits,

1498
01:35:37.571 --> 01:35:41.740
I was on like 47 different ever other compilations.
I don't know what,
but I'm,

1499
01:35:41.770 --> 01:35:44.590
I'm,
I'm right now,
I'm gonna put some money in those fuckers pockets,

1500
01:35:44.770 --> 01:35:49.200
download that whole album,
go out and buy.
It's the shit.
They'd just a shit.

1501
01:35:50.250 --> 01:35:51.620
All right,
so where are we at here?

1502
01:35:51.621 --> 01:35:56.621
42 minutes in almost 43 minutes and I got to cover another fucking seven

1503
01:35:56.841 --> 01:35:59.480
minutes.
And then I can fucking

1504
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:04.730
can upload this fucking thing and get on with my God damn day here.
Uh Oh.

1505
01:36:04.731 --> 01:36:05.091
By the way,

1506
01:36:05.091 --> 01:36:10.091
I'm going to be a Caroline's comedy club this week with a Paul Versey opening up

1507
01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:13.490
and in the middle,
young Joe to Rosa,

1508
01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:17.630
the teen idol sensation from the opiate Anthony show.

1509
01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:19.590
I know a lot of you out there read teen beat,

1510
01:36:19.591 --> 01:36:23.570
so you're all up on Joe and his latest hairstyle,
but a,

1511
01:36:23.571 --> 01:36:26.060
for those of you not familiar with Joe,
he has,

1512
01:36:26.061 --> 01:36:30.520
he has a wonderful spread coming out in a next next month,
uh,

1513
01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:33.680

uh,
you know,

1514
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:38.990

you know,
shirtless laying in a field,
very,
uh,

1515
01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:43.370
very Keith Partridge,
Shaun Cassidy,
sort of a photo shoot.
You know,

1516
01:36:43.371 --> 01:36:47.360
it's done a little bit ironic,
but a,
you know,
there's a lot of heart in it.

1517
01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:52.630
Um,
anyways,
yeah,
I'm going to be there.

1518
01:36:52.631 --> 01:36:56.980
Uh,

Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday,
uh,
Thursday.

1519
01:36:57.010 --> 01:37:00.190
June 10th is my birthday by the way.

1520
01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:05.350
Okay,
so,
and I'm going to spend it on the road,

1521
01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:09.910
like some lonely sailor.
No,

1522
01:37:09.911 --> 01:37:12.980
actually I don't even know why I took the Gig on my birthday.
Ana.

1523
01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:17.530
Why did cause I owned it tax man.
Yay.
The tax man.

1524
01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:19.880
I don't know how you get rich and,

1525
01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:22.700
and I know why people fucking steal from people because that's the only way to

1526
01:37:22.701 --> 01:37:25.000
get over the hump.
Every time I think I'm going to get over the hump him.

1527
01:37:25.001 --> 01:37:28.850
I'm like my on fucking easy street.
The fucking Goddamn IRS shows up.

1528
01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:32.870
You know it gives me the fucking right there.
Fred,
the right there.

1529
01:37:32.871 --> 01:37:37.460
Fred to my fucking nuts right there.
Fred.
I just made my dog jumps.

1530
01:37:37.461 --> 01:37:40.430
Sorry about that dude.
Sorry.
Right there Fred.

1531
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:44.860
That was actually a catchphrase in my family right there,
Fred and what that was.

1532
01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:46.870
That was actually from a Flintstones episode,

1533
01:37:47.710 --> 01:37:51.550
Flintstones episode where Fred was trying to fucking do a,

1534
01:37:52.330 --> 01:37:53.200
you guys haven't had that yet.

1535
01:37:53.201 --> 01:37:56.910
They just have a fucking like catchphrase and only your family gets,
you know,

1536
01:37:56.911 --> 01:37:59.640
maybe you guys could send me into those.
Oh,
that'll,
I'll tell you one of ours,

1537
01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:03.570
one of ours in our family was called right there,
Fred.
Yeah.

1538
01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:06.420
Everything was going great than the dude gives me the fucking right there,
Fred.

1539
01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:11.220
And it was from the Flintstones and Fred,
I don't know what he's doing.

1540
01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:14.790
He was trying to impress Wilmoth that he learned how to do magic and he,

1541
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:18.230
and he has this egg and egg does Lino,
a couple little dupes.

1542
01:38:18.230 --> 01:38:22.290
He dues and he's like,

well my,

You know,

1543
01:38:22.291 --> 01:38:24.960
he has it like buried in his fist and she goes right there,

1544
01:38:24.961 --> 01:38:26.870
Fred and she fucking pounded.

1545
01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:32.670
She pounded his fist and broke the egg and his hand and exposed him.
You know,

1546
01:38:32.671 --> 01:38:37.110
he thought he was the shit and she made an absolute fool out of him and the

1547
01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:39.750
proverbial yolk on your face,
but it was in his hand.

1548
01:38:39.751 --> 01:38:42.990
So that became that pecan enough that became the right there.

1549
01:38:42.991 --> 01:38:47.250
Fred and my family.
Anytime like,
you know,
you think you went in an argument,

1550
01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:48.293
you think?
Yeah.

1551
01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:51.690
Is there anything funnier than watching a big dog walk across hardwood floors?

1552
01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.110
I swear to God.
You think they're going across a minefield?
Cleo?

1553
01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:56.933
What's wrong with you?

1554
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:59.383
<v 3>Huh?</v>

1555
01:39:00.710 --> 01:39:02.750
<v 6>You don't like walking across it.
What happened to you?</v>

1556
01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:07.430
Did you have a bad experience?
I'll have to say.

1557
01:39:07.431 --> 01:39:09.800
I don't even have to say like the entire,
you want to go outside?

1558
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:13.910
I'll have to say as you want to inner ears come up,
Cleo,
you want to,

1559
01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:16.133
<v 3>okay.</v>

1560
01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:20.970
<v 5>You want to go inside?
I'll see if I can get,
get her to how Cleo?</v>

1561
01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:30.430
<v 3>No,
no,
no.
Damn Cleo.
You want to go say</v>

1562
01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:35.280
fuck she doing a little death,
Cleo,

1563
01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:39.113
you won't go inside.

1564
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:45.080
<v 14>Oh,</v>

1565
01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:50.050
<v 6>oh,
fucking awesome.
Is that if you guys don't have dogs,</v>

1566
01:39:50.051 --> 01:39:53.140
I don't know why you don't have a dog and get a breed that fucking house.

1567
01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:57.320
I make it do that every time.
That was actually just
ah,

1568
01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:02.230
it's just fucking awesome.
Um,
anyways,
let's,
let's plow ahead.

1569
01:40:02.231 --> 01:40:03.770
What the hell was it?
I was talking about catchphrases,

1570
01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:05.290
but I was going to tell you something else.

1571
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:08.660
<v 5>I Dunno.
I was speaking to my dog.</v>

1572
01:40:08.661 --> 01:40:11.910
You know what the F my fucking landlord found out I had a dog.

1573
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:15.740
Neither my landlord is listening to this podcast or the,

1574
01:40:15.741 --> 01:40:19.670
or the old fuck downstairs ratted me out.
I don't know what,

1575
01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:21.890
but I let it go.
I let it go

1576
01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:23.850
<v 6>cause you know,
make,
I have my coats,
I have my,</v>

1577
01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:27.700
I don't name names and I don't yell at old people.
All right?

1578
01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:32.610
I may talk shit about him on my podcast.
Hey,

1579
01:40:32.611 --> 01:40:34.590
remember that crazy lady,
that lady,

1580
01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:37.230
that crazy lady that I was telling you about my neighborhood.
Uh,

1581
01:40:37.231 --> 01:40:42.231
I was driving down the street the other day and I just saw her fucking laying on

1582
01:40:42.271 --> 01:40:45.750
the grass
screaming,

1583
01:40:45.751 --> 01:40:48.720
just fighting off like invisible.
I don't know what

1584
01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:49.990
<v 3>okay.</v>

1585
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:53.050
<v 5>And uh,
I</v>

1586
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:54.311
<v 6>like,</v>

1587
01:40:54.311 --> 01:40:59.311
I haven't left and I don't know how long it was so fucking funny.

1588
01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:03.700
I mean,
I feel bad for her and shit,
but like,
uh,

1589
01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:09.070
are you gonna stand like the street I live on is a quiet street and I'm driving

1590
01:41:09.970 --> 01:41:12.250
down this quiet street in my hybrid,

1591
01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:16.210
which is actually even choir,
my hybrid,

1592
01:41:16.211 --> 01:41:21.211
the fucking Bose headphones of automobiles and it's just quiet.

1593
01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:25.810
You know,
I got the windows down.
It's the perfect day.
You don't need a c,

1594
01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:30.100
you don't need the windows up.
It's just why you live in California.

1595
01:41:30.101 --> 01:41:33.880
It's this fucking awesome day and you know,

1596
01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:38.770
fucking blue skies,
just,
just a beautiful day.
I'm just cruising down the street,

1597
01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:42.880
could just got a bunch of shit done.
I'm feeling good.
And all of a sudden I just,

1598
01:41:42.881 --> 01:41:44.950
I just,
you know,
as I'm coming up on her,

1599
01:41:45.010 --> 01:41:47.410
I can't see her because this car's parked in the side of the road.

1600
01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:49.520
I just say this saw this faint,
like,

1601
01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:54.913
<v 15>okay,</v>

1602
01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:58.920
<v 6>and I'm like you.
And it was so fucking bizarre.
I was like,
what the fuck is that?</v>

1603
01:41:58.921 --> 01:42:03.921
And then I just cut the ends up being like this just for car gap between cars

1604
01:42:05.461 --> 01:42:07.920
parked on the side of the road and I can't see this big SUV.

1605
01:42:08.190 --> 01:42:09.750
And right when I come around the side of it,

1606
01:42:09.751 --> 01:42:14.751
there's this crazy lady on her back like a fucking cockroach that can't get up

1607
01:42:15.521 --> 01:42:19.850
do you think?
Just flailing in slow motion.

1608
01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:22.610
I love Fred Sanford each limb one at a time.

1609
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:25.280
And it was just so fucking bizarre,

1610
01:42:25.281 --> 01:42:28.730
but she was so committed and she was so into it.

1611
01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:35.060
And so just fighting something off.
It was,
it was just,

1612
01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:38.330
it was fucked.
Like,
it was so peaceful,
so beautiful.
What a day.

1613
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:43.570
And all of a sudden I fucking drove by and I just started fucking laughing and

1614
01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:51.690
it was like,
it was just a guilt free left.
That was a guilt free left.
You know,

1615
01:42:52.650 --> 01:42:55.920
I didn't feel bad.
I feel bad that she's out there,
but like,

1616
01:42:56.220 --> 01:43:01.080
I like to think that I'm mature enough to know that either way.
The,
that's funny.

1617
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:05.940
Right?
Am I a bad person?
I probably am.

1618
01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.540
I don't know.
Well that's the podcast for this week.
Everybody.

1619
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:12.560
I didn't get back to the way that I didn't get back to the flyers.
Uh,

1620
01:43:13.410 --> 01:43:16.050
I didn't get back to,
you know,
I'm going to talk right until my phone call comes.

1621
01:43:16.051 --> 01:43:20.110
I got a phone call here at 11,
which is in four minutes.
Um,

1622
01:43:21.010 --> 01:43:26.010
what was I gonna say?
I fucking,
uh,
getting back to the flyers and the,

1623
01:43:26.011 --> 01:43:28.210
uh,
the Blackhawks.
Okay.

1624
01:43:28.211 --> 01:43:30.520
It's a great series you guys really should watch right now.

1625
01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:34.990
Black Hawks just went up three,
two.
They are,
they are one game away.

1626
01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:38.370
Slick sleeve.
Willits law.
You know,
they always do that.
Yeah.

1627
01:43:38.410 --> 01:43:42.910
Quarter to eight minutes away from handling the curse,
um,

1628
01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:47.870
from ending basically 50 years of frustration for these people.

1629
01:43:49.130 --> 01:43:53.560
Okay.
And you know,
to the fact that they have like,
you know,

1630
01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:54.890
some of the original players,

1631
01:43:54.891 --> 01:43:57.800
they have like five people left from their fucking team that aren't even dead

1632
01:43:57.801 --> 01:44:01.060
yet from the last time that they played.
MMM.

1633
01:44:02.210 --> 01:44:03.620
I'll tell you what's Austin's Bobby Hill.

1634
01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.680
Bobby Hall still looks like I can't figure out if he looks like,

1635
01:44:06.681 --> 01:44:09.220
if he'd still beat the shit out of you.
It looks like the calm.

1636
01:44:09.230 --> 01:44:13.130
He's in that weird aging process where he still looks like he could beat the

1637
01:44:13.131 --> 01:44:16.700
shit out of you yet.
He also looks like he signed the declaration,

1638
01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:18.290
the declaration of independence,

1639
01:44:18.291 --> 01:44:22.870
which would have been hilarious if I didn't fucking stutter.
Goddammit.
I'm dumb.

1640
01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:26.070
Um,
so I gotta be honest with you.

1641
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:29.040
I'm going to be happy for either a free the team.

1642
01:44:29.070 --> 01:44:33.720
It's going to be a shame that when you guys had got to lose and,
uh,
you know,

1643
01:44:33.810 --> 01:44:38.520
I'm looking forward to a more games Celtics,
Lakers,
uh,

1644
01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:43.100
got respect for the fucking Lakers,
man.
They're a hell of a squad.
And a,

1645
01:44:43.101 --> 01:44:45.810
I was off.
I was really off.
I got to say it again.

1646
01:44:45.811 --> 01:44:50.610
I said Pog who saw was going to get fucking raped and the NBA finals and uh,

1647
01:44:50.611 --> 01:44:55.400
I'm most impressed with him.
Andrew,
uh,
buying him.
Is that his name?
Andrew.

1648
01:44:55.401 --> 01:44:59.060
I'm not a basketball guy.
I'm total bandwagon here.
I'm a fucking hockey guy.

1649
01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:03.870
Um,
for years people have been saying what the fuck this guy going to do?

1650
01:45:03.871 --> 01:45:06.370
But he keeps hurting his knees and it seems like he's,

1651
01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:09.660
he's coming into his own and I don't know,
man.

1652
01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:12.000
It's going to be tough at the Celtics beat him.

1653
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.810
It's going to be really fucking impressive because,
uh,

1654
01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:20.940
I think they younger and they're,
they're quicker,
but we always find a way.

1655
01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:24.870
We find a way to win ugly.
That's what we do.
So we do.

1656
01:45:24.871 --> 01:45:28.290
What about ray ray reining in those threes?

1657
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:31.160
You know,
and I had the whole game on mute.

1658
01:45:31.190 --> 01:45:35.180
I probably missed a lot of the excitement of listen to the crowd go crazy,

1659
01:45:35.181 --> 01:45:39.270
but I don't give a fuck.
That's how I have to do it so I can survive.
So,
uh,

1660
01:45:39.271 --> 01:45:42.240
they have it.
That is the podcast for this week.
Come in a,

1661
