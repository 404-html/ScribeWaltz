1
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.860
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.861 --> 00:00:08.790
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
Yeah.

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.930
<v 2>Ah,</v>

4
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.970
<v 1>just checking in on you.</v>

5
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.020
Just chicken and on you to see all your weeks go with Vivian.

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.990
Was it to frame?
Um,
I'm in New York City.

7
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.860
If I can wake up in a shitty that blows me just for being there and where my

8
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:39.001
fucking sweat pants while eating Tad's steaks.

9
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.450
There's so many people not make it into New York,

10
00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:46.900
but they play that fucking song and everybody thinks they're making it.
Right.

11
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.270
<v 3>D</v>

12
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.350
<v 1>fucking homeless people are taking public shits on the subway grade.</v>

13
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.410
They dropped down on Wall Street people.

14
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.520
Now that was the 90s at all.
Gradually went away.

15
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.280
It all went away.
And now there's like bicycles and chairs in the streets.

16
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.440
This is all shit I might be talking about tonight.

17
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.900
I am in New York for my final press stop and then I am done hyping the,

18
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:24.330
uh,
for the most part I'm done hyping this second season of f is for family.

19
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.550
I told you was out there,
take it or leave it.

20
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.010
Either want to watch it or you don't.

21
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.070
I'm going to be doing a Steven Colbert tonight,
how

22
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.490
it will not air until tomorrow.

23
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.420
So one of the hardest things about doing his show tonight is,

24
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.140
aside from the fact I believe he tapes it,
the Ed Sullivan Theater,

25
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:45.240
which is where I used to do stand up when I did Letterman,

26
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.480
which is where the Beatles,
you know,
did their thing,

27
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:55.250
which is where Jackie Mason allegedly flipped off somebody's,

28
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.300
you know when he's still maintains,
he didn't back on the Ed Sullivan show.

29
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.563
<v 0>Okay.</v>

30
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.270
<v 1>It was Ken who,
if you want to go far enough back,</v>

31
00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:06.820
I'm sure there was some date of Americans just chilling out there eating a

32
00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:09.910
fucking rabbit.
They can look at this paradise.

33
00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:14.680
It's like the entire Strip a Manhattan and all it looks like central park and

34
00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:16.390
the other Indian native American goes,

35
00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:20.260
what the fuck is central park at any points to a ship of white people coming

36
00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:22.600
over the horizon?
Ah,
these fucking people tell you about

37
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.260
the first fucking Quakers.
Would they Quaker?

38
00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:32.650
What's the difference between Quakers and those people with the buckles on the

39
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:37.360
hat that first stopped off at Plymouth Rock,
if that ever happened on the Nina,

40
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:41.980
the Pinta and the Santa Marina,
Santa Maria,
Nina,

41
00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:44.290
the Pinta Center.
But they sound like they're from Spain.
Right?

42
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.870
Why were they a bunch of white people from England

43
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.080
writing in Spanish boats.
This is like f one.
Let me get this straight.

44
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:58.410
This is the,
this is the team from India,
yet they have a Mercedes engine.

45
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.400
Um,
all right.
I'm all over the map.
I'm all over the map.

46
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:07.720
I need to get focused.
All right.
I am pretty focused.

47
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:12.010
I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you why all Billie no fund.
Oh,
you know,
it was Billy,

48
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.500
you know,
half of fun.
You know,

49
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.070
cause I was still celebrating my birthday so I had a couple of glasses of wine,

50
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.270
you know,
sitting there like I was sophisticated.
Like I read,
you know,

51
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:23.380
like I was a social life.

52
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.490
Like I was the kind of person that you just invite to a party because I'm an

53
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:31.360
interesting person to have there.
You know,
you ever seen that?
Like in France,

54
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:35.290
they still have social lights.
They some,
I don't know how they make a living,

55
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.930
but they're just these people who don't really have jobs.

56
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.790
And if you have a party,

57
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:43.720
it's not a party unless you invite this person and everybody's dying to get into

58
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:48.721
the circle that they stand in to discuss anything from art to world politics to

59
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:55.570
fashion.
Not saying that fashion isn't an art form.

60
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.190
Okay.
For all the fucking dressmakers who listen to this.

61
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:03.010
I have a lot of dressmakers by the way,
that listen to this podcast,
you know,

62
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.970
a lot of them always have to stop and hit rewind because some of their sequence

63
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:11.550
hit the floor and they couldn't quite make out what I was saying.
Um,

64
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.260
what am I saying?
My voice is in the same register as sequence hitting the floor.

65
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:18.220
I think.
I think I am.

66
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.110
I think that's the most roundabout way anybody has ever called themselves,

67
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.150
you know,
uh,
a bit of a Nancy boy.
Oh,
you mean the guy with these,

68
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.380
the sequin tone voice.
All right.

69
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.640
What am I saying here on cake?
I got to,
I have a,
I have a major,

70
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.180
major announcement on so many different levels here.
All right.

71
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.070
I hope you're sitting down.
I'm pregnant.
Okay.

72
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.160
I was taking these hormones to try and lose weight and I grew a wound.

73
00:04:50.221 --> 00:04:53.110
Somehow I got abs,
but you know,
there's always,
you know,

74
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:56.590
you can't have your cake and eat it and somehow I got pregnant,
you know,

75
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.370
you wouldn't think,
you know,
I somehow while jerking off,
sorry.
Anyways,
uh,

76
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.930
what I want to say here is,
uh,
versus uh,

77
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.950
Paul Versey.

78
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.160
I'm doing this bad or at the all things comedy network is going to be producing

79
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:17.500
their first hour long standup special.

80
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.220
And the person who we picked to do it is,
uh,

81
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.380
my good friend friend of the podcast.
Um,

82
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.230
one of the four horsemen on the road that I take out there,

83
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:34.231
Paul Versey is going to be doing a special tickets are on sale now.

84
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.240
All right.
And um,

85
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.820
this actually the idea of this was brought to us by his good friend Saturday

86
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.750
night lives on Pete Davidson,
Pete Davidson,

87
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:48.310
Al and all things comedy.

88
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.180
Al Madrigal and myself are all going to be involved,
um,

89
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.460
with producing the standup special and,
uh,
me and Pete will be going on.

90
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.180
Um,
the night of Paul's shows,

91
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.850
he's going to be doing two shows on August 13th,

92
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:09.851
one at 7:00 PM one at 9:30 PM at the Tarrytown music hall in Tarrytown,

93
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:16.010
New York.
Um,
one of my favorite theaters out there and I'm,

94
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.910
Paul's obviously going to be closing,
doing his special and in the beginning,
uh,

95
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.200
me and Pete are going to mess around or whatever,
do some stuff,
make you laugh,

96
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.200
warm up the crowd for Paul.
And then Paul's going to absolutely kill it.

97
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.810
This is the biggest thing that I've done in my career.

98
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:34.400
I'd never produced anything like this.
We're putting a lot of money out there.
Uh,

99
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.620
Paul is a beast.
Um,

100
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.340
it would mean the world to me and DePaul and it was family baggaged all Becky's

101
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:46.940
tier a few guys came down.
Um,
tickets are only 20 bucks.

102
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.770
Um,
I'll be hanging out,
meeting people after the show.
Whenever you want to do,

103
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:53.390
I'll fucking,
whatever you want me to do,

104
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:55.970
just whatever I have to do to fill this thing up.

105
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:59.270
So Paul Versey can do his specialty or,
so,
uh,

106
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:01.160
we're going to have the ticket link and everything like that.

107
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:04.940
The tickets are alive.
Whatever the,
the,
you can buy them right now.

108
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.770
You can pull over in your car,

109
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.760
you can continue to drive and run that risk and try to buy tickets while you're

110
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:14.030
driving.
Um,
August 13th,

111
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.870
it's a Sunday night in August on the 13th,

112
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.830
a 7:00 PM 9:30 PM the Tarrytown music hall.

113
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.020
Um,
there's going to be a huge night really looking forward to itself.

114
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.710
Oh,
and also,
you know what else I forgot to bring up.
Holy Shit.

115
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.390
The F is for family.
I tweeted about it.
We finally,
we got some march,

116
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.640
we got tee shirts,
we got some for the ladies from,

117
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.400
for the men,
you know,
some for the boys and girls.

118
00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:46.700
We've got everything down there.
You know,
we got some Kevin Shirts,
frank shirts,

119
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:49.520
efforts for families,
shirts,
Vic shirts,
you know,

120
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:51.980
and just when you think you have all the bases covered,
people go,

121
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:54.050
what about this character?
Why don't you have his shit?

122
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:55.870
And I think cause they get,

123
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.360
they're going mainstream at first and then eventually everybody will have some

124
00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:03.110
stuff.
All right.
Um,
anyway,

125
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:07.900
so let's get down to what the fuck went on this week.
The big story yet that,

126
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:10.880
that Dad Butoh do Conor McGregor

127
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.850
and a money Mayweather,
I don't even know his first name.

128
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.710
The Floyd,
Floyd money moneymaking get money.

129
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.480
Mayweather are going to have a boxing match in August.

130
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.630
Pay per view.
What do you guys think about this?

131
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:34.631
Are you going to take your hard earned paper that is backed by no gold or you're

132
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.700
going to write a piece,
a number on a piece of paper,

133
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:43.210
stick it in another piece of paper and mail it to the paper view people to watch

134
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:48.230
this fight?
Do you think a,
this is fucking amazing or a B,

135
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.850
this has gotta be one of the dumbest fucking things I've ever heard in my life.

136
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.330
Um,
you know me,
I'm a fucking curmudgeon,

137
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.910
but I'm also wrong a lot.
God knows that God knows I'm wrong.
I mean,

138
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:05.550
I didn't know something the other day.
What's somebody correct me on?

139
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.210
I didn't know about Kryptonite people,
you know,

140
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.930
and that's what I love about my fan base on this podcast.
They're smart enough,

141
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.491
you know,

142
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:19.491
when I make a major full pause such as that of not describing Superman's planet

143
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:23.400
blowing up and what Kryptonite really is,
you know,

144
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.940
I will always regret that and I'll never be able to apologize long enough.

145
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:31.170
A lot of people had to apologize over the last couple of weeks in my industry

146
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.063
and um,

147
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:33.290
<v 0>yeah,</v>

148
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.180
<v 1>and they put their controversies behind them,</v>

149
00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:38.760
but I don't think I'll ever outlive not knowing,
um,

150
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.770
what Kryptonite was and I,
I accept full responsibility.

151
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.000
Um,
anyways,
I,
this is like the dumbest fucking thing ever.

152
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

153
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:53.200
<v 1>Okay.
Conor McGregor fights for living Mayweather fights for a living,</v>

154
00:09:53.201 --> 00:09:56.830
but that's,
that's it.
So they're just going to box.

155
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.970
All right.
They're going to be wearing the fucking 16 ounce gloves,

156
00:10:00.971 --> 00:10:04.150
whatever the fuck a box of where's this is?

157
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.730
This is the stupidest fucking thing ever.
But this is,

158
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.610
this is like watching Duran go to the warriors,

159
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.310
you know the warriors.
So it's over.
It's fucking over.

160
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.490
It's fits over.

161
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.240
Watching the Golden State Warriors Win the NBA championship this year was

162
00:10:22.241 --> 00:10:26.860
basically watching like a bad summertime movie.
It was big.

163
00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:29.830
It was loud and you knew how it was going to end and it was,
yeah,

164
00:10:29.831 --> 00:10:33.430
it was fucking boring.
Right.
By the way,
congratulations.

165
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.340
I should at least do that.
Okay.
I mean this fucking in the war is our amazing,

166
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:41.620
it's actually bad that Durant joined them as far as like their legacy because

167
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:47.070
you really had a team that you know has already had the potential to be like a

168
00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.600
dynasty.
They came within a couple of seconds.

169
00:10:49.601 --> 00:10:52.420
So winning back to back without Durant going there.

170
00:10:52.421 --> 00:10:56.080
So congratulations to the warriors.
Congratulations to their fans.

171
00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:01.260
My condolences to any fan of basketball that enjoys competition and enjoys seven

172
00:11:01.301 --> 00:11:02.134
game series.

173
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.620
Congratulations to people that want to save the environment and want four people

174
00:11:08.621 --> 00:11:12.430
in a fucking car.
The pile on team.
That's the basketball team for you.

175
00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.650
Cause I just look at it as a metaphor.

176
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.470
There wasn't a lack of competition that was a thumbs up for the diamond lane.

177
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.440
Let's get all the stars in the same vehicle.
All right?
Mcgregor verse May,

178
00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:30.441
whether this would basically be like if you took Jerry Rice in the prime of his

179
00:11:31.031 --> 00:11:34.450
career,
Tom Brady in the prime of his career,
and you're like,

180
00:11:34.451 --> 00:11:37.090
let's figure out who's a better football player.

181
00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.810
But the only way you are going to measure that it was how far they could throw a

182
00:11:40.811 --> 00:11:44.590
football.
You aren't going to do the 40 yard dash.

183
00:11:44.591 --> 00:11:48.940
She won't get to see if they could catch.
You know what I mean?
I Dunno.

184
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.850
It's just
Mayweather boxes.

185
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.130
They're to have a boxing match.

186
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.570
Now you know how fucking over this fight would be if McGregor was allowed to
use,

187
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.570
you know everything else that he does,

188
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.310
taking it to the ground that kicks to fucking choke,

189
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.710
choke him out all,
I mean I don't,

190
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.690
I don't know shit about the fight game and I know this is fucking stupid.

191
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.820
This is dumb.
Well,
what do you have next to a fucking elephant?

192
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:18.010
First of fucking Cheetah and they're gonna have a foot race.

193
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.760
What does drug is animals ever one of them fat to dead animals ever?

194
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.380
Let's have a competition between the two of them based on nothing but speed

195
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.130
dump truck for his Lamborghini.
Both forms of transportation.

196
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.700
Yeah.
I'll tell you what's going to be,

197
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.790
the only thing that's going to be interesting is if Mayweather can actually

198
00:12:41.791 --> 00:12:46.650
knock him out.
He's a 40 year old guy.
I know his hands.
Uh,
you know,

199
00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:50.240
he,
I believe he has constant pain in them.
Um,

200
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.520
I'm a huge fan of both of them.
And uh,

201
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.940
this is nothing more than a fucking money grab.

202
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.300
This is a smash and fucking grab.
This is like when fucking,

203
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:02.360
<v 0>yeah.</v>

204
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.600
<v 1>It's like with Bobby Ray.
This is like,
I put this in the same,</v>

205
00:13:05.601 --> 00:13:10.280
it's a better version of when Bobby Riggs played Billie Jean King or fucking

206
00:13:10.281 --> 00:13:13.390
Muhammad Ali fought Lyle Zeto.
Ah,

207
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.820
how Kogan fought fucking rocky Balboa or whatever the fuck.
I mean,
this is,
it's,

208
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.120
it's in that vein.
You know,

209
00:13:20.121 --> 00:13:23.840
I think it's really ironic that the circus just went on a business and now

210
00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:25.100
they're having this paper view.

211
00:13:25.101 --> 00:13:29.210
I bet the same people who cashed out on the circus,
speaking of elephants,

212
00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:33.230
they got their money behind this one.
This is not.
Um,

213
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.540
and what's going to be funny is all the mouth breathers,

214
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:40.360
who want to say boxing's a better form.
If you know when Mei,

215
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:42.410
whether beats fucking McGregor buy out,

216
00:13:42.411 --> 00:13:46.370
pointing him or whatever the fuck he's going to do,
um,

217
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.230
everyone's gonna be seek bug bucks.
It's better than MMA.
It's gonna be like,
dude,

218
00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.090
he's not doing it.

219
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.770
This is like fucking having a breakdancer keg guy battle a guy who does nothing

220
00:13:57.771 --> 00:14:00.560
but the waltz and we're going to have a waltzing contest.

221
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.840
Not to say that the break dance couldn't figure it out.

222
00:14:05.841 --> 00:14:06.860
He doesn't have enough time.

223
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.500
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

224
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.860
<v 1>So here's the deal.
I am,</v>

225
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.620
I'm going to say this right now and I probably won't because I'll probably get

226
00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:16.950
sucked into the,
I'm going to do my best to not get into this,

227
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.280
to get sucked into the hype of this fucking fight.
All right.

228
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:27.130
I am going to,
uh,
I'm going to wait.
I'm just gonna I'm sitting it out.

229
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.790
Okay.
And I'm hoping I'm wrong and I hope people say,
Bill,

230
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.310
that was the greatest fucking fight I've ever seen in my life.
It went,

231
00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:36.010
the distance is somehow against all odds,

232
00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:39.000
but Gregor beat Mayweather and then I'll be like,
you know what?
Then I'm gonna,

233
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.380
I'll sit down and I'll fucking watch out.
Dude.
I don't give a shit.

234
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.710
That's like after you see a movie,
when the Oscar,
you know,

235
00:14:45.711 --> 00:14:48.100
you kind of know what the movie's about,
but you still had seen it.

236
00:14:48.101 --> 00:14:52.130
You can go back and watch it.
Right.
This is the one thing I am

237
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.700
<v 0>really excited about is that Mcgregor and Mayweather are going to make a bunch</v>

238
00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:58.920
of fucking money.
Good for them,
good for them.
You know,

239
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.210
because those guys usually ended up with their brains all fucked up.
You know,

240
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:04.580
they might as well have some money.
Right.
So good for them.

241
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:07.370
So I'm glad a bunch of people are going to watch that and think that this is

242
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:09.950
going to be,
you know,
let's see what's better.

243
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.130
M m a R fucking boxing.

244
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.760
They already decided that way back before Dana white even got into this shit

245
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:19.700
back when it was,
just remember the early days when they didn't,

246
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.390
I didn't know what the name of it was.
I remember portrays telling me,
dude,

247
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:27.690
you gotta watch this shit way back in the day when,
uh,

248
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.880
you know that fucking boxer came in wearing one boxing glove.

249
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:37.910
He fought the other guy yet one boxing glove on and the other guy had more of a

250
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:38.870
wrestling background.

251
00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:41.990
He just put the guy on his back and now he's sitting there with one hand and the

252
00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:45.950
other hand's got a mitten on it that's tied to his wrist and he can't get it
off.

253
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.310
It was a shit show.
So,
um,
okay.

254
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.680
<v 1>I Dunno,
I dunno.
You never know what the fucking app,</v>

255
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:58.500
you never know what can happen.
But
I will say this,

256
00:15:58.501 --> 00:16:01.410
I can't put whoever the fuck put that together.
Jesus Christ.

257
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.610
I can't imagine the Mana hoops you had to jump to.

258
00:16:05.611 --> 00:16:08.550
Now that I'm getting into producing here and I'm producing a special

259
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.490
for Paul Versey didn't look at me.
I already feel a little more arrogant.

260
00:16:14.491 --> 00:16:18.930
I mean get myself some big fancy Hollywood reading glasses,
those giant ones.

261
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.540
Hey,
by the way,
what is going on with the world?

262
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:24.180
This fucking guy and went to a softball game and shot it up.

263
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.300
Now I know it's not John Goodman,
you know,
kind of looks like him.

264
00:16:27.301 --> 00:16:30.000
Is it his brother Ron?
Is it Ron Goodman?

265
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.400
Trump haters shoots GOP big
GLP.

266
00:16:36.401 --> 00:16:40.270
Big Comma.
Three others.
Both parties stunned.

267
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:41.350
<v 0>Okay.</v>

268
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:45.380
<v 1>By ball field horror.
Well yeah,
obviously.
Did you need to say that?
Oh,</v>

269
00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:50.110
it was one of them.
Not a dog.
You know what happened?
She plays softball.

270
00:16:50.111 --> 00:16:54.880
Shit like this happens.
Left wing Zealot,
whatever that means.
Shoots,

271
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:59.040
Republicans
Rep for others.
Look at us.

272
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.190
This is fucking hilarious.
Cause the daily news is,

273
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.880
is left leaning since Trump paid or they did get that out.

274
00:17:05.881 --> 00:17:08.150
This is says they make sure to say both parties are.

275
00:17:08.151 --> 00:17:12.540
So that's why they did it because they left these.
And then over here,
the posts,

276
00:17:12.541 --> 00:17:17.540
who's right wing as like left wing zealots shoots Republican Rep for uh,

277
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.100
for others.
Uh,

278
00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.860
why do you guys think this shit that keeps happening?
I think it's the internet,

279
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.180
you know,
and I'm telling you right now,
if the shit like this keeps happening,

280
00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.220
if we don't all grow the fuck up,

281
00:17:32.221 --> 00:17:36.240
they're going to take the internet away from us and it probably be a smart thing

282
00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.040
and we should go back to just sort of living small lives,
entertaining ourselves,

283
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:45.940
sitting on stoops during hot days,
you know,
start making music.
Thank you.

284
00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:47.130
Laptop won't work anymore.

285
00:17:47.131 --> 00:17:50.280
That'll be like the modern day washboard I think need to just kind of go back to

286
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:53.130
that.
You don't need to happen.
People need to go back to playing cards,

287
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.430
playing hearts,
Fan Tan,
all those old bridge.

288
00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.500
I think that that's what needs to happen.

289
00:17:58.501 --> 00:18:03.501
People need to just kind of walk away from social media and all of this shit.

290
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.570
Cause I think people,
I don't know what the deal is.
They get,

291
00:18:06.571 --> 00:18:10.200
they get into fucking what kind of a fucking lunatic?

292
00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.470
I mean,
what,
what was he trying to,

293
00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:16.490
<v 4>yeah,</v>

294
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.420
<v 1>I don't even,
I don't even like,
I usually avoid those things,
but I,
you know,</v>

295
00:18:20.421 --> 00:18:21.800
I have,
I'm doing a talk show today,

296
00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:24.800
so I got to fucking know what's going on in the world and be like,

297
00:18:24.801 --> 00:18:26.900
what's the deal with this?
So what's the deal with that?

298
00:18:26.901 --> 00:18:29.300
So I figured it'd be the usual.
Some politician got caught,

299
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:34.280
shown his dick or banging a stripper,
but now it's just a,
it's just a bunch of,

300
00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:38.330
he came in fucking play softball anymore.
See,

301
00:18:38.331 --> 00:18:41.360
this is why I don't read the paper.
It just makes you upset.
You know what?

302
00:18:41.361 --> 00:18:43.940
Fuck this.
I'm going for the bread and circus.
I'm going to fucking,

303
00:18:43.941 --> 00:18:48.130
I'm going to get McGregor first.
Mayweather,
you know,

304
00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:54.250
then who do I root for?
I think I got to root for Mayweather.

305
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.910
But even though I always go for the underdog,

306
00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.970
which Mcgregor has to be considering,
you know,

307
00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:02.510
he has this Swiss army knife of shitty knows how to do and it's like,
no,

308
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.650
they only knife you can take out is a,
the one may whether it's going to use,

309
00:19:06.651 --> 00:19:09.380
and he's been sharpening his for the last fucking 30,

310
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.370
40 years.
He's been boxing his whole life.

311
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.273
<v 4>MMM.</v>

312
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.680
<v 1>I will say this though,
if Mcgregor beats may,
whether,
I mean,</v>

313
00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:22.000
is that the end of boxing?

314
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:28.350
Did I really just say that is well,
I know.
Should I be on ESPN right now?

315
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:32.300
Will this be the end of boxing?
Um,

316
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.930
it was already bad when Mayweather and fucking,
uh,
the Filipino dude,

317
00:19:38.931 --> 00:19:40.400
what the fuck's his name there?
You know,

318
00:19:40.401 --> 00:19:42.320
when they should have fought like 30 years earlier,

319
00:19:42.321 --> 00:19:45.920
they finally got around to fighting and then the,
the,
the,

320
00:19:45.921 --> 00:19:49.370
the Filipino guy who was also like a congressman at that point and like a

321
00:19:49.371 --> 00:19:50.780
karaoke singer,
I believe.

322
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.113
<v 4>MMM.</v>

323
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.010
<v 1>He had like a hurt hand when they finally find him.</v>

324
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:57.450
He just took everybody's fucking money.

325
00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.340
How many company White Bentley's are you going to buy?
This guy's,
you know,

326
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.270
at some point people.

327
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:06.543
<v 4>MMM.</v>

328
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.740
<v 1>Anyways,
so I'm here in New York and I'm,
I'm,</v>

329
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.310
I'm sober William now and I'm,
I'm enjoying it.

330
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:19.810
I really am.
I'm getting eight.
I was fucking sleep,
you know,
I wake up,

331
00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.820
I feel good.
The Sun's a little brighter.
Um,

332
00:20:24.821 --> 00:20:28.060
you know,
and it feels good to have it.
They have it on me is before,
you know,

333
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.860
it used to be like had birds.

334
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.193
<v 4>MMM.</v>

335
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.360
<v 1>So my new thing now is I just meet people and I go to dinner,</v>

336
00:20:35.361 --> 00:20:39.050
I go to fucking lunch with them,
you know.
So I just met with my,

337
00:20:39.051 --> 00:20:42.290
one of my buddies,
uh,
that runs to stand over there,

338
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:47.860
stand comedy club.
And uh,
we went over to a diner and I'm sitting there and,

339
00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:52.840
uh,
the thing about La is,
is a bunch of characters in la,
but we're in cars,

340
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:55.420
so you don't get to interact with people in New York.

341
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:57.700
You just walk down the streets,
you just get to over here,
all this shit.

342
00:20:57.701 --> 00:21:00.250
So I'm sitting there waiting for my buddy to show up and there's this lady,

343
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.870
this lady,
older lady sitting in this booth and she,
she,
you know,

344
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.360
you know little kids wave cause it just learning how to use their arm after a

345
00:21:09.361 --> 00:21:11.380
while you get so old you forget how to use it again.

346
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.180
So she's doing like a little kid way of like,

347
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.230
it's just like she sort of shaking that limb in her hands,

348
00:21:17.231 --> 00:21:20.330
just sort of flopping around as if she has no control over a wrist anymore.

349
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:24.430
That old lady wave,
right.
So the way it comes over and says,
what's the problem?

350
00:21:24.431 --> 00:21:28.660
She's like,
yes,
there's something wrong with my coke.
And I'm thinking,

351
00:21:28.661 --> 00:21:32.050
okay they brought Pepsi instead of whatever Coca Cola.
She goes,

352
00:21:32.051 --> 00:21:35.860
there's something wrong with my coke.
She goes,
it's not an a,

353
00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:39.480
can't so you know the way to la.
He goes,
all right man,
well we'll take care of.

354
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:44.320
Well we'll fix that for you.
Right.
And she continues ongoing.

355
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.990
I don't know if I forgot to say it,
I probably did,

356
00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:48.430
but it's supposed to be at a kid.

357
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.790
So he goes to take a full glass of coke away and as he takes away she goes,

358
00:21:51.791 --> 00:21:52.990
I didn't drink out of it.

359
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:58.030
Like he was just going to pass it on to the next person that orders a coke,

360
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:02.110
which was hilarious.
So then I'm sitting there with a buddy of mine,

361
00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:07.150
they buddies shows up and as we're talking we were discussing a getting older

362
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:13.940
and he had some fucking ailment he's been dealing with and that woman chimes in

363
00:22:13.941 --> 00:22:18.941
and says she has the same whatever the fuck it was fucking older person think

364
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:25.090
she'd shines in that she has the same thing and it isn't this type,

365
00:22:25.091 --> 00:22:28.570
it's that type.
And it just,
it felt like I was on a Seinfeld episode.

366
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.120
Um,
and then I was just sitting there laughing cause she just kept talking to my

367
00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:36.790
buddy and had to turn around and talking to her and I was muttering to him going

368
00:22:36.791 --> 00:22:39.240
like,
I want to see how good your wrap it up skill sir.

369
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.950
How are you going to get out of this one?
And he turned back laughing,
going,

370
00:22:41.951 --> 00:22:44.380
I don't know,
do we have to change the subject?
Because she kept shining a minute.

371
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.180
Do you have to talk quieter?
It's,
can she hear us right now?
Um,

372
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.990
but I don't know.
I thought it was an la guy.

373
00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:56.830
I've just been coming back to New York too much lately and I'm starting to feel

374
00:22:56.831 --> 00:22:58.450
like I want to live back here again,

375
00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:03.880
which is scaring me because I have so many friends in a whole life out in la.

376
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.010
But I mean,
I'm doing F is for family,
so I can't come back.

377
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:09.640
But I never thought I'd,
I thought I was a lifer out in la,

378
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.920
but I'm coming back here and I'm kind of liking it.
So,
um,

379
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.470
this is the exact same feeling I used to have when I would go out to la from New

380
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.380
York after I swore I would never live out in la again.

381
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.170
But then I'm also thinking like,
Bill,

382
00:23:23.171 --> 00:23:27.280
is this just how you're wired?

383
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.480
Where after a while you just get tired of a fucking place and then you want to,

384
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.110
I don't know,
Lord,
out with,

385
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.990
oh,
by the way,
a rested piece,
Greg Allman,
uh,

386
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:45.530
Jesus Christ,
end of an era.
The amount of fucking people,
by the way,

387
00:23:45.531 --> 00:23:47.570
it's just scare me because it's just,
it's,
it's,

388
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.990
it used to be like people that when I was a little kid,

389
00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:54.560
I would watch their shit and they were already old.
You know,

390
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.830
when the Bob hopes to bing Crosby's The d Martins,

391
00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.520
the Sammy Davis Jr to Frank Sinatra's,
all of them,
you know,

392
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:05.000
all of them both started passing away,
but they will all telly Savalas,

393
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.370
you know,
Lee Marvin,
Charles Bronson,
all of those guys,

394
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:16.770
Paul Newman,
Steve Mcqueen,
all of them.
Yule Brenner,
Jesus Christ till we get it.

395
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.530
They were all fucking way before my time.

396
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:23.040
A lot of them were first generation or they came over,
you know,
because we,

397
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.560
Bronson came over from Poland.
He worked in like coal mines and Shit.
And uh,

398
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.130
but now it's catching up to where the fuck I am.

399
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:38.330
You know,
Batman died.
Davy Jones died from one of the monkeys,

400
00:24:38.331 --> 00:24:39.650
right?
He died.

401
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.420
<v 0>All right.</v>

402
00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.700
<v 1>Greg Allman died.
George Michael,</v>

403
00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:51.850
it's it skits creeping up,
right.

404
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:55.390
It's starting to creep up to like now these are like people who were born,

405
00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:02.000
born in the forties 50s a couple people around 1960 I was born in 68 and say,

406
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:02.840
hey,
hey,
hey,

407
00:25:02.841 --> 00:25:07.841
hey fucking pumped the brakes here and this is classic me.

408
00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:09.973
Right.

409
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:15.190
I can still somehow make somebody else's death about myself.

410
00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.980
Isn't that nice?
All right,
so listen to this shit.

411
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:24.470
I went into fucking guitars Santa for like the first time in years.

412
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:29.630
I never go in there,
but my wife was around the corner,
you know,

413
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.490
taking my lovely daughter to some doctor's appointment.
You know,

414
00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:38.120
whenever she goes over there she,
my daughter cries and stuff.
I don't like it.

415
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.950
I don't like it.
I know she comes out better.
I know the doctor is amazing.

416
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.640
I don't like going over there,
you know,
you know,
I just don't,
you know,

417
00:25:46.641 --> 00:25:49.220
you thought it gets shots and shit or whatever.
By the way,

418
00:25:49.221 --> 00:25:53.330
we did the total immune thing and my daughter's fine by the way.

419
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.490
We did all of that shit.
Thank God.

420
00:25:55.491 --> 00:25:57.890
Cause everyone fucking was scaring the shit out of you.
Like,

421
00:25:57.891 --> 00:26:02.050
don't dog fucking get him vaccinated for the mops.

422
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.370
That's gonna cause this,
it's going to cause that.

423
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.800
And when I finally did was I realized everybody telling me that none of them

424
00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:14.150
were wearing lab coats and none of them had medical degrees framed pictures

425
00:26:14.151 --> 00:26:18.080
behind me.
And I said,

426
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.260
I'm going to roll the dice with the person that went to school for this shit.

427
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.540
And we did.
And she's fine.
She's totally alert,
smiles and all that type of shit.

428
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:28.940
There was nothing bad happened.
Thank fucking Christ,

429
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:31.910
but I don't like to be there when that shit goes down.
So I just said,
listen,

430
00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.610
I'm gonna fucking,
I'll be around the corner.

431
00:26:34.611 --> 00:26:37.460
I'm going to go buy some drum sticks,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

432
00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:39.640
So I walk into guitars Satta

433
00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:43.840
and I'm there,
right as it's

434
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.570
<v 0>10 minutes before it opens,</v>

435
00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:48.540
it finally opens and I go upstairs to their drum department,
you know,

436
00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.980
because they always tell he's banished drums to the back of the music that

437
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:57.210
they're always like,
go fuck yourself.
Right.
Guitar was the hot chick,
you know?

438
00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.980
Or it's sort,
it used to be,
now I'm finding the electronics,
all this debt,

439
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.640
a whole generation of like DJ music and all that shit is like it that's becoming

440
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:10.790
coming up more to the front of the store or becoming a larger surface area of

441
00:27:12.061 --> 00:27:12.894
the store,

442
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.640
which is another thing making me feel old other than all these people that,

443
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:19.980
you know,
where I remembered,
like they were young.

444
00:27:19.981 --> 00:27:22.830
That's what I'm just trying to say.
They would like young,
when I was young,

445
00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:26.550
they will like in their twenties and shit and now they've lived a full life and

446
00:27:26.551 --> 00:27:30.120
are dead.
And I'm like,
how the fuck does that happen?
It's like,
well,
Bill,

447
00:27:30.121 --> 00:27:33.840
you're 49 in 20 years you can be 69,
you'd be pushing 70.

448
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:38.130
It's how fast it fucking goes.
So,
um,

449
00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.840
<v 1>I didn't want to fuck my point West Jesus Christ,
am I going to die in this week?</v>

450
00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.830
Um,
was I saying oh yeah.

451
00:27:47.831 --> 00:27:52.570
So I go over to the fucking guitar center and uh,
I walk in,

452
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.440
so I go upstairs to buy some drum sticks and I'm,
they're so fucking early,

453
00:27:56.441 --> 00:27:57.940
there's like nobody there.

454
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:04.910
So I walk up and I grabbed my,
my drum sticks.
I always get,
you know,

455
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:09.830
get it five B right.
And I fucking,
well I'm tried to electronic drum kits,

456
00:28:09.831 --> 00:28:10.311
you know what I mean?

457
00:28:10.311 --> 00:28:13.790
They got that sick ass Roland one that has like literally like a regular

458
00:28:13.791 --> 00:28:17.150
acoustic look at Bass Drum.
It's fucking around on that thing.

459
00:28:17.151 --> 00:28:21.410
That thing's amazing.
Oh my God.

460
00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.340
If you want to ever feel like you're ready to play a fucking arena,

461
00:28:25.341 --> 00:28:29.090
sit down or one of those fucking Roland kits.
And this is not free advertising,

462
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:33.860
I'm just calling a spade a spade there.
Fucking unbelievable.
So,
um,

463
00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.650
anyways,
I'm looking around and I sit behind this one kid and I hit,

464
00:28:38.651 --> 00:28:41.530
go to hit the bass drum and they got this head on it that looks like a regular

465
00:28:41.531 --> 00:28:44.020
head.
It barely makes any noise.
I'm like,
what the fuck is this?

466
00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:48.850
What does this technology,
I didn't know this existed.
And um,

467
00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:49.781
then I was looking at,

468
00:28:49.781 --> 00:28:53.620
they had the little quest love breakbeat kit and then they had another one,

469
00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.790
like an upgraded version of that,
which was the,
uh,
the sonar kit.

470
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.630
And I was like,
Oh fuck,
look at these little ass things.

471
00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.600
And then they've got these heads that make no fucking noise.

472
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.353
<v 0>Right?</v>

473
00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.870
<v 1>What the fuck?
So I,
I just,
I dunno,
I just started looking and I'm like,</v>

474
00:29:11.871 --> 00:29:14.630
Father's Day.
Father's day is coming up this weekend.

475
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:20.780
How about happy father's day to me,
cause I got one of those,
my garage,

476
00:29:20.781 --> 00:29:25.700
I've got this DW,
like those practice pad kits and those things fucking suck.

477
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:30.860
You can't get through a song without something falling off.
They just suck.

478
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.620
I fucking hate the thing.
All right.
I want to get rid of it.

479
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.910
So I'm sitting there going,
all right,

480
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:40.130
I ordered a drum kit and I have a studio space ready to go,

481
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.570
but didn't realize I thought I could just go down and get the drum kit.

482
00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:45.150
But the color I wanted,
I had to order it.

483
00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:48.100
It's not going to be here for fucking two months.
So now what do I do?

484
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.060
What do I do in the meantime?
And then suddenly I get this idea go,

485
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:54.760
I know I'm going to buy one of these little fucking Martini kits here.
All right,

486
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:59.440
I'll keep the regular heads on and I'll just play in the studio space on the

487
00:29:59.441 --> 00:30:01.870
small kid.
And then when my real kick comes,

488
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.380
I'll just get rid of the DW one in my garage and put the silent heads on it.

489
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.840
I could just practice on that when I don't have time to drive out of the fucking

490
00:30:07.841 --> 00:30:10.960
little studio space.
This is perfect.
So then I was like,
what do I do?

491
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:15.160
What do I get?
The Ludwig by American Questlove or the sonar kit,

492
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:20.350
Phil Rudd.
ACDC.
Steve Smith,
right Ben?
He grabbed Holly's monsters,

493
00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:22.930
play on these fucking things.
And um,

494
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:26.260
I actually ended up going with the sonar kit.

495
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.220
A bass drum has a little bit deeper than the floor time wasn't a 13.

496
00:30:30.221 --> 00:30:34.660
It was a 14 and a,
it was a bad ass,
a little bebop kind of kit.
And I've,

497
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:39.070
I've gone off the fucking rails listening to jazz drummers.

498
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.580
I never understood it.
And now with my great drum teacher and everything,

499
00:30:42.581 --> 00:30:44.020
I'm starting to understand it to the point,

500
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.750
if I see you the text messaging that I had,

501
00:30:46.751 --> 00:30:51.370
the drum nerd text messaging than I had with um,

502
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.630
my,
uh,
my drum teacher.
Oh,
before I say that,
by the way,

503
00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:00.760
what is so amazing about getting rid of that John Bonham set up that I had is

504
00:31:00.761 --> 00:31:04.660
now the whole world of what the fuck do I want to play has opened up.

505
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.760
And I don't have any drum kit already taken up space.
That was,
you know,

506
00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:11.860
somebody else loved and I loved them.

507
00:31:11.861 --> 00:31:14.710
So now I'm going to try to step into their shoes and it never fucking works.

508
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.240
That is completely gone.

509
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:20.190
And now I'm just looking at all these different drum set score and add and

510
00:31:20.191 --> 00:31:24.400
fucking like a little bit of that with a little bit of this.
It's unreal.

511
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.850
So I buy the thing and you know,

512
00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:31.540
I'm supposed to walk back over to the doctor's office with a pair of drum sticks

513
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:37.590
and uh,
you know,
get back in the car with my lovely wife,

514
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:40.030
my beautiful daughter.
But,
um,

515
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.010
now I bought a little drum kit,
so I got this giant box.
So I just ended up going,

516
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:51.820
I fuck this.
I got to take a picture of the box.
I just stood in the back garage.

517
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.240
Uh,
they got a parking lot behind the place and I was just like,
yeah,

518
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.270
I kind of bought something

519
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:04.930
and I just took a picture of the box with the sonar kit and I just wrote happy

520
00:32:04.931 --> 00:32:09.730
father's day to me near as cool as shit she just wrote.
Oh,

521
00:32:09.731 --> 00:32:14.200
Jesus.
She so fucking cool.
She doesn't give a shit.
Right.
Um,

522
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.350
so she pulled up and then I opened up on my credit.

523
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:21.430
We got the fucking little hatchback fucking thing here and I opened it up in the

524
00:32:21.431 --> 00:32:23.110
goddamn strollers in this.

525
00:32:23.111 --> 00:32:27.190
So I had to move shit around and do all this fucking stuff.
And I gotta tell you,

526
00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.160
I cannot fucking wait.

527
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:33.650
I'm moving into my a little studio thing tomorrow and I cannot fuck a weight.

528
00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:37.630
And did they mention,
I've gone off the rails,
listen to these jazz drummers,

529
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:41.330
and I am now convinced that Tony Williams is the greatest drummer of all time

530
00:32:41.331 --> 00:32:44.630
and it's not even fucking close.
I don't want to start a debate.
I know.

531
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:46.610
I just did the fucking guys unbelievable.

532
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:51.080
And I never understood what he was doing other than that he was playing 90

533
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.980
million miles an hour on his ride cymbal.
So I was listening to this album,

534
00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:57.710
a miles Davis miles smiles.

535
00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.700
And there's this song on there called footprints and it's one of those things

536
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:03.020
that when I was younger,

537
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:07.700
meaning like 46 or 47 before I started taking lessons,

538
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:13.400
um,
it would have just sounded like five guys playing five different songs.

539
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:18.560
And then that Tony Williams was doing this Keith Moon Shit underneath it where

540
00:33:18.561 --> 00:33:21.830
he was just soloing or whatever.
And I was,

541
00:33:21.831 --> 00:33:25.940
when I first was listening to it,
I,
I only thing I could kind of,

542
00:33:25.941 --> 00:33:29.570
that was consistent was the baseline.
It was this baseline going,

543
00:33:29.571 --> 00:33:34.340
can I take a gun,
got Duh,
Duh,
Duh.
And I was just counting that and I'm going,

544
00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:37.850
okay,
it's since six,
it's in six and it's,

545
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.430
and I don't know what Tony's doing and it's,

546
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.620
she's playing 90 mils a million miles an hour.

547
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:46.190
But what's amazing about the song is in the middle of it,

548
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:51.500
Tony slows down and it's almost like he's like,
okay,
stupid.

549
00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.520
It's in four.
All right,
and here's where it is.

550
00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.110
Here's where beat two is in his word before is,
and then after,
then he don't,

551
00:33:59.111 --> 00:34:01.610
he does that for a couple of bars and he speeds up again,

552
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:07.340
it's like a drum class and it's like,
oh my God,
this guy's playing eighth notes.

553
00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:12.840
Okay.
Against what this guy's playing.
That sounds like it's said six,

554
00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:15.330
but it's really just almost like three against four.

555
00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.950
I know this is nerdy drum ship,

556
00:34:16.951 --> 00:34:19.770
but there's gotta be drum out there that understands it and then he's doing that

557
00:34:19.771 --> 00:34:21.150
metric modulation thing,

558
00:34:21.151 --> 00:34:25.200
which there wasn't even a fucking name for what he was doing to describe it with

559
00:34:25.201 --> 00:34:27.630
then as he's playing eighth notes.

560
00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:29.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

561
00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.390
<v 1>That the eighth note Senate,</v>

562
00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:34.710
he implies it that each one of those high head hits is the two and four and

563
00:34:34.711 --> 00:34:35.670
plays the jazz,

564
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:41.720
that thing they linkedin doing against that and then the e and the top become

565
00:34:41.721 --> 00:34:41.860
the,

566
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:46.860
the the fucking one and the three and he's playing that underneath all of this

567
00:34:47.011 --> 00:34:47.844
shit.

568
00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:52.650
So the rest of the band I guess is sort of playing in an implied six while he's

569
00:34:52.651 --> 00:34:56.010
playing for underneath that doing this metric modulation to the fore.

570
00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:02.030
But fucking blows my mind is that he's playing at that fucking level and it

571
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:03.990
roughly the same year,

572
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:09.500
I was joking with my teachers that that song by the Archie's sugar came out and

573
00:35:09.751 --> 00:35:11.070
was like a number one hit.

574
00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:17.450
He's doing that and you know they sell like one 90th of the fucking albums

575
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.660
that a song.
Ah,
sugar.

576
00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:25.780
Oh honey honey.

577
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:28.520
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

578
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.120
<v 1>You know,
I heard a story about that song that there's a keyboard solo,</v>

579
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.490
which I mean I don't know shit about music.

580
00:35:34.491 --> 00:35:38.220
I was consider a hacky when you take the soul,

581
00:35:38.221 --> 00:35:42.450
when you take a solo and all you do is just play the melody of the song.

582
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:48.300
So that was basically what the studio musician on keys was instructed to do.

583
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:53.070
So He's reading the sheet music and he was playing the solo to that song.

584
00:35:53.071 --> 00:35:57.570
And evidently he started laughing when he was playing it because it sounded like

585
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.040
like some five year old shit.
But of course that sells a zillion albums.

586
00:36:02.041 --> 00:36:06.420
Which brings me back to the Golden State Warriors.
Jay's is,

587
00:36:06.421 --> 00:36:10.680
I'm going a long way where people go,
yeah,
this is bad for basketball.

588
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.760
Why is it getting such high ratings?
I'll tell you why.

589
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.770
Because the Archie's outsell miles Davis.
There you go.
Go Fuck Yourself.

590
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:23.220
I'm done talking about the NBA.
So anyways,
I got a little sonar kit.

591
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:27.600
I'm so fucking excited to play and I can't wait.
I'm not going to have any time.

592
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.910
I won't have any fucking time to do it.

593
00:36:29.911 --> 00:36:34.440
But every once in a while hold daddy daycare,
you know my little princess,

594
00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.960
that's why I call him my little princess.
You know,
she's got the,
you know,

595
00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:40.380
babies have this little cute little fat hands.
Every morning I wake up,

596
00:36:40.381 --> 00:36:42.600
I put my index finger and in her hand,
you know,

597
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.610
they always squeeze it and then it bring us,

598
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.700
oh good morning princess and I kiss a little flu fat baby hand,

599
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.071
you know,

600
00:36:53.071 --> 00:36:56.040
and you wouldn't think that within 20 minutes of that I could get in my car and

601
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:59.250
have road rage.
But I do.
You would think at some point I could be like,

602
00:36:59.251 --> 00:37:03.260
you know what,
you know,
it doesn't get any better than that,
but you know,
I,

603
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:06.780
you know,
I ended up having these fucking problems.
Can it ever just,
sorry,

604
00:37:06.781 --> 00:37:09.900
just to deal with the recording here.
I'm on the road,
I'm on the road here.

605
00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:13.200
How to set it down here so I can type in my fucking password.
Yeah.

606
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.413
<v 4>MMM.</v>

607
00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:20.420
<v 1>But yes,
I am on a Tony Williams,</v>

608
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:26.490
like I disappeared down the rat hole.
Just it's,

609
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:30.790
it's over.
I am completely off there all of these years.

610
00:37:30.791 --> 00:37:32.470
Always loving him,
but not getting,
you know,

611
00:37:32.471 --> 00:37:35.380
I saw him live and I had no idea what the fuck he was doing.

612
00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:39.600
I just knew he was one of the greats and I went to go see him and he had,

613
00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:42.850
you know,
had the yellow Gretsch Kit.
I mean,
this was,

614
00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:48.120
we died 97 I probably saw him in like 92 93 91 somewhere in Boston.

615
00:37:50.471 --> 00:37:55.020
And,
uh,
I mean,
I was in a rough day,

616
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:56.610
they couldn't have been more than like a hundred people there.

617
00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.470
80 a hundred people,
little jazz place.

618
00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.130
<v 4>Okay.</v>

619
00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.590
<v 1>And I,
I told you this before and during the break I could,
I walked up and I,</v>

620
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:08.430
I was looking at his whole setup,
you know,

621
00:38:08.431 --> 00:38:12.210
we had the black dot heads,
the big like,
you know,

622
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:16.050
15 inch high hats and shit.
I saw everybody,
I told you,

623
00:38:16.051 --> 00:38:17.880
I've told you guys just before I saw Louie Bellson,

624
00:38:17.881 --> 00:38:21.540
he just stood there next to his kid and you went up and shook his hand.
Yeah,

625
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:23.170
<v 4>yeah,</v>

626
00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:28.130
<v 1>it was nuts.
It's fucking nuts.
Um,
by the way,
I did an episode of,</v>

627
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.770
of Jay Leno's show his car show,
which I didn't know if Jay Leno's garage.

628
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.370
I've always been a fan of the website,
but I did an episode of it.
Um,

629
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:37.900
I don't know when it's going to be coming out,

630
00:38:37.901 --> 00:38:42.040
but I don't know if this is gonna make the cut of,
um,

631
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:47.800
you know,
the final episode of it.
But,
um,
it was weird.

632
00:38:47.801 --> 00:38:50.590
I was going to be doing his show and I was reading all this Tony Williams,

633
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:55.100
miles Davis Shit.
And I learned about this jazz club,
um,

634
00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.900
in Peabody,
Massachusetts.
That's no longer there.

635
00:38:58.901 --> 00:39:00.820
It was called Lenny's on the turnpike.

636
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:04.390
It was this little hole in the wall and all these guys used to play there.

637
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:10.190
And um,
so then I be,
I don't know,

638
00:39:10.191 --> 00:39:13.580
I was reading about miles and it said he had a gig there.
Then I was like,

639
00:39:13.581 --> 00:39:15.920
Peabody,
Massachusetts,
Jesus Christ.
I know what that is.

640
00:39:15.921 --> 00:39:18.440
So then I started reading about the jazz club.
That's what it was.

641
00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.510
And then I found out that Jay Leno used to open for the,
you know,

642
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.550
it used to play there.
So then,
but holy shit,
I'm,
I'm working with him in a week.

643
00:39:25.551 --> 00:39:26.121
I've got to ask him.

644
00:39:26.121 --> 00:39:30.380
So I asked him about it and he talked about fucking opening from miles Davis

645
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:36.070
at Lenny's on the turnpike.
I said,
Holy Shit,
what was it like to meet that guy?

646
00:39:36.071 --> 00:39:39.220
He goes,
you know,
it goes a,

647
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:43.000
he was kind of distant and I go really?
And I think it was kind of,
you know,

648
00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.890
I mean,
the guy,
obviously he had a reputation for being a little bit moody,

649
00:39:47.891 --> 00:39:52.620
but he was also,
he said,
this is what he said he goes to do,

650
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.010
you got to understand this was,

651
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:58.060
it was Boston in the early seventies is bad as Boston is now.

652
00:39:58.061 --> 00:40:00.700
It was like a thousand times even more racist back then.

653
00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.850
And he was a black guy driving around in a Ferrari and you used to get pulled

654
00:40:03.851 --> 00:40:07.030
over like every five feet.
So he said,
Jay was saying that,
you know,

655
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:12.870
when a,
basically by the time he met Jay,
he was,

656
00:40:12.871 --> 00:40:14.460
he kinda had his fill of white people.

657
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:20.580
So anyways,
um,

658
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:24.930
so let me read some advertising here this week and if anybody else knows any

659
00:40:24.931 --> 00:40:25.920
like,
uh,

660
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:31.000
cool shit from that fucking error for me to listen to.
Um,

661
00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:37.770
I mean it just fascinates me how like jazz was like the main stream and then

662
00:40:37.771 --> 00:40:39.840
blues and R and B,
and then,
you know,

663
00:40:39.841 --> 00:40:44.250
white people turn it into rock and roll or whatever that that ended up taking

664
00:40:44.251 --> 00:40:46.470
over and it's just like,
yeah,

665
00:40:46.471 --> 00:40:49.830
what was gonna because it's the direction of jazz just kept growing and growing,

666
00:40:49.831 --> 00:40:53.220
growing to the point,
that shit that I was just explaining to you guys,

667
00:40:53.221 --> 00:40:56.040
it took me 30 years to understand what the fuck was going on.

668
00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.880
Just as a regular person,
you're going to lose the mainstream at that point,

669
00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.360
but you got to give it up to those guys for having the balls to just say,
yeah,

670
00:41:03.361 --> 00:41:05.290
well fuck it.
This is the direction we're going in.
Right?

671
00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:07.013
<v 6>MMM.</v>

672
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.560
<v 1>They have to be like the level that they were playing.</v>

673
00:41:10.561 --> 00:41:13.710
They had to know that half the fucking audience had no idea what was going on.

674
00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.380
Or you were just playing to a whole crowd full of musicians,
right?

675
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.910
I know I'm in way over my head.
Who the fuck am I?
Who am I?

676
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:23.730
Who am I to say I'm just a comedian.
Does a fucking podcast here.
All right,

677
00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.380
let's uh,
Jesus,
we've got a couple of reads here.
Um,

678
00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:31.290
all right.
Frame Bridge.
Everybody.

679
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:36.410
Mother's Day is right around the corner.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

680
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:42.010
This is how low on the totem pole men are.
There they are.

681
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:45.700
They're already advertising mother's Day.
So Ron,
the corner,

682
00:41:45.701 --> 00:41:49.980
it's fucking 11 months away.
I'm fucking with you.
You know,

683
00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.770
obviously what they did,
they forgot to put father's day in there.

684
00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.310
Who gives a shit?
It should dead.
Go get 'em get 'em a belt.

685
00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.620
Give him something else to beat you with.

686
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:03.110
Get us some strong Cologne.
So you know,
he's coming down the hall.

687
00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:07.190
You get a chance to fucking jump out the window.
All right.

688
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:10.400
Mother's Day is right around the corner in frame for father's Day is right

689
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:11.590
around the corner,
dammit,

690
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:16.170
and mother's Day makes it so easy to give a thoughtful gift that will last for

691
00:42:16.171 --> 00:42:16.850
years.

692
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:21.080
Order in minutes without ever leaving the house and they'll ship your custom

693
00:42:21.081 --> 00:42:25.120
gifts straight to your mom's door.
But the personalized gift don't.

694
00:42:25.121 --> 00:42:29.600
This is fucking hilarious.
Your Dad's door.

Do you know where to post your job to find the best candidate?

She a fucking dope.
Uh,

Oh,

You know,
you,

724
00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.520
you can shake a stick at a dope walking down the street,

725
00:44:17.521 --> 00:44:19.950
but can you find a talented one?
It's really difficult.

726
00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:24.570
You got to find that really great talented person to be successful at business.

727
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.510
Is that good?
Um,
how's Zip recruiter is different?

00:45:51.341 --> 00:45:54.310

I just yell.
All right,
legal zoom.
Last one.

748
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:57.990
In order to successfully run your own business,

749
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.510
attention to detail is so critical.

750
00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:06.380
One contract slip up or legal misunderstanding can really set you back.

751
00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:11.010
What do you mean we're broke?
Fortunately,
there's legal zone.

752
00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:15.180
You may already know that over half a million,
over a million,
sorry.

753
00:46:15.181 --> 00:46:20.130
Americans have used legal zoom to start their own business by legal zoom

754
00:46:20.131 --> 00:46:24.990
services go well beyond business formation.
It'll help you hide a body.

755
00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:29.310
They built a nationwide network of independent attorneys who can provide legal

756
00:46:29.311 --> 00:46:32.790
answers to the day to day questions you have about your business.

757
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.480
Because let's face it,
things like trademarks,

758
00:46:36.481 --> 00:46:40.530
employer employment laws and lease agreements can get pretty complicated.

759
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.830
That's such a nice way of saying,
let's face it,
you're a fucking dope.

760
00:46:43.831 --> 00:46:46.830
You don't want to deal with this.
You know what I am and I'm proud of it.

761
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.490
So don't waste your valuable time trying to wrap your head around all the fine

762
00:46:50.491 --> 00:46:54.180
print.
That's true.
All successful people,
you know what they do?
They delegate,

763
00:46:54.181 --> 00:46:57.150
they delegate,
they delegate.
I'm not good at this shit.

764
00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:01.230
Hey Yo Myron with the glasses.
You're good with numbers,
aren't ya?

765
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:05.360
Of course you are.
Here's a pencil.
Figure this shit out.
Um,

766
00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.490
so don't waste your valuable time trying to wrap your head around all the fine

767
00:47:08.491 --> 00:47:12.990
print.

772
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.190
mercifully my reading out loud is over.
You know,

773
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:35.250
last week I might have somehow doing an hour on having such a good fucking time

774
00:47:35.261 --> 00:47:39.310
here.
All right,
well I got to read this thing and then I'm out of here.
All right.

775
00:47:39.311 --> 00:47:42.160
Last week are Monday,
I should say.
I read this,

776
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.760
we had the heading to an email question and we did not have the email.

777
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:51.220
Andrew feminist apologizes profusely and I had to stop him from committee.

778
00:47:51.221 --> 00:47:56.020
Harry Carey.
Alright,
lady needing advice.
Don't want to go to males.

779
00:47:56.021 --> 00:47:57.910
Friends wedding.
Hey Bill,

780
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:03.120
I really enjoy the advice portion of your podcasts and could use an objective

781
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:04.414
opinion.

782
00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:09.450
I am a lady and have a male friend that I've been friends with since I was 10

783
00:48:12.431 --> 00:48:15.340
years old.
I'm now 29

784
00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.660
you know what guys,
I got to apologize something.
I have this great bit,

785
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.690
I can't wait to try out tomorrow night.

786
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:27.550
And I literally was thinking about the joke I wanted to do and how far I was

787
00:48:27.551 --> 00:48:29.170
going to take it while I read all of that.

788
00:48:29.171 --> 00:48:30.970
So I have no idea what's going on this email.

789
00:48:30.971 --> 00:48:35.200
If just please forgive me as I reread this.
Uh,

790
00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.130
I am a lady and have a male friend that I'd been friends with.

791
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:40.270
What you just said you were friends.

792
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.480
I have a male friend that had been enemies with,

793
00:48:43.481 --> 00:48:46.180
I have a male friend that I'd been friends with since I was 10 years old.

794
00:48:46.181 --> 00:48:50.600
I'm 29 now cause you've been friends with this guy for 19 years,
you know?
Geez.

795
00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:54.760
Did the fingerprinting you pick in the seventh grade by friend is with this girl

796
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:59.470
that I've never warmed up to.
She's a bit now wait a minute.

797
00:48:59.471 --> 00:49:03.070
Did you always think he was going to ask you?
Is that what it is?

798
00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:05.170
Maybe they're not built.
Why don't you just read the fucking thing?

799
00:49:05.171 --> 00:49:08.830
She's a bit condescending,
phony and I just don't like her.
He's,

800
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.130
he's in his early thirties.
She's 25.
Ah,

801
00:49:12.131 --> 00:49:16.240
so she's got you on the older dominator there and they both currently live with

802
00:49:16.241 --> 00:49:20.980
his mom who also happens to be a good friend of mine.
They have crappy jobs,

803
00:49:20.981 --> 00:49:23.680
don't pay as mom rent or contribute much,

804
00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:28.980
but instead they're putting money back to have a wedding by the end of the year.

805
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:31.600
I love my friend,

806
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:36.190
but he's always been a bit immature when it comes to money responsibilities.

807
00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.290
Why are you still hanging out with these people?

808
00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:44.470
These people sound like fucking losers.
Walk away.

809
00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.610
Be Thankful you didn't hit your wagon to this shit.
I can tell you right now,

810
00:49:48.611 --> 00:49:51.560
if you are with this guy and you were living in his mom's house,

811
00:49:51.561 --> 00:49:53.710
she would not be friends with his mom anymore.
You'd be like,

812
00:49:53.711 --> 00:49:56.500
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
Anyways.
They,
they're not,

813
00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:57.760
they're immature when it comes to money,

814
00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:59.950
responsibility or what it takes to be an adult.

815
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:04.450
He's still depends on his mom a lot.
He's 32.

816
00:50:04.451 --> 00:50:08.530
This is pathetic.
I don't hear a dad in this scenario here.

817
00:50:08.531 --> 00:50:12.340
We did not have a dad and he didn't learn how to be a ma.
Uh,
be a man,

818
00:50:12.341 --> 00:50:15.490
I should say a mom.
Uh,
when my grandmother recently died,

819
00:50:15.491 --> 00:50:18.670
I was devastated and he asked me for my,
my address.

820
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.990
I thought I would get a sympathy card,
but instead I got a save the date card.

821
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:29.480
Oh my God.
That's sad and fucking hilarious.

822
00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:34.720
It pisses me off that he's a bit of a selfish prick in his own world and also a

823
00:50:34.821 --> 00:50:39.260
dumb ass for being in such a rush to get married when neither one of them has

824
00:50:39.261 --> 00:50:41.240
their shit together.
It's difficult

825
00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.850
<v 7>me</v>

826
00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:48.180
<v 1>to be supportive before you assume I'm secretly in love with him,</v>

827
00:50:48.221 --> 00:50:49.690
which I did.
I'm sorry.

828
00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:54.700
Our friendship has been nothing but platonic and I recently got married myself.

829
00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:58.240
I'm sorry,
but this whole thing read like when Harry met Sally,

830
00:50:59.110 --> 00:51:02.110
except Perry never moved out.
Um,
I don't want to get,

831
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:04.330
I don't want to go to their wedding.
My question is,

832
00:51:04.331 --> 00:51:08.640
do you think I should put my show side and try to be supportive of my friends

833
00:51:08.641 --> 00:51:09.610
since he's happy?

834
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:13.660
I feel as though our friendship has shifted a ton since he's been with this girl

835
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:17.650
and it's no longer easy talking to him.
This is what she'd do.

836
00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.400
You go to the wedding and then you just gradually back away,

837
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:24.950
you've outgrown these people.
Okay.
That said,
you're married,

838
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:28.510
you have your own fucking life.
If he wants to live at home with his mother,

839
00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:31.960
with his new wife,
and whatever the fuck it is is going to do,

840
00:51:31.961 --> 00:51:35.800
you just go there and just having nice smile on your face.

841
00:51:35.801 --> 00:51:39.760
Just being happy that you're not the on the other side of the I do.
Okay.

842
00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:41.830
I'm still not a hundred percent

843
00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:44.643
<v 4>mmm.</v>

844
00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:50.200
<v 1>Buying the fact that you don't have some sort of feelings for this kid who's now</v>

845
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:53.630
still acting like a kid in his thirties.
You're 29.
He's 32.

846
00:51:53.631 --> 00:51:56.140
He was three years old or you probably said this is perfect.

847
00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.280
Then you envision him wearing a suit and coming home,

848
00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:02.620
bringing like Hugh Beaumont and the beginning of leave it to beaver with a

849
00:52:02.621 --> 00:52:07.060
higher end fucking GM product,
Oldsmobile,

850
00:52:07.061 --> 00:52:09.160
possibly a Buick.
Who knows?

851
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:10.833
<v 4>MMM.</v>

852
00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:15.630
<v 1>I Dunno.
Uh,
but this is what I would do.
You've got to let it go.</v>

853
00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:19.950
It wasn't meant to be in k.
And even if you don't have romantic,

854
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:25.600
um,
feelings for this person,
all right?

855
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:27.730
If you don't have feelings for this fucking person,

856
00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:31.570
I can already tell you the fact that it's so driving you nuts that you had to

857
00:52:31.571 --> 00:52:35.600
write into some dope like me doing a podcast.
Um,

858
00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:37.690
I dunno the way,
the way this is all written,

859
00:52:37.691 --> 00:52:40.660
I think you wear your feelings on your sleeve and they're going to know what's

860
00:52:40.661 --> 00:52:44.440
up.
I would go there,
you know,
smile,
a wave.
That's it.

861
00:52:44.441 --> 00:52:48.520
And then I would not torture your husband on the way home or the whole night

862
00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.950
critiquing them about how fucking stupid it is,

863
00:52:50.951 --> 00:52:52.210
because they can tell you this right now.

864
00:52:52.211 --> 00:52:55.600
Your husband doesn't want to fucking go.
So it's,
you should go,

865
00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:59.170
you should do is you should go there and you should have a great fucking time

866
00:52:59.171 --> 00:53:02.920
with your husband and he should thank him for not being a fucking loser that

867
00:53:02.921 --> 00:53:07.000
lives at home with his mom.
They go,
all right.
And then go to frame bridge.

868
00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:11.560
Take a picture.
You had tits and give it to them on Sunday.
That's the podcast.

869
00:53:11.561 --> 00:53:12.394
Everybody.

870
00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.820
God bless all of you.

871
00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:23.950
God bless America had a that said,
get off the Internet.

872
00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:26.850
Go sit on the stoop.
Go make some music with your friends.

873
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:31.860
Stop taking life so fucking seriously,
uh,
stay away from credit cards.

874
00:53:31.861 --> 00:53:33.670
Stay away from the meth.
Uh,

875
00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:37.050
your doctor prescribes any painkillers that has any opiates in it.

876
00:53:37.051 --> 00:53:40.950
Do not take them.
Tough it out.
Just watch.
There will be blood.

877
00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:43.560
Did she sit there on the couch or her?
Toughing it out.

878
00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:46.620
Fucking guy dragged himself out of the fucking Wiley.

879
00:53:46.621 --> 00:53:50.700
Coyote mine with a broken leg that go in town just to get a fucking gold nickel.

880
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:54.840
All right,
you could do it.
All right.
That's the podcast.
Have a great weekend.

881
00:53:54.841 --> 00:53:56.400
You're constant.
I'll talk to you on Monday.

882
00:53:58.350 --> 00:53:59.183
<v 8>Okay.</v>

883
00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:37.903
All

884
00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:43.540
right.

885
00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:47.230
<v 9>Overrated.
Uh,
relationships.
Uh,
do I really want to read this one with you?</v>

886
00:54:47.231 --> 00:54:48.064
Who's here?

887
00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.840
Can you come near the microphone to be a frigging professional?

888
00:54:52.841 --> 00:54:55.240
When this unprofessional show,
you're just sitting.

889
00:54:55.241 --> 00:54:59.890
Why are you wearing moccasins?
They're my slippers.

890
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.190
Their moccasins,
moccasins,
slippers.

891
00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:03.750
<v 1>Ooh.</v>

892
00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:07.230
<v 9>Hi.
Ya,
Ya,
Ya,
Ya,
you got a little Indian blood in your w hey,</v>

893
00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:12.040
you should do I have like one.
Let me you,
what do you get?
Black feet?
Yeah,

894
00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:16.790
you get it.
Nothing.

895
00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:21.500
I get nothing on that.
That was stupid.
You know what,
what?

896
00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:26.000
Go Fuck Yourself.
Here we go,
uh,
relationships.
So,
uh,

897
00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:28.880
sure that can be good.
But are they ever great?

898
00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.970
Every married guy I know reminisces about his days as a single man.

899
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:38.570
Married guys worn single guys not to get into relationships.

900
00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:42.830
They weren't guys with girlfriends to never under any circumstances get married.

901
00:55:42.831 --> 00:55:46.010
This is all true.
When you're single,
you can do whatever the fuck you want.

902
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:49.400
Whatever you want without first,
uh,
wait a minute.

903
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:53.450
Let me get this closer without first filtering your decisions through the

904
00:55:53.451 --> 00:55:57.170
desires of a chick who probably doesn't even know what she wants most of the

905
00:55:57.171 --> 00:56:01.280
time and is motivated by the worldview of sex and the city.
Wow.

906
00:56:01.281 --> 00:56:05.090
This person sounds like a real prize.
Yeah,
but this is true though.

907
00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:08.240
This is an all women.
A lot of women are fucking idiots.
Just like guys,

908
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:10.910
what'd you say?
Most guys are fucking idiots.
I would actually,

909
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:15.830
and aren't most women,
aren't most people fucking idiots.
Listen,

910
00:56:15.831 --> 00:56:17.840
we're all rapists,
but when we talk,

911
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:23.290
all I know is that no one is Annrai bubble.
Okay?
Okay.

912
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:26.230
And I am as exotic is a grilled cheese sandwich.

913
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.360
I think that might be an instant classic.
Um,

914
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:34.270
there wasn't even tomato in that sandwich was there.
Um,

915
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:37.930
even when the chicks get a what they think they want,
they,

916
00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.410
they're usually still miserable.
That's how stupid most of them are.

917
00:56:41.411 --> 00:56:45.190
All right now.
Yeah.
Now he's sneaky.
This haze in my school,
he's in my quad.

918
00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:49.930
I liked this guy.
Uh,
you're never going to make them happy.
So why even try,
uh,

919
00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.750
not being constrained by a relationship was one of the greatest things of all

920
00:56:52.751 --> 00:56:56.530
time.
It's a man's world.
Uh,
women need more.

921
00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:59.920
Women need men more than men need women.

922
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:03.750
Most men can thrive alone.
Most women can't.
He's young.

923
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:07.330
He can tell these young he hasn't,
he hasn't like women are still looking at him.

924
00:57:07.331 --> 00:57:11.770
He's a fucking idiot,
is what he is.
No,
he is.
And he's learning.
I was this guy.

925
00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:15.400
Then you realize at some point you're old and women don't care anymore,

926
00:57:15.401 --> 00:57:19.780
so you've got to grab one on.
Just hang onto them,
drag them down with you.
Um,

927
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:25.080
most women can't ask any honest bisexual girl and she'll like you tell you that

928
00:57:25.301 --> 00:57:28.120
she wants to end up with a man.
Jesus,

929
00:57:28.121 --> 00:57:30.730
this guy just keeps every time I think he's gone as far as he's going to go,

930
00:57:30.731 --> 00:57:34.750
he keeps going.
I love him.
Uh,
enjoy being single.

931
00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:37.150
Unless you're a total fucking failure of a man,

932
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:40.360
you almost always be able to get a girlfriend if you're really want one,

933
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.390
realize yeah,
if you're past a certain age,
dude,

934
00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.670
there's a certain amount of money you have to be making,
uh,

935
00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:49.010
for that to continue to happen.
And this is,

936
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:54.040
there's a fucking sadness to that life that I can't even begin to describe a,

937
00:57:54.491 --> 00:57:58.210
realize what a blessing your freedom is and never allowed desperation to put you

938
00:57:58.211 --> 00:58:00.310
in chains.
He's making some good points here.

939
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:05.050
He definitely has some issues with women,
some issues he's,

940
00:58:05.051 --> 00:58:09.730
but he does a lot of truth in that.
Nia,
they're all dying alone.
Asshole.
Hey,
hey,

941
00:58:09.731 --> 00:58:12.190
hey.
Well,
listen,
what this,
well,

942
00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:16.330
basically what you just said was that you're a dumb girl because that's what he

943
00:58:16.331 --> 00:58:20.560
was attacking.
What do you mean it's your world?
It's your world.
Ah,

944
00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:23.830
we were almost out without an argument,
but why am I dumb?

945
00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:27.220
Because he's attacking women whose worldview comes from sex in the city.

946
00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.520
So somehow you got offended by that.
First of all,

947
00:58:30.521 --> 00:58:33.640
he's not just attacking women whose worldview is sex and saying,
oh,

948
00:58:33.641 --> 00:58:37.840
I think he is.
He's attacking all women.
Look at,
Oh,
I know.

949
00:58:37.841 --> 00:58:42.520
He was just being some women was just being silly.
Being silly.
Oh,

950
00:58:42.521 --> 00:58:45.700
you're right,
you're right.
Look,
you know,

951
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:50.710
you know his mother never hugged him.
He's got issues.
He's not our fault.

952
00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:54.490
What do you,
don't,
don't drag me into this.
I relate to this guy are as women,

953
00:58:54.491 --> 00:58:57.310
I'm speaking as women.
Why don't you just speak for yourself?

954
00:58:57.311 --> 00:59:01.360
You fucking delusional.
Jackass.
Who elected you?
You did.
I'm sitting there,

955
00:59:01.361 --> 00:59:03.960
aren't I?
You know,
I didn't say to represent all women.

956
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:07.550
I'm not representing all women's,
but I think I can say with with,

957
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:12.870
with underwears clarity that most smart women who see this would be like,

958
00:59:13.751 --> 00:59:16.000
go fuck yourself.
You do.
All right,
well I'll,

959
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:19.270
can I just make a comment about the whole married versus unmarried thing?

960
00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:21.590
The grass is always greener on the other side.

961
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.450
Single people who are alone look at couples and I,

962
00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:27.680
they get a little twinge of like,
oh that's nice.

963
00:59:27.681 --> 00:59:31.430
I wish I had somebody to come home to at night that has my back.
No matter what.

964
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:34.310
That's what you're missing.
You shortsighted moron,

965
00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:38.030
is that you've got somebody who's there with you who's going to take care of
you,

966
00:59:38.031 --> 00:59:41.300
who's going to love you and protects you and have your back.

967
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:45.020
It's not just about like just to be with someone.

968
00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:48.320
We got it.
Listen,

969
00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:52.690
how do you hold on to this person and the way that I want to do,
cause you're,

970
00:59:52.691 --> 00:59:56.960
you're being mean.
This podcast,
this podcast email is ridiculous.

971
00:59:56.961 --> 01:00:01.310
Guys crying out for help,
whatever.

972
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:02.300
Fine go on.

973
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:06.230
This podcast is not about being mean and taking shots of people who can't defend

974
01:00:06.231 --> 01:00:08.970
themselves.
That's exactly what it was.

975
01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:14.720
Took you long enough to figure that out.
Um,
all right.
No,
but there's,
there's,

976
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:18.500
there's a great truth in what he's saying here is a lot of people just jumping

977
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:20.510
relationship,
jumping in,
relationship jumping relationship,

978
01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:25.670
and it's like relationships a fucking difficult.
Yes.
Okay,

979
01:00:25.671 --> 01:00:28.940
so you better pick the right person or you're going to be fucking miserable.

980
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:33.060
So you are better off to be single and lonely rather than,

981
01:00:33.061 --> 01:00:36.220
than just being in some shit to just be in some shit.

982
01:00:36.221 --> 01:00:38.180
So he got somebody to fucking make brownies with.

983
01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:41.620
That's what he was trying to say.
All right,
true.
But he didn't say that.

984
01:00:41.621 --> 01:00:45.280
He ended up saying that most cigs are going to be miserable anyway,

985
01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.980
and they all have the stupid worldview.
That's true.

986
01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.280
Most women aren't going to be miserable and they're never going to be fucking

987
01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:53.830
happy.
Okay.
You basing this on,
you know,
something,

988
01:00:53.831 --> 01:00:57.280
you guys always say a good man is hard to find.
That works both fucking ways.

989
01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:59.620
I understand.
Well then that's,
this is what bell wealth.

990
01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.740
This motherfucker hasn't found the one yet.
So he's going to,
he's going,

991
01:01:02.741 --> 01:01:06.670
he's dating a bunch of lashing out at everybody because he can't seem to figure

992
01:01:06.671 --> 01:01:09.520
out how to make a relationship work and he can't find the value in the

993
01:01:09.521 --> 01:01:12.970
relationship.
So automatically it's not valuable.
First of all,

994
01:01:12.971 --> 01:01:14.800
the hype person lashing out as you right now,

995
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.510
you lost your temper is a guy here.
He,
he writes in,

996
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:23.350
he's looking for a little bit of Goddamn guidance.
He wants somebody to advice.

997
01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:25.750
He got it.
He's fucking hilarious.

998
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:27.603
<v 8>MMM.</v>

999
01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:07.750
Underrated.
Great it

1000
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:11.320
<v 9>over it,
under it for this week.
Uh,
overrated fucking voicemail,</v>

1001
01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.610
leaving them as the most awkward thing.

1002
01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:17.780
I've always said that I'm terrible at leaving them,
but whenever I say that,

1003
01:02:17.781 --> 01:02:21.630
everyone else,
whenever I say that,
everyone else always says it too.

1004
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:24.990
So I'm putting my foot down on the issue and calling it right now,

1005
01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:27.600
leaving a message for someone on the phone sucks.

1006
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:31.560
There's no way to start your message normally without sounding like a Douche.

1007
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:34.710
And then five minutes later you realize you've been trailing on and on while

1008
01:02:34.711 --> 01:02:38.970
saying,
ah,
um,
too many times making you want to kill yourself,

1009
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:41.910
ending with the inevitable a.
Okay,
thanks.

1010
01:02:41.911 --> 01:02:46.680
By reminding them that you're still a Douche.
Fucking awful dude.

1011
01:02:46.681 --> 01:02:50.610
This is something that's really like an epidemic in this young generation is

1012
01:02:50.611 --> 01:02:54.030
everybody just feeling awkward and feeling like a Douche.

1013
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:59.010
I Dunno what happened to you guys.
I think this last generation of fathers,

1014
01:02:59.011 --> 01:03:01.740
they flipped.
Like,
I'm not going to beat the shit out of my kid,

1015
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:07.020
not hug them and never tell him that I,
that I,
that I love him.
Uh,
you know,

1016
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:10.080
I'm going to do all of that shit and you end up with these people who can't even

1017
01:03:10.081 --> 01:03:12.480
fucking leave voicemails.

1018
01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:14.350
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1019
01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:16.770
<v 9>What is so awkward,
you know?</v>

1020
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:19.710
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1021
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:22.330
<v 9>I,
I,
you know what?
I have a hard time getting off the phone.
I forget.</v>

1022
01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.920
I forget what I used to say.

1023
01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1024
01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.190
<v 9>But I don't feel awkward.</v>

1025
01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:27.930
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1026
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:30.150
<v 9>Well,
I just feel like an idiot,
I guess.
So I guess I kind of relate.</v>

1027
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:31.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1028
01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:33.540
<v 9>I just go.
All right.
That's it.
I'm Outta here.</v>

1029
01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:41.190
I will say that believe in a message.
I like leaving messages.

1030
01:03:41.191 --> 01:03:44.940
I sing on people's voicemails,
you know,

1031
01:03:44.941 --> 01:03:48.600
whenever I call up fucking Blob,
Yay.
Bobby Kelly,

1032
01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:54.480
or in fucking Joey roses.
I call him up and I,

1033
01:03:54.481 --> 01:03:56.790
I'll just immediately,
I'll just,
whatever comes to my mind,

1034
01:03:56.791 --> 01:04:01.170
I'll just start singing.
Who's the con to that?
I love the most.

1035
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.030
Who's that fucker?
Who eats the toasts ditch?
Joey,

1036
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:11.220
he's such a big FHEG.
Derosa what's going on?

1037
01:04:11.221 --> 01:04:15.570
It's bill.
Give me a call back.
You can't click.
That's it.

1038
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:18.900
Why don't you try singing?
You can do it for anybody.

1039
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:25.260
Hey Mom,
what's up you sweetie?
Thanks for having me.

1040
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:29.850
40 years ago I sent you some flowers.

1041
01:04:29.851 --> 01:04:31.170
You didn't call me.

1042
01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:35.490
Do you like my siblings better than me?

1043
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:39.630
Click right?
Why don't you do that?
Try that search.

1044
01:04:39.631 --> 01:04:43.350
Try singing first.
Um,
all right.
Underrated.
Overrated.
Underrated.

1045
01:04:43.351 --> 01:04:47.210
Sitting Down to pee.
If you're a guy.
Uh,

1046
01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:52.493
<v 10>yeah.</v>

1047
01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.260
<v 9>Is it that,
how old are you?
Is it that hard to stand up?</v>

1048
01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:02.240
What is wrong with this fucking generation of guys?
You know,

1049
01:05:02.241 --> 01:05:03.410
sit down to pee.

1050
01:05:03.411 --> 01:05:07.250
It's actually easier and you don't get varicose veins from all those years.

1051
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:10.730
There's nothing better than just pulling out your Dick.

1052
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:15.560
It just fucking pee and all over everything.
You know,

1053
01:05:15.561 --> 01:05:20.250
he's fucking shooting the toilet paper around.
It's fucking good time.
Um,

1054
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:24.190
anyways,
it says the guy who drives a fucking hybrid.
Um,
anyways,

1055
01:05:24.191 --> 01:05:27.030
there are many benefits to being a guy in sitting down to peace,

1056
01:05:27.031 --> 01:05:31.360
such as not having to hear your chick complain about peeing on the seat,

1057
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:36.390
even though it's on the fucking top of the bowl and it's not actually the seat.

1058
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.780
Yup.
Here's a guy,
he's,

1059
01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:44.450
he's literally sitting down to pee,
so his girlfriend will stop.
Yeah,

1060
01:05:44.451 --> 01:05:48.710
we got him.
Okay.
I don't know what happened.

1061
01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:51.280
People a hundred years ago,

1062
01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:54.130
we could hit him with mop handles and I don't know what happened.

1063
01:05:54.131 --> 01:05:55.630
They got organized and we didn't,

1064
01:05:55.631 --> 01:05:59.590
and now we're sitting down to pee just so they'll stop yelling at us.

1065
01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:02.530
Um,
all right,
number two,
if you like me,

1066
01:06:02.531 --> 01:06:04.870
if you're like me and you wake up to pee at night,

1067
01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:09.190
you don't have to fuck with your eyes and turn on the bathroom lights to aim.

1068
01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.400
Oh Dude,
you take it all the fun out of it.

1069
01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:17.290
That's how you train your ear.
All right,

1070
01:06:17.291 --> 01:06:19.840
that sounds like the back of the bowl.

1071
01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.730
Where's the water?
That's the floor.
There it is.

1072
01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:29.140
One small step.
Um,
number three,

1073
01:06:29.141 --> 01:06:32.110
not bending down to lift up the seat out.
You know what dude?

1074
01:06:32.111 --> 01:06:33.430
You're a fucking pansy.

1075
01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:37.900
Not Bending down to clean off to see less bending in general.

1076
01:06:37.901 --> 01:06:41.170
Why don't you just bend over and suck your own Dick is just sit on the bowl.

1077
01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:45.910
You fucking Douche.
Fuck that guy peeing.
Sitting down.

1078
01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:50.530
You know
what else sir?
What?
What else is overrated?

1079
01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.350
Lifting weights.
Um,

1080
01:06:55.870 --> 01:07:00.160
owning a gun.
Chewing tobacco.
Eating steak.
What else?

1081
01:07:00.161 --> 01:07:04.990
Drinking Scotch.
Smoking cigars.
Fixing your own car.

1082
01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.240
What else?
Or what else is fucking overrated?

1083
01:07:07.241 --> 01:07:10.840
Everything that makes being a guy fucking awesome.
Losing your shit.

1084
01:07:10.841 --> 01:07:15.340
Because some guy you don't know Mr. Field goal that really has no effect on your

1085
01:07:15.341 --> 01:07:19.570
life talking shit.
Is that all overrated,
Lee Marvin?

1086
01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:25.100
Yeah.
The only thing that saved you surge,
you didn't leave your name.
So that,

1087
01:07:25.101 --> 01:07:28.230
that's the only thing that I can say is I can at least see that there was sort

1088
01:07:28.231 --> 01:07:30.180
of some,
some sort of shame

1089
01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:12.320
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

1090
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:15.700
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:24.550
