19
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.000

<v 3>Jesus Christ I like practice nine thousand things get better at nothing.</v>

<v 6>That's how I practice a let's do double bass for two minutes.</v>

23
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.180

24
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.090
<v 7>Let's do the jazz right.</v>

25
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.600
I was talking to some born triplets right.

26
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.840
<v 6>Just kept going and going.
But you know what.
I didn't sound that bad.</v>

27
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.780
I had a good time.
I fucking love that kid though.
I had a small setup.

28
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.900
You guys gave me shit cause I had fucking three floor times legos.

29
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.690
<v 8>Would you do it will bore you for good reason.
You fucking to pay.</v>

30
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.940
<v 3>I don't own a toupee.
All right.
You can own a toupee.</v>

31
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.440
It just let you know what I mean.
I've thought.

32
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.170
I bet they make them really good right now.

33
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.380
But it would just be like wearing this fucking hat.
You could never take off.

34
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.270
<v 2>You know you wake up in the morning and you get your little roller.</v>

35
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.420
You know what the glue.
You know you just fucking go on over your scalp.

36
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.710
You know you're doing that your wife comes walking in.
I mean Jesus Christ.

37
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.960
I mean she's gonna be bangin another guy within three days.

38
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.010
<v 5>If you're a fucking woman walks in while you're gluing hair to the top of your</v>

39
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:32.700
head all right.
And she doesn't leave you.
That woman is a saint.

40
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.223
You know what I mean.

41
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.080
<v 9>I love the guys who have like the fucking the toupee and then they can't even</v>

42
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:44.580
get like the like the decides to match it.

43
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.500
<v 0>You don't know me.
It's like dude are you fucking colorblind.</v>

44
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.870
Do you really think that that that's blending into what you got on the sides.

45
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.960
<v 5>You know it's funny to us when you go down the toupee road</v>

46
00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.680
they don't.

47
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.480
<v 10>I don't know.
As far as I know they don't make any white ones.</v>

48
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.350
Like if you're an older guy so then you gotta dye the shit you got on the side.

49
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.620
All right.

50
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.250
So then it just makes people look at your head like you just like this guy's

51
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.600
like 60.
How does he have Jet Blue now.
Good Lord look at that fucking thing.

52
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.720
<v 11>JJ</v>

53
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.960
You know I don't like about toupees.

54
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.070
<v 12>Actually hair plugs now is they're too good now.</v>

55
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.110
Used to be it used to be able to tell.

56
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.220
<v 6>And you could really fuck somebody up and conversation going to do.</v>

57
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.420
I don't give a fuck how smart they were to do it.

58
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.110
Just kind of look up at it and then look back at him and then they were just

59
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:43.111
fucked for the rest of the conversation and those days are gone now because they

60
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:44.800
got to god damn good at it.

61
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.120
<v 5>So anyways I was playing you know playing all the drums shit and at this point</v>

62
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.520
because my drum teacher is out on the road I haven't been taking any lessons you

63
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:00.430

64
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.760
opening for Dave.

65
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.450
Now that I said Dave Matthews No John Mayer.

66
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.250
<v 6>Opening for John Mayer was Steve Jordan on drums.
Jesus Christ.</v>

67
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.300
<v 12>You get to see David Lynch and then you get to see Steve Jordan how about that.</v>

68
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.880
It there's a fucking evening for you know

69
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.340
that be enough forget God damn millennials.
Yeah.

70
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.810
<v 0>So I haven't been taken lessons but so I just it's actually kind of been a good</v>

71
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:32.900
thing because I can go back to all the shit that I never fucking got down that

72
00:04:32.901 --> 00:04:36.990
he showed me while developing new bad habits.

73
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.340
But I know can.
Anyways I'm having a great time.

74
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.430
So people give me shit cause I got the three floor times but this is why I did

75
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:46.710
it.
This was the method to my madness.

76
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.900
All right I got 12 inch racked and I got a 14 16 18 floor top so and then a

77
00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:52.770
twenty two kick.

78
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.480
<v 9>Right.
So</v>

79
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.370
I hate having to rack times but I ended up ordering another one so I got to

80
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:03.980
twelve I got thirteen come in so now I can go bigger small people bigger smaller

81
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I need to go 12 14 16 or 13 16 18 depending on whatever the fuck and whatever

82
00:05:10.051 --> 00:05:13.740
song I'm going to go butcher on the god damn comedy chair all right.

83
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.570
Why can't I just have a hobby.

84
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.780
Without people criticizing it why can't people just say Hey nice drum kit that

85
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.790
dude what do you going to do.

86
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.850
<v 13>Fucking Floyd talk for a guy just to give.</v>

87
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.820
<v 5>Jesus I don't know</v>

88
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.000
I'm trying to get out of fucking the bottom

89
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.060

<v 14>I went on for fucking 30 years I'm just trying a different setup.</v>

91
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.540
That's all I was doing.
Get more goddamn shit for that.

92
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.900
That and saying new killer instead of new clear.

93
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.270

94
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.190

You know it's not new killer it's nuclear.

95
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.550
I've always said no killer

96
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.180
always said it it sounds right to me rolls off the tongue a little bit easier

97
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:09.010
than nuclear.
It's a nuclear weapon not nuclear.

98
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.460
Laughing my ass off.

143
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.490
But you know what the thrill is the real reason people they're not doing it for

144
00:08:57.491 --> 00:09:01.960
me.
They're doing it for them to show how smart they are.

145
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.040
<v 1>Oh it's not total.
It's Turtle.</v>

146
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.500
Laughing my ass off.
I know how to say that fucking amphibians name.

147
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.590
Oh actually it's not even a fit.
We are stopping.

148
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.430
<v 20>It's not an amphibious amphibian his humility.</v>

149
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.500
<v 9>SHUT THE FUCK</v>

150
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.630

151
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.823
<v 21>Is that what it is.</v>

152
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.780
<v 17>That's like the smart way a person plays the lottery I guess right.</v>

153
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.230
The lottery you just could be a dope like me.
Go on.

154
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.070
<v 1>Don't you see that nucular weapon.</v>

155
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.960
And then you go and let me get a fuckin set for life right.

156
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.510
<v 10>That's how I try to make it okay.</v>

157
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:46.950

159
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.580

160
00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.220

No it isn't right.

161
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.010
It's like yes the letters it looks like a crossword but it is.

162
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.850
<v 22>But I just love that you will be smart enough to do the New York Times crossword</v>

163
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:10.190
puzzle and then still you're going to get on there right and you've got to spin

164
00:10:10.191 --> 00:10:14.640
a wheel
and spin that wheel.

165
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.930
<v 6>There's no intelligence.
You just spin it.</v>

166
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.020
You can be the smartest person on the world and you're going to roll loser turn.

167
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.540
<v 23>Bankrupt and it's fucking over.</v>

168
00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:32.290
<v 12>I like watching Jeopardy when you know there's somebody just you just can't</v>

169
00:10:32.291 --> 00:10:36.340
defeat this guy and all these other smarty pants get on there and their whole

170
00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:39.680
life.
They were the fuckin smartest one you know.

171
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.560
<v 17>You know those people that don't like drink</v>

172
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.310
and they'd like they play board games like let's play Trivial Pursuit.

173
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.540
You know what I mean.

174
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.060
Let's let's play whatever those fucking games I have to tell you

175
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:57.350
some of the saddest moments in my adult life as I've gone to parties and all of

176
00:10:57.351 --> 00:11:01.020
a sudden a breakout board games and

177
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.960
you ever see like when somebody is on hidden video and they start looking around

178
00:11:05.961 --> 00:11:09.140
like What the fuck and the crowd starts laugh like that's the look on my face

179
00:11:09.141 --> 00:11:11.390
like that and then I'm going to do this.

180
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.370
<v 5>They're not doing this other does this everybody have to play.</v>

181
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.370
I don't wanna do this.
I don't wanna fucking do one of my five year old

182
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.720
you know are we trapped in a fucking cabin and then there is no television.

183
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.130
<v 12>No.
This is crude.
You can connect pretty I'll play some cards.</v>

184
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.620
You know I like how cards is like the only other cards it's just like there's a

185
00:11:33.621 --> 00:11:38.300
sleazy vibe to cards that I've always enjoyed even though I don't play a lot of

186
00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:38.690
cards.

187
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.290
But you know even like those fucking old ladies seen some old lady with their

188
00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:45.440
bony fingers fucking shuffle and not even look and talk and some shit.

189
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.850
She's got a favorite little candies right to the right you know in a dish.

190
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.720
You know I saw an old school old lady today I was in I was down at the grocery

191
00:11:56.931 --> 00:11:59.830
store buying some fuckin food right.

192
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:05.770
<v 0>And this lady comes around the corner she add on like this turquoise blazer with</v>

193
00:12:07.181 --> 00:12:10.350
like some sort of brooch.
I forget what she had underneath it.

194
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.110
She had white slacks on white shoes and a white purse.

195
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.100
Just old school dress to the fucking night she look great.

196
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.050
Total fucking class act

197
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.320
made me miss my grandmother.

198
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.010
<v 6>My grandmother was a sharp dresser.</v>

199
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.540
They think those people they knew how to fuckin dress you know what I mean and

200
00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.160
then they did buy a pair of shoes.
God

201
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:36.190
<v 5>damn it they took care of
not like us today you know.</v>

202
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.710
<v 17>Well every black person I knew there was took care of their fucking sneakers.</v>

203
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.500
You know what I mean.
Keep the fucking things look brand new.

204
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.190
You know taken out a god damn you know the nail brush scrub in the sides right.

205
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.110
There was another white privilege moment right now you could just have dirty

206
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:54.320
sneakers and that was OK.

207
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.300
Me and I went outside and you got dirty and you keep watching me just.

208
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.250
He's always gonna be dirt out here man.

209
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.100
<v 24>I mean when Patrice just give me shit for my sneakers being dirty I was just
like</v>

210
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:12.210
a fucking beauty pageant.
He's like Bill if you were black and you walked out.

211
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.240
I mean I'm not black.

212
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:19.900
This is totally socially acceptable for me.
I get it.

213
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.480
You have new sneakers on.
Congratulations.

214
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.550
<v 12>Anyways I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.</v>

215
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.180
I'm doing this this Sunday night because as always I have a million things to do

216
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.600
during this time of year as we're writing

217
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.090

218
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.310

219
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:50.820
Big shit going we're almost at the clubhouse turn here now it's actually the guy

220
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.240

You know I think we'll have five.

221
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.690
Written and recorded by the end of this this month.

222
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.790
And I know what you guys are thinking.
So what does that mean.

223
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.550
It comes out December.
Oh no.

224
00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.180
No there's like 40 different other things you have to do to it over the course

225
00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:11.070
of the next.
I don't know how many months before it finally fucking comes out.

226
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.923
I have no idea.

227
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.510
We were joking one time I think by the time we do the sixth season I'll be in my

228
00:14:17.511 --> 00:14:18.344
late 60s

229
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.050
but I have to tell you I really fucking like it.

230
00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.730
<v 5>I really like doing it and</v>

231
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.770
I really enjoy being in the writers room you know.

232
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:35.300
Some days it sucks when like this shit just doesn't work and my brain isn't

233
00:14:35.301 --> 00:14:38.140
working and I'm fried some of those days suck but generally but then you know

234
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:43.010
and everybody else is
saying funny shit so that makes you get going you know.

235
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.220
But I actually really enjoy writing dialogue.

236
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.620
Who would have thought you know in a way I can.

237
00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.180
You know some guy who says nucular can actually write a fucking episode of

238
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:57.470
television you know just think about that.
Okay.

239
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:02.530
<v 17>Think about think about that and then stop complaining about who is president</v>

240
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:05.770
right now.
Okay.
If you can say nucular and then you can fuck me.

241
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.890
<v 1>George Bush you say nucular the amount of people that fuckin laughed at him and</v>

242
00:15:10.891 --> 00:15:13.690
I want to be like Hey are you bilingual.
Can you also speak Spanish.

243
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.630
Did you go to Yale.
The guy went to fucking Yale.
All right.

244
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.540
I don't give a shit if his dad got him into what is a legacy.

245
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.420
He still went there.
You still got that education.

246
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.260
<v 12>Still gonna be a member of the skull and bones.</v>

247
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.410
<v 1>I think it's why I had that laugh because he knew we didn't belong there.</v>

248
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:37.070
<v 5>He knew he got his feet just got pushed down that fucking road you know.</v>

249
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.020
Well you think he really wanted to do.

250
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:47.280
<v 10>I think like what you do after your prayers after President really lets people</v>

251
00:15:47.281 --> 00:15:50.350
know how much you love the job.
You know what I mean.

252
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:55.600
And like he just fucking desert Bill Clinton he still you know Bill Clinton was

253
00:15:55.601 --> 00:15:59.200
all about the horse you know so he's still he's still out there giving speeches.

254
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.510
I don't know his fucking Dad's right.
He's still out there.
You know.

255
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.550
Jimmy Carter's is building fucking arms there now and then he got fuckin.

256
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.960
George Bush he's just he's fucking hanging out like a trust fund kid.

257
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:19.590
<v 17>He's just sit around Peyton did you see that documentary rich kids like one of</v>

258
00:16:19.641 --> 00:16:22.340
the saddest fucking things I've ever seen in my life was

259
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.870
these people they were born into such wealth

260
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.580
like one of them was that they were part of the Johnson Johnson family which I

261
00:16:34.581 --> 00:16:36.890
think a lot of people don't know what that is but like when I was growing up

262
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.570
everything was made by Johnson and Johnson.

263
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.000
<v 12>I'm sure they got bought out whatever but when</v>

264
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.460
I guess when they bought that out Johnson and Johnson they built it in that

265
00:16:47.461 --> 00:16:51.690
their kids would always just be taken care of and would have a I don't know a

266
00:16:51.691 --> 00:16:56.691
position that competent they would just get money is this fucking beast that

267
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:02.270
Johnson and Johnson built just the inertia of that fucking thing just tearing

268
00:17:02.941 --> 00:17:07.941
through the capitalist economy right was just so big that they just think just

269
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:12.930
like if they get the skim member fucking casino the scam that their kids still

270
00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:16.950
get the scam and the fuckin scam alone they get a little fucking duffle bag of

271
00:17:16.951 --> 00:17:21.160
cash that they don't ever have to work in their life right.

272
00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.670
<v 5>And I would think that that would be too.</v>

273
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.540
That would be the fucking greatest thing ever.

274
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.960
That would be the greatest thing ever.
And

275
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:31.530
it kind of turned out that it wasn't.

276
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.040
I think it would be the greatest thing ever if you actually.

277
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.500
Lived the other way first

278
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.080
but even then I think I think it'll get boring after a while.

279
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.010
Do you think you could do it.

280
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.370
<v 0>I think if you just had enough money well you never had to work again.
My</v>

281
00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.560
thought would be well the next big thing in my life is I'm gonna die.

282
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.660
That's the next eventful thing.
I have no deadlines.

283
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.300
<v 25>I have no worries</v>

284
00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:05.670
Oh my my.

285
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.100
<v 15>I would get like Psycho obsessed with shit</v>

286
00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.253
you know.

287
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.860
<v 0>Like I do already but then like my real life takes over.</v>

288
00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.010
I can play drums and lead once again for us.

289
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.770
I'm a fan of playing on fucking time and then like my real life to.

290
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.220
You get to go to the writers room and then it eases it off.

291
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.630
Like if I just fucking was sitting there like when I was talking to guys about

292
00:18:25.631 --> 00:18:30.631
that building in Manhattan the one looks like a giant cigarette something Park

293
00:18:31.781 --> 00:18:32.614
Avenue.

294
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.680
<v 3>And I was like What the fuck is that thing that thing is bigger than the Freedom</v>

295
00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:36.514
Tower.

296
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.980
And I went back and I looked at those pictures that they have from the penthouse

297
00:18:41.981 --> 00:18:43.960
in that building and that bathtub.

298
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.690
<v 12>Bathtub everybody has now it's shaped like like the fucking Chicago Bears</v>

299
00:18:49.691 --> 00:18:50.524
stadium.

300
00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:55.060
You know that one that freestanding one is not on legs like it's it's big.

301
00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.960
The ladies love it evidently.
Right.

302
00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:02.530
And it's right up on the fuckin window and you can just look out.

303
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.400
All the way south of Manhattan past the Statue of Liberty to see the fucking and

304
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:12.420
you know whenever the Germans come to attack us again.
Think you know

305
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.640
this person in the fucking tub is gonna see it first right.

306
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.890
The Japanese I should say.

307
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.350
I just figured that side of the country you know the Germans would be coming

308
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.260
right with their nuclear weapons.

309
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.400
<v 17>Actually why would you bring it over here.</v>

310
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.810
You just fucking shoot it off when you.

311
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.550
Anyway so I was just looking at and I was just trying to imagine sitting in that

312
00:19:35.551 --> 00:19:36.750
tub taking a bath.

313
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.950
<v 10>That would be one of the saddest experiences you could be could possibly have.</v>

314
00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.030
<v 14>It looks so fucking lonely.</v>

315
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.900
First when I saw I was like holy shit that's fucking unbelievable that looks

316
00:19:49.901 --> 00:19:54.730
like.
Feel like I'm in a helicopter but you're like in a fuckin building.

317
00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:01.140
<v 26>But then just being that high up you can't even hear the city anymore.</v>

318
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.830
Just how quiet it would be.

319
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.910
<v 10>You know you lit it.
You're getting to that level that thing that astronauts see.</v>

320
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.660
<v 26>You know like the astronauts they would go out and they would orbit the earth</v>

321
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:18.200
and they would just look down at it and they were above all the bullshit all the

322
00:20:18.451 --> 00:20:23.451
politics all the religion all the fucking war all the disease all the suffering

323
00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:28.650
and they looked down and they were able to see how beautiful it was the paradise

324
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.110
that we actually live in

325
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.010
we just sit here with all those petty shit and these guys would come back and

326
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.970
they couldn't talk to anybody about it couldn't give anybody else that

327
00:20:39.971 --> 00:20:42.300
perspective unless they talked to a fellow astronaut.

328
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.750
<v 6>So then they would just be you know pulling up to a stoplight.</v>

329
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.340
They would see something they would just randomly start crying.

330
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:56.430
<v 27>I think that would happen if I took a bath that high above fuckin Manhattan.</v>

331
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.480
<v 28>And you just looking out all.</v>

332
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.800
<v 15>Why can't why isn't.</v>

333
00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.760
<v 1>Why don't we ever do the right to be philosophically just stay why don't we do</v>

334
00:21:07.761 --> 00:21:09.530
the right thing why are we always like you can't.

335
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.340
<v 28>That's that's.</v>

336
00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.040
That's the scary thing it's what all pilots are a little fucking weird.

337
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.970
There's something weird about going up there and just looking down at all of it

338
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.000
you know like a higher being.

339
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:26.870
<v 6>That you also get to see what the fuck would do into the planet.</v>

340
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.150
It's a really fucking it's a weird thing.

341
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.890
<v 28>And then you combine that with the fact that you'd taken a bath.</v>

342
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.030
One of the most relaxing thing ever.
Just looking down at this fucking terror.

343
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.553
I don't know.

344
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.920
<v 18>I also kind of wonder like with global warming like what's going to happen.</v>

345
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.170
<v 5>You know I'm sorry.</v>

346
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.033
<v 22>Climate change.</v>

347
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.550
I didn't mean to shock you by saying global warming I hope I didn't ruin your

348
00:21:51.551 --> 00:21:55.150
day with those two fucking words let me say climate change you can fucking relax

349
00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:55.984
a little bit.

350
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.570
<v 17>Still understand why they say that climate change.</v>

351
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.670
It's like wouldn't Halliburton changed its fuckin name right.

352
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.170
Well they changed it to peaches and cream.
I can't fucking remember.

353
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.033
<v 5>Anyways</v>

354
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:14.160
I was just thinking that like the more like severe the weather is gonna get like

355
00:22:14.401 --> 00:22:15.234
what will that mean.

356
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.400
<v 17>You know like we can expect some crazy storms we've never fucking seen before.</v>

357
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:24.490
I wonder if they took that into consideration when they built that goddamn
thing.

358
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.460
Then all of a sudden you know

359
00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:35.020
we're going to start getting like like steroid era Mark McGuire era of fucking.

360
00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.970
You know hurricanes

361
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.340
you know and this is going to be a category 19 and you're up there taking a

362
00:22:43.341 --> 00:22:44.240
fuckin bath.

363
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.050
<v 29>Watching this shit roll in it.</v>

364
00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.470
You're going to go right out that fucking window in that tub.

365
00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.460
<v 27>All the way down to the fucking pavement.
But what a way to go.</v>

366
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:58.730
<v 19>That poor son thing.</v>

367
00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:02.060
It'd be like the cartoons where you try to get the bathwater back into the

368
00:23:02.061 --> 00:23:05.030
fucking tub.
It will be a hell of a death.

369
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.980
I honestly think if there is a God you know he would fuck and take extra time.

370
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:15.430
He would take extra time with you just being like like just watching the game

371
00:23:15.491 --> 00:23:16.730
film of your death going

372
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.560
I'm just being like you know I've seen people die since the beginning man.

373
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.290
I hate this.

374
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:27.290
This this is this is what this is this is definitely I've never seen this one

375
00:23:27.641 --> 00:23:29.650
before.
I've never seen somebody

376
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.920
in a bathtub at 13 out of 50 feet.

377
00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.030
<v 21>I don't know.</v>

378
00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.900
<v 9>I don't know why I'm obsessed with that fuckin building it's just I don't know.</v>

379
00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.140
<v 30>There was just something about the fact that they can't sell the one underneath</v>

380
00:23:44.141 --> 00:23:46.850
that is the funniest shit ever because who the fuck is gonna pay eighty five

381
00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:50.920
million dollars and still have somebody living above and boy who you fucking

382
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:55.810
knock it off about their
I mean what am I paid for you.

383
00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:03.470
<v 9>Anyways how about those Red Sox huh.
How about those Red Sox.</v>

384
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.960
But you know something they went deep deep.
They're undefeated.

385
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.200
They won five in a row undefeated this month.
All right.

386
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.570
And I went on the I went on the old Internet there.
Right.

387
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.430
<v 31>And
I see.</v>

388
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:20.320
<v 19>I looked up the standings the baseball standings yet.
That that that was it.</v>

389
00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.050
But it ended at that.
That that was the baseball won right.
This week in baseball.

390
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.620
<v 32>Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Lula big bad day.</v>

391
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.270
<v 33>The little day to day</v>

392
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.890
that ended up ordered auditable.

393
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.160
<v 9>If you saw the highlights and actually heard an orchestra playing when I just</v>

394
00:24:37.161 --> 00:24:41.180
played it or tried to sing it be tremendous.
So.

395
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:47.400
<v 10>The Houston Astros evidently are the other beasts of the American League.</v>

396
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.310
<v 9>I was all excited that we slept a White Sox had just realized that the forty one</v>

397
00:24:54.311 --> 00:24:57.470
in 68.
I guess it's not such a big deal.
Well we did what we were supposed to do.

398
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.720
<v 1>We kick the shit out of a man.</v>

399
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:07.190
We won six in a row gone eight to last ten picked up three games on them fucking

400
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.020
Yankees you see fucking Aaron judge thirty fifth home run today.

401
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.540
Had the same trajectory as a base hit 7 went out of the park telling you it's

402
00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.540
like and Paul Bunyan come into the goddamn play

403
00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:24.720
loving the Indians in first place they'd be great to see them win one.

404
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.090
<v 9>Let's test my knowledge.</v>

405

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:48.550
I might go to Asbury Park during the day I've no idea what I'm going to do

640
00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:51.970
because I usually stay in the city.

641
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.920
<v 17>I think I'm going to fuckin stay as somewhere out in Jersey.</v>

642
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:59.780
You know maybe a call fucking what's his face Vinny brand Vinny brand has a
boat.

643
00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:03.630
I'm terrified of the ocean going to go out in the fuckin ocean with a goddamn

644
00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.473
club owner.

645
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.960
<v 5>Why not.
All right.
Okay.
Here we go.</v>

646
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:11.490
<v 10>The properly with North Korea.</v>

647
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:14.130
Dear Ronald McDonald balls.

648
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:21.560
<v 6>North Korea is a serious threat to East Asia and now too good a portion of the</v>

649
00:41:21.901 --> 00:41:22.734
world.

650
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:29.190
<v 5>I understand that.
So what.
So are we.
So are we.</v>

651
00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:31.663
You know.

652
00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.050
<v 6>If you're gonna play this game you know what I mean like like everybody that</v>

653
00:41:35.051 --> 00:41:38.500
said the Patriots cheated if you're gonna play that game then you got to see the

654
00:41:38.501 --> 00:41:41.800
cheating that you're doing.
Correct.
Am I nuts here.
Am I crazy.

655
00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:46.540
<v 38>Yes the missile test the other day was a ballistic missile but they can put a</v>

656
00:41:46.541 --> 00:41:48.280
nuclear weapon on it as well.

657
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:54.510
OK so can we we already we already have ours ready to go their latest test puts

658
00:41:55.151 --> 00:41:59.290
most of the US all of Europe and a good portion of Africa within range of their

659
00:41:59.291 --> 00:42:00.124
weapons.

660
00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:04.810
<v 1>Yes and all of those places are in range of our weapons and Russia's weapons</v>

661
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:08.223
so

662
00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.910
you know I mean look I'm not saying it's great that this guy has this fucking

663
00:42:12.911 --> 00:42:17.170
thing but just imagine if he had what we had.
What the fuck would we be doing.

664
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:19.540
Wouldn't we be doing the same fucking thing.

665
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.930
Well we've got to get some stuff here.

666
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.590
He's making that shit because we got our shit.
Right.

667
00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:31.000
It's like when the Yankees started spending 200 million fucking dollars the Red

668
00:42:31.001 --> 00:42:33.270
Sox had to spend one night.
That's what happens.

669
00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:34.960
<v 5>That's what happens.</v>

670
00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:41.950
<v 38>And if they are actually able to successfully launched from a submarine as they</v>

671
00:42:41.951 --> 00:42:43.330
are attempting to do this.

672
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:47.560
This not only increases the range but can potentially dramatically increase the

673
00:42:47.561 --> 00:42:49.390
amount of time we have to respond.

674
00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:53.220
If they were to launch a missile what would happen sir.

675
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:59.920
<v 5>That's it.
Everybody knows there's no end game to this shit.
Okay it's okay.</v>

676
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:04.310
It's gonna be over
we would have time to respond.

677
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:08.120
<v 38>Don't you remember what the fuck was it war games.</v>

678
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:11.390
<v 22>I can't believe how seriously people are fucking taking this shit.</v>

679
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.880
I don't think this guy's out of his fuckin mind in North Korea.

680
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.930
<v 5>All right.
I'm just so fucking sick of.</v>

681
00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:21.250
<v 1>Having to turn on the TV and have somebody has to try.</v>

682
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:26.260
It's like news now is just scared the shit out of somebody and offered no

683
00:43:26.261 --> 00:43:30.640
fucking solutions and then normal people just sit there screaming at each other

684
00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:35.680
to the point that this fucking dope is taking the time to turn my podcast which

685
00:43:35.681 --> 00:43:37.690
is supposed to be a break from all of that shit.

686
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:41.730
Which is why I just say silly shit about it.
You turning this into Meet the Press

687
00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.720
if that fucking asshole shoots one off poignant right at my house because I

688
00:43:47.721 --> 00:43:50.300
don't want to survive it.
I don't give a fuck.

689
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:55.250
<v 5>All right.
We have no one to blame but ourselves.</v>

690
00:43:56.890 --> 00:44:01.090
<v 6>We're fucking defective.
If human beings were cars we would all be recalled.</v>

691
00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:01.750
All right.

692
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:06.010
We do not handle a position of power well and this is what the fuck happens all

693
00:44:06.011 --> 00:44:06.460
right.

694
00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.840
<v 42>We're fearful fucking lunatics.</v>

695
00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:15.290
<v 6>Who for some stupid reason were given the ability to fucking intimidate nerds so</v>

696
00:44:15.691 --> 00:44:18.060
they would build all this shit for us and now here we are.

697
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.333
<v 5>Here we are.</v>

698
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.730
<v 6>All right.
All right.</v>

699
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.420
North Korea also has the highest percentage of slaves in the world.

700
00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:30.290
Fully like you care sir.
Like you give a shit.

701
00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:33.760
Fully four point four percent of its population is enslaved.

702
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.640
That is approximately one point one million.

703
00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:40.070
Sir I am on an apple fucking computer right now and I'm sure you typed yours on

704
00:44:40.071 --> 00:44:41.020
an Apple computer too.

705
00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:42.950
<v 42>Those people are jumping out of the factory.</v>

706
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:48.970
They're their fucking slaves all this shit that I'm wearing was made in

707
00:44:48.971 --> 00:44:49.804
sweatshops.

708
00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:51.550
<v 22>Like what are we doing now.</v>

709
00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:54.530
Now we're gonna fudge the fucking numbers so these people look like they're out

710
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:57.300
of their minds but everybody else is fucking OK.

711
00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.600
This is like commie countries are like community colleges where they will figure

712
00:45:01.601 --> 00:45:04.990
out what their number one and so they can fuck and put it in their pamphlet.

713
00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:10.260
<v 3>OK.
Let's read some more fucking depressing information.</v>

714
00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:14.760
This is why I don't watch the news
today that it did.

715
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:19.140
<v 43>And that doesn't even mention the network of concentration camps across the</v>

716
00:45:19.141 --> 00:45:21.500
nation and the people getting less than subsist

717
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.980
less than subsistence levels of daily calories.

718
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:30.990
<v 10>Well I mean they're also not allowed to trade with anybody are they you know</v>

719
00:45:30.991 --> 00:45:32.610
they really can't get their shit going right.

720
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:37.640
<v 43>I mean part of that is us trying to force them into giving in to get them</v>

721
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:42.540
forever twenty ones in Starbucks there isn't that right.
I mean I might be wrong.

722
00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:47.460
<v 0>So I fuckin watch sports I watch sports I listen to music.</v>

723
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:48.840
OK.

724
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.840
<v 26>I block all this shit out so I'm sure I mispronounce some words here to put that</v>

725
00:45:54.031 --> 00:45:55.170
into perspective.

726
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.400
About three hundred eighty eight thousand slaves were shipped to North America

727
00:45:59.401 --> 00:46:02.260
from fifteen twenty five to eight nine 1866.

728
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:05.160
It's obviously a huge issue.

729
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:10.650
Well how do you how do you put that in perspective without telling me what the

730
00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:12.840
population of Korea is.

731
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.920
And also three hundred eighty eight thousand people back in but between 15 25 in

732
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:24.410
1866 was a way more significant portion of the population than it is today.

733
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.033
Correct.

734
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:32.150
So I don't know what you're saying there sir but I do know that whenever we have

735
00:46:32.761 --> 00:46:36.270
an issue with the country all of a sudden we pretend to care about its people.

736
00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:40.230
<v 38>Unfortunately there isn't any easy solution to the problem.</v>

737
00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:44.880
Even if China withdraws their support and the regime regime collapses you're

738
00:46:44.881 --> 00:46:49.200
still looking at a potential civil war in a nation with nuclear weapons.

739
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:53.760
Let's just hope people smarter than you are I can find a different solution to

740
00:46:53.761 --> 00:46:56.520
the problem and then they won't.
There's only one solution.

741
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:58.380
<v 18>Gotta go in there and get them.</v>

742
00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:00.450
<v 38>Keep up the good work.</v>

743
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:04.320
I love hearing you talk about us how awesome it is to be a parent instead of

744
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.160
constant talk about how hard it is.

745
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.660
As a dad of two boys there are obviously days when I feel like ripping out what

746
00:47:09.661 --> 00:47:13.680
little hair I have left.
But the vast vast majority of the time is just awesome.

747
00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:15.060
Look at this.

748
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:18.060
He was actually just informing me and I got all fucking defensive because all

749
00:47:18.061 --> 00:47:20.700
this week people said that I said new killer instead of new clear.

750
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:24.300
Yes sir I realize he's out of his fucking mind.

751
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:26.100
I realize that person's out of his fucking mind.

752
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:28.720
<v 26>The guy before him his dad was out of his fucking mind OK.</v>

753
00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:33.760
Trump is out of his fucking mind.
I'm out of my fucking mind.
OK.

754
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:39.200
Nobody should have weapons other than your fucking fists and whatever you can

755
00:47:39.221 --> 00:47:43.220
grab in the kitchen.
That's ideally that's what that would be better.

756
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:45.363
<v 5>All right.</v>

757
00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:51.240
I think I don't understand why war is legal but it is.

758
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:56.530
<v 6>So this is the game that we play with each other and it is fucking inevitable</v>

759
00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:01.090
that one day somebody is going to go Martin Sheen dead zone

760
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:03.910
and what are you gonna do.

761
00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:06.653
<v 5>Yeah out.</v>

762
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:12.790
<v 10>See people this is why I have all four sports packages because I don't want to</v>

763
00:48:13.201 --> 00:48:14.220
know about this shit.

764
00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:19.030
<v 26>I don't want to fuckin sit here and watch the news and have them scare the</v>

765
00:48:19.031 --> 00:48:22.270
living shit out of me that now this is going to happen.

766
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:27.130
You know and some flies going to bite me and then I have a baby with a little

767
00:48:27.131 --> 00:48:30.050
head.
Somebody else is going to fucking blow me up.

768
00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:34.390
Yeah just I just I don't want to talk about this.
OK.

769
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.640
Trying to keep it light on the podcast here.

770
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:41.140
<v 42>Let's just make this just laugh at me not being able to pronounce words don't</v>

771
00:48:41.141 --> 00:48:43.060
bring actual facts into this podcast.

772
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:47.290
<v 10>All right girls softball team punished.</v>

773
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:49.610
Hey there billy batting glove.

774
00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.210
Did you hear about the girls softball team that was removed from the World

775
00:48:53.211 --> 00:48:58.010
Series because of a picture of some of the players flicking off the camera on

776
00:48:58.011 --> 00:48:58.910
social media.

777
00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:04.580
One of the girls on the team is the daughter of a family friend.

778
00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:05.630
It's fucking brutal.

779
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:12.890
<v 17>Yeah I mean I don't know.
I don't know what I don't understand social media.</v>

780
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:16.580
I'm kind of over it.
Other than for business purposes.

781
00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:20.060
I don't just don't think it's a good thing that should've just been a funny

782
00:49:20.061 --> 00:49:23.660
picture that they all took shared amongst themselves.

783
00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:27.920
But now you upload it and everybody sees it and you know somebody is going to

784
00:49:27.921 --> 00:49:30.230
get offended.
Let me guess.
Were they the best.

785
00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:31.970
Well they probably were the number one seed.

786
00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:35.830
<v 10>This sounds like one of those bad news bears things.</v>

787
00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:42.580
<v 17>They were removed from the World Series.</v>

788
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:43.503
<v 6>Well</v>

789
00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:47.960
well you know how you know people are there trying to make money they make money

790
00:49:47.961 --> 00:49:50.180
off that World Series is a national thing.
I don't know.

791
00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:53.350
It's like the Colin Cameron Dick thing everybody's fucking flipping out and

792
00:49:53.351 --> 00:49:56.300
immediately thinking that this guy's not getting hired because of racism.

793
00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:58.790
It's like the NFL is a fucking Corporation.

794
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.900
Okay you know what they give a fuck about money.

795
00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:08.390
Now look if he was trying to get a coaching job or own a team then yeah I would

796
00:50:08.391 --> 00:50:13.391
say racism would be more obvious but like what he does most of the league is

797
00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:15.050
black.
Doing.

798
00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:20.660
<v 44>Okay.
Their thing is they're such cheap fucking cunts</v>

799
00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:24.390
they would rather lose a fucking game.

800
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:30.030
<v 22>They probably have an algorithm going like OK if we get this guy and he wins a</v>

801
00:50:30.031 --> 00:50:30.900
few more games.

802
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:35.220
<v 19>How many jerseys will we sell versus the amount of people who won't buy a jersey</v>

803
00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:40.250
because we signed this guy and I swear to God if if if we'll sell a fucking

804
00:50:40.711 --> 00:50:45.711
Jersey less by signing a guy who would actually make us a better fuckin team I

805
00:50:46.531 --> 00:50:50.040
swear they will decide not to sign the guy.
I don't.

806
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:54.450
I'm not saying this isn't racism involved but it's really it's fucking economics

807
00:50:55.270 --> 00:51:00.270
and what these fucking corporations try to do is they they don't want any

808
00:51:01.721 --> 00:51:06.721
bullshit they want smooth fucking water that's what they want everybody fucking

809
00:51:08.511 --> 00:51:12.410
just tow the fucking line that's what they want and I'll tell you all these

810
00:51:12.411 --> 00:51:14.810
fucking groups that are trying to make change.

811
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.823
<v 22>No that shit.</v>

812
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:19.250
Which is why they always complain to the advertisers because the advertisers

813
00:51:19.251 --> 00:51:24.050
will then pull.
Sponsorship from TV shows they'll do it from fucking podcasts.

814
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:28.370
Everybody knows that.
So the NFL is a corporation.
So that's what they're doing.

815
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:32.600
<v 45>I don't know what the fuck league these girls are in but I'm sure they have some</v>

816
00:51:32.601 --> 00:51:35.780
sort of stupid conduct thing that they're trying to you know

817
00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.580
trying to uphold.

818
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:42.180
<v 0>Yeah.
It's fucking stupid.
It's also fucking stupid to upload that picture.</v>

819
00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:46.580
I mean how many of these dumb stories are you going to see where people get

820
00:51:46.581 --> 00:51:49.820
offended by absolutely nothing and it's something happens right.

821
00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:53.390
<v 3>That's unfortunate.
It's unfortunate.
All right.</v>

822
00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:58.170
Trent Reznor This is like a way more serious podcast than I ever want to do.

823
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:59.510
I don't know.
I don't know I have to do it.

824
00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:03.990
I must just start making up shit here I try to read the news but it's just all

825
00:52:03.991 --> 00:52:04.560
depressing.

826
00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.980
<v 6>Although the funny one was all this shit coming out about Lady Diana now I just</v>

827
00:52:07.981 --> 00:52:11.520
don't understand how new evidence.
Twenty years later they're fine.

828
00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:15.450
They found out that fucking she was listening to Prince Charles jerking off

829
00:52:15.451 --> 00:52:17.190
talking to some other lady on a toilet.

830
00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:23.960
<v 19>Did somebody have that tape for fucking 20 years going hey to listen to this I</v>

831
00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:27.440
swear to God don't tell anybody I have this I'm going to release it when the

832
00:52:27.441 --> 00:52:31.450
time is right and then you just hear the echoing sound of Prince Charles going

833
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:34.220
Roy again putting your ass your arse.

834
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:41.390
<v 6>All right Trent Reznor article A Billy boy Billy boy he thought you could relate</v>

835
00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:41.810
to this.

836
00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:46.810
<v 46>Trent Reznor talks about what it's like to meet his parents kids you meant to</v>

837
00:52:50.051 --> 00:52:53.950
say is kids parents while having a body of work with lyrics like I want to fuck

838
00:52:53.951 --> 00:52:56.710
you like an animal.
Yeah I read that article but

839
00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:05.130
never underestimate the power of celebrity and especially I know he's an older

840
00:53:05.701 --> 00:53:06.420
dad.

841
00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:11.420
So maybe they don't even know what his fucking music is but you know I wouldn't

842
00:53:12.601 --> 00:53:16.980
give a shit I sang I downloaded that focus so I fucking loved his stuff.

843
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.610
That shit came out of that album blew my fucking mind.

844
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:25.250
<v 24>I believe that's Trent fuckin Reznor hey sweetheart that's Trent fuckin Reznor.</v>

845
00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:30.860
<v 5>I wouldn't give a shit you know but it's gotta be weird.</v>

846
00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:34.340
But then there's of course the people that don't like it you know the people

847
00:53:34.341 --> 00:53:38.990

all right.

849
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:49.860
<v 10>Court girlfriend cheating after joining the military and I legally can't leave</v>

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.680
Greetings from Scotland.

<v 38>My girlfriend of four years was very hesitant and didn't want me to leave.</v>

857
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:20.850
But it had been a dream of mine since I was 14.

858
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:26.570
<v 43>I sat down a week before leaving and gave her the opportunity to separate my</v>

859
00:54:27.211 --> 00:54:30.360
girlfriend for years is very hesitant and didn't want me to leave but we'd been

860
00:54:30.361 --> 00:54:34.770
dreamers and unfortunately I sat down with her a week before leaving and gave

861
00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:37.920
her the opportunity to separate on good terms and maybe continue our

862
00:54:37.921 --> 00:54:38.550
relationship.

863
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:41.100
<v 22>When I had finished my mandatory four years service.</v>

864
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:46.460
<v 47>But if we stayed together but we stay if we stayed together and she cheated she</v>

865
00:54:47.101 --> 00:54:47.940
would be dead to me.

866
00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:51.600
<v 45>I'm half Sicilian by the way.
She chose to stay.</v>

867
00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:55.440
<v 22>The fact that you were given the option to leave.</v>

868
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:56.970
I mean how much you give a shit about this woman.

869
00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:02.390
I was in for just over four weeks and fell during a run in a six six month

870
00:55:02.501 --> 00:55:06.970
server guys stood on my leg breaking my tibia in two places.

871
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:07.853
Oh fuck.

872
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:12.250
I was given the choice of staying in medical custody on base and rejoined

873
00:55:12.251 --> 00:55:15.340
training when I had healed or leaving for a year.

874
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:19.230
I chose to leave so I could spend more time with my girlfriend.
Oh.

875
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.360
Oh I thought it would be a nice surprise to not tell her I was coming home.

876
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:25.500
Oh Jesus.

877
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:29.580
<v 1>I arrived home around 9 p.m.
on Thursday.
Oh my God.</v>

878
00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:34.910
To find my girl oh jesus choking on some guy's dick.

879
00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:38.483
<v 21>Wow.</v>

880
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.400
<v 22>So what did you throw your fucking crutches at him.</v>

881
00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:47.620
Naturally my instinct was to beat the shit out of the guy but I'm not too mobile

882
00:55:47.621 --> 00:55:48.760
with a pair of crutches.

883
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:53.650
I forced the two out of my house and kept my promise of your dead to me by

884
00:55:53.651 --> 00:55:54.860
changing the locks.

885
00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:59.500
The next morning and blocking her number and social media accounts around 2

886
00:55:59.501 --> 00:56:02.950
weeks later I received the letter from a lawyer saying that if I don't take her

887
00:56:02.951 --> 00:56:07.951
back she can legally take half of all my assets including the house my mother

888
00:56:08.081 --> 00:56:13.081
left me in her will because we had been together for more than two years

889
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:18.250
what I thought you had to be married.

890
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:24.080
<v 46>But lo and behold the British justice system does me another solid.</v>

891
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:29.590
<v 22>I could understand if I was away on tour from 9 months that she cheated but for</v>

892
00:56:29.591 --> 00:56:33.080
weeks fucking for weeks you gotta be fucking kidding me.

893
00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:36.500
So I just take the loss and leave this dumb whore.

894
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.880
Do I take her back and try to forget the fact that she took the first

895
00:56:39.881 --> 00:56:44.320
opportunity she had to jump on jump another guy's bone your bones your input

896
00:56:44.321 --> 00:56:48.310
would be great and maybe can put a funny twist on this fucked up opportunity for

897
00:56:48.311 --> 00:56:50.530
your listeners.
Do you need to get a fucking lawyer.

898
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.990
You need to get that bitch out of your life and get a fucking lawyer.

899
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:54.440
<v 5>That's what you need to do.</v>

900
00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:56.320
<v 22>All right.</v>

901
00:56:56.320 --> 00:57:00.790
That's one of the dumbest laws I've ever heard in my life and that's going to

902
00:57:00.791 --> 00:57:01.624
cause.

903
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:05.900
<v 0>That's going to cause people to make some really fucked up decisions.</v>

904
00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:09.150
If someone can screw on that fucking bad.

905
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:13.750
<v 5>All right.
Over here.
If the statutory.</v>

906
00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:17.220
Statutory rape.
What is it.
What is it.

907
00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.840
What is the fucking law when you've been illegally married.

908
00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:24.450
<v 17>That's squatter's rights what the fuck is it.
I don't know.</v>

909
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:27.630
Over here it's like you gotta be living with somebody for like 7 year depending

910
00:57:27.631 --> 00:57:28.464
on the state.

911
00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:34.890
<v 45>And at that point they considered it so dumb that she's entitled to half his</v>

912
00:57:34.891 --> 00:57:37.890
shit especially if she's not making any money and you're fucking paying for

913
00:57:37.891 --> 00:57:39.690
everything you know.

914
00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:45.800
<v 0>It's fucking ridiculous.
What a fucking cunt.</v>

915
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:49.583
<v 1>You know what I mean.</v>

916
00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:53.010
I mean how many fuckin stories do they do out there about men beating women and

917
00:57:53.011 --> 00:57:56.220
how awful men are to fucking women right.

918
00:57:56.730 --> 00:57:59.190
Which obviously they've got to shine a light on that but look at this she's

919
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:03.390
she's gonna just fucking whore.
Who sucked this other guy's dick.

920
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:07.530
Doesn't could care less about taking half of the house that your mother left you

921
00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.900
Oh my God what a fucking cunt.

922
00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:14.580
<v 14>Dude I would get a lawyer.</v>

923
00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:19.320
<v 9>I would get Oh my God I would get a fuckin lawyer.</v>

924
00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:23.850
<v 1>What a fucking piece of shit dude like I only I can't even.</v>

925
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:27.270
<v 15>This is like making me angry that someone could do that to somebody</v>

926
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:31.110
what kind of a piece of shit.

927
00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:35.210
<v 1>The kind of person that fucking blows somebody for we said.</v>

928
00:58:35.330 --> 00:58:38.360
But even then there's plenty of women that would do that.

929
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:40.070
There's plenty of fucking women that would do that.

930
00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:44.780
They wouldn't take your fucking house.
They were raised right.

931
00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:46.570
They get caught sucking addicted guy.

932
00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:51.030
<v 10>You know fair enough and they leave
Jesus cry.</v>

933
00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.050
We get a lawyer sir.

934
00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:57.750
I would get a lawyer and I would fuckin fight this thing find some fucking thing

935
00:58:57.851 --> 00:58:58.684
that Oh my God.

936
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.110
<v 45>The advice that I want to give you I can't say over this because I'll be liable.</v>

937
00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:06.180
Okay.

938
00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.330
<v 9>And it's like</v>

939
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.100
all right let me tell let me tell the fucking little story here.

940
00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:14.380
I can't I can't do it.

941
00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:16.760
I can't tell the story because I'll get in fucking trouble.
I won't serve.

942
00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:19.660
<v 22>You know what I will get a lawyer and handle it legally.</v>

943
00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:24.520
Don't do anything fucking crazy.
All right.
Jesus Christ.
What I can't do.

944
00:59:24.550 --> 00:59:26.770
I'll tell you right there man you you met one for the ages.

945
00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:30.500
That's a first ballot Hall of Fame count.
If I ever fucking heard of one.

946
00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:32.530
Good Lord.

947
00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:38.090
<v 1>I could see if she caught you and then out of vindictiveness then did that that</v>

948
00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:39.950
you know they'd be like well you know what the fuck.

949
00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:44.520
But she's gonna do that and then take half your fuckin house.

950
00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:51.320
<v 44>And you know it kills me when she tells the story.
She.</v>

951
00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:53.770
I'm not saying she'll play that she won't be in the wrong.

952
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:59.360
I mean that's a fucking psychopath.
Thank God you didn't breed with her man.

953
00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:04.250
Jesus fucking Christ
Jesus Christ.
Well you know what.

954
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:05.720
<v 24>Thank you for your service sir.</v>

955
01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:10.790
<v 1>You know what these whores can take everything you got.</v>

956
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.290
There's nothing you can fucking do about it.

957
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.900
That's how the laws are set up and I gotta be honest with you dude.

958
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:19.250
You know worst case scenario if she takes you off half your house and have to

959
01:00:19.251 --> 01:00:22.880
shit.
Even still considering what the fuck they can do to you.

960
01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:27.680
<v 46>You actually got off easy
easier than a lot of guys did.</v>

961
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:29.270
But Jesus Christ

962
01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:35.320
can I apologize for this podcast.
I don't want to get involved in world politics.

963
01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:36.880
I don't want to talk about North Korea.

964
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:39.270
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
You don't know me.

965
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:44.080
<v 6>For the 18 people that are going to take any of this shit fucking seriously I</v>

966
01:00:44.081 --> 01:00:47.170
don't give a shit.
Let's just keep it to correcting my fucking spelling shall we.

967
01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:51.580
I'm going to end this fucking podcast on an upbeat note.

968
01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.710
It's Joe de Rose's birthday today.

969
01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:58.540
<v 1>God damn it.
He's coming home from fucking Amsterdam.
I'm Guy.
Happy</v>

970
01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:01.900
<v 48>birthday Joey Rose is.</v>

971
01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:07.410
<v 39>Happy birthday Joey Rose.
No way.</v>

972
01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.680
<v 9>I came.
I can't sing the song.</v>

973
01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:12.990
If you ever heard this fucking songs we sing to each other.

974
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.440
I mean just I'm trying to think of a group that wouldn't be offended by it.

975
01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.030
I know the one group in particular.

976
01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:22.560
I literally can't even sing the fuck.

977
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:24.780
This is just whole thing just went off the fucking rails.

978
01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:28.230
This whole podcast went off the rails because that was one that was such a

979
01:01:28.231 --> 01:01:29.820
fucking do you know what I did.

980
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:32.460
<v 0>You know because I've been stuck in the writers room and I haven't been going</v>

981
01:01:32.461 --> 01:01:36.360
out doing stand up and seeing people and having stories to tell you what I do

982
01:01:36.361 --> 01:01:37.480
before I get on the podcast.

983
01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:40.960
Now as I just click on Google news and it's just the most horrific shit.

984
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:47.750
<v 18>You know that fucking ride that broke in Ohio fucking 18 year old kid died.</v>

985
01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:52.050
Kid was born in nineteen ninety nine died going to a fucking amusement park.

986
01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.480
Somebody blew up a mosque.
Tried to fucking Minneapolis.

987
01:01:55.830 --> 01:01:58.980
I don't understand how people sit there and they watch CNN and Fox and all that

988
01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:03.000
shit just like what does it do for you to stay informed.

989
01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:07.470
<v 5>I don't have a fucking
I want to be fucking.</v>

990
01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:12.570
I don't want to say it.
Fuck I would be doing I.
It's just not fun anymore.

991
01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:14.330
I get it.

992
01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:15.060
<v 0>You know what I gotta do.</v>

993
01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:18.420

995
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:21.940
I'm going to go to a mall or something.

996
01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.640
I'll just make fun of fat people when I get back.

997
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:25.620
I apologize for the heaviness of this podcast.

998
01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:30.570
<v 28>All right go fuck yourselves.
I'll check in on you on Thursday over there.</v>
