00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.220
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:10.020
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
And I'm just checking in on.

3
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:14.940
You can't yell.
I can't yell.
I am in Cologne,
Germany.

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.210
Um,
and it is,

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.230
it is one 49 whoops.
Sorry.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.500
One 49 in the fucking morning and I'm fucking wide awake.

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.430
I'm still on fucking la time.
What a time is it back there?

8
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.460
Nine hour difference saints.
To what clock gates?
About what?

9
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.920
Nine 30 in the morning.
I don't what the fuck it is.

10
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.270
It's about four 34 or five o'clock or some shit.
Anyway,
so I worry you.

11
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.320
How are you doing?
I made it over here.
The flight was a fucking joke.

12
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.450
I literally watched like I watched one full movie.

13
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.290
All right.
It was a,
I watched Dr Strange love,

14
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.290
one of my favorite movies of all time and favorite director,

15
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.760
Stanley Kubrick and Peter Sellers.
Everybody in that movie is fucking brilliant.

16
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.180
I watched that and then I watched a half hour of goodwill hunting.

17
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:15.780
I was like,
I have not literally not seen this movie.

18
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.670
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.930
<v 1>Since I saw it in the movie theaters,
I've seen bits and pieces cause it's on,</v>

20
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:25.860
but I never just sat down to watch it.
Um,

21
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.640
for those of you who never seen it,
he's wicked smart.
He cleans the floors,

22
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:34.460
but he's wicked smart.
Um,

23
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.940
so a little bit of that,

24
00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:40.060
it was crazy because that movie doesn't seem that old to me.
I was like,
wow man,

25
00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:41.890
that's fucking movies.
21 years old.

26
00:01:41.891 --> 00:01:45.220
And when I was just seeing just a shot of the skyline of Boston,

27
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:49.180
how much it's changed,
um,
since then.

28
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.690
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.820
<v 1>And how much it's gentrified</v>

30
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.420
and gentrifying is Boston,

31
00:01:56.421 --> 00:02:01.100
is that the white people became even wider for most of those,
uh,

32
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.420
most of those areas.

33
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.630
And then I watched at the beginning of pappy on the original with Steve McQueen

34
00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:12.350
and Dustin Hoffman,
and then I fell asleep and just fucking woke up in Germany.

35
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.570
Um,
it's not that bad,
man was not that bad a fight,
but here was the problem.

36
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.770
I landed in Munich and add a connecting flight to Cologne and they gave me a

37
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:28.610
fucking one hour window to catch it.
An 11 hour flight.

38
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:30.800
And you're going to give me a one hour window.
I was like,

39
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.270
before you even get on the plane,
I'm like,

40
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:36.130
there's no fucking way I'm going to make that thing
so much shit.

41
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.630
Just a container of a headwind for 11 hours and I'm going to miss it.

42
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.423
And I missed it.

43
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.950
So I have fucking sit there in Munich at the God damn airport for like fucking

44
00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:52.180
three hours waiting for the last little southwest flight I had to take.

45
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.310
It was like an hour flight,
uh,
up to Cologne.
Wasn't that bad though.

46
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.300
But I mean,
I was cracking me up.
It was making,

47
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.470
making me think about the way they play football now,

48
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.960
where before halftime you score a touchdown,

49
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.740
you down by a point and rather than going for the extra point,
they do dumb shit.

50
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:12.760
Like they go for a two point conversion and then they don't get it rather than

51
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:15.610
being tied up that down by one.
And in the end,
you know,

52
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:16.840
there's some country thing,
you know,

53
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:19.840
you're down by four points instead of three negative score,
a touchdown.

54
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.190
That was the travel version of that.
So anyways,

55
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.210
um,
I got to tell you,
I don't,

56
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.210
I never think about World War II until I come over here.

57
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.660
I watched that Ken Burns the war just like a 90 fucking part one hour each.

58
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.650
Each one was like one hour long about the war.

59
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.380
And every time I fly over here,

60
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.830
it's not till I get over Great Britain.

61
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.400
And you just think about those Spitz fires and the blitzkrieg and all of that

62
00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:55.110
shit.
Winston Churchill,

63
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.750
then you've come onto the mainland,

64
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.040
you start thinking about the battle of the bulge.

65
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

66
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.750
<v 1>Dresden,
all of this fucking shit.</v>

67
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:09.340
And I was actually watching this documentary here,
uh,

68
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.190
and it was in German,
so I couldn't tell.
I was like,
wow,
they're fucking,

69
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.650
they're also talking about world war two.

70
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:18.100
I figured they'd want to shy away from it.
You know what I mean?

71
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.280
The same way I don't watch highlights from last year super bowl.

72
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.280
I don't want to see those eagles win either.
Right.
Um,

73
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.820
but they were talking about,
I could tell what they were talking about,

74
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:33.520
cause I had heard about it before.
Is this top secret?

75
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

76
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.030
<v 1>Uh,</v>

77
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.890
basically a jet that they were just on the verge of like developing,

78
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.290
which just would have been a fucking game changer.

79
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.350
Like how far ahead Germany was with all of their technology.

80
00:04:47.361 --> 00:04:49.580
I remember hearing,
I've talked about this shit before,

81
00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.890
like if you killed a German soldier was an American,

82
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.050
you dropped your machine gun and picked up there,

83
00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:58.910
it says with like fucking liquid cool or something like that.
Um,

84
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.830
I remember hearing some German tank commander saying,
uh,

85
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.390
one tiger was better than three Sherman's,

86
00:05:05.391 --> 00:05:08.900
but the Americans always had four.
You know,
typical us.

87
00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:12.110
We just treated it like a food court.
We just piled on instead of the food.

88
00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:16.600
It was a weaponry and were able to get them,
but some historians,

89
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:19.280
so I look up this fucking jet first.

90
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.570
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

91
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.140
<v 1>German,
Jed,
World War Two.
Yeah,
this fucking thing.</v>

92
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.350
And it looked just like the spitfire,
but it had like two jet engines on it.

93
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.080
So the only thing I could think like,
well,
what the fuck would you,

94
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.240
how quickly that thing could get up on you?

95
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.060
What would you try to be like Tom Cruise and that drug movie?

96
00:05:36.061 --> 00:05:40.630
We just slow down and the feds got to keep going by you.
You know,

97
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:41.441
I think that's works.

98
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:45.100
If somebody is not trying to fucking shoot you out of the sky.

99
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.460
So I think that that's probably what they focus on over here.

100
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.600
They focus on how good their weapons were rather than their a

101
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.040
missteps in

102
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.873
<v 2>society.</v>

103
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.430
<v 1>It was called the Ameesha Schmidt me is two six to nickname the Schwalbe.</v>

104
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.960
I'm sure I'm saying this phone.
It's German for the swallow.
Um,

105
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.360
was the world's first operational jet powered fighter aircraft.

106
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.800
That's what it was like basically a jet powered fucking two seater.

107
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.720
A design work started before World War II began,

108
00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:33.520
but problems with the engine,
which means people died testing it out.

109
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.070
Uh,
but blah,
blah,
blah.

110
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.300
The me 62 62 is faster and more heavily armed than any allied fighter,

111
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.240
including the British Oh,
jet powered.

112
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

113
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.890
<v 1>Gloster meteor.</v>

114
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.470
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

115
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.050
<v 1>Look at that big clunky hunk of shit.</v>

116
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.490
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.690
<v 1>Well,
I mean,
I shouldn't talk.
The Americans didn't have one,</v>

118
00:06:58.691 --> 00:07:00.910
but chase chaises is that an ugly ass fucking playing?

119
00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:04.420
The German one doesn't look bad.
It just looks like they're,
uh,
what they had.

120
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.620
The English had the spitfire.
I don't forget what the,
we had the Cadillac,

121
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:10.810
I don't know.
I don't fucking know shit about this stuff.
But anyways,

122
00:07:10.811 --> 00:07:12.580
I was watching,
I found that,
that,
um,

123
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.950
that was definitely interesting and,
um,
you know what it is,

124
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:21.080
you know how they always make fun of the ignorant American,

125
00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:22.700
the fat American and all that Shit.
You know,

126
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:26.480
what is the through line of cunty behavior is people getting off an

127
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:30.800
international flight and doing that fast walk.

128
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.490
I mean,
you see people cutting off old people in all of this shit.

129
00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:38.900
Just trying to not get an,
you know,
trying to get as far up,
you know,
to,

130
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:43.810
to get through customs is possible.
It's really fucking horrific.

131
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.650
Um,
I always laugh thinking like,
where are you going?

132
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.150
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

133
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.920
<v 1>They know where the fuck is anybody going?</v>

134
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.610
It's already another flight in front of you.
You know,
we didn't,
you're going to,

135
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.970
you're going to get there first and you'd be first and fucking line.
Um,

136
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.630
maybe it works.
I don't know.

137
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:05.910
I don't life's too short to run through a fucking airport with your luggage.

138
00:08:05.911 --> 00:08:09.670
If you're not trying to catch a plane,
you already landed.
What are you doing?

139
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.820
Just sit on your phone,

140
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.650
play a little fucking solitaire and then talk to the guy up there.
You know,

141
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.710
I didn't know what to say cause you know I landed when I landed in Munich,

142
00:08:16.711 --> 00:08:21.120
I didn't know,
usually I have work papers and I was sitting there thinking like,

143
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.840
ah fuck man,
I don't have any fucking work papers and I get up there.

144
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.350
So I tried to look all chill and shit.
Right.

145
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.670
The lady doesn't ask me anything and the guy behind her is like training of it

146
00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:35.280
and he's like,
oh I've seen,
she describes him,
did I use it?
And I'm like,

147
00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:36.300
he's just trained in a man.

148
00:08:36.301 --> 00:08:39.780
He's just trainer and I'm working up this lie in my head that I'm meeting my

149
00:08:39.781 --> 00:08:42.840
wife and Cologne,
Germany and she's coming over from London.

150
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.940
Could could it be any more convoluted?

151
00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:49.800
Like really you guys are beginning of your European vacation and Cologne.
Jeremy,

152
00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:50.850
do you have family there?

153
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.750
Did they just put up a new fucking Ferris wheel with the ego where that fucking

154
00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:57.570
giant there,
which I didn't know existed,

155
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.460
had no idea that fucking thing existed until I fucking looked up things to do in

156
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:04.980
Cologne cause I got a whole day tomorrow.

157
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.770
I just want to go out and buy a pair of fucking Adidas over here that they don't

158
00:09:09.771 --> 00:09:13.580
have state side.
I'm not looking for 20 floors of horse here.

159
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.330
Um,
anyways.
Uh,

160
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.690
so I make it through.
They stamped my passport,
I think I'm all good.

161
00:09:22.691 --> 00:09:27.670
And then this fucking cop is just like a Guttentag hello.
And I'm like,
Hey,

162
00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:29.690
what's up?
He goes,
away,
you're gone.
I want to be,

163
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.030
what the fuck are you going fuck with?
Fuck you mean what am I doing?

164
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.410
He already stamped the fucking thing.

165
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.150
So then I tell them to stupid shit about my wife coming over.
He goes,

166
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.010
is this the only place we're going to be a gentleman?
I was like,
I be Cologne,

167
00:09:42.011 --> 00:09:45.550
Munich,
Berlin.
Where else?
And I'm like,
Warsaw,

168
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.380
Prague hungry.

169
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:48.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

170
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.820
<v 1>And he goes,
how long are you going to be over here until the 14th of January.</v>

171
00:09:52.821 --> 00:09:55.660
I was like,
yeah.
Then I'm like,

172
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.760
and he starts walking towards this door with my passport.
I'm like,

173
00:09:58.761 --> 00:10:01.940
Jesus fucking Christ.
Here we go.
Right?

174
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.720
And then he just turns around and gives it to me.
And I was just like,
all right.

175
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.430
So then I text my fucking tour guy over here.
I was like,
do I need work papers?

176
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.070
And he's like,
no,
you're all good.
So I went through that whole fucking,
uh,

177
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.020
what was that movie there?

178
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

179
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.270
<v 1>Well that fucking guy,
he has the drugs tape to them.</v>

180
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:20.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

181
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.740
<v 1>I can't remember fucking anything.
I ended up having that moment.</v>

182
00:10:23.741 --> 00:10:24.670
I didn't even need to.

183
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:26.643
<v 0>MMM.</v>

184
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.320
<v 1>So anyway,
so I'm here,
um,
uh,
um,
obviously jet lag,
but,
uh,</v>

185
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.620
my hour is ready to go and I plan on kicking the shit out of people right

186
00:10:35.621 --> 00:10:37.990
through Europe.
And this is going to be a thrash.

187
00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:43.050
So my only thing I need to do is I need to get my Kiddo some shell toes,

188
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.700
get my wife some sneakers and get myself some sneakers.
And other than that,

189
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.430
all I do when I go to new countries cause I don't like clutter is I,
you know,

190
00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:56.800
that little flag you buy that people so in their coat,

191
00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.350
I just buy that thing and I've never sewed them on to anything.

192
00:10:59.351 --> 00:11:01.030
I just keep them in a little plastic bag.

193
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:02.743
<v 0>MMM.</v>

194
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.201
<v 1>Which by the way,</v>

195
00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:07.950
I saw this thing where people try to break the record to see all of the country

196
00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:12.780
go to every country in the fucking world.
Um,
first of all,
I,

197
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:15.930
it's like what country do you come from where your country doesn't have beef

198
00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:19.230
with any other nation?
You know what I mean?

199
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:24.510
Jesus Christ the way that they're fucking whack and people nowadays.

200
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.630
Um,
but anyways,

201
00:11:26.631 --> 00:11:29.250
so like some people have done it by the time they're like in their twenties.

202
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.880
Then I read this one guy,
we say,
sorry,

203
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.410
daddy started to do it.

204
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.430
But then after he got up to 120 something countries and he realized that he

205
00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:45.210
wasn't traveling,
he wasn't seeing anything.
He was just going there and just,

206
00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:49.590
you know,
you know,
flying all the way to China and get like a fucking,
you know,

207
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.740
some fucking shrimp fried rice and then just flying on to Phuket,

208
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.140
Thailand and doing whatever the fuck he did there.
You know,

209
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.720
stand next to one elephant and take a picture.

210
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.570
It's like not traveling is what the guy was saying.
So I don't know.

211
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:05.990
Am I babbling right now?
I probably am fucking jet lag too.
Um,

212
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.580
oh my God.
Did you guys see,

213
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:12.700
I'm going to try to get more into like pop culture to expand the reach of my

214
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.070
podcasts.
Oh my God.
But Donna went up at this,

215
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:21.220
this legendary gay club and showed off what some people were saying with a brand

216
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:22.270
new ass.

217
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.250
It's trying to say she got acid plants.

218
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.983
<v 0>All right.</v>

219
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.930
<v 1>And I'm like,
okay.
You know,</v>

220
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.450
why the fuck would you get a brand new ass and you're 16,

221
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.740
why would you get a new ass anyways?
I don't understand that one.

222
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.360
You know what I mean?
I'm,
I don't really understand the tits.

223
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:47.710
I don't understand taking anything and putting it in your body.

224
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:54.210
Uh,
that you can't kind of get rid of,
you know what I mean?
Shit it out.

225
00:12:54.211 --> 00:12:55.070
I mean,
you got fucking,

226
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.950
what did you know I to see what those fucking things look like.
But anyway,

227
00:12:58.951 --> 00:13:02.160
so I'm just going like,
oh my God,
she's lost her fucking mind.

228
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:07.380
And then I find out that she has a new album coming out and nobody's really been

229
00:13:07.381 --> 00:13:11.040
talking about her.
It was fucking brilliant.
I bet it wasn't even real.

230
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:16.140
I bet she just went down to a joke shop,
you know,
they're phony British accent,

231
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.880
you know,
put these fake ass in the back of me pants.
Promote me new album.

232
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.433
<v 0>MMM.</v>

233
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.080
<v 1>What's her new album's?
What's this new album called?
Tough songs about coming.</v>

234
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.240
Something about the,
some of have some about sex.
Um,
anyways,
let's see.

235
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.600
Fake ass implants.

236
00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.750
Let's see what these things look like.
Are these like,
oh my fucking God.

237
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.470
Oh my God.
What enough.
All those a tit.

238
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:59.110
But that was somebody's ass.
I'm like,
why is this so much space in the bud crack?

239
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.950
It was cleavage.
Um,
all right,

240
00:14:02.951 --> 00:14:07.720
this is just all calling out.
People would butt implants.

241
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.460
This is something that guys get blamed for it.
You know,
this is chicks.

242
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:17.490
Just this is classic chicken on chick hate and they're going to fucking,

243
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.000
they're gonna fucking trash sheets.
I want to see what it looks like.

244
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:28.150
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
What the fuck?

245
00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.650
That can't be fucking real.

246
00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.040
I don't understand why.

247
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:39.800
Why do people do shit like this to themselves because of the pressure.

248
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.990
If fucking media puts it,
is that the pressure you gave into it?

249
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.351
All right.

250
00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:48.410
This is a lot of pressure out there to have a full head of fucking wavy here.

251
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:53.930
You know,
this transparent fucking jackass doesn't give into it.

252
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:57.380
Why the fuck are you fucking blame society?
All right.

253
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:02.540
What do as implants look like?

254
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.390
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

255
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.370
<v 1>Google must be like,
oh my God,
this guy is dumb.</v>

256
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.100
I want to know what they look like.
People feel but implants.

257
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:18.020
Oh my God.
That just like those giant silicone fucking things.

258
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.890
He's fucking lazy assholes.
Just go do some squats.

259
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.170
Go do some squats and just admit that you're not fucking Jennifer Lopez.

260
00:15:30.171 --> 00:15:34.340
Whoever the fuck has the best ass right now.
Um,

261
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.710
anyways,
dude,
I should do that.

262
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.700
I've been threatening to get hair plugs right out here in eastern Europe.

263
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.520
You know,
I'm not in eastern Europe yet,
but what I consider Easter Europe,

264
00:15:45.521 --> 00:15:47.080
anything that was behind the communist block,

265
00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:49.540
when I go to fucking the other side of Berlin,
the east side of Berlin,

266
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:55.180
I'm going to get some fucking take stem cell shot in my head and I'm gonna come

267
00:15:55.181 --> 00:16:00.181
back with this ridiculous fucking lion's mane of ginger hair.

268
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:06.130
And you guys are all going to be like,
oh my God,
what the fuck did you guys see?

269
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.220
Bill's fucking hair plugs.
And eventually it'd be like,
hey man,

270
00:16:09.221 --> 00:16:12.220
he's got a new special coming out.
Gonna I'm gonna,
I'm gonna fucking,

271
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:15.940
I mean,
Madonna's the master at it,
you know,

272
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.330
I'd be lucky to stick around for half as long as she has.

273
00:16:19.331 --> 00:16:23.630
So I mean that's what you gotta do.
Maybe I should do it.
You know what guys?

274
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.020
I don't watch fight club because it triggers me.

275
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:33.040
It makes me not like my body and I just feel like Brad Pitt is just,

276
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.380
he's just,
he's,
what did they say?

277
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.230
He's just setting the bar too high.
I can't like,

278
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.360
I just don't understand why nobody calls these women out.

279
00:16:46.361 --> 00:16:51.361
Like how fucking self involved are you that you're looking at a movie star and

280
00:16:53.231 --> 00:16:56.920
you start thinking like,
Oh God,
I have to compete with that.
No,

281
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.600
no,
just appreciate compete with that.

282
00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:06.601
You're not even in the same fucking solar system is that I can throw a football,

283
00:17:06.811 --> 00:17:08.850
but I don't look at an NFL quarterback.
It'd be like,

284
00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.020
why does he have to throw it so hard?
Why does there have to be so accurate?

285
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:18.930
Um,
anyways,
um,

286
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:25.090
Jesus Christ,
the Internet,
my gut comedians from a fellow comedian,

287
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.790
please stop attacking other comedians.
What are we doing?

288
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.830
We need to circle the wagons here.
Jesus fucking Christ.

289
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:34.810
Don't comedians get enough shit.

290
00:17:34.811 --> 00:17:37.900
We're going to sit here and fucking attack each other.

291
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.320
The fuck are we doing?

292
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.980
I feel like this is like at the end of the Blair witch.

293
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.540
When those kids kept them,

294
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:51.120
ended up in the same place in the woods and they were losing their fucking
minds.

295
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:57.190
This is what's going on.
Well,
I don't,
I,
I,
for the life of me,
I,

296
00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.260
I just don't understand how a comedian could trash another comedian.

297
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.430
Um,
publicly like that.
I mean,
amongst your friends,
you guys guys a hack,

298
00:18:08.431 --> 00:18:12.390
this guy stinks,
but blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I like this guy.
You know,

299
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.440
everybody does that.

300
00:18:13.441 --> 00:18:17.640
And every fucking but the to go on there and then to actually talk about what

301
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:20.640
subjects should or shouldn't be discussed.
I mean,

302
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:21.990
there's like comedians out there.

303
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.550
They sound like Tipper Gore back in the 80s when she was freaking out about hair

304
00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:27.384
metal.

305
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:28.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

306
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:28.960
<v 1>Um,</v>

307
00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:33.760
I think there's bigger problems in the world than someone going on stage trying

308
00:18:33.761 --> 00:18:37.720
out new jokes that he's not putting out to the world.
He's just working on them.

309
00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.450
That's all that was happening.
Jesus Christ.

310
00:18:40.451 --> 00:18:42.640
I think some of the fucking Shit I've said on stage.

311
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

312
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.350
<v 1>Just fucking around.
And it leads to something,
it's,</v>

313
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:49.311
it's part of it.

314
00:18:49.311 --> 00:18:52.830
So then it's like somebody saying like listening to the first version of a hit

315
00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:55.620
song,
go,
don't make God.
That fucking sucks.
It's like,
yeah,

316
00:18:55.621 --> 00:18:56.580
well we're working on it.

317
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.290
How the fuck could somebody fucking blow everybody's acting.
Not everybody,

318
00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:06.540
but there's people out there that are acting like fucking

319
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:12.730
my God were acting like soccer moms.
It's just a,

320
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.930
it's just a fucking weird God damn time and any ways,

321
00:19:16.931 --> 00:19:21.610
it's hard enough right now to try to avoid a fucking scandal you're not even

322
00:19:21.611 --> 00:19:23.950
looking for.
We don't need to be attacking each other,
right?

323
00:19:23.951 --> 00:19:26.780
So God bless all the comedians out there.
God bless it.

324
00:19:26.781 --> 00:19:29.980
It whatever the fuck it is they're trying to do,
they're trying to be funny,

325
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.000
you know,
and let these fucking non comedians say what you shouldn't.

326
00:19:34.001 --> 00:19:37.720
You shouldn't joke about.
Let them sound stupid like that.
Jesus fucking Christ.

327
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.580
You remember Tipper Gore,

328
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.310
remember that lady way back in the day.
Pour out.

329
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.620
You imagined that.
I bet he listened to all that,

330
00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:51.840
but he listened at Motley crew and all of them back in the day.

331
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.360
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

332
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.430
<v 1>Wish I could do a fucking Algo impression.
It's sync.</v>

333
00:19:55.431 --> 00:19:59.960
Fucking kickstart my heart in the Al Gore voice.
Um,

334
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:04.670
all right,
let me,
um,
I hate to set the other night at the comedy store

335
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.183
<v 0>late night.</v>

336
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:14.210
<v 1>And I was just in a stupid mood and the piano player was laughing and I just</v>

337
00:20:14.851 --> 00:20:19.740
started playing to him and I said like two or three fucking things that I would

338
00:20:19.741 --> 00:20:23.370
never,
I would never put in a special,
I would never ever,
it was just,

339
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.790
and it wouldn't,
it wouldn't even have worked in that room at like eight,

340
00:20:26.791 --> 00:20:28.560
nine o'clock at night,
nine,
10 o'clock.

341
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.660
But once you go on the other side of midnight,

342
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.960
it just becomes like a different fucking thing.
No.
All right.

343
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.290
If anyone would have filmed that,
whatever the fuck it is,

344
00:20:39.291 --> 00:20:43.010
I was talking,
what the fuck did I talk about?
Oh,
don't say it.

345
00:20:43.011 --> 00:20:46.340
Don't say I fucking say it.
Right.
One of those sets,

346
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.390
if all of a sudden now somebody at eight in the morning is eating their toast

347
00:20:51.391 --> 00:20:54.970
and then somebody says it,
you know what I mean?
It's like,

348
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:59.170
for as much as a dick is,
I,
um,
you know,
if I go to church,
if I ever go to church,

349
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.650
go like once a fucking year when I go there,

350
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.070
I don't act the way I act at the fucking comedy store.
Nor would I.

351
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:07.620
<v 3>Okay.</v>

352
00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.560
<v 1>And I wouldn't feel like if,
if what I said at the comedy store,</v>

353
00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:14.340
I then said in a church,
if people got offended,

354
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.910
I wouldn't then feel like I was having a Lenny Bruce moment and I was fucking

355
00:21:17.911 --> 00:21:21.630
being censored.
Yeah.

356
00:21:21.631 --> 00:21:24.120
There's a time and a place for things and it's just like,
you know,

357
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.840
to just fucking
take somebody there,

358
00:21:27.841 --> 00:21:31.810
working on this shit,
doing what they're supposed to be doing,

359
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.680
and then you take it and fucking throw it in everybody's face at nine in the

360
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:36.920
morning on Twitter.

361
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:37.850
<v 3>Okay.</v>

362
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:41.830
<v 1>Because he said,
Whoa,
no fucking,
it's like Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

363
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:44.300
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

364
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.900
<v 1>I Dunno.
It's a really,
people,
just to let you know,</v>

365
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:52.990
making jokes about really dark things a lot of times is a way to avoid the pain.

366
00:21:54.681 --> 00:21:58.580
It doesn't mean you don't care about it.
That's really the way it is.

367
00:21:58.581 --> 00:22:02.690
Such like page one of comedy.
And if you don't understand that,

368
00:22:02.691 --> 00:22:06.800
then you don't know what you're talking about and you really need to stand down,

369
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.510
I think.
Anyways,
there's my little fucking 2 cents of it.
Jesus fucking Christ.

370
00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.580
I can't,
I can't fucking imagine.

371
00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.020
<v 3>Okay.</v>

372
00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.290
<v 1>I can't ever fucking imagine telling a comic what the fuck they should be saying</v>

373
00:22:18.291 --> 00:22:20.840
on stage.
Um,

374
00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.980
yet let alone trying to incite other people who aren't Comedians to fucking

375
00:22:24.981 --> 00:22:29.420
share that point of view.
Um,
if I did that,

376
00:22:29.421 --> 00:22:31.880
evidently nowadays I would be a progressive liberal.

377
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.000
It used to be the hardcore,
right?
What is going on in the world has gone mad.

378
00:22:39.001 --> 00:22:42.870
Down is up,
up is down,
black is white.
What the fuck?
All right.

379
00:22:42.871 --> 00:22:46.770
Dawlish shaped them.
And I'm not trashing anybody.
I'm just fucking say it guys.

380
00:22:46.771 --> 00:22:48.120
Don't fucking pick on each other.

381
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:52.170
We're going to get enough shit out there evidently,
um,

382
00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.780
from butthurt alley over there.
All right.
Dollar Shave Club.

383
00:22:56.781 --> 00:23:00.710
Everybody Dollar Shave Club has everything you need to look,
feel,

384
00:23:00.711 --> 00:23:04.730
and smell your best.
You never have to go to this store.

385
00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.800
If you're ever pushing a mop,

386
00:23:06.801 --> 00:23:11.801
it fucking MIT and you're fucking buddy itches and you kid fucking solve the

387
00:23:11.901 --> 00:23:15.170
math problem.
It's because you didn't use a one wipe Charlie,

388
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:20.930
a little goodwill hunting little dollar shave club there.
That's called a Mashup.

389
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.850
I believe the kids call it a Mashup.

390
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.690
That's because they deliver everything you need right to your door and they keep

391
00:23:26.691 --> 00:23:30.830
you fully stocked on what you use.
So you don't run out.
Here's how it works.

392
00:23:30.831 --> 00:23:34.130
Dollar Shave Club has everything you need to get ready no matter what you're

393
00:23:34.131 --> 00:23:38.000
getting ready for.
They have you covered.
Head to toe for your hair,

394
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.070
your skin,
your okay.

395
00:23:40.071 --> 00:23:43.400
Just say your hair and just assume that people aren't bald who are reading this

396
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.010
really triggers me.
And I

397
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.950
<v 4>really feel that everybody at Dollar Shave Club could,</v>

398
00:23:48.951 --> 00:23:53.750
you should lose their jobs so I can feel better.
Um,
your face,

399
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.220
you name it,
they have it.

400
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.343
<v 2>MMM.</v>

401
00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:02.430
<v 4>And what do you mean you name it?
They have it.
Even child pornography.</v>

402
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:04.710
I'm triggered again.

403
00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:10.380
I need Gillette to also apologize just because they make shapes stuff too.

404
00:24:10.381 --> 00:24:12.470
And when I see that it reminds me of this region.

405
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.400
<v 1>I'm sorry,
that was my impression of the 2020 around September.</v>

406
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.790
If this continues and they have this new program where they automatically keep

407
00:24:21.791 --> 00:24:23.500
you stocked up on the products you use,

408
00:24:23.501 --> 00:24:25.540
you determine what you want and when you want it.

409
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.650
And it shows up right at your dealer from what,

410
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.860
once a month to once every six months plus with their handsome discount.

411
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.920
The more you buy,
the more you save.
And Right now,

412
00:24:35.921 --> 00:24:40.480
dollar shave club has a bunch of status sets you can try for just $5,

413
00:24:40.481 --> 00:24:42.880
like their oral care kit.
After that,

414
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:48.000
the restock box ships regular sized products at a regular price.

415
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.300
Get your start,
start a set,
uh,

416
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.190

417
00:24:54.191 --> 00:24:55.330
club.com/bro,

418
00:24:55.630 --> 00:25:00.510
this is how dumb I am and how bad I was at math when I was watching goodwill

419
00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:00.881
hunting.

420
00:25:00.881 --> 00:25:05.620
They have this amazing establishing shot of MIT,

421
00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.130
some sort of giant dome,
and I didn't even recognize what it was.

422
00:25:09.131 --> 00:25:10.180
I thought they were in Rome.

423
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:13.810
I thought it was some old building and then all of a sudden he was inside

424
00:25:13.811 --> 00:25:17.860
mopping the floor.
I was like,
oh,
I guess that's what MIT looks like.

425
00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:23.170
I mean,
I'd seen it.
You drive by,
if I remember correctly,

426
00:25:23.171 --> 00:25:27.310
you could go buy it over a bridge,
isn't it?
Right off Kenmore Square.

427
00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:31.330
You go over that bridge,
but there's always tree sort of obstructing it.
You know,

428
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.833
<v 2>I dunno.</v>

429
00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.330
<v 1>Math triggers me.
Butcher box.</v>

430
00:25:36.331 --> 00:25:41.331
Everybody butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass fed and grass finished beef

431
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.630
free range,
organic chicken heritage,
bread,
pork.

432
00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:50.550
The incredible quality of butcher box meat starts with the commitment to raising

433
00:25:50.551 --> 00:25:53.400
animals humanely and free of antibiotics and hormones.

434
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.180
Cook with piece of mind knowing you weren't eating healthy,
high quality meat.

435
00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.240
Each box comes with at least eight to 11 pounds of meat,

436
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.180
which is enough for 24 individual size meals.

437
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.850
Unless you're a fucking binge eating fat,
fuck,

438
00:26:05.851 --> 00:26:10.020
then you know it's probably an overnight snack,
right?

439
00:26:10.021 --> 00:26:12.660
Going to have me 12 pork chops before I go to bed.
Ah,

440
00:26:12.661 --> 00:26:17.400
you can choose from five different box types.
All beef,
beef and chicken,

441
00:26:17.401 --> 00:26:21.900
beef and pork,
mixed box custom box,
which lets you choose your own cuts.

442
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.350
And now announcing our new brand of protein,

443
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.380
wild Alaskan Salmon.

444
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.930
This isn't just Alaskan Salmon.

445
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.520
This is wild Alaskan salmon now,
right?
You give this,

446
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:40.380
you give this fish a couple of shots.
It's shown it's tits.
I don't,
I'm sorry.

447
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.393
What's your box?

448
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:47.370
Butcher box shows they're pure sustainably harvested salmon from Bristol Bay,

449
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:51.450
Alaska.
Unlike any salmon you'll find in your local stores,

450
00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:55.010
how do you know it's from there?
They got a certain style,
a certain swagger.

451
00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.880
The way they move their tail.
Literally,

452
00:26:56.881 --> 00:27:01.530
its red color means that this salmon is as fresh as nutrient and nutrient rich

453
00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:03.660
has.
It gets,
oh yeah.
Uh,

454
00:27:03.661 --> 00:27:06.870
for $20 off your first box and two pounds of free salmon,

455
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.240
go to butcher box.com/burr and enter bur bur.

456
00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:14.540
That's butcher box.com and enter [inaudible] B u.
R.
R.
Um,

457
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.320
all right.
What am I up to?
27 minutes.
Oh Jesus.
It flies by Liverpool.

458
00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:22.290
Got Their first loss of the year.
I missed the game.
I couldn't find it here.

459
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.220
I was watching some sort of soccer over here when they had this really small
net.

460
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.970
What is that?
Indoor soccer looked like?

461
00:27:28.971 --> 00:27:32.680
It was outside and there was some sort of basketball going on and they were,

462
00:27:32.681 --> 00:27:34.340
all they were doing was speaking in German.

463
00:27:34.341 --> 00:27:38.060
Everybody was talking in German and then the crowd was chanting defense in

464
00:27:38.061 --> 00:27:41.510
English.
It's weird.
It's weird the words that come,
you know,

465
00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:49.050
I mean,
I don't want,
I guess I use blitzkrieg do I?
I don't think I do.
Um,

466
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:54.270
anyways.
Yeah.
So I've just been,
I couldn't find the fucking game.
Uh,

467
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.450
congratulations to man city.
I didn't realize,

468
00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.840
I know it was like a huge deal.
When they want an understatement.

469
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.570
A few years ago they came out of fucking nowhere and won the whole God damn

470
00:28:03.571 --> 00:28:04.404
thing.

471
00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:05.523
<v 0>MMM.</v>

472
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.930
<v 1>And I guess they handle Liverpool pretty nicely.</v>

473
00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.350
Some sort of controversial fucking goal.
I don't know what happened,

474
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.970
but the way my brain works is like,
fuck,
when do we play these guys again?

475
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.980
And we got to figure out how to beat him,

476
00:28:18.981 --> 00:28:22.490
or are we going to lose in the playoffs?
And then it's just like,
oh wait,

477
00:28:22.491 --> 00:28:24.620
they don't have playoffs.
It's just the end of the year,

478
00:28:24.621 --> 00:28:26.930
whether it has the most points,
whatever the fuck they call it,

479
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.580
which I can't quite,
do you get three points for a win and one for a decision?

480
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.540
I don't fucking know.
Dude.
I'm so fucking jet lag.

481
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.990
I just was on youtube and I think I just learned how to play snooker.

482
00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:43.220
Um,
anyways,
then did they know they don't have to fucking play?

483
00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:45.590
They could like lose to them every time they fucking play him,

484
00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.270
but still when the whole thing,

485
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:48.670
<v 0>okay.</v>

486
00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:51.210
<v 1>Makes no sense.
That makes no fucking sense.
Anyways,</v>

487
00:28:51.211 --> 00:28:55.050
I gotta I gotta kill a day tomorrow here in Cologne,
Germany.
Uh,

488
00:28:55.051 --> 00:28:58.560
what is there to do here?
Um,
is there a good sneaker store here?

489
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.520
I don't want to go to like the Adidas store.

490
00:29:00.521 --> 00:29:02.490
Is there a place where they have like a,

491
00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:04.503
<v 0>you know,</v>

492
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.680
<v 1>a bunch of different,
like,
you know,</v>

493
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:10.560
Adidas that you wouldn't get at the Adidas store,
you know,
like a,
um,

494
00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.930
a undefeated type store,
you know what I mean?

495
00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:16.300
<v 0>Okay.</v>

496
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.880
<v 1>One of those types of stores,
you know what I mean?</v>

497
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:22.230
The ones where the s the super,
super fucking crazy sneaker head,

498
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.610
tight fucking people go to.

499
00:29:23.611 --> 00:29:27.090
That's what I want to go to because I have to come back with some original shit.

500
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:32.160
I can't just come back with a pair of run DMC looking fucking shell toes that,

501
00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:35.460
you know,
my wife and kid could've got down the fucking street at the mall.

502
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:39.840
You know what I mean?
So help me out if you can send me a tweet.
All right.

503
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.590
And,
uh,
all right,
I think that's it.
Uh,
God bless you all.
Uh,

504
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.020
thank you to everybody who's coming out to my show tomorrow night.

508
00:29:55.811 --> 00:29:57.100
coming out to the shows.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.673
<v 5>MMM.</v>

510
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:03.730
<v 1>Yeah,
that's it.
Uh,
I'm really looking forward to this and uh,</v>

511
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.000
I dunno,
it feels weird to end on something positive,
but I think I'm going to,

512
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:12.440
all right,
so have a great weekend.
You can't,
and I'll check in.
I'll,

513
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:16.410
I'll talk to you on Monday.
Enjoy the music and there'll be another half hour.

514
00:30:16.411 --> 00:30:19.680
Great.
Greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon podcasts from a,
I dunno,

515
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.800
some fucking Thursday earlier this year,

516
00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.780
<v 0>boy,
uh,
years ago.
I have no idea.
All right.</v>

517
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.890
<v 4>Hey,
what's going on?
It's built per,</v>

518
00:31:19.891 --> 00:31:22.650
and it is the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

519
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.250
January 3rd,
2011.

520
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.080
Did you guys have a nice new years?
Hope you had a nice holiday.
Seriously,

521
00:31:31.081 --> 00:31:31.914
before I,
uh,

522
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:37.560
before I say country for the first time on a podcast this year,
officially,

523
00:31:37.561 --> 00:31:38.580
that one wasn't official.

524
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:44.330
That was just me stating it like in a court of law as in I s the defendant where

525
00:31:45.061 --> 00:31:49.650
he was coming from and he told me quote to go fuck myself.

526
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:54.690
See,
now that lawyer is not saying is saying the f word,
but it's,

527
00:31:54.691 --> 00:31:59.310
it's not that example.
Make no goddamn sense whatsoever.
Um,

528
00:31:59.400 --> 00:31:59.821
anyways,

529
00:31:59.821 --> 00:32:04.650
I hope you guys all have a merry Christmas and a happy new year and all that.

530
00:32:04.651 --> 00:32:09.210
Now that you're back at work,
you know,
is this a way,
this is a weird week.

531
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.090
This is another word week.
Last week was the weird depressing week.

532
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.620
Unless you're array,
uh,

533
00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.340
a college student or something or you know,

534
00:32:17.341 --> 00:32:18.900
a kid you live in at home or some shit,

535
00:32:18.901 --> 00:32:23.280
then it's great because you've got time off from school.
Everything's awesome.

536
00:32:23.281 --> 00:32:26.550
You going sledding,
right?
You make an ice balls,

537
00:32:26.551 --> 00:32:29.640
you're throwing them at the fat kid down the street,
right?
The ice ball.

538
00:32:29.641 --> 00:32:32.220
Fucking snowball,
right?
Put a nice chunk of ice in there.

539
00:32:32.221 --> 00:32:35.820
Your packet with some pottery stuff and you say,
hey,
fatty,

540
00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.800
you want to have a snowball fight,
right?
You Cute my God,

541
00:32:39.801 --> 00:32:42.890
they're finally including me.
Jesus.

542
00:32:42.891 --> 00:32:45.890
It's been so rough since July when they laughed at my man

543
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:50.680
<v 7>down at the town pool and he thinks he's included,
right?</v>

544
00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.770
I love all the mean fuck's who are laughing at this right now.

545
00:32:53.771 --> 00:32:54.604
And then what do you do?

546
00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:59.770
<v 4>Bring him over,
right?
He throws a couple of fucking Colorado snow balls now.</v>

547
00:32:59.771 --> 00:33:01.070
That powdery shit it.
Yeah,

548
00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:05.620
and then you fucking set them up like Pat Patterson when he took out the fucking

549
00:33:05.621 --> 00:33:10.621
brass knuckles when he beat Ted Dibiase for the Intercontinental Championship in

550
00:33:10.691 --> 00:33:15.660
1980 but you knew that maybe it was 81 I don't fucking remember.
Right?

551
00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:19.210
And you're fucking nail that fatty right in the side of his head.
He goes down,

552
00:33:19.211 --> 00:33:22.030
he cries half his face,
goes numb,

553
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.780
gets bell palsy from laying in that half frozen puddle and all your friends

554
00:33:25.781 --> 00:33:27.220
laugh.
You don't even help him up.

555
00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:32.790
And he's laying there and his dirty orange fucking puffy coat that he just got

556
00:33:32.951 --> 00:33:33.784
for Christmas.

557
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.730
<v 7>Where does he go?
He goes back inside.</v>

558
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.480
It's sits down and plays fucking video games until he's 36 and that's the first

559
00:33:47.641 --> 00:33:50.670
time he discovers craigslist,
you know,

560
00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.710
with a quivering voice
and trembling fingers.

561
00:33:55.711 --> 00:33:57.480
He picks up the old rotary phone.

562
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:02.250
I don't know where I'm going with this.

563
00:34:02.251 --> 00:34:03.570
I think initially I was going to make fun.

564
00:34:03.571 --> 00:34:06.880
The kids don't even do this shit anymore because they're too busy being inside

565
00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.040
playing video games.

566
00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.430
And then it just sort of spun off to a Vignette of my childhood.

567
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.800
<v 4>You know what's funny is that that whole thing never really happened.</v>

568
00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:20.090
I was on both sides of that snowball.
Jesus,
that was pathetic.

569
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:21.741
You know,

570
00:34:21.741 --> 00:34:26.460
I think it's important in life to remember that at some point you were on the

571
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:29.340
<v 7>wrong side of an ice snowball.
Um,</v>

572
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.020
am I really just going to do the mock gave voice to just get out of every

573
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.390
difficult comedy moment?
I think I'm going to,

574
00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.920
I've been doing it for the first three years of this podcast.
People,

575
00:34:39.921 --> 00:34:40.760
do you understand that?

576
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:44.390
I am basically about a year and a half away from being five years into this

577
00:34:44.391 --> 00:34:48.790
podcast and actually getting to do a reunion show with myself,
you know,

578
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:53.150
thicker head of hair,
five pounds lighter,

579
00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:58.190
just as much as a Douche.
Uh,
just as much of a Douche.

580
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:02.030
That's something a 2011.
I would like to have more sentences.
That makes sense.

581
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.140
Did you guys make any new year's resolutions?
Well,
I can't hear him.

582
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:11.090
So shut up.
What are you an idiot?
You know,
sit there and rattle them off.

583
00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.280
Look at that God damn cubicle.

584
00:35:13.281 --> 00:35:16.830
You're really going to sit in that fucking thing for another year are yeah,

585
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:19.940
that's right.
Look down and shame at your belt buckle.

586
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:24.080
That's snazzy little belt buckle that you bought that you thought would set off

587
00:35:24.081 --> 00:35:26.000
your suit.
You know,

588
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:30.290
make people see at the gas station standing there thinking that you actually

589
00:35:30.291 --> 00:35:34.580
have some sort of a fucking desk.
Well,
you could look across at somebody else.

590
00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.410
Will you wield a little bit of power?

591
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:41.750
<v 4>It's actually creeped me out.
I don't want to make somebody do something crazy.</v>

592
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.460
It's okay.
Uh,

593
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:48.680
cubicle is just a stepping stone to a cubicle that's even larger.

594
00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.480
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

595
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:51.921
<v 4>Um,</v>

596
00:35:51.921 --> 00:35:55.320
and then one day being the final three people to get the corner office and then

597
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:59.580
you realize that you've been replaced by a fucking robot.
Speaking of which,

598
00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:04.310
<v 7>I got to find this email that somebody sent me.
Um,</v>

599
00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.780
if I was organized,
I would have heard it by now.
Uh,
in the meantime,

600
00:36:08.781 --> 00:36:13.520
my goals this year is I'm finally going to rehab the fucking torn abdomen muscle

601
00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:19.310
that I,
that I fucked up at a pirates game.
Uh,

602
00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.320
I'm going on three fucking years.

603
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:27.020
Three years ago I tried to show that I could go into the pike position at 40

604
00:36:27.021 --> 00:36:29.240
years of age.
Okay.

605
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:36.050
Goddammit.
I did it,
but I didn't stretch at,
uh,

606
00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.390
I think I talked to you guys about this right after.
I did it.
God Damn it.

607
00:36:39.391 --> 00:36:44.210
I've been doing the podcast long enough.
Go back to like July of 2008,

608
00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:47.150
somewhere in there.
I went to a pirates game when I was working in the,
uh,

609
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:51.620
Pittsburgh Improv and I wanted to show off what great shape I was in.

610
00:36:51.621 --> 00:36:53.000
And here I am three years later,

611
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.440
still dealing with two and a half years later still dealing with that.
Um,

612
00:36:56.441 --> 00:37:00.670
what the hell is it?
Oh,
they are watching.
Yeah.
So anyways,
so let me,
let me,
uh,

613
00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.560
before I get into the conspiracy theory,
um,

614
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:07.850
which I took a break from in 2010 because I want it to actually enjoy my life.

615
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:11.540
Um,
yeah,
I want to Rehab it.

616
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:15.520
<v 4>Anybody can give me some web MD free advice.
C'Mon.</v>

617
00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.770
There's gotta be a personal trainer out there.

618
00:37:17.771 --> 00:37:19.660
I know when you tear an abdomen muscle,

619
00:37:19.661 --> 00:37:24.661
you supposed to rest it and then after you rest it from one to four weeks in

620
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:26.150
court,

621
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:30.500
according to my stomach hurts and I don't know why.com he's supposed to rest it

622
00:37:30.501 --> 00:37:35.390
for a one to four weeks and then begin doing some sort of Rehab,
which

623
00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:38.930
<v 7>uh,
you know,
I don't know how to do it.</v>

624
00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.410
<v 4>I found just sitting there in the plank position helps for you.</v>

625
00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:46.950
Yoga people out there.
It's sorta like the pushup position,
but you,
you're,

626
00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:51.840
you're on your forearms.
Um,
that seemed to have helped it,
but I,

627
00:37:51.841 --> 00:37:54.240
uh,
I don't know.
I fucked it up the other day and it's really frustrating.

628
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.220
<v 7>It's frustrating.
So anyways,
um,
yeah,</v>

629
00:37:57.221 --> 00:38:01.510
I went to rehab that I wouldn't want to eat better this year.
A,

630
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:05.640
I want to continue,
uh,
to not drink for as long as I can.

631
00:38:05.641 --> 00:38:09.930
I'm going for a hundred days.
I'm going for 100 days.

632
00:38:09.931 --> 00:38:13.230
In fact,
listen to this.

633
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.280
Fuckos I went to a,

634
00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:21.940
<v 4>I went to the rose bowl this year and I did not drink.
I did not drink.</v>

635
00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.600
And I know there's a lot of you who are disappointed that I didn't drink because

636
00:38:25.601 --> 00:38:29.530
you want me to fill up your life with a hilarious story of me making an ass of

637
00:38:29.531 --> 00:38:34.210
myself once again to kick off a new year.
Well,
God,
it,
I didn't,

638
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.920
but I stood around and I watched enough other people fucking do it and I still

639
00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:43.180
have plenty of stories and I got the brain cells to remember them.
Uh,

640
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.490
so fucking awesome game.

641
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:50.090
It was Wisconsin versus Tcu and uh,

642
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.680
how was like most people like who the fuck is Tcu?

643
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.460
And then you look on the program.
Let me go grab the Rosebowl program.

644
00:38:57.461 --> 00:39:02.300
Hang on one second because you guys just sit,
just relaxes.

645
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:03.930
I walk across the road

646
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:10.290
trying to find the Rosebowl program.
Oh,
here it is.
Look at this.

647
00:39:10.291 --> 00:39:11.124
I found it.

648
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:16.040
I really need to get in with an assistant on this podcast.
All right,
I'm back.

649
00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:19.640
So here's the Rosebowl program and basically

650
00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:25.610
the rose bowl this year,
if you were going to turn it into an awful,

651
00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.950
you're going to turn it into an awful made for TV movie.
This was a,

652
00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:35.540
I guess it was a story about respect.
All right.
In that,
you know,

653
00:39:35.541 --> 00:39:38.780
people barely respect Wisconsin because they never go to the rose bowl.

654
00:39:38.781 --> 00:39:41.180
I can't remember the last time they won the big 10 championship,

655
00:39:41.181 --> 00:39:45.350
but they finally won it.
They want it and uh,

656
00:39:45.351 --> 00:39:49.190
they beat the likes of,
uh,
let's,
let's see you,
let's,
let's see who they beat.

657
00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.820
All right,
let's go through their whole fucking season here really quickly.

658
00:39:52.821 --> 00:39:56.610
Stop Rolling your eyes.
You fucking commy non sports fan cunt.

659
00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.650
All right.
Start off the year they beat Unl v.

660
00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:04.550
These are the cupcake games early in the ED and they beat San Jose State,

661
00:40:04.551 --> 00:40:07.700
Arizona State.
There's a PAC 10 team.
Austin Peay.

662
00:40:07.701 --> 00:40:11.630
Who is that somebody who's name did they play?
Like one guy?
Uh,

663
00:40:11.631 --> 00:40:16.610
then they beat Michigan state,
then they beat Minnesota.
They beat Ohio state.

664
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:21.260
Right?
Big 10 Iowa.
Purdue.
You've heard of these teams?
Indiana,
Michigan,

665
00:40:21.261 --> 00:40:24.410
one of those teams.
They actually lost two,
but I went by too quickly.

666
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:28.880
Northwestern,
you know,
they played some fucking teams.

667
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:33.950
T see you on the other hand,
didn't play shit.

668
00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.950
Okay.
She down there outside of Dallas,
Texas,
Texas,

669
00:40:39.951 --> 00:40:42.530
Christian.
Oh Gee,
she's university.

670
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.040
And you wonder why no one gives a fuck about the mountain west program.

671
00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:50.410
I want you to write me and tell me just exactly.
Okay.
Oregon State,

672
00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:54.320
that's PAC 10,
that's Tennessee tech.
This is,
they're undefeated season.

673
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:59.000
They'd beat Oregon State,
Tennessee tech,
Baylor,
Smu,

674
00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:04.340
Colorado state,
Wyoming,
Byu,
air force,

675
00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.170
UNL,
V,
Utah,
San Diego State,

676
00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:12.260
New Mexico.
That was,
they're undefeated season.

677
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:16.580
And they're sitting there scratching the top of their fucking heads,

678
00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:20.870
wondering why there that people are questioning their record.

679
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.700
All right,
so here's the deal.
I'm sitting there going,
all right,

680
00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:30.410
I like this big 10 even though the big 10 isn't what it used to be considering

681
00:41:30.411 --> 00:41:33.560
they went over and five on fucking new years day,
um,

682
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.370
who doesn't like an underdog?
So I'm going,
well,
fuck it man.

683
00:41:37.371 --> 00:41:40.560
I'm going to roof for Tcu.
Even though they have Christian.
Oh Gigi,

684
00:41:40.561 --> 00:41:43.430
she's in the middle of their fucking name,
which,
you know what that means?

685
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:45.890
They automatically think they're better than everybody else.

686
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.840
And Jesus loves us best,

687
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:51.440
despite the fact that they're preaching that everybody needs to be more

688
00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:52.970
understanding like Jesus.

689
00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.420
Somehow they miss the irony of the fact that they feel like they're the chosen

690
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:59.690
ones,
like all stupid fucking religions do,
right?

691
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:03.020
Jewish people think they're the chosen ones.

692
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.730
Christians think they the chosen ones.
Muslim thinks that the,
you know what?

693
00:42:07.731 --> 00:42:11.750
You guys are all a bunch of bags.
All right?
None of you matter.

694
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.490
That's why there's so many of us.

695
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.040
If we were special than only be like nine of us,

696
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.140
once there's 7 billion of anything,
I mean,
we're about,
we're not special anymore.

697
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.880
Okay?
Do you understand that?
Well,
like socks,
you know,

698
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:31.400
actually some poor people can afford socks.
The socks,

699
00:42:31.401 --> 00:42:35.180
it's still important to some people,
you know,
and I went the fuck.

700
00:42:35.181 --> 00:42:36.350
I'm saying it's a Tcu.

701
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:41.000
They got to Fucking pee in their bonnet about how nobody's respect in them.

702
00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:45.040
So I'm sitting there,
this is before I talked to anybody from Tcu.
I just saw I,

703
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:49.400
you know,
purple and black does a decent colors.
Man,
I liked those.
Wisconsin.

704
00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:53.750
I'm looking at all these fatties from Wisconsin.
You know,

705
00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:59.540
walking around just horrible,
horrible shape.
I think when,
you know,

706
00:42:59.541 --> 00:43:04.510
when Europeans look at America and they think of the fat fucks,
you know,
I,

707
00:43:04.511 --> 00:43:05.500
I think,
I dunno,

708
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:09.800
I think they date they send away for a Wisconsin broach university brochure

709
00:43:09.801 --> 00:43:13.640
every year.
I don't know what,
because Jesus Christ,

710
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.570
those were some healthy fucking people.
All right?

711
00:43:17.571 --> 00:43:21.860
Evidently the recession has not hit Wisconsin yet because those people have

712
00:43:21.861 --> 00:43:26.720
plenty of money for extra food.
So anyway,
so I'm sitting there and,
uh,

713
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.390
we start to walk into the game,
right?

714
00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.930
Me and three of my buddies were all good and I don't name names on this fucking

715
00:43:32.931 --> 00:43:37.290
thing.
We go to walk into this goddamn thing and I start looking around after,
oh,

716
00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:40.790
after a wonderful tailgate.
We really did it up this year.

717
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:45.380
Plenty of booze,
uh,
which I did not partake in.

718
00:43:45.381 --> 00:43:49.670
I brought a 12 pack of water.
Go ahead,
email me,
call me a fag.

719
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:53.920
I don't give a fuck.
I feel great.
You fucking cunts.
Look at,

720
00:43:53.921 --> 00:43:58.040
I'm still defensive about it,
you know,
at least I'm one of those,
those,
those,

721
00:43:58.041 --> 00:44:03.020
I'm not a preachy,
sober person.
I'm not going like,
you know,
why do you do that?

722
00:44:03.021 --> 00:44:04.220
What are you,
what are you running from?

723
00:44:04.221 --> 00:44:07.250
I know why you're doing it because it's fucking fun.
And I'd still be doing,

724
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:11.030
if my head didn't get three times the size of its usual enormous size,

725
00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.350
you know my head when I'm not boozing,

726
00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.260
looks like one of the moons of Jupiter.
Okay.
I don't need,

727
00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:23.720
I don't need to continue adding to it,
you know,

728
00:44:23.721 --> 00:44:27.470
and then have it be like Pluto and then scientists can fucking debate on whether

729
00:44:27.471 --> 00:44:30.860
or not it's a fucking planet.
All right.
You fucking fucking fucking,
there you go.

730
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:35.610
See I needed the help there.
The F word for me is,
is my,

731
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.160
my uh,
uh,
what are those things?

732
00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:41.400
Is the HGH of my fucking comedy.
All right.

733
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:44.820
And I will continue to use it and I don't give a shit cause they're not banned

734
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.600
in my industry.
Um,
anyways,
so what was I saying?
Okay,

735
00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:53.260
so we had a great tailgate.
We show up.
I became in the back way this,
this,

736
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.220
this year.
All right.
We parked right along the fence.

737
00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.910
We were right near the clubhouse.
On the golf course and then you can,

738
00:44:59.911 --> 00:45:02.640
I could literally see one of the lights that lights up the stadium,

739
00:45:02.641 --> 00:45:05.010
so we were right there.
There was no way we were getting lost this year.

740
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:09.600
Actually brought a frying pan,
brought some eggs.
We had burgers,

741
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:14.550
hot dogs,
steak.
We had shit to throw in the omelets.

742
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:18.660
Cheese,
everything you want.
We had a spatula.
We brought tongs.
We had napkins.

743
00:45:18.661 --> 00:45:20.490
We had a fucking garbage bag.

744
00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:26.310
We had a grill bag of charcoal,
four bags of fucking ice to cool.

745
00:45:26.311 --> 00:45:27.240
We had every tech,

746
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:33.600
we had fucking corn chips.
We had salsa.
We had two bottles,

747
00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:36.900
a mustard,
Ho Jara fucking pickles,
ketchup.

748
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.260
We had everything we had.
We had,

749
00:45:40.261 --> 00:45:43.830
we had real forks and steak knives for the stakes.

750
00:45:43.831 --> 00:45:48.831
We had everything except for a fucking table.

751
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.740
God,
next year it's going to be the per every year

752
00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:01.490
two bottles of crown royal,
a case of fucking beer.
We we,
we will ready to go.

753
00:46:01.491 --> 00:46:04.060
We even had orange juice for the fucking eggs.

754
00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.010
We will ready to go and we forgot a God damn table.

755
00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:13.060
It's one of the ways we start the day off with one of the best fucking Omelette

756
00:46:13.061 --> 00:46:16.480
you ever going to have new year's Day sitting on a golf course on a sunny day,

757
00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:16.931
no one,

758
00:46:16.931 --> 00:46:21.370
the rest of the Goddamn country snowed in screaming at some ticket agent that

759
00:46:21.371 --> 00:46:26.080
they got to get back to Albuquerque before they yak.
You know,
shits the bed,

760
00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:30.530
right?
You forgot a God damn table,

761
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.780
which isn't bad when you eat an Omelet,

762
00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:36.050
but when you're eating a fucking stake that's an inch and a half thick that's

763
00:46:36.051 --> 00:46:39.500
been cooked at best rare,

764
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:44.810
supposed to be medium rare.
Okay?
It was,

765
00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:47.030
it was just medium rare.

766
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:51.680
What happens is you got it on a paper plate and as you use pressure to cut into

767
00:46:51.681 --> 00:46:56.420
that,
it creases in the middle and you see this puddle of,

768
00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:58.790
of,
of grease.
It just starts coming.

769
00:46:58.791 --> 00:47:00.710
It comes close to your balls and then goes away.

770
00:47:00.711 --> 00:47:04.580
Just like the tide coming in and you sitting there going,
you know,

771
00:47:04.581 --> 00:47:07.970
I really should a just drip the rest of this grease down into the grass,

772
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:12.470
kill a couple of lady bugs and then continue on with the eating process.

773
00:47:12.471 --> 00:47:14.420
But it tastes so fucking good.
You Go,
you know what?

774
00:47:14.421 --> 00:47:16.730
I think I can do it one more time and then you do it.

775
00:47:16.731 --> 00:47:20.300
And what happens if fucking rolls right off onto your jeans and you haven't

776
00:47:20.301 --> 00:47:25.280
noticed.
I don't give a fuck what you spill,
where you spell it.

777
00:47:25.281 --> 00:47:28.940
You could have your arms outstretched if you spill any sort of liquid.

778
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:33.010
It not only does it land in your Crotch,
it lands right at the head of your Dick.

779
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.040
So it always looks like you pissed you pants.
So that's what I look like.

780
00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:37.600
I had grease on the front of my pants.

781
00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.273
<v 7>Um,</v>

782
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:43.150
I mean while I'm sitting here watching all these Wisconsin fans walking around

783
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:46.720
and they got these candy striped fucking overalls,

784
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:48.970
they look like Richard Simmons shorts.

785
00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:53.680
If you fucking mugged him and cleaned out his closet of early eighties fucking

786
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.810
gay us running shorts ever.
And you somehow turned them into overalls,
you know,

787
00:47:57.811 --> 00:48:00.370
it'd be one thing of women were wearing them that be kind of hot,
right.

788
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.680
But there was a bunch of guys wearing them too.
They,

789
00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:06.760
they all look like they look like it looked like a jugglers convention is the

790
00:48:06.761 --> 00:48:09.370
best way to put it.
So I'm sitting there going,
man,
I liked the big 10.

791
00:48:09.371 --> 00:48:11.890
I want to roof for Wisconsin.
And then every once in a while,

792
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:15.430
because it seemed to be like 80%,
75%,

793
00:48:15.431 --> 00:48:19.600
maybe 70 at the smallest Wisconsin fans.
And then Tcu.
So you know,

794
00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:21.690
<v 4>who doesn't like an underdog?</v>

795
00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:22.990
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

796
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:26.130
<v 4>So I start walking towards the stadium,
right at,
uh,</v>

797
00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:30.020
I'm thinking I'm going to go for Tcu.
Fuck this.
I helped us little,
uh,

798
00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:35.060
mountain west,
whatever.
Fucking I ain't know a conference it from.
Huh.

799
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:38.910
Um,
I hope these guys win.
And uh,

800
00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.940
I start going up to the stadium and,
uh,

801
00:48:41.941 --> 00:48:45.540
one of my buddies elbows mean he turned around and he points to these Tcu fans

802
00:48:45.541 --> 00:48:49.650
in,
this guy is wearing brown loafers,

803
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.620
these light purple,
uh,

804
00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:56.220
like Corduroy Docker's with the TCU emblem.

805
00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:58.740
And then like a v Neck sweater

806
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:04.730
and like these ray bond,
fucking risky business sunglasses on.

807
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:09.010
And He,
I like if you,

808
00:49:09.011 --> 00:49:12.490
if you were casting a movie,
did you guys see Facebook?

809
00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:15.750
That Facebook is social network.
Do you know how like the Harvard guys at,

810
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.790
this is what this guy looked like?
And I was like,
oh my,
are you serious?

811
00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:20.180
<v 3>Okay.</v>

812
00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:25.180
<v 4>Is this guy and an anomaly or is this really what Tcu was all about?</v>

813
00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:29.180
And my buddy literally goes to me,
he goes,
that's it.
I'm rooting for Wisconsin.

814
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.960
You know,
I look at this fucking guy and I,
and I was sitting there going,

815
00:49:32.961 --> 00:49:35.300
you know what?
I think he's right.
Not,
don't know.

816
00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:38.120
Maybe it's just this one fucking guy.
And then I see another guy,

817
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:43.270
he has on a purple fucking blazer with gold buttons,

818
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:49.480
a white shirt,
some pleated slugs and low first,

819
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.710
<v 3>okay.</v>

820
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:51.670
<v 4>To the game.</v>

821
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:52.600
<v 3>Okay.</v>

822
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.360
<v 7>And all of a sudden I started looking at these,
this,
not all of them,</v>

823
00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:58.360
but a good 15% of them are dressed this way,

824
00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:03.490
looking like those rich kids who fucking,
you know,
uh,
air quote,

825
00:50:03.491 --> 00:50:06.130
accidentally kill their date,
you know?

826
00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:07.020
<v 3>Okay.</v>

827
00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.900
<v 7>And then they say it was consensual because she wanted rough sex too.</v>

828
00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:12.750
And that daddy has enough fucking money to get them out of it.

829
00:50:12.751 --> 00:50:16.380
That's what they started looking like.
So I'm like,
Holy Shit.

830
00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:19.560
Fuck this.
I'm out.
I'm rooting for Wisconsin.

831
00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:21.990
Now we're in the crush to get in the game.

832
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:27.560
And I look in front of me and there's this pasty fat fuck Wisconsin

833
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.890
<v 4>fan in front of me.
What the Wisconsin had turned around,</v>

834
00:50:30.891 --> 00:50:33.620
and I don't know if it was dry skin or Eczema.

835
00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:38.960
He had a perfect band of it going around the back of his,
you know,

836
00:50:38.961 --> 00:50:42.530
his hairline at the back of his head and the flakes of it,

837
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:45.890
we're on the back of his sweatshirt.
I know.
I hope you're not eating.

838
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:50.450
Okay.
So I'm looking at him gone.
Oh,
horrified.

839
00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.920
Absolutely horrified.
And then I'm turning around.

840
00:50:54.921 --> 00:50:59.921
I'm looking at these fucking slack and a sport coat wearing douchebags.

841
00:51:00.051 --> 00:51:01.850
And at that point I didn't know who I was for.

842
00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.320
I was actually hoping that during the flyover,

843
00:51:05.321 --> 00:51:09.790
one of the jets would go into the crowd and they could just start all over
again.

844
00:51:09.791 --> 00:51:14.590
It was,
it was horrific.
Worst Group of fans I've seen.
And in three years,

845
00:51:14.591 --> 00:51:18.190
granted I was sober this time and I could actually remember this.

846
00:51:18.191 --> 00:51:21.880
So I go into the stadium,
right?
And,
uh,
Lo and behold,

847
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:26.110
I'm in the TCU section,
right?
And I'm like,

848
00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.640
okay,
uh,

849
00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:33.510
I dunno if I liked this and I just didn't all signage here,
start here.
Take,
say

850
00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:36.370
this girl like three rows back.

851
00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:40.240
JCA come on frout come out

852
00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:46.660
and I go,
frogs.
They had the fucking,
I didn't know what they were.

853
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:50.410
We've got to give it to Wisconsin.
Badger is a bad ass fucking Ama.

854
00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.950
TCU horned frogs.
Okay.
And,

855
00:51:54.951 --> 00:51:56.430
and that their mascot,
look,

856
00:51:56.431 --> 00:52:00.210
I don't think it looks like something I'd like to that star wars bar scene,

857
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.300
you know,
and again,
it's called Frau come,

858
00:52:03.301 --> 00:52:08.190
I'll tacy you TCU.
And I'm looking at the girls and they,
uh,

859
00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:09.860
they,
they have their jeans

860
00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:16.210
tucked into their cowboy boots,
like they're in that band,
great white,
you know,

861
00:52:16.211 --> 00:52:20.590
and then on top they have like these dime store Dolly Parton cowboy hats on.

862
00:52:20.591 --> 00:52:25.090
And I was like,
oh my God,
I fucking hate these people.
And at that point,

863
00:52:25.091 --> 00:52:28.480
and I was sitting right in the middle of them and I immediately just became a

864
00:52:28.481 --> 00:52:31.690
Wisconsin Fan.
Now,
in defense of Tcu,

865
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:35.320
I think if I was hanging in the Wisconsin section,
I would route,

866
00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:37.150
I would have rooted for Tcu.

867
00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:38.710
<v 3>Okay.</v>

868
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:40.180
<v 4>I would have rooted for Tcu,
you know,</v>

869
00:52:40.181 --> 00:52:42.910
in the middle of me just screaming that tacy you come off frogs.

870
00:52:42.911 --> 00:52:47.200
I can't tell if Nia just laughed or the guy downstairs yelled at me,
I'll,

871
00:52:47.201 --> 00:52:48.034
that's a dog.

872
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:49.600
<v 3>Okay.</v>

873
00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.530
<v 4>Oh,
okay.
My fault.
Or it's Mel Blanc.
Um,
good.</v>

874
00:52:53.531 --> 00:52:56.270
Anybody imitate a dog barking better than that guy.
Uh,
anyway,

875
00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.880
so let's plow ahead here.

876
00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:01.750
So then I just sat there and uh,

877
00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:05.610
just was rooting for Wisconsin and I just want it and I,
and I,

878
00:53:05.611 --> 00:53:10.611
I just another thing too that's really fucking annoying about Tcu fans okay.

879
00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:16.310
Is no matter what's going on during the game,

880
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:19.800
they have a reason to fucking put their hands in the air.
See,

881
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.230
can't see the fucking game.

882
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:26.010
Anytime it was third down they had this gay little thing,
well you

883
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:28.200
<v 7>know,
you make the a I'm okay sign.</v>

884
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:33.420
They would do that signifying third down and then they would just sort of shake

885
00:53:33.421 --> 00:53:35.180
their hands like,
Ooh,

886
00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:39.480
just in case you don't know what it and everybody,

887
00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:40.860
<v 3>okay,</v>

888
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.550
<v 7>so it's like third down and anybody who watches football knows third down is a</v>

889
00:53:44.551 --> 00:53:48.840
really important fucking down as a fan who played,

890
00:53:48.841 --> 00:53:50.400
have paid a fuckload for the ticket.

891
00:53:50.401 --> 00:53:54.180
You want to see what happened and these fucking idiots are so busy going to the

892
00:53:54.181 --> 00:53:57.320
loo.
You couldn't see anything.
Then that dimension,

893
00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:02.220
there's fat whore in front of me who from the size of her should have been a

894
00:54:02.221 --> 00:54:05.940
Wisconsin fan.
But then again,
I've been to Houston,
Texas.
Okay.

895
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:08.090
Those people like their barbecue to the,

896
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:10.740
these are the people that really make America look bad.

897
00:54:10.741 --> 00:54:12.990
It's the fucking middle of the country.
You got damn people.

898
00:54:12.991 --> 00:54:15.390
I don't know what your problem is,
is because you're landlocked.

899
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:19.920
Don't they have swimming pools where you people could do a couple of laps people

900
00:54:19.921 --> 00:54:24.420
on the coasts or in shape?
All right.
Seattle.
All the way down to San Diego.

901
00:54:24.421 --> 00:54:29.220
These motherfuckers are in shape.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Ah,
San Diego.

902
00:54:29.221 --> 00:54:31.260
Go right up to coast Los Angeles,

903
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:36.960
San Francisco or Portland,
Oregon.
They're in shape.
Uh,

904
00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.060
Seattle,
they're in shape.
Vancouver.

905
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:41.070
I even leave the country and they're fucking its shape.

906
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:46.860
You start getting out there in Nebraska.
Our Wisconsin.

907
00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.513
<v 3>Huh?</v>

908
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:54.450
<v 7>Fucking people are,
are horrific other than Florida.
Florida doesn't count.</v>

909
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:57.480
All right.
Florida is a,
I don't know what it is.
It's like the ball bag.

910
00:54:57.481 --> 00:54:58.800
Everybody says it looks like a Dick to me.

911
00:54:58.801 --> 00:55:03.390
It looks like a fucking 56 year old scrotum.
Just hang in there.

912
00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:07.680
Um,
after the Dick got lopped off.
Um,
anyways,

913
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:12.180
so they handed out the like,
like them doing that third down thing wasn't enough.

914
00:55:12.181 --> 00:55:16.470
They handed out these fucking little purple like rags.

915
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:20.850
Okay.
First of all,
stealing from the Pittsburgh Steelers,
the terrible towel.

916
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:24.480
They steal that and then the on them,
it said fear the frog,

917
00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:28.230
which they stole from Maryland.

918
00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:30.630
Fear the turtle,
right?

919
00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:35.250
The first school to actually admit that they have a bad name,

920
00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.080
a bad mascot.
Fucking name.

921
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:41.910
So then what day with this fucking fat whore in front of me,
I swear to God,

922
00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:45.740
every God damn play.
Okay.

923
00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:47.780
Her fucking team would be,

924
00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:53.240
we had ends on seats were was in the other end zone at Wisconsin's 10 yard line

925
00:55:53.241 --> 00:55:56.630
trying to drive in for a score.
Okay.
They're,
they're 90 yards away.

926
00:55:56.631 --> 00:55:57.890
If you're standing on the goal line,

927
00:55:57.891 --> 00:56:01.610
forget about being 40 50 fucking rose up in the Goddamn Stan.

928
00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:05.930
And she would be sitting there
as she's talking to a friend too.

929
00:56:05.931 --> 00:56:08.200
That's what killed me.
Classic brought it again.

930
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.800
She sitting there shooting the shit.
You know,

931
00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:13.700
she probably went there for the tournament of fucking roses and she just kept
it.

932
00:56:13.701 --> 00:56:17.570
And I finally,
I tapped her on her fleshy shoulder

933
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:21.490
and she immediately took it.
As I was saying,
put it down.
I said,

934
00:56:21.491 --> 00:56:25.870
can you just wave?
Can you wave it more in your like in front of you?

935
00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:30.220
Which this is the funniest thing ever.
She does.

936
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:35.050
And immediately realizes that when she does it,
she can't see the fucking game.

937
00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:37.900
Welcome to my world.
You're fat whore.

938
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:41.170
That's what I've been dealing with for the last three fucking quarters.

939
00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:45.850
So then what she did was she then switched into her left hand.
Okay.

940
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:50.320
Because not only is she a fat whore,
she's a dumb fat whore.
Okay.

941
00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:52.810
And the first moment when I tapped her,
she was like,
oh,

942
00:56:52.811 --> 00:56:55.870
this guy must be a Wisconsin fan.
You know,

943
00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:01.250
cause he's telling me to put it down.
Then she realizes,
oh,
it's in his way.

944
00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:06.140
Did she waves it in front of her face and realizes,
oh now I can't see.

945
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:10.550
And you would think at that point light would dawn on our fucking fat head.

946
00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:14.660
And she'd be like,
oh,
I get it.
If I waved this thing,

947
00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:19.670
people behind me can't see the fucking game.
Not this fat whore,
not this one.

948
00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:23.840
She fucking puts it in the left hand and starts waving like that.

949
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.100
Like that's the solution.

950
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:29.450
Like she doesn't notice that there's another fucking 80,000 fans to her fucking

951
00:57:29.451 --> 00:57:31.010
left.
It was the worst.

952
00:57:31.011 --> 00:57:36.011
And it's times like those where I just a times like those were made for taster's

953
00:57:36.321 --> 00:57:36.840
choice.

954
00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.850
Remember that coffee just brew up a Nice Hot Pot and you just dump it right over

955
00:57:40.851 --> 00:57:43.100
a fucking head.
That's what I would've liked in a perfect world.

956
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:48.620
And as she screamed
from the scalding Burns,

957
00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:52.580
um,
she would collapse afterwards.
So maybe pass out either way,

958
00:57:52.581 --> 00:57:55.370
she would be out of my wife and I got to tell you,

959
00:57:55.371 --> 00:58:00.371
that would be the equivalent of three normal Americans who live on the coasts,

960
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:01.790
who lived near the ocean.

961
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:04.251
<v 1>Hey,
you know what?</v>

962
00:58:04.251 --> 00:58:06.410
I just realized that's how I'm going to make my million dollars,

963
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:10.250
my multimillion dollars,
so I can parachute out of this God damn business.

964
00:58:10.251 --> 00:58:14.100
I've been trying to come up with,
um,

965
00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:18.210
some bullshit that I could sell for 1995 late at night.
And I think I just did,

966
00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:22.490
you know,
I'm going to sell,

967
00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.500
I'm going to sell,
uh,

968
00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:30.650
ocean water and little salt shakers for 1995.

969
00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:35.610
That's what I'm going to do.
And I'm just going to go,
you know,

970
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:38.280
have you ever noticed how,
you know,

971
00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:42.270
people who live on the coast of this country are in shape?
You don't now,

972
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:45.000
now just show a bunch of good looking people running down the street with their

973
00:58:45.001 --> 00:58:48.960
knees nice and high,
like the Wisconsin fucking marching band,
which was the shit,

974
00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:55.170
I'm just running down the fucking street,
you know,
high step in it.

975
00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.290
And then,
uh,
the white version of high stepping,

976
00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:01.830
which is basically ringing our knees up to our waist as opposed to the Grambling

977
00:59:01.831 --> 00:59:05.370
black version where you basically,
you know,
you're,
you're,
you,

978
00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:09.120
you couldn't do it in a dome stadium because you would break your fucking toes.

979
00:59:13.110 --> 00:59:13.780
<v 2>Okay.</v>

980
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:18.730
<v 7>Whatever black people we're trying,
we're trying anyways.</v>

981
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:23.750
So,
uh,
yeah,
I would,
I would sell that and I would just say,

982
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:25.130
and then you get,
and if you know,

983
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:28.170
are you tired of being fat in the middle of the country and just so somebody has

984
00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:31.070
sent a,
been taken a bite out of it and then just looking at the camera like,

985
00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:35.090
you know,
throwing their arms up like woo,
yeah,
I am sick of being a fat fuck,

986
00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:38.180
you know,
you know,
they have sent a bunch on the east coast,

987
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:42.440
wired on the west coast.
Why aren't they fat fucks?
And I'll just,
I just spin it.

988
00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:47.560
It's because they live near the ocean and there's smelling that salt water in

989
00:59:47.631 --> 00:59:50.600
the air and I just make up a bunch of shit.

990
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:53.410
I'll pay off some fucking people in the FDA.
Uh,

991
00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:56.600
doesn't seem like a hard thing to do considering half the drugs that get

992
00:59:56.601 --> 01:00:00.110
approved nowadays,
and I'll just say it's because of smelling salt water,

993
01:00:00.111 --> 01:00:04.810
air that you're able to eat Cinnabon and shut off those fucking pounds.
And A,

994
01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.820
I'll sell it like little bottles of fucking Cologne to every fatty in the

995
01:00:07.821 --> 01:00:10.220
fucking Midwest and I'll make my money.

996
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:16.150
And then I'm going to move to Denmark and I'm going to pay 90% taxes yet have

997
01:00:16.551 --> 01:00:21.350
free health insurance and uh,
you know,
and a little vesper.

998
01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:26.620
I'm going to go around those little fucking a,
those little streets out there.

999
01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:29.380
I'm trying to put together a Scandinavian tour,
by the way this year.

1000
01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:32.830
I'm really looking forward to that.
Um,
so there you go.

1001
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:36.100
You know something like you,
I also lost interest halfway through that.

1002
01:00:36.101 --> 01:00:37.720
So that was the rose bowl for me this year.

1003
01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:39.470
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1004
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:44.450
<v 7>I didn't drink.
I had a,
uh,
I had a fucking awesome time.
I remembered the game.</v>

1005
01:00:44.451 --> 01:00:48.380
Congratulations to tasty.
Yay.
Let's go froward.

1006
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.320
Congratulations to you.

1007
01:00:51.321 --> 01:00:56.000
A horribly horribly dressed human beings just horribly dressed.

1008
01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.530
Trash,
white trash is the only way to describe what I saw it there.

1009
01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:04.580
You guys really looked like you never left the Greater Dallas area.

1010
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.313
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1011
01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:07.620
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1012
01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.870
I'm going to go out on a limb here and I'm gonna say I'm never going to get an

1013
01:01:09.871 --> 01:01:11.240
opportunity to perform at that school.

1014
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:12.103
<v 0>Cool.</v>

1015
01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.070
<v 7>And if I ever get an offer,</v>

1016
01:01:16.071 --> 01:01:19.430
I'm going to be really suspect of it thinking that they actually listened to

1017
01:01:19.431 --> 01:01:24.340
this podcast.
Oh my God.
The dime store.
Fucking
every,

1018
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.170
the woman,
women all dress like them.
That Dolly Parton movie,

1019
01:01:27.171 --> 01:01:30.020
best little whorehouse in Texas,
except they were serious.

1020
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:33.080
They probably put out my best hat for the s one.

1021
01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:36.900
I saw a guy actually took a picture of him or did they zoom into my,

1022
01:01:36.901 --> 01:01:41.120
I have some video.
I got to give it to my web guy,
um,
of this guy.

1023
01:01:41.121 --> 01:01:45.720
He was dressed in a suit with a big black Stetson looking like fucking,
uh,

1024
01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:50.250
Jr Ewing standing.
You know,
if it was the early eighties,
I would,

1025
01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.960
he would have looked good,
you know,
but it's fucking 2011,
dude,
it's,

1026
01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:55.370
it's time to let that go.

1027
01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:56.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1028
01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:59.820
<v 7>You're fucking oil man slash coke dealer.</v>

1029
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:04.650
Look from fucking 1981 30 years later,
you're still rocking.

1030
01:02:04.651 --> 01:02:08.250
That look like dead serious,
dead serious.

1031
01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:11.130
These are the kinds of people that think like there's that you can cure

1032
01:02:11.131 --> 01:02:15.540
homosexuals,
you know,
and uh,

1033
01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:19.020
you know,
like one of those countries,
singers like Nita hit,

1034
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:22.380
so they just write a song about how great America is and that too.

1035
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.890
And the fans are too dumb to see through the fact that they're just trying to

1036
01:02:25.891 --> 01:02:28.230
make money.
You know,

1037
01:02:28.231 --> 01:02:33.231
I lock America and if you don't lock it the fuck out cause it's the best goddamn

1038
01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:38.260
nation,
even though the schools are going down the shitter.
Um,

1039
01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.580
and just ignoring everything space.
Speaking of which,
I got a great

1040
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:48.370
underrated overrated here this week that somebody sent in and you know,

1041
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.840
you guys know I'm a moron,
so I couldn't put it any better than this guy.

1042
01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:57.630
Uh,
this guy says overrated.
The New Year on TV,

1043
01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.950
every fucking year.

1044
01:02:58.951 --> 01:03:03.150
All these celebrities come on and say how amazing the New Year is.

1045
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:07.080
How is it?
How is it any more amazing than the last?

1046
01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:11.490
The population is still rising and people are just getting more fucking stupid

1047
01:03:11.491 --> 01:03:15.070
and fat.
You know,
for comedic purposes,
you sort of said more fat,

1048
01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.470
more fucking fat.
And stupid,
see the alliteration,
but fucking stupid and fat,

1049
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:24.000
you know,
that's just like,
you know,
after you've gone down the roller coaster,

1050
01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:25.890
you gone down ticking the big drop that you get,

1051
01:03:25.891 --> 01:03:29.520
those little ones that don't even scare you,
those little bunny hills.

1052
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.360
But if you say more fucking fat and stupid fucking fat,
fuck,

1053
01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.160
you get two of those in a row.
That's like,

1054
01:03:35.161 --> 01:03:39.720
that's like going right down the big one.
Um,
anyways,
I'll help you out here.

1055
01:03:39.721 --> 01:03:42.690
The population is still rising and people are getting more fucking fat and

1056
01:03:42.691 --> 01:03:45.450
stupid.
The banks are still stealing our money.

1057
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:50.910
Our money spelled are our money.
And uh,
and the politicians still lie.

1058
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.690
I don't see how it is anything more than depressing and pathetic.

1059
01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:59.070
Loved your special.
Thank you.
Um,
yeah,
I agree with you.

1060
01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:02.130
100% agree with you.
Um,
to the point.

1061
01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:05.670
It's so fucking depressing that I just got a dog a couple of years ago because

1062
01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:11.100
no one else seems to give a shit.
Um,
and in that,
the line of that,

1063
01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:14.640
uh,
here's some,
here's some conspiracy theory for you.

1064
01:04:14.641 --> 01:04:17.850
Somebody said bill that they uh,
he wrote,
they are watching.

1065
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:23.400
And um,
I got trashed for talking about conspiracy theory.

1066
01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:27.930
I've been trashed for talking about those automated checkout lines in the

1067
01:04:27.931 --> 01:04:32.610
grocery store and saying that I'm paranoid and I'm afraid of technology and all

1068
01:04:32.611 --> 01:04:36.660
this.
Technology's just going to help my life and make my life more easier.

1069
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:41.520
And why don't you trust these big fucking corporations basically is to shit the

1070
01:04:41.521 --> 01:04:46.521
people who give me the same way people gave me shit for trashing the jets saying

1071
01:04:46.771 --> 01:04:48.180
that the jets,
you know,

1072
01:04:48.181 --> 01:04:51.360
haven't done anything so I don't know why they're fucking Superbowl favorites.

1073
01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:54.050
What?
Because the coach said they're going to win every fucking game.
You're not.

1074
01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:56.760
This is,
this is the best way I can sum up rex rhyming.
Rex Ryan,

1075
01:04:56.910 --> 01:05:01.350
Rex Ryan is the Tila Tequila of NFL head coaches.

1076
01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.740
Famous for nothing in particular.

1077
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.190
He's never won anything yet.

1078
01:05:08.191 --> 01:05:10.680
Everybody knows who he is in his hanging on his words,

1079
01:05:10.681 --> 01:05:13.740
like he has something to fucking say.
What?

1080
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:18.370
Cause he dropped 9,000 f bombs on Hbo.

1081
01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:19.660
He's famous for that.

1082
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:24.580
He wore a wig and a press conference and we found out he has a foot fetish.

1083
01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:28.120
Oh yeah.
Toss some right in there with chuck Noll.

1084
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:32.020
Fucking ridiculous.
By the way,
speaking of that,

1085
01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:35.800
the fuck did you know the Steelers finally looked like the Steelers?

1086
01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:38.200
I thought that they were going to look like when Rothenberger came back,

1087
01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:42.280
that is a scary ass team and I know they would just play in the browns,

1088
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:46.780
but when a Polamalu comes in,
the is playing,

1089
01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.640
it's an entirely different team.

1090
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.360
So all you jet fans out there who are excited that you beat that team.

1091
01:05:52.361 --> 01:05:55.960
I'm telling you,
that's a different fucking team.
Um,

1092
01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.990
I'm not even excited that the Patriots beat him.

1093
01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.610
<v 4>Um,
because,
uh,
I just don't think that this,</v>

1094
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:06.280
the Steelers are now starting to click add a,

1095
01:06:06.281 --> 01:06:10.060
they remind me of a certain giant team from a few years ago that no one was

1096
01:06:10.061 --> 01:06:13.510
really paying attention to and all of a sudden got hot December and Lo and

1097
01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:16.390
behold,
beat the 18 and l patriots.
So,
uh,

1098
01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:22.140
<v 7>oh.
And speaking of that,
my season long bet with Paul Versey.</v>

1099
01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:27.390
Um,
I want it,
I'm psyched.
I wanted,
uh,

1100
01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:32.960
I basically rattled off six victories in a row against the spread and put Paul

1101
01:06:33.331 --> 01:06:37.020
versary Paul Versey out of his misery.
You know,

1102
01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:41.820
the poor bastard the entire year really felt like he was gonna beat me just

1103
01:06:41.821 --> 01:06:46.680
because I had never,
I had never really gambled cause I did it like fuck it.

1104
01:06:46.681 --> 01:06:50.400
In 1989,
that's the one and only time I did it,

1105
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:52.830
I had season tickets to the patriots.

1106
01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:56.280
We made the playoffs the year before and all of a sudden we were five and 11,

1107
01:06:56.281 --> 01:06:59.910
and I was like,
fuck this.
I'm getting some of my money back for,
you know,

1108
01:06:59.911 --> 01:07:02.070
shelling out 250 bucks for seasons

1109
01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:05.290
<v 4>tickets.
That's what you could get back in the day before ESPN.</v>

1110
01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:08.710
Overhyped every sport and people who don't even like sports or going to games

1111
01:07:08.711 --> 01:07:11.380
now.
So,
uh,

1112
01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:13.971
yeah,

1113
01:07:13.971 --> 01:07:16.670
I wanted to get some of my money back and I remember the buffalo bills right

1114
01:07:16.671 --> 01:07:20.120
before they became the buffalo bills.
They had all those guys,

1115
01:07:20.121 --> 01:07:24.550
they were a year away from going to their first super bowl.
Um,

1116
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:29.200
four in a row when it for AFC championships in a row,

1117
01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:32.440
one of the most underrated accomplishments ever.
You know,
basically cause it got,

1118
01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:36.670
cause he lost four Superbowls in a row.
So I mean what do you expect?
But anyways,

1119
01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.150
I decided to bet the fucking buffalo bills that year.

1120
01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.630
This is off on memory.
This is what gambling does.

1121
01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.990
And I remember that was the one fucker week that Goddamn patriots showed up at

1122
01:07:46.991 --> 01:07:48.640
one the game.
So I couldn't even enjoy it

1123
01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.300
and I lost like 50 bucks,

1124
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:56.920
which when you're only making 125 a week is a tremendous blow.

1125
01:07:58.330 --> 01:07:59.440
So I never bet again,

1126
01:07:59.441 --> 01:08:03.520
I never gambled against the spread for like until this year they had Paul Versey

1127
01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:05.440
who you know has been doing it for years.

1128
01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:09.860
<v 7>Dude,
I called in,
I did this,
I did that.
You got beat by it.</v>

1129
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:11.110
<v 4>Goddamn nerd.</v>

1130
01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:16.040
I'm just breaking your balls park cause I know you're listening.
I know you'll

1131
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.140
<v 7>listen to it.
All right.
So they had golf.</v>

1132
01:08:20.190 --> 01:08:22.590
I almost went 500 for the year against the spread,

1133
01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:26.460
which from what I've been told is,
is,
is pretty goddamn decent.
So yeah,

1134
01:08:26.490 --> 01:08:31.240
I'm patting myself on the back.
Uh,
anyways,
let's plow ahead here.
Um,

1135
01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:33.190
so I have to get trashed for all,
you know,

1136
01:08:33.191 --> 01:08:34.960
talking shit about all these corporations.

1137
01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:36.090
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1138
01:08:36.090 --> 01:08:38.580
<v 7>And actually having the audacity to think that bankers,</v>

1139
01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:43.581
we're all trying to team up and have one world bank yet out to become the loan

1140
01:08:43.831 --> 01:08:48.450
sharks for not everyone,
not only individual,
but actual countries.

1141
01:08:49.830 --> 01:08:50.663
Okay.

1142
01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:55.440
Which is something that I was thinking about when I was at the Rose Bowl stone

1143
01:08:55.441 --> 01:08:59.400
sober and I was sitting there on the golf course and I was looking at these

1144
01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:00.420
houses up on,

1145
01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:05.280
up on the ridge of this hill that actually looked down on,

1146
01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:07.200
on the Rose Bowl,
the grand daddy of them.

1147
01:09:07.201 --> 01:09:09.600
All these people have a house that looks down on it.

1148
01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.980
And I was actually envisioning that those were all bankers up there.

1149
01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:19.670
And while the game was going on and 104,000 people or 96,000 we ever showed up

1150
01:09:20.191 --> 01:09:22.290
for that game was sitting there going fucking crazy.

1151
01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:25.600
One of those pieces of Shit bankers up there,

1152
01:09:25.601 --> 01:09:27.900
it could put his hand on his son's shoulder and be like,

1153
01:09:27.901 --> 01:09:31.080
see all those people down there,
they owe all of us money.

1154
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:33.270
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1155
01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:37.890
<v 7>They all owe me money,
son.
I'm getting a piece of all of their fucking paychecks.</v>

1156
01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:39.023
And they don't even know it.

1157
01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:43.710
They don't even know that their daddy is looking down on him right now.

1158
01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:45.870
Now had it been drinking,

1159
01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.200
that thought would have probably caused me to,
uh,
you know,

1160
01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:55.530
entertain the thought of climbing up that hill and throwing a rock through one

1161
01:09:55.531 --> 01:09:55.981
of the windows,

1162
01:09:55.981 --> 01:09:58.620
which of course I wouldn't have done it because even my drunkest I am,

1163
01:09:58.621 --> 01:10:03.150
I am aware that I don't want to go to jail and get raped.
And secondly,
I really,

1164
01:10:03.151 --> 01:10:04.710
I'm not going to go all the way up that fucking help.

1165
01:10:04.711 --> 01:10:08.000
So what I would have done is I probably would have yelled at that kid with the

1166
01:10:08.001 --> 01:10:12.530
light purple slacks.
I would've commented really loud about that dude's fucking,

1167
01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.010
uh,
Eczema flaking off into the back of his God damn sweatshirt.

1168
01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:20.600
Um,
so anyways,
this guy sends me this email and he says,

1169
01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:25.160
build the vase in this blog.
When I say they are watching our big business,

1170
01:10:25.161 --> 01:10:29.060
not the Illuminati,
but they are just as evil as any bank or secret society,

1171
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.930
<v 3>okay?</v>

1172
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:32.510
<v 7>They don't even need your signature.
Listen to this shit.</v>

1173
01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:37.640
They don't even need your signature for these information gathering trader where

1174
01:10:37.641 --> 01:10:42.560
programs to monitor everything from where the device is to what your heart rate

1175
01:10:42.561 --> 01:10:47.520
is.
Thanks for giving me something to look forward to on Mondays.
Also,

1176
01:10:47.521 --> 01:10:50.940
I like your Christmas tree.
You should turn it into a walking stick.

1177
01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:56.190
Now that the holidays are over,
you guys are so dumb.
You guys are buying shrubs.

1178
01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.680
Do you realize that?
Look out your window and look at trees.

1179
01:10:58.681 --> 01:11:00.750
You can see the trunk.
You dumb fucks.

1180
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:08.480
It's like,
you know,
you're morons.
Look at a shrub.
Can you see that?
You can't.

1181
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:12.530
You're buying shrubs that are pruned into the shape of Christmas tree.

1182
01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:14.010
I had the information from an

1183
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:17.670
<v 4>actual fucking guy last week.
All right,
I bought a Christmas tree.</v>

1184
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:20.850
You brought a Christmas shrub.
Should go fuck yourselves.

1185
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:22.950
But I liked this guy because he sends me this.

1186
01:11:22.951 --> 01:11:26.420
What is trader where that's the question I had.
Um,

1187
01:11:26.421 --> 01:11:31.421
you digital camera may embed metadata into photographs with cameras,

1188
01:11:31.861 --> 01:11:34.440
serial number or your location.

1189
01:11:34.441 --> 01:11:38.310
Your printer may be incorporating a secret code on every page at prince,

1190
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.660
which could be used to identify the printer and potentially the person who used

1191
01:11:42.661 --> 01:11:46.800
it.
Now,
now the fucking morons,
the sheep out there,
it'd be like,
yeah,

1192
01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:51.510
that's in case she threatened the president that just doing it for the good of

1193
01:11:51.511 --> 01:11:56.130
all people.
Um,
if apple puts a particularly creepy patent,

1194
01:11:56.430 --> 01:12:00.820
I guess Apple's applying for this as a recently applied for the use,
um,

1195
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.891
for,
um,

1196
01:12:01.891 --> 01:12:06.450
you can look forward to a day when your iPhone may record your voice.

1197
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:10.380
Take a picture of your location,
record your heartbeat,

1198
01:12:10.381 --> 01:12:13.200
and send that information back to the mothership.

1199
01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:18.510
This is trade aware devices that act behind your back and portray,

1200
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:23.100
portray your privacy.
Now,
this is what the moron sheep are going to be to say,

1201
01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:27.810
well,
if he ain't doing nothing wrong,
what's the problem?

1202
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:31.140
That's,
that's the philosophy.

1203
01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.290
That was the philosophy behind why they can record your phone calls.
Now,

1204
01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:39.330
if he ain't doing nothing,
we're tacy you come out frogs.

1205
01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.980
He ain't doing nothing wrong.

1206
01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:47.350
Do you realize how fucking dumb that mindset is?

1207
01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:53.580
So basically as long as you do what the people in power tell you what to do,

1208
01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:55.600
you won't have a problem.

1209
01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:59.320
Do you understand how dangerous that is?

1210
01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:06.000
Do you want to stay on how fucking stupid it is to have that level of faith in

1211
01:13:06.001 --> 01:13:08.940
the people who rule you?
You know what I mean?

1212
01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:16.550
You haven't noticed how much power can fuck somebody over.

1213
01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:20.300
Like for some reason we only seem to focus on when celebrities get famous and

1214
01:13:20.301 --> 01:13:23.660
then they wig out and start becoming these fucking mini tyrants.

1215
01:13:23.661 --> 01:13:28.661
For some reason people don't feel they just have like this because they wave the

1216
01:13:28.761 --> 01:13:29.900
flag and they,
they,

1217
01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:33.770
and they play those songs that make you choked up that they never feel like that

1218
01:13:33.771 --> 01:13:36.170
they'll have any sort of ulterior motive for this.

1219
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:41.350
This is the type of technology that allows a small group of people to take over

1220
01:13:43.881 --> 01:13:44.714
the world.

1221
01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:50.740
Something that's sociopath's have been trying to do since the beginning of time

1222
01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:55.820
and they were never able to do it because at some point your army would be

1223
01:13:55.821 --> 01:14:00.440
stretched too thin,
right?
Germans,

1224
01:14:00.441 --> 01:14:04.070
the fucking Roman empire,
all that shit.
At some point the fucking Japanese,

1225
01:14:04.071 --> 01:14:06.290
all of them,
everybody who's ever tried to fucking do it,

1226
01:14:06.291 --> 01:14:10.790
at some point it gets stretched too thin.
So America,

1227
01:14:10.791 --> 01:14:15.110
what we've done is we,
then,
we,
we've,
we've done the,
uh,

1228
01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.540
we're putting this base here to protect you thing,
that brilliant thing.

1229
01:14:19.541 --> 01:14:24.070
That's how we got our world empire.
So we just have a base.

1230
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.340
Then also we have these insane weapons where we can nuke everybody.

1231
01:14:27.341 --> 01:14:29.890
So we were able to kind of do it that way.
But the problem is,

1232
01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:33.010
is when you really get into sociopathic thought,

1233
01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:38.940
and just like those people who are so into power that it makes that Deckard is

1234
01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:43.780
they want to know,
they want to be able to see everybody,

1235
01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:48.580
know what they're thinking and know what they're doing at all times because not

1236
01:14:48.581 --> 01:14:49.391
only they psychos,

1237
01:14:49.391 --> 01:14:53.230
but with that level of power becomes this unbelievable level of paranoia.

1238
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:57.010
Like those people with those houses sitting on the ridge looking down into the

1239
01:14:57.011 --> 01:15:00.520
rose bowl,
there's a fear,
like we sit there,
look it up and go,
look,

1240
01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.600
they got the fucking world.

1241
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:06.700
There was a fear of when you attain that level of wealth,
of losing all of it,

1242
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:10.740
and you,
you begin on this,

1243
01:15:10.741 --> 01:15:15.040
this quest to quiet your mind,
you want,

1244
01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:20.041
you want to get a level of wealth and controlling your life that you are

1245
01:15:21.071 --> 01:15:26.071
guaranteed that it will never go away in your lifetime or your kids' lifetime or

1246
01:15:26.651 --> 01:15:27.520
your kids' kids.

1247
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:32.050
So basically everybody that you know and love will be okay and you will be okay.

1248
01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:37.480
You get into that psychotic fucking mindset and uh,

1249
01:15:37.570 --> 01:15:41.520
<v 7>you give those kinds of people this level of fucking technology and you're going</v>

1250
01:15:41.521 --> 01:15:45.600
to have a problem.
I think that's unbelievable.
But that this shit is,

1251
01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:48.350
so they have this,
this website here,
uh,

1252
01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:52.010
the eff electronic frontier foundation that is trying to fight

1253
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:57.750
these things being put into,
into the,
the tech,
you know,
the cameras,

1254
01:15:57.930 --> 01:15:59.400
the cell phones and all that shit.

1255
01:15:59.401 --> 01:16:03.060
Like the fact that there's a tracking device in your cell phone.
Like,

1256
01:16:03.090 --> 01:16:04.710
how come we didn't get to vote on that?

1257
01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:08.230
How come we don't get to vote on that type of stuff?

1258
01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:12.040
I don't want people knowing where the fuck I am and all God damn times.
Okay,

1259
01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.050
and I don't need you to show me,
Oh,

1260
01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.680
we caught this fucking child molester with that.
So because of that,

1261
01:16:17.681 --> 01:16:21.760
now everybody has to be like,
give me a fucking break.
They always have like,

1262
01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:23.770
you know,
that there's,
you know,

1263
01:16:23.771 --> 01:16:27.550
a handful of good examples for that level of fucking control and then does a

1264
01:16:27.551 --> 01:16:31.840
zillion bad ones.
So I am 100% against the shit.

1265
01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:37.390
And,
um,
there's always been evil people in the fucking world.

1266
01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:41.770
There's always going to be evil fucking people in the world.
And when you get,

1267
01:16:41.771 --> 01:16:45.250
when you have this kind of technology that you're going to,
you're going to stop.

1268
01:16:45.251 --> 01:16:46.720
They're going to stop small,
evil,

1269
01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.930
<v 4>like individual,
you know,</v>

1270
01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.970
a fucking a serial rapist.
What?
You definitely want to stop,

1271
01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.433
all right?

1272
01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:01.860
But the price we're going to pay is you're going to allow a Stalin or a Hitler

1273
01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:06.550
Pol Pot,
whoever the fuck you wanted that you're going to you with that level of

1274
01:17:06.551 --> 01:17:09.680
technology,
someone like that could get in power

1275
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:14.240
<v 7>and run the fucking world.
So,
you know,
I dunno</v>

1276
01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:15.161
<v 4>and I,</v>

1277
01:17:15.161 --> 01:17:19.320
I totally 100% believe that you could roll all your fucking eyes all you want.
I,

1278
01:17:19.321 --> 01:17:21.060
I,
I honestly believe that.

1279
01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:25.230
And I also believe that the reason why there's so many of us right now and that

1280
01:17:25.231 --> 01:17:28.110
the people at the top are not fucking concerned about it,

1281
01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:29.580
<v 3>okay.</v>

1282
01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:33.570
<v 4>Is because we're all expendable.
And when the waters rise up,</v>

1283
01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.520
the temperatures goes up and everything,

1284
01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:37.260
they're not going to be the ones who are drowning.

1285
01:17:37.261 --> 01:17:40.890
You can guarantee that the user in our taxpayer money to build some sort of

1286
01:17:40.891 --> 01:17:43.350
something to make sure that they're okay.

1287
01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:46.800
And I think that their bailout plan because they know they can't stop people

1288
01:17:46.801 --> 01:17:47.431
from fucking,

1289
01:17:47.431 --> 01:17:52.431
because it feels too God damn good and Dixon pussies are readily available to

1290
01:17:52.651 --> 01:17:54.900
anyone.
It's like air,
you know?

1291
01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:56.490
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1292
01:17:56.490 --> 01:18:00.450
<v 4>So I think what they're going to gradually do is phase us out with robots and</v>

1293
01:18:00.451 --> 01:18:04.200
automated shit,
which is why I refuse to use it now.

1294
01:18:04.201 --> 01:18:05.970
How fucking crazy do I sound right now?

1295
01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:09.360
Has there been anything funny in the last fucking five?

1296
01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:10.860
This is shit that I truly believe.

1297
01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:12.140
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1298
01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:15.200
<v 4>You know corporations own like the DNA of a grizzly bear.</v>

1299
01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.980
That's why they don't give a fuck that they're cutting down its habitat.

1300
01:18:18.981 --> 01:18:21.950
They're like,
I will fucking grow another one in a petri dish.

1301
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:27.490
<v 7>We're trying to take over everything and then wipe out.</v>

1302
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:31.900
I think they're going to try to wipe out the poor and the middle class keep a

1303
01:18:31.901 --> 01:18:35.080
couple of us,
like a small handful of us.
You know,

1304
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:39.220
the way that pandas are only in like a Zeus at this point or some shit.

1305
01:18:39.610 --> 01:18:41.780
I don't know.
Maybe I picked the wrong fucking animal,
but that,
that,
that,

1306
01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:45.460
that's the direction I think it's going.
All right.
This your first crazy rant,

1307
01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:50.930
which was based mainly in gut feelings in a couple of emails.
But,
um,

1308
01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:55.260
I truly believe that,
and I browsed through enough,

1309
01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:58.290
enough history,
a Cleo,
what's up.
