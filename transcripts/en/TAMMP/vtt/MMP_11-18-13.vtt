1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.670
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.671 --> 00:00:05.430
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:09.390
November 18th,
2013.
How the hell are you?

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.350
How's it going?
I'm going to try to fuck an energy my way through the energy.

5
00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:18.430
We to find a Samsung.
A new,
can I fuck up?
Ooh,

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.870
I'm wiped out.
Why you wiped out pill?
You,

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.810
all you do is jump around like a fucking monkey on stage.

8
00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:29.230
That's what you do for your money,
for your legal tech.

9
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.770
Uh,
well,
you know what?
I've been doing it in every fucking state,

10
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.350
the Goddamn Union this year and I'm wiped out.

11
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:42.120
I'm officially wipe the fuck out.
I had a 6:20 AM flight out of Wichita,
Kansas.

12
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:47.020
Hey,
why do we have ourselves bar murder down their last name and,

13
00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:47.440
uh,

14
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.380
landed here at seven 38 and I'm one of those little ass fucking planes because

15
00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:56.260
nobody goes to Wichita.
Not Directly.
Anyways,
so I was on a little last plane.

16
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.590
We landed in a little last plane and you know what happens?
A little less planes.

17
00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:02.320
They don't get to pull up to the gate.
Aw,
you're too small.

18
00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:04.600
You're going to hurt yourself little last plane.

19
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.780
So we're sitting out there on the fucking champ,
right?

20
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.100
It's an old school playing.
They tried to paint it like a new United plane,

21
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:18.780
but they still had the you that was from um,
you know,

22
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:22.050
like the 70s was a fucking old ass plane.
Okay.

23
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.680
I don't know if they took it over to gas monkey garage and they put a new

24
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:27.690
fucking engine in it.
I don't know what,
but we made it,

25
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.530
but it was one of those deals where they open the door and the stairs are part

26
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:32.520
of the fucking door.

27
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.660
We walk out of that and then we get on the Goddamn plane,

28
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.180
a plane,
a bus bus to the fucking airport.
The hub within the bags came up.

29
00:01:43.181 --> 00:01:45.990
Oh Shit.
So I am,
uh,
but you know something.

30
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.420
I completed the red state tour.
All right?
It was supposed to be a nice,

31
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.450
wonderful summer jaunt through the red states of this country,

32
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.720
through some of them.
By the way,
there's a lot of people giving me shit.

33
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:02.460
Go in Nebraska.
Nebraska's a red state too.

34
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.140
I was a red states of fucking red state.
You know what?
Go Fuck Yourself.
Okay.

35
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:08.220
I got something for you.

36
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.510
I get some for you can't out there who keep giving me shit?

37
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:14.940
Why don't you fucking come to my,
what do you got against my fucking state?

38
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.830
What do you got against coming to one of my,

40
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:26.760

62
00:03:38.691 --> 00:03:43.030

Tired.
Don't get,

71
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.430
don't get the whites best in with the colors.
Um,

72
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.540
anyways,
whatever.
This podcast is going to suck,

73
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.330
but maybe it's going to be enjoyable because of how much it sucks.
Uh,

74
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.230
yeah.
I don't know what the fuck I'm going to talk about this week.
Let's,

75
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.640
let's get,
let's get right into a little bit of a,

76
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.130
my tour.
I'll just call it 15 audible's.
As I was saying that,

77
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.730
dragging that sentence out,
let's get into a little,
by the way,
you know,

78
00:04:47.731 --> 00:04:49.740
right now and run,
he's supposed to be doing this podcast.

79
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.770
I'm supposed to be talking to somebody from Reykjavik and I gotta tell you

80
00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:56.250
Iceland.
Well,
the first guy had water damage.
I called them up.

81
00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:59.040
It sounded like it just happened.
So we're rescheduling that one.

82
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.610
And then the other dude at 10 30,
I don't know what happened,
man.

83
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.100
I'm sitting here on the other side of the world,

84
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.240
eagerly awaiting your phone call.
And what do I get?
I get nothing.

85
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.760
You know what somebody told me when I go over to that beautiful country of

86
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:17.470
Iceland,
you know,
that country that stood up to the bankers,

87
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.610
that country that I can't wait to go see somebody said it smells like sulfur

88
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.350
because of that.
Uh,
that volcanic eruption there,
volcanic,

89
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.270
the volcano eruption.
Um,

90
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.790
remember that one that blocked all the flights to and from Europe a few years

91
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.110
ago.
It still smells like sulfur over there.
And,
uh,
I dunno,

92
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.980
I think that's kind of fucking cool to be that close to a live volcano.

93
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.230
Um,
I can't fucking,

94
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.560
that's one of the ones I'm really looking forward to that because,
uh,

95
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.590
on that trip over there,
I,
that's the country I haven't been to yet,

96
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:55.230
so I don't give a fuck what it smells like.
I heard the women are beautiful.
Ah,

97
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.460
they stuck up to the banks and they fucking live right next to a volcano.

98
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.890
They don't give a shit.
So thumbs up to Iceland.

99
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.760
I can't wait to go and I think I'm actually going to get to see the northern

100
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:08.450
lights,
you know,
stand there with a little tear in my eye,

101
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.280
wondering why humanity can't get along.
Um,
so anyways,

102
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.820
I,
I did,
uh,
the rest of the red state tours,
uh,

103
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:20.030
dates and um,
you know,

104
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.290
I know it was crazy as far as like,

105
00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:24.420
it didn't come off the way I've thought it was going on,

106
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.140
but I honored every fucking date and I added San Antonio.

107
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.720
All right.
We made them happen.

108
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.350
El Paso took three times to get to three trips.

109
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.090
One time I canceled cause I'm a little twinkle toes doing my acting work.

110
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.710
The next time it got rained out.

111
00:06:40.711 --> 00:06:43.650
And then finally we made it happen and I got some angry emails,

112
00:06:43.651 --> 00:06:45.990
but in the end we made it happen.
So anyway,
so I go to deadwood,

113
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.310
South Dakota in the black hills,
the western part of South Dakota.
And uh,

114
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.150
I had a fucking awesome time.
Highly recommended.

115
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.300
I went and I actually saw a Mt.
Rushmore,

116
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.350
scratch that off the bucket list.
Um,

117
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.960
and I highly recommend that you go during the winter months because I could just

118
00:07:06.961 --> 00:07:11.250
tell it would be fucking packed with a bunch of God damn breeders with their

119
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.430
fucking gene cutoff shorts.

120
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.930
As I was walking up all the stairs and nobody was on you that nobody was on.

121
00:07:18.931 --> 00:07:21.330
I could just,
I said to the guy who brought us over there,
I was like,
dude,

122
00:07:21.331 --> 00:07:24.450
this place is packed in the summertime.
He's like,
Oh yeah,
man,
it's awful.

123
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.990
It's awful.
So go there in the winter,
nice,
crisp air,
whatever the fall,

124
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.910
whatever fuck season we're in right now.
That's the time to go.
Toughen up.

125
00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:37.820
You fucking kids.
Pull them out of school and bring him there.
All right.

126
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.020
Start up the Winnebago once over the winter or in the fall by that.

127
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.080
I can get the thing up there.
I'm telling you,
it's great.

128
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.050
We did the whole God damn thing and like 20 minutes.

129
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.480
You know what's great as you come up the hill.

130
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.160
I'm literally miming this with my hand,

131
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.430
like driving my head towards my face in case I forget what it's like to drive up

132
00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:58.200
a hill.
As you're driving up a hill,

133
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.200
you come up all the way up the mountain there,
right?
Or The hills I guess.
And,
uh,

134
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.210
all you see,
just look out and I swear to God,

135
00:08:06.211 --> 00:08:09.060
you can see all the way to Wyoming and you're like,
what the fuck?
Where is it?

136
00:08:09.061 --> 00:08:13.350
And then you just come around a turn in the way they do it is so fucking cool.

137
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.110
They show you what the four presidents are looking at and then you turn around

138
00:08:19.111 --> 00:08:23.310
and you're like,
holy fuck.
There it is like a God damn horror movie.
You know,

139
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.250
you think the guys behind the curtain and he's not there and you're like,

140
00:08:26.251 --> 00:08:29.050
oh good.
And yet,
yeah,
you relax.
You let out that exhale,

141
00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:31.410
he turned around La Jesus Christ for dead presidents.

142
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.063
<v 1>You know,</v>

143
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.160
<v 0>if you know for the life of me,
I always wondered why they picked those four.</v>

144
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:42.870
Not even those four.
Why Teddy Roosevelt?
You know,

145
00:08:42.871 --> 00:08:46.410
I understood malarian curly,
but I didn't get SCHEMPP.

146
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.180
Why the fuck is he up there?

147
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:49.843
<v 1>You know,</v>

148
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.770
<v 0>I didn't understand it was another good reference.</v>

149
00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.890
Okay.
David Lee Roth,
Sammy Hagar,
and then that dude from that,

150
00:09:00.891 --> 00:09:04.560
that band,
if you doll lie,

151
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.420
what we do here?
Get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out.

152
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:13.800
Get the fuck out.
Shut up.
Whoa,
whoa.

153
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.180
Oh my God.

154
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:21.810
I never want to drag somebody down the fucking stairs by their ponytails.

155
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.320
As much as when that fucking Sean came on.
Um,

156
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.800
anyways,
Teddy Roosevelt.
So I was,
I asked the guy there,
why did they,
why Teddy?

157
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.540
I don't see the fucking connection here.
It's like a bad standup tour.

158
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:39.760
What do you get?
Three styles that Mesh and then just one guy has got,
I dunno,

159
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.780
a fucking Ukulele and I guess they were all responsible for the expansion

160
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.080
expansionism of this country,
George Washington,

161
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.680
because he helped us with our conspiracy theory,

162
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.930
that theory or conspiracy to fucking leave the God damn,
uh,
English empire.

163
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.490
All right.
Which started,
it does not really expanding that sort of separating,

164
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:06.660
but who the fuck am I?
Uh,
Thomas Jefferson,

165
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.430
Louisiana purchase.

166
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>

167
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.000
<v 0>Oh my God,
I'm gonna forget who else was there.
Oh,
Abe.
Abe Lincoln.</v>

168
00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.170
Abraham a tray as his friends call him.
Uh,

169
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.650
cause he held the union together.
Um,

170
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.380
and then Teddy Roosevelt,
because he,
uh,
was brutally racist.

171
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.450
It was able to,
uh,
kick all the Mexicans out of the western part of this country.

172
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.030
You know,
that's a really weird part.

173
00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.450
I gotta tell you this really weird part of the country.
Uh,
South Dakota.

174
00:10:37.451 --> 00:10:41.680
Absolutely fucking beautiful,
but it's kind of like,

175
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.330
I feel like what Germany would look like if the Germans won the way history is

176
00:10:48.431 --> 00:10:52.960
told.
You know what I mean?
I mean,
that is,

177
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.490
you're basically on a holocaust ground out there,

178
00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.550
but because you know,

179
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:06.500
the fucking evil doers one,
just the way it's,
you know,

180
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.540
you can go visit Custer's last stand and they have like,
you know,

181
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.840
grave sites for all these fucking mass murdering psychopath.

182
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.480
<v 2>Okay.</v>

183
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.380
<v 0>But you know,
they won.</v>

184
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.320
So it's all like done.
Yeah.
Yeah.

185
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.070
So like basically if Hitler and those fucking maniacs one,

186
00:11:28.071 --> 00:11:31.310
there would be a mount Rushmore in Germany and it would be Hitler.

187
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:36.170
It'd be a,
who is that guy?
Heimlich claim Miller,
whatever the fuck his name is.

188
00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:39.920
Basically his Scottie Pippen.
Right.
And they'd have a couple other,

189
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.870
all his fucking Evil Nazi dudes,
I dunno where they would be facing,

190
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.650
but whatever.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't go out there.

191
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.390
It's absolutely fucking beautiful.

192
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.970
And I had a great time performing at the casino.
I met some real live cowboys,

193
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.180
real life cowboys,
got invited to go back to a ranch.

194
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:01.750
Next time I'm out there for some quick draw shooting with fucking wax bullets.

195
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:06.010
What'd you do this fucking weekend?
I already asked him.
I go,

196
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:08.350
what do you mean wax?
We should like shoot him at each other.
And they're like,

197
00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:10.990
laugh.
And they go,
no,
you shoot them into a target.
I go,

198
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:14.860
what happens if you get hit with one?
They got strings.
It's not that big a deal.

199
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.590
So in my head I just started laughing because I was like,
all right,

200
00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:19.240
back in the day,
me and my knuckle head friends,

201
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:21.250
if we got wax bullets and they're not going to kill you,

202
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.530
we're going to put on swimming goggles,
possibly a scuba mask.
And you know,

203
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.390
within 20 minutes we're going to be fucking shooting at each other.
Um,

204
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.290
and I guess if you go there in the summertime,

205
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.890
you see bald eagles out there like the pigeons.

206
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.050
So that's another reason to come back.

207
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.270
What I'm saying is I'm definitely coming back to deadwood,

208
00:12:42.271 --> 00:12:45.690
Ida fucking phenomenal,
phenomenal time.

209
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.690
And uh,
learned a little bit about him,
American history and that type of stuff.

210
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.370
And uh,
then the next day it had an early flight.
I flew down to Tulsa,
Oklahoma,

211
00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.860
and uh,
had no idea what to expect.
We drove into town,
me and Lucas.

212
00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:04.910
Now you see Lee,
now you don't Lucas Seely um,

213
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:10.340
his football nickname but never happened.
They called him the Orient Express,

214
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.500
I believe,
or the Asian invasion.
I forget what he grew up in Montana.

215
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.040
He's like one of three Asians out there.

216
00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:19.070
So the white people didn't know any better.
Um,

217
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.890
so what am I saying here?
So we own a fucking Tulsa and it's like,
uh,

218
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.370
I don't know.
It's like a Zombie movie.
There's like nobody there.

219
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:32.810
It's windy as fucking hell.
Cause there's nothing to stop.
The God damn wind.

220
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.970
And I asked the guy,
I'm like,
dude,

221
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.980
we pull up to the hotel and it was like creepy.

222
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.660
It wasn't even like homeless people.
It was like nothing but driving into town,

223
00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:47.060
stopping at red lights and it's green for the other way and there's no cars.

224
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.640
I think it was missing was like tumbleweeds.

225
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.770
So we pull in there and I asked the guy when I parked the car,
I'm like,

226
00:13:54.771 --> 00:13:56.780
what the hell?
What the hell is everybody?
He's like,
ah,
you know,

227
00:13:56.781 --> 00:13:59.660
it gets kinda dead here on the weekends.
Um,

228
00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.980
but at night it totally picked up and it ended up being this awesome fucking

229
00:14:03.981 --> 00:14:07.880
city.
And we performed at this place called,
uh,
uh,

230
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.350
fuck the Brady theater.

231
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.700
<v 2>Okay.</v>

232
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.510
<v 0>It old Vaudeville theater that was finished in 1916 and it was one of the</v>

233
00:14:14.511 --> 00:14:16.160
coolest places I've ever performed in.

234
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:21.020
And it was just an absolutely fucking awesome crowd.
Just had a great time.

235
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.210
And uh,
I dunno.
And you know,
the usual shit.

236
00:14:26.211 --> 00:14:30.650
Harry Houdini performed here and they just fucking haunted and all of that crap.

237
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.400
Can you fill me running out of gas?
Everybody.
I run out of gas,
dude,

238
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.070
I've traveled too much.
Just fucking,
you know,
I'm sorry.
Let's,

239
00:14:38.071 --> 00:14:41.100
let's try to start to ramp up the goddamn comedy.
I can't,

240
00:14:41.101 --> 00:14:42.470
nothing funny happened at Tulsa.

241
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:46.500
Just had a great fucking time and there was a guy,
uh,
the runner,

242
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.190
this guy ray worked at at 1960 Cadillac and the end of,
uh,

243
00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.470
the all original,
the end of the show,

244
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:58.820
I'm driving this thing around Tulsa 1960 fucking Cadillac having a great time.

245
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.140
Then we went to this German bar,
which was a good time,
but I got to tell you,

246
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:06.020
there was a little bit too much wiener Schnitzel,
if you know what I mean.

247
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.280
I'm just trying to be a wing man for my buddy and there was nothing to talk to

248
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:14.720
their right.
And,
uh,
I don't know.

249
00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:18.260
Then the next day we drove up from Tulsa to Wichita and I gotta tell you

250
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:22.100
something about the drive from Tulsa to Wichita.
I would not work.

251
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.980
I would not wish that on my worst fucking enemy.

252
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.120
It was one of the worst drives,
the absolute,

253
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:32.450
the opposite of driving through the black hills in South Dakota.

254
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:37.760
That is one that you can skip.
There was fucking nothing,

255
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.673
nothing,

256
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.740
unless you're out there looking for some classic cars and that type of shit.
Um,

257
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.870
I,
you know,
I swear to God,

258
00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:50.750
it was like every other fucking house out there has some fucking car.

259
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:55.190
You're like,
Holy Shit,
you know,
that's a Mustang.
Look at that.

260
00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:57.560
There's an old fucking Ford pickup truck.
Every guy,

261
00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.800
it seems like every other house.
I'm exaggerating,
but there was probably like,

262
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:04.010
I still probably like 20 cars on the way up and trucks.

263
00:16:04.011 --> 00:16:06.890
And then there was a whole,
you know,
I don't know,

264
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.920
it's one guy had like fucking 30 of the old things up there.

265
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:11.490
I just started thinking in that,
that uh,

266
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.760
fast and loud that they should just drive that a,

267
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.990
wrapped her up there and fucking somehow talk those people into selling their

268
00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:21.530
cars for 40 bucks.
And then we got into Wichita.

269
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:25.310
Wichita was a little creepy.
Not going to lie to you.
A little creepy.

270
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.380
I missed my term.
We came to the back part of the fucking town and uh,

271
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.020
we went by the Rehab Clinic and uh,

272
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.860
really saw that drugs touch everybody.

273
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.430
It looked like a fucking old,

274
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:46.420
like if they did a real world reunion episode in everybody was in their 50s.

275
00:16:46.731 --> 00:16:48.890
That's what it looked like.
There was the old white guy,

276
00:16:48.891 --> 00:16:52.880
the old black guy and old Asian guy and old Latino Dude,

277
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.720
just all fucking standing out there.
A couple of fucking haggard looking checks,

278
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.710
you know,
looking like retired witches.
And,
um,

279
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:02.870
we played at the Orpheum.

280
00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:07.190
There were like the count Basie orchestra played Gracie,

281
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.730
George Burns,
grace al and Gracie Allen,
whatever they had played there.

282
00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:14.540
Just fucking insane.
I'm absolutely awesome shows.

I'm going to add in Nebraska and uh,

286
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.380

but whatever.

287
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:31.130
I feel like I put my foot down out there,
left my footprint.

288
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.200
I got another place,
another,

289
00:17:33.201 --> 00:17:38.060
a toric and do when I get old and gray or whatever.

Let's,

291
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.990
Uh,
where the fuck are we here?

292
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.920
And then I'm going to ramp it back up talking about that fucking bullshit

293
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.800
against the 40 niners and Pete Carroll's Twitter message.
All right,

whatever mistakes I make on the first one.

299
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.120
That's par for the course and I just tried to see if I can go under.

Jesus Christ.
Brutal reading.

378
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:27.700
That was like a public course right there.
Bunch of fucking divots.
All right,

379
00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.540
here we go.
Where do I start this week?
NFL Pro football.

380
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.060
Did Anybody Watch the 40 niners first?
The saints.

381
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.200
Now I am impartial.
I actually liked the saints.

382
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.860
I did that movie down there and I had a great fucking time and I was,

383
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:44.170
I was really getting into the saints and I think their fans are awesome and that

384
00:23:44.171 --> 00:23:48.590
type of thing.
I also the 40 niners so I like both of them.
I like both coaches.

385
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.140
I like both quarterbacks.
I like those teams.

386
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.750
So I watched the game and I got to tell you the 40 niners got robbed and I'm not

387
00:23:56.751 --> 00:24:00.050
blaming the saints and I don't expect St fans.
They have any empathy,

388
00:24:00.051 --> 00:24:03.350
but you know God damn well if the shoe was on the other foot,
you'd be like,

389
00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:06.170
what the fuck?
Okay.
Fuck the saints.

390
00:24:06.171 --> 00:24:08.480
Fuck the 40 niners let's just talk football here.

391
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:13.040
What exactly was that guy supposed to do?

392
00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:15.980
What he was trying to tackle?
Drew Brees.
What exactly was he?

393
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.870
What the fuck is he supposed to do?

394
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:23.330
Drew Brees is playing at full speed.
So on defense,
you're supposed to go,
what,

395
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:26.180
three quarters speed when the game is on the line.

396
00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:30.080
It wasn't a helmet to helmet hit.
He didn't fucking,
you know,

397
00:24:30.081 --> 00:24:31.370
it wasn't on an attack,

398
00:24:31.371 --> 00:24:34.160
on a defenseless player or whatever the hell they call it.

399
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.780
He's trying to run around the outside to get to drew Brees.

400
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.290
He's got the fucking outside,
God Damn Lima,
whatever the fuck it is,

401
00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:45.080
pushing them to the outside.
He's going by the quarterback.

402
00:24:45.081 --> 00:24:49.910
He reaches out to grab him and in the process he catches him in the neck a

403
00:24:49.911 --> 00:24:54.000
little bit and the guy goes down.
It's a violent fucking game.
Right?

404
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.780
Last year you couldn't hit him in the head.

405
00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.950
Now you can't hit quarterbacks in the t in the head or the fucking neck.

406
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:02.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

407
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.210
<v 0>What are the,
what are they going to be able to do next year?</v>

408
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.730
I think next year when you go to tackle the quarterback,

409
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.960
you ever go to put like a sheet on a bed and you do like that kind of thing and

410
00:25:10.961 --> 00:25:15.520
then it goes
and lands on the bed.
What does it do bill?
It goes,

411
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.850
I think that's what you're going to have to do.

412
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:23.950
The 40 niners needed somebody to step up and make a fucking play and that guy

413
00:25:23.951 --> 00:25:28.390
made the play.
He caused the fucking turnover and you recover the ball game.

414
00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:30.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

415
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:35.150
<v 0>All right.
But because of today's game,
they took it away from him.
Yeah,</v>

416
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.540
they ended up losing the game.

417
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.090
<v 2>Okay.</v>

418
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:42.290
<v 0>That was a textbook play.
It was fucking beautiful play.
I mean,</v>

419
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:46.220
you could sit there and watch Lawrence Taylor highlights and he has a zillion of

420
00:25:46.221 --> 00:25:51.020
those.
He used to,
he used to just bull rush people,
reach over them,

421
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.770
grabbed the quarterback by his shirt and just drag them down to the ground.

422
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.660
I just,
you can't fucking do anything anymore.
And uh,
I dunno.

423
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:01.910
I don't know if it's because I've been watching football too long.

424
00:26:01.911 --> 00:26:04.760
Let to me that looks like football and now they're saying it isn't.

425
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.620
I obviously like most of you probably saw that interview with Tony Doerr set and

426
00:26:09.621 --> 00:26:11.000
I hate seeing that type of stuff.

427
00:26:11.001 --> 00:26:15.260
I don't want former football players to be like that,

428
00:26:15.261 --> 00:26:19.990
but Jesus Christ,
he didn't get a concussion.
Nothing.

429
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:20.630
You know,
I've,

430
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:25.270
I found really interesting was Troy Aikman thought it was a good call and how we

431
00:26:25.271 --> 00:26:28.300
log was just shaking his head.
For those of you don't watch football.

432
00:26:28.301 --> 00:26:33.301
Troy Aikman is a former quarterback and how he longs at former defensive tackle

433
00:26:33.341 --> 00:26:38.260
or end,
I forgot what position he played.
So it's drew Brees didn't get hurt.

434
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.880
He didn't have a concussion.
He was fine.
He got right up Troy Aikman's going,

435
00:26:42.881 --> 00:26:45.990
oh look,
you could see his lips bloody while he's playing football.

436
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.330
You know the fuck.
So I think the 49 has got fucked.

437
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.910
I don't know what the solution is.
The,

438
00:26:53.911 --> 00:26:55.890
I maybe have to go back to leather helmets.

439
00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:00.730
I have no idea about Jesus.
[inaudible] you gotta be able to reach out,

440
00:27:00.731 --> 00:27:02.860
grab the fucking quarterback as you go down.
Yeah.

441
00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.590
And maybe sometime he goes down a little bit violently.

442
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:07.750
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

443
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.600
<v 0>I mean,
I don't fucking know.</v>

444
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.760
Somebody's on my Twitter account was like laugh and go.

445
00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.210
Like next year they're going to treat quarterbacks like kickers,

446
00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.440
like if you even touch them,
it's an automatic unnecessary roughness.

447
00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:24.010
Now that we definitely went down in a rough way,
but it's a tough game.

448
00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.590
But he's fine if he has any sort of fucking problems at the 20 years after he

449
00:27:30.591 --> 00:27:32.440
retired,
just not going to be because of that.
Yes.

450
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.180
I could have taken that fucking hit.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

451
00:27:35.181 --> 00:27:36.770
I'd feel the effects for three weeks,

452
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:41.830
but I could have taken that hit and gotten up and throw a fucking goddamn duck

453
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.910
the next play.
I have done that and I have a stand up comedian.

454
00:27:46.911 --> 00:27:49.490
If I could have taken the fucking head.
All right.

455
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.570
<v 2>Okay.</v>

456
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.330
<v 0>Fuck you.
I could have the most of you could have told you could've taken it.</v>

457
00:27:54.331 --> 00:27:54.961
Jesus Christ.

458
00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:59.040
I've got to hit harder than that plain fucking kill the male with the ball back

459
00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:03.170
in the day or whatever you guys call the game.
Well,
that's what we call it.

460
00:28:03.171 --> 00:28:06.780
Kill the male with the ball.
Murder the fucker.
Uh,

461
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.671
and then lastly,

462
00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:11.580
the last thing I'm going to say about the fucking football this week was,
uh,

463
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.550
Pete Carroll's a former team that he coached USC beat 'em.

464
00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:21.470
I was at Syracuse,
so fucking tired.
Beat Stanford,

465
00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.560
which was a major upset.
And um,

466
00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:25.580
<v 2>okay.</v>

467
00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.680
<v 0>Stanford had beaten USC like four years in a row,</v>

468
00:28:27.681 --> 00:28:31.220
so it was a big victory for them.
And,
uh,

469
00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.670
so Pete Carroll tweeted,
you know,
basically it can crash.

470
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.640
Congratulations to USC,
which is fucking hilarious.
And then ESPN shows it.

471
00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.000
They all blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

472
00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.720
And at no point did they discuss how Pete Carroll,
you know,

473
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.990
Pete Carol left at that team high and dry.
Oh,

474
00:28:47.991 --> 00:28:51.280
maybe that's just part of the arrangement that call his football coaches have,

475
00:28:51.281 --> 00:28:52.790
cause I don't begrudge the guy what he did.

476
00:28:52.791 --> 00:28:57.590
He did what everybody has to do to win at a division one level as you break a

477
00:28:57.591 --> 00:28:58.790
bunch of fucking rules.

478
00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.120
But then years later they make a movie about a called blue chips with fucking

479
00:29:02.121 --> 00:29:05.150
Nick Nolte.
Right.
Um,

480
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:11.180
or North Dallas flag came up with the fucking movie was called.
I don't know,

481
00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.740
I just thought it was funny that he writes back to the school that he left high

482
00:29:15.741 --> 00:29:19.730
and dry as he sat there telling every you all those incoming freshmen that he

483
00:29:19.731 --> 00:29:22.910
was going to develop them and they'd have an NFL fucking career and then all of

484
00:29:22.911 --> 00:29:26.630
a sudden deaths at the back door and he just fucking takes off and goes up to

485
00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.610
Seattle.
You know,

486
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.550
I don't think that thing really had anything that tweet had anything to do with

487
00:29:31.551 --> 00:29:32.031
USC.

488
00:29:32.031 --> 00:29:36.650
I think that has to do with his fucking hatred of captain come back there and

489
00:29:36.651 --> 00:29:40.130
the time he ran up the score when he was coaching fucking Syracuse.
Right.

490
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.900
Jim Harbor.
I think it had more to do with that.
Um,

491
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.440
but I was disappointed that the end of his,

492
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.020
his tweet didn't say Hashtag [inaudible]

493
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.690
<v 3>Woo.</v>

494
00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:56.070
<v 0>Um,
all right.
Where are we?</v>

495
00:29:56.071 --> 00:29:59.680
How many fucking minutes in our we could I start reading shut.
Jesus.
29,

496
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:02.910
30 minutes.
30 fucking minutes.
What am I going to do here?

497
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.910
What are we gonna talk about?
The Greenpeace dirty again,

498
00:30:05.911 --> 00:30:10.230
nothing has changed as far as I can tell,
far as I can.
Oh.

499
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:15.230
Oh one more thing about the fucking football is versus New York football giants.

500
00:30:15.231 --> 00:30:18.810
One again.
And uh,
I don't,

501
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:23.570
I don't dislike the giants actually love the giants.
Um,
this is a franchise,

502
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.600
right?
Even though they beat the Patriots.
I,
I get,
I get beyond that.

503
00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.540
They beat the Patriots.
What the fuck were they supposed to do?
Lose to them?

504
00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.440
You know,
they're trying to win the game and they want it good for them.

505
00:30:33.441 --> 00:30:37.940
I don't give a fuck,
but what it is is with every victory they have,

506
00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:43.540
I'm going to have to listen to [inaudible] going on and on and on.

507
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.000
Just fast forward 20 minutes into this podcast,

508
00:30:47.001 --> 00:30:51.620
cause I'm still going to be going on an m.
He still talking about Robinson canal,

509
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.620
like this is what you have to know about Paul Versey.
He likes gummy bears.

510
00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.280
He likes going to the movies and he spends 100% of his time when he's talking

511
00:31:03.831 --> 00:31:07.520
about sports,
talking about the 10% of the time that he was actually right,

512
00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.640
and it drives me up the fucking wall.
You don't,

513
00:31:10.641 --> 00:31:14.540
one of his predictions was was the Patriots were crazy not to resign.

514
00:31:14.541 --> 00:31:15.374
Matt Cassel.

515
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.313
<v 2>Okay,</v>

516
00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:21.480
<v 0>I fucking nailed that one.
I've already talked,</v>

517
00:31:21.481 --> 00:31:23.610
I've talked about this one a million times.
I would give up.

518
00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:24.781
I give up with this guy.

519
00:31:24.781 --> 00:31:27.570
I called the fucking super bowl this year and I put my money down.

520
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.950
I never brought it up to him.
He's already talking about it.

521
00:31:31.951 --> 00:31:35.940
He's already sending me text messages.
This is what kills me.

522
00:31:35.941 --> 00:31:38.280
Like when I call something,
I'm like,
all right.
I got lucky.

523
00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:43.550
Versie actually thinks that something like paranormal happened that he has like

524
00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.580
ESP liquid.
He caught when he calls something,

525
00:31:47.581 --> 00:31:49.550
he's got distinct where he kind of puts his head down.

526
00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:54.420
He's like looking through his eyebrows,
yet he gets it.
He gets a little crazy.

527
00:31:55.650 --> 00:32:00.060
That guy is not all there.
Don't buy into his little fucking,

528
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:05.550
you know,
when you,
when you get the Paul Versey brochure in the mail,
what?

529
00:32:05.551 --> 00:32:09.900
He's coming to your town.
I'm telling you that guy.
He's not all there.

530
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.810
I'm just fucking with you.
I love the guy.
You know what?
This is why I love Paul.

531
00:32:15.811 --> 00:32:20.700
Versey all right.
This is a zillion reasons,
but I have to get back to him.

532
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:24.540
I had a quick phone call and I was going,
I forget what the fuck I was doing.

533
00:32:24.541 --> 00:32:25.170
I was,

534
00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:28.680
I think it was going in and I'm just going to do a show and he called me up to

535
00:32:28.681 --> 00:32:32.520
talk to me about a veal chop.
He just ate.
You know,

536
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:38.890
it's just fucking hilarious how much she's into food.
It's ridiculous.
Oh,

537
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:44.030
this week everybody,
I got a couple of all things comedy.

538
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:49.790
Um,
our wonderful new podcast network,
um,
that I have to tell you about,

539
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.650
uh,

540
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.460

541
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.480
Al Madrigal are going to be hosting a garage,

shale,

542
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.840
a garage sale.
Uh,

543
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:06.920
both of us are taking shit out of our garages in our lives,
their lives.

544
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:11.070
I can't even talk.
We're taking stuff on our garages and our lives,

545
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.660
comedy memorabilia,
old hockey sticks.

546
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.200
I got one of those fucking man great systems that they sent me.

547
00:33:18.201 --> 00:33:20.540
They already gave me one.
You know,

548
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:22.640
what am I supposed to stack two on top of each other?

549
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.790
I don't even think the meat would cook at that point.
Those things is so thick.

550
00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:30.530
So I got one of those.
Uh,
what else do I got?
I got,
uh,

551
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.030
I got some fucking old,
why do I do this?
Let it go.

552
00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.660
Uh,
DVDs at all.
Be autographed.

553
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:44.290
I got this fucking trunk metal locker trunk thing that the last people owned my

554
00:33:44.301 --> 00:33:49.210
house left in the garage.
You know,
I don't know what else bring in,
but,
uh,

555
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:53.780
you know,
I'm sure he's got a bunch of stuff too.
And,
uh,

556
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:58.190
all of the proceeds are going to go towards the wounded warrior project.
Um,

557
00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:59.530
also,
uh,

558
00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:04.490
there's another all things comedy show down at Largo here in Los Angeles.

559
00:34:04.491 --> 00:34:06.440
Donald Laci,
Annika just north of Beverly.

560
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.290
I'm going to be eight o'clock this Wednesday.

561
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:14.320
I will be performing there as well as a bunch of other hosts of podcasts on our

562
00:34:14.451 --> 00:34:18.320
network.
Please come down,
have a good time,
learn about our network.

563
00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:23.420
And uh,
what else?
Um,

564
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:25.610
all also,
I got to give a shout out to the cage.

565
00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.620
Really Awesome podcast hosted by Kevin Christie in Nicu Sef two phenomenal

566
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:35.900
younger comics.
They young to me.
All right.
They're probably young to you.
But,
uh,

567
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:38.780
and also if you think I love dogs,
you've got to listen to Kevin Christie.
Dude,

568
00:34:38.781 --> 00:34:41.150
that guy is like,
I'm swear to God.

569
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:45.440
I think if you pet his dog in the wrong direction,
like a cat,
uh,

570
00:34:45.441 --> 00:34:50.120
you'd probably be missing a limb and he would never apologize and that's why I

571
00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:53.210
love it.
But anyways,
they gave me a nice shout out,
um,

572
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.930
Dad Max Greenfield on their podcasts from the new girl.

573
00:34:56.931 --> 00:34:58.420
And I guess he talked about,
um,

574
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.840
that episode I did where he's basically sticking his head in a coffin with a

575
00:35:05.421 --> 00:35:06.290
dead body there.

576
00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.140
And I'm trying to get them to stop doing it because I'm trying to take a gold

577
00:35:09.141 --> 00:35:12.920
chain off the dead.
Dead Party was fucking hilarious.
We,

578
00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:15.830
I think we shot it at one in the morning and he had me laugh in my,

579
00:35:15.831 --> 00:35:20.630
I had such a great time doing that show between working with Max and,

580
00:35:20.631 --> 00:35:25.250
uh,
working with Nick Kroll and all my scenes,

581
00:35:25.251 --> 00:35:25.881
I swear to God,

582
00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:29.010
it seemed like they were one in the morning and I was feeling like I was gonna

583
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:32.720
pass out and that I can't hack it as an actor in both of them had me laughing my

584
00:35:32.721 --> 00:35:36.590
ass off at one in the morning,
standup comic who doesn't laugh at Shit.

585
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.630
So,
uh,
anyways,

586
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:44.340
so check out the occasionally awesome podcasts on the all things comedy network.

587
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:47.790
And there you go.
There's a little mini commercial there.
Let me go back to the,

588
00:35:47.791 --> 00:35:51.090
uh,
go back to a rambling here.

589
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:54.480
So basically because I don't want to listen to Versie,

590
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.730
you know,
and he's one dump fucking prediction.
His dope.

591
00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.490
I think this is the only thing that he's actually going to get right this year.

592
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.130
And we're in November.
As far as I know.

593
00:36:05.131 --> 00:36:07.050
I don't know anything else he said write this year.

594
00:36:07.051 --> 00:36:08.760
He was wrong about the super bowl.

595
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.610
He was wrong about that Christmas sweater that he wore the last time we worked

596
00:36:13.611 --> 00:36:17.180
together.
This is going to be the first.
Ah,
you know what?
Everybody's right.
Every,

597
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.700
every once in a while,
Jesus,

598
00:36:20.701 --> 00:36:24.810
he's going to to eyecare and fuck a 2016.
I'm still gonna be hearing about this.

599
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.550
Yeah.
What about dead fucking judge prediction?
You know?
Um,

600
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.540
so he's actually made me like an eagles fan.
Like I'm rooting for the fucking,

601
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:38.541
I'm rooting for somebody in that Goddamn division to actually win some fucking

602
00:36:38.731 --> 00:36:42.980
games.
Okay.
Philadelphia Eagles,

603
00:36:42.981 --> 00:36:47.960
Dallas cowboys,
fucking red skins.
I'm done with you.
All right?

604
00:36:47.961 --> 00:36:52.250
But it's not too late.
All three of you,
the giant spotted you.

605
00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:56.970
Six fucking games.
All right.

606
00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.013
This is,

607
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:03.330
this is inexcusable for you to let those kids come back and win the fucking

608
00:37:03.331 --> 00:37:07.350
division.
Absolutely.
Fucking inexcusable.
Then.

609
00:37:07.351 --> 00:37:10.860
I can't say I loved the job.
I actually like the fucking giants.

610
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.080
I just don't want to listen to Versie for the love of God.
Philadelphia Eagles,

611
00:37:16.081 --> 00:37:18.600
Dallas cowboys.
Next week when you play the fucking giants,

612
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:24.000
could you play full four quarters?
You know,
don't do it for yourselves.

613
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:24.953
Do it for me.

614
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:27.100
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

615
00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.770
<v 0>Oh my God.
Jesus Christ.</v>

616
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:34.930
He is going to go on for fucking ever.
Um,
all right,
let's read some shit here.

617
00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:39.190
A dollar shave club.
Correction.
This is from a listener.
Hey Bill,

618
00:37:39.191 --> 00:37:44.191
can you change that copy to read rusty soup can instead of rusty soda can

619
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.470
aluminum,
aluminum,
soda cans don't rust.

620
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.200
But the 10 coded soup cans sure as hell will.

621
00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:55.150
I honestly wanted to be helpful.
I can try to break your balls another time.

622
00:37:55.151 --> 00:37:58.570
Thanks for the podcast.
That's fucking hilarious.
Is there any ta,

623
00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:02.530
is there anything better when somebody just like scientifically correct?

624
00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:07.600
You know,
I didn't know that a little bit in cans don't rust.
I had no idea.

625
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.150
I didn't even know the cans are made out of aluminum.

626
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.950
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

627
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:15.700
<v 0>I didn't know what it was.
I thought it was some sort of,
you know,</v>

628
00:38:15.701 --> 00:38:19.540
some sort of metal,
plastic kind of shit.
I had no added on.
It was,

629
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:23.050
I never knew what it was.
All right.
How to handle conspiracy theories.

630
00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:27.400
Billy bag buster.
Oh,
by the fucking way.
Wait a second.

631
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.430
Wait a minute.
I forgot to bring this up.

632
00:38:30.431 --> 00:38:35.170
Do you guys know that one of my fantasies is coming true this week?
No,

633
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.920
not reading copy correctly.
Uh,

634
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.770
there's two bankers being put to death and Vietnam.

635
00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:48.480
Let me look this up here.
Death v it,
um,

636
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:54.160
[inaudible] bankers sentenced to death for fraud.
Here we go.

637
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:58.570
This is what this is what should have been happening in this country in 2008,

638
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.823
like,

639
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:00.430
<v 1>okay.</v>

640
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.600
<v 0>It already should have like,</v>

641
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.720
they should have been at least a hundred bankers dead.

642
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.650
You know what you should do is like smothering them with cash.

643
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:18.040
No,
what you do is you tie him to the mast of their yacht or this sail boat,

644
00:39:18.041 --> 00:39:21.220
right?
And then you put a bunch of cash at their feet,

645
00:39:21.221 --> 00:39:25.900
all the cash that they stole.
You just light it on fire,
right?
Like Jonah,

646
00:39:25.901 --> 00:39:28.490
fuck it up.
Uh,

647
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:34.290
let me see if I could find where the fuck is it.
There we go.

648
00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:36.220
Yahoo Free News.
Let's go here.

649
00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:40.380
A Vietnamese former banker and his business associates at been sentenced to

650
00:39:40.381 --> 00:39:44.790
death for their part in the embezzlement of $25 million.

651
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:49.980
State media has reported 25 million bucks and you get the Goddamn death

652
00:39:49.981 --> 00:39:52.460
sentence.
All right.

653
00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.610
So I figured that the people at Aig,

654
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:59.390
they ought to have like what happened to William Wallace at the end of

655
00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.400
Braveheart,
whatever that fucking thing is.

656
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:06.170
Well they just pull out your fucking end trails like machete.

657
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:12.310
The pair were among 11 defendants in the nine day trial and Holcim in city state

658
00:40:14.331 --> 00:40:19.010
media reported on Saturday in a case that is heightened Vietnam's effort to show

659
00:40:19.011 --> 00:40:23.030
it is stamping out corruption in the face of widespread public anger over the

660
00:40:23.031 --> 00:40:24.530
issue.
That's the only part of the story.

661
00:40:24.531 --> 00:40:28.550
I don't like the fact that they're trying to make an example.

662
00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:30.830
So I think that they just got a couple of Ollie north here.

663
00:40:30.831 --> 00:40:34.050
They're going to kill two people or 11 it'd be like,
see,

664
00:40:34.051 --> 00:40:36.110
you were doing something and then it goes right back.

665
00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.780
Now I don't know what politicians make it Vietnam,

666
00:40:38.781 --> 00:40:42.740
but if it's anything like over here,
you know the bankers put them in office.

667
00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.590
So I have no fucking idea.
But anyways,
this is the deal.

668
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:50.950
Wgu Kwok how 58 the one time chief of the finance subsidiary subsidiary of the

669
00:40:52.911 --> 00:40:57.911
state owned Vietnam Agribank and building from boss Dag van high 56 were

670
00:41:00.201 --> 00:41:03.230
sentenced to death on Friday.
According to state television,

671
00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.830
they were given the sentence for embezzlement of assets,
mismanagement,

672
00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:10.970
abusive power and fraud causing serious consequences to the state.

673
00:41:10.971 --> 00:41:15.500
Sound familiar,
everybody?
I just did that.
What I hated last week.
Sound familiar?

674
00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:16.760
Uh,

675
00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:21.760
the other nine defendants were jailed for up to 14 years for violating state

676
00:41:21.921 --> 00:41:23.270
economic regulations.

677
00:41:23.271 --> 00:41:26.960
The report out of the group was accused of embezzling more than $25 million of

678
00:41:26.961 --> 00:41:30.590
state money between April,
2008 and March,

679
00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:34.730
2009 by falsifying financial leasing contracts to reports and state media.

680
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.640
Vietnam is rated one of the world's most corrupt nations.

681
00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:41.480
And graft is a top concern for many ordinary people.

682
00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.930
The communist government has vowed to clamp down on the issue.

683
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:47.690
They will be strict punishment for state.
Uh,

684
00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.300
I'm not gonna read the rest of this shit of spare you guys.

685
00:41:50.301 --> 00:41:55.100
I read it pretty well up to that point.
Um,
so there you go.

686
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.211
There you go.

687
00:41:56.211 --> 00:42:00.590
See that doesn't matter what kind of government you have a democracy,

688
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:04.220
communism,
socialism,
dictatorship.

689
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.960
The fucking bankers are running shit and they need to be put down and the

690
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:13.310
fucking straight and replaced with honest people.

691
00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:14.923
You know,

692
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:19.280
like some of those fine folks that I met out there in the heartland.

693
00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.630
Oh,
it'd be great.
I would actually go to the execution.

694
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:25.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

695
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:28.120
<v 0>Is fucking morbid.
Is that is,
you know.</v>

696
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

697
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:34.020
<v 0>I would actually go there.
Who the fuck is sitting there texting me now?</v>

698
00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.390
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

699
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:40.500
<v 0>All right.
Let's go back to the,
uh,
when I just dropped my voice.</v>

700
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:45.090
Let's go back to the questions for this week.
How to handle conspiracy theories.

701
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:48.930
Billy Bank,
buster,
I'm all in when it comes to reading and researching ideas,

702
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.430
independent of those we hear all day in the media,
whether it be the banks,

703
00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.730
the lizard people,
or the fact that we live in a simulation.

704
00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.290
It's all important information.

705
00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.790
I'm with you when it comes to shrugging off a particular air of pretentiousness

706
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:05.340
like that guy in the human farming video.

707
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:10.520
The problem with general reaction to new information is that everyone does that.

708
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.500
I'm a democrat.
I'm a Republican.

709
00:43:13.501 --> 00:43:16.980
Bullshit where they just pick a side and defend it to death.

710
00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:20.700
Here's the troth all in capital letters.
The truth is,

711
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.420
is that there's some truth to the fact that we are being pushed around by those

712
00:43:24.421 --> 00:43:27.960
in power.
Who the fuck are you to say that this is the truth?

713
00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.910
Why can't you just say,
this is your version of the truth?

714
00:43:29.911 --> 00:43:31.380
He came at me all diplomatic.

715
00:43:31.381 --> 00:43:34.590
I was really liking who you are and then all of a sudden you yelled at me.

716
00:43:34.591 --> 00:43:38.650
I don't know where you'll love me in.
I was right there.
Pop it up.

717
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:42.330
Dube Zip Addepar de [inaudible].
Here's the truth.

718
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:47.250
The truth is that there is some truth to the fact that we'd been pushed around

719
00:43:47.251 --> 00:43:51.630
by those in power.
It's true that people in power have bigger plans that we,

720
00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:56.820
that we know about.
We know this because it's been that way forever.
It takes,

721
00:43:56.821 --> 00:44:00.240
the current population is so long to get over their emotional reaction to

722
00:44:00.241 --> 00:44:03.720
finding out negative things that by the time they understand everything,

723
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.750
they're dead and the kids are voting for the next jackass.

724
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:09.750
I agree with the way you handle this stuff.
You're in,

725
00:44:09.751 --> 00:44:11.490
but you're not letting it ruin your life.

726
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.400
This is a revolution of knowledge that can't be stopped.
Now.

727
00:44:14.401 --> 00:44:18.210
Please run for office and stay out of convertibles.
Uh,

728
00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.180
all right.
I'm such a defensive asshole.

729
00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:24.210
I thought you were disagreeing with me until right in the end.
Uh,
no,

730
00:44:24.211 --> 00:44:25.050
there's no fucking way.

731
00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:30.650
I'm too God damn dumb and I have jerked off to too much fucking horrific shit on

732
00:44:30.751 --> 00:44:35.260
the,
and uh,
I,
you know,

733
00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:38.290
let doesn't mean that I couldn't be an office.

734
00:44:38.291 --> 00:44:40.450
I would just have to be a company player.
You know,

735
00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:43.810
I really got to start reading up on this fucking guy up in Toronto,
man,

736
00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:49.030
this crack smoking,
pussy ate and fucking mayor,
whoever they got up there.

737
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:51.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

738
00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:54.880
<v 0>Somebody was,
somebody was trying to tell me,
uh,
uh,</v>

739
00:44:54.881 --> 00:44:57.280
literally looking at Toronto Mayor Eating Pussy.

740
00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.420
Rob Ford's denies eating Pussy Video.

741
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.790
<v 1>Okay?</v>

742
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:05.400
<v 0>He denies that he ate this woman's Pussy,
said he,</v>

743
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.650
he's married and has plenty to eat at home

744
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:14.400
and then walked off.
You know,
like he just dropped the mic.

745
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:20.810
That's the greatest fucking thing ever.
You gotta love that kind of honesty.

746
00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.730
What the fuck is this?

747
00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.740
Is this somebody piggyback?
I don't want this thing.

748
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:36.000
Uh,
Jesus.
Is this a commercial I have to sit through?
I just hit mute.

749
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:38.220
All right,
here we go.

750
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:44.000
<v 1>Blasting was Olivia gone back?
I wanted to eat her pussy.</v>

751
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:47.970
He found out I've never said that in my life.
I would never do that.

752
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.490
I'm happy married.
I've got more than enough to eat at home,

753
00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:02.120
<v 0>dude.
Did he just have a fucking Jersey with his name on it and the back?</v>

754
00:46:02.121 --> 00:46:06.610
This guy is the fucking greatest thing ever.
Hang on.
Hang on.

755
00:46:06.611 --> 00:46:08.980
Wait a minute that there's a flabbergasted lady.

756
00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:10.840
<v 4>You Go.</v>

757
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.633
<v 1>All right.</v>

758
00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:22.150
<v 4>I know we're applying right now.</v>

759
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.790
Speaking as me report does.

760
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:36.543
<v 0>You know what?</v>

761
00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:40.880
I Dunno if he was born that way or smoking crack gives you some balls lead.

762
00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:44.830
This guy just doesn't give a fuck.
I don't know anything about this story.

763
00:46:44.831 --> 00:46:48.160
It's only what I've heard.
I don't know if you're,
if you're in office for life,

764
00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:52.900
but
if he smokes crack the way I drink booze,

765
00:46:52.901 --> 00:46:56.560
I don't think it's going to affect his job.
You know?
If he just has a couple,

766
00:46:56.561 --> 00:47:00.850
two or three cracks,
the end of the day.
You like smoking crack.

767
00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:02.570
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

768
00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:03.420
<v 0>that's,
you know something.</v>

769
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:07.820
There's just something you got to go down swinging in life.
Right.

770
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:11.810
That's the way to go down because he knows eventually it's like if I'm going to

771
00:47:11.811 --> 00:47:13.410
get squeezed out,
fucking do.

772
00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:16.460
The guy had a jersey with his name on it with a number on the back.

773
00:47:16.461 --> 00:47:18.520
I don't know what the fuck that was about,
but um,

774
00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.490
<v 1>okay.</v>

775
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:21.840
<v 0>Whatever.
He's owned by the banks too,</v>

776
00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:26.430
if you might as well have somebody entertaining.
Isn't that right Cleo?
Oh,
cleo.

777
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:30.580
All you were sleeping.
I'm sorry buddy.
How are you doing?

778
00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.540
The fucking dog is hilarious.
I came over,
had an early flight,
right.

779
00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:39.541
And I come home right and I pull up to the house or whatever and I come in and

780
00:47:40.961 --> 00:47:44.020
she didn't know was coming home.
Now she has no,
I have no income and home.

781
00:47:44.021 --> 00:47:45.400
She has no concept of me leaving.

782
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.010
I just walk out the door and she hasn't like she hasn't,
I'll go to Wichita.

783
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:52.250
Kind of a fucking stupid sentence.
Was that,
oh,

784
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:54.670
it was to what you were thinking bill?
Um,

785
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.480
so I walk in and she hates hardwood floors.

786
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.360
She just feels like she can't get any sort of balance on them,

787
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.850
so she has to walk really slow with their head down.

788
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:07.720
So I come in and she hears that the door unlocking.

789
00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:11.380
So she comes running out and she knows it's me and she's all excited,

790
00:48:11.381 --> 00:48:13.120
but she's walking on hardwood floors.

791
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:18.540
So she was walking really slowly while her tail was wagging 90 miles an hour and

792
00:48:18.741 --> 00:48:22.420
a fucking shaking or pit bull booty like walking sideways.

793
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:26.230
It's one of the best laughs if you don't have a dog,
you're a fucking asshole.

794
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.070
What does a cat do?
Well maybe cat does something cause I have never,

795
00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:31.030
I didn't grow up with cats.

796
00:48:31.031 --> 00:48:35.350
What does a cat do that is like similar to that?

797
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.300
I remember I dated this girl and she had a cat.

798
00:48:37.301 --> 00:48:40.510
She had a cool one and I would fucking wake up in the morning.

799
00:48:40.511 --> 00:48:45.511
This thing would be standing on my chest like doing that thing,

800
00:48:46.211 --> 00:48:49.120
you know where they're sorta like,
like to try to pull your shirt apart.

801
00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:55.030
I used to make me laugh,
but uh,
I just don't like that.

802
00:48:55.031 --> 00:48:56.070
They shit inside.

803
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

804
00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:02.240
<v 0>It goes to the Goddamn box.
Smells like,
I don't know,</v>

805
00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:06.680
there's just no appreciation from,
maybe I'm too needy to be a cat owner.

806
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:10.850
I respect cat.
So you know,
they're in the deal but not have it.

807
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:15.560
And they also retain their hunting skills.
They keep those polished.

808
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:18.470
I think that they know that the dollar's going to crash the way they always go

809
00:49:18.471 --> 00:49:22.370
out and fucking kill my cis stuff.
Um,
all right,
here we go.

810
00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:29.280
Where is it here advice?
My mom thinks she's a psychic.
Uh,

811
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.310
hey,
big red,

812
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:34.670
long time fan and loyal follower of the [inaudible] podcast for the past five

813
00:49:34.671 --> 00:49:39.530
years.
Can't wait for the new podcast tee shirts.
I'm picking him up today.
Oh,

814
00:49:39.531 --> 00:49:44.060
was it a journey with this fucking company?
Jesus Christ.

815
00:49:44.061 --> 00:49:47.180
It took forever.
Forever.
For fucking ever.

816
00:49:47.181 --> 00:49:50.300
We changed the design a couple of times and then,
you know,
and then from then on,

817
00:49:50.301 --> 00:49:53.120
I don't know what the fuck happened.
Um,
anyways,
he said,

818
00:49:53.121 --> 00:49:56.960
I need your advice on how to bring my 58 year old mob back to reality.

819
00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:59.390
Ever since my mom's menopause,

820
00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.950
my brother and I came to the realization that my mom believes she has the

821
00:50:03.951 --> 00:50:06.590
ability to speak and see those who have,

822
00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.950
who have crossed over to the other side.

823
00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:13.130
This has to do with her menopause?

824
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.690
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

825
00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:18.620
<v 0>I don't,
I don't think,
uh,
I think you look at it the wrong answer.</v>

826
00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:23.900
Uh,
she even has no problems pushing her beliefs on to complete strangers.

827
00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:27.050
For example,
um,

828
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:31.370
I was having a stressful time during my career by mom proceeds to pull out these

829
00:50:31.371 --> 00:50:36.050
two and 10 and like rod shaped like the letter l while holding the short end of

830
00:50:36.051 --> 00:50:38.360
the Rod.
She proceeds to walk up to meet

831
00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:43.140
and the two meet in the rods,
m e t

832
00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.500
the rods move closer together in her hands.

833
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:51.830
She says I am surrounded by negative activity.

834
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:53.040
<v 2>Okay.</v>

835
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.670
<v 0>Wait a minute.
What kind of witchcraft,</v>

836
00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:58.920
what we talk while holding the short end of the Rod,
she proceeds to walk up

837
00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:04.430
to meet me I think is what you went to say and the rods move closer together in

838
00:51:04.431 --> 00:51:04.810
a hands.

839
00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:09.010
I linked chicks just guessed that she says I'm surrounded by negative activity.

840
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:13.480
She then proceeds to make me think of the most positive thoughts I can envision

841
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:15.040
such as the birth.

842
00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:22.070
What the fuck dude,
you got to finish your sentences.
Birth of your son,

843
00:51:22.071 --> 00:51:25.940
I guess is what that means.
She then steps back and then while I love,

844
00:51:25.941 --> 00:51:27.980
I use the word home correctly,

845
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:30.080
I'm assuming and then you can't get this other shit.
Right.

846
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:35.120
She then steps back and then while I'm sup supposedly thinking positive
thoughts,

847
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:39.710
she walks backwards toward me and the rod slowly separate apart.

848
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:45.100
She comments that the spirits are now in my favor like an asshole.

849
00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.860
I thought of the most depressing thoughts I could just to prove that she was

850
00:51:48.861 --> 00:51:51.830
moving the damn rods herself.
After pouring it out,

851
00:51:51.831 --> 00:51:55.010
my mom freaks out and breaks out crying and yelling,

852
00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:57.530
saying how much of a jerk I am that I would,

853
00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:02.360
that I should respect her abilities and they aren't to be toyed with

854
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:07.610
Jesus Christ.
She sounds like she's going to stab you with a butter knife.

855
00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:09.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

856
00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.380
<v 0>You know what I just thought of?
I just thought of misery.</v>

857
00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:14.170
Like you're going to wake up tied to the bed and she's going to be standing

858
00:52:14.171 --> 00:52:17.350
there with fucking lightning going off in the background.

859
00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.060
What a fucking you mobs?
A jerk dote.

860
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:21.570
<v 2>Okay.</v>

861
00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:25.500
<v 0>You're busted her for lying and then she uses the age old fucking woman,</v>

862
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:31.110
um,
manipulating technique of crying.
Right.

863
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.360
He should have held it to it.
It's like you're,

864
00:52:35.361 --> 00:52:39.090
you're yelling at me cause you're lying.
You lied to me,
mom.

865
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:43.860
How could you do that?
Put the fucking TV antenna down.

866
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:45.623
All right.

867
00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:47.110
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

868
00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:50.320
<v 0>Sit down and have a fucking sandwich.
What's wrong with you?
He says,</v>

869
00:52:50.321 --> 00:52:52.960
I love my mom bill and I just want her to come to her senses.

870
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:57.990
Obviously jokes don't help to persuade her that she isn't Nostradamus any advice

871
00:52:58.391 --> 00:53:01.360
you are Nia might have would be appreciated.
Maybe it's just me,

872
00:53:01.361 --> 00:53:04.570
but this whole spiritualism shit feels like a fad.

873
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:09.330
Just like the show long island medium.
I don't know that show.
Ah,

874
00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.450
yeah.
I don't know what to to,
I don't know.

875
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:16.103
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

876
00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:17.980
<v 0>Is Ti,
does she have a job?</v>

877
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:19.570
<v 2>Okay.</v>

878
00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:22.690
<v 0>Is she sick of her career and she's trying to go the Tarot card reading thing?</v>

879
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.070
I have no idea.
Don't know what to say

880
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:30.300
<v 2>to you there.
I bet.
I mean,
I would give her shit like,
mom,
you lied to me.
Okay.</v>

881
00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:31.563
<v 0>All right.</v>

882
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:32.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>

883
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.180
<v 0>You're sitting there saying that,
uh,
you're,
you're like,</v>

884
00:53:35.181 --> 00:53:37.550
you're healing me and you're not.

885
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:39.130
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

886
00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:41.380
<v 0>I don't know when somebody goes crazy,
dude,
I don't know.</v>

887
00:53:41.381 --> 00:53:45.560
I don't know what to tell.
You either got to roll with it or you got to,

888
00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:49.730
I would want to bring it to a doctor cause God knows they're going to put her

889
00:53:49.731 --> 00:53:53.060
all of the latest drugs and use her as a fucking Guinea pig.

890
00:53:53.061 --> 00:53:55.820
So I might try to avoid that.

891
00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:02.100
I Dunno dude.
I feel like I'm letting you down here,

892
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.370
but I'd rather not give you any advice because I don't have any,

893
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:07.590
rather than give you some bad advice.

894
00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.120
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

895
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.390
<v 0>Oh,
free sat.
I love my mom.
I need advice.
You might.</v>

896
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:16.700
How to make it come to our senses.
Uh,

897
00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:20.990
I dunno.
Why don't you go buy a magic kit and get better at it than she is

898
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:26.190
and then somehow try to turn her into your student and it just one day,

899
00:54:26.191 --> 00:54:30.180
just say that she failed.
You know that she needs to go back to beat him up.

900
00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:31.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>

901
00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:36.010
<v 0>Just grow out a long beard and start wearing all white and sick fucking Indian</v>

902
00:54:36.011 --> 00:54:40.990
style.
The Lotus position,
I believe it's called.
And uh,

903
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:41.981
you know,

904
00:54:41.981 --> 00:54:44.860
like candles and stuff that'll give you credibility with her and just tell her

905
00:54:44.861 --> 00:54:49.400
that she's a,
you know,
she's not good at it now.

906
00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:53.110
They still make her cry again.
I Dunno,

907
00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:58.510
no disrespect to Meryl Streep,
but they can all do it on command,
you know,

908
00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:01.540
I'm not saying she's not a good actress and doesn't deserve those fucking shiny

909
00:55:01.541 --> 00:55:04.480
trophies,
but I don't know what to tell you.

910
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:07.960
They just can do it at the drop of a fucking hat.

911
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:14.290
She's sitting there with two TV and tennis and the guy borrowed son buster for

912
00:55:14.481 --> 00:55:16.850
lying and immediately could,
she can start crying.

913
00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:22.020
There's not a guy in the world that could fucking pull that emotion out of their

914
00:55:22.021 --> 00:55:26.440
ass like that.
Or are they a menopause Twat?

concern.
Brother.
Hey,
bill loved the show.

970
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:55.550
Well thank you.
He says,
I got a situation I could use some advice.

971
00:58:56.090 --> 00:58:59.960
My sister is 16 years old and dating a 22 year old.

972
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:02.240
What the fuck?
Yeah,
I got it.
Fights.

973
00:59:02.241 --> 00:59:07.070
Go out to the goddamn garage and get a fucking shovel.
Dig the hole first.

974
00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:09.950
Ah,
don't do that.
I'm not advocating murder.

975
00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:14.240
Just bury them alive for a few minutes.
Uh,

976
00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:19.670
they met at a church function.
Oh,
for fuck's sakes,

977
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:23.760
dude,
this is making me upset.

978
00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:29.770
My sister is 16 years old,
16 years old and she's dating a 22 year old.

979
00:59:29.771 --> 00:59:33.040
They met at a church function over a year ago and even though he lives two

980
00:59:33.041 --> 00:59:36.520
states away,
they've been keeping in contact.
What the fuck,
dude?

981
00:59:36.521 --> 00:59:40.660
How many more sexual Predator red flags do you need?

982
00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:45.940
He goes,
I just found out my parents have invited him to Thanksgiving this year.

983
00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.800
Do you live in like the Middle East or something?

984
00:59:49.801 --> 00:59:54.240
Is this some sort of custom that is widely accepted in some far away land?

985
00:59:55.530 --> 00:59:59.820
My initial reaction is to beat the shit out of this fucker creep.
Oh,

986
00:59:59.821 --> 01:00:01.800
beat the shit out of this fucking creep.
Sorry.

987
01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.620
I don't think that that will solve anything in the long run,

988
01:00:04.621 --> 01:00:07.320
so I'm trying to keep a level head and be mature about this,

989
01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:10.590
but to be honest with you,
I haven't got a fucking clue as to what to do.

990
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:15.030
My parents are obviously mentally unstable and I'm not equipped to talk sense

991
01:00:15.031 --> 01:00:16.390
into a 16 year old girl said,

992
01:00:16.391 --> 01:00:20.370
if you could tell me what to say to this guy to make him understand in a

993
01:00:20.371 --> 01:00:24.630
nonviolent way that this is wrong and needs to stop,
I'd appreciate it.
See Dude,

994
01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:28.650
you're going on the same journey I,
I started,
you found out immediately.

995
01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:31.350
I'm thinking of getting a shovel and I'm burying this fucking guy in the ground.

996
01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:36.300
But you know,
as I know,
violence is not the way he goes.

997
01:00:36.301 --> 01:00:39.780
The scariest thing about this is that in this weird ass church,

998
01:00:39.781 --> 01:00:44.640
my family belongs to several of my sister's friends have gotten married at 17

999
01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:49.290
and 18 and that just can't happen here.
I know this is a fucked up situation,

1000
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:52.980
but I be grateful for any help you,
you have to offer.
Thank you.

1001
01:00:52.981 --> 01:00:57.140
And Go fuck yourself.
Yeah,
I would look up some stuff about cults.

1002
01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:00.510
I would get some professional help on this one.
Dude.
You know,

1003
01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:04.530
people ask me advice on this and you know,
it's usually much lighter than this,

1004
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.870
but dude,
you're talking about,
God forbid if this guys hooking up with her,

1005
01:01:09.871 --> 01:01:13.170
you get,
you literally have a sex offender on your hands here.

1006
01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.680
Can you get the local authorities involved?
Can you call the cops?

1007
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:21.640
I mean,
I,
I don't know.
I have no idea what to do.

1008
01:01:21.641 --> 01:01:23.350
I'm afraid if you do something like that,

1009
01:01:23.351 --> 01:01:26.800
it's going to make her run into his arms even further.

1010
01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:29.480
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1011
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.370
<v 0>What the fuck?
Yeah,
I don't,</v>

1012
01:01:33.371 --> 01:01:36.090
I don't know what to do because you can't get violent with the guy.

1013
01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:42.260
I don't know.
I have no idea.

1014
01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:45.110
And I don't know if you're making a joke about your parents being mentally

1015
01:01:45.111 --> 01:01:48.680
unstable.
Dude.
This is like some doctor drew shit calling doctor drew.

1016
01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:51.830
If you're going to go the show business route.
All right.

1017
01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:54.830
Cause he's actually a professional.
I'm a fucking idiot.
So I don't listen to me,

1018
01:01:54.831 --> 01:01:59.831
but I would try to get some professional help and with every fiber in my being,

1019
01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:04.160
I hope that you fucking solve this problem because that guy,

1020
01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.580
that guy should be living in a fucking dumpster.
The fuck kind of a quota.

1021
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.900
You're 20 toe,
you know,

1022
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:16.460
that's one of those guys.
What?

1023
01:02:16.461 --> 01:02:19.440
He's fucking 32 he's still going to be going to have to 16 olds.

1024
01:02:19.441 --> 01:02:23.360
I fucking guarantee it.
That's just fight.

1025
01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:24.940
That is fucking creepy.

1026
01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:30.660
The difference in age between 16 and 22 was a fucking lifetime.

1027
01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:38.350
That's disgusting.
Uh,
I dunno sir.
I would get professional help.

1028
01:02:38.351 --> 01:02:42.460
I'm sorry.
There's nothing fucking funny about that at all.
Um,
all right.

1029
01:02:42.461 --> 01:02:47.080
From a young lady.
Oh,
this is great.
A woman writing it.

1030
01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:50.410
I've been trying to get women to write in,
but you know,

1031
01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.670
they probably shut off my podcast because they're decent human beings from a

1032
01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:58.130
younger lady.
A dear bill.
I have a 16 year old off fuck.

1033
01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.590
We're back to 16 year old women.

1034
01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.310
Gelly guess you're dating this 22 year old guy and you're fucking,

1035
01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.240
your older brother's getting into the way the relationship.

1036
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.880
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1037
01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.661
<v 0>All right.
I'm 60.</v>

1038
01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:13.410
I have a 16 year old lady who loves stand up comedy and it's my dream to do

1039
01:03:13.411 --> 01:03:15.840
headlining stand up when I grow up.

1040
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:19.500
Currently I've taking stand up classes with blah blah,
blah.

1041
01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:24.560
Not going to say who you have to get the place in this city and this other city.

1042
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:30.570
Someday I want to open for you,
but I want some advice at a favor.
A favor.

1043
01:03:30.571 --> 01:03:35.520
Oh g.
Um,
I know that it will take a while for me to be amazing at stand up.

1044
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:39.450
So what should I do when I bomb on stage?
Do I just keep bobbing?

1045
01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:43.560
I've only done one standup show,
but I surprisingly did well.
Oh,
good for you.

1046
01:03:43.561 --> 01:03:46.960
You did better than I did.
Not only did okay.
Uh,

1047
01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.680
what should I do after high school?

1048
01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:52.800
I want to move to La and just to open Mike and take classes.

1049
01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:56.580
It will be hard though,
since I'm not 21,
I have to wait outside the clubs,

1050
01:03:56.581 --> 01:04:00.330
which is so annoying.
But if you have a better idea,
please tell me,

1051
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:04.020
uh,
because you know what you're talking about.
Lastly,
the favor,

1052
01:04:04.021 --> 01:04:07.650
it would be amazing if you did an all ages show in Los Angeles to San Diego.

1053
01:04:07.651 --> 01:04:10.740
Thank you for your time.
Uh,
just so you know,

1054
01:04:10.741 --> 01:04:13.170
you're the reason I want to do stand up because you're freaking hilarious.

1055
01:04:13.171 --> 01:04:17.310
That's,
that's great.
All right,
well,
first of all,
you're way ahead of the game.

1056
01:04:17.311 --> 01:04:20.370
You're only 16 years old.
I didn't start until I was almost 24.

1057
01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.130
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1058
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:26.120
<v 0>Um,
as far as moving to la,
I would not do that.</v>

1059
01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:31.430
I would not do that.
I would move to a town.
I would probably more if I was you,

1060
01:04:31.431 --> 01:04:34.820
I haven't moved La,
maybe San Francisco.
Uh,

1061
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:39.500
I would move to a city that has a good comedy scene where you can develop and

1062
01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:43.580
learn how to be a comedian and get some momentum going before you try and start

1063
01:04:43.581 --> 01:04:43.971
in La.

1064
01:04:43.971 --> 01:04:48.710
La is the hardest place as far as I can tell in America to start doing stand up

1065
01:04:48.711 --> 01:04:51.920
comedy because you have all these professional comics who now feel they're ready

1066
01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:56.930
to take a shot moving to la and they're all getting on stage and that they're

1067
01:04:56.931 --> 01:05:01.350
having problems trying to get on stage or at least I did back in the day.
And um,

1068
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.900
<v 2>okay.</v>

1069
01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:07.900
<v 0>So I would give yourself time to develop and um,</v>

1070
01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:11.920
all right,
what else did you yes.
Okay.
Uh,

1071
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:13.600
<v 2>okay.</v>

1072
01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.760
<v 0>What did you say?
You said how did it,
what are you doing?
You're bombing.
Um,</v>

1073
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.080
bobbing is just,
that's just a part of it.
Uh,

1074
01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:28.060
so what'd you say?
What should you do if you start bombing on stage?
Ah,
I duNno.

1075
01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:31.190
Make Fun of the joke that you just told it didn't work.
Make Fun of yourself.

1076
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.300
You just got to stand there and take it and you'll figure out your own way how

1077
01:05:35.301 --> 01:05:37.010
to get through it.
But when you,
Bob,

1078
01:05:37.011 --> 01:05:39.500
don't get down on yourself because it happens to everybody.

1079
01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.900
I've been working on a bit this whole weekend.
It's been,

1080
01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:47.120
I been eating my balls on it every fucking night and it's pissing me off because

1081
01:05:47.121 --> 01:05:49.460
I know it's funny.
I just don't know how to make it funny yet.

1082
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:53.840
So that part of it never ends.
Uh,
what else did you say?

1083
01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.730
Which I do have to highschool.
Don't move to La.
I wouldn't,

1084
01:05:57.731 --> 01:06:00.610
I wouldn't advise that.
I would not advise that.

1085
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:04.750
I would advise my already said what to do.
Uh,

1086
01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:06.190
<v 1>okay.</v>

1087
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:09.080
<v 0>Decided other than that,
just fucking write shit that you think's funny.</v>

1088
01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:11.990
Don't hang out with negative people that bring it down.

1089
01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.910
Don't hang out with other comics who are weirdly competing with you and happy

1090
01:06:16.911 --> 01:06:21.410
slash resenting your success.
You know,
get rid of those fucking people.

1091
01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:25.760
Paying around positive motivated people.
And then you guys,

1092
01:06:25.761 --> 01:06:27.140
you could create your own shit.

1093
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:30.560
Start filming it and then you come here and you stormed the castle and you'll be

1094
01:06:30.561 --> 01:06:34.700
the new wave and I'll be wanting to get into your movie.
So be on your TV shelf.

1095
01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:35.750
All right,
so good luck to you.

1096
01:06:35.751 --> 01:06:38.510
I think that's awesome that you're doing or the 16 you've got more courage than

1097
01:06:38.511 --> 01:06:42.920
I ever had.
All right.
Here we go.
Trying to stop masturbating.

1098
01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.170
Well,
you're talking to the wrong person.

1099
01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:50.173
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1100
01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:53.080
<v 0>Oh,
talking to you about stop masturbating.</v>

1101
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:55.790
You might as well talk to Colonel Sanders about stop frying chicken.

1102
01:06:58.890 --> 01:06:59.723
<v 1>Huh?</v>

1103
01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:03.870
<v 0>Taking the edge off Bill Buford Open.
You get the drover referenced?</v>

1104
01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:05.430
Of course I do.
Uh,

1105
01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:09.450
or is it Beauford that was never like it was the play for,
yes,

1106
01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:14.340
he played for one of those prog bands of the 70s Denise,
I have no idea.

1107
01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:19.120
A big fan of your work.
And I thought Bill Buford.
Right.

1108
01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1109
01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:25.580
<v 0>I used to get him and Alan White confused.
I don't know why.
Big Fan of your work,</v>

1110
01:07:25.581 --> 01:07:29.300
and I thought I'd get your input on this.
I'm trying to stop jerking off.

1111
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:32.390
I'm not afraid of going blind or getting hairy palms or any of that shit.

1112
01:07:32.810 --> 01:07:36.890
I've even read that there are health benefits to masturbating by my primary

1113
01:07:36.891 --> 01:07:41.510
concern.
Is that a beginning to develop premature ejaculation?

1114
01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:45.210
I've never heard of that.

1115
01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.410
Not Premature ejaculation,
but by jerking off that your

1116
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:56.470
well maybe a know yourself too well
right there.
Boom.

1117
01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.690
Right there.
Boom.
You just fucking all it's over.
Uh,

1118
01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:03.230
I also can't help it feel disgusted whenever I bust went off.

1119
01:08:03.231 --> 01:08:05.910
Call it Catholic guilt.
Yeah,
it is Catholic guilt.
Um,

1120
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:10.730
I don't masturbate on an insane basis only once every two or three days.

1121
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:16.320
Jesus Christ.
Dude,
you know,
you like a fucking DH

1122
01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:17.153
<v 1>in my world.</v>

1123
01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:24.230
Uh,
fuck a relief pitcher.
Uh,

1124
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.870
but it's the only sexual activity I'm getting at the moment and I can't go more

1125
01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:30.990
than around nine days without an intense urge to do it through.

1126
01:08:30.991 --> 01:08:32.430
This is really getting too personal for me.

1127
01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:36.120
I have a small Dick and I'm fine with that.
Learning to accept it.

1128
01:08:36.121 --> 01:08:41.121
My Dick has below is below average in length has freed me from my penis envy and

1129
01:08:42.601 --> 01:08:45.900
it was a disproportionately large weight off my chest.

1130
01:08:46.650 --> 01:08:50.760
It's the sexual equivalent to the last rap battle in eight mile.

1131
01:08:51.090 --> 01:08:53.190
You can't tell me Shit I don't already know.

1132
01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.910
But having a small Dick and being a minute man is more than I can take.
Yeah.

1133
01:08:56.911 --> 01:08:59.250
You don't want the Combo platter there.
Uh,

1134
01:08:59.251 --> 01:09:01.530
I know that you've advised people to rub one off,

1135
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:05.460
rub one out on a different occasion than I respect that because things

1136
01:09:05.461 --> 01:09:08.880
definitely come into perspective after you finished Mass Bay.

1137
01:09:08.881 --> 01:09:13.320
But can you suggest any method for people who are trying to hold back on choking

1138
01:09:13.321 --> 01:09:16.470
the chicken?
Thanks in advance and go fuck yourself now.
I can't.

1139
01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:21.780
I can't,
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.
You know,

1140
01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:26.250
I think of most dictators in the world would fucking rub one out or get a

1141
01:09:26.251 --> 01:09:29.220
goddamn handy from some fucking chick dress like a nurse.

1142
01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.100
I don't think there'd be any war until like two in the afternoon.
Uh,

1143
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.150
<v 0>I dunno.
I,
you definitely don't want to just be doing that to yourself.</v>

1144
01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:43.780
You want to be in some sort of a fucking relationship,
uh,

1145
01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:48.000
you're fine with having a small deck as far as that goes a year.

1146
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:50.700
I would definitely go downtown first.

1147
01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:56.100
Make sure you know she's one up on you and then fucking have at it.

1148
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:59.600
But you didn't ask me about that,
so I don't know.
I don't know.

1149
01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.610
I'm throwing this one to Dr. Draw again,

1150
01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:06.830
trying to hold back,
choke with,
I don't think,
say run with it.

1151
01:10:06.831 --> 01:10:10.970
This is the premature ejaculation thing I think might be a problem.
Yeah,

1152
01:10:10.971 --> 01:10:14.900
it is a problem.
You said you don't want that.
So I would consult a,
uh,
you guys,

1153
01:10:14.901 --> 01:10:17.240
you guys are really hit me with some heavy ones this week.

1154
01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:19.053
<v 1>You know,</v>

1155
01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:25.330
<v 0>I don't know what to tell you do I would I would contact a
therapist,</v>

1156
01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:27.100
sex therapist or some shit?

1157
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:28.243
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1158
01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:33.630
<v 0>Let's see.
What the fuck would I do if I was premature ejaculating?</v>

1159
01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:34.923
<v 1>Uh,</v>

1160
01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.100
<v 0>I would rub two out</v>

1161
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:43.220
and then I take my exhausted dick out and then I would see,

1162
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:47.810
I have a go then see how that happened.
That's all I got.
Right.

1163
01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.060
That's what you get when you listen to a free podcasts.

1164
01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:51.200
That's the kind of advice you get.

1165
01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:53.063
<v 1>MMM,</v>

1166
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:58.500
<v 0>yeah,
I would,
I would go to a professional.
All right.
There we go.</v>

1167
01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:04.110
Wow.
Those last two were brutal.
Oh,
the last two audit three,

1168
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:08.130
except for the,
uh,
the standup comedian one was awesome.
That was a nice reprieve.

1169
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:13.950
Um,
anyway,
so that's the podcast for this week.
I will be tweeting and,
uh,

1170
01:11:13.951 --> 01:11:17.970
all the final details about the garage sale,

1171
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.580
the all things comedy garage sale,
and um,

1172
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.820
he can call us up bid on some stuff.

1173
01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:27.300
It helps the wounded warriors project all of us to do a quick spot at the laugh

1174
01:11:27.301 --> 01:11:30.930
factory,
uh,
for Rob Schneider show.
Uh,

1175
01:11:30.931 --> 01:11:35.640
all the proceeds will be benefiting,
um,
all the victims and the survivors,

1176
01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:40.290
I guess I should say of a typhoon out there in the Philippines.

1177
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:44.800
Um,
and that's it.
That's my week.
I got to,

1178
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:48.780
I think I got a Gig in new haven this weekend and I'm going to the Harvard Yale

1179
01:11:48.781 --> 01:11:53.781
game of fucking awesome is that I'll be probably sitting amongst at least the

1180
01:11:54.841 --> 01:11:56.820
next three presidents when I go to that game.

1181
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:59.250
I'm really looking forward to it stuff.
One of the first bowls,

1182
01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:02.770
I think it is the first bowl that was built in this country as far as stadiums.

1183
01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:06.750
Uh,
so really excited to see a game there.
I'll be there with dude.

1184
01:12:06.751 --> 01:12:10.620
I called it Paul Versey and I'm actually going to bet the cowboys with them next

1185
01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:14.820
week just to make this fun,
this whole bet,

1186
01:12:14.821 --> 01:12:18.060
That's the podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
