00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.070
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:05.370
It's bill burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast on Monday,

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.110
October 17th,
2016 what's going on?

4
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:13.800
How I yeah.
Oh,
are you,

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.190
oh look at you.
Um,

6
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:21.360
I am in Washington DC and uh,
I am doing,

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.440
I got three more shows here before I fly to Nashville and then I uh,

8
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.860
take my next special and um,

9
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.660
I think I'm ready to go Saturday night.
I was ready to kill myself after the,

10
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.180
after the show I did cause I was just,

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.220
even though it's showing great people had a good time,

12
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.490
I was just in my head the whole time going and then I'm going to do this joke

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.700
and then I will do this one and then that will flow into,

14
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:54.810
there's one I was in fucking,
I was fighting like I just was in my head.

15
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.960
And uh,
last night I was just like,
you know what?
Fuck it.

16
00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:03.680
Just go up and whatever job feels like it wants to come out and do it that way.

17
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.020
That's the way you always do it.
Just do it that way.
All right.

18
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.230
How many fucking times do you have to learn this God damn lesson.
All right.

19
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.090
You're not the person that writes it all out and just stands up there with the

20
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:20.320
one hand in his pocket and the other one,
you know,
fucking making gestures.

21
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.700
It's not a way.
I'm a fucking,
I dunno.
I,

22
00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:30.130
I got to walk around.
I got to get out there and walk around.
Um,

23
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.420
so I hope that isn't too loud.
I'm a turn this down a little bit.

24
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.280
Turned down the levels.

25
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.930
I didn't bring any of my recording shit cause I'm so fucking psycho focus for

26
00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:45.490
this thing right now.
Um,
so I dunno.

27
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.570
Like you know what's weird is I'm going to do this special right before the

28
00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:52.720
biggest fucking election of my lifetime,

29
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:56.950
considering these are the two worst goddamn candidates and I'm really trying to

30
00:01:56.951 --> 00:02:00.850
see a light at the end of the fucking tunnel.
But what's weird is,
you know,

31
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.210
by the time my shit comes out,
the election's going to be over.

32
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:08.800
And you know how it is when the election's over,
whoever lost within three days.

33
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.190
I mean,
it's like boy band fame.

34
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.540
You'd just gone like,
remember,
remember how quickly Al Gore disappeared?

35
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.710
He just fucking disappeared.
And then like in a month later,

36
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.160
he had like this mountain man beard,
like whatever,

37
00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:27.670
whatever fucking happened to that guy.
Um,

38
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.853
<v 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.640
<v 0>I'll tell you what else was fucked up.</v>

40
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:34.940
You know what they were bitching about Hillary.
And there was saying like,

41
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.150
why is the media so silent because Al Gore got accused of sexual assault.

42
00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:44.160
Why aren't they saying anything?
And it's just like,
I love how all you,

43
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.800
if you just get fucking accused of it,
you know,

44
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:49.390
there's all this shit on the side.

45
00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:52.720
They protect women where it's like don't give up their identities and all of

46
00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:57.090
that,
which I completely agree with and I fucking hate Al Gore,
but he,

47
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.020
he was just,
anybody can just say,

48
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.970
this guy did this shit to me and then all of a sudden it's,
it's all over.

49
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

50
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.040
<v 0>The media and
I dunno,
I,
I saw something recently,</v>

51
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.800
the fuck story was it?
Oh,

52
00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:16.890
there's a movie coming out that beast of a nation.

53
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.280
<v 0>And the guy who directed it got accused and got acquitted.</v>

55
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

56
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.230
<v 0>Of Rape.
And everybody's going like,
you know,</v>

57
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.620
well,
what's the,
what's the deal?
He is like,
well,

58
00:03:30.621 --> 00:03:34.580
he went on trial and they said he was innocent.
You know what I mean?

59
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.180
But people that will follow that person for the rest of their life.

60
00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:40.890
So my thing is,

61
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.690
<v 1>okay,</v>

62
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.740
<v 0>if you get accused of that shit in the public,
you're,
you're never innocent.
So,</v>

63
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.790
<v 1>okay,</v>

64
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.830
<v 0>that guy got accused.
He got acquitted,</v>

65
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.430
<v 1>okay.</v>

66
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.210
<v 0>They said he was innocent of the crime,
you know,
and,</v>

67
00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:58.260
but because everybody knows his fucking name,
you know,
20 goddamn years later,

68
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.460
it's still coming up and tainting of,
uh,
whatever he's doing in his life.

69
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.870
So then it becomes,
well,

70
00:04:03.871 --> 00:04:07.080
I hope he fucking did it because he's getting treated as though he did.

71
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.440
Does that make any fucking sense whatsoever?
You know what I mean?

72
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.610
And there'll be some,
you know,
actually,

73
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:17.410
it doesn't mean that he was innocent.

74
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:20.890
It just means that there wasn't enough evidence to convict.

75
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.020
Um,
which is yet another thing.
But I gotta tell you it like

76
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.770
the one I will say,

77
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.030
and I know he's just been accused his fucking Donald Trump right?

78
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.380
When a bunch of broads came out and said,
oh,
he did this,
he did that,
Yada,
Yada,

79
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:40.960
Yada.
The Clintons are so fucking filthy.
I mean,

80
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.940
<v 1>yeah,</v>

81
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.160
<v 0>I just like,
well,
who knows that this is fucking true,
right?
Like it should,</v>

82
00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:47.540
this is just coming out now.

83
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.660
This guy has been fucking running for office for over a year and a half and it's

84
00:04:50.661 --> 00:04:51.710
just coming out now.

85
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.300
So I took it all with a grain of salt because politics of fucking filthy and no

86
00:04:56.301 --> 00:04:59.300
one's more filthy than the fucking Clintons.
Right.

87
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.270
But one woman finally comes on,

88
00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:05.210
I was riding with the lovely Nia and we're in the car and she goes to tell her

89
00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:07.730
story and rather than it being the usual generic,

90
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.940
and then he did this and he did that and I felt uncomfortable.

91
00:05:10.941 --> 00:05:15.350
And people are like,
what the fuck?
She goes,
whatever.

92
00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:17.450
She's poor woman's like in her twenties,

93
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.010
and then this fucking old creep is coming at her with his orange fucking hair.

94
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.430
Right.
Which I guess that's kind of self hatred there,
but I mean,

95
00:05:25.431 --> 00:05:27.530
at least mine's real.
Um,

96
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.900
and when he makes a move on her,
she pushes him away and she goes,
I said,

97
00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:36.180
get real.
And then she goes,

98
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.020
he then pushed his genitals in like toward thrusted his genitals towards me when

99
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.220
get real me.
They were like,
oh my God,

100
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.680
that definitely happened.
That's just too,
it's just too fucking specific.

101
00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:56.280
So I'm being a little hypocritical here because the person wasn't put on trial.

102
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.733
But,
um,

103
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.150
<v 2>but anyways,
this is what the fuck I wanted to talk about.
Um,</v>

104
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.230
I gotta do my special this week and you know something I don't give a fuck.

105
00:06:07.231 --> 00:06:11.220
Cause people are always like,
well the standup special,
it should be timeless.

106
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.640
It should be timeless.
It's like,
let me ask you this.
I mean,

107
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.660
and I'm not putting myself obviously in the same category.
Do you give a fuck?

108
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.813
You know,

109
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.950
if you listen to an old Kinison thing and he's talking about,
you know,

110
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.440
who those fucking idiots trying to put like warning labels on albums,

111
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.690
you know,
does it matter that it then,

112
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.700
or like you listen to a Richard Pryor and he's talking about Muhammad Ali and

113
00:06:39.541 --> 00:06:42.450
shit.
Like,
I don't,
I don't mind that a dates itself.
Fuck it.

114
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.200
Cause I know what it felt like Saturday night when I was just like,

115
00:06:46.201 --> 00:06:47.850
do not talk about that shit.

116
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.200
By the time this special comes up that stuff will already be gone.

117
00:06:52.201 --> 00:06:54.370
I don't give a fuck.
I'm going to talk about it.
And um,

118
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.930
it seems dated when we're editing.
That's what the fuck I'll do.

119
00:06:57.931 --> 00:07:02.640
I hope this isn't boring to you to take you through the my new show of doing a

120
00:07:02.641 --> 00:07:06.540
standup special.
But anyways,
I'm having a great time here in,

121
00:07:06.541 --> 00:07:09.120
I'm in DC.

122
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.330
I went over to Georgetown yesterday.

123
00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:15.750
I just sort of walk the city a little bit with a Joe Barden neck,

124
00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:20.751
which was awesome because this is one of the most confusing fucking cities is

125
00:07:21.271 --> 00:07:24.460
far as like,
you know,

126
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.340
trying to figure out basically where you're at.

127
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.880
Like there was three areas of this city that I was familiar with,

128
00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:35.410
but I didn't know how they connected.
There was the DC Improv,

129
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.670
there was the w hotel near the White House where I've stayed a number of times.

130
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.493
Um,

131
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.390
and now there's like the National Theatre and where I'm staying this time.

132
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.460
And,
uh,

133
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.560
the thing about DC is it's all like,
you know,
the address is like,
you know,

134
00:07:56.561 --> 00:08:00.820
whatever,
six,
five,
nine Pennsylvania Avenue,

135
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.310
but then it's like southwest,
northwest fucking east or whatever.

136
00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:10.480
And that's just like,
how the fuck do,
I mean you need like a Goddamn compass.

137
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.680
Just the way this whole thing is laid out.
So,
uh,

138
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.730
yesterday I actually did a fucking walk and I kind of walk to all three of those

139
00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:21.850
places and like,
I didn't realize I'm at the national theater.
I'm like,

140
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:24.610
I wonder where the w and the White House's compared to that.
And I was like,

141
00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:25.870
fucking two blocks over.

142
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.290
And then like another two blocks in about six blocks up was the Improv.

143
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:34.291
So I feel like I have that little corridor all la memorized.

144
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.930
And,
um,
I finally flew into fucking Reagan airport.

145
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:39.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

146
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.380
<v 2>You know,
rather than flying out to fucking Dallas,
which is like 30 miles,</v>

147
00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:46.110
I think west of the city is some shit like that north.

148
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:50.820
I don't know what the fuck it is.
So I land and I check a bag,
which I never do.

149
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.630
I never fucking check a bag.
Like when I went to Europe for like a month,

150
00:08:54.631 --> 00:08:57.870
touring took a quick vacation.
Um,

151
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.130
I had a little fucking overhead compartment bag and you know something,

152
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.150
it was fine.
Oh,
hang on a second.
My breakfast is here.

153
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.380
All right,
I'm back.
Um,

154
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:17.290
what guy was hilarious guy delivering the food.
I was like,
Hey,

155
00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:20.350
what's up?
And he was just like,
hey,
where are you aiming to point?

156
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.280
Uh,
over there on the table.
Be Fine.
Okay.
And you are your breakfast.

157
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.100
Real weird voice.
Um,
anyways,

158
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.650
at a terrorist beard too,
you know,
pre nine 11,

159
00:09:35.651 --> 00:09:39.730
I would call it an Abe Lincoln beards.
You know,

160
00:09:39.731 --> 00:09:42.700
he just got the beard and no mustache.
That was the Abe Lincoln.

161
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.960
The fucking Chin strap with the terrorist beard is the fucking no mustache.

162
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.740
Chinstrap but then it sort of frizzed out,
you know,

163
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.970
that's a terrorist spirit unless you're black.
If you're black,

164
00:09:57.971 --> 00:10:02.360
that just means you from Philadelphia.
Okay.
Plowing ahead here.
Um,

165
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.850
the hell was I talking about?
Oh,
who gives a shit?
Was it even that importance?

166
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:13.280
Probably not.
Um,
anyways,
I had a great week,
uh,

167
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.180
before I came out here.
I had a really cool experience.
Um,

168
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.510
do you guys remember a couple of years ago I was raving about that John Fabro

169
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.040
movie.
Um,
uh,

170
00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.940
chef the haven't seen the movie.
It's,
it's phenomenal.

171
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.910
It's just such a great,
great movie and uh,

172
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.470
and just don't be hungry when you watch it because you will,

173
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.050
you will consume like 12,000 calories after watching it because,
uh,

174
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.930
some of the food,
basically all of the food that they make looks unbelievable.

175
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.400
So long story short,
you know,

176
00:10:46.401 --> 00:10:50.510
like whenever they have like end credit stuff on like a movie,
um,

177
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.960
you know,

178
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.680
it's usually like outtakes or something from the actress scrolling up or,
or,

179
00:10:56.681 --> 00:11:01.390
or whatever.
Um,
John had to learn how to basically,

180
00:11:01.391 --> 00:11:04.270
I guess,
you know,
they had a dad,
he had to take cooking classes and stuff,

181
00:11:04.271 --> 00:11:06.420
so he looked like he was an actual chef.
So the,
the,

182
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.820
the movie movies character would ring true,
you know,
all that actory stuff.

183
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:14.380
So there was a guy showing them how to make a grilled cheese sandwich.
This guy,

184
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.230
a chef,
Roy Choi,
who,
uh,

185
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:21.130
had the Kogi truck started the whole food truck movement out here in la and

186
00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:22.360
everything.
And um,

187
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.540
he was showing them how to do it and John just decided to film it when he,

188
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.050
when he,

189
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:34.000
when he was making this cheeseburger and it was like so fucking intense when the

190
00:11:34.001 --> 00:11:37.120
guy was doing like all crunched down looking at it and he was moving the grilled

191
00:11:37.121 --> 00:11:39.150
cheese grilled cheese sandwich.
You just thinking like,

192
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.040
this is something like a fucking 12 year old can make,

193
00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:44.680
but watching this guy do it and the level of intensity,

194
00:11:44.681 --> 00:11:48.640
the game seven fucking intensity that this guy had when he made it,

195
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.950
I was just like,
what?
It like blew me away.
It was like,

196
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:57.910
I've never been that into fucking cooking something ever.
You know,

197
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.400
I never seen it.
Right.
So a long story short,
um,

198
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.090
I don't know if I'm supposed to say this or anything.
I watched him give a shit.

199
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.260
This would be like a teaser,
but a fabulous been like filming some stuff.

200
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.820
Um,
of him cooking with this chef and

201
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.930
I ran into him out here when he said,
hey,
that guy,
you know,

202
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:22.990
who made the cheeseburger and I made the grilled cheese sandwich is going to be

203
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:25.180
out there.
You want to come out and watch him make it?
And I was like,
yeah,

204
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:26.740
fucking absolutely.
I would love to.

205
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.170
So I was hanging off set and I got to watch them make it and everything.
And uh,

206
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.650
they pulled me in,
let me fucking make the grilled cheese sandwich with them.

207
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:40.270
It was one of the coolest,
most surreal things I've done in this business.

208
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:45.550
And I'm,
the fucking grilled cheese sandwich was so good,
like an idiot.

209
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:48.520
I'm out here on the road and they had a grilled cheese sandwich on the room,

210
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:52.420
service of a fucking hotel and I order it like it's going to be as good.

211
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:57.490
And uh,
and it wasn't,
um,

212
00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:02.680
it sounds out I learned that fucking lesson,
but a,
I want to thank him and uh,

213
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.020
chef Roy for letting me hang out.
I had a such a fucking great time.
Um,

214
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.250
I learned so much shit about cooking.
And,
and what was funny was he never,

215
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.270
he never went like,
oh,
this is how you do this,
this,
that.

216
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.340
You just kind of went in there and did it.

217
00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:24.341
And what amazed me was afterwards when I was thinking about all the stuff that I

218
00:13:25.131 --> 00:13:27.380
saw him do,
like,
um,

219
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.030
just how you would just like move the grilled cheese sandwich around how he

220
00:13:32.031 --> 00:13:36.040
would,
you know,
fuck with the temperature.
I mean,
I was like a fucking,

221
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.590
I'm a robot when I cook.
I'm literally like,
you know,
whatever,

222
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.450
quarter tablespoon of salt.

223
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.930
And I like take out it out and I measure it and flick the top.
Like these guys,

224
00:13:44.931 --> 00:13:47.900
none of,
they don't use any sort of measuring whatsoever.

225
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.500
They're constantly tasting the ship and uh,

226
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.800
and then adjusting that temperature off.
But whatever my temperature is,
act,

227
00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:58.010
that was,
that's what the fuck we're cooking at,
which makes no sense

228
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.000
when you really think about it.
But I was just like,

229
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.590
it's like being completely locked in on,

230
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:06.790
on your rack as opposed to just out there kind of flowing with it.
And,
um,

231
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.510
what is funny,
so they would teach me now you've got to taste it as you're going,

232
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.440
you know,
so I was doing that and uh,
John mentioned,
he goes,
yeah,

233
00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:18.100
when you cook like this,
it tastes great,
but by the time you're done,
he goes,

234
00:14:18.101 --> 00:14:20.740
you don't want to eat it because you've tried it so many times.

235
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:22.810
You were actually kind of full a little bit.
And that was kind of,

236
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.770
that was kind of the deal with everything except for the grilled cheese
sandwich.

237
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.660
Um,
made a Cuban sandwich.
It was,
it was crazy.
The whole thing was crazy.

238
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:35.560
So,
um,
so that happened.
And A,

239
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:37.960
I'm recording this shit on garage band and as always,

240
00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:41.290
I have no idea how much time has gone by.

241
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.510
I should have just looked at the clock up top,
but I didn't.

242
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:44.830
But this is the new me.

243
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.170
This is the new calmer me who refuses to let technology piss him off.

244
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:55.840
Do you know I spent an hour and a half the opening night Bruins,
um,

245
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.890
there opening night there,
first fucking game.
Who the fuck did they play?

246
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:05.090
They play Toronto Saturday.
I don't even remember.

247
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.150
But since like 2007 2008 I have been,

248
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.480
you know,

249
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:16.480
I've had the center ice package and I've had an account online and I'm able to

250
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:21.260
just sign in and watch the fucking games.
Lo and behold this year I can't,

251
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.290
so I don't flip out.
I call up,

252
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.430
I spent an hour and a fucking half talking to people from Malaysia.

253
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.260
Okay.
Cause I finally got one woman to tell me where she was at,

254
00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:34.790
cause this first guy was going like,
he,
you know,

255
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:38.330
he's just talking to me and I'm like,
yeah,
I want to watch the hockey.

256
00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:40.970
And he's like hockey.
I'm like,
yes,
hockey.
He goes,

257
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.600
just like ice hockey.
I'm like,
yeah,

258
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.740
Bruins original six,
2011 Stanley Cup champions.

259
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.510
And I was like,
don't flip up.

260
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.050
And finally I was on the phone with this guy for like 45 minutes.

261
00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:55.700
He couldn't figure it out,
what the fucking problem was.

262
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:00.890
And I got a little heated.
I was just like,
dude,
you know,

263
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.340
I'm not trying to be a jerk,
but there's a little bit of a language barrier here.

264
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:06.590
And you didn't know what hockey was to start with.

265
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.950
I should have considered that as an omen.
I,

266
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.140
we're 45 minutes and if we haven't figured it out yet like this,

267
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:16.490
this isn't working out.
Okay,
have a nice evening.
And he said,
okay,
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.070
And then I felt bad and then I just fucking hung up.

269
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:22.790
And then I called back and then I got another person and that and she's going

270
00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:27.290
like hockey,
like ice hockey,
right?
Same fucking thing.
And I was saying,

271
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:28.880
well this is the problem I'm having.

272
00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:32.450
It's like I'm literally trying to watch something that the person on the other

273
00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:35.360
side of the phone doesn't know what it is and they're on the other side of the

274
00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:39.770
world.
I go like,
where are you right now?
And she goes,
Asia,

275
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.380
I go,
you were in Asia.
And she goes,
yes.
She goes,

276
00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:43.910
I hope that's not going to be a problem.

277
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.650
Which made me feel like a Trump supporter.
I was like,
no,
it's not a prom.

278
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:49.820
But you know what I mean?
I go,
you know,

279
00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:53.720
if he would try to watch cricket and you had to call me up and like cricket,

280
00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.530
like the insect or the sport once you get frustrated.

281
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.590
So long story short,
I spent an hour and a half,

282
00:17:00.591 --> 00:17:03.530
I spent like half the fucking game on the phone and they still couldn't figure

283
00:17:03.531 --> 00:17:06.650
it out.
And I just said,
you know what,
to hell with it.

284
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:11.540
And I felt my wife watching me and then she kept coming in and then she was

285
00:17:11.541 --> 00:17:14.270
trying to like get upset for me,
you know,

286
00:17:14.271 --> 00:17:17.150
cause she didn't want to see the time bomb go off.
And uh,

287
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:22.040
I actually held it together and I didn't get to see one second of the game.

288
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.030
And uh,
I guess they have some new thing this year.
You can no longer stream it.

289
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:31.310
You have to pay for for both now.
I Dunno,

290
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.650
they got a t and t bought them.

291
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.940
So now you have to pay for both because that's how corporations,

292
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.583
<v 3>yeah,</v>

293
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:49.800
<v 2>to make like a zillion dollars.
They not,
and they now have to make fucking,</v>

294
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.120
<v 1>okay,</v>

295
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.320
<v 4>I got to make,
you know,
two zone of dollars.
It's just like,</v>

296
00:17:53.321 --> 00:17:55.000
why can't you constant just be happy.

297
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.473
<v 1>Okay.</v>

298
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.180
<v 4>With the 70 foot yacht,
why do you always have to be run 94?</v>

299
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.730
<v 1>Yeah.
Fucking unbelievable.
Then it just a,</v>

300
00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.990
<v 2>I don't know,
you know,
it's,
listen to your fucking,</v>

301
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.810
I'm gonna Start Moving this computer cause I know it gets really loud when I do

302
00:18:11.811 --> 00:18:16.460
it.
Sorry.
Um,
I was listening to NPR,
right?

303
00:18:16.461 --> 00:18:18.800
Well my wife was listening to it and I was tolerating it.

304
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:22.250
I like some of the fucking music,
but just like their politics.
It's just,
it's,

305
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.153
it's,
it's so,

306
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.410
it's so childlike to just be sitting there leaning all the way to one fucking

307
00:18:27.411 --> 00:18:32.030
side.
It's just like,
really nobody with a blue tie does anything wrong.

308
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.770
Everybody with a red tie is an asshole.
It's almost,
it's like fucking political,

309
00:18:36.771 --> 00:18:39.170
like racism in a way.
Um,

310
00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.910
but everybody thinks that they're a fucking safe,
you know,

311
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.790
one of the dumbest things ever.
And those Trump rallies,

312
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:50.030
like there's somebody had like a sign or a tee shirt that says,

313
00:18:50.031 --> 00:18:51.380
fuck your feelings.

314
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.940
I love how people on the right just think there's so fucking like hardcore and

315
00:18:55.941 --> 00:19:00.380
like,
you know,
people can't handle the truth.
You know what I mean?

316
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.440
You know what they're like people on the right that I liked that they liked

317
00:19:03.441 --> 00:19:07.850
those,
you know,
like you haven't made some chicken.
She'll just say some shit.

318
00:19:07.851 --> 00:19:10.970
Like,
you know,
guys are intimidated by me.
You know,
they can't,

319
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.220
they can't handle me.
You know?
And then,
you know,

320
00:19:13.221 --> 00:19:16.100
joke I used to do my act as like,
hey,
you ever think maybe get just content.

321
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.490
You know?
I mean that's,
I'm not saying you are,

322
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.360
but that's definitely a possibility,
you know,

323
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.630
that could be behind door number three and that could be the fucking answer,

324
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.880
<v 0>you know?
Yes.
Self-Involved shithead.
I just,
I don't know.</v>

325
00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:31.983
<v 1>Wow.</v>

326
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.200
<v 0>And then like people on the left,
I remember one time I was doing it,</v>

327
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.073
I was doing them,

328
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.010
I had a small part in a movie and we were shooting in New Orleans and at our

329
00:19:40.011 --> 00:19:43.970
hotel,
like this big Republican convention was coming.

330
00:19:43.971 --> 00:19:48.560
So they had this big banner,
it was all in red.
So one of the producers on,

331
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.430
on the,
uh,
on the movie was just so,
she was just like,

332
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.210
oh my God,
did you see that banner?
I was just like,

333
00:19:56.211 --> 00:20:01.100
Jesus am I in like where am I right now?
And I just looked at us like,

334
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.440
you know,
people are allowed to be Republicans.

335
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.400
<v 2>She just goes,
oh,
I know.</v>

336
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.870
<v 0>No,
I'm just being that person and blend that I think to fucking drive me up the</v>

337
00:20:10.871 --> 00:20:15.310
wall.
Well,
cheap bill,
aren't you just the perfect fucking person?
I'm a yeah,

338
00:20:15.311 --> 00:20:18.700
you know what I am,
I'm a fucking conspiracy theorist.
And once you become that,

339
00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.970
you know,
you lose a lot of friends,
you drive people nuts,

340
00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:26.920
but you start trying to look behind whatever the fuck they showed you.

341
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:31.090
And like I don't think it fucking matters which person when's this?
Because

342
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.340
you know the people on the other side,

343
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.560
because they make in your fucking pay for the,
the,

344
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:41.750
the center ice package on TV and now on cable they got negative,

345
00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.130
an extra revenue stream.

346
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.790
This selling all your fucking inflammation and they've got all this money,

347
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.220
they money on both horses.

348
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.360
<v 2>So it doesn't fucking matter.</v>

349
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:55.330
So I'm listening to NPR with my wife and they just sort of casually mentioned

350
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:58.660
that scientists said the Great Barrier Reef is now dead.

351
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.800
And you know what they segwayed into after that?
Uh,

352
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:04.540
the results of the Dodgers game.

353
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.790
So,
um,
I don't know.

354
00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:17.750
I just think below it were completely fucked and I want to thank whoever created

355
00:21:17.751 --> 00:21:21.950
the Great Barrier Reef.
I'm sorry.
We finally wrapped it around a fucking tree.

356
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.000
That's what we're like.
We're like a bunch of fucking rich kids in our,
and our,

357
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:29.240
our parents bought us this beautiful fucking car and we're just out there doing

358
00:21:29.241 --> 00:21:33.380
neutral drops and fucking slamming it into trees and a,

359
00:21:33.381 --> 00:21:36.080
we're going to fuck the whole thing up,
you know?

360
00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:40.640
But unlike rich kids' parents,
I don't think Mommy's gonna get us another car.

361
00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.600
Do you know when I was in fucking high school and there was these two kids,

362
00:21:44.601 --> 00:21:46.130
right?
These two rich kids,

363
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.600
one of them got a fucking Pontiac Trans am

364
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.250
like a brand new one.
The F body,
you know,

365
00:21:54.251 --> 00:21:58.540
the one that everybody fucking loved in the 80s,
the night rider version.

366
00:21:58.541 --> 00:22:02.500
He got the fucking trans and this kid was like a 1617 year old kid.

367
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.070
He had a brand new like 19 whatever,

368
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.340
85 86 trans-am.

369
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.320
So the other rich kids,
parents,
they're like competing.
But this other kid,

370
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:19.000
a fucking 1985 or 1986 IROC Z,

371
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.790
I mean they were pulling up to this school,

372
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.150
their car was worth twice what their teacher's car was worth.

373
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.260
I remember there was this teacher,
a foreign language teacher,

374
00:22:29.261 --> 00:22:33.220
and he had this giant boat from the early seventies and the fucking,

375
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.480
the door lock was like the door wouldn't close.

376
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.450
And to this day there's no excuse for this guy.

377
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:42.940
Now I could just get in the fucking door,
close up,
fixed.

378
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:48.480
He fucking tied like a quarter inch rope around like the handle of the door and

379
00:22:49.511 --> 00:22:53.890
then like 15 times around his head rest and he'd have to get out the fucking

380
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:54.970
passenger side.

381
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.770
And I'm one of the great things about getting old is you stop giving a fuck

382
00:22:59.771 --> 00:23:04.480
about what people think about you.
But um,
for the most part that's a great thing.

383
00:23:04.481 --> 00:23:06.580
But in that instance,
that was not a good thing.

384
00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.340
That was not a good thing for people to see because being a teacher as a

385
00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:13.630
tremendous,
tremendous profession,
but,
um,

386
00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.310
you can't show up in a piss yellow fucking

387
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.780
both that you got the fucking door tied to the head rest.
I mean,

388
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:25.080
as much as you love something,
you want to be able to support a fucking family.

389
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.120
I always stopped looking at that.

390
00:23:27.121 --> 00:23:29.880
Looking back years later that there might've been a half dozen people that were

391
00:23:29.881 --> 00:23:33.480
considering being a teacher myself,
one of them.
And once you saw that,

392
00:23:33.481 --> 00:23:35.370
you were like,
yeah,
you know what?
I don't think I want to do that.

393
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.400
I want to walk around with a dirty sport code having to get out of the passenger

394
00:23:39.401 --> 00:23:40.500
side of my fucking car,

395
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.170
cause I can't even afford to get the God damn door lock fixed.

396
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.360
You dropped like three of the four years I was in high school.

397
00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:50.450
This guy would pull up in that fucking car.
Um,
so anyways,

398
00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:52.640
these two kids got the these cars and um,

399
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.200
<v 1>okay,</v>

400
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.880
<v 2>so of course you're driving around like maniacs.</v>

401
00:23:55.881 --> 00:23:59.000
Of course everybody's drinking and driving.
This was the 80s.
This was like a,

402
00:23:59.001 --> 00:24:02.190
this is,
you know,
this was some sort of a,
I dunno,

403
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:05.390
it was an activity that was done.
You went out,

404
00:24:05.391 --> 00:24:08.510
you found somewhat of age to buy a case of beer and then you just drove around

405
00:24:08.511 --> 00:24:09.740
town.
There was nothing to do.

406
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.550
You drove around town and tried to run into other kids you went to your high

407
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:17.070
school with and they would be driving around,
you know,

408
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.870
with the 12 pack in their car.
And he'd be like,
where you go?

409
00:24:19.871 --> 00:24:23.330
And then you'd find some dead end street and you all go down there and then the

410
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:26.690
cops would come down and break it up and you drive around.

411
00:24:26.691 --> 00:24:29.360
Everybody would gather someplace else.
It was weird.

412
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.910
There was no cell phones and somehow everybody figured out where the hell

413
00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:34.730
everyone was going.
Um,
so long story short,

414
00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:36.860
the kid who had the treads and ended up fucking

415
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.510
<v 1>okay,</v>

416
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.690
<v 2>you don't go into fast,
pushed it past the limit and uh,</v>

417
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.680
went flying into a bunch of trees.
Fortunately it was smaller trees,

418
00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:48.440
so the trees lost the battle.
But he totaled his fucking car.

419
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.660
That was right as we were graduating.

420
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.580
So you know what his parents did to teach them a lesson?

421
00:24:55.581 --> 00:24:57.080
They went out and they bought him a corvette.

422
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.540
So is the thing now he's got the corvette,
he fucked up.
He totaled his car.

423
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.300
They went out,
not only bought him a brand new car,

424
00:25:08.301 --> 00:25:10.790
they bought them an even better car.
He had a corvette.

425
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.080
So now the other kid who didn't fuck up his car is now looking at is Iraq.

426
00:25:15.081 --> 00:25:16.340
Like it's a piece of shit.

427
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.610
So within three months he then had a corvette and beyond,
you know,

428
00:25:21.611 --> 00:25:24.800
so you could one up the other kid,
he um,

429
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:27.810
he had a custom interior.

430
00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:31.380
He had like all this would put on the inside of it because the,
uh,

431
00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:36.150
the eighties Corvettes,
the interior was unbelievably plane.
And um,

432
00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.550
and that was the last day was saw of either one of them.

433
00:25:39.551 --> 00:25:43.030
Cause then I graduate except for the kid who got the custom corvette.
Hey,

434
00:25:43.031 --> 00:25:44.140
I ran into a bar,

435
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:49.030
ran into him in a bar about two years ago.

436
00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:50.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

437
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.610
<v 2>And,
um,</v>

438
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.920
he was hammered and proceeded to say some of the most racist Shit I've ever

439
00:25:56.921 --> 00:25:59.920
heard in my life.
And I just sort of slowly back the way,
like,
all right buddy,

440
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.820
see it another 30 years.
Um,

441
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.110
anyways,
let's read some advertising here at this point.

442
00:26:08.111 --> 00:26:11.590
Let me see if I can find where the fuck I'm at.
I'm an idiot.

443
00:26:11.591 --> 00:26:13.190
I didn't put the fucking advertising it.

444
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.980
Now you have to listen to all of these clickings I apologize.
Sorry.

445
00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:22.210
Sorry.
One last click and wait.
All right.

446
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.210
Oh Jesus.
Look who's here.
It's sorry.
It's our,
it's our favorite.

447
00:26:25.211 --> 00:26:30.030
[inaudible] I'll walk me undies.
Me.
Andy.

448
00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.040
Who the fuck are you gonna vote for?
But do do doot me undies.

449
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.440
Mandy's the fucking dope or the whore.

450
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.080
I don't know who you're going to vote for,

451
00:26:38.081 --> 00:26:41.860
but I know they both should be seeing the door cause they both suck.

452
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:46.640
One's kind of a,
the other is a fucking grip.
I don't know.

453
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.980
None of it's funny to me anymore.
Um,

454
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.520
can you imagine if Hillary Clinton,
Fuck Dick Cheney.

455
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.390
Could you imagine what fucking what?
What would that baby,

456
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.140
the capabilities of that baby.
You know what I mean?

457
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:06.710
I think that that baby would be the last person on earth with all the fucking AI

458
00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:09.510
robots and even the AI robots would be like,
yeah,

459
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.580
we're not fucking with that one.
All right.

460
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.480
I think we took this Westworld thing far enough,
but this one here,
we'll just,

461
00:27:15.481 --> 00:27:16.710
you know,
we'll keep an eye on it.

462
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.500
There's no other human for this thing to breed with.

463
00:27:19.501 --> 00:27:24.470
We'll just let it slowly die out
and uh,
you know what I mean?
Just sorta,

464
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.470
just leave it the fuck alone.
All right.
Me,
Andy's,
everybody.
A picture.

465
00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:31.920
A world where putting on a new pair of underwear isn't just fresh.

466
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.400
You're stepping into a better day.
Think about it.

467
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:38.460
Underwear is the first thing you put on and the last thing you take off.

468
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.490
Why would you settle for anything less than the best feeling underwear on the

469
00:27:41.491 --> 00:27:42.710
planet?
Um,
you,

470
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.860
Andy's focuses solely on producing the most comfortable underwear you've ever

471
00:27:46.861 --> 00:27:50.160
experienced.
I can't even tell you what I just fucking picture there.

472
00:27:50.161 --> 00:27:54.450
I just pictured a bunch of people standing there as these me undies people had

473
00:27:54.451 --> 00:27:56.480
like,
you know,
you know what a maxi pad is shaped like,

474
00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.730
but it's made out of that modal modal,
you know,

475
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:03.300
and they just fucking slapping it on everybody's under carriage and then they

476
00:28:03.301 --> 00:28:06.950
just look at the look of bliss or fucking discomfort on their face.
But like,
Nah,

477
00:28:06.951 --> 00:28:11.250
it's not soft enough yet.
Sorry.
I've been watching a lot of shit about robots.

478
00:28:11.251 --> 00:28:15.270
So the whole human thing is starting to fucking float away here.
All right.

479
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:16.380
Uh,

480
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.370
my friends at me undies sent me a few pairs a while back and now I can't imagine

481
00:28:20.371 --> 00:28:24.030
wearing anything else.
Of course I can.
I can imagine wearing fucking anything,

482
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:28.170
a human face.
You know,
I've watched Hannibal Lecter,
um,

483
00:28:28.171 --> 00:28:31.830
it really makes each day that much better.
They sent me two pairs.

484
00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:35.970
One was actually my size and the other one was the Greg Louganis cut,

485
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:40.860
uh,
which I wore one time and my wife almost passed out.

486
00:28:40.861 --> 00:28:43.150
She laughed so hard,
um,

487
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.430
just picture me standing and there was sort of pinkish red and they were

488
00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:51.900
unbelievably tight.
And,
uh,
I was not in good shape,
so my fucking,

489
00:28:51.901 --> 00:28:55.200
my pasty fucking stomach was and,
and love handles.

490
00:28:55.201 --> 00:28:58.410
What kind of hanging over the top.
Oh,
there's a fucking image for you.

491
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.620
Take that one to lunch.
All right.

523
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:53.620
floor affordable.
This is really starting to feel like a cult.

524
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.490
Might been the time I almost accidentally joined fork could Scientology.
Ah,

525
00:30:57.491 --> 00:30:59.680
right.
Now's your chance.
I didn't almost join it.

526
00:30:59.681 --> 00:31:03.820
I just didn't realize what it was.
You know,
I thought it was an acting class.

527
00:31:03.821 --> 00:31:06.550
It wasn't acting class,
but it was run by Scientology and they were all like,

528
00:31:06.551 --> 00:31:11.290
we have our own parking,
we have our own security.
I literally said in,
I go,

529
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:13.150
Jesus Christ,
I feel like I'm joining a cult.

530
00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:15.970
And the guy's eyes did something weird and he was trying to figure out if I was

531
00:31:15.971 --> 00:31:18.010
being a wise ass or if I was fucking around.

532
00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.500
And then once I figured out what it was,
I blew them off.

533
00:31:20.501 --> 00:31:24.460
And then they kept calling me and I finally fucking picked up and it was like,

534
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:29.290
did we lose you?
It's like,
yeah,
yeah,
you did.
All right.
Right now.

535
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.120

539
00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:50.860
Go to dollar shave club.com/bird that's dollar shave club.com/bar did I ever

540
00:31:50.861 --> 00:31:54.910
tell you guys a Scientology story?
I read the other advertising later.

541
00:31:54.911 --> 00:31:59.340
This is more interesting.
All right.
So,
um,

542
00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.470
this is like fucking,
I don't know how many years ago this is.

543
00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:09.110
Bill Clinton was still in office,
I think when this happened.
And um,

544
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:11.523
<v 1>okay.</v>

545
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:15.550
<v 2>Basically I need to take an acting class.
I'm living in Los Angeles</v>

546
00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:20.820
and I needed to take an acting class,
right?
So,
uh,

547
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.151
you know,
whatever.

548
00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:28.230
So somebody suggested this fucking place and I went over there.

549
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:33.270
It was a Beverly hills play house,
which the name of this fucking place.

550
00:32:33.271 --> 00:32:38.271
And I went over there and I show up for the act of class and the teacher goes,

551
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:43.700
this is so fucking weird.
He just goes,
oh,
it's big.
Class was packed.

552
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.720
And it was a well known actor too.
So I was like,
wow,
man,

553
00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:49.940
this is going to be a fucking great class.
And it was,

554
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:53.150
it was a great class other than the fucking creepy vibe.

555
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:57.110
So to start the class,
the guy goes,
okay,

556
00:32:57.111 --> 00:33:01.700
does anybody have any news they want to share with the class?

557
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.470
Hmm.
All right.

558
00:33:03.471 --> 00:33:08.471
So people raise their hands and basically it was actors talking about what they

559
00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:13.760
booked that week.
And um,
you know,
and there's a thing I guess,

560
00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:15.520
you know,
amongst actors as you're starting out,

561
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.070
you get envious and you get jealous.
So I guess this was a reaction to this,

562
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:23.510
what this is,
this whole exercise is about people put their hands up,

563
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.500
this is like,
you know,
fucking the mid nineties or some shit.
And so it'd be like,

564
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:32.480
yeah,
I just booked,
I booked a guest star on,
on,
uh,

565
00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.320
on friends and,

566
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:39.980
and then the whole class like ridiculously loud and forever [inaudible] amount

567
00:33:39.981 --> 00:33:43.130
of time we'll just go woo woo.

568
00:33:43.131 --> 00:33:47.840
Like clapping and screaming.
Like somebody just cured cancer

569
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.760
and then it all died down.
It was just like,
what the fuck was that?

570
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.900
And then somebody else goes,
oh yeah,
hey,
I just,
uh,
you know,

571
00:33:56.901 --> 00:34:01.460
I just booked a reoccurring on union square.
If it crazy.

572
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.020
So then what's,
that shit dies down.
I was immediately like,
Hey man,

573
00:34:06.021 --> 00:34:10.550
I knew la was a little different,
but what the fuck is this?
They go a,
Hey,

574
00:34:10.551 --> 00:34:15.070
we've got a couple of new students here auditing the class.
Uh,

575
00:34:15.071 --> 00:34:19.130
he just moved here from New York City,
please welcome bill Burke.
And they,
they,

576
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:24.310
they clapped and cheered just as loud as they did for the other people that book

577
00:34:26.291 --> 00:34:28.090
like friends.
But here's the thing,
when they were cheering,

578
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:29.620
no one was looking at anyone.

579
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

580
00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:34.290
<v 2>It would just sort of staring straight ahead,</v>

581
00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:37.350
clapping and screaming as loud as you possibly could.

582
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.520
And I remember like my face turn red,
like I got embarrassing.
What the fuck?

583
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.300
And then that's when I,
I,
um,
you know,

584
00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:49.560
after the class we took the first break and the,
the,

585
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.830
the act or teaching the class and the actors were great,
you know,

586
00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:57.120
other than the weird vibe,
right?
So I fucking go up there and the other guy goes,

587
00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.820
how are you doing?
And I looked at him,
he was like,
yeah,
doing good,

588
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.370
because he's a great actor.
He totally read me.
He goes,
uh,

589
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:07.800
he goes to the beginning of the class was,
um,
was that a little bit too much?

590
00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.350
I was like,
ah,
yeah,
my,
it might've been

591
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:15.450
so I go on the back,
you know,

592
00:35:15.451 --> 00:35:16.950
now they're going to try to get the money out of me.

593
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.710
Like every acting class does.
This is nothing against Scientology.

594
00:35:19.711 --> 00:35:22.170
So that's when I sat down and that's when the guy was just like,
you know,

595
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:27.330
we're very,
um,
self sufficient.
We have our own security,
we have our own parking.

596
00:35:27.331 --> 00:35:29.880
Everything was their own.
And that's when I said it said Jesus Christ,
you know,

597
00:35:29.881 --> 00:35:31.980
I had just had to break the tension.
It was so fucking weird.

598
00:35:31.981 --> 00:35:35.430
So I just made this joke,
you go,
Jesus Christ,
I feel like I'm joining a cult.

599
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:37.050
It was me and this other kid sitting.

600
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:39.030
I don't know what the Fuck I've happened to him.

601
00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:41.670
I don't know if he's clear yet or he fucking move back to Iowa.

602
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:44.400
I have no idea what.
But um,

603
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.350
the guy made like this weird face when I said it.
And um,

604
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.120
so I left and I was like,
wow,
that was fucking weird.
But it was still still like,

605
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:57.090
it was a good class though,
you know,
and uh,

606
00:35:57.091 --> 00:35:59.130
and I really liked acting class in that type of shit.

607
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:02.370
And so I was still kinda on the fence.

608
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

609
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:07.010
<v 2>And I ended up running into somebody,
uh,</v>

610
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.950
later on that night I think at the laugh factory.
And I mentioned,

611
00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.790
and the person who was like,
where were,
where was the class?
And I said,

612
00:36:13.791 --> 00:36:17.840
it was a Beverly hills play house.
And he just goes,
built that Scientology,

613
00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.740
you'll get the fuck out of here.
It's an active class.
They said,
no,
but it's,
yeah,

614
00:36:21.741 --> 00:36:23.720
they're trying to recruit you into that religion.

615
00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:29.420
So I've got all fucking weirded out.
And uh,

616
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.440
you know,

617
00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.860
they just kept calling and leaving messages on my fucking answer machine.

618
00:36:33.861 --> 00:36:34.641
And then that's,
you know,

619
00:36:34.641 --> 00:36:39.320
finally they called again and I've been ducking them for like three days and

620
00:36:39.321 --> 00:36:43.340
after three days I was just like,
no,
I thought they were watching me and shit.

621
00:36:43.341 --> 00:36:45.970
I got all fucking paranoid.
Not saying they were,
but I just get,
you know,

622
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.380
you know,
I mean,
I'm a fucking conspiracy theorists.

623
00:36:48.381 --> 00:36:52.160
Last thing I need is an actual cult fucking hounding me.

624
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.940
That was not good for my psyche.
So finally,
after three days,
they,

625
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:59.720
they called again and that's just,
I was like,
what am I am fucking bitch.

626
00:36:59.721 --> 00:37:01.880
I can't just call these people up and say,
go fuck yourself.

627
00:37:01.881 --> 00:37:05.610
So I just picked up the phone,
I'm like,
hello.
And they'll be like,
hey,

628
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:10.040
little Beverly hills play house.
I go,
yeah man,
I'm all set.
And the guy's like,
oh,

629
00:37:10.041 --> 00:37:14.780
did we lose you?
I was like,
yeah,
you did.
All right.
Don't call me anymore.

630
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.350
He goes,
okay,
fine.
And then that was it.
They left me alone.
But that was,

631
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:21.980
I think it was,
cause it was early on,
you know,
so,

632
00:37:21.981 --> 00:37:23.420
and I have to deal with Donald Sutherland.

633
00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.520
Like when I walked out to my car later on that night,

634
00:37:25.521 --> 00:37:30.200
just pointing at me like an invasion of the body snatchers.
Um,

635
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.400
you know,

636
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.970
not to say that Scientology is any more or less fucked up to my religion.

637
00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.980
You know,
I've always maintained that at the inquisition was filmed like my,

638
00:37:39.981 --> 00:37:43.610
um,
my religion wouldn't exist anymore.
That's what happened with the Nazis.

639
00:37:43.611 --> 00:37:46.460
They filmed this shit,
so no one's ever gonna Forget it.

640
00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:50.510
The shit that my religion did was never filmed.

641
00:37:50.511 --> 00:37:53.530
So it's just like stick figures and drawings and not,
not cares.

642
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.470
You know what I mean?
But to actually have the actual footage of like,
Oh yes,

643
00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.480
not only did it really happen,
this is what it looked like.
It's,

644
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:04.070
it's a fucking rap.
Um,
what am I talking about?
All right,

645
00:38:04.071 --> 00:38:05.960
let's get back till fucking the subjects here.

646
00:38:05.961 --> 00:38:10.250
I wanted to talk about instead of Scientology in,
in Holocaust footage,

647
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:15.260
um,
what,
what do we got here?
What did we get here?

648
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.680
Oh,
you know what?
I ain't even mention last,
I didn't even mention anything.

649
00:38:18.681 --> 00:38:23.681
Congratulate the fucking Cleveland Indians for sweeping the red sox and um,

650
00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:29.390
you know,
I'm wondering if I always pick on Dan Shaughnessy,
which,
you know,

651
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:34.400
to be fair isn't fair,
but for me to just single him out is,
is kind of funny.

652
00:38:34.401 --> 00:38:38.360
So I'm going to just trashing him.
The fucking,
I'm,

653
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:41.080
I wonder if it did,

654
00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:44.990
did Dan Shaughnessy or any of those other guys who demanded the Red Sox?

655
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Make a change after we had that fucking collapse in 2012 was it 2012 we had the

656
00:38:51.681 --> 00:38:55.770
collapse in September.
Well,
whatever the fuck,

657
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.130
I can't remember what the hell it was.
All I remember was,

658
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:04.260
however we got rid of Terry Francona was we had basically we,
you know,

659
00:39:04.261 --> 00:39:06.960
we didn't win the world series.
We didn't win the playoffs.

660
00:39:06.961 --> 00:39:11.340
So how many years in a row and then everybody demands of fucking change.

661
00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:15.150
Like this guy who won two world series with us,
oh by the way,

662
00:39:15.151 --> 00:39:19.860
we had one in 86 years suddenly does not know how to win a fucking championship

663
00:39:19.861 --> 00:39:21.630
anymore.
So we fucking,
you know,

664
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.350
the sports writers demand to trade the ownership fucking gives into it or

665
00:39:25.351 --> 00:39:28.020
whatever.
I mean,
I'm not saying they actually literally listen to these guys,

666
00:39:28.021 --> 00:39:32.040
but like I just would love these sports writers that demanded the red sox make a

667
00:39:32.041 --> 00:39:35.130
fucking move,
you know,
at least acknowledged the fact,
oh,

668
00:39:35.131 --> 00:39:38.660
there's Terry Francona all these years later coming back and sweep it.
Irs,

669
00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.250
you know,
the first round of the playoffs,
Theo Epstein,

670
00:39:44.251 --> 00:39:47.400
it's running the cubs right now.
I don't know.

671
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:50.820
These are all like former red sox.
They all knew what the fuck they were doing.

672
00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:56.640
Why did we get rid of all of these guys?
Theo Epstein is a fucking genius.

673
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.670
This guy's going to break the,
he already broke the curse of the baby.

674
00:39:59.671 --> 00:40:03.300
Help do that.
Now he's going to break the curse to go right.

675
00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:06.000
Automatic Hall of fame.
Jon lesters pitch and form.

676
00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:10.710
It's like this whole post season is just littered with former fucking red sox,

677
00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:14.220
which,
you know,
what do I care?
We want three.
Who gives a fuck?

678
00:40:14.221 --> 00:40:17.880
We went three this decade.
Am I actually gonna Complain about that?
Oh,

679
00:40:17.881 --> 00:40:21.300
I think I am.
No,
not really.
I don't give a fuck.

680
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.640
You know what it is?

681
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:29.540
I think it's safe to say I want to see a cubs Indians world series.

682
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:35.220
I mean,
I liked the Dodgers.
Um,
blue jays.
I don't mind,

683
00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.470
although Getty Lee one time talk shit about the bug reds,

684
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.830
the red sox and their fans.

685
00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:45.420
And ever since then I just hated Toronto Bluejay fans.
You know,
I blame him.

686
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:49.460
Getty,
Lee from rush,
the Bass player,
you know,
today,

687
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.830
he's Tom Sawyer's a mean mean.
Um,

688
00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:58.080
yeah.
So I would love to see that both of them,

689
00:40:58.081 --> 00:40:59.490
they're already doing like all this ever.

690
00:40:59.491 --> 00:41:04.491
You know what's fucking sucks about being in a drought like the cubs are in like

691
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.070
ESPN or all these guys to just have to fucking sit there and just splice

692
00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:14.071
together every fucking horrible thing that happened and they just try to make

693
00:41:14.101 --> 00:41:17.850
it,
you know,
I got so sick of that as a red sox fan.
So I have,

694
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:22.680
I have a lot of empathy for cubs fans because they don't do it to the Indians as

695
00:41:22.681 --> 00:41:23.760
much as the Indians tried it.

696
00:41:23.761 --> 00:41:27.870
Fans try to act like they're long suffering Indian fans.
It's like,
dude,

697
00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.140
you know,
it's 1948 you've suffered half his fucking law.

698
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:37.910
All right.
And then also nobody was eating,
and I even say it's about the cubs.

699
00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.770
Nobody chance in 1908.
Yeah.

700
00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.000
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

701
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.770
<v 2>You know,
the way they chanted 1918 at five.</v>

702
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:48.790
Was that a fucking devil rays game back when they were the devil race before

703
00:41:48.951 --> 00:41:53.010
those dopes thought that sounded too evil.
Fucking Clearwater cons.

704
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.403
<v 3>MMM.</v>

705
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.260
<v 2>They chanted in 1918 at us when I went,</v>

706
00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.540
I went to a game down at Tampa and they would chant.

707
00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.730
I was just looking at [inaudible] you fucking serious.
Yeah.

708
00:42:02.731 --> 00:42:04.230
We haven't won in [inaudible] 86 fucking years,

709
00:42:04.231 --> 00:42:05.580
but we still got five more than you.

710
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:07.743
<v 3>MMM.</v>

711
00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.790
<v 2>They chanted that at,
at us.</v>

712
00:42:09.791 --> 00:42:14.170
I went to an inner league game if the old veterans stadium in Philadelphia,

713
00:42:14.171 --> 00:42:17.350
and I'm like,
like these guys went over a hundred years.

714
00:42:17.351 --> 00:42:21.950
They went from like 1880 something almost a hundred years to 1980 but they'd won

715
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.660
one in 1980 so that the guy gave him the fucking right to champ.
That shit at us.

716
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.620
Um,
I dunno when it comes to,

717
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:31.210
and you always go on that during the day you're taking your shirts off.

718
00:42:31.211 --> 00:42:34.780
It just looks like a big keg party and it almost looks like you don't even give

719
00:42:34.781 --> 00:42:39.700
a fuck.
You know what?
Fuck it.
Let's see the Dodgers and blue jays.
No,

720
00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:45.190
I don't give a shit.
I'm just a,
I absolutely love a playoff baseball.
Um,

721
00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.810
I dunno what happens to second,

722
00:42:46.811 --> 00:42:51.670
it becomes October and they throw all those extra microphones and you can just

723
00:42:51.671 --> 00:42:56.170
hear the ball hitting the mic.
It just takes this whole other level of like,
uh,

724
00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:00.610
like the,
the whole mystique of the national pastime just fucking comes to life.

725
00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:03.670
Like I don't for the fucking light from me if they wanted to increase their

726
00:43:03.671 --> 00:43:04.420
ratings,

727
00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:08.920
so keep whatever those playoff microphones are where you can just fucking hear

728
00:43:08.921 --> 00:43:11.620
everything.
You can really hear the sound of the crowd and all of that.

729
00:43:11.621 --> 00:43:16.000
If he just would,
well,
maybe we'd get spoiled.
I don't fucking know.

730
00:43:16.001 --> 00:43:18.620
All I know is it sounds completely different and um,

731
00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.980
that adds to the whole thing.

732
00:43:20.981 --> 00:43:25.570
And I've missed every second every fucking pitch because I've been working.

733
00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:30.760
But,
um,
I take my special on Friday and then after that,
um,

734
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:35.850
I'm going to be a,
I'm going to be just,

735
00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:40.530
I'm going to watch every fucking pitch.
Oh,
I can't wait.
I can't fucking wait.
Oh,

736
00:43:40.531 --> 00:43:44.160
I'm putting my feet,
I'll put my feet up,
but I'm going to keep working out.
Um,

737
00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.020
cause I'm down to basically my,

738
00:43:46.021 --> 00:43:48.660
I'm a few pounds so I'm going to be a few pounds over but I'll be fine for the

739
00:43:48.661 --> 00:43:49.660
special and uh,

740
00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.650
but I'm going to keep going and get myself into fucking ridiculous shape like it

741
00:43:52.651 --> 00:43:55.260
was last year.
And uh,

742
00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.430
the next thing I'm adding to my gym has,
are those fucking Swedish blahs.

743
00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.970
So,
uh,
that's my goal.
By the time I'm 50,
I want to be able to do the human flag.

744
00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.550
I'm already working on a front lever,
which is really fucking hard man.

745
00:44:14.551 --> 00:44:17.640
Just cause it's just muscles you don't use.
You know,

746
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:20.670
you ever see somebody do a pull up and then they just go straight out and they

747
00:44:20.671 --> 00:44:21.550
look like they're just there.

748
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:24.930
Like parallel with the ground is they hold onto the,
to a pull up bar.

749
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.353
<v 3>MMM.</v>

750
00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:29.470
<v 2>I've been gradually building up the strength to do that.</v>

751
00:44:29.471 --> 00:44:33.990
I can now hang from the bar with my leg,
might knees tucked up into my chest.

752
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:35.730
It's all about balance and you have to put,

753
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:39.370
you actually have to be like pretty much behind the bar.
So like the weight,

754
00:44:39.371 --> 00:44:43.680
especially with me with my big head has to be on one side and then gradually you

755
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:47.430
start to extend one leg a little bit until you can,

756
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:51.450
you can hold the whole fucking thing.
And uh,
I dunno,

757
00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:55.500
whatever I have to be working towards shit like that or like workouts just

758
00:44:55.501 --> 00:44:58.500
become,
it's like me trying to write down my jokes.

759
00:44:58.501 --> 00:45:01.710
It just becomes like this unbelievably tedious thing.
All right.
And with that,

760
00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:06.120
let's fucking,
uh,
is there anything else I wanted to say?
Tennessee,
Alabama,

761
00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:07.740
poor Tennessee.
Jesus Christ,

762
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:11.460
they will fucking roll in there and they just ran into a couple of tough

763
00:45:11.461 --> 00:45:14.100
opponents.
Dude,
Alabama looks like fucking world beaters.

764
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:15.463
<v 3>MMM.</v>

765
00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:20.620
<v 2>Wisconsin.
Ohio state was an amazing game.
I watched that one.
Felt baffle.</v>

766
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:24.440
Wisconsin man,
they had that fucking game.
Um,

767
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:30.050
and then Dak Prescott of the,
uh,
Dallas cowboys.
Jesus Christ,

768
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:35.180
the guy looks like a five year vet.
Um,
but anyways,

769
00:45:35.181 --> 00:45:35.901
I got to tell you this man,

770
00:45:35.901 --> 00:45:39.080
I've been gone almost a week without losing my shit and it feels pretty good.

771
00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:42.710
Like I got to a,
I dunno,

772
00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.300
I got to keep doing this type of stuff cause I don't want to be a,

773
00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.160
I don't want to be a radio my whole fucking life and I don't know you guys.
Ooh,

774
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.560
it's going to affect your comedy.
Notice it.
Believe me,

775
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:54.400
I get plenty of left in the reserve tank for and I get on stage.
All right,

776
00:45:54.401 --> 00:45:58.090
let's read some of your questions here for this week.
All right.
All right,

777
00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.570
well here's a note from a Andrew.
Uh,

778
00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:04.390
bill got tons of emails from people who watched and loved last week Simpsons

779
00:46:04.391 --> 00:46:09.100
episode as well as this guy who suggest you check it out.
Oh,

780
00:46:09.101 --> 00:46:11.110
this guy didn't know I was in the episode.
Says,
hey bill,

781
00:46:11.111 --> 00:46:15.220
next time you try and to get your ginger ass in shape for 20 minutes,

782
00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:20.640
turn on the newest Simpsons episode and watch it during between your legs during

783
00:46:20.831 --> 00:46:21.664
polities.

784
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:25.270
There are patriots and Boston references and I think you'd really like it.

785
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:30.250
I hope to hear you laugh about it in the podcast,
not on the podcast.
Ah,

786
00:46:30.251 --> 00:46:32.890
yes sir.
I was actually always in that episode.

787
00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:37.870
I was the guy who said we want 12 division titles in the last 10 years.

788
00:46:37.871 --> 00:46:41.260
Fair and square.
I was the guy in the,
uh,

789
00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.150
<v 3>in the tunnel and uh,</v>

790
00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.270
<v 2>I think I did one of the new,
so I did one other one.
I didn't record.</v>

791
00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:54.250
I think I was in the other room by that.
Um,
alright.
Westworld.

792
00:46:54.251 --> 00:46:57.400
Not Saying I didn't watch and love the episode,
but I have like fucking add.

793
00:46:57.401 --> 00:47:02.160
I can only sit there for so goddamn long.
Um,
I'm scatterbrained.
Alright.

794
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:06.880
Westworld.
Hey Billy bought,
I'm fascinated with artificial intelligence.

795
00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:11.320
You mentioned Westworld and a 60 minutes piece last week and I wanted to share

796
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:14.080
with you this perspective on Ai.

797
00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:18.880
Westworld is the most compelling aspect of Ai is advancement.

798
00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.213
<v 3>MMM.</v>

799
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:27.170
<v 2>Westworld is the most,
I think you meant to go Westworld.
He goes,</v>

800
00:47:27.171 --> 00:47:32.140
the most compelling aspect of Ai's is that when it does in fact surpass the

801
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:37.141
human brain in all aspects and be can and begins to consider self preservation,

802
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:42.940
it will happen almost completely overnight as far as the public is concerned.

803
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:47.620
I suggest you watch this short ted talk by Sam Harris.
I actually watched that.

804
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:49.540
Uh,
we will put up the link.

805
00:47:49.541 --> 00:47:54.250
He also talks about the political implications on the world's stage I II would

806
00:47:54.251 --> 00:47:58.450
China launch an attack if they thought we were dangerously close to losing

807
00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:03.050
control of our technology?
It seems as if,

808
00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:07.720
see this is why,
you know,
I already can't read this guy writes a sentence.

809
00:48:07.721 --> 00:48:12.721
It seems as if though you would need all world leaders as if though,

810
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:17.050
is that because that grammatically correct.
Oh,

811
00:48:17.051 --> 00:48:20.100
it seems as if comma,
which isn't there though,

812
00:48:20.101 --> 00:48:23.740
you would need all world leaders and tech leaders to focus their efforts on

813
00:48:23.741 --> 00:48:28.120
controlling the AI instead of advancing it further.
Period.

814
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:31.860
I don't know how to read that sentence.
Uh,
this seems unlikely.

815
00:48:31.861 --> 00:48:36.390
It'd be like jerking off to just the point before completion for the rest of

816
00:48:36.391 --> 00:48:38.640
attorney.
Good luck out there.

817
00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:45.270
Oh yeah.
All the world leaders would,
yeah.
It would want to try to control it.

818
00:48:45.271 --> 00:48:47.190
Yeah.
No.
Yeah.
It's not going to happen.

819
00:48:47.191 --> 00:48:52.191
I don't understand why we're doing it and I don't understand why there has to be

820
00:48:52.321 --> 00:48:55.740
these constant technological improvements.

821
00:48:55.770 --> 00:49:00.000
It's just all based on money.
I mean,
what if it just stopped right here?

822
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:02.190
Like how fucking great is your life right now?

823
00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:03.840
If you're in a first world country,

824
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:08.010
you're not the person putting together these devices that makes our lives so

825
00:49:08.011 --> 00:49:11.550
great and in a third world country,
um,
it's,
it's,
it's fine.

826
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:16.290
We should have just fucking would you sit down at the blackjack table rather

827
00:49:16.291 --> 00:49:19.320
than just taking a winnings and just going back to our room would just fucking

828
00:49:19.321 --> 00:49:22.320
sitting here and eventually we're going to work.
It's going to crap out.

829
00:49:22.321 --> 00:49:24.810
We're gonna,
we're gonna,
we're gonna lose it all.

830
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:28.170
I absolutely believe that 100 fucking percent.
Um,

831
00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:31.440
and I think it is just so fucked up,

832
00:49:31.441 --> 00:49:35.760
weird and bizarre that even if you're not a conspiracy theorist,

833
00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:39.250
what is the fucking purpose of making robots okay?

834
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.340
To this goddamn level?
You know what I mean?

835
00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.190
It's just a bunch of fucking Weirdos at the top.

836
00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:49.060
I'm telling you they want to phase out the rest of us and they just want a bunch

837
00:49:49.061 --> 00:49:52.960
of zombies that we'll do whatever the fuck they want him to do and that they can

838
00:49:52.961 --> 00:49:55.990
fucking do whatever the hell they want to them.
Uh,

839
00:49:55.991 --> 00:49:59.050
and then eventually they'll just take them over and they'll fucking kill him.

840
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:04.350
Or is that like one of the many,
many movies that I've watched about it?
Uh,

841
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:08.710
anyways,
I,
you know,
I'm a paranoid psycho,
but I think in this instance,

842
00:50:08.711 --> 00:50:13.030
I think it's good to be paranoid.
All right.
Roommates psycho.
Hey there,

843
00:50:13.031 --> 00:50:16.600
you're freckly bastard.
I've been living with the guy for about six months.

844
00:50:16.601 --> 00:50:18.250
We've known each other for about a year.

845
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:21.010
Everything has been good between us with no issues,

846
00:50:21.011 --> 00:50:24.070
which is weird cause I never have a good experience with roommates.
Well,

847
00:50:24.071 --> 00:50:27.470
if you never have a good experience,
you've got to start looking at yourself,
uh,

848
00:50:27.471 --> 00:50:31.850
either who you're picking or,
um,
maybe you're the asshole,
you know,

849
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.850
maybe you're a cunt.
All right.
Anyways,
over the weekend,

850
00:50:34.851 --> 00:50:39.080
I went out of town to visit family and while I was away,
he got drunk,

851
00:50:39.081 --> 00:50:40.070
went into my room,

852
00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:44.120
tore up a body pillow on my bed.

853
00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.240
When I got back,
he had a guilty look on his face,

854
00:50:47.241 --> 00:50:50.450
told me that what happened and then apologize.
Needless to say,

855
00:50:50.451 --> 00:50:55.451
it was fucking awkward and all I could say was that strange behavior and tried

856
00:50:56.391 --> 00:51:01.280
to break the awkwardness by kind of jokingly asking him not to kill me.

857
00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:06.170
Nothing else has been said since regarding the issue.
Uh,

858
00:51:06.171 --> 00:51:07.220
what do you think I should do?

859
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:10.400
I want to talk to a psychiatrist to see what he thinks,

860
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.340
but I figure you are the next best option.
In other words,

861
00:51:13.341 --> 00:51:17.270
you're too cheap to get a professional opinion.
You're going to ask me,
uh,

862
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:21.940
first things first,
I get a lock on my bedroom door.
Um,

863
00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:26.770
dude,
if you're literally concerned for your safety,
I would fucking move out.

864
00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:31.810
That's what I would do.
I would basically,

865
00:51:31.811 --> 00:51:36.010
I would get another fucking place without telling this fucking person.

866
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:39.340
I would move 80% of my shit over there.

867
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:44.860
I would then fucking tell him in the presence of one of my friends that I was

868
00:51:44.861 --> 00:51:48.340
leaving and uh,
you know,
and I would just,
you know,

869
00:51:48.341 --> 00:51:50.890
pay for the last half of the month that I would get the fuck out of that dude.

870
00:51:50.891 --> 00:51:51.630
If you're,
honestly,

871
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:53.950
if you're going to go see a psychiatrist and you're worried that this guy is

872
00:51:53.951 --> 00:51:56.680
going to do some sort of bodily harm,
two,
I would get the fuck out of there.

873
00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.290
I don't care how nice an apartment it is.
I don't give a shit.

874
00:51:59.291 --> 00:52:00.730
If your name's on the fucking lease,

875
00:52:00.731 --> 00:52:04.630
I would just leave the fact that he got drunk and went into your room.

876
00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:05.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

877
00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:10.690
<v 2>And like violently attacked a body pillow.
I mean,</v>

878
00:52:10.691 --> 00:52:13.360
and you're sitting there going like,
did what?
When he was,

879
00:52:13.361 --> 00:52:14.470
he's so drunk that he went in there,

880
00:52:14.471 --> 00:52:17.350
he saw that giant lump and he thought it was me under the pillows and that could

881
00:52:17.351 --> 00:52:22.000
have been,
yeah,
fuck that guy.
And why do you have to feel awkward around him?

882
00:52:22.001 --> 00:52:26.380
Why do you have to break the tension?
Yeah,
you should have been like,
dude,
that's,

883
00:52:26.381 --> 00:52:29.410
that's completely psychotic behavior.
I need you to fucking move out.

884
00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:35.080
You say that after you get rid of all the knives?
Um,
yeah.

885
00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:38.710
I would just,
yeah,
move on the fuck out of there.
All right.

886
00:52:38.711 --> 00:52:41.410
Russia readies for war,
war,
war.
Hey Bill,

887
00:52:41.411 --> 00:52:45.730
did you hear Russia called all its foreign dignitaries back to the homeland?
Uh,

888
00:52:45.731 --> 00:52:50.280
this isn't uncommon before an attack,
but also probably just a scare tactic.
A,

889
00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:53.740
if one day someone came on the news and said Russia threatened to bomb the west

890
00:52:53.741 --> 00:52:58.360
coast,
what would your state of mind be?
A I would be completely chill.
Uh,

891
00:52:58.361 --> 00:53:00.190
would you be like,
Nah,
I never going to happen.

892
00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.850
Or would you get in your new green car and hit the road with the lovely Nia and

893
00:53:03.851 --> 00:53:08.110
Cleo in tow?
Um,
no,
no.

894
00:53:08.111 --> 00:53:12.380
If Russia at taxes,
I want to be the first person to get killed.
Yeah.

895
00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:13.510
I don't want to live through that.

896
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:18.670
I have no desire to live through a fucking world war.
You know what I mean?

897
00:53:18.671 --> 00:53:21.700
It's one thing to actually be in the army.
You know what I mean?

898
00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.940
And you've got a group of pals and shit,
but if you're going to be like the,

899
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:26.303
you know,

900
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:31.940
just the old farmer in the town wondering which armies coming up the road next,

901
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:35.730
I don't eat that Shit,
you know?
Yeah.

902
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.750
It's like that fucking the fat fuck there in North Korea when you said he was

903
00:53:39.751 --> 00:53:41.880
going to shoot a missile at Los Angeles,
it's like,
great.

904
00:53:41.881 --> 00:53:44.970
I hope you shoot it right at my house.
Um,

905
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.860
I like the way the world is right now and what,
whatever.

906
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.420
I was gonna use the word cataclysmic,

907
00:53:51.421 --> 00:53:52.800
but I was worried that I wouldn't say it right.

908
00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.900
Whatever fucking major thing happens.

909
00:53:54.901 --> 00:53:58.500
Like I don't want her to survive and I want to be the first person to go and

910
00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:01.820
like a,
you know?
Yeah.

911
00:54:01.821 --> 00:54:06.620
Just be sitting there with my fucking little downloaded music,
listening to it,

912
00:54:06.621 --> 00:54:11.060
and then it's over.
And then when like all the rest of the shit happens.
Yeah.

913
00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:15.860
I don't want to fucking live through it.
Start all over again.
You know,

914
00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:22.150
fucking people getting polio again in the mumps.
Alright.
Cleo,
eating grass.

915
00:54:22.151 --> 00:54:26.140
Ello bill.
I owned a dog for 12 years,
passed away in 2014.
Sorry to hear that.

916
00:54:26.141 --> 00:54:27.820
Sometimes when we were out walking,

917
00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:31.450
it would dive into the bushes and chew on grass.
So my observations,

918
00:54:31.451 --> 00:54:35.140
it usually exhibited this behavior.
If it's de-worming shots,

919
00:54:35.141 --> 00:54:39.420
we're long overdue for month intervals.
Deworming removes the,
uh,

920
00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:43.690
irritating floor that has accumulated in the gut as a result of eating

921
00:54:43.691 --> 00:54:47.440
contaminated food or other nasty stuff your dog may have licked off the floor

922
00:54:47.441 --> 00:54:51.760
while you're not around a dog that is due for deworming,
has poor appetite,

923
00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:56.500
may vomit food,
and sometimes lays laid down awkwardly due to intestinal cramps.

924
00:54:56.501 --> 00:55:00.130
My dog is show none of those symptoms.
My theory at the time was,

925
00:55:00.131 --> 00:55:03.220
since dogs are not herbivores,

926
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:06.170
herbivores,
I don't know,

927
00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:11.250
ingesting grass was nature's way of getting fibrous roughage into the gut,

928
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:14.720
like a broom to sweep out the irritating gut.

929
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:17.120
The end result was that after eating grass,

930
00:55:17.121 --> 00:55:21.980
my dog would later throw up a chunk of undigested food or take a huge dump and

931
00:55:21.981 --> 00:55:24.710
he would be fine for many weeks after that purge.
Yeah,

932
00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:27.320
but my dog eats grass all the fucking time.

933
00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:29.360
I hope my explanation was clear enough.

934
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:33.560
It may not have been proven scientifically or maybe it has.
You could look it up.

935
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:35.870
You could look up dog d warming,

936
00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:39.500
but I figured since you've complained about it in more than one podcast and

937
00:55:39.501 --> 00:55:41.300
they'll listeners have written to you about it yet,

938
00:55:41.301 --> 00:55:45.980
I could relate my own experiences with,
with that behavior in a dog.

939
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:46.581
Nevertheless,

940
00:55:46.581 --> 00:55:50.300
the best solution would be stick to the dog's deworming shuts routine.

941
00:55:50.301 --> 00:55:54.590
I think we do that.
Congratulations on your new Jag.
Thanks for the plug yet.
Um,

942
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:57.830
yeah,
I always thought it was like some sort of,

943
00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:02.420
I thought they ate grass when they were sick.
Um,

944
00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:06.950
but then she was just kind of doing it all the time.
Um,

945
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:10.700
who knows.
I mean,
who knows what the fuck they put in dog food,
so yeah.

946
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:15.650
But we always have our up to date on all their stuff.
Um,
all right.
Road rage,

947
00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:20.750
dare billion.
I have a solution to your road rage.
Oh,
okay.

948
00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:21.530
I'm all ears.

949
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:25.360
It's a tactic I used to keep cool when I'm behind the wheel behind the wheel.

950
00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:28.960
Bear in mind.
This tactic only works if the windows are rolled up.

951
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:32.590
Whenever you feel the urge to curse.
So yell,
just pretend to do so.

952
00:56:32.591 --> 00:56:36.100
Malvin curse words and whatever else you want to say.
All right,

953
00:56:36.101 --> 00:56:38.410
I'm already out too.
That's just fucking weird.

954
00:56:38.411 --> 00:56:42.460
I'm not doing that and that mouthing.
Fuck you.
You fucking cunt.

955
00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:46.840
Shake your fists in the air and pretend to slam the steering wheel.

956
00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:50.110
Don't damage that Corinthian leather there.
That's hilarious.

957
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:52.480
Whoever upset you by cutting you off,

958
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:56.800
we'll see you losing your shit and fear for their safety.
But the joke's on them.

959
00:56:56.801 --> 00:56:59.980
You're just faking it.
You may look like a maniac,

960
00:56:59.981 --> 00:57:03.580
but it's also a lot of fun I guess cause it's so silly.

961
00:57:03.581 --> 00:57:07.900
It takes so much energy and concentration to just pretend to freak out that you

962
00:57:07.901 --> 00:57:11.320
quickly cooled down and possibly forget what you got mad about in the first

963
00:57:11.321 --> 00:57:14.200
place.
I hope this tip helps and congrats on the new car.

964
00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:16.870
There's a lot to be said for strength from the pack,

965
00:57:16.871 --> 00:57:20.620
especially when it comes to European sports sedans.
Best regards.
Um,

966
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.840
yeah.
You know what I do when somebody cuts me off now in public,
I just go la,

967
00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:28.480
you know,
nice move.
You know,
I would've done that.
I try to just,

968
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:31.740
I try to find the fucking humor.
Um,

969
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:37.360
I was at,
what I was actually thinking of doing was um,

970
00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:39.780
<v 6>okay</v>

971
00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:41.970
<v 0>having a post it or something,</v>

972
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:45.330
a checklist in my car before I got in the car.

973
00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:46.290
<v 6>Okay.</v>

974
00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:49.950
<v 0>And,
um,
even if it's as simple as just drawing a smiley face,</v>

975
00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:54.330
you know,
don't let the consult when underneath it and just,

976
00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:57.003
<v 6>I dunno,
just</v>

977
00:57:57.370 --> 00:57:58.990
<v 0>gradually driving down the road.</v>

978
00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:02.620
The big thing is for me is if I'm late,

979
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:06.580
because I flip out even when I'm not late,
but if I'm fucking weight,

980
00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:11.500
which is my fault,
I start driving like an asshole.
I'm flipping the fuck out.

981
00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:15.120
<v 6>And um,
but</v>

982
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:17.210
<v 0>I'm really going to,</v>

983
00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:18.163
<v 6>uh,</v>

984
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.870
<v 0>work on it and I've been great for like the last seven days,</v>

985
00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:24.960
but like an asshole I owe you always hear me on the podcast.
So I go,

986
00:58:24.961 --> 00:58:26.550
did you notice?
Did you notice Nia?

987
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.490
I'm still like a little fucking kid where I need like the attention.

988
00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:34.170
And the fucking approval.
So I'm not doing that anymore.

989
00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:38.700
Uh,
I'm not gonna do it for her fucking approval.
I have to do this,

990
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.833
<v 6>you know,</v>

991
00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:43.700
<v 0>because it's the right fucking thing to do.</v>

992
00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:46.850
Rather than trying to get praised for my fucking wife over the whole,

993
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:49.560
all over the bullshit.
But I am,
I've decided I'm going to,

994
00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:54.500
I'm going to beat this thing because I think I can because I never,

995
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:58.780
um,
I dunno.
I never,

996
00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:03.530
I never tried
so work on it really.

997
00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:06.260
You know what I mean?
Like I,
uh,

998
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:09.800
I worked on getting better as a comedian that happened.

999
00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:12.020
I worked on better getting drums that happen.

1000
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:14.660
I worked on getting a pilot's license that happen.

1001
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:18.460
I never worked on my fucking temper.
I just viewed it as like,
well,

1002
00:59:18.461 --> 00:59:22.640
that's how I'm wired.
I don't know the fuck you want me to do all that shit.
So,

1003
00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:27.890
um,
I would like to be,
you know,

1004
00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:33.580
I'm just,
I'm just,
I don't,
I'm done being that guy.
I'm trying,

1005
00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:37.210
I can hear all you guys laughing.
Like there's no fucking,
this is like,

1006
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:41.050
it's just not going to happen.
Like,
sometimes I feel like I can beat my temper.

1007
00:59:41.051 --> 00:59:44.800
And then other times I feel like I'm,
I'm deciding that I'm going to,
like,

1008
00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:47.350
I can't dunk a basketball and it's like,
well,

1009
00:59:47.351 --> 00:59:49.930
I've decided that I'm going to learn how to dunk a basketball.

1010
00:59:49.931 --> 00:59:52.150
It's just one of the things like,
dude,
if you have,
if you can't jump,

1011
00:59:52.151 --> 00:59:56.110
you can't fucking jump.
Um,
sometimes it feels like that.

1012
00:59:56.111 --> 00:59:57.460
Like literally I'm trying to like,

1013
00:59:57.490 --> 01:00:00.300
I'm going to learn how to sing to your tone deaf.
You can't fucking sing.

1014
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:04.330
You know,
there's just certain things you just weren't born with that gift.

1015
01:00:04.331 --> 01:00:07.120
And sometimes I feel like my temporary is like that,
but hopefully,
uh,

1016
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:08.950
hopefully that isn't the case.
All right,

1017
01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.490
let me read the last couple of advertisements here.
A legal zoom,

1018
01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:16.810
attention to detail is key.
When you run a business,
oh,

1019
01:00:16.811 --> 01:00:19.120
you mean you can't just wing it there?
Um,

1020
01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:23.980
you can't afford to take your eye off the price even for a moment are either one

1021
01:00:23.981 --> 01:00:28.300
of those sentences necessary.
Attention to detail is key.
When you run a business,

1022
01:00:28.301 --> 01:00:32.470
really you can't afford to take your eye off the price even for a moment.

1023
01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:36.160
So don't let things like legal questions become a distraction.

1024
01:00:36.161 --> 01:00:37.780
Use Legal Zoom instead.

1043
01:01:35.681 --> 01:01:40.180
zoom.com.
Always today's date by the way.

1044
01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:44.020
October 17th.
Okay,
we're getting close.
Um,

1045
01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:48.430
I was just thinking I preordered the new pretenders album.

1046
01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.260
I think it's coming up soon.
You know,

1047
01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:56.450
if none of you guys got a Chrissie Hines last solo album,
Stockholm,

1048
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.710
highly recommend that I actually listened to the pretenders album.

1049
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.990
What I have to fucking work out.
You know,

1050
01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.460
some of their early 80 stuff.
And I know you're thinking like,
Bill,

1051
01:02:07.461 --> 01:02:10.190
don't you listen to like your fucking guns and roses 80 shit.

1052
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.960
Sometimes it's just so fucking early and I'm so old.
Like I need to fucking,

1053
01:02:14.961 --> 01:02:18.740
I need something a little more like just mellow,
you know,

1054
01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:24.540
it just to try to fucking ease my way into it.
And I've found that,

1055
01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:29.350
you know,
those albums have been great for me.
So anyways,

1056
01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:34.360
so stamps.com continuing on some small businesses still have still think an

1057
01:02:34.591 --> 01:02:35.700
expensive postage.

1058
01:02:35.701 --> 01:02:40.440
Meda is the only way to get postage without having to go to the post office,

1059
01:02:40.441 --> 01:02:44.820
but they're wrong.
Wrong,
Donald Trump wrong.

1060
01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:45.960
Uh,

1061
01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.580
their stamps.com with stamps.com you can easily print postage for any letter or

1062
01:02:50.581 --> 01:02:54.240
package using your,
uh,
your computer and printer.
Uh,

1063
01:02:54.241 --> 01:02:57.750
no extra hardware to buy no longterm contracts.

1064
01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:03.170
A stamps.com could save you at least 50% compared to a Meta plus.

1065
01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:07.590
You could do more with stamps.com you can take a meter,
Niki,

1066
01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:12.000
then you can with a meter like send a package like sand package tracking

1067
01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:16.020
information to
what the fuck's going on with me here.

1068
01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:20.370
Like Sen package tracking information to recipients with one click.

1069
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:25.050
The choice is clear.
stamps.com offers more features at a fraction of the cost.

1070
01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.520
I had been using stamp gumps stamps.com for years from my shows.

1071
01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:34.020
It makes mailing and shipping my uh,
posters.
Really convenient right now.

1072
01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:38.130
Sign up for stamps.com and use my last name [inaudible] to get a four week trial

1073
01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:43.020
plus a $110 bonus offer,
including postage and a digital scale.
Don't wait.

1074
01:03:43.021 --> 01:03:45.150
Go to stamps.com before you do anything else,

1075
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:50.180
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage.
It type it burr.
Alright,

1076
01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:55.110
there we go.
I think that is the podcast here for this week.

1077
01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:56.003
Um,

1078
01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.230
scrolling now through my home iTunes.

1079
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:07.680
I don't understand.
You know what?
I can't play any of my fucking music.

1080
01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:12.420
It says too many devices have already been cleared to,
uh,

1081
01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.793
<v 6>you know,</v>

1082
01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:21.480
<v 0>to listen to iTunes.
So it doesn't let me listen to it anymore.
I can't,
you know,</v>

1083
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:26.070
and I don't remember the passwords.
Have anything else on any other device?

1084
01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:29.370
I don't know what other devices they're saying.
Does it mean you know,

1085
01:04:29.371 --> 01:04:33.480
my old laptops that are dead?
I got to turn it back on,
find the cord,

1086
01:04:33.481 --> 01:04:34.320
plug them in and,

1087
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:38.460
<v 6>and do what
you know</v>

1088
01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:45.690
<v 0>on and let them listen to fuck and iTunes or does it mean there's too many</v>

1089
01:04:46.261 --> 01:04:48.940
devices in the house?
I have no fucking idea as far as I know,

1090
01:04:48.941 --> 01:04:52.020
it was just my laptop and my phone.
How can that be too many,
too many devices,

1091
01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:57.120
whatever are,
here's the owl alone.
It hasn't come out yet.
The pretenders alone.

1092
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:59.820
Um,
I know it's coming out in like a week or so,

1093
01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:03.240
but lately when I've been like lifting,

1094
01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.073
<v 6>mmm.</v>

1095
01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.120
<v 0>I've been listening to like the whole learning to crawl album,</v>

1096
01:05:09.121 --> 01:05:12.240
it's actually fucking great for working out.
Who would have thought?

1097
01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:14.250
I always thought you had to have this really aggressive shit.

1098
01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:17.530
<v 6>Um,
I dunno.</v>

1099
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.860
<v 0>I don't know.
I'm all over the fucking place and I can't figure it out.
You know,</v>

1100
01:05:20.861 --> 01:05:25.370
I got kicked off of my own fucking Facebook.
Somebody sent me something.

1101
01:05:25.371 --> 01:05:27.660
So these fucking pictures,
I don't know if I got phished or whatever.

1102
01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:31.310
Now I can't get into my,
I can't get into my,
uh,
my own account.
And he said,

1103
01:05:31.311 --> 01:05:35.680
the only way I can turn my account back on is if I send them a picture of
myself.

1104
01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:38.450
And I'm just thinking like,
well,
how the fuck do you know what I look like?

1105
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:41.720
So I'm officially done with Facebook.

1106
01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:43.843
<v 6>You know?</v>

1107
01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.500
<v 0>Let's see.
Okay.
You don't want,
let me see if I can go on to Facebook right now,</v>

1108
01:05:47.501 --> 01:05:52.030
so let's see if my computer will let me my phone.
Whoa.
This is just extra time.

1109
01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:55.510
People.
This isn't even the podcast anymore.
This is you.
Just you.
Yeah.
See,

1110
01:05:55.511 --> 01:05:56.344
I'm done.

1111
01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:02.990
Email or phone.
I don't even recognize.

1112
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.820
I fucking hate this shit.
Now what?
I got you.

1113
01:06:06.821 --> 01:06:09.550
I got to spend like another 20 hours trying to figure this out.

1114
01:06:09.551 --> 01:06:12.220
It's not even worth it to me.
Well,

1115
01:06:12.221 --> 01:06:14.530
why do I care if someone fished my fucking account anyways?

1116
01:06:14.531 --> 01:06:19.180
What are they going to do with it?
You know what I mean?
You got my,

1117
01:06:19.181 --> 01:06:20.560
you have my Facebook account.

1118
01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.810
