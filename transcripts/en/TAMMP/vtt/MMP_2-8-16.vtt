00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.300
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:05.910
It's time for the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.730
February 8th,
2016 what's going on everybody?

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.470
Huh?
All my darling.
Oh Mama Darlin Darlin,

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.870
Denver,
Colorado.
Bunchy head please.

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.630
And some miners and the one so both trophy.

7
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.120
Um,
congratulations to everybody in rocky,

8
00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:34.121
Matt and hat kind of Ratto Keenan fuck and cows and Stinky Greeley,

9
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.140
Greeley,
Colorado.
Man.
If you ever want to know,

10
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.740
you know what a bunch of murdered cows smell like for the next time you eat a

11
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:44.220
burger,

12
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.220
I suggest you go there on a bad smell day as where they call it bad smell date.

13
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:53.050
And then you call up the slaughterhouse.
He like,
Hey,
could you fucking,
uh,

14
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.220
could you fucking tone it down a little?
You know,

15
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.930
the wind's blowing down to my house.

16
00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:01.700
Why don't you lay off killing those fucking cows?
You know,
not saying,

17
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:04.750
I know luck.
Bert,
Bert,

18
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.730
I'm here in San Francisco and all of those limousine liberals out in Hollywood,

19
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.350
um,
out there eating them fucking Tofu patties.
You know,

20
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:19.920
that shit causes cancer,
don't you?
The fuck is a Tofu.

21
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.390
I'm sorry.
Congratulations to the Denver Broncos.
And guess what?

22
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:28.050
All Billy bread face.
He wanted a little bit of money but none of the old,

23
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.290
the old man yo man Mu River.
I'm

24
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.640
sorry.
I'm very happy for a Peyton manning man.

25
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.481
I though I just,

26
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:42.590
I didn't want to see him go in there and get his fucking ass kicked and I won't,

27
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:45.120
I know what you guys are thinking.
Hey Bill,
why did you bet on the Broncos?

28
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.660
You didn't say shit predicting one way or the other?
Um,

29
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.230
I didn't have,
I didn't have any feeling one way or the other on the uh,

30
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.220
on the game.
I thought what a lot of people thought.

31
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.130
I just thought the fucking panthers were going to,

32
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.400
if they got up early it was going to get ugly and uh,

33
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.810
I dunno,
but then just everybody was saying it,
everybody kept fucking saying it.

34
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:13.830
You know,
do the pant is going to be a fucking game.
Right?

35
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:18.600
Everyone was just saying that the panthers were going to fucking destroy.

36
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.490
They went,
went by 17 two,

37
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:22.710
it's going to be 17 not to buy any of the first quarter.

38
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.180
This is what all my friends was saying.

39
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.810
So I came up with this quick theory because I wanted to put money on the game,

40
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:33.960
you know,
cause my team wasn't in it and I wasn't really excited about it.

41
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.340
So I figured I,
well,
if everybody's saying the panthers though,
right?

42
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.220
How does Vegas make any money?

43
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.480
The only way Vegas makes monies is if the Broncos win.

44
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.610
Vegas always has the lights on.
Even during the day,
they never shut them off.

45
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.190
They got the AC on what the fucking doors open.

46
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.230
And I don't see anybody concerned out there,
right,
is they're making money.

47
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:01.240
So I said,
fuck it.
I'm going to go against the grain.

48
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.280
I didn't even take the points.
I just bet it.

49
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.870
I bet the line 100 and make one 90 through 100 bucks on it.
And

50
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.570
they,
Jesus Christ,
I guess that Denver Broncos' defense was,

51
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.230
was as good as they were saying.
I just thought like,

52
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.080
I thought we made them look better than they work as our offensive line was

53
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:22.410
fucking beat up.
But,
um,

54
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.100
I don't know if you noticed the entire time when the Broncos beat the Patriots,

55
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.830
at no point was Tom Brady comfortable.
He wasn't screaming and yelling,

56
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.920
<v 1>no,
whatever the fuck he yelled,</v>

57
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.960
<v 0>sit as receivers</v>

58
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.210
<v 1>supposed to be a post pattern,</v>

59
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.340
<v 0>right?
Whatever the fuck it is,
he yells at them.
He didn't do that.</v>

60
00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:47.580
Once he had his eyebrows down and he looked fucking uncomfortable.

61
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:52.020
He felt people at his feet the whole fucking game.
They never felt comfortable.

62
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.930
And,
um,
you know,
von Miller would do that little fucking little,
the little I'm,

63
00:03:56.931 --> 00:03:58.890
I'm,
I'm going this way.
Oh No,
I'm not.

64
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.860
And the guy fell for it every fucking time on the Patriots,
right?

65
00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:03.210
And I'm thinking like,
Jesus Christ,

66
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:06.660
how much does that dude on the Patriots stink that he keeps falling for that?

67
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.320
And Lo and behold,
I watched von Miller do it all game against Carolina Panthers.

68
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.740
If he,
I don't know if you notice this,
there's a lot of stats.

69
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.660
How many times did you see Cam Newton celebrate?
I got to,
I,

70
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.490
as far as I can remember,
zero.

71
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.680
He didn't do one of those little first down fucking point things.
Eating,

72
00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:28.020
not one kid got a ball,

73
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.330
he never fucking ripped off or enough is soap to show the superman s underneath,

74
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.673
you know,

75
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.793
<v 1>diarrhea.</v>

76
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.210
<v 0>You didn't see that watch Cam Newton had zero fun.
In fact,</v>

77
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:47.260
if I remember correctly,
because I had a lot of Budweiser's um,

78
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:49.690
I probably drank as many.

79
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:54.400
Budweiser's is fucking Peyton manning said he was going to drink by the fourth

80
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:54.611
quarter.

81
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:59.530
The only thing I remember Cam Newton doing was fallen down when they miss the

82
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:03.670
fucking,
uh,
when they miss that,
uh,
that field goal attempt,

83
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.940
it just wasn't their fucking day,
but he got mugged
five mil,
a kid.

84
00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.050
Just see,
just give me that fucking ball.
Yeah.

85
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.620
<v 2>Okay.</v>

86
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.210
<v 0>It's not like fucking Lyman run an after like a bunch of crazy dogs or whatever</v>

87
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.030
of that classic NFL quote goes.

88
00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:23.031
That was just complete fucking domination by the Denver Broncos' defense.

89
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.380
Uh,
to the point,

90
00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:28.500
I think Peyton manning only had about 40 more yards passing than I did.

91
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.300
But you know what,
when it counted,
when it counted,
he got it done.
So,
uh,

92
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.030
congratulations to them.
And I actually,
I went against everything that I said.

93
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.710
I not only,
I didn't take the game,
I forgot to tape it like a fucking asshole.

94
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.040
And I went to a Superbowl party,
which I always say I'm not going,
you know,

95
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:50.320
cause there's always 50 fucking people there and only like,
you know,

96
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.810
12 of them give a shit about the game and everybody else who's running around in

97
00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:58.280
the oil,
all the fucking shit that I fucking had a tampon

98
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.370
<v 3>up my ass above for fucking ever foot those things.
But I actually said,</v>

99
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:04.190
you know what?
Fuck it.
I'm going to go to a party cause you know,

100
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.980
I'm just not into the fucking game or whatever.

101
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:09.560
And then I showed up and I realized that was totally into the game.

102
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:13.460
And fortunately the party I went to,
it was great.
Everybody was into it.

103
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.620
Everybody was watching,
people were saying stuff about the game that made sense.

104
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.790
You know,
it was football fans and the food was fucking tremendous.

105
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.040
And um,
had a great time.
I got to tell you,
go into the Super Bowl party though.

106
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.370
Uh,
something that I never noticed was,
uh,

107
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.790
the just general open hatred for Coldplay.

108
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.480
Why does everybody hate called there?
Why does everybody hate that bed?

109
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.540
They're not that bad.
Right?

110
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.860
Everybody's Artaud is so fucking lame.
They get like,

111
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.940
they get like half,
like Nickelback hate.
You know what I mean?
Hang on a second.

112
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:56.950
Is fucking curtains messed up.
It's driving me fucking crazy craziness.

113
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.640
Stare at it the entire time.
What is the problem?
There we go.

114
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:05.300
Sorry.
I apologize.
Yes.
So,

115
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.350
so cold play comes out.
I don't know what they were singing.

116
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.740
They were jumping around a lot.

117
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.250
I immediately left cause I didn't want to watch Beyonce Sass it up.

118
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.540
You know what I mean?
It's just,
I,
I cannot,
the same way,

119
00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:20.150
you know,

120
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.660
the way she behaves on stage as a way a lot of athletes behave after they make a

121
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:27.080
great fucking play in somewhere that,
that happened during my lifetime.

122
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.780
It went from fucking scoring a touchdown,

123
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.020
just giving the ball to the ref to absolutely.
You know,
just fucking,

124
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.980
I dunno what you do.

125
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.510
You start line dancing and you just can't believe how amazing you are.

126
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.330
Right?
And everybody claims,
oh,
he's having so much fun.
No,
he isn't.

127
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.830
He's marketing himself.
He's hard himself out right now.
All right?

128
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:49.250
You should literally have to put on a pair of fucking stilettos when you do it.

129
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.910
Just walk the fucking block after you fucking dunk or score a touchdown or

130
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:55.370
whatever.
Right?
So I didn't want to watch her,
you know,

131
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:59.270
you know that fucking stupid walk the divas do.

132
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.890
They sort of stomped down the stage as they cross one leg over in front of

133
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.080
[inaudible].
Hey,
hey,
hey,
swinging their fucking hips.

134
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.770
I always just want somebody to just give them a big fucking leg sweep.
That's me.

135
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.290
You know what I mean?
So it's like,
I don't want to watch that shit.

136
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:17.300
So cold play comes up and everybody says,
Ah,
God,
Jesus Christ,
he's,

137
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.560
you know,
no one wants to see him.
It wasn't that bad,
but I could feel it.

138
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.840
You know,
I just want to say,
you know,

139
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.990
I don't understand these fucking bands that sell millions and millions of

140
00:08:26.991 --> 00:08:27.890
fucking records yet.

141
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:32.600
You cannot find one person that will admit that there were fan.
Right?

142
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.480
All you guys right now who are nodding your heads going,
oh yeah,

143
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:39.140
they're so fucking lame.
Scroll through your fucking phone right now.

144
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.820
Go to the seas,
go down to see.
Oh,

145
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.400
you're going to find you got one song admitted you got,
you must have what song,

146
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:50.960
right?
What's that one?
The first hit I was like,
oh,
it's fine.

147
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.500
Look at me face as I walked down

148
00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.420
<v 0>the beach
with all with thing</v>

149
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.540
and it was all yellow.
I married a chick,

150
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:08.400
she had yellow hair.

151
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.620
I didn't wear [inaudible] and I'm still pay and Chad supports.

152
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.090
Does he pay child support to her is,
yeah.

153
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.430
<v 3>The other way around.
That's a close one.</v>

154
00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.490
It's the name of that broad dad that he married.
Huh?
She looks fucking moody.

155
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.380
All those good looking chicks at do fucking yoga.

156
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.980
They're damn fucking basket run in the other directions,
you know?

157
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:38.130
And they had like those stones that are for the CI and they put them around the

158
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:40.500
fucking house and I think they think that makes them spiritual.

159
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.320
You just gotta get the fuck away from him.
You know,

160
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:48.030
anybody with a yoga room and is at least an eight as far as being good looking.

161
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:49.860
You just gotta get the fuck away from there.

162
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.870
They're too good looking to be spiritual,

163
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:53.693
<v 2>you know what I mean?</v>

164
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.090
<v 3>He's never had to buy a drink for yourself in your life.</v>

165
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.070
I don't give a fuck how much yoga you do.

166
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:05.140
You're not going to be able to have any sort of self analysis,
you know,

167
00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.540
like I don't think the thought of,
you know what I mean?

168
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.800
Maybe I was being a cut there.

169
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.890
I don't think that ever fucking goes through your head.
Um,

170
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.360
so I got to commend that guy and Coldplay for not writing a lot of angry songs.

171
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.960
He just Kinda has like,
does he just have nice sign?

172
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.810
I think that's what I think that's a big problem with that band.
It's just nice,

173
00:10:22.811 --> 00:10:27.780
right?
We sync
generally in a good mood,
male.

174
00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:32.220
The guy seems like a happy guy that makes you pretty hateable.
You know what?

175
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:36.810
Anybody you put on a fucking flannel jacket,
right?
Dress like a lumberjack.

176
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:37.021
You know,

177
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:40.320
mocking that hard work as you go fucking sitting around it and your goddamn m

178
00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:43.850
and m's in your green room,
you come out and you send some sinks,

179
00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:45.360
a miserable song.
Everybody likes you.

180
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.083
<v 2>All right?</v>

181
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.910
<v 3>The is that guy's name.
They're saying all those songs.</v>

182
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.720
<v 2>Okay.</v>

183
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.230
<v 3>Ugh.
Nirvana.
Right.
That Cook Kobe.
Matt.
Yeah.</v>

184
00:10:57.231 --> 00:11:00.920
I really wish he didn't kill himself so I could trash it more.
You know,

185
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.260
fucking guy.
I wish I was like,
you know,

186
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.890
<v 0>easily amused.
Hey Corey,
you don't fucking know me.
Go Fuck Yourself.</v>

187
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.200
They fuck you think I'm doing staring at a drain all over here.

188
00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.930
All amazed that it keeps spinning.

189
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.863
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

190
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.480
<v 0>I ain't did shit.
Came out.
It was like,
this just isn't me.</v>

191
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.050
Or was this guy the most condescending kind of sending can't ever,

192
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.980
he comes out there first fucking video.
He's making fun of tap on Solos.

193
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:31.590
Like he could do it.
He just didn't feel like doing it.

194
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:33.460
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

195
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.061
<v 3>Sorry.
This,</v>

196
00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:39.061
this is just the ramblings of a man who's Wa who saw the beginning,

197
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.240
the middle and the end of hair metal,
and he took it all seriously

198
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.950
and that God damn Nirvana,

199
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.690
I just sounded like Giamatti and then fucking Howard stern movie.
Howard Stern.

200
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.550
Yeah.
God Damn Mother Fucker Be v Meme.
Derosa rewound that like 15 times.

201
00:11:57.551 --> 00:12:00.700
You know when the end of the movie when like pig vomit careers just completely

202
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:02.530
in the shitter and he's like standing outside.

203
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.580
He's just dumbfounded at the success that Howard's head.

204
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:11.170
He's just how it started.
He just kind of looks away at God damn motherfucker.

205
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.210
Anyways,
I'm just saying,
you know,
how about in 2060

206
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.760
you know,
there's so much,
so many real things out there to get your passion up,

207
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.770
up about.
I don't think he should go around hating Coldplay.
Oh that poor bastard.

208
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.790
It poor bastard got married to a beautiful woman that did yoga.
Oh my God,

209
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:36.130
it's over.
It's fucking over

210
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.490
some those self-involved fucking human beings you're ever going to find in your

211
00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:46.300
life are going to be in that fucking stinky ass yoga room,
you know?

212
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.790
Speaking of which,
I'm probably going to take a class this week
now.

213
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:54.700
My wife,
she stayed with it man,
seven days in.

214
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:59.070
She's going to try to do yoga this whole fucking month.
Right.
And uh,

215
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.270
she actually asked me,
I can't remember if she asked me on the podcast,

216
00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:03.310
but she asked me,
she goes,
you want to go to one of my yoga classes?

217
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.130
And I was like,
no.
I was like,
I'll do yoga.

218
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:08.950
But I liked doing it here at the house,
you know what I mean?

219
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:14.140
Where like if I feel like stopping doing yoga,
I can just hit pause on the audio,

220
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.400
you know,

221
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.300
go out and have some cereal and then come back and just immediately fast forward

222
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:23.320
to the closing poses.
Right.
There's nothing wrong with that.

223
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.350
I just hate how when you fucking go in there,

224
00:13:26.351 --> 00:13:30.940
they act like they have just the keys to happiness all the time,
you know?

225
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.210
And there's not one picture of anybody on the wall.

226
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.240
You know what these testimonies going like,
you know,

227
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:42.100
I was a really miserable cunt and then I went down and I took fucking Sally

228
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.740
Struthers Yoga class here and I don't know,

229
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:49.390
she was just rambling and I was in down dog and all of a sudden it just clicked.

230
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:53.290
And I have been so happy ever since,
you know,

231
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.650
I'm not saying yoga is overrated,
I just don't need the fucking,

232
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.610
I don't need the chatter from the instructor.

233
00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:05.560
Just tell me the next fucking post to do it.
Tell me to breathe.
Okay.

234
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.620
Stop with your,
with your God damn philosophies.

235
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.940
You ever watch a cooking show and they just get off on these fucking tangents.

236
00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:14.800
It's like,
well,
you just tell me the next ingredient.

237
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.090
I don't even where Bazell comes from and how they used to bring it over.

238
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:22.470
And wooden ships.
I don't give a fuck.
Right.

239
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:26.530
It comes from actually comes from Bazell Romania,
which is how it got its name.

240
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.450
Um,
do you know the amount of people that are actually going to fucking waste of

241
00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:35.620
time tweeting me that there's no such thing as Bazell Romania,

242
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.760
you know,
is if I don't know that that city is not in Italy.
Um,

243
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.470
the,
when somebody did to me the other day,
they,

244
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.390
I talked so much shit on this podcast.

245
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.110
Like when people give me shit for stuff that I say half the time I can't

246
00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:52.040
remember what they're talking about.

247
00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:56.480
So somebody tweeted at me twittered at me and said,

248
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.030
uh,
they said,
you know,

249
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.610
I guess I supported something.
Okay.
For whatever reason they,

250
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.840
they took my rambling seriously and,
and they said,
yeah,

251
00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:08.813
<v 2>ah,</v>

252
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.980
<v 0>supporting blah blah,
blah.
Is it something,</v>

253
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:17.180
do your homework next time you support blah,
blah,
blah.
Right.
And then had a link,

254
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.550
see?
Right,
right out of the gate,
I'm always like,

255
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:22.760
who the fuck is this fucking asshole coming at me with that tote?

256
00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.260
<v 2>Okay,</v>

257
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.220
<v 0>yeah.
Do your homework.
Like I work for you.
You can't.
Right.
So he goes,</v>

258
00:15:28.221 --> 00:15:31.550
do your homework and whatever I said about something,

259
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.100
his could is his fuck.
His homework was,

260
00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:39.101
he sent me a link to an article in the New York Times so that,

261
00:15:39.381 --> 00:15:40.400
that was his homework.

262
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:45.430
He fucking looked at one periodical that leans completely one way politically

263
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.650
right.
The old liberal fucking New York Times.
So like,
and I'm actually,

264
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:53.840
I feel like I'm a liberal.
Right.
Well,

265
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.770
I would never just read the New York Times and just be like,
well there you go.

266
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.560
That's every damn week.
What's happening?

267
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

268
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.220
<v 0>Do you know dumb that is,</v>

269
00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.780
that would be like listening to this podcast and taking it seriously and
wasting,

270
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.780
it's fucking three minutes.
She love to tweet me.
Jesus built,

271
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:15.580
did you bring it all back around your fucking old school?
Cont maybe I did.

272
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:21.200
<v 3>Maybe I did.
How about von Miller?
Huh?
You ever see a more deserving fucking MVP?</v>

273
00:16:21.201 --> 00:16:23.990
He just,
he mugged Cam Newton.

274
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:27.410
He came right in fucking Cam Newton back to pass.
Give me that fucking thing.

275
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.860
Right.
Just ripped it right out of his fucking heads.

276
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.480
Um,
having said that,
I think,
uh,

277
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.210
I think Cam Newton is actually going to definitely going to be back and he's

278
00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:41.330
going to win.
Win a ring and I,
I said that,
I tweeted that and everyone's okay.

279
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.530
<v 0>[inaudible] right.</v>

280
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.080
Their default fucking quarterback to shit on.

281
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:48.523
<v 2>MMM.</v>

282
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.410
<v 3>Cam Newton actually has a fucking running game.
He actually has receivers.</v>

283
00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:57.460
He actually has a fucking unbelievable defense and a fucking contemporary coach.

284
00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:02.380
Dan Marino had none of those things.
He had the receivers duper and Clayton.

285
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.330
Right.
Other than,
I'm not going to go through this again.
Okay.

286
00:17:04.331 --> 00:17:09.331
Just look up the fucking look up running backs from 1983 to 1999 during k Derryn

287
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:15.370
uh,
Dan Marino's fucking career.
I told you Delvin Williams,
Tony,
Nathan,

288
00:17:15.371 --> 00:17:18.850
Kareem Abdul Jabbar,
the football player,
he never,

289
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.570
he never had his Edwards and James is Tony doors setting and he never had that

290
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:26.140
man.
Never had that shit.
Okay.
I'm not saying Cam Newton has that,

291
00:17:26.141 --> 00:17:28.960
but he has enough of a fucking team around it.
Whatever.
Keep talking shit.

292
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.850
You wait.
Cam Newton will be back.
He needed that as a youngster.

293
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.120
He had to feel that fucking awful.

294
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:41.050
This is what it feels like to lose this fucking game,
you know?

295
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:42.510
<v 2>Okay.</v>

296
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.370
<v 3>You watched the next time he goes out there,
he's going to fucking,
uh,</v>

297
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.760
I don't always get to do it,
Bill.
You don't know what the fuck he's going to do.

298
00:17:47.761 --> 00:17:50.040
Your guests,
the guests,
and you guessed,
all right.

299
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.900
<v 0>Last year you thought Seattle was going to win in the fucking patriots when Yo,</v>

300
00:17:53.901 --> 00:17:56.510
you will.
You've taught your own fucking team was going to lose.

301
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.570
All right,
let me read a little bit.
Advertising.

302
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.860
Let me stumble through some advertising.
Here is I attempt to read out

303
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.650
<v 4>loud.
Um,
all right.
With the fuck.
Are we all right?</v>

304
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.700
Oh,
this isn't it.
Oh,
this isn't it.
Oh,
here we go.

305
00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.210
<v 0>All right.
Oh Jesus.
Here it's that time of year.</v>

306
00:18:17.211 --> 00:18:20.180
It's that time a year when you can say,

307
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:24.560
get me some chocolate covered strawberries.
Sherry's berries,

308
00:18:24.561 --> 00:18:28.880
every body.
Oh,
this stupid fucking holiday.

309
00:18:28.881 --> 00:18:32.600
Valentine's Day is just a couple of days away.
Ah,

310
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.890
where are you and your relationship that you're actually nervous that you have

311
00:18:36.891 --> 00:18:39.830
to fucking get your broad something.
I want to be nice if he,

312
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.810
I'm not even read the copy.
You want to be fucking Nice.

313
00:18:41.811 --> 00:18:45.620
If you could just click on something and you guys,
you're fucking,
you know,

314
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.860
you know what von Miller rip the ball out of Cam Newton's hands.

315
00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:51.470
What if you could just put a box,
you could do the exact opposite.

316
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.620
The football is far box of fucking candies,
right?

317
00:18:54.621 --> 00:18:57.230
And rather than ripping it out of her hand,
you just place it in there.

318
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.800
Or maybe Sherry's berries is Cam Newton.
You go give me that fucking thing.
Right?

319
00:19:00.801 --> 00:19:03.550
And he just frisbeed over to your wife.
Girlfriend.
A Gulf.
Huh?

320
00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:08.510
What'd you get Mick?
Yeah.
Nothing right?
Where'd you get high?
New Thumb.
Oh Gee,

321
00:19:08.511 --> 00:19:13.190
thank you.
Where'd it go out of your wake?
Um,

322
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.170
Bella.
High stakes.
Just a couple of days away.

323
00:19:15.171 --> 00:19:19.190
Everybody is and there's only one way to win valentines to win.

324
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.260
<v 4>Okay.</v>

325
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.400
<v 0>Jesus Christ is the way that I resent this copyright now that I actually tap to</v>

326
00:19:25.401 --> 00:19:30.050
talk to my male listeners here,
like they have to dance for their women ladies,

327
00:19:30.051 --> 00:19:32.630
by the way,
why don't you get you,
once you get your man a box of chocolates,

328
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:39.110
I should do it.
You a fucking box of chocolates.

329
00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:42.300
You just give a little fucking little pitch of the cheek there.
Hey,

330
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.510
you go to QUT.
Um,

331
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:49.070
there's only one sure way to have to win on Valentines this year and that is to

332
00:19:49.071 --> 00:19:53.570
win her heart all over again with a box of chocolates.

333
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.900
Jesus Christ health.
What is the reading level of the woman you're with?

334
00:19:56.901 --> 00:19:59.600
It all is going to cost us some chocolate covered strawberry.

335
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.690
Tell a personal story related to Valentine's Day.
Well,

336
00:20:02.691 --> 00:20:06.170
I think it's a complete bullshit holiday.
All right.

337
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.530
I resent the fact that there's some sort of pressure put on me that I'm supposed

338
00:20:09.531 --> 00:20:13.280
to fucking do something for her because there's no day that the lady has to do

339
00:20:13.281 --> 00:20:17.090
some for me.
Alright,
so fuck you.
When your strawberries,

340
00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:20.980
you have to show some hard to win.
And Sherry's berries knows exactly how.

341
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.720
Make sure to get it right this year with romantic,
fresh,

342
00:20:23.721 --> 00:20:25.940
juicy berries from Sherry's berries.
To be honest with you,

343

346
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:41.590
Giant freshly drip dipped strawberries were Sherry's berries starting at just 20

00:20:41.721 --> 00:20:44.270

00:25:06.011 --> 00:25:09.590
I just looked at his name.
For some reason,
age seems like a fat guy named,

424
00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:14.200
you know Husky Hash fat people lead Hash.

425
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.850
You know what I mean?
You know,

426
00:25:15.851 --> 00:25:18.940
you know what it's like a mystery meat and they just fucking scramble an egg on

427
00:25:18.941 --> 00:25:21.850
top of it.
You know it's funny,
I eat hash.

428
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:28.630
<v 0>Is that as fucking is that are a side piece meal or is that a fucking side me or</v>

429
00:25:29.001 --> 00:25:33.230
whatever the fuck he call it.
Side dishes.
Hash is side dishes that have fucking,

430
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.530
and I have no idea,
so many fucking meals.
When I was growing up,

431
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.880
<v 3>um,
I found later we're side dishes.</v>

432
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.400
<v 0>Like when I was growing up,
Mac and cheese was an entree.</v>

433
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.040
My mother would just make a big fucking tray of it and then she'd make some

434
00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:53.530
toast and it was the shit,
the Kraft macaroni and cheese.
It was frozen,
right?

435
00:25:53.531 --> 00:25:55.880
She did the old right there.
Fred through it.
The fucking

436
00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.580
<v 3>through right in the fucking stove,
right.</v>

437
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.290
<v 0>Made it like Golden Brown on top.
She take it out,
scoop it out.</v>

438
00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:07.880
It's the Gilner fuel your shield the fuck out of my face,
right?
A little bit.

439
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:09.610
<v 3>Toast,
right.</v>

440
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:15.950
<v 0>Buttering the toast the way old school moms did every fucking inch or the God</v>

441
00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.790
damn piece of toast

442
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.510
<v 3>and at least,
you know,
at least a quarter stick of fucking butter on it.</v>

443
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:28.490
You know,
remember all those fucking meals from the 70s chicken,

444
00:26:28.491 --> 00:26:32.170
Allah king chipped beef on toast.
I've talked about this before.
I haven't,

445
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:37.180
I green bean casserole was just mushroom soup and they threw fucking green beans

446
00:26:37.371 --> 00:26:39.230
in it.
Just heated it up

447
00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:45.060
and it was a fucking worst man.
I Hate Green Bean casserole.

448
00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.040
I always had a strategy that was either beginning or end.
Anytime it was green,

449
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.100
I was either getting it out of the fucking way or I was just going to put it off

450
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:57.940
like a term paper.
I swear to God to this fucking day,
man,

451
00:26:57.941 --> 00:27:00.250
it took me a long time to every eat like mushroom soup.
Good.

452
00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:05.440
You know Paul Versey thinks mushrooms are useless.
Tell that to the druggies,

453
00:27:05.441 --> 00:27:07.720
man.
He doesn't like mushrooms.

454
00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:11.170
He doesn't like corn and he doesn't like peace.

455
00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:17.500
How do you not like peas man?
There's something fucking wrong with you,
right?

456
00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.180
You've got five if you've got mashed potatoes right,
that are made right.

457
00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.793
Okay.

458
00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:28.690
And then you take the fucking Dispo I and your mush it down and then you'd take

459
00:27:28.691 --> 00:27:31.060
a big clump of butter even though you already put buttering,

460
00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.050
you'd drop it on there.

461
00:27:32.051 --> 00:27:35.830
You put salt and pepper on that and then he got some peas right next to it.

462
00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.890
The Fuck Outta here.
Paul Versey.
What do we hang out with?
Deca?

463
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:44.170
How did you hang out with somebody that doesn't like peas?
You know,

464
00:27:44.171 --> 00:27:47.080
God helped that bastard.
If he ever goes to fucking Scotland,
you know,

465
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:53.130
they're mushy peas.
Um,
anyways.
Anyway,

466
00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:58.140
what the fuck I'm talking about here?
Um,
you know,
I got my car all fixed up,

467
00:27:58.141 --> 00:28:01.560
right?
Got It all fixed up,
got all the dense taken out of it,

468
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:06.060
and I fucking backed into something yesterday.
Not hard by something.

469
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:07.290
I mean somebody else's car.

470
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:14.070
Not Hard,
but hard enough.
I just put a couple of hack marks.

471
00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.610
I didn't do anything to their car.
They of course had a fucking SUV,
so,
you know,

472
00:28:17.611 --> 00:28:20.440
they're like a dentist or something and it had like this,

473
00:28:20.441 --> 00:28:24.330
this fucking license plate holder thing that just dug right into my bumper.

474
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:29.250
So it's already a little hacked up.
But,
uh,
I dunno,
you know,
it's funny.

475
00:28:29.251 --> 00:28:30.720
Ever since I the Prius,
right?

476
00:28:30.721 --> 00:28:33.660
I used to be really good at backing up and ship and ever since the yet like that

477
00:28:33.661 --> 00:28:38.190
backup camera,
like I find myself not even looking anymore,

478
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.770
I become worse salad.
You know what I mean?

479
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:42.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

480
00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.200
<v 3>It's like when you start delegating power,
you've ever job.</v>

481
00:28:45.201 --> 00:28:46.420
He just started delegating power.

482
00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:48.290
Then all of a sudden you just sit behind your desk and you're like,

483
00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:49.460
I really had nothing to do here.

484
00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:54.920
And then you look up and there's your superior standing there in the doorway.
Uh,

485
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.903
what are you doing today?

486
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.330
He had started shuffling some papers and the casino you get laid off,
right?

487
00:28:59.331 --> 00:29:01.940
You just delegated enough fucking bar.
That's what I've done with that,

488
00:29:01.941 --> 00:29:02.810
that backup camera.

489
00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:07.940
I've delegated so much of my fucking census to make sure I don't run over

490
00:29:07.941 --> 00:29:10.400
somebody.
I really shouldn't say this because if I ever fucking hit somebody,

491
00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.340
how bad would that be if they played my own podcast and court?
Right?

492
00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.640
<v 5>Ah,
you Ron.
How are we like to submit into evidence?</v>

493
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.280
A Gibby day,
the podcast

494
00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:25.600
<v 3>from a February the eighth,</v>

495
00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:32.080
2016 where he clearly states that demand does not even look behind his calf when

496
00:29:32.081 --> 00:29:35.840
he backs up.
Clear.
What's a matter?

497
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.520
It's a matter of buddy.
Do you know I,
um,

498
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.520
somebody who's here,
who's here,

499
00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:51.923
who share Cleo?

500
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.273
<v 2>Okay,</v>

501
00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:55.570
<v 3>you want to eat somebody?</v>

502
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.350
<v 2>Okay.</v>

503
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:58.700
<v 3>You're wagging your tail though.</v>

504
00:29:59.330 --> 00:29:59.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

505
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:03.380
<v 3>You never know.
All right buddy.
Relax.
Now they got you all amped up,</v>

506
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.923
<v 2>huh?</v>

507
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.130
<v 3>Nia?
Is there somebody here?</v>

508
00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.673
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

509
00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:15.170
<v 3>Yeah.
It was funny about being married.</v>

510
00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.260
Aside from the fact that you've got a whisper on your own podcast sometimes just

511
00:30:18.261 --> 00:30:22.400
to make your day easier.
It's just the ups and downs,
you know what I mean?

512
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.640
You could see it and your wife's eyes some days she knows why she marries you,

513
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.410
married you.
And then other days she's like,

514
00:30:27.411 --> 00:30:30.980
what the fuck did I get to my wagon to?
And I know it's early.

515
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.680
I know it's early in the day,
but I'm feeling like it's going to be one of those.

516
00:30:33.681 --> 00:30:37.550
What the fuck did I marry day?
[inaudible] get up here.
Come here.
Get up here.

517
00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:42.890
Come on.
How are you buddy?
Huh?
Leon,

518
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.620
could you lay down?
Thank you.
Jesus.
Do you do anything easy?
Dude,

519
00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.820
the fucking thing just collapses down on me.
Um,

520
00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.900
we'll do your homework,
man.
All right,
let's,
uh,

521
00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.770
let's read a couple of questions here for this week.
Was anything else?
Oh,

522
00:31:00.771 --> 00:31:02.930
I know why,
but I was talking about celebrities

523
00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:08.030
talking about fucking candidates.
It's like,
why the fuck do you think I need?

524
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.600
Like I'm undecided and then like the guy who created jag comes on TV or like one

525
00:31:14.451 --> 00:31:17.380
of the stars,
you know,

526
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.780
they were always out there fucking I.
Oh,
what do they do?
What are you doing?

527
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.310
You're an actor,
you're a writer.
The fuck do you know about running the country?

528
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.263
Shut up.

529
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.070
Shop ruining the candidate that I like.

530
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.073
<v 2>Right?</v>

531
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:40.250
<v 3>I like Bernie Sanders because he reminds me of an old fucking club owner that I</v>

532
00:31:40.251 --> 00:31:43.460
had.
And when he get,
when he gets mad and he starts screaming and yelling,

533
00:31:43.461 --> 00:31:47.480
this is clip of him yelling at Alan Greenspan when he was running the Federal

534
00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.160
Reserve and it's a classic fucking clip,
put it on the fucking Internet.

535
00:31:52.161 --> 00:31:54.920
There were like Bernie Sanders takes to fucking,
you know,

536
00:31:56.390 --> 00:32:00.710
whatever the fucking guy from,
uh,
the,
the,
the big bank there.
I just said it.

537
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:04.700
Federal Reserve.
Yeah,
it takes him to task,
right?
So he's reading the Guy,

538
00:32:04.701 --> 00:32:08.200
the riot act and it's just amazing clip.

539
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:11.800
And right when it goes for the other guy to respond,
the fucking thing ends.

540
00:32:11.801 --> 00:32:13.660
It's like,
well,
I want to hear what the other guys said.

541
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.750
Why am I yelling this week?
I want to hear what the other guys says.

542
00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:19.223
<v 2>You know</v>

543
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:25.090
<v 3>what kind of a fucking dope just watches that clip and then doesn't try to find,</v>

544
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:26.480
<v 2>okay.</v>

545
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.880
<v 3>You know what the guy from the Federal Reserve said,</v>

546
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:30.120
<v 2>okay,</v>

547
00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.920
<v 3>right.
The I should at least be able to,
to,
you know,
point counterpoint.</v>

548
00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.980
It's Kinda like that country who sent me that thing,
like,
go do your homework.

549
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.990
He just sends me the thing from the fucking New York Times,

550
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.070
liked the New York Times,

551
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.910
but I would never just read something that they said and below.
Well,

552
00:32:43.911 --> 00:32:48.440
there you go.
Shit,
Joe.
I need to know.
Isn't that right Cleo?

553
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:52.550
We'll exhale into the mic.

554
00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.740
I've been really doing really good about keeping my energy low,

555
00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.290
trying to around the dog.
Um,
to get it to be a little more,

556
00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:04.040
a little more mellow.
Yours.

557
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:10.360
Try and do eat the guess,
um,
my torch and you guys with the fucking thing.

558
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.080
You know what?
That's the only Coldplay song I know.

559
00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:13.850
<v 2>Okay.</v>

560
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:16.820
<v 3>I know there's some other ones.
I go see those guys and concert,</v>

561
00:33:16.821 --> 00:33:21.650
you know what I mean?
Watching some soccer moms.
Losing their fucking minds.
Huh?

562
00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.660
Doing some fucking dance moves from the fucking,
well wait a minute.

563
00:33:27.661 --> 00:33:30.750
They are actually be younger than me.
The hell am I talking about?

564
00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:34.770
I think I need to shut the fuck up.
You know,
I think in general,

565
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:38.890
I think general bill.
Thank you gentlemen.
You might need to shut the fuck up.
Um,

566
00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.400
no,
I'm actually psyched because a,

567
00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:44.880
I was trying to write this thing and I just kept procrastinating.
Right?
Cleo?

568
00:33:44.881 --> 00:33:49.140
I'll see ya.
Um,
I kept procrastinating.

569
00:33:49.141 --> 00:33:51.260
I finally just said fuck it.
And uh,

570
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:56.190
I just broke it down into three segments and over the course of like four days I

571
00:33:56.191 --> 00:33:58.200
was able to finish it and now it's fucking done.

572
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:02.520
And it's like this giant weight off my chest and I don't have to do shit today.

573
00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:07.420
And uh,
Oh,
you know what I'm going to do today?

574
00:34:07.421 --> 00:34:11.620
I'm actually bringing my truck over my old truck.
I,
I found this,
um,

575
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:16.690
this spare tire assembly,
you know,
a lot of them don't have it.

576
00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:20.510
Um,
at least my didn't have and I was able to find it.

577
00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:23.020
It was off this guy's f two 50 that he was going to fix them.

578
00:34:23.021 --> 00:34:25.330
I just kept offering him money for it.
He goes,
Nah,
I don't wanna get rid of it.

579
00:34:25.331 --> 00:34:30.190
And I'd finally way overpaid for an I got it and they a powder coated it,

580
00:34:30.191 --> 00:34:33.190
whatever the fuck that means to match.
It didn't match my truck and everything.

581
00:34:33.191 --> 00:34:36.400
So finally I'm actually going to have a spare tire underneath the fucking thing

582
00:34:36.401 --> 00:34:40.870
the way it's supposed to.
And I'm like,
that's my fucking day.

583
00:34:40.871 --> 00:34:42.400
That's all I got to do today.
You know,
why?

584
00:34:42.401 --> 00:34:45.250
Cause I sat down and I got that fucking thing done.

585
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:49.390
Although the door locks and Mike fucking house,
I still haven't done,

586
00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:54.690
I bought the shit premium paint remover and a poxy remover or whatever the fuck

587
00:34:54.941 --> 00:34:56.350
that is.
I got my little brush.

588
00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:58.570
I'm going to try and get that fucking lockout today.

589
00:34:58.571 --> 00:35:01.900
Cause I told you I got this old ass house,
as I mentioned a zillion times.

590
00:35:01.901 --> 00:35:02.530
And I want the,

591
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:07.530
the interior door locks to work because I think it would be fucking hilarious if

592
00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.070
when I left one time,

593
00:35:09.071 --> 00:35:13.270
if I locked all the fucking doors in the house and then somebody broke into my

594
00:35:13.271 --> 00:35:16.570
house in every fucking room,
they had to like try to break down another door.

595
00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:19.860
They just go to Turner.
They just like,
fuck man,
it's doors locked.

596
00:35:19.861 --> 00:35:23.620
Let's go around the other side.
Fuck,
you know,
10 minutes in,

597
00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:25.150
they're not even trying to be quiet.
And we were like,
dude,

598
00:35:25.151 --> 00:35:28.410
what the fuck the fuck is this guy?
And I didn't it.
Right.
And then,

599
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:29.960
then he goes in and I just have,
you know,

600
00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.200
a bunch of fucking hats and teach free tee shirts from fucking comedy shows.

601
00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:40.920
You know,

602
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.300
there's such an intelligence to just not having really anything of value in your

603
00:35:45.301 --> 00:35:47.220
house.
You know what I mean?

604
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.420
I got a couple of fucking like antique tables and shit like that stuff that I

605
00:35:51.421 --> 00:35:51.991
kind of liked.

606
00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:56.700
But who the fuck's gonna steal that little cat burglar coming out with a fucking

607
00:35:56.701 --> 00:36:00.830
table on his back.
You know,
they liked the fucking,

608
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:05.220
they liked the little shit and they'd come in wearing their yoga pants,
right.

609
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.790
Rappelling down from the fucking roof.
I didn't think it would be hilarious.

610
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:11.170
Who's getting hold the,
the ultimate thing is,

611
00:36:11.171 --> 00:36:14.520
is that you had like security in your fucking house,
right?
And somebody comes in,

612
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.640
right?
And they get to that certain point.

613
00:36:17.641 --> 00:36:20.520
I know I've seen this in movies and they'll all of a sudden there's just that

614
00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:22.910
metal thing comes down so then they can't leave.
Just

615
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.330
frighten the sitting there fucking panicking.
You know what I mean?

616
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:29.700
I always thought that that would be great.

617
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:33.300
And then like I was thinking like eating like a giant room,
right?

618
00:36:33.301 --> 00:36:34.590
When they're in the living room or some shit.

619
00:36:34.591 --> 00:36:36.780
Like all of a sudden they can't fucking get out and they're freaking out.

620
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:40.500
And then they're just sitting there and they think worst case scenario is that

621
00:36:40.501 --> 00:36:43.110
the cops had shown up and they're going to get fucking arrested and they kind of

622
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:47.310
mentally giving themselves into that.
And then you just like,

623
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:51.710
you have like a Cobra,
right?
And he just fucking let it in the room.
You know,

624
00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:55.860
generally speaking,
those things out that fast to just have it just,
just,

625
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.550
maybe you defang the fucking thing.
Well,
that's not,
that's cruelty to animals.

626
00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:03.300
Right?
But it's a reptile.
They're not really animals.
Right?
Um,
no,
you don't.

627
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.870
You just let the fucking thing come in,
coming to show in the hood.

628
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.350
Nobody can fucking hiss like a goddamn reptile man.

629
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.250
You ever go to those alligator farms?
Are you down in Florida?

630
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.460
You know what I mean?
And you're the,
first of all,

631
00:37:17.461 --> 00:37:19.020
you're looking at the people go in there and you're like,
dude,

632
00:37:19.021 --> 00:37:22.950
half of these people have murdered somebody and fed they're victim to one of

633
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:24.780
these fucking things.
I mean,
just Florida is just,

634
00:37:24.781 --> 00:37:26.250
especially in the northern part of Florida,
I mean,

635
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:29.280
it just gets really fucking shady.
Um,

636
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.410
but when you hear those fucking things,
when they hated each other,
Jesus Christ,

637
00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.110
I mean,
it just taps into back.

638
00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.140
I get that to shit that's leftover from when you were a caveman.

639
00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:47.440
You know what I mean?
Like,
just like,
I can't even explain it.
Like I went,
I was,

640
00:37:47.441 --> 00:37:51.370
what the fuck was I?
I can't remember.

641
00:37:51.371 --> 00:37:54.550
I went to a classic one,
two,
I think it was just outside of Tampa.
No,

642
00:37:54.551 --> 00:37:57.430
maybe all of us are at the road in Miami or just south.

643
00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:01.570
It's that one that has the alligator mouth that you will walk right into.
Right.

644
00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:03.820
And I heard that thing fucking hiss.
And Dude,

645
00:38:03.821 --> 00:38:07.330
from that tip of my head to the end of my toe,
tip of my toes,
the top of my head,

646
00:38:07.331 --> 00:38:12.040
I fucked that up.
It just went just fucking like,
I can't explain the feeling,

647
00:38:12.041 --> 00:38:12.791
just that,

648
00:38:12.791 --> 00:38:16.060
that feeling when you lean back in a chair and you almost fall like my entire

649
00:38:16.061 --> 00:38:19.480
body did that.
And the thing was way far away from me.

650
00:38:19.481 --> 00:38:22.750
And I knew logically that it couldn't get to me.

651
00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:27.400
But I still think that from all those years of when we just walked around living

652
00:38:27.401 --> 00:38:31.050
in caves,
that your body's just still trained.
That if,

653
00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:36.051
if it hears that fucking noise there reminds me when I saw three toed slough and

654
00:38:36.461 --> 00:38:41.110
one time I was in Costa Rica,
right.

655
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.800
And we've taken the zip line tour.
Um,

656
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:50.290
it was like the most northern tip of,
of the fucking rain forest and the guide,

657
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:54.010
you know,
these fucking trees were unbelievable.
It was like,
we were like,

658
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.880
it felt like we were 150 feet in the air and we weren't even mid tree.

659
00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:00.310
You looked up,
there was like another 300 feet above you.

660
00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:03.700
It was fucking unbelievable.
It was a,

661
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:06.660
other than the fact that we were there,
you know,

662
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.910
doing a zip line tour and shit and had cell phones and stuff.

663
00:39:09.911 --> 00:39:13.060
It was a fucking paradise.
So this guy did it every day.

664
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:16.120
So he knew where there's three toed sloth was and he looked up and he made this

665
00:39:16.121 --> 00:39:19.720
noise of a,
I forget what the bird is called.

666
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:24.250
It's not an albatross,
but it does begin with an a and as a giant wingspan.

667
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.270
And they're not even in that area anymore because we killed all of them.

668
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:32.500
But to this day,
he imitates in the second he fucking imitated that thing.

669
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:36.430
The fucking three toed sloth just like got up and started fucking looking around

670
00:39:36.431 --> 00:39:40.800
and then look down at us like,
dude,
what the fuck?
You know,
just be like,
don't,

671
00:39:40.801 --> 00:39:42.820
don't do that.
It's not funny,
right?

672
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:48.160
Cause I guess those birds are so fucking big that they would swoop down into the

673
00:39:48.161 --> 00:39:50.410
trees then with their talents.

674
00:39:50.411 --> 00:39:55.210
They would just fucking just basically grab these fucking monkeys and just yank

675
00:39:55.211 --> 00:39:59.600
him out of the tree and you're just completely fucked.
Jesus Christ,

676
00:39:59.601 --> 00:40:01.740
those poor thanks man.
What a fucking way to go.

677
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:05.630
Can imagine me in that fucking slow.
Actually,
I can't,
I'm a classic White Guy.

678
00:40:05.631 --> 00:40:09.250
Can't jump,
can't fucking run fast.
None of that shit.
Right.
Um,

679
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:15.360
doesn't understand dancing,
um,
by men anyways.
Um,

680
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:25.240
um,
that,
I don't even care if you're good at it.
I even care if you're good at it.

681
00:40:25.241 --> 00:40:28.390
I just don't get it.
It just makes me laugh when I see a man dancing.

682
00:40:28.391 --> 00:40:30.130
It just makes me fucking laugh.
I'm sorry.

683
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.790
It's really immature and I and I need to grow up when it comes to that,

684
00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:35.440
but I'm just,
I'm just being honest.
So anyways,

685
00:40:35.441 --> 00:40:37.510
I just can't imagine being that fucking thing.

686
00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:41.740
Like it's slow and it's fucking awful as I am.

687
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.270
I just can't imagine if there was,
can,

688
00:40:43.271 --> 00:40:47.080
you mentioned there's just some giant bird and you were on it's fucking menu and

689
00:40:47.081 --> 00:40:52.081
you lived outside in fucking trees where birds are Jesus fucking Christ.

690
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.310
Any amount of time.
She just sitting there as a tree told sloths,
just chilling,

691
00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.250
talking to a buddy of yours going like,
hey man,

692
00:41:00.251 --> 00:41:02.490
what do you think in the next couple of days,
maybe a

693
00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.960
no.
And your buddies sitting there talking,
he had be like

694
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:17.480
every like maybe like techstars date.
It's Thursday.
And I'll say,

695
00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.340
this fucking thing just grabs your friend.

696
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:22.310
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

697
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:25.070
<v 3>And do you think your friend is just fucking gone?</v>

698
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:26.890
<v 2>Okay.</v>

699
00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:31.160
<v 3>Just gone.
You just see it disappeared.
What do a monkey doing</v>

700
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:34.310
then?

Your heart racing.
Like he just did some blow.

703
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.970
But you only got the speed of a fucking three toed sloth.

704
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.983
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

705
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:50.430
<v 0>Can you just sit there with the other three toed sloth doing what?</v>

706
00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:55.720
Just looking at each other like,

707
00:41:55.721 --> 00:41:58.090

Please make it quick.

708
00:41:58.091 --> 00:42:01.360
Just fucking slice to things and neck already.
Sorry Matt.

709
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.710
He said a lot of empathy when I saw that the way the fucking,

710
00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.460
it's almost like you had to see the fucking thinks face when he made that noise.

711
00:42:09.461 --> 00:42:12.100
When he fucking looked around and looked down and saw that it was us,

712
00:42:12.101 --> 00:42:14.620
he should've seen the look on this fucking thinks face.
He was just like,

713

I swear to God,
if it could just shit on us,
it would have,
and you know what?

714
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:21.650
We would've deserved it.
Well,

You don't want to have to fucking deal with all of that shit,

758

But you need to know how to cook.

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:56.850
not only do you feel like you know your way around the kitchen,

it means eating healthier and saving money instead of ordering expensive takeout

763
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:09.120

Spiced salmon with black rice,
avocado and blood orange salad.

773
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.170
I didn't know there was a such thing as black rice.

774
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:54.630
I knew there was brown rice or white rice,
right?
Caucasian and Latino,

Bok Choy.

I wouldn't do that to you in North Korea.
I wouldn't do that to you.

781
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:23.160

Dude,

789
00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:54.090
Bring it right to your goddamn door.
Let's show you how to cook it.

790
00:46:54.091 --> 00:46:57.390
You learn how to cook a little bit,
you know,
eat healthy.
Stomach is flat,

791
00:46:57.391 --> 00:46:58.320
you know,
and next thing you know,

792
00:46:58.321 --> 00:47:02.130
you get somebody to buy some fucking chocolate strawberries for.
All right,

793
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:06.750
let's get to the questions for this week.
Okay.
Trusting water.

794
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:10.800
Hey Billy,
filter face.
I like that one.

795
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:15.480
A don't trust drinking water.
I don't trust drinking water.
He goes,

796
00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:16.830
my friends think I'm nuts.

797
00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:20.760
They always point to the fact that public drinking water is tested time and time

798
00:47:20.761 --> 00:47:24.500
again.
Now this Flint Michigan Fiasco,
uh,

799
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:27.420
its surface that officials lied about testing,

800
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.070
did slow drip tests from faucets in order

801
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.550
<v 3>to get lower levels of whatever horse shit shouldn't have been there to begin</v>

802
00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:36.910
with.
And even wrote it off because most complaints weren't,

803
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:41.200
were coming from minorities to,
to how do you do that and go to sleep at night?

804
00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:46.470
How do you do that?
How do those companies that do that?
Fracking,
and I'm not,

805
00:47:46.471 --> 00:47:48.370
I'm saying I don't know anything about fracking,
but you know,

806
00:47:48.371 --> 00:47:52.090
I've seen that in some cases it's fucked up to drinking water.
How do you not go?

807
00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:56.440
Oh my God,
we fucked up.
What do we do here?
Oh my God,

808
00:47:56.441 --> 00:47:59.490
we like sat a fucked up.
I'm the worst,
but I'm heading,
how do you,
I don't know.

809
00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.400
I fuck you do it.

810
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:04.570
The best water comes in glass and is fresh from a natural spring.

811
00:48:04.571 --> 00:48:07.750
That doesn't neighbor a dow chemical plant.

812
00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:11.560
I stick to this as much as possible.
I know I'm not nuts.

813
00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:16.700
I saw civil action with John Travolta in the theater once I saw,
oh,

814
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:19.780
he's about 20 years ago and it's haunted me since.

815
00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.030
What's your level of trust when it comes to,

816
00:48:22.031 --> 00:48:26.500
to water and what kind of water do you drink?
Thanks for the Thursday podcast.

817
00:48:26.501 --> 00:48:31.060
Loved the music.
Uh,
that's Andrew Feminists.
Um,
go check.

818
00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.620
Go check in on yourself.

819
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:34.640
<v 4>All right.
Uh,</v>

820
00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:41.210
<v 3>I dunno.
What does my feelings on it?
Yeah,
it's probably a scam or whatever.</v>

821
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:45.950
I really feel that like,
I try to be as healthy as I can.

822
00:48:45.951 --> 00:48:47.420
I have this weird thing where,

823
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:49.130
<v 4>okay,</v>

824
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:52.160
<v 3>you know,
I'm trying to be healthy and live as long as I can.
While.</v>

825
00:48:52.161 --> 00:48:56.900
I also feel that like most people on earth dying would be a great thing.

826
00:48:58.370 --> 00:48:59.203
<v 4>MMM.</v>

827
00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:03.750
<v 3>Cause I just think we're,
yeah,
we're just putting too much stress on all the,</v>

828
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:08.640
on the natural resources.
I believe that personally I do now have I read enough?

829
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:13.200
No.
Do I know what I'm talking about now?
It's just what I do.
What you guys do.

830
00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:17.970
I get a little bit of information and I just run with it in my brain.
Um,

831
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:23.340
and then someone reprimands me on fucking Twitter.
Do you homework me?
And um,

832
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:28.320
I actually had an acting gig with one person one time and they,

833
00:49:28.321 --> 00:49:33.310
they,
they actually got their water delivered.
Um,

834
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:36.710
and rather than being in those giant plastic fucking things that you've got to

835
00:49:36.711 --> 00:49:41.170
tip upside down,
they actually were in glass.
Um,
which,
who,

836
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.860
anything tastes better in a glass.
It always does.

837
00:49:43.861 --> 00:49:47.250
Beer in a bottle tastes better than beer in a can.
Personally,
I feel it does.

838
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:51.780
Um,
but as far as where they get the water,

839
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.830
I don't think it matters as long as they fucking treat it right.
Does it?

840
00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:00.500
It can't.
I don't know.
I don't fucking though,
I have no idea.

841
00:50:00.501 --> 00:50:05.330
I try to drink water as much as I can when I'm not fucking booze and,
but uh,
no,

842
00:50:05.331 --> 00:50:08.090
I don't have any faith in anything anymore.

843
00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:10.190
<v 4>I,
I don't,</v>

844
00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:15.070
<v 3>I went to this little fancy fucking pet store today to get my dog some food and</v>

845
00:50:15.071 --> 00:50:18.730
they were like,
are you in our system?
And I'm like,
no,
I'm not.
And they go,
okay,

846
00:50:18.731 --> 00:50:20.710
just so you know,
whenever you want to be in the system,

847
00:50:20.711 --> 00:50:24.640
will you get a 5% discount every time?
And I just want to be like,
yeah,

848
00:50:24.641 --> 00:50:25.540
and what do you get out of it?

849
00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.050
<v 4>What do you out of it?
You know,</v>

850
00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:31.770
<v 3>you sell my fucking information to somebody and they'd say,
Oh,
well no,
we don't.</v>

851
00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:34.890
Well,
I know you don't.
Why would you do that?

852
00:50:34.891 --> 00:50:38.130
Why would you just give me a 5% fucking discount forever?

853
00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:43.840
That means you read them.
Marking the shit up is no fucking way.

854
00:50:43.841 --> 00:50:48.100
Nobody goes out of their way to fucking make 5% less on some shit,
you know,

855
00:50:48.101 --> 00:50:52.040
forever.
I could say,
hey,
we're having a sale.
You get people in there,
hey,

856
00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:54.610
they kind of get used to go into the store and then you phase it out.

857
00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:59.050
<v 4>You get 5% off every fucking time.
You know,</v>

858
00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:03.280
I think being a paranoid con works.
It really does.

859
00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.620
Except sometimes in relationships it isn't.

860
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:10.980
<v 0>I said he was just a guy at the post office.</v>

861
00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:12.270
I gave him the mail.

862
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.070
<v 3>Um,
all right,
turn up turn offs.
Hey Billy buttercups,</v>

863
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:20.270
my friend and I were having a discussion about what turns us off about girls,

864
00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:25.400
the usual gross things and physical appearance.
Things came up.
Uh,
I threw out.

865
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:26.580
I throw out there.
Yeah.

866
00:51:26.581 --> 00:51:31.220
And I hate it when girls throw themselves at you with the disclaimer that if

867
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.770
you're,
if you're a quality,

868
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:37.430
if you're equally as into the girl,
it's not a problem.

869
00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:41.810
What do you think about this isn't me or does it feel weird when a girl just

870
00:51:41.811 --> 00:51:44.060
puts it all out?
That out there,

871
00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:49.840
you said out that out there and starts casually mentioning her vantage cause she

872
00:51:49.881 --> 00:51:51.800
thinks it's going to interest you as something.

873
00:51:51.801 --> 00:51:55.250
Some of my friends thought I was nuts.
The other sort of agree.

874
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:58.430
Thanks and go crush yourself.
Um,

875
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:04.640
it all depends.
It all depends on the,
on the person,

876
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:07.730
you know what I mean?
Generally speaking,
if you just meet somebody,

877
00:52:07.731 --> 00:52:11.480
you know and you have no idea who they are and they just start throwing

878
00:52:11.481 --> 00:52:14.960
themselves at you,
you know,
and you look how I look,
you're like,
ah,

879
00:52:14.961 --> 00:52:18.710
I don't think this is their first Rodeo.
It makes me nervous.

880
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:24.170
That would make me very nervous as far as like,
uh,
what's that beach?

881
00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:29.260
<v 0>Every song she's been around a Nova town oral cop.</v>

882
00:52:29.711 --> 00:52:31.490
You laid so no leader.

883
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:36.500
<v 3>Um,
I would,
uh,
yeah,
I can see what that would,
that would freak you out.</v>

884
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:38.960
But if,
um,

885
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:47.820
<v 4>and how,
I don't know,
she's like in her thirties and she's just like,
look,
I'm,</v>

886
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:51.450
<v 3>and I'm not looking for a relationship.
You just want to kind of,
yeah.</v>

887
00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:56.690
Going to be fuck buddies area F yeah.
When I'm fucking,
that's what I do too.
I go,

888
00:52:56.691 --> 00:53:01.040
yeah.
You know,
that always turns the ladies on.
Nothing gets them turned on.

889
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:05.600
Like cracking your voice.
Yeah.
Zev.
Um,

890
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:12.470
that just made me completely forget what I was going to say.
Oh fuck.

891
00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:17.670
I had a funny story too.
God dammit
Baba Blah Blah.
Oh yeah.

892
00:53:17.671 --> 00:53:19.710
You know,
I don't like when women try to be dominant

893
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:24.740
<v 4>either.
You know what I mean?
They just,</v>

894
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:26.083
I don't know.

895
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:26.963
<v 0>They fucking,</v>

896
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:30.720
they get on topic and they're like grabbing your wrists and they've got this

897
00:53:30.721 --> 00:53:32.700
stupid look on their face and you just thinking like,
you know,

898
00:53:32.701 --> 00:53:35.550
if I want it to I can just throw me off the bed.
Not for nothing.

899
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:40.200
But if you read through it,
um,
yeah.
I understand what you're saying here.
Uh,

900
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:41.333
if,

901
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:43.250
<v 2>okay.</v>

902
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:47.690
<v 0>It's all how they do it.
If they just coming up confident their rent to you.
Yeah.</v>

903
00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:50.720
But if they just start talking about their fucking hoo ha.
Yeah.

904
00:53:50.721 --> 00:53:53.840
A lot of it is the same.
It'd be like for a woman,
if a guy just came out,

905
00:53:53.841 --> 00:53:57.530
he just flops his dick on the bar.
Ah.
Who wants it?

906
00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:02.900
Come and get it.
Uh,
yeah.
I would think that would turn anybody off.
All right.

907
00:54:02.901 --> 00:54:04.550
Global warming scam.

908
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:07.333
<v 2>Okay.</v>

909
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:11.030
<v 0>Um,
all right.
Global warming scam.
Okay.</v>

910
00:54:11.031 --> 00:54:14.710
This is like a something that people keep sending me.
Um,

911
00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:17.780
and they keep sending it to me as if my opinion,

912
00:54:17.781 --> 00:54:19.700
it has any sort of scientific background.

913
00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.270
I'm just basing it on scientist.

914
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.750
That's all I'm basing it on.

915
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:32.530
And that fucking two and a half times the size of Texas and two miles deep swirl

916
00:54:33.021 --> 00:54:35.540
of garbage and the fucking Pacific Ocean.

917
00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:40.820
Then how just about every fish has have some degree of plastic in there fucking

918
00:54:40.821 --> 00:54:44.630
system.
Uh,
okay.
But even now,
but none of that has to do with temperature.

919
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:45.681
I love your show.

920
00:54:45.681 --> 00:54:49.070
It's really refreshing to hear someone in show business actually talk about some

921
00:54:49.071 --> 00:54:53.630
very important social pertinent things.
When the fuck do I ever do that?

922
00:54:53.631 --> 00:54:57.470
Like what football?
Three toed slots

923
00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:02.360
flopping your Dick on the Barth.
This,
these are important to you.
Um,

924
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:06.230
I agree with everything you talk about on your show.
I don't need you to,
he goes,

925
00:55:06.231 --> 00:55:09.440
except or she says that he or she accept global warming.

926
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:13.160
The global warming scam is another system of control.

927
00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:16.850
I agree.
We should stop using oil and coal.

928
00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:21.710
These carbon sources are highly polluting and release toxins in mercury into the

929
00:55:21.711 --> 00:55:25.070
biosphere.
But this has nothing to do with global warming.

930
00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:29.390
I know you love documentaries at God.
Can,

931
00:55:29.391 --> 00:55:32.090
can you guys just something my mom taking in a country way.

932
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.870
I know you love documentaries.
God knows you don't read.
No,
he's probably right.

933
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:40.190
Uh,
look up global warming swindle on Youtube.

934
00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:44.330
A little taste in the global warming,
the global warming rat hole.

935
00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:49.430
There's a ton of other information on the web that exposes this bullshit scam.

936
00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:54.500
Good luck.
And looking forward to hear what you have to say about this.
See,

937
00:55:54.501 --> 00:55:55.720
I don't get that.

938
00:55:56.690 --> 00:56:01.690
I'm supposed to just look up a bunch of shit that all agrees with the other side

939
00:56:01.701 --> 00:56:04.160
and then the other side's wrong.
That's like me saying to you,

940
00:56:04.161 --> 00:56:07.910
look up all these shit about global warming and how we're affecting the climate

941
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:12.110
and I'm looking forward to see what you have to say.
Um,

942
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:17.510
I would think that,
uh,

943
00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:20.010
<v 2>okay.</v>

944
00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:22.380
<v 0>The fact that in France,</v>

945
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:28.740
all the leaders of the world just got together with all these scientists and all

946
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:33.640
that and even on the right they forward has been saying it's bullshit from day

947
00:56:33.641 --> 00:56:37.450
one.
From day one,
they were saying it's fucking bullshit.

948
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:43.000
Um,
even they finally came out and they said,
yeah,
it's,
we are affecting it.

949
00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:46.180
And then they were like,
but it's too late to do anything now.

950
00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:49.900
Like that's what they came out with.
So why would they be doing that?

951
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:54.290
Why would they,
why we'll wait a minute,
wait a minute.

952
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:59.440
You're saying that they're doing it to try to control us and such a long way to

953
00:56:59.441 --> 00:57:04.390
go isn't it
gave,
they just control this by scaring the shit out of us.

954
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:06.790
The normal way.
Like,
oh,

955
00:57:06.791 --> 00:57:09.790
there's this group of people that doesn't have planes or a boat and they're

956
00:57:09.791 --> 00:57:13.990
coming over here to get us like they'd been doing for 15 fucking years.

957
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:18.580
Can't they just do that?
Um,
I'll watch those things,

958
00:57:18.581 --> 00:57:21.490
but I would like to know who paid for those,

959
00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:23.770
who finance those documentaries.

960
00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:28.360
Because if they're companies that are getting attacked for it,
you know,

961
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:30.820
there's obviously,
you know,

962
00:57:30.821 --> 00:57:33.550
getting attacked for the pollutants that they're putting into the atmosphere,

963
00:57:33.551 --> 00:57:35.050
then,
you know,
they could be going,
well,

964
00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:39.460
we need to get this off of us by putting the real information out there.

965
00:57:39.461 --> 00:57:42.580
But generally speaking,
I've,
I as a rule,

966
00:57:42.581 --> 00:57:46.030
I don't believe corporations,
I just don't,

967
00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.870
people in general,
I mean I'm fortunate,
right?
Why the fuck would I believe?
Uh,

968
00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.230
I watch it.
You know what?
I hope you know what?
This is the thing.

969
00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:55.710
I actually hope you're right because then again,

970
00:57:55.711 --> 00:57:58.000
I'm a lot less guilt and just go out and buy some fucking

971
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:03.850
Goddamn v eight man,
get out there and fucking drive around.
Do some doubts.

972
00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:05.200
A PS,

973
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:09.280
global warming carbon credits are controlled by the same crooked bankers that

974
00:58:09.281 --> 00:58:13.530
are fucking up the world economy.
Well,
I kinda think like the bankers don't,

975
00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.730
they control everything.
They kind of own everything,
right?

976
00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:19.960
Are we still making payments on the White House?
Do they have to refinance that?

977
00:58:19.961 --> 00:58:23.290
And I know it burned down in the 18 hundreds who knows?
I'm new girlfriend.

978
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:27.190
Bullied by friends.
Girlfriend.
Okay,

979
00:58:27.191 --> 00:58:32.010
so you're new chick gets bullied by
WHO's friend?

980
00:58:32.011 --> 00:58:33.230
Why?
I guess I got to read it.
All right.

981
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:37.670
I wanted your advice on something minor yet difficult for me to figure out on

982
00:58:37.671 --> 00:58:40.520
how to approach.
I've just done pretty well for myself.

983
00:58:40.521 --> 00:58:43.610
Getting a beautiful girl recently,

984
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.140
like she's physically attractive and has an ass I could balance a beer on.

985
00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:51.080
Good for you.
Anyway,
our friend,

986
00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:54.950
our friend group has a pretty good size even though some of our friends have

987
00:58:54.951 --> 00:58:59.390
moved 30 minutes to an hour away,
but a problem came up recently.

988
00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:04.720
A friend of mine from out of town recently came by with his girlfriend and after

989
00:59:05.091 --> 00:59:06.140
a night out of drinking,

990
00:59:06.141 --> 00:59:11.141
my girlfriend informed me his girlfriend bullied her and treated her like shit

991
00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:15.530
in high school.
All right,
well that was a long time ago.

992
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:18.470
Well that's the next thing he goes.
I told her that was a long time ago.

993
00:59:18.471 --> 00:59:22.040
That's what I want to say.
He goes with 26 and that

994
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:22.671
<v 3>she shouldn't,</v>

995
00:59:22.671 --> 00:59:26.930
should try to approach her to which she replied that when the girl in question

996
00:59:26.931 --> 00:59:31.010
said hello to me,
she looked at her and just walked away.

997
00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:34.540
Totally.
That was a long time ago.
Wait,
wait.

998
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:38.950
And that she should approach it to which my girlfriend implied that when the

999
00:59:38.951 --> 00:59:42.130
girl in question said hello to me,

1000
00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:46.620
she looked at her and just walked away.
Wait,

1001
00:59:46.621 --> 00:59:47.460
who walked away?

1002
00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:52.920
Then when the girl in question said hello to me,

1003
00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:56.670
dude,
I don't know who's saying what here.

1004
00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:02.320
She also told me her high school was quite small and the girl in question and

1005
01:00:02.321 --> 01:00:03.850
many others made it hell for her.

1006
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:07.420
Here's my question for the freckled Fucko of La.

1007
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:10.720
How would you approach this situation?
Keep in mind,

1008
01:00:10.721 --> 01:00:15.280
I'm not the best of buds with the dude.
We're just in the same friend circle.

1009
01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:20.420
Well,
what happened?
You're 26 you're probably going to see her like what?

1010
01:00:20.421 --> 01:00:24.500
Once every couple of fucking weeks.
Yeah,
I don't,

1011
01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:25.760
I don't think it's a problem.

1012
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:28.003
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1013
01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:29.530
<v 3>I would just look at her,
just be like,
Hey,</v>

1014
01:00:29.531 --> 01:00:32.930
can you stop fucking making a big deal out of nothing,
uh,

1015
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:36.100
before you stick your fucking head and I stick it in the cupboard or you start

1016
01:00:36.101 --> 01:00:40.660
bullying or,
I dunno what I would do.
I would just be like,

1017
01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:41.533
um,

1018
01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:43.563
<v 2>okay.</v>

1019
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:45.710
<v 3>Yeah.
How would you say looking at 26 years old?</v>

1020
01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.070
High school ended eight years ago.
Um,

1021
01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:53.200
I just let it go because she doesn't give a fuck.

1022
01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:57.340
Bullies never remember the shit that they did to you and she's probably jealous

1023
01:00:57.341 --> 01:01:01.000
because you beautiful with an ass.
She could balance a drink on right now.

1024
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.080
It's probably what it is.

1025
01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.173
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1026
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:08.720
<v 3>I Dunno.
In the meantime,
while you take some,
a Jujitsu classes.</v>

1027
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:14.000
Alright,
we'll Israeli a fucking martial arts.

1028
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:17.460
I always want to take that shit.
You know,

1029
01:01:17.461 --> 01:01:19.180
a little Jujitsu and then that fucking Israel,

1030
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:24.120
whatever the Israeli martial arts shit is the fuck is that shit called.

1031
01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:28.530
I don't even fucking know.
I always just start like that shit.
It's just like,

1032
01:01:28.531 --> 01:01:33.030
you know,
because of the level,
the stakes going on over there.

1033
01:01:33.031 --> 01:01:35.970
Like this just is,
no,
I guess they're all a fish.

1034
01:01:35.971 --> 01:01:37.350
I don't know fucking shit about fighting,

1035
01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.390
but I was just felt like that that would be the shit,
you know,

1036
01:01:39.391 --> 01:01:44.040
just because of where Israeli is and how they never have planes get hijacked or

1037
01:01:44.041 --> 01:01:45.840
anything.
They just got shit on lock down.

1038
01:01:45.841 --> 01:01:48.210
You would think that their martial arts would,
they would be,

1039
01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:51.540
they would definitely be a lot of interesting,

1040
01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:55.260
I would think I gouging just fucking do you take your fucking index and your

1041
01:01:55.261 --> 01:01:58.170
middle finger and you just fucking,
they probably know how to do that.

1042
01:01:58.171 --> 01:02:03.000
That macgruber throat snatch thing,
you know,
snatching throats.

1043
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.180
Um,
anyways.

1044
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:07.640
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1045
01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.370
<v 3>Yeah.
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm not,
I'm not good at that shit,
dude.
I,</v>

1046
01:02:10.371 --> 01:02:14.020
if you haven't noticed,
I don't know a lot about women.
I really don't like I,

1047
01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:18.800
I grew up,
you know,
uh,
with way too many.
It was,

1048
01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:22.800
it not balanced,
you know what I mean?
It was not,
uh,

1049
01:02:23.410 --> 01:02:24.560
it was just fucking,

1050
01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.370
<v 2>okay.</v>

1051
01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:29.080
<v 3>I don't know.
To this day,
it's still,
I mean,</v>

1052
01:02:29.081 --> 01:02:33.340
I had all brothers for the most part and then the dog and that dog was a fucking

1053
01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:36.160
boy,
you know what I mean?
It was just total overload,

1054
01:02:36.161 --> 01:02:39.100
a testosterone and then my mom and we lived up on a busy street,

1055
01:02:39.101 --> 01:02:42.220
so we just all interacted with each other.
And um,

1056
01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:49.210
yeah,
this is one of those fucking,
this is one of those.

1057
01:02:49.211 --> 01:02:52.140
That's one of those chick moments where I'm just really bad.
I'm just like,
uh,

1058
01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.930
well did she try to punch you?
Did she ever beat you up before then?

1059
01:02:55.931 --> 01:03:00.700
Like what's the fucking problem?
Just tell her to go fuck herself.
Right.

1060
01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:06.730
You don't understand.
You know Canada at,
it's still frustrating.

1061
01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.560
I know,
I know.
It's not you.
I know it's not you.

1062
01:03:08.561 --> 01:03:11.020
I know you're trying and I appreciate that.
I just feel like,

1063
01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:16.420
and they start talking to me and I sit there and I'm nodding and I'm listening

1064
01:03:16.421 --> 01:03:18.310
and just over this shoulder,

1065
01:03:18.311 --> 01:03:21.970
there's a TV with a game on and I start looking at it and looking at them.

1066
01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.193
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1067
01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:28.140
<v 3>Start acting like I'm rubbing my forehead,
you know,</v>

1068
01:03:28.141 --> 01:03:30.720
blocking their view of one of my eyes so I can look at the fucking TV.

1069
01:03:30.721 --> 01:03:33.240
I start doing that shit and then eventually I get busted and then they get mad.

1070
01:03:33.241 --> 01:03:37.650
You know what I mean?
Um,
anyways,
if you would like to donate to this podcast,

1071
01:03:37.651 --> 01:03:40.290
it's very easy to do.
It won't cost you any money.
It just cards.

1072
01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.510
She had an extra couple of clicks.
If the index finger,

1073
01:03:42.511 --> 01:03:47.080
you just go to [inaudible] dot com and you click on the podcast page,

1074
01:03:47.081 --> 01:03:49.920
does it link to Amazon?
Next time you want to buy something on Amazon,

1075
01:03:49.921 --> 01:03:50.351
you can do this.

1076
01:03:50.351 --> 01:03:54.000
She just click on it and I get credit for driving traffic to Amazon.

1077
01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:57.990
And what if you buy something?
They kicked me a couple of bucks or whatever.

1078
01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:01.620
And uh,
and then I used to kick it to this fucking charity.

1079
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.650
The people sent me enough shit that said it was a scam.

1080
01:04:04.651 --> 01:04:09.120
So now I give it to saint Jude saying,
you Jay's.

1081
01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.410
Um,
that's what I try to do.
I give a portion of the proceeds.

1082
01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:16.320
Well,
what portion bill?

1083
01:04:16.321 --> 01:04:19.170
We talking like an NFL portion know way better than the NFL.

1084
01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:24.210
I take 10% and I throw it to the fucking to Saint Jude's.
All right.

1085
01:04:24.211 --> 01:04:28.270
That's pretty good,
right?
Considering fucking the NFL does,
what will they do?

1086
01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:33.100
Do like 3% of that hundred dollars Jersey and then they give it to the pink lady

1087
01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.890
so she can go out and get herself a pink Cadillac.
All right.

1088
01:04:37.891 --> 01:04:40.820
That's the podcast for this week.
Everybody once again,

1089
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:44.590
congratulations to the Denver Broncos and Peyton manning.

1090
01:04:44.591 --> 01:04:47.480
It was so fucking great to see that guy go out of winter,
man.
Um,

1091
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:50.400
I did not want to see him,
you know?

1092
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:51.760
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1093
01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.320
<v 3>You know what I mean?
I don't know.
I just,
I didn't want to see him get,
fuck.</v>

1094
01:04:54.321 --> 01:04:56.770
Anyone want to see me?
His fucking ass kicked.
They get on a Superbowl.

1095
01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.070
I really did not want to see that.
And I'm,
I could Dolan,
since the panther fans,

1096
01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:05.410
you know,
you guys had a hell of a season.
A river bolt.
Ron,

1097
01:05:05.411 --> 01:05:07.080
is that his name?
Someone's tweeting me said,

1098
01:05:07.081 --> 01:05:08.770
is that the best fucking nickname and sports?

1099
01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:10.480
I didn't even know the guy's name to be honest with you,

1100
01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:13.120
but I saw him on the sideline at one point the second quarter,

1101
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.230
and I said to my buddy,
I go,

1102
01:05:14.231 --> 01:05:17.550
that guy looks like the winning coach of a super bowl.
Um,

1103
01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.240
that's what I felt like when I saw the guy.

1104
01:05:19.241 --> 01:05:22.420
So obviously you guys are going to be back a block of time.

1105
01:05:22.421 --> 01:05:26.230
She get there and you don't win it the first time and then you remember what

1106
01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:28.000
that feeling's like and then you come back.

1107
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:33.360
<v 4>Uh,
I dunno.
You guys should be all right.
You'll get one right?</v>

1108
01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:37.050
<v 3>Well it all Peyton Madec,
he fucking hung in there.
We got one.</v>

1109
01:05:37.051 --> 01:05:42.051
John Elway came in there and this Denver's the fucking place to go for old

1110
01:05:42.631 --> 01:05:45.810
fucking quarterbacks to get one more.
What do you guys think?

1111
01:05:45.811 --> 01:05:46.950
Do you think he retires?

1112
01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.240
<v 4>He should.
He should.</v>

1113
01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:53.700
<v 3>There's already rumors that he's going to be coming out here to the Los Angeles</v>

1114
01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:58.020
Rams,
you know,
which you'd be very Joe Nemeth,
Joe Willie,

1115
01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:02.370
Joe Willie ended.
That's actually,
that's a good fucking quiz,

1116
01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:03.673
Huh?

1117
01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:08.930
He named hall of fame quarterbacks in teams that they ended with Joe name at the

1118
01:06:08.941 --> 01:06:13.530
end of what?
The rams.
Johnny John Unitas.
Johnny Unitas.
Andy with San Diego,

1119
01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.393
I believe.

1120
01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:16.980
<v 4>MMM,</v>

1121
01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.161
<v 3>tired man.</v>

1122
01:06:19.161 --> 01:06:21.950
Once you think once they fucking disappear and they go off the fucking radar.

1123
01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:24.280
<v 4>Let's pick another one here.</v>

1124
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:30.070
<v 3>Drew Bledsoe.
Who did he finish with?
Drew Bledsoe.</v>

1125
01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:30.970
Went to the bills.

1126
01:06:30.971 --> 01:06:34.150
Then he went to the cowboys and I want to say you went somewhere else.

1127
01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:36.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1128
01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:38.590
<v 3>Brett Farve.
Where did he end?
Vikings.</v>

1129
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:44.540
Who was going to go to the vikings at the end of his career at the last second

1130
01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:48.620
said,
fuck that.
I'm not doing it and was a smart move.
I mentioned earlier,

1131
01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:54.710
Dan Marino,
Dan Marino had an offer and he said,
no,
fuck it.
I'm not doing it.

1132
01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:57.530
And what's great is all of his highlights.
He's wearing the dolphins uniform.

1133
01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:59.150
He doesn't have that sad,

1134
01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:03.140
you know the last team I fucking played for uniform.

1135
01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:04.773
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1136
01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:06.310
<v 3>Emmitt Smith.
What did he finish?</v>

1137
01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.970
<v 4>Oh,
Arizona.
Yeah,</v>

1138
01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.570
<v 3>Franco Harris.</v>

1139
01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:12.580
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1140
01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:16.800
<v 3>Seattle Seahawks.
You know what?</v>

1141
01:07:16.801 --> 01:07:18.540
I think I invented a good drinking game.

1142
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:24.410
Might you just go through,
then somebody's got to look it up.

1143
01:07:24.411 --> 01:07:27.730
Then that means somebody knows all the answers.
You know what I think?

1144
01:07:27.731 --> 01:07:30.940
I just thought I had a great idea,
but I didn't.
All right,
go fuck yourselves.

1145
01:07:30.941 --> 01:07:32.860
I'll check it on Thursday.
