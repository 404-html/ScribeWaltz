Michelle or whatever the fuck.

13
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
I don't know you Hermes one I completely shit faced right now is because I have

14
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:49.610
a kid.
That's another good reason for becoming a parent.

15
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.300
It's not because you want to raise a good person and experience a level of Love

16
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.340
Amar that you've never felt before.

17
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.580
It's really because you failed in your own attempts at sobriety and you're too

18
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:10.310
much of a loner and your two anti social to ever go to Aa.

19
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.960
That's the time to have long form to have a kid,
a baby,
right.

20
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.470
We are where they meet.
Yeah.
Ah Yeah.
Ah,

21
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.350
way he said the week.
You sound like some dumb tourist,
right?

22
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.020
Um,
yes.

23
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.530
If it's funny over here is I've been just fucking torturing these people with my

24
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:33.890
French and I don't give a fuck when they start speaking English back to me.

25
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:34.880
I don't switch you over.

26
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.930
I'm going to fucking sit there and search for the word and you're going to sit

27
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:40.220
there and fucking take it.

28
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.960
Like you have the biggest fucking moron ever sitting across from you on the

29
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:49.961
$10,000 pyramid and the clock's ticking and you ain't went in mad baby.

30
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.360
MMM.
I fucking love it over here.

31
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.210
I love the people.
I love the food.
I,

32
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.440
I could literally lose the next 20 years of my life staying over here pretending

33
00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:05.750
that I'm an intellectual.

34
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.480
It's just something about getting shit faced in a cafe.
You just don't feel like,

35
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.560
you know,
we don't do it right in America where they make you go inside,

36
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:18.290
where it's all dark and you got a hunch down and fucking,

37
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.860
it takes you like 20 minutes just for your eyes to adjust to see if there's

38
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:24.470
anybody else in there.
Right.

39
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.060
The person had been hitting on is a him or a her I man Rsr here comes pat.

40
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.180
Um,
out here they let you be a drunk in public.

41
00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:38.960
He just sit there on the side of the new rule the street,
right?

42
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.500
And you fucking sit there with a sport coat on a little pocket square and you,

43
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.130
you,
if you feel like you're reading,

44
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.960
I have not improved myself at all as a human being over here.

45
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:57.650
And I could not be having more fun.
I've eaten a fucking bag ed.

46
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.730
Every God damn day.
Uh,

47
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.190
I've gone to know museums and went to the Notre dam.

48
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.420
I went over there finally,
I was just,
we went over there,
go,

49
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:11.590
let's take a fucking picture.

50
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.710
And what I love about my laugh mall proper fam is that,

51
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.120
uh,
she doesn't give a shit about that stuff either.

52
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.660
I told you that story when we went to [inaudible],
right?

53
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.110
And we did what everybody who doesn't give a fuck about art does.

54
00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:29.610
We went in there and we were like,
hey,

55
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.120
fuck the other 900 million square feet of art.

56
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.130
Where is the model?
Elise?
Monalisa.
Right?
And they told her it was,

57
00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:41.490
and we went in there and we like,
there it is little bit bigger than a stamp.

58
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.410
You good?
I'm good.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
And that was it.
That's it.

59
00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:50.810
We left.
I thought,
oh gosh,
I don't know how we get out of there,
but we,

60
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.770
I don't remember the exact directions.
Okay.

61
00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:56.040
But we've just fucking got out of there.
And uh,
you know,

62
00:03:56.041 --> 00:04:00.970
when we were coming into town,
oh,
which I used to know that word.
Um,

63
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.630
I wish I could have taken a video if I was ever teaching a class on creativity.

64
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.320
Okay.
First of all,
who the fuck would ever have me teach anything?
And secondly,

65
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.710
where do I get off acting?
Like I'm creative.

66
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.450
I'm a curmudgeon and I'm good at criticizing shit.
All right?
However,

67
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.630
I'm going to criticize this.
There was like fucking,

68
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.680
I think I already talked about this.
We would passing in front of,
uh,

69
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.410
uh,
and,
uh,

70
00:04:28.411 --> 00:04:33.411
they said stupid fucking glass pyramid that they made that I think a lot of

71
00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:36.900
Parisian didn't like,
you know,
they don't like anything new.

72
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:40.170
Anything new is fucking,
you know,
I don't know.
I don't know what they call it.

73
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.750
A vulgar,
that's one of the best insults ever,

74
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.190
you know,

75
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.550
to describe something you just did and the less someone just said a bunch of f

76
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:55.230
bombs,
then it's,
it's whatever.
But if you'd like to make fun of somebody's shirt,

77
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.720
the design of it and described it as vulgar,
um,
I dunno,

78
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.750
that's about as deep as it gets for someone who doesn't curse I think.
Right.

79
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.750
So when was a sport coat on stage?
Right?
Standing up there

80
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.570
like Johnny Carson still hosts in the tonight show and they're working on their

81
00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:15.640
five minutes set.
I don't fucking know.
Um,
anyway,
so we would drive in.

82
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.010
You cut through
and uh,
the,

83
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.220
what is a bunch of fucking tourists all standing up having somebody else take

84
00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:30.180
the picture as they pretend to be like holding the top of the pyramid.

85
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.771
I swear to God,

86
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:35.220
we drove by and there was like nine people all doing it at the same time,

87
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.170
you know?
And if I was ever a lit professor,

88
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.680
I would take a video of that and you'd go,
you see this shit right here?

89
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.980
If you want to be creating,
don't do that.

90
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.820
This difference between being inspired

91
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.640
by seeing somebody doing something and then just going up and doing exactly what

92
00:05:56.641 --> 00:05:58.910
the fuck doing.
Yeah.

93
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.790
It's still going to be a great picture of what's going to happen is that's going

94
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:05.300
to be the fucking hacky thing that you do,
right?

95
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.940
Until somebody switches it up.
And this is what kills me.

96
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:12.530
This is going to be one person that switches up what you do with yourself in the

97
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:17.531
foreground of that stupid fucking glass pyramid in front of them that you right.

98
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.000
And if it gets enough hits and lol dolls and uh Oh my God,

99
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.500
this is the greatest Instagram photo ever,
then everybody will do that.

100
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.820
You know?
I don't know.

101
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.560
Someone will plank on it if people remember that the fucking moment of

102
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:36.410
creativity,
laying face down on something.

103
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.570
I'm not laying face down and not doing anything.
I'm planking.
Oh Jesus.

104
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:44.750
Bill a couple of beers and you become even more canteen.
Huh?

105
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.800
Why don't you order a side order a Tampon?
Um,

106
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.360
anyways,
I resent the fact that I have to still do these fucking things.

107
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.120
All right.
I'm on vacation.
Do you go to work when you're on vacation?

108
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:58.490
I don't think you'd do.
Um,

109
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.060
my relatives came out to that show when I was in England and they bought me a

110
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:06.560
bottle.
I don't know why,

111
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.240
but they have salted caramel.
Oh my God.

112
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.110
Coco Vodka.
Liqour

113
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.290
and um,

114
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.820
it's just been sitting here staring at me and I gotta be honest with you.

115
00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:25.730
I'm just wondering,
I got to know what that hangover feels like.

116
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.970
It's like you have a watch one of those as far as hangovers go,

117
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.010
you ever watch a sounds like it's almost nap time.
You have a hit.

118
00:07:36.011 --> 00:07:38.320
You ever watched one of those things?
I'm like,
what the,

119
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.790
the army ranger training or navy navy seal training.

120
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.530
This is like the hang,
like you think you had a fucking hangover?

121
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.850
Like you think you're out there,
right?

122
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:51.200
You think you're working out doing your little crossfit Shit and run up down the

123
00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:55.040
street while I sit there and a fucking cafe getting hammered wearing my little

124
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.000
sport coat.
You know,

125
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.880
like you're fucking showing me up like I'm impressed with you and you think

126
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:03.650
you're a bad ass.
Um,
then you watch that shit.

127
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.340
You watch what fucking army rangers and all those special force people,
right?

128
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.411
I mean,

129
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:13.880
just next level fucking be the two people that Matt Damon plays in a movie.

130
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.643
You know what I mean?

131
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.730
Not The people that get applause as they trudged through the airport and their

132
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:24.080
fatigues to go sit and do a cubicle to order grenades that they're never going

133
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:24.800
to throw.

134
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.630
These are the fucking people that alias movie stars play.
Right?

135
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.580
Well this bottle here,
this is la.

136
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.870
I don't know if this is the fucking this hangover.
Right.
You know,
they,

137
00:08:36.871 --> 00:08:38.420
when they lift up that fucking log,

138
00:08:38.421 --> 00:08:40.730
those army rangers and there's like fucking 20 of them.

139
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.090
And then when somebody fucking falls over and pukes and they got to pick up

140
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:47.420
their own puke and take it outside the zone and then they're out and now there's

141
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:51.980
19 year and then he got to hold up his weight,
whatever that fucking metaphor is.

142
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.980
Oh my God.
You know,
fast.
That would be out of that pit.
How would you

143
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.790
like,
dude,
I need my back for the rest of my life.
Okay.

144
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.690
And I don't need the pressure of everybody else's defended on me and I'm the

145
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:08.190
weak link in the chain.
I understand this.

146
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:11.040
I'm barely surviving standing out here in the fucking Sun.

147
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.820
Forget about going over there and picking up a fucking telephone pole with

148
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:18.720
fucking nine other people who have the genetics of a fucking pit bull.

149
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.140
Okay.
I don't,
I'm a lapdog.
Okay.

150
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:26.430
I'm the kind of dog that could go on a plane before they had that bullshit.

151
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.910
What you could say all this thing is like helping me emotionally.

152
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.510
Um,
I dunno.
I don't even want to talk about,
does that fill up enough time?

153
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.290
Fuck nine minutes.
This is like when I'm bombing on stage and I'm like,
Oh God,

154
00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:41.230
I just got to end this set.
I got to do a half hour.

155
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.060
It's gotta be like 28 minutes,
right?

156
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:48.010
Nine minutes Hamata fucking material.
Um,

157
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.110
so anyways,
we are staying,
uh,
in the,
uh,
the,

158
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.810
if I'm going to tell what the fuck we gotta be some Weirdo,

159
00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.310
somehow we'll find me.
Ethan,

160
00:09:57.311 --> 00:10:00.220
I got to fucking sit there and answer questions about how to start a podcast in

161
00:10:00.221 --> 00:10:01.054
Paris.

162
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.560
<v 3>Excuse me.
Uh,
Mr [inaudible],</v>

163
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.360
<v 1>how you stay only Biz,</v>

164
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:16.340
Ellis d um,
anyways,

165
00:10:16.341 --> 00:10:20.770
plowing ahead.
So,
uh,
Micah Dolans to my fellow Americans right now.
Uh,

166
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.110
if you're not into baseball,
cause that's the only game in town,
Baby.

167
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.950
And don't even talk to me about the w and NBA,
NBA.
I know it's much better.

168
00:10:27.951 --> 00:10:32.030
The level of play is much better.
I understand that.
Okay.

169
00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:36.290
But that's like a,
you know,
it's very rare.
UFC did it.

170
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.210
You have Sherry,
you have seed dead,
and they went,

171
00:10:41.211 --> 00:10:44.300
not only did they start after the big four or big three really,

172
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.870
and then hockey comes along,
but when you wait,
you wait until he had Seattle.

173
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:53.240
You wait to the ad Seattle and all this fucking rain drenched lumberjacks.

174
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.600
Okay?
We're tired of all of those.

175
00:10:56.601 --> 00:10:59.720
Fucking ridiculous Harry fucking muffs up there.

176
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.930
Have another thing that they can focus their attention on.

177
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.470
You wait til the NHL is going to start nipping at the heels of a,

178
00:11:06.471 --> 00:11:10.310
I'm gonna say baseball.
I'm going to go with baseball.
All right?

179
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.590
They built a bunch of new stadiums.

180
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.880
The steroid era is over and it just sort of settling into like,

181
00:11:16.881 --> 00:11:19.430
this is what we do.
You know,

182
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.700
if I were the owners and the MLB right now,
I would say,
all right,

183
00:11:22.701 --> 00:11:27.500
we need some sort of synthetic fucking steroids.
All right?

184
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.100
We'll do it just like the pharmaceutical companies did with heroin.
Okay,

185
00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:36.101
we'll make a synthetic version of steroids and we'll just sorta leaking into a,

186
00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:36.680
I dunno,

187
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:41.090
sunflower seeds and then all of a sudden all the fucking numbers are going to

188
00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:44.780
start going up.
Right?
I mean,

189
00:11:44.781 --> 00:11:47.150
didn't you like wrestling better when everyone was on roids?

190
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.680
<v 2>Okay.</v>

191
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.530
<v 1>I mean,
if they just would just let him work a five day work week,
you know,</v>

192
00:11:51.531 --> 00:11:54.400
not work them into the ground where they fucking die.
I mean,
Roy a great,

193
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.570
aren't they at this point?
Don't they have them like it?
Like the,
you know,

194
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:02.230
like we do,
you can have like the uh,
what do they call that thing there?

195
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:06.010
The little mister there,
you know,
little weed aroma thing.

196
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:10.170
You can buy the fuck.
Do you call that thing breathalyzer?
Nah,
not a breathalyzer.

197
00:12:10.171 --> 00:12:13.180
That's for drinking and driving bill.
Um,

198
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.210
you should see what the fucking breathalyze I look like when I took it at the

199
00:12:18.211 --> 00:12:21.450
police station when I got busted for drinking driving almost 30 fucking years

200
00:12:21.451 --> 00:12:22.284
ago.

201
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:23.510
<v 2>Okay.</v>

202
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:28.090
<v 1>It looked like a fucking,
like a bag pipe in a mixed with a Douche bag.</v>

203
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.710
It's just giant rubber fucking hoes.
Do I blow into it?

204
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.310
I would just puffing up my cheeks.
Try not to blow into it cause I knew,

205
00:12:37.311 --> 00:12:38.360
I knew I had a big number.

206
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.410
I knew I had a number that even if I had an f Lee fucking Bailey,

207
00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:44.630
I wasn't getting out of it.
You know,

208
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.380
might have to have a last name like Bush,
Kennedy,

209
00:12:48.381 --> 00:12:52.370
one of those fucking royalty names,
one of those regal fucking names.

210
00:12:52.371 --> 00:12:56.120
Did everybody in England refuses to recognize that?

211
00:12:56.121 --> 00:12:58.850
Not only are they on par with the royal family,

212
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.860
I would daresay that they're a little bit beyond were taken callers.
Um,

213
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.240
by the way,
I want to thank the country of Ireland.
All right,

214
00:13:09.241 --> 00:13:13.500
but coming up with a fork and jumpers.
All right.
This thing has been the shit.

215
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.490
Late night in Paris,
walking around smoking a cigar,
you know,

216
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.610
with my stupid fucking Brian Johnson ACDC hat on.

217
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.080
I really look like the old man that I am and uh,
I'm enjoying it.

218
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.270
You know,
God,
I was thinking this morning,
laying in bed,
not being able to sleep.

219
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.620
I was thinking back to some shit when I was a kid and I was thinking like,

220
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.370
oh my God,
that's like 45 fucking years ago.

221
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.880
45 years ago was 1973 now in 1973 if I ran into a 50 year old guy and he said I

222
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:52.180
was here 45 years ago,
what year would that be everybody?

223
00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:56.770
That would be 1928 according to my couple of beers math,

224
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.170
that's how fucking old I am now.

225
00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.610
Like to a five year old kid right now.
1973 was what?

226
00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:09.410
1928 was to meet when I was five years old.
Not that I really contemplated,

227
00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:11.780
I used to think the 1950s where the olden days,

228
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.020
that's what really fucking kills me.
When I was five years old.
Sec,

229
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.530
I could still could've saw an Elvis.
Yeah.
I think he wasn't even fat yet.

230
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.940
You know?
It could have gone into Vegas and watch them treat me like,
oh Ooh,

231
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.710
[inaudible] name crew.

232
00:14:27.711 --> 00:14:32.711
Watch him sing that song for the 9,000 time that fucking week out in Vegas.

233
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.520
You know?
I think the mob killed him.
I really do.

234
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.650
He probably signed the colonel,

235
00:14:39.651 --> 00:14:42.900
probably sign up to some lifetime contract and then when he just got all fat

236
00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.410
eaten,
those peanut butter fucking banana sandwiches.
They are just like,
alright,

237
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.900
we gotta get rid of this guy.
Isn't that what happens in the,

238
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.640
does anybody like die of old age?

239
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:56.270
I know you can die of a heart attack sitting around eating all that fucking,

240
00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:01.370
you know,
was it Linguini as that's the one that's bad for you,
right?

241
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.110
It's like a fucking butter based cream sauce.

242
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.900
Jesus Christ just sitting there slurping it up,

243
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.710
having to look at the door be two seconds so nobody comes in and whack shit.

244
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.430
I've never understood it beyond the cars and the pinky rings and the great suits

245
00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:21.200
in the fucking hottest women in the fucking town.
You know,

246
00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:26.510
he can't sit down and eat a bowl of pasta without staring at the fucking door

247
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:31.250
every two seconds.
Is it really fucking worth it?
Maybe it is.

248
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.091
I Dunno.
You know,

249
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:35.330
at some point I should start taking college rather than just asking fucking

250
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:37.600
questions that float out into the fucking a bis

251
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.680
50 minutes.
That's it.
Jesus.

252
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.310
I feel like I've been fucking math class back in,
back in high school.

253
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:52.470
Oh my God.
Sine cosine,
tangent.
Just fucking flunk me.

254
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.210
<v 2>Okay.</v>

255
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.560
<v 1>That's so hard.
Well,
do we really have to go to 180 days of this shit?</v>

256
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.920
Can't you tell right from the beginning?
You don't do any scouting?
Um,

257
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.460
they didn't.
It was public schools and you know what?
It was all free.

258
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.700
It's all free,
but not now.
Not now.

259
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.480
Cause every fucking kid out there need to goddamn tablet and 15,000 other

260
00:16:11.481 --> 00:16:15.950
fucking things.
Okay.
And public schools can't afford to do that anymore.

261
00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:18.110
Now can they?
Oh,
they could.

262
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.280
They could if we weren't fighting fucking 3,500 fucking jerk offs without

263
00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:26.390
uniforms that train on a fucking jungle gym acting like that's somehow going to

264
00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:29.470
overthrow this country.
Huh?

265
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:35.150
Despite the fact we've done battle with first world nations and beat their

266
00:16:35.151 --> 00:16:35.984
asses.

267
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.390
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

268
00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.223
<v 1>Do you want to stay on that?</v>

269
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.890
This is the team that's not even in the fucking league.
This is a friendly,

270
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.590
it was sitting there acting like this is going to go up against their fucking

271
00:16:46.591 --> 00:16:47.700
record.
Unbelievable.

272
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:52.650
And meanwhile these poor fucking kids in America going to school right now and

273
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.610
we were not even decent enough with our own tax money to provide them tablets

274
00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:01.790
that they can go onto to ignore this assignments and watch when watching free

275
00:17:02.071 --> 00:17:02.970
online porn.

276
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:07.890
That's why I'm actually thinking about sending my kid to public schools because

277
00:17:07.891 --> 00:17:12.520
they can't afford any of that shit.
Right.
And then maybe my kid can,

278
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.780
can go,
you know,
actually have a childhood

279
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.410
before,
you know,

280
00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:23.150
some other fucking degenerate kid comes up and shows them God knows fucking what

281
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.680
on their phone or their tablet or the,
all of that shit.
You know what I mean?

282
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.590
I know I've talked about this shit before.

283
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.070
I know that I've said already on this podcast that I've talked about this shit

284
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:37.460
before.
I don't care if this is like,
I'm going down memory fucking lane.

285
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.290
All right.
This is my,
my,

286
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:46.320
I think this is my first podcast officially like pass the hangover of turning 50

287
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:49.350
I'm in my,
I'm in my fifties and let me tell you something.

288
00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:53.310
When you get your 50s you think you'd know shit.
What are you talking about?

289
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:54.930
You fucking little whippersnappers.
Okay.

290
00:17:54.931 --> 00:17:57.210
I've been around the block for half a fucking century.

291
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.110
You know how many times I'd been around the sun?

292
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:02.883
<v 4>MMM.</v>

293
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.330
<v 1>Without even noticing.
Somebody actually sent me that as a birthday thing.</v>

294
00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:09.840
Congratulations for like your 10000th trip around the fucking sun or something

295
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:11.250
like that.
I think it was like 10,000 right?

296
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.300
Isn't not how many times you go around the sun.
50 years.
I hope that's,

297
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:20.160
I hope I way over exaggerate just just for that person that knows the answer so

298
00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:23.990
they can feel better about themselves.
Took those and we'll be you.

299
00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:28.860
He will take two to you.
You've even really staring at her dental.
Oh really?

300
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:29.700
Oh.

301
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.430
Why don't you go fucking spew that out in a bar and see if you get any fucking

302
00:18:32.431 --> 00:18:36.510
pussy out of it.
Oh,
Bill.
Is that what it's all about?
All right.

303
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.180
<v 4>Um,
I'm having to look that up.</v>

304
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.730
<v 1>How long does it take to the earth?
Oh God.
Wait,
once a year.</v>

305
00:18:43.731 --> 00:18:46.280
It goes around the sun once a year.
It doesn't,
it.
I think I remember that.

306
00:18:46.281 --> 00:18:50.830
And I think I got that right on a science test.
All right,
here we go.

307
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.120
How long does it take for the earth to go around the sun?

308
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.070
I know this fucking thing,
right?

309
00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:02.790
It takes 24 hours for the thing to spin around and it takes a year for it to go

310
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:06.970
around.
It's visual.

311
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.650
They won't even answer me.
That's how dumb this question was.

312
00:19:09.651 --> 00:19:14.651
It immediately goes to this visualization visible is visualization shows how

313
00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.700
fast you're spinning around Earth's access.

314
00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:22.690
I don't care if I can't feel it.
Why do I want to know it?
I don't give a shit.

315
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.663
<v 4>MMM.</v>

316
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.550
<v 1>Fucking earth spinning on its axis is like eating iceberg lettuce with nothing</v>

317
00:19:29.551 --> 00:19:33.630
on it.
You know what I mean?
How does that taste?
Ah,
like,

318
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:39.060
I dunno.
Nothing how the earth moves.
Um,

319
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.020
Pluto,
this is how dumb this quite the answer's not even here.

320
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.680
Oh.
And Somehow Joe Rogan's on this.
Uh,

321
00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:51.940
this is the thing that nobody really considers you know as much about.

322
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.540
I don't even want him,
you that the fucking state I'm in right now.

323
00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:01.730
Joe Rogan,
Joe Rogan reads people.
Okay.

324
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.560
That's the podcast you're looking for.

325
00:20:03.561 --> 00:20:06.740
I suggest you go to the Joe Rogan experience.
Um,

326
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.910
I think the earth goes around the sun once a year.
I'm gonna say once a year.

327
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.420
I feel like that last family member on,
on family feud,
you know,

328
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.350
everybody can somehow scraped together for smart brothers,
sisters,

329
00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:22.880
and maybe a random cousin.
When you go,
you try to get that fifth person,
you know,

330
00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.650
it's,
it's the drop off is tremendous.

331
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:28.950
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

332
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.630
<v 1>Okay.
So what do you do?
You always stick in there.</v>

333
00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:35.631
The last fucking one and they'll just nay nay name us at type a dog,

334
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:40.080
you know?
And it'd be like,
fuck it.
Uh,
a German shepherd,

335
00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:43.260
German shepherd now,
but one you guys want to play.
Yeah.

336
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.790
Then they go to the next person and all and they fucking throw out a,

337
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.090
and it did day the day to get all the way down the fifth guy name a type of dog.

338
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.870
Uh,
uh,
it just fucking,

339
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.510
I can't even think of a dumb answer for type of dog.
That's too easy.

340
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.300
How many times zero is go around the sun.
How long does it take for?

341
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.410
Let's go around the sun.

342
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:07.920
<v 4>Uh,
Bill,</v>

343
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:12.240
<v 1>how long do you think it takes for the earth to go around the sun?
Um,</v>

344
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.990
if you get this,
you guys would be playing for all the money.
If not,

345
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.780
they drink water.
Family has a chance to steal.

346
00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:20.893
<v 4>Uh,</v>

347
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.870
<v 1>what'd he say,
Bill?
Uh,
could you,
could you repeat the question?
Uh,
yeah.
No,</v>

348
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.960
I can't.
I fucking said it four times plus.
All right.

349
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:33.460
How long does it take for the artists?
Just spin around the sun?

350
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.060
Um,
Richard,
please don't kiss me.

351
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.970
I'm going to say a year and a half.
Right.

352
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.870
Which is the dumbest fucking,
at least you know,

353
00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:47.740
you know it's a solid fucking year.
You know,
it's a round number.

354
00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:50.980
You're not going to say fucking it.
18 months.
Right.
And then,

355
00:21:50.981 --> 00:21:53.920
but then all your other four family members is there staring daggers at.

356
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:57.400
You have to fucking stand there and start clapping and say,
good answer.

357
00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:02.140
Good answer,
good answer.
And in the 40 fucking years at that show's been on,

358
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.290
nobody has ever just stared at another family member

359
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.490
and be like,
what the fuck?
What the fuck did you just say?
Oh,

360
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.670
looked at a number of family,
another family member and said,

361
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.110
I told you we shouldn't have brought this dumb fuck it has never happened.
Well,

362
00:22:18.111 --> 00:22:22.130
you know why bill?
Because it's a game show when people are having fun,

363
00:22:22.131 --> 00:22:23.490
something you don't know how to do.

364
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.493
<v 4>MMM.</v>

365
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.700
<v 1>Alright.
Hey.
You know,
I never,
I never like pre uh,</v>

366
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.440
what do you call it?
Promote a podcast coming up.

367
00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:40.270
But I've got a podcast coming up on June 28th,
uh,
the Thursday afternoon,

368
00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:42.310
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

369
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:46.900
And my guest will be none other than the one and only Dave Ilitch,

370
00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.310
uh,
one of the great drummers in the world.
And,
uh,

371
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.650
also my drum teacher and he has a new,
um,

372
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.320
drum instructional website.
Awesome.

373
00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:00.400
Fucking all of the shit that he's been showing me and everybody else.

374
00:23:00.401 --> 00:23:03.760
Everyone from my level all the way up to some of the best drummers in the world.

375
00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:08.420
And,
uh,
he's going hard on this thing and um,

376
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.960
he's going to show you guys all the shit that he's shown me.

377
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.330
So he's going to be coming on promoting that,

378
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:18.020
talking drums and all that type of stuff.
Just giving you guys a heads up.
Um,

379
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.620
because I think is a,

380
00:23:20.621 --> 00:23:24.190
I think that whole educational thing is going to be fucking insane because I

381
00:23:24.191 --> 00:23:28.370
know from firsthand experience working with that guy over the last couple of

382
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:29.730
years,
it is,

383
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:34.740
it has been a monumental shift in my playing and I'm just some fucking comedian

384
00:23:35.051 --> 00:23:37.570
that likes playing drums.
Having said that,

385
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.300
having said that,

386
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:44.080
the amount of fucking people that showed me that,

387
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:47.450
that eight year old Asian girl playing good times,
bad times,

388
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:49.850
and absolutely destroyed.

389
00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:52.230
<v 2>Okay.</v>

390
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.810
<v 1>That's one of my favorite videos of all time,</v>

391
00:23:54.811 --> 00:23:58.560
despite the fact I've been trying to play that song for 30 years.

392
00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:03.540
Just the way she attacks the kit,
the whole thing.

393
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.990
Total rocks that comes out of the field hits the crash is coming out of the

394
00:24:06.991 --> 00:24:10.260
chair.
Not only did she crush it,

395
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.490
that only did she hit the drums like a fucking monster.
Um,

396
00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:18.570
she was unbelievably entertaining and it was kids like that.

397
00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.450
They didn't have kids like that one.
I was a kid.

398
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.170
That's like some fucking youtube shit and the whole world's showing you how to

399
00:24:25.171 --> 00:24:28.530
do stuff.
I don't know what,
Oh,
maybe that's just a prodigy,
but that,

400
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.310
but it was because of kids,
you know,
gifted kids like that.

401
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.450
Why I shifted away from drums and ended up being a comedian because I would go

402
00:24:37.451 --> 00:24:40.090
into the,
you know,
not every time,

403
00:24:40.091 --> 00:24:45.091
but it felt like almost every time I would go into the local music store,

404
00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.460
you know,
before fucking guitar center was just the one,

405
00:24:48.461 --> 00:24:50.860
everybody went twice to go to a place,
a Norfolk,

406
00:24:50.861 --> 00:24:53.680
Connie Music county music on route one in Dedham,

407
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.060
I believe is where I bought my drum kit way back in the day.

408
00:24:58.061 --> 00:25:02.950
Back then when the child world was down there.
You know what I mean?
Uh,

409
00:25:02.951 --> 00:25:06.310
I forget what else was down there before toys r us fucking took over everything

410
00:25:06.311 --> 00:25:10.650
that was child world.
You went by leach mayors and fucking dead.

411
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.290
I'm all of that area right over there and a great Chinese restaurant,

412
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:15.821
the movie theater,

413
00:25:15.821 --> 00:25:19.200
all of that shit that I remember as a kid that's now fucking long gone.
I assume.

414
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.650
Um,
I would go in there and they would always just be,

415
00:25:23.651 --> 00:25:27.160
some kid would pick up something.
I get tar,

416
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.280
a Fuckin Xylophone,
a goddamn triangle,

417
00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:35.700
and would not be just sitting down going,
Duh,
Duh,

418
00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.080
Duh,
Duh,
Duh.
No,
like,
you know,

419
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.870
saying something somebody else said,

420
00:25:40.871 --> 00:25:45.871
they'd come in there and they would just start fucking playing and you could

421
00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:50.680
tell that it was coming from them.
They do.
Or if they played something,

422
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.080
they would then add,
you know,
that you'd heard on the radio.

423
00:25:53.081 --> 00:25:55.780
They would then add something,
their own little thing to it.

424
00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.810
And they just had ideas and they were creative and all that.

425
00:25:58.811 --> 00:26:01.360
And I was musically,

426
00:26:01.361 --> 00:26:04.850
I was those people outside the fucking,
uh,

427
00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.630
Lilou and standing there,
you know,

428
00:26:07.631 --> 00:26:12.130
putting my finger on top of the goddamn whatever the fuck you call it.

429
00:26:12.131 --> 00:26:15.970
The pyramid.
Well,
that was depressing.
Jesus.
Bill,

430
00:26:15.971 --> 00:26:18.160
wait a bum yourself up.
Um,

431
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.630
maybe let some of that vodka do shock a lot.
Uh,

432
00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:23.800
I apologize for my growling stomach,
by the way.

433
00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.040
It's what happens when you on a liquid diet.
Um,

434
00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.920
and then I'm going to just going to come back to the states here in about a week

435
00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:33.820
or so,
and I'll be right back on the wagon.
See,

436
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.020
that's what I can do.

437
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:40.720
I can drink like an alcoholic and then just step off the fucking wagon,
the bus,

438
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.250
whatever you call it,
the party wagon,

439
00:26:42.251 --> 00:26:45.870
and just start walking down the street like nothing happened like a fucking hit

440
00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:48.360
man.
Right?
Like Barry,

441
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.480
like bill Hader and Barry just fucking walk away like nothing happened.
Um,

442
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.560
anyway,
so let me read some of the,
uh,
advertising here for this week.
All right.

443
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.950
Um,
I have this opening note.

444
00:27:00.951 --> 00:27:04.890
The mushroom coffee dude ass that you don't say it tastes like mushrooms.

445
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.360
Other than that,
say anything.
Thanks.
Well,
that's fucking easy.
All right.

446
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:13.350
What we'll think mushroom coffee doesn't taste like mushrooms.
I like mushrooms.

447
00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:17.670
All right.
I actually had a fucking crepe today.

448
00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.910
You have a day own crepe crepe.
Wherever the fuck it is.

449
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.230
The jumbo a from us.
Uh,

450
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.740
sorry.
I apologize.
Anybody remotely French.

451
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.220
Um,
alright,
quip.
Sorry.

452
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:41.310
The truth is most of us are brushing our teeth wrong.

453
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.910
Some fine fucking stabbing yourself in the eye,
not,

454
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.530
not for long enough and forget to change our brush on time.

455
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:56.120
That's because most brands focus on selling flashy gimmicks rather than better

456
00:27:56.161 --> 00:28:00.210
brushing but not quit.
Not these fucking guys.

457
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:04.140
So what makes quip so different you may not have asked?
Well,
for starters,

458
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.450
quip is an electric toothbrush.

459
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.660
That's a fraction of the cost of a bulk of bulkier brushes while still packing

460
00:28:12.391 --> 00:28:16.710
just the right amount of vibrations to help clean your teeth,
your teeth,

461
00:28:16.711 --> 00:28:21.450
ladies,
your teeth keep the vibration above your neck there.

462
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.740
A quips built in timer helps you clean for the dentist.

463
00:28:25.741 --> 00:28:30.720
Recommended two minutes with guiding pulses that remind you when it's time to

464
00:28:30.721 --> 00:28:32.910
switch sides.
You don't even have to think anymore.

465
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:37.950
Next quips subscription plans are for your health,
not just convenience.

466
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:40.860
They deliver new brush heads on a dentist.

467
00:28:40.861 --> 00:28:45.861
Recommended schedule every three months for just $5 including free shipping

468
00:28:47.221 --> 00:28:52.221
worldwide on a dentist recommended schedule that they paid the dentist probably

469
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.910
to say sooner than you needed so they could sell more brush heads.

470
00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.730
And that's how the world works.
And God damaged quip.

471
00:28:59.731 --> 00:29:01.980
God bless you for fucking play in the game.

472
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.950
Quip also comes with a mount that's suctions right to your mirror and unsticking

473
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.210
when you break up with that chick to use as a cover for a hygienic travel,

474
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:17.130
wherever you take your teeth.
And finally,
everyone loves quip.
Everybody does.

475
00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:22.450
Everybody loves it.
They were on Oprah's all list.
Oh,

476
00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.440
press all this.
Oh,
I need a paint my mansion.
Yeah,

477
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.450
I'll fucking say you got a good toothbrush named one of Time's best interview

478
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.800
invention,
sorry.
Not An intervention.

479
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.460
And it's the first subscription electric toothbrush accepted by the American

480
00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:37.920
dental association.
I got to tell you guys,
you know what?
I love it.

481
00:29:37.921 --> 00:29:40.380
And Electric toothbrush.
Okay.
And this is some serious shit.

482
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:43.620
Is I to use the handheld ones.
I was like,
fuck electric toothbrushes.

483
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:44.500
Those things that bullshit.

484
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:49.390
And I ended up brushing my gum the way along my fucking two pipeline ended up

485
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:52.160
having,
you know,
a borderline,
uh,

486
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.850
gingivitis type of situation.
Not that,

487
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.590
what do they call it when you are receding gum?

488
00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:58.500
<v 2>Okay,</v>

489
00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.520
<v 1>whatever the fuck you call that.</v>

490
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.520
But what's great about these electric toothbrushes and you don't have to move

491
00:30:02.521 --> 00:30:05.730
back and forth.
He just put it on there.
It does all the God damn work.

492
00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:10.690
I stand by this despite all the negative shit I said,
I stand by this product.
Uh,

493
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:14.910
plus they're backed by a network of over 20,000 dentists and hygienists and

494
00:30:14.911 --> 00:30:19.660
hundreds of thousands of happy brushes,
uh,
who use quip everyday quip.
Uh Oh.

495
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:23.070
I hope they do.
Animals.
Quip starts at just $25.

496
00:30:23.071 --> 00:30:26.940

499

spelled sh I just did that.
I just spelled it out.
All right.

500
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.180
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

501
00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:51.080
<v 1>Four sigmatic mushroom coffee man.</v>

502
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.880
Four sigmatic comes from Finland.
So you know,
it's good.

503
00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.330
The uh,
the fins defeated fucking the Russians in World War Two.

504
00:31:01.331 --> 00:31:02.950
You think they can't make you a cup of coffee?

505
00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:08.470
The same crunchy that gave us Santa Claus.
Angry birds.
Tuukka Rask,

506
00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:12.640
the goaltender for the Boston Bruins and mushroom coffee finish.

507
00:31:12.641 --> 00:31:17.440
People consume more coffee per capital per capita than any other country.

508
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.380
Almost three times more than Americans.
Our right.
You know,

509
00:31:20.381 --> 00:31:22.960
I've got to get all competitive.
Uh,

510
00:31:22.961 --> 00:31:26.170
during World War II when there was a shortage of college,

511
00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:29.350
the finish boiled mushrooms that grow on trees to make coffee.

512
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.830
Mushroom coffee has half the caffeine of regular coffee,

513
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:37.030
but it's twice as magical.
I don't know why I want to drink this stuff so bad,
uh,

514
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:38.080
easy on the gut,

515
00:31:38.081 --> 00:31:42.430
less acidic and you don't get the jittery feeling you get from regular coffee.

516
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.860
It is a very snooze,

517
00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:49.530
earthy flavor with some sweet notes in there for people who drink their coffee.

518
00:31:49.531 --> 00:31:50.364
Black

519
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.133
<v 2>called</v>

520
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.590
<v 1>adaptogenic.
What about for people who liked their women black?
Well,</v>

521
00:31:56.591 --> 00:31:57.970
I enjoy the coffee a little more.

522
00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:02.380
It gives you extra energy without more caffeine or sugar.
Uh,

523
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.770
perfect for creativity.
Hey man,
let's start.

524
00:32:05.771 --> 00:32:08.890
A band helps when you need to get work done.

525
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:11.890
Think of it as supercharged instant coffee.

526
00:32:11.891 --> 00:32:16.340
That sounds like some weed people talk about comes in easy to use and carry

527
00:32:16.341 --> 00:32:20.260
single serving packets.
Just add water perfect for travel and when you,

528
00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.890
when you're on the go cause just a dollar 50 per cup,

529
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:28.990
get 15% off your first purchase with Code Burr,
how much money would that be?

530
00:32:28.991 --> 00:32:33.960
Everybody would be 15 cents in the dollar,
seven and a half on the 50 cents A.

531
00:32:33.961 --> 00:32:38.260
I would say that's 22 and a half cents out of fuck do you do then just go to

532
00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:42.800
four coffee.com and try it for yourself.
All right lastly,

533

554
00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:14.750
One of those talk talking head fucking people and one of those mindless,
oh,

555
00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:17.160
it was one of those mindless fucking youtube shows.

556
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:23.830
I forget what that show was called.
I have no idea.
Anyways.
People,
I think that's,

557
00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.440
I think I did it.
I think I did 34 minutes.
All right.
Um,

558
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:30.610
we're going to do something interesting here.
Uh,

559
00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:35.260
last week I went to the finals of Roland Garros,
Sera Patty.

560
00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.620
And um,
for those of you who didn't get to watch it,

561
00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.600
for those who've never been there alive,

562
00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:43.810
I would like to close this Thursday afternoon just before Friday,

563
00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:48.810
Monday pointing podcast with the sounds of the French Open as done by missiology

564
00:34:52.481 --> 00:34:57.010
on bear.
All right,
this is,
this is a point.
All right.

565
00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:02.140
And this is,
um,
this is the two guys there.
I forget who.
So at this point,

566
00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:07.870
all right,
here we go.
This is what it sounded like.
Serve to point.

567
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.640
<v 5>All right,
Eh,</v>

568
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.373

569
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:25.010
<v 1>oh hey.
Yay.
That one,</v>

570
00:35:25.011 --> 00:35:29.210
that miss was the drop shot that fucked up the other guy.
All right,
I'll see you.

571
00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:33.410
That's,
that's the Thursday afternoon.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Have a great weekend.

572
00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:37.980
You can enjoy the music and we've got another half hour of this of bullshit from

573
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.230
<v 6>one that I did,
I don't know while ago.</v>

574
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.083
<v 7>Yes,</v>

575
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.310
<v 6>no sleep.</v>

576
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:43.303
<v 7>Just water.</v>

577
00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.870
<v 8>Hey,
what's going on?
It's built birds.
The Monday morning podcast on Monday,</v>

578
00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:25.030
June 14th,
2010 how the hell are you?
Are you good?

579
00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.310
Did you have a good weekend?
Did you,

580
00:37:28.311 --> 00:37:32.900
did you go down to that place with the thing I heard it was nice.
Was it nice?

581
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:38.110
It is nice.
All that's nice.
My son,

582
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:42.010
he had a recital this weekend and we were so nervous.

583
00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.670
He was all flustered and more suburban.

584
00:37:45.671 --> 00:37:48.460
Talk about shit that nobody cares about.

585
00:37:48.461 --> 00:37:53.200
Chorus Frank was in the back with the garden hose.
It froze up over the winter.

586
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.810
Okay.
So we have to buy a new one of those.
So you know,

587
00:37:57.811 --> 00:38:02.160
Frank Corsi goes on the Internet and he just starts researching all about those

588
00:38:02.161 --> 00:38:06.800
hellos houses.
Okay.
I can't,
I don't know.

589
00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.940
Can you imagine just the sitting there,

590
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.440
the end of a culdesac like that is your fucking reality.
Yeah.

591
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.140
Rather than having a wine cellar,

592
00:38:15.141 --> 00:38:19.300
I would have just have a secret room of fucking porn.
Okay.
With Kleenex for me.

593
00:38:19.301 --> 00:38:23.770
The rub one out or just sit there crying at what became of my life.

594
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:28.490
Honey,
can you go out and fix his bicycle?
Okay.
No.

595
00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:33.280
Why doesn't he go climb a fucking tree?
Jesus Christ.
What did,

596
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.700
what did they do in the 18 hundreds?
You wonder why the environment so fucked up.

597
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:37.840
That's it right there everybody.

598
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:43.210
You just go want to go out and be a part of your kids' lives.
I don't,

599
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.560
that's why I told you I enjoyed condoms.
I didn't enjoy condoms.

600
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:51.610
I just didn't want to bust one in you without one on and now I did.

601
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.660
And now look at it.
Look at my face sweetheart.
Can't you see the misery?

602
00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.760
Fuck them.
Well he half looks like Yo,

603
00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:04.720
you go fix his fucking bike.
I'm not yelling.
I'm not.
No I'm not.

604
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:10.810
All right.
So this is the a,
this is the podcast for this week.
Uh,
I got to admit,

605
00:39:10.811 --> 00:39:14.590
this is like the 15th time I've tried to start it.
I don't know what's going on.

606
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:15.550
I'm in my bedroom.

607
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:20.580
It's fucking hot out cause the sun shines on this part of my apartment during

608
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:21.880
this time of the day,

609
00:39:21.881 --> 00:39:25.090
which is why usually I do this in the morning cause it's nice and cool.

610
00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:29.140
And then the podcast is cool as opposed to now where it's stressed and a little

611
00:39:29.141 --> 00:39:31.030
sweaty.
You know,

612
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:34.600
speaking of sweat and you guys been watching the NBA finals,

613
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:38.650
if you've been watching that shit,
this series,
I can't call it.

614
00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:42.190
Lakers won the first game.
And I was like,
God,
Jesus Christ said,
look,

615
00:39:42.191 --> 00:39:46.030
unbelievable.
Then the Celtics come back and I still wasn't believing in him.

616
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.670
And I was like,
you know what?
Whoever wins game three,

617
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.850
they're going to win the series that,
that's the pivotal fucking game.

618
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.270
And then the Lakers win.
And I'm like,
Oh fuck.
We're done with done.

619
00:39:56.230 --> 00:40:00.280
And the Celtics won the next game to to,
yeah,
but what the fuck?
You know,

620
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.790
Lakers or when the next one,
because that's how it's going.
And then Bam,

621
00:40:03.791 --> 00:40:07.990
the Celtics win again.
So they were up three to now logic would say,

622
00:40:07.991 --> 00:40:10.420
well they can do is win one out of two.
They're evenly matched.

623
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:14.170
They're gonna fucking do it.
But there's nothing logical about this series.

624
00:40:14.171 --> 00:40:14.570
It's been a,

625
00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:18.520
it's been a war and I hope you guys have been watching because it has been a

626
00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:22.090
classic and a people stepping up.

627
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:24.100
Not Too many bonehead mistakes,

628
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:28.750
although Laker fans might say a thing or two about Ron,
our test.
Uh,
you know,

629
00:40:28.751 --> 00:40:31.300
I could pick it,
some of my fucking players,
but you know,

630
00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:35.320
it's been a classic God damn series and usually,

631
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:40.780
usually I trashed the other team,
but I got nothing but respect for the Lakers.

632
00:40:40.781 --> 00:40:44.010
I got another mister,
they're fucking great team and a,

633
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.340
I don't know what's going to happen.
I don't have to.

634
00:40:45.341 --> 00:40:46.840
We're going to close it out the next game.

635
00:40:46.841 --> 00:40:50.380
Will we win seven games with the Lakers win the next two?
I don't fucking know,

636
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.490
but I don't understand why they can't play a game on Saturday night.

637
00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:00.010
Where does the NBA afraid of,
you know,

638
00:41:00.011 --> 00:41:04.390
we have TV vose I don't know.
I already fucking examined this shit.

639
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.980
I was just glad we swatted Pau Gasol a couple of times last night.
You know,

640
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:14.290
gave them a nice cold bucket of water to remind them of what a fucking bitch we

641
00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:18.520
think he is now.
He's been playing great.
The whole God damn series and Colby is,

642
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:23.530
is that guys that he is unfucking Gardasil the guys unguardable that third

643
00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:27.430
quarter he had gained five last night was unbelievable.

644
00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.400
You see that fucking three pointer?

645
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.100
What was he like 15 feet behind the line and at what killed me is he threw it

646
00:41:34.101 --> 00:41:37.520
like,
it looked like a shack foul shot except it went in,

647
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.200
it was like a frozen rope.

648
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.390
It was like barely any arc on the ball and there was still nothing but net.

649
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:49.160
It's like he fucking defies the laws of physics and there's a lot of people out

650
00:41:49.161 --> 00:41:53.090
there as my voice cracks a little bit because I've been screaming for seven

651
00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.150
successful shows that Caroline's this weekend.

652
00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.050
I fucking rape the crowd this weekend.

653
00:42:00.051 --> 00:42:04.010
I was in his own baby is having a great fucking time out that way.

654
00:42:04.011 --> 00:42:05.360
But let's stick with the Lakers.

655
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:10.010
People keep fucking a compare and saying,
you know,

656
00:42:10.011 --> 00:42:12.050
he's the next Jordan a isn't.

657
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:17.450
This is how you know somebody isn't the next Jordan is there compared to Michael

658
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:21.170
Jordan.
They say he's the next Jordan.
All right,

659
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:25.130
so that all that means is that you're playing at the s is is he playing at the

660
00:42:25.131 --> 00:42:30.050
same level as Michael?
Yes,
he is.
Well,
do it.
If you shaved planning shape,

661
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:34.560
fuck levels.
Michael Jordan [inaudible] each day.
Mind,
what am I going to joy?

662
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.180
I'll tell you why this is the fucking difference.

663
00:42:38.181 --> 00:42:42.330
Michael Jordan change the fucking game and I keep telling you sports Constance,

664
00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.990
and you don't fucking listen to me.
It's like you don't hear me.

665
00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.470
You don't understand.
All right.

666
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.980
It's like,
ah,
what do I say?
It's like fucking Christopher Columbus.

667
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.920
Before that guy came along,

668
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:02.630
everybody thought the world was flat and then if you sale too far,

669
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:04.220
you'd go right off the edge of it.

670
00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:10.240
But Columbus realize that it was round and there was people to be massacred on

671
00:43:10.371 --> 00:43:11.990
the other side of the fucking globe.

672
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:17.200
He realized that and he became the first fucking guy to go over where they

673
00:43:18.381 --> 00:43:20.810
didn't think,
well,
maybe come some people say the vikings,
but whatever.

674
00:43:20.811 --> 00:43:23.270
Let's just go with him getting the fucking credit.
All right.

675
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:28.300
Just so I can make my example work here now after he fucking does it,

676
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:31.880
if another guy comes along and he does it too,

677
00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.750
he sailed at the level of Columbus,

678
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:40.370
but he didn't do some groundbreaking shit,
which is what Jordan did.

679
00:43:40.371 --> 00:43:42.770
Jordan change the fucking game.

680
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:47.060
Colby is just playing the game at the same level as,
as,
as,

681
00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.010
as a Michael Jordan.
He's playing the game,

682
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:52.730
but he's not doing shit that I know that I haven't seen Michael already do.

683
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:57.140
You know?
So there you go.
That's what I'm saying.

684
00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:02.210
The same way Dr Jay Changed Basketball before Dr Jay came in the fucking league.

685
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:07.140
Everybody in the league look like basically half the league look like they put,

686
00:44:07.141 --> 00:44:10.760
they had my ability to play,
you know,

687
00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.890
and then all of a sudden he comes along and the game gets elevated above the

688
00:44:15.891 --> 00:44:20.570
fucking rim and he's doing shit and the Aba that nobody even thought about
doing.

689
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:24.980
All right.
And then everybody sees him do it and it's like,
oh,

690
00:44:24.981 --> 00:44:26.270
that's fucking possible.

691
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:31.040
And then they practice his fucking moves and now they're doing it and it becomes

692
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:31.980
part of the fucking

693
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.980
<v 9>game.
That's the difference.
Right?</v>

694
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:39.600
And before fucking Jordan came along,
everyone's like,
you got to have a center.

695
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.300
You can't win without a big man.

696
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:46.410
And Jordan was the first guy to come along and says,
you know what?

697
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:51.150
Fuck you a big man and fuck your power forward and fuck the fact that I don't

698
00:44:51.151 --> 00:44:55.260
even have a goddamn center and we do it.
He did have a center,
but the guy sucked.

699
00:44:55.261 --> 00:44:59.040
Luc Longley or Cartwright.
He's like,
fuck it.
I,
you know what?

700
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.090
I don't need any of them.

701
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.870
I'm going to jump over all of them and fucking throw it down.

702
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.710
That's what I'm doing.
Took it to the next level.

703
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:12.660
Nobody dunked the way he fucking dunked until he did it.
All that shit.

704
00:45:12.661 --> 00:45:16.560
You know what I'm saying?
So stop with this shit.
All right.

705
00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.570
But I will tell you this without a doubt.

706
00:45:18.571 --> 00:45:22.380
I think he's the most unbelievable fucking player,
uh,

707
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.470
that I've seen since Jordan,
but there's still a major gap.

708
00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:29.160
Do you know what I mean?
You guys understand what I'm trying to say here?

709
00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:33.510
It's like miles Davis changed fucking music.
Okay,

710
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.920
your buddy Billy down the street,
he plays the trumpet.
There's a difference.

711
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:40.620
He's going to play in it.
I'm not saying he's not good at playing it.

712
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.380
I'm not saying he can't play the songs that miles Davis made,

713
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.330
but he's not fucking miles Davis.

714
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:50.850
Who the fuck goes from sports to Miles Davis?

715
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:54.090
Is it any wonder this podcast is free?
Do you know?

716
00:45:54.091 --> 00:45:57.960
My Web guy told me other day I have over 250,000 downloads of my podcast.

717
00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:01.920
Not in a week.
I don't know exactly how much time or how many people.

718
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:06.480
Maybe that's,
that's 14 listeners downloading it.
58 fucking times each.

719
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:08.940
Does that come out to 250,000 I don't know what it does,

720
00:46:08.941 --> 00:46:12.030
but I was impressed and I was just thinking,
you know what?

721
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:16.800
What if I actually sold it for a buck?
A whack?
That'd be 250 grand,

722
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.470
right?
Government comes in,
Wham,

723
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:25.130
they knock it down to a buck 25 right?
Oh,

724
00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.060
maybe I can't get to keep a buck 40 of it,

725
00:46:27.061 --> 00:46:29.880
but I got to fucking throw it on the crap table.
That is Wall Street.

726
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:33.840
Then they fucking come along.
They shake up the economy like an ant farm.

727
00:46:33.841 --> 00:46:36.840
Now I'm down to 30 grand right there.

728
00:46:36.841 --> 00:46:41.190
I still got dirty granite can go on and go buy another Prius C.
Yeah,
that works.

729
00:46:41.191 --> 00:46:42.420
That's how America works.

730
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.690
Speaking of that shit home was on the plane yesterday.
Okay.

731
00:46:48.691 --> 00:46:52.740
And this fucking dude comes on,
uh,
you know,
with,

732
00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:55.890
with what I described as game seven Beo

733
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.780
one of these dudes where he walks down,
he doesn't smell,

734
00:47:03.781 --> 00:47:07.800
and then the second he goes to put his luggage into the overhead compartment.

735
00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:12.060
It's just like,
you have got to be fucking kidding me.

736
00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:15.840
How did this guy make it?
Through security,
you know,

737
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.110
I can't bring water through security,
but he can bring this,

738
00:47:19.111 --> 00:47:22.950
this fucking stench onto the planet.
Of course he fucking sits right behind me,

739
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:26.290
you know,
and I'm just like,
please just keep you fucking arms down.

740
00:47:26.291 --> 00:47:30.100
Unfortunately he did.
But it's,
those guys always get on on the cross

741
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.400
<v 8>country fucking flights.
So anyways,</v>

742
00:47:33.401 --> 00:47:37.600
there was this adorable woman next to me and uh,

743
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:38.860
she was from Australia,

744
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:43.180
had the little fucking accent and all that type of shit.

745
00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:46.040
<v 9>So what happened?
Long Story Short,</v>

746
00:47:46.041 --> 00:47:49.350
we've taken off from JFK and one of the runways is shut down.

747
00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.120
So it's taken for fucking ever right?

748
00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.990
A couple people on the plane or in wheelchairs.
So that takes more time.
You know,

749
00:47:55.991 --> 00:48:00.040
your proverbial fat fucks,
you know the whole deal.
So,
uh,

750
00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.790
we take off like an hour and a half late.
That's just the whole fuck it.

751
00:48:03.791 --> 00:48:07.910
Then the baton,
we land,
we land,
there's no gate.

752
00:48:07.911 --> 00:48:10.550
And then we got to sit there and wait to get towed into the whole thing's take

753
00:48:10.551 --> 00:48:14.190
it forever and she just does this shit where she just goes,
she says,
she goes,

754
00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:18.240
is everything in America slow?
Yeah.

755
00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:20.750
So I let it slide

756
00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:24.590
<v 8>and then the plane lands and we're all trying to see who won the Celtics and the</v>

757
00:48:24.591 --> 00:48:28.130
Lakers cause we all miss the fucking game.
Thank God ESPN showed the replay.

758
00:48:28.131 --> 00:48:32.370
I caught the second half and it goes around the plane like wildfire fire,

759
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:33.890
you know the Celtics won,
Celtics won,

760
00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:37.550
and this girl Maya Moreau was joking about how much people gives a shit and then

761
00:48:37.551 --> 00:48:40.360
this girl makes comics something,
we'll,
you know,
Americans fucking Blah,
blah,

762
00:48:40.361 --> 00:48:42.650
blah,
blah.
And it's just like,
you know what?

763
00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.520
<v 9>I let it slide with the first fucking Warren,
but it's just really like,</v>

764
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:49.440
they always talk about the ignorant American.

765
00:48:49.441 --> 00:48:53.370
What kind of a fucking asshole comes here from another country and shits on the

766
00:48:53.371 --> 00:48:58.370
country to somebody who is from this country.
When I was over in England,

767
00:48:58.371 --> 00:49:02.540
I didn't walk around saying the English people how fucking awful their torsos

768
00:49:02.541 --> 00:49:06.920
where I didn't do that.
They said,
I enjoy an England.
I'm like,
it's fucking great.

769
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:10.310
I can't believe I'm over here.
Royal Albert Hall,
it's beautiful.

770
00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:14.060
I can't wait to come over here again.
Phenomenal fucking city.

771
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:19.030
I didn't say your food sucks.
You guys all have will.
Pharrel mushy.

772
00:49:19.031 --> 00:49:21.680
Torsos I didn't say any of that shit.

773
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:23.690
I didn't talk about your teeth being fucked up.

774
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:28.410
I didn't talk about the weird inbred look because you've all been fucking each

775
00:49:28.411 --> 00:49:32.850
other and the same God damn strip of land for fucking thousands of years.

776
00:49:32.851 --> 00:49:33.840
I didn't do that shit.

777
00:49:33.841 --> 00:49:36.930
I was on my best behavior and here I am sitting next to this fucking clam.

778
00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:40.080
Is Everything in America slow as opposed to what?

779
00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:43.840
That beacon of speed that fucking Australia is

780
00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:48.960
fucking people.
You know,
I went to Australia,
I was there for like three days.

781
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.410
I had a good time down there,
but you know,
I could've picked that place apart.

782
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:58.220
All the unemployed people just sitting in bars drinking.
Okay,

783
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:04.140
<v 8>I fucking hate,
you know,
same fucking cunts.
Same Goddamn just cuts.</v>

784
00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:08.010
That's all it is.
Everybody taking pot shots in America now.
That's what it is.

785
00:50:08.011 --> 00:50:11.820
Because we've been on top and we'd been exploiting their labor and I guess maybe

786
00:50:11.821 --> 00:50:14.010
that's,
maybe we deserve a little bit of that shit.
But you know what?

787
00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:16.320
Take a look in the fucking mirror Australia

788
00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:22.030
<v 9>or woman from Australia.
The fuck I went there.</v>

789
00:50:22.031 --> 00:50:24.850
I wasn't so like wow,
like I was going into the future.

790
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.100
Can I have a and then the fucking

791
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.260
<v 8>sandwiches right in my hand before I even finish it.</v>

792
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:35.150
I didn't find them to be overly fast over there either.
You wait,

793
00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.060
you fucking wait.
You think it's not coming your way?

794
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:43.990
Our corporations are just ahead of the curve of where where your corporations

795
00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:44.561
are.

796
00:50:44.561 --> 00:50:49.561
Are corporations have basically exploited every last legal way that they can

797
00:50:49.971 --> 00:50:52.850
make more fucking money over here.
So now they're just stealing.

798
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:58.040
They're just stealing and they're cutting fucking staff members.

799
00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:02.210
I actually had to wait like a half hour,
40 minutes to get my bag last night.

800
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:07.460
I think it was that Sunday thing.
Once again,
it's Sunday,
it's Sunday,

801
00:51:07.461 --> 00:51:12.170
so we just have like a skeleton crew.
I don't know.
All I'm saying,
you know,

802
00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.660
it's just bugging me.
It's like,

803
00:51:14.661 --> 00:51:17.480
do you think I know that that shit isn't a little fucked up over here.

804
00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:22.340
Do I need you to come over here?
I would never be in Australia and go like,

805
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:26.630
yeah,
Australians to another fucking Australian,
you know?

806
00:51:26.631 --> 00:51:30.060
That's the type of shit I should feel like fucking stuffing her in a God damn

807
00:51:30.061 --> 00:51:33.710
boogie board bag.
Boogie board bag.
What did I pick that?

808
00:51:33.711 --> 00:51:38.660
Because I saw that documentary of that stupid fuck from Australia who's put 200

809
00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:43.220
pounds of fucking weed into a boogie board bag.
All right,
alliteration for you.

810
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:47.840
And then goes to like Bali,
you know with even have cold medication,

811
00:51:47.841 --> 00:51:51.660
they hang you by your balls in the public square and she gets life in prison.

812
00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:56.960
Well that's what you get.
You dumb.
Fuck.
That's what you get.

813
00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.180
That's one of my theknot fuck Australia.
That's how it works.
You see?

814
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:02.360
And that's how it works right there.

815
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.850
There's a lot of people in Australia right now.
Maybe listen to this shit gone.

816
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:08.150
You know I,
I would never say that.
I would never do that if I went.
Yeah.

817
00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.670
Well one of you did.
So there you go.

818
00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:14.450
Do you think Germany likes to be judged by Hitler alone?
They don't.

819
00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.610
I bet there's a lot of sweethearts over in Germany.

820
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.970
Look at all those fucking fat jolly people during October fest running around,

821
00:52:22.971 --> 00:52:25.730
dressed like they're in Hansel and Gretel,
you know,

822
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:29.150
shitting on each other or whatever weird fetishes they're into over there.

823
00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:33.980
All right.
What Anna just fucking bugs me.
Anyways,
it was my,

824
00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:38.420
it was my birthday this weekend.
I had a wonderful birthday.

825
00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:43.100
I did a two to a sold out shows that it's life first show was sold out.

826
00:52:43.101 --> 00:52:47.780
The second one was like 90% sold out on a Thursday by the way.

827
00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.510
And a afterwards I had a,

828
00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:55.790
I had a slice of cake and a shot of whiskey and then another shot of whiskey.

829
00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:57.980
And I'll tell you right now,
if you want to fucking hangover,

830
00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:01.520
have a slice of birthday cake with a little bit of makers and uh,

831
00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:06.080
you're going to be in business.
I was wronged me guys.

832
00:53:06.081 --> 00:53:09.440
I really fucking abused my body this weekend.
I really did.

833
00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:15.800
And I blame you.
I blame,
I blame Joe to Rosa.
I just blame him.

834
00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.870
It's just something about him,
you know,
he comes down,

835
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:23.480
he's got that stupid look on his face.

836
00:53:23.481 --> 00:53:26.910
He already has a drink in his fucking hand and you know,

837
00:53:26.911 --> 00:53:29.880
I don't want to drink with them,
but it's like,
I know he's,
I know he was adopted.

838
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:31.651
It's like,

839
00:53:31.651 --> 00:53:34.890
what am I going to be yet another person who rejects this poor bastard.

840
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:40.560
That's the only reason why I drink.
Hang on a second.

841
00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:45.300
I gotta turn the fan up.
Just fucking
all right.
Well,

842
00:53:45.301 --> 00:53:49.110
how far are we into with 16 pathetic minutes into this podcast.

843
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:54.040
This has really been a lackluster podcast and I want to apologize and I gotta

844
00:53:54.041 --> 00:53:57.120
tell you something,
guys.
I've started this thing like fucking six times already.

845
00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:01.830
And uh,
I dunno,
I'm just,
I'm off this week.
Look at me.
I'm attacking.

846
00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:05.670
I'm attacking my good friend Joe to Rosa.
You know,

847
00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:10.530
it's a good friend of mine.
Love the guy.
I respect him.

848
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.250
Even though when he sits down,
he looks,

849
00:54:14.251 --> 00:54:18.740
I look at him and he looks like he has wheelchair legs
x.

850
00:54:18.741 --> 00:54:22.080
Have you guys ever go out and you see Joe to Rosa sit at the back of a club just

851
00:54:22.081 --> 00:54:25.890
low.
When he sits down,
tell me,
it looks like his legs work.

852
00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:29.850
You know,
every time he stands up he get like that excitement.
Like you're,

853
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:33.850
you're seeing a miracle happening.
And I was a little,
see what I'm doing.
I'm,
I'm,

854
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:38.070
I'm a tech and Joe,
he's not even here to defend himself.
Ah,
Geez.
There.
Bill,

855
00:54:38.071 --> 00:54:40.170
what are you doing?
Um,

856
00:54:40.171 --> 00:54:42.740
it was my birthday this weekend and I got a lot of birthdays,

857
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:44.280
well wishes on my birthday.

858
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:48.720
I want to thank everybody and then I also got a lot of a happy belated birthday

859
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:52.680
and uh,
I really don't,
I don't enjoy that.
All right.

860
00:54:52.681 --> 00:54:56.400
If he didn't remember then fucking man up and just say,
yeah,
hey,

861
00:54:56.401 --> 00:54:59.730
I forgot your birthday.
Sorry about that.
You know,

862
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.940
I was busy in my own life or,
you know,

863
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:05.280
maybe I don't give a fuck about you enough to remember it.
Just say that.

864
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:09.240
Say happy belated birthday.
I don't like that.
That's like Merry Xmas

865
00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:14.400
taking all the fun out of it.
All right.
If you forgot my birthday,

866
00:55:14.401 --> 00:55:16.560
do you think I actually remember that?
You didn't,

867
00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:19.080
that you didn't fucking say happy birthday to me.

868
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.230
I was totally fine with whoever said happy birthday to me on my birthday and

869
00:55:25.231 --> 00:55:29.310
then,
then you,
you got to come the next fucking day.
You know,

870
00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:32.220
I'm still smiling.
I still got frosting on the side of my mouth.

871
00:55:32.221 --> 00:55:36.060
I'm having a great God damn time and you got to come up to me and wished me a

872
00:55:36.061 --> 00:55:39.420
happy belated birthday to remind me that you didn't give a fuck enough to

873
00:55:39.421 --> 00:55:43.410
fucking wish me happy birthday.
Right before you said that,
I didn't know.

874
00:55:43.411 --> 00:55:46.410
I didn't know that you didn't wish me happy birthday.
Nor did I give a shit.

875
00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:50.790
Actually looked up lady,
cause I didn't know what it meant.

876
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:56.070
I know what belated birthday means.
You miss my birthday.
Sorry about that.

877
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:58.020
But belated is one of those,

878
00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:02.850
those weird words in the English language that is used,
but it's only used then.

879
00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:08.640
Do,
do you ever hear belated at any other point during the year?

880
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.770
Jesus Christ,
look at that fucking belated pizza,
son of a bitch.

881
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:20.220
You don't.
This is like a bad 80 spit was do the word polluted.

882
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:26.690
A belated actually means later in relation to the proper time something should

883
00:56:26.691 --> 00:56:31.510
have happened.
So like when I finally get,
get like married,

884
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:36.370
connect,
connect with will I have a bladed wedding.
You know,

885
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:39.460
if a woman carries a baby for fucking 10 months,

886
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:45.580
do they have belated giving birth cards?
Jesus,

887
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:48.940
I really should be wearing a fucking 80 sports coat right now with the sleeves

888
00:56:48.941 --> 00:56:52.450
pulled up.
One of those Miami vice tee shirts underneath.

889
00:56:52.451 --> 00:56:55.570
It's spiking up what's left in my hair,
you know,

890
00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:00.640
coming up on stage to like some sort of rip off of the top gun theme.

891
00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:04.600
Bannette Dank,
Dank,
dank it.
Dan,
Dan [inaudible].

892
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:08.270
Good Evening Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the funny bone.

893
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:12.820
Um,
I wish I did stand up in the 80s.

894
00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.910
It just seems so much easier and you could,

895
00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:19.360
you could like literally do coke and go on stage and nobody had a fucking

896
00:57:19.361 --> 00:57:23.710
problem with it
could be absolutely out of your fucking mind.

897
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.900
And it was considered okay because it was the 80s.
I tell you what,

898
00:57:28.901 --> 00:57:32.860
why don't we just actually jump to the,
uh,
some of the segments that I have here.

899
00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:36.910
Let's,
let's recommend some youtube videos for the week.
Okay.

900
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:40.660
And why don't we just settle in that this isn't going to be one of the good

901
00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:41.590
podcasts.
Okay.

902
00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:45.520
Why don't we just take the pressure off me and just realize that this isn't

903
00:57:45.521 --> 00:57:48.790
going to be one of the good ones.
You know,
look at the Cohen brothers.

904
00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:53.200
Every one of their movies.
Good.
Are they,
I don't fucking know.

905
00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:56.080
I just had to pick somebody really successful.
I bet they made a bad one.

906
00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:02.260
So whatever.
This is my fucking bad one.
Uh,
kind of like a,
what's his face

907
00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:07.360
that a m night shemen lemme lemme Ding Dong,
right.

908
00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:09.340
He made the sixth sense.

909
00:58:09.341 --> 00:58:13.210
Everybody went crazy and then he made that movie where the guy takes the nap and

910
00:58:13.211 --> 00:58:17.140
the lawnmower runs over him.
You know,
they can't all be gems.
People

911
00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:22.450
look at ACDC.
My favorite band of all time,

912
00:58:22.451 --> 00:58:26.200
they make like nine good records in a row.
And then they made,
they make a,

913
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:31.570
does it blow up your video?
They had that bad period.
Fly on the wall.

914
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:37.050
Who made who
blow up your video?
Edit,
edit,

915
00:58:37.051 --> 00:58:39.030
edit,
edit,
edit,
edit.

916
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:45.430
Um,
yeah,
they,
you know what it is.
They got outside their wheelhouse.

917
00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:48.370
They were actually trying to make a statement where it's like,
no,

918
00:58:48.371 --> 00:58:52.360
you guys are ACDC.
You talk about balls,
the devil and fucking,

919
00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:53.950
okay.

920
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:58.030
Don't start making social commentary about what's happening to the art of music

921
00:58:58.031 --> 00:59:00.460
because it's going to go off the rails.
And that's exactly what happened.

922
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:05.680
Do I have,
do I actually have the nerve to try to drag ACDC into this,

923
00:59:05.681 --> 00:59:10.450
this tailspin of a podcast?
I apologize.
Fuck is wrong with me.

924
00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:16.550
Okay,
let's,
let's recommend some youtube videos for the week.
Uh,

925
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:22.430
videos or you've got to see this one look up,
a 21 foot rule,

926
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:27.410
less talk,
more action.
And it's basically,

927
00:59:27.411 --> 00:59:30.170
it's a psycho who,
um,

928
00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:34.550
and he's basically saying he's talking to gun people.

929
00:59:34.551 --> 00:59:39.440
I guess this guy is a knife soared guy and he's talking about the 21 foot rule

930
00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:43.280
that in the amount of time is going to take you to pull out a gun and I guess to

931
00:59:43.281 --> 00:59:44.960
whatever and squeeze off a shot.

932
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:49.340
He's going to close the distance and stab your cardboard,

933
00:59:49.341 --> 00:59:52.400
tow a torso.
So check that out.

934
00:59:52.401 --> 00:59:57.230
21 foot rule and a less talk,
more action.
And then,

935
00:59:57.250 --> 00:59:57.770
um,

936
00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:02.770
there's a couple of good parody once does the hundred 21 foot rule where it's a

937
01:00:02.901 --> 01:00:07.160
fat fuck doing the 21 foot rule,
21 foot rule from 121 feet.

938
01:00:07.161 --> 01:00:11.630
And then there's the 21 foot rule lightsaber.
And by the way,

939
01:00:11.631 --> 01:00:13.640
all of these,
if you don't want to search for these videos,

940
01:00:13.641 --> 01:00:15.440
if you want them ready at your fingertips,

941
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:19.430
if typing is too much of a bother because you're too busy,

942
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:24.650
all you have to do is go to the [inaudible] podcast.com.
And uh,

943
01:00:24.651 --> 01:00:27.790
all the videos will be up there and a right,
right,

944
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.000
right at the tip of your fingers.
You can select them,
you can watch them.
And uh,

945
01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:33.710
and that's what you could do.

946
01:00:33.711 --> 01:00:35.570
And I could actually come up maybe with something else.

947
01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:39.080
Good to say about the page if I wasn't so fucking off this week.

948
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:44.090
I'm just off people.
All right.
I'm fucking,
we know it built.
We know it sucks.

949
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.940
Okay,
we got it.
All right.
Here's another one to watch.
Uh,

950
01:00:46.941 --> 01:00:51.941
watch one crazy red sox fan and it's basically about a red sox fan who goes to a

951
01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:57.821
Yankees game and start serving clam chowder outside the stadium during a red sox

952
01:00:58.851 --> 01:01:01.520
Yankees game,
but only to red sox fans.
And if you,

953
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:05.270
if you just want to see what you look like when you're drunk at the game,

954
01:01:05.271 --> 01:01:10.160
just watched this video because it's pretty much equally embarrassing on both

955
01:01:10.161 --> 01:01:14.390
sides.
The level of fucking morons,
although I have to say,

956
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:19.130
uh,
a bunch of Boston CIC show their tits on it,

957
01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:21.501
but then again,

958
01:01:21.501 --> 01:01:24.410
that's because they're happy women don't show their tits when they're mad at
you.

959
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:29.000
So I guess none of the Yankee skanks showed the tits on it,
but definitely,

960
01:01:29.001 --> 01:01:30.950
definitely check that shit out.
But uh,
oh,

961
01:01:30.951 --> 01:01:35.720
here's what I should have talked about when I was talking about the Celtics

962
01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.940
Lakers.
I was talking last week about why do you,

963
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:41.660
why do we care so much about sports?
You know,

964
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:45.350
why was I on the plane flying across the country?

965
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:49.160
Absolutely livid that I wasn't going to be able to watch the game,

966
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:53.240
but part of me was relieved that when I got off the plane,

967
01:01:53.241 --> 01:01:56.720
I was just going to hear the results and know one way or the other,

968
01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:57.613
you know what I mean?

969
01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:02.690
Just get fucking one right to the back of the head rather than sitting there

970
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:06.890
slowly.
I Dunno.
Slowly getting something,

971
01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:11.960
something that slowly fucking happens.
That's funny,
right?
If you're not fucked,

972
01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.340
I'm about,
you know what?
I am fucking,

973
01:02:13.341 --> 01:02:17.240
if I fucking say one more thing that's not funny on his Goddamn podcast,

974
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:19.980
I'm going to fucking erase it.
25 minutes in,

975
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.800
which would be an unprecedented move.
Okay.

976
01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:27.270
I bail out of these things like a fucking test pilot.
Three minutes in,

977
01:02:27.271 --> 01:02:29.430
five minutes in six months,
even 10 minutes in.

978
01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:34.140
I've never been less funny for fucking 25 minutes that I'm going to scrap this

979
01:02:34.141 --> 01:02:37.500
God damn project.
This is pathetic.

980
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:41.670
This is like that fucking plane that took off like a helicopter and kept killing

981
01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:45.330
people and was so fucked up.
Even Dick Cheney finally said,
you know what?
Fuck it.

982
01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:50.400
It's not worth it.
But we spent $4 billion.
Yeah,

983
01:02:50.401 --> 01:02:53.280
but they keep fucking going in the ground like a God damn lawn dart.

984
01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:58.950
That's what's happening this week.
Fucking sweat my ass off my bedroom.

985
01:02:58.951 --> 01:03:03.690
That's what I'm saying.
I'm going to blame in a blame of climate.
All right.

986
01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:07.230
I had a little temper tantrum.
Let's talk about sports here.

987
01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.860
Why we care.
This is what you know.
I was asking last week,
why?

988
01:03:11.861 --> 01:03:15.900
Why do people give a fuck about sports?
Why do you care to this level?

989
01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:19.920
Why do you cheer on these guys?
Half of whom would blow you off if you saw him,

990
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:24.420
you know might be seen it make me seeing her,
that fucking Douche bag.

991
01:03:24.421 --> 01:03:25.890
He doesn't even smile during a game.

992
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.310
He think he's going to give you a fucking autograph as he even in the league

993
01:03:29.311 --> 01:03:31.590
anymore.
Why don't you bring up Vida Blue Bill?

994
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:36.390
There's a nice uptodate fucking reference.
Okay,

995
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.390
why we care.
This guy is a great,
great theory.
Thank God.

996
01:03:39.391 --> 01:03:41.010
I'm going to be reading somebody else's words.

997
01:03:41.011 --> 01:03:43.800
I hope he has something funny to say.
All right.
First off,

998
01:03:43.801 --> 01:03:47.400
I want to say I love the podcast.
Not after this one,
sweetheart.
Aww,

999
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:49.770
you're doing God's work anyway.

1000
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:53.880
I might not be able to explain why all sports fans care about their respective

1001
01:03:53.881 --> 01:03:54.600
teams,

1002
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:59.250
but I thought I'd tell you why I care and see if you or anyone else can relate.

1003
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.700
There are two main reasons why I not only watch sports,

1004
01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:07.701
but actually allow events that are usually happing happening nowhere near me

1005
01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:11.070
involving a bunch of people I never have,

1006
01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:16.020
nor will I ever meet affect my mood in either a positive or a negative way.

1007
01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.970
First off is the sheer unpredictability,
unpredictability of it.

1008
01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.390
Okay,
no worries.
Okay.
So,
uh,

1009
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:29.760
so you were surprised when you found out the kid in the sixth sense was already

1010
01:04:29.761 --> 01:04:33.550
dead or when Kevin Spacey started walking straight and the end of you,

1011
01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:38.190
of the usual suspects when neither of those were worth a shit compared to a guy

1012
01:04:38.191 --> 01:04:43.191
catching a pass with his helmet while being dropped on his fucking head in the

1013
01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.890
last minute of a fucking Superbowl to keep the winning drive alive.

1014
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:51.600
What a great fucking point.
That is.
A great game.
And a major sport.
Football,

1015
01:04:51.601 --> 01:04:55.770
basketball,
baseball,
and I'll even throw in hockey as a courtesy to me.
Oh,

1016
01:04:55.771 --> 01:05:00.310
thank you dude.
Thank you for,
uh,
thank you for actually thinking about me.
Um,

1017
01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:04.770
is okay.
Watching a great game in either one of those major sports is a,

1018
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.930
is for me better than the best movie or TV show.
It's the ultimate fucking drama.

1019
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.010
And as far as I'm concerned,
oh,
as far as I'm concerned,
second,

1020
01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:17.950
Jesus Christ,
I can't fucking read.
The font is too short.

1021
01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:24.070
Second,
following teams and players,
over time,

1022
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:29.230
you can see some inspiring Shit I love of this guy talks right when you think

1023
01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:32.770
he's going to be intelligent,
he starts cursing.
This sounds like my act.

1024
01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:35.530
You could see some inspiring shit.

1025
01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:40.600
This guy's really a motivational fucking dickhead.
Um,

1026
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.670
as a Yankee fan,

1027
01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:45.850
I watched Derek Jeter go from some skinny kid I'd never heard of,

1028
01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.920
to arguably the greatest shortstop of the modern error.

1029
01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:55.050
I watch Andy Pettitte go from an okay rookie to a fucking Jesus freak who did

1030
01:05:55.181 --> 01:06:00.160
steroids.
Sorry,
that was me.
Um,
go and okay.

1031
01:06:00.161 --> 01:06:04.690
Rookie to a guy who has an outside shot at the hall of fame.
Why?

1032
01:06:04.691 --> 01:06:06.520
Because he admitted that he fucking did.

1033
01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:10.300
I like how he just came out and admitted that he cheated and that makes it okay.

1034
01:06:10.301 --> 01:06:13.300
Is that all the bankers had to do?
Yeah.
Sorry.

1035
01:06:13.301 --> 01:06:16.780
We actually took all the money and now old people are eating dog food,

1036
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:19.870
so they have a chance of being in the hall of fame of bankers.

1037
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:21.940
Is that what you're suggesting,
sir?

1038
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:25.090
I really should stop heckling this because I actually agree with what he's

1039
01:06:25.091 --> 01:06:25.924
saying here.

1040
01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:30.310
So now I have to go back tiny typing on a smaller scale.

1041
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:33.100
I've seen a guy like Phil Hughes go from rookie,

1042
01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:37.690
a rookie who look overrated a couple of years ago to a guy who's tearing up the

1043
01:06:37.691 --> 01:06:38.530
league right now,

1044
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:44.020
and I'm sure for all the faggy Laker fans seeing Pau Gasol finally step,

1045
01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:49.200
finally step up and show some testicles instead of allowing the cells to punk

1046
01:06:49.201 --> 01:06:54.201
them again is inspiring on some level a watching players and teams overcome

1047
01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:55.361
these struggles.

1048
01:06:55.361 --> 01:06:59.320
Make me thinks that if these guys have it in themselves to go from just

1049
01:06:59.321 --> 01:07:04.060
believing they can achieve great things to actually doing it,
I can too.

1050
01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:07.480
Maybe it sounds corny or like it came out of a Disney movie,

1051
01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:10.240
but that's why I give us fuck about sports,
you know?
And I mean,

1052
01:07:10.241 --> 01:07:13.060
how can you argue that shit?
I mean,

1053
01:07:13.061 --> 01:07:16.390
how many times do you watch your movie and within the first 10 minutes she could

1054
01:07:16.391 --> 01:07:20.170
figure out where it's going.
You know,
there's the dude,

1055
01:07:20.171 --> 01:07:24.820
he's a fucking loser.
There's the fucking cool guy.
He's the shit.

1056
01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:28.300
He's treating the guy like shit.
He's got the hot girlfriend,

1057
01:07:28.301 --> 01:07:31.780
the loser guys actually into the toy.
You need to finish it.
G,

1058
01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:33.640
how's that one going to end?
Let me guess.

1059
01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:39.450
The fucking good looking girl finally realizes that her dick had boyfriend who

1060
01:07:39.701 --> 01:07:42.940
treats her like shit from the beginning of the movie is actually a dickhead.

1061
01:07:42.941 --> 01:07:46.660
Boyfriend dumps him and then she actually gets with this guy,

1062
01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.410
the fucking loser.
How many times do they make that goddamn movie?

1063
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:54.580
You know how many fucking movies?
All of a sudden the,
uh,
you know,
vampires,

1064
01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:57.880
they just keep movies making movies about vampires.

1065
01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.690
Don't they are TV shows where all of a sudden vampires are sexy.
Now.

1066
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:05.500
Is that what's going on?
See that?
That was a bad example.

1067
01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.470
I thought I got the podcast back on,
on fucking track.

1068
01:08:08.471 --> 01:08:09.580
That was a terrible example.

1069
01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:14.860
I went from being able to predict how a movie is going to go to talking about

1070
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:18.560
and movies that they're making a bunch of fucking vampire movies.

1071
01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:22.580
What I should be saying is that they're predictable.
Actually.

1072
01:08:22.581 --> 01:08:25.400
They are predictable.
All right?

1073
01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:29.450
Some cool new kid with a gray face is going to move to school and everyone's

1074
01:08:29.451 --> 01:08:32.240
going to look like,
it'll say the guy looks like he's fucking dead.

1075
01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:35.480
But there's something about them that everybody kind of likes and all the girls

1076
01:08:35.481 --> 01:08:35.871
pussies,

1077
01:08:35.871 --> 01:08:39.140
they're going to get wet because there's something about his extra long fucking

1078
01:08:39.141 --> 01:08:39.974
canines.

1079
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:44.840
Number six and number 11 to all you fucking dental douche bags out there,

1080
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:50.720
you know?
Then he fucking bites their neck,
sucks their blood out.

1081
01:08:50.721 --> 01:08:52.400
Then they become fucking maniacs.

1082
01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:57.800
But it takes three times and somehow that fucking whore,
you know,

1083
01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:59.540
is actually going to have a regular boyfriend,

1084
01:08:59.541 --> 01:09:03.140
but she can't resist his gray phase Douche bag with a giant fucking teeth.

1085
01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.650
She's going to bang them one other time.
She bangs.
One more time.

1086
01:09:06.651 --> 01:09:09.920
She's going to become a vampire and her boyfriend who should just say,

1087
01:09:09.921 --> 01:09:10.790
fuck that bitch.

1088
01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:14.570
If she wants to hang out with that big tooth junky cont let her become a
vampire.

1089
01:09:14.571 --> 01:09:16.730
I don't give a fuck.
For some reason he saw pussy whipped.

1090
01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:20.840
He's got to go save her and the only way to save her is to drive a stake through

1091
01:09:20.841 --> 01:09:25.070
that fucking assholes,
heart and g.
Do you think he's going to do it?

1092
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:29.420
Do you think he's somehow going to save her in the end?
Not.

1093
01:09:29.421 --> 01:09:30.650
Can you do that with sports?

1094
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.490
What is predictable in sports other than people are going to get absolutely

1095
01:09:34.491 --> 01:09:38.960
fucking hammered and that they're going to be out of shape and a,

1096
01:09:38.961 --> 01:09:41.510
that they're going to love that team when they're good and that they're going to

1097
01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:43.820
hate them when they're bad.
But as far as the outcome of the game,

1098
01:09:43.821 --> 01:09:46.550
you have no fucking idea.
You know,

1099
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:50.690
don't you think right now as a Celtics fan that I want to sit here and I want to

1100
01:09:50.691 --> 01:09:55.010
start talking shit and say that it's a wrap.
You know what?

1101
01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.680
It's never a Rep.
Look at the Bruins

1102
01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:03.650
up three games to none against the fucking Philadelphia flyers.

1103
01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.820
Go on.
And we lose,
by the way,

1104
01:10:07.821 --> 01:10:12.821
congratulations to the Chicago Blackhawks and my condolences to the flyer fans

1105
01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.720
and I'm dead serious when I say it.

1106
01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:18.170
A lot of people think that I fucking hate Philly because of that rant when in

1107
01:10:18.171 --> 01:10:19.500
reality I was,
you know,

1108
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.620
just doing a show and I was trying to piss people off from Philly.
All right.
Um,

1109
01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:27.680
that was a great thing to see,
but I got to admit,
man,

1110
01:10:27.681 --> 01:10:32.681
that was the worst winning of a championship I think I've ever seen.

1111
01:10:32.871 --> 01:10:35.090
Just for the,
just for those of you who don't watch hockey,

1112
01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:41.020
Patrick Kane in overtime and overtime goal to win the Stanley Cup.

1113
01:10:41.991 --> 01:10:46.040
He shoots the puck.
And this is really funny because people always,

1114
01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:49.880
who hate hockey to watch it on TV always say they can't see the puck.

1115
01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:54.200
This fucking guy shut the puck and it's somehow it went into the net.

1116
01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.880
It was from,
from the side.
He was almost parallel with the goal,
the goal line.

1117
01:10:58.881 --> 01:11:00.080
And he shot it in,
in,
uh,

1118
01:11:00.081 --> 01:11:04.610
disappeared into the side of the net and no one could knew where the puck was

1119
01:11:04.611 --> 01:11:08.090
except for Patrick Kane who shot it.
So he starts celebrating,

1120
01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:12.290
running down with his hands in the air,
doing the jazz hands.

1121
01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:16.650
You and all his fucking teammates are kind of like a,
well,

1122
01:11:16.651 --> 01:11:17.880
Patrick's freaking out,

1123
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:23.040
dead silence in the spectrum or wherever the fuck you guys play.

1124
01:11:23.041 --> 01:11:27.400
The Wacovia center,
dead fucking silence.
And then they,

1125
01:11:27.401 --> 01:11:31.800
the reps had to go and do a review of it and five minutes later they like,

1126
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:33.420
oh yeah,
yeah,
you won the Stanley Cup.

1127
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:36.390
And then they had to regroup and get happy again.
I was so,

1128
01:11:36.391 --> 01:11:37.740
it was such a fucking buzzkill,

1129
01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:43.110
but a congratulations to the Black Hawks and,
uh,
hey maple leaf fans.

1130
01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:46.350
Let me ask you something where you're rooting for the flyers.

1131
01:11:46.351 --> 01:11:51.351
I bet you were because now you guys are the saddest fucking sacks in the league.

1132
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.060
Isn't that right away?

1133
01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:58.590
Does it in 1967 is that the last time you guys want it?
And I believe it is,

1134
01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:03.300
but if you want it the last time in 1967 then that and then you would actually

1135
01:12:03.301 --> 01:12:06.240
be be tied with the expansion six.

1136
01:12:06.241 --> 01:12:09.120
Anybody in the expansion six who didn't win it and that will be the California

1137
01:12:09.121 --> 01:12:12.120
seals were think went on to become the Cleveland Barons,

1138
01:12:12.121 --> 01:12:14.430
but they folded so they tapped out.

1139
01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:18.270
The St Louis Blues have never want it out of the expansion.
Six.

1140
01:12:18.271 --> 01:12:21.360
Neither have the La Kings,
Minnesota north stars.

1141
01:12:21.361 --> 01:12:23.670
One is the Dallas Stars in 1999

1142
01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:30.360
penguins won it last year.
They want a two times 91 and 92 look at this.

1143
01:12:30.361 --> 01:12:35.070
Why do I have this meaningless fucking information in my head?
Flyers.

1144
01:12:35.071 --> 01:12:39.840
One at 74 75
is at six right there.
One,
two,

1145
01:12:39.841 --> 01:12:42.040
three,
four,
five,
six.
There you go.

1146
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:47.880
Look this up.
Toronto.
When I stop and just look this up.

1147
01:12:47.881 --> 01:12:49.890
God knows I'm not being fucking funny this week.

1148
01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.570
Toronto Maple leafs,

1149
01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.950
and that's actually a city I want to do a fucking standup Gig in,

1150
01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:02.640
but they never seem to fucking pony up.
And he got their money.
All right.

1151
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:07.890
1966 Stanley Cup final was the best of seven series between the Montreal

1152
01:13:07.891 --> 01:13:09.300
Canadiens trial.
Maple leafs,

1153
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:13.890
Montreal may believes when the Stanley Cup and they'd never fucking win another

1154
01:13:13.891 --> 01:13:17.220
one.
So there you go.
So now it's a threeway fucking tie

1155
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:23.400
for the longest futility in hockey.
Toronto Maple leafs,

1156
01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:27.360
the Los Angeles kings in wherever the fuck else I said,
cause I can't remember.

1157
01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.120
And the St Louis Blues

1158
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:35.970
and I'm praying all you guys don't win because the next person on that fucking

1159
01:13:35.971 --> 01:13:36.541
list is then,

1160
01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:41.541
I believe going to be the Bruins in 1970 and less Vancouver came in and like 70.

1161
01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:45.480
Is that what happened?
Calgary flames capitals.

1162
01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:49.650
They all came in the early seventies,
right?
Isn't this interesting?

1163
01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:52.560
I don't think it is.
Jesus Christ.

1164
01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:59.490
Let's go back.
Let's go.
Let's,
let's go to some questions.
Maybe will help me,
um,

1165
01:13:59.491 --> 01:14:02.400
questions for the week.
You know what,

1166
01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:04.170
I'm literally looking at the clock this week,

1167
01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:07.830
the way I do when I have a bad set and I'm looking down at my watch.
Like,

1168
01:14:07.831 --> 01:14:12.400
how many more minutes do I have to do?
How many more?
God Damn minutes.
All right.

1169
01:14:12.401 --> 01:14:15.220
Question a bill.
If you had enough money to quit,

1170
01:14:15.221 --> 01:14:20.221
stand up and had the balls to give up your dream of becoming Ernest Borgnine,

1171
01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:26.560
where would you live and what would you do with your time?

1172
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:29.230
All right,

1173
01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:33.310
I have enough money and I could quit standup and I don't want to become an
actor.

1174
01:14:33.311 --> 01:14:37.210
All right.
Uh,
where would I live in?
What would I do with my time?

1175
01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:39.790
I would live,

1176
01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:46.980
I think I'd live back east and I would live on a big piece of land where I could

1177
01:14:47.951 --> 01:14:52.810
grow my own food.
I get a pistol,
I get all the sports fucking channels.

1178
01:14:52.811 --> 01:14:54.880
I think I would live in a,

1179
01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:02.530
I dunno,
I'd want to live right outside of New York City,
one of those places.

1180
01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:06.790
Terry town or an uh,
Jersey above the wash,

1181
01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.760
George Washington breads all,
well those fucking ritzy places,

1182
01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:11.890
but out in the sticks a little bit.

1183
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:17.350
I'd lived there and I enjoy the four seasons.
They get a dog,

1184
01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:21.490
a couple of horses.
I never ride a me.
That's one of my goals in life.

1185
01:15:21.491 --> 01:15:25.120
I want to get a couple of horses in a and I want them never to be returned and

1186
01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:27.760
their lives,
you know,

1187
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.110
after I found out what you have to do to make a fucking horse want to be
written,

1188
01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:36.700
you got to break them
the same way they break those fucking,

1189
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:42.300
those people who work at hardware stores in slash terrorists down in Guantanamo

1190
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:46.930
Bay.
You know,
you got to do that to a fucking horse.

1191
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:51.580
And even then the horse,
she never quite,
cause I,
I,
I noticed a couple of the,

1192
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.810
one or two times I've written a horse,
they still kind of are rebellious.

1193
01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:57.520
They do shit.

1194
01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:01.060
Like a friend of mine actually used to work with horses and said when you go to

1195
01:16:01.061 --> 01:16:05.110
put the saddle on him,
you got to tug it real.
You got to tug the belt underneath.

1196
01:16:05.111 --> 01:16:06.160
You got to Tuck it real tight.

1197
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:10.900
Cause what they'll do is they'll take a big inhale,
all right?

1198
01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:11.810
And then when you go to,

1199
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:14.260
and then you tie it on and then when you go to get on top of it,

1200
01:16:14.261 --> 01:16:18.610
they exhale on the saddle slides down.
You fall off the fucking horse.
I mean,

1201
01:16:18.611 --> 01:16:22.000
right.
If my,
if I ever had a horse than it ever did,
that shit right there.

1202
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.710
I would look into,
it's big brown,
beautiful horse size and I would be like,
you,

1203
01:16:26.711 --> 01:16:30.370
you don't want to be written,
do you?
You know?
Well then that's it.

1204
01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.480
It's fucking over.
It's fucking over.
I'm not writing anymore.
All right,

1205
01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:40.360
go ahead.
Go run around and it's fenced in area and don't fucking complain.

1206
01:16:40.361 --> 01:16:44.830
I'm fenced into
this areas I can't go to.

1207
01:16:44.831 --> 01:16:48.730
I can't just cross borders you everything I fucked up.

1208
01:16:48.731 --> 01:16:52.720
That is with like countries and that type of shit.
How just where you're born,

1209
01:16:52.721 --> 01:16:56.350
you're just all of a sudden on that team,
you know?

1210
01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:02.620
Like,
why we're not allowed to just wander,
you know,

1211
01:17:02.621 --> 01:17:04.420
why can't I just walk to Brazil

1212
01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:11.450
like the old days and fucking go in and wash some dishes at a saloon,

1213
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:13.040
make a little bit of money,

1214
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:17.510
and then jump on a fucking stage coach and ride out of town or some bullshit,

1215
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:21.860
right?
Just fucking head down to Brazil and chill out,

1216
01:17:21.861 --> 01:17:23.480
down and you can't fucking do it anymore.

1217
01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:29.480
Got To have all these God damn identifications,
microchips and all this shit.

1218
01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:33.980
I got to worry about roving bands of fucking gorilla terrorists

1219
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:38.060
arrested a broad,

1220
01:17:38.061 --> 01:17:42.770
you guys ever seen that fucking show arrested abroad makes you like you never

1221
01:17:42.771 --> 01:17:46.760
want to travel again?
I have to tell you,
even even this last time when I went in,

1222
01:17:46.761 --> 01:17:50.690
when I went out of the country and I went to England,
Ireland and Scotland,

1223
01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:56.120
uh,
not only ridiculously white,
not only do they all speak English,

1224
01:17:56.121 --> 01:17:59.660
but I'm actually have ancestry in all those parts of the country.

1225
01:17:59.661 --> 01:18:04.661
I still couldn't quite relax until I got back on my own turf.

1226
01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:10.400
You know,
I saw a spiral.
I saw somebody with dirty toes and flip flops.

1227
01:18:10.401 --> 01:18:13.760
I was like,
America,
back fucking back.

1228
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.990
Can you do that?
And No,
you can't even,
even in like a,

1229
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:21.920
like how does that work over in Europe when you,
you know,

1230
01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:25.610
those dirty American college kids all of a sudden decided to get on a fucking,

1231
01:18:25.611 --> 01:18:28.220
I'm
like,

1232
01:18:28.221 --> 01:18:31.100
how they become dirty cause I want to do it that you get on a train,

1233
01:18:31.101 --> 01:18:34.730
just go around Europe.
How does that work?

1234
01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:38.060
Do you have to show your passport?
You'll papers?
Please do you have to do that?

1235
01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:43.250
Or You guys so advanced in the new world order that you're all in the same

1236
01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:48.020
fucking currency and you just have one DMV making you a fucking driver's license

1237
01:18:48.021 --> 01:18:49.640
with a bar code on the back.
Have you seen that?

1238
01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.810
You guys seen the new creepy commercial?
We were,

1239
01:18:53.811 --> 01:18:56.470
I don't even know what the fuck's going on.
They have a baby in the middle it,

1240
01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.171
and they have all these,

1241
01:18:57.171 --> 01:19:01.730
this electronic shit like examining every inch of the bay and that IBM

1242
01:19:01.731 --> 01:19:06.500
commercial,
the way they're selling microchipping the entire world with,
um,

1243
01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:11.060
become a smarter planet,
become a smarter planet.
Right?

1244
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:12.850
Who's gonna argue with that?
No one wants to know,

1245
01:19:12.851 --> 01:19:14.390
wants to become a dumber planet.

1246
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:18.650
Watch those commercials and read between the lines and see what the fuck they're

1247
01:19:18.651 --> 01:19:22.690
setting you up for.
They're already getting you comfortable with all the,
the,

1248
01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.960
this,
this robotic laser shit.
Looking at your,
your naked little baby.

1249
01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:30.410
They got to fucking just like a God damn dog.

1250
01:19:30.411 --> 01:19:33.350
They're going to stick a microchip right in the back of fucking Barcode,

1251
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:37.450
right on that soft part of his fucking I,
that's where they're going to stay.
The,

1252
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:39.650
this third eye soft part of his skull.

1253
01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.170
That's where they're going to bury the microchip.
Right.

1254
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:48.380
I give it one more generation and the only job that there's going to be as a

1255
01:19:48.381 --> 01:19:52.730
fucking human being other than wiping the ass of the Illuminati is to be the guy

1256
01:19:52.731 --> 01:19:57.260
who oils the fucking robots.
Other than that,
the rest of us,
we're going down,

1257
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:58.640
we're all getting processed.

1258
01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:04.090
That's my message on this happy fucking horrific car crash of a fucking podcast.

1259
01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:11.280
Um,
next question.
So that's what I do.
I would live back east and I,

1260
01:20:11.281 --> 01:20:13.500
and I would like to live on a big piece of property.

1261
01:20:13.501 --> 01:20:15.750
And I'd like to learn how to grow my own food,

1262
01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:21.330
even if I wasn't into that conspiracy theory.
Um,
type of shit.
I just,

1263
01:20:21.331 --> 01:20:25.000
uh,
there's just something about it.
I,
I think you,

1264
01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:29.190
you should know how to live off the land.
I think you should know how to survive

1265
01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.660
in the wild.
I just think that stuffed,

1266
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:35.850
I think you should know how to defend yourself.
All of this stuff.

1267
01:20:35.851 --> 01:20:39.390
I don't know how to do,
you know,
you and I know how to defend myself.

1268
01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:43.530
As you put me in a headlock,
I put you in a headlock and then we both,
shit,

1269
01:20:43.531 --> 01:20:46.560
they're tugging on each other going quit.
You quit,
you quit first.

1270
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:49.530
Like that's all I know how to do,
you know,

1271
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.580
sit on your chest and fucking punch you.
That's,
I know how to do that.
I,

1272
01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:55.980
if you're my little brother,
I know how to beat you up.
Um,

1273
01:20:56.730 --> 01:20:59.840
I don't know how to survive in the wild.
I was actually on the,
uh,

1274
01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:03.240
the Internet the other day and I was trying to learn how to hot wire a car and

1275
01:21:03.241 --> 01:21:07.080
pick a luck just in case,
just in case this shit happens.

1276
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:12.590
And I'm that guy running around with cargo pants and a backpack like that

1277
01:21:12.841 --> 01:21:16.200
fucking show.
They have you seen that show after the apocalypse?

1278
01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:22.140
The guy goes through the garbage and he somehow finds,
you know,

1279
01:21:22.141 --> 01:21:24.960
stuff to eat and how to start a fire.
I don't know how to do any of that shit.

1280
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.890
I want to learn how to do that shit so I don't take the coward way up and just

1281
01:21:28.891 --> 01:21:32.400
kill myself.
You know,
a lot of people have that as a plan.
That's it.

1282
01:21:32.401 --> 01:21:36.900
Back I put up off,
shit goes down.
I'll just kill myself,
you know?
Next.

1283
01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:39.990
Next problem.
All right,
next question.
Here we go.
Dear Bill,

1284
01:21:39.991 --> 01:21:42.720
I'm 19 and I do stand up in New York City.
Well,

1285
01:21:42.721 --> 01:21:44.280
at least I didn't until I ran out of money,

1286
01:21:44.281 --> 01:21:48.590
paying for all the open mikes and transportation of Troy.

1287
01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:53.960
Show him yearning here of trying to get a job to pay for what I love doing.

1288
01:21:55.530 --> 01:21:58.200
Sounds like a plan.
Right?
Absolutely.
Sounds like a plan.

1289
01:21:58.201 --> 01:22:02.340
But of course the shit will eventually hit the fan.
Uh,

1290
01:22:02.341 --> 01:22:03.600
in about a month and a half,

1291
01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:08.220
my mom is going to move back to New England and I'm definitely not going back

1292
01:22:08.221 --> 01:22:10.440
because one that shit sucks.

1293
01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:14.630
And to New York is the best place to do standup everyday.

1294
01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:18.810
My mom and my older brother give me shit for every little thing every day.

1295
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:23.370
My uh,
what,
sorry,

1296
01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.750
my fucking,
I just jumped the line.

1297
01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:30.060
I'm trying to get a job but I look like a hippie.
So that shit ain't easy.

1298
01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:34.980
Oh,
everyday my mom and older brother give me shit for every little thing I do.

1299
01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:39.780
I'm trying to get a job but I look like a hippie so that shit ain't easy.

1300
01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:42.960
Um,
now for the part that leaves me make,

1301
01:22:42.961 --> 01:22:47.670
making at least be looking at it like a pussy.
I feel like no matter what I do,

1302
01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:48.750
I'm wasting time.

1303
01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:54.050
I should do stand up every night and my carefree attitudes does nothing but piss

1304
01:22:54.301 --> 01:22:58.350
off the stressed out bastards in my house.
If you were in this situation,

1305
01:22:58.351 --> 01:23:00.540
what would you do?
A well,

1306
01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:03.870
you didn't give me enough of your situation to fully tell you.
Um,

1307
01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:09.730
I don't know how old you are.
Oh,
19.
Yeah,
19.
Uh,
what do I do?

1308
01:23:09.731 --> 01:23:11.620
I would get a fucking job.
That's what I would do.

1309
01:23:11.650 --> 01:23:16.650
I would get a job that would allow me to stay in the tristate area.

1310
01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:20.470
I would continue to do stand up down there.

1311
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:23.860
That's what I would do if you don't want to move to Boston.

1312
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:29.140
But um,
you know,
if you want it to move to Boston,
I mean,
that's where I started.

1313
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:33.010
I can't really comment on the scene.
The scene was great when a,

1314
01:23:33.011 --> 01:23:36.940
when I was up there and I had a day job and I did spots at night,

1315
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.420
came to work sleepy or whatever,
and I got myself to the point,

1316
01:23:40.421 --> 01:23:44.740
I just saved up a ton of money.
Um,
I could give you this advice.
Whatever you do,

1317
01:23:44.741 --> 01:23:48.190
don't get a fucking credit card and get yourself into some ridiculous debt

1318
01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.260
because that is the,
uh,

1319
01:23:50.261 --> 01:23:54.430
that's the modern day slavery is the loaning of money at interest.

1320
01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:58.840
And you need to avoid that at all fucking costs.
So what I would do,

1321
01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:02.170
get a reliable car.
All this shit requires money,

1322
01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:05.980
but I would not go out and buy a brand new fucking car,
get a job,

1323
01:24:05.981 --> 01:24:09.700
and get all this fucking debt to quote unquote build up your credit.

1324
01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:15.210
I wouldn't do any of that shit.
All right?
I would keep myself,
um,

1325
01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:21.730
I wouldn't be in a relationship,
you know,
I wouldn't,
I would,
I would keep it.
Um,

1326
01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:26.920
I keep it real light.
Travel light is what I would say travel like,
dude,

1327
01:24:26.921 --> 01:24:30.580
you're 19 years old.
You ought to be able to sleep on the sidewalk.
All right?

1328
01:24:30.581 --> 01:24:33.790
Your body is still brand new.
It's brand fucking new.

1329
01:24:33.791 --> 01:24:38.350
You don't have any aches or pains.
Do you want to stay there?
You just stay there,

1330
01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:41.980
find a fucking job,
whatever you gotta do,

1331
01:24:41.981 --> 01:24:45.290
just get a God damn job out there.
And then I would continue on.
And then,
uh,

1332
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:46.390
just think positive,

1333
01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:50.770
think positive and is bad no matter how bad it fucking gets,

1334
01:24:50.771 --> 01:24:54.400
just think this is just a funny chapter in a,
in a,

1335
01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:57.970
in a book that I'll write some day or a funny story to tell if I'm sitting on

1336
01:24:57.971 --> 01:25:00.730
the couch on Conan one day,
just look at it that way.

1337
01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:04.900
Don't listen to the negative fucks around you and uh,
just keep going.

1338
01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:05.711
That's what I would do.

1339
01:25:05.711 --> 01:25:09.250
If you want to stay in the New York area and do stand up then that's exactly

1340
01:25:09.251 --> 01:25:13.090
what the fuck I would do.
Do that.
That is my advice to you.

1341
01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:16.900
Good luck to you sir.
And I hope it all works out for you.

1342
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:18.730
And if by the time you make it,

1343
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:23.410
I've already made it and then have a fucking brutal drug habit,
uh,
helped me out,

1344
01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:28.120
trust me,
tossed me in opening gig.
I'll open for you.
Um,
all right.

1345
01:25:28.121 --> 01:25:30.520
This is one of the last things.
There's gonna be a short podcast this week.

1346
01:25:30.730 --> 01:25:34.270
I apologize.
I just don't fucking habit this week.
I really don't.

1347
01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:37.780
I got a million things on my fucking mind.
I got a bunch of bills I have to pay.

1348
01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:41.710
I got all this shit.
I'm running around,
hey,
you know,
it's fucked up.
They,

1349
01:25:41.711 --> 01:25:45.460
I got I a,
I thought it was gonna be doing Letterman again next week.
Uh,

1350
01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:48.220
I got bumped again.
I got bumped against.

1351
01:25:48.221 --> 01:25:52.420
So at least that stress is taken off.

1352
01:25:52.421 --> 01:25:57.310
It's kind of cool though,
because the set has been ready since May.
So,

1353
01:25:57.311 --> 01:25:59.800
um,
rather than the panic that I usually have,

1354
01:25:59.801 --> 01:26:03.830
usually when they asked me to do Letterman,
uh,
they call me up.
They go,

1355
01:26:03.831 --> 01:26:08.250
what do you got?
You've got five minutes ready.
And as always,
I lie and I go,

1356
01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.670
yeah,
I got five minutes clean material.

1357
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:18.040
Um,
and then I frantically tried to put it together
and,
uh,
you know,

1358
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.320
I stressful like fucking 14 days before I finally start to get it.

1359
01:26:22.321 --> 01:26:25.440
I feel like I have it and then it always ends up going well,

1360
01:26:25.441 --> 01:26:27.560
but there's an unbelievable amount of stress.
But the thing is,

1361
01:26:27.561 --> 01:26:30.780
is I already went through that bullshit in April,

1362
01:26:30.810 --> 01:26:35.780
getting ready for the beginning of May and then,
um,
you know,
then it went away.

1363
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:38.990
And then,
uh,
it started to build up again and all of a sudden June,

1364
01:26:38.991 --> 01:26:43.110
I'm ready to go and the today,
boom,
you're out.
You're fucking out.
So,

1365
01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.210
so I'm ready to go.
I don't know what the point of that fucking story was.

1366
01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:52.920
[inaudible]
okay.
You know what,

1367
01:26:52.921 --> 01:26:55.470
I just am I allowed to take a week off people?

1368
01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.180
Am I okay?
How about this?
We just,
um,

1369
01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:05.430
we just got the final copy of my new special is ready.
We,

1370
01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.430
we just locked the master or whatever they say.

1371
01:27:08.431 --> 01:27:10.590
Technically it's ready to go.

1372
01:27:10.591 --> 01:27:13.920
I got extras and one of the extras actually is the Monday morning podcast,

1373
01:27:13.921 --> 01:27:16.920
which would have been a great thing to bring up if,
uh,

1374
01:27:17.670 --> 01:27:17.940
<v 9>okay,</v>

1375
01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:21.090
<v 8>if this was actually a decent podcast,
but one of the extras is we,</v>

1376
01:27:21.091 --> 01:27:22.680
I filmed one of my podcasts,

1377
01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:26.970
I'm now the rector's is some people heckling me in a club,

1378
01:27:26.971 --> 01:27:28.140
couple episodes of that

1379
01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:33.110
<v 9>and a whatever.
The rest of it,
you'll find out when you buy the thing.</v>

1380
01:27:33.111 --> 01:27:34.760
And considering this thing is free.

1381
01:27:34.761 --> 01:27:39.740
I'm letting you guys know right now when I get an actual release date for this,

1382
01:27:39.741 --> 01:27:41.270
uh,
for the podcast,

1383
01:27:41.271 --> 01:27:46.070
I'm going to be coming at you guys hard and heavy with the guilt.
Okay?

1384
01:27:46.510 --> 01:27:50.080
And if you think you're only going to be required to buy one DVD,

1385
01:27:50.081 --> 01:27:53.440
I got news for you.
I got,
I'm going more than that.

1386
01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:57.010
<v 8>All right?
I'm not going to say how many I think you should buy,</v>

1387
01:27:58.050 --> 01:28:01.530
but it's more than one and it's less than three.

1388
01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:05.310
But I'm not going to say what that number been shaping me.
All right,

1389
01:28:05.311 --> 01:28:08.580
let's let do the last thing here.
Overrated for this week.
Overrated sprint.

1390
01:28:08.581 --> 01:28:10.890
Customer service.
I swear to God,

1391
01:28:10.891 --> 01:28:12.990
these people are just there to Piss you off bill.

1392
01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:14.820
It's like no matter what you say,

1393
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:18.420
they have some textbook come back to make you seem like an asshole.

1394
01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:22.200
How funny is that?
A what did they explain the phone and you don't get it.

1395
01:28:22.201 --> 01:28:25.290
So now you're blaming them.
Actually know what you're saying.
Um,

1396
01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:28.560
I have been with sprint for years now and I'm always bitching to them about

1397
01:28:28.561 --> 01:28:32.430
their shitty phones.
But I see,
but can you blame me?
Either the screen,

1398
01:28:32.670 --> 01:28:36.090
either the screen breaks or the fucking thing doesn't charge.

1399
01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:39.960
Like two days ago I went and yet again to get my phone looked at because when I

1400
01:28:39.961 --> 01:28:42.330
plugged in the charger,
the phone wouldn't charge.

1401
01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.850
So I bring the phone up and the charger,

1402
01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:48.540
I bring the phone and the charger up into the store and the Douche bag behind

1403
01:28:48.541 --> 01:28:51.960
the counter says the charger port in the phone is bad.

1404
01:28:51.961 --> 01:28:55.770
We will order you a new phone,
come back in two days and it'll be here.

1405
01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:59.430
It'll be here for you.
Keep in mind,
uh,

1406
01:28:59.431 --> 01:29:03.930
they looked at both the phone and charger.
So I say,
that's fine with me.

1407
01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:08.130
I'm ordering a phone.
Takes some time,
two days,
no,
no big deal.

1408
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:12.900
Two days later I pick up the phone and bring it home to find out the fucking

1409
01:29:12.901 --> 01:29:15.780
thing doesn't charge.
So I'm sitting here thinking,

1410
01:29:15.781 --> 01:29:18.500
what the fuck did they order me a new what?
The,

1411
01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.400
what the fuck did they order me a new phone for?

1412
01:29:21.090 --> 01:29:24.330
So I go back to the sprint store and I very calmly explained that the charger

1413
01:29:24.331 --> 01:29:28.560
was the problem the whole time.
Like I had said since the beginning.

1414
01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:33.720
So they go back and fuck around the thing some more and this comes back to me

1415
01:29:34.050 --> 01:29:38.370
and tells me that I was right.
Um,
and here's where I get pissed.

1416
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:43.400
She tells me that I need to buy the new charger myself because apparently a full

1417
01:29:44.341 --> 01:29:48.600
insurance doesn't cover accessories.
I swear to God,
I never would,

1418
01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:53.010
I would never hit a woman,
but this bitch got me so angry.
Um,

1419
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:56.760
I explained that,
that uh,
they were the ones,
they were the ones who diagnosed,

1420
01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:58.950
diagnosed the fucking problem,
not me.

1421
01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.770
They're the ones who ordered a new phone when I didn't even need one.

1422
01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:06.330
Plus I had to wait two days to find out all this to find all that shit out and

1423
01:30:06.331 --> 01:30:10.860
they still charged me $40 for the fucking thing.
No discount or anything.

1424
01:30:11.370 --> 01:30:15.810
Sorry.
Just had to vent.
Yeah.
That's one of those deals where you have to,
um,

1425
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:18.750
you have to stop talking to the person at the counter.

1426
01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:21.480
The first thing you have to do is you got to keep your temper in check.

1427
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:26.280
I did a whole segment on this about a year ago about the magic of the word

1428
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:31.310
unacceptable and whatever wisdom I learned was fleeting because I've gone right

1429
01:30:31.621 --> 01:30:34.260
back to s flipping out and screaming at people.

1430
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:39.200
And I can tell you from personal experience that that is not,

1431
01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:43.230
it's not,
does not get you to the desired results.

1432
01:30:43.231 --> 01:30:48.231
So what you should have done was say that I need to talk to somebody above you.

1433
01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:51.990
I understand you don't make these rules.
You just keep complimenting the person.

1434
01:30:52.290 --> 01:30:54.520
And he just keeps saying it's unacceptable,
unacceptable.

1435
01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:58.560
Eventually that you're going to get to the highest person in the store and what

1436
01:30:58.561 --> 01:31:01.810
they're going to do is tell you that you then have to jump through a couple of

1437
01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:04.980
fucking hoops,
email people,

1438
01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:08.370
something involving the Internet and they're all just hoping you're going to tap

1439
01:31:08.371 --> 01:31:10.320
out.
But if you never fucking tap out,

1440
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:14.370
you're going to get what you have coming to you.
That's just what they do.

1441
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:19.590
That's just how it works now.
And uh,
you know,
I don't know what to tell you.

1442
01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:22.950
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't even know what to say.

1443
01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:25.110
God knows it won't be anything funny.

1444
01:31:26.170 --> 01:31:28.650
This fucking piece of shit of a fucking podcast,

1445
01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:34.320
this fucking podcast.
Well was it was,
was a car.
Here's some questions for you.

1446
01:31:34.321 --> 01:31:36.750
This week of this podcast was a car.
What would it be

1447
01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:43.320
if it was a comedian?
Who would it be?
If it was a president?
Who would it be?

1448
01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:48.330
Go to the EMM podcast people,
the man podcast.com.
Go to that page.

1449
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:51.960
We'll have the questions up there and you could fucking send in your answers and

1450
01:31:51.961 --> 01:31:55.860
I'll read them next week.
If you want to trash me,
go right ahead.

1451
01:31:55.861 --> 01:31:56.860
I fucking deserve

1452
01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:58.710
<v 9>that.</v>

1453
01:31:58.710 --> 01:32:00.160
<v 8>You know what this is though.
This is the first</v>

1454
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:04.090
<v 9>time a podcast is really seem like work.
Usually I'm in here,</v>

1455
01:32:04.091 --> 01:32:06.580
I'm having a good time.
Maybe I'm,
I'm fucking jet lacked.

1456
01:32:07.090 --> 01:32:10.450
What if I just ran out of funny,
you know,

1457
01:32:10.451 --> 01:32:13.090
they always say that to you got to worry about that shit as a comedian,

1458
01:32:13.091 --> 01:32:15.880
you just dry up.
Maybe I'm drying up.

1459
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:19.480
I turned 42 years old and that's it.
That was the magic number.

1460
01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:25.180
First 18 years of his career,
man,
Tay,
the gay fucking just steadily improved.

1461
01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:30.380
He just kept getting better and better and better and then he hit 42 and I don't

1462
01:32:30.381 --> 01:32:34.900
know what happened.
He started regressing.
First thing he did,

1463
01:32:34.901 --> 01:32:39.160
he started doing the podcast in the afternoon.
It was hot.
He started sweating,

1464
01:32:39.161 --> 01:32:42.190
Cook and his fucking brain,
you know,

1465
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:45.370
just fucking all went downhill from there.
See right there.

1466
01:32:45.371 --> 01:32:48.070
I thought I was going to go on some sort of a riff and it just fucking ended.

1467
01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:49.270
I got nothing.

1468
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:54.270
Why would I think after 55 minutes of mental torture dead,

1469
01:32:55.181 --> 01:32:58.060
all of a sudden I was just going to pull this fucking gem out of my ass.

1470
01:32:59.350 --> 01:33:03.730
Is that what I thought was going to happen?
It didn't.
I got fucking news for you.

1471
01:33:03.731 --> 01:33:04.564
It didn't.

1472
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:08.950
My brain would just start thinking of the oil spill.

1473
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.290
Like I was going to riff on that.

1474
01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:13.750
I got nothing to say about it because I am fucking watched a second of it

1475
01:33:13.751 --> 01:33:16.720
because there's nothing I can do about it.
All right,

1476
01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:22.400
put a picture up when,
when you clog the fucking hole,
by the way,

1477
01:33:22.401 --> 01:33:26.840
if they ever going to be able to clean that up or we so in trouble that the the

1478
01:33:26.841 --> 01:33:30.040
do you realize that they actually listened to Kevin Costner.

1479
01:33:30.041 --> 01:33:33.790
Kevin Costner actually got a meeting with the government.
That's how dumb I am.

1480
01:33:33.791 --> 01:33:35.290
I don't even know what branch of the government.

1481
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:39.610
He went to Washington and he met with the government,
you know,

1482
01:33:39.670 --> 01:33:40.600
whatever the fuck he did.

1483
01:33:40.601 --> 01:33:43.930
He went into one of those buildings that's painted white and as pillars out in

1484
01:33:43.931 --> 01:33:47.530
the front and he went in there and there was fucking five old people sitting

1485
01:33:47.531 --> 01:33:51.880
there in suits and he,
you know,
he did the usual,
I didn't come here as an actor.

1486
01:33:51.881 --> 01:33:54.670
I came here as a blah blah blah.
He has got some side company

1487
01:33:57.230 --> 01:34:00.040
that I guess vacuums oil off the top of the water.

1488
01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:06.100
How did even get that meeting?
What did that well,

1489
01:34:06.101 --> 01:34:10.060
he was in waterworld.
I mean there's water right there.
Shit.

1490
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:16.000
What the fuck?
I mean he and he did fucking play odd.
John F.
Kennedy.
Actually.

1491
01:34:16.001 --> 01:34:16.750
No Sir.
He didn't.

1492
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:20.740
He played the guy investigating it while he was in contact with the president.

1493
01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:25.900
There you go.
Right there.
He fought in the civil war.

1494
01:34:27.130 --> 01:34:30.220
He fucking played baseball.
He built a Goddamn stadium.

1495
01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:33.610
What more does this guy have to fucking do to get a God damn meeting with us?

1496
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:36.670
He finger bag meg Ryan in the back of that Limo.

1497
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:42.330
What else did he do?
I can't,
I can't remember any of his fight.
I know.

1498
01:34:42.331 --> 01:34:43.210
I'm fucking all these up.

1499
01:34:43.211 --> 01:34:46.630
He was fucking with the guy from the breakfast club when they went skydive and

1500
01:34:46.631 --> 01:34:49.710
Fandango.
Hey,

1501
01:34:49.730 --> 01:34:53.500
remember that one kid who had that part in the movie and Fandango who just slept

1502
01:34:54.370 --> 01:34:58.560
in the back of the car?
The entire fucking movie.
I had my,

1503
01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:01.130
my part in date night was one level above that.

1504
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:09.920
That actor and Fandango called me and the guy for a weekend at Bernie's called

1505
01:35:09.921 --> 01:35:14.060
me to see how did you get eight lines?
Dude,
you're,
you're blowing up.

1506
01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:18.440
You fucking blowing up.
So anyways,
fucking uh,

1507
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:20.240
Kevin Costner,

1508
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:26.090
who liked Jack Nicholson is going to take forever to go bald.
You know,

1509
01:35:26.091 --> 01:35:30.260
I don't know what those guys dump on their fucking heads,
but they really,

1510
01:35:30.261 --> 01:35:33.590
they stave it off.
They really stave it off.
I,
on the other hand,

1511
01:35:33.591 --> 01:35:36.530
I'm not using any of that shit.
I'm just letting it fucking happen.

1512
01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:39.620
And then what I'm going to do is in 10 years,

1513
01:35:39.621 --> 01:35:44.621
I figured the fact that they can grow a fucking colon outside of the human body,

1514
01:35:47.241 --> 01:35:51.830
if they can fucking do that in 10 years and then take out the old one and stick

1515
01:35:51.831 --> 01:35:55.820
the new one in,
like you just got a new exhaust system,
there's no fucking way.

1516
01:35:56.630 --> 01:35:59.390
They're not going to have a cure for this shit and 10 fucking years

1517
01:36:02.150 --> 01:36:05.810
I'll just fucking pop a pill and she'll just start growing back like magic,

1518
01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:09.860
like fucking magic.
I learned that.

1519
01:36:09.861 --> 01:36:12.960
I learned that the other day when I was watching one of those shows for you know

1520
01:36:12.961 --> 01:36:17.300
it,
it's not a,
it's not out to pay.
It's your actual fucking hair.
Right.

1521
01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:21.470
And they got that 50 year old guy running his hands through his,

1522
01:36:21.471 --> 01:36:24.650
his Jay Leno head of hair now and he's going,
you know,

1523
01:36:24.651 --> 01:36:28.010
I wish I did this 10 years ago.
And it's like,
dude,
no you,
no you don't.

1524
01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:31.850
No you don't.
If you go back and look at what hair plugs look like 10 years ago,

1525
01:36:31.851 --> 01:36:34.790
sir,
you're going to say,
I'm really glad I waited.

1526
01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:39.620
It's like people are going to get their tattoos removed and then they just have

1527
01:36:39.621 --> 01:36:42.770
that permanent Indian sunburn because they fuck it up because it's new.

1528
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:45.710
Just wait a few years,
wait a few years.

1529
01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:48.920
It's all going to be great if you that's,
that's my advice for you.

1530
01:36:48.921 --> 01:36:49.754
If you can wait.

1531
01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:53.690
I had a buddy of mine who did crystal meth and a bunch of fucked up drugs and he

1532
01:36:53.691 --> 01:36:58.691
dried out his joints and had to get like hip replacement surgery at like 36 and

1533
01:36:59.031 --> 01:37:02.990
he's needed it for like six years.
And the doctor says,
just wait,
just wait.

1534
01:37:02.991 --> 01:37:06.890
Just wait.
Because when I was younger,
if you got hip replacement church surgery,

1535
01:37:06.891 --> 01:37:11.891
you were fucked unless you got it at like 60 or 70 because it only lasted for

1536
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:13.460
like 10 years.

1537
01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:17.510
And people used to die in their sixties John Wayne,

1538
01:37:17.511 --> 01:37:21.430
all of them fucking rump roast hanging out of the,

1539
01:37:21.431 --> 01:37:24.590
the fucking your anus.
He just collapsed one day.

1540
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:26.640
Just fuck.

1541
01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:31.400
That was just a rump roast and Geritol pills under and digested Geritol pills.

1542
01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:31.970
That's,

1543
01:37:31.970 --> 01:37:35.270
that's all you and you just died of that and everybody dropped in there fucking

1544
01:37:35.271 --> 01:37:39.470
sixties
but whatever I'm going,

1545
01:37:39.471 --> 01:37:43.460
I'm trying to say is you fucking,
you hip only lasted for 10 years and then,

1546
01:37:43.461 --> 01:37:46.250
then you were in a wheelchair.
Like what's his face?
Earl Campbell.

1547
01:37:46.251 --> 01:37:48.680
Earl Campbell now was in a wheelchair,
but,
uh,

1548
01:37:48.681 --> 01:37:52.970
my buddy has needed it for like five,
six,
seven years in.
And,
uh,

1549
01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:57.540
s five,
six,
seven years ago,
the doctor said of stuttering again,
said,
uh,

1550
01:37:57.570 --> 01:38:00.390
that he needed this hip replacement surgery and he's just told him if he can

1551
01:38:00.391 --> 01:38:04.040
wait,
if he could deal with the pain that,
uh,

1552
01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:07.120
the advancements that they were having,
he would be so much better.

1553
01:38:07.130 --> 01:38:10.280
And he waited and,
and seen the guy in a minute,

1554
01:38:10.281 --> 01:38:11.480
one of those friends we showed up,

1555
01:38:11.481 --> 01:38:15.260
you only went to a fucking hockey game or something and he had handicap plates

1556
01:38:15.261 --> 01:38:18.090
and I couldn't understand why.
And he's walking normally said,
oh,
I had,

1557
01:38:18.130 --> 01:38:20.490
I had hip replacement surgery and I was like,

1558
01:38:20.491 --> 01:38:23.670
when he said like six months ago and he's fucking walking around all normal,

1559
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.370
like,
get the fuck Outta here.
He goes,
yeah.
And he explained the whole thing,

1560
01:38:27.371 --> 01:38:28.900
how now they used to like,

1561
01:38:28.930 --> 01:38:33.930
just cut your whole leg open almost from my hip down to your knee and just

1562
01:38:34.011 --> 01:38:37.570
remove your entire hip.
Okay.
And like,
I dunno,
like the,

1563
01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:42.030
like half your fucking femur now.
I don't know what they do.

1564
01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:45.540
I Dunno what they do,
but it's working people.

1565
01:38:45.541 --> 01:38:48.180
Is this interesting me explaining fucking hip surgery.

1566
01:38:48.450 --> 01:38:49.980
I don't even know what I'm talking about.

1567
01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:55.280
Maybe that would have worked with the oil spill.
Okay.
Yeah,
you want,

1568
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.981
the big deal is,

1569
01:38:55.981 --> 01:39:00.981
is I like how Kevin Costner has actually has a side business that's so fucking

1570
01:39:01.671 --> 01:39:04.790
smart because if you listen to this fucking podcast,

1571
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:06.770
shouldn't I really have a side business?

1572
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:10.460
Shouldn't I have something to fall back on?
Ah,
fuck.
That's it.

1573
01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:13.300
<v 6>All right.
Go Fuck Yourself.
So I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
Have a good week.</v>

1574
01:39:13.570 --> 01:39:18.490
Don't judge me.
I'll be back next week.
Okay.
I'm an M and a couple of bad albums.

1575
01:39:18.491 --> 01:39:21.480
I heard his new ones fucking unbelievable.
All right.
See you.

1576
01:39:52.270 --> 01:39:52.420
Sure.
