00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.820
Hey,

It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

April 1st April 1st or wait a minute,

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:15.510
isn't this when everybody fools everybody look at all these fucking wires all

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.300
jammed around together.
How the fuck does this happen every week?

6
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:21.030
Well bell cause you just,
you just throw it around.

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.740
You throw are you throw around your equipment,

8
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:26.580
it gets all fucking locked together.
I'm happy.

9
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:28.790
April fool's day,
everybody,

10
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.400
we're in a month for an old Billy.

11
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:37.080
No boobs is fucking cruising along.
Four months into this fucking thing.

12
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.880
Uh,
November 24th so I don't know,
that's 120 something.
27 days,

13
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:43.950
28 days of as of today,

14
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.970
which is the longest I think I've gone since that time.
I took a year off.

15
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:52.971
So my record is 367 days since I first started boozing around 17 years old.

16
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.120
So the first 17 years of my life,
I cruised other than you,

17
00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:58.860
I snuck a beer here or there,
you know,

18
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.180
when I was in my teens because I didn't want my first beer that I ever had to be

19
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:07.650
in front of other fucking people.
I remember my dad had strose,

20
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.780
that's what he used to drink.
He had strokes.

21
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.910
I don't even know if they still make that shit.

22
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.400
He had it in the refrigerator and I would fucking,

23
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.493
<v 0>you know,</v>

24
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.070
<v 1>sneak one,
not realizing you had no idea how fucked up on my going to get.</v>

25
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.140
And I would,
I would only drink like a third of it.
And then I would,
uh,

26
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.260
I would pour the thing out,
the rest of it down the fucking sink.

27
00:01:30.261 --> 00:01:33.560
That was my big foray into everything.
Everything I've ever done.

28
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:36.080
I always stuck my toe into it like,
Ooh,
ah,

29
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.270
what bad things gonna happen.
Um,

30
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.090
so,
which is probably better for you,
you know,
longterm.

31
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.220
But,
um,
I will tell you what the,
you know,

32
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.540
going to bed sober really makes you kind of force a face.
You're a,

33
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.610
you're fucking Damon's man.
I was really thinking like,
ah,
you know,

34
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:02.210
I drink to take the edge off little stress,
you know,
it's nice.

35
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:04.970
It's nice to just have one and just fucking relax,

36
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.190
which it is hoes kid.
No,
it's fucking delicious.

37
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.670
Ah,
oh my God,
I got it.
Oh Jesus Christ.
I,

38
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.910
you know,
the amount of times I've gone,
it's starting to fade.
But you know,

39
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:21.800
these first few fucking months,
man,

40
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.150
it's been a couple of bars that I've seen and I just think like,

41
00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:27.320
especially during the day,

42
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:30.620
I just think like what would happen if I just went in there right fucking now

43
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.830
marched right in there and got a beer and a shot.

44
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.280
It just did that for the next four hours,

45
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.070
<v 0>came home.</v>

46
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.620
<v 1>Then I come home to my wife and kid at four 30 in the afternoon,</v>

47
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:44.760
hammered and then what?

48
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.703
<v 0>You know,</v>

49
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.770
<v 1>they would be looking at me like,
what,
what,
what,
what,
what?</v>

50
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.660
What do we mean fucking Angela's ashes,

51
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.550
kind of an asshole in 2019 with a wife and kid at home goes out and gets fucking

52
00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:58.870
hammered at a,

53
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.160
but I'll tell you as much as I know not to do that,
the,

54
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:06.100
the thought is definitely there,
but,
uh,
yeah.

55
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.980
So as I've mentioned a thousand fucking times,

56
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.530
and I know you guys are getting sick of this,
but I just say to you,

57
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.280
say it to you,
so I'll do it.
I'm taking this year off.

58
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.010
I'm not talking to you guys right now.
I'm talking to me.
You understand me?

59
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:19.070
You're prepping.
Cut.

60
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.690
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.120
<v 1>Well,
take a year off.
So,
um,</v>

62
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.090
which I think I'll be able to do.
No problem.

63
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:33.091
The only fucking tough day that I see between me and let's see,

64
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:37.960
I would break my record.
I want a year and two days.
November 24th,
25th,
26th.

65
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:42.160
November 20 sec seventh is when I would break my record.
Right?

66
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.840
My own personal bests.
The willpower is I'm going to the,

67
00:03:47.841 --> 00:03:51.380
I'm going to be going to the Clemson Florida state football game,

68
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.840
um,
in October and I'm going to be,
uh,
you know,
we already,

69
00:03:56.841 --> 00:03:59.510
like we have the lodging,

70
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.590
we're going to be out there for a couple of days.
Uh,

71
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.070
I'm actually trying to get a gig at Clemson,
everybody,

72
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.270
which is probably career suicide now with everybody with their hashtags,

73
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.690
flipping the fuck out and all of that shit.
Um,

74
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.580
I would love to do a Gig at like sort of a pre football rally for the Florida

75
00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:23.510
state game and uh,
I'm so fucking excited for that game,

76
00:04:23.511 --> 00:04:27.500
but I'm going to be there with,
you know,
my best friends in the world and uh,

77
00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:31.970
I know I'm going to smoke half a box of cigars.
Um,

78
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.650
I just got,
I just can't do the fucking,
oh my God.
Is that going to be hard

79
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.850
sitting on a fucking lake,

80
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.390
drinking fucking club sodas in Lima with Lyme?
Oh my God.

81
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.170
I mean,
you know,
certain times in this country you get fucking deported for that,

82
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:55.630
but whatever.
I'm going to do it.
I'll do it.

83
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.550
The one thing I do like about not boozing those,

84
00:04:57.551 --> 00:05:01.720
it's really easy to keep the fucking,
the old pasty belly at a,
at a,
uh,

85
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.850
a decent fucking level.
Um,

86
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.730
although I've noticed I've started to eat a little bad lately just because just

87
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:12.520
coming home you want to catch some sort of a something.

88
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:15.430
I'm just so used to something at the end of the fucking day that I've literally,

89
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:18.520
I started drinking root beer.
Like I'm fucking like,

90
00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:20.770
I still have a paper route was like,
I'm still nine years old.

91
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.360
Um,
so I got to watch that,
you know,

92
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.850
cause that's like hitting the crack pipe of fucking sugar.
You know,

93
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.570
it's a motherfucker man.
Like people who were like straight edge.
Like I,

94
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:38.560
I would love to sit down with somebody who's just totally straight edge and just

95
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:41.650
talk to them
about like,

96
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:44.980
can you imagine you didn't drink,
you didn't smoke.

97
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.830
And then on top of that you actually ate.
Like what?
What do they call that?
Diet?

98
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.870
The probiotic die,
whatever the fuck I was,

99
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:56.620
remember that those people actually read up on nutrition and they barely work

100
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:59.780
out and get fucking abs and shit.

101
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:02.030
You know those people.

102
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.390
<v 2>Okay.</v>

103
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.830
<v 1>Who truly they treat,</v>

104
00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:09.450
they treat their body like a fucking classic car.
You know what I mean?

105
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.790
Like you know the ones that it's just like,
dude,

106
00:06:11.791 --> 00:06:13.350
do you even drive that fucking thing?

107
00:06:13.351 --> 00:06:17.700
Like every fucking nut and bolt has been chromed.
Um,

108
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.710
it's kind of,
I've just been thinking about that going like,
wow,

109
00:06:22.711 --> 00:06:25.760
that's really what if I treated my body like that because I know I haven't,

110
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:26.603
I've treated my,

111
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.773
<v 3>you know,</v>

112
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.370
<v 1>I,
I've treated my body in the last 15 years,
like a station wagon,
you know,</v>

113
00:06:33.371 --> 00:06:34.630
the family station wagon.

114
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

115
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.990
<v 1>The fake wood paneling on the side.
That's kind of how I've,
I've done it.
So,</v>

116
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:45.530
I mean,
it's not like I've been,
you know,
you know,

117
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:47.660
back in the day when all eight went to high school in the 80s,

118
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:50.420
and I remember my buddies of mine where they go out and go buy like the used

119
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:53.930
fucking trans am that one from the late seventies with the fucking screaming

120
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.120
flaming chicken on the hood.
6.6 liter.
You don't say it on this side.

121
00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:03.890
And they did think it was always just like Carl look cool.
It sounded cool,

122
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:04.650
but it,

123
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.900
it was driven the way it was meant to be driven for fucking eight years,

124
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:13.810
nine years and now you got it.
Um,
and those things would it yeah,

125
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.440
would always end up fucking shit in the bed.

126
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:18.050
My buddies would buy him in the fucking thing would die like three months later

127
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:21.530
would need some major God damn work.
Um,

128
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.070
so anyway,
um,
I've been just sort of a

129
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.810
trying to think like that.
Like try to go more in that direction.
Like,
all right,

130
00:07:31.811 --> 00:07:34.750
what if I quit cigars are released,
reign it in,

131
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.710
or if I read a little more on nutrition,
you know,

132
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.990
what if I kept reading,
you know,

133
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.090
and I just send me,

134
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.490
what if I kept reading and every other word out of my mouth is,
you know,

135
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:54.350
I'm too fucking stupid.
Right?
Um,
I've gotten back and into like learning French

136
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.580
<v 3>and uh,</v>

137
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.700
<v 1>I'm doing really well with it now.</v>

138
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:02.960
I actually got a friend of mine that speaks French and this person will text me

139
00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:07.961
only in French and I can actually translate a lot of it now kind of psyched and

140
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:11.210
a,
I'm just going to keep doing that.
I told you I went to that,

141
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:14.900
that that private school we were trying to find,
cause a fucking,

142
00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:17.420
all the schools out here is public schools suck.

143
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.050
So now we've got to try to find a private school to go to.

144
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:22.370
<v 2>Okay.</v>

145
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.170
<v 1>And we went to this one,
um,
that I really loved.
Still love it.</v>

146
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.830
But the lady there,
you know,
they teach the kids how to speak French,
right?

147
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:35.570
Some real fucking aristocratic,
fucking a private school shit.

148
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:38.510
I said,
hey,
can the parents learn it with them?
And they're just like,
she's like,

149
00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:40.220
no,
it's,
it's too late for you.

150
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:42.790
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

151
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.520
<v 1>And I want to thank her for saying that because it really motivated me.</v>

152
00:08:45.521 --> 00:08:48.850
I just want like,
you know what?
All right,
well I'll show you fucking show you.

153
00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:51.790
I'll come out of nowhere.
It's going on.
They're taught six simple.

154
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:55.500
Say it all in fucking French.
Um,
speaking of which I,
my,

155
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.120
the love of my life,
my beautiful daughter to her first movie this week,

156
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.640
I was so excited.
You know,

157
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.660
she's all about going to the park and all of that.
I bought a pitch back matter.

158
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.560
The pitch backs you used to have as a kid,
you know,

159
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.390
you could adjust them at three if we couldn't even adjustment three different

160
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:14.910
angles.
The one I had was like sort of concave shape.

161
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.470
So if you throw it out the top,

162
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:19.290
it would give your ground or you through at the bottom,
you get a pop up.

163
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.670
If you threw it straight in,

164
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.590
it'd be like you had a friend that you were playing catch with.
So,
um,

165
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.380
I bought a killer one of those and uh,

166
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.380
I was trying to show her how to use it and she didn't get it,

167
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:35.220
so she would just run up with the ball and she hit it off the net and then turn

168
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:38.130
around and then throw it at me.
And uh,

169
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:42.300
I kind of was kind of getting her to figure out how to do that stuff.
And um,

170
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.280
<v 4>okay.</v>

171
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.150
<v 1>You know,
I know it's still,</v>

172
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:48.570
it's the toys beyond it because it's going to come back and hit and hit her.

173
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:51.270
That's what I'm worried about.
But,
uh,
I got to run the right path.

174
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.250
I already get my,
my uh,

175
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.850
one of my relatives got assist these little hockey nets and she actually goes

176
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:00.390
watch hockey.
And then like why we're watching hockey,
he like,

177
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:04.240
she's running around with the stick and the ball,
you know,

178
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.500
I'm fucking with my old niece is on the floor trying to play goal and shit.

179
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:11.610
So it's,
it's,
it's all coming together.
It's all coming together.

180
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.830
I just needed to get her a little bit taller and then I'm going to start

181
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:17.170
teaching her how to drive my fucking truck.
Um,

182
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.011
but anyways,

183
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:24.011
so I was driving around La and I saw these billboards that said Dumbo March 29th

184
00:10:26.071 --> 00:10:28.980
and I'm like,
oh my God,
they,
we,
I'm going to take my kid to a movie.

185
00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:33.160
She's big enough now.
We're going to go there,
we'll get some popcorn and candy,

186
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.640
some fucking drinks.
The whole thing is going to be great.

187
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.080
So we went over there,
you know,

188
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.010
my wife was going to come with me and then at the last second she,

189
00:10:43.011 --> 00:10:45.810
she got something she had to go do and she goes,
you just go,
you go,

190
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:50.400
this would be good,
you know,
bonding time,
daughter with a dead.
So we go there.

191
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:51.920
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

192
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.190
<v 1>And I,
you know,
and first of all,
I couldn't find the fucking movie,</v>

193
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.890
which theater we were supposed to go in.
They were all numbered,
you know,

194
00:10:57.891 --> 00:10:59.270
when you can't find your gate at the airport.

195
00:10:59.271 --> 00:11:02.540
And I fucked that whole thing up somehow.
And like,
where the fuck is this?

196
00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:04.220
He know.
And I went to therapy about my anger.

197
00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:07.770
So I'm really trying to keep it cool
and I'm just like,

198
00:11:07.771 --> 00:11:11.790
who came up with a numbering system here that I can't find,
you know,

199
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:15.360
theater number nine or whatever.
Right?
So it turns out,

200
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:19.740
because it was like the Imax Dolby surround sound fucking,

201
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.080
and I was just like,
wow,
they're going all out.
So you know,
it's hilarious.

202
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.070
I'm sitting there carrying all her stuff,

203
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:28.800
carrying the popcorn and leaving this trail of popcorn and stuff.

204
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.910
But I'm loving every second and we get in there and we have like these

205
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:37.080
individual seats that like recline.
So I sat her in the seat next to me.

206
00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:40.740
This is all dude sit next to me.
A couple of other people in our row.

207
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:42.930
We went to like the 10 30 in the morning showing right?

208
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.030
And I sit her down and I put the big box up,

209
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.940
a bag of popcorn.
Right.
You know,
she's sitting there,
you know,

210
00:11:50.941 --> 00:11:53.310
a little cute little legs,
right?
Put a right between the legs,
just,

211
00:11:53.311 --> 00:11:56.470
just sitting there and she's just eating it and she's just looking over at me

212
00:11:56.471 --> 00:11:59.860
like,
I don't know what this is,
but I,
I'm in,
I love this.
Right.

213
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.100
I'm keeping away from the candy though,
you know,
the sugar or whatever.
Right.

214
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.630
So just the salt,
right.
I mean,
what am I gonna do?
Um,

215
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.580
I have this weird thing where I'm feeding her healthy food,
but like,

216
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:11.950
also I think a kid should have McDonald's.
Like,

217
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:14.710
I'm not going to take it to that fucking level,
you know,

218
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.370
gluten free fucking pizza.
I mean,
at some point,
you know,
I don't know,

219
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:20.360
it's probably a bad thing,
but,
um,

220
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.560
whatever everybody raises their kid the way they want to.
And like,

221
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:27.550
I think you've got to have a balance of like a little more progressive shit with

222
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:31.030
also,
you know,
they fall down,
you say rub some dirt on it.
You know what I mean?

223
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.270
You don't want an animal,
but you don't want to pussy either.

224
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:36.440
You got to have that fucking,
that you gotta have,

225
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.720
you gotta raise somebody that's going to be able to go out in the world and be

226
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:45.100
able to stick up for themselves.
And I think that starts at Mcdonald's.
No,
anyway,

227
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:49.000
so we're sitting there and the coming attractions are happening,
you know,

228
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:53.450
and everything's fine or whatever.
And she's just eating the popcorn.

229
00:12:53.451 --> 00:12:57.110
Like she's just like,
like fish to water.
Like,
Oh,
I get this,

230
00:12:57.111 --> 00:13:00.120
I watched this and I eat this popcorn.
I sit in this great chair,
this is,

231
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:04.850
she's not even looking at me.
Right.
Um,
and then the movie starts

232
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.500
and it didn't even dawn,
I thought it was a cartoon.

233
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:10.180
I thought it was an animated thing.
Right.

234
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.160
I didn't fucking realize that it was live action.

235
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.980
And Tim Burton made it.

236
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.720
This was not a kids movie and it was like Pg or whatever,
which is,
you know,

237
00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:26.140
PG is a joke,
but when you got like a two year old,
you know,

238
00:13:26.141 --> 00:13:29.410
it's fucking guys like yelling at the elephants and being all mean,
you know,

239
00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:33.130
Hollywood's whole,
you know,
zoos are bad circuses or bad kind of theme.
You know,

240
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:34.870
and,
uh,

241
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:39.520
we got about fucking three minutes into it and she looked over at me and she put

242
00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:43.510
her arms up,
which means,
you know,
pick me up.
And I was like,
Oh shit.

243
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:44.470
And it was loud.

244
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:45.730
<v 2>Okay.</v>

245
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:50.630
<v 1>So I picked her up.
Um,
no,</v>

246
00:13:50.631 --> 00:13:53.570
she had talked a little bit and the guy next to me kind of looked over me like,

247
00:13:53.571 --> 00:13:56.960
what the fuck?
And I'm thinking like,
really,
dude,
we're in Dumbo.

248
00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.690
I got a little kid,
he to kids talking and then all of a sudden it puts together,

249
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.590
oh,
he's looking at me like,

250
00:14:00.591 --> 00:14:02.840
what the fuck did you bring a kid to a Tim Burton movie for?

251
00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.740
So now I put in my arms with their head buried into my neck,

252
00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:11.450
which she does when she's shy,

253
00:14:11.451 --> 00:14:13.880
when there's too many people around or she's uncomfortable.

254
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.390
And so now I'm sitting there trying to be like,
oh hey honey,

255
00:14:17.391 --> 00:14:19.010
look at the elephants,
the elephants.

256
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.270
And she's just sort of looking back at the screen.
And then,
you know,

257
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.220
going back and then after,
like,
I swear to God,

258
00:14:25.221 --> 00:14:30.221
we made maybe 15 minutes and I just whispered in her ear and I just go,

259
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.480
uh,
you want to go home to mommy?
And she just goes,
yeah.

260
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.960
It's like,
all right,
we're out of here.
So I only saw the first 15,

261
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:45.110
20 minutes of it.
Uh,
all I can tell you is Danny Devito as always crushing it.

262
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:50.090
I was loving him.
Colin Farrell was in it.
I mean,
I was in,
I was enjoying,

263
00:14:50.091 --> 00:14:52.760
it's Tim Burton,
just having a good time.
You know,

264
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:54.860
it's funny when before I went over there,
you know,

265
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:57.140
somebody was trying to say and all that I think didn't do too well on,

266
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:01.340
on fucking rotten tomatoes.
And I'm like,
well,
what the fuck?
Kind of fucking,

267
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:04.040
what do they get?
Five-Year-Old's going on rotten tomatoes,
be like,
Eh,

268
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.260
kind of a rip off of Pinocchio.
And once I got there and I look,
you know,

269
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:11.850
I dunno,
I,

270
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.440
I think when I got home was when somebody told me it was a Tim Burton movie.

271
00:15:14.441 --> 00:15:18.880
But as I was walking out,
I,
and I just was,
the whole thing felt bad.

272
00:15:18.881 --> 00:15:19.601
Like there was a fucking,

273
00:15:19.601 --> 00:15:23.390
there was a fight and this guy was punching this guy in the face.
I was like,
oh,

274
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.780
this is fucking like,
what?
Just just shit I've always watched,

275
00:15:25.781 --> 00:15:27.970
but now I've got a kid.
Then I'm like,
what the fuck?
This is kind of a,

276
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:32.110
it's kind of that going get going pretty hard here for a kid's movie.

277
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.003
I'm such an idiot.

278
00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:37.090
It wasn't until I left and I looked around and I realized that I was the all

279
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:41.140
like everybody there was like my age almost,
well now my age,
I'm fucking,

280
00:15:41.141 --> 00:15:44.590
well the guy next to me,
it was like,
he had like 10 years on me,
but,
um,

281
00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:45.880
it was all adults.

282
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.740
So a big swing and a miss for me.
And uh,

283
00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:55.940
we still at a good time.
She loved the popcorn,
you know?
Um,

284
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.880
she still says that she's walking around go movie movie,
popcorn,
popcorn or yup,

285
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.820
yup.
I go loud.
Right.
She goes loud,
loud.

286
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.050
So anyways,
uh,
I did at least get to experience that,

287
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:17.550
which is,
um,
which is pretty amazing considering,
you know,

288
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.210
this is my first kid,
um,
I've ever had,

289
00:16:21.211 --> 00:16:23.430
so I've never gotten to,
you know,

290
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:24.750
<v 2>okay.</v>

291
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.460
<v 1>I've never had a kid at this age before,</v>

292
00:16:26.461 --> 00:16:31.050
so I never got to go take him to do something like that.
Um,

293
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.750
which opened up this whole world of like,
Oh my God,
I'm going to get you.

294
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.180
Maybe she gets into sports.
I get to go to her games,

295
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.340
I get to take it a games driver,

296
00:16:38.341 --> 00:16:43.341
friends to the games and go to movies and find out what the hell she's into and,

297
00:16:44.131 --> 00:16:46.500
you know,
hang out before they become a teenager,

298
00:16:46.501 --> 00:16:50.610
at which point they need their space,
which I,
I get,
you know.

299
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.040
<v 2>Okay.</v>

300
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.330
<v 1>It kinda gave me like it like,
oh,</v>

301
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:57.620
this is a whole new chapter of this part of this ride that's going to be really

302
00:16:57.621 --> 00:17:02.300
cool because she's already stopped doing some stuff that I loved,
you know,

303
00:17:02.301 --> 00:17:04.730
but then they,
you know,
they learn how to talk better,
you know what I mean?

304
00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.590
As opposed to me.
But,
uh,
yeah,
she used to say no when you'd be like,

305
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.830
hey sweetie,
do you want a,
you want some more cereal?

306
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.940
And she put her hand out and kind of look,
put her eyebrows down.
Look the floor.

307
00:17:16.941 --> 00:17:17.330
I'd be like,
yeah,

308
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.540
<v 5>no,
no,
no.
Yo</v>

309
00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:23.640
<v 1>me.</v>

310
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.160
And they used to laugh and just sort of joke like lowly only need to say at once

311
00:17:27.161 --> 00:17:27.994
and every time we'd always,
yeah,

312
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.410
<v 5>Yo Yo yo Yo,
Yo</v>

313
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.780
<v 1>felt like I was like trying to hang a picture on the wall and she was like some</v>

314
00:17:33.781 --> 00:17:38.010
super rich person across the room.
Like that's not it.
No,
no,

315
00:17:38.011 --> 00:17:41.010
totally wrong.
So she doesn't do that anymore,

316
00:17:41.011 --> 00:17:44.730
but she does a other stuff,
you know.
Um,

317
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.730
I've gotten to do like more like interactive,
you know,

318
00:17:47.731 --> 00:17:50.640
and they're just like a baby just carrying them around like this.

319
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.650
It's like you have the hope diamond,
you're like terrified.
Now she runs around,

320
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:56.880
she falls down,
she's fine.

321
00:17:56.881 --> 00:18:00.480
I've gone swimming and shit with her and all of that stuff.
So it's,

322
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:04.950
it's really cool watching her become like a little person.
So,
um,
anyways,

323
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.970
any way you guys are telling me,
uh,
F one,

324
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:11.850
the second race of the year in Bahrain.

325
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.780
I watched that today and you know,

326
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:20.610
I'm rooting for Ferrari just because,
you know,
whenever I take on a new sport,

327
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:25.170
I can't root for the Patriots team or the,
the,
uh,

328
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.630
the Golden State Warriors,
whoever the dominant team is,

329
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:31.050
you can't just like pile on and be like,
oh,
I liked the best team.

330
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:34.830
So Ferrari obviously they're no slouches but they've just been,

331
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.930
they've been in a Rut since I've been watching.

332
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.770
I think this is my third or fourth season watching and um,

333
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.020
it's,
let's see.
Well,
let's see.
Louis wanted the,

334
00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:49.370
Nico Rosberg won it and then Louis one,
it's,

335
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.660
this is my fourth season watching,
I believe,

336
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.550
or Lewis won the last two years and Nico was Nico One the first year I watched.

337
00:18:56.551 --> 00:19:00.750
But I think I'm in my fourth season of watching this stuff and I have to be,

338
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.850
I've got to tell you this right now.
I swear to God,

339
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:07.370
watch rooting for the Ferrari team is feeling like it's,

340
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.730
it's like rooting for the Kansas City chiefs or the Toronto Maple leafs.

341
00:19:11.731 --> 00:19:16.020
The fucking,
who else?
San Jose Sharks.

342
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.830
The San Diego chargers,
those fucking teams,
that dad,
they're right there.

343
00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:24.240
They're right there and then,
fuck you
G.

344
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:26.550
I'm watching this fucking race.
And you know,

345
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.910
Lewis Hamilton did not have a good race the first time.

346
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:35.550
And you know that guy.
I really like him.
I like what he does,
but he,

347
00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:39.400
you know,
he acts like a fucking baby though when he's not winning.

348
00:19:39.401 --> 00:19:41.620
And he's always at,
Oh,
what's,
what's Botox too?

349
00:19:41.621 --> 00:19:43.980
And how come he's not helping me out?
It's like,
well,

350
00:19:43.981 --> 00:19:48.450
when you're leading the race,
you're not thinking about helping him out.
You know,

351
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.000
I never been able to like think like,

352
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:55.980
is that like how you have to be to be as good as him?
You gotta be that selfish.

353
00:19:55.981 --> 00:19:59.490
It's just really off putting as a fan to be watching that.

354
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.670
So I'm watching the race.

355
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.560
The Ferrari's have won the poll and second place and then the Mercedes,

356
00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:11.820
or in third and fourth.
All right.
I think this Charles look clerk,

357
00:20:11.821 --> 00:20:14.920
is that how you say his name?
He was on pole.
Um,

358
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.080
Vettel had a better start and uh,

359
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:22.200
I think Leclerc if somebody was having a problem with their grip around the

360
00:20:22.201 --> 00:20:23.220
first three turn turns,

361
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:28.230
didn't warm up their tires enough and a botox was breathing down in breathing

362
00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:30.900
down his fucking neck,
you know,
and uh,

363
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.990
but then one would say straightened out after a couple of fucking lapse,

364
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.050
the Ferrari's for like in control.

365
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.910
It was a really interesting race.

366
00:20:39.911 --> 00:20:43.470
So then Louis went in early and he got some soft tires and all of a sudden he

367
00:20:43.471 --> 00:20:46.980
started fucking catching up,
which made vental have to fucking,

368
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.270
but like the Ferrari's,
we're just stronger.
They would just better cars and just,

369
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:54.300
we're better today.
And then they did think this,

370
00:20:54.301 --> 00:20:56.110
they fuck the whole fucking thing up.

371
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:58.030
<v 2>Okay.</v>

372
00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:58.301
<v 1>You know,</v>

373
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:03.301
it's also punching up a fucking episode of a F is for family is I'm always

374
00:21:03.591 --> 00:21:06.860
fucking multitasking.
I don't know what happened to Vela battles front wing,

375
00:21:06.861 --> 00:21:10.520
but he fucking spins out.
But Charles law clerk and he has like a fucking,

376
00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:16.360
he had like a 25 second lead on Lewis Hamilton and he's this like 12 laps to go.

377
00:21:16.641 --> 00:21:21.530
The fucking race is over.
And I'm like,
this is great.
Okay,

378
00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:25.280
Hamilton's going to go all for two as far as winning races.
And you know,

379
00:21:25.281 --> 00:21:27.380
he's calming,
you know he's going to win is racist.

380
00:21:27.381 --> 00:21:31.040
Maybe there'll be nice and close for the rest of the fucking year

381
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.950
and no 12 labs to go.

382
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:39.330
All of a sudden Charlo shot rob my car on the fucking turbo,

383
00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:40.350
shits the bed

384
00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.150
and then you just gotta Watch fucking Hamilton run them down and then fucking

385
00:21:47.151 --> 00:21:48.730
botox passes Oma.

386
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:53.510
Now the Mercedes or in first and second they have fucking for it and they just

387
00:21:53.511 --> 00:21:57.380
fucking screwed the pooch.
And then at least,
you know,

388
00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.130
Renault was in,
was nice enough to have both their cars,
shit the bed.

389
00:22:01.131 --> 00:22:05.100
So then they,
they finished under a caution flag.
So,
um,

390
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.030
look,
clerk was,
I think,
did he,

391
00:22:08.031 --> 00:22:12.650
I think he might've stayed on the podium and Vernon Vettel was kind of in fifth

392
00:22:12.651 --> 00:22:15.770
place.
What do we got here?
Let me see what,
let me see the,
uh,
the positions here.

393
00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:20.350
I looked it up here,
fon standings I have,
and that's not what I want.

394
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:25.160
It was Lewis Hamilton,
Botox,
law clerk,
and then uh,

395
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:29.570
oh max for staffing and then Vettel so he came in fifth place.

396
00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:31.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

397
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.110
<v 1>And then here are the standings for the year.</v>

398
00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:38.660
Botox has 44 points points for Mercedes.
And then Hamilton has 43.

399
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.140
Yeah,
Max Verstappen is a 27.

400
00:22:42.141 --> 00:22:45.020
And then the Ferrari team there are 26 and 22

401
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.400
like that now I now,

402
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.460
so now you know what it is now.

403
00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:56.630
Like all I'm going to do is route for botox because I did like the racing

404
00:22:56.631 --> 00:23:01.250
between the two teammates,
botox and Hamilton.
Like fuck you dude.

405
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.240
Like I botox has done being the fucking,
you know,

406
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.820
the bridesmaid or the Goddamn gimp of that team.

407
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:12.220
And that could be really fun because that first year with Nico Rosberg and uh,

408
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.540
I hope I'm saying his name right and Lewis Hamilton.
That was,

409
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:19.370
it's like watching days of thunder the way they didn't get along.
So,

410
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.430
um,
let me get a drink of water here.
Hang on.

411
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

412
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.770
<v 1>But anyways,
when uh,
you know,
it was fucking hilarious when,
um,</v>

413
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.080
when the Hamilton passed a law clerk,

414
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:36.760
I literally gave the finger to the TV,
both fingers and I'm just like,

415
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.640
why?
Why am I mad at Lewis Hamilton?
What?
Cause he's good.

416
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.760
You know what he reminds me of?
He's like death.

417
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.790
Remember that smart kid at school had the great penmanship and always fucking,

418
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.770
you know,
did everything that you knew you should've been doing but you weren't,

419
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.520
you know,
it's like,
why?
Why am I going to hate the guy because he's fucking good.

420
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.730
Just drives me fucking nuts.
It's like,
it just,

421
00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:03.731
it takes me back to being a Boston sports fan before we started winning.

422
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.050
And it was just,
they was just like,

423
00:24:06.051 --> 00:24:09.020
how many fucking times can these cons get the call?

424
00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:13.550
How many times can just the ball just fucking bouncing to this guy's hand?

425
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:17.090
Like just getting the breaks.
Like Mercedes got really fucking lucky today,

426
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.420
or what?
I think they just a better team.

427
00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.150
I don't know what the fucking deal is with Ferrari.

428
00:24:24.151 --> 00:24:27.540
They make some of the greatest cars in history that just,

429
00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.770
I don't know.
It was frustrating.
I was really hoping,
you know,

430
00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.020
the first five get five,
six races in and,

431
00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:38.850
and Ferrari had like a nice decent lead.

432
00:24:38.851 --> 00:24:42.810
And then to watch Mercedes play catch up for once.
It's just,
you know,

433
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.640
it's just not,
it's not their time.
So we shall see.
We shall see what happens.

434
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.610
Um,
anyways,
let me see what we got here.

435
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:56.130
Andrew was asking me if I wanted to answer any more of these fucking,
uh,

436
00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:01.710
tax questions,
which I'll,
I,
you know,
I'll do it.

437
00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.470
I'll answer another one.
I don't know.
Um,

438
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.800
I just have no fucking idea.

439
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.280
How are you going to convince me that you should basically punish honest

440
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:19.140
Americans who happen to be making over $10 million a year?
Um,

441
00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.520
and the fact that she would co sign on that

442
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.080
as a fellow American to punish those fucking people and make them pay for all

443
00:25:28.271 --> 00:25:30.880
these people who don't pay any mind any taxes.

444
00:25:30.881 --> 00:25:33.100
All these corporations that don't pay any taxes,

445
00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:38.290
all these corporations that fucking drag us into these never ending fucking
wars.

446
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:43.120
Never ending fucking wars and make a fucking fortune.

447
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.010
<v 2>Okay,</v>

448
00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:46.690
<v 1>author the death and destruction,</v>

449
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.360
and that's all a separate issue.
It's all a fucking separate issue.

450
00:25:52.361 --> 00:25:53.890
And you know what?
You know what?

451
00:25:53.891 --> 00:25:57.070
We can fucking tax these people because they actually report their fucking

452
00:25:57.071 --> 00:26:01.270
income.
So God damn it,
I'm not making 10 million a year,
so fuck them.

453
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.110
Well,
I'm not making 10 million a year either,
and I don't say fuck them.

454
00:26:05.111 --> 00:26:09.670
I don't leave him the fuck alone.
Um,
and go after the fucking problem.

455
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:10.391
All right?

456
00:26:10.391 --> 00:26:14.680
Don't paint a house that has a broken foundation or that needs a new foundation,

457
00:26:14.681 --> 00:26:19.360
I should say.
All right,
well by the way,
I'm going to be in New York City Tuesday,

458
00:26:19.361 --> 00:26:23.290
flying in Tuesday morning,
getting off the plane,
going right over to Msg,

459
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:28.590
uh,
for the garden of dreams.
And you know what they're saying?
Dreams.
Okay?

460
00:26:28.591 --> 00:26:32.580
At eight fucking the main room with a Nixon,
the fucking rangers play cause that,

461
00:26:32.581 --> 00:26:33.970
that's the garden of nightmares.

462
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:38.590
I'm talking about the theater at Madison Square Garden where Eddie Murphy

463
00:26:38.591 --> 00:26:41.560
recorded raw,
legendary place,

464
00:26:41.561 --> 00:26:46.440

Unbelievable.

466
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.090
Uh,

467
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:58.560

<v 2>Yeah,</v>

479
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.610

Um,

482
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.810
typical me,
I don't even know what the fuck this is for.

483
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.390
And you will all start benefit that is raised nearly $5 million so far.
For what?

484
00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:58.203
<v 2>Okay.</v>

State area,
including hospitals,
wish organizations and Q.
Okay.

487
00:28:06.481 --> 00:28:09.390
All gardener dreams make a wish.
Okay.
It's like a make a wish thing.
Okay,
cool.

488
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.340
So I'll be doing that.
Or Billy new jokes coming to town.

489
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:20.340
Did I fucking eat my fucking freckle dick the other night?
Jesus Christ.

490
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.370
I took a nice fat one at the fucking belly rump.

491
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:27.030
Went up there with some new jokes.
Oh my God.

492
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:30.060
Terrible fucking terrible.

493
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:33.510
I had this great fucking thing on people who are watching that Michael Jackson

494
00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:38.070
fucking documentary.
It absolutely fucking destroyed,

495
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:44.170
destroyed.
And then the very next night,

496
00:28:44.171 --> 00:28:47.500
two nights later I go to do it and I never take myself cause I just,
I I,

497
00:28:47.501 --> 00:28:49.090
you know,
cause I know I'm not going to listen to it.

498
00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:52.900
I wish I take that night cause I went and tried to do the same thing and all I

499
00:28:52.901 --> 00:28:57.280
got was groans.
So that might just be one of those things where,

500
00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.760
you know,
one night it worked and it just never worked again.

501
00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.380
Then I just sit there,
you know,
like somebody who had loved and then lost it.

502
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:10.360
<v 3>MMM.</v>

503
00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.730
<v 1>Speaking of having love of that and lost it,</v>

504
00:29:12.731 --> 00:29:16.510
let's read a little bit of the advertising here.
Um,

505
00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.690
the fuck did I do with it?
MMP content.

506
00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.640

Oh wait,
did I,
did I attach them?

507
00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.530
Oh I did.
Oh look who it is.
Hi,

508
00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:36.600
you have a buy something online only to find out later.
You missed a discount.

509
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.680
I don't know.
Did I had a fuck what?
I find that out.

510
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.950
What a mean Old Lady of their coupons on the Internet.
I had no idea.

511
00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:49.330
I didn't know about this shit.
Anyways.
Uh,
don't overspend anymore.

512
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.820
Go to honey.

520
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:26.840
wait per purchase.

521
00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.270
<v 2>Okay,</v>

522
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:32.770
<v 1>well,
it depends on what you buy.
That's a little vague.
Hi.
Hey,</v>

523
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.880

524
00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:40.900

Not Bad for some.
I guess that means per purchase,

525
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.450
10 million turns into 800 billion.

526

Policy genius.

540
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.810
Hey,
can you fog and believe it's April already?

541
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:41.263
MMM.

542
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.150
Do you know it says that people who don't live in towns that have fucking the

543
00:31:45.151 --> 00:31:46.980
winner or part of the world,
you know what I mean?

544
00:31:46.981 --> 00:31:50.310
I remember Massachusetts January,
February,

545
00:31:50.311 --> 00:31:52.950
and the horrific hope of March.

546
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:54.680
<v 2>Okay.</v>

547
00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.700
<v 1>In like a lamb.
I'll like a lot.
You know,</v>

548
00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.590
it just socked 31 fucking days of it.

549
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.510
<v 2>Okay.</v>

550
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.090
<v 1>Before I had to fucking pay,
you know,
rent and everything.</v>

551
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.900
February always fucking dragged.
Even though it was only 28 days,

552
00:32:08.901 --> 00:32:11.150
it was still the middle of fucking,
oh wait,

553
00:32:11.151 --> 00:32:12.680
you got your February vacation though.

554
00:32:12.681 --> 00:32:14.510
That was kind of cool when I was in school anyways.

555
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:17.990
Can you believe it's already April time has a habit of getting away,

556
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:21.080
but if you have a mortgage kids already,
what?
Depending on your income,

557
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:25.100
you're going to have to spend some of that precious time to get life insurance.

558
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:29.000
If you need life insurance but you don't want to spend a lot of time comparing

559
00:32:29.001 --> 00:32:32.360
it,
you should give policy genius a try.

560
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:36.740
Policy Genius is the easy way to buy life insurance online.

561

563
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:48.650

564
00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:53.030
red tape,
no commissions,
no hidden fees,
just more time saved for you.

565
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.660
So if you need life insurance but you're not,
but you're short on time,

566
00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.980
had to policy genius.com and compare quotes.

It saves you money.
And not to Belabor the point,

569
00:33:12.301 --> 00:33:16.640

not,
but it's,
it's fast.
I Dunno.

570
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:20.130
Policy gene and spend less time comparing life insurance and more time doing

571
00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:24.840
literally anything else.
All right,
let's get back to the podcast here.

572
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.420
Um,
all right.
Moto GP had their second race of the year.

573
00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:34.740
I know Mark Marquez has,
I didn't get a chance to watch it yet.
Um,

574
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.030
I'm going to try to do that.

575
00:33:36.031 --> 00:33:39.870
I'm going to finish this podcast and hang out with my little beautiful kid here

576
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.160
and uh,

577
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:45.210
and then I might check that out tonight cause I ain't doing shit.

578
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.280
I'm not doing shit tonight.
Hanging out with the wife,

579
00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:50.660
going to get a little quality time in there.
Um,

580
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
I did a benefit Saturday night at the palace theater here in downtown La.

581
00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:59.280
I got to play drums.
Um,

582
00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.430
the portion of the show that I was on was a,

583
00:34:02.431 --> 00:34:07.020
it's an ms benefit rock against ms and um,

584
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:10.230
just a great event.
I've done it twice.

585
00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:15.270
Ansi B sale puts the thing together and it's always this great mix of incredible

586
00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.580
musicians that I grew up watching.
And I,
you know,

587
00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.080
when I get to sit in with all these fucking great people and I,

588
00:34:22.081 --> 00:34:26.370
I played highway to hell,
which I think I played live at this time,

589
00:34:26.371 --> 00:34:29.640
like a half a dozen times.
But this is the first time I played it where I,

590
00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:34.170
I felt like I had the least amount of,
uh,
fuck ups.
You know,
it's funny,

591
00:34:34.171 --> 00:34:38.550
in the middle,
that's such an easy song to fuck up a,
at least at my level,

592
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.730
because you know,
in the middle where he's going down,
stop man,

593
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.230
bad at a bed and a bad,
you know,
it's sort of,

594
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.820
it's like a three against four thing.

595
00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:53.880
So you're supposed to of one and two and three and four,
one,
two,
three,

596
00:34:53.881 --> 00:34:57.840
four,
one and two and three and four and one and two and three,

597
00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.750
four really simple.
But in my head,

598
00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.060
whenever I'm playing the song,

599
00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:06.660
because I played that song a million fucking times and never thought about it,

600
00:35:06.661 --> 00:35:09.480
I could just feel it.
But all of a sudden I'm playing it.

601
00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.060
I'm not playing along to the track and I got fucking people.

602
00:35:12.061 --> 00:35:16.470
I grew up watching on MTV.
It's turning around looking at me.
I get,
fuck,

603
00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:21.200
it fucks me up.
Right?
So that one is basically a,

604
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:25.760
I always hear it is one and a two into three and that was just like,

605
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:26.990
oh no,
where am I?

606
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:32.420
And I was playing along the ACDC and I just started thinking about it and all of

607
00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:34.700
a sudden I was fucking it up playing along the highway.

608
00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.400
I played along in that song if 30 for 30 fucking years,
never thought about it.

609
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:40.680
All right.
The day of the Gig,

610
00:35:40.681 --> 00:35:43.120
I'm playing along to it and I'm thinking about this part going,

611
00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.230
I at least I got to know how to count this out,
figure out what this is.

612
00:35:46.231 --> 00:35:49.800
After all these years of playing it.
And I started fucking it up.

613
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.260
So I'm backstage just going,

614
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.680
I'm going one and two and three and four

615
00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.210
one and two and three and four and one and two and three for like I'm going to

616
00:36:01.211 --> 00:36:05.170
do that.
So,
of course when the time comes,
so the song fucking comes,
you know,

617
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.810
we start playing the fucking song.
We get to that point.
Uh,

618
00:36:07.811 --> 00:36:11.260
Michael Devin from Whitesnake is singing and um,

619
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:12.810
<v 3>okay.</v>

620
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:17.040
<v 1>I immediately,
I still,
you know,
Pata Pata at that bar and I had no idea.</v>

621
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:19.560
So I just fucking went real hard with the high hat.
So my,

622
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.630
my one would be there one what?
Well,
and then,
you know,

623
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.090
ended up getting out of it.
And,
um,

624
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.340
I had a great fucking time.
I don't like drum sounded awesome and I got to,
uh,

625
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:36.480
watch all these guys,
Stephen Parkins who was just on my podcast.

626
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:41.460
I got to watch him play my favorite van Halen Song of all time,
mean streets.

627
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:46.950
And uh,
what does it mean street?
This is home,

628
00:36:46.951 --> 00:36:49.530
this is main street.
It's main street,
the movies mean streets.

629
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.420
I got to watch him play that.

630
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.010
<v 3>And um,</v>

631
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.880
<v 1>just an incredible fucking drummer man.
You know,</v>

632
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:58.920
some people look like their work and when they're playing,

633
00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:03.690
that guy looks up there like he's just having the time of his fucking life and I

634
00:37:03.691 --> 00:37:05.610
got to go on like right after him.

635
00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.640
<v 3>And um,</v>

636
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:11.110
<v 1>he's just,
he's the best fucking dude ever.
Uh,</v>

637
00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.120
so I'm hoping he's actually going to be

638
00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.040
playing out live here where I can watch them do a full set.

639
00:37:18.041 --> 00:37:22.930
That's what the fuck I would really like.
Um,
some,
oh,
what am I talking about?

640
00:37:22.931 --> 00:37:24.460
He promoted that thing in the beginning of April.

641
00:37:24.461 --> 00:37:28.450
Am I going to be around for that?
I think I am.
Hopefully I am.

642
00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.433
<v 3>MMM.</v>

643
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:34.020
<v 1>That thing in downtown La.
Now I'm literally just talking to myself.</v>

644
00:37:34.021 --> 00:37:36.270
I'm not even doing a fucking podcast anymore.
All right,

645
00:37:36.271 --> 00:37:39.180
let's get to some of the questions here for the week.

646
00:37:39.181 --> 00:37:42.510
I know the red sox have won one and lost two.

647
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.333
Um,

648
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:48.840
I love when they said the red sox have given up 18 runs of their past two games.

649
00:37:48.841 --> 00:37:50.670
And I was like,
Jesus Christ,
we're getting lit up.

650
00:37:50.671 --> 00:37:54.240
And then I see we only let up six the other night.
It's like,
all right,

651
00:37:54.241 --> 00:37:58.890
so we let him 12 one night.
That fucking happens.
Um,
all right,
let's get to,

652
00:37:58.891 --> 00:38:02.130
uh,
let's get to some of the questions here for the week.

653
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.740
See what I got here.
Um,

654
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:08.780
I'm hoping I'm not going to get trashed too much for my fucking,

655
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.280
my views here on taxes aren't athletes getting paid.

656
00:38:14.281 --> 00:38:15.750
Hey bill receipt on your podcast.

657
00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:19.260
You talked a little bit about why college athletes athletes should get paid.

658
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.920
Yeah.
But I also think that it should be like a flat fee,

659
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:25.710
so you don't have to bring in agents or anything like that.

660
00:38:25.711 --> 00:38:29.400
They do a straight across the fucking board socialism thing here.

661
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:34.500
Um,
so you don't have high school holdouts and all of that or maybe that is the

662
00:38:34.501 --> 00:38:38.170
wrong thing.
I have no idea.
Um,
I was just saying starters,

663
00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:42.520
get this amount of money and if you have a Jersey that sells a lot,

664
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:47.550
you get a percentage of it and then everybody else who isn't a starter gets a

665
00:38:47.651 --> 00:38:50.530
certain amount of fucking money.
Um,
and then that's it.

666
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:54.130
Straight across the fucking board.
Big Bang.
Boom.
Done.
All right.
Hey Bill.
Okay.

667
00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:58.060
And I wanted to chime in on why it's harder than it seems not just because of

668
00:38:58.061 --> 00:39:01.390
the greedy corporate comps.
Oh No,
it's,
it's fucking,
it'd be a fucking nightmare.

669
00:39:01.391 --> 00:39:06.391
That's why I'm proposing a one sort of,

670
00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.013
<v 2>you know,</v>

671
00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.520
<v 1>I get,
I dunno,
it's just fucked up that somebody is like,</v>

672
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.140
<v 2>okay,</v>

673
00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:19.010
<v 1>selling a zillion jerseys with their name on the back.</v>

674
00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:21.380
Just coming from shell business.

675
00:39:21.381 --> 00:39:26.270
I just know if I sold out a football fucking stadium,
um,

676
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:28.000
<v 2>okay.</v>

677
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.540
<v 1>That I would get paid for it.
I would never do that show for free unless,</v>

678
00:39:31.541 --> 00:39:35.170
I guess it was a benefit.
But I can't see a football stadium worth of people.

679
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:39.250
This is weird thing where it's like you're coming in as a,
as a,

680
00:39:39.251 --> 00:39:42.880
as a blue chip draft pick out of a recruit,

681
00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:46.660
I should say out of high school.
And then

682
00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:51.670
you're going to Michigan or USC or Alabama,

683
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:55.390
like these places they're going to sell out anyways because of the history.

684
00:39:55.391 --> 00:39:59.080
So it's almost like you're joining a supergroup.
Right.

685
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:04.150
But it's kind of like the original members leave and now you have to carry on

686
00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:06.340
the name.
So at first they're doing you a favor,

687
00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:10.900
but once you establish yourself as a star,
then you're the one that's continuing.

688
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.800
You're the,
you're the draw that people are going to at that point,

689
00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:16.540
they know your fucking name and that's,

690
00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:20.590
that's gotta be some sort of money that would think,
you know,
anyways.

691
00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:25.390
Um,
I'll also try to use simple language because I know you can't read out loud

692
00:40:25.391 --> 00:40:27.040
worth of shit and neither can I.
Well,

693
00:40:27.041 --> 00:40:30.090
I like the fact that your self draft McCree deprecating too,
right?

694
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:34.750
Paying athletes is all about who gets the larger and smaller pieces of the Pie.

695
00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:38.800
Do football players get more than basketball players and soccer players?

696
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:43.840
Do Physical sports or activities get more than mentally exhausting sports or

697
00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:47.560
activities and what counts as a sport or an athlete?

698
00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:48.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>

699
00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:49.800
<v 1>Uh,</v>

700
00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:54.390
should the chess club or racketball players also get their share of money now?

701
00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:55.810
<v 2>Okay.</v>

702
00:40:55.810 --> 00:41:00.280
<v 1>You know what I mean?
I'm talking fucking,
you're f you're already famous.</v>

703
00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.750
You such a big time fucking college player.
You're already famous.

704
00:41:04.751 --> 00:41:05.590
That's what I mean.

705
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:07.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

706
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.250
<v 1>Listen,
listen.
All right.</v>

707
00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:15.410
I would limit it to the sports at the school that have actually built the dorms.

708
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.063
You know what I mean?

709
00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:21.240
Built the new fucking swimming pool for the fucking swim team.
I mean,

710
00:41:21.241 --> 00:41:24.030
give me a fucking break here.
All right.

711
00:41:24.031 --> 00:41:28.290
The amount of money that college football and college basketball brings in.

712
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.110
That's what the fuck I'm talking about.
All right.

713
00:41:31.111 --> 00:41:36.111
And then lesser than that is a handful of hockey programs at least here in

714
00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:40.460
America and uh,
in baseball.
But they don't bring in the money,

715
00:41:40.461 --> 00:41:44.000
the TV march madness,
the bowl games,

716
00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:46.550
the fucking playoffs system.
They now have football.
I mean,

717
00:41:46.551 --> 00:41:51.200
that's a whole other fucking level.
Um,
anyways.
Uh,

718
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:52.460
<v 2>okay.</v>

719
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:56.570
<v 1>Basically the universities are pieces of shit because they take the federal</v>

720
00:41:56.571 --> 00:42:01.571
student aid money and then take a broadcasting and they then take broadcasting

721
00:42:02.001 --> 00:42:06.410
companies money and pay fucking nobody in return.
It's smart,

722
00:42:06.411 --> 00:42:09.050
but it's also a total dick move.
Okay.
We're all in this one.

723
00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:09.920
We're on the same page here.

724
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.600
My thoughts are that schools who are getting money from any source of an event

725
00:42:14.601 --> 00:42:17.450
like the Ncaa Tournament,
College Football playoff,

726
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:20.720
or the president's Cup chess championships,
well,

727
00:42:20.721 --> 00:42:24.830
how much fucking money is that should be contributing to the players in some
way?

728
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:29.760
Medical travel shoes,
chessboards and so on.
Uh,
Musky.

729
00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:31.250
You sound like a chess player to me,
man.

730
00:42:31.251 --> 00:42:36.140
You bring it up chess way too much and is a for the slices of Pie,

731
00:42:36.141 --> 00:42:40.100
the amount kickback to the athletes should be proportional.
Sorry,

732
00:42:40.101 --> 00:42:43.550
had to use one big word.
Jesus.
Guys,

733
00:42:43.551 --> 00:42:48.080
am I this bad fucking talking to me like I have brain damage.
Okay.
K Two,

734
00:42:48.081 --> 00:42:51.430
the amount of the universe to the amount,
the,
uh,
the university.

735
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.840
Then I stumbled over the next five words.
All right.
Point taken.

736
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:57.650
You guys are right.
The university receives some of the event.
It's fucked up.

737
00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:58.960
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

738
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:02.620
<v 1>it's fucked up.
How to solve the paying athletes problem,</v>

739
00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.010
but something is better than nothing.
Anyways,
I'm a longtime listener.

740
00:43:06.011 --> 00:43:07.600
Saw you in Portland,
Oregon last summer.

741
00:43:07.601 --> 00:43:11.890
Keep being great and stay safe on your upcoming travels.

742
00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.720
Sincerely,
nobody,
no name left to go fuck yourself.
Um,

743
00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:19.630
yeah,
they should probably do.
So I would think that they,

744
00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:23.890
it doesn't make any the amount of money that they're generating.

745
00:43:23.891 --> 00:43:27.520
And then I love that argument.
Did getting a free education,
it's like,

746
00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:29.820
<v 2>okay.</v>

747
00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.150
<v 1>You know,
it's like they,</v>

748
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:35.880
they're going there to play football and try to make it into the NFL and their

749
00:43:35.881 --> 00:43:38.370
body and their brain is never going to be the same.

750
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:42.630
They're going to do damage to their body that they're going to feel for the rest

751
00:43:42.631 --> 00:43:44.340
of their fucking life.
Okay.

752
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:48.480
They don't have time to fucking go to class and do all of that shit.

753
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.310
Especially during the football season.

754
00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:52.370
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

755
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.580
<v 1>Can you imagine getting ready to play for Alabama and making sure you're turning</v>

756
00:43:55.581 --> 00:43:58.700
your paper in and at the same time they get a free education.

757
00:43:58.701 --> 00:44:00.660
Now they get an education on,
on a,

758
00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:02.380
<v 2>okay.</v>

759
00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:06.070
<v 1>I feel like the music businesses almost,
it's,
it's that much of a fuck over.</v>

760
00:44:06.071 --> 00:44:08.230
Even the music business.
Jesus Christ,
they back in the day,

761
00:44:08.231 --> 00:44:11.800
they let you keep your fucking tore money and your t shirt,
you merge money.

762
00:44:11.801 --> 00:44:12.634
Right.

763
00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:14.683
<v 2>Okay.</v>

764
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:17.680
<v 1>Um,
I dunno.
All right.
The number 70.</v>

765
00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:18.980
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

766
00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:20.030
<v 1>Hey,
bill,
simply put,</v>

767
00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:25.060
I think the interesting thing about the 70% tax rate argument is that most of

768
00:44:25.221 --> 00:44:28.700
the people arguing for it don't even know why 70.

769
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.000
<v 2>Okay.</v>

770
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.020
<v 1>Uh,
I would be one of those,</v>

771
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:36.380
the green deal doesn't really just justify 70 or make it any more important than

772
00:44:36.571 --> 00:44:41.160
say 65.
The team behind AOC,
I even know what that is,

773
00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:45.270
gave her that number.
Her team is essentially socialists.

774
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:50.280
They're trying to make a capitalist argument in support of a socialist idea and

775
00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:53.550
socialism,
there is no end game and like fascism,

776
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.370
it's a small group of people making decisions for everyone.

777
00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:58.320
That's the capitalism is that way too.

778
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:03.870
We really got to stop like acting like capitalism,
you know,
Eh,

779
00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:06.410
anybody can just ball up sells up by the bootstraps,

780
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:11.040
live like there's things aren't like locked down.
You know,
if that was true,

781
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:14.610
we would not have the gas combustion engine for as long as we have.

782
00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.870
If that was true,
we would deal with global warming head on.

783
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.030
Um,
yeah.
Oh,
all forms of government.

784
00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:25.230
<v 2>Okay.</v>

785
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:28.500
<v 1>Socialism,
fascism,
capitalism,
whatever the fuck you want to call them.</v>

786
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:31.890
They're all inherently flawed because they're run by human beings.

787
00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:32.970
<v 2>Okay.</v>

788
00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:37.970
<v 1>Who are inherently flood yours truly one of the great cases of all time anyways.</v>

789
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:42.780
Unless we wipe out all the congress and replaced the millionaires with average

790
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:46.500
joes who care about the earth and people and being fair,

791
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:50.730
they'll just use that power to spend all our money on selfless,
selfish causes.

792
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:53.490
It's human nature.
It absolutely is.
And that's a,

793
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.530
that's another part of my argument.
It's like,
okay,

794
00:45:55.531 --> 00:46:00.420
so these are the tax dollars that are,
they're actually gonna use,
you know,

795
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:04.080
so public schools are better.
I get healthcare,
fix the roads,

796
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:08.910
help out the people in Flint,
Michigan,
you know,
help out veterans.

797
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:10.441
This,

798
00:46:10.441 --> 00:46:13.230
these are the tack store dollars are actually going to get to them and they're

799
00:46:13.231 --> 00:46:17.130
not.
They're not.
It is a broken system.

800
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:22.500
I'm just hoping the fine folks at Blackwater,
um,
you know,

801
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:26.570
they have the weaponry to,
to,
to have a full on fucking revolution.
Hopefully the,

802
00:46:26.571 --> 00:46:31.170
their hearts are in the right place.
Who knows?
We shall see.

803
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:35.020
Um,
friend is a flat earth.

804
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:37.680
<v 2>Okay.</v>

805
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.150
<v 1>What,
I don't understand how this,
this made a comeback.</v>

806
00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.550
I really feel like this is just people trolling.

807
00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:48.670
I just can't imagine that this is,
this is an actual thing.
I mean,

808
00:46:48.671 --> 00:46:51.510
God knows I'm not a fucking smart guy.
Okay.
What the fuck?

809
00:46:51.511 --> 00:46:56.080
What people are going to sit here and act as though this is actually a thing.
Um,

810
00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:01.690
how did this start?
Friend is a flat earthers hey Billy global tits

811
00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.400
that,
you know,
that's the best one in a while.

812
00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:11.370
I'm a 28 year old living in New York.
One of my best friends is a flat earthers.

813
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:15.220
Not only him but his girlfriend as well.
Well,
you know,

814
00:47:15.221 --> 00:47:19.400
they fucked missionary style,
Huh?
What do they call it?
Earth style.
Uh,

815
00:47:19.401 --> 00:47:21.610
I know I've known them for over five years.

816
00:47:21.611 --> 00:47:24.670
So recently I sent him a cool video of two space.

817
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

818
00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.750
<v 1>Is that acts or 10 rockets?
Vertically landing.</v>

819
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:32.950
I would expect his normal reaction like,
oh,
that's so cool.

820
00:47:32.951 --> 00:47:36.760
It's amazing what people can do nowadays.
But instead of that,

821
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:41.410
he started talking about how we've been lied to the whole time that all the

822
00:47:41.411 --> 00:47:42.580
space program,

823
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.990
Isis and all of that is a global hoax.

824
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.930
Oh Man.
He went way down the rabbit hole.

825
00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:52.693
<v 2>Okay.</v>

826
00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:55.300
<v 1>I started down that road and I headed back,</v>

827
00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:00.610
so I thought he was joking and I asked him,
are you a flat earner?

828
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:04.030
Arthur?
And he responded,
do research,
Bro.

829
00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.130
<v 0>Okay,
wait a second.</v>

830
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:15.800
You know something?
I want to take this guy's advice

831
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.570
<v 1>and I'm,
I'm going to do a little research here.
Flat Earth,</v>

832
00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:22.730
<v 2>okay.</v>

833
00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:23.563
<v 1>Evidence,</v>

834
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:25.730
<v 2>okay?</v>

835
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:30.470
<v 1>I can't imagine what the advertising I'm going to get.
Now.
Science,
Samia,</v>

836
00:48:30.471 --> 00:48:32.300
Hazmat suit and a fucking shelter.

837
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:37.520
Frequent hand flat or frequently asked questions.
What evidence do you have?

838
00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.150
10 easiest way you can tell for yourself.
The earth is not flat,

839
00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:42.410
<v 2>okay?</v>

840
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:45.920
<v 1>This is evidence.
What if this is what proves the evidence?</v>

841
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:48.830
Like all these smarmy people taking all this time,

842
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:52.190
like can you imagine like if you know the world's fucking round,
right?

843
00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.380
You been in a plane,
you'll looked at it,

844
00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:57.560
you've seen it a flat,

845
00:48:57.561 --> 00:48:59.630
or maybe they're just fucking near sighted people.

846
00:48:59.631 --> 00:49:04.631
They can't see the roundness of the earth when they get up at 37,000 feet a flat

847
00:49:04.731 --> 00:49:07.160
earth.
The flat earth model is an architect concept,

848
00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:08.590
<v 2>okay?</v>

849
00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:13.460
<v 1>The flat earth explained.
Okay.</v>

850
00:49:13.461 --> 00:49:16.460
And the weirdest part isn't just that he believes the earth is flat.

851
00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:21.560
I can't find anybody that says seven ways approved.
The earth is round.

852
00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.120
You know what,
cause I'm on page one.

853
00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.690
Why the earth is actually a hundred percent flat.

854
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.440
Okay,
hang on a second.
Is this the one,

855
00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:42.150
um,
you know,
I got to hit pause because I want to read these six hold on us.

856
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:47.640
Okay,
I'm back.
Right?

857
00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:54.230
I just found a guy goes,
you know,
La Foil,
you guys say I'm a moron.
I uh,
did a,

858
00:49:54.231 --> 00:49:58.280
uh,
I was on the math team and I a want a jury trial,

859
00:49:58.281 --> 00:49:59.930
which are very difficult to win.
And uh,

860
00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:04.100
I used to think that the world is round until I met my Lord and Savior Jesus

861
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.510
Christ 40 years ago.
And it's like,
okay.

862
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.620
<v 0>All right.
All right,
I'm out.
Tap it out,</v>

863
00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:15.350
<v 1>tad.
God bless you.
God bless you.
God bless all the flat earthers.</v>

864
00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:17.320
<v 2>Okay,</v>

865
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.051
<v 1>so what do they think?</v>

866
00:50:18.051 --> 00:50:21.210
They think the earth is round but of slap at the moon is round.

867
00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:22.943
<v 2>Okay.</v>

868
00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.110
<v 1>How does the water not run off the eds?</v>

869
00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.133
<v 2>Okay.</v>

870
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:32.720
<v 1>I mean,
I've flown around the world.
I've done it.</v>

871
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:37.580
I did a Gig,
I flew from La to Australia,

872
00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.300
then I did Australia to fucking New Zealand.

873
00:50:41.301 --> 00:50:44.600
And then I went to Singapore that I went to China,
that I went to India.

874
00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:47.810
Then I went to New York,
I connected in Dubai.

875
00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:52.160
We kept flying that fucking other way.
Granted,
I didn't have a compass.

876
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:55.010
He could have done a big slow fucking all the pilots in on it.

877
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.290
Uh,
you know who the,
I don't know where the fuck I'm going to,
you know,
that'd be,

878
00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.250
that'd be really easy to fake you,
fake you in a plane,
you know,

879
00:51:07.251 --> 00:51:11.490
just for a few times when I tried to do a little bit of instrument training in

880
00:51:11.491 --> 00:51:14.190
the helicopter and they have you close your eyes and they just start doing shit

881
00:51:14.191 --> 00:51:18.030
and you can just,
you have no fucking idea what's going on.
And I got to,
you know,

882
00:51:18.031 --> 00:51:20.590
if you sit in the back of a plane,
you just looking out the side of it,
you,

883
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:25.340
you don't know what's going on.
Hey Man,
you know what?
Maybe it is flat,
man.

884
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.863
Um,

885
00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:28.913
<v 2>yeah,</v>

886
00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.780
<v 1>I dunno.
I just go,
Jesus Christ,</v>

887
00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:35.280
this guy found Jesus in the result of it was he thinks the fucking world is
flat.

888
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:39.190
Okay.
Anyways,
I've known them for over five years.

889
00:51:39.191 --> 00:51:42.400
Let's just get back to this fucking thing.
Okay.
Uh,
so he said,

890
00:51:42.401 --> 00:51:43.390
do your research bro.

891
00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:48.010
The same day I called him and his girlfriend over to over to my house.

892
00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:49.760
<v 2>Okay.</v>

893
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.300
<v 1>All right.
Well,</v>

894
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:56.330
I just looked at a guy who said he was a mathlete and he believes the world is

895
00:51:57.181 --> 00:51:59.760
flat.
You believe it's round and you just wrote a fragment.

896
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:02.130
So right now the flat earthers are winning.

897
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:06.810
The same day I called him and his girlfriend over to my house,
period.
Anyways,

898
00:52:06.811 --> 00:52:10.680
I'm going to tell you,
oh,
freckles.
I had much fun arguing with them,

899
00:52:10.681 --> 00:52:13.920
but his response was,
I knew you were going to make fun of us,

900
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:17.490
not take us seriously.
Um,
I didn't,

901
00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:20.490
I didn't mean to tell you,
it just slipped out of my mouth.

902
00:52:20.491 --> 00:52:25.050
Next time I'll be cautious.
Now.
This is very unusual behavior for him.

903
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:29.040
He never had been so sensitive and cautious on any level.

904
00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:33.240
He's biggest argument is that it's written in the Qur'an,
the Bible,

905
00:52:33.241 --> 00:52:35.610
and the Torah,
that the earth is flat.

906
00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:40.050
God laid the earth beneath our feet like a carpet for us to walk on.

907
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:42.000
<v 2>Okay,</v>

908
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.700
<v 1>well he could still do that and it could be round
seal gravity thing.</v>

909
00:52:46.701 --> 00:52:47.534
Right?

910
00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:54.640
I respect religion,
but like,
but like a comedy,

911
00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:59.170
I can not take it literally.
It's all written in poetic manner.
Right?

912
00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:03.370
It's been almost a week and I'm arguing with him only about this topic.

913
00:53:03.371 --> 00:53:06.430
My question is,
is flat earth or the new gay,

914
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:12.750
should I close this topic and accept his new enlightened perspectives or should

915
00:53:13.301 --> 00:53:17.170
I be worried about continuing to throw scientific facts at them?

916
00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.650
Is that what you do with gay people?

917
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:28.230
Look you,
you both have vaginas.
Okay,

918
00:53:28.231 --> 00:53:30.270
then you can't penetrate one another.

919
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:35.490
How much more scientific fact do you need that the two of you lesbian should

920
00:53:35.491 --> 00:53:37.440
have a threesome with me anyways.

921
00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:40.860
I don't want to escalate this thing to the breaking point,

922
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:45.720
but it feels like they're in some cult and since they are my friends,
I care.

923
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:49.950
I listen regularly.
Two to your Po podcast.

924
00:53:49.951 --> 00:53:54.180
Always from Casco Stan.
Oh,
all right.
All right.

925
00:53:54.181 --> 00:53:57.420
So I'll forgive the fragments here.
And this is my first time riding.

926
00:53:57.421 --> 00:54:01.860
Sorry for my English.
Your answer's great.
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Um,

927
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:04.200
I don't know how things work in Casco Stan,

928
00:54:04.201 --> 00:54:07.080
but over here in the good old United States of America,
a,

929
00:54:07.081 --> 00:54:12.081
your friendship with them is hit a serious snag in the road.

930
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:14.723
So,

931
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.760
<v 3>okay.</v>

932
00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:16.061
<v 1>I mean,</v>

933
00:54:16.061 --> 00:54:21.061
you can continue to be friends with somebody that thinks the world is flat.

934
00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:23.920
Just don't bring it up.

935
00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:25.990
<v 3>Okay.</v>

936
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:30.200
<v 1>It's like religion,
you know,
there's a bunch,
I mean,
I'm,</v>

937
00:54:30.201 --> 00:54:34.200
I'm not into it,
but I,
I,
I don't know if people,

938
00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:36.650
I mean,
I hung out with people.

939
00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:39.740
Scientologists seemed to be like the only people around my age that still

940
00:54:39.741 --> 00:54:43.160
fucking practice their religion.
I don't,
they don't fucking bug me.

941
00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.320
I just don't bring up religion.

942
00:54:45.321 --> 00:54:47.900
I'm not gonna fucking bombard them with my stupid opinions,

943
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:49.940
my unresearched opinions.
Who gives a fuck?

944
00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:52.820
You know what the funny thing is is the only reason why you and I know that the

945
00:54:52.821 --> 00:54:56.720
earth is fucking round is because of other human beings that had the balls to

946
00:54:56.721 --> 00:54:59.480
fucking get in a God damn boat and start sailing off into it.

947
00:54:59.481 --> 00:55:02.690
So I can only make fun of these people so much.
Okay.

948
00:55:02.691 --> 00:55:07.691
You're talking about somebody who took his daughter a two year old to a fucking

949
00:55:09.631 --> 00:55:11.430
Tim Burton movie.
So I mean,
how much,

950
00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:15.690
how far away am I from someone who thinks the fucking world is flat?
Um,

951
00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.190
but having said that,

952
00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.473
<v 3>mmm.</v>

953
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:24.480
<v 1>I feel like you're eventually going to slowly back away from these two people if</v>

954
00:55:24.481 --> 00:55:25.560
they continue down that road.

955
00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:27.853
<v 3>MMM.</v>

956
00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.350
<v 1>Yeah,
I was getting nervous that,
you know,</v>

957
00:55:32.351 --> 00:55:35.830
people were going to make fun of them to the point that they become angry people

958
00:55:35.831 --> 00:55:39.130
and then all of a sudden you're the person that they take their anger out on.

959
00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.920
These are just concerns that I have.
Uh,
all right.

960
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:44.050
Boyfriend wants to become a comedian,
by the way.

961
00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.030
Thanks for listening to the podcast.
Way over there.

962
00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:47.680
Don't you guys have a race over there?

963
00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:52.030
One of the f one races over there and one of those key countries,
uh,

964
00:55:52.031 --> 00:55:56.020
boyfriend wants to become a comedian.
Hey,
Billy Bald Eagle,

965
00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:01.980
my boyfriend of almost two years told me when we started dating then he's been

966
00:56:02.021 --> 00:56:06.790
torn between being a comedian or being a doctor.
Um,

967
00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:08.650
yes,
I knew a guy that,
uh,

968
00:56:08.651 --> 00:56:12.910
actually quit being a comedian to go back to med school.
Uh,
he's ridiculous,

969
00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:16.780
ridiculously smart and I know he can do anything he puts his mind to.

970
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:18.460
<v 3>Okay,</v>

971
00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.680
<v 1>so are York here.</v>

972
00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:23.800
But I personally feel like he'd make a bigger difference the world being a

973
00:56:23.801 --> 00:56:24.560
doctor.
And,
um,

974
00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:29.560
anything could be easier to transition from being a doctor to a comedian than

975
00:56:29.741 --> 00:56:30.730
the other way around.

976
00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:34.980
<v 2>MMM.</v>

977
00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:37.800
<v 1>Well,
first of all,
it's not your life and it's not your dream.</v>

978
00:56:37.801 --> 00:56:41.640
And I can tell you that,
uh,
this is a young man and woman's business.

979
00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:45.960
So all those years of studying to be a doctor and then become a comedian,
that's,

980
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.960
it said that could be a difficult thing.
Um,

981
00:56:48.961 --> 00:56:52.290
I love him and I've told him that I'll support him no matter what he chooses,

982
00:56:52.291 --> 00:56:56.430
but I purse that.
I personally think Dr is the way to go.

983
00:56:56.650 --> 00:57:00.990
Is it the underlining thing that you don't think he's funny because then I get

984
00:57:00.991 --> 00:57:04.560
this anyways.
Yes.
I realized that it sounds like a fucking gold digger,

985
00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:08.220
but that's not why I want him to go for it.

986
00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:11.490
I couldn't give a fuck about what he brings home.
That's bullshit.

987
00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:15.780
That's complete bullshit.
Why?
Why,

988
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.700
why wouldn't you give a fuck?
That's the first thing women ask.
What do you do?

989
00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.590
That's the guy's job.

990
00:57:22.591 --> 00:57:26.910
The guy's job is to provide the woman's job is to stay home in the kitchen,

991
00:57:26.911 --> 00:57:31.900
making babies.
Um,
but that seriously,
I mean that,

992
00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:32.813
that is the thing.

993
00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:37.530
As much as women want to put on pants and go out down the street wearing a

994
00:57:37.531 --> 00:57:39.300
fucking hard hat,
you know,

995
00:57:39.301 --> 00:57:41.930
you're always going to be working with guys because I mean,
what,

996
00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:45.930
we can't make a baby,
you know,
we can,
you know,

997
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:50.010
we can start the fucking process,
but we're in the pit crew.

998
00:57:50.011 --> 00:57:51.390
You're driving around the fucking track.

999
00:57:51.391 --> 00:57:54.570
You're the ones going to have the fucking kid.
So,
uh,
you know,

1000
00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:58.491
all right,

1001
00:57:58.491 --> 00:58:02.840
my fucking record of fucking crap down for some reason it's still in the left

1002
00:58:02.841 --> 00:58:06.470
fucking channel.
Why is it doing this shit?

1003
00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:12.410
Why does it do this now?
What about this?
Does this make it better?

1004
00:58:12.411 --> 00:58:15.560
Does this,
is this both sides now what is it now?
It isn't.

1005
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.541
You know what?

1006
00:58:17.541 --> 00:58:19.910
I'm going to have to buy a new recorder cause I don't know how to make I make

1007
00:58:19.911 --> 00:58:24.320
this fucking thing mark.
I was saying,
yeah,
there's nothing wrong ladies with,

1008
00:58:24.321 --> 00:58:27.740
with asking what a guy does for a living.
That's what you should be asking.

1009
00:58:27.741 --> 00:58:30.740
Cause you,
you want to,
you want to get what?
A smart guy.

1010
00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.300
Okay.
Where it becomes gold digging is if you,

1011
00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:39.030
you've just tell a guy that you love him when you don't because of what he's

1012
00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:42.570
making and then you marry them and then eventually you can't live the line he

1013
00:58:42.571 --> 00:58:46.260
morning and take him for everything.
He's gotten his fucking house.
Okay.

1014
00:58:46.261 --> 00:58:47.021
But if you're just trying to,

1015
00:58:47.021 --> 00:58:50.370
cause you don't want to marry a fucking dope Metzger for the human race.

1016
00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:53.670
If you're smart enough,
you're smart enough

1017
00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.000
to not marry a dope,

1018
00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:02.430
then you're going to make smart people who hopefully do good things.

1019
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:07.200
So by all means,
ladies keep asking,
what do you do for a living?
You know,

1020
00:59:07.201 --> 00:59:09.570
there's questions that need to be asked.
You know,

1021
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:14.600
that's basically the female look at females should ask that the same way guys

1022
00:59:14.761 --> 00:59:18.970
should be like,
are those things real?
Okay?
We're both doing our research.
Um,

1023
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:26.070
anyways,
um,
I think that that guy,
uh,

1024
00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:28.030
like I said,
you know,
is,
is he,

1025
00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:32.190
I think he wants to be a comedian and his parents don't support them.

1026
00:59:32.191 --> 00:59:36.870
So that's always great for the comedy and a,
he sounds like a really smart guy.

1027
00:59:36.871 --> 00:59:39.180
If he's smart enough to be torn between the two of them,

1028
00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:43.050
I've made that both great jobs,
you know,
and they both really help people.

1029
00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.480
Um,
all right.
What can I end with?

1030
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:49.440
Let me end with this on this one fucking speaker.
Why is it doing this?

1031
00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:53.340
I have everything set the way I normally said this got gotta be something on the

1032
00:59:53.341 --> 00:59:58.110
mixer.
I'm never going to figure this out.
Stereo.
It's this thing,

1033
00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:02.880
is this what I needed to do?
Did that fix any,
some just happened.
Hello?

1034
01:00:02.881 --> 01:00:07.060
Hello.
I liked the way that sounds.

1035
01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:10.860
This does this work.
And then this,
and then this.
I'm just a,

1036
01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:14.740
this is how I play video games.
I just start pushing the buttons.
Nothing happens.

1037
01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:19.240
It's,
I do stand up too.
I just push buttons.
A congratulations to Ronnie Chang.

1038
01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:23.620
A comic guy saw a long time ago on a fucking plane.
And I was like,

1039
01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:24.640
this guy's funny as hell.

1040
01:00:24.641 --> 01:00:28.690
And then he opened for me and Australia and then he got on the daily show and

1041
01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:30.910
now he just booked an acting role in this sitcom.

1042
01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.210
Um,

1043
01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:37.900
as did I guess to now an African American woman also boasts a congratulations,

1044
01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:42.100
both of them,
but unfortunately the stars are white.

1045
01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.330
So now people are saying,
I'm not going to watch the,
you know,

1046
01:00:46.331 --> 01:00:49.150
15 people on the Internet are saying they're not going to fucking watch it.

1047
01:00:49.151 --> 01:00:53.440
It's just,
you know,
I don't know.
I'm too white to understand all of that.

1048
01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:54.191
It's just like,
all right,

1049
01:00:54.191 --> 01:00:56.590
so you're not going to watch a show because of somebody's skin.

1050
01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.020
It's just a trope were thick of this.

1051
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:04.810
All right.
Okay.
So if I do that,
I'm racist.

1052
01:01:04.811 --> 01:01:08.530
But if you do it because if you add oppression to it and the fact that white

1053
01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:11.770
people created this situation,
you're,
you're,
I'm not gonna use,

1054
01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:16.780
I hate that expression woke.
It's just been overused.
So I dunno.

1055
01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:19.270
I Dunno what the fucking math is on it.

1056
01:01:19.271 --> 01:01:21.100
I just hope People Watch it cause I love Ronny.

1057
01:01:21.101 --> 01:01:25.120
Chieng alright there can everybody just fucking relax.

1058
01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.200
The world is going do a head to hell and I fucking hand basket the first mammal

1059
01:01:32.201 --> 01:01:36.910
is extinct from fucking global warming.
Sorry.
Climate Change.

1060
01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:40.270
Am I in trouble with transgendered people that I used the wrong fucking

1061
01:01:40.271 --> 01:01:44.800
terminology there and we're running around freaking out about fucking sitcoms.

1062
01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:50.080
Ed fucking gender neutral bathrooms are way,
way,

1063
01:01:50.081 --> 01:01:54.520
way more up on the list of priority then this is not going to be any shit for us

1064
01:01:54.521 --> 01:01:59.320
to fucking argue about.
Maybe that is the end game.
I have no idea.

1065
01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.270
Um,
I like when people go,
I don't think that there is a god.

1066
01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.460
Why could there be a god if he would just,

1067
01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:10.030
if you just look at the fucking world and it's just like,
well look,
you know,

1068
01:02:10.031 --> 01:02:13.420
they made absolute masterpiece

1069
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:19.380
masterpieces of automobiles and people bought them and then they just fucking

1070
01:02:19.381 --> 01:02:20.250
sat in a barn.

1071
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.000
Does that mean the people that made them all of a sudden it's not a fucking

1072
01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:25.560
masterpiece?
Well,

1073
01:02:25.561 --> 01:02:29.310
I guess that's not a good thing because the car would act like how human beings

1074
01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:33.520
too.
I Dunno.
Maybe God is like,

1075
01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.610
you know,
like a crazy artist.
You know what I mean?

1076
01:02:36.611 --> 01:02:39.270
And just like our world is just something,
he just,
you know,

1077
01:02:39.271 --> 01:02:40.840
those people that don't,
they don't really paint,

1078
01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:45.070
they just throw fucking paint at a canvas and they get naked and they roll

1079
01:02:45.071 --> 01:02:45.904
around on it.

1080
01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:49.300
They have to put Turpentine and their pubes afterwards and somehow after they

1081
01:02:49.301 --> 01:02:52.840
die,
it's like worth like fucking 10 million bucks.
Maybe that's what he did.

1082
01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:56.140
I have no idea.
Um,
but anyway,

1083
01:02:57.130 --> 01:03:02.130
I'm going to watch it because Ronnie Chang's in it and as a white person I love,

1084
01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.870
I love a white lead.

1085
01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:13.480
I'm not racist.
I'm just a proud white podcast.
I'm fucking around.
I don't,

1086
01:03:13.481 --> 01:03:14.830
I don't watch sitcoms.
I watch,

1087
01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:19.150
I watch sports and I'm going to go watch the Moto GP,
but,
um,

1088
01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.460
I guess that's it,
right?
I'm going to do with the garden of dreams on April 2nd.

1089
01:03:24.461 --> 01:03:28.170
I'll check in on you on Thursday and hopefully a,

1090
01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:31.630
I can have somebody fix this fucking recorder.
I don't know what the problem is.

1091
01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.560
You know what the problem is?
It's me,
so I apologize.
All right,
I'll see ya.
