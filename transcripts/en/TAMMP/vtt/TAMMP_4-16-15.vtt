1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.730
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.600
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill bar and a jacket jacket.</v>

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.560
<v 1>On the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.</v>

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.360
Um,
how's it going?
How's your week been going so far?
Has it been good?

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.790
I just got fucking screwed.
You know,
my wife wanted a rug,
right?

7
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:27.170
So she gets a rug sent over here just so we can look at the fucking thing right

8
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.320
there.
That's like,
that's like when they have you foster a dog,

9
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.530
you're just fostering it now.
You fucking own it.
The second is home.

10
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.810
So they're telling me,
you know,

11
00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:39.380
he should haggle with this guy and haggle with them.
And I'm like,
all right.

12
00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:43.130
They go,
yeah,
he's a,
he's Iranian.
They loved doing it.
They love haggling.

13
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:46.040
So I'm like,
all right,
fine.
I've watched enough,
fast and loud.

14
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.040
I know what I gotta do.
I got it all,
man.
I can't do that.
I mean,
you know,

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.060
no matter what the guy says,
I,
that's what I've learned from Richard Rawlings.

16
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.650
No matter what they say,
you can't do that.
Like,
Hey Richard,
uh,

17
00:00:57.651 --> 00:01:00.590
I got this Ford Pinto and I got to pick a better car,

18
00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:04.280
some car that he would want.
Right.
Whenever I got a 67 dodge coronet here,

19
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.180
I have $900 million invested in it.

20
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.920
I was wondering if you'd give me $40 for it.
And then he always says,
oh man,
man,

21
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.600
I,
I can't,
I can't do that.
I mean,
this car is even worth $15.
I'll give you,

22
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.000
I'll give you eight bucks for it.
I mean,

23
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.140
there's gotta be some meat on the bone for me,
right?
So I'm,

24
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:24.230
I'm doing all my Richard Rounds.
If I had the hair,

25
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:26.030
I'd be fucking rubbing my fingers through my hair.

26
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.160
Threw this guy's guy wouldn't budge.
He shows up,
we're at the house.

27
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.490
He knows she wants it.
I even,
I even fucking rolled the rug up,

28
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:39.370
like I was ready to give it back to them before we started negotiating at a,
he,

29
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.981
he just,

30
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:44.480
he wouldn't budge and he had this big silly smile and I started the light,

31
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:47.990
the guy and it,
it's the whole thing went off the rails.
He just kept going,

32
00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:50.570
my friend,
look,
he goes,

33
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:54.560
you should be thanking me for giving you such a wonderful rug for this price.

34
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.740
I'm like,
what are you,
why are you always the hero and all of your stories?

35
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.600
What about me,
you know,
come my way a little bit.
I don't know.

36
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.280
He was so full of Shit.
Even his buddy,

37
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.810
he sat down and started laughing at one point,
but uh,
in the end,
in the end,
oh,

38
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:13.150
Billy freckles.
Oh,
Billy.
Red Face.
Still fucking paid.

39
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.300
I still pay talk.
Did I pay top dollar?
I don't know.
I don't know.

40
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:19.080
She already negotiated down.
I came in,

41
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:20.900
that came in halfway through the fucking thing.

42
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.710
I thought I watched a couple of fast and loud,
so I was like,
I can do this shit.

43
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.640
And I didn't.
I didn't really,
I thought I was Richard Rawlings.

44
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.250
I didn't realize that he was Richard Rawlings and I was at jerk off stated in my

45
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.084
driveway.

46
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.590
<v 0>Okay,</v>

47
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.950
<v 1>unreal.
I even did the cash to go do it.
I got cash.
Okay.</v>

48
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:39.230
You can either walk out with a rug,
a walkout with this cash.

49
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:41.510
You just kept going through it.
I can't do that.
I can't do that.
Ah,

50
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:45.380
you know what I should sell what?
I should've said that and I never did.

51
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.371
You know why?

52
00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:50.240
Because I hate shopping in the fucking rugs there and it's a rug and it's on the

53
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:54.360
floor and it's done.
I don't even know why I negotiated with them.

54
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:57.060
I just wanted to get on with my day.
What?
What is it?
How much does this cost?

55
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:00.150
Hair beat it.
So I feel like an asshole.

56
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.410
<v 2>If I could have just knocked him down $1,
I would have felt good.
God.</v>

57
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.250
Jesus Christ.
This is why I have representation.
You know what I mean?
This is,

58
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.430
this is,
this is the reason why.
So anyways,
who cares?

59
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.120
Who gives a fuck that I just got screwed in a rug?
Well,
I do,

60
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.020
but I'm gonna pretend like I don't,
cause I got this big tour coming up,
uh,

61
00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:23.910
the Billie Bible belt tour garment down through the deep south.
All right.

62
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:26.340
We're starting off in Savannah and then we're going up Knoxville,

63
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:29.390
Illinois of Chattanooga,
Memphis.
Then down Shreveport,
the knowns,

64
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.860
and then we're going to Hampton.

65
00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:33.810
Then we're going to more building going is the most shit.

66
00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:37.080
We ended up in Kentucky,
then Ebbets field,
then we go to the Kentucky Derby.

67
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.820
It's going to be great.
It's going to be a,

68
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.580
I'm gonna make sure I'd still work out.
Let me make sure I still work out,

69
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.940
you know what I mean?
And I,
I,
I'll booze at night.

70
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.540
I'm gonna try to not smoke a cigar,
the whole fucking thing.
All right.

71
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.390
I've had 12 cigars so far this year.
I figure if I can make it to June,

72
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:57.010
then I'm averaging two a month.
If I go the whole year,
rest of the fucking year,

73
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.730
then that was just once a month and then I'm all right.
You know,

74
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.060
trying to get him out of my life.
But every once in a while I got to tell you,
oh,

75
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:07.780
I got to tell you late at night,
late at nights when I always want one.
You know,

76
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.380
my wife will smoke the occasional cigarette,

77
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:12.670
which I'm trying to get her to stop doing,

78
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:14.390
but every once in a while she'd just down in the back porch,

79
00:04:14.391 --> 00:04:15.560
she's enjoying the cigarette and I,

80
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.340
it just makes me want to come out there and smoke with Stokey,

81
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.710
listen to hear the sound of my voice.
Do you know it just got com.

82
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.630
I just want to sit out there.
I just want to smoke this cigarette.
Um,

83
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.580
that's what I want to do and I'm there to try to avoid doing that.

84
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:31.330
But I've been going to the gym every single day and I think it finally,

85
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.390
I finally snapped the other day.
I was like,

86
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.030
did not want to go and I'm fighting,

87
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.180
pulling into like a fucking Mcdonald's or whatever and I'm just making myself

88
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:46.000
drive to the gym and I didn't think I was going to make it and I just started

89
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:49.000
singing this dumb song,
you know,

90
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.950
it started off in my accent going,
I go to the gym every day.

91
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.320
It's just become a part of my life.
And if you don't want to be your fatty,

92
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.720
you go to the gym every day.
You can't write,

93
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.250
just starts singing this song.
He gets a little louder.
Oh,

94
00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:12.480
I go to the gym every day you start banging.
It's just become a part of my life.

95
00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:15.550
Slam on the steer wheel little.
And if you don't want a big a patty,

96
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.920
by the time I got to the gym,

97
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.300
I am screaming the song with my windows rolled up,

98
00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:28.440
of course in some brutal hybrid English accent Australia.

99
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.410
I don't know what the fuck kind of accent it was.
Well,
I go to the gym every day,

100
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.370
you know,
Monday,
if you don't want to obey,
fade,
you go to the gym every day.

101
00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:42.780
You can't,
ah,
once I get in there,

102
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.120
once I get in there,
but the dude,
I fucking walk up the steps.

103
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.690
It's good walking music,
marching right up the steps,
the pop,
pop,
pop,
pop.

104
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.870
Once I stretch and I do the first set,
then I'm fine,
then I'm fine.

105
00:05:56.871 --> 00:05:58.010
But I tell you something,
I don't know what

106
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.770
<v 1>I've done.
I've,
I've passed a certain age where it's just,</v>

107
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:04.040
it's just sucks every time.
It used to be like,
all right,
sucks the first two,

108
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:07.190
three days and then I'm good.
This,
this,
this has not,

109
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.510
this is not been fun from the first day I got in there and a,

110
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:16.430
I am officially an old fuck.
It's driving me nuts.
So,
but,
um,
whatever,

111
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.760
whatever
fucking gym,

112
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:23.450
there's always that little guy that's allowed at the gym.
You know that guy,

113
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.440
the short guy,
he's got a fucking yell at somebody sees like 20 stations.

114
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.613
<v 0>Whoa.</v>

115
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.320
<v 1>You just want to be like,
dude,
we all see you.
Okay,</v>

116
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.840
we see you okay with your little outfit.

117
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.190
This is a little guy at the gym,
right?

118
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.670
Or I work out and he's always yelling over at people and he's making jokes and

119
00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:51.080
they're never funny and he doesn't have charisma.
And uh,

120
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.660
nobody's had the decency to tell him to shut up yet.

121
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.140
And it's this weird thing where I hate going to the fucking gym.

122
00:06:57.141 --> 00:07:01.550
So every day I feel like eventually it's going to be me.

123
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.230
If you'd like to,
why are you,
what was yelling?
Why he was yelling over at people,

124
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:10.970
you know,
just fucking put on your little Walkman.
Okay.

125
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.620
Do your little curls.
Hey,
get the fuck outta here.
You know,

126
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.140
does it really have to do with him with the fact that I don't want to be there?

127
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.400
Um,
I'm an old school gym guy.
You only day I liked his bench pressing though.

128
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:24.950
What are your pension?
That's the only thing that I pay attention to.

129
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:26.270
I don't pay attention to anything else.

130
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:30.160
So I've been doing pretty good with the legs,
the legs and eggs over there.
Um,

131
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.801
anyway,
so you know,

132
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:35.120
last week on the podcast and I know I'm brutally on the rag this week.
I'm sorry,

133
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.870
I apologize.
Uh,
is I told you guys if you want me to do a,

134
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:43.850
if you want me to talk about some shit,
um,
you know,
on the podcast,

135
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:48.660
you want me to just tweet it to Hashtag uh,
uh,

136
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.280
t a m m p Thursday afternoon,
Monday morning podcast.

137
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:53.540
And I gotta be honest with you,
actually,

138
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:56.720
people have sent me some really good stuff.
You know,

139
00:07:56.721 --> 00:08:00.110
I was watching some of that playoff hockey,
got a couple of hockey questions.

140
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:04.460
I was watching it by myself crying into my beer,
you know,

141
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.400
follow everybody's giving shit to the Bruins.
I mean,
we were only like within,

142
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.270
we were like within 10 points of the fucking Canadians,
15 points.
It's not like,

143
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:14.660
wait,
was that fucking bad?
You know,
a couple,
two,
three,

144
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:19.100
seven games go the other way.
I mean,
we're,
we w we fucking won the division.

145
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.670
Um,
so anyways,
I watched it yesterday.
Um,

146
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.740
I watched some of the Montreal Ottawa game.
Regrettably,

147
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:30.970
I missed the second period,
but,
uh,

148
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.980
we're all the goals and all the action happened and I couldn't believe they

149
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:37.010
fucking kicked out PK.
Man,
that was bullshit.
I mean,

150
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:40.100
that was your classic two handers sit down for five minutes.

151
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.900
I'm just going to say what everybody else said,

152
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:44.420
but I actually agreed with that and I fucking hate the Canadians and I got it.

153
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.013
<v 0>Oh No.</v>

154
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.300
<v 0>If we can pick the Canadian,</v>

156
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.330
<v 1>but you gotta think,
man,
that was the time,
you know,</v>

157
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.980
they fucking home ice,
they had to do it.
They didn't get,

158
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:02.450
they didn't get it done.
They didn't get it done.
You know why?
Cause they're,

159
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.330
they're a quaint little city with a cute little river and they're happy.

160
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.990
That's the one thing I got when I was down in Ottawa.
There was satisfied.

161
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.280
They had this cute little town.

162
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:14.700
They were still considered the capital for some reason and you know,

163
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.680
it was a nice,
nice life down there.
You know,
you get up to Montreal,

164
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.390
everybody walking around with a carnation and they're fucking college.

165
00:09:23.391 --> 00:09:27.420
It's really just trying to be somebody in their lapel,
I should say that color,

166
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.430
you know?
You know,

167
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:33.390
it's funny as I'm hell actually some Canadian fans actually really get pissed

168
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:37.350
off for me,
given these stupid little little fucking jabs.
And I'm like,

169
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:39.780
someone's going to go bill.
You think Canadians fans that dumb.

170
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:41.880
You didn't even know the kings were in the fucking playoffs.

171
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.490
That's trivial horseshit.

172
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.510
1516 x got gotta be an even number 16 fucking teams make the playoffs.

173
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.220
I was busy.

174
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.330
You're telling me the fact that I didn't know that the kings weren't in the

175
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:59.280
playoffs is worse than you guys booing the greatest goalie of the last 30 years

176
00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:03.270
out of your building,
causing you to never win another Stanley Cup sense.

177
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:05.880
You realize you're on a fucking 22 year drought.

178
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.190
Oh my God.
I hope that fucking keeps going this year.
That would really,

179
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.880
really make my fucking year.
If the Canadians lose again,

180
00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:16.770
it would just be fucking tremendous.
Be Tremendous.

181
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:18.300
Although I think they got a decent shot.

182
00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:22.650
I was watching some of the West and another black hawks don't seem like the old

183
00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:25.590
Blackhawks.
The kings aren't in it.
Who the fuck has left?

184
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.290
I think this is the biggest chance to win a cup and a long fucking time.
Well,

185
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:33.630
I guess we want it in 2011 but you know what I mean?
They just,

186
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.810
they just had juggernauts out there and even as shit crybaby teams like the

187
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.620
Vancouver Canucks even,
they were halfway decent.
Right.
Um,

188
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.300
and I'll still say they cry babies as long as long as,
I don't know,

189
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.280
as long as burrows is still there.
The Sidis sisters,
whatever the file,

190
00:10:50.281 --> 00:10:52.110
you know all those guys who could beat the shit out of me.

191
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.610
Oh,
tough on his podcast,
Billy.
Um,
so anyways,
I watched a,

192
00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:04.230
I actually watched the Black Hawks and predators.
Oh,
and by the way,

193
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.620
the Canucks fucking goalie,
that helmets,

194
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:11.010
the greatest thing I've seen in a hockey in a long time,
that's just phenomenal.

195
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:14.250
I don't know what the fuck that is.
Is that little,

196
00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:17.550
a little fucking gun safe that he put a fucking visor on,

197
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.910
just carved out the middle of the thing.
I don't even know what it is.

198
00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:23.370
It's the ugliest thing I've ever seen in my life and I love it.

199
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.370
He should wear that thing his entire career.

200
00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:31.320
Never get the team colors and just understand that it's just a business.

201
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.630
You know what I mean?
I'm not trying to do any fucking Rah Rah sis.

202
00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:37.710
Boom Bah horse shit.

203
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:40.820
I'm just here to stop pucks and they're going to hit me in the head and they're

204
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:42.720
going to mark up the beautiful paint job anyway.

205
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.560
So why don't I just paint it the color of the fucking puck and I'll stand here

206
00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:50.160
and let you shoot shit at me until I get trade.
That's what I got out of it.

207
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:52.680
I'm sure there's probably some story about a war hero in there,

208
00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:57.400
but I know I didn't look it up.
I didn't fuck it.
Look it up.
Um,
so anyway,

209
00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:00.060
somebody asked me,
um,

210
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.630
Hawk a holic uh,

211
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:08.690
asked me a Haka holic 27 asked me how about Nashville only selling tickets to

212
00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:13.510
Tennessee residents to keep hawk fans out of their building.
Um,

213
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.920
I don't know why they don't do that anyways.
Go Fuck Yourself.

214
00:12:16.921 --> 00:12:19.110
You want to go to a hawks game?
Go to one in Chicago.

215
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.820
I don't understand why they got,
especially if you're in Nashville,
you know,

216
00:12:23.821 --> 00:12:25.840
everybody there had some line dancing to go to.

217
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:30.360
So the place place would have been overrun by Hawk fans.
You know,

218
00:12:30.361 --> 00:12:31.400
somebody day they end up,
they,

219
00:12:31.401 --> 00:12:36.401
their half their fan base had to lose in a line dancing contest just so they

220
00:12:36.571 --> 00:12:38.670
would be available that night to go to game one.

221
00:12:38.671 --> 00:12:42.000
So they had to hold onto those tickets and wait to the till the sammies were

222
00:12:42.001 --> 00:12:45.210
over.
Um,
I don't have a problem with that.

223
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.730
I would love to see that happen,

224
00:12:47.731 --> 00:12:51.450
especially for Canadian fans because a Montreal Canadien fans,
they,

225
00:12:51.451 --> 00:12:53.550
I always thought they traveled because they were great fans.

226
00:12:53.551 --> 00:12:58.530
But I guess most of them can't afford to go to a home game.
Um,
I guess,

227
00:12:58.531 --> 00:12:58.771
you know,

228
00:12:58.771 --> 00:13:01.380
they don't have a lot of money up there and times are tough and you know,

229
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:05.490
when you blow it all on loafers in a blue sport coats or whatever the fuck it is

230
00:13:05.491 --> 00:13:09.090
that they were,
they always dress like they go into parliament,
you know.
Um,

231
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.120
so I would love to see that happen.
It's f fuck you.
It's our building.

232
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.340
It's our building we can sell to who we want to.

233
00:13:17.341 --> 00:13:19.980
I think it's great that they did it.
The,
the cheesy,

234
00:13:19.981 --> 00:13:24.450
let's all wear the same color t shirt.
Um,
um,
I'm not a fan of that,

235
00:13:24.451 --> 00:13:26.490
but uh,
what ads kind of weak,

236
00:13:26.491 --> 00:13:31.491
but don't you think it was better though than all those Predator fans?

237
00:13:31.501 --> 00:13:33.630
Got To watch that team blow a three goal lead?

238
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.840
That's one of the things I don't know who I'm for and that series because I

239
00:13:36.841 --> 00:13:39.470
really liked the black hawks,
but I also,
I always like,
uh,

240
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.380
I say an underdog but I guess Nashville is his right as ranked higher.

241
00:13:43.381 --> 00:13:48.120
But come on,
come on Black Hawks if want to this decade they know what to do.

242
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.900
All right.
So any predictions in the playoffs?
No,
not really.

243
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.870
I don't have any predictions because I barely watch this year cause I was really

244
00:13:54.871 --> 00:13:58.170
busy.
Um,
although I watched pretty much most of the Bronx,

245
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:04.410
the tragedy of the Bruins.
Alright,
in reply to the podcast,
this guy says,

246
00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:08.940
Bill,
here's a new way to get a flat stomach Italian doctor's plan.

247
00:14:08.941 --> 00:14:13.830
The first human head transplant,
I swear to God this,
I can't say this is true.

248
00:14:13.831 --> 00:14:18.780
It's on the Internet.
It's on medical,
what does it,
medical news today.

249
00:14:18.781 --> 00:14:19.614
Dot Com.

250
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:20.790
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

251
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.450
<v 1>30 year old Russian man volunteers for the first,
uh,</v>

252
00:14:24.451 --> 00:14:29.310
for world's first human head transplant.
And basically this guy has some,

253
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.660
a horrific disease,
uh,
where he's lost control of his body.

254
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.823
Um,

255
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:35.740
<v 3>okay.</v>

256
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.650
<v 1>So he's like,
fuck it.
Why don't I get a new body?</v>

257
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.940
Can you imagine if they pull this off?
Like I don't understand that.

258
00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:45.840
How they're going to
chop the head off

259
00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.060
and keep like,
think about that.
Okay.
As far as

260
00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.560
<v 3>my little know the anatomy,</v>

261
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:57.280
every right now is everybody right now knowing I'm going waiting into these deep

262
00:14:57.281 --> 00:14:59.860
waters right now.
She'd just be sitting there going,
Oh gee,
gee,
Gee,

263
00:14:59.861 --> 00:15:02.010
go drag God love him.
He had me.
Um,

264
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.120
<v 1>don't you have one intake hose?</v>

265
00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.950
The one outtake hose and like your brain's like a radiator,
right?

266
00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.350
And the intake is like oxygenated blood.

267
00:15:11.351 --> 00:15:15.040
And then the other shit coming out is that,
that's your blue blood right bound.

268
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.900
Now man,
amp,
amp and Ama now,
sorry,
Jack Black,
not Jack Black.

269
00:15:19.901 --> 00:15:24.760
Jack White's,
sorry.
Um,
isn't that how it works?
So you basically,

270
00:15:24.761 --> 00:15:29.350
you got to sever one of them.
I'd figure you'd sever the outtake first,
right?

271
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.320
To have,
you know,
and then what do you got to do?

272
00:15:32.321 --> 00:15:36.670
You've got to hook that up to some sort of other machine that has a,

273
00:15:36.671 --> 00:15:38.800
that's for the,
that's the outtake blood.

274
00:15:38.801 --> 00:15:40.270
And then you got to do the other one for the end.

275
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.380
I don't know how to fuck are you going to do that?
It's going to be messy.

276
00:15:44.381 --> 00:15:47.950
Is I want to know how to fuck they're gonna even try to do this.

277
00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.250
You ever see somebody gets stabbed in a jug?
You'll just in the movies,

278
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.710
it's fucking insane if,
forget about an hockey,

279
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.490
you know when somebody comes in with a skate and catches a guy and it just

280
00:15:57.491 --> 00:16:01.900
starts going out like a sprinkler and they even say they just nicked the
juggler,

281
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.790
right?
Anyways,
so they're going to do this.
Now if they actually pull this off,

282
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:11.440
this is some shit where you could potentially,
you're talking about like,

283
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:16.790
I dunno if you could live forever,
um,

284
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.680
because your brain's still fucking old,
right?
That becomes the problem.

285
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.620
But if your body is,
is,
is uh,
is messed up,
well,

286
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:27.191
wait a minute,
I'm not,

287
00:16:27.191 --> 00:16:29.860
other than the obvious fucking question should be is who's the guy going to give

288
00:16:29.861 --> 00:16:30.694
up his body

289
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.000
playing fucking musical chairs with the rest of your fucking torso there?

290
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:37.870
Let me read this here a little bit.
Ah,

291
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.300
this guy says I can hardly control my body.
Now he said,
I need help every day,

292
00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:44.010
every minute.
I am now 30 years old,

293
00:16:44.011 --> 00:16:46.800
although people rarely live to be more than 20 with this disease.

294
00:16:46.801 --> 00:16:49.030
So this guy's crushing it.
All right?

295
00:16:49.031 --> 00:16:53.850
Don't donor body will be attached to recipients head through spinal cord fusion.

296
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.650
What
doctor,

297
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.060
I can't even say the name of the doctor told CNN he received an array of emails

298
00:17:04.061 --> 00:17:06.550
and letters from people asking to be considered for the procedure,

299
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:11.470
many of which have been from transgender individuals seeking a new body.

300
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.050
Jesus Christ.

301
00:17:14.051 --> 00:17:18.730
Just when you thought like having your Dick remove was like the most like x

302
00:17:18.731 --> 00:17:21.790
games thing you can do as far as like an operation.
These,

303
00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:23.260
these guys are saying fuck it.

304
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:28.000
Cut My head off and put it on the opposite sex.
His body.

305
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:33.820
Jesus Christ.
I me Dang it.
This is like,

306
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.150
this is like Nazi doctor Shit.
This is fucking insane.

307
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.310
How the hell are you going to do that?

308
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.330
<v 4>I can't wrap my head around it.</v>

309
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.970
<v 1>Um,
however the surgeon says the first people undergo the procedure will be those</v>

310
00:17:44.971 --> 00:17:48.670
with muscular wasting condition.
Like this uh,

311
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.320
spirit spirit don't have the procedure which is estimated to take a hundred

312
00:17:54.951 --> 00:17:55.784
surgeons.

313
00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.093
<v 5>Gotcha.</v>

314
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.110
<v 1>100 surgeons around 36 hours to complete.</v>

315
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:09.140
How the fuck are they going to all be around the table?
What are they going to,

316
00:18:09.141 --> 00:18:10.740
I guess cause it's got to be 24,

317
00:18:10.741 --> 00:18:15.740
seven do this is going to be like line changes in hockey except was surgeons,

318
00:18:15.741 --> 00:18:19.920
the surgeons coming over the fucking boards except they were sleeping.
Come on,

319
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:24.540
you're up.
You're up.
Oh boy.
What,
where are we at?
Uh,
let's see.

320
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:28.830
The procedure which is going to take an estimated 100 surgeons around 36 hours

321
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:32.730
to complete will involve spinal cord fusion.

322
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.160
Scf for those in the business,

323
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:40.490
the head from a donor body will be removed using an ultra sharp blade in order

324
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:44.400
to live yet limit the amount of damage.
Right.
Damage to the spinal cord.

325
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.120
It's just,
I don't even think about that.
You're severing a spinal cord

326
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.040
now wait a minute.
If they can do that,
then they just cure paralysis.

327
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.450
How can you cut the fucking court on one guy and then stick it on another walk?

328
00:18:57.451 --> 00:19:01.530
Cause you already have all the stuff.
Was that too technical?
Few guys.

329
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:05.190
Jesus Christ.
All right.
This is like on fast and loud.

330
00:19:05.191 --> 00:19:09.580
When they took a fucking 2015 scad cat and they,
they,

331
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:14.590
they took the guts out of that and put it in the 71 except way harder.

332
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.970
Oh Geez.
Let's continue.

333
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:22.830
The spinal cord of the donor will be of the donor body will then be fused with

334
00:19:22.831 --> 00:19:27.810
the spinal cord of the recipients head.
Oh,

335
00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:29.370
so they'd just taken the spinal cord.

336
00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:33.180
I thought they were taking the whole body chemicals called Perry.

337
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.793
I don't even try.

338
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:40.090
I called officer can be used to encourage spinal cord fusion according to Doctor

339
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:47.400
[inaudible],
the muscles and blood supply will then be sutured.

340
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.590
Oh,
so you mean when like he essentially bleeds out.

341
00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:54.540
You're then going to suture to,
what

342
00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.410
do please.
If they televise this,

343
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.380
I will watch all 36 hours.

344
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:04.610
<v 3>Okay.</v>

345
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.360
<v 1>I will watch all 36 hours of how in the fuck you're going to cut somebody's head</v>

346
00:20:08.361 --> 00:20:12.950
off
at adds.
Unbelievable.
Okay.

347
00:20:12.951 --> 00:20:16.280
The recipient will,
will be kept in a coma for around three to four weeks.

348
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:22.680
Said doctor [inaudible] during which time the spinal cord will be subject to

349
00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:27.390
electrical stimulation via implanted electrodes in order to put,
this can't be,

350
00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.460
let me get this straight.
They can't cure cancer,
but this guy's this,

351
00:20:33.461 --> 00:20:38.170
this can't be real.
The surgeon estimates that with the help of physical therapy,

352
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.080
the patient would be able to walk within one year.

353
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.340
The fucking dude with the disease says he is worried undergo there was asked if

354
00:20:48.341 --> 00:20:52.660
he was worried.
Am I afraid?
Yes,
of course I am.
But it is not it,

355
00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:56.230
but it is not just very scary but also very interesting.

356
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.140
I mean,
I would watch it.
I don't think I would do it.

357
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.950
<v 3>Okay.</v>

358
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:03.611
<v 1>Now wait a minute.</v>

359
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:07.600
If they actually are able to do this then that those cryogenics people are
right.

360
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.340
And next thing you know,
Ted Williams,
unknown unknown lists.

361
00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:16.280
Ted Williams could be walking around.
All right.
There you go.

362
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:17.990
All right.
There he did.

363
00:21:17.991 --> 00:21:21.650
You did you laugh hard enough at me for sounding that fucking stupid.
All right,

364
00:21:21.651 --> 00:21:24.710
Bill,
how about a rant about people complaining about Brady's first pitch?

365
00:21:24.711 --> 00:21:25.790
You know what?
I didn't see it.

366
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.600
I would guess the reason why the pitch didn't make it to home plate was because

367
00:21:29.601 --> 00:21:33.340
of those four rings on his throwing finger.
Huh?

368
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.140
What are you people just going to admit?
He's better looking than you.

369
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.120
He has more championships than you.

370
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.420
He's taller than you and he has a better look and wife than you.

371
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:45.920
It's fucking over game set.
Match straight sets.

372
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

373
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:52.210
<v 1>You didn't return one ball.
He aced you every fucking game you lost.</v>

374
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.720
Six love six love six.
Love

375
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:02.020
the ball was always in chalk was always flying up when he was serving.

376
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.190
Um,
what do you think about it?
I don't give a shit.
He's a quarterback.

377
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:10.270
He's not supposed to be able to throw a baseball.
Okay.
He throws a man size ball,

378
00:22:10.271 --> 00:22:14.680
not that little fucking beanbag that those guys are throwing.
All right.
Um,

379
00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.360
you guys are really going with some heavy shit here.
Fill this will,
uh,

380
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.810
this will get your brain cord twisting thoughts,
earth's magnetic reversal.

381
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.870
Uh,
yeah,
this,
this,
you know what,
I'll post this video.

382
00:22:26.871 --> 00:22:31.790
This is a video about how the,
the north and South Poles are now moving,

383
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.020
which is really pissing me off as I'm learning about aviation and all this shit.

384
00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:39.200
I'm finally figuring out the difference between true north and magnetic north

385
00:22:39.201 --> 00:22:40.340
and all this type of shit.
And every,

386
00:22:40.341 --> 00:22:44.420
evidently not only other polls going to shift.
So compass is what work.

387
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:49.100
The atmosphere is just not going to be able to,
we're just going to disappear.
Um,

388
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.941
I gotta be honest with you.

389
00:22:49.941 --> 00:22:53.060
I don't give a shit that the earth's magnetic poles are reversing.

390
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:54.500
<v 3>Okay.</v>

391
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:59.010
<v 1>Or moving towards one another.
I could completely give a shit for the,</v>

392
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.240
I wish that they weren't,
but,
um,

393
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.080
there's nothing I can do about it.
That's like when people sit there and go,
dude,

394
00:23:06.081 --> 00:23:08.510
you live on top of a super volcano.

395
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:13.310
I think that is super fantastic.
And if it goes off,

396
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:17.210
I'm not even going to know what happened as opposed to you guys who will be

397
00:23:17.211 --> 00:23:20.780
living in some,
I don't know what you'll,
you'll be,
you'll look at,

398
00:23:20.781 --> 00:23:24.650
you'll watch the sun disappear for the last time in your life is what's going to

399
00:23:24.651 --> 00:23:26.420
happen is you,
you're under that fucking

400
00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:32.390
clouds of ash and everything dies.
I mean,
I don't want to be part of that.

401
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.470
You got it.
But you have to watch,

402
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:40.770
you gotta watch this youtube video and just the fucking,

403
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.020
the level of egg shit going on there.
If you're better man than me,
if

404
00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:50.730
<v 2>you can watch that whole video and not hate the person that did the,
the,
uh,</v>

405
00:23:50.731 --> 00:23:52.560
the voiceover,
you know,

406
00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.740
not be so insecure that you fucking don't hate the person that did the voiceover

407
00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.270
because the dude was annoying the shit out of me.
Um,

408
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:02.130
<v 3>yeah.</v>

409
00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.980
<v 2>You know what I mean?
Like doctors over here at blue,</v>

410
00:24:04.981 --> 00:24:06.960
that theory out of the water.
Oh,

411
00:24:06.961 --> 00:24:10.110
did they guy who made the video and didn't do any fucking research?

412
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.940
I'm all right.
Sorry.
Hey Bill,
do a rant on Bait Click ads.

413
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.960
The ones that say he did this and you won't believe what was next.
Yeah,

414
00:24:18.961 --> 00:24:22.620
I fell for that for about 40 times.
Uh,
first 40 times.
I don't,
I don't,

415
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.460
I deliberately do not click on those anymore.

416
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:31.350
They're fucking annoying as shit.
And uh,
oh my God.

417
00:24:31.351 --> 00:24:36.351
Trying to find like the be the top or those ones that go like the top worst nose

418
00:24:36.811 --> 00:24:38.910
jobs ever.
And you're like,
all right,
let me look at these.

419
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.350
And then you get to the first photo and there's like no fucking way it seems to

420
00:24:43.351 --> 00:24:46.530
get to the next one without clicking on a fucking ad for a Buick or something.

421
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.680
I can't believe advertisers are paying for that.

422
00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:55.780
Like I can't remember anything I've ever seen.
And if I did,
I,

423
00:24:55.781 --> 00:24:58.630
I wouldn't buy it because it was annoying the way I found out about it.

424
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.290
But you know,
it's funny,
there's this theory in advertising like,
you know,

425
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:07.880
you don't remember it,
but your subconscious remembers it.
Ooh,
right.

426
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.450
Such bullshit.
But you know what,
if it puts fucking fool loops on the table,

427
00:25:11.451 --> 00:25:13.430
God bless him.
God bless him.

428
00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:14.730
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

429
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:15.660
<v 2>Um,
Bill,</v>

430
00:25:15.661 --> 00:25:20.190
please give us a take on today's fight for 15 protests.

431
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.780
People just microwave poisonous food.
Want $15 an hour.

432
00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:29.670
I don't know what fight for 15 is.
Is that for $15 an hour?

433
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:35.760
I don't give a shit when people,
uh,
you know,
poor people want more money.

434
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:39.690
I don't,
that does not bother me as much as,
unless that lazy,
you know,

435
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.860
and they're not doing a good job,

436
00:25:40.861 --> 00:25:44.310
microwave and the food and then they should just get fired,
you know?

437
00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.980
But if you're actually busting your aspect,

438
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.630
I don't give a fuck that you want money.
You know,

439
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.880
I don't give a shit that they want Ronald to fucking undo the purse strings.

440
00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:59.190
You know,
I bought all the rich content at the top.

441
00:25:59.191 --> 00:26:03.810
This is why I'll never understand republicans is their hatred of the poor.

442
00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.270
You know,
I'll never understand it.
I'm not saying I,

443
00:26:07.271 --> 00:26:09.720
I actually like Democrats either.

444
00:26:09.721 --> 00:26:13.020
I don't like Democrats as far as politicians go because they try to act like

445
00:26:13.021 --> 00:26:16.500
they're the friends of people of the middleclass important than not.

446
00:26:16.501 --> 00:26:17.700
It's like you the same fucking guy.

447
00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:21.180
You sitting down eating the same God damn dinner,
five grand a fucking plate.

448
00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.570
All right,
you're in bread with the same fucking people,
so go fuck yourself.

449
00:26:24.571 --> 00:26:27.270
So there's more of an honesty with Republicans,

450
00:26:27.271 --> 00:26:32.250
but I just don't understand why they hate the fucking poor.
Why they blame them.

451
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:33.620
<v 3>Okay.</v>

452
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.590
<v 2>For everything.
It's just fucking around.</v>

453
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:37.340
I mean you've got a small group of fucking concept.

454
00:26:37.341 --> 00:26:41.450
The topic literally turned out food supply and poison and these idiots would

455
00:26:41.451 --> 00:26:44.500
rather rant about personalities,
which is a fucking kills me God.

456
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:48.670
Damn apple causes will cause cancer.
I guarantee you in the future,

457
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.770
the ones that don't turn brown cause these guys are fucking with them cause this

458
00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:57.040
sick and not making all the money on all the fucking apples.
I just,
I don't know,

459
00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.990
I am such a fucking pessimists.

460
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:03.040
I actually think that it's great that the atmosphere is going to be sucked out

461
00:27:03.041 --> 00:27:04.330
of the planet and we're all going to die.

462
00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:08.140
I think it's a tremendous fucking thing.
It needs to happen,
right?

463
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:13.300
Don't you think?
Come on,
be honest,
haven't we?
We kind of played out.

464
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.040
I think human beings at this point.

465
00:27:15.041 --> 00:27:17.800
Do you know that band that just keeps touring,
playing there?
Hit?

466
00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:22.970
I think that that's where we're at right now.
You know what I mean?
We're like,
uh,

467
00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.930
what was that?
That's that band.
Big country.
You know,

468
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:29.680
there's probably still somewhere right now singing in a big country.

469
00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.480
[inaudible] stay with you.
I go to La,

470
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.880
that's actually a great song and I'm lead singer killed himself,
but you know,

471
00:27:39.881 --> 00:27:41.980
you know,
you know the,
the breast of the band still going.

472
00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:45.040
They're still playing that fucking song,
right?

473
00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:50.350
You got some guy that just sounds like him,
but he's like Filipino.

474
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:55.720
Was that journey?
I have no idea.
Anyways,
but winding down here,

475
00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.260
what else do we got here?
Oh God,
it's disgusting.

476
00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:02.260
Picture of some hot chick laying next to a dead giraffe that you just shot.

477
00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.280
Ricky Gervais' trasher and uh,

478
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.120
she tried to say that it was dying anyways in the villagers wanted her to kill

479
00:28:12.121 --> 00:28:16.190
it.
That doesn't,
that just sound like a bunch of bullshit.
Like,
oh,

480
00:28:16.191 --> 00:28:18.440
they wanted you to kill it.
They couldn't kill it themselves.

481
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.400
They only live out there and they've just been sitting there forever in the

482
00:28:22.401 --> 00:28:23.600
middle of the Africa going,
Gee,

483
00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:26.330
I wish some white lady would show up and kill a giraffe for us.

484
00:28:26.331 --> 00:28:28.820
We're really hungry.
I don't believe in that.

485
00:28:28.821 --> 00:28:33.140
I think she just likes killing big shit and then doing a stupid photo next to
it.

486
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.330
I don't understand people that go out and kill lions.

487
00:28:35.331 --> 00:28:37.730
I think you're a fucking asshole if you do that.

488
00:28:37.731 --> 00:28:42.050
Even if you shoot a bear and unless the bear is wandering into a the

489
00:28:42.051 --> 00:28:46.430
neighborhood,
you know what I mean?
I don't understand how you can go out,

490
00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.580
go ahead and go shoot a deer.
I don't give a fuck.
This is a zillion of them.

491
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.610
I guess if there's a lot of bear,
you've got to shoot them too.
But I mean,

492
00:28:52.611 --> 00:28:54.260
I know there's not a lot of lions.

493
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.370
You got to shoot one and then stand on it and show it's fucking teeth.

494
00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:00.750
I just don't,
I don't,
um,

495
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:04.130
I respect the skill of hunting as far as,

496
00:29:04.131 --> 00:29:07.500
I feel like people should know how to do it,
but I that whole,
uh,

497
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:12.260
posing with the animal after you shot it,
like,
you know,

498
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.880
you guys just had a bare knuckle fight and you fucking knock that out.
I mean,

499
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.970
just the amount of shit you ever watched,
the hunting channel,

500
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.910
he's fucking assholes.
They got like a,

501
00:29:22.911 --> 00:29:27.320
they got like a loft apartment up in a tree covered in the urine of the animal

502
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.420
and then they got this little fucking Kazoo.

503
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.930
It sounds just like a fucking turtle or whatever.
Right?
I mean,

504
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.960
how much more can the game be rigged just fucking sitting?

505
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.830
You've got all this fucking state of the yard.
Shit do.

506
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:47.950
We are the most evil animal on the planet and I know I'm part of it.

507
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.240
I know I'm a fucking part of it.

508
00:29:49.241 --> 00:29:52.270
The shit that we do to animals is absolutely horrific.

509
00:29:52.271 --> 00:29:53.980
Now I will always be a mediator.

510
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:59.300
So the way I justify my eval is I try to,
I just try to eat chickens.

511
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:04.270
I eat fucking cows.
Uh,
pigs.

512
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.060
Yeah.
And I don't give a fuck about pigs,
cows and chickens.

513
00:30:08.061 --> 00:30:11.150
I feel bad for it because they'd never eat meat,
but a pig,
a pig would eat me.

514
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.320
I've watched enough movies,

515
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:15.670
Hollywood movies that are based on nothing but horseshit,
uh,

516
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:19.550
to know that that's actually a true thing.
That if,
you know,
if you killed me,

517
00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:21.400
you could feed me.
Do a pig,
right?

518
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.490
Pigs need eight to go to the gym every day.
Um,

519
00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:31.370
oh,
Jesus.
Yeah.
I,
I just,
there's no need for that.

520
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:33.301
There's no need for it.

521
00:30:33.301 --> 00:30:37.100
It's just something fucking annoying about laying there with a big stupid grin

522
00:30:37.101 --> 00:30:39.350
on your face.
Although I will say she's Kinda hot.

523
00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.880
She looks like a Pan Am stewardess to me way back in the day.
Coffee,

524
00:30:43.881 --> 00:30:45.950
tea or me,
remember that shit.
You could actually,

525
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.890
you could actually fuck a waitress back in the day.

526
00:30:48.891 --> 00:30:51.440
A mirror was a little kid seeing it go down.
And I'd be like,
Mommy,

527
00:30:51.441 --> 00:30:53.600
what's going on there?
And she'd be like,
son,
uh,

528
00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:57.070
he's in first class and you have to understand that they get extra,
uh,

529
00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.190
extra perks.
And I said,
well,
next time can we fly first class?

530
00:31:01.191 --> 00:31:03.770
And she just looked straight ahead and shook her head.

531
00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:08.630
And that was the last time I talked to my mother.
Um,
all right,

532
00:31:08.631 --> 00:31:09.464
what do we got here?

533
00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.400
Woman fattened up by boyfriend to deter rivals.

534
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.900
Says yes to marriage proposal after two years of binge eating.

535
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.120
Oh my God,
that's not true.
Jealous Boyfriend.

536
00:31:24.121 --> 00:31:27.660
Fatten up girlfriend to put off any love rivals.

537
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:32.250
I'm calling bullshit on this one.
If this was true,

538
00:31:32.251 --> 00:31:37.251
wouldn't that be a bunch of fucking women's groups stomping around and

539
00:31:37.411 --> 00:31:42.090
complaining and making up Horse Shit and then having to fucking apologize for
it.

540
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:42.953
You know what I mean?

541
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.940
That's the one thing about the woman's movement at this point.
They're literally,

542
00:31:46.941 --> 00:31:49.200
they,
they've,
they've been bitching for so long.

543
00:31:49.201 --> 00:31:52.680
I think they're getting dangerously close to just having to make up shit.

544
00:31:52.681 --> 00:31:56.850
So this is,
this is seeming like this is part of it.
I chew.

545
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.860
Oh my God,
that's fucking hilarious.
Instead of saying,
I do,
they wrote,
I chew.

546
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.010
Oh,
it's Daily Mail.
Those clients who like to make up shit,

547
00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.340
I don't believe a fucking word of this woman who was fattened up by jealous

548
00:32:11.341 --> 00:32:14.400
boyfriend and deter love rivals says yes to marriage proposal.

549
00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:19.500
After two years of binge eating,
Yantai weighed just over two,

550
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.400
just over seven stone.
Oh,
is that what she weighed?
What the fuck is with England?

551
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.290
Can you fucking get a God damn number in there?

552
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:29.940
When she began dating seven stone,
how many sticks did she wait?

553
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:34.650
Couple of fags.
Um,
by two years on and she was,

554
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:38.340
she has ballooned to almost double her weight.

555
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:43.640
You splashed out on meals every day in a plea.
What?
Oh,
you is?

556
00:32:43.641 --> 00:32:47.390
The guy's name should say young daily meals.
The fucking worst.

557
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:52.190
You know what they type the way I read.
Um,
all right,

558
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:56.540
let's get off of this fucking thing.
Where are we?
Let's go back there.
Uh,
well,

559
00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:58.700
you know,
she is a,
uh,

560
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.350
she is a human being and she has the ability to say a no thank you.
I'm full.

561
00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:08.090
So that's on her and that's not blaming the victim there.

562
00:33:08.091 --> 00:33:10.670
That's empowering the victim where you know,
you're the deal.

563
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.180
You have the ability to say,
listen,
I'm done with this shit.

564
00:33:14.181 --> 00:33:18.110
I need to get on a treadmill.
Okay,
I don't want any more orange chicken.

565
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.760
All right now fuck off.
Then she's so fat.

566
00:33:22.761 --> 00:33:24.910
You can't hear it cause it like a cheeks are so close to death.

567
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:27.263
<v 0>Oh.</v>

568
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.960
<v 2>And he's like,
I'm sorry I can't understand you.</v>

569
00:33:32.961 --> 00:33:36.680
Is he sticking another fucking dumpling?
I swear to God.

570
00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:41.450
I find if I dated it,
authentic Asian woman,
by authentic,

571
00:33:41.451 --> 00:33:44.360
I mean from,
from,
from the motherland.
Okay.

572
00:33:44.361 --> 00:33:46.550
And she could throw down with dumplings that we have to be over.

573
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:51.980
You think I got a big head now.
It'd be fucking over.
When I was in Hong Kong.

574
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:52.641
I might tell you something,

575
00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:57.590
that dim sum I went to with some of the best fucking food I've ever had in my

576
00:33:57.591 --> 00:34:01.100
life.
You know what I mean?
You ever had chicken and dumplings?

577
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.450
It's an insult to the way that the dumplings are made over in Asia.

578
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.570
It was incredible.
I would be,
well,
I guess that wouldn't be fat.

579
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.890
Nobody was really fat over there.

580
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.550
<v 0>How do they do it?
Oh Dude,
go blue.</v>

581
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.510
<v 2>Um,
all right,
nick.
Daisy</v>

582
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:23.690
says a German came in second to Bruce Jenner at the 76 Olympics.

583
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:28.430
How do you think he's handling Bruce's journey out?
Gives a fuck.

584
00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:30.223
What are you saying?
Cause he,

585
00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:35.010
he lost to a guy wants to be a woman or if he's actually like at enough,

586
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:39.020
he has issues with that.
I mean,
can you just reconcile it with that?
He was a man.

587
00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.400
He was a man when he did it.
Right.
Does that means anything?

588
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.850
I don't fucking,
I don't even know.
You know,

589
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.940
that's one of those fucking questions.
Say you just,
you just,

590
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:52.310
this one of those things you can't joke about in a bar,

591
00:34:52.311 --> 00:34:54.110
but if you actually put it on Twitter,
then it becomes,

592
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.820
<v 0>it's like,
what are you saying?
Are you saying that people can't?
Huh?</v>

593
00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:00.080
<v 2>Um,
all right.</v>

594
00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:05.090
The old men at the gym who use blow dryers to dry their junk.

595
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.570
What do I tell them?
Or they just blow in junk stuff into the locker room.

596
00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.020
I don't know what to tell you.
I think I already addressed that one.

597
00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.690
I want to do one more here and then I got to get the fuck outta here.

598
00:35:14.691 --> 00:35:17.480
I gotta get on with my day and you guys can then listen to some classic clips

599
00:35:17.481 --> 00:35:21.030
from the FM podcast that goes back to 2007 Ah,

600
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:25.370
why don't we come up with you with today.
All tongue tied Billy today.

601
00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:29.090
Um,
hey old Billy slap shot.

602
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:32.600
How about a rant about the islanders moving to Brooklyn?
Yeah,

603
00:35:32.601 --> 00:35:36.080
I don't understand why that has to happen.
I think what happened was there was,

604
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:38.430
they built that Barclays Center,

605
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.130
<v 1>whatever the fuck it's called and then all of a sudden Nassau Coliseum started</v>

606
00:35:42.131 --> 00:35:47.020
looking like an old car and they wanted him to leave.
I think it stinks.

607
00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.140
I think it's cool that the islanders are out there.

608
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:51.490
Everything that was cool about hockey's just going away,

609
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.340
like just the weird places that they had teams.

610
00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.240
<v 2>You know what I mean?
I just back in the day,
do you realize back in the day,</v>

611
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.820
Boston,
Quebec,
Montreal,

612
00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:10.170
buffalo in Hartford,
you could drive,
I mean,

613
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:12.500
whatever.
Montreal,
Quebec,
we're a little bit of a drive,

614
00:36:12.501 --> 00:36:15.500
but they were all within like a fucking 45 minute flight of each other.

615
00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.400
They were all bunched up right there,
right

616
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.960
<v 1>monetary.
The Canadians,
the Nordiques,
the Bruins,</v>

617
00:36:21.961 --> 00:36:26.880
the way was in the sabers.
All right.
Those five teams,

618
00:36:26.881 --> 00:36:31.350
that was the Adams Division and then right underneath them they had like
another,

619
00:36:31.351 --> 00:36:36.240
like six or seven teams.
You had the islanders,
the Rangers,

620
00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:41.370
the devils,
the fly and the capitals.
One,

621
00:36:41.371 --> 00:36:45.210
two,
three,
four,
five,
another five fucking teams.

622
00:36:45.211 --> 00:36:48.920
Then he had to go way out to western Pennsylvania for Pittsburgh.

623
00:36:48.921 --> 00:36:51.480
He had basically yet 10 teams.

624
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:56.130
There were all like within an hour flight of each other,
hour and a half,

625
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:58.560
<v 2>like it was insane.</v>

626
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.440
<v 1>It was like a major league baseball.
When it first came out.
We,</v>

627
00:37:03.441 --> 00:37:07.920
you had the red sox and Braves were in Boston.
You had three teams in New York.

628
00:37:07.921 --> 00:37:12.000
He had two teams in Philly.
Actually you,
you,

629
00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:14.870
you literally could have traveled by train back in the day just kills me that

630
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.470
they're just going to gradually move them to all the same fucking cities that

631
00:37:18.471 --> 00:37:20.560
every other goddamn major sports team is in.
I,

632
00:37:20.561 --> 00:37:22.070
I don't like it to be honest with you.

633
00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.240
And I missed last night's game for some reason.
That one I didn't,

634
00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.910
I couldn't find what that thing was televised so I missed the capital's

635
00:37:28.911 --> 00:37:31.820
islanders game.
Uh,
both of those teams I really like.

636
00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.480
<v 2>And um,
you know,
I don't know.</v>

637
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:39.270
<v 1>That's a weird match up for me cause I liked Johnny Boychuk some room for him</v>

638
00:37:39.271 --> 00:37:43.740
but I also like Ovechkin so whatever.
We'll see.
We'll see how it pans out.

639
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.503
<v 2>I'm all right.</v>

640
00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.640
<v 1>That's the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.</v>

641
00:37:49.641 --> 00:37:53.360
I hope you enjoy some of these classic clips and a next time I talked to you

642
00:37:53.361 --> 00:37:53.721
guys,

643
00:37:53.721 --> 00:37:58.010
I'm going to be on the bus tour with Paul Versey and Jason Lawhead and hopefully

644
00:37:58.011 --> 00:38:00.050
I'll be able to get those two clowns on the podcast.

645
00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:03.200
We'll be able to update you along the ways we make our way through the deep

646
00:38:03.201 --> 00:38:07.250
south and onto the Kentucky Derby.
All right,
you guys have a nice,

647
00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:11.240
wonderful weekend.
I guess I should say.
Maybe it'd be nice at the ends of these

648
00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:13.440
<v 0>Katie,
go fuck yourself on Monday and then on Thursday.</v>

649
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:22.790
[inaudible]

650
00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:36.120
anyways,
um,
let's

651
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.280
<v 2>read,
uh,
what the fuck was I going to read here?</v>

652
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.620
Questions are already did this,
this is called broads over there.

653
00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.130
Barrage over there.
I don't know what the hell it says.
Let's read this one.
Bill.

654
00:38:50.131 --> 00:38:51.480
I had been a fan of yours sometime.

655
00:38:51.481 --> 00:38:53.970
You just want to tell you that I think you're a great thank you.

656
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.230
Why don't I fucking delete those?
Um,
I think you're calm neve up.

657
00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:04.960
All right.
Anyways,
the reason I am writing you is to tell you a funny story.
Uh,

658
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.490
my girl dating five plus years now and I live in Tucson,

659
00:39:08.491 --> 00:39:13.170
Arizona and she's always bitching at me saying,
we never do anything anymore.

660
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:17.850
Well,
my job is very consuming of my time and I realized that she was correct.

661
00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.170
So what do I do?

662
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.350
So what I do is I try to come up with something we could do together that would

663
00:39:22.351 --> 00:39:23.730
be entertaining and unique,

664
00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:27.270
something different that is not an average night out in Tucson se.

665
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.330
The guy's using his brain,
trying to surprise her.
Anyways,

666
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.650
I've been telling her about your comedy and showing her clips of you,
uh,

667
00:39:34.651 --> 00:39:37.230
that I found on your myspace page for the past few months.

668
00:39:37.231 --> 00:39:39.510
She really seemed to enjoy it and laughed hysterically.

669
00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:44.140
So I planned this great evening for the 20th of November,
um,

670
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:46.340
which goes something like this,
head up to temp Eav,

671
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.900
have a nice dinner and head over to the Improv and watch your show.
Uh,

672
00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.980
your eight o'clock show.
Um,

673
00:39:51.981 --> 00:39:54.720
while I bought the tickets and thought I would surprise her with the whole
thing,

674
00:39:54.721 --> 00:39:58.680
she loved the idea and she was very excited and I was supposed to pleased to see

675
00:39:58.681 --> 00:40:02.220
her excited about the event.
Well,

676
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:05.760
we were telling our friends about it and she sort of says this,
well,

677
00:40:05.761 --> 00:40:10.340
it's his evening and I'm just thought of tagging along.
Uh,

678
00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:11.930
I got to admit that,
um,

679
00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:15.540
I was a little upset at this point because I intended this whole thing to be a

680
00:40:15.541 --> 00:40:16.920
gift from me to her,

681
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:20.640
which is funny because this is very similar to the story that you told on

682
00:40:20.641 --> 00:40:25.260
October 19th on the October 19th podcasts when you took your girl in the

683
00:40:25.261 --> 00:40:28.900
corvette up the PCH.
She just showed us shut.
Uh,

684
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.880
she just showed it sort of shut me down.
Um,

685
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:35.670
so my question to you is why is it never enough?

686
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:37.950
Uh,
what a great question.

687
00:40:37.951 --> 00:40:41.640
Do you realize you just ask the question of properly every guy on this fucking

688
00:40:41.641 --> 00:40:44.010
podcast,
um,
hold on.

689
00:40:44.011 --> 00:40:46.750
I'm just going to pause here while the women roll their eyes and I,
God,

690
00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.800
that's bullshit.
That's not true.
You know,

691
00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:55.380
you got to use your imagination.
Women like surprises.

692
00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:59.460
They just fucking
shut up.

693
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.140
Just shut up.

694
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:05.310
Would you just shut up and take off all those fucking layers?

695
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.770
It's not the 18 hundreds,
you know,

696
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.690
with your panties and your panty hose and you slip and you're fucking skirt.

697
00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:18.150
All right.
What am I talking about?
I Dunno.
Um,
anyways,

698
00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.150
uh,
I lost my place.

699
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:25.200
It's my question to you is why is it never enough?
I can do everything she wants,

700
00:41:25.201 --> 00:41:29.780
but she was still find a way to make me look like an asshole.
Making me a,

701
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.000
making it seem like I'm dragging her around and making,

702
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.880
do all that stuff that I want to do.

703
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.800
I guess that is why I relate to your comedy because it seems that she is only

704
00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:44.500
happy when we do all the things that she wants to do.
Uh,
you don't,
I'm talking,

705
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:48.050
you know what I'm talking about with Brunch Street Fairs and the candle store.

706
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.610
Uh,
nevertheless,
we are going and really looking forward to seeing you in person.

707
00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:56.840
Uh,
I hope to see you have to show selling some cds and DVDs.
All right.
Um,

708
00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:01.490
why is it never enough?
I don't know.
I don't know why.

709
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.910
I don't know if it's an insecurity that they are,

710
00:42:04.911 --> 00:42:08.300
they're always questioning whether you truly love them or not.

711
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:13.510
Um,
I have no idea.

712
00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:18.510
I don't know why.
I mean,
I would think
that.

713
00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:22.110
All right,
look,
look,
look at me.
Okay.
I went,
I rented a corvette for the day,

714
00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:25.050
core Vectren verbal and I drove my girl all around La.

715
00:42:25.051 --> 00:42:29.400
We went up the fucking Pacific coast highway,
looked at the ocean,
we had lunch.

716
00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:33.270
I took her out to this beautiful bar late at night.

717
00:42:33.271 --> 00:42:36.480
I drove it through the Hollywood hills with the top down,
looking at the stars,

718
00:42:36.481 --> 00:42:38.160
looking at the lights out over the city.

719
00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:42.090
I thought it was a very romantic thing and then I got on the podcast and she was

720
00:42:42.091 --> 00:42:45.090
just like,
yeah,
that was really just,
that was really your thing.

721
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.550
I just did that for you.
You know,

722
00:42:47.551 --> 00:42:52.110
I just thought of sat there and a $70,000 automobile,

723
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:53.243
you know?

724
00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:54.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

725
00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:59.190
<v 2>Seeing views that people fly six hours to say and just,
you know,</v>

726
00:42:59.191 --> 00:43:03.990
just got a free lunch out of it and free fucking drinks and you ever watched the

727
00:43:03.991 --> 00:43:07.850
prices right there.
You just spit on my own microphone and you ever,

728
00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:12.810
a price is right.
You have watched the prices,
right?
Sure.
We all have.
Okay.

729
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.280
Getting a corvette,
I mean like,

730
00:43:14.281 --> 00:43:18.270
and then going to that restaurant and driving up to PCH and looking at the

731
00:43:18.271 --> 00:43:23.230
lights and going up to the fucking bar in the hotel with John Belushi.
Oh,

732
00:43:23.231 --> 00:43:25.110
deed,
isn't it?
That sounds like one of the,

733
00:43:25.111 --> 00:43:28.380
one of those showcases that you bid on.
Are you going to bid

734
00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.153
<v 0>pass</v>

735
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.760
<v 2>this thing here for the podcast bill?
This is under women and</v>

736
00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.810
<v 1>diamonds.
Um,
so bill,</v>

737
00:43:54.811 --> 00:43:58.380
I'm at a party last night and I see a guy you haven't seen in a long time.

738
00:43:58.381 --> 00:44:00.510
He's got his girl with them.
She's pretty hot,

739
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.490
but she's got this look on her face.
Uh,
we,
we were introduced earlier,

740
00:44:05.491 --> 00:44:09.000
so I say,
so I say hey to her and uh,

741
00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.780
and ask her what's wrong?
Turns out she's had a few,

742
00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:17.400
a few drinks and is throwing around the,
I want to get married.
Shit.
Um,

743
00:44:17.401 --> 00:44:21.810
I don't think my buddies having any of it or at the very least plans to go down

744
00:44:21.811 --> 00:44:24.320
swinging.
Um,
so anyways,

745
00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.870
nothing like a party to bring that shit up anyway.

746
00:44:26.871 --> 00:44:30.930
So I figured this is the perfect opportunity to test out a new theory.

747
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.200
I have about diamonds.
I'm not really a theory,

748
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.710
but a great question that allows women to show their true colors.

749
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:42.360
Why do I do this?
Because I'm a smart ass jerk when to have a few whiskeys.

750
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.970
I like this guy.
This guy sounds like me.
Right?

751
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.570
Why would you actually try to get the girl on your side and well actually you

752
00:44:48.571 --> 00:44:50.400
wouldn't hook up with your buddies girl,
but you know what I mean?

753
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.030
Why would you put out a good vibe when you can actually piss people off?

754
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:58.740
I totally relate to that.
Um,
anyways,
second half here.
Anyway,

755
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:01.860
from what I understand,
you can basically,
now,

756
00:45:01.861 --> 00:45:02.880
I don't know if this is true or not,

757
00:45:02.881 --> 00:45:04.530
but this guy's claiming from what I understand,

758
00:45:04.531 --> 00:45:09.030
you can basically buy a real diamond created in a lab.

759
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.111
Um,

760
00:45:10.111 --> 00:45:13.680
eventually they will be much cheaper than the ones they have to dig out of the

761
00:45:13.681 --> 00:45:18.000
ground and they will also be flawless.
A fucking perfect diamond.

762
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:21.990
So I asked this girl,
I say,
if she,
if she would rather have a perfect,

763
00:45:21.991 --> 00:45:26.991
flawless diamond created in a lab that costs a lot less or insist on a real dug

764
00:45:29.761 --> 00:45:33.690
out of the ground diamond by some poor person in Africa,

765
00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:39.120
nearly perfect,
but ultimately flawed more than it's an expensive one.

766
00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.800
Um,
he,
he said you can pretty much guess her answer.
Once again,

767
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:48.180
women are fucking stupid about diamonds.
Uh,
all right.

768
00:45:48.181 --> 00:45:53.181
My first question is can they really create one in a lab that's much cheaper and

769
00:45:53.191 --> 00:45:57.930
if they,
if they can for the love of God,
shut the fuck up.
Guff

770
00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:02.910
<v 2>about it.
That should be some low like Guy Shit,</v>

771
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:08.840
you know,
and,
and,
and this is what,
this is what we would do like you,
this is,

772
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:13.020
this is the level that you organize it to our,
I just so they don't catch on,

773
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.980
you know,

774
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:18.390
because some guy who fucking stock shelves at seven 11 is able to buy the hope

775
00:46:18.391 --> 00:46:21.690
fucking diamond,
the broads.
We'll be able to figure it out quickly.

776
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:25.440
So what we should do is organize this shit like the beginning of the warriors,

777
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.230
except nobody shoots Cyrus,
okay?

778
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:30.600
We organize this shit and this is what we say.

779
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:34.950
You come in with your w two for the fucking year,
all right?

780
00:46:34.951 --> 00:46:39.690
We see what you make and then we give you an unbelievable fucking diamond from

781
00:46:39.691 --> 00:46:43.290
making that amount of money,
whatever we rather than,
what's it supposed to cost?

782
00:46:43.291 --> 00:46:48.060
Six weeks' pay.
We give you one that costs like 10 weeks,
you know,

783
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:52.650
put some fake beads of sweat on your fucking brow when you give it to her and

784
00:46:52.651 --> 00:46:57.120
the whole thing's going to look legit and me while we take that money to go buy

785
00:46:57.121 --> 00:47:01.830
a new flat screen.
All right?
And that's when you make the fucking move.

786
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.610
Or after you give it the diamond.
Okay?
Say I bought that diamond for you.

787
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.720
Now I want to buy something from me.
Actually,
why don't you help me out on this?

788
00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.990
Just throw me a hundred,
200 bucks in this thing.
You go out,

789
00:47:12.991 --> 00:47:14.730
you get a big fucking flat screen TV.

790
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.230
You get the fucking dish just in time for NFL football.

791
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:20.850
You know,

792
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:24.690
and I'm sure they offer a college football fucking package and then you just

793
00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:28.380
spend the rest of the football season Saturday and Sunday and total fucking

794
00:47:28.381 --> 00:47:32.470
bliss.
And anytime she gives you shit just be like,
I'm sorry honey,

795
00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:36.490
I couldn't hear you over the glare of the fucking diamond I put on your God damn

796
00:47:36.491 --> 00:47:40.510
finger.
That's what,
well that's what should have happened.
If I had half a brain,

797
00:47:40.511 --> 00:47:44.890
I want to read that part over the Goddamn a podcast.
But um,

798
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:49.600
I actually get that on some level.
Why she would want the other one.

799
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:53.470
I don't get it because I don't want to think about some poor kid digging that

800
00:47:53.471 --> 00:47:57.850
out of the ground.
That's the part where it goes off the rails.
But they want,

801
00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:03.760
you know,
they want something of value,
you know,
and they,
they,

802
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:07.060
I dunno if they want to show that they married a provider.

803
00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:12.010
I get it on some level.
They want to make their friends jealous.
Like,
um,

804
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.730
I think their obsession with diamonds,
you know,

805
00:48:15.731 --> 00:48:19.900
generally speaking is as dumb is our obsession with sports.

806
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:21.950
Because when you really think about it,

807
00:48:21.951 --> 00:48:26.020
our obsession with sports is really fucking stupid.
You know,

808
00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:30.490
sitting on your couch like a Goddamn cheerleader wearing the jersey of your

809
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:33.310
favorite player.
I mean,
not everybody does that,
but they're,
you know,

810
00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:34.470
fantasy football.

811
00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.250
<v 1>Well,
I mean,</v>

812
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:41.251
fantasy football to me is the male version of sex and the city of women watching

813
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:42.160
sex in the city.

814
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:46.000
For you to sit around and play fantasy football and get together with your

815
00:48:46.001 --> 00:48:49.540
friends and have a fucking draft,
I mean,

816
00:48:49.541 --> 00:48:51.850
you might as well do it in a Goddamn tree fort.

817
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:55.750
It's really one of the gayest fucking things you could possibly do.

818
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.040
And of course I am saying this,

819
00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:01.000
having never tried it and I know God damn well fight tried it.
I'd be like,

820
00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:05.830
this is fucking awesome,
you know,
pass the dip or whatever you fucking guys do.

821
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.120
Um,
but anyways,
I dunno,

822
00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:15.910
I just,
I,
you know,
look,
this is,
if I've learned anything in life,

823
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:19.320
women are crazy and guys are fucking idiots.
And,
uh,

824
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:23.350
it's not straight across the board,
but generally speaking,
yeah,

825
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:27.370
they're fucking nuts.
They're out of their minds and we're more on,
I mean,

826
00:49:27.371 --> 00:49:30.460
would you,
if you go on youtube and you just look up those fail videos,

827
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:35.470
most of them are guys trying to do something and they fucking get hit in the

828
00:49:35.471 --> 00:49:39.160
balls,
land on the back of their head,
wreck their car.

829
00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:43.540
How many women are driving down the street on a fucking motorcycle going 90

830
00:49:43.541 --> 00:49:47.050
miles an hour trying to stand up on the seat.

831
00:49:47.051 --> 00:49:51.730
Doing the karate kid pose is they point at the fucking camera and then fucking

832
00:49:51.731 --> 00:49:55.960
skin get skin their fucking asses.
I mean,
how many,
you know what I mean?

833
00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:59.710
How many guys,
how many fucking women are,
are,

834
00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:03.910
are fucking whatever that move that Asian dude does or whatever,

835
00:50:03.911 --> 00:50:07.720
where he fucking somehow gets his car to be doing donuts and he actually gets

836
00:50:07.721 --> 00:50:12.340
out of the car and is holding onto the steering wheel and it's still spinning

837
00:50:12.341 --> 00:50:17.020
around.
Somehow he's got the gas pedal
pushed all the way down.

838
00:50:17.021 --> 00:50:20.380
Basically in the end he gets run over by his own fucking car.
I mean,

839
00:50:20.381 --> 00:50:22.330
we're idiots.
All right.

840
00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:26.800
Women on the other hand going to movies and start crying like they actually know

841
00:50:26.801 --> 00:50:28.090
the people on straight

842
00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:32.080
<v 2>get all excited about shiny shit.
And,
uh,</v>

843
00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.620
I gotta be honest.
I don't even know what the fuck they get excited about.
I,

844
00:50:35.621 --> 00:50:37.450
I have such a difficult time listening to them.

845
00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:43.150
<v 0>Alex,
such a great chauvinist Dick thing to say as I fucking took a slug.</v>

846
00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:49.940
[inaudible]

847
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:18.470
[inaudible].
