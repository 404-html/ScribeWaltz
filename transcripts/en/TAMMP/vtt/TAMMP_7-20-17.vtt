Well,

9
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.480
I used to get paid on Thursday.

10
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.260
I skipped paid on Thursday and I used to keep my money.

11
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.880
I used to have my money.
I spent it on bay.

12
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.320
Well,
where do you want to go?
Who's it up to?
May allow me dependent.

13
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.193
She got nothing.

14
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.430
My life was mine and that 260 bucks a week that I made.

15
00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:53.740
I had a fucking car payment for $138 a month.

16
00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.580
I was rolling in it,
you know,
fucking rolling in it.

17
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.830
I didn't even realize it.
I was like,
Oh gee,

18
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:07.540
wouldn't it be great someday to fucking get out there in the world,

19
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.870
get my own place,
have a car,
drive down the street,
man.
Right.

20
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.600
What happens?
You get out there and you fucking you.
You're just stupid.

21
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.070
You like a little toddler walking,

22
00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:21.790
crawling up to a fucking Cobra and they forgot to so its mouth shut,
you know,

23
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.940
like,
cause they do that shit over in India,
you know,

24
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.660
we just born into a family of snake charmers whatever happens over,

25
00:01:28.661 --> 00:01:32.290
they haven't seen that video.
I assumed it was an India,
you know,

26
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.590
and don't get mad at me.
Blame Hollywood.
All right.

27
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.940
I've hung out with disease a few times.
I never,

28
00:01:39.941 --> 00:01:43.690
I never brought the Cobra thing up.
I forgot to find out if this was true or not.

29
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.290
I could have been like a Z,

30
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.050
Z is this or is this not a your people things specifically.

31
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.090
And then he could have been like,

32
00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:55.840
God no built is actually this snake charmers all over uh,
all over the world.

33
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.130
You know what?
I would've said it.
What's it?
Fair enough.
But I didn't.
So anyway,

34
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:02.140
she ever seen those fucking videos where they,
they,

35
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.570
so the goddamn cobras fucking mouth shut.

36
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.020
Can I curse more than that sentence?
Have you seen those?
Um,

37
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.590
have you seen that footage where they take the unknown and I went at this point

38
00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:16.540
with this voice,
I'd have to know the Latin name for Cobra.

39
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:20.140
They sold the fucking things mouth shut and then they have a baby crawl up to it

40
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:21.220
and the,
and the snake,

41
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:24.460
it's like freaking out because you're going to understand is small as a baby,

42
00:02:24.461 --> 00:02:27.430
as to a person for snake,
it's still pretty fucking big.
Like what?
What is,

43
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.780
what is that?
Is that a mongoose?

44
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.990
Is that going to run up and just grabbed my face and give me a couple of shakes

45
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:34.910
and then that's it.
Last thing I see in my life is,

46
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:38.680
is the inside of a fucking Mongooses esophagus.

47
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.950
That's what the snake is thinking.

48
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.370
It's just a snake only has one fucking expression.

49
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.160
You know,
reptiles are like redefine resting bitch face

50
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.500
reptiles never look like they're in a good mood.
Oh,

51
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.910
they're just stay or they just have like,
no,

52
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:03.700
they just kind of fucking sitting there like a frog.
Right?

53
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.000
It's not a fucking reptile and amphibian.
Well,
whatever it is,

54
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:11.730
doesn't have any hair on it.
They have a little bit,
oh,
that was less cool.

55
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.560
Less clean clothes line.
Right.

56
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.980
It's talking about some woman's said she was finer than frog hair.
Um,

57
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.920
what the fuck song was that?
That was one of his solo albums.

58
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.490
His bucket of Bernie brains,
something of the hunt.

59
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.650
I can't remember how my brain's going.
Oh,
I would,
I don't know where to start.

60
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:38.920
I was talking about babies fucking messing with,
with,
uh,
cobras.
I Dunno,

61
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.740
I got there.
I mean,
what's going on?

62
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:45.480
How many minutes just went by three 42 just like that.
Just like that.

63
00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:49.170
Three 42 you drive home and you drive to work.
Right?

64
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.800
Well maybe you have really tiny headphones and your wife's bitching at you right

65
00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:54.930
now and you listen to this.
Oh,
your boyfriend.
I Dunno.

66
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.300
I Dunno what the fuck he's doing.
Um,
yeah,

67
00:03:57.301 --> 00:04:00.120
he had that dream that you're going to go out in the real world and your money

68
00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:03.210
was going to be made and it was going to go into your pocket.
And Dude,

69
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:06.000
I'm going to have a fucking keg rater over here.

70
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.860
Fucking pool table Air Hockey.
And what happens?

71
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.720
<v 0>20 years goes by,
20 years way they go 20 years,</v>

73
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:18.670
I don't know.
Right Bob Seger.

74
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.980
Sometimes I sit and wonder where they gone.
Passmart is Bob Seger.

75
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.020
Bob Seger was smart enough to realize that most people lose and he sang right to

76
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:33.520
those fuckers and they showed up with their fucking,
what are the,

77
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:35.040
what does that old Milwaukee threatened?

78
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.770
They sat right in the front row at the bottom,
lips quivering,
you know,

79
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:41.440
and then the wise would look over like,
oh honey,
what's the matter?

80
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:43.170
And then they'd have to slap their wife cause you,

81
00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:46.260
you couldn't show that you cried back then when the song first came up.

82
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.350
Now you can sit there with like cupcakes and kittens on your shirt as a man.

83
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.100
Sit there.
Indian style wearing yoga pants and your wife,
you know,

84
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:57.280
I don't know what she's doing.
She's got work boots on and a trucker hat.

85
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.200
I don't know what goes on with the youth today.

86
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.830
I don't pretend to know I'm an older person.
All right.

87
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.200
All I know is somehow all the bands went into the computer and they never came

88
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:12.250
out again.
And then they just became one person.

89
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.570
You know,
like Mayweather says form like Voltron,
right?

90
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.360
Doesn't vultron like one guy.
I know what the fuck it is.
Wow.
The hell would they?

91
00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:21.890
I mean I'm from the age of like,

92
00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:25.700
I mean I was too old for stomp or four by fours when they came out.

93
00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:27.830
That's how I played with Tonka trucks.
People.
Okay.

94
00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:29.870
There was no batteries and nothing thing.
You wanted it to move.

95
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.240
You had to fucking push it.
All right?

96
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.840
And you wrote those things down the driveway and right before it went into

97
00:05:35.841 --> 00:05:36.351
traffic,

98
00:05:36.351 --> 00:05:39.770
you bailed off of it and you prayed to God that it would make the other side

99
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.510
without getting run over by a milk truck.
Right.
There you go.

100
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.900
So
and like you,

101
00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:50.900
I also don't know what I'm talking about at this point anyways.
Yeah,

102
00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:55.800
you thought it was going to be all yours.
I mean 20 years fucking goes by.
Okay.

103
00:05:55.801 --> 00:05:59.060
And then one day you walk a d and you're just looking around at all the shit and

104
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.440
all it really is,
it's,
it's just a bunch of shit.
What's the,

105
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.540
what is all this shit?

106
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.670
Fucking tables and couches chair.
We're going to fucking chairs here.

107
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.960
How many kids do we plan on having?
Why are there so many God damn chairs.

108
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.160
One others.

109
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.900
This is a perfect area right here where a drunk kid could go.

110
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.840
You know what does that stupid picture?

111
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:23.650
Why don't you take it off the wall and put up a fucking dad?

112
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.070
I just feel like that wouldn't look right.

113
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.950
Be kind of awkward.
Why would that be awkward?
You know,
it's an awkward,

114
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:37.610
every room.
Vaguely looking the same.
We look like we live in a furniture store.

115
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.660
There's nothing in here but furniture.
How about some fun shit?

116
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.870
What about that game where you try to punch it as hard as you can to see how

117
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:49.070
strong you are?
You know where that game would you shoot the baskets.

118
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.010
You can't just have one of those.
I don't know.
I just feel like that was,

119
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.320
you know,
maybe in the garage.

120
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.980
Is there a way to put it behind the house and down the street?

121
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.890
I don't want to have company over and have them see that you're having fun.

122
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.210
I want
my wife fed it out.
Listen to this.

123
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.420
I want them to come over and see that you are totally in control under my

124
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:19.550
control and you are,

125
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:22.670
you are listening to the fucking decisions that I want to make.

126
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.550
I'm just fucking with you.
Um,
anyways,

127
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.440
whatever.
Most of that isn't true.
Only the sad part.
Um,

128
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.750
it starts to everybody either get paid today or tomorrow.

129
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:39.230
What do you do with your money?
Huh?
But he didn't do it in here.
Bank of America.

130
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:43.220
Evidentaly they were entire fucking system was down.
How does that happen?

131
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.120
That's not scary enough as it Jesus Christ.

132
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.330
I hope they didn't.
You know,
I should look that up.

133
00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:52.970
I should look that up before I cause a run on a bank.

134
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.800
Is that the name of a song run on a bank?
Is that a Bob Seger Song?

135
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:04.790
Was that ain't no surprise.
Oh,
that's love on the rocks.
Not Run on a bank.

136
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.590
Love on the rocks.

137
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.460
Ain't no big surprise that it was run on a bank

138
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.800
grabbing by their ties.
Especially with him.
Milk,

139
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:19.640
white fucking thighs.
Why does my Internet suck?
And every fucking room,

140
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.500
I swear to God,

141
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.510
who am I Internet company is they have to have a poster me on the wall.
Go.

142
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:30.740
We need more customers like this.
He pays 10 times what he should fucking pay.

143
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.310
It never works.
And he never complains unless he's doing his podcast.

144
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:37.760
But who gives a fuck?
Cause he never calls us.
So what do we care?

145
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.110
We just keep taking his fucking money.
All right,
here we go.

146
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:48.110
Bank of America.
Fuck yeah.

147
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.250
Everyone in the world is jealous of us.

148
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.990
Everyone wants to be just like us.
That's why they hate on us.

149
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.310
All right.
Maybe.
Maybe we've gotten out of the line in a few areas.
All right.

150
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:06.250
Evidently it's loading.
You know what I mean?

151
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.630
Watching my computer tried to get on the Internet,
like waiting for it for load.

152
00:09:10.631 --> 00:09:13.570
It's like watching me try to remember shit from fucking two days ago.

153
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.000
Oh you sneaky fucking bastards.
This isn't what I wanted.

154
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:24.600
I didn't want you to a website.
I wanted to fucking gossip.
What am I gonna hit?

155
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:28.890
Bank of America Slash TMZ.
Bank of fucking America.

156
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.300
Here we go again.
Bank of America.

157
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:34.690
<v 3>Okay,</v>

158
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.810
<v 0>Google.
Here we go.
Here we go.
What do you got?
What do we got?</v>

159
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:39.250
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

160
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:44.250
<v 0>Customers shat out of accounts during a parent Bank of America outage.</v>

161
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.080
<v 3>Okay.</v>

162
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.130
<v 0>Oh boy.
Oh boy.
I'm just picturing someone with one of those.
What's that?</v>

163
00:09:51.131 --> 00:09:55.450
White masks that those PR fucking hackers where when they want to shut down the

164
00:09:55.451 --> 00:09:59.740
corporations.
Um,
all right,
here we go.

165
00:09:59.741 --> 00:10:03.640
Bank of America customers was shut out from their accounts.
Oh,
an advertisement.

166
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.520
Oh,
Ralph's.
Jesus.
You know what?
I will buy a Honeywell am.
All right.
Well,

167
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:12.280
Bac Bank of America customers were shut out from their accounts for several

168
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.920
hours.
Wednesday in a system outage.
You know,

169
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:20.520
somebody who's fucking,
you know,
didn't get dialysis so their heart stops.

170
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:22.590
So you would,
you wouldn't,
he was such with,

171
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.060
with so at the feet of these fucking cunts,
coral springs resident,
Eric's,

172
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.670
oh,
he's asleep or you'd never think he could run that fast.

173
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:34.830
And those work boots and there he goes down the street.

174
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.390
So we got what looked like a phishing email from the bank Wednesday and

175
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:42.960
immediately started calling customer service to see if something was wrong,

176
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:46.830
a message on his online accounts that it could not pull up his information.

177
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.731
When we called,

178
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:51.510
his local branch of managers said that the local managers are calling each other

179
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:53.190
trying to figure out what caused

180
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.310
what appeared to be a national outage and why they were unable to provide

181
00:10:58.311 --> 00:11:02.600
certain services like what provides you with the money that you need.

182
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.160
Um,
on down detector.com,
a website that tracks reports,

183
00:11:07.161 --> 00:11:11.390
have system outages report started spiking after 11:30 AM and the website was

184
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.600
inundated with comments from Bank of American customers don't what the fuck send

185
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.150
around the country saying they couldn't access online banking computers.

186
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.530
Transit did it by 1:00 PM they had received nearly 1000 reports of problems,

187
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.310
but by Wednesday evening all although some customers were still reporting

188
00:11:28.311 --> 00:11:32.920
problems that never reports had gone down considerably to about 200 and then

189
00:11:32.921 --> 00:11:33.670
this is their common.

190
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.900
I know that the tape is working quickly to bring everything back up and as time

191
00:11:37.901 --> 00:11:40.600
progresses they should be able to go back online.

192
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.850
I would really love to see what really happened.

193
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:52.380
A Bank of American system wide system wide outage on the damn closing on my

194
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:56.560
closing on my house and there's nothing I can do about it.
Bank of America,

195
00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:58.660
you closed my bank account with no notice.

196
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.190
How can I deposit my check when I no longer have an account stuck in Thailand?

197
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.390
Okay.

198
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:09.890
What is up with not being able to transfer system has been down for three hours.

199
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.490
Oh Jesus.
Jenny.
That's nothing compared to the guy stuck in Thailand.

200
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.220
The clerk at Bank of America just said,

201
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.250
I can't make it to cock deposit because a nationwide disruption.

202
00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:24.540
Anyone know what's up?
All right.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right,
well let's just soap.

203
00:12:24.541 --> 00:12:28.580
That was a onetime thing.
Nothing to see here.

204
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.890
That's fucking scary.

205
00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.150
That's why you gotta have your money in like three different banks.

206
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.270
I don't care if you get 40 bucks,
but 15 and one 10 and another.

207
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.320
What do we got left,
Dan?
What's that?
25 you can 15.
The last one,
right?
1515 yes.

208
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.960
10.
It's a fucking shell game out there,
man.
Um,

209
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.890
then when you got to pay your rent,
you write three different checks.

210
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.160
Why don't you just write it for the full amount?
Okay.

211
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.050
Cause I'm not going to get stuck in Thailand.
You can't,
what do you care?

212
00:12:58.051 --> 00:13:02.770
As long as it all works.
Um,
all right,
let's get back to a,

213
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:07.200
the podcast here.
Um,
I am,
when you listen to this,

214
00:13:07.201 --> 00:13:09.510
I will be in New York City by the time you listen to this.

215
00:13:09.511 --> 00:13:14.360
I am going to the airport to not to not to that.
Um,

216
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:15.760
I'm going back to New York.
Yeah.

217
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.590
<v 4>For about a week.</v>

218
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.520
<v 0>I'm going to be there for a week.
Week.</v>

219
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.460
I'm doing an acting gig out there.
As I mentioned before,

220
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:28.480
they rebooting sex in the city and a,
I'm going to be playing this,
Cynthia Nixon,

221
00:13:28.481 --> 00:13:31.080
Karen,
uh,

222
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.780
they said to keep my head shaved.
Maybe they could do some sort of,
I dunno,
post,

223
00:13:36.781 --> 00:13:40.720
uh,
you know,
cancer free.
Uh,

224
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.950
I guess Craig Nixon,
I don't know my fucking name is going to be,
but you know,

225
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.300
I want it to be the,
the fabulous one.
Whatever the fuck her name is.

226
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.040
What the fuck was her name?
I saw him one time at a Knicks game.

227
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.990
She'll still look beautiful,
you know,
but they're thin fucking head,
you know,

228
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.030
she needs more head and I need less said.

229
00:14:00.031 --> 00:14:02.100
If we could somehow combine the two of us,
I think,
you know,

230
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.730
they could have something there.
The fuck is her name.
She started it.

231
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.680
How do you remember Cynthia Nixon and you don't remember the other one?
Sarah.

232
00:14:10.681 --> 00:14:14.340
Jessica.
That's right.

233
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.930
S J p she had a fucking basketball shoe.

234
00:14:18.931 --> 00:14:22.820
How about those red sox won in the last three out of four.
Yeah.
That shit

235
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.460
went to,
went to against the fucking yaggies all where then we,
uh,

236
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:32.520
took two or three from the Blue Jays.
I watched the whole blue Jay series.

237
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.130
I enjoy,
you know what's great is a Dennis Eckersley up in the booth.

238
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.940
The man loves the game.
The man played the game.
The man can talk the game.

239
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.480
God dammit.
He does it for nine innings.
I love,

240
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.900
especially when it's like a low scoring game.

241
00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:49.170
If you have a fucking picture up there,
he's incredible.

242
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.760
They'll actually make it exciting.
Think he's going to kill me with the fucking,

243
00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.660
I go breaking ball here.
Guy Throws a breaking ball.
He's like,

244
00:14:57.661 --> 00:14:59.780
get this guy that he's like,
it's like he has fucking ESP.

245
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.150
It's like he pitched in the fucking league.
Everybody.

246
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.260
How does this man know what happens if gently the Yankees made some sort of move

247
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:10.160
to,
to cock block the red sox.
But you know,
I tried to get annoyed by that,

248
00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:14.240
but you know,
it's been three world series.
I think we're good.
It gives a shit.

249
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.050
We're in first place.
I think it's kind of over.

250
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.920
I think the Yankees Red sox thing is,

251
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.150
it'll never be what it was and I'm happy for it.

252
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.550
I'm actually glad that it won't be,
I don't miss it.

253
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:27.270
<v 2>Okay.</v>

254
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.350
<v 0>Because uh,</v>

255
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:29.790
<v 2>yeah,</v>

256
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.960
<v 0>you know,
it usually didn't work out.
It worked out for us once</v>

257
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:38.380
and then it was over.
Um,
anyways,

258
00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.490
uh,
oh by the way,
still in posted a picture of my drum kit.
I swear to God.

259
00:15:42.491 --> 00:15:44.230
You know,
I'm going to fucking send it right now,

260
00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.150
so I'm going to send it right fucking now.

261
00:15:46.151 --> 00:15:50.170
You probably already see it by the time this things posted.
Let me just fucking,

262
00:15:50.171 --> 00:15:54.220
it's not the greatest picture.
I was by myself.
What do you want from me?

263
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.570
Come on.
Oh Shit.
You know,
I was reading something the other day.

264
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.520
I'm going to give to it.
Um,

265
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.760
about good fellas.

266
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.400
It was this really cool thing that said 30 things you might not know about

267
00:16:06.401 --> 00:16:10.060
Goodfellas and it's actually 30 things that I didn't fucking know.
Um,

268
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.780
even though they still talked about how,
uh,
how am I funny?

269
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.330
What do I amuse you?
What am I,
some sort of clown.

270
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.130
Everybody knows that that was Improv,
but like passion,

271
00:16:20.131 --> 00:16:23.150
those guys was saying we would improv it and then he,

272
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.310
he would write it all down and then,
you know,

273
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.640
take the best parts in that write it down.
Then you had to memorize it,

274
00:16:27.641 --> 00:16:28.630
then you'd fucking go do it,

275
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.590
which makes sense because you can't like fucking improv every different taken

276
00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:35.380
that he moves to cameras around you saying different Shit that you did the other

277
00:16:35.381 --> 00:16:38.370
time and then it's not,
it's not going to line up.
So anyways,
he was,

278
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.660
it was the best one of the best ones.
Um,

279
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:45.190
that whole tracking scene where,
um,

280
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.270
Henry Hill takes Karen,

281
00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.270
<v 5>what did you,
oh,
you just killed us.</v>

282
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.983
<v 0>Okay.</v>

283
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.360
<v 5>Sorry.</v>

284
00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:59.340
<v 0>Right.
Um,
he takes her in through the kitchen.
Right.</v>

285
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.480
That whole tracking shot.

286
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:06.020
And that was one sentence in the book that Scorsese got this idea.

287
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:07.290
There's a,

288
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.170
there's a line in that book wise guy or whatever the fuck the one that Henry

289
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.080
Hill road it said,
um,

290
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.960
on crowded nights when people were lined up outside and couldn't get in the

291
00:17:18.091 --> 00:17:22.650
doorman used to let Henry,
I'm sorry,
the prince really small.
My eyes are gone.

292
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.890
You still led Henry and our party in through the kitchen,

293
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.410
which was filled with Chinese cooks and we go upstairs and sit down immediately.

294
00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.950
That one sentence in that poll fucking book.

295
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:36.670
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

296
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.490
<v 0>I mean,
how many times did you read that book?
He just read it one time and said,</v>

297
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:44.270
oh,
that gives me an idea.
Bam.
Um,

298
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.190
you'd think it would at least be a paragraph.

299
00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:47.810
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

300
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.510
<v 0>some sort of story attached to it.
It's just one God damn sentence</v>

301
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.990
and that guy's fucking able to do all of that.

302
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:58.130
And that my friends is why he's one of the great directors and all time.

303
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.610
All right,
let's,
let's get a good one here.
Let's get a good one.

304
00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.600
<v 6>Three d,
d d d,
d.</v>

305
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.440
<v 0>Oh,
there we go.
There we go.
Symbols that are fucked up angle.</v>

306
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.230
I had to run out of there.
I'm a dad now.

307
00:18:15.231 --> 00:18:17.240
It's like whenever I get a fucking chance,
I run over there.

308
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.290
I ran over there this morning.

309
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.650
I literally played four songs and then went to work.

310
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.980
I didn't stretch it all cause I didn't have time to and then my fucking forearms

311
00:18:27.981 --> 00:18:32.030
and tans were all fucked up.
I'm an idiot.
All right,

312
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.790
let me send this right now.
You guys are literally listening to me.

313
00:18:34.791 --> 00:18:38.590
Send a fucking picture.
Uh

314
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.090
Oh guests who wants to come back?
Guess who wants to come back

315
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.030
after after fucking dumping this podcast guest.
Who wants to come back?

316
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.753
<v 3>Huh?</v>

317
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.270
<v 0>After it's not nature's box.</v>

318
00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:57.880
<v 3>Okay.</v>

319
00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.530
<v 0>It's a hold on a second.
Post this with podcast.</v>

320
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.270
You can't,
I didn't say that.
Alright.

321
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.720
Guess the draft kings wants to come back with a fuck the day go Tom.

322
00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:14.260
What the fuck is wrong with ya?
Um,
did you hear what's his face got?

323
00:19:14.261 --> 00:19:17.470
'Em they're going to be backed by the way,
cause they said,

324
00:19:17.471 --> 00:19:18.790
I can say whatever the fuck I watch,

325
00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:21.130
which means I can make the advertising is funny as I want.

326
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.650
This means you guys will listen and then you go.

327
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.770
That's all that's all advertising is just get people to listen and maybe

328
00:19:26.771 --> 00:19:30.000
somebody will buy.
Um,

329
00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:35.350
there was a rumor I heard
that,

330
00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:39.070
um,
what's his face?
Klarna condom.

331
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:43.930
Glenna Macgregor got knocked out by your sparring partner.
And A,

332
00:19:43.931 --> 00:19:46.510
I looked it up and what I loved was made,
whether it was like,

333
00:19:46.511 --> 00:19:49.180
I don't believe it until I see footage,
I don't believe it.

334
00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.010
Like maybe that was a strategy by my,
um,

335
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:56.080
McGregor and it kind of all got fucking just explained away like,

336
00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:59.140
no,
it didn't happen.
So there you go.

337
00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:03.790
There's one for you guys who are still going to order it.
There was no proof.

338
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.750
It was debunked by number Gregor camp may weather wasn't.

339
00:20:07.751 --> 00:20:11.200
That does not believe it.
So there's still a chance,

340
00:20:11.201 --> 00:20:15.280
there's some stupid article out there calling Conor McGregor yet another great

341
00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:18.820
white hope.
It's like,
this is not another great white hope.

342
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.210
Great White Hope would be if he was an actual inboxing,

343
00:20:22.211 --> 00:20:25.690
trying to win a fucking title.
You know,

344
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.870
this guy holds two titles.
He already is a champion.

345
00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:33.610
Okay.
He already has a champion,
you know,

346
00:20:33.611 --> 00:20:38.530
when it's not a whites only league.
So I don't know.
He's a great white hope.

347
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.450
This is a fucking spectacle.

348
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:45.040
That's what this is too.
God Damn Spectacle.

349
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.570
I am gonna try so fucking hard to order it already agreed with Rogan.

350
00:20:49.571 --> 00:20:51.610
Then I might watch it the next week with them.
He does his thing.

351
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:53.740
When you've just fucking watch it together and you talk about it.

352
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:57.310
I might do that with Rogan.
If I can find some goddamn time to do it,

353
00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:02.140
I have to do it.
Um,
that's also a good way to watch it for free,
for free.

354
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.590
Um,
maybe that's what I'll do.

355
00:21:05.591 --> 00:21:08.920
I'll be the fucking grumpy guy that didn't watch it and then I'll solo watch it

356
00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:11.710
and really just a tight fuck.
I'm going to watch it for free.

357
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.230
Remember that expression fucking ante up yet tight.
Fuck.
Hey,

358
00:21:17.231 --> 00:21:21.730
does anybody know how the expression,
uh,
on the arm came about?

359
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.600
We tried to figure that out today in the writer's room.
Meaning it's for free.

360
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:27.490
The Best I could get is that it's,

361
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:32.080
it's a policemen slang on the arm and all I could think was,
you know,

362
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:35.680
the long arm of the law,
the arm of the law.
Why is why,

363
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.890
how does the expression on the arm,

364
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.610
<v 3>okay,</v>

365
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.510
<v 0>calm about what is the origin?
That means it's free.</v>

366
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.630
Don't pay for these drinks there on the arm.
Can anybody tell me,

367
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.520
cause people already told me p's and q's.

368
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:53.260
Mind your own ps and Qs came from the bars and the pubs where they used to give

369
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:57.670
beer in pints and courts.
So when people got a little,

370
00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.750
you know,

371
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.020
out of line and sticking their nose in other people's business or getting ready

372
00:22:02.021 --> 00:22:04.150
to fight a mind,
your p's and q's,

373
00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.520
you'll look at your fucking glass.

374
00:22:07.521 --> 00:22:09.590
You don't look at anybody else or whatever the fuck it meant.
Right.

375
00:22:09.591 --> 00:22:13.370
So I liked that shit.
So if he can tell me how long the arm came about,

376
00:22:13.371 --> 00:22:17.510
I don't give a shit.
If you make up stuff,
I'll read it like it's,
it's a fact,

377
00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:22.430
then it'll end up on Wikipedia and then at least people will have an answer.

378
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.620
Um,
anyways,

379
00:22:25.621 --> 00:22:29.350
so these fucking Toronto Blue Jay fans would talk and shit,

380
00:22:29.351 --> 00:22:34.220
cause I actually watched that whole fucking 14 any game,
um,

381
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.440
where Hanley Ramirez hit the walk off home run,
right?
It was three,

382
00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:43.430
three after regulation and then 13,
um,
after nine innings,

383
00:22:43.431 --> 00:22:44.990
whatever the fuck you saying this sport and then,

384
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.770
and like the 12th inning or something like that,
Blue Jay scored a run,

385
00:22:48.771 --> 00:22:52.220
went up four to three and then we somehow scored a run,
made it four to four.

386
00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:57.020
And then Hanley Ramirez in the bottom,
bottom of the 14th,
hit a walk off,

387
00:22:57.021 --> 00:23:02.021
crushed a hanging curve ball out onto the fucking mass pike there and loved

388
00:23:02.331 --> 00:23:04.910
Eckersley.
He was saying,
he was saying that Haley's going,
I love you.

389
00:23:04.911 --> 00:23:09.080
I love it cause he just,
he just wants to go home.
It's fucking hilarious.
Um,

390
00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.400
especially cause we have that 19 in a game with the Yankees a few days earlier.

391
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:18.240
But um,
oh Geez.
What the fuck was I talking about?

392
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.040
I literally just forgot everything I was talking about.

393
00:23:20.041 --> 00:23:25.041
There was a point I was trying to make there on the arm then to the red sox

394
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.980
and then fucking out my year down my pant leg and I don't know where the fuck it

395
00:23:29.981 --> 00:23:33.100
went.
I don't know what the fuck I was talking about there.
Oh,
I know.

396
00:23:33.101 --> 00:23:35.650
I was talking shit,
well,
I didn't talk shit.

397
00:23:35.651 --> 00:23:39.360
These fucking Blue Jay fans are giving me shit.
So out of nowhere,

398
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.290
this fucking drum company symbol making company that I'd never heard of before

399
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.430
called dream symbols.
I don't know where it starts talking Shit Gone Egg.

400
00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.890
If,
if uh,
I figure I have to read it,
the Red Sox win and the Red Sox win,

401
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:58.700
we'll give you a free bag of symbols if the Blue Jays,

402
00:23:58.701 --> 00:24:02.810
when uh,
you know,
you got to give us free advertising.

403
00:24:02.811 --> 00:24:04.820
So the Red Sox win and you're like,
Eh,
fuck it.

404
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:07.190
What kind of symbols do you want to whether they,
if they were even serious,

405
00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:10.670
I was just like,
you know,
get me a bag of fucking symbols.
I already have symbols.

406
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.350
I can't play the cymbals I have.

407
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:15.530
Why would I take a bag of yours that you could actually sell to someone who

408
00:24:15.531 --> 00:24:18.560
knows how to play drums?
So just for the fuck of it,
I'm gonna,
you know,

409
00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:21.830
but if I'm going to start the advertising with a free read,

410
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.540
I've never heard of these guys.
Dream symbols.
[inaudible] symbols.

411
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.670
You have a dream.
You can have some symbol of man have them in a bag,

412
00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:35.780
man.
Uh,
though relatively new on the market.

413
00:24:35.781 --> 00:24:40.580
Dream cymbals and gongs produced worldclass handmade produces worldclass

414
00:24:40.581 --> 00:24:45.140
handmade symbols out of a factory and China's Wu Han region.

415
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.350
Am I going to be put on a watch list?
I didn't know you.

416
00:24:48.351 --> 00:24:50.030
I thought we'd though those guys were the enemy,

417
00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.820
which is crafted excellent gongs for generations,

418
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.740
for drummers searching for their own style.
Dream is a dream come true.

419
00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:03.730
Each symbol has its own unique voice enhancing musicians distinct in this
dreams.

420
00:25:03.731 --> 00:25:05.530
I actually listen to us.
A couple of people play the cymbals.

421
00:25:05.531 --> 00:25:07.270
They sound pretty good,
you know,

422
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.440
and I would imagine because they're lesser known,
Aka nuts.

423
00:25:11.441 --> 00:25:12.720
Siljan not Selgin,

424
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:17.650
not Sabian none fucking paste or pasty over the fuck you say it.

425
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.720
Meinl all the kids play meinl now.

426
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.450
<v 2>Okay,</v>

427
00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:23.970
<v 0>everybody's got to play the MEINL.
She wanted to be different.</v>

428
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.430
Why don't you play dream symbols or don't?
I don't give a fuck.

429
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.293
They're not paying me.

430
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.870
You can buy a set of these symbols and roll them down the fucking hill for all.

431
00:25:33.871 --> 00:25:35.880
I give a shit.
All right now into the real stuff.
All right.

432
00:25:35.881 --> 00:25:39.690
That was just a warmup,
able to start doing that.
Free advertising.
Just a warmup.

433
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.000
I apologize if I'm making a lot of noise.

434
00:25:43.001 --> 00:25:45.340
I've got a cough drop in fucking my boys.
Oh,
who is it?

435
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:52.790
Oh,
look who's here.
Hey Sweetheart.
My daughter's walking.

436
00:25:52.791 --> 00:25:54.170
She's already knocking on doors.

437
00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:01.850
Guess who learned how to crawl?
She crawls like an inchworm.
Ah,

438
00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:03.920
you don't care about your toys though,
do you?

439
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.310
I love this new shiny thing she does when she sees and she looks away.

440
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.670
What's up buddy?
You're going to hang out.

441
00:26:10.671 --> 00:26:13.550
Watch another 14 things or red sox baseball with me tonight.

442
00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.810
We actually already went.
Oh,
okay.
All right.
It's hot as hell in here.

443
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:24.830
Turn it on if you don't mind.
Okay,
bye.
Bye.
Hey Nia.

444
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.580
What would you do if somebody had that level of bad breath?

445
00:26:28.581 --> 00:26:29.600
I'd read that thing to you.

446
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.730
Valid ptosis and literally had like that fucking slime along the gum line.

447
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.860
There's no way you're kissing them,
right?
It's too gross.

448
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:44.130
Would you say anything?
I honestly think

449
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.880
<v 7>it depends on how much he likes her.
You know what I mean?
If you really,</v>

450
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:51.210
really likes her,
like,
damn,
I could really see myself with this girl.

451
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:52.220
Then you say something.

452
00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.290
<v 0>How do you see past?
You know what all I could think of person.</v>

453
00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.760
All I could think of was when you know when they,

454
00:26:58.761 --> 00:27:02.660
just the day when they just empty the dumpster and you look inside of it and all

455
00:27:02.661 --> 00:27:06.260
that.
Fucking that liquid slime.
That's all I could.
Oh God,

456
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.051
<v 7>no.</v>

457
00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:12.051
I feel like if someone is that poor with their dental hygiene,

458
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:16.800
I feel like that definitely is a red flag,
to be honest.
If it were me,

459
00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.280
<v 0>yeah,
you're not going downstairs.</v>

460
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:23.070
You've seen the attic and I don't want to see the basement
right now.

461
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:27.720
I know.
She's so cute.
Okay.
All right.

462
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.560
Turning the AC.
You don't mind?
I'd bug me last night.
By the way.

463
00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.540
You all impressed that I got to go to sleep.

464
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.063
<v 7>It bugs me</v>

465
00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.100
every time you pull me back in.
Yes,
I know,

466
00:27:42.101 --> 00:27:46.870
but I was trying to compliment you.
I know.
I thought you felt,

467
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:48.623
you know

468
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.170
<v 0>I didn't know.
Yeah.
I didn't know I had difficulties getting her to go to sleep.</v>

469
00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:54.650
<v 7>You were like,
I think at it.</v>

470
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:59.230
<v 0>Oh that just means I don't want to do it.
I can do it.
I just don't want to do it.</v>

471
00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.580
Oh

472
00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:05.500
<v 7>really?
Cause you made it seem like I like I,
you made me feel bad for you.</v>

473
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:09.820
Like you felt like,
oh,
it's not like I do it everyday.
Like you do.

474
00:28:09.821 --> 00:28:13.480
Like you felt somehow it bothered you inside?

475
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.400
<v 0>No,
I just knew it was easier.
It was easier for you to do it.</v>

476
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:18.560
<v 7>Okay.</v>

477
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.300
<v 0>Cause you know,
you can always tap out.</v>

478
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.810
It's like drunk drivers with Uber so you can always take your boob out and then

479
00:28:23.811 --> 00:28:27.230
put her to sleep with that.
I can't do that.
Okay.

480
00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.750
I'm a man without a country there.

481
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:31.850
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

482
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:36.850
I thought that meant that you felt like you didn't really have a place in terms

483
00:28:36.951 --> 00:28:40.940
of like getting her to go to sleep,
but now I'm realizing that you're just lazy.

484
00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.130
So

485
00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:45.330
<v 0>Lazy.
I worked all day in a writer's room staring at a computer screen,</v>

486
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:47.400
trying to think of chokes for animated children.

487
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.823
<v 7>Okay.</v>

488
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.380
<v 0>Okay.
Um,
all right.
Just for that,</v>

489
00:28:52.381 --> 00:28:54.750
I'm drinking tonight and I'm going to be really belligerent,

490
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.070
extra belligerent tonight.

491
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.280
I know she's adorable.
And you know what?
Adorable is not funny.

492
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:07.330
So for the past five minutes,
you keep calling me back.
You see what she does?

493
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:09.550
She yells at me.
Could you put the AC on please,
sweetheart?
Yeah,

494
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.550
<v 7>one more time.
I swear to God.
I'm going to try it.
All right.
All right.</v>

495
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.290
<v 0>All right.
Oh me,
I gotta read this one thing for you.</v>

496
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.850
I read this one thing for you.
No,
I'm trying to leave.
Go put the AC on.

497
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.250
Don't doubt out.
Right.

498
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.930
You could have got me worse.
He could have got me worse.

499
00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:34.920
Um,
all right.
Passionate women hit hard.

500
00:29:34.921 --> 00:29:37.880
I don't know if you've ever noticed that you did some chicken,

501
00:29:37.881 --> 00:29:40.140
which says no direction.
She bawls her fist up.
I mean,

502
00:29:40.141 --> 00:29:42.160
you can literally just continue wheat and you club sandwich,

503
00:29:42.161 --> 00:29:45.190
but if he gets a woman with passion that,

504
00:29:45.191 --> 00:29:47.680
or if they had an older brother and it's going to fucking hurt a little bit.

505
00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.750
All right.

All right,
lift.

554
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:21.890
Lift man.
Um,
Lyft knows that their drivers are what?

555
00:33:21.891 --> 00:33:26.030
Keep them moving so they do everything they can to make sure that drivers are

556
00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:27.350
happy on every trip.

557
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:31.100
Lyft is the ride sharing company that believes in treating its people better.

558
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:34.790
Lift belly.
I love this shit.
I love this Hatfield and McCoy thing.

559
00:33:34.791 --> 00:33:37.460
That's going on with them.
And that other company that rhymes with Uber.

560
00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:41.080
Yeah.
When I read this copy,

561
00:33:41.081 --> 00:33:45.100
what I learned from Lyft is that if you drive for that other company that rhymes

562
00:33:45.101 --> 00:33:45.934
with Boober,

563
00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.600
they evidently treat you like shit and you don't get tipped or something.

564
00:33:49.601 --> 00:33:52.030
I don't know what the fuck happens,
but that they're totally good.
No.
Yeah.

565
00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.080
This is the place.

566
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:57.250
This is the ride sharing app that gives a fuck about their drivers.

567
00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.610
Luke does a ride sharing company that believes in treating it's people better

568
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.920
lift the leaves.
It being a ride.

569
00:34:04.921 --> 00:34:07.950
Sharing drivers should be fun if you're having a good time.

570
00:34:07.951 --> 00:34:12.900
So are the passengers.
Ah,
well yeah,
not if you're partying,
you know.
Look,

571
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.200
don't have too much fun up there buddy.
Okay.
My life's in your hands there.
Uh,

572
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:19.620
if you're choosing a ride sharing company to drive for,

573
00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.110
go with a company that treats you better.
Like Lyft.

574
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:27.180
Lyft was the first to offer in APP tap tipping.
When you drive,

575
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.090
when you drive for Lyft,
you'll keep 100% of the tips.

576
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.690
Drivers had been paid over $200 million in tips since the feature was
introduced.

577
00:34:33.691 --> 00:34:36.180
Lift as even taking the guesswork out of pickups.

578
00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.830
The new amp device uses color coding to tell passengers.
Find the drivers.

579
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:45.230
You can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips.
Want to earn more money?
Well,

580
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.030
drive more.
It's never been easier to give you self.
Uh,
I'll drive more.

581
00:34:51.031 --> 00:34:52.620
It's never been easier to give yourself a raise.

582
00:34:52.621 --> 00:34:55.320
That's all you gotta do is work more.
Well,
that's kind of how every job works,

583
00:34:55.321 --> 00:34:58.830
isn't it?
Unless she wants salary.
Uh,
it's a simple formula.

584
00:34:58.831 --> 00:35:00.540
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

585
00:35:00.541 --> 00:35:05.190
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating.

586
00:35:05.191 --> 00:35:09.750
Go to lift.com/bird today and get your $500 new driver bonus.

589
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:15.380
<v 0>I don't know why I just thought this,</v>

590
00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:18.380
but I don't think hours is going to catch Mercedes.
I just don't.

591
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.150
I don't know what the fuck's going on over there.

592
00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.630
I know this season is only halfway over,
but I dunno.

593
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:29.910
Both Ferrari's,
both fucking left front tire is both in the final five laps.

594
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:36.040
No,

I'm sorry.

595
00:35:36.041 --> 00:35:38.610
With all the fucking mealy mouth on this podcast.

596
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.080
I'm trying not to do it on the mic.
It's just I got this halls in my mouth.
Okay.

597
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:46.470
Because my fucking voice is shot once again,

598
00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.140
and I got all this act and to do so I'm taking a break,

599
00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:52.660
a momentary hiatus from screaming my jokes on stage.

600
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:56.880
You know,
I just really need to do,
I need to break smarter jokes,

601
00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.440
did all that got to do was just come out.

So anyways,
I'm going to be in New York,

640
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:07.980
sweat my balls off for the next fucking week.

641
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:11.640
Being the new Cynthia Nixon and uh,

642
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.770
you know what kills me is,
uh,
I,

643
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:18.660
I found out too late that guns and roses is going to be playing at the Apollo

644
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:22.410
theater that night.
The 30th anniversary,

645
00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.800
30th anniversary of the,
um,

646
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.990
of appetite for destruction.
They're going to be doing it there.
I,

647
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.140
I fuckin have figured out a way to weasel my way into that show.

648
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.060
It's done through Sirius Xm.

649
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.800
God knows I'd done enough shit over there and I completely fucked myself cause I

650
00:38:41.801 --> 00:38:43.120
didn't realize that show was going on.

651
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.420
And then I'm going to be in New York and while I'm in New York,

652
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:53.820
John fucking mayor with the night game opening up with Dave Lucha on drums at

653
00:38:55.421 --> 00:38:58.810
the La Forum.
Steve Jordan on drums,

654
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.520
two of my favorite drummers of all fucking time to incredible fucking bands.

655
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.160
One of the best venues to see a god damn concert.

656
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:10.630
And I show up like a fucking day or two later and I missed that.
You know,

657
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:17.500
I just feel like I missed everything.
Um,

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:20.530
Thank you guys so much for listening.
I hope you have a wonderful weekend.

659
00:39:20.531 --> 00:39:25.480
You can't,

Listen to this music is,

660
00:39:25.481 --> 00:39:28.810
we uh,
transferred to another half hour of free shit

661
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:33.930
<v 8>here from a Thursday afternoon podcast from a Thursday gun buy in a year.</v>

662
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:36.940
That already happened or maybe it's early this year.
I don't know.

663
00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:39.820
I don't choose them.
That's it.
I'll,
I'll talk to you on [inaudible]

664
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.653
<v 9>Monday.</v>

665
00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.413
<v 10>No phobia.</v>

666
00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:28.900
Hey Billy Bo Baggins is it gain or phobia you afraid of the gynecologist?

667
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.060
I am a 28 year old college guy.
Who has,

668
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.960
was it Jane or Phobia?
The fear of women.

669
00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:44.150
I've never heard of this.
Uh,
he said when I was a kid,

670
00:40:44.151 --> 00:40:48.110
I used to get the shit kicked out of me and girls would always spread rumors

671
00:40:48.111 --> 00:40:50.660
about me and it would really screw with my mind.

672
00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:52.100
<v 9>Okay,</v>

673
00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:56.650
<v 10>wait a minute.
You didn't get along with men or women.
Well,
what were you,</v>

674
00:40:56.651 --> 00:41:00.560
what were you doing?
You know what?
That's the last thing you needed to hear.
Well,

675
00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:04.330
what's wrong with you?
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.

676
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:06.170
I'm not a trained professional,
so you know,
you're,

677
00:41:06.171 --> 00:41:10.870
you're asking a more on and you know I'm going to behave accordingly.

678
00:41:10.871 --> 00:41:12.130
Here we go.
As I grew up,

679
00:41:12.131 --> 00:41:16.870
I started to resent and hate all the people around me that my mother tells me

680
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.920
about false rape accusations.
And that makes,
oh,

681
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:26.190
and that makes females look even more scarier than they already were.

682
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:29.950
See,
guys,
just kick the shit out of you.

683
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:35.460
Females psychologically fuck you up and don't even have a tint of remorse or

684
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:41.210
empathy.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
All right,
dude.

685
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:46.040
So your mother's is psycho and she put all these fears on you.
Yeah,
you got to,

686
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:50.770
maybe I would seek some professional help before you turn into Norman Bates.
Uh,

687
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.920
all right,
let's continue this then.

688
00:41:51.921 --> 00:41:56.600
I hear about all the women raping men in the divorce courts and in general,

689
00:41:56.601 --> 00:42:01.250
adding more fuel to the fear.
Dude.
Yo,
Yo,
you're overthinking this shit.
I mean,

690
00:42:01.251 --> 00:42:04.310
you probably heard half of that from me,
but I'm an idiot.
Don't listen to me.

691
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.990
He said,
it's gotten to the point where when a female introduces herself to me,

692
00:42:08.991 --> 00:42:13.580
I just see her as a potential mind raping and prolonged exercise of getting

693
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:18.320
verbally abused.
So I just always say sorry,
but I have somewhere to be right now.

694
00:42:18.321 --> 00:42:19.154
Goodbye.

695
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:26.390
And I walk away.
Sir,
can I steal that from you?

696
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:32.870
I want to use that next time they get pulled over.
Yeah.
License.
Reza.
Sorry,

697
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:36.680
Lynn.
I have somewhere to be right now.
Goodbye.
And you just,

698
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:39.170
just act like the rain man,
and they'll fucking leave you alone.

699
00:42:39.171 --> 00:42:42.350
That's actually brilliant.
Uh,
he said they scare me so much,

700
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:45.920
but I'm still attracted to them.
Oh my God,
Dude.
You listen,
you gotta.

701
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:48.320
You gotta you gotta get past this.

702
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:52.130
Hopefully you're still young and this is early on,

703
00:42:52.131 --> 00:42:55.310
but this is something where you are,
you know,

704
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.390
everybody is trying to go towards the,
uh,

705
00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.540
we'll just call it a whatever planet live happily ever after.

706
00:43:02.541 --> 00:43:04.730
But if you're off by just one degree,

707
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:08.930
you're not really going to notice when you're 22,
24,
you know,

708
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:12.620
but by the time you're 40,
you're going to be about a million miles off course.

709
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:17.270
So let's try to get you some help.
I would go see a therapist,
sir.

710
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.340
Um,
and I know I've been joking around,

711
00:43:19.341 --> 00:43:23.330
but I kind of have to do that because this is a podcast.
But,
um,

712
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.870
well actually because it's a podcast that's supposed to be funny.

713
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:31.940
I'm not saying you can't have a series podcast.
Um,

714
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.721
yeah,

715
00:43:32.721 --> 00:43:36.380
I would go get some help quickly and I would get rid of all those fears and I

716
00:43:36.381 --> 00:43:39.530
would say a lot of the fears of probably uh,

717
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:42.560
put into your head by your mom when you were really young and you need to try

718
00:43:42.561 --> 00:43:46.100
and get those out of there before they take any more route than they already do

719
00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:50.690
already have once finish here.
He said,
my mind says,

720
00:43:50.691 --> 00:43:54.890
stay the fuck away while my Dick says do it.
Do it.
Fucking do it.
Uh,

721
00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.500
but in this climate of unrestrained female

722
00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:00.760
hypo agency and he went to fight,

723
00:44:00.761 --> 00:44:05.360
I mean the shit that makes women invade male spaces and makes them change

724
00:44:05.361 --> 00:44:09.950
everything to suit them through.
Dude,
you're taking your fucking fear of women.

725
00:44:09.951 --> 00:44:14.300
You're,
you're,
you're blowing by me.
Listen,

726
00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:16.640
are you a great guy?
If you're a great guy,

727
00:44:16.641 --> 00:44:21.290
there's a great woman out there for you and the,
and it's a beautiful thing.

728
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:22.880
They're not all like this.

729
00:44:22.881 --> 00:44:26.060
What you're doing is you're taking the worst of the worst of females and you're

730
00:44:26.061 --> 00:44:30.980
printing it with a broad brush.
All right?
Um,
AH,

731
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:32.950
Jesus Christ.
I'm relating
to this guy here.

732
00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:36.640
He said I'd rather stay celibate for life.
All right.
Now I don't relate to that.

733
00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.010
I am a loner to a vast degree,

734
00:44:39.011 --> 00:44:43.090
but I got a loving family to back me up so I ain't on the fringe or anything.

735
00:44:43.091 --> 00:44:46.120
I plan on just working towards my career and it did.

736
00:44:46.121 --> 00:44:48.220
I write this like 20 years ago.

737
00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:52.090
Jesus Christ plan on just working towards my career in education,

738
00:44:52.091 --> 00:44:56.140
but either way I'll have to deal with women and it's been hard to do since

739
00:44:56.141 --> 00:44:57.370
lately too.

740
00:44:57.371 --> 00:45:01.630
So lately since my social skills tanked over the last nine months,

741
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:03.751
trauma,

742
00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:08.580
Conga Line of horrific events happened and I am working on getting the

743
00:45:08.581 --> 00:45:12.930
confidence back through Brazilian Jujitsu already lost 11 pounds and I'm

744
00:45:12.931 --> 00:45:16.530
starting to feel a lot better.
All right,
well just don't go choke out any women.

745
00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.430
All right.
I've tried to put them in the triangle.
He said any ways,

746
00:45:20.431 --> 00:45:21.121
is there any way,

747
00:45:21.121 --> 00:45:24.780
but martial arts are a great way to build self esteem from what I've heard

748
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:26.220
anyways.
Is there any,

749
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:30.270
is there any way to get rid of the insane fear I have about women or is it just

750
00:45:30.271 --> 00:45:34.740
15 years of hurt that'll take almost forever an undue thanks and go fuck

751
00:45:34.741 --> 00:45:39.270
yourself six ways from Sunday and good luck with your standup.
Um,

752
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:43.800
all right,
I'll see.
You were only 15.
Is that what you're saying?
All right dude.

753
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:46.540
First of all,
it's great you took up Brazilian Jujitsu,

754
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.440
he should know how to defend yourself and uh,

755
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.710
don't be a current about it when you become a black belt,
uh,

756
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:55.410
use it to save nerds and protect yourself but never be a bully.

757
00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:57.960
Um,
and then as far as women,

758
00:45:57.961 --> 00:46:02.070
I would actually try and talk to somebody about this and I would try to have

759
00:46:02.071 --> 00:46:05.640
more of an open mind because right now if you only 15 years old or even if

760
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:09.690
you're young in your early twenties,
mid twenties,
you're basically,

761
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:14.010
you got the lottery pick as far as women goes.
All right.

762
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:18.750
They're all available.
Fall first round draft picks,

763
00:46:18.751 --> 00:46:23.650
bunch of first round draft picks just sitting there
and you know,

764
00:46:23.651 --> 00:46:27.400
depending on when you open your mouth and start talking to one is when you pick

765
00:46:27.401 --> 00:46:30.370
in the draft if you don't want to meet sooner rather than later.

766
00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.350
But I would just talk to somebody about

767
00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:34.550
<v 3>okay,</v>

768
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.940
<v 10>about,
about some of your issues.
Maybe it's school,</v>

769
00:46:37.941 --> 00:46:41.240
they got some free fucking therapy or something like that if you're too young to

770
00:46:41.241 --> 00:46:43.550
pay for it.
But,
um,

771
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.340
I dunno,
I would talk to somebody,

772
00:46:47.341 --> 00:46:51.150
I would talk to some of your guy friends about it.
I would,

773
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:51.901
you know what I would do,

774
00:46:51.901 --> 00:46:56.901
I would openly talk about your fear of women to,

775
00:46:57.091 --> 00:47:01.270
um,
to friends,
you know,
and I would,

776
00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:04.190
I would sit down with your mother and just say,
listen,

777
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:07.010
I have major issues with women right now.

778
00:47:07.011 --> 00:47:10.160
And I think some of it stems from a lot of the negative things that you've said

779
00:47:10.161 --> 00:47:14.750
about them.
And I need you to stop doing that because it's,
it's fucking with me.

780
00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:19.790
Don't,
don't say that part,
but say it in a nicer way.
Um,
but if she's,
you know,

781
00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:21.763
I dunno,

782
00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:26.640
that's the hardest fucking thing is because you are born into the religion of

783
00:47:26.641 --> 00:47:27.474
your parents.

784
00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:28.550
<v 3>Okay.</v>

785
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.010
<v 10>Ain't no and into</v>

786
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:35.010
<v 11>all of their beliefs and hopefully they have more good than bad,</v>

787
00:47:35.051 --> 00:47:38.740
but they're human.
So they're going to be wrong.
And you know,

788
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:42.550
when you're a little toddler all the way through like seven,
eight years old,

789
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:43.780
your parents are God.

790
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:46.510
Like you just think they know everything and they have all the answers.

791
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:50.170
They never look unsure.
You do everything that they fucking say.

792
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:56.430
<v 10>So a lot of that stuff just really takes deep root.
Like it's,</v>

793
00:47:56.490 --> 00:48:00.800
it's law in your head.
And then he,

794
00:48:00.801 --> 00:48:02.730
the teenage years,
he started breaking away.

795
00:48:02.731 --> 00:48:05.010
You realize some of his bullshit and let's win.

796
00:48:05.011 --> 00:48:07.110
Some anger can come out and that type of stuff.

797
00:48:07.111 --> 00:48:10.740
So I would say what you're going through is normal.

798
00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.810
It's just that you maybe had an extreme,
uh,

799
00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:16.800
helping of some fucking anti woman shit,

800
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.820
which I can relate to because I did too.
And I had to fight through that shit.

801
00:48:20.821 --> 00:48:25.140
I mean,
it took me to get married.
Tell us 45 I had made you fucking issues.

802
00:48:25.141 --> 00:48:27.870
But uh,
it's like anything look at,

803
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.810
just used the martial arts thing as a,

804
00:48:30.811 --> 00:48:34.740
a metaphor or a simile,
whatever the fuck you're supposed to.

805
00:48:34.741 --> 00:48:39.240
Whatever the right terminology is.
Look at you.
You did that.
You stuck with that.

806
00:48:39.241 --> 00:48:42.920
You lost 11 pounds.
You work towards that.
Look at,
look at what you're,

807
00:48:42.921 --> 00:48:46.890
you're getting,
you're getting positive results and it hasn't been easy,
right?

808
00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.740
But You keep showing up.
You get positive results.

809
00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.260
I would do the same thing with your women issues.

810
00:48:52.261 --> 00:48:56.790
I would just start working on it.
Um,
you know,

811
00:48:56.791 --> 00:49:00.030
next time a woman comes up and says hello,
don't say I have somewhere to go.

812
00:49:00.031 --> 00:49:03.780
Just say hello back and stay in the conversation for as long as you can.

813
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.540
And when you feel like baling,
just say,
listen,

814
00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:10.440
I'm really shy around women and it's something that I'm trying to work on.

815
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:11.520
Just put it out there.

816
00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:16.100
And you know what I guarantee 80% of them are going to say,
ah,

817
00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:18.300
you know,
when they do that,
they're going to love it.

818
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:23.490
And next thing you know you're out there watching a romantic comedy with some

819
00:49:23.491 --> 00:49:27.030
lady having a good time.
But I would,
I would address it sooner than later.

820
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:31.590
I'm telling you,
dude,
it's you literally,
it's,
you think it's a mountain.
It's,

821
00:49:31.591 --> 00:49:34.860
it's a fucking,
it's stepping up onto the curb.
It's all in your head.

822
00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:39.930
And that's totally normal because I would guess that your fears started when you

823
00:49:39.931 --> 00:49:44.490
were in your,
my mom's godlike phase of your life.
So you think,
you think it's,

824
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:46.050
<v 11>ah,
okay.</v>

825
00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:50.350
<v 10>What's that fucking mountain Everest that everybody tries to climb up.
It isn't.</v>

826
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:54.820
It isn't.
Okay.
It's a little fucking ant hill and,
and you can do it.
All right.

827
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.700
<v 9>I believe in you.
Good luck sir.</v>

828
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:20.480
[inaudible] [inaudible]

829
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:33.140
<v 12>hey,
what's going on?</v>

830
00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:38.141
It's Belper and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

831
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.670
July.
Fucking something.
I don't know what it is cause it's Sunday.

832
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:49.040
It's going to be the 20th right
now.
Wait a minute.

833
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:51.290
I'm on September here.
God dammit

834
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.260
it is the 20th what are the fucking odds?

835
00:50:55.261 --> 00:50:59.120
Are there any ways what's going on?
It's a billboard,

836
00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:03.950
the Monday morning podcasts for a Monday,
July the 20th,

837
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.780
and I'm actually doing it Sunday night.

838
00:51:05.781 --> 00:51:08.590
Cause whenever you're listening to this fucking thing,
um,

839
00:51:08.591 --> 00:51:12.560
I'm probably out golfing.
Yes.
Believe in a,

840
00:51:12.561 --> 00:51:17.561
not a guy who already has too many God damn hobbies with his pathetic drumming

841
00:51:18.921 --> 00:51:22.770
and guitar playing.
Um,
I have,
I dunno,

842
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:26.120
I've somehow got sucked into that game,
fighting it,

843
00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:30.770
fighting it my entire adult life.
All my friends,

844
00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:34.580
not all my friends,
it's a bunch of fucking people I know.
They day,

845
00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:39.650
day golf and uh,
I always viewed it like drinking coffee.

846
00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:44.840
I just didn't like,
I don't know,
it just didn't look like that much fun,

847
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:50.060
but everyone was completely addicted to it.
You know,
I took a sip of fucking,

848
00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:50.923
uh,

849
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:55.220
coffee when I was like eight years old and it tasted like shit.

850
00:51:56.030 --> 00:52:00.440
Tasted like dirty water and it looked like dirty water and that's what it tasted

851
00:52:00.441 --> 00:52:04.040
like.
And I never,
I never got into it.

852
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.380
And Dan and all my whole adult life,

853
00:52:06.381 --> 00:52:08.120
I just watch all these people walking around.

854
00:52:08.121 --> 00:52:11.720
They can't start their fucking day unless they get a cup of this shit.

855
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:13.723
You know,

856
00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:18.560
all these people talking about people on crystal meth and addicted to alcohol

857
00:52:18.561 --> 00:52:22.880
and shit like that.
I mean,
I guess they're not fucking slurring their speech,

858
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.080
you know,

859
00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.470
it doesn't cause them to slap the fucking wife around or something like that.

860
00:52:27.471 --> 00:52:30.950
So I guess it's kind of harmless.
But I dunno.

861
00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.320
I remember this kid when I worked in a warehouse,

862
00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:36.860
he used to drink like fucking eight cokes a day,
you know,

863
00:52:36.861 --> 00:52:41.150
we'd like sucked down like one an hour when we were working and one day decided

864
00:52:41.151 --> 00:52:44.840
to try to quit cold Turkey and this kid couldn't even function.

865
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:48.500
He had like this migraine headache.
He lasted like an hour and a half,

866
00:52:48.501 --> 00:52:51.680
maybe two hours for up until our first break.
And he just finally,

867
00:52:51.681 --> 00:52:55.520
he drank a coke and he just felt better.
So,
uh,
yeah.

868
00:52:55.521 --> 00:53:00.050
So I avoided that shit.
And um,
I don't know.

869
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:02.510
I've been kind of worried about losing my memory and somebody told me if you

870
00:53:02.511 --> 00:53:05.630
actually drink caffeine,
that actually helps with Alzheimer's.

871
00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:10.680
I had an Italian meal a few weeks ago and I drank a shot of espresso or espresso

872
00:53:10.851 --> 00:53:15.740
ever the fuck you say it.
And uh,
I dunno,
I have to,
I know,
I know.

873
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:19.520
It was fucking brutal.
I got it over with though.
And then someone was like,
no,
no,

874
00:53:19.521 --> 00:53:24.410
no.
I actually read where it adds to all Simer,
uh,
Alzheimer's disease.

875
00:53:24.411 --> 00:53:27.480
And I was like,
you know what?
I don't give a fuck.
You know,

876
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:31.560
none of you are doctors who are giving me this advice,
you know,

877
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:37.320
it's fucking ridiculous.
He might not like,
how many times do you get done that?

878
00:53:37.321 --> 00:53:39.990
You know,
you just sitting in a bar and somebody just says that we'll actually,

879
00:53:39.991 --> 00:53:44.470
caffeine helps,
uh,
helps against a,
helps prevent Alzheimer's.
Eh,

880
00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:47.490
they'd done studies.
Oh,
really?
Really?

881
00:53:47.491 --> 00:53:51.120
Do you have any of those studies in front of you?
What?
What the fuck do you do?

882
00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:54.480
Huh?
What do you,
what do you what,
what do you,
what does anybody do any more?
Huh?

883
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:55.040
What do you do?

884
00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:00.040
Why don't you sit in a fucking cubicle looking at spreadsheets of the sweatshop

885
00:54:00.091 --> 00:54:03.360
labor.
This is how fucked up this country is right now as far as like,

886
00:54:03.361 --> 00:54:07.560
I'm really just trying to buy American made shit.
Um,

887
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.870
I actually went and I got a couch and I went to this,
uh,

888
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:17.550
this furniture store over here in the valley and it was uh,
you know,

889
00:54:17.551 --> 00:54:20.300
allegedly American made shit.
So I,

890
00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:23.040
I ordered this couch cause you know,

891
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:25.500
you don't want to take the one that's on the floor that everybody's fucking

892
00:54:25.501 --> 00:54:29.010
plopped down on.
So I get this couch,
right.
So I'm like,

893
00:54:29.011 --> 00:54:31.080
when I asked before I bought the couch,
you know,

894
00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:35.250
cause I want to buy American made shit made by Americans.

895
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.180
You know what I mean?
Get this fucking country going again.

896
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:43.710
Well like we can't make a couch,
you know,

897
00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:48.780
we've made the best looking fucking cars of all God damn time before we started

898
00:54:48.781 --> 00:54:50.640
being cheap motherfuckers about it.
All right,

899
00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:53.520
we went to the moon and we fake going to the moon.

900
00:54:53.521 --> 00:54:56.130
I don't know what the fuck we did.
Okay.
But it was,
it was impressive.

901
00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:00.810
We can make a goddamn couch.
Okay.
So I asked the guy,
where's the couch made?

902
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:02.670
He says it's made in Pasadena.

903
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:06.810
Long story short is I have a problem and I'm having a problem with the

904
00:55:06.811 --> 00:55:08.580
upholstery that they put on the fucking thing.

905
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.900
So that was when I actually had to send the stupid couch back.

906
00:55:12.901 --> 00:55:15.780
I actually learned of their process.
This is what they do.

907
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:19.050
They do make the couch in Pasadena,
they build the damn thing.

908
00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:23.310
But when they put the upholstery on it,
they actually,

909
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:26.970
that part of the job,
they shipped it down to like Honduras.

910
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:33.930
Okay.
Think about that.
They build it.
And Pasadena,
I live over here in la.

911
00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:38.650
All right.
And they fucking ship it to Honduras to,
to,

912
00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:43.080
to have the uh,
the,
uh,
what did the upholstery put on it?

913
00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:44.790
And then they ship it back to America.

914
00:55:44.791 --> 00:55:49.791
So my thing is like how fucking cheap is the Goddamn labor down there that

915
00:55:50.941 --> 00:55:55.740
that's,
that that's financially a better way to go.
You know

916
00:55:57.330 --> 00:55:59.100
the fuck am I am talking about golf here.

917
00:55:59.101 --> 00:56:01.580
I'm talking about fucking ship and couches to a hundred Doris.
I Dunno,

918
00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:04.590
it's late at night here and I'm trying not to fucking scream and yell cause uh,

919
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:09.790
cause my neighbor is asleep in here.
Um,
yeah.
So anyways,
so I've,
uh,

920
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:13.980
taken up golf and a,
I still refuse to take it seriously.

921
00:56:13.981 --> 00:56:18.960
Although I did go out and buy a little tiger woods outfit,
you know,
I dunno.

922
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:21.840
I just didn't want to go down there looking like a dose,
you know,

923
00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:27.100
like the frat boy.
I figured if I dress nicely,
even if I suck,

924
00:56:27.101 --> 00:56:29.620
maybe I look like,
you know,
I'm having a bad day or something.

925
00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:35.920
So,
uh,
anyways,
I'm golfing right now.
That's what the fuck I'm doing.

926
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.540
And uh,
I missed that.
Oh,
a British show up.

927
00:56:39.541 --> 00:56:43.300
And yesterday we're a Tom Watson,

928
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:47.950
Tom Watson.
I thought the guy was like dead,
you know,

929
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:50.340
even though our in Palmer is still alive,
this fucking guy,

930
00:56:50.341 --> 00:56:54.670
he's like 59 years old.
He almost won the British open,
but then he didn't,

931
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.720
which is typical a golf,
oh my God,
something's great.

932
00:56:58.721 --> 00:57:01.060
Great's going to happen and then it doesn't,

933
00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:04.120
and then you watch somebody choke in front of their entire family.

934
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:07.960
I still haven't gotten over the math master's,
you know,
even though,
uh,

935
00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:13.490
with Kenny Perry said his name,
he's one another.
Uh,
he wants to,

936
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:15.610
I don't know what the fuck he won,
but he didn't get a green jacket.

937
00:57:15.611 --> 00:57:17.770
I can tell you that.
He can fucking tell you that.

938
00:57:17.771 --> 00:57:22.560
What am I talking about this week?
Hey,
this is the deal.
All right.
And you know,

939
00:57:22.561 --> 00:57:24.820
it's a deal cause I started the sentence off with,
hey,

940
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:28.900
I was trying to get your attention there.
Uh,
I'm going to be at the,
uh,

941
00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:30.610
the comedy works in Denver,

942
00:57:30.611 --> 00:57:35.230
Colorado on a Thursday,
Friday and Saturday of this week.

943
00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.030
It's one of my favorite clubs out there.

944
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:41.560
And I also want to thank everybody who came out to see my show.
Um,

945
00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:44.140
a week ago,
um,
at the punchline,

946
00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:49.350
my had a great time as a first time I was onstage headlining since,
uh,

947
00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:53.730
the middle of May because I was being a little fancy fucking dude.
There's,

948
00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:58.450
Jimmy Norton says make it a movie or sitting around waiting to do my 11 lines,

949
00:57:58.451 --> 00:57:59.710
however the fuck you want to look at it.

950
00:57:59.711 --> 00:58:03.460
But I'm going to say it in the positive way.
I was making a movie and a,

951
00:58:03.461 --> 00:58:08.050
I was a little,
a little rusty,
kind of found my,
I was a little little,
uh,

952
00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:09.970
it's a little messy but uh,

953
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:13.300
I got through it but I always buy the second show is back on my game.

954
00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.400
So I'm really looking forward to this and if uh,

955
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:17.580
you guys haven't been to listen to my podcast,
um,

956
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:20.680
I am going to be doing another special and it looks like it's going to be in

957
00:58:20.681 --> 00:58:23.770
December and it looks like if everything works out,

958
00:58:23.771 --> 00:58:28.120
I'm going to be taping it in San Francisco.
So,
um,

959
00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:33.180
I am going to be in a theater or a comedy club near you from here till then,

960
00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:38.980
from right now until then that I say that correctly.
Um,

961
00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.890
I kind of have a bit of a,

962
00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:44.980
it starts getting going basically right at the end of August and I'm just

963
00:58:44.981 --> 00:58:49.150
hardcore September,
October,
November and half of December.

964
00:58:49.151 --> 00:58:50.260
And then I'm going to tape the thing.

965
00:58:50.261 --> 00:58:54.700
I am going to be hardcore on the road like the old days when I wasn't making any

966
00:58:54.701 --> 00:58:57.400
money.
So I had to go out like three,

967
00:58:57.401 --> 00:59:00.670
four times a fucking month and then do a bunch of spots in the city.

968
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:04.840
I'm going to be doing it like that.
And uh,
I'm looking forward to it.

969
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:08.650
I'm going to try to eat healthy on the road.
These are my goals.
Now.

970
00:59:08.651 --> 00:59:11.920
Am I going to do it?
Who?
To?
Who the fuck knows?
All right.

971
00:59:11.921 --> 00:59:15.970
I'm going to try not to drink when I'm on the road.
We can try to do some yoga.

972
00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:20.500
I'm going to try to fucking do some cardio,
do some pull ups,

973
00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:24.130
get myself in shape physically and uh,

974
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.250
not look like a bloated jackass.
That's the last thing you want to fucking do.

975
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:30.410
You don't want to sweat and you want to look like a bloated jackass during your

976
00:59:30.411 --> 00:59:34.780
special.
And,
and then thirdly,
you want to be fucking hilarious,
but that,

977
00:59:34.781 --> 00:59:37.100
that is the,
uh,
that is the order.
Number one,

978
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:41.000
you do not want to sweat we your balls.
It's no big deal.

979
00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.500
They'll throw some laughter in there.

980
00:59:42.501 --> 00:59:45.530
Maybe they'll sweeten it up or maybe they'll just play it once and people forget

981
00:59:45.531 --> 00:59:49.520
about it.
But if you're pouring fucking sweat people,

982
00:59:49.521 --> 00:59:54.470
people remember that Shit,
you know,
now why would you no,

983
00:59:54.471 --> 00:59:57.320
you don't fucking do,
you don't do stand up.
All right,

984
00:59:57.321 --> 01:00:01.460
I'm a little out of it here.
Uh,
all right,
what do we got here?

985
01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:05.210
Um,
let's get on with the questions here.
Oh,
and if you knew to my podcast,

986
01:00:05.211 --> 01:00:09.170
welcome,
uh,
my joke every week that I only have like 14 listeners,

987
01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:12.410
but I got to admit,
I was at the,
uh,
when I was at the punchline on Monday,

988
01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:15.080
punchline is San Francisco.
Somebody,
uh,

989
01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:20.090
somebody yelled out Pau Gasol cause he wanted to see my impression as I was

990
01:00:20.091 --> 01:00:22.130
talking about,
I did one here on the podcast.

991
01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:26.030
So before I just launched into what I asked the people in the crowd,
hey,

992
01:00:26.031 --> 01:00:27.680
how many guys listen to my podcast?

993
01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:30.910
And it was literally like three quarters of the crowds.

994
01:00:30.911 --> 01:00:32.330
So I was kind of blown away by that.

995
01:00:32.331 --> 01:00:36.230
So I think I might be up to about 27 listeners,
their people.

996
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:41.630
Um,
anyways,
so,
uh,
let's get on with the podcast here.
Uh,

997
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.220
last week I was talking about all the celebrities who died.
And,
uh,

998
01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.900
and how all these morons,

999
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.550
when Ed Mcmahon died and then Farah died and then,
uh,

1000
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.320
Michael Jackson died.
People,
what do they say?
Oh,
there you go.
You know,

1001
01:00:57.321 --> 01:01:00.200
bad things coming.
Trees,
you know,

1002
01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:05.050
you fucking common trees and then Billy Mays dies,
right?
And then fucking,
uh,

1003
01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:09.830
what's his face fucking died earlier that month,
jerking off he dies,

1004
01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:13.280
right?
So that's five.

1005
01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:18.530
So you know what some fucking jackass sends me this email.

1006
01:01:18.531 --> 01:01:21.800
He was half joking around.
He goes,
you know,
he goes,

1007
01:01:21.801 --> 01:01:25.250
I'm one of those guys who actually says all the time that bad things come in

1008
01:01:25.251 --> 01:01:29.450
threes.
And I actually put up on my Facebook when those three celebrities dies,

1009
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:32.330
when they died.
I wrote bad things come in three.

1010
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:35.390
But then he mentioned that Karl Malden died.
He goes,

1011
01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:39.380
so technically that six,
so that's three and three.

1012
01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:44.390
So I am right.
Really?
That why isn't,

1013
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:48.200
why isn't it bad things come and six you people are right with the bad things

1014
01:01:48.201 --> 01:01:50.450
coming through you guys.
You're out of your fucking minds.

1015
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:53.500
Bad things come in threes.

1016
01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:56.470
So then what if somebody else dies and it goes up to seven,

1017
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.920
then you keep your fucking mouth shut until two more people die and you got to

1018
01:01:59.921 --> 01:02:02.980
see you there.
There you go.
It comes back around again.

1019
01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.510
So you guys just basically,

1020
01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:09.810
you basically open your mouth when whatever bad shit has been happening is

1021
01:02:10.661 --> 01:02:15.240
divisible by three to prove your fucking point.
You know,

1022
01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:19.560
I could say bad things come in eight and just wait for the eighth bad to fucking

1023
01:02:19.561 --> 01:02:24.010
happen and then rattle them off.
They don't come in threes.

1024
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:26.740
Bad things just continue to fucking happen,

1025
01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:31.630
which is why they have ice cream and alcohol,
you know,

1026
01:02:31.631 --> 01:02:34.480
so you can do fun shit while you're waiting for the neck.

1027
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:36.040
The next bad thing to happen.

1028
01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:41.500
You know we had a heat wave out here there.
That's seven bad fucking things.

1029
01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:46.060
How will you will you will fucking old lady.
What kind of a fucking human,

1030
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.000
what kind of a man says that shit.
I'm all right,

1031
01:02:49.001 --> 01:02:51.250
let's move on to some other stuff.
I know that guy,
I was just joking.

1032
01:02:51.251 --> 01:02:55.810
The guy was sent me the email and six,
but you know,
if I don't take it seriously,

1033
01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.650
then I don't get emotional about it.
And then the podcast isn't funny.
All right.

1034
01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:04.030
And then I lose a listener like that one woman from a fucking couple months ago,

1035
01:03:04.031 --> 01:03:09.031
I never heard from her again or her alleged friends who were listening.

1036
01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:11.230
So anyways,
uh,

1037
01:03:11.231 --> 01:03:15.340
which really affected the overall value of this podcast because I'm actually

1038
01:03:15.341 --> 01:03:18.940
doing this to get to a certain number and then I'm going to go corporate and

1039
01:03:18.941 --> 01:03:23.380
then I'm going to sell it just like these fucking cunts who start the myspace,

1040
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:27.970
these,
the social,
uh,
social networks,
whatever the fuck you call them.

1041
01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:32.310
What they really are is they're basically clubs on the Internet.
You know,
like,

1042
01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.470
I've never believed in or not,
I was never into the club scene.

1043
01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.220
I know it's hard to believe that I didn't put on Cologne and go,
all right.

1044
01:03:39.221 --> 01:03:43.240
Maybe I did it a couple of times,
but I failed so horrifically.

1045
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:47.620
And I've always said,
one of my strengths in life is I've known what I sucked at.

1046
01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:52.120
Okay.
And going to the night at the Roxbury things is,
uh,

1047
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:55.660
not something I was never good at.
Skews me.
I need to drink here.

1048
01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:58.010
<v 13>Okay.</v>

1049
01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:00.100
<v 12>All right.
That's gross.
You don't want to hear anybody chewing gum.</v>

1050
01:04:00.101 --> 01:04:03.040
I fucking take a sip of anything,
but you know what?
It's hot as fuck out here.

1051
01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.240
I was playing drums all day.
I was actually playing with other human beings,

1052
01:04:07.241 --> 01:04:11.920
if you can believe it.
It's a whole different kind of drumming.
Um,

1053
01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:12.850
you know,

1054
01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:15.340
when you played by yourself and you do whatever the fuck you want and you screw

1055
01:04:15.341 --> 01:04:17.620
up,
there's nobody looking over their shoulder.
Like really?

1056
01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.550
You said you could play drums there.
There's nobody looking at you like that.

1057
01:04:21.551 --> 01:04:25.570
So it was a whole different fucking level.
Um,
anyways,

1058
01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:29.590
I wasn't no sound,
but the social networks say they're,
they're like clubs.

1059
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:30.521
You know what I mean?

1060
01:04:30.521 --> 01:04:34.120
Where you got the new hot club and all the cool kids are going there and then

1061
01:04:34.121 --> 01:04:37.570
all the nerds show up and the bridge and tunnel crowd and all that shit.

1062
01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:40.510
And then everybody took off to Facebook.
That's what the fuck happened.

1063
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:43.930
And then all the nerds went over there and then all the cool kids went over to

1064
01:04:43.931 --> 01:04:47.740
Twitter and now all the nerds have fallen.
I'm over there and it just,

1065
01:04:47.741 --> 01:04:50.770
it's going to be never fucking ending.
So,
uh,

1066
01:04:50.771 --> 01:04:55.570
that's why I'm still here on my space.
I like it.
It's a quiet bar now.

1067
01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:59.200
You know,
they can put the game on.
I could sit here,
sip on my drink,

1068
01:04:59.470 --> 01:05:03.880
having a good fucking time.
Dot.
All these crazy kids,
you know,

1069
01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:09.160
it's like a dive.
That's why I like my space.
It's like a dive bar right now,

1070
01:05:09.850 --> 01:05:13.910
you know?
No.
Okay.
Maybe it isn't.

1071
01:05:13.911 --> 01:05:16.940
Maybe I'm just a fucking loser.
It really is just a vast wasteland here.

1072
01:05:16.941 --> 01:05:20.350
I'm living a lie to you.
I just,
it's just whores and musicians.

1073
01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.790
That's all that's left here.
Um,
and one lonely comedian.
All right,

1074
01:05:24.791 --> 01:05:28.690
let's get to some feedback here.
This is from a woman,
um,
from a couple of weeks,

1075
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:33.040
weeks ago when I was trashing that Carrie Underwood's song.
She said,

1076
01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:36.460
I am a woman and I've recently become a regular listener to your podcast.

1077
01:05:36.461 --> 01:05:41.170
I was listening to your July 6th podcast and laughed uncontrollably.

1078
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.250
I actually liked,

1079
01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:46.030
I actually liked that Carrie Underwood's song and cannot argue with the things

1080
01:05:46.031 --> 01:05:46.864
you said.

1081
01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:51.490
The two piece combination to the cabbage comment was fricking hilarious.

1082
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:54.970
Just thought you should hear it from a woman.
That was awesome.
All right,

1083
01:05:54.971 --> 01:05:57.940
well you know what h well we could thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

1084
01:05:57.941 --> 01:05:59.800
And just because you brought that up,

1085
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:03.820
I'm going to actually give you the history behind the two piece combination to

1086
01:06:03.821 --> 01:06:08.821
the cabbage actually where I heard that and was actually a sleigh.

1087
01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:10.450
I gave a variation of it.

1088
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:15.960
I was on my way to do a standup Gig in one of the outer boroughs in New York.

1089
01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:17.770
Um,

1090
01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:22.810
and I was with somebody and they were pissed at somebody else and they were

1091
01:06:22.811 --> 01:06:27.811
saying how they were going to kill him and they were not joking and they were

1092
01:06:28.031 --> 01:06:32.500
going off and just like,
you know this motherfucker,

1093
01:06:32.501 --> 01:06:35.920
this is my fucking dad.
I'm going to fuck on bookbub.
Abolish Shit.

1094
01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.290
And he was basically,

1095
01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:44.230
and I'm looking at the Duke because he really,
you know,
you know,

1096
01:06:44.231 --> 01:06:45.820
some people just say,
I'm going to fucking kill this guy.

1097
01:06:45.821 --> 01:06:47.710
This guy was dead serious.

1098
01:06:47.711 --> 01:06:52.120
So it was kind of an awkward moment know I'm just sort of like nod and you know,

1099
01:06:52.121 --> 01:06:55.060
trying to act like I hear somebody everyday tell me that they're going to kill

1100
01:06:55.061 --> 01:06:57.880
another human being.
And uh,

1101
01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:03.180
he was talking about he was gonna shoot him in the head and he,

1102
01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:08.740
the way he put it,
he's
now granted I hadn't left up to this point.

1103
01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.620
He said he was gonna shoot him in the head.

1104
01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:15.730
And then there was this awkward silence and then he just says a throw of late

1105
01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:17.230
throwaway line.
He just,

1106
01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.900
he said two beans to the cabbage and it was like a half second pause.

1107
01:07:25.901 --> 01:07:28.090
And I just started roaring laughing,

1108
01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.230
which got him laughing and then we were just fucking laughing.

1109
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:36.880
And then he kept trying to say,
no,
I'm serious son as he's fucking laughing.

1110
01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:40.690
And it was just one of those great fucking moments and nobody ended up getting

1111
01:07:40.691 --> 01:07:43.780
killed at the end of it.
And it was just something that's just stuck.

1112
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.650
It's not the beans,
it's the cabbage.
There's just something,

1113
01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:51.070
there's something about when you do damage to somebody's head that it literally,

1114
01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:55.750
cabbage is the,
I don't know why it's just perfect.
It's just perfect.

1115
01:07:55.751 --> 01:08:00.070
So,
uh,
that's how I got to cabbage reference.
And uh,

1116
01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.380
of course everyone was remade.
I didn't even tell you the borough.

1117
01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:06.520
See right there.
That's how you do it for the fuck am my kid.

1118
01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:09.550
And if anything ever happened and they dragged me and they wouldn't have to do

1119
01:08:09.551 --> 01:08:12.910
good cop,
bad cop,
all they'd have to do is slam the door.
And I'd be like,
okay,

1120
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:17.890
we were driving.
Oh,
the [inaudible] and anyways,
sorry,

1121
01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:22.310
here's a fucked up new story for you.
Ah,
Shit.
God Damn.
Pizza Shit computer.

1122
01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:26.480
Um,
or maybe it's the person operating it.
All right,
here we go.

1123
01:08:26.481 --> 01:08:30.440
He's a fucked up new story that somebody sent me.
A lacrosse woman.

1124
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:32.780
Now this is not a woman who plays Lacrosse.

1125
01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.020
It's a woman from a town evidently called Lacrosse.

1126
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.000
And this story is so fucked up that I actually researched it on the internet.

1127
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:42.050
And by research,

1128
01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.730
I mean I did a quick search and I clicked on the first story and it agreed with

1129
01:08:46.731 --> 01:08:50.960
me and therefore it became fact.
So with that background,

1130
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:54.650
let's read the story.
All right.
I lacrosse woman,

1131
01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.990
a woman from Lacrosse,
uh,

1132
01:08:56.991 --> 01:09:01.040
is accused of stabbing her boyfriend Tuesday after she caught him watching

1133
01:09:01.041 --> 01:09:05.690
pornography and masturbating according to Lacrosse police reports.

1134
01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:09.440
Okay.
She caught him watching pornography and masturbating.

1135
01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:12.950
So she allegedly stabbed him.
Uh,

1136
01:09:12.951 --> 01:09:15.410
Rachel Ferrara,
23,

1137
01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:20.330
founder of 24 year old boyfriend inside her home.
Um,

1138
01:09:20.331 --> 01:09:25.331
the couple argued and four are accused the man of explicative being a,

1139
01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:30.500
an an explicative cheat or being a fucking cheater because evidently he was

1140
01:09:30.501 --> 01:09:33.230
masturbating to pornography.
Uh,

1141
01:09:33.231 --> 01:09:35.690
she evidently punched him twice in the abdomen,

1142
01:09:35.691 --> 01:09:38.870
kicked him in the groin a four hour,

1143
01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:43.330
then back the man into the kitchen,
which I know a lot of people like that.

1144
01:09:43.331 --> 01:09:45.880
And they,
oh,
a woman couldn't back a man and the,

1145
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:50.210
yes she can because we can not lay a hand on you.
So when you go psycho,

1146
01:09:50.211 --> 01:09:54.830
that's what you do.
You back into the room going,
honey,
relax,
relax.
Crazy.

1147
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:59.390
He take a couple of more,
you know,
put you,
you try to do the George for me.

1148
01:09:59.391 --> 01:10:03.120
You know,
George Foreman covers up his body.
Layton is a query.

1149
01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.550
You got one forum soda in front of your face and the other one below you.

1150
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:11.420
It's almost like you're starting to cross your arms to do that run DMC thing,

1151
01:10:11.421 --> 01:10:15.470
but you stopped midway,
you know,
like the end of chips.

1152
01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:20.330
Um,
anyways,
God bless you if he got that joke.
All right.
Uh,

1153
01:10:20.331 --> 01:10:22.400
so for hour then back,
the man is the kitchen.

1154
01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:27.670
She grabbed a five inch serrated knife and slashes arms before stabbing him in

1155
01:10:28.221 --> 01:10:31.490
the abdomen.
According to reports,
uh,

1156
01:10:31.491 --> 01:10:34.850
she reportedly refused as attempts to calm down,
calm her down,

1157
01:10:34.851 --> 01:10:38.990
and she screamed at him to leave.
The man drove himself to Gunderson,

1158
01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:43.040
a blood or a medical center where he was treated and release.
Uh,

1159
01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:47.510
the woman Ferrara was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct while armed and

1160
01:10:47.511 --> 01:10:49.190
recklessly endangering safety.

1161
01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:52.970
She's expected later today in Lacrosse County Circuit Court.

1162
01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:58.010
So the man who sent me this said really disorderly conduct while armed and

1163
01:10:58.011 --> 01:10:59.840
recklessly endangering safety.

1164
01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:04.880
If I as a guy went and stabbed my girlfriend and the abdomen because she had a

1165
01:11:04.881 --> 01:11:06.290
vibrator in her Twat,

1166
01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:11.840
I would get charged with attempted murder and possibly rape.

1167
01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.210
But I guess that's why we make a dollar more an hour.
Oh Shit.

1168
01:11:15.211 --> 01:11:18.090
Did I just steal one of your jokes?
Oh,
well sincerely.

1169
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:22.800
And then he names the name of a comedian who's known for stealing jokes.

1170
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:27.030
Um,
yeah,
that is a kind of a light charge.
Wouldn't you say?

1171
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:29.281
You know,

1172
01:11:29.281 --> 01:11:33.240
I'm not sitting here saying that she actually did any of this shit because I

1173
01:11:33.241 --> 01:11:38.220
understand that when I know what alleged means.
Okay.
But my thing is what a,

1174
01:11:38.221 --> 01:11:42.490
you know,
if she did do this shit,
which they're trying to,
uh,

1175
01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:46.020
prove disorderly conduct,

1176
01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:51.050
well armed and recklessly endangering safety.

1177
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:54.840
Now what does that mean to you guys?
Okay.

1178
01:11:55.410 --> 01:12:00.270
If I told you I was arrested of disorderly conduct while armed and recklessly

1179
01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:03.960
endangering safety,
you know what that would mean.

1180
01:12:03.961 --> 01:12:08.961
That would mean I'm at a gun range and I'm shit faced and I didn't properly

1181
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:14.280
holster my,
my weapon after I shot at a paper target.

1182
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:17.070
That's kind of what it seems like,
you know,

1183
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:20.230
or maybe I'm doing something,
you know,

1184
01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.220
I'm trying to shoot a bottle rocket out of my asshole or I dunno.

1185
01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:28.830
I Dunno what,
you know what I mean?
But that we would,
you know,

1186
01:12:28.831 --> 01:12:30.300
if I told you I got arrested for that Shit,

1187
01:12:30.301 --> 01:12:34.200
you wouldn't thought that I fucking stab somebody,
you know,

1188
01:12:34.201 --> 01:12:38.880
slash their arms and then fucking stabbed him.
You know,

1189
01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.250
I don't understand.

1190
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:48.030
When is the world going to understand that whoever is wielding a knife,

1191
01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:50.400
if they stab somebody,
you know,

1192
01:12:50.401 --> 01:12:54.450
regardless of their sex that is attempted murder,

1193
01:12:56.610 --> 01:13:01.470
isn't it?
That's fucking unreal.
I got to tell you something.
Uh,

1194
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:04.860
I'm going to go see that movie coming out.
I think it's called orphan.

1195
01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.290
I don't know what with that little scary girl in it where they,
they,
they uh,

1196
01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:13.120
they rescue this girl like some fucking psycho pit bull,

1197
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:16.320
like the one that I have.
Um,
oh my God,

1198
01:13:16.321 --> 01:13:19.410
she had a fucking dream the other night and fuck you,
you dude from England.

1199
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.240
All right.
You fast forward through this shit.

1200
01:13:21.241 --> 01:13:24.600
I don't give a fuck do from a couple of weeks ago.

1201
01:13:24.601 --> 01:13:26.130
He says he can't stand my stories about it.

1202
01:13:26.131 --> 01:13:28.230
I'm going to fucking tell when every week just to annoy you.

1203
01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.260
This is how crazy shelter dogs are.

1204
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:35.280
My fucking dog is laying there and I'm about,
and I'm like,
you know,

1205
01:13:35.281 --> 01:13:38.330
drifting off to sleep and all of a sudden I'm hearing like

1206
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.450
<v 14>or</v>

1207
01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:46.390
<v 12>right.
And it's like seeping into my dream.
I,
you know,
I'm fucking,
I don't know,</v>

1208
01:13:46.391 --> 01:13:49.810
talking to some whore in my dream and all of a sudden she turns into like a bear

1209
01:13:49.811 --> 01:13:54.310
or some shit,
right?
So I fucking wake up.
I'm like fuck.
And the dream is,

1210
01:13:54.311 --> 01:13:58.530
then I'd look over and there's my damn Doug sound asleep moving.

1211
01:13:58.550 --> 01:14:02.980
One of his paws gone
doing that shit.

1212
01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:07.570
So I dunno what the fuck to do,
right?
You know,

1213
01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.080
you're not supposed to wake a sleeping,
sleep walk and human being.

1214
01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:16.120
What do I do with the fucking psycho pitbull that's evidently having words with

1215
01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:20.560
somebody in a goddamn dream.
So I decided to wake her up.
I was like,
Cleo,

1216
01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:21.880
Cleo,
cleo.

1217
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:25.210
And then she immediately just sort of woke up and then looked at me and just

1218
01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:27.910
started wagging her tail.
Like,
oh,
hey,
how's it going?

1219
01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:30.400
And then just put her head back down again.

1220
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:33.010
Like all that shit just didn't happen.
It's just fucking

1221
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:38.870
the fucking things.
Nuts.
All right,
let's get back to the,
uh,
let's get back to,

1222
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:42.490
I want to see that movie,
that movie a orphan there.
Um,

1223
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:45.910
which is,
uh,
you know,
I was just,

1224
01:14:45.911 --> 01:14:48.940
there's something about women when they're the bad guy.
It,
I,

1225
01:14:48.941 --> 01:14:53.050
it's extra scary to me.
You know what I'm talking about,
a guy being a maniac.

1226
01:14:53.051 --> 01:14:57.880
I know.
You just look at it.
They had fuck that guy.
Fuck him.
I,
you know,

1227
01:14:57.881 --> 01:14:59.320
whatever.
I'd drop,
kick them.
You know,

1228
01:14:59.321 --> 01:15:02.680
you just think shit like that for the most part.
But there's something about,

1229
01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:07.690
I dunno if it's,
they've always freaked me out and for some reason,
you know,

1230
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:12.760
I was thinking about that.
How like women,
you know,
women be in the,
uh,

1231
01:15:12.761 --> 01:15:17.380
the Michael Myers to me is way more scary than the guy.
Um,

1232
01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:22.740
and I remember when I wave back in like 82 or 83 when I first got cable,

1233
01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.920
um,
I was watching late night and I can't even,
you know,

1234
01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:31.150
I really feel bad for people of this generation who have just grown up with

1235
01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:31.984
cable.

1236
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:36.490
You have no idea how fucking insane cable is.

1237
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.800
You have no idea.
We had three networks to uhs and that was it.

1238
01:15:41.801 --> 01:15:45.670
And nobody cursed,
no titties,
no nothing.
It was,

1239
01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.010
it was unbelievable.

1240
01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:52.990
Unbelievable when that shit came out.
So anyways,

1241
01:15:53.410 --> 01:15:58.410
so I'm watching late night and I was watching this movie and I looked it up on

1242
01:15:58.841 --> 01:15:59.381
youtube.

1243
01:15:59.381 --> 01:16:04.000
It's actually the movie is called curtains and uh,

1244
01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:07.480
it has one of the most bizarre fucked up scenes.
You know,

1245
01:16:07.481 --> 01:16:11.860
I went back and I watched it.
It really didn't hold up over time.
Um,

1246
01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.890
but back in the day it really fucking freaked me out.
Um,
it basically,

1247
01:16:17.891 --> 01:16:22.891
there's a scene in that movie curtains where there's a girl who's out on a pond

1248
01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:29.140
and she's fucking take,
I can't even explain it for,
I forget,

1249
01:16:29.141 --> 01:16:31.480
cause I haven't seen the movie in so long.
The clip I watched,

1250
01:16:31.481 --> 01:16:35.860
she's basically uncovering snow and you think it's a dead body,

1251
01:16:35.861 --> 01:16:38.860
but it's a doll underneath.
And then she's holding it up.

1252
01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:42.700
The doll has a weird look on her face and then there's sort of cutting to these

1253
01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:47.410
fucking ice skates slowly in slow motion,

1254
01:16:47.411 --> 01:16:50.470
just beginning to skate across the pond towards this girl.

1255
01:16:50.471 --> 01:16:55.420
And of course she has no idea that this fucking thing is coming towards her and

1256
01:16:55.421 --> 01:16:58.900
they just show it from a distance and it just looks like a person.

1257
01:16:58.901 --> 01:17:02.740
And as it gets closer and closer,
it just,

1258
01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:06.700
it's this fucking psycho.
I think it's a woman,
I can't even remember,

1259
01:17:06.701 --> 01:17:08.980
but it looks like a woman's got a female face,

1260
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:13.850
like a which face with long hair and she skating like she speed skate and then

1261
01:17:13.851 --> 01:17:16.040
she pulls out like this fucking sickle.

1262
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:22.140
I can't exceed.
It's fucked up,
right?
I mean,
I don't know dude.

1263
01:17:22.141 --> 01:17:24.900
I went from Barney Miller to that.
That was,

1264
01:17:24.901 --> 01:17:27.900
that's what it was like to have no cable and then to have that,

1265
01:17:27.901 --> 01:17:31.800
and I'm like literally 12,
13 fucking years old.
The movie's called curtains.

1266
01:17:31.801 --> 01:17:35.280
Just look it up.
Um,
it's the only part of the movie probably worth Worth Watch.

1267
01:17:35.281 --> 01:17:38.760
And you can actually watch the clip.
And when you're a,
when you're there,

1268
01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:43.740
there's another clip that you have to watch that kind of ties into this whole

1269
01:17:43.741 --> 01:17:47.550
thing where a women,
you know,
when they do violence shit,

1270
01:17:47.551 --> 01:17:50.970
they just don't get charged with the same stuff that a guy does.

1271
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:56.510
And if you really feel that there's no justice in the world ever when it comes

1272
01:17:56.911 --> 01:18:00.510
to females physically doing stuff to guys,

1273
01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:05.070
I have a video for you and I cannot take credit for this youtube video.

1274
01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:08.790
Um,
this isn't even youtube video of the week.

1275
01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:12.480
It's not youtube video of the month as far as I'm concerned.

1276
01:18:12.481 --> 01:18:15.000
This is youtube video of the fucking year.

1277
01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:18.240
This is what I want you guys to Google right here.
Go whatever.

1278
01:18:18.241 --> 01:18:23.130
Go on Youtube and search.
Tough talk and college girl.
All right,

1279
01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:26.820
somebody sent me this clip.
It is unbelievable.
Okay.

1280
01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:31.170
And toughest spelled t u.
F.
F.
Okay.

1281
01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:34.140
And it basically in result balls,
the classic scenario,

1282
01:18:34.141 --> 01:18:37.790
the hot chick in the bikini,
there's some guy hitting on her.

1283
01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:40.980
She uh,
starts giving him shit back.

1284
01:18:40.981 --> 01:18:45.450
He gives her shit and then she throws a drink in his face,
you know,

1285
01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:50.190
and then turns around and walks away because that's what you do when you throw a

1286
01:18:50.191 --> 01:18:52.950
fucking drink in somebody's face.
You just walk away.

1287
01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:58.510
You know?
Now as a guy,

1288
01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:01.660
I feel bad for guys of whoever's fucking listen to this right now and you're not

1289
01:19:01.661 --> 01:19:05.020
near a fucking computer cause you really just need to watch it.

1290
01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:10.000
You really need to watch it because in a perfect world this is what you'd be

1291
01:19:10.001 --> 01:19:13.690
able to do as a guy.
All right,

1292
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:18.640
now I don't,
I have to talk about this video.
I,
you know,
spoiler alert,

1293
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:20.170
I'm going to tell you what the fuck happened.

1294
01:19:20.171 --> 01:19:25.171
So if you want to hit pause and fucking watched a video or if you want to listen

1295
01:19:25.271 --> 01:19:27.490
to me talk about the video,
this is,

1296
01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.610
I'm battling right now to give you that opportunity.
Okay?

1297
01:19:30.611 --> 01:19:33.580
Cause I'm going to ruin what the fuck happens.
Okay,

1298
01:19:33.610 --> 01:19:37.210
I'm going to talk about it in three,
two,
one.
All right,
here we go.

1299
01:19:37.211 --> 01:19:40.600
So she throws the fucking drink in his face and just turns around and walks
away.

1300
01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:44.470
Okay.
Cause that's what happens in movies.
Nothing ever happens.

1301
01:19:44.471 --> 01:19:45.340
And not to mention,

1302
01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:49.140
if you ever do go to make a move on some girl who does some shit like that to

1303
01:19:49.150 --> 01:19:51.070
these,
usually a couple of bounces there to choke you out.

1304
01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:54.850
Basically the scenarios that are outside of the pool,
you know,

1305
01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:58.630
I can't defend the kid who got the drink thrown in his face.

1306
01:19:58.631 --> 01:20:02.950
He definitely kind of looks like a,
he could be a bit of a Douche,
but whatever.

1307
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:06.670
He's got the balls to walk up to this hot chick that back in the day when I was

1308
01:20:06.671 --> 01:20:10.470
his,
I wouldn't have the balls to walk up to.
So I give the kid props.
Okay.

1309
01:20:10.471 --> 01:20:15.150
But he does have his sunglasses dangling from his ears and hanging underneath

1310
01:20:15.151 --> 01:20:18.630
his chin.
So right there,
the Douche level of that guy's pretty fucking high,

1311
01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:22.890
so whatever.
So she throws the fucking drink in his face and just walks away.

1312
01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:23.790
You know,

1313
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:26.550
she doesn't give a shit that he's got to go home and change or he's got to stand

1314
01:20:26.551 --> 01:20:31.551
there and be sticky in 80 degree weather outside the fucking the pool.

1315
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.570
So he immediately,
you know,

1316
01:20:33.571 --> 01:20:36.960
it takes a half a pause and then just fucking walks up to the girl and she's

1317
01:20:36.961 --> 01:20:40.600
still trying to act tough.
She's like,
what?
You know you like when white girls,

1318
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:44.760
because they've watched reality TV now know how to act ghetto.
She's like what?

1319
01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.280
And throws the empty plastic cup down on the ground.

1320
01:20:47.281 --> 01:20:50.610
Like she's going to do something.
All right.
And the dude,

1321
01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:53.430
I thought he was going to wind up and blast or in the face.

1322
01:20:53.431 --> 01:20:57.030
So at this point I'm watching it with one eye cause I don't give a fuck what a

1323
01:20:57.031 --> 01:21:01.410
girl does.
You never want to see or get his fucking closed fist did.
It's,

1324
01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.620
it's just,
it's ugly even though she threw the drink.
But the dude

1325
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:10.080
fucking just,
I had to watch it twice to see what he does.

1326
01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:15.090
He does a fucking leg sweep that,
that I swear to God,

1327
01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:18.180
he could've beat one of the Gracies with one of this.
He just,

1328
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.850
it's like the girl standing up and then she is not,
he just went,

1329
01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.530
I can't believe like from her knees down,

1330
01:21:25.531 --> 01:21:29.030
both those parts of her legs didn't fly off like a mortar hit him.

1331
01:21:29.031 --> 01:21:31.440
That's how fucking he just fucking,

1332
01:21:31.441 --> 01:21:33.900
I'm like literally standing up acting it out again.
Huh?

1333
01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:36.470
This is like when I told the Rosebowl story back in the day,
right.

1334
01:21:36.471 --> 01:21:41.471
He literally just fucking leg sweeps her and she just calls down to the ground

1335
01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:44.730
and she hits the back of her head and the concrete and that's the part where

1336
01:21:44.731 --> 01:21:46.590
you're like,
Ooh,
not good.

1337
01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.400
Funny until the back of the head hits the concrete.

1338
01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:52.180
But she immediately goes like,
oh,

1339
01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:58.200
screaming basically sounding the alarm for all the guys to come and rescuer,

1340
01:21:58.470 --> 01:22:03.300
which they kind of don't,
they kind of all stand up like,
hey dude,
whoa,

1341
01:22:03.301 --> 01:22:07.350
what's going on?
You know,
and uh,
and I,
you know,
why did I try to describe it?

1342
01:22:07.351 --> 01:22:10.770
I can't do justice.
You have to see this tough talk in college girl,

1343
01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.930
just Google and spelled tough.

1344
01:22:12.931 --> 01:22:16.110
T U F F and I swear to God,

1345
01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.220
like I said,
I don't advocate hitting a woman.

1346
01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:25.800
And I think women should respect that rather than take advantage of it.

1347
01:22:25.801 --> 01:22:30.090
And I really think if you take a full drink and you throw it in somebody's face,

1348
01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:35.070
you're really taking advantage of that.
A man should never hit a woman.
Okay.

1349
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:40.320
And uh,
I really have to be honest with you.
If the guy punched her in the face,

1350
01:22:40.321 --> 01:22:41.640
I would have said he was a Douche.

1351
01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:45.410
But there's something about a leg sweep that it had a,
uh,

1352
01:22:45.411 --> 01:22:49.320
a gentleman quality to it.
You know,
in fact,

1353
01:22:49.321 --> 01:22:52.920
that's the comment I left under the first time the video is update was taken

1354
01:22:52.921 --> 01:22:57.720
down.
But the comment I left was leg sweep equals gentlemen,

1355
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:04.530
I gotta be honest with you.
I've seen girls get punched.

1356
01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.490
I've seen them get slapped.

1357
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:10.900
<v 0>Okay.
I've seen a Guy Shaker girl,
I've seen a dude,
choker girl,</v>

1358
01:23:10.901 --> 01:23:13.000
none of this I advocate,
but I've seen all that.

1359
01:23:13.001 --> 01:23:17.590
I have never seen somebody go for the leg sweep.
And it was,

1360
01:23:17.591 --> 01:23:21.940
it was,
uh,
it was,
it was surprising.
You know what I mean?

1361
01:23:21.941 --> 01:23:24.520
It's like when you see a movie and you think you know how it's going to end,

1362
01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:29.410
like oh Jesus.
And then the hero comes in and the white horse and then no,
no,

1363
01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:33.460
Leonardo Dicaprio gets popped in the fucking elevator and you're like,
Holy Shit.

1364
01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.850
Holy Shit,
I didn't see that comment.
That's what,

1365
01:23:36.851 --> 01:23:38.530
that's what that fucking leg sweep was like.

1366
01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:43.180
It was like seeing DiCaprio get popped in the departed fucking phenomenal

1367
01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:47.860
youtube video of the year.
Why don't we have that?
That's a new segment here on,

1368
01:23:47.861 --> 01:23:52.270
uh,
my Monday morning podcast.
Let's,
let's have nominees.
Okay.

1369
01:23:52.271 --> 01:23:54.550
Cause when they nominate the Oscars,
it's usually like two,

1370
01:23:54.551 --> 01:23:57.820
three months ahead of time.
That's what we'll have in December.

1371
01:23:57.850 --> 01:23:58.870
You guys just remind me,

1372
01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:03.580
we will have the nominees for youtube video of the year for me.

1373
01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:09.100
Okay.
Uh,
that movie is like the equivalent to that.

1374
01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.040
Uh,
I'm not gonna say there will be blood.

1375
01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:17.100
It's more like no country for old men and all that kid should just hang up,

1376
01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:21.510
<v 12>bowl cut and just not blinked when he fucking did it.
And,
and that,</v>

1377
01:24:21.511 --> 01:24:26.340
that I would have bought it on DVD.
Um,
all right.
So there you go.

1378
01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:28.050
Okay.
Was that misogynistic enough?

1379
01:24:28.051 --> 01:24:30.660
We always have to have that moment in this fucking podcast.
All right,

1380
01:24:30.661 --> 01:24:33.840
let's wind it down here with the questions cause it's getting late.
And uh,

1381
01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.840
I gotta get up early here because I have a tee time.

1382
01:24:37.090 --> 01:24:40.380
[inaudible] stepped on the ball.
All right.
Questions.

1383
01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:46.230
Um,
hey Mr. Byrd,
how's that for making you feel?
Fucking old.

1384
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:49.320
It did,
it did make me feel it.
All right.
All right.
Um,

1385
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:52.050
I was just wondering what your thoughts on we're on,

1386
01:24:52.051 --> 01:24:54.180
why people are so easily offended,

1387
01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.120
especially by foul language.

1388
01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:01.800
I thought you might have some insight here as someone who uses the word cunt and

1389
01:25:01.801 --> 01:25:06.800
fuck quite regularly.
Um,
hey,
guilty as charged.
Um,
maybe,
um,

1390
01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:09.390
it has something to do with the fact that I live in the south,

1391
01:25:09.391 --> 01:25:13.680
but it seems like you dropped the f bomb here.
Oh,

1392
01:25:13.681 --> 01:25:14.514
I see what you're saying.

1393
01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:16.500
Maybe it has to do with the fact that I live in the south,

1394
01:25:16.501 --> 01:25:20.190
that if you drop the f bomb here or tell someone,
um,

1395
01:25:21.610 --> 01:25:22.360
<v 13>okay.</v>

1396
01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.270
<v 12>Tell someone with all,
all the fucking padding.</v>

1397
01:25:27.370 --> 01:25:29.980
Oh,
I didn't,
I enlarge this.
I am the worst reader.
I'm sorry guys.

1398
01:25:29.981 --> 01:25:31.290
Let me start this again.
Uh,

1399
01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.310
maybe it's something to do with the fact that I live in the south,

1400
01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:36.640
but it seems like if you dropped the f bomb here or tell,

1401
01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:41.230
tell something to someone without all the fucking padding and they just lose

1402
01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.220
their shit.
Um,

1403
01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:47.530
do you think this has something to do with the pussification of America or do

1404
01:25:47.531 --> 01:25:52.030
most people just grow up in a household where ball busting?
Oh,

1405
01:25:52.031 --> 01:25:55.600
do most people not grow up in a household where a ball busting is commonplace?

1406
01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:59.380
Um,
I dunno,
you know,
when I go across America,
I don't see a lot of pussies.

1407
01:25:59.381 --> 01:26:04.280
I see a lot of psychos.
I just think in general that,
um,
this country has,

1408
01:26:05.210 --> 01:26:09.530
you know,
just really the become corporate and they cast a wide net.

1409
01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:14.780
They're always commercial fishing,
so they're trying not to offend people.

1410
01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:20.150
So a lot of the shows on TV have sort of been a dumbed down I think,

1411
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:22.430
but in general,
I mean,

1412
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:27.170
I live in America and I say fucking cunt all the time as do all of my friends.

1413
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:33.680
And uh,
there you go.
So I'm defining America by how I behave.

1414
01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:39.470
Um,
I dunno.
I think,
I think certain people grow up,
uh,

1415
01:26:39.471 --> 01:26:41.360
with ball busting and other people don't.

1416
01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.780
And the reality is everybody has a different line.

1417
01:26:45.230 --> 01:26:49.400
And I think the real thing is that people who get offended are way more

1418
01:26:49.401 --> 01:26:52.010
organized.
Um,

1419
01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.240
and they complain and they write letters and people who don't give a fuck,

1420
01:26:56.990 --> 01:27:01.190
don't give a fuck enough to write a letter to say,
I don't give a fuck.
You know,

1421
01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.140
so there you go.
Did you guys hear that Burp?

1422
01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:06.590
That was one of those internal burps that I heard in my head and I can't tell if

1423
01:27:06.591 --> 01:27:11.360
that was out loud.
All right.
Um,
all right,
let's move on to the next one.
Um,

1424
01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:16.100
hey bill,
big fan love you.
Coon muddy and you put kids to fucking hilarious.

1425
01:27:16.101 --> 01:27:20.720
Thank you very much.
Uh,
I appreciate that.
You do it for free.
Thank you.

1426
01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.550
Anyways,
I have a question for you.

1427
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:26.120
When a comedian such as yourself recorded a CD or a DVD,

1428
01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:31.190
is that a onetime shot or are you able to reshoot if you are unhappy with the

1429
01:27:31.191 --> 01:27:35.510
show?
Um,
it all depends.

1430
01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:40.040
Um,
I like in for the most part,
yeah,
if you do like a standup special,

1431
01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:43.220
you do a,
you do at least two shows.

1432
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:47.630
I was watching a guy recently on HBO hype and his special and he was talking

1433
01:27:47.631 --> 01:27:52.280
about working somewhere in Texas and he was going to do four shows and from the

1434
01:27:52.281 --> 01:27:54.440
four shows he was going to put together the special,

1435
01:27:54.441 --> 01:27:58.970
but for the most part you do at least two.
So this is how it's worked with me.

1436
01:27:58.971 --> 01:28:03.230
I did a CD called emotionally unavailable,
which is available on iTunes.

1437
01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:07.640
Um,
I really need a whore out my shit more too,
by the way.
Um,

1438
01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.100
but how I did that was,

1439
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:15.850
I taped that at the last house in Philadelphia and I was doing four shows to

1440
01:28:15.951 --> 01:28:19.160
Friday and two Saturday and I taped all the shows.

1441
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:24.850
I listen back to all the shows and I just liked the second show Saturday night

1442
01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:31.880
and I liked it and I got heckled and there was some awkward moments in it and it

1443
01:28:31.881 --> 01:28:34.340
just sounded like a show.

1444
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:39.320
And what I liked about the old school comedy albums that I used to listen to

1445
01:28:39.321 --> 01:28:43.160
when I was growing up as you really felt like,
um,

1446
01:28:43.670 --> 01:28:46.640
you were kind of in the nightclub when you were listening and that type of
thing.

1447
01:28:46.641 --> 01:28:49.130
And it just,
I don't know,
with all this protools stuff,

1448
01:28:49.131 --> 01:28:54.050
you can really make something sound really slick.
And I,
you know,

1449
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:57.380
I think I wrote that in the liner notes.
Wow.
I'm really going back a long way.

1450
01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:58.970
I think the liner notes I actually wrote,
like,

1451
01:28:58.971 --> 01:29:03.150
I didn't kind of want to splice together a performance that never really

1452
01:29:03.151 --> 01:29:06.120
happened,
you know?
So,
uh,

1453
01:29:06.121 --> 01:29:08.880
and then the other half was I was fucking lazy and it was true.

1454
01:29:08.881 --> 01:29:13.881
I wasn't going to go through four hours of fucking audio and just listening to

1455
01:29:14.161 --> 01:29:16.980
me do the same.
I just couldn't fucking do it.
So I was like,
you know what?

1456
01:29:16.981 --> 01:29:19.650
I liked that second show Saturday.
So that's how I did that.

1457
01:29:19.651 --> 01:29:23.040
That one on the Hbo one,
when I did my half hour,

1458
01:29:24.090 --> 01:29:28.080
there was a two tapings and my first show went really well.

1459
01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:29.790
So I knew I had a good special.

1460
01:29:29.791 --> 01:29:34.500
And then I came out the second one and the second one I was even more loose and

1461
01:29:34.501 --> 01:29:38.490
that one just went ridiculously great.
And afterwards the director was like,

1462
01:29:38.491 --> 01:29:38.821
you know what?

1463
01:29:38.821 --> 01:29:42.810
I think that second one was the one other than this one little joke.

1464
01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:45.120
So why don't we just take one little joke from the first one,

1465
01:29:45.121 --> 01:29:48.180
stick that in and the rest will be the second show.
And I said,
works for me.

1466
01:29:48.930 --> 01:29:50.460
So that's how that one went together.

1467
01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:54.570
And why do I do this was only one show.

1468
01:29:56.220 --> 01:30:01.170
Um,
that one.
And that was because of the budget.

1469
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:06.210
Uh,
we kind of waited a little too long to get a theater and we had to spend more

1470
01:30:06.211 --> 01:30:07.290
money than we thought.

1471
01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:11.910
And then in the end we only had the budget to do one of them.
So,

1472
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:16.710
um,
what you see is what you get on that one.
That was just one,
one take.

1473
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.680
And I left out some tags and that type of shit.

1474
01:30:20.190 --> 01:30:23.810
And it was kind of freaking me out in the beginning of the special.
Um,

1475
01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:28.140
if you look closely in my eyes,
you'll see it a couple of times.
Um,

1476
01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:30.720
but then I was just like,
well fuck it.

1477
01:30:31.290 --> 01:30:35.250
No one's going to know that I missed the tags,
you know,
this is the special bill.

1478
01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.940
Why don't you get present and fucking deliver it?
So I just,
you know,

1479
01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:45.210
um,
yeah,
that's how I did that one.
But,
um,
yeah,
basically speaking,

1480
01:30:45.211 --> 01:30:48.390
yeah,
you don't just do one unless you have no fucking budget.

1481
01:30:48.391 --> 01:30:50.190
Are you fucked up your budget or something like that.

1482
01:30:50.191 --> 01:30:53.760
So this one that I do and uh,
San Diego,

1483
01:30:53.850 --> 01:30:58.440
San Diego and San Francisco,
I am going to be doing to,
uh,

1484
01:30:58.470 --> 01:31:01.530
and also I'm going to be doing a bunch of fucking roadwork before,
uh,

1485
01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:05.130
before I come up to it.
So I'm going to be extra ready.
Um,

1486
01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.730
and I actually learned something last time when I did an hour,

1487
01:31:08.970 --> 01:31:13.260
basically when I did my half hour,
if HBO was on the road doing 50 minutes,

1488
01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:15.150
so to do a half hour,
it was a joke.

1489
01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.720
It's kind of like if you're doing cardio for 50 minutes and then one day he did

1490
01:31:18.721 --> 01:31:20.880
30 be easy.
So,

1491
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:24.780
but what I wasn't doing when I trained for the hour was when I was doing the

1492
01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:29.100
hour I was doing right about an hour.
So,
um,

1493
01:31:29.130 --> 01:31:33.690
it felt like more work than doing the half hour.
Um,

1494
01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:35.580
so this time when I go through,

1495
01:31:35.581 --> 01:31:38.700
I'm going to be doing at least an hour and 10 an hour and 15 minutes.

1496
01:31:38.730 --> 01:31:43.410
When I'm on stage,
especially September,
um,
September,

1497
01:31:43.411 --> 01:31:46.590
October,
November,
I'm,
unless I'm doing three shows that night,

1498
01:31:46.591 --> 01:31:49.280
I won't do that cause I don't want to back it up,
you know.

1499
01:31:50.110 --> 01:31:54.000
But I got actually I am actually really against doing more than an hour on
stage.

1500
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:57.990
I think it becomes a,
you know,

1501
01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:00.520
people are just like all and we got it.

1502
01:32:00.521 --> 01:32:03.760
You're funny or we have to go to work tomorrow.
Okay,
my face hurts.

1503
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:06.970
It's like you're overselling.
I always feel like when you do more than an hour,

1504
01:32:06.971 --> 01:32:10.390
you're kind of overselling.
Although I did an hour and 13,

1505
01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:14.010
I just uploaded that one from San Francisco,
not where you guys can listen,

1506
01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:18.230
where I can listen to it and uh,
it actually holds together.
I think maybe a,

1507
01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:22.360
I just wasn't in shape enough to do it.
Uh,
but I just,
I don't know.
I just find,

1508
01:32:22.361 --> 01:32:25.810
you know,
once you get like an hour,
hour and 15,
it's like,
dude,
enough.
Enough.

1509
01:32:26.210 --> 01:32:28.330
All right.
Jesus Christ.
Bill,

1510
01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:31.420
let me fucking different ways you're going to answer that.
All right.
Overrated.

1511
01:32:31.421 --> 01:32:35.170
Underrated.
Then I'm going to get out of here.
Uh,
okay.

1512
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:40.180
Underrated.
Uh,
Bill Burr.
Thank you.

1517

How are the fuck is Kanye West's underrated?
Uh,

1522
01:33:20.250 --> 01:33:24.850
Um,

you know,
something.
I finally,
you know,
I,

1523
01:33:25.230 --> 01:33:28.030
I've gotten into some sort of old school like a hip hop,

1524
01:33:28.031 --> 01:33:31.390
but I just don't know what the fuck the listen to.
Um,

1525
01:33:31.410 --> 01:33:33.820
I've kind of talking like late eighties,
early nineties.

1526
01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:38.260
Anything pre biggie if he can,

1533
01:33:57.521 --> 01:34:00.010
if you can let me know,
give me the heads up on that.
I'd like,

1534
01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:04.720
I'd like to download some of that shit cause uh,
I dunno,
I'm into it now.

1535
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:08.160
I'm trying to play drums to it and it's fun again for a challenging.
All right.

1536
01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:12.230
Um,
another under really comics are overrated.
Here's an over 81,

1537
01:34:12.231 --> 01:34:14.020
and this is what kind of an obscure one,

1538
01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:18.490
a comp over a comics who do a visual bit during their specials,

1539
01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:21.700
um,
and acknowledged to the live audience.

1540
01:34:21.701 --> 01:34:24.940
How funny it is that the CD listeners are left out.

1541
01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:29.020
You made a funny face.
We get it.
Yeah.
You know what?
I think I've done that.

1542
01:34:30.190 --> 01:34:34.090
Or you're recording a CD and you do a visual joke and then you comment how

1543
01:34:34.091 --> 01:34:38.470
everyone at home isn't going to understand that joke.
We're all doing it.

1544
01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:41.020
All right.
Um,
last thing asked bill.

1545
01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:45.340
Hey Bill just started listening to uninformed last week.
Um,

1546
01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:50.650
and that's my,
uh,
show radio show that I do on a Sirius satellite radio,

1547
01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:54.490
Sirius Xm,
whatever the fuck they call it.
And you know what?

1548
01:34:54.491 --> 01:34:56.410
Somebody just sent me a fucking

1549
01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:02.120
a thing here on where the hell you could listen to those

1550
01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:07.790
bill.
Read this.
You Fag.
This is like the new thing everyone's doing.

1551
01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:10.790
Cause at one guy uninformed,
here we go.

1552
01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:15.970
Uh,
all right,
here's where you can listen to all the uninformed shows that,

1553
01:35:15.971 --> 01:35:20.240
that I've done with Joe to Rosa,
uh,
for free.
Um,

1554
01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:25.040
you can on mini,
mini,
Nova Dotcom,

1555
01:35:25.130 --> 01:35:29.210
m I,N ,
I,
mini,
m,
I,
N,
I,

1556
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:32.840
Nova and O v a all lowercase,
no spaces.com.

1557
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:35.690
Uh,
there you go.

1558
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:39.400
You can listen to all of them and we're going to start doing them again.
Uh,

1559
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:42.260
we had one here in July or even when the fuck they even put it out.

1560
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:46.130
Fucking disappointing how disorganized we are with that show.
But anyways,

1561
01:35:46.131 --> 01:35:50.600
let's get to ask bill here.
Bill,
just start lists to uninformed week ago.
Um,

1562
01:35:50.601 --> 01:35:53.510
I downloaded a package of all the shows done to date,

1563
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:58.730
hence the ancient reference.
Anyways,
uh,
you all cause I said no XM.

1564
01:35:58.770 --> 01:35:59.601
Uh,
anyway,

1565
01:35:59.601 --> 01:36:04.250
you mentioned a while ago that you were really socially awkward as a kid.

1566
01:36:04.670 --> 01:36:08.060
I'd love to hear how you overcame that.
I dropped out of high school at 16,

1567
01:36:08.061 --> 01:36:09.980
and it seems the more time I spent alone,

1568
01:36:09.981 --> 01:36:13.850
the harder it gets to inject myself into any situation that involves other human

1569
01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:17.360
beings.
I'm now 21,
apparently an adult,

1570
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:21.440
but anytime I have to uh,
have to do a task that may involve other people,

1571
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:22.640
it's a real problem.

1572
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:26.810
Even simple things like taking out the garbage or going grocery shopping,

1573
01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.880
make me shake and sweat.

1574
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:32.210
My situation is probably more severe than yours was,

1575
01:36:32.211 --> 01:36:35.390
but I'd love to hear any advice,
uh,
to uh,

1576
01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:40.220
to overcome this nonsense.
Um,
all right.

1577
01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:44.840
Uh,
okay.
Well,
all right,
where can I start with that shit?

1578
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:49.010
This is all right.
Here's how bad mine was.
I was literally,

1579
01:36:49.730 --> 01:36:53.630
I would like be at an ATM and if someone was standing behind me and I had two

1580
01:36:53.631 --> 01:36:54.500
transactions,

1581
01:36:54.501 --> 01:36:58.490
I would only do one and I would get out of line for fear that the person behind

1582
01:36:58.491 --> 01:36:58.581
me,

1583
01:36:58.581 --> 01:37:01.910
the second I started the second transaction would literally beat the shit out of

1584
01:37:01.911 --> 01:37:03.350
me.
Okay.

1585
01:37:03.351 --> 01:37:07.130
Now all this shit is going on in my head because that's how it worked in my

1586
01:37:07.131 --> 01:37:10.490
family growing up in now if you took too much time explaining,

1587
01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:13.070
I have a bunch of brothers,
so we ended up fist fighting.

1588
01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:15.440
But until you verbalize it out loud,

1589
01:37:15.441 --> 01:37:18.980
you don't realize how fucking ridiculous it is.
And uh,

1590
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:23.960
so I don't know what did I do?
I basically,
while to become a comedian,

1591
01:37:23.961 --> 01:37:28.730
I was in college at the time and what I did was I knew that I could barely give

1592
01:37:28.731 --> 01:37:31.820
a book report without my face turned beet red.

1593
01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:34.000
So what I did was I just started taking classes,

1594
01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:36.830
classes where I knew I'd have to get up in front of the class.

1595
01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:41.180
And the more I did it,
the more I enjoyed it and the more it just,

1596
01:37:41.181 --> 01:37:44.900
it felt awesome.
So what I would do is,
um,

1597
01:37:46.970 --> 01:37:50.930
I dunno,
uh,
I get out a piece of paper,
write out what your fear is.

1598
01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:54.410
Like what,
what do you,
what are you thinking is going to happen?

1599
01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.040
Cause another thing too,
man,

1600
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:01.070
you'll spend your whole life cowering over this great fear that only exists in

1601
01:38:01.201 --> 01:38:02.610
your fucking head.
And I swear to God.

1602
01:38:02.611 --> 01:38:05.190
And that is most times it's just for some shit,

1603
01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:10.860
that APP and when you were a kid and your brain was forming how it was going to

1604
01:38:10.861 --> 01:38:14.160
view the world and you just saw some shit or some shit happened to you at the

1605
01:38:14.161 --> 01:38:15.240
wrong fucking time.

1606
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:19.920
And then that shit just becomes law in your head as like a five year old,

1607
01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:21.571
you know,

1608
01:38:21.571 --> 01:38:26.070
and you'll literally 21 years old making dis fearful decisions of a five year

1609
01:38:26.071 --> 01:38:30.330
old and a believe me do what I did that.
And I can tell you this,
you know,

1610
01:38:30.331 --> 01:38:33.060
you're young enough,
we,
it's Kinda easy to undo that shit,

1611
01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:36.510
but if you wait later in life,
like I kind of did it with a lot of stuff.

1612
01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:37.231
What it is,

1613
01:38:37.231 --> 01:38:42.231
is that little seed of a fucked up thought kinda grows into this big fucking oak

1614
01:38:42.451 --> 01:38:46.890
tree that you got to hack down.
So what I would do is,
uh,

1615
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.920
you know,
um,
I dunno,
what the fuck can you do?
I don't know what,

1616
01:38:52.921 --> 01:38:56.010
I don't know what you do for a living.
I would,
you know,

1617
01:38:56.011 --> 01:39:00.000
try to be more social at work.
Try to shoot the shit,

1618
01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:03.960
uh,
get involved in something.
If you're good at sports,

1619
01:39:03.961 --> 01:39:06.090
join a softball league.
If you play an instrument,

1620
01:39:06.091 --> 01:39:10.710
start jamming with other people.
You got to get yourself into the mix of people.

1621
01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:12.960
And uh,
you know,
it's Kinda like a,
you know,

1622
01:39:12.961 --> 01:39:15.960
I knew somebody who really sucked at driving,
you know,

1623
01:39:15.961 --> 01:39:18.090
and they were freaking out about it and just sort of,
you know,

1624
01:39:18.091 --> 01:39:21.780
the more they did it,
it's just like stand up.
If you see I'm sweating,
God,

1625
01:39:21.781 --> 01:39:23.130
I would never show you guys these tastes.

1626
01:39:23.131 --> 01:39:25.790
But if you could ever see video of when I first started doing standup,

1627
01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:27.720
when I got on stage,
I was so fucking nervous.

1628
01:39:27.930 --> 01:39:30.870
I never stopped moving the whole time I was on stage.

1629
01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:33.960
I will get on stage and I would just pace the entire time.

1630
01:39:33.961 --> 01:39:36.900
That would be pouring sweat.
It's like,

1631
01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:40.950
it's almost like a performance art or,

1632
01:39:41.130 --> 01:39:44.250
or some avant garde cause it doesn't even fucking make sense when you watch it.

1633
01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:46.200
I can't believe I ever even gotten any laughs.

1634
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:50.640
But as the years went by and the more shows I did,
the more comfortable I got.

1635
01:39:50.641 --> 01:39:52.140
The more presence I could be.

1636
01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.160
And that's basically how to do it.

1637
01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:57.960
But don't be tough on yourself.

1638
01:39:57.961 --> 01:40:02.961
Just know you're going to bomb the same way I bombed as a comedian and uh,

1639
01:40:03.210 --> 01:40:07.800
I dunno,
find humor in your shortcomings,
you know,
and uh,

1640
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:10.770
just keep working on it.
And uh,
you know,
believe me,
dude,

1641
01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:12.870
you're not just going to start talking to somebody in the next day.

1642
01:40:12.871 --> 01:40:17.700
You're not going to be,
you know,
shy or whatever.
So give you,

1643
01:40:17.730 --> 01:40:22.560
give yourself permission to fuck up for a while as you work your way through it.

1644
01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:27.600
Don't do the shit where you kind of say half a sentence and then you get freaked

1645
01:40:27.601 --> 01:40:30.810
out and then you stop and then the person's looking at you like,
what the fuck?

1646
01:40:30.810 --> 01:40:35.100
And then you feel like a Douche and then you don't try it again until the next

1647
01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:38.730
decade.
That's not the way to go.
All right,
you're 21.

1648
01:40:38.731 --> 01:40:39.850
You should be out there drinking.

1649
01:40:39.851 --> 01:40:43.140
You should be out there banging fucking whores and,
uh,

1650
01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:46.170
having a good time because someday you're going to get married.

1651
01:40:46.530 --> 01:40:47.970
And even if you have a great marriage,

1652
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.960
the level of responsibility and the taxes and what the fucking bankers do to
you,

1653
01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:56.950
he life's going to suck.
So,
uh,
yeah,
you can do it.
Do it.

1654
01:40:56.951 --> 01:40:59.740
Don't,
don't,
don't,
don't fucking,
just don't be too hard on yourself.

1655
01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:02.140
That's the biggest thing.
When you're trying to learn new shit,
just know,

1656
01:41:02.141 --> 01:41:05.500
give yourself permission to suck at,
at the beginning and then Bam.
There you go.

1657
01:41:05.501 --> 01:41:08.920
How's that?
There's a nice feel,
good way to end this podcast.
You know,

1658
01:41:08.921 --> 01:41:12.730
I started off the fuck was I talking about coffee,

1659
01:41:12.731 --> 01:41:15.250
golf and then a leg sweep and a chick,
you know,

1660
01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:18.910
it was looked like it was going to go off the rails and look at it ended very

1661
01:41:18.911 --> 01:41:23.650
nicely.
See,
I'm not all bad.
Am I?
All right.
There you go.
Well,

1662
01:41:23.651 --> 01:41:26.920
there's your podcast for this week.
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
Uh,

1663
01:41:26.921 --> 01:41:30.280
you guys have a wonderful weekend.
If you're in the,
the,
uh,
the Denver area.

1664
01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:32.770
Hell if you're in Cheyenne,
Wyoming,

1665
01:41:32.771 --> 01:41:36.870
why don't you drive down and come down to my show and,
uh,

1666
01:41:37.890 --> 01:41:40.120
uh,
I was going to,
going to say,
I'll have a drink with you,
but I can't,

1667
01:41:40.121 --> 01:41:43.060
I got to fucking see.
I got to stay on point here.

1668
01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:45.250
I'll have a SAS Barilla with you.

1669
01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:48.220
I think I'll be doing like fucking cranberry juice and lime.

1670
01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:52.210
Is that what the fuck I'm going to do?
Jesus is going to be fucking brutal.
