00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.040
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.270
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.330
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.800
<v 0>checking in on you.
Just checking in on you.
How are you?</v>

5
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:23.970
How's your week going?
Oh,
don't worry.
It's almost over.

6
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.260
It starts day,
right?
Don't you get paid on Thursday?
Back in the day you did.

7
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.910
He get dead fucking check,
right.
They'll piece of paper with the numbers on it.

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.940
Then you go down to the bank,
you fucking,
you right on the back.

9
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.730
You stick it in the machine and then the numbers say you got this number right.

10
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.630
It's just a bunch of numbers.
It's all it is.
It's all,

11
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:50.070
it comes down to,
um,
I'm actually,
I'm in a great mood.

12
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:53.020
I got a great night's sleep last night.
Uh,

13
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.810
went out and visited some friends of mine.
It drove home about 80 miles an hour,

14
00:00:57.811 --> 00:01:02.220
85,
sometimes 90.
Oh,
I was cruising.
And even when,
you know,

15
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:05.850
they fixed the highways at night,
you know,
which totally makes sense.

16
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.760
You can't do it during the day,
but she always get mad at night.
You like,
Geez,

17
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:12.000
he's fucking cry.
Even if there isn't traffic,

18
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:16.140
they got an authentic traffic jam and you get all fucking mad.

19
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:20.130
Cause if fixing a highway it fuck at one 30 in the morning when you should be in

20
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:23.370
bed.
Right?
When the fuck else are they going to do it?

21
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:26.880
That's why I just kept telling myself as I was getting mad,
you know,

22
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:29.760
I'd be cruising along this fucking great.
This is great.

23
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:33.300
Looking at it is flying down the fucking highway.
90 fucking miles an hour.

24
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.640
You should be able to do this all the time.

25
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.940
24 seven get the population down where whenever I fucking want I can jump on the

26
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:42.930
highway happy.

27
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:47.460
Then five minutes right over right.

28
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.470
And then all of a sudden you come over the hill and you see that Arrow and then

29
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:56.240
you see the brake lights and eat us guy.
Ah Yeah,

30
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.250
fucking assholes.
You know.

31
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.780
Hey ACDC crankin cause I'm a middle aged,
not even middle aged.

32
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:06.690
I'm 47 times two is fucking 94.
Who's kidding?

33
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:11.400
Who you guys think all red face is going to make 95?
Um,

34
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.840
I'm an old fuck.

35
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.260
I'm an old white guy who likes Facebook and I'm listening to ACDC and I'm

36
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.094
rocking out

37
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.420
in my hybrid.
Oh yeah,
that's what I'm doing.

38
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:27.540
I'm doing everything to wearing those Mervyn's shoes where those fucking awful

39
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:30.150
shoes that people a little bit older than me were.

40
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.700
They wear them with no socks and dead jeans.

41
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.020
Those slip on fucking shoes that I think we're cool for like two weeks in like

42
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:40.560
1993 there.
Mervin's right?
Melvin's

43
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.890
what's a melon?
I'm Melvin.
Somebody fucking gives you a Wedgie.
Um,

44
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.030
who the fuck ever thought to do that?
You realize how funny that is?

45
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.600
Like I said,
well,

46
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.460
nobody thought to do it until it was pants and then once it was pants.

47
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:57.610
So he's just like,
God dammit.

48
00:02:57.611 --> 00:03:01.950
He sees a riding up on me and then it just wrote up on the wrong sadistic guy's

49
00:03:01.951 --> 00:03:03.210
ass.
And he's like,
you know what?

50
00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:06.180
What if I did that a lot quicker to somebody else?

51
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.280
A lot harder on purpose.

52
00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:13.281
Premeditated riding up with Jason when he heard the scream of uncomfortableness.

53
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.180
It warmed,
it's hard.
And then some others sadistic,
fuck it.

54
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:20.860
Or maybe just some fucking a,

55
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.860
you're like joke faith's except like a fucking bully.
Like thief.

56
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.910
One of bullies do that.
Like they see a bully bullying somebody else.

57
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.370
It'd be like,
you know,
I'm to,
I,
you know,
I'm going to do something like that.

58
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.090
We do my version of that.
Then the bully calls him out on Twitter.

59
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.160
Then there's a big dust up,
right.

60
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.890
Then they got to go on a bully podcast and clear the name.
Yeah.

61
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.000
Anyways,
um,
who knows,

62
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.060
who knows in this day and age of non controversies becoming controversies,

63
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:59.170
who knows what could happen.
Um,
yeah,
I'm in a great mood.

64
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.290
I got home one 30 in the morning,
I put on the Celtics.

65
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:04.390
I still haven't watched the Bruins beating the Canadians.

66
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:05.350
I know they'd beat to Canadians.

67
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:09.390
I'm fucking trying to do the basketball and hockey thing.
And um,

68
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.890
so I'm behind like two games with the Bruins and I know they got Vancouver

69
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:18.760
tonight and I just checked the standings.
What the fuck happened at the Canadians

70
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.840
by Boston?
Bruin heart was in my fucking throat when they started off at nine.

71
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:27.660
And Oh my God,
no,
they're going to end the drought this year.

72
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.050
They're going to end the drought and then what am I going to say?
I got nothing.

73
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:31.884
I already have.

74
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.100
The only thing I can say is how long it's been since they won their last one.

75
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:38.160
Cause other than that,
they can go like,
yeah,
well we got like 52 of them.

76
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.630
It's like,
yeah,
but you know,
the first 12,
you were beaten like,
you know,

77
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.750
the fucking Montreal Marauders,

78
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.870
the Quebec Con Keester doors,
you know,
you won best fucking,
uh,

79
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.400
best five out of nine,
whatever the fucking series was when you played on a pond.

80
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.620
Do you realize how fucked up it is in the Stanley Cup?

81
00:05:00.621 --> 00:05:04.270
Was the size of a shot glass,
you know,

82
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.640
hurry up and finish this game so we can have world war one.
Um,

83
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.400
that's really w I mean,
I don't give a fuck that they count those things.

84
00:05:10.401 --> 00:05:12.460
I just like teasing him about it.
Um,

85
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.080
even at just count the ones from the modern era,
we're never going to catch him.

86
00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:19.670
I realized that as a fan.
Um,
what was I gonna say?
The,
uh,

87
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.700
I still for the life of me do not understand as we are now at super bowl 50,

88
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.590
why NFL championships do not count it.

89
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.600
Nobody has ever been able to give me a logical explanation to that.

90
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.543
All right.

91
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.750
Is it because the two leaks combined rather than the NFL absorbed the AFL?

92
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.490
You know,
the way the NBA absorbed,
you know,
like four or five Aba teams.

93
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.890
Is that what it is?
But for the life of me,

94
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.840
it's like those championships were one,
they will wonder in those years,

95
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.960
like take like the eagles see eagles like,
oh,
they never want to fucking,

96
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.240
you know,
a Superbowl gives a fuck.
I mean,
it's sucks.
I mean,

97
00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:03.870
it's been a long fucking time,
but they did win a championship in 1960.

98
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.330
Okay.
And the way,
the way the NFL acts like that was caveman days.

99
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.270
Like Mickey Mantle was in the prime of his career.

100
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.630
Baseball still drops to their knees,
you know,

101
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.630
in an honor of that guy.
Okay.

102
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.920
And forget about fucking Babe Ruth,
you know.

103
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.970
<v 2>Okay.</v>

104
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.500
<v 0>Who Fuck,
he's,</v>

105
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.110
who's fucking Rehab was eating hot dogs and drink beer and catching up to the

106
00:06:31.111 --> 00:06:33.450
fucking the team on the train by,

107
00:06:33.451 --> 00:06:36.300
by jumping in a biplane.

108
00:06:36.301 --> 00:06:39.270
If he wasn't too fucking fat with weight and balance.
Right.

109
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.890
They could find a scarf long enough to,

110
00:06:40.891 --> 00:06:44.040
Rachael Brown has giant fucking elephant neck.
Right.

111
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.060
Why don't they count us
that mood?

112
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:53.660
Jim Brown's title doesn't count.
What was it,
64 65 the last time.

113
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:57.830
The browns warning slash.
Ravens.
Um,

114
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.400
I dunno.
I didn't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

115
00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:02.390
I thought it was in a good mood.
I'm already going country anyways.
Yeah.

116
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:04.970
I don't know what happened to the Canadians.
Like as of today,
they are one point.

117
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:07.610
They,
you know,
the season ended today,
they wouldn't make the playoffs.

118
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:10.130
So I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Canadians team,

119
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.600
I'll tell you those,
those Montreal Canadians,
they're very streaky.

120
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.380
<v 2>Okay.</v>

121
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.390
<v 0>I'll tell you right now,
if they're not looking unbeatable,</v>

122
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.770
they are looking a unwinnable I,
what are the fucking say?

123
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.090
Anyways,
let me plow ahead here.
So,
um,

124
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.070
I got to watch that game at some point,
but I'm,
uh,
I'm getting ready to do the,

125
00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:35.670
uh,
the Patrice O'Neal benefit,
the wonderful Patrice O'Neil,

126
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.070
the best comic I have a fucking saw.
Um,

127
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.380
<v 2>okay.</v>

128
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.810
<v 0>You know,
for my generation it's just,
it,
it's just a fact.</v>

129
00:07:42.811 --> 00:07:46.130
He's the best and a wonderful positive night of a,

130
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:51.120
of hilarity supporting the people that uh,
Patrice was taken care of.
All his,
his,

131
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:56.340
his loved ones.
Uh,
that is Tuesday.
And uh,
from what I hear it,
it's all sold out,

132
00:07:56.341 --> 00:08:00.270
but we will be releasing at the last second a few tickets,

133
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.560
um,
here or there,
which I guess is what they do at all conscious people.

134
00:08:04.561 --> 00:08:07.740
We say that going like,
you know,
oh I wanted to see fucking whatever,

135
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.050
whatever band,
you know,

136
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:14.650
and a dude you just like an hour before you just walk up and they release

137
00:08:14.651 --> 00:08:15.484
tickets.

138
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:20.250
That's like a sub sick fucking level of being able to get tickets,
you know,

139
00:08:20.251 --> 00:08:23.250
cause I'd be the Asshole,
I just go to fucking stubhub.
Speaking of which,

140
00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:25.140
I wanted to go see Bob Newhart.

141
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.400
Bob Newhart is doing a show out in the desert at some casino.
Right.

142
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.870
When I say out in the desert,
I mean the 10 east to like Luquita right.

143
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.860
He's out there cause uh,
you know that's a,
that's a,

144
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.190
I think that's his generation.
That's where they fucking,

145
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.980
that's where they retired.
You know that place was like,

146
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:48.450
that place was like a what Brooklyn is now.
Oh,

147
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.360
like silver lake out here.
Like where all the hipsters are.

148
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.720
That's what that was to his generation,
I think way back in the day.

149
00:08:54.721 --> 00:08:57.450
And those stayed out there and they retired that.
So I fucking go on.

150
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.860
I go on the inner web.
There is Richard Rawlings says on gas monkey.

151
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:04.560
I go on the interweb and he and I tried to get tickets,

152
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.050
sold the fuck out.

153
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:09.370
<v 2>Okay.</v>

154
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.100
<v 0>I was so upset that I couldn't get a fucking ticket.</v>

155
00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:13.210
But on the other level I'm like,

156
00:09:13.211 --> 00:09:16.930
this guy is 83 years old and he's still selling out the big room in a casino.

157
00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:21.850
You don't fucking awesome.
That is
credible,
you know,

158
00:09:21.851 --> 00:09:24.550
ridiculous is that he's worked clean his whole career and I'm sitting here

159
00:09:24.551 --> 00:09:27.640
cursing up a storm,
giving them compliments.
I'm going to figure out a way,

160
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.580
I'm going to get to that show.
It's so not January 29th.

161
00:09:30.581 --> 00:09:33.220
I'm going to figure out a way to get in there.
I don't know what I gotta do,

162
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:34.330
you know,
maybe I'll fuck it.

163
00:09:34.331 --> 00:09:36.400
Drive all the way out to desert and I'll stand around,
you know,

164
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.260
hoping that maybe a couple of audience members died.
The tickets got freed up.

165
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.500
Oh,
come on bill.
Let's,
let's,
let's,

166
00:09:47.501 --> 00:09:51.700
let's not take it to a negative place this close to the AFC and NFC championship

167
00:09:51.701 --> 00:09:56.590
games.
How could you do that?
You know,
speaking of dying,
by the way,

168
00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.620
speaking of death,
um,
you know,

169
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.890
I went on the Internet today and I was looking up,
uh

170
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.220
Oh,
where the fuck is it?
Oh,
here it is.
Here it is installed later.

171
00:10:09.221 --> 00:10:13.900
Get out of here.
Beat it.
Trying an hour.
Try it tonight.
Jesus.

172
00:10:13.901 --> 00:10:18.340
How can you be more fucking needy?
All right.
Where is it?

173
00:10:18.341 --> 00:10:19.330
New York City.

174
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:20.720
<v 2>Okay.</v>

175
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.460
<v 0>Discusses World's largest tax funded mass grave might be turned into a park.</v>

176
00:10:25.461 --> 00:10:26.600
And I lived in New York.

177
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.080
What bad dad dead starts spreading the news.

178
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.780
I'm wearing sweatpants,

179
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.710
I'm gunna go down to Tad's steaks,

180
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.040
Eddie some shit.

181
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:47.780
And I'll feel like I'm making it.
The air,
you know,

182
00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:50.240
successful New Yorkers think just cause they're in Manhattan.

183
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.780
You know what I mean?
Everybody looks at themselves like they're the star,

184
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:57.290
you know?
No one sees themselves as background,
you know what I mean?

185
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.920
You're the ones waving up at the Beatles.
You're not in the Beatles.

186
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.610
You understand?
You're the one in the crowd screaming.
You know,
fainting is,

187
00:11:04.611 --> 00:11:08.930
security takes you out.
As you look at it,
somebody's successful.
Right.

188
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.480
That's who you are.
Yeah.
Those people already on the subways.

189
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.310
They try to jam another person in there and the world needs you.

190
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.190
The world needs you.
Okay.

191
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.410
If I can go to white castle and a photo,
dope.

192
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:29.060
A cheeto those Burgers,
I'll be a fat fuck.

193
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.080
Yeah,
the Upper Dag,
I'm sorry.
All right.

194
00:11:33.081 --> 00:11:36.110
World's largest tax funded mass graves.
So there's an island out there,

195
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.690
which I had no idea.
Uh,

196
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.470
I mean I knew of Ellis Island and then is the island that the statue of Liberty

197
00:11:42.471 --> 00:11:45.380
is on.
Then I knew there was one that the navy owned or some shit,

198
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.570
but there's this other island out there dead.
Uh,

199
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.850
they just bury people that don't have any money or nobody knows who the fuck

200
00:11:52.851 --> 00:11:55.720
they are.
It's called Hart Island or is it tourism?

201
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.560
Boston would say fucking island.

202
00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.990
<v 3>Let's go out to,
maybe we can find a fucking uncle</v>

203
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.970
<v 0>got in trouble with the bookie.
Um,
hard island,
New York.</v>

204
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.930
Rosalie Grable looks down over rows of white pipes,

205
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.200
some broken or covered in mud sticking out of the dirt.

206
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.740
Each two marks the grave of 150 adults,

207
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.330
a dash homeless poor veterans and unclaimed individuals who couldn't afford

208
00:12:23.331 --> 00:12:28.331
anything but a spot in what's widely to believe to be the world's largest tax

209
00:12:28.941 --> 00:12:30.200
funded mass grave.

210
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.390
<v 2>Okay.</v>

211
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:36.170
<v 0>You know,
tax funded mass grave,
not mass grave cause believe me,</v>

212
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.070
I think,
isn't there one underneath the,

213
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.030
isn't there one underneath like Wall Street,

214
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.150
these massive curate a bunch of native Americans is some shit.

215
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:49.600
Then they just buried them all isn't not what they used to do back then.

216
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.310
All right.
That takes care of that.
Who wants to build a log cabin?
Right?

217
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.960
Lunatics.
Um,
so what of a Grable,

218
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.050
a 64 year old resident of the upper west,
upper west side,

219
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.340
once grass and wild flowers to hide the dirty white plastic.

220
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.570
She's come here to honor our mother who died in a hospital bed with no savings

221
00:13:10.571 --> 00:13:12.310
to leave to her daughter.
She said,

222
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:16.060
I'm still getting used to the idea that my mommy wound still calls her mommy.

223
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:20.650
That's creepy.
Uh,
wound up in a potter's grave.
I know.

224
00:13:20.651 --> 00:13:24.060
That's my mother.
I know that my mother was expecting something more true,

225
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:28.090
much more traditional.
I don't understand people who like when they die,

226
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:32.930
they want to have one of those above ground fucking like tubes.
You know,

227
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.730
like the,
it's like the above ground swimming pool of grave sites.
You know,

228
00:13:37.731 --> 00:13:40.640
it's like,
how fucking special do you think you are?
Because you're dead.

229
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.370
They should just have mass graves that you'd have a giant pit.
You just fucking,

230
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.320
you know,
the family doesn't need to see it,

231
00:13:48.321 --> 00:13:52.190
but yet is to fucking throw it in there though it in there and then use your

232
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.610
dissolve.
You become the next fossil fuel.
Right?

233
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.160
Think about all the fucking people that have lived in the world.

234
00:13:58.161 --> 00:14:02.180
If we had in one giant fucking massive grave in each country and it used

235
00:14:02.181 --> 00:14:03.470
whatever fucking you,

236
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.920
I don't know how the fuck he ended up turning into motor oil whenever Deli.

237
00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:09.770
That's what happens.
I know if you jump off a building,

238
00:14:09.771 --> 00:14:14.120
you explode like a water balloon because you're mostly water and I don't know if

239
00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:16.610
you eat a lot of Italian food,
you know like I do.

240
00:14:16.611 --> 00:14:19.880
You've got a lot of olive oil in you.
Who knows?
Maybe you like him,

241
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:24.680
help out somebody fucking lawn mower in the future.
That's what they should do.

242
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.960
Holy Shit that I just solved global warming.

243
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.270
Well maybe I solved the Middle East crisis.
Yeah.

244
00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:31.820
<v 3>And if elected,</v>

245
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:32.820
<v 2>okay,</v>

246
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:37.820
<v 3>I will begin burying all dead Americans are the same hall and a hundred years</v>

247
00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:43.461
from now we will use they'll fossil fuel that that is created to free ourselves

248
00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:45.310
from the Saudi Arabia.

249
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:52.360
I am so sick of sea world leaders go to the UN and like we have a friend

250
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.610
<v 0>of some sort of a friendship.
Um,</v>

251
00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.290
I don't know if there's something you could do,
but anyways,
I'll get,

252
00:14:59.291 --> 00:15:04.000
became fascinated with that expression I was saying right.
Potter's grave.

253
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.720
So I looked it up and of course,
you know,
my research on the Internet,

254
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:12.220
on the Internet never goes past Wikipedia.
Never goes past it,
you know?

255
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.780
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

256
00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.411
<v 0>Uh,
all right.</v>

257
00:15:14.411 --> 00:15:19.411
A Potter's Field Comma poppers field or a common grave is a term for a place for

258
00:15:20.801 --> 00:15:22.720
the burial of unknown or

259
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.980
<v 2>indigent people or was that indigent?</v>

260
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.100
<v 0>All right,
so I clicked on indigent or indeed I don't,</v>

261
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:36.180
isn't it astounding how fucking dumb I y'all ain't astounding about how stupid I

262
00:15:36.181 --> 00:15:38.400
am.
It's the fact that you guys fucking listen to this.

263
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.420
I actually thought it was halfway smart until I started reading out loud.
Here.

264
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.240
I N D I,
g e n,
t

265
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.970
<v 2>indigent.
Indigent.</v>

266
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.540
<v 0>You say tomato.
I say indigent.</v>

267
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.940
Indigent.
I'm just going to stop saying it.
I just come this way.

268
00:15:58.941 --> 00:16:02.130
I feel like every time I say it,
I'm like fucking a,
I'm like,
that guy.

269
00:16:02.131 --> 00:16:05.220
I'm playing blackjack on.
Hit me,
hit me,
hit me over.
Over.

270
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.100
Your fucking Iq was just going down.
All right,
so I looked up

271
00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.840
that word that I'm not gonna say anymore.
Oh God.

272
00:16:12.841 --> 00:16:15.930
Is it possible to get embarrassed on a podcast that only you are doing?

273
00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:21.180
You know it's possible.
I'm doing it.
All right.
Palm and I,

274
00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:23.130
and what is it ends up coming up is poverty.

275
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.120
Poverty is a general scarcity dearth or the slate of one button,
but what the F,

276
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.000
how did this come to a,
after the industrial revolution,

277
00:16:33.001 --> 00:16:36.870
mass production in factories made product production goods increasingly less

278
00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:41.871
expensive and more accessible of more important is the modernization of the

279
00:16:42.481 --> 00:16:44.210
agriculture's at fertilize.
It dented.

280
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.100
The poverty reduction is a major goal.
I'll give me a fee.

281
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.741
Is it really?

282
00:16:49.741 --> 00:16:53.490
Is it really a major goal when the fucking CEO takes 80% of the profits?

283
00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.163
<v 2>Huh?</v>

284
00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.990
<v 0>One of the guys who's fucking work in the line,</v>

285
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:03.770
his daughter's already hooking is up in the CEO's office,
blowing them,

286
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:05.723
<v 2>you know,</v>

287
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.070
<v 0>cause she can't go to fucking collar.
Then the circle is complete.
Oh,</v>

288
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.770
that was a little poetry there.
All right.
The u s expression,

289
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:15.470
let me get back to the Potter's field.
The u s expression,

290
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.780
Potter's field derives from the Bible.
Oh.
Gj Age.

291
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:25.010
Referring to a field used for the extraction of Potter's clay.

292
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.450
Such land used for agriculture could be used as a burial site.

293
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:34.360
So after they dug out all the clay,
they just threw people in there.
Well,

294
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.200
there you go.
That's a good use of space.

295
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.870
<v 2>Okay.</v>

296
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.720
<v 0>All right.
The term comes to all,
let's,
let's read some Bible.
Oh my God.
I know.</v>

297
00:17:40.721 --> 00:17:43.240
I've done this.
Read some Bible,
Brits,
sweet from the Bible.

298
00:17:43.241 --> 00:17:47.950
The term comes from Matthew 27 Semi-colon oh colon,

299
00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.070
the three dash seven colon,

300
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:55.130
eight in the new testament of the Bible in which Jewish priest take.

301
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:56.800
<v 2>Okay.</v>

302
00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.800
<v 0>Just 30 pieces of silver returned by a remorseful Judas Colon.</v>

303
00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.170
Oh,
Jesus.
Be some antisemitic shit.
Okay.
And then this one says,
then Judas,

304
00:18:06.171 --> 00:18:09.560
who portrayed him?
I think that's Jay Star.

305
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.750
He betrayed Jay star.
They're seeing that he was condemned,
repented himself,

306
00:18:14.751 --> 00:18:19.751
brought back the 30 pieces of silvers to the chief priests and ancient saying,

307
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:23.900
I have sended betraying innocent blood.
But they said,

308
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.280
what does that to us?
Look out to it.
Yeah,
there you go.

309
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.640
There's the antisemitism right there.
Hey,
what do we give a shit?

310
00:18:31.641 --> 00:18:34.820
Just give us a silver pieces there.
But Judy,

311
00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:37.540
<v 2>okay.</v>

312
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.910
<v 0>At casting down the pieces of silver and the temple,</v>

313
00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:44.290
he departed and went and hanged himself with a halter.

314
00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.970
Halter top.
They had those backset but he hit himself with a,

315
00:18:48.971 --> 00:18:50.680
we'll fucking sports bra.
Uh,

316
00:18:50.681 --> 00:18:54.700
but the chief priests having taking the pieces of silver said it's not lawful to

317
00:18:54.701 --> 00:18:56.870
put them into the core.
Boehner.

318
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.040
Did Chrysler used to make those?

319
00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:05.500
The Chrysler Carbone orientee later.
The term might box.

320
00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.920
What?
Duff Mike Box.
Isn't that a bug?

321
00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:14.820
Also arms box or poor box refers to a box that is used to save coin or a piggy

322
00:19:14.891 --> 00:19:19.390
bank.
That's what you should say to save coins for charitable purposes or for

323
00:19:19.391 --> 00:19:23.320
charitable purposes.
Oh,
so then,
okay,
I get it.
So then they can say,
wait a minute,

324
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.490
this guy killed the king of the Jews and was sitting here with the fucking loot

325
00:19:27.491 --> 00:19:28.324
from the caper.

326
00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:33.370
We'll go stick it in the fucking donation box and nobody says a word.

327
00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:38.320
You got me.
All right.
And then they,
after that they had consulted to get,

328
00:19:38.321 --> 00:19:40.240
you know what?
This might be a new section.
You want me to guys,

329
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.530
I'll start reading the fucking Bible and I'll give you my interpretation of it.

330
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.380
Gradually I'll start my own church,
right?

331
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:53.050
And I'll say that I have a direct link to he that is the one if,

332
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.370
and then gradually I'll slide my direct length over and to just saying,
hey,

333
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.950
maybe I'm that guy,
I am that guy,
I am him a blow me.

334
00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.160
I'm fucking all the women here.
Add A,

335
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.600
you guys get out in the field and grow some more apples.

336
00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.310
It's basically fast forwarding through running a cult.
All does the FBI here,

337
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.870
everybody drank this

338
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.790
all over the lips and over the gums.
Suck it down.
Here they come.
All right.

339
00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:23.880
Don't say refer to these verses known as pup up above.

340
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.620
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

341
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.820
<v 0>that's really interesting and fucking said there's something sad about that,</v>

342
00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:30.654
right?

343
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.430
Has anybody ever had like a fucking marquis on their head site?

344
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.550
You know like a big grave stone and then just have like,

345
00:20:38.551 --> 00:20:42.990
you don't like the Chicago theater but like to scale to a headstone

346
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.150
performing here for eternity

347
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:52.530
<v 2>or some hacky fucking form of show business.
Ah,
Christ.</v>

348
00:20:52.531 --> 00:20:56.910
Now I gotta look this shit up.
Now I've got to look this shit up.
Okay.

349
00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:01.400
<v 0>Those people who have wacky headstone saying,
here we go.</v>

350
00:21:01.401 --> 00:21:03.290
Funny headstones.

351
00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:04.810
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

352
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.450
<v 0>All right,
here we go.
What do we got here?
What do we got here?</v>

353
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.180
Images for funny headstones.
Now what are the odds?

354
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.800
Any of these are going to be funny.
All right,

355
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.410
Charlie.
All these are just funny named Charlie loser,

356
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:21.430
born in ATD e seven and John Loser.

357
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:28.170
Jesus Christ is such losers.
They're buried in the same fucking place.
Jokes over.

358
00:21:28.171 --> 00:21:29.520
Let me out now.

359
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:37.790
Oh,
Leslie Nielsen,
he's got a joke on his,
what does it say?
Let her rip.

360
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:45.170
I don't know what the fuck that means.
Oh,

361
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.770
Tipman boogers.

Who put this up here?
Fucking beat for some Buffett,

Say Eggs.
Headstones.
Here we go.
Oh my God.

365
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:07.010
This is a riot.
Oh.
Epitaphs.
Here we go.
52,
the funniest Abta.

366
00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.400
All right.
Somebody has.dot,
dot.
Well,
this sucks.

367
00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.790
That's not bad.
Billy Wilder.
I'm a writer,

368
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:18.700
but then nobody's perfect.
Oh,
Jesus.

369
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.670
Oh,
Jesus.
It's such an NPR joke.

370
00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.780
Uh,
Jack Lemmon in.

371
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.210
<v 2>Okay.</v>

372
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:30.320
<v 0>Oh,
it's like a movie headstone.</v>

373
00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.890
Jack Lemmon was one hell of an actor and a funny one to boot.
Here's his here.

374
00:22:33.891 --> 00:22:37.580
He stars in his final role.
Well in the ground.
Ah,
that's a good one.

375
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:41.690
Uh,
this one gets to the point.
Well,
this sucks.

376
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:43.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

377
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.710
<v 0>It was another one.
All right.
This one.
This ain't bad.</v>

378
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.260
Once you get used to it,
that's not bad.

379
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.110
I was supposed to live to be 102,
it'd be shot by a jealous husband.

380
00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.050
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

381
00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.690
<v 0>near this spot.
You know something.
Actually,
if they were all interesting,</v>

382
00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:04.070
I think people would go to fucking graveyards more rather than,

383
00:23:04.071 --> 00:23:08.860
than getting creeped out by it.
Uh,
near this spot.
Samuel Whitmore,

384
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:13.000
then 80 years old killed three British soldiers.
He was shot.

385
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.201
He was shot.

386
00:23:14.201 --> 00:23:18.610
Bayoneted beaten and left for dead but recovered and live to be 90 years of age.

387
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.680
This guys talking shit.
Here.
I lie,
but don't you cry for one day two,

388
00:23:23.681 --> 00:23:26.020

Ah,

I can't.

389
00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

390
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.950
<v 0>Leslie Nielsen,
let her rip Merv Griffin.</v>

391
00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.980
I will not be right back after this message as a winner right there.

392
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:41.690
I liked that somebody wrote,
Ha,
get it.
Such a comedian.

393
00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.750
You can't make anybody happy on the Internet.
All right,
Bill Kugel.

394
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:48.880
He voted for Republicans and it had little to do with them.
Yes,

395
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.610
that was bad.
Here's one.
Said,
I told you I was sick.
That's,

396
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.633
that's funny.

397
00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:57.710
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

398
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.240
<v 0>no,
the one I knew this would happen.</v>

399
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:04.550
Somebody has a pretty good Rodney Dangerfield.
There goes the neighborhood

400
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:11.220
here lies something,
something.
Hang by mistake in 1882 he was right,

401
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.690
we was wrong,
but we stand him up and now he's gone.

402
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.000
Oh Dude,
you can't go with poetry.

403
00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:21.180
<v 2>Okay,</v>

404
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.770
<v 0>I guess that's it.
Well,
there you go guys.</v>

405
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.170
That's about as good as it gets and you know,
you know you could do better.

406
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.000
<v 2>Okay.</v>

407
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.680
<v 0>Once you just say,
what the fuck are you looking at it?
I don't know.
Let's,</v>

408
00:24:32.681 --> 00:24:35.170
let's read the advertising.
Shall We?
Lot of death.
A lot of debt this week.

409
00:24:35.171 --> 00:24:39.630
A lot of death on the podcast.
All right.
Oh,

410
00:24:39.631 --> 00:24:43.630
here we go.
The readings for this week club.
Debbie Club,
Daddy,

411
00:24:43.631 --> 00:24:47.080
my daddy went to Yale.
Uh,
we've been,
we've all been there.

412
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.590
You come home after a long exhausting,
exhausting day,
right?

413
00:24:50.591 --> 00:24:54.040
You want to get shit faced and all you want us to sip.
You want to sit,

414
00:24:54.041 --> 00:24:57.370
you want to sip a glass of wine and relax so you can lie to yourself to get on

415
00:24:57.371 --> 00:25:00.460
an alcoholic because you're drinking wine.
But unless you plan it ahead,

416
00:25:00.461 --> 00:25:02.590
you probably don't have a bottle in your house.

417
00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.210
You've already spent enough time wandering around the grocery store.
You know,

418
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.100
don't get lost in the wine aisle.

419
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.250
You'd just end up picking out a bottle based on the label.

420
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.050
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

421
00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.450
<v 0>you don't really understand it.
You get home,

I'm 25.
What am I going to do?

513
00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.840
Was the volume this far down?
Did I accidentally kicked the volume as shit?

514
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.140
Christ.
Um,
don't worry.

515
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:55.170
I'm still working on the garage
and uh,

516
00:30:55.171 --> 00:30:58.300
I'll,
I'm going to,
I'm going to figure out how to make this fucking work.
Okay.

517
00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:59.530
It's becoming,
once again,

518
00:30:59.531 --> 00:31:02.600
everything in this house is a motherfucker and when I've,

519
00:31:02.601 --> 00:31:05.620
I've finally learned to do is I'm not fighting the house so I'm not fighting

520
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.620
house anymore.
I will adapt to it.
All right?

521
00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:13.690
If everything has to be some sort of a geometric shape that doesn't exist yet,

522
00:31:13.691 --> 00:31:15.650
that has no definition that God dammit,

523
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.430
that will be the shape of the fucking room.
All right.

524
00:31:18.431 --> 00:31:21.940
Is there anything else I wanted to talk about?
Um,
oh man,

525
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:26.710
this lady fucking cut me off when I was driving and just the fucking thoughts I

526
00:31:26.711 --> 00:31:29.680
had and everyone that you have,
they're like,
I can't do that and go to jail.

527
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.620
I can't do that.
I put her eye out,
you know,

528
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.280
I was thinking about pulling up next to if I had a paint gun and her sticking

529
00:31:36.281 --> 00:31:38.670
the wind or face out the winter to give me the finger like,

530
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:42.370
like they all do and just fucking blasting in right in the face.

531
00:31:42.371 --> 00:31:44.170
And I immediately,
I was thinking about her eyes.

532
00:31:44.171 --> 00:31:46.650
So that's where the paint ball went and put a rye out.

533
00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.520
I got done and no back the fantasy up.
Okay.

534
00:31:48.521 --> 00:31:50.590
Take it down a notch right in the middle of her forehead.

535
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:55.690
Hit her right in the forehead and watched the botox shootout on either side now.

536
00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:56.171
But then,
you know,

537
00:31:56.171 --> 00:31:59.020
people behind me would take down my plate and I just was sitting at the red

538
00:31:59.021 --> 00:32:03.730
light behind her.
All of these fantasies of the Shit I wanted to do,

539
00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:04.421
follow her,

540
00:32:04.421 --> 00:32:09.280
find out where she fucking works slash all of her tires and then take the knife,

541
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.870
stick it right into the head,
rest of her driver's side seat,
you know,

542
00:32:13.871 --> 00:32:16.660
with something fucking written in newspaper writing.
So you know,

543
00:32:16.661 --> 00:32:18.550
when you take the fucking letters from the newspaper,

544
00:32:18.551 --> 00:32:21.510
so it looks totally even more creepy.
And I was like,
well why would you do that?

545
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.590
There's going to be cameras in the parking lot.
You can't do that.

546
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:27.040
And then the light turned green and she made a right.

547
00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.790
And I kept going straight and I just never thought about her again until right

548
00:32:30.791 --> 00:32:34.810
now.
And with that,

549
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.550
that is is the a,
you guys have any yummy here.
Some,
uh,

550
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:41.130
once you write in the murderer,

551
00:32:41.131 --> 00:32:44.580
his fantasies that you have when somebody cuts you off and fucking traffic,

552
00:32:44.581 --> 00:32:49.520
all this shit that you think about doing but you don't do because that's the

553
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:52.340
difference between you and a psycho.
All you do is think it,

554
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.940
but you don't fucking,
you don't carry it out.
You know,

555
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:59.540
I at least I hope you do are also probably just got put on some sort of watch

556
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:02.630
list.
You know?
No one gives a fuck.

557
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.890
I'd love to be put on a watch list and I would love to be watching them.

558
00:33:06.891 --> 00:33:10.430
Watch me and see how long they could watch me before they fucking nodded off.

559
00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:15.350
See watching another hockey game.
Oh my God,
this is the worst assignment ever.

560
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:20.290
Jesus Christ.
Um,

by the way,

564
00:33:31.101 --> 00:33:35.660
I finally watched the Carolina's Seattle game and um,

565
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.630
this is what I have to say.
You know,
I,

566
00:33:37.631 --> 00:33:41.000
I find it amazing that the Carolina Panthers,

567
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:45.620
when they had two weeks before that game even came,
right,
they had a week off,

568
00:33:45.621 --> 00:33:50.621
so they had two weeks and millions of dollars at their disposal to get that

569
00:33:51.141 --> 00:33:51.974
field.

570
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:53.240
<v 2>Okay.</v>

571
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.890
<v 0>Until a better like into much better shape for that great Seattle defense.</v>

572
00:33:57.891 --> 00:34:02.240
It's amazing how they just for some reason couldn't get that together.

573
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:04.730
Now it's not illegal.

574
00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:08.600
All you really have to do is just have a feel and paint some lines and put some

575
00:34:08.601 --> 00:34:13.070
numbers on it.
You're not required to have it and the greatest of shape,

576
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.890
but that was just one of those things is a patriots fan.

577
00:34:15.891 --> 00:34:17.630
You just look at it and go,
isn't that funny?

578
00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:21.650
I wonder what would happen if we were to do something like that even though it's

579
00:34:21.651 --> 00:34:24.980
not illegal.
That'd be a nice fucking five days.

580
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.810
All the patriots up to it again.
Um,
anyway,

581
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:34.070
so we're going into a Denver,
we're going into Denver.
It should be a,

582
00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:35.900
a tough game.
And um,

583
00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:37.870
<v 2>okay.</v>

584
00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:42.560
<v 0>I have a melancholy feeling about this.
Like,
this might be the last,
uh,</v>

585
00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:45.530
Brady Peyton manning match up.
You know,

586
00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:51.040
and if Peyton Manning's retires after this year,
and then there's just one,
right,

587
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:55.310
Tom,
terrific.
And then some day he'll be gone.

588
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.760
He'll be retired and it's just,

589
00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:01.070
it's going to be like Jesus fucking Christ.

590
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.150
I remember when they came in the fight and when those guys came in the league,

591
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.890
I was already in my thirties,
wasn't I?
When a patient come in 96,

592
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:13.580
I turned 30 and 98 so 30.
Yeah.
29 30 years old.

593
00:35:13.581 --> 00:35:16.450
Unfucking believable and they're considered old.

594
00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:18.630
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

595
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.180
<v 0>I'll be my fifties when Tom Brady,</v>

596
00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:23.310
when tires God willing God fucking well and guidewell and he plays that long and

597
00:35:23.311 --> 00:35:24.144
God willing,

598
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.390
I fucking make it that I would make it into my fifties and don't end up in a

599
00:35:27.391 --> 00:35:30.630
fucking potter's grave.
You know,
I wouldn't give a shit.

600
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.110
<v 2>Okay.</v>

601
00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:36.550
<v 0>I think that's the most arrogant fucking thing you could possibly do is,
um,</v>

602
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:38.230
let's give

603
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:41.560
<v 1>a fuck how you're dead bodies presented for the rest of fucking time.</v>

604
00:35:41.561 --> 00:35:46.150
That's just the fucking,
it's just like,
dude,
just Frisbee Frisbee my body.

605
00:35:46.151 --> 00:35:50.080
Off the back of a pickup truck down a cliff.
I don't give a shit.
Um,

606
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:53.980
oh by the way,
with the,
that just remind me of something.

607
00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:57.970
The fuck was I going to say?
Ah,
Christ,
it left me.

608
00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.010
It left me like all thoughts do.
Um,
all right,
so that's the podcast.

609
00:36:03.011 --> 00:36:06.700
Have a great weekend.
Your counts.
Um,
she'll be a great game out in Denver.

610
00:36:06.701 --> 00:36:09.190
I love their defense.
Um,
of course.

611
00:36:09.191 --> 00:36:12.120
I don't think it's going to be an easy game and uh,

612
00:36:12.121 --> 00:36:16.240
I am surprised that we have favorites because we have historically not done well

613
00:36:16.241 --> 00:36:19.060
out in Denver and it always fucking smells.
All right.

614
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:23.370
I'll talk to you a to comes on Monday.

615
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.760
Oh No.
Why

616
00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.370
Shit about the fucking guy things

617
00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.350
<v 0>got that.
You know,
he went over to,
he went over to Uganda,</v>

618
00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:05.390
that Guy Kony Kony 2012.
You see that?

619
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:07.550
You see how quickly they brought that guy down.

620
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:13.130
This guy shines a light on the,
uh,
on himself first and foremost,

621
00:37:13.131 --> 00:37:17.780
and how he and his child or dealing with it,
which was really bizarre.

622
00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.430
I mean,
I don't know about you guys,

623
00:37:19.431 --> 00:37:24.140
but it was enough for me to see the boy soldier crying cause he saw his brother

624
00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:29.580
have his next sliced right in front of them,
you know,

625
00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.160
and he goes from that to be a,

626
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:35.900
now I'm going to sit my son down and tell him about the,
it's like a,

627
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.180
I didn't even get it.
All right.

628
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:41.361
So anyways,

629
00:37:41.361 --> 00:37:44.450
this guy shines a light on this bullshit that's going on over there and all of a

630
00:37:44.451 --> 00:37:46.190
sudden everybody's in an uproar over sin.

631
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:50.840
Everybody gives a fuck about Uganda and these boys soldiers,
you know,

632
00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:53.600
and all of a sudden the United States government is gonna do it.

633
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:56.090
We're fighting two wars.
We can't even afford to fight one.

634
00:37:56.091 --> 00:37:58.580
Now this guy's bringing this shit up.
Gee,

635
00:37:58.581 --> 00:38:02.810
wouldn't it be nice if something fucking happened that would discredit him?

636
00:38:02.811 --> 00:38:05.630
Next thing you know,
a couple of days later,
hey,

637
00:38:05.631 --> 00:38:10.340
this guy connected with the film from Dec Kony 2012 gets caught jerking off in

638
00:38:10.341 --> 00:38:11.174
public.

639
00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:15.770
Was that the only guy who found that unbelievably fucking convenient?

640
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:20.510
I didn't buy it for a second.
In fact,
I tweeted,
you know,
back in the day,

641
00:38:20.511 --> 00:38:23.990
they used to assassinate you.
Now they just do this.
You know what I mean?

642
00:38:23.991 --> 00:38:27.290
If they could make it look like we landed on the moon in 1969,

643
00:38:27.291 --> 00:38:30.830
you don't think that they can make you anybody they want make it look like

644
00:38:30.831 --> 00:38:35.090
you're rubbing one out in the fucking parking lot.
I don't buy it.
Okay.

645
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:39.420
What that fucking Douche bag was doing,
not douche bag.
That fucking self-serving.

646
00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.640
Cont there we go.
That's what I was trying to say.

647
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:45.870
What he was doing with that film was he was putting pressure on the United

648
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:48.870
States to go over there and fucking somehow insert themselves into that

649
00:38:48.871 --> 00:38:51.660
situation,
which would it cost a ton of fucking money,

650
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.373
<v 2>you know?</v>

651
00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.770
<v 0>But there's no way to be like,
hey,
fuck those boys soldiers,</v>

652
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.390
you know,
because of the,
of,
uh,
the way the coupe,

653
00:39:02.391 --> 00:39:06.960
because of what it says in our pamphlet,
you know,
give a shit or your week,

654
00:39:06.961 --> 00:39:11.100
give us your poor and will exploit the shit out of them and uh,

655
00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:16.050
let them die of tuberculosis in a damp apartment.
And then years later,

656
00:39:16.051 --> 00:39:18.570
whoever made the most amount of money gets a statue made out of them.

657
00:39:18.571 --> 00:39:19.590
That's all in our thing.

658
00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:22.910
So we can't look the other way with these fucking boy soldiers.

659
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.660
So what's easiest thing to do?
Just just make that guy look like a freak show.

660
00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:32.040
First of all,
who hasn't jerked off in a parking lot?
Honestly?

661
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:36.690
You know who hasn't done that?
You know your rent,

662
00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:41.580
you fucking girl goes in to change something.
You sitting there,
you're bored.

663
00:39:41.581 --> 00:39:44.670
You can't get any radio reception cause you know it's back in the day.

664
00:39:44.671 --> 00:39:46.980
He just say,
ah,
I'm bored.
Right?

665
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:50.030
He got a girl in your life.

666
00:39:50.031 --> 00:39:52.160
So you know there's gonna be some sort of Napkins in the car.

667
00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.570
What are you going to dope?
Right?
You've got the captain's chairs.

668
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.510
No one could see ya.

669
00:39:58.990 --> 00:39:59.290
<v 2>Okay.</v>

670
00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:04.110
<v 0>As is taking forever.
Hey,
what am I rub one out.
All right.
Yeah,
that,
that Dah Dah,</v>

671
00:40:04.111 --> 00:40:07.870
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
But now everybody's got a fucking camera.
You know?

672
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.630
You know what's amazing is that everybody hasn't got caught jerking off in

673
00:40:10.631 --> 00:40:13.600
public at this point.
Everybody's got a camera in there raw.
This cell phone,

674
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:18.130
when I'm trying to say people is I don't buy it and it doesn't matter.

675
00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:23.160
I don't give a fuck whether the guy from Coney was jerking off in a parking lot

676
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:27.730
or not.
That doesn't change whether or not this boy soldiers in Uganda,

677
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:29.420
but what's great is,

678
00:40:29.421 --> 00:40:34.421
is then the conversation switches from what's going on over there to lull let's

679
00:40:35.321 --> 00:40:39.310
this Guy Dylan,
he,
he rubbing his deck like we all do

680
00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:45.220
and then everybody would be like,
yeah,
but we don't do it in public.
Oh,
so what?

681
00:40:45.221 --> 00:40:48.040
That makes you better.
It doesn't make you better.

682
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:52.840
It just makes you more considerate,
doesn't it?
I mean,

683
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:56.320
if he had two people and they were both shooting heroin and one person had the

684
00:40:56.321 --> 00:41:01.060
decency to do it in their house and the other person does it out in public,

685
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.670
at the end of the day,
you both drug addicts,

686
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.270
so if you're really going to sit there and shit on this guy for jerking off,

687
00:41:07.271 --> 00:41:11.320
then you would have to basically be not jerking off at all.

688
00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:13.453
<v 2>Right.</v>

689
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:20.450
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I'm asking you to look into your hearts.</v>

690
00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.260
If you have not rubbed one out,

691
00:41:23.261 --> 00:41:27.370
let he who is not rubbed on out in some sort of pump.

692
00:41:27.371 --> 00:41:31.870
Now you'd have a jerked off at work.
God,
I'm fucking bored.
Excuse me,

693
00:41:31.871 --> 00:41:36.080
let me go to the bathroom.
Maybe they think I'm taking a shit standing up,

694
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.330
right?
Come on.

695
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.470
If you're a guy in your arms along enough,

696
00:41:45.471 --> 00:41:48.980
at some point you've jerked off in someplace where you shouldn't have.

697
00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.720
You jerked off to somebody you shouldn't have.
You've done it.

698
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.930
We've all been there.
Who gives a fuck?

699
00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:01.460
There's still boys fighting and wars over this.
So you know,

700
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:04.640
if you want to help out,
help out.
If you don't,
don't,

701
00:42:04.641 --> 00:42:07.160
but don't let some guy rubber one out in a parking lot.

702
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.990
Change your mind either way.

703
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.820
You know what they're doing right now that doing what women do when they argue

704
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:19.430
when they start to lose is they bring up other shit and they spin it into a

705
00:42:19.431 --> 00:42:22.340
different room and next thing you know,

706
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:26.870
you're arguing a whole different argument and argument that they wanted you to

707
00:42:26.871 --> 00:42:27.590
fucking argue.

708
00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:30.950
So they knew that they could win rather than keeping the argument on fucking

709
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:33.200
track of saying,
listen sweetheart,

710
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:37.370
I don't like the way you fucking been dressing lately.
Okay?

711
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:41.420
I've gotten this relationship to treat you like a piece of fucking meat.

712
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.750
All right?
And lately you've been slacking off.

713
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:50.060
People were still boy soldiers in Uganda.
Whether or not that guys,

714
00:42:50.061 --> 00:42:54.860
Robin one out are open in his ass for the world to see.
Don't ever forget that.

715
00:42:54.861 --> 00:42:58.550
Don't lose sight of what the real story is.

716
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.983
Okay?

717
00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:04.210
That is all good night and God [inaudible]

718
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.430
<v 1>less space.</v>

719
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:23.050
[inaudible]

720
00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:42.250
all right.
Fried

721
00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:43.210
<v 0>chicken advice.
Hey Bill,</v>

722
00:43:43.211 --> 00:43:47.020
I'm 25 and I've been listening to your podcast for a year now and I really enjoy

723
00:43:47.021 --> 00:43:50.170
it.
I wanted to get your advice on my current situation.

724
00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.880
I could have assumed all of that.
Um,
because I'm arrogant.

725
00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:59.020
Then why else would you write in?
Okay.
After a lot of failed relationships,

726
00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.170
I wanted to try a new approach of meeting women.

727
00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:06.220
I'm at a 21 year old girl through my sister in law and figured she was

728
00:44:06.221 --> 00:44:10.450
interesting and pretty enough to consider for a serious girlfriend.

729
00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:15.400
We started hanging out as friends so I could be sure that I was in fact able to

730
00:44:15.401 --> 00:44:18.730
be friends with her before I made a move to something more seriously.

731
00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.020
More serious,
sorry.

732
00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:23.510
Things have been going well for the last two months and we get together a couple

733
00:44:23.511 --> 00:44:25.990
of times a week to hang out and do stuff.
Wow.

734
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:30.940
[inaudible] last week I finally decided that I wanted to make my move on her.

735
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.570
I was saying goodbye to her up to hanging out,

736
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:37.200
and I finally moved in for a kiss and she backed away.

737
00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:42.230
It got really awkward after that and she kind of said,
oh,

738
00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.500
I have to go.
About 10 minutes later,

739
00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:49.890
I got a text from her saying,
sorry for backing away,

740
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.790
but I don't want to ruin our friendship.
Ah,

741
00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:55.810
<v 2>okay.</v>

742
00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.910
<v 0>Oh Dude.
You fucking waited too long.</v>

743
00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.860
I would go with go watch that Chris Rock special where he see does the friend

744
00:45:02.861 --> 00:45:06.250
zone.
Um,
anyways,
he says,
what the hell do I do now?

745
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.810
She has always been very flirty with me the entire time we've been hanging out.

746
00:45:10.811 --> 00:45:13.330
Oh wait.
She's been flirted with you though.
Fuck her.

747
00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:17.770
She works at an all girls camp during the summer and she always hangs out with

748
00:45:17.771 --> 00:45:22.540
me on her days off.
So I know there isn't anyone else she's seeing.
All right.

749
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.620
First of all,
scratch that.
All right.
You have no idea.
What,
what,

750
00:45:26.621 --> 00:45:29.600
how does that expression go?
You know,

751
00:45:29.601 --> 00:45:32.930
only the devil knows the secrets in a woman's heart.
Isn't that how it goes?

752
00:45:32.931 --> 00:45:35.750
Something like that.
Did it?
Don't ever fucking you.
You have no fuck.

753
00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:36.800
I don't give a fuck.

754
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:38.080
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

755
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.120
<v 0>Okay.
You could have a woman in a Goddamn cell.</v>

756
00:45:40.121 --> 00:45:43.840
You still have no idea what the fuck they're doing.
Um,

757
00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:45.450
the sorceress um,

758
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.863
anyways,

759
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:54.160
am I to believe she is so naive to think that we were just hanging out as total

760
00:45:54.161 --> 00:45:55.270
platonic friends.

761
00:45:55.480 --> 00:46:00.280
The only reason I could think why she would do that is because I am agnostic and

762
00:46:00.281 --> 00:46:03.460
she is a semi religious girl.
What do you think I should do?

763
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:08.630
You know what you should do fucking walk Robert Deniro and heat.

764
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:14.020
Just walk away.
All right.
Just walk away.

765
00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.050
This is what you do.
All right.

766
00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:20.230
This girl's being all flirty with you and all that type of shit.

767
00:46:20.231 --> 00:46:22.330
She gets you dick hard.
You're trying to be a gentleman.

768
00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:25.360
You don't try to fucking finger blast or on the first date because you think

769
00:46:25.361 --> 00:46:29.740
she's special.
All right,
so three days after flying kites and going on picnics,

770
00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.510
you go in for a kiss.
She pulls up.
Ah,
eh.
They didn't want to ruin the friendship.

771
00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.970
Give me a fucking break.
She knows what the fuck she's doing.
All right.

772
00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.690
She's toy in with you since this is what you do.

773
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.150
This is the best thing that you can do.

774
00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.480
When a woman does something like that that makes you want to go out and eat

775
00:46:48.481 --> 00:46:53.250
fucking sheet metal is you don't,
you don't give them the emotion that they want,

776
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:57.260
which is she.
They want you to be upset.
And uh,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

777
00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:01.410
I don't why I have no,
I don't know fucking why,
but she wants you to be upset.

778
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.680
So this is what you do.
Okay.
You just say,
Oh yeah,
hey,

779
00:47:04.681 --> 00:47:08.220
I didn't know what I was doing.
That's cool.
That's cool.
Whatever.
All right.

780
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:12.810
And then she had very few,
any friends,
it'd be like,
yeah,
absolutely.

781
00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:14.940
We can totally be friends.

782
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:16.350
<v 2>Okay.</v>

783
00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:19.900
<v 0>All right.
So I don't try to fucking bang or anymore,
don't blow her off.</v>

784
00:47:19.901 --> 00:47:23.020
So she has no idea what you're doing.
Just keep hanging out with their whatever,

785
00:47:23.021 --> 00:47:25.810
doing this and that.
And then what you do just start fucking working out.

786
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:27.790
You get jacked,
right?

787
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:32.110
And then on the side you talking to other broads and then one day you show up

788
00:47:32.111 --> 00:47:36.190
with a fucking Goddamn Hickey on the side of your neck,
you know,

789
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.430
and then you fucking just don't even address it.
What's said,
hey,

790
00:47:39.431 --> 00:47:41.120
you know what I'm saying?
And it was some girl last night.

791
00:47:41.121 --> 00:47:44.950
So what are you doing today?
And you just,
you just,
you mind fucker right back.

792
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:50.210
You fight fire with fire.
That's what you do get on with your life,
sir.

793
00:47:50.211 --> 00:47:53.770
Fuck her.
That's it.
All right.
That's it.

794
00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:57.310
That's,
that's what I feel

795
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.180
my solution is always the same.
Okay.

796
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:07.600
Is when whenever a girl does some shit like that.
All right.

797
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:12.010
Or if a girl breaks up with you or anything like that and,
and uh,

798
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.910
if a girl still wants to be friends with you after she broke up with you,
don't,

799
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.320
all right.
You get the fuck away from her hurt locker.
Okay.

800
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:23.110
Put on your bomb suit and fucking walk away.
Don't be,

801
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:27.880
don't be the hero you fucking walk away because they just want to keep you in

802
00:48:27.881 --> 00:48:31.840
their life as they slowly get over you and just constantly be taking a steak

803
00:48:31.841 --> 00:48:35.890
knife and shoving it into your heart.
Fuck that.
All right.
You get away from him.

804
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.090
This,
there's no point being around this girl.

805
00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.070
So right now this girl just tried to mind fuck you.

806
00:48:43.071 --> 00:48:47.210
So if you automatically just cut off being around her,

807
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:50.510
she's going to win on some level and she'll actually get some sort of level of

808
00:48:50.511 --> 00:48:53.210
satisfaction that you reacted that way.
Cause.

809
00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:55.700
Because even though you think you're saying,
fuck you,

810
00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:58.910
what you're really saying is I actually cared about you and that's going to feed

811
00:48:58.911 --> 00:49:01.610
her God.
Damn Ego said don't do that.
So just be like,
yeah,

812
00:49:01.611 --> 00:49:05.890
I don't know what I was thinking.
You know?
Uh,
yeah,
you can't.
Yeah,
you can't.

813
00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:09.320
You can't blame a guy for triad that'll annoy her.

814
00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.450
Like she's just some piece of meat you took a swing at.

815
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:19.010
This is such terrible fucking advice,
but you know what?
I believe in it.

816
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:24.260
This is how I've lived my life.
If you want to end up like me,
43 not married,

817
00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:25.610
no kids,
that's how you do it.

818
00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:32.020
I Dunno.
Yeah.
Just whatever she wants to hang on.
Hey,

819
00:49:32.021 --> 00:49:34.330
let's hang out and don't be weird around her.

820
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:35.550
<v 2>Okay?</v>

821
00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:39.000
<v 0>Don't be with,
hey,
sorry about that.
I Dunno,
I was an idiot or whatever.</v>

822
00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:42.270
Now that's what you do.
That's what you do.
All right.

823
00:49:42.271 --> 00:49:45.750
And then what you do is start talking about some other girl.

824
00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:49.020
Wait a couple of weeks and just say,
hey,
you know,
I kind of met this girl.

825
00:49:49.021 --> 00:49:52.320
I kind of liked her and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
You know,
this is,

826
00:49:52.321 --> 00:49:56.040
this is a fucking,
this is the old hook and lateral play.

827
00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:58.410
I don't know if this'll work.
This is definitely a hail Mary.

828
00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:00.510
But maybe if you fucking start saying,
hey,

829
00:50:00.511 --> 00:50:02.910
and I met this girl and I kind of fucking like,

830
00:50:02.911 --> 00:50:05.850
are you show up at the Hickey on her neck?
I don't know what happens.

831
00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.480
There's spinal cord muscles,
the spinal cord muscles,

832
00:50:09.481 --> 00:50:12.300
the muscles around the spinal cord get fucking eye.
They get weak.

833
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:13.280
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

834
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.830
<v 0>And I,
and all of a sudden they just fall face first of the elap.</v>

835
00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:19.820
Sometimes that happens,
you know,
but you're not going to know unless you try it.

836
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:24.410
All right?
Don't be Chris Webber and be looking to pass the fucking ball here.

837
00:50:24.411 --> 00:50:27.650
If you want to take the shot,
you understand me?
So what you do,

838
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:31.280
<v 4>sometimes I say this shit and I,</v>

839
00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:34.010
and I've stepped outside of myself and I just realized what a fucking moron I

840
00:50:34.011 --> 00:50:36.200
sound like.
But I don't know if some reason you guys listen to this shit,

841
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:38.930
so whatever.
Good luck to you.
I just tapped.

842
00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.890
<v 1>Oh,
those time.</v>

843
00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.150
Yay.

844
00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.830
You

845
00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.320
can do some little differences this week

846
00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.220
<v 4>rather than me just sitting here in my pajamas ranting,</v>

847
00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.630
ranting and raving.

848
00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:26.790
I decided that I would get closed this week and have a friend of mine come by.

849
00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:31.020
Um,
the one and only dom,
I rera everybody.
Thank you.
Everybody at,

850
00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:34.090
do you mind if I get undressed?
Huh?
No,
I would feel more comfortable.

851
00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:38.830
I like in the nude and food in the nude,

852
00:51:38.831 --> 00:51:40.470
not in the nude.

853
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:47.020
I realize now,
you know,
look,
look how much weight I've gained right now.
You know,

854
00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:51.670
I've gained since I've known you 30 pounds.
Right.
And I know that.

855
00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:54.990
I can't tell.
Well,
you don't really look,
you don't really check me out.

856
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.240
What it is all done at my head.
My head is bigger.
What you wearing?

857
00:51:58.241 --> 00:52:02.650
That slimming black tee shirt?
I've got to Barry bonds head,

858
00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:08.950
but it's,
it's interesting because now I don't even know if this is a bit yet,

859
00:52:08.951 --> 00:52:11.620
Bill,
but I think there's something in it.
I have to look.

860
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:15.010
I don't like women my own age.
Right.
And I mean,
I can't,

861
00:52:15.011 --> 00:52:19.210
I can't fake that I get aroused by them.
I always wondered that.
No,

862
00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:22.330
I always wanted to glean.
I wish I had that kind of love or something,

863
00:52:22.331 --> 00:52:23.980
but I need like a hot young chick,

864
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:28.080
but the only hot young chick I'm going to get has to be flawed.
Right.

865
00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:30.880
Does she gotta be as daddy issue inside or outside?
Yeah.

866
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:34.510
Just gotta be messed up in some way.
But that's what I'm looking for.
How many,
uh,

867
00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:38.980
how many strippers have you,
have you dated,
dated?
Uh,

868
00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:43.060
only a couple.
I was in love with one.
How old?
How old were you when you did,

869
00:52:43.061 --> 00:52:45.760
when you made that move?
Uh,
two years ago.

870
00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.120
He fell in love with the stress level was just,
first of all,

871
00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:53.670
it's just a country song.
She was,
um,

872
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:56.020
she was not stripping at the time.

873
00:52:56.021 --> 00:52:58.840
She was bartending and just given the occasional lap dance

874
00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:04.020
and really beautiful girl.
I've been to that bar.
I had fun,
but I'll tell you,

875
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:07.770
oxycontin and alcohol really mess you up.
I don't know if you knew that.
Yeah,

876
00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:11.500
I got some.
Uh,
but I still loved the girl,
but she's a,
I don't think,

877
00:53:11.501 --> 00:53:13.490
I don't think we're getting back together cause that oxy,

878
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:18.010
her husband and her two kids keep blocking us.
Oh Jesus.
Dom,

879
00:53:18.011 --> 00:53:20.830
you're making me feel good.
Make me feel good.

880
00:53:20.831 --> 00:53:23.810
Some of the choices I made back in the day,
dude,
oxy is uh,

881
00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:25.980
that's a terrible right.
Yeah.
That's one

882
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.590
<v 0>of those things like even when you get off at your,</v>

883
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:32.280
I don't know that you're ever,
uh,
depending on how long you do it,
the same.

884
00:53:32.281 --> 00:53:34.830
I lost a buddy of mine did that.
Oh really?
I got another one.

885
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.930
He's not doing so well.

886
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:41.610
Did you grow up in a neighborhood that was a lot of drugs?
I'm not like that.

887
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:46.380
Not like that.
It was a,
I grew up,
you know,
it was,
it was called the sac bullshit.

888
00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:48.000
It was weed.
There was the weed guy,

889
00:53:48.001 --> 00:53:52.170
there was the bookie and then w and then there was,
you know,
blues obviously,

890
00:53:52.171 --> 00:53:57.030
but you know,
in some coke when you got older,
but uh,

891
00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:00.480
like nobody was doing like heroin and crack was like,

892
00:54:00.481 --> 00:54:02.880
you're out of your fucking mind.
Cause everybody thought if you smoke crack,

893
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:04.450
that was it.
You had done well the,

894
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:07.200
they say you get addicted the first time they said,

895
00:54:07.201 --> 00:54:11.180
but I got friends of mine who did and they're like,
oh really?
Yeah.

896
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:13.790
Maybe they were addicted to other things they didn't have time to be.

897
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:16.950
Maybe they're just better people and better,
stronger.
You have good friends.

898
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:21.000
Let me ask you this.
If you had one drug that you think you would like,

899
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:25.490
what would it be?
I know what mine is.
If you,

900
00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:30.550
if I could do a drug that I've never tried tried and you think that like it's

901
00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:33.300
not going to have any repercussions.
Just want to the feeling.

902
00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:37.800
What feeling would it be?
Not telling you I have a tie.
He's,

903
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:39.900
I want to know.
I want to know what it feels like.

904
00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:44.370
Like that train spotting where you sink into the rug the first time you do

905
00:54:44.371 --> 00:54:47.880
heroin.
That's exactly,
that's exactly what I want that,

906
00:54:47.881 --> 00:54:52.420
but I got to admit the hallucinating thing tripping,
but I'll put that,

907
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:54.780
somebody told me,
like you said,
like when you're tripping,

908
00:54:54.781 --> 00:54:57.690
it's not like you don't know the a trepan you see the door fucking melting.

909
00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:59.550
You're like,
oh,
it's because I'm on acid.

910
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.920
It's not like those high school films where you'd be like,

911
00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:06.890
you thought you could fly and shit like that,
jump out the window.
No,
I,

912
00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:11.850
I uh,
what was that movie with that old guy?
Was it something to me?

913
00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:16.260
Larry Alan Arkin did a part where he played an old guy and he fucking,
uh,

914
00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:19.470
he just,
he got addicted to heroin like his seventies.
He's just like,

915
00:55:19.471 --> 00:55:24.000
what the fuck?
I'm 70.
That's a guy.
I said,
good idea just to try it.
It's 70.

916
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:28.630
I mean,
I'd rather go out shooting drugs and go out taking,
you know,

917
00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:33.330
kick in the ass.
That was hurt,
man.
That's the thing.

918
00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:37.600
You ever think about that seriously?
Bill was taken one?
Yeah,
excepting one.

919
00:55:37.601 --> 00:55:39.870
I think it's taking one for the team and taking one for the team.

920
00:55:39.871 --> 00:55:42.990
I tell him your number came up side and I'm going like this like this.

921
00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:46.410
I don't think so.
I could,
we work this out now.

922
00:55:46.411 --> 00:55:48.870
I've actually thought he was only a priest.
How I,

923
00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:54.080
how I want to go out in by wolves eat shredded by animals.

924
00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:55.291
Yeah.

925
00:55:55.291 --> 00:55:59.450
I either want to live to be like a 105 like you lived so long that this like

926
00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:04.310
nobody at your funeral because you outlived everyone who gives a shit or the,

927
00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:05.770
you know,
cause that,
cause that,

928
00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:08.980
that is a funny image cause that's one of the things if you live long enough,

929
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:14.250
I'd be worried had people that cared about people doing the eulogy.
Like I mean,

930
00:56:14.251 --> 00:56:17.860
you know,
he says I met him when he was 87 and uh,
you know,
he was all like,

931
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:22.260
he like playing cards.
Those slippers always wore those slippers.

932
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:26.030
<v 4>But if you die like,</v>

933
00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:31.140
<v 0>you know,
like all my friends,
you know who have died tragically fucking young,</v>

934
00:56:31.141 --> 00:56:34.930
its seams.
You pack the house and everybody's up there flying.

935
00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.790
That's the only good thing about dying young is everybody gives a fuck.

936
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.710
There's articles written about you there.
There's nothing worse when,

937
00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:46.260
I mean there's nothing worse than dying yet,
but Diane old also is,
you know,

938
00:56:46.261 --> 00:56:50.200
you sit in there that you got that fucking all terrified picture.
Yeah.

939
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:56.830
<v 4>My uncle Tony,
when he died,
he really was very prejudiced and very angry,</v>

940
00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:00.220
but he also loved his children.
He loved God.
He loved the mountains.

941
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:04.080
And then when he died was so funny that makeup for the racist.
Yeah,

942
00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:09.120
but I'm saying he was that balanced prices on people in the nature love bird.

943
00:57:09.121 --> 00:57:11.530
It's true though.
He was like all that.
And he's,

944
00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:15.310
and we're standing around the coffin.
You see that mountain?
It's for us.

945
00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:19.890
It's for us.
Not these other people.
This is God's country.
But we're,

946
00:57:19.891 --> 00:57:21.850
when we're around the corner from,
we're standing,
you know,

947
00:57:21.851 --> 00:57:25.300
people lie about people after they died.
And this guy leaves for Deli,

948
00:57:25.301 --> 00:57:30.250
who was the first a tank character ever did.
Like I got down a little,
uh,
he said,

949
00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:30.851
we're staying there.

950
00:57:30.851 --> 00:57:34.330
Me and a friend of mine who was a priest and like a couple of my cousins and

951
00:57:34.331 --> 00:57:36.250
we're standing there over the body and he goes,

952
00:57:36.251 --> 00:57:38.470
he never had a bad word to say about anybody.

953
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:42.160
And we went from crying to fucking lab for,
and I'm thinking,
I said,

954
00:57:42.161 --> 00:57:45.430
all we do is have bare word said,
but everybody,
and then he goes,
listen to this,

955
00:57:45.431 --> 00:57:50.230
this is a really old reference.
He goes,
he never hated anybody except Larry Bowa,

956
00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:55.210
right?
Larry Bobo,
the old for the Phillies.
And he goes,
and he looks up,
he goes,

957
00:57:55.211 --> 00:57:59.500
he hated that motherfucker would have vengeance.
Was he a gambler?
No,

958
00:57:59.501 --> 00:58:00.880
he didn't gamble.
He just hated them.

959
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:04.870
He hated the Larry Bode cause he hit one 75 but he was a great fielder.

960
00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:08.920
But I mean,
Halloween.
What,
what an obscure reference to make it a funeral.

961
00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:12.520
<v 0>Excellent general.
Back in the day,
he probably just didn't like second basement,</v>

962
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:15.530
<v 4>maybe got to Florida,
but I love that everybody laughed.</v>

963
00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:19.170
I've had a couple of those.
It like funerals were crying,
crying,
crying,

964
00:58:19.171 --> 00:58:20.004
the crying,
laughing.

965
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:22.470
<v 0>I did that one time.
A Buddy of mine,</v>

966
00:58:22.471 --> 00:58:27.240
his dad died and it was just one of those fucking,
you know,
tragic.
You know,

967
00:58:27.241 --> 00:58:29.730
we were young and he died on a nowhere and the kid had already lost,

968
00:58:29.731 --> 00:58:33.660
his mom was fucking horrible.
And uh,
so it was pouring,

969
00:58:33.661 --> 00:58:38.460
raining to make it even worse.
Fucking like the,
remember the movie seven?

970
00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:43.740
It was raining like that.
Okay.
Yeah.
So we,
we,
you know,

971
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:46.200
go,
you know,
we'll go through the surface and now they're gonna,
you know,

972
00:58:46.201 --> 00:58:48.450
put the guy in the ground and the guy was so popular.
I mean,

973
00:58:48.451 --> 00:58:51.490
there was just a zillion people there,
so they had like one of these,
you know,

974
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:56.310
one of those pop tents with no sides to it.
So there's so many fucking people,

975
00:58:56.311 --> 00:59:00.210
everybody's jamming in there.
Me and my buddy can't get in,
you know,

976
00:59:00.211 --> 00:59:02.670
we're on the outer ring,
we're just getting rained on and shit.

977
00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:06.720
And my other asshole friend is just inside the tent and he's sitting there and

978
00:59:06.721 --> 00:59:09.750
we're all crying and stuff and it bringing the body down and all of a sudden

979
00:59:09.751 --> 00:59:11.130
just from the weight of the rain,

980
00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:16.020
like this little like canals started pouring down in just missing my friend and

981
00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.000
my buddy in the middle of crimes are standing range,

982
00:59:18.001 --> 00:59:20.520
just reached up and adjusted it so

983
00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:21.530
<v 4>it went all over his ego.</v>

984
00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:25.360
<v 0>But he had like this wool kind of coat on so he couldn't feel it at first.</v>

985
00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:29.410
And Dude,
I'm talking,
crying,
laughing,

986
00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:34.510
just crying because it was so sad and that this is take two that I never thought

987
00:59:34.511 --> 00:59:38.020
people ever understanding about comics when they have a distasteful joke like of

988
00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.490
a boat sinks as a plane crash and you have a joke.
Yeah,

989
00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:43.480
they always think it's cause you're insensitive and they sometimes don't

990
00:59:43.481 --> 00:59:47.920
understand that it's,
it's a defense mechanism which getting the pain.
Yeah,

991
00:59:47.921 --> 00:59:51.370
I'm feeling something bad.
I don't want to feel it.
And then you,
you,

992
00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:55.090
you make a fucking joke and then you're laughing because you don't want to feel

993
00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:58.120
that.
So you actually doing it because you can,
it's kind of a,
I've,
I think,

994
00:59:58.121 --> 01:00:01.920
I think,
uh,
it's a dysfunction.
It's kind of a form of dysfunction.
Well,

995
01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:05.610
like the pedophile jokes,
we all know how terrible that is and yet

996
01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.420
you can twist them around.
I usually bring it up

997
01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:15.250
<v 4>back on myself.
You know,
like a one joke that says,
you know what about me,</v>

998
01:00:15.251 --> 01:00:17.440
father,
I wasn't hot enough for you.
You know what I mean?

999
01:00:17.441 --> 01:00:20.290
Like that kind of thing to make it me.
I wouldn't want to hurt a kid,

1000
01:00:20.291 --> 01:00:23.110
but there's a good example of something that's because so many people,

1001
01:00:23.111 --> 01:00:27.450
so much pain,
and I'm not just talking about the physical pain,
but um,
you know,

1002
01:00:27.451 --> 01:00:27.980
we do.

1003
01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.440
<v 0>I,
no,
you're,
you end somebody's life when you,
that's why that,</v>

1004
01:00:30.441 --> 01:00:34.760
that said Dusky guy.
Yeah.
You know,
like they shouldn't put those good date.

1005
01:00:34.761 --> 01:00:38.320
They should automatically get the death penalty just immediately.
Yeah.

1006
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:41.660
It's all the take 'em out,
dude.
If you've got a rabid dog in your neighborhood,

1007
01:00:41.661 --> 01:00:45.440
you fucking put it down.
Those sex offender guys,
that's it.

1008
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:49.980
Because all those people that that dude fucked with.
Yeah.

1009
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:53.810
It's like that's going to now affect,
you want to talk about dating strippers?

1010
01:00:53.811 --> 01:00:58.600
Like how that's going to affect who they pick.
You know who they pick as a,

1011
01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:02.330
uh,
a wife,
how they treat their kids.
They might think they,

1012
01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:04.340
there's a chance that they could,
you know,
sometimes,

1013
01:01:04.341 --> 01:01:05.174
I don't know if it had happened,

1014
01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:08.320
I'm going to go beyond my intelligence on this shit.

1015
01:01:08.321 --> 01:01:09.830
What does isn't too hard to do,
but I,

1016
01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:14.831
all I know is that that's generations of therapy because of the abuse of th they

1017
01:01:15.351 --> 01:01:20.270
repeat the,
the whoever,
they don't get the free,
you can't put that guy in jail.

1018
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.871
And like,
I mean,

1019
01:01:20.871 --> 01:01:25.010
how long like you're attracted to what you're attracted to no matter in a cell.

1020
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.650
Well,
especially dom,
if they stuck you in a cell,

1021
01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:29.870
how long before you wouldn't like big titted strippers,

1022
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:33.810
you'd come out 80 years later.
I'm dumb.
I,
I wait,
get,

1023
01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:37.490
bring me to some big ticket stripper.
Those guys,
like eight year olds,

1024
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:39.770
you stick them in a cell and you talk to him.

1025
01:01:39.771 --> 01:01:43.910
You try to undo it and show him an adult that they're wired that way.
That's it.

1026
01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:47.960
Fucking sick.
Is that put up the ad.
It's,
it's terrific.

1027
01:01:47.961 --> 01:01:52.760
It's why I don't believe in a higher power that gives a fuck.
Yeah.

1028
01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:56.220
<v 4>Well,
that's a whole different subject,
but I understand that.</v>

1029
01:01:56.221 --> 01:02:00.230
But did you hear that pedophile joke about,
uh,
he might have a tell joke joke.
No,

1030
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:00.590
not at all.

1031
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:03.960
It's a two guys sitting on a bench and see an 11 year old boy walked by

1032
01:02:04.890 --> 01:02:08.240
pedophile.
It says it.
The other one goes,
boy,
he must've been hot back in the day.

1033
01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.160
<v 2>He must've been sub the back in the day.
Oh,</v>

1034
01:02:16.161 --> 01:02:17.600
that's fucking twisted.
Yeah.

1035
01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:48.740
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
