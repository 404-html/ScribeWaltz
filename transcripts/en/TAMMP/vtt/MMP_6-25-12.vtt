00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:02.770
Hey,

2
00:00:02.771 --> 00:00:06.040
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.510
June 25th.
Could you hear me looking for the date there?

4
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.260
I kind like was looking and I,
June 25th,
June 25th,

5
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.070
sorry.
I'm actually excited because I'm doing it Sunday night.

6
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.900
So this fucking thing is going to be up at midnight west coast time in the

7
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:30.100
continental United States,
which means I don't have to deal with anybody,

8
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.210
you know,
giving me Shit Dude.
What the fuck?
You know what?

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.790
What the fuck right back at you.

10
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.210
I'm going a great God damn move my Lady Lady.

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.990
You have left this state and I am all alone low now.

12
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.650
And I'm remembering what it was like.

13
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.520
Are you guys single man,

14
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.380
I just made my freckled ass so motherfucking chicken.

15
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.720
I had Bolus.

16
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.070
I deboned those thighs to like a motherfucker.

17
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.350
I'm such a stupid move.
I A hit.
I had boneless chicken breasts,

18
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.240
no boneless chicken thighs.
Um,

19
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.310
and brought Brock.
Sorry,
I can't say that word without,

20
00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:25.120
I can't say Broccoli without a,
an Asian accent.
I don't know why.
I know why.

21
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:27.400
Because when I lived in New York City and I was broke,

22
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.270
there was a Chinese restaurant around the corner and I always ordered chicken

23
00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:36.250
and Broccoli.
Okay.
If I wasn't eating sketti with fucking Prego,
I would call up.

24
00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:39.980
Every once in a while I would treat myself with little Chinese food and I will

25
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:44.150
call up.
They like hello,
number one.
I'm like,
Hey,
number one,
what's up?

26
00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:47.660
Can I get a good,
I get chicken and Broccoli.
They made chicken and Broccoli,

27
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.860
chicken and Broccoli.

28
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.960
And ever since then I've said that she'll just in case you thought I had any

29
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.960
Chinese blood in me,
I don't.
I consider those people,

30
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:04.760
my friends for all the chicken and Broccoli.
They made me back in the late 90.

31
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.160
So sounds like an apology.
Like a corporate apology.

32
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.250
I had no dealings with number one Chinese food.

33
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.740
Uh,
I did stop in there on a number of occasions.

34
00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:19.820
I did partake in some of the cuisine that was offered,

35
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.770
but at no time was there any inappropriate touching underneath that filthy

36
00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:28.370
fucking glass that I don't think was bulletproof.

37
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.150
<v 1>You know,</v>

39
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.450
I'll tell you the Chinese restaurants in fucking New York where I lived anyways,

40
00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:38.470
when I was on the upper east side,
Jesus Christ.
You know what I mean?

41
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.160
It was like you'd have some either was either rusty,
rusty,

42
00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:45.510
great between you and the other person,
or just filthy

43
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.370
plastic or some shit.
I Dunno.
Why don't I don't,
oh Christ.

44
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:53.700
I don't even know what I'm saying.
Look at my dog.
Just fucking lay in there.

45
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:57.390
Can you,
can you get a God damn job and con,
you know,
contribute.

46
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.420
I'm actually jealous.
Thanks.
Fucking skinny as hell,
dude.

47
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.770
But dogs umay she ate it.
Dropped her off at the trainer.

48
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.480
I don't know what the fuck happened.
Yeah.
What were you,

49
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.540
what were you doing over there?
All right,
let's,
let's get the podcast.

50
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.330
Let's get it.
Let's get it back under control.
I didn't do shit today's anyways,

51
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.490
so my woman's out of town,
my lady,
she's out of town.
So,
uh,

52
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.010
you know what's funny is she keeps checking in on me.
You know,
what do you do?

53
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.220
And let's go at odd,
you know,
and you know what it is.

54
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:35.221
It's one because she misses me into because they think that we're fucking morons

55
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.860
and she just wants to hear.
I like,
Whoa,

56
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.120
what a difficult time I'm having without her,
you know,

57
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.910
like,
oh,
I don't really know how to make cereal.
Like,

58
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:50.210
like I'm some Sit-com fucking guy.
All right.
Start.

59
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.730
I was going down.
I did the fucking laundry.
I made myself a healthy dinner.

60
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.560
A protein,
no bigger than the size of my head.
Isn't that what we supposed to eat?

61
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.690
And uh,
in some fun.
A vegetable.

62
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

63
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.510
<v 1>All right.
Go Fuck Yourself.
You know what?
I had a great time doing it.</v>

64
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.230
I haven't cooked in years and you know why?

65
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.710
Because my woman is oppressive in the kitchen.

66
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.430
She loves cooking.
So anytime I go to cook,
she comes in there.

67
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:20.140
She's looking over my fucking shoulder.

68
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.050
Just why are you cutting them up that way?
Why don't you then you're like,
uh,

69
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:25.900
fuck it.
You do it.
You fucking do it.
Why?

70
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.350
I'm
fucking trying to make you a goddamn meals.

71
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:36.010
One of the nicest thing somebody can do for you,
prepare a meal for you.

72
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.660
Just sit there.
Shut the fuck up and let me do you think,
what do you think I did?

73
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:43.210
Eight and an eight on a god damn garbage kids before I met you.

74
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.670
She just gives me shit about the way I make my eggs because she,
you know,

75
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.580
she always says,
I always like whenever I make scrambled eggs or whatever,

76
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.000
like there's too much egg gets stuck to the fucking pan and it's a pain in the

77
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:59.830
ass to watch,
to wash.
I mean,
you know,
it's like,

78
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:03.710
I'm sorry I don't spray it with,
you know,
fuck the ozone layer Pam.

79
00:05:03.711 --> 00:05:07.450
And every goddamn time dripping with the shit,
no wonder it doesn't stick.

80
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:10.180
I'm surprised it doesn't spark it.
Slide right off onto the floor.

81
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.470
This is,
but you know what?
This is what this,

82
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.260
you just listening to a pathetic man whose site that he's finally in his place

83
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:21.490
by himself and he can just deliver his entire argument without being
interrupted.

84
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.330
So,
uh,
I'm telling you,

85
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.710
she wants to come back and as much as she wants the place to be neat,

86
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:33.340
she wants it to be a fucking disaster.
She wants to feel needed.

87
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.670
She wants to feel that I am fucking lost without her and I'm such a cunt.

88
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.830
I am not going to let that happen.
This place is going to be spotless.

89
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.100
It's going to be ready for one of those movie drill sergeants.

90
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.910
You know those guys that get in your face,
hey,
you know,

91
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.420
you can come over here and bounce a fucking quarter right off my goddamn face

92
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.490
ever.
Whatever the fuck they do off the beds.

93
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.910
So he's very,
today I wouldn't ever make it in the military.

94
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.040
I'm supposed to be able to bounce the fucking court.
Why?

95
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.720
Why you supposed to be able to bounce a quarter?

96
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.730
Why does that somehow make me uh,
you know better at fighting the enemy?

97
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:15.170
If I can throw dirty change at a blanket and then to then catch it like the

98
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:19.910
fonts,
you know,
what happened to you sir?
What did you really want to do?
Get?
Oh,

99
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.690
did you really want to do this and scream it p that was your,

100
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:28.190
that was your dream to scream at people for your entire fucking life.

101
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:32.590
That's what you wanted to do
with that Hitler Fade.

102
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.680
Do you know Hitler had like a fresh prince from Bel Air Haircut mixed with a,

103
00:06:44.911 --> 00:06:49.560
uh,
Martin Sheen in apocalypse.
He was Martin Sheen,
apocalypse now on top,

104
00:06:49.561 --> 00:06:53.100
but he had like,
he had a fade down below that,

105
00:06:53.101 --> 00:06:55.890
that will Smith's character with the eight ball leather jacket.

106
00:06:55.891 --> 00:06:58.970
What would would've loved?
You would have loved it.
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:02.670
I've been watching a lot of shit about fucking mass murderers lately and he

108
00:07:02.671 --> 00:07:04.320
always comes up,
of course.
You know what I mean?

109
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.130
And have a think about mass murders without Hitler,
right?

110
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.330
Just can't fucking do it.

111
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.020
Can have a rock show without Zeplin man,
stairway to heaven.
You know,

112
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.230
that's what he is.
You got to fucking have that shit in there.
So I'm,

113
00:07:19.231 --> 00:07:23.130
so that's my goal.
That's my goal.
And I'm actually wrestling with this.

114
00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:28.080
Should I leave the place a little bit dirty?
So she feels like wanted.
Well,

115
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.640
should I just be,
should I just go fucking like,
you know,

116
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.150
just come with the pimp vibe.
Like this place is fucking spotless.

117
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.080
All right?
So you need to be on Umi.
Need to mind your p's and q's.

118
00:07:43.081 --> 00:07:46.440
Whatever the fuck those letters stand for.
What does it stand for?

119
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.280
Somebody going to know somebody actually knows what when you don't,

120
00:07:50.281 --> 00:07:53.370
when you say mind your p's and q's,
there's some Douche.
Listen to this.
Yeah,

121
00:07:53.371 --> 00:07:57.420
you're a dose.
All right.
That knows what the fuck that stands for.

122
00:07:57.421 --> 00:07:59.790
And they've just been waiting for somebody.
You'll fuck it up.

123
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.320
All excited so they can be like,
I know what it means.

124
00:08:03.321 --> 00:08:05.030
We'll send me a god damn email.
And by the way,

125
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:08.120
I haven't said the email for awhile here.
Oh,
what a segue.

126
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:13.070
Fucking classic right there.
I should teach a fucking podcast class.

127
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.980
Uh,
you know somebody's going to do that.

128
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.750
So I always get a podcast class the same way somebody teach a comedy class and

129
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:24.590
that's what you do when you're failing.
Whenever you're failing at what you do,

130
00:08:24.591 --> 00:08:28.430
you teach it.
All right,
there we go.
We just insulted teachers.

131
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.230
Um,
all right,

132
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.250
the email is bill@themmpodcast.com.

133
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.410
Bill at the capital m,
capital m,

134
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.210
capital P odcast.com bill@thefmpodcast.com.
All right.

135
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:46.670
If you don't fucking know what it by now,

136
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.410
just hit stop and rewind on your little player and you'll be fine.

137
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.530
I'll buy the base.
Can you guys,
uh,
I know,

138
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.080
I really appreciate all the input and all that stuff that you guys sent to me

139
00:08:58.081 --> 00:08:59.700
because God knows if he didn't send it to me,

140
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.440
I wouldn't be able to do this podcast.
See,
without you,
I'm nothing.

141
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.340
As they slowly dim the lights and I go into some sort of pandering fucking song.

142
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:12.030
<v 0>Okay?</v>

143
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.950
<v 1>Like that Jackson Browne song singing about the roadies.
Like he gives a shit,</v>

144
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.773
you know,

145
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.110
I think he fucking pissed them off and they weren't set in his piano upright.

146
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:24.240
So he wrote him a song just so they stopped fucking with them.

147
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:27.640
So he get where of his tour and then somehow he goes out of that too.

148
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.310
Just fucking,
the whole thing is,
I hate pandering.

149
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:33.960
<v 0>Okay.</v>

150
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.720
<v 1>I don't like,
and you know,
the only,</v>

151
00:09:35.721 --> 00:09:39.900
not the worst part of pandering is watching a performer go on stage and pander

152
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:44.700
to the audience is watching you fucking animals.
Eat it up,
eat it up.

153
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:48.620
Every God damn time
I go to jail.
You Sob.

154
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:52.590
Do we played a lot of cities but Hartford,
you guys,

155
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.820
you guys are the best and have way

156
00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.080
and me a fucking break.

157
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.790
There's nothing good about Hartford.
You know,
you don't believe me?

158
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:07.530
Ask The whalers.
Why do you think they left?

159
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:13.320
You couldn't even hold onto the fucking whalers.
How does that make you feel?

160
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:17.960
Hartford.
You know,
why they left?
Because that's stupid ass song.

161
00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:22.250
You splay.
Bam,
Bam,
Bam.
Pepper paint.
What's it called?
The,
the,

162
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.540
the brass city orchestra.
Um,

163
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.280
speaking of sports,
I think,
I think my good friend Paul versus,

164
00:10:31.281 --> 00:10:35.510
he's a little upset with me.
He's been on this Robinson Cano thing.

165
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.730
I swear to God since I've met him.

166
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:39.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

167
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.520
<v 1>And,
uh,
he,
he's a,
he's the,
you know,
he's the classic dude.</v>

168
00:10:42.521 --> 00:10:46.460
I called it guy and uh,
he,
he,
he got it.

169
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.760
He called me.
We actually,

170
00:10:48.761 --> 00:10:51.400
he's brought up Robinson Cano to meet so many fucking times,

171
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:55.870
like a year or a year and a half ago.
I told him,
Paul,

172
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.270
like,
I actually put like a gag order.

173
00:10:58.271 --> 00:11:00.310
It's like you have to stop bringing this fucking guy up.

174
00:11:00.311 --> 00:11:04.500
You're making me hate this guy and I don't hate him.
I Dunno.

175
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.530
I Dunno what he said six fucking years ago whenever the fuck Kano came up.

176
00:11:08.531 --> 00:11:13.531
But Paul Versey believes that he is the only person in America that realize the

177
00:11:15.971 --> 00:11:19.660
potential of Robinson Cano.
You know,

178
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.690
and let's just say for the sake of fucking argument he does.

179
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.820
It's fucking seven years later

180
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.380
know he's like fucking you don't either.
And then,

181
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.450
and then he's got all these other calls that,
that,

182
00:11:31.451 --> 00:11:36.160
that fell on their fucking faces.
Right.
You know what he's like,

183
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.160
but all he does is bring up this Robinson Cano.
Shit,
I'm getting sick of it,

184
00:11:39.161 --> 00:11:43.090
Paul Versey cause I know somebody emailed you this fucking link.
All right.

185
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.390
You know what you're like Paul with your predictions.

186
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:51.370
You like Jerome Bettis at the end of his fucking career where he'd have 15

187
00:11:51.371 --> 00:11:55.090
rushes for 22 fucking in the fourth quarter,

188
00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.070
just totally getting shut down.
And then he bust off one for like eight yards,

189
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:00.701
10 yards,

190
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:05.470
and then he would get up thumping his fucking chest like he's been doing it all

191
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:09.310
day.
That's what's bugging me about this.

192
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.810
He called me up,

193
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.580
this is how fucking sick Paul Versey is and why you should see him in a comedy

194
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:19.810
club because you have to see his sickness life.

195
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.660
He called me up,
I'm sitting on the fucking couch,
might,
you know,

196
00:12:26.661 --> 00:12:29.800
might have my own fucking business hanging out with the dog,

197
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.910
making sure the place is spotless.
So when my woman comes home,
she knows I can,

198
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.590
I can take your fucking leave your mind,

199
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:43.030
your fucking p's and q's Lady.
Um,
he calls me up

200
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.190
and I'm going to break his fucking balls about this.
He called me up and he goes,

201
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:51.850
dude.
He's like,
I know you're not going to give me credit for this,

202
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.880
but this one might be my greatest call of all.

203
00:12:57.461 --> 00:13:02.461
He's talking about the Robinson Cano thing and the way he said this might be my

204
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:04.710
greatest call of like,

205
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.130
he's looking back on this hall of fame career as the dude.

206
00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:10.150
I called it guy.

207
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.830
If I told you some of the shit that this fucking guy throughout their,

208
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:20.380
you know,
dude,
Matt Castles,
the real deal telling you

209
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.240
the chiefs are for real man.
The fucking for real

210
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.800
Vince young.
Vince young was a winter man.
All he does is when,

211
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.780
who else?
I can't even fucking remember.
Lebron James.
Lebron James.
He's,

212
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.280
he's afraid of the moment.
The guy is afraid of the fucking moment.
I actually,

213
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.000
I don't know shit about hoop.
When he took one,

214
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.680
Lebron James took that last second fucking shot,
all right.

215
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.080
Against the Celtics and he missed it and it went into overtime.

216
00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:51.910
If forget what fucking game it was five,
six or something like that.
Um,

217
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.860
what was it?
Was it five?
No,
we won't get five.
I can't remember what it was.

218
00:13:56.861 --> 00:13:59.350
Game six or something?
No,
not game six.
They kicked the shit out of us.

219
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.850
Gain five I think it was.

220
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:06.310
He took the fucking shot and he missed it first.

221
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:11.350
He goes,
no way.
Carmelo Anthony misses that no fucking way.
And I said,
dude,

222
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.600
that was a big moment for him.
Whether it went in or not.

223
00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:16.360
That was big for him to get over that hurdle and take that fucking shot.

224
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:17.560
And then meanwhile in the finals,

225
00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:22.561
he hits that killer three to fucking wrap it up that I call him up going dead.

226
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.530
That might have been considering I know nothing of it drives me up the fucking

227
00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:29.860
wall.

228
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:34.860
I went to a Utah Jazz Boston Celtics game and I fucking said call Versie.

229
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:39.910
I'm going to this fuck.
The NBA is fixed.
These fucking guys.

230
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:43.000
At one point you could take somebody's head off,
they're not calling shit,

231
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.610
and then 10 minutes later even look at a guy,

232
00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:48.970
you get a file and then it goes back to taking their fucking heads off.

233
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:51.650
No biggie.
And it's just like,
these guys are dictating pace.

234
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.380
The fucking shaven points.
I don't know what's going on.
Year later,

235
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:55.670
fucking mobbed up rough.

236
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:01.400
If I ever called Versie once about that shit and thrown it in his fucking face.

237
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:04.820
I never have.
I've to this Robinson Cano fucking horseshit,

238
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.130
and this is the thing,
I don't know.

239
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:11.150
One person that ever thought Robin Robinson Cano sucked.

240
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.150
I remember as a red sox fan when this dude came up,

241
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.000
all I remember was go like Jesus fucking Christ

242
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.470
cause he went from chuck knob locked,
then they went to fucking Soriano.

243
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.470
That was annoying enough cause I was,

244
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.710
because at that point we had one shit and I was just going,
can they,

245
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:29.540
can it be somebody who sucks in this tape?

246
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.900
So then they trade Soriana fight on a what?
Right.

247
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.930
And then they bring up Robinson Cano and I was just so fucking eh discouraging.

248
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.850
That's what Robinson can,
was doing.
It was discouraging.

249
00:15:40.851 --> 00:15:43.430
It's like these fucking assholes they got,

250
00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:45.890
they got a guide ever fucking position and they trade a guy and then they bring

251
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:49.490
another guy up and he's the shit.
That's how I remember the guy coming up.

252
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:52.540
I don't ever remember like no getting booed and everybody's saying that he's

253
00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:55.400
sucked.
That's what verse he's trying to claim.
And evidently he was the only guy,

254
00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.190
not even the Yankee Scouts saw this guy come,
this,

255
00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:02.930
this is going to fucking drive him up the Goddamn wall and it's good.

256
00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:05.150
I'm just trying to help out as podcast.
You know what I mean?

257
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.320
This is like a reverse.
You're like an unknown rappers.

258
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:12.200
Make a mix tape and they trashed somebody bigger than them so they can move

259
00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:15.050
their way up.
I'm actually helping him.
Um,
I'm raining down,

260
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.300
mix tapes on to his podcast.

261
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:22.923
<v 2>Okay.</v>

262
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.920
<v 1>All right.
Now listen to verse he's podcast and listen to him.
Fucking trash me.</v>

263
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:32.620
Um,
all right.
I think it,
I think he's quad cash should be called the dude.

264
00:16:32.621 --> 00:16:36.370
I called it a podcast.
I love the guy.
I'm just breaking his balls.

265
00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:37.510
He's fucking hilarious.

266
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.080
And he is one of the best feature acts in the country right now.

267
00:16:41.081 --> 00:16:45.310
So if he's opening for some button up kid,
he's,
he's a,
he's a,

268
00:16:45.311 --> 00:16:49.390
why can't I compliment my friends?
I just can't fucking do it.
Um,
he's,

269
00:16:49.391 --> 00:16:53.140
he's a looker.
All right,
let's,
uh,
let's plow through here.

270
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.830
I just gave him a window.
That's right.

271
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.760
You can't compliment me and you can't give me credit when he fucking pick

272
00:16:58.761 --> 00:17:00.400
something.
I gave you credit,
Paul,
when he said,

273
00:17:00.401 --> 00:17:03.190
I got to feel and Tom Brady's going to get hurt and he blew out his fucking
knee.

274
00:17:03.191 --> 00:17:05.860
That's your best call.
This Robinson Kenosha.
Okay.

275
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.090
You can stick that a fucking pillow and a and I dunno and do something with it.

276
00:17:10.091 --> 00:17:13.660
Go spoon with it.
Cause I don't give a fuck.
You're not getting credit for it.

277
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.080
You never will get credit for it.
Oh,
by the way,
did you guys see,

278
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.050
I know I'm talking a mile a minute.
I'm sorry.
I'm excited.

279
00:17:20.051 --> 00:17:23.410
I made a fucking dinner for myself and it worked.
All right.

280
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.280
I could exist by myself or rub one out today.
I mean,

281
00:17:27.281 --> 00:17:29.290
it was just a fucking self sustained unit here.

282
00:17:29.291 --> 00:17:32.440
I'm ready for the goddamn apocalypse.
My dog needs a bath.

283
00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:35.240
Look at your itching over there like a maniac.
Um,

284
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.740
uh,
what the fuck was I just talking about?
Oh,
I know.
I know.
As says,
I,

285
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.380
oh g I know what I was going to talk about.
I went up to the,
uh,

286
00:17:44.381 --> 00:17:48.910
the Oakland A's facility this weekend.
You know,
cause I'm a giver.

287
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.540
They called me up and they said,
hey bill,
you know what?

288
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:53.370
We want to give out some root beer floats.

289
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.350
You want to do this to raise awareness for fucking childhood diabetes.

290
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.310
And you know what I did?
I laughed at everybody like everybody else going,

291
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:01.731
what do you do?

292
00:18:01.731 --> 00:18:06.731
You fucking get you get you given people root beer floats for diabetes and you

293
00:18:07.421 --> 00:18:10.050
don't see the irony in that.
So I got an email.

294
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:16.130
It says each season fans and media ask about the irony of the Aes root beer

295
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:19.650
float day supporting juvenile diabetes research.

296
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:24.090
So here are the facts for when people ask about it.
Uh,

297
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:29.120
basically eating too much sugar is not a cause or a factor of type one juvenile

298
00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:35.430
diabetes.
Um,
if there's any doctors listening,
let me know if this is right.

299
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:40.431
Type one diabetes also called juvenile diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes is

300
00:18:42.001 --> 00:18:46.440
a disorder of the body's immune system.
In type one diabetes,

301
00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:49.080
the body does not produce,
does not produce insulin.

302
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:54.110
Insulin is a hormone that is needed to convert sugar and statues and other food

303
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:56.640
into energy needed for daily life.

304
00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.720
Scientists do not yet know exactly what causes type one diabetes,

305
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.730
but they believe that the auto Amit,

306
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.390
that autoimmune genetic and environmental factors are involved,

307
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.530
well that pretty much covers everything.

308
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.150
People with type one diabetes must inject insulin several times every day or

309
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:15.480
continually infuse insulin through a pump.
Uh,

310
00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:18.870
eating too much sugar is not a factor.
Limiting sweets,

311
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:22.260
we'll help people with type one diabetes,
keep their blood sugar under control,

312
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.950
but with the advice of their doctor or nutritionist sweets can't fit into their

313
00:19:25.951 --> 00:19:30.630
meal plan just as they would for people without diabetes.
Um,
so they're,

314
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.240
they're basically suggesting that they can have a cookie too when it's not a

315
00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:36.090
problem provided they haven't eaten a whole box.

316
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.500
Like people who don't have diabetes who do that sometimes.
Evidently.

317
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.970
So what they're saying there,
I don't fucking know.

318
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.690
I got to pass this onto a lawyer or something.
Um,
and there are times when,

319
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.370
when sweets are a must,

320
00:19:47.371 --> 00:19:51.990
if the blood sugar level drops too low suites or juice or soda can be the surest

321
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:55.920
to raise it and prevent the onset of hypoglycemia.
Uh,

322
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.800
which evidently I guess this low blood sugar,
uh,

323
00:19:58.801 --> 00:20:03.210
with strick adherence to a specific diet and exercise plan and multiple insulin

324
00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:07.170
injections each day based on careful monitoring of blood sugar levels.

325
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:11.580
A person with type one diabetes can have some control over his blood sugar

326
00:20:11.581 --> 00:20:16.110
levels.
So that's what they say.
Well,
let me ask you this,

327
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.960
the amount of sugar that is in a fucking root beer float,

328
00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:22.410
does anybody need that throughout the course of the day?
Cause I know that,
um,

329
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.370
you know,

330
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.460
some people who have diabetes will carry around a little container of like cake

331
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:30.240
frosting and when their blood sugar goes gets too low,

332
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.410
like dangerously low,
they'll take it out like a little snifter.

333
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.530
Now they'll just take a little a frosting,
write up their nose.
And that's a fact.

334
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.790
You can go to Wikipedia answer,
you go to Wiki answers and a,

335
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:46.110
and look that one up.
I don't fucking know.
I all I can tell you this is,

336
00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:47.800
I did a fucking incredible job.

337
00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.580
I pat myself on the bat like Paul Versey dose.

338
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.810
This might've been the greatest root beer float ever produced.

339
00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:00.910
I,
um,
I got it down to a science,
science.

340
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.610
I got it down to a fucking science.
This is how you do it.

341
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.230
This is how you do it.
This is how was fucking up.

342
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.670
I was putting the ice cream in first and then I pour the root bear on and it

343
00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:15.610
would just start foaming up like I was some sort of a mad scientist.

344
00:21:15.611 --> 00:21:17.500
I'm not leaning over to say hello to you cleo.

345
00:21:17.501 --> 00:21:22.390
I'm just leaning over because my back hurts.
All right.
All right.

346
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:27.070
Beat it.
Um,
is it weird that I like dog breath?

347
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.750
You know,
not bad dog breath,
but just in general it doesn't,

348
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:37.120
I don't fucking know why
I freaked my dog up.

349
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.840
I tell you every once in a while I just grab her by both ears and I yell at her

350
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:44.920
face.
I fucking love you.
You know,
it's weird.

351
00:21:44.921 --> 00:21:48.750
It's like I can't believe how much I love that fucking dog and uh,

352
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.550
I have problems with that emotion so I don't know how to handle it.

353
00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.370
So I have to fucking grab her and have her looking at me like,

354
00:21:54.371 --> 00:21:56.230
what the fuck are you doing?
And then I just yell.

355
00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:59.710
I fucking love you right in her face.
If I told you that before,

356
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:03.150
I don't give a shit.
I got a fucking hour to fill here.
So anyways,
this is how it,

357
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.540
so the root beer float,

358
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:09.541
what you want to people is you want to fill your mug about 40% with root beer or

359
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.680
orange soda,
like a lot of people doing kind of make like a cream sick.

360
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.670
A lot of it,
I don't know,

361
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:21.580
40% and they'd take a nice glob of fucking ice cream and you slammed that fucker

362
00:22:21.581 --> 00:22:24.400
in there,
okay?
You try to let it slide down the side of the glass.

363
00:22:24.401 --> 00:22:27.700
You tilt it like you learn in button at school,
all right?

364
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.130
Because you don't want it to splash because then you're going to have that foam

365
00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:33.430
fucking problem again.
He let it slide.
It's,
this is me.
This is what I did.

366
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.310
People fucking gathering it.

367
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:41.311
My fucking table was me and this other radio dude up there named Icky who was

368
00:22:43.931 --> 00:22:47.200
looked like a fucking j crew model.
I don't know why his name was Nicky.

369
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:48.130
I forgot to ask him,

370
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:51.160
but all the checks fucking loved him and they were looking at me like the

371
00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:53.920
balding redhead that I am,
you know.

372
00:22:53.921 --> 00:22:56.710
And of course like most balding people,

373
00:22:56.711 --> 00:22:59.530
I'm trying harder like that short guy out on the courts,

374
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:03.280
got his fucking Dick on your leg play in defense and some bullshit pickup game.

375
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.700
Right.
One of those guys.
That's how I was making these root beer floats.

376
00:23:06.701 --> 00:23:09.690
I was fucking killing it.
Saw it's Rafe little bit of your work.

377
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:15.430
So,
um,
I fucking,
I got it down.

378
00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:17.620
So I would let that thing slide in.

379
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:23.210
Slide in like a ship being set off to fucking see.
You only do that shit.
I'll,

380
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.020
they don't slide it down a ramp now.
They don't,

381
00:23:26.021 --> 00:23:28.150
they fill the whole fucking thing with water.
What the hell?

382
00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:33.040
Images that I don't fucking know.
Whatever.

383
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:37.840
Like a fucking pontoon boat in us,
in a,
in a,
in a,
in a snowstorm.

384
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:41.200
I don't have an image for it.
Whatever.
Let the fucking,

385
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:46.640
like quint slid down into the jaws or that shark and he end of jaws,

386
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.610
except he's not kicking and screaming.
He's enjoying it,
you know,
like,

387
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.850
like he wants it to happen.
No.
All right.
Whatever.

388
00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.420
So I slide the fucking ice cream down.
There's only a little bit of foam.

389
00:23:57.421 --> 00:24:00.330
And then what you do is you put a little more ice cream in and then you top it

390
00:24:00.331 --> 00:24:04.590
off a little bit of rope here.
Okay.
Maybe take a Napkin.
All right?

391
00:24:04.591 --> 00:24:07.050
You put it on the outside and you hand it to him handled fucking first.

392
00:24:07.051 --> 00:24:11.310
That's what I was doing.
That's the way it went down in case you were wondering.

393
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:16.210
And then I,
then I,
I,
uh,
what did I do?
Ah,
fuck.
I went out

394
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.580
and,
uh,
went to an Italian restaurant and I'm sitting here sitting there,

395
00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:25.960
ordering is really nice Italian restaurant in San Francisco and I swear to God,

396
00:24:25.961 --> 00:24:29.290
I looked over at two tables over and it was fucking Joe Montana,

397
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.810
Joe Montana Almas fucking,
I almost started shrieking like a girl.

398
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:40.360
Joe Montana is the Michael Jordan of,
of uh,
of,
of quarterbacks.

399
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.260
He just is,
he's the best I ever fucking saw.

400
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.660
There's nobody near him.
Fuck all these goddamn fantasy football stats guys.

401
00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.770
I don't give a shit.
Joe got you to the playoffs and when he got to the playoffs,

402
00:24:53.771 --> 00:24:58.480
Joe one Joe and Forno in fucking Superbowls,
that classic story,

403
00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.190
they down against the Bengals.

404
00:25:00.191 --> 00:25:03.960
He sitting there in the huddle during the TV time out,
right?
He just said,

405
00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.940
it's John Candy in the crowd.
Right.
Just totally fuck.
Hey,
you know,
whatever.

406
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:11.050
He's going to go out and throw the ball around when another fucking Superbowl.

407
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:16.150
Right.
Unfucking believable.
So I was freaking out.

408
00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.310
I actually had a buddy of mine asked me,
he goes,
dude,
did you go up to him?

409
00:25:19.311 --> 00:25:21.820
He's asked for a picture.
It's like duty,
Yada.
Your fucking mind.

410
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.390
Fucking Joe Montana.
First of all,

411
00:25:25.391 --> 00:25:29.680
I wouldn't interrupt screech if he was eating and ask him for a God damn photos.

412
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:34.220
Fucking Joe Montana,
Joe fucking Montana.
I don't,

413
00:25:34.221 --> 00:25:37.270
I wouldn't ask if I fucking,
I want to ask Joe Montana for a photo.

414
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:39.350
I wouldn't interrupt him for a photo of him.

415
00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:43.390
I just saved them from fucking drowning.
I wouldn't ask him.

416
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.190
I wouldn't impose.
I would fucking Joe Montana.
That is,

417
00:25:48.191 --> 00:25:52.960
that is the biggest,
most legendary fucking athlete I've ever seen.

418
00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.880
Or He's up there with.
I,
one time I was in Vegas it,

419
00:25:57.881 --> 00:26:00.730
Micheal Jordan walked through the casino like late,
late,

420
00:26:00.731 --> 00:26:03.250
late at night with like three security guards flank at him.

421
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:09.120
I'm wearing one of those NBA on the greatest basketball players of all time

422
00:26:09.551 --> 00:26:12.340
suits looking like 1 million bucks.

423
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:17.410
You did that fucking hoop earring that look like a Goddamn,
I dunno,

424
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.350
like a fucking horse shoe.
Just made out of diamonds hanging out of his ear.

425
00:26:20.351 --> 00:26:23.470
It was,
it's just everybody's stopped even degenerate gamblers.

426
00:26:23.471 --> 00:26:26.140
Everybody just stopped as he fucking walked by.

427
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:31.580
It was right up there with that and I saw doctor Jay at the espys last year.

428
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.260
Those were my big three.
It gotta be.

429
00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:41.090
Those are the three biggest guys I ever saw.
It's fucking unreal.
Joe Montana,

430
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:45.650
I just kept looking over at,
I sent it to my waiter

431
00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.790
when he came over.
I was just like,
is that fucking Joe Montana?

432
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.220
And he was all geeking out going,
yeah,
it is.
How's I called fucking Joe Montana?

433
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.100
I said the f word like 1515 you know what is about Joe Montana fight,

434
00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.370
aside from being the shit,
when he retired,
he just kind of disappeared.

435
00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.160
He didn't go on ESPN.
He didn't do any of that shit.

436
00:27:04.161 --> 00:27:05.180
I'm for the first time in years,

437
00:27:05.181 --> 00:27:08.240
he's finally doing some national commercials with that,
you know,

438
00:27:08.241 --> 00:27:12.020
hey look a little,
these new fucking sneakers,
I'm going to help your old feet,

439
00:27:12.021 --> 00:27:13.310
whatever,
whatever the fuck they are.

440
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:18.370
Is that the worst impression of a commercial ever?
Hey d the fuck is that.
Hey,

441
00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.880
look at these sneakers,
whatever.
So I think that adds to its mystique.

442
00:27:22.881 --> 00:27:27.290
He kind of left like Johnny Carson,
Johnny Carson signed off.
That was it.

443
00:27:27.291 --> 00:27:29.210
He did one Letterman.
I think that was it.

444
00:27:29.211 --> 00:27:32.060
He did one Letterman thing and then that was it called in the tonight show.

445
00:27:32.061 --> 00:27:36.050
One time I think when they were doing celebrity in a sack or some shit like
that,

446
00:27:36.051 --> 00:27:40.250
or he made fun of it.
I do remember that.
But he just left with clash.

447
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.910
Joe Montana did the same thing.
You know,

448
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.980
he's not out there with some NBC Pea coat,
right?

449
00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.620
Just to know what the judge got a dude.
He's not doing that.

450
00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:53.710
<v 0>Okay?</v>

451
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.590
<v 1>Joe Doesn't need to sit there and analyze.
He knows what's going to happen.</v>

452
00:27:56.591 --> 00:28:00.130
He's fucking Joe Montana a dead it.
I'm done with you guys.

453
00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.550
Guy was still in phenomenal shape.
You know,

454
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.380
I was the shit.
It was the fucking shit.
So that was my week.

455
00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.670
I gave out root beer floats the Oakland A's.
Jesus Christ.
Man,

456
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.710
if you want to go to a throwback fucking stadium,

457
00:28:14.711 --> 00:28:18.220
you got to go to the Oakland A's stadium,
man.
And you know what?

458
00:28:18.221 --> 00:28:21.490
You're going to realize how truly fat this country has got.

459
00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:23.020
And I'm not talking about their fans.

460
00:28:23.021 --> 00:28:27.700
I'm talking about how small the corridor is when you walk out to get food.

461
00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.260
Um,
and just the way they used to build the stadiums,

462
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.450
the way they used to build the stadiums.
You know,

463
00:28:34.451 --> 00:28:38.650
nowadays you can order a fucking hot dog,
you know,
while you're rubbing one out,

464
00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.870
taking a piss,
still watching the Goddamn game,

465
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.990
you still have a great sight lines everywhere.
This thing man,

466
00:28:43.991 --> 00:28:46.150
you just walk in and you're,
you're,
you're like in a bunker.

467
00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.800
You have no idea what's going on.
There's like a kitchen TV like 30 yards away,

468
00:28:50.801 --> 00:28:55.300
like,
like hanging from the ceiling.
Right.
That fucking Ken Stabler donated to it.

469
00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.660
That's basically what happened.
And um,

470
00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:04.410
that's what I always realize when I go to the old stadiums is how truly fat this

471
00:29:05.411 --> 00:29:10.300
country has got.
You know,
I guess they will,
they were smaller back then,

472
00:29:10.301 --> 00:29:12.990
weren't they?
They were shorter.

473
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.830
So why a bunch of little people just waddle into what a fucker.

474
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.480
Would the sealants be that high?
I Dunno.

475
00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:24.850
I was like claustrophobic walking through the shit.
I'm just like,

476
00:29:24.851 --> 00:29:29.320
this needs to be at least like another,
like fucking 10 feet wider.

477
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.370
It was like the,
the where the where the Oakland Coliseum,

478
00:29:33.371 --> 00:29:36.910
whatever the fuck they call it.
That is the antithesis to Yankee stadium.

479
00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.550
If you guys,
if you,
I don't know if you've been to the new Yankee stadium,

480
00:29:39.551 --> 00:29:40.384
it's weird.

481
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.960
It's like breathtaking and grownup up Goddie all at the same time.

482
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.660
Sometimes you,
you,
you walk around a corner,
you see something as like,
oh my God,

483
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:51.250
it takes you back to like 1929.

484
00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:53.620
You think Ruth and Gehrig are gonna come walking around,

485
00:29:53.621 --> 00:29:56.620
you're going to hear their cleats and then you look to your left and then

486
00:29:56.621 --> 00:30:01.400
there's some guy behind glass cutting up steaks.
Like,
oh,

487
00:30:01.401 --> 00:30:05.200
look at all the money.
You know,
it's really fucking stupid.

488
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.420
Um,
that's what,
that's what happens when I,

489
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.220
whenever I go to new Yankee Stadium,

490
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:17.250
I either think about Lou Gehrig and the old school Yankees,

491
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.600
or I think of that pizza hut commercial where that fucking white trash whore was

492
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:24.790
eating the pasta going.
And she did,

493
00:30:24.791 --> 00:30:27.580
but she didn't know that it was pizza hut or Domino's or whatever.

494
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.760
And they were like,
what do you think about it?
She's like,
oh my God,

495
00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:35.050
it's so decadent.
Pizza,
hot pasta,

496
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:39.850
decadent.
Really.
Um,
speaking of corporate entities,

497
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:45.520
it's time for a fucking commercial.
Here we go.
Commercial.
All right?

498
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:50.230
There's only two this week.
Everybody,
you know,
some kind of actually said,

499
00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:53.860
you know,
a commercials are only 30 seconds long on TV.
Why don't you get on it?

500
00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:57.610
Are they as enter fucking tanning as these are?
I don't think they are,
sir.

501
00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.130
And then not only 30.
What about those infomercials?

502
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:04.650
Maybe I'm doing a little mini infomercial.
You ever think about that?
You know to,

503
00:31:04.651 --> 00:31:08.020
why don't you just fast forward through it?
You fucking moron.
Alright.

504

All right,
I'm back dude.

549
00:33:45.891 --> 00:33:48.500
I gotta tell you something.
I hate this.
This is the reverse commercial.

550
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.580
The new Mac book pro can suck a Dick.
I fucking hate this thing.

551
00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:58.130
It's unfucking believable.
I knew how to use a laptop before I bought this thing.

552
00:33:58.131 --> 00:33:59.930
Now I don't,
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

553
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.970
I never closed the window with the fuck did it go dude?

554
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.460

they're a bunch of fucking creeps over there.
They really are at Apple.

559
00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.320
A bunch of fucking voyeuristic fucking Weirdos.

560
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.560
They got that whole j Edgar Hoover vibe going on over there.

561
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:37.160
Every fucking thing you do.
Like they're peaking in their fucking nerds.

562
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:38.480
They don't know how to get laid.

563
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.690
So now what they're doing is this standing outside the window of everybody in

564
00:34:41.691 --> 00:34:43.670
this fucking country,
that Dick in their hand,

565
00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:48.690
we're trying to figure out what the fuck you doing.
How is that legal?

566
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.360
Why don't they bring it up?

567
00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:55.050
This is some legal Mumbo jumbo that I automatically agreed to.

568
00:34:55.051 --> 00:34:59.010
The second I fucking bought this phone.
I don't talk to that robot bitch at all.

569
00:34:59.011 --> 00:35:00.180
I cut her out of my life.

570
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:05.620
You know that fucking John Malcovich just giggling like a little God damn

571
00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:10.470
schoolgirl seven a just having a great fucking time with noise.

572
00:35:10.471 --> 00:35:15.390
The hell out of me.
Um,
all right.
Upcoming shows.

573
00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:21.210
I'm going to be in uh,
the inland empire,
Ontario,

574
00:35:21.211 --> 00:35:25.320
California,
June 29th,
30th and July 1st with Cleveland,

575
00:35:25.321 --> 00:35:30.030
Ohio's own Jason Law head and uh,

576
00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:34.470
Kevin Shea.
Kevin Shay is going to be out there.
Uh,

577
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
could meet the Hampton Beach Ballroom Casino 14th and the Newport Yachting

578
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.100
Festival Center or whatever the fuck it is.

579
00:35:41.101 --> 00:35:46.020
July 15th and I'll be a Carolines in New York City from July 26th through the

580
00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:51.021
29th and I'll be making a beeline to the opiate Anthony Program to,

581
00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:51.451
uh,

582
00:35:51.451 --> 00:35:56.451
to defend my honor after Joe Derosa mercilessly evidently trashed me last Friday

583
00:35:57.991 --> 00:36:00.270
on the show.
Okay.

584
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:05.220
Now I know that I shouldn't get mad at him.
This isn't Joe.
This is his addiction.

585
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:10.140
All right?
The sensation.
He had a,
he had a nice run,
you know,

586
00:36:10.141 --> 00:36:14.430
his album sales start a fallen off.
He got,
he got the sickness.
Alrighty.

587
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.450
He was exhausted.

588
00:36:15.451 --> 00:36:19.380
He went away and now he's coming back and he's lashing out at the people that

589
00:36:19.381 --> 00:36:21.630
helped him out in this business.
Okay.

590
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:27.210
Fucking Joe to Rosa taking swings at me while I'm still sleeping,

591
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.860
taking fucking pot shots at me while I'm fucking trying to get my God damn

592
00:36:32.861 --> 00:36:33.840
beauty sleep.
You know,

593
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.670
isn't that exactly what you'd expect from a shoulder list?

594
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.120
Half Egyptian fucking son of a bitch like Joe to Rosa?

595
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:47.250
Uh,
that motherfucker.
He's God a God damned motherfucker.
Um,
all right,
let's,

596
00:36:47.251 --> 00:36:48.780
let's get with the question here.
Uh,

597
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.400
obsessed friend or as I read it the first time,
obese friend,
obsessed friend.

598
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.300
Hey Bill.
First and foremost,
I like your podcast.
Thank you.
Ah,

599
00:36:56.330 --> 00:37:00.570
I wanted to get your opinion on something.
One of my male friends.

600
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:05.400
Do you have female friends?
I don't,
I don't get how that works.

601
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.390
I really don't get how that works.
I ain't had such a funny conversation.
Wow.

602
00:37:09.391 --> 00:37:10.440
Jesus was,
I get going.

603
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.480
I have this conversation with this guy one time and we were talking about guys

604
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.250
like women who have guys,
friends,
straight guy friends

605
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.540
and we will say that we didn't like it.

606
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.230
Like I don't like Nia to have guy friends.
I don't,
I don't like it.

607
00:37:27.231 --> 00:37:28.880
I don't like these guys fucking hanging around.

608
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:33.230
And this guy summed it up perfectly.
He goes to types of guys,

609
00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.480
hang out our friends with women,

610
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:40.810
gay guys and guys trying to fuck that woman and just exactly it.

611
00:37:41.001 --> 00:37:43.530
He put it a little more colorful in that.
All right.

612
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:46.970
But that's exactly how I feel.

613
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.670
You know,
I don't have any female friends.

614
00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.270
I have,
I have a few,
but it's like deaf.
I'd seen him at comedy clubs.
That's it.

615
00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:04.360
We don't fucking hang out though.
You know,
like,
oh,
I'll,

616
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:08.150
I'll,
you know,
let's,
I'll come by,
pick you up.
Let's go to the movies.

617
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:13.210
If I'm doing that with the,
I'm trying to fuck you.
You know,
there's no like,

618
00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.940
what am I sit around and talk about reality TV's or whatever.

619
00:38:16.941 --> 00:38:18.500
Can I be more condescending?
The females,

620
00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:23.310
whatever the fuck it is you guys talk about.
Um,

621
00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:24.203
anyways,

622
00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:29.120
sometimes guys I think have female friends so they can fuck their friends.

623
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:32.900
I don't know.
I've never,
uh,
I never been able to do that.
I just like,

624
00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.480
it's on the tape.
This is you.
You know why I'm here.
All right.

625
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:39.310
I'm not here to fucking borrowing and bracelet,

626
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.073
<v 3>you know,</v>

627
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.990
<v 1>do you know those guys,
the guys that get the most goddamn ass,</v>

628
00:38:48.991 --> 00:38:52.590
other than just those fucking type a fucking,
we just,

629
00:38:52.591 --> 00:38:55.560
they just got that thing that makes girls fall all over themselves.

630
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.040
I'm not talking to them about those guys who just,
you know,
at 13,
they get bang,

631
00:38:59.041 --> 00:39:01.940
a 28 year old hardy.
I'm not talking about those fucking guys.
You know,

632
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:03.610
grow fucking mustache already.

633
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:07.080
You know those guys like banging a teacher and shit and it's like no big deal to

634
00:39:07.081 --> 00:39:09.090
them.
And I'm talking about them.

635
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:13.860
I'm just talking like regular fucking dudes who had to figure out a way to,

636
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.753
to,
to,

637
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:20.490
to get some those fucking dudes who are straight and they do that androgynous

638
00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:24.660
thing where they start borrowing chicks close at chicks like that.

639
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:27.570
It's fucking over.
It's over.
You don't,

640
00:39:27.571 --> 00:39:32.280
when he got a little Steven Tyler in your tank,
you know,
um,

641
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:37.060
anyways,
what am I trying to say here?
Yeah.
You weren't like scarves and you're,

642
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:41.400
you accessorize as you address it.
You know,
there's something about it.

643
00:39:41.401 --> 00:39:43.470
I like God,
I love that.
What is that?

644
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:49.530
<v 3>Is that maze,
but it's amazing.
It's amazing what corn is made out of.</v>

645
00:39:49.531 --> 00:39:51.840
I'm trying,
I was trying to think,
what does that light blue shit that they have?

646
00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:52.000
Yeah.

647
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.830
<v 1>Mexico teal.
Well,
what the fuck do you call it?
Uh,
as tech,
uh,</v>

648
00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:59.860
Arapaho.
Sorry,
we annihilated you.
Here's a casino.

649
00:39:59.861 --> 00:40:01.120
What the fuck is that shit called?

650
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.220
<v 4>Okay.</v>

651
00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:07.590
<v 1>Oh God dammit.
No.
Gives a shit.
Um,</v>

652
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.960
white guy pretending to be a cowboy.
What the fuck is that?

653
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.150
Pretending you have a ranch.
Um,
this,
anyways,

654
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:15.581
where the fuck was it?

655
00:40:15.581 --> 00:40:18.370
One of my male friends who I've been friends with for a long time,

656
00:40:18.371 --> 00:40:20.080
maybe this is a check writing it.
Who knows?

657
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:24.940
Met this girl about a year ago and she has since become good friends with my

658
00:40:24.941 --> 00:40:29.290
entire group of friends.
This friend,
this friend has become obsessed.

659
00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.360
Okay.
The first person you're talking about now,
that's what I'm going,
I'm just,

660
00:40:33.361 --> 00:40:37.150
that's how I'm reading this has been your friend has become obsessed with this

661
00:40:37.151 --> 00:40:41.980
girl and makes it unintentionally obvious to the world that he would do anything

662
00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:42.814
to be with her.

663
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:47.940
He makes every possible attempt he can to be around her to do stuff for her and

664
00:40:47.951 --> 00:40:50.680
even helps her pay your bills.
Well,
I can tell you one thing.

665
00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:55.030
This dude is never fucking this girl.
What kind of fucking approaches that,

666
00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:56.873
<v 4>you know,</v>

667
00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.320
<v 1>that's like giving away merchandise and then when all by the way,</v>

668
00:41:00.321 --> 00:41:02.600
that was 50 bucks there are in the car driving away.

669
00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:04.653
<v 4>All right.</v>

670
00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.690
<v 1>Would you got to do is hold that.
Do you know hike people?
This is how,</v>

671
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.220
this is how you bang a girl like this.

672
00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:13.770
Do you know you have a watch a hockey fight?

673
00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:17.980
They don't stand face to face anymore.
What they do is they stand sideways,

674
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.720
Grab Jersey and they cocked a fucking hand back,
right.
And the standard sideways,

675
00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:23.581
you know,

676
00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:26.250
and you've got that close shoulder so that guy can't really get you with

677
00:41:26.251 --> 00:41:27.840
anything if you're doing it right.

678
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.910
And then if he goes to throw the fucking overhand right,
you're out of his range.

679
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.810
Unless he's fucking really tall.
But I'm just saying generally speaking,

680
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.730
that's how you do it with this girl.
Okay.

681
00:41:37.731 --> 00:41:40.970
You get your hand on a fucking shoulder and then everything she wants,

682
00:41:40.971 --> 00:41:43.010
you hold it away from her so she can't get it.

683
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:47.920
And it's in between what she wants at her.

684
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:51.690
What's in between it is you and your Dick.
Okay.
That's how I,

685
00:41:51.691 --> 00:41:55.220
that's how you got to do it.
That's called the Carsello.
Um,

686
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.960
I hope that made sense anyways.
Um,

687
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.300
and he'll do anything.
He's paying her fucking bills.

688
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:07.550
The annoying part is he will not be straight up with any of us friends and say

689
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:11.090
how he truly wants to be with her.
He will only say she's hot.

690
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.660
Uh,
yeah,
I can tell you was banging this girl,

691
00:42:14.661 --> 00:42:18.220
the guy who's not doing all that shit.
Um,
anyways,

692
00:42:18.221 --> 00:42:22.040
she is aware about how he feels in an attempt to steer him away.

693
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:23.270
She says stuff like,

694
00:42:23.271 --> 00:42:27.650
you're like my brother and will not do anything to make him think that he's even

695
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:33.020
the slightest has the slightest chance of anything.
I'll fuck this.

696
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:37.510
Fuck that.
Fuck that.
All right.
Oh,

697
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.880
but she'll accept him paying her bills.
She's using the guide now.

698
00:42:40.881 --> 00:42:44.810
This guy's a jackass.
This guy is a jackass.
Okay.

699
00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:49.790
He is setting himself up to be fucking used.
Okay.

700
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:53.900
Oh,
you're like a boyfriend.
That's what she does.
I mean,
you're like a brother.

701
00:42:53.901 --> 00:42:56.090
She's saying that right after he pays her fucking bills.

702
00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.540
I bet she doesn't say that before,
you know.

703
00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:01.970
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

704
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:05.180
<v 1>I dunno.
I,
I think this is,
this is obviously his fault.</v>

705
00:43:05.181 --> 00:43:07.160
He's putting himself in this situation,

706
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:11.990
but she's kind of a Douche for a,
for using them like that.
I that I,

707
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.610
that really fucking annoys me

708
00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.910
that that really says something about this other person.

709
00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:22.020
I would never fucking do that
to somebody.

710
00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:24.180
Lead somebody on like that.
Why would you do that?

711
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:27.030
Because you are kind of leave them alone in a little way.
Oh,

712
00:43:27.031 --> 00:43:28.620
what have you taken advantage of?

713
00:43:28.621 --> 00:43:31.320
This stupid fucking puppy love that they have for you.

714
00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:33.413
<v 2>You know,</v>

715
00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:38.170
<v 1>if somebody comes up to you and they're really into you and you're not into
them,</v>

716
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.810
you know,
it's Kinda your job to stay the fuck away from him.

717
00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.950
So they forget about you.
That's the gentleman thing to do.
You know?

718
00:43:44.951 --> 00:43:47.130
If they give you a gift,
you just take it and you go,
hey,

719
00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:50.290
you see that and you'll fucking throw it across the parking lot.
All right.

720
00:43:50.291 --> 00:43:52.270
Just get it over with.
Rip The bandaid off.

721
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:58.330
He just be mean to him.
Something he could get him the fuck away from me.

722
00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.130
All right?
But you don't just keep being nice to them.

723
00:44:01.131 --> 00:44:03.730
Keep hanging around them and fucking letting them pay your bill.

724
00:44:03.731 --> 00:44:07.510
I guess you guys have the same group of friends,
but you know,
she's just be like,

725
00:44:07.511 --> 00:44:10.630
look,
stop.
Pay My fucking bills.
Because at some point I feel like you,

726
00:44:10.631 --> 00:44:13.090
you feel you're going to feel like you can fuck me and that ain't happening.

727
00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.600
All right?
So you get that egg,
get that stupid fucking look off your face.

728
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:20.410
It ain't happening.
I don't like you fuck off.
Okay.

729
00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.160
See at the reunion,
um,

730
00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.150
she sometimes even cracks jokes when he's not around,
uh,

731
00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:31.800
about his never ending attempts to win her over.
Uh,
this girl is a cunt.

732
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:35.730
It's getting to the point where it's pitiful and I want to tell him to stop

733
00:44:35.731 --> 00:44:38.550
being such a pussy and realize it isn't going to happen and move on.

734
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:42.720
At the same time.
He's a good friend and I want to be respectful.
Uh,
and I get it.

735
00:44:42.721 --> 00:44:47.050
She's a cool chick and she's hot and he's trying to get it,
uh,

736
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.320
get it in.
What,
what would you recommend?

737
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:51.720
Sit back and continue watching the desperation.

738
00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:55.260
It'd be straight up and try and talk some sense into him.
Ah,

739
00:44:55.261 --> 00:44:59.850
this is always a hard fucking thing
cause you could be like,
you know,

740
00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:02.220
fuck her,
she's using your,
or whatever.
They ain't going to happen.

741
00:45:02.221 --> 00:45:05.010
And then they end up together and then you're the Douche and you get froze out.

742
00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:05.913
Yeah.

743
00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:06.893
<v 4>MMM.</v>

744
00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.120
<v 1>But I,
I think in this case,
and this kid doesn't have a prayer,</v>

745
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.333
<v 0>he's just,</v>

746
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:19.970
<v 1>he's not even a man to wear at this point.
He's just showing that he's dumb,</v>

747
00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:25.600
that he can be used and that he's not gonna not nearly make as much an hour as

748
00:45:25.701 --> 00:45:29.540
he should because he's a jackass.
That that's what he's showing her.

749
00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:31.300
So,
um,

750
00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:33.360
<v 0>okay.</v>

751
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.600
<v 1>Yeah.
She just,
you know,
at the very least critique the guy's approach to be like,</v>

752
00:45:36.601 --> 00:45:38.550
look,
you want to fuck this girl.
Just,
you know?

753
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.180
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

754
00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.970
<v 1>Just ignore it.
Don't ignore it.
Just be like,
Hey,
what's going on?</v>

755
00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:47.980
Just be your fucking self.
Like,
talk to other people,
you know,

756
00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:51.070
go hit on some mother fucking hot girl in front of us,
some shit like that.

757
00:45:51.071 --> 00:45:55.870
I've said this shit before.
That's what you do.
You know,
go out,
start working out.

758
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.800
Do you know,
take care of yourself.
Get a little fucking spring in your step.

759
00:45:59.801 --> 00:46:01.050
And also what the fuck's he doing?

760
00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:03.700
All of a sudden he's not paying attention to me and that's going to tap into
her.

761
00:46:03.701 --> 00:46:07.990
Oh my God,
am I,
am I not hot anymore?
That that fear,

762
00:46:07.991 --> 00:46:11.530
they have a fear that all fucking hot chicks have the day.

763
00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:13.330
They're not going to be hot anymore.

764
00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:16.030
You know when they stayed out there too long,

765
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:17.740
<v 0>okay?</v>

766
00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:20.060
<v 1>You know,
you got to tap into that shit,
but then you,</v>

767
00:46:20.061 --> 00:46:24.510
you're playing a fucking game.
You know this,
this douchebag,
he's,
he's,

768
00:46:24.511 --> 00:46:26.280
he fucking loves therefore on an asshole.

769
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:28.140
<v 0>Okay?</v>

770
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.240
<v 1>Oh,
you know,
why don't you just say to one night,
just be like,
dude,</v>

771
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:35.710
how long are you gonna fucking chase this chick?
Why are you paying your bills?

772
00:46:35.711 --> 00:46:39.190
You set yourself up like a fucking SAP.
Do you want to bang this girl?

773
00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:42.610
Stop treating her like she's fucking mother Theresa has disgusting.

774
00:46:42.611 --> 00:46:46.360
That's the wrong one to end up treating her like she's fucking Mary the Virgin.

775
00:46:46.361 --> 00:46:49.750
Fucking marry you as a kid.
Give me a break,
right?

776
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.450
Oh,
would I fucking give her shit if I ever saw,

777
00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.890
if I were ever came walking down the street,

778
00:46:55.891 --> 00:47:00.230
my sandals and my role back in the day and I saw the virgin merit.
Raylee

779
00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:06.160
<v 4>how did it happen?
How did it happen?</v>

780
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:08.960
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

781
00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.620
<v 1>how did,

Well,</v>

782
00:47:12.621 --> 00:47:17.510
congratulations Mary.
You got roof eat.
All right.
Don't take a shower.

783
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:21.440
Go down and get yourself fucking swab and let's figure out who did it.

784
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:27.280
Wow.
Um,
Jesus Christ.

785
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.890
Uh,
let's regroup from that one.
All right.
Let you know that that isn't my fault.

786
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:33.960
That's some fucking shit.
That's,

787
00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:37.480
that's cause he does have this God damn question.
All right,
well,

788
00:47:37.481 --> 00:47:39.580
you know what dude,
if you want to tell them,
just fucking tell them.

789
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:41.830
Just tell them if there was a friend,

790
00:47:41.831 --> 00:47:45.550
I can't sit here watching you keep running up trying to kick the football and

791
00:47:45.551 --> 00:47:49.750
watching to take it away.
Okay?
She doesn't fucking respect you.
Don't say that.

792
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:51.010
Don't say anything of that.
The girls said,

793
00:47:51.011 --> 00:47:53.590
because then he's going to say it to her and then she's going to give you that

794
00:47:53.591 --> 00:47:56.080
fucking,
you know,
that look that girls do when they're mad,

795
00:47:56.081 --> 00:47:58.900
where they make their eyes like really small.
You know,

796
00:47:58.901 --> 00:48:02.230
sometimes they have their mouth hanging open when they do it.
Like,
you know,

797
00:48:02.231 --> 00:48:05.530
you don't,
you don't want to deal with that.
Um,
did I even give you advice?

798
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:10.660
I don't remember.
All right,
should I kick my girlfriend's Dad's ass?
Hey Bill.

799
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:14.080
I remember giving advice to a guy about whether or not he should kick his

800
00:48:14.081 --> 00:48:16.450
neighbor's ass while I'm in a similar situation,

801
00:48:16.451 --> 00:48:18.460
only in evolves my girlfriend's father.

802
00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:23.110
I'm 22 years old and I am a first lieutenant in the U s army and I live in

803
00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:24.610
Colorado.
Oh,
Jesus.

804
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:29.140
He up there in Greeley if fort whatever with the bad smell day.

805
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:34.630
Huh?
Could you stop slaughtering cows?
We can't breathe.
Um,

806
00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.070
or they steer,
I dunno.

807
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:41.100
I've been with my girl for a little under a year now and her father has not been

808
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:46.250
a problem up until now.
Her parents are extremely religious.
Oh,
oh.

809
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:47.320
Don't play this podcast.

810
00:48:47.321 --> 00:48:50.980
Especially that last part and they're always trying to get me and my girl to go

811
00:48:50.981 --> 00:48:54.520
to mass with them.
When I first met her,
Oh,
when I first met her dad,

812
00:48:54.521 --> 00:48:56.950
he seemed like a good shit.
Good Shit.

813
00:48:56.951 --> 00:49:01.360
This guy's east coast seemed like a good shit kit.
We are both gun nuts.

814
00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:05.520
So the entire time I was around him we talked about guns,
no conflicts at all.

815
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:07.750
The second time I saw him I was in my,
uh,

816
00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:12.780
my uniform and while we were talking about whatever name shit we were talking

817
00:49:13.511 --> 00:49:17.440
about,
he slipped into the conversation.
You know,
just because you're in the army,

818
00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.460
you know,
just because you are in the army does not scare me at all.

819
00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:27.390
Oh Wow.
Yeah.
That is weird.
Just cause you were in the army.

820
00:49:27.391 --> 00:49:31.770
That doesn't scare me at all.
I raised an eyebrow at this,
but I let it slide.

821
00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.370
I hope you filed that in the back of your head.
That's a weird one.

822
00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:40.140
This is about eight months ago.
Fast forward to about two days ago.

823
00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:45.390
I'm currently moving out of the military housing in Fort Carson here in Colorado

824
00:49:45.391 --> 00:49:49.650
Spring and I'm fixing to move up to Denver to people on buying the house from,

825
00:49:49.651 --> 00:49:50.640
we're still moving out.

826
00:49:50.641 --> 00:49:54.000
So I had to stay at a friend's house and my girl was staying at her parents'

827
00:49:54.001 --> 00:49:58.020
house one night.
We went out to dinner and we stayed out til around 11

828
00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.360
and made out after we ate.
Okay.
People,

829
00:50:02.361 --> 00:50:05.210
this is what I'm talking about where I don't need to every fucking detail.

830
00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.670
Let's just get to the point here.
Um,

831
00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:12.820
I made no effort to fuck this girl because I know her parents will start foaming

832
00:50:13.071 --> 00:50:16.580
at the mouth if I do.
Uh,

833
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:20.390
but looks like I don't have to,
she fell asleep in my car on the way back,

834
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:26.030
so I had to carry her.
I was doing so well reading wasn't I,

835
00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:31.040
she asleep in the car on the way back,
so I had to carry her to her inside.

836
00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:35.850
Okay.
Inside the houses that we were trying to say.
Uh,

837
00:50:35.851 --> 00:50:37.080
when her mom opened the door,

838
00:50:37.081 --> 00:50:40.680
she looked extremely nervous and my girls' dad was sitting in a chair just

839
00:50:40.681 --> 00:50:44.670
staring at me as they walked in and took the girl to the guests from,
dude,

840
00:50:44.671 --> 00:50:48.510
why didn't you just fucking wake her up?
When I went back downstairs,

841
00:50:48.511 --> 00:50:51.630
her dad was waiting for me at the door before I could leave.
He put,

842
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:55.590
he put his hand in front of me and said,
I want a word with you outside.

843
00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:02.160
This is never good.
Whenever it says I want a word with you outside,
um,

844
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:05.400
we both went outside.
He outright asked me,
did you fuck my daughter?

845
00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:08.400
I told him no,
but he replied,
you're a God damn liar.

846
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:13.470
No one stays out that long without fucking,
oh my God.

847
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:19.140
Was he wearing a wife beater with his old man chest sagging a little bit.

848
00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.490
I reassured him I did not fuck his daughter and before I left,

849
00:51:23.491 --> 00:51:27.060
he looked at me in the eyes with his nose about touching Mies and said,

850
00:51:27.061 --> 00:51:29.280
if I find out you ever have sex with my daughter,

851
00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.410
you don't even want to know what's going to happen to you.

852
00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.580
I blankly stared at him for about 10 seconds and walked away to my truck and

853
00:51:35.581 --> 00:51:36.414
drove away.

854
00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:40.120
I'm now living in Denver with my girl and I'm getting calls every day from her

855
00:51:40.121 --> 00:51:44.040
dad asking what we're doing and what our plans for the day or yesterday,

856
00:51:44.041 --> 00:51:47.010
he called up and asked the same old stupid ass question.

857
00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:51.120
And my girl told them we were planning to go out and see a movie yesterday.

858
00:51:51.121 --> 00:51:55.560
He came over to my house without his wife,
since I answered the door,

859
00:51:55.561 --> 00:52:00.060
he told me to step outside and he asked me once again if I fucked his daughter.

860
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:01.340
<v 4>Okay.</v>

861
00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.490
<v 1>In almost identical conversation,
identical conversation,
sued.</v>

862
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.350
Uh,
but this time I noticed he had a sidearm on him

863
00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:15.400
do this is,
this is okay.
This is going beyond my,
uh,
my abilities here.
Buddy,

864
00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:17.980
when he was wearing a jacket with the shoulder host it,

865
00:52:17.981 --> 00:52:22.981
but he's so fucking fat that a pistol insanely contrast with this round yoga

866
00:52:23.741 --> 00:52:26.320
ball body form he wants against said,

867
00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:29.590
he told me that I don't want to even know what will happen if I fuck his

868
00:52:29.591 --> 00:52:33.130
daughter.
Bill,
I need your advice.
What should I do about this prick?

869
00:52:33.131 --> 00:52:37.260
I'm pretty sure that this guy has no idea that I went to ranger school and I had

870
00:52:37.261 --> 00:52:40.780
been trained to shove a knife and another man's neck with a not a Blairite are

871
00:52:40.781 --> 00:52:45.050
right,
are right to what the fuck?
Uh,

872
00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.070
this is what you need.

873
00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:48.070
<v 4>MMM.</v>

874
00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:51.670
<v 1>I Dunno what you need to do,
dude.
This is beyond me.
Okay.
This,</v>

875
00:52:51.671 --> 00:52:56.590
this sounds like the beginning of one of those murders,
these murder things.

876
00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.093
<v 4>MMM.</v>

877
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:04.310
<v 1>I think you to,
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck to do here.</v>

878
00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.560
Don't listen to my advice here cause I'm gonna end up getting sued.

879
00:53:06.561 --> 00:53:10.070
This one's too deep.
You don't need to kick this guy's ass.

880
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:11.630
You don't need to do anything like that.

881
00:53:11.631 --> 00:53:13.280
I think you almost need to go to the cops.

882
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:16.670
Does this guy have a license to carry?

883
00:53:16.671 --> 00:53:19.340
Why the fuck is he sitting there with the pistol and it keeps having this open

884
00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:22.110
ended thing.
Dude,
this is for this guy's fucking nuts,
man.

885
00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:28.170
This guy sounds like he's crazy and,
uh,
I dunno,

886
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:32.910
this is easy for me to say cause I don't have any feelings in this thing.

887
00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:36.620
I would fucking say,
you know what?
Um,

888
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.260
you need to go back and move back home with your parents and you need to live

889
00:53:40.261 --> 00:53:42.060
with them.
And uh,

890
00:53:42.061 --> 00:53:44.730
when your dad can accept the fact that you're an adult and you're going to do

891
00:53:44.731 --> 00:53:47.640
what you want to do,
give me a call.
But until then,

892
00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:50.910
I don't need some guy coming up to me making veiled threats with the fucking

893
00:53:50.911 --> 00:53:55.260
side are all right.
I'm not looking to get shot in the fucking head.

894
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.230
And that's the thing,
dude.
I know you're a ranger and that type of thing.

895
00:53:58.231 --> 00:54:01.440
But the thing about a gun is that makes everybody tough.
Okay?

896
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:06.120
You can fucking kill Bruce Lee with the gun.
So,
uh,

897
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:11.100
I,
I,
you definitely do not want to go,
you know,

898
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.280
Steven Seagal on this shit.
Like,
I,
I don't Dunno,

899
00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:16.680
this sounds to me like I would get out of that relationship,

900
00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.970
tell her to go home and just say,
listen,
uh,

901
00:54:20.971 --> 00:54:24.780
your dad is not ready for you to be in an adult relationship and I'm not ready

902
00:54:24.781 --> 00:54:28.980
to die or get shot at or whatever the fuck it is he has planned.

903
00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:31.290
I am going to stay here and,
uh,
you know,

904
00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:36.150
enjoy my life without fat men coming up to me asking me what the fuck I'm doing

905
00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:37.290
with the women in my life.

906
00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:41.830
Good Luck and God blessed and it's on to Chicago.
Let's win there.

907
00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:44.280
That's what the fuck I would do.
But like I said,
I don't,

908
00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:46.570
don't listen to me on that one eye that is beyond.

909
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

910
00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:52.440
<v 1>Yeah.
Dude,
that's a,
that's,
that's the whole,
that's whole other level shit here.</v>

911
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:56.220
Yeah.
It's guys don't send me and shit like that.
That's,
that's creepy man.

912
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:57.210
That's uh,

913
00:54:58.920 --> 00:54:59.753
<v 0>okay.</v>

914
00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:03.110
<v 1>Uh,
yeah,
that's it.
All right.
Okay.
Let's,
let's move on.
Hey,
breakup advice.</v>

915
00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:04.630
All right,
let's try to break the tension here.
Uh,

916
00:55:04.631 --> 00:55:08.150
I'm 27 and just broke up with my girlfriend at two years.

917
00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:10.100
We took a break for about three months last summer,

918
00:55:10.101 --> 00:55:13.250
got back together in September and had been going together ever since.

919
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:15.420
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

920
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.960
<v 1>Um,
let's read that again.
I was too busy thinking of the other thing.</v>

921
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:21.390
I'm 27 just broke up with my girlfriend at two years.

922
00:55:21.391 --> 00:55:23.340
We took a break for about three months last summer,

923
00:55:23.341 --> 00:55:26.280
got back together in September and vain bend together ever since.

924
00:55:26.281 --> 00:55:28.440
I'm going to guess that this,

925
00:55:28.441 --> 00:55:31.400
you're going to find out she fucks somebody in those three months.
Uh,

926
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:34.860
we've been arguing a lot over the past two months or so,

927
00:55:34.861 --> 00:55:36.870
but it's all about bullshit.
Nothing serious.

928
00:55:36.871 --> 00:55:38.970
Just little nagging things that get us all worked up.

929
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:42.390
And then it turns into a much bigger fight about how we don't see the same.

930
00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:45.900
We don't see the same way on priorities and key relationship points.
Yeah.

931
00:55:45.901 --> 00:55:50.400
You guys,
you broke up,
you got lonely,
you got back together.
If this happens,

932
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:55.590
this is like a,
the breakups,
the tsunami,
and then this is the aftershock.

933
00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:58.770
And finally for the second wave,
uh,

934
00:55:58.771 --> 00:56:01.080
one fight a couple of weeks ago.

935
00:56:01.081 --> 00:56:05.610
Actually it was because she thought she left the stove on.
I said,
no,
it's fine.

936
00:56:05.611 --> 00:56:09.900
She says,
well,
you don't know for sure.
And then an x escalated from there.

937
00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:14.580
I thought that shit only happens on bad sitcoms now.

938
00:56:14.581 --> 00:56:18.240
We've never done anything bad like cheat or be abusive as far as you know,

939
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:22.620
towards each other at all.
And when things are good,
we're totally in love.

940
00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.410
We have all the same interest and enjoy doing things together tremendously.

941
00:56:26.411 --> 00:56:29.290
Unfortunately,
it's only around 60% of the time.

942
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:32.410
The other 40% were kind of on edge with each other.

943
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:36.220
So she ended up breaking up with me about two weeks ago after a stupid drunk

944
00:56:36.221 --> 00:56:40.120
fight when we got home from the bar to Am.
Her words were,

945
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.630
we're just not working.
Uh,

946
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:47.680
now since then she's been commenting slash liking my picks and status on social

947
00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:51.220
networks and I am in me when we're at work.

948
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:54.100
Yeah.
This girl is,
she just,

949
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:58.450
she's not ready to just go walk through the pain by herself.

950
00:56:58.451 --> 00:57:03.010
So she keeps doing it like this.
She goes,
I even got drunk late last night,

951
00:57:03.011 --> 00:57:05.620
phone call then hang up the other night.

952
00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:07.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

953
00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:10.350
<v 1>Oh you did that.
Uh,
she was,</v>

954
00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:14.910
she was the one to break it off too.
She claims she,
she missed me like crazy,

955
00:57:14.911 --> 00:57:17.610
but she just doesn't know what to do.
I said,

956
00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:21.180
we either cut the bullshit and move forward or stop talking completely.

957
00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:24.330
She hasn't replied to me since that last thing I said,

958
00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:26.370
I really do love this chick and imagine,

959
00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:29.350
imagine us spending a very long time together at this point.
Uh,

960
00:57:29.351 --> 00:57:31.470
I'm almost positive she feels the same way as well,

961
00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:34.380
but should I stop being a pussy and just move along?

962
00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:37.920
I'm not sure if these things can be worked out or we both adjust our attitudes

963
00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:39.120
or if they really are,

964
00:57:39.121 --> 00:57:41.940
is a more serious problem in the big picture of relationship.
Any feedback?

965
00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:43.520
What else?
Um,

966
00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:51.110
uh,
I dunno.
Do you know what to just take three months for use?
Fuck itself?

967
00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:57.390
Three,
three,
six months.
Just get away from it.
Don't talk to her six,

968
00:57:57.391 --> 00:57:59.340
eight months if you're still fucking,
I don't know.

969
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.260
I don't know how long have you guys,
we went off for like two years.

970
00:58:01.261 --> 00:58:05.270
It's going to take like,
it's gonna take like six,
eight months to kind of,

971
00:58:05.271 --> 00:58:08.610
you know,
it's sucks.
If you love somebody,

972
00:58:08.611 --> 00:58:12.900
it's going to take that long just to kind of get it going again.
But,
um,

973
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:14.970
<v 0>okay,</v>

974
00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:17.220
<v 1>look,
dude,
if you're going to marry this chick someday,
you know,</v>

975
00:58:17.221 --> 00:58:20.040
why not go out and bang a bunch of broads now before we get back together with

976
00:58:20.041 --> 00:58:22.410
her and it's going to be her call because she fucking broke up with you.

977
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:27.810
I always have the same advice.
Just fucking focused on yourself,
you know,

978
00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:30.150
get in great shape,
go out,
go chat up.

979
00:58:30.151 --> 00:58:33.540
Some fucking girls you think are out of your league,
who knows?

980
00:58:33.541 --> 00:58:36.770
You might meet a better one,
who knows who the fuck knows.
But,
uh,

981
00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:41.530
at this point she's,
you know,
I,
I w I would definitely,
uh,
you just going to keep,

982
00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:42.870
when you break up with somebody,

983
00:58:42.871 --> 00:58:45.510
you got to get away from him or are you just going to keep part in each other

984
00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.370
and um,

985
00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:49.360
<v 0>yeah.</v>

986
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.860
<v 1>You know,
I,
I don't advise,</v>

987
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:54.280
advise going out getting plast or need a bunch of shit food and becoming a

988
00:58:54.281 --> 00:58:59.150
fucking depressed tub of shit.
Uh,
you know,
jerking off with Kim,

989
00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:03.610
you know,
KFC containers around it.
Don't do that.
Go the other way.
All right,

990
00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:06.640
go the other way.
I Dunno dude.

991
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:09.430
Just go do some shit you couldn't do when you were fucking with her.

992
00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:14.260
You know what I mean?
Go take a road trip.
Go,
go to a fucking baseball stadium.

993
00:59:14.261 --> 00:59:18.910
You wanted to go to go do some fun,
dumb shit.
Whatever the fuck you want to do.

994
00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:22.340
Learn how to ride a motorcycle.
Some fucking cool guy.
Shit.

995
00:59:22.341 --> 00:59:26.810
Just go have a good fucking time to something going on all star game.
You know,

996
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:31.160
go out to Vegas,
go to that fucking whore ranch,
whatever the fuck you want to do.

997
00:59:31.161 --> 00:59:32.990
Go do some shit like that.
And then,
you know,

998
00:59:32.991 --> 00:59:36.470
if you still give a fuck about her and you know,
by the time the next election,

999
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:39.920
uh,
that I,
I dunno,
I dunno what to tell you

1000
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:43.730
that then,
then figure it out from there.

1001
00:59:43.731 --> 00:59:45.380
But at this point I would stay away from each other.

1002
00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:48.740
She stopped hurting each other.
Right.
Convincing my girlfriend to get a dog.

1003
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:51.280
All right.
This is a nice show and a billion person.

1004
00:59:51.790 --> 00:59:54.170
I been live with my girlfriend for about a month plus now.

1005
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.380
It's seriously the greatest relationship I've ever been in.
Really?
In a month.

1006
00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:02.450
Yeah.
You fucking every day.
Why wouldn't it be awesome?
Um,
and see,

1007
01:00:02.451 --> 01:00:05.120
I just took all the joy out of that.
Maybe you found the one,
I don't know.

1008
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:07.430
In order to take this relationship to the next level,

1009
01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:10.310
I would really like us to get a great Dane.

1010
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.230
Oh,
sorry.
I just had to take a look here.
You have to live with this girl.

1011
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:17.830
You just moved in for a month.

1012
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:20.203
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1013
01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:23.280
<v 1>And now you want to get a great Dane.
Everything's going great.</v>

1014
01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:27.540
You fucking like rabbits.
And now you want to live with a little horse.
All right.

1015
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:31.680
I would really like us to get a great day from all great Dane owners.

1016
01:00:31.681 --> 01:00:33.390
I hear they are the laziest dog,

1017
01:00:33.391 --> 01:00:37.220
so they don't require a ton of work in comparison to terror.
Terrorists,

1018
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:41.070
for example,
do,
but they take up the whole apartment.

1019
01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:43.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1020
01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:43.450
<v 1>All right.</v>

1021
01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:47.380
They take a shit the size of that fucking age Salami they have hanging in those

1022
01:00:47.381 --> 01:00:50.680
fucking Italian restaurants.
You know,

1023
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:53.340
you've got to pick it up with a fucking hefty bag.

1024
01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:57.940
I don't know to each his own the main reason why I need her approvals because

1025
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.050
she'll have to participate in the working in the work of taking care of the dog.

1026
01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:07.260
Most of my work involves me being gone for 12 to 14 hours a day at to you outta

1027
01:01:07.511 --> 01:01:11.770
your mind while her job is nine to five how do you suggest I convinced this

1028
01:01:11.771 --> 01:01:14.990
woman to agree to get a dog?
Dude,
don't get a dog.
Don't,

1029
01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:16.360
that's not fair to the dog.

1030
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1031
01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.120
<v 1>Okay.
You're basically never there and she works nine to five.
You're,
you're,</v>

1032
01:01:21.121 --> 01:01:24.240
you're,
you're not in a place right now to get a dog.
Dogs need attention.

1033
01:01:24.241 --> 01:01:27.720
They're pack animals.
They like laying around with you.
All right?

1034
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.700
It's hard enough for them for free to leave for an eight hour day.
Um,

1035
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.670
<v 0>okay.</v>

1036
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:34.990
<v 1>That's not fair to the dog,
man.</v>

1037
01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.250
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1038
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:38.410
<v 1>Um,
it's great that you're a dog lover,
but,
uh,</v>

1039
01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.690
and also I don't think it's good for your relationship.
You just moved in.

1040
01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.670
He just figuring out who does what.

1041
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:45.670
You having a good time and then you got to add this fucking thing that's going

1042
01:01:45.671 --> 01:01:47.260
to come in.
It's probably going to be a puppy.

1043
01:01:47.261 --> 01:01:48.760
It's going to be shitting all over the place.
You're going to,

1044
01:01:48.761 --> 01:01:52.270
you're going to kill you utopia.
I think it's a bad move,
Dude.

1045
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:55.090
I think it's great to get a dog.
It's the greatest fucking thing I ever did.

1046
01:01:55.091 --> 01:01:59.730
I love having a dog,
but I waited till I had a schedule,
you know,
and I,

1047
01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:02.740
and I was with the right person and all that type of shit and I didn't figure

1048
01:02:02.741 --> 01:02:06.810
that out a month.
So,
uh,
I don't know,
Dude.
I think that's,

1049
01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:11.020
that might be throwing a giant fucking wrench in your situation.

1050
01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.970
Uh,
but let me know how it works out.
All right.
Overrated.
Underrated,
underrated.

1051
01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:19.000
Uh,
if you guys want to send the overweight and underweight,

1052
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:21.310
this is something else that you also send to that,
right?
That uh,

1053
01:02:21.311 --> 01:02:25.800
that email address that I uh,
I I gave you earlier.
I'm underrated.

1054
01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.790
Taking a punch from your girlfriend's ex.
Uh,

1055
01:02:29.791 --> 01:02:33.480
I was out at a bar with my lady in some of my lady and some other friends.

1056
01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.160
I come back from a bar to see this guy yelling at her friends.

1057
01:02:37.161 --> 01:02:41.550
So I Mosey on over and make sure nothing's going down while I'm looking at the

1058
01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:45.870
Tigers game on TV.
He takes a swing at me and I took it like a champ.

1059
01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.430
That's the end of the story,
Dude.
You got to write me back.

1060
01:02:49.431 --> 01:02:53.270
I got to know what happened.
Overrated bouncers.
Oh,
here we go.

1061
01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:56.780
They grabbed both of us before I could get a swinging,

1062
01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.450
but oh well taking his punch.

1063
01:02:59.451 --> 01:03:03.980
Got My girl to do anything I wanted that night and it made me look like a bad

1064
01:03:03.981 --> 01:03:08.360
ass when the punch didn't faze me.
Ah,

1065
01:03:08.361 --> 01:03:10.940
that's hilarious.
See that.
See what happens.

1066
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:15.710
See what happens when you get jealous over a woman.
You go over your punch,

1067
01:03:15.711 --> 01:03:17.780
somebody in the face,
it doesn't even hurt.

1068
01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:23.250
And then he's banging that chicken the ass.
There's a lesson right there.

1069
01:03:23.251 --> 01:03:27.660
There's one to grow on,
underrated.
A cleaning your car,
clean that shit up.

1070
01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:30.840
There's nothing worse than getting to a friend's car and having you having to

1071
01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:33.330
place your feet between two buckets of water.

1072
01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.840
Two months old of water bottles and coffee cups.
Absolutely.

1073
01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:41.420
I recently heard a girl on Ari Shaffir.
Yep.
Podcast.
Uh,

1074
01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:45.470
you guys gotta check that out by the way.
That's another one of my favorites.
Uh,

1075
01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:50.690
Ari spelled Ari Shaffir.
S.
H.
A.
F.
I.
R.
A podcast.

1076
01:03:50.691 --> 01:03:55.350
Say there's that girls.
Take that as a sign of how clean your bedroom is.

1077
01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:56.250
I think it's true.

1078
01:03:56.610 --> 01:04:00.450
One of my buddies' cars look at it looks like a recycling center and his bedroom

1079
01:04:00.451 --> 01:04:04.500
looks like it hosted a motley crew after.
Except that's not,

1080
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:09.240
except that's not cool.
And there was no,
there was no party.
Uh,
yeah,
absolutely.

1081
01:04:10.570 --> 01:04:15.160
I fucking can't stay in a woman with a messy car.
You know,
you get an,
Oh my God,

1082
01:04:15.161 --> 01:04:19.500
I have a cat on Psi and he got cat hair all over you.
You know,

1083
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:22.150
and then you see what they ate for the last six fucking weeks.

1084
01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.570
It's disgusting or a,

1085
01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:28.600
and I think when girls have like fucking half their wardrobe,
it's just,

1086
01:04:28.601 --> 01:04:30.220
it's disgusting.
You know what I mean?

1087
01:04:30.221 --> 01:04:34.810
And I imagine like a guy's filthy car has got to be even fucking worse.

1088
01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:35.561
And I,

1089
01:04:35.561 --> 01:04:38.200
I bet that's even more of a turn off for a woman just because of the way we're

1090
01:04:38.201 --> 01:04:42.490
set up physically.
You know,
I just look at him like us.
Gross,
disgusting.

1091
01:04:42.491 --> 01:04:45.700
I don't want a banger.
You know,
they gotta look at your bill and we go,

1092
01:04:45.701 --> 01:04:47.860
this guy's disgusting.
He's going to enter my body.

1093
01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:57.630
All right.
Overrated.
Drinking coffee to stay awake.
Yeah.
You might wake up a bit,

1094
01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:00.870
but you function like an asshole and your breath smells like an ashtray.

1095
01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.160
Eat an apple and Google for a run.
Um,

1096
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:08.440
that's how you wake yourself up.
Jesus Christ.
That's pretty healthy.
All right,

1097
01:05:08.441 --> 01:05:11.740
youtube a video of the week.

1098
01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:15.160
I actually just watched the first 10 minutes of this.
This is fucking awesome.

1099
01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:19.240
If you guys want to watch a great documentary,
it's a documentary about bouncers.

1100
01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:24.100
Uh,

1103
01:05:31.451 --> 01:05:34.870
You get to see these guys tell their stories.
You know,
some of them are smart,

1104
01:05:34.871 --> 01:05:37.210
some of them are meat heads.
I think they have a nice balance.

1105
01:05:37.211 --> 01:05:40.930
Some guys don't want to get into a fight.
Some guys who like,
one guy's just like,

1106
01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:43.900
sometimes I just want somebody to say something just to give me an excuse.

1107
01:05:43.901 --> 01:05:46.840
He's like fucking squeeze in his fists together,
sweating and Shit.

1108
01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:50.200
It's a great one.
