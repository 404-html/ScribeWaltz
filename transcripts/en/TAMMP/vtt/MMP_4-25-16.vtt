00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.200
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn is time for the Monday morning podcast from my

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.440
Monday.
Um,
was it April?
We're going to go with April,

3
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:14.910
April 25th,
2016 what's going on?
Hello?

4
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:19.570
How are you?
How I,
yeah.
Um,
I just got back from Iowa,

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.180
uh,
connected to Phoenix,
could not get a direct flight out of Des Moines,

6
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.350
des Moines International Airport in De Moines,
Iowa.

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.410
One of the greatest international airports you'll ever go to.

8
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.050
My hotel was right next door to it.
I was,

9
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.490
I was there for about three hours before the show.
Okay.

10
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.320
I think I heard three jets take off.
That's fucking awesome.

11
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.750
It's a decent size airport too,
but there's very little people you know,

12
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.230
come out on in cornfields,
you know,

13
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:56.160
getting out of their death metal fucking band rehearsal and going to the de

14
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.780
Moines international airport to fucking go anywhere evidently,
um,

15
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.170
breezed right through security,
all the whole thing.
I love fucking,

16
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.610
I love little airports.
Um,

17
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.100
I love him the way some of these chicks loved that dude who left at fucking band

18
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.670
that was poor fucking little girls.
Oh,
goody two.
Um,

19
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.660
what if fucked up parents film their kids in embarrassing moment.

20
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:24.540
I can see if siblings do it,
but it always seems like a lot of parents,

21
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:28.920
they just film their fucking kids and it's just like all those girls who fucking

22
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.680
got filmed or film themselves,
you really should take it down.

23
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:35.640
But once it's up to you,
get you finished,
you fucking done.

24
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.530
You can't run for president with that on your fucking profile history.

25
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.190
I wonder who's gonna be the first one to run for president.
Right.

26
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.570
And then they just pull up,
uh,
you know,

27
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:52.390
some clip from the childhood on Facebook or on Youtube assumption,

28
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.730
some video of them either saying something fucked up or getting hit in the balls

29
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.600
and then crying like a little girl or something like that.
You know,

30
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.050
you remember that time when that fucking,

31
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.150
that fat kid through that thing at the little kid and the kid ran over and he

32
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:10.810
threw the skateboard at him and the kid fucking fell down and let out a cry leg.

33
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.420
I can't even fucking do it in that moment.

34
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.490
That kid's life is far as any sort of leadership role is over,

35
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.730
you know,
and I know what you're saying,
you go well look at him,

36
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:28.870
bellies out dairy and rank Danks running around with this high pitch voice.

37
00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:30.550
Who's going to follow that into battle?

38
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.180
It's like people fucking develop later in life.
You know,

39
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.630
you should have seen me when I was a kid.
A better yet.

40
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:41.110
It was good thing you didn't fucking orange hair,

41
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.030
you know,
fucking total introvert,
lunatic,

42
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.890
lunatic.
Literally could not talk to a girl without my face turned beet red.

43
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.270
I was a fucking mess.

44
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.710
If there was fucking videos of that or all the fucking ass kickings I took,

45
00:02:56.711 --> 00:03:00.060
I remember a girl beat me up enough when I was in third grade.

46
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.650
This fifth grade girl beat me up cause I was playing with this kickball and her

47
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.260
sister came up,
was playfully taken it away from me.

48
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.680
So I ran up to take it back and she was running along the school and I ripped it

49
00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:12.480
out of her hands.
You know,

50
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.290
you used to play with boys and she's Kinda careened into the side of the school,

51
00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:20.790
which of course is made of brick cause you know,
if it catches fire,
you know,

52
00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:23.880
you want something to be able to rebuild on,
you know,

53
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.790
I mean all those rugs and everybody inside are going to go up like a fucking

54
00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:27.361
bowling alley.

55
00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:31.590
But you want the main structure because the town's got to pay for it.
So anyways,

56
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.140
she goes into the building,
hit her head and as I'm like,
Oh fuck,

57
00:03:37.141 --> 00:03:37.974
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.480
Her fucking sister showed up and there's a big difference between third grade

59
00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:44.580
and fifth grade.
She looked like a substitute teacher.

60
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.270
I mean that's how much fucking older she looked at me and she fucking just rain

61
00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:52.650
these fucking punches down on me.
And uh,
I held it together,

62
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.800
you know,
I,
you know,
I waited till the end of the round.

63
00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:58.380
I knew I was going to lose the decision and I was all right.

64
00:03:58.381 --> 00:04:01.680
I was trying to walk it off.
It really fucking hurt.
And then some girls,

65
00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:04.260
I forget what she said to me,
but it actually made me cry.

66
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.930
She said something supportive.
I have no idea.
So,
um,

67
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.940
yeah.
Now if there was video of that,
I mean that's it.
If they ever had,

68
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.820
I mean there's a guy you are running the country,

69
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.660
get beat up by a girl and start crying.

70
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.060
<v 2>Okay.</v>

71
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.530
<v 0>Hi.
How's he going to keep America safe?
How's he going to keep children safe?</v>

72
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.470
How's he going to keep Jesus safe?

73
00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:34.350
And then that's going to be ended at the end of it.
All these fucking people.

74
00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:36.090
You've just film your fucking kids.

75
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.423
<v 2>Okay.</v>

76
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.300
<v 0>All is oversharing.</v>

77
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.700
I don't give a fuck that your kids 13 years old is in love with a boy band.

78
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:44.400
Stopped filming the fuck.
I mean I,

79
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.270
I'm not talking about the kids who filmed themselves,

80
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:48.160
but just sometimes it's parents,
which is really weird.

81
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.460
Like I hate those families that I'll get into their care van and they start

82
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:55.360
singing songs or doing dances and that just,
wow.

83
00:04:55.361 --> 00:05:00.310
That's the funnest family ever.
You know,
I can see through it.
You know,

84
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:03.580
the second the camera turns off,
the dad turns into Joe Jackson

85
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.370
so beaten their ass is all over the fucking house.
Um,

86
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.080
anyway,
sorry that was just a complete,
a complete left turn.

87
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.960
But
I dunno,

88
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.050
I'm actually fascinated with that dude leaving the boy band if the height of

89
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:27.490
their fucking popularity,
you know,
just as far as you know,

90
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.160
being in the entertainment business going,
all right,
and how do you do this?

91
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:32.620
Did he make enough fucking money?
You know,

92
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.340
Goddamn well his manager and everyone around them stole from the guy.

93
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.100
Did he make enough fucking money?

94
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.340
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.990
<v 0>The thing about it is,
is he's so young,</v>

96
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:46.050
he's going to look like that guy for a while.
So it's not like,
you know,

97
00:05:46.051 --> 00:05:50.190
he's at that age where he could just slip back into the,
uh,

98
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.710
you know,
like at my age I'm going to be 48 and 10 years.
I'll be 58.

99
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:57.880
I'm going to little away fucking different.
Okay.

100
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.570
48 is the last sort of like,
you know,

101
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.050
I could go down and maybe play some pickup hoop and I could get picked last.

102
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.640
That's it.
And then 48 to 58 that's,
you know,

103
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.210
when you start getting the chicken neck,
you know,

104
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.490
you start getting your affairs in order.

105
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.060
It was kids like fucking 21,
you know,
it's barely going to be 30,

106
00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:22.540
right?
A little over 30 I should say.
So if I was him,

107
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.900
I would shave off dead fucking facial hair and I would just start eating

108
00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:31.300
Mcdonald's and I've just become a fat fuck.

109
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.540
And then I just wait to see how,
why you don't have to be a fat guy.

110
00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:35.500
If you're a fat guy,
then

111
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.290
<v 3>okay.</v>

112
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.420
<v 0>Danielle,
like feel like famous in a different way.</v>

113
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.910
Like everybody looks at you but you don't have a show,
you know,

114
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.230
if you get to that level of fat,
all right,
don't get like circus fat.

115
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.530
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

116
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.780
<v 0>that'd be funny if he did that and it was just so good at everything.</v>

117
00:06:49.781 --> 00:06:52.360
He became like the fattest guy ever,
you know?

118
00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:55.200
And then everyone was staring at him again.
He's just like,
fuck,
I just,

119
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.680
I can't not be famous.
Um,

120
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.330
anyways,
good luck to that kid.
And,
and parents take,
take down the fucking videos.

121
00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:06.070
You got damn kids,
you fucking Weirdos.

122
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.700
There's probably some pervert out there that likes to jerk off to fucking girls

123
00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:13.720
crying to boy band members who just left.
It was probably a fetish at this point,

124
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.900
you know,
it's nothing else left to jerk off you Korea new,

125
00:07:16.901 --> 00:07:19.750
literally create a new type of porn.

126
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.450
All right.
Anyways,
plow plowed ahead.

127
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.600
Now I know what all you guys take.
I'm going to talk about,
you know,
yeah,

128
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.350
we're going to be like,
oh I saw a big sports story.
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
I hope it,

129
00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:39.400
I hope he didn't fucking record as podcast before that went down.
Well I didn't,

130
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.980
I didn't.
Okay.
I will talk about that later.

131
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.620
I just don't give a fuck the way I used to.
Um,

132
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.010
but let's get to what I really give a shit about.

133
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.040
It's only two things I give a fuck about right now.

134
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.280
Gay seven in Saint Louis.

135
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.153
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

136
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.360
<v 0>And fucking gave five back in Atlanta.</v>

137
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:00.830
<v 3>Okay.</v>

138
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.030
<v 0>The Boston Celtics.</v>

139
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.650
I missed every fucking second of the last two games cause I was on the road.

140
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:12.050
I missed all of them.
It was fucking driving.
I didn't have my foam ra,

141
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.720
so my fucking leg was going down.

142
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.680
Now my head to fucking pull over at a rest area,
you know,
stretch it out,

143
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:19.933
you know what I mean?

144
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.500
Keep my head on a swivel looking for fucking truckers,

145
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:28.430
questioning their sexuality and fucking a,
what are they?
These serial killers,

146
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.310
Sierra kill his love of fucking rest area.
So anyways,
um,

147
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.040
I missed,
I missed all of that.
All I know is that they came back,
they tied it up.

148
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.220
I was so happy and I did see the clip of whoever that was,

149
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:45.430
was it a smart on the fucking smart on the Celtics,

150
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.940
barely getting touched and literally throwing himself out of bounds.
I mean,

151
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.520
I know he got fined five grand.

152
00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:56.521
They should've given them at least like $1,000 off just cause he kind of hurt

153
00:08:56.751 --> 00:08:57.950
himself.
He went up so high.

154
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.400
That was one of the worst fucking dives I've ever seen in my life.

155
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.550
And uh,
I mean,

156
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.670
I even think for the Celtics probably teased him about that by the time we got

157
00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:10.430
the locker room.
It's like Jesus Christ who just flopped to the ground.

158
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.800
He fucking jumping up in the air.
Um,
anyways,

159
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.390
and the St Louis Blues,
what the fuck?
You know,

160
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.870
I already went to a heartache with my team.
I fucking hitch my wagon to you guys.

161
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.330
You get up three to one.
I knew,

162
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.080
I fucking knew they had to win game five,
game five,
you know,

163
00:09:30.081 --> 00:09:33.410
so fucked up about a seven game series is you're up three games to fucking one

164
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.900
and you thinking like,
oh we got do is just fucking when one,
no,

165
00:09:35.901 --> 00:09:40.550
you fucking have to won game five because the second you don't win game five the

166
00:09:40.551 --> 00:09:42.080
last two games,
the pressure's on you.

167
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.720
All of a sudden it goes home and wait a minute.
[inaudible] five bar bill.

168
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:47.950
The other guys,
when the next game

169
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.340
<v 4>tied up in a,
you know,
I'll tell you right now,</v>

170
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.920
Chicago Blackhawks chapter momentum going into game seven,

171
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.060
the Seiko with blues have a history of playoff collapses.
You know,

172
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:02.680
that's all it is.

173
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.890
<v 0>Say It on the fucking,
oh my God.</v>

174
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.930
Oh my God.
I had such belief in this team.

175
00:10:10.931 --> 00:10:14.080
I still believe me when I'm fucking three games to one and I was sitting there

176
00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.290
and I said,
without a doubt,
I said,
the fucking Celtics,

177
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.130
we're gonna win game three.
I called it and then I talked shit.
And I said,

178
00:10:21.131 --> 00:10:23.500
like I said,
the self do,
so we're going to win game three,

179
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.520
the fucking Saint Louis Blues are going to win game six.

180
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:32.530
And they were up three to one before I went on stage and Kansas City.
Uh,

181
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.480
and I was thinking like,
all right,
they got that fucking,
was it Elliot net?

182
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.040
He's playing great,
they got date,
you have a size advantage,
Yada Yada.

183
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:44.760
I'd like to think of this looks pretty good.
So I go on stage,
right?

184
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.930
I do my Shit Dick Jokes for about a good hour and a half.
I come off the stage,

185
00:10:49.931 --> 00:10:54.931
had a great fucking show and I walk in the green room and all the fucking a

186
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.110
Black Hawk's ski of fucking cheese in ear to ear grin.

187
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.910
The cut to Mike Milburn and I see a final score was also like six to three.

188
00:11:03.911 --> 00:11:07.810
And I was just like,
what the fuck happened?
Tell you what happened.
Five minutes.

189
00:11:07.811 --> 00:11:10.750
It's fucking goals is what happened.
I've yet to see the highlights of that.
But,

190
00:11:10.751 --> 00:11:13.930
um,
I'm recording my podcast right now and I'm getting,

191
00:11:13.931 --> 00:11:15.310
then I got to go over to the writer's room here,

192
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:19.450
working on episode three written by yours truly for next season.

193
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:24.250
Who hypes a cartoon fucking 13 months before it comes out this guy.

194
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.670
Um,
and then I'm going to be a,

195
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.450
I'm taping the blues game so I'm not going to be on Twitter or any of that shit

196
00:11:31.451 --> 00:11:35.710
just in case you guys,
uh,
you know,
semi scores and shit,
but I'm going to,

197
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.210
I can't wait to fucking watch that game.
It's going to be great either way.

198
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.570
I want to see St Louis Win,
but uh,

199
00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:48.660
you just have to respect the fucking greatness of the Chicago Blackhawks during

200
00:11:48.881 --> 00:11:52.390
this era.
If they come back from this.
I mean,
it's just,
you know,

201
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.860
it goes beyond in I,
you got to have guys like that guy said,
have one fucking,

202
00:11:57.861 --> 00:12:01.960
what do they went to already?
Two or three,
two,
I think they should.

203
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:05.500
And they still want to win more.
Very rare.
It's very rare.

204
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.520
Most of the times the guy wins one,
he's done,
you know,

205
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.550
or he wins three.
And he just says,
fuck.

206
00:12:11.551 --> 00:12:13.840
And he keeps eating until his belt buckle bursts.

207
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.790
That's what usually fucking happens with superstars.
Um,
so anyways,

208
00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:20.210
I can't wait to see that.
And then,
uh,

209
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.660
the game game five of the Celtics is tomorrow night,

210
00:12:22.661 --> 00:12:27.370
so I'll be taping both of those.
Um,
this is such a fucking great time of year.

211
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:34.160
So a little bit of advertising a Sherry's berries are right.
Uh,

212
00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.950
there's no,
there's no one quite like mom.
All right.
That started creepy.

213
00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:43.210
Every mom is unique and we wouldn't want to change a thing to talk about your

214
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:47.920
mom or your wife's quirks.
Why do they fucking do that?

215
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.740
No,
I'm not going to.

217

Done that Tom Brady ship.
Before I got into this,

218
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.960
I'm going to be in a mood.
All right?
And with mother's Day,

219
00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:04.410
just around the corner,
I have a gripe.

220
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:09.610
I have a great way to show to show mom how much you appreciate her.

221

second.

258
00:15:18.541 --> 00:15:22.300
got out and this guy got out of the jeep crying going,

I hit him,

259
00:15:22.301 --> 00:15:27.080

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.960
oh by the way,
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking week.
Huh?
With a prince dying,

283
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:58.190
Mike God watching all those,
uh,
those clips of him

284
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.480
just lit it.
You know what?
I never fucking saw him in concert.

285
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:05.450
He came out here and did like 20 shows,

286
00:17:05.451 --> 00:17:09.500
sold out at the,
uh,
the La Forum.

287
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.380
I remember Neil went and I was just,

288
00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:14.840
I forget what the fuck I was just on the road.

289
00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:16.960
<v 3>Okay.</v>

290
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.770
<v 0>It was like the first couple of nights I had gigs still out here and then I
left,</v>

291
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.781
you know,

292
00:17:22.781 --> 00:17:26.710
for like did a like a 10 day run and he knocked out all those shows us some shit

293
00:17:26.711 --> 00:17:28.360
and I came back and I remember thinking,
ah,
you know,

294
00:17:28.361 --> 00:17:32.770
and I'll catch him on the next one.
And unfortunately that's not how life works.

295
00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.400
And um,
I get to tell you though,
like

296
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.250
the level that that guy affected people,
I mean,

297
00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:45.170
they literally lit up the Eiffel Tower in purple.
I mean,
as far as an artist,

298
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:48.890
that's about us.
It's about as big as honor as you get all these

299
00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.530
like monuments around the world getting lit up and purple man.
I had like,

300
00:17:54.531 --> 00:17:57.710
I knew that we loved him here.
I had no idea.

301
00:17:57.711 --> 00:18:01.240
Like the level of fame that that guy had.
Man.
It's fucking crazy.
So

302
00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.243
<v 6>mmm.</v>

303
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:09.000
<v 0>57,
Jesus Christ.
I'm 48.
That's all I was thinking like,
good Lord.</v>

304
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.350
I've got to lay off the sauce.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

305
00:18:13.351 --> 00:18:17.750
I want to thank everybody came out to all my,
uh,
my shows this,
uh,

306
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.250
this past weekend,
um,

307
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.890
had a great fucking time play one of the most beautiful theaters I've ever

308
00:18:22.891 --> 00:18:27.891
played to play the Fox theater in Saint Louis and they take you upstairs and if

309
00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:30.180
you ever get a chance to take a tour of the place,

310
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:32.550
you have to see some of the signatures that are on the wall.

311
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.650
Please don't sign the fucking wall.

312
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.310
It's like fucking people did that next to like Stevie Ray Vaughan.

313
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:44.610
Like one of my pet peeves is when somebody fucking huge signs of wall and then

314
00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:49.410
all these fucking jerk offs,
right?
Like within the name.
You know what I mean?

315
00:18:49.411 --> 00:18:53.610
It's like you're nowhere near that guy.
Get the sign on the same fucking wall.

316
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.890
Um,
David Bowie was really cool.

317
00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:01.950
David Bowie actually sign next to his name,
but he just scribbled it.

318
00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.150
She can't even tell it.
So I'm a fucking hypocrite.
So I signed near his,
but a,

319
00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:10.140
what was so cool was the whole Stevie Ray David Bowie story from back in the day

320
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.190
when a Stevie ray went to,
was it the Monterey Jazz Festival?

321
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.870
And they got booed off stage and David Bowie was in the crowd,
but love Steve.

322
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:23.400
He's playing.
Um,
and afterwards came up to him and blah,
blah,
blah.

323
00:19:23.401 --> 00:19:25.710
That's how we ended up playing on his let's dance album.

324
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.830
And then he wanted Stevie to go out on tour with them and Stevie just wasn't

325
00:19:28.831 --> 00:19:30.900
feeling it.
He went to some of the rehearsals and just like,

326
00:19:30.901 --> 00:19:33.810
I can't fucking do this.
I want to go back to Texas and play in my trio.

327
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.080
Started all over again and then,
um,

328
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:41.440
became a giant on his own rather than being part of David's band.
And,
uh,

329
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.080
just the two of them,
just to be that close.
Like,
what was Jerry Lewis?

330
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.313
<v 6>MMM,</v>

331
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:54.650
<v 0>of course.
Now I'm,
I forget Sammy Davis Jr Tony Orlando.</v>

332
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.740
Just some,
a bunch of random shit too.
And all this shit from the 80s,

333
00:19:57.741 --> 00:20:01.490
like the Thompson twins,
all this crazy stuff in there.

334
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.720
Um,
and they really kept it well.
And Stevie signed it twice,

335
00:20:05.721 --> 00:20:10.430
once in 1987 and then another time,
um,

336
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:15.390
I think right before he died and like the instep tour and,
um,

337
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.890
I got there a little bit late,
so I didn't get a chance to see the theater,

338
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.780
like the actual theater where people were sitting,

339
00:20:20.781 --> 00:20:22.760
thank God until after I did the show.

340
00:20:22.761 --> 00:20:25.250
Cause that would have been a little intimidating.
I'm came out afterwards,

341
00:20:25.251 --> 00:20:29.150
it was fucking amazing and,
um,
had a great show.

342
00:20:29.151 --> 00:20:31.640
And then the next day I went to,
uh,

343
00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.060
went to Kansas City and played this sprint.

344
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.210
And,
um,

345
00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.620
I did a run with a Jay cat,

346
00:20:42.621 --> 00:20:47.250
a Predator and um,
we were going to,

347
00:20:47.251 --> 00:20:50.430
we wanted to get barbecue and we try to figure out where to go.
That's right.

348
00:20:50.431 --> 00:20:53.520
And they told us to go to that fucking Oklahoma Joe's or some shit.

349
00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.780
So we fucking pull up there and um,

350
00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.400
there's like a fucking two hour line outside the place.

351
00:21:02.401 --> 00:21:03.450
And I'm just sitting there like,

352
00:21:03.451 --> 00:21:06.900
there's no fucking way this is the line for this place.

353
00:21:06.901 --> 00:21:10.080
But the royals had a game.
So I guess it's like a family tradition out there.

354
00:21:10.081 --> 00:21:13.770
People just do that shit.
So we were like,
well fuck that place.

355
00:21:13.771 --> 00:21:18.360
So the next place I had on my list to maybe try out was this other place,
Q 39.

356
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.100
And um,

357
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.580
it's the best barbecue I've had since saws when I was in Alabama.
It was fucking,

358
00:21:25.581 --> 00:21:29.130
it was the best.
I will say it's the best brisket I ever had.

359
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:34.770
We both ordered a couple of combo plates.
So,
um,
you know,

360
00:21:34.771 --> 00:21:39.100
we ended up having to smoke chicken brisket ribs and

361
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:45.030
the fuck else was there.
Oh.
And of course pulled pork and it was fucking amazing.

362
00:21:45.031 --> 00:21:49.200
But I have to tell you,
dude,
right after that,
man,
I felt like I,
I've,

363
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.230
I just,
I'm too old to eat like that.
I mean,

364
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.390
I'll spare you the fucking details,
but my body was just like,
yeah,

365
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.140
you know,
you have a,
see somebody show up at a club and they're already drunk.

366
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.030
Like how quickly they get thrown back out into traffic.
Yeah.
That,

367
00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:04.950
that's what happened with me.

368
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.400
It was not a,
it was not a good thing.
Um,

369
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:17.300
was not a good thing at all.
So anyways,
uh,

370
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.650
but it was delicious and I didn't even eat that much.
Oh,
wait a minute.

371
00:22:21.651 --> 00:22:24.110
Now he did.
Then we got dessert too.
Yeah,
it was kind of a bad day.

372
00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.100
It was a bad thing,
but it was funny.

373
00:22:25.101 --> 00:22:28.700
I didn't eat shit for the rest of the fucking night,
but,
um,
I had a great time,

374
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.400
uh,
later on that night,
uh,
hung out with a bunch of friends.

375
00:22:31.401 --> 00:22:33.680
I've been going to Kansas City for a long time.
So,
uh,

376
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.190
at a buddy of mine out there who built my first website,

377
00:22:37.191 --> 00:22:39.410
him and his wife showed up.
So we were just hanging out,
having drinks,

378
00:22:39.411 --> 00:22:40.370
just having a great time.

379
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:45.440
And then the last day was I got to go up to Iowa and a ames,
Iowa,

380
00:22:45.441 --> 00:22:46.550
just north of de Moines.

381
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.640
And I finally went to that state during a sunny month and it was green and it

382
00:22:51.951 --> 00:22:55.100
was fucking beautiful.
And,
uh,

383
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:57.560
de Moines really underrated city.

384
00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.160
Fucking gorgeous river runs right through it and they got this beautiful two

385
00:23:01.161 --> 00:23:04.610
mile loop that you can walk around.
I wish I had time to do that.

386
00:23:04.611 --> 00:23:06.320
I forgot that that was there.
I had,
like I said,

387
00:23:06.321 --> 00:23:09.920
I hadn't been in Iowa since I played penguins and Cedar rapids,

388
00:23:09.921 --> 00:23:14.360
which I heard is no longer there because the river overflowed or some shit.
Um,

389
00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:17.240
but anyways,
just had a,
uh,

390
00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:22.520
had a great time up there and I gotta tell you that's the fucking place to own a

391
00:23:22.521 --> 00:23:25.100
Ferrari Iowa.

392
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.150
That is the fucking place placement because I,

393
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.010
you see people riding around on a motorcycle with no helmets on and shit.

394
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:34.910
That is the place to own a motorcycle that is the place to own a fucking super

395
00:23:34.911 --> 00:23:37.910
car.
That is the fucking place to own a gun.

396
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.100
You have to have a gun.

397
00:23:40.101 --> 00:23:43.430
These fucking at console live on the coast and they're all jammed in with
people.

398
00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.830
It makes sense that you don't want everybody having a gun.
All right.

399
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:51.570
But this is tipping point where the population becomes so fucking little that

400
00:23:51.571 --> 00:23:54.630
then you're kind of on your own out there.
All right?

401
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.350
So if you fucking weird ass neighbor shows up dressed like leathers,
face,

402
00:23:58.351 --> 00:24:02.220
I mean you're going to call the fucking cops by the time I was joking on stage,

403
00:24:02.221 --> 00:24:06.090
by the time they drive up your driveway,
like half your family is fucking dead.

404
00:24:06.091 --> 00:24:10.830
Their driveways,
I swear to God,
some of these,
some of these spreads are like,
uh,

405
00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.670
I dunno if they're like fucking,
they look like they're like,

406
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:21.290
like you could land a Goddamn DC 10 on the damn thing.
So,
um,

407
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.620
all right,
so here it is.
The big news,

408
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.650
the big news this week that I found when I got up right was a,

409
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.450
actually I didn't find it till I connect to deck,

410
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.070
flew from De Moines to Phoenix and then I connected,
um,
you know,

411
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.340
get my connecting flight and it was late and I looked at my Twitter and people

412
00:24:40.341 --> 00:24:43.040
started sending me all this shit about Tom Brady,
the suspension,

413
00:24:43.041 --> 00:24:45.860
somehow some hour came back.

414
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:51.230
It fucking blew my mind.
I was always under the impression that like either way,

415
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.650
once you appealed it,
that last thing was the final thing.

416
00:24:54.651 --> 00:24:58.610
I've never seen an appeal of an appeal.
Maybe there's been one.

417
00:24:58.611 --> 00:24:59.211
I just remember what,

418
00:24:59.211 --> 00:25:02.000
I remember when Al Davis wanted to move the Raiders and they're like,
no,

419
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:04.670
you can't do it.
And he goes,
well I'm fucking doing it anyways.

420
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.120
And then they had a court battle and he won and that was it.

421
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:12.920
The NFL just said fine.
Um,
maybe there was a bunch of appeals on that,

422
00:25:12.921 --> 00:25:16.340
but that one came out of nowhere.
And um,

423
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.733
I dunno man,

424
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.300
I don't want to sit here and fucking be a big baby about it or anything like

425
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:26.840
that,
but I did just really seems like it just went above and beyond.

426
00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.620
It's just really extra.
I don't,
I don't understand.

427
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.250
I don't get the fucking NFL.
I really don't.

428
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:38.570
I don't get why certain things,
you know,
your knock a woman out in an elevator,

429
00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:42.740
you get four games,
you get two games at first,
right.

430
00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:46.670
Then they bumped it up to four cause everybody bitched and then they like,
oh no,

431
00:25:46.671 --> 00:25:51.110
wait a minute.
Wait.
And we mean you're,
you're out of football for good.
You know,

432
00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:54.230
the subtext of that of course was now we're going to lose a bunch of fucking

433
00:25:54.231 --> 00:25:58.280
money from women and guys who remotely give a shit about women aren't going to

434
00:25:58.281 --> 00:26:02.750
buy our fucking jerseys and shit.
So now all of a sudden we give a shit.
Right?

435
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:08.300
Um,
so I just have to think that this really isn't a money thing.

436
00:26:08.301 --> 00:26:11.300
They actually lose money when Tom's not playing.

437
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.630
So I really think this is just personal.

438
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.120
The Patriots did something to piss off the fucking NFL.

439
00:26:19.121 --> 00:26:21.580
I know a lot of you guys who aren't patriots fans think I'm just trying to make

440
00:26:21.581 --> 00:26:24.850
up an excuse.
But the reality is,
is the NFL,

441
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.080
the only thing they give a fuck about is money.
All right?

442
00:26:29.081 --> 00:26:31.150
The way they handled all those concussions,

443
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.300
the way they finally did that bullshit payout,

444
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:39.700
the way they make money off of a raising cancer awareness by having pink

445
00:26:39.701 --> 00:26:44.080
jerseys,
not letting you know that only 3% of the or whatever goes to

446
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.490
<v 5>research and they pocket the other 97% the way whenever they put a camera on,</v>

447
00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:52.540
you know,
the servicemen and women that they hooked up,
you know,

448
00:26:52.541 --> 00:26:55.120
gave them free tickets,
give them a round of applause.

449
00:26:55.121 --> 00:26:58.570
And then they count that as a fucking commercial and they charge whatever branch

450
00:26:58.571 --> 00:27:01.630
of service those people are in.
You know,

451
00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.920
how filthy they are there and only give a fuck about money.
You know,

452
00:27:05.921 --> 00:27:07.450
Tom Brady's captain America,

453
00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:12.160
like the Patriots and not guy looks like a movie star and they make more money

454
00:27:12.161 --> 00:27:15.260
if he's in the game and you're talking about literally a cons,

455
00:27:15.261 --> 00:27:17.000
hairs worth of air.
They,

456
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:21.850
they appealed it and won and the NFL still was like,
no,
fuck you.

457
00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.410
Fuck you.
So,
um,
I,
it's just,

458
00:27:26.411 --> 00:27:28.960
it has to be personal because,

459
00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.470
and I don't want to name any fucking names here.
Okay.

460
00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:38.500
There's other guys just as big as him who had some really questionable fucking

461
00:27:38.501 --> 00:27:43.501
shit that went way beyond fucking air pressure in a ball.

462
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:47.950
All right.
And it was just like,
yeah,
whatever.

463
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:52.750
No biggie,
no blood,
no foul.
So,
um,
yeah,

464
00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.350
I think it's official at this point that as a patriots fan,

465
00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.440
I am not paranoid when I say the NFL fucking hates the Patriots and has it out

466
00:28:02.651 --> 00:28:06.810
for them because they're actually shooting themselves in the foot monetarily

467
00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:11.530
here over fucking air pressure over something that they lost in court and like a

468
00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:15.760
fucking year ago.
So,
um,
I dunno,

469
00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:17.970
I dunno what we did.
I would love to know behind that

470
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.610
<v 0>the scenes,
it's gotta be some Robert Kraft Shit,
I would think,</v>

471
00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:26.500
<v 5>you know,
I can't really think of anything else because,</v>

472
00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.770
<v 0>you know,
I'm trying to be honest here,
but like,
you know,</v>

473
00:28:29.771 --> 00:28:31.570
some of the other infractions,

474
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.350
<v 5>okay.</v>

475
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:34.550
<v 0>Without naming names,</v>

476
00:28:34.551 --> 00:28:39.140
I'm trying to be a class act here of certain things that went through the mail,

477
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.910
wink,
wink,
you know,
just shit like that and it's just nothing.

478
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:45.390
<v 5>No story.</v>

479
00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:49.060
<v 0>Um,
and not to mention,
you know,</v>

480
00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:52.150
the cults owner in his own fucking investigation,

481
00:28:52.151 --> 00:28:55.570
they found out that for their footballs were also under inflated.
So,

482
00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.070
<v 5>okay.</v>

483
00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.180
<v 0>Did you read talking about going on almost a year and a half ago that this</v>

484
00:29:00.181 --> 00:29:02.730
happened?
This shit's still fucking go.
And so,
I mean,
all right.

485
00:29:02.731 --> 00:29:06.090
The NFL hates us and know Tom Brady for four games.
I guess that's,
you know,

486
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.220
<v 5>whatever.
We're still going to win.</v>

487
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.260
What too good.
We're still going to fucking win.

488
00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:18.730
All you're going to do is just make bill Belicheck a better fucking coach and he

489
00:29:18.731 --> 00:29:20.530
already prepared for this last year,

490
00:29:20.531 --> 00:29:23.230
so when we get fucking Janeane Garofalo in there again,

491
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.050
I think he goes to and to,
I'm looking forward to it.
Um,

492
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.810
all right,
there you go.
There's all of that type of stuff.
Uh,

493
00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.710
what a fucking weekend I had,
man,
I,

494
00:29:33.711 --> 00:29:36.720
I can't tell you how much fun I had going out there and,
um,

495
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:42.760
uh,
doing those shows,
man,
and,
uh,
working on my act and all that is great.

496
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:47.750
I have like,
I have the best fucking life I could possibly have.
Uh,

497
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.970
right now I'm writing on this the exact fucking show I want to do with a bunch

498
00:29:51.971 --> 00:29:55.840
of hilarious people during the week and every other week I get to continue my

499
00:29:55.841 --> 00:30:00.460
dream doing standup comedy.
So,
um,
and I'm working towards taping another space,

500
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.890
spatial special later on this year.

501
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:08.130
And I'm also starting to get the audio together for hopefully a vinyl release

502
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:12.370
of,
uh,
my show at Madison Square Garden.

503
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.300
Obviously I want that one to come out after my standup special,
but uh,

504
00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.730
you know,
I'm hoping to do like a,

505
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.760
like I'm not going to say what I'm hoping to do with that vinyl album,
but a,

506
00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:25.360
it's going to be fucking cool if I do it right.
If I don't fuck it up.
All right.

507
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:30.070
So anyways,
here we go.
Let's read some questions here for the week.
A bill,

508
00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:33.850
when I travel out of town for games,
I bring the stick.

509
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:39.700
Oh,
this is about foam rollers.
Um,
cause dude,
I'm telling you,

510
00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:43.930
that foam roller changed my fucking life.
Any old people out there like me?

511
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.280
If you're young,
you should fucking do it.
It's the greatest God damn thing ever.

512
00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:51.820
There's nothing better than like I,
you know,

513
00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:54.830
other than eating right in that type of stuff,
um,

514
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.810
finding love and not having your quarterback suspended for four games over some

515
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.680
country air pressure,
there's nothing better than,
um,

516
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:09.250
than it just being able to move your fucking body and stretching is the best

517
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:11.470
really.
Yoga,
pilates,

518
00:31:11.471 --> 00:31:16.471
all of that shit is probably the best shit you can do because it really keeps

519
00:31:16.781 --> 00:31:19.780
you in shape.
It really keeps you flexible without hurting yourself.

520
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.450
I can't help it.
I'm a child of the 80s,

521
00:31:22.451 --> 00:31:27.190
so I'll always have that world Jim gold gym.
Push it up,
don't pay it.
Okay.

522
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.610
I always have to fucking,
you know,
do it.
What do,
what do you benching?

523
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.290
What are you benching their kid?
I always had this always going to be in B.
Um,

524
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.410
but anyways,
these foam rollers,
I'm telling you that if they're the shit,
so,

525
00:31:38.411 --> 00:31:40.750
but I never heard of this.
This kid's recommending the stick.

526
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.720
Doesn't sound like a paid advertisement.
It isn't.
He said,

527
00:31:43.721 --> 00:31:46.030
I can fit it in my carry on you.

528
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:48.340
It'd be great as if this kid invented it and he's actually getting a free

529
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:53.260
commercial.
He said,
I can fit it in my carry on or in my gear bag.

530
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:54.940
Um,

531
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:59.590
so it travels a lot better than any foam roller and it's a lot easier to do just

532
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:04.270
sitting in a chair and not having to roll around on the floor.
You might like it.

533
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:09.250
Uh,
it's what keeps me functional when I have three of four hurling games,

534
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.590
crazy ancient Irish sport to play in a day at a tournament.
Well,
wait a minute,

535
00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.760
wait a minute.
Wait.
I gotta look this up.
You know,
if it's an Irish sport,

536
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:21.460
you know,
two things,
you know,
it's fucking crazy and you know,

537
00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:25.120
there's nobody stretching hurling thing and show somebody puking.

538
00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:30.250
Okay.
It's an Irish game resembling field hockey.
All right.

539
00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:32.380
I'm not trying to start anything with Ireland,
but uh,

540
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:33.940
that's a woman's sport over here.

541
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.800
They run around wearing skirts and I know you guys don't do the kilt thing.

542
00:32:37.801 --> 00:32:40.230
So what the fuck is going on?
All right.

543
00:32:40.231 --> 00:32:43.380
Played with the shortest stick and a broader oval blade.

544
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:48.590
It's a national game of Ireland and may date back to the second millennium BC.

545
00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:52.890
All right,
so you're all forgiven.
You didn't know any better.
All right,

546
00:32:52.891 --> 00:32:57.600
let's see some images for this thing.
Oh fuck that.
That's not a,

547
00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:02.040
that's a club.
I would play that fucking game.

548
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.840
That is a fucking club.
Jesus Christ.

549
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.300
Look at those fucking helmets they wear.

550
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:14.810
It looked like fucking butch goring.

551
00:33:14.811 --> 00:33:17.450
And then somebody took a welding class for the first time ever.

552
00:33:17.451 --> 00:33:20.900
Butch Goring's hockey helmet.
Butch scorings hockey helmet.
By the way.

553
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:22.100
It is legendary.

554
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:26.300
He had the same piece of shit helmet I think for right up from the juniors.

555
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:31.160
And um,
he just paint every time he went to a new team,

556
00:33:31.161 --> 00:33:33.580
he would just paint it.
I remember he finished with the,
uh,

557
00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:37.550
did he finish with the Bruins?
I remember he played with us.
Oh,

558
00:33:37.551 --> 00:33:39.800
those were the days.
Oh,
those were the days Jesus Christ.

559
00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:44.220
Look at this guy taken one of those fucking paddles right to the face.
Um,

560
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:50.770
wow.
Okay.
I get shit faced and watch that.

561
00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:55.000
That is the weirdest looking thing I've ever seen.
It's like,

562
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:59.320
it looks like the beginning of a goalie stick and then you amputated it.
Right.

563
00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:04.300
Just beyond the heel,
about a third of the way up the blade.
Um,

564
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.910
all right,
so let's get,
you know what dude,
I really appreciate that.

565
00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:11.620
I'm going to check that out.
Um,
the stick good stuff.
Thank you.

566
00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:16.960
All right.
China by Billy boy.
I'm Iranian living in China.

567
00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.200
Jesus,
he goes,
yeah,
right.
Iranian.

568
00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.970
I think the only place that you might not have any fans is North Korea and

569
00:34:24.971 --> 00:34:29.440
that's only because they don't have access to the Internet.
Um,
anyways,

570
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:32.140
I have watched,
I'll,
speaking of which jade,

571
00:34:32.141 --> 00:34:36.400
who I worked with this week is Brazilian and she mentioned,
you know,

572
00:34:36.401 --> 00:34:39.460
she was thinking about maybe doing some standup down in Brazil and how that

573
00:34:39.461 --> 00:34:42.610
scene is starting to get going.
And I,
I was just wondering,

574
00:34:42.611 --> 00:34:47.540
anybody from Brazil listening and if you do,
if you have any suggestions,
um,

575
00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.350
cause I've always wanted to take my wife down there.

576
00:34:50.351 --> 00:34:54.130
She's always wanting to go and uh,
I'd love to go down there.

577
00:34:54.131 --> 00:34:57.130
I guess it's cold this time of year,
right?
My wife's not into the cold.

578
00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.960
I personally like it.
You know what I mean?
That's all good for me.
Um,

579
00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.880
I got no problem with that whatsoever,
but,
uh,

580
00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.370
let me know what's going on down there and I'm psyched you guys are getting some

581
00:35:06.371 --> 00:35:07.270
standup shit going.

582
00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:11.590
Cause I'd like to see your Chappelle's Louis C K s and David tells us what I'm

583
00:35:11.591 --> 00:35:14.050
looking forward to all these like India and all these places that are starting

584
00:35:14.051 --> 00:35:17.740
to get comedians.
I can't wait to see the grates that come out of those,
uh,

585
00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:21.940
those different cultures.
Um,
all right.
So anyways,
let me continue on here.

586
00:35:21.941 --> 00:35:22.301
Anyways,

587
00:35:22.301 --> 00:35:25.960
I've watched all your videos on Youtube and followed your podcast for more than

588
00:35:25.961 --> 00:35:29.260
six months.
Uh,
you are indeed a funny guy though.

589
00:35:29.261 --> 00:35:31.480
My Chinese wife does not get your jokes.

590
00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.730
Women around the world do not like my act.
I should charge her,

591
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.850
change her to one with better tastes.
I think he's given me shit.
There.
He goes.

592
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:48.840
I think you have so many fans here,
especially among ex patriots.
Well,

593
00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:51.690
if you're in Hong Kong,
yeah,
I did a show out there.
He goes,
uh,

594
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:54.350
I don't know if you've ever been in China,
but really hope,
uh,

595
00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:57.870
you get your ass here someday looking forward to hear back from you.

596
00:35:57.871 --> 00:36:02.730
Please fuck yourself every day in the morning before breakfast.
Um,

597
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.850
yeah,
I was in Hong Kong last year.
I'd never been to the mainland,

598
00:36:05.851 --> 00:36:09.000
but I heard when you go to the mainland,
it's just straight Chinese,

599
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:12.120
you know what I mean?
Like all the expatriates seemed to be in Hong Kong,

600
00:36:12.121 --> 00:36:14.430
so I would go to mainland China,

601
00:36:14.431 --> 00:36:19.431
but I just feel like other than seeing the Great Wall and eating some delicious

602
00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:19.951
food,

603
00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:22.800
I don't think I could do a show up there cause I didn't want to be worried that

604
00:36:22.801 --> 00:36:25.890
not enough people would be able to understand what I'm saying and even if they

605
00:36:25.891 --> 00:36:29.700
could understand it,
I think maybe I just,
I dunno,

606
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.070
I think they'd be like your wife.
Like I don't get what he's talking about.
Um,

607
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.480
anyways.
Okay.
Continuing on Hillary hot sauce,

608
00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:45.180
old hot sauce.
Hillary.
Um,
you know,
Billy,

609
00:36:45.181 --> 00:36:48.810
listen to your Thursday podcast in the bit about Hillary and the hot sauce is

610
00:36:48.811 --> 00:36:50.830
actually true.
Um,

611
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:55.170
there are interviews with her talking about this over a decade or so.

612
00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:59.010
Apparently in the 90s she learned how healthy it was,
dede hot peppers.

613
00:36:59.011 --> 00:37:00.960
And so she did and she grew to love hot sauce.

614
00:37:00.961 --> 00:37:04.050
It's also known that she kept a lot of hot sauces at the White House where she

615
00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:06.870
lived.
Anyways,
for some reason I felt bad for her,

616
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.000
so I thought I'd write you well,
here's the fucking thing.
You know what?

617
00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:14.730
You know what I like?
I like fried chicken.
Okay.

618
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:18.870
I would never bring that up if I was talking to a bunch of black people trying

619
00:37:18.871 --> 00:37:22.710
to get their votes,
you know what I mean?
Even if she is into it,

620
00:37:22.711 --> 00:37:27.390
which you just say she is fine,
it's still a fuck.
It was,
it was just tacky.

621
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:31.620
A hot sauce.
I always had it,
you know,
it wasn't lipstick.

622
00:37:31.621 --> 00:37:36.360
It wasn't anything like that.
All the other bullshit that she has.
Um,
yeah,

623
00:37:36.361 --> 00:37:38.360
I just don't buy it.
And um,

624
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:42.450
I just think they're lying sacks of shit and I've had 20 years experience

625
00:37:42.451 --> 00:37:43.680
watching them on TV.

626
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.560
I lived in New York when she was a center there at center there.

627
00:37:46.561 --> 00:37:49.710
I watched Bill Clinton for eight fucking years.
I can't stand them.

628
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.020
I think they'll literally fucking say anything.

629
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:56.010
I think they're bought and paid for it.
They are the fucking devil.
Not Literally,

630
00:37:56.011 --> 00:37:59.310
they're evil,
but they're just the same evil that you're dealing with.

631
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.370
And it doesn't make a difference that she's black and she's got a dick or a

632
00:38:02.371 --> 00:38:05.640
vagina.
It's going to be more of the same if you pick her.

633
00:38:05.641 --> 00:38:08.580
And I think that's why you have to fucking extreme people.

634
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.090
I think people are sick of that.
And that's why Bernie still in it.

635
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.030
And Trump is still in it because I think generally speaking,

636
00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:17.490
people know that whatever the fuck we're doing,
it's not working.

637
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.630
It's not fucking working.
So,
and maybe it's not,
maybe nobody can fix it.

638
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.640
You know what I mean?
You've got fucking,
what,
a four,

639
00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:27.660
500 million people you can get to all the go get them all to try to tug the rope

640
00:38:27.661 --> 00:38:31.950
in the same direction.
I mean,
that's,
it's a very difficult thing to do it.
Uh,

641
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.200
I don't know.
I just wish the election was tomorrow.

642
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:36.230
We could just get it over with.

643
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:41.230
I saw this funny sign on the Internet and he said 2016 everybody sucks.

644
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:46.520
Or something like that.
Something about all the candidates.
Nobody isn't,

645
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:49.000
I don't know.
I butchered it.
I have to do,
you know what I want to make up for me?

646
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:52.630
Just butcher in that thing.
I might have to put the,
uh,
the picture of it,

647
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:57.230
which I probably won't be able to find,
so I think I'll just have to take it,
um,

648
00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.170
that I fucked that up.
All right,

649
00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:02.170
let's read the last two were advertising's here advertisements.

650
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:06.550
Advertising's Sherry's berries.
What the fuck are they?
God Damn it.

651
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:08.830
<v 6>All right.
Here we go.</v>

652
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.240
<v 5>Oh,
I should probably make a prediction here,
right?</v>

653
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.033
<v 6>MMM.</v>

654
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:18.830
<v 5>I don't know how to,
you don't,
I'd have no prediction for game seven.</v>

655
00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.780
I want the blues to win.

656
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.823
<v 6>MMM.</v>

657
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:29.380
<v 5>Fuck.
You know what?
Fuck it.
You know what?</v>

658
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:30.880
I'm not gonna say anything.
Cause at this point,

659
00:39:30.881 --> 00:39:33.310
blues fans are gonna hate me if I fucking predict them again.

660
00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:38.140
You know people get all fucking with that Mojo Shit.
You're going to jinx him.

661
00:39:38.141 --> 00:39:41.470
Fuck it.
I'm just going to watch the game.
All right.

millions of others.

00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:10.360
One reason is because they deliver amazing razors right to your door for a third

671
00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:13.160
of the price of what the greedy razor corporations charge that.

Another reason is their doctor candidates,
e Shea butter.

677
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.650
Using it with the executive razor,

678
00:40:29.651 --> 00:40:32.800
it makes the blade glide gently for the smoothest shave ever.

679

I saw Marin posted a picture.

702
00:41:48.991 --> 00:41:49.681
It looked delicious.

Brothy Yuzu cod was soba noodles locked in?

spice chick pea burgers.
I'm gonna start crying here with fat Ovid.

Click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in Burp.

719
00:42:46.201 --> 00:42:50.820
I hope that's what I was supposed to say.
Um,
Jesus Christ,

720
00:42:50.821 --> 00:42:53.130
they'd like typed the whole fucking menu.

721
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.100
<v 7>Okay.</v>

722
00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:59.900
<v 5>I was introduced in the fucking Wu Tang.
Um,
all right.
Gash,</v>

723
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:04.080
cash and banking.
I listened to your podcast today and about about money.

724
00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:07.650
How is just a number while relating to paychecks?

725
00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.590
I couldn't agree more.
Um,

726
00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:14.400
that they are intentionally phasing out cash period.
Every payday.

727
00:43:14.401 --> 00:43:18.180
I go to the bank and I take out all of my cash except what is needed to cover my

728
00:43:18.181 --> 00:43:22.560
bills and the bank.
People look at me like I'm an idiot on a regular basis.

729
00:43:22.561 --> 00:43:26.400
I walk out of there with seven to eight grand in cash at least once or twice a

730
00:43:26.401 --> 00:43:30.630
month and they actually interrogate me about why I'm taking all my money out of

731
00:43:30.631 --> 00:43:33.480
the bank and how come I don't need my money in the bank?

732
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.740
All my friends think I'm a conspiracy theorist because I buy silver by the pound

733
00:43:37.741 --> 00:43:41.100
and other precious metals.
Dude,
you need to shut up.

734
00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.070
Stop telling your friends that you do this shit.
You're,

735
00:43:44.071 --> 00:43:47.580
you're opening yourself up to get robbed.
All right.

736
00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:50.850
Just act like you just taken everything down to the fucking bank.

737
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:53.220
Why are you telling me this?
All right.

738
00:43:53.221 --> 00:43:55.460
All my friends think I'm a conspirator that by silver I got,

739
00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.910
I refuse to keep money in the bank and if we ever go into a great depression of

740
00:43:58.911 --> 00:43:59.820
the government collapses,

741
00:43:59.821 --> 00:44:03.990
they're going to seize everybody's money in the bank accounts guaranteed.

742
00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.140
Uh,
so I'll keep all my cash hidden at home,

743
00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:11.640
which if the currency crashes really in the end it doesn't do me any good

744
00:44:11.641 --> 00:44:12.900
because it won't be worth shit.

745
00:44:12.901 --> 00:44:16.290
But I don't like the government to know how much money I have in any given

746
00:44:16.291 --> 00:44:18.810
moment.
I think it's a good practice.
So yeah,

747
00:44:18.811 --> 00:44:21.810
I think people should take their money out of the bank.
Every payday,

748
00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.660
actual physical money and dollar bills.

749
00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:28.290
Plus when I had the cash in my hand and I run out of it,

750
00:44:28.291 --> 00:44:32.370
there's no way I can spend more than I have.
I also believe in credit cards.

751
00:44:32.371 --> 00:44:35.040
Everything I bought was with cash,
even cars,

752
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.440
$30,000 cars bought with cash.

753
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:42.120
It may throw up a few red flags but fuck them.
No it doesn't,
not if you're,

754
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:45.810
you know,
not if you're,
if you're paying taxes on all,

755
00:44:45.811 --> 00:44:50.550
once you deposit it in the bank,
there's a record of it.
And um,

756
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.730
I think the banks want to know what you're doing with it.

757
00:44:53.731 --> 00:44:55.950
They always want to know what you're doing with your money cause they want to

758
00:44:55.951 --> 00:44:57.120
make money off your money.

759
00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:02.930
So what you do every week by giving them money is you give them an interest free

760
00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:07.560
loan on their money.
I guess they give you a couple of points interest.
Um,

761
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.110
they provide the service of keeping your money safe,

762
00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:13.620
allegedly even though there a bunch of crooks and then they load loan it out to

763
00:45:13.621 --> 00:45:17.580
your fellow countrymen.
It super high rates and you know,

764
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.720
this is nothing to,
if you put seven,
eight grand in there,
they can loan seven,

765
00:45:21.721 --> 00:45:26.100
8,000 big and 100% loan out all that money.
Like,

766
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.510
I dunno,
like times three or some,
some shit.
It's crazy.
Back in the day,

767
00:45:30.511 --> 00:45:35.190
like when you ran a bank responsibly,
what it safe,
he had 10 grand in the bank.

768
00:45:35.191 --> 00:45:38.220
You could only loan out like there was a certain percentage,

769
00:45:38.221 --> 00:45:41.280
you couldn't go past like 30%.

770
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:46.100
I can't remember what it was,
but you know,
so the money was still there and they,

771
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:50.610
the bankers through paying off politicians kept getting that money,
that number,

772
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.090
that percentage,
um,
bumped up and up and up and up.

773
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:56.970
And they kept getting more and more deregulated,
more and more deregulated.

774
00:45:56.971 --> 00:45:59.820
Now when you put the money in,
they can loan it,
you put a thousand in,

775
00:45:59.821 --> 00:46:03.390
they can loan,
they can loan out.
Not only a hundred percent of that thousand,

776
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.600
they can loan like another $3,000 off of that thousand thousand for you,

777
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:12.750
you,
you when you,
um,
so they basically counterfeited length three grant.

778
00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:14.280
As far as the shit that I've read,

779
00:46:14.281 --> 00:46:15.900
and I haven't looked that stuff up for a while.

780
00:46:15.901 --> 00:46:20.430
Things might've changed after 2008.
But it's a,
it's a pretty shady thing.

781
00:46:20.431 --> 00:46:21.211
But I will tell you,

782
00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:26.040
I don't feel comfortable having a bunch of cash in the fucking house,
you know?

783
00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:30.960
Uh,
I always hear the first 48 playing in my head.
So,
you know,

784
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.060
good luck to you.
You know what I did after a while?

785
00:46:33.061 --> 00:46:35.790
I just tapped out of conspiracy theory.
I got a fucking dog.

786
00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:39.150
I watched sports and I just,
I,
I'm just,

787
00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.740
I take comfort knowing that it can only die once.
That's what I do.
All right?

788
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:47.550
Okay.
Oh,
Jesus.
Another fucking hair loss thing.
It's just to me.

789
00:46:47.551 --> 00:46:51.480
Another guy asked me,
should he shaved my head?
Should I not shave my head?

790
00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:56.070
She like glue something on there.
Hey.
Oh,
flowers for billion.

791
00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:59.850
Uh,
I'll keep it short.
Parentheses and thinning.

792
00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.160
I've been losing my hair for the past couple of years.

793
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:06.000
It's thinning at the top and has been doing so for six years.

794
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:11.370
Um,
I know you've gone through the same predicament.
Aww.
You're very perceptive.

795
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:14.700
I'm going to go out on a limb.
I think.
I know.

796
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.920
I think you know what I'm talking about here.
He goes,
I am.

797
00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:21.450
I know it shouldn't matter.
And should,
I should probably just shave it.

798
00:47:21.451 --> 00:47:24.120
But I love my hair.
My God.
Do I love my hair?

799
00:47:24.121 --> 00:47:26.900
I remember when I used to get my hair cut every Barbara's stylists,

800
00:47:26.901 --> 00:47:31.400
this stylist I went to said how it was so thick and I would never have to worry

801
00:47:31.401 --> 00:47:35.510
about going bald.
Those lying fucks.
So when it started thinning,
I,

802
00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:38.450
I like most guys started reading everything I could.

803
00:47:38.451 --> 00:47:41.630
I found out that most men have had success with Propecia.

804
00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:46.930
It's a one day a pill that you take 60% of men every growth while 30% keep what

805
00:47:48.171 --> 00:47:50.390
they have.
Um,

806
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:56.910
and what does that mean?
60% of regrowth in 30% of that 60%

807
00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.770
yeah.
I guess that that would be,
yeah,
that's obvious.
What that be.

808
00:48:00.771 --> 00:48:02.510
Keep what they have no.

809
00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:08.480
Or is that the other 30 60% keep what they have.
Oh,

810
00:48:08.481 --> 00:48:12.650
60% Jesus Christ bill have regrowth.
30% keep what they have.

811
00:48:12.651 --> 00:48:15.650
So now where are we up to 90% yeah,
I guess we would be,

812
00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:19.010
and it seems not to work for about 10% of men.

813
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:23.720
So it seems like a no brainer to at least try,
right.
Well,
for about 2% of men.

814
00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:28.130
All right dude,
you said 60,
30,
10 and now too,
we're up to 102% here.

815
00:48:28.131 --> 00:48:32.810
So there's some fucking overlap.
Um,
it makes their dick not work.

816
00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:37.830
They complain of a weaker to know erections.
Um,
since look up.

817
00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.310
Look sir,
this is fucking hilarious.
See,

818
00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.440
keep your hair to get the girls could come home and then your Dick doesn't work.

819
00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:46.250
Uh,
that's exactly why I don't fuck with that shit cause she can never have your

820
00:48:46.251 --> 00:48:46.851
cake and eat it.

821
00:48:46.851 --> 00:48:50.450
So I just feel like there's gotta be some sort of damage that it does.
I just,

822
00:48:50.451 --> 00:48:55.130
you know,
dude,
I'm 48 years old.
What am I going to join a boy band?

823
00:48:55.131 --> 00:48:58.910
It's fucking over.
Do you know,
I gotta be honest with you.

824
00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:04.280
If you don't fight aging,
it's pretty painless.
You know,
I go to the gym,
you know,

825
00:49:04.281 --> 00:49:07.340
I keep myself in good shape at all of that other shit.
These fucking,

826
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.030
this fucking woman was telling me this weekend that,
that out here in Hollywood,

827
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:13.820
you know,
approximately around the country.
I don't know they have,

828
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.510
this is the mode is the most disgusting thing as far as vanity,
I think I've,

829
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:21.860
I've heard in a long time,
do you know they have,
they have botox parties.

830
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:23.350
<v 2>Okay.</v>

831
00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:24.850
<v 5>Like they come over,
they drink drinks,</v>

832
00:49:24.851 --> 00:49:28.150
they watch a show or something like that and then you can go over and Kiki yet

833
00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:33.180
like that shit that makes you face look like the joker just shot into your face.

834
00:49:34.841 --> 00:49:37.900
Like this foreign chemical under your skin.

835
00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:39.230
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

836
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:43.250
<v 5>You know,
I guess it's your skull right there and it is protecting your brain.</v>

837
00:49:43.251 --> 00:49:47.450
But I just feel like somehow it's got a leak in there.
Right.

838
00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:51.650
Or it goes into your fucking bloodstream or something.

839
00:49:51.651 --> 00:49:53.030
Somehow it ends up in your brain.

840
00:49:53.031 --> 00:49:56.450
I just seen you just literally injecting chemicals into your fucking face.

841
00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:59.600
It's the amount of people that won't do heroin,

842
00:49:59.601 --> 00:50:01.900
but we'll put botox in their body.
It's just,
I dunno,

843
00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:05.090
I guess it's whatever the fuck you're into.
Um,

844
00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:07.080
<v 2>yeah,</v>

845
00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:11.250
<v 5>I dunno.
I like I said,
if he just,
except the fact,</v>

846
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:12.570
<v 2>okay,</v>

847
00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:13.530
<v 5>that,
you know,</v>

848
00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:17.790
you're no longer young and your dress your age,

849
00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:22.100
you know,
you,
you,
you don't look that you have to keep yourself in shape.
You,

850
00:50:22.101 --> 00:50:26.040
you look fine.
You know what I mean?
You don't look sexy.

851
00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:29.120
You're not attractive,
but you shouldn't be.

852
00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.850
You should have gotten all that out of your fucking system.

853
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:36.080
This whole fucking thing that you got,
like these,
these,
you know,

854
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:40.160
these broads on the fucking a real housewives walking around with their but

855
00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:43.780
dazzled jeans.
Like I like four kids and they're still fucking putting,

856
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:49.100
you know,
hooker jeans on.
It's like,
what are you doing?
You're a mom.

857
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.150
You know,
the husband's walking around with fucking tank tops on.

858
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:57.620
I just don't under is put on a sport coat.
He supposed to be adults.

859
00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:04.350
I Dunno.
I blamed Madonna.
Um,
no I don't.
She looks great.

860
00:51:04.351 --> 00:51:07.860
What am I talking about?
You know,
he goes,
well,
what the fuck?
What the fuck?

861
00:51:07.861 --> 00:51:12.630
Shut up.
It's still bagger.
All right,
Sudbury,
the ugliest place in Ontario,
Canada.

862
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:17.970
A dear Billy burr.
Please talk about your experience traveling through Sudbury.

863
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.890
I didn't think it was ugly.
I thought it was cool.

864
00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:24.210
Did you notice how there were no trees in the area above 10 feet tall or so?

865
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:29.430
Most of the vegetation in the area was destroyed by acid rain be caused by the

866
00:51:29.431 --> 00:51:33.900
massive,
um,
mining operations in and around Sudbury.

867
00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:38.280
Our stupid tourist attraction is the largest nickel in the world.
Luckily,

868
00:51:38.281 --> 00:51:42.540
they solved the population problem by building a gigantic smokestack.

869
00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:48.780
Currently the second largest freestanding Shim the in the world to spread the

870
00:51:48.781 --> 00:51:53.400
pollution out over a larger area.
Industry has been winding down.

871
00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.980
So now we have more unemployed,

872
00:51:55.981 --> 00:51:59.700
hardworking Canadian rednecks and ever great place.

873
00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:04.080
Can't wait to get anywhere else.
Uh,
it's fucking hilarious.

874
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:06.200
<v 3>Okay.</v>

875
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.000
<v 5>I have person may have a future as a writer.</v>

876
00:52:08.001 --> 00:52:11.960
Mancy I'll fucking Kuma works when you hate where you live.

877
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.950
I didn't hate where I live,

878
00:52:12.951 --> 00:52:17.090
but I mean there's just certain things I could fucking bring it out of you.
Um,

879
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:20.030
I had no idea.
I didn't know any,
I didn't think about that.

880
00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.630
I had a great time when I was up there.
And,
uh,
you know,

881
00:52:23.631 --> 00:52:27.110
I'm a nerd when it comes to traveling.
I like going to places I haven't been to.

882
00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:32.330
And at this point there's nothing I like doing better than not going to the

883
00:52:32.331 --> 00:52:34.820
major city.
Um,

884
00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:40.700
my bend all of them a thousand fucking times.
They're great.
But,
um,

885
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:46.250
I dunno,
I like going to,
I like going to the other places.
De Moines deadwood,

886
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:47.823
right.

887
00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:52.430
Is that when I went to when fucking Louisiana begins with an s,

888
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:57.710
I can't remember.
It wasn't New Orleans.
That doesn't begin with an s Schenectady.

889
00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:02.600
Shreveport.
Right.
That'll fucking know.
Anyways,
uh,

890
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:06.680
open relations.
Hi there,
Billy bald bags.

891
00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:11.270
Uh,
what the fuck is up with open relationships these days?

892
00:53:11.271 --> 00:53:14.330
I'm a 37 year old lady,

893
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:18.920
unexpectedly widow.
I'm sorry to hear that.
And after eight years,

894
00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:21.710
after eight years with my husband,
uh,

895
00:53:21.711 --> 00:53:24.830
I'm getting back out there in the dating world and have discovered a plus

896
00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:29.890
plethora of people who are in an open or polyamorous relationships.

897
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.630
<v 6>Okay.</v>

898
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:37.610
<v 5>I Dunno what polyamorous mates.
All right.
Open relationship means like,</v>

899
00:53:37.611 --> 00:53:40.760
yeah.
You know,
keep it clean.
I don't want to know about it.

900
00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:45.740
Uh,
don't make,
make sure it's nobody I know.

901
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:49.730
Polyamorous m or uh,

902
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:52.221
do do,
do,

903
00:53:52.221 --> 00:53:56.840
do is a practice or desire for intimate relationships evolving more than two

904
00:53:56.841 --> 00:53:58.700
people also they have threesomes together.

905
00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:00.563
<v 6>MMM.</v>

906
00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:05.710
<v 5>It's so fucking weird.
Does a couple like break down the game tape afterwards?</v>

907
00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:09.940
Like I just felt like you licked her pussy.
Let her be better than mine.
You know?

908
00:54:09.941 --> 00:54:13.320
Do you make like halftime adjustments when you switch and positions?
Yeah.

909
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:14.333
<v 6>MMM.</v>

910
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:19.270
<v 5>Open relationship.
Does it get me in trouble?</v>

911
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:23.830
Rules to be looking at this online.
This is my search engine.
Oh.
For relationship.

912
00:54:23.831 --> 00:54:27.450
Six rules of,
for doing the whole open relation thing,
right.

913
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:32.920
One,
don't do it too.
Don't do it.
All right.
Open relationship.
Alright.

914
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:37.700
Okay.
Here we go.
One,

915
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:42.390
understand what an open relationship actually is.
Uh,

916
00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:44.420
there's a lot of confusion,
confusion,

917
00:54:44.421 --> 00:54:47.420
confusion about what is and what isn't an open relationship.

918
00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:50.630
Some people who are in long distance relationships say they're in an open

919
00:54:50.631 --> 00:54:52.850
relationship.
They both hook up with whoever,

920
00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:57.200
but just don't talk about it by the word open connotes honesty.
RSC.

921
00:54:57.230 --> 00:55:00.080
They have to know about an open relationship and knowledge as a couples can have

922
00:55:00.081 --> 00:55:03.800
their needs met by other people.
If you're really okay with that,

923
00:55:03.801 --> 00:55:07.010
why keep it a secret?
All right.
Um,

924
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:10.700
it's actually a great point.
If you are okay with it,
it shouldn't bug you.

925
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:13.060
<v 4>Did you do today honey?</v>

926
00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:18.820
I had some chick blow me on the way home and I got a pizza.

927
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:23.760
<v 5>Oh,
that's great.
I take thunder games,
hunger games,</v>

928
00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:27.780
whatever the fuck they call funder games.
Um,
make sure you're doing it right,

929
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:29.400
doing it for the right reasons.

930
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:32.370
Are you interested in an open relationship just because you want to be with

931
00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:36.450
other people or is it that you're interested in physical experiences with other

932
00:55:36.451 --> 00:55:37.080
people,

933
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:40.380
but you want to stay committed to sharing your emotional and spiritual self with

934
00:55:40.381 --> 00:55:45.120
one's process where it gets complicated?
Set some boundaries.
No Anal.

935
00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:50.190
Every person,
every person's guidelines are different.

936
00:55:50.191 --> 00:55:53.790
But there are always things to think about before you enter into an open

937
00:55:53.791 --> 00:55:55.980
relationship.
Um,

938
00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:00.210
do you both need to be present in order for sex with other people to be okay?

939
00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:04.500
Can you be with one gender and not the other or certain sector acts off the

940
00:56:04.501 --> 00:56:08.460
table.
These are all important things.
Uh,

941
00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:11.520
this is just like the early days at USC.
All right.
No more eye gouging.

942
00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:15.810
You can't do that thing where the other guy puts the finger in your ass and then

943
00:56:15.811 --> 00:56:18.900
you go,
all right,
I give,
I give right.
That's actually a wrestling move.

944
00:56:18.901 --> 00:56:21.750
He can believe it.
Um,
anyone you hooked,
tell your other partners.

945
00:56:21.751 --> 00:56:24.840
Anyone you hook up with outside of relationship deserves to know the deal.

946
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:27.270
Try say something like,
I find you attractive,

947
00:56:27.271 --> 00:56:30.060
but you should know my partner and I are in an open relationship,

948
00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:34.920
so there's someone else in my life.
That way they can be fully informed.
Okay,

949
00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:39.660
keep it healthy.
If that's obvious.
Have regular checkups.

950
00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:43.620
There you go.
All right,
so now that I'm a little more fucking educated,

951
00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:47.640
what the fuck did that just say?
Oh,
60 turn ons for better sex.

952
00:56:47.641 --> 00:56:52.350
I thought it was the turn ons for over 60.
I think I am a little dyslexic.

953
00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:57.620
I'm all right.
So she says she's getting in there and everybody.
Okay,

954
00:56:57.621 --> 00:57:02.000
so there's a bunch of like husbands and wives looking to hookup with her or

955
00:57:02.001 --> 00:57:04.130
people who was saying that they're an open relationship.
She goes,

956
00:57:04.131 --> 00:57:04.941
I read this recently,

957
00:57:04.941 --> 00:57:08.530
started dating a great guy who lives with the mother of his kids and his

958
00:57:08.531 --> 00:57:11.210
supposedly sexless domestic partnership.

959
00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.270
We have a great connection and we enjoy each other's company,

960
00:57:14.271 --> 00:57:17.630
but he doesn't have a lot of extra chill time due to his family commitments.

961
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:22.820
I have kids too,
the same age as his even.
I keep telling him,

962
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:25.730
let's all hang out together,
but he is hesitant,

963
00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:30.760
which makes me question the openness of his open relationship or maybe he just

964
00:57:30.981 --> 00:57:34.700
wants to fuck you.
All right.
I keep telling us,
hang out together.
Okay.

965
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:39.140
I should have walked away sooner,
but he gives really good head.
Jesus Christ.

966
00:57:39.141 --> 00:57:41.330
I'm not ready for anything too serious.

967
00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.960
I just wish she had more time to spend with me socially.

968
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:49.130
This seems to be more and more common.
These I'm so cool and modern.

969
00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:52.280
I'm going to fuck you and then go home to my wife.
Hipsters.

970
00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:55.450
Should I keep seeing this guy?
Uh,
thanks for,

971
00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:59.210
and your insight in the form of Bostonian living in Hawaii.
I'm a huge fan.

972
00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:03.440
You keep me laughing through some hard times and I fucking love your old

973
00:58:03.441 --> 00:58:06.560
freckled face more.
Uh,
thank you.
Um,

974
00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:11.640
I would say a yeah,
I,
I dunno,

975
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:14.140
that's all fucking you look if you just want to fuck around.

976
00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:18.550
But like this guy obviously does,
he obviously doesn't want to do anything more.

977
00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:21.520
Even if he didn't have a,
wasn't with somebody else.

978
00:58:21.521 --> 00:58:22.900
If he doesn't want to hang out with you,

979
00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:25.090
then that means he just wants to be fuck buddies,

980
00:58:25.091 --> 00:58:27.310
which is totally cool if you know that that's the deal.

981
00:58:27.311 --> 00:58:30.880
If you're all right with that,
I would continue seeing him.
If you're not,

982
00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:34.120
I would move on.
And if you sick a meeting,
people like that,

983
00:58:34.121 --> 00:58:38.140
I'm sure there's men who,
um,
that didn't work.
I was gonna say,

984
00:58:38.141 --> 00:58:41.830
men who are sick of meeting women who are in an open relationship.
