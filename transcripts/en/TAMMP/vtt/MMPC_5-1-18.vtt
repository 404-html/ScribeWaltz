WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.973
Yeah.

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.930
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill Burn?</v>

3
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:06.680
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday.

4
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.780
Fuck in April 30th,

5
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.460
2018 what's going on?
How are you?
I'm,
I'm still sick.

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.290
Uh,
I just,
I've just,

7
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.770
every time I start to get healthy I travel again.

8
00:00:23.771 --> 00:00:28.450
So I actually had to reschedule a Gig,
something I've never,
I don't,

9
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.170
can't remember the last time I did that.
So,
um,

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.310
cause I just need to fucking stay home and uh,
I'm just having coughing fits.

11
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:40.100
I'm having an absolute fucking fit at night.

12
00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:42.410
Like my throat sounds like this.

13
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.020
I still got the sniffles and uh,
maybe I got a Bola,

14
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.830
<v 0>you know?
Um,</v>

15
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.930
<v 1>but I'm kind of hot,
right?
I cough a little bit during the day,</v>

16
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:59.430
but the second I lay down at night,
I also,

17
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.660
my throat gets all dry and I just have this cough.
It fit.

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.680
Now I'm saying this to you guys because all of you now without medical degrees

19
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.400
or now leaping to your feet and you know exactly what's wrong with me and what

20
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:13.950
the cure is.
And that's my favorite thing about being sick.

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.860
I like to not go to doctors.

22
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:21.810
I like to talk to people who have talked to doctors or went on web MD and then

23
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:25.950
they fucking diagnosed me.
So,
uh,
I just think I need to,

24
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:30.951
I need to shut it down for a couple of fucking days and a not do anything is

25
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.180
what I need to do it.
But I'm,
he avoid here am doing the fucking podcast.
Um,

26
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.570
I want to thank everybody that came out too in hot Lana

27
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.780
to the show at the Fox theater.
Um,

28
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.980
I know I sounded like shit,
but I think I had a good show.
Um,

29
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.010
and then the next day,
uh,

30
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.810
like an asshole rather than just being like,
Bill,
you sick,

31
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.830
you know,
don't do the plan.
Fun Event.

32
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.850
Just go home and sleep it off.
I couldn't lay off man.

33
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:10.851
I went to the Talladega super fucking speedway and I went to that Nascar race

34
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:16.680
out there man.
And uh,
just had a great,
great time.
Legendary,

35
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.080
legendary track.
That's where they always have the big one,

36
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.590
but big ones come,
you don't know when it's coming.
All you know,

37
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.660
all you really know is that it's common.
The big one is just they can drive.

38
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:33.150
So God damn fast there,
that event,
you know,

39
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:34.920
and then right on each other's bumpers.

40
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.980
Eventually all it takes is somebody to do a little Shimmy,
Shimmy,
sham,
Shimmy,

41
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:44.490
Shimmy,
shake,
whatever the fuck it is.
Shake and bake.
Choking on my own.

42
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:48.630
Spit right.
Do a little Ricky Bobby shit,
little Brewster baker,

43
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.840
little a stroke or race.
Trying to think of all the stock car movies I saw.

44
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.573
<v 0>MMM.</v>

45
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.570
<v 1>Breathe in too many fumes.
Um,</v>

46
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.720
and then they just have like a giant fucking uh,
crash there.

47
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.420
So you know the deal
it was Tony Stewart said,

48
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.160
we come,
we come there for the accidents.
I don't want to see anybody die,

49
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:22.870
but I want to see shit fly through the fucking air.
So we were in the suite,

50
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.680
then we watched like the first couple of legs of the race and then it was just

51
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.380
like,
dude,
I want to go outside and I want to fucking,
you know,

52
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.780
I want to hear the cars and all that shit.
So we went he upper deck,

53
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:35.501
which is the shit,

54
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:37.660
cause you can see the whole God damn track and then we will like,

55
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:41.470
let's go down low because it was more seats and we went down there and it's that

56
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:45.430
whole thing is like 40 fucking cars go by it like you know,
180,

57
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:49.090
190 200 miles an hour and all you thinking as if if they got,

58
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:51.760
if they have the big one right,

59
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.640
not right in front of me because by the time everything you know settles,

60
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:57.550
it's going to be fucking two miles down on me a quarter mile down the fucking

61
00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:59.680
track.
It's like if it happens right before me,

62
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.540
there is a chance I could take a lug lug nut to the side of my head and uh,

63
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:09.190
I'll be fucking dead,
you know.
But uh,

64
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.450
it is amazing.
I got to tell you in the people down there,
we'll fucking great.
Um,

65
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.860
I've always been a fan of fucking Alabama.
It's a beautiful God damn state,

66
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:22.210
but I will,
I will tell you this,
not to get negative and shit,
just in general.

67
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.350
Uh,

68
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.120
there is a level of fucking poverty that you just cannot fucking,

69
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:32.830
but like some of the people,
some,
I just find them a long time ago,

70
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:35.800
Patrice O'neil told me this,
it was fucking hilarious.
He said,
you know,

71
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:39.760
some bill egos,
black people,
we are good at being broke.

72
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.690
And I go,
he talking about,
he goes,
look at us.
He goes,
we had,

73
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.090
we had the cleanest motherfuckers on the earth.

74
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.840
You wouldn't know that we're broke even if we are broke.

75
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.080
But I'll tell you something about white people when a white person is broke,

76
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:57.880
you fucking know it.
And uh,
that's what I was thinking about as I always do.

77
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:02.290
I always think of shit that he said and I just was looking at these fucking

78
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:04.680
people meant something.
Not all of them,
but just so was,

79
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.290
there's been a few when I've been traveling,

80
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.930
there's been a few times where I've seen little kids and I've had the urge to

81
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:18.070
rescue them.
You know,
by the time you look at the adults you like,

82
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:21.850
it's too late for him.
You know,
I've seen that in inner cities.

83
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.200
I sign in India and I saw it in Alabama.
Talladega,

84
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.060
not everybody.
I'm not saying everybody,

85
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.850
but there was definitely some fucking people.
I was like,
that kid,

86
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.340
if you get them out of this environment,
he has,
he's got fucking hope.
Um,

87
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.570
Jesus Christ.
I,
Oh,

88
00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:41.470
you know something when you hear that shit white privilege and stuff,

89
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.890
you can say that to me.
But I always want,
like,
after going to that race,

90
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:48.820
I was wondering what those people think.
You know,
cause the,

91
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:51.850
the bus definitely skipped this stop.
Um,

92
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.320
and I'm not talking down on these people because I fucking hate how people up

93
00:05:56.321 --> 00:06:00.170
north and people,
the coasts and everything.
They got this fucking attitude.
Like,

94
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.470
you know,
if she white and you're broke,
it's cause you had dump.

95
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.390
Um,
and that's just ignorant because you haven't fucking traveled.
But,
uh,

96
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.420
having said that,

97
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:16.160
there was a disturbing amount of confederate flags that I saw,
but like,

98
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:19.610
I dunno,
I dunno.
I don't,
I don't,
I don't,

99
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.120
I don't get that aspect of it,
but the other shit I'm just talking about.

100
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:27.050
She coming out of the side of your fucking sneakers.
Um,

101
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.170
I dunno.
It was,
it was,
it was,
it was interesting.

102
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.220
It definitely,
as a fellow American,
I was like,
you know,

103
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.410
we probably should be doing something about this.

104
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.950
Can we try to help these fucking people out now?

105
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:45.620
I know Trump said he was going to do what he was gonna make it great again.

106
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:48.070
And I can tell you right now that I didn't see a lot of greatness there.

107
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.140
Oh Shit.
Why did,
why do I talk about things?

108
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.980
Why do I see things and then talk about things.
You know what?

109
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.580
Cause that's what I do.
I didn't talk to,
you know,

110
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.120
I actually talked to a lot of people when I was there.
I had a good time,

111
00:07:04.121 --> 00:07:06.850
but there was definitely a few people that just had to take pictures of,

112
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.960
you know,
but I'm not going to post them just because,
you know,
I don't want you,

113
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.680
I don't want to further ready sort of fucking stereotypes.

114
00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:17.200
And the people in Nascar treated be great,
but there's definitely,

115
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.380
I saw this fucking guy he had on,

116
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.840
uh,

117
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.840
overall shorts because the only way to describe it it Larry Bird short shorts

118
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.140
and the whole thing was the American flag and cowboy boots with no shirt

119
00:07:35.111 --> 00:07:38.710
underneath it,
shaved head and sunglasses.

120
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.510
You know,
he looked like Rob Halford on the 4th of July,

121
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.840
does the only way to describe it.
Um,

122
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.790
and he was standing next to a guy,

123
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.180
it just fucking bare feet look alike.

124
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.630
He walked out of a coal mine and uh,

125
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.780
it was fucking just some old school shit and people just smoking like chimneys,

126
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:15.340
like a lot of people smoking down there.
And it reminded me of when I was a kid,

127
00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:19.920
like the level that people were smoking.
But having said that,
um,

128
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.250
it was also a bunch of other people that look fine.
I'm just saying,

129
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.430
but there was definitely some people you just like,
God damn,

130
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.890
that guy's fucking broke,
you know,
um,

131
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.930
how are you Hawaiian?
And you're that broke.
What they're saying out there is,

132
00:08:37.931 --> 00:08:42.790
that's not supposed to happen.
You're supposed to just fucking wake up,
you know,

133
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:43.410
did every,

134
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:48.410
all the doors are supposed to swing open for you with your Hawaiian privilege?

135
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.760
Um,
well that happened for me.
People,

136
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.070
it did not happen for those people.
You know,
I,
you know what,

137
00:08:55.071 --> 00:08:57.380
I think a lot of it goes back to,
I think it goes back to the civil war.

138
00:08:57.381 --> 00:09:00.680
When you lose a fucking war,
like that dead,
the repercussions of that,

139
00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:04.060
you deal with that for a long fucking time.
And uh,

140
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.041
you know,

141
00:09:06.041 --> 00:09:10.870
I knew some people that relocated from the north down to the south back in the

142
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.900
80s.
Some friends of mine,
their parents moved or whatever,

143
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:15.330
and I just remember them calling me up and they're going,
dude,

144
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.200
I'm learning shit in school right now that I learned fucking two years ago up

145
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:20.034
north.
Right.

146
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.160
<v 0>Okay,</v>

147
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.010
<v 1>this is fucking ridiculous.
There's no fucking reason for that.</v>

148
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.840
There is no reason for that.
Um,
so I don't know,

149
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.920
did I mention the race was fucking awesome?
Um,

150
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.890
I was just a little taken aback by shit like that.
You know,

151
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.170
you don't like to see that.
You don't like to see that anyway.
Right.

152
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.380
I don't like seeing people struggling,
you know,

153
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.130
not having the answers walking around and Jean shorts.

154
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.530
Um,
but anyways,
great fucking food at the track.
Jesus Christ.

155
00:09:50.531 --> 00:09:53.850
It was delicious food.
I had this barbecued fucking a something or other,

156
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:59.050
but the Cole slaw on it and everything was absolutely delicious.
And uh,

157
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.060
and I love the track,
legendary track.
And then I love the fucking,
the bleachers.

158
00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:07.780
It was just no frills,
no bullshit.
You know,

159
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.190
looked like an old football stadium.

160
00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:12.560
Whether it's just like we just build in fucking seats.

161
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:18.060
That's it.
No fucking Sushi stands and under that crap.
Um,

162
00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.220
it's definitely a good time.
I hope that didn't come off like a,
some,
a leader.

163
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:26.320
She Yankee thing.
Anyways,

164
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.340
plowing ahead now.
Now we're going to get into my elitist

165
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:34.770
attitude for the weekend.

166
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:38.860
And this is something that everybody's going to be like first world problem and

167
00:10:38.861 --> 00:10:42.910
all that.
I have a fucking problem with Delta Airlines.

168
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.290
All right?
These fucking assholes

169
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:50.910
for whatever reason,

170
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.110
they board first class and their premium select whatever they call them,

171
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:59.190
they're fucking medallion members at the same fucking time.

172
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.960
You know all these widgets,
salesman that fly every fucking weekend.

173
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:10.110
It's like I spent 20 years in the back of the fucking plane with the stress of

174
00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:12.160
the back of the plane.

175
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

176
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:13.971
<v 1>Like fuck,</v>

177
00:11:13.971 --> 00:11:18.440
I need to line up an hour before the flight so I get on early enough.

178
00:11:18.441 --> 00:11:21.950
So there's going to be a place for my fucking bag.
Okay.

179
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.980
And was this a DC 9:00 AM I is is the engine right outside my window and a

180
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.750
part's gonna fly off into my fucking head at my next to the bathroom.

181
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

182
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.190
<v 1>You're going to smell the piss and shit of the fuck at work in class.</v>

183
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.570
I spent 20 years in the back of that fucking plane and they kept us back there

184
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:45.690
and we didn't get on it till FirstClass got on and we were not allowed past that

185
00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.620
fucking curtain.
That was their fucking bathroom.
Okay.

186
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.990
I did every Goddamn Hell Gig.
I had shit thrown at me,
got booed.

187
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.520
I got fucked out of money and I moved up the row spot.

188
00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.350
<v 0>Baba Baba Baba.</v>

189
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.560
<v 1>Well,
I got up to the exit</v>

190
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.020
<v 0>Riley at that,
that,
that,
that,
that,
uh,</v>

191
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.970
<v 1>I got all the way up there.
Now I can finally afford</v>

192
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.350
<v 0>okay</v>

193
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.510
<v 1>to set up front.
Right.
And I don't give a fuck that day.</v>

194
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.770
Like anybody with a limp or a yeast infection.

195
00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.490
Anybody active military,
even if you never saw action,

196
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.550
even if all you do is counter grenades rather than fucking throw him,

197
00:12:22.551 --> 00:12:26.590
you can get on first.
I don't give a fee.
Got a stroller and a kid.
You're old in,

198
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:29.000
in a wheelchair and I'm a fucking problem with that.

199
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.640
These fucking assholes.

200
00:12:31.641 --> 00:12:36.641
They take all their frequent flyers and then these fucking fucking cunts.

201
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:41.180
All right.
They line up like a half hour before.
So I'm like,

202
00:12:41.181 --> 00:12:43.580
where's the first class line?
They go,
it's right here.
I look back,

203
00:12:43.581 --> 00:12:48.581
I'm like 40th in fucking line and now I've got the anxiety again.

204
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:50.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

205
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.520
<v 1>That's not,</v>

206
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:56.790
that is not FirstClass FirstClass as you walk on without a fucking care in the

207
00:12:57.131 --> 00:12:58.690
world,
that's what I paid for.

208
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.610
I walk on without a care in the world and you pretend that are better than the

209
00:13:03.611 --> 00:13:06.970
people behind me.
That is what I'm paying for.

210
00:13:06.971 --> 00:13:09.640
And that is not the experience you get on Delta Airlines.

211
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.470
All of these fucking people just fucking love.

212
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.510
Why can't you just bought first class in two seconds later I had those fucking

213
00:13:16.511 --> 00:13:21.070
premium cuts.
They line up like a half hour before.
Now I've got to stand up.

214
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.740
I don't even use frequent flyer.

215
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.670
I pay full price for the fucking ticket cause I can't figure out how to do the

216
00:13:27.671 --> 00:13:29.770
fucking,
I don't even want to figure it out.
We'll figure out,

217
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.880
you know how many fucking miles I have with you assholes?

218
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.720
What is the ticket price?
Hey,
you go the way a guy shops.

219
00:13:37.721 --> 00:13:41.710
I'm not waiting for the sale.
I need pants.
Those are pants.
What are they here?

220
00:13:41.711 --> 00:13:43.030
This is given to me.

221
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.140
So I fucking get on the plane and I get on a plane and all First Class fucking

222
00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:53.410
bids a take it.
I see one,

223
00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:58.411
one let's like fucking two rows behind me and I feel that that fucking anxiety,

224
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.440
that fucking anxiety that gave me the drive to get up to the front of the

225
00:14:04.661 --> 00:14:09.000
fucking plane
and then I'm sitting there,
right?

226
00:14:09.001 --> 00:14:11.520
I finally fucking sit out in all of this shit.
Right?

227
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.530
<v 0>And um,</v>

228
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:17.920
<v 1>I know you guys are like,
Bill quit your fucking whining.</v>

229
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.200
Fuck you is what I say?

230
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.493
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

231
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.920
<v 1>I'll say it again.
Fuck you.
All right.</v>

232
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.920
Don't call it fucking first class and don't charge me for first guy.

233
00:14:27.921 --> 00:14:31.880
Want a first class experience.
You know,

234
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.620
so many people sit in the back of the plane.

235
00:14:33.621 --> 00:14:36.890
Let's say you went on wheel of fortune and you solve the fucking puzzle.

236
00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:37.881
All right?

237
00:14:37.881 --> 00:14:40.910
And they said that they were going to give you a first class accommodations in

238
00:14:40.911 --> 00:14:43.370
Laughlin,
Nevada.
All right,

239
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:47.300
well if you came walking into the hotel and you didn't get to go to VIP Checkin,

240
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.700
you still does stand in line with all these flip flop wearing fucking overeaten

241
00:14:51.701 --> 00:14:52.930
jackasses.

242
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.733
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

243
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.390
<v 1>Is that the first class experience?
You know what I mean?</v>

244
00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.230
They treated me like a $3 whore.
You got a $3 whore,

245
00:15:02.231 --> 00:15:04.270
you're expecting a certain level of attitude,

246
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:08.890
but when you get a $1,200 to $2,000 fucking call girl,

247
00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:13.540
she supposed to pretend you're interesting and your stories are fascinating that

248
00:15:13.541 --> 00:15:15.310
you're paying for the experience.

249
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:21.010
I'm just letting you know that experience does not exist on Delta Airlines.

250
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:22.760
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

251
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.940
<v 1>you're going to get on the fucking plane with the first class seat that you</v>

252
00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:30.170
fucking paid for with 40 other fucking people in front of you with their neck

253
00:15:30.171 --> 00:15:35.171
braces and they're fucking and got all this a bonds they need because those poor

254
00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:38.210
bastards are still sitting in the back of the play.

255
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.010
<v 0>Okay,</v>

256
00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:42.210
<v 1>well I paid good money.</v>

257
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:49.130
I paid good God damn money for the fantasy that I am above those people and I

258
00:15:50.611 --> 00:15:54.540
did not get that.
And I hope Mister and Missus Delta Airlines here,

259
00:15:54.541 --> 00:15:56.220
this fucking thing and I hope,

260
00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:58.980
I hope they try to come at me with some sort of voucher,

261
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.580
some sort of gift certificate for a Brownie Sundae.

262
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.670
The next time I go back to the Atlanta Jackson fucking airport.

263
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.173
<v 0>Okay.</v>

264
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.000
<v 1>This is the thing.
All this fucking waving my arms.</v>

265
00:16:12.001 --> 00:16:14.910
They're not going to fucking change it.
They're not going to change it.

266
00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.090
And I'm still going to fly.
They're fucking airline when I have to,

267
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.560
cause I don't have any,
I don't have any little,
I'm,

268
00:16:20.561 --> 00:16:24.450
I'm basically an American Airlines guy.
You know an American Airlines.

269
00:16:24.451 --> 00:16:26.190
When you fly first class,
you do,
you just eat,

270
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.430
you get on with the first class people,
you sit down,
you fucking fine.

271
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.010
You know what you are,
you're an inspiration.

272
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.400
You're an inspiration to the rest of those passions.

273
00:16:37.401 --> 00:16:40.370
There's passages that walk past you on American Airlines.

274
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.440
<v 0>Okay?</v>

275
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.410
<v 1>They're looking at you go and look at that and sickly bald looking redheaded
guy.</v>

276
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.640
If I work hard and those Sunday I'll be him

277
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.650
getting on the plane without a care in the fucking world.

278
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.390
It's like Delta Airlines.
Yeah.
You getting on with those same fucking people.

279
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.370
You know,
those people that are so fat,

280
00:17:00.371 --> 00:17:03.820
they got the crease in the back like a toddler.
You know,

281
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.220
toddlers have those cute rolls of fat.
You know what I mean?

282
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:10.330
There's a certain level of fatty you get to,
you should really have your arms up.

283
00:17:10.331 --> 00:17:14.050
You know,
the way a little baby walks.
Uh,
why am I attacking fat people?

284
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.260
I,
I just,
I've traveled.

285
00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.040
I didn't even know how many fucking miles I traveled,
but let's put it this way.

286
00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:26.160
When I saw that George Clooney movie where he was trying to get a million miles,

287
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:30.990
I wasn't impressed.
All right?
But that man was doing was pedestrian.

288
00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.540
Oh,
and then you met the woman you found out later.
She was married.

289
00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:35.040
Welcome to the fucking road buddy.

290
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.300
Am I supposed to feel bad for you with your full head of beautiful salt and

291
00:17:39.301 --> 00:17:41.880
pepper?
Fucking hair.
Hang on a sec.

292
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.830
You've villain Indian fucking Italy.
Um,

293
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.530
my stocking him.
All right.
And one is life anyways.
Um,

294
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:56.813
<v 0>yeah,</v>

295
00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:02.870
<v 1>I just don't like that Delta has put me in the position to expose myself for the</v>

296
00:18:02.871 --> 00:18:05.900
elitist cunt that I am.
All right.

297
00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:11.030
I'm not saying that I'm better than the people in the back of the plane.

298
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:11.910
What I'm saying is,

299
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:16.130
is I got paid to be treated better than them and I don't want to be lumped in

300
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.560
with all these fucking contest winners,

301
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.330
all these fucking widget salesman that fly your goddamn airline every fucking

302
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.780
fucking weekend.
So then now this down they port.

303
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:31.850
What the fuck did they pay for their ticket?
300 bucks.
You getting on with me?

304
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:38.110
How dare you put me in that position?
Delta,
Mrs and Mrs Delta Airlines.

305
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.663
<v 0>Okay.</v>

306
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.500
<v 1>They should be,
I should've got a fucking discount on my tea.</v>

307
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.280
I just wished it was a fucking phone number that you could call and actually

308
00:18:49.281 --> 00:18:52.490
talk to a person and I could just be like the biggest asshole ever.

309
00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.870
What don't they get on your airline?

310
00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:00.180
I do not even want to shoot people beyond the other facility that occurred

311
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.390
during the fucking flight.
Like people just waltzed and write up.

312
00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:05.440
Just using the fucking bat.
Everybody gets on.

313
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.230
Everybody's in first place the fuck Outta here.

314
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.910
Get outta here with euro comedy,
condoms,
seating,
shits.

315
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.560
You take those in the back,
buddy.
You take that in the back.

316
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:23.580
I don't want to listen to your fucking sin up on farts up here.
Okay.

317
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.460
This is first class.
We have silverware.

318
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.610
No,
I don't give a shit if fuse about,
I don't give a fuck about any of it.

319
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.140
The only thing I fucking want is what I'm paying for is you go first class and I

320
00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:41.340
just Mosey on to the fucking plane and stick my bag right above my chair and I

321
00:19:41.341 --> 00:19:45.090
sit in a chair that's actually fit to be used by a human being.

322
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.440
That's all I'm fucking paid for.

323
00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:49.680
I don't give a fuck about your meals and all of that other bullshit and then he

324
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:53.820
call me mister burn as in fuck,
you can take my fucking Hoodie and go hang it up.

325
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:55.290
I don't give a fuck about all of that.

326
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.320
<v 0>Okay.</v>

327
00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.930
<v 1>I'm paying for no anxiety.</v>

328
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.330
Like if this is the pain going to be there.

329
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.260
<v 0>Okay.</v>

330
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.520
<v 1>I all of that is supposed to be God.</v>

331
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

332
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.420
<v 1>You know,
it's like winning the lottery.</v>

333
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.930
That's what flying first classes you flight.

334
00:20:11.931 --> 00:20:13.670
This is the thing about for you fly first class.

335
00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:15.620
You don't want the flight to end.

336
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.710
That's how great first class is supposed to be.

337
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.310
Delta has somehow lost it.

338
00:20:22.311 --> 00:20:26.480
They forgot what the fuck it was.
You know what I mean?
You know what?

339
00:20:26.481 --> 00:20:31.440
I blame all of this on.
Ah,
right.
You know what?

340
00:20:31.441 --> 00:20:35.760
I blame all of this shit on fucking dress casual Fridays.

341
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.330
Casual Fridays.
Fucking ended it.

342
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:40.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

343
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.520
<v 1>It fucking ended it in this goddamn country.</v>

344
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.280
I'm old enough to remember when all of a sudden casual Fridays,

345
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.470
how old I am.
I remember when that shit came out at somebody.

346
00:20:52.471 --> 00:20:55.320
I was working in the warehouse and somebody from the carpeted area

347
00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.130
just started working there.
You know what I mean?
Those during the,

348
00:21:01.131 --> 00:21:03.330
this is the eighties this is like the Michael J.
Fox Erez.

349
00:21:03.331 --> 00:21:03.931
So you know what I mean?

350
00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:08.280
He got yourself a skinny tie in a fucking cubicle and you bought a Ford probe,

351
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:09.743
you know?

352
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.060
<v 0>Okay.</v>

353
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.300
<v 1>Whatever the fuck they used to call those fucking cars.</v>

354
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.880
You've got like a a Subaru,

355
00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.093
<v 0>you know,</v>

356
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.330
<v 1>and this fucking little Michael J.
Fox guy goes,
what's,
what's,</v>

357
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.840
what's casual Fridays?
And I made the joke.

358
00:21:25.841 --> 00:21:29.320
I go all that's when everybody dresses like us.
Basically.

359
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:30.700
Like your run loading a truck.

360
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.570
And I remember my boss got upset by that and tried to have some big fucking

361
00:21:34.571 --> 00:21:39.340
meeting about it and I'm Mr. Burns said that that's when everybody drives

362
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.500
dresses like us and a that's stuck with me a,

363
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.270
I feel like we should have more pride out here in the warehouse and fucking

364
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:51.480
bookbub and you just,
it,
he had a bunch of fucking hung over musicians in class.

365
00:21:51.481 --> 00:21:54.570
Clowns working out there and just staring at this guy going to be showing up.

366
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.460
Like we always show up.
Okay.

367
00:21:56.461 --> 00:22:01.440
If you think I'm going to fucking show up like it's the 1950s and we work at an

368
00:22:01.441 --> 00:22:05.670
ice cream parlor to go unload trucks.
That's not happening.
So that failed.

369
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:06.563
But um,

370
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:07.790
<v 0>okay.</v>

371
00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:11.330
<v 1>Yeah,
everything has just become like everybody's just fucking down to earth now.</v>

372
00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:17.210
Sort of as the middle class shrinks,
I don't understand it.
Okay.

373
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:21.350
Do you know back in the day when you flew first,
this is how far we fucking come.

374
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:27.130
When you flew first class on Pan Am and you flew into JFK international airport

375
00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:36.770
back before every airport said they were international.
You know what I mean?

376
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.980
That's like every fucking podcasts out there claims they have like a million

377
00:22:39.981 --> 00:22:43.310
fucking downloads or the number one in something.
You know what I mean?

378
00:22:43.311 --> 00:22:47.270
Every fucking airport now since they're international.
Well you know,

379
00:22:47.271 --> 00:22:51.200
you connect from our airport to an actual international airport and next thing

380
00:22:51.201 --> 00:22:53.480
you know you're in Europe.
So I think we're international.

381
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.830
That's like the second assistant hockey.
The Fuck Outta here.
Second assist.

382
00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.200
You knew that fucking guy was going to pass it to the other guy.

383
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.510
You get a point too.
Um,

384
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:04.900
<v 0>okay.</v>

385
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:09.240
<v 1>Oh fuck my train of thought.
What was,
what was my point?
Oh,
back in the day,</v>

386
00:23:09.241 --> 00:23:11.810
the metlife building in New York,
right at Bro,

387
00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.120
a right above grand central station used to be the Pan Am building.

388
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.700
Well back in the day when you flew first class in Pan Am,

389
00:23:20.701 --> 00:23:22.140
you landed at JFK.

390
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.560
He got off that fucking plane from up top where there was a guy playing a

391
00:23:25.561 --> 00:23:26.670
goddamn piano.

392
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.223
<v 0>Okay.</v>

393
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:33.260
<v 1>You're up there this summer when came blowing in.</v>

394
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:38.330
Won't your sock my day?
Great.
This is nothing too.
People go,
well,

395
00:23:38.331 --> 00:23:40.730
what happened to all the good looking stewardesses and all that?
Oh look,

396
00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:41.780
because there's no money.

397
00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.860
They deregulated the whole fucking thing and then that'd be fucking jerk off

398
00:23:46.861 --> 00:23:51.120
with flip flops could use to FirstClass bathroom and then all those good looking

399
00:23:51.121 --> 00:23:53.730
women and like,
well there's no nobody to gold.
Dig On this thing.

400
00:23:53.731 --> 00:23:58.110
I'm fucking Outta here.
That's what happened.
Okay.

401
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:01.920
You take the money,
the money goes out the window sodas,
all the beautiful women.

402
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.700
It's like a vacuum.
They get sucked,
right the fuck out.

403
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.900
Everybody on the flight looks like [inaudible] Alice from the Brady Bunch.

404
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:15.680
<v 0>Oh God.
Ugh.</v>

405
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.640
Drinking this fucking cold and flu herbal shot.

406
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.830
<v 1>Oh God.
That's gotta be the Dandelions or some shit.
Oh my God.
That's bitter.</v>

407
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.260
Anyways,
I'm sweating.
I'm gonna Finish this fucking story.

408
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:33.640
When you flew first class on Pan Am to JFK international airport,

409
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:37.820
when you got off that fucking plane,
you didn't go into the airport with those.

410
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.600
You did.

411
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:50.140
You got off that fucking thing and they walked you over to a fucking helicopter.

412
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.640
Okay.
And you like Ron Burgundy,

413
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.660
you know with a scarf around your neck and you have glass of Scotch.

414
00:24:58.661 --> 00:25:01.510
You fucking walked over to that thing.
You got on that,

415
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.120
they flew you from Brooklyn right up and over.

416
00:25:04.121 --> 00:25:09.040
All the traffic landed you on top of the Pan Am building and you know what was

417
00:25:09.041 --> 00:25:12.220
up there.
There was a bar,
beautiful women,

418
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.060
rich people and all this shit.

419
00:25:16.061 --> 00:25:20.770
You got off into that world and you had another scotch.

420
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

421
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.330
<v 1>You talked to some women and whatever,
right?</v>

422
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:28.800
Well you made a fucking business connection and then when you were ready to go,

423
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.720
somebody took your bags,

424
00:25:30.721 --> 00:25:33.770
you went down in the elevator and right into a fucking cab over to you.

425
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.950
God Damn Hotel.

426
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.873
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

427
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.450
<v 1>And probably somebody put a little fucking eight ball and your breast coat</v>

428
00:25:39.451 --> 00:25:42.910
pocket.
We've gone from that

429
00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:49.180
to what I experienced in Atlanta and mister and Missus Delta Airlines.

430
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.070
Okay.
I missed it.
I missed,

431
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.220
<v 0>okay.</v>

432
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.500
<v 1>That my window</v>

433
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.410
of when FirstClass was first class,

434
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.980
that she sometimes you just got to admit that you missed it.
Like,

435
00:26:03.981 --> 00:26:05.540
I feel bad for millennials,

436
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.790
like when I look at all this shit that they're going through and all these

437
00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:11.360
climate change and all this crap that they gonna have to fucking deal with,

438
00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:13.610
the ramifications of,
I look back,
you know,

439
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.390
as I'm dealing with turning 50 I'm like,
you know what,

440
00:26:17.391 --> 00:26:20.780
it's kind of cool that I got to live through the seventies eighties and nineties

441
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:22.893
<v 0>you know,</v>

442
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:28.140
<v 1>and I'd take one out now when I look at people in their sixties seventies and</v>

443
00:26:28.141 --> 00:26:31.830
eighties and I'm thinking like,
you know what,
that guy right there,

444
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:38.040
that guy probably got his dick sucked on a helicopter ride from JFK over to the

445
00:26:38.041 --> 00:26:39.180
top of the Pan Am building.

446
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.290
<v 0>That guy knows what first class</v>

447
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:48.090
<v 1>is.
All right.
Um,</v>

448
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:53.810
I don't want to hear it.

449
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:55.880
I don't want to hear it from the people in the back of the plane.

450
00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.660
What a spoiled Brat I am.
I don't give a fuck.

451
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.490
I am so beyond you

452
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.690
that I won't even read your emails.

453
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:12.290
I can tell by the font that you sit in the back of the plane where you have a

454
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.510
law.
No,
I'm kidding.
No,
I'm just saying.
You know what I mean?

455
00:27:14.511 --> 00:27:18.860
What the fuck can I just get on the fucking plane?
All I'm asking for,

456
00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.890
I don't need a helicopter ride.
I don't need a fucking hand job.

457
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.390
Can I just get on the fucking plane in a relaxed manner?

458
00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.680
Just put my bag up there.
This was the fuck I paid for.
Okay.

459
00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.430
And then you can come to me and be like,
um,
do you,
you want the eggs?

460
00:27:31.431 --> 00:27:33.500
So the oatmeal,
can I get the eggs on Saturday?

461
00:27:33.501 --> 00:27:36.770
Where all out of eggs that happens in first class.

462
00:27:36.771 --> 00:27:40.970
What do we do around eggs as far as class?
So I'm,

463
00:27:40.971 --> 00:27:43.670
my voice is cracking his first fucking class.
You should still have them.

464
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.740
Hang on a second.
Let me take another shot of fucking dandelion root.

465
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.890
Oh,
I'm starting to like that.

466
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.090
But as we went,
I did the landscape,
but for fucking one song,
all right.
In,

467
00:27:59.091 --> 00:28:03.710
don't cheat.
You know,
talk about how every man looks better in a suit.

468
00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.480
Oh yeah.
Every man,
it looks better to suit,

469
00:28:05.481 --> 00:28:08.600
especially back in the day when FirstClass as first class and you would wear a

470
00:28:08.601 --> 00:28:13.601
suit trying to impress those goddesses that used to work up there,

471
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:14.733
you know,

472
00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.400
and they pretended that you were funny and that your stories were fucking

473
00:28:18.401 --> 00:28:22.840
interesting and then they fucking dance gov over to a Goddamn helicopter and

474
00:28:22.841 --> 00:28:25.340
you're beautiful fitted suit and don't.

475
00:28:25.341 --> 00:28:30.341
Chino is the world's largest made to measure men's wear company and has been

476

and fast company.
Yeah.
I don't know what that last one is.

478
00:28:40.731 --> 00:28:43.760
It kind of tapered off in the last one,
Huh?
Um,

479
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:48.110
they make suits and shirts made to your exact measurements for great fit.

480
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:48.921
Guys.

481
00:28:48.921 --> 00:28:52.940
Love the wide selection of high quality fabrics and the option to personalize

Just like the Ohio state dude.
The fucking love this shift.

499

Then it gets good.

501

Starts tasting metallic.
Um,
Joan is Straw.
Uh,

502
00:30:11.741 --> 00:30:12.970
the Black Tux,

503
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.740
the Black Tux wedding season is upon us.

504
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.240
I'm so happy I'm in the other.
So you know,

505
00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.080
sometimes when I see somebody in a wedding,
I'm just,

506
00:30:23.081 --> 00:30:27.160
I'm so glad that I'm on the other side of that,
you know?

507
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.850
And then I look at people that have started a family and they're done having

508
00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:34.990
kids,
you know,
cause it was debating possibly having another one.
I don't know.

509
00:30:34.991 --> 00:30:38.210
I'm pretty fucking old at this point.
What am I,
Tony Randall.
Um,

510
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.480
but like when I just see so many that said they're married,

511
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.810
they have demount of kids that they're going to have and they're just on the

512
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:46.900
other side of it.
Okay.
They've taken the date,
date,

513
00:30:46.901 --> 00:30:49.720
they set sail and this is what we're doing.

514
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.890
You know that together the shit is working.
You know?

515
00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.220
Even though I had,
I would have one,

516
00:30:57.221 --> 00:30:59.680
I had one of the great weddings of all time and it's such a great time,
man.

517
00:30:59.681 --> 00:31:03.940
It just,
the stress,
you know,
I have anxiety,
I have anxiety.

518
00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:08.390
I think that's what it is.
I'm almost thinking like,
like where,
where,

519
00:31:08.391 --> 00:31:12.700
where's the fucking slap to the side of the head comes from.
Um,
anyways,

520
00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:14.140
wedding season is upon us.

521
00:31:14.141 --> 00:31:18.100
You're going to be doing it big and going all out.

522
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.780
All right,
go on.
Going out to all of your buddies weddings.
Nice copy.

523
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:24.550
I liked at your buddy's wedding.
So you're not,

524
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:27.250
you're not the one locked and loaded.
You're not locked in.

525
00:31:27.251 --> 00:31:29.680
You're not getting waterboarded.
You're the free guy.

526
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:33.880
Run around with your bow tie off,
banging all the fucking drunk chicks.

527
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:38.530
When you're bringing a date,
you want to look fresh.

528
00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:44.440
Uh,
but it has to be convenient.
Who brings a fucking day to a wedding?

529
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:46.030
That's the dumbest thing you could ever do.

530
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:50.260
When are you going to add comedienne Yay.
That's where the black tux comes at.

531
00:31:50.261 --> 00:31:52.720
Fuck deck.
You've got to Tuck.
She goes stag.

532
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.920
Uh,
the black Tux has answered.

533
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:02.110
It has awesome suits and Tuxedos and all kinds of styles and you rent them

534
00:32:02.111 --> 00:32:05.590
online.
There you go.
You get up,
you get a Tuxedo with a little bit of flair.

535
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.850
You show up,
you know,
with your little Pompadour,
you just,

536
00:32:09.851 --> 00:32:13.990
all you gotta do is act like you're interesting.
You know,

537
00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.500
the anxiety that women feel at a wedding,
that it's not them.

538
00:32:17.501 --> 00:32:20.500
I'm telling you right now that they're going to fall right in your fucking lap.

539
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.990
Um,
just wait for a slow song to come on.
You know,

540
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.750
we both last Saturday,

541
00:32:28.751 --> 00:32:33.340
steely in the dead of that who would have poison at their wedding at this point?

542
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.930
Somebody getting married for the third time.
Uh,
the black,

543
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.800
the black Tux,

544
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:44.230
the kinds of suits and Tuxedos styles that would normally be wildly expensive to

545
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:45.080
buy.

546
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.520
And you might only wear it once like the Emerald Shawl Tuxedo.

547
00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.990
It's Funky motherfucker.
It's cool.
But how many times you get to wear it?

548
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.770

Uh,

574
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:39.500
I just immediately envisioned someone stealing my fucking kidneys after they put

575
00:34:39.501 --> 00:34:42.110

Uh,

624
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.990

Doctors,

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:55.110
I like it.
Remember that Chevy Chase?
We did that giant line of blow.

627
00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:00.690
Um,
ah,
I like it.

628
00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.910
Um,
nothing subbed up the 70s and the 80s,
like that quick little joke.

629
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:12.120
Alright.
Hockey playoffs,
the borough,

630
00:38:12.121 --> 00:38:16.260
it's jumped all over Tampa Bay in game one.

631
00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:21.210
Um,
to go up one,
nothing.
Um,
once again,

632
00:38:21.211 --> 00:38:26.130
our top line was absolutely killing it to Karasik was playing fucking great.

633
00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:31.620
Um,
to Brasco whatever.
I already know half the guys fucking these.
We were like,

634
00:38:31.621 --> 00:38:33.120
when I'm in the other room and somebody scores,

635
00:38:33.121 --> 00:38:35.900
a lot of the time I have to poke my head in to see who it is because we change

636
00:38:35.901 --> 00:38:39.250
so many players to this season.
And with the kid I,

637
00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:44.110
I probably watched five full games and um,
anyways,

638
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.340
and then gave to Tampa was just a better team.
They just came out like a,

639
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.980
they were ready to play and we just,
I don't know,

640
00:38:50.981 --> 00:38:55.480
every time we had the pocket was like,
it was on edge and um,
so whatever,

641
00:38:55.481 --> 00:38:56.860
it's one to one,
but we did what we had to do.

642
00:38:56.861 --> 00:39:00.490
We want one down there and that will come back.
And uh,

643
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:02.190
I hope we get up.

644
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.740
I'm more competent officiating crew because those guys were just,

645
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.610
it was like they were off and whatever.
They made some fucking bad calls.

646
00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:12.550
But that happens sometimes the calls go your way.
Sometimes they don't,

647
00:39:12.551 --> 00:39:14.830
you don't whine about it.
You pick up and move on.
But you know,

648
00:39:14.831 --> 00:39:18.070
when the fucking net is off the goddamn moorings,

649
00:39:18.071 --> 00:39:21.040
whatever the fuck they call it in the,
and the goalies like dope.

650
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:28.750
Oh here for like a half a fucking minute.

651
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:32.540
And they just don't see it like date that was not ready for primetime

652
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:36.730
officiating.
Um,
you know,

653
00:39:36.731 --> 00:39:38.760
I just hope I just don't want it to come down to that.

654
00:39:38.761 --> 00:39:40.660
Cause I think that Tampa is a great team and I want,

655
00:39:40.661 --> 00:39:45.370
I want to see Tampa beat us or the Bruins beat them.
I,

656
00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:49.420
I just,
you know,
that is a pet peeve of mine that,
you know,

657
00:39:49.421 --> 00:39:52.870
you start calling ticky tack Shit and you start like,
you know,

658
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:57.130
dictating the tone of the game and then all of a sudden you stop calling ticky

659
00:39:57.131 --> 00:40:00.460
tack Shit.
It's just weird.
You know what I mean?

660
00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:03.190
And then you let that shit go and then all of a sudden you call and stuff.

661
00:40:03.191 --> 00:40:05.260
I mean that's the type of shit,
you know,

662
00:40:05.261 --> 00:40:08.560
back in the day when I used to watch the NBA was like,
what the fuck?
You know,

663
00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:12.250
the shit is fixed.
Uh,
speaking of the NBA,

664
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:17.940
I was working a Saturday night and missed everything about that Celtics game

665
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:22.810
seven against Milwaukee.
I have not even seen a highlight.

666
00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:26.470
I am very happy that we won.
I heard we kind of want it,
you know,

667
00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:31.630
wire to wire.
And uh,
and then last night,
the weirdest thing ever.

668
00:40:31.631 --> 00:40:36.190
Like this Boston Celtics had a fucking playoff game while the Bruins had a

669
00:40:36.191 --> 00:40:39.020
playoff game and we beat the,
the,

670
00:40:39.021 --> 00:40:43.780
the formidable Philadelphia 70 sixers.
Uh,
when is that next game?

671
00:40:43.781 --> 00:40:46.500
And I can't,
I last time I think we played each other in the playoffs.

672
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:50.410
I have to go back to like 80 to 81,
82 83

673
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.750
way back in the day.
All right.
Game too is when Thursday.

674
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:59.290
Well,
I hope that's not going to overlap with the Bruins.

675
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:03.220
Fuck am I supposed to do,
I want to see this,
um,

676
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.720
the overachieving Celtics with all the goddamn injuries.
This is tremendous.

677
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:12.610
And um,
my picks in the NBA finals before it started and you can check

678
00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:17.710
with the great and always lovely to Elmira.

679
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:20.890
That's what I've always loved about his act.

680
00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:24.040
It's not the top shelf joke writing,

681
00:41:24.041 --> 00:41:28.990
it's the elegance of his performance.
Um,
I,

682
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:29.741
he asked me will,

683
00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:34.741
I thought and I picked a Toronto in the and golden state cause I figured Golden

684
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:38.930
State and Cleveland we're going to,
one of them is gonna make it back.

685
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:44.180
And uh,
I dunno,
I'm just impressed with Toronto.

686
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.410
They just got a lot of weapons and shit and blah,
blah blah blah blah.

687
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:53.510
And like Lebron is played like the equivalent of 60 years with all the fucking

688
00:41:54.321 --> 00:41:57.980
playoffs that,
that guy has been involved in.
Um,

689
00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.790
so anyways,
those are,
those are my goddamn pics and as far as hockey

690
00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.930
goes,
um,

691
00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:08.493
<v 0>yeah,</v>

692
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.660
<v 1>I dunno.
It's hard to</v>

693
00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:15.500
go against the penguins getting back there again.

694
00:42:15.501 --> 00:42:20.501
But I think the most interesting series right now is obviously the predators in

695
00:42:20.691 --> 00:42:23.030
Winnipeg jets.
Um,

696
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:25.610
I would not want to have to play either one of them and I'm sites.

697
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:27.620
One of them is going to knock the other one off.
All right.

698
00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:30.590
There's my limited fucking view of what the fuck's going on.
Alright.

699
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:34.850
Punk suggestions.
The fuck did you call me?

700
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.940
Um,
all right.

701
00:42:37.941 --> 00:42:42.080
I was listening to your podcast and you asked someone for suggestions on

702
00:42:42.081 --> 00:42:46.220
hardcore punk music.
I thought I'd try and email you from here.

703
00:42:46.221 --> 00:42:49.040
I would start with bands like minor threat.
I've heard of them.

704
00:42:49.041 --> 00:42:51.890
Food Gazi I've heard of them.
The X.
Never heard of them.
Bad brains.

705
00:42:51.891 --> 00:42:56.810
Of course I've heard of them.
He wrote,
of course a negative approach.
Parentheses,

706
00:42:56.811 --> 00:43:00.960
pretty aggressive.
Death from Detroit.
These are few good starters.

707
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:05.410
I hope this message reaches you and you enjoy.
All right,
I'll check those up.

708
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:09.910
I'm still trying to get into fish.
Everybody.
They haven't quite grab me.

709
00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:15.620
Alright.
Bullshit.
Guy Needing ar 15 to defend against coyotes.

710
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.280
Oh my God.
He's in the middle of fucking nowhere.
He's making you cheese.

711
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.630
Hey Sir.
William [inaudible].

712
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:27.530
I'm calling bullshit on the guy who wrote in claiming he needs an ar 15 to

713
00:43:27.531 --> 00:43:31.250
protect his goats from coyotes.
All right.
All right.
Okay,

714
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.740
well I hope you're a gun owner and a fucking rancher.

715
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:37.100
I grew up in a rural town in New Mexico.
All right.

716
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:39.470
I wasn't a plumber shown cheese rancher,

717
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:44.620
but we had two sheepdogs and Adeno coyotes living directly behind our house to

718
00:43:44.871 --> 00:43:47.360
this day.
Every night you could hear the coyotes howling.

719
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:52.460
The guy doesn't need a machine gun.
He needs more than one dog.
Oh Shit.

720
00:43:52.461 --> 00:43:53.410
Shots fired.

721
00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.080
Seems like common sense.
Honestly.

722
00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:03.070
There are breeds of dogs that have been bred for centuries to protect sheep from

723
00:44:03.071 --> 00:44:08.050
wolves.
Well,
that is true.
And they didn't have machine guns back then.
Well,

724
00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:13.310
how is like a one sheeped are two sheepdogs fend off our herd at coyotes.

725
00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:18.940
You know what that sounds like.

726
00:44:18.941 --> 00:44:22.570
That sounds like the sheepdogs at play in basketball and the coyotes are doing

727
00:44:22.571 --> 00:44:23.530
some man one shit.

728
00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.610
They need to have a fucking team game and they got to feed that big man under

729
00:44:27.611 --> 00:44:30.940
the fucking rack and quit putting up threes with no one who?
Nobody underneath.

730
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.450
All right,
wait a second.
Uh,

731
00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.230
there are breeds of dogs that had been bred for centuries to protect sheep from

732
00:44:39.231 --> 00:44:42.860
wolves.
Coyotes are pussies compared to wolves.

733
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:48.620
A few times when I was a kid,
I was less than 15 free from an adult coyote.

734
00:44:48.621 --> 00:44:49.820
And it just ran away.

735
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:55.150
Coyotes are also a lot smaller than wolves claiming coyotes hunt in packs of

736
00:44:55.461 --> 00:44:58.520
seven to 12.
Seems like an exaggeration.

737
00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:02.540
I don't like that word.
Seems.
That seems to me like you don't know,

738
00:45:02.541 --> 00:45:04.250
but it just sounds like bullshit to you.
Anyways,

739
00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:09.500
the most baddest thing I've ever seen a dog do was when my neighbors psycho dog

740
00:45:09.501 --> 00:45:12.650
chased away a coyote that came near as turf.

741
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:16.040
My neighbor had this crazy ugly mutt named butch.

742
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:20.090
Butch was the kind of dog where if the football or baseball went over the fence

743
00:45:20.091 --> 00:45:21.170
into butches yard,

744
00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:25.940
the ball was gone one day when I was a teenager and I was walking up the road

745
00:45:25.941 --> 00:45:27.710
and there was a coyote walking near me.

746
00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.310
I wasn't scared because the coyote was just minding his own business.

747
00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:36.290
I any fucking wild.
They're wild.
Animals have a different look on their face.

748
00:45:36.291 --> 00:45:37.790
Okay?
They,
they're killers.

749
00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:39.483
<v 0>You know,</v>

750
00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.290
<v 1>it's like hookers.
So you know,
there's a different look at,
don't know,
Hook.</v>

751
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:45.400
It looks at you.
It's real.
All right?

752
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:47.680
They're not fucking just trying to get a drink out of you.
Uh,

753
00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:52.770
then I see a butch jump over this five foot wall in land in a dead sprint quote.

754
00:45:56.381 --> 00:45:58.660
Oh Jesus.
This is going to be good.

755
00:45:58.661 --> 00:46:03.370
I thought he beeline straight for the coyote and without any hesitation or fear

756
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.670
hit the coyote like Walter Payton on cocaine.

757
00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:11.620
It definitely would have been on sports center is top 10 or some youtube video

758
00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:14.830
hardest hits in the NFL.
I love that you went with Walter Payton.

759
00:46:14.831 --> 00:46:18.460
He was one of the most aggressive,
uh,
offensive players.

760
00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:23.800
Larry's Onco is the first offensive player to get an unnecessary roughness call.

761
00:46:23.801 --> 00:46:25.000
He was on his way out of bounds.

762
00:46:25.001 --> 00:46:28.960
If someone went to hit him and he just gave the guy a forearm shiver to the
face,

763
00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:34.560
then butch and the coyote got into a scrappy ghetto street fight and eventually

764
00:46:35.291 --> 00:46:39.160
the coyote ran away.
This all happened within 10 yards of where I was standing.

765
00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.650
Uh,
well that was just one.

766
00:46:41.651 --> 00:46:44.410
And it sounds like the coyote fucking threw some hands too though.

767
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:45.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

768
00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:49.730
<v 1>Dogs are bad ass.
They can recognize threats and step up with no fear.</v>

769
00:46:49.731 --> 00:46:52.650
They also used to be wolves.
They're like,
we'll,
we'll flight,
right?
Yeah.

770
00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:54.613
<v 0>MMM.</v>

771
00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:57.830
<v 1>I'm not saying it's a good light beer.
It's more like Busch lite.</v>

772
00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:02.000
Surely this guy can find some large dogs who have instincts to protect some

773
00:47:02.001 --> 00:47:05.540
goats rather than resort to a military machine.

774
00:47:05.541 --> 00:47:10.160
Gun Shooting coyotes for sport is Douchey.
My uncle,
it has an

775
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.600
what are they?
Anatolian shepherd.

776
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.553
<v 0>Okay.</v>

777
00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:20.930
<v 1>And it was apparently bread for guarding livestock.
Livestock.
Massive dog.</v>

778
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:25.070
Uh,
I have a good summer and go fuck yourself.
Well,
what's the overhead?

779
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:27.940
What's the overhead on the dog?

780
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:32.890
Jesus fucking Christ.
Look at that guy.
Damn thing.

781
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:39.300
The males way from 50 to 65 kilograms,

782
00:47:39.301 --> 00:47:41.790
which is 110 to 143 pounds.

783
00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:46.710
Females of 40 to 55 kilograms,
that's 88,
221 pounds.

784
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.110
Uh,
they're like 32 inches.

785
00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:55.150
29 to 32 inches high.
28 to 31 inches high.

786
00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:57.840
<v 0>Okay.</v>

787
00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:02.810
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
That's a big ass God damn dog.
What's look at the car,</v>

788
00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:07.350
the coyotes.
The tale of the tape here.
Coyote stats.

789
00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.170
This is going to take me to the Phoenix coyotes.

790
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.320
Coyote animal,
Wikipedia.

791
00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:18.400
Let's see what you got here.

792
00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:25.370
Actual Coyote or a man?
No.
Coyote attacks on humans.

793
00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:27.060
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:30.390
<v 1>Tax generally identify the animal in question as simply coyote.</v>

795
00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:34.993
<v 0>Okay.</v>

796
00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.280
<v 1>Uh,
what the eastern Caio East and Kiara.
Here we go.</v>

797
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:44.420
See what they,
they don't even have their stats.
I don't like that.

798
00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.180
That's like when a movie goes to the theaters without being reviewed.

799
00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:52.070
The eastern coyotes is a wild North American canine of mixed coyote,

800
00:48:52.071 --> 00:48:57.071
wolf and dog parentage parentage that is present in New England,

Hi Alyse fucking places.

802
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.710
Uh,

803
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:08.270
so they're basically like stray dogs that then got fucked by wolves.

804
00:49:08.271 --> 00:49:12.860
Is that what happened?
That didn't get killed.
All right.

805
00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:16.610
Okay.
I don't care anymore.
All right,
well,

807
00:49:19.431 --> 00:49:20.810
what do you got to feed that thing every day?

808
00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:22.260
<v 0>Okay.</v>

809
00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.500
<v 1>How much of bullets?
I mean,
I don't know if it's like a,

<v 1>How many as far as I'm concerned.
What the fuck he just said.</v>

814
00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:38.400
You got Swiss cheese on your farm now buddy.

815
00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:42.180
Got a bunch of holes in your argument.
Please write back.

816
00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:46.710
Alright,

831
00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:49.970
Well,
I can't understand it unless a woman says it.

832
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.823
<v 0>Okay.</v>

841
00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:27.720
The DNA website responded by saying while in the debate,

842
00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:32.830
while in while the database was created for genealogical research,

843

it is important that g e D match.
Oh,

848
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:50.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:52.890
<v 1>I know you're no legal analysts,</v>

850
00:51:52.891 --> 00:51:56.700
but I wanted to get your thoughts on this by the way.
Loved you on crashing.

00:51:56.701 --> 00:51:59.730
Also come to a show in Maine for Fox sexy.

Have a nice day and go fuck yourself.
Um,

853
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.240

And you know what it was,

857
00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:18.810
was it actually wasn't that guy from what I heard was it was a relative and it

858
00:52:19.661 --> 00:52:24.220
was close enough and then they just narrowed it down into that gene pool and

859
00:52:24.221 --> 00:52:27.300
they judge that guy by his age,

860
00:52:27.301 --> 00:52:30.850
stay staked out his fucking house and then they got like a soda can out of his

861
00:52:30.851 --> 00:52:34.450
garbage and got his fucking DNA and they nailed them.
Um,

862
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:37.211
yeah.

863
00:52:37.211 --> 00:52:40.520
It's one of those things where this could be a great thing and you could get a

864
00:52:40.521 --> 00:52:42.880
rid of a,
it's,
it's all how it's applied.

865
00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:44.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

866
00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:45.550
<v 1>And,
um,</v>

867
00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:50.660
human beings do not have a great track record of doing the right thing.

868
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:55.800
We are all susceptible to the seven deadly sins.

869
00:52:55.801 --> 00:52:59.910
We are horribly flawed organisms.

870
00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:04.920
And then when you combine racism,
sexism,
Homophobia,

871
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:07.590
uh,
greed,

872
00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:13.770
ego and all of that shit,
uh,
yeah.
Like I don't know what could happen,

873
00:53:13.771 --> 00:53:16.440
but I mean,
I mean,
I'm all for this,

874
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:21.030
this fucking guy and he's like 71.
I still feel like he kinda got away with it.

875
00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:21.930
But,
um,

876
00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:27.830
just for the victims are still alive or family members knowing that they got

877
00:53:27.831 --> 00:53:31.580
this guy and he's going to fucking rot in jail for the rest of his fucking piece

878
00:53:31.581 --> 00:53:35.320
of shit.
Life I think is a good thing.
Um,

879
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.240
oh my God,
it just came up with an idea for a movie.

880
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:45.560
A serial killer kills all his relatives before they go on to fucking a genealogy

881
00:53:45.561 --> 00:53:49.340
website.
Genealogy website.
Geology website.

882
00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.153
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

883
00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:55.420
<v 1>it's a comedy.
You know,</v>

884
00:53:56.290 --> 00:54:00.040
they're going to find out that he's the fucking a jet ski killer is some Shit.

885
00:54:00.041 --> 00:54:04.750
I Dunno.
And then he's,
he's gotta be like,
you know,

886
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:09.190
any never goes to social events within the family.
He's always been a loner.

887
00:54:09.191 --> 00:54:10.540
All of a sudden he starts showing up.

888
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:13.780
It's all the Christmas parties and he's asking questions.

889
00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:16.780
Every party somebody dies.

890
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:22.500
So he's got like 10 family members and you know,

891
00:54:22.511 --> 00:54:27.080
the first one he kills it.
Thanksgiving,
maybe Halloween,
thanksgiving,

892
00:54:27.081 --> 00:54:31.660
then Christmas,
then there's like a fucking graduation.
I Dunno.

893
00:54:31.661 --> 00:54:36.550
He just flag day he takes out his fucking uncle.
Um,

894
00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.350
and then the local cops,
you know,
they've never seen anything like that.

895
00:54:41.351 --> 00:54:43.840
They were in a quiet town to use that trope.

896
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:47.860
And all of a sudden there's this family members,
they're all dying,
you know,

897
00:54:47.861 --> 00:54:51.820
and then everybody feels bad for the fucking loner cause he's losing all his

898
00:54:51.821 --> 00:54:56.680
family members.
And then finally,
one day,
the fucking,
you know,

899
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.540
op start,
you know,
you got the phone,
good old sheriff,
you know,

900
00:55:01.541 --> 00:55:04.150
he's seen everything.
God.
And I'm too old for this shit.

901
00:55:04.151 --> 00:55:07.000
And then he got the ups to,
I don't fucking,
you finished the fucking Robie.

902
00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:10.630
He finished the fucking movie.
I don't have time for that shit.
All right.

903
00:55:10.631 --> 00:55:13.270
Black Republicans.
Everybody.
Dear Mr Burn,

904
00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:16.000
I very much enjoyed your show at the Fox in Atlanta.

905
00:55:16.001 --> 00:55:17.830
I went with my wife's parents in loss.

906
00:55:17.831 --> 00:55:20.950
Thank you for your laughs and perspectives.
Well,
thank you.

907
00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.130
Would you mind sharing your thoughts on Kanye,

908
00:55:23.131 --> 00:55:27.970
his recent comments and the backlash from Hollywood and democratic elites?

909
00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:30.990
Um,

910
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:36.950
why do they always say elites to this republican elites to I myself am a black

911
00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:41.790
Republican who changed parties after the first Clinton administration for a

912
00:55:41.791 --> 00:55:44.670
great many reasons.
It's a bit unnerving.

913
00:55:44.671 --> 00:55:47.700
Hearing people cringe over the idea of a black Republican.

914
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:53.040
And it is disrespectful to marginalize my opinions in articulations because of

915
00:55:53.041 --> 00:55:56.560
my affiliations.
It's very telling that people do.

916
00:55:56.561 --> 00:56:01.561
Friend who defended Kanye and champion to him when he attacked George Bush are

917
00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:06.000
now casting him aside because he just not agree with their group.

918
00:56:06.001 --> 00:56:10.460
Think thank you for your service.
I go fuck yourself.
Um,

919
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:13.760
yeah,
I mean I,

920
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:18.830
there's this whole thing with liberals that they feel like all races are uh,

921
00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:21.040
<v 0>yeah,</v>

922
00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:26.020
<v 1>Republicans and then they also aren't of their own fucking racist thoughts.</v>

923
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:30.250
Prejudice starts and fucked up.
If you really pay attention to your thoughts,

924
00:56:30.251 --> 00:56:33.340
the information your brain is going to give you during the course of a fucking

925
00:56:33.341 --> 00:56:38.200
day,
you're going to think sexist shit,
homophobic shit,
racist.

926
00:56:38.201 --> 00:56:41.920
You just going to think shit that if you set it out loud,

927
00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:45.040
I've always said that if everybody's thoughts were made public,

928
00:56:45.041 --> 00:56:48.250
could anybody go to work on Monday?
Would you have a fucking job?
And you would.

929
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:52.960
So I'm
on the other side.

930
00:56:52.961 --> 00:56:57.130
The fact that Trump didn't tweet once during black history month said nothing as

931
00:56:57.131 --> 00:57:00.670
far as I'm aware of on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King.

932
00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:03.040
The fact that he fucking,
uh,

933
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:07.840
could kind of see both sides with neo Nazis and people who didn't like me and

934
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:11.650
Nazis said,
you know,
both sides of violent.
Um,

935
00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:17.410
I,
uh,
I can,
I understand that level of backlash.

936
00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:18.580
I don't understand

937
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:25.500
people that just feel that their party is just completely unflawed.

938
00:57:26.681 --> 00:57:30.880
I don't understand that.
Um,
having said that,

939
00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:36.130
I think Kanya just has an album coming out and MTV doesn't exist anymore.

940
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.800
And,
um,
that people at his level,

941
00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:46.830
they create controversies as a way to get free promotion.

942
00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:52.240
That's what I think.
I don't,

943
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:56.890
I don't take it seriously and nor do I give a shit what his political

944
00:57:56.891 --> 00:58:00.720
affiliation is.
I don't,
I don't care.
I don't care that you're a good feel.
Europe.

945
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.340
I get it.
You know,
you,

946
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:06.460
a lot of people become Republican when they make money and then they realize how

947
00:58:06.461 --> 00:58:09.460
much money you have to fucking give away and fucking taxes.

948
00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:11.770
Um,

949
00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:16.180
if you actually had the audacity to become successful and then all of a sudden

950
00:58:16.181 --> 00:58:18.880
you have to fucking,
you know,
you have to pay for everybody else,

951
00:58:18.881 --> 00:58:21.400
which I'm all for helping people out.
But my thing is,

952
00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:26.350
if you're sitting around not doing shit,
you know,
I told you a long time ago,
I,

953
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.621
you know,

954
00:58:26.621 --> 00:58:29.980
this person in my life was kept hitting me up for money and I finally had to
say,

955
00:58:29.981 --> 00:58:33.640
the guy just pant this into,
if you're in a hole and you're reaching up,

956
00:58:33.641 --> 00:58:34.870
I will pull you out of it.

957
00:58:34.871 --> 00:58:38.650
But if you've faced down and it digging it deeper every fucking day,
I mean,

958
00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:42.940
what am I supposed to do?
I'm throwing money into that.
You know,

959
00:58:42.941 --> 00:58:46.060
you want to keep doing fucking drugs and I'm also supposed to give you money,

960
00:58:46.061 --> 00:58:47.770
get,
get you fucking life together and,

961
00:58:47.771 --> 00:58:52.750
and help yourself out and I'll help you out,
you know?
So I see,

962
00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:58.690
you know,
I see all sides of the shit,
you know,
and sometimes I land,

963
00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.250
you know,
it's funny out here in Hollywood,
people think,
you know,

964
00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:08.780
someone was telling me so people think he voted for Trump,
which I,
I didn't.
Um,

965
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:14.280
I,
I kind of see like a,
I dunno,
it's,
it's really,
uh,

966
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:17.410
a situation to situation,
decision,

967
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:20.720
you know what I mean?
Sometimes you punched,

968
00:59:20.721 --> 00:59:23.360
sometimes you go for it on fourth down.
You know,

969
00:59:23.361 --> 00:59:25.700
that was depends on where you are in the field that you got.

970
00:59:25.701 --> 00:59:28.010
You have to look at it that way.
You can't just a hundred percent,

971
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:31.760
but golf lord every fucking time or were put kicking it away every fucking time.

972
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:35.930
Um,
so I,
I,
I,
you know,

973
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:41.060
I'm old school where I respect the,
I'm just happy,
sir,

974
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:42.350
that you're voting,

975
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.680
that you're politically active and you're fucking paying attention.

976
00:59:45.681 --> 00:59:49.700
That's a lot more than I can say for myself.
Said,
God bless you.
Um,

977
00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:54.290
but as far as Kanye,
all of a sudden becoming Republican,
uh,

978
00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:59.090
I don't buy because I'm in show business and that looks like a big fucking,

979
00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.930
that looks like wrestling when all of a sudden the hulk became the bad guy.

980
01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.390
And then eventually he's going to be shaking the blond hair.

981
01:00:05.391 --> 01:00:09.410
We're in the fucking orange and yellow panties again.
You know.
All right.

982
01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:12.890
Girlfriend wants to have sex before marriage trunks.

983
01:00:12.891 --> 01:00:15.530
I should say a dear mister burn.

984
01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.090
I'm 16 years old,
still going through high school.

985
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:25.010
I have a little problem with my relationship I'm having with this girl I met.

986
01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.830
Uh,
but here's a little backstory about it.
Okay.
About a year ago,

987
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:36.080
one of my friends got a girl pregnant,
and let's just say during that time,

988
01:00:36.081 --> 01:00:40.550
my friend went through some hard time knowing he was going to be a father to the

989
01:00:40.551 --> 01:00:44.720
point he tried to kill himself but failed.
Know Jesus Christ.

990
01:00:44.721 --> 01:00:47.120
This guy can't get anything right.
You can't put a condom on,
right.

991
01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:50.630
He can fucking off himself.
Two days after his attempt,

992
01:00:50.631 --> 01:00:54.470
he found out that the baby didn't make it.
Uh,

993
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.770
ending up in a miscarriage.
Wow.

994
01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:01.190
I have to see what my went friend went through.

995
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:05.750
I decided I was going to wait until at least 18 to have sex because I don't want

996
01:01:05.751 --> 01:01:08.720
to be like my idiot friend.
Well,

997
01:01:08.721 --> 01:01:12.710
don't you don't want to become a dad at 18 either.
Uh,

998
01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.800
wear a fucking condom.
All right.

999
01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:21.160
But here's the story about his story about me and the girl.

1000
01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.650
I met her at work and we've been dating for about six months now.

1001
01:01:24.651 --> 01:01:27.350
And I know what you're going to hear me say next.

1002
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:33.020
Like I really like her and all that bullshit,
but get to the point.
All right.

1003
01:01:33.021 --> 01:01:37.350
Anyways,
um,
screen goes black anyway.

1004
01:01:37.351 --> 01:01:38.420
She wants to have sex.

1005
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:43.100
Even though I told her I'm planning to wait after I told her that she gave me

1006
01:01:43.101 --> 01:01:47.240
that look.
Uh,
three days later she tried to pressure me into it.

1007
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:49.460
I kept saying,
no.
While you're learning,

1008
01:01:49.461 --> 01:01:54.030
one of the great fucking secrets about women is,
uh,

1009
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:59.000
whatever the fuck you want them to do.
Say you want to do the exact opposite.

1010
01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.000
You know what I mean?
And then they will fucking,
it's,
it's unbelievable.

1011
01:02:02.001 --> 01:02:05.750
It's like a fucking cat.
We used to go to Calgary,

1012
01:02:05.751 --> 01:02:07.700
used to do that fucking pit and you know,
you call a cat,

1013
01:02:07.701 --> 01:02:09.200
it just for fucking doesn't come at you.

1014
01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:13.790
You blow it off and it's fucking walking towards you.
Um,
anyways,

1015
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:19.700
then she went so far as to cry and sob about me not wanting to have sex with
her.

1016
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:22.520
Also,
I liked the idea of casual sex,

1017
01:02:22.521 --> 01:02:26.150
but I want to experience love sex.
Also,

1018
01:02:26.151 --> 01:02:31.151
I think this girl lied to me to try to get down my pants.

1019
01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.460
What do you think lie to you about what?
Bird balls?
Uh,

1020
01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:41.480
and stick your Dick Up Your Ass Hole,
Aka go fuck yourself.

1021
01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:44.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1022
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:48.420
<v 1>You kind of all over the map here and you also left out a lot of sentences.</v>

1023
01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:54.960
She lied to you.
Like,
I dunno,
I just do what the fuck you want to do.

1024
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:59.550
If what happened to your friend had such a psychological effect on you that you

1025
01:02:59.551 --> 01:03:04.320
don't want to have sex,
don't have sex with this person.
That's it.

1026
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:09.270
And women cry and sob all the fucking time to dry to get their fucking way.

1027
01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:12.960
It's bullshit.
Okay.
Unless she is slugged him in the arm.

1028
01:03:12.961 --> 01:03:15.120
I don't know what the fuck they're crying about.
You know what I mean?

1029
01:03:15.121 --> 01:03:17.640
You're crying,
crying.

1030
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.160
I could see if you're upset,
if you're depressed,
but you're crying.

1031
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:30.120
Here's the thing,
don't do this.
But this is what I do.

1032
01:03:30.121 --> 01:03:33.870
Because I've said that to women.
Like you crying over this,
how old are you?

1033
01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:37.110
Watch how quickly the tears stopped and they immediately switched to fucking

1034
01:03:37.111 --> 01:03:37.944
anger.
Okay.

1035
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.940
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1036
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.710
<v 1>You know what I mean?
The,
their ability,</v>

1037
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.800
how fast they can stop crying and then fucking start yelling at you.

1038
01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:48.150
Like I was going back to whenever I cried when I was a kid.

1039
01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.570
I mean,
I couldn't just stop that,
you know,
I'd be like,
fuck.

1040
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:56.250
And I was still be crying.
They immediately just stop fucking crying.
Bam.
So,

1041
01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:00.650
um,
here's the deal,
dude.
You're actually,

1042
01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:04.420
what you're doing to this woman is you're actually,

1043
01:04:04.421 --> 01:04:05.920
you don't like when you play a video game,

1044
01:04:05.921 --> 01:04:08.050
one of those fighting video games and you don't know what you're doing.

1045
01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:10.370
You just push a button,
a bunch of buttons and all of a sudden you,

1046
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.500
your guy does something special in you,

1047
01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:16.110
but you don't know how the fuck you did it.
That's what you're doing with this.

1048
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:19.740
You know,
this is a completely role reversed.

1049
01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.493
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1050
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.150
<v 1>She's crying like,
because you're not going to fuck her.</v>

1051
01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:25.980
Like you sound like you're in a boy band.

1052
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.360
Like you through acting the complete opposite way as of every other guy has.

1053
01:04:33.721 --> 01:04:37.260
So mind fucked her that she's acting.
You're,

1054
01:04:37.261 --> 01:04:40.590
you're getting treated like you're fucking Justin Bieber Asub Shit.

1055
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:46.230
Um,
yeah,
she's making this all about herself.

1056
01:04:46.231 --> 01:04:48.540
She feels fucking rejected.
Cause this is the thing,

1057
01:04:48.541 --> 01:04:53.541
women know the power that they have over us and the fact that you at the height

1058
01:04:54.331 --> 01:04:57.840
of how you're at the height of where you should not be able to walk away from it

1059
01:04:57.841 --> 01:05:02.430
are walking away from it is fucking with her and her level of,

1060
01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.530
of a,
I dunno,
power,
you know,

1061
01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:08.490
I would think this is all so I'm really fucking stupid and don't know shit about

1062
01:05:08.491 --> 01:05:10.800
women.
But sometimes I do,
you know,

1063
01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:13.480
remember that Mel Gibson movie where he was a conspiracy theorist,

1064
01:05:13.481 --> 01:05:15.930
he throughout all these crazy ones,
but every once in a while he was right.

1065
01:05:15.931 --> 01:05:18.150
That's how I am with women.
Every in a while I'm fucking right.

1066
01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:20.110
So what I will tell you that,

1067
01:05:20.111 --> 01:05:24.240
so what I do know is you should do what the fuck you want to do.
All right?

1068
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:25.890
And um,

1069
01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:29.003
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1070
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:33.760
<v 1>I believe Hootie and the blowfish said it best when they said let her cry.</v>

1071
01:05:35.490 --> 01:05:36.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1072
01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:38.070
<v 1>I mean that song later.
Oh crap.</v>

1073
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:43.120
And when someone calls out tomorrow,
lady range,

1074
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:44.410
whatever the fuck he said,

1075
01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.760
how smart was Darrius Rucker when he got out of that fucking bed?

1076
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:51.030
That was like when the fucking road run,

1077
01:05:51.031 --> 01:05:54.700
it just steps off the rock before it fucking crashes to the ground is somehow he

1078
01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:58.930
doesn't take the impact.
You know,
now he does the country thing,
right?

1079
01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:05.050
Uh,
anyways,
that's the podcast.
Everybody,
um,

1080
01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:11.900
I have some work to do today and then I am just shutting this fucking down.

1081
01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:15.650
I'm not going to fucking do anything for like three,
four days.

1082
01:06:15.651 --> 01:06:18.240
I have to get past this God damn cough.
Um,

1083
01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:23.150
I'm coming up on two weeks with us and I don't wanna I don't want to,
you know,

1084
01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.920
I've never had pneumonia and I don't want to fucking get it,
you know,

1085
01:06:27.921 --> 01:06:30.710
cause then every time you get it,
it's like every time when she get frostbite,

1086
01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:34.730
you know,
every time you open the refrigerator,
your fucking toe start tingling.

1087
01:06:34.731 --> 01:06:37.250
I don't want to deal with that for the rest of my life.
All right,

1088
01:06:37.251 --> 01:06:39.740
that's the podcast.
I'll check in on you on Thursday.

1089
01:06:39.741 --> 01:06:43.910

1091
01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:50.190
