00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.400
August 27th,
2012 how's it going?

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.070
I'm actually recording this Sunday night cause I got a bunch of Shit to do

5
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:23.211
I got this burst of energy on a Sunday and I was like,

6
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:24.270

I'm going to,

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.270

8
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:32.130
do tomorrow morning.
You know,
going to pay the bills,

9
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.820
going to go down to fucking windshields and go get a pretzel.

10
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:39.240
You don't give a fuck.
Right?
Is any,
who the fuck eats there by the way?

11
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.160
What is windshields?
Do they make hot dogs?

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.070
They just make that shit ass fucking food.

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.360
That fat pasty white people just can't get enough of,

14
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.560
you know,
that's how you fucking do it.
All these,

15
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:55.290
all these athletes taking the roids,
you don't need that.

16
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:58.050
You go down to the food court,
Orange Julius,

17
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.940

18
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:05.760
sandwiches.
Right.
You get some fries from them.

19
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.920
I love it.
That's part of,
you guys have seen that that chick filet,

20
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.300
they don't like gay people.
Chick filet.
We don't like the gay.

21
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.870
If you're straight,

A few Aa,

24
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.320
The fuck year are we living in and

25
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.271
<v 0>more importantly,</v>

26
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:31.080
how much fucking money you make and sell and chicken that you can get rid of

27
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:34.710
that portion,
that amount of people in the population.

28
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.990
You know,
why the fuck he act like you Mcdonald's Chick-Filet you're not.

29
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.020
You know you're not even Popeye's.
Forget about KFC.

30
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.660
The fuck in Babe Ruth,

31
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:52.440
Michael Jordan of feeding people unhealthy chicken.

32
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.600
You know that shit.
God Damn God.
That's your fucking led Zeppelin right there.

33
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.720
The chicken industry right there.

34
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.770
That old fucking plantation owner,
if that slave,
that's how much.

35
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:06.930
That's how fucking good they are.
Cooking chicken.

36
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:11.910
They have a goddamn looks like a fucking slave owner straight out of that movie

37
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:16.770
roots as their,
their mascot or their spokesperson.

38
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.353
You know what I mean?

39
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.800
Lease Wendy's has that nonthreatening sort of fucking fat white guy.

40
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.800
You know,
who looks like he loves his wife,
but probably,
you know,

41
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.040
steals from the company.
If he's in the accounting division,
doesn't,

42
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.570
he actually does.
Look,
he,
that guy and the guy from Wendy's does not look honest.

43
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.320
100% honest.
He looks like a real swell guy who one day the,

44
00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:45.270
the feds would show up in a,
raid his house and grab his hard drive,

45
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.240
and then he'd come out weeping and his family would be all stunned at the double

46
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:54.060
life that they weren't aware that he was leading.
It doesn't even look like that.

47
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.500
You just see his stupid glasses fogging up,
you know?

48
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:02.360
And then of course gets convicted,
right?
They go through all the bullshit.

49
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.380
Nancy grace with their fucking angry Hellboy head would be sitting there,

50
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:11.230
you know,
the fucking female Jim Rome,
right?

51
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.090
Getting all fucking pissed off with flames going behind her.
And then what,

52
00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:17.590
what happened?
Eight months later,

53
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.850
Bryant Gumbel would show up.
Oh,
maybe you'd send that fucking vampire,
uh,

54
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.030
grandpa monster there,
frank to Ford.
And they would go and interview the guy,

55
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.900
right?
The Wendy's guy.
And he'd be sitting there and his fucking jumpsuit,

56
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.030
you know,
you know,
you know,

57
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:39.031
like if there's pudgy hands just ringing them together and they'd just be like,

58
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:41.880
where did it all go wrong?
I lead,
I lead you.

59
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.570
You had the think at some point you were gunna get caught,
don't ya?

60
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.140
I mean,
what were you thinking?
And then you just be like,
Eh,

61
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.983
<v 2>okay.</v>

62
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.180
<v 0>I don't what I was thinking.</v>

63
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.630
Tik Tik Tik Tik Tik Tik Tik Tik Tik tonight on 60 minutes,

64
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.800
that fest fuck from Wendy's,
who he thought was an honest guy.

65
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.590
Guess now he's a piece of shit.
Does that make you feel better about your life?

66
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:05.880
You fucking cunt.
Well,

67
00:04:05.881 --> 00:04:08.940
why don't you go walking in the mirror and rather than just fucking brush your

68
00:04:08.941 --> 00:04:12.570
teeth,
you look into it and really think about some of the shit that you've done.

69
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.100
You know?
And maybe if you fucking had some talent in life,

70
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.540
you could have been a piece of shit at that level.
We're,

71
00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:25.200
it'd be worthy of telling your piece of shit stories on 60 minutes or some other

72
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.950
investigative news program.
Bill,
where the fuck you going with this?

73
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.630
I'll tell you where I'm going with this.

74
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.410
Lance Armstrong one that God damn bike by grace,

75
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.190
he did it seven times in a fucking row.
All right,

76
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.080
and now you're telling me he didn't.

77
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.160
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

78
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.120
<v 0>he did</v>

79
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.960
are fucking roided up guy beat your roid it up guys seven fucking times in a row

80
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.930
and I don't care how you slice it,
how you dice it,
whatever the fuck you do.

81
00:04:56.931 --> 00:04:58.400
Go Fuck Yourself.

82
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.170
They were all dope and therefore it's an even playing field.

83
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.260
It's like the 2004 fucking Boston Red Sox when they beat the Yankees are roided

84
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.220
up guys beat your wrote it up guys.
That's level.
That's a level playing field.

85
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.820
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

86
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.910
<v 0>I can't fucking believe those constantly just kept coming at him.</v>

87
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:22.660
It common at and then finally everybody fucking cracked.

88
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.890
You know,
bunch of God damn pussies,

89
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:31.300
all lining up to fucking rat the guy out.
Isn't the,
is there any like,

90
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.750
<v 2>okay.</v>

91
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.040
<v 0>You know,
wasn't half the fun when you were growing up.</v>

92
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.660
When the teacher knew you did something but couldn't fucking prove it and knew

93
00:05:41.661 --> 00:05:43.520
that you knew who the fuck did it.

94
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.810
He just sat there and you wouldn't fucking say shit and you got to watch this

95
00:05:47.811 --> 00:05:51.050
person in power be defeated.

96
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.560
You know what the fuck are they going to duty?

97
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.950
<v 2>Okay,</v>

98
00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.950
<v 3>why did these other bike ride and jackass is all crumble?</v>

99
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.650
What were they threatening you with?
I don't fucking get it.

100
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.560
<v 2>Okay,</v>

101
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.680
<v 3>let me,
let me ask you this.
How to fuck is Lance Armstrong's cheating?</v>

102
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.090
But these old roid it up,
guys.
You see at night the nighttime,

103
00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:18.030
that's synergetics.
They're not cheating.
They're on fucking HGH.

104
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.720
They didn't earn their six pack of them.
None of this shits getting taken away.

105
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.380
Go Fuck Yourself,
all right.
He won the thing.

106
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.920
He wanted seven times in a fucking role.
I don't,
I don't give a shit.

107
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.720
Barry bonds

108
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.690
hit the most fucking whole runs of all time.
All right.

109
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.620
And he did it.
He just say he did it during the roid error.

110
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.300
That's all we're all going to be on him.

111
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.430
You know it's going to happen.
No one wants to have a chicken neck.

112
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.930
No one wants you to have your fucking tits that you never had before.

113
00:06:57.931 --> 00:07:02.640
Now sliding into your fucking stomach,
your stomach's just a slit.
You know,

114
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.620
that's how fat you get as you get older,

115
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.830
when you're fucking naval looks like a fucking ass crack is somebody sleeping on

116
00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:13.380
a couch on its side,

117
00:07:13.381 --> 00:07:17.430
right all the way down to the old fucking ball bag.
You don't want that.

118
00:07:17.431 --> 00:07:19.360
You want to be shredded.
Okay.

119
00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:23.190
And it's already starting old people are taking the fucking thanks for what?

120
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.520
Cause they're trying to make division one football.
No,

121
00:07:26.521 --> 00:07:28.980
cause they want to look good.
Okay.

122
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.540
And how do we know how to give it to these people?
Because they heroes.

123
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:35.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

124
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.410
<v 3>Like fucking Lance Armstrong all the way back to Lao Lau.</v>

125
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:43.080
Zeto they put this shit in their fucking bodies and you know those fucking cops

126
00:07:43.081 --> 00:07:46.180
out there and silicone valley,
they got to watch what happened.

127
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.210
Slowly make improvements.
I'm telling you,

128
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.410
within 15 years,
I guaran fucking tee you.

129
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.360
There's going to be kids sprinkling h g h onto their fucking corn flakes.

130
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.200
Wondering why Lance Armstrong wasn't allowed to say that he won that fucking

131
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:07.630
bike race seven years in a row.
I got fucking news for you.

132
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.270
If you want to see people not on Roids,

133
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.770
try and ride a bicycle up a fucking mountain,

134
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:14.450
<v 2>okay?</v>

135
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.150
<v 3>For six fucking weeks in a row,
whatever the hell it is.</v>

136
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.910
You want to see them do that all natural,

137
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:22.910
that's going to be the most boring shit you've ever seen in your life.

138
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.450
You might as well watch me do it at that point,

139
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.660
my fucking head turning all red wheeze and just looking at the mountain.

140
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.680
All right?
It's some superhero shit.
Okay?
There's no fucking Santa Claus.

141
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.720
It's over.
All right.
Do you think this shit's going to end?

142
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:44.630
It's not going to end.
We're going to move on to bionic people next.

143
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.520
They're literally going to take out the bottom of people's legs below the

144
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:52.610
fucking kneecap and they're going to put a Strutton.
They're just like,

145
00:08:52.611 --> 00:08:56.020
they do want a car,
you know,
and then white people going

146
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.920
<v 0>to be Duncan and then black people will be like,
dude,
what the fuck?
You know,</v>

147
00:08:59.921 --> 00:09:04.330
give me some bionic legs and you have a fucking Michael Jordan with bionic legs.

148
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:04.541
Yeah.

149
00:09:04.541 --> 00:09:09.541
I'm telling you by 2030 the Goddamn back board and the NBA is going to be up

150
00:09:11.021 --> 00:09:13.420
where all those Celtics championship banners are.

151
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.310
<v 4>Okay.</v>

152
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:20.270
<v 0>That's my theory.
Give me a fucking break.
I was really rooting for that guy.</v>

153
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.670
Not that I like Cheetos.

154
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.750
It's you can't ride a bike 60 miles an hour up and down a fucking mount without

155
00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:31.210
being on.
So why is everybody acting like this is a surprise?

156
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.380
And then he's just see these fucking Douche bag people in the media,
right?

157
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.540
They all,
they all can't fucking wait to jump all over Lance Armstrong's why?

158
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:45.100
Because they sucked in gym class and you know,

159
00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:46.360
you know the deal in high school,

160
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.990
you don't get any pussy cause you got an a in creative writing.

161
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.370
All right?
And then these fucking little smarty kids,

162
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.450
they see these meathead athletes walking around with their fucking abs in that

163
00:09:58.451 --> 00:10:02.440
pex going,
ow,
ow,
fucking gimme the ball.
Right?

164
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.660
And they just sit there going,
why is she sucking the Dick?
That fucking moron.

165
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.950
And it just,
it bugs him
and they can't wait.

166
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.470
They can't wait for the day for one,

167
00:10:12.471 --> 00:10:16.760
one of them gets caught doing something for them to be fat and coming back to

168
00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:19.400
the reunion,
you know?
And they can be,
they're like,
oh,

169
00:10:19.401 --> 00:10:22.220
I fucking write for this paper,
Huh?

170
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.610
And then they go over to that cheerleader used to be good,

171
00:10:25.611 --> 00:10:28.280
now faces all fucking shiny with the botox,

172
00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:32.480
but he's still fucking grabs her by a fucking hair at this point.
Right.
You know,

173
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.150
he's got that,
you know that you're not an old lady,

174
00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:36.830
but you're not a young lady here.
You know,

175
00:10:36.831 --> 00:10:40.550
where it starts to be extremely flammable after all the years of highlight.

176
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:45.530
And it's like a fucking goddamn birds nest,
you know,

177
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.140
sort of a dude's hair cut at that point.

178
00:10:48.141 --> 00:10:50.630
But they added some sort of little flip to it,
you know?

179
00:10:50.631 --> 00:10:54.050
So it's still technically a feminine haircut and you're just fucking jamming it

180
00:10:54.051 --> 00:10:58.490
down towards your slacks,
right?
So this is what this Douche had to say.

181
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.770
This is what this,
oh,
by the way,
I forgot to say this at the top of the podcast.

182
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.900
This podcast is brought to you.

185
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.400
Huh?
Why would you want to read with someone can read it for you?

186
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:26.210
Why would you want to ride a bike up a damn mountain without having roids

187
00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:28.410
injected into you?
I don't want to do that.

188
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.770
There's a reason why people don't ride a bike to work when they live on the

189
00:11:31.771 --> 00:11:35.280
other side of a fucking mountain.
All right?
Cause it hurts your legs.

190
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.830
You need something beyond vitamins.

191
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:47.110
How fucking exciting is the Tour de France?
Fucking cool.
I love it.

192
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.640
I don't care that they're on roids.
Give them more fucking Roy.

193
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.160
Make them go faster.
One go fast.
I'll go fast.
They can go fast.

194
00:11:58.161 --> 00:11:59.060
I don't give a fuck.

195
00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.693
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

196
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.630
<v 0>All right,
so this is what?
This fucking Douche bag rope.
He's sitting there,
um,</v>

197
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.880
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
He goes,
it's most of basically lance tapped out.

198
00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:13.813
<v 4>All right.</v>

199
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.500
<v 0>He said,
I refuse to participate.</v>

200
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.860
If he saw this whole like basically it would seem that old show,

201
00:12:19.861 --> 00:12:20.760
this is your life.

202
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.750
It was just like the game show where everybody ever knew it was going to come

203
00:12:24.751 --> 00:12:28.680
walking out and rather than me and Lego rubber I Todd Yada ride at to grow.

204
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.090
It's not going to be that.

205
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:35.550
It's going to be a bunch of old people got him in his buttocks and he didn't

206
00:12:35.551 --> 00:12:39.510
want to deal with that,
which I can't blame them.
Um,

207
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.510
but I got to admit they were going after him the way they were going after

208
00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:46.470
Michael Jackson.
You know,
when I said he was fucking touching kids,

209
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.230
and I actually read an article one time is some fucking some Guy Rodney,

210
00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.100
he was sitting there and actually watch the trial as opposed to me who just kind

211
00:12:55.101 --> 00:12:58.730
of walk by TV's in the airport and looked at Michael's weird nose and we're
like,

212
00:12:58.731 --> 00:13:00.500
yeah,
he did it right.

213
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.590
This guy actually was at the trial and he said he couldn't believe that it

214
00:13:03.591 --> 00:13:07.220
actually went to trial.
That's how fucking week the case was.

215
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.530
You know,
that being said,

216
00:13:09.531 --> 00:13:13.830
I wouldn't leave a fucking bull frog with that maniac toward his fucking dad did

217
00:13:13.831 --> 00:13:15.680
to him.
But that's a whole different story.
It's probably a bad point.

218
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.680
That point actually probably just weakened my fucking argument here.
Anyways,

219
00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.920
this is what,
this fucking Douche who never got picked in gym class rope.

220
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.370
<v 4>Okay.</v>

221
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.190
<v 0>He's saying,
uh,
at this point he did okay.</v>

222
00:13:29.191 --> 00:13:33.860
And all his friends are going to come out and basically say that he did do it.

223
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.060
You know,
can you stop yelling at me now?
Fucking pussies.
Um,

224
00:13:39.061 --> 00:13:43.470
he goes at,
so anyways,
Armstrong show what the fuck was going to happen.
So it's,

225
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.130
the guy writes at this point,
at that point,
he did what he'd never done before.

226
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:52.460
He gave up the pug nation texts and continue to proclaim his innocence.

227
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.460
But when the time came for him to hear his friends and associates incriminate

228
00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:58.770
him and try to refute their accusations,

229
00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:03.710
I'm Sachsen said it just wasn't worth the trouble.
All right.
Uh,

230
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.930
he says are refused and Armstrong said,
I refuse to participate in the process.

231
00:14:06.931 --> 00:14:10.740
That is so one sided and unfair.
Um,

232
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.290
attempting a whatever you send instead,

233
00:14:13.291 --> 00:14:17.730
he's going to focus on serving people and families affected by cancer attempting

234
00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:21.780
to be the fittest 40 year old on the planet.
I love that.

235
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.290
The fact that he did roid somehow negates the fact that he came back from

236
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:30.270
basically you're going to die level cancer and had to leave one ball on a table.

237
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:31.830
You know what I mean?

238
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.670
I having the fact that he could even sit on a fucking bicycle seat ever again.

239
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.970
To me it's pretty fucking amazing.
You know,

240
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.010
I walk up my fucking stairs and,
and I'm winded.

241
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.620
Sending waste the results means he'll be stripped of every metal and title he

242
00:14:49.621 --> 00:14:52.250
won going back to August,
1998.

243
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.070
The exact fucking thing that this nerd writer wants,

244
00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.120
take away all these shiny stuff that I don't know how to win,
um,

245
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.290
is extraordinary career will be vaporized from the record books.

246
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.430
The apparently won't even be allowed to compete and sanction triathlons.

247
00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:10.700
His recent,
uh,
interest.
Um,

248
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.830
Blahblahblahblahblah and then he adds a shit.
Here he goes.

249
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.390
His most devoted admirers may take his word that he was being railroaded by a

250
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:23.180
vindictive body using unfair tactics,

251
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:28.130
but really what else could a guilty person say in the face of so much evidence?

252
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:34.130
What evidence that people were going to say he did it?
I don't get how,

253
00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:35.930
first of all,
it's what's,
what the fuck I don't get,

254
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:41.460
they had a hard on for this guy when he was winning.
You know,

255
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.480
you should have caught him then.

256
00:15:42.481 --> 00:15:45.120
One does the statute of limitations run out on the ship?

257
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:49.430
New evidence suggests.
What?

258
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:52.420
Did you just find a video of the guy fucking injecting them?
I don't know.

259
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:53.721
Anyways,

260
00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:58.520
the agency also found that blood tests from 2009 indicated he was doping.

261
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:03.110
None of that.
This is all fucking hearsay at this point.
Right.
Um,

262
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:07.160
his most devoted admirers may take his word that he was being railroaded by

263
00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:11.290
vindictive body using unfair tactics,
but really what else would it go to Bubba?

264
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:16.510
The story is a particular shame because Armstrong who survived the 1996 bought

265
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:17.690
with statistics,

266
00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:22.690
testicular cancer that had spread to his abdomen and lungs was such an

267
00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:25.790
inspiration to so many cancer victims.

268
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.550
He used his fame to found live strong,

269
00:16:28.551 --> 00:16:31.490
a foundation that provides support to victims of the disease.

270
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:36.140
So what are you telling me now that people who have cancer are now looking at

271
00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:40.490
this guy as if he's still not like a fucking hero?

272
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.920
The guy came back from ball cancer that had spread to his abdomen and his lungs

273
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.080
and won a fucking the best bike race,

274
00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:53.990
the hardest bike race on the planet.

275
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.200
He wanted seven years and a fucking row and Bang Shell Sheryl Crow.

276
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.170
Right?
You're telling me this guy's that's still a hero.

277
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.260
Let me ask you this person who wrote this fucking article.

278
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.280
Huh?
Let me ask you this.
What about you?

279
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:20.470
What have you ever fucking one that you can sit here and judge a guy like this

280
00:17:20.471 --> 00:17:21.760
didn't even fucking go to trial.

281
00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.510
And you can sit here and talk about this fucking guy like that.
How?

282
00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:27.890
What the fuck did you ever done?
Huh?
Everyone of your are.

283
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:31.660
You never cheated on any your articles.
You never cheated on your wife.

284
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.150
You never cheated on your taxes.
Go Fuck Yourself.

285
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.330
Why is this bothering me so much?
I don't,

286
00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:42.970
I don't even fucking know wides bugging me.
You know

287
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.590
at,
you know what it is.
If everybody else in the top 20 is doing shit,

288
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.880
they all got caught too.

289
00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.573
<v 4>All right</v>

290
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.590
<v 0>then.
It's a fucking level playing field.</v>

291
00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:02.840
He's so much fucking better than those other guys.
Not only did he win the race,

292
00:18:02.841 --> 00:18:04.130
you still couldn't even catch them.

293
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.680
You couldn't catch him on a bike or in the fucking lab.

294
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.330
All those other Bozos who just sitting there staring at his ass in the entire

295
00:18:13.331 --> 00:18:17.800
fucking race,
they all got caught,
right?
Whatever.
I'm trying

296
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.230
all,
there you go.

297
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.070
18 fucking minutes ranting and raving about a fucking bike race.
All right.

298
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:30.810
He voice everybody.

299
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.710
Would it be great if you could start a business in your cubicle without your

300
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:39.540
boss knowing about it?
You know?
Well,
how could I do that belt?
Well with he voice.

301
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.240
Um,
basically your mobile phone,

302
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.070
<v 4>okay.</v>

303
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.430
<v 0>It becomes like you,
you,
you can,
I don't know,
when I read the copy,</v>

304
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.150
I can't even explain this thing.
It's so mind blowing to an old guy like me.

305
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.240
It's basically,
you know,
your cell phone,
how you have,

306
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:59.130
you have one phone number and it rings.
And in order to get that phone to ring,

307
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.550
people have to know that number.
Would it be great if you could have like,

308
00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:03.390
I dunno,
five,

309
00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:06.810
10 other numbers and that phone would ring and no one knew your real number.

310
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.900
Wouldn't that be awesome?
Be a great way to start a business.

311
00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.680
What if they actually had professional voiceover actors that when you didn't

312
00:19:13.681 --> 00:19:14.580
pick up the phone,

313
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.820
it sounded like you had some sexy double o seven secretary and you were in this

314
00:19:20.761 --> 00:19:25.680
the coolest office ever yet it was just your cell phone.
Huh?

315
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.573
Let me tell you this,

316
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.270
one of the great features of each voice is everything I just said.

317
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.040
And it has music on hold.

318
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.670
Do they're creating this entire virtual office,

319
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.430
virtual phone numbers,
all of it.
It doesn't even exist,

320
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:44.180
man.
This is the greatest thing ever.
Uh,

321
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.680
makes your business seem even more professionals,
ie voice.

322
00:19:46.681 --> 00:19:49.230
We'll treat your clients and customers to music on hold.

323
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.770
You could even set up an e voice to run promotional advertisements for your

324
00:19:52.771 --> 00:19:55.950
company while people are on hold instead of music.

325
00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.980
All of this lending to your credibility as this wheeler and dealer sitting there

326
00:20:01.091 --> 00:20:05.760
smoking a stokey.
Uh,
Eva also has the call recording feature,

327
00:20:05.761 --> 00:20:09.330
which is perfect for any doctor,
lawyer,
real estate agents,

328
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.710
hiring managers or any other professional,
uh,
discussing contracts,

329
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:19.530
easy to use as you just press star two to start and start to,
to stop.

330
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.430
That's it.
Perfect.

331
00:20:20.431 --> 00:20:23.970
If you're driving and can't write something important down eve voice makes your

332
00:20:23.971 --> 00:20:28.080
life easier and seem more professional for your free six month trial,

333
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:33.110
go to www dot [inaudible] dot com slash bill burr www dot [inaudible] dot com

334
00:20:34.141 --> 00:20:38.700
slash bill burr or go to the banner ad on my podcast page at [inaudible] dot com

335
00:20:38.701 --> 00:20:41.310
we actually had a listener,
a raving about it,

336
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.710
starting his own business on,
on Twitter.
Sent me a great,
uh,

337
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.230
a great tweet about it.
I should,
I should really retweet that.

338
00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:52.550
But the people at a voice we're doing backflips,

339
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.270
they were so excited that somebody actually used it and,

340
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.150
and had the results that they claim.
So they go,

341
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:03.730
if you're trying to start your own business,
all right,
back to the podcast.

342
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.740
What else happened?
Oh,
the red sox.
The Red Sox had a fire sale.

343
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.170
I love it.
I got to tell you this.
I absolutely love it.

344
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:16.933
Okay.

345
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.950
And I'm just equating the red sox basically to van Halen.

346
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:23.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>

347
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:27.140
<v 0>This is basically what happened.
We had David Lee Roth,
everything was great.</v>

348
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.080
2004 maybe 2007 after we won the second one.

349
00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:34.690
That's like

350
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:41.420
2004 to 2007 that was like van Halen one all the way to 1984 alright.

351
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.780
And then what happened?
Tito left,

352
00:21:45.781 --> 00:21:49.140
David Lee left and now we got Sammy Hagar.

353
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.470
Now we just dumped all the players.

354
00:21:55.471 --> 00:22:00.000
So that's to me is like Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony art in the band anymore.

355
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.410
And now we got Gary Showrun.
Now Gary,
Sharon's in,
I don't know what to tell you.

356
00:22:04.411 --> 00:22:06.510
All I can tell you is this is what I love about this.

357
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.140
What I love about my own team,

358
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:15.240
just shitting the bed the way that they do is I love the empty seats.

359
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:16.500
<v 2>Okay?</v>

360
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.333
<v 0>I love it.</v>

361
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.760
I love seeing all the bandwagon go home like the bandwagon pussies that I knew

362
00:22:22.891 --> 00:22:26.780
you were.
You weren't there when we sucked.

363
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:31.550
You showed up when we started getting good and you wrote it out like all those

364
00:22:31.551 --> 00:22:36.551
fucking cunts who fill up the stadium now every time the Patriots play a game,

365
00:22:36.591 --> 00:22:39.770
where the fuck were you back when we had that shitty stadium with the aluminum

366
00:22:39.771 --> 00:22:42.910
seats?
Where were ya?
Huh?

367
00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.970
He would know where he was sitting at all drinking hot cocoa with your fucking

368
00:22:46.971 --> 00:22:48.530
slippers on.
You know,

369
00:22:48.531 --> 00:22:51.150
and I know a lot of people right now are probably going to be going,
yeah,

370
00:22:51.151 --> 00:22:55.610
good flow.
Good boy.
Stupid fucking shit.
Fuck,
fuck you all right.

371
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.370
Look at your own God damn state and you want to see what your fan base is.

372
00:22:58.371 --> 00:23:01.070
If you really want to see the true fan base of your team,

373
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:06.080
go to a game when they suck on any level.
Hockey,
basketball,
baseball,

374
00:23:06.081 --> 00:23:10.190
football,
rugby,
fucking tidily wakes,
whatever it is.

375
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:14.330
When your team sucks and the people that go,
those are the die hards.

376
00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.980
I can't believe this already.
MPC to Fenway park,

377
00:23:18.981 --> 00:23:22.010
up to everything that that team's done for that city.
Okay.

378
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:26.450
What were only 11 months in?
They've had an 11 month bad run.

379
00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:28.730
I was back there in Boston.

380
00:23:28.731 --> 00:23:33.350
All these fucking people crying and pissing and moaning,
bunch of fucking babies.

381
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:34.401
He went,

382
00:23:34.401 --> 00:23:38.510
the greatest thing about the bandwagon people leaving is I think it ups the

383
00:23:38.511 --> 00:23:43.490
chance of that stupid song to be discontinued during the seventh inning stretch.

384
00:23:43.491 --> 00:23:46.250
Is there any way we can sell that to the Dodgers too?

385
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.850
Is there any way we could just get rid of that?
Sweet care will lie.

386
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.030
Bob,
Bob,
Bob,
uh,

387
00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.310
you know,
if I was a dictator and I was looking to trim down the population,

388
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.900
I would play that song in,

389
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:09.020
in the public square with the banner of my face,
you know,
all around it.

390
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:12.351
And I would play that.

391
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:16.040
And whoever's sang along that would be at the black van would show up to your

392
00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:18.330
fucking house and you would be,
you would be a,

393
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.300
you would be automatically signed up for my re educational program,

394
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:28.940
which basically involves your skull being used as a fucking lamp post.

395
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.880
I'm sorry.
That's doesn't it makes it a lamp shade.
Maybe.

396
00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:34.550
I don't know what the fuck that's,
what am I trying to say?
A footstool.

397
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:39.020
There you go.
Um,
so I'm actually excited.
I think it's a great fucking thing.

398
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.420
I think it's great for the Red Sox,
Yankees rivalry.
You know,

399
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.120
red sox suck so much that they now,
now they don't have to fucking amp it up.

400
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.900
That deck,
the kind of face each other and then that can just,
you know,

401
00:24:50.901 --> 00:24:55.430
back off for a little bit and then maybe in a couple of years it gets good
again.

402
00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:55.790
You know,

403
00:24:55.790 --> 00:25:00.790
as opposed to be like they're meeting again 27 times this year to 100 million

404
00:25:04.251 --> 00:25:07.970
versus 180 who gives a fuck?
Dover.

405
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:14.230
So I want to thank the red sox for fucking back to like all the way from 1999

406
00:25:16.371 --> 00:25:18.410
on,
I haven't had a fucking problem with you guys.

407
00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:22.100
Spent fucking an absolute joy to watch you play.
All right.

408
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:26.320
It's been fucking great.
And now you're going through the rough times,
eh?

409
00:25:26.321 --> 00:25:28.670
You know,
I'm still going to watch.

410
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:33.850
I can't fucking wait to watch whatever the fuck his left to this tape play in

411
00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:37.640
September.
You know,
I don't know.
Why

412
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.500
can you,
can you people in Boston do me a favor.
Can you guys can,

413
00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:48.560
can we start a movement to start bullying that fucking song during the seventh

414
00:25:48.931 --> 00:25:53.460
inning stretch?
Can somebody start a website?
Could somebody,

415
00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.120
okay,
I'm late in the match.
Somebody go get the gas.

416
00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:58.883
Let's just,

417
00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:03.090
let's just go for a total clean slate here.

418
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.320
All right.
It's starting over again.
For some reason,
Bobby,

419
00:26:07.321 --> 00:26:10.380
this sticking with Bobby Vee,
I don't know why.

420
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.740
If for some reason the more he goes out and yells at Umpires,

421
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:18.360
I'm actually starting to like the guy.
Um,
all right,

422
00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:23.280
so he's on hold,
but can we,
can we just get rid of that fucking song?

423
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:26.031
You know,

424
00:26:26.031 --> 00:26:29.090
one of the great things I used to tease Yankee fans about was the fact that they

425
00:26:29.091 --> 00:26:32.750
sang [inaudible] during the seventh inning stretch.
Okay.

426
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.890
I never understood why they did it.
The,
the

427
00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.160
legendary franchise that it is.
I just,

428
00:26:41.161 --> 00:26:45.270
you sitting in this village people song and everybody in the stands is going,

429
00:26:45.271 --> 00:26:49.290
Whoa,
your MCA,
a Douche bags are Douche bags are not real Yankee fence.

430
00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:51.270
They're not doing it.
They're fucking sitting there,
you know,

431
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.750
I don't know what they're doing.
Pulling their hat down over their eyes.

432
00:26:54.751 --> 00:26:58.590
It's fucking embarrassing.
It's embarrassing.
Okay.

433
00:26:58.591 --> 00:27:02.040
But that's not my fucking problem.
Can we please,

434
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:08.640
as a red sox fan who started watching back when they actually had red hats,

435
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.860
that clown hat that they wore in the 70s,

436
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.930
first game I went to was in [inaudible] 78 the summer of 78,
by the way.
Um,

437
00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:21.820
what was it?
70 yeah,
78.
Yeah.
Can we please,

438
00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.240
let's start with the song.
Let's get rid of the song.

439
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.300
This will be like a fan fire sale.
We'll get,

440
00:27:28.301 --> 00:27:31.690
we'll start with the song and then next will be that fucking mascot.

441
00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.370
Okay.
And uh,

442
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.310
and I don't know where to go from there cause I don't live there anymore.

443
00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.360
Those two fucking things annoy the shit out of me.

444
00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.260
Get that struggling actor out of that fucking suit.
Okay.

445
00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.370
I hate mascots.
I've said this before.

446
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.430
I hate when you talk to them when there's no kids around and they still won't

447
00:27:55.431 --> 00:27:59.760
say anything
and you're like,
hey,
what's going on?
And they do that fucking,

448
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:05.460
you know,
I smoke crystal meth.
Fucking psycho.
Nod at you.

So,

493
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.193
<v 2>okay.</v>

494
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:47.800
<v 3>See my dog.
My dog is so adorable.
Just laying there sleeping.</v>

495
00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.930
You want to hear us?
She sounds when she's sleeping.
You know what?

496
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:53.650
I'm not gonna cause I'm a put it the microphone up to her nose and all it's

497
00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:56.740
gonna do is gonna wake her up and you guys are not going to see how adorable she

498
00:30:56.741 --> 00:30:59.520
is because this is not a visual medium in case you haven't noticed.

499
00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:06.540
So I'm really gonna do it was just wake her up.
Um,
anyways,

500
00:31:06.541 --> 00:31:08.790
I've been off this whole week.

501
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.110
I'm off next week and then it's fucking on.

502
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:17.190
I'm torn like a Goddamn band,
speaking of which,

503
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.220
I saw truth and salvage company at the troubadour on a Friday night.

504
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.250
And uh,
if you get a chance to see those guys live,

505
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:31.280
if you sick of auto tune and a bunch of people acting like this singing but then

506
00:31:31.551 --> 00:31:34.500
not singing because they got to do a bunch of dance steps.

507
00:31:34.501 --> 00:31:39.180
If you would just like to see a band of talented musicians,

508
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.390
everybody in the band can sing their asses off.
It's

509
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:45.070
<v 2>okay.</v>

510
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.550
<v 3>It's everything that's great about music.
Um,
first of all,</v>

511
00:31:48.551 --> 00:31:50.500
I never been to the troubadour and I always heard about that.

512
00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:53.680
Obviously being a guns and roses fan.
So before I went over there,
AH,

513
00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.370
look it up on um,
on,
on Wikipedia,

514
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:01.510
I will try to give you a link or something like that for it.
Um,

515
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:04.750
but just the amount of people that started out there.

516
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.030
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

517
00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.370
<v 3>You know,
it just,
it just was mind blowing.</v>

518
00:32:08.371 --> 00:32:11.910
All those singer songwriter people that were out in La and lived in Laurel

519
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:16.500
Canyon,
the Joni Mitchell's a James Taylor is all the way through.

520
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.340
Right through to,
who else did they have there?
I can't remember.

521
00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:24.040
It was just a WHO's who of everybody.

522
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.340
And then guns and roses of course perform there.

523
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.880
Back when Axel had like two tattoos,
they got all the pictures on the wall.

524
00:32:30.881 --> 00:32:32.860
So I was psyched to go there.
I thought was gonna be this huge place.

525
00:32:32.861 --> 00:32:36.490
It only held like maybe 350 people really intimate setting.

526
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:40.080
And I went down there and they absolutely smashed it.
And,
uh,
they

527
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.490
<v 0>were actually out here recording a new album,
truth and salvage company.</v>

528
00:32:43.491 --> 00:32:46.880
Check them out if you like real music.
All right?

529
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.430
And that wasn't a paid advertisement that came from the fucking hot.
All right,

530
00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:57.170
here we go.
So anyways,
I am on the road traveling like a band.
All right.

531
00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.630
Not this pussy comedy shit where it's one week.

532
00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:02.840
And then I sit at home staring at my toes and then maybe I'll do another two

533
00:33:02.841 --> 00:33:06.170
days.
This is hardcore.
I am traveling,

534
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:10.310
I believe for the next fucking six weeks.

535
00:33:10.311 --> 00:33:15.150
Maybe every weekend I'm working.
All right.
Uh,

536
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.100
here we go.
Orlando Improv.
September 7th,
eighth and ninth.

537
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.300
You know,
it was gonna try to go to a gator's game.
Florida gators,
right.

538
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:28.090
Drive up and go to game course to fucking not playing sons of bitches.
Um,

539
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:30.890
is there anything else near there?
The Seminoles,
what are the fuck do they play?

540
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.580
I got to see some Florida College football when I'm there.
I'm in Orlando.

544
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.690
I love saying that I just coming back to New York,

545
00:33:50.691 --> 00:33:54.170
but I call it my triumphant return is if I went off and conquered something,

546
00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:58.280

00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:22.250
To to be a feature act.
Something he doesn't do.

552
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:27.240
He's just doing it for a pal.
Something he's way beyond this.

553
00:34:27.241 --> 00:34:29.090
Guys sold millions of records.
Everybody,

554
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.390
millions of Joey Rose's fans can not be wrong.

555
00:34:32.391 --> 00:34:36.980
He's going to be in the feature act and a opening is a one of my new favorite

556
00:34:36.981 --> 00:34:39.800
comics out there as this kid Sean patent.
He's fucking awesome.

557
00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.760
So that's going to be a great show.
All right.
And then the week after that,

558
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:48.290
I'm going to be at the comedy zone in Jacksonville,
Florida.
Okay.

559
00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:52.040
How about a little pause here in a round of applause for the amount of white

560
00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:57.041
trash people I am going to be serving and dancing for in fucking September or

00:34:59.721 --> 00:35:04.130
Lando Florida.
Who goes there?
Unless you going to Disney world,
nobody.

562
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.170
Maybe if you're a whore and you want to blow tiger woods,
I don't know,

563
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:12.500
Comedy Zone,

564
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:17.000

567
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.160
Okay?
You tell me this should be a jet ski at the end of this fucking tour.

568
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:36.170
It's all I'm saying after that,
I go to go bananas in Cincinnati,
Ohio.

569
00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.740
All right?
You want it that Cincinnati is one of those cities that even people in

570
00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:44.790
Cincinnati don't go to the leaf.
It's one of those cities,
right?

571
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:48.780
At five o'clock everybody leaves Zombie fucking town.
Just like Cleveland,

572
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:53.500
just like Buffalo,
just like all of those fucking rust belt,

573
00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:55.800
God damn towns.
People just leave,

574
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:57.260
<v 4>okay?</v>

575
00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.100
<v 0>And I'm sitting there walking down the street.
It's scary,</v>

576
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:04.880
but I'm going to be there at gold bananas.

577
00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.510
Then after that I go to fucking Sydney,
Australia.

578
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:11.510
Hopefully I go to Sydney,
Australia,

579
00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:15.230
the fucking breaking my balls with all the shit they want me to give him.
So,
um,

580
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:19.190
I actually set this tore up because I thought my special was going to be coming

581
00:36:19.191 --> 00:36:22.400
out October 1st.
But the people at Netflix,
we're so damn excited,

582
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.270
there's such great people.
They're like,
Bill,
why don't we put it out now?

583
00:36:26.271 --> 00:36:28.790
What are we waiting for?
I said,
okay.
Right.

584
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:32.890
So now I've got all these fucking back to back dates to put together my new
hour.

585
00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:37.280
Um,
so please come down,
say hello.

586
00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:42.310
Laugh at a couple of jokes too for one Joey roses telling you what have you and

587
00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.120
what in his final engagement is a feature act.

588
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.200
Um,
all right,
what else do we got here?
If did I tell you guys?

589
00:36:54.201 --> 00:36:56.030
I'm trying to learn how to make homemade pizza.

590
00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.480
How bad do I need to just have a fucking kid already?

591
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.590
How many more hobbies can I start?
Oh,
look who's up.

592
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:09.440
It's Cleo.
Give me a buddy.
Come here.
Come over here,

593
00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:13.980

You know,

594
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:18.870
Even coming over here being all needy and the one time I call you when the

595
00:37:18.871 --> 00:37:21.990
Goddamn microphones on you won't come over right once.

596
00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:23.430
I know we always use this reference,

597
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:27.660
but it's like that God damn frog right member was singing for that construction

598
00:37:27.661 --> 00:37:30.850
worker and that cartoon.
Hello my baby.
Hello my honey.
Right.

599
00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:35.230
Let me go to show it to people and it just go burr.
I yeah,

600
00:37:35.231 --> 00:37:36.400
I'm trying to learn how to make pizza.

601
00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.680
If anybody has a good recipe for a sauce cause that's where it's all about that

602
00:37:40.681 --> 00:37:44.800
in the fucking crust.
All right.
I don't even,

603
00:37:44.801 --> 00:37:48.610
what the fuck I'm talking about anymore?
Let's plow ahead here.
Uh,
what do I have?

604
00:37:48.611 --> 00:37:51.850
What else have I written down here that I want to talk about?
Bombing.
Oh Jesus.

605
00:37:51.851 --> 00:37:52.870
I hate my balls.

606
00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:58.140
Hit the comedy store Saturday night just for like the first like minute and a

607
00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.870
half,
cause you know what I was doing,
I was opening with,

608
00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:02.870
<v 4>okay.</v>

609
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:03.291
<v 0>The bit,</v>

610
00:38:03.291 --> 00:38:06.080
that's all my new special that I opened with the fact that I was talking about

611
00:38:06.081 --> 00:38:07.040
wanting to get a gun.

612
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:08.240
<v 4>Okay.</v>

613
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.880
<v 0>So I just Kinda,
you know,
had always been open with that.</v>

614
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:14.120
And now that my specials out there,
I'm so delusional.

615
00:38:14.121 --> 00:38:17.630
I just automatically assumed that everyone who's ever going to go to a comedy

616
00:38:17.631 --> 00:38:19.580
club,
my dog needs a bath

617
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:26.110
here.
An itching cleo enough,
come here,
get over here.

618
00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:32.010
So anyways,
I've been,
um,
sorry,

619
00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:33.480
I got to give her the old next scratch here.

620
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:36.183
<v 4>Okay.</v>

621
00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.890
<v 0>Hey,
you go,
there you go.
Your mother fucker.
Get out of here.
Um,</v>

622
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.930
yeah,
so have been opening with that.
So then I was like,
well,
it's been on once.

623
00:38:44.931 --> 00:38:47.750
It's on TV,
I can't,
I gotta I gotta dump the joke.

624
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:52.550
So had this weird thing where I was going out there and I knew everything that I

625
00:38:52.551 --> 00:38:54.770
was going to talk about.
I just didn't know how I was going to open with,

626
00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:59.390
so I was like,
oh,
just fucking,
I dunno.
I wasn't feeling funny.

627
00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:03.560
And it was a,
it was a long,
two,

628
00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:07.110
three minutes before it kind of got it going.
And then I was like,

629
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:10.720
it just wasn't clicking for me.
Um,

630
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:13.070
<v 4>okay.</v>

631
00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:15.920
<v 0>You know,
something,
it really wasn't even a part of like building a new hour.</v>

632
00:39:15.921 --> 00:39:18.740
It just had to do with the fact that I haven't been on stage for a minute and

633
00:39:18.741 --> 00:39:22.370
it's just like going to the gym.
I was getting winded and might,
Cleo,

634
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.280
are you gonna fucking scratch for the rest of the podcast?

635
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:28.370
You need a bath,
you know that?

636
00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:30.430
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

637
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:34.060
<v 0>You need a bath.
Go back to sleep.
You were doing great.</v>

638
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.600
She fucking dog.
I swear to God,
this thing,

639
00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.620
it's sleeps like 20 hours a day,

640
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.261
you know,

641
00:39:43.261 --> 00:39:46.650
all this shit that they say about pit bulls being vicious and that type of
thing.

642
00:39:46.651 --> 00:39:50.960
I don't know when they do it
all you really have to do,

643
00:39:50.961 --> 00:39:51.830
if you get a dog,

644
00:39:51.831 --> 00:39:56.540
like he's just watch it for that critical four hours when it's awake and you got

645
00:39:56.541 --> 00:40:01.010
it,
you're fine.
Um,
all right,
let's,

646
00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.960
let's get to a God damn question here.
Advice,

647
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:07.570
exotic pets.
Uh,

648
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.920
Bill last week I was laid off from my office cubicle job of four years.

649
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:17.440
I am now a 25 year old unemployed college student.
Trug struggling to make rent.

650
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:20.560
Ah,
Jesus.
My heart goes out to your brother.
Aleisha 25.

651
00:40:20.561 --> 00:40:22.930
You're not fucking married.
You don't have any kids.
That's the bright side.

652
00:40:22.931 --> 00:40:24.310
And I know you don't need to hear that.

653
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.963
<v 4>All right.</v>

654
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:28.481
<v 0>All right.
Here we go.</v>

655
00:40:28.481 --> 00:40:33.190
Can't go back to my parents as they are halfway across the planet and Taiwan.

656
00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.770
Now my question is do I continue to,

657
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:40.990
do I continue trying to get back in the rat race or do I follow my dream of

658
00:40:40.991 --> 00:40:44.530
becoming an exotic pet reptile breeder?

659
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.870
Jesus' crowd,
a fuckboy or you just fucking with me.

660
00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.150
This is your dream.
Well,
you know what you are from Taiwan.

661
00:40:53.151 --> 00:40:56.030
I imagine everything that's considered exotic over here is like nothing.

662
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:58.263
<v 4>You know,</v>

663
00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.380
<v 0>I bet over in Taiwan,
instead of getting like a bicycle as a four year old,</v>

664
00:41:02.381 --> 00:41:06.360
they give you like a defanged Cobra or some shit.
Um,

665
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:15.460
I'm sorry,
I just had to stop and laugh at the ignorance of that statement.
Um,

666
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:19.240
anyways,
I have no experience in the field.
Fantastic.

667
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:24.400
You're going to be on spike TV's a thousand ways to die except okay.

668
00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:28.330
Except that okay.
I have no experience in the field except for that.

669
00:41:28.331 --> 00:41:32.080
I have a snake in four hamsters as pets.

670
00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:35.900
<v 3>All right,
dude.
I don't want to burst your bubble,</v>

671
00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:38.300
but there's nothing exotic about hamsters.

672
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:43.070
Even if you have four or quatro.
Sorry,

673
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.490
I started the new fucking Rosetta stone Spanish again.
Hmm.

674
00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.940
You'll Dango on paddle.
It's Greece.
A Blanco.

675
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:55.170
Beto is Bueno.
Is local a local,
whoever the fuck you say it.

676
00:41:55.171 --> 00:41:57.210
My dogs out of its mind.
Um,

677
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:04.470
Lamo hair
among sign of their day.

678
00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.810
Um,
I've been,
let's get back to this shit.

679
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.770
Like I just said,
the woman and then green apple,

680
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.310
there's really nothing that connected either one of those.
Oh,
go fuck yourself.

681
00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.980
I'm going to do it.
At some point in my life I'm going to become bilingual.

682
00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:24.240
So anyways,
it's do wants to start raising exotic pets,
breeding them.

683
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:27.240
He has no experience.
Now what kind of fucking snake do you have?

684
00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.260
You know,
if you have a garden snake gardener,
snake.

685
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:32.580
I guess you got to start somewhere.

686
00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:38.810
You do have a reptile and a four little rat thinks this is cool,

687
00:42:39.361 --> 00:42:41.820
dude.
You know what you're doing.
You're doing like the open mics of this.

688
00:42:41.821 --> 00:42:43.650
I get it.
You've got to start slow.

689
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:49.110
You can't start right with the Black Mamba getting,
get yourself killed.

690
00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:50.221
Anyways,
he said,

691
00:42:50.221 --> 00:42:53.730
I've been to the reptile expo a couple of times and saw that vendors,

692
00:42:53.731 --> 00:42:58.170
they're just breed and sell snakes for a living and thought to myself,
Holy Shit,

693
00:42:58.171 --> 00:42:59.004
I want to do that.

694
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.830
Encourage animals to bang and sell the offspring all from my own apartment.

695
00:43:04.831 --> 00:43:09.510
Living the dream.
What to do.
Any advice?
Uh,

696
00:43:09.511 --> 00:43:12.830
what gave you the balls to start stand up?
Um,

697
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:17.550
understanding the opportunity cost of the income of a full time job.
Uh,

698
00:43:17.551 --> 00:43:20.580
any advice would help.
Thanks Mr. Burn.
All right.

699
00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:25.550
All right.
What do you do here?
Well Dude,
you're,
you're doing the right thing.

700
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.270
You basically like you,

701
00:43:28.271 --> 00:43:32.060
you go into one of those a reptile expos and looking at the Douche bags there

702
00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:33.230
when it,
and being like,

703
00:43:33.231 --> 00:43:36.370
I could fucking do that was like me when I used to watch some of those standup

704
00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:39.620
shows and be like,
I'm funnier than this guy.
All right.

705
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.070
And you have the luxury of not having a job right now,

706
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.500
so you don't have to worry about,
you know,
well,

707
00:43:45.501 --> 00:43:49.410
what if this interferes with my job?
You don't have a fucking job.
Um,

708
00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:53.480
your biggest thing right now,
dude,
is you need income.
All right?

709
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:58.760
So I would continue looking for a job that is flexible.

710
00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:04.660
All right?
While you start building your stockpile of reptiles,

711
00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:08.290
first thing I would do is I would go on the Internet and I would read as much as

712
00:44:08.291 --> 00:44:12.070
humanly possible.
I would go to how to make two snakes,

713
00:44:12.071 --> 00:44:14.290
fuck.com I would start,

714
00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:17.470
I don't know what to tell you,
dude.

715
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:22.180
I would just keep going to those expos like they're open mics.

716
00:44:22.181 --> 00:44:26.350
I would keep reading up on it.
I would try and find,
uh,
this is what you do.

717
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.910
This is what you do.

718
00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:32.040
Act like you want to buy a fucking snake and go to fucking dude

719
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.280
<v 0>and ask them how they got into the business.
As you pretend like,
you know,</v>

720
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:39.270
like you're browsing and maybe you can get a job working for one of those guys.

721
00:44:39.271 --> 00:44:42.000
You figured out what the fuck he's doing,
right?

722
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:47.090
You pull a Joe Kennedy that I've learned reading in the wonderful book the sins

723
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:52.350
of the father.
Um,
yeah,
that guy used to work every place.

724
00:44:52.351 --> 00:44:54.780
He'd worked at a place for like seven months,
two years.

725
00:44:54.781 --> 00:44:58.710
He'd rifle through all the files,
get all this insider information,

726
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:02.610
make a boatload of cash and leave the fucking company in the shitter.

727
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.170
Okay?
Now I'm not saying to do that,
but fucking work with,
for these other guys,

728
00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:12.150
figuring out what they're doing,
do what they're doing,
become better at it.

729
00:45:12.151 --> 00:45:15.510
That's what I would do if you really want to do this shit.
I would,
but uh,

730
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.150
I gotta tell you this man,
um,

731
00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:24.330
I don't know how you make two pit vipers fuck each other,
but uh,

732
00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.960
I would definitely get a,
uh,

733
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.710
I dunno if I get a thick pair of gloves

734
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:35.360
hi to reptiles even get turned on.

735
00:45:35.361 --> 00:45:37.760
They just have that fucking look on their face.
Like,

736
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.730
you don't know what they're thinking.
You know,

737
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.860
I'll tell you if snakes had fucking hands,

738
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.100
like they would win world series of poker every year,

739
00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.920
there'd be no fucking way to tell what it had said.

740
00:45:48.921 --> 00:45:50.480
Holding shit is he got a full house.

741
00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:55.040
It can't fucking sit there sticking his tongue out at me.
Uh,
should I go bill,

742
00:45:55.041 --> 00:45:55.700
I need your help.

743
00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:59.720
Obviously I must have some real issues to be seeking advice from a standup

744
00:45:59.721 --> 00:46:01.250
comedian,
but here it goes.
You know what,
dude,

745
00:46:01.251 --> 00:46:04.880
that's one of the truest things that's ever been said.
Um,

746
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:07.531
anyways,
you know something,

747
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:10.980
I was talking to Bobby Lee this weekend who I'm going to have on the podcast.

748
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.150
I love the guy to death.

749
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:17.190
And he said a couple of really nice things to me and we were backstage and as I

750
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:21.240
went to return the compliments,
he literally imploded in,

751
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:23.860
ran out of the room just at the,
the,

752
00:46:23.861 --> 00:46:26.370
the thought of hearing me say something nice about him.

753
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:30.870
And I just laughed because he was making a joke about it,
but he was seriously,

754
00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:35.871
he seriously left and slammed the door as I was mid complimenting him and left

755
00:46:37.021 --> 00:46:38.490
me in this room by myself.

756
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:44.340
And I just laughed out loud to myself and just said,
fucking comedians.

757
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:45.541
So sir,

758
00:46:45.541 --> 00:46:49.320
you're 100% right to sit there and be to seek advice from a standup comedian.

759
00:46:49.321 --> 00:46:54.150
You gotta be Outta your mind.
But this advice is free.
Here we go.

760
00:46:54.151 --> 00:46:57.570
A couple of years ago,
I decided to travel the world.
He says,
due to boredom,

761
00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:00.030
or she says,
who the fuck knows?
Uh,

762
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.810
due to Borden and just a general feeling of unhappiness,

763
00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:09.420
God's a good thing to do.
I needed to get away.
Everything went great from there.

764
00:47:09.421 --> 00:47:10.800
I met so many good people,

765
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:14.340
enjoyed my time and other countries and ended up feeling so much better in the

766
00:47:14.341 --> 00:47:19.110
end.
Uh,
yeah,
dude,
you had an adventure.
I said,

767
00:47:19.111 --> 00:47:24.060
I recently decided to go home for a visit before continuing on and it ended up

768
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:28.080
in a disaster.
Oh,

769
00:47:28.081 --> 00:47:30.130
so you were still traveling world and decided to go

770
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.010
<v 3>home or you were back in the states and decided to go to your hometown?</v>

771
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:36.780
I don't know.
Either way.
You went home from wherever the hell you were at.
Uh,

772
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:37.990
my parents were fighting.

773
00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:42.340
Most of my friends had either changed or left and it turned out to be a real

774
00:47:42.341 --> 00:47:45.220
shitty time for me.
The question is,

775
00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:47.770
am I wrong to want to travel still,

776
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:52.000
I am leaving again straight away and most people I know are making me feel

777
00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:55.060
terrible that I want to leave.
It's nothing personal.

778
00:47:55.061 --> 00:47:58.740
I just don't feel happy here and I really missed the friends that I made and

779
00:47:58.741 --> 00:47:59.620
other places.

780
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:05.400
Should I make the people feel bad or is it time to tell them to suck a big fat

781
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:06.364
one?

782
00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.430
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

783
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.581
<v 3>Oh,</v>

784
00:48:07.581 --> 00:48:11.990
should I let people make me feel bad or is it time to tell them to suck the big

785
00:48:11.991 --> 00:48:14.810
fat one?
Ah,
dude,
you're following your heart.
It's a great story.

786
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.823
You should go for it.

787
00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:20.180
And you learned the awful lesson that everybody has to learn is that you can

788
00:48:20.181 --> 00:48:22.700
never go home.
Okay.

789
00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:26.510
Because people move on,
people change.

790
00:48:26.511 --> 00:48:29.930
You walk into that bar and you're not going to see anybody that you know
anymore.

791
00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:33.350
And if you do,
they're going to be a lot fatter and a lot sadder.

792
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:38.030
Something awful is going to happen.
You know,
they ruptured this spleen.

793
00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:41.680
You just don't want to do it.
You just don't want to do it,

794
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.393
you know?

795
00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:46.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

796
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:47.960
<v 3>So go live your life.</v>

797
00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:50.570
The reason why you feel happy when you're out there traveling,

798
00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.460
I feel is cause you following your heart.

799
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:55.310
You listening to that voice that's telling you what to do.

800
00:48:55.311 --> 00:48:58.700
You go back to that town.
Everybody's negative.
People are fighting course.

801
00:48:58.701 --> 00:49:01.120
They don't want you to leave.
They don't want you to make something yourself.

802
00:49:01.121 --> 00:49:06.050
Cause it's still sitting there sipping on a fucking Milla.
So yeah,

803
00:49:06.051 --> 00:49:09.110
you don't have to tell him to suck a big fat one.
You just see like,
you know,

804
00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:10.250
this is what I want to do,

805
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:14.330
and then just send them cards from all over the world and then I'll make him

806
00:49:14.331 --> 00:49:17.180
even more angry as they sit there watching you get blown in Venice,

807
00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:20.480
I one of those fucking boats with that dude and the stripe shirt,

808
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:23.180
he's not blowing you.
Of course.

809
00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.570
It's some other chick with a mole right above her lip and he sitting there

810
00:49:26.571 --> 00:49:29.090
singing a song,
try and drown out the side of her sucking your Dick.

811
00:49:29.091 --> 00:49:32.570
That's basically how it goes down.
Is that a good picture?
You know?

812
00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:35.100
<v 2>Okay,</v>

813
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.020
<v 3>Hey,
you know what?
Why don't you fucking go travel,</v>

814
00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:40.170
go buy some exotic snakes and sell them to that other dude is trying to sell is

815
00:49:40.171 --> 00:49:43.710
to start his business.
Then you take the money that you made,
right,

816
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.110
and you fucking use that to travel more.

817
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:50.670
See that connecting via the podcast.
All right,

818
00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.670
we got a fat fuck redemption.
We got a redemption here.

819
00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:58.470
This is a nice shout out to Wa tosh point.
Oh,
this guy's obviously a touch point.

820
00:49:58.471 --> 00:50:03.300
Oh Fan.
I'm not trying to steal anything from that show fat fuck redemption bill.

821
00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:07.680
I'm a 35 year old guy and I've been a big fat fuck for most of my life.
Well,

822
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:10.410
you know what sir?
The first step is admitting it.

823
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.670
The fact that you can call yourself a big fat fuck.
You know,

824
00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:19.930
like me,
when I go through my periods,
when I know I need to quit drinking,

825
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.700
it's what I say to myself.
Oh,
Billy fat again,
big fucking stupid.

826
00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.350
Fucking a head full of booze,

827
00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:33.030
<v 4>big John Travolta.
Fucking head loser.
Stop your drinking.
That's what I do.</v>

828
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:37.890
Or else I won't listen to myself.
Is this podcast going off the rails?

829
00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:41.580
I feel like I can't even think right now.
Um,
anyways,

830
00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:46.410
I developed an amazing set of breasts.
It's tender age of 13.

831
00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:51.000
All right.
This is a guy who had just had a look at the name,
uh,

832
00:50:51.001 --> 00:50:54.420
that still puts both of my sisters racks to shame.

833
00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:58.700
Four to 20 pounds was my heaviest by ml.

834
00:50:58.701 --> 00:51:03.701
So six foot seven and bill white and built like the Iris Sasquatch.

835
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:08.760
So I carry it pretty well.
You see what I'm saying?

836
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:13.760
This is why this guy is so funny.
He had equal tits at 13.
He's six foot seven.

837
00:51:13.761 --> 00:51:15.030
He's 420 pounds.

838
00:51:15.031 --> 00:51:18.240
There's no way to not look like that and not be a funny motherfucker.

839
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:23.160
I'm about 10 years ago,
I dropped 150 pounds through,
uh,

840
00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:27.990
through diet and exercise.
I had a whole new life,
new career,

841
00:51:27.991 --> 00:51:32.700
beautiful women,
the whole Shebang.
I had a a good seven year run.

842
00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:37.880
Yeah,
dude,
that's great man.
Seven years.
You're funny motherfucker.

843
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:42.090
You're six foot seven.
They probably feel like they're being held by a big bear.

844
00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:45.030
You make them feel safe.
The next thing you know the fucker.
Yeah,

845
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:49.750
I totally see it.
Totally see it.
So anyways,
he said,

846
00:51:49.751 --> 00:51:52.950
so here's my dilemma.
About three years ago,

847
00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:57.660
I got off the track and put a lot of the weight back on and haven't had a

848
00:51:57.661 --> 00:52:01.080
girlfriend the whole time.
Mostly by choice.
Ah,

849
00:52:01.081 --> 00:52:04.620
you went to some self-loathing thing back in the groove.

850
00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:07.140
Now dropping the weight and getting healthy again.

851
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.070
I want to settle down and start something serious with the woman of my dreams.

852
00:52:11.071 --> 00:52:15.270
But I still have about 50,
60 pounds to work off.
In a perfect world,

853
00:52:15.271 --> 00:52:18.630
it would be all about inner beauty and personality and shit.

854
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:21.750
But let's be realistic.
A smart,
talented,

855
00:52:21.751 --> 00:52:25.960
good looking health conscious woman is just not going to settle for a dude who

856
00:52:25.961 --> 00:52:30.500
was swinging around bigger tits than her.
Huh?

857
00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:36.670
<v 3>You know what,
dude?
Personality goes a long way,
but you're,</v>

858
00:52:36.671 --> 00:52:39.700
you're 100% right when you're talking about the man tits,

859
00:52:39.701 --> 00:52:42.760
you got to get rid of him.
He says,

860
00:52:42.761 --> 00:52:47.080
I suck at casual dating and I tend to get sucked into longterm relationships

861
00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:50.170
very easily.
Uh,
so my question is,

862
00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:55.270
do I wait till I'm in the prime shape again before I start getting serious with

863
00:52:55.271 --> 00:52:59.650
anyone?
Uh,
I'm not trying to be perfect,
but I'm not looking for perfection,

864
00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:04.180
but I just want to be smart about it.
What do you think about the brick top?

865
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:05.740
Um,
all right.

866
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:10.860
You have to learn how to not only are you losing weight,
but you got,

867
00:53:10.861 --> 00:53:13.560
you got to learn how to date,
dude.
All right.

868
00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:17.520
You've addressed that you're a fat fuck and you're dealing with that.

869
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.950
You also got address that you're,
uh,

870
00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.260
you're codependent and you're fucking lonely.
All right?

871
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.850
And it sucks if you codependent,
you're a relationship guy,

872
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:32.210
so it's very easy for you to get sucked into relationships.
But

873
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:38.360
<v 0>you know,
you can't take the first and it comes down the pike.
Uh,</v>

874
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:39.800
<v 4>okay.</v>

875
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.390
<v 3>So what you,
you,
you listen to deal.</v>

876
00:53:41.391 --> 00:53:43.670
You so know that you get sucked into relationship.

877
00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:45.860
This is what I think that you're like,
all right.

878
00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.380
So if I'm going to get sucked into a relationship,

879
00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.750
I have to look the best that I can possibly look.

880
00:53:50.751 --> 00:53:54.510
So when I do get sucked into a relationship,
I got a fucking,
you know,

881
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:56.230
top shelf girl that I'm doing it with.

882
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.863
<v 4>MMM.</v>

883
00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:01.730
<v 3>I Dunno.
I don't think that that's going to work.
Personally.</v>

884
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.610
I think you need to learn how to date.
Just go out and start dating

885
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:10.520
<v 0>and,
and I,
and why don't you say that?
I would say that on the date.</v>

886
00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:14.690
So where's this going?
Uh,
just be like,
you know what,
I'm in a period of my life,

887
00:54:14.691 --> 00:54:18.920
what I'm trying to learn how to date.
What does,
what does that mean?

888
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:20.450
<v 3>It means that I'm one of those.</v>

889
00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.660
I'm a relationship guy and I tend to get sucked into relationships.
And,
uh,

890
00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:25.251
next thing you know,

891
00:54:25.251 --> 00:54:28.550
I'm in a relationship with someone I should have just had one or two dates with.

892
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.570
<v 0>So,
you know,
I'm not trying to be a,</v>

893
00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:38.070
I'm just being upfront.
That's where I'm at right now.
So,
uh,

894
00:54:38.071 --> 00:54:42.510
I have a list of questions and judging by your answers,
uh,

895
00:54:42.511 --> 00:54:44.460
will depend with,
there's going to be date number two.

896
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:49.910
You don't have to say that last part,
but uh,

897
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:52.650
definitely you gotta you gotta you gotta come at it that way,
man.

898
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:56.940
Just come right out of the gate like that.
You know something,

899
00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:01.680
you'll get some fucking ass.
Even with your God damn tits talking like that.

900
00:55:01.681 --> 00:55:05.280
You walk into a bar,
right?
You sit there,
you already got a sense of humor.

901
00:55:05.281 --> 00:55:06.510
You make them fucking laugh.

902
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:11.190
Some girls eventually gonna come walking up to you some mess or maybe some

903
00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:15.900
fucking borderline QT.
They're insecure to,
you know,

904
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.380
maybe they don't like their fucking ass.
Who knows what,
right?

905
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.440
They come walking up to you as to what's your deal?
What are you doing?

906
00:55:22.441 --> 00:55:24.500
Just sitting there,
you know,

907
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:27.570
and he'd just start talking about there's nothing to fucking broad likes better

908
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:31.800
than some fucking guy who was sitting there who's actually taken stock in

909
00:55:31.801 --> 00:55:36.540
himself,
who seems like he's going to start taking life seriously.
Okay.

910
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:41.010
Cause they look at us and they see us for the morons that we are led by our

911
00:55:41.011 --> 00:55:44.550
dicks playing in mud,
puddles breaking shit,

912
00:55:44.551 --> 00:55:46.590
acting like a bunch of fucking gorillas.

913
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.910
So when they see somebody who's actually sitting there contemplating,

914
00:55:50.911 --> 00:55:53.310
but where the fuck that go on in life and what they want,

915
00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:57.090
they're attracted to it.
Not to mention you six foot seven,

916
00:55:57.091 --> 00:55:59.580
they're going to feel safe and then they gotta be wondering,
well,

917
00:55:59.581 --> 00:56:02.040
is this deck five foot seven?
Right?

918
00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:06.130
So he just hit him with that line.
What are you doing?

919
00:56:06.131 --> 00:56:07.410
I'm trying to figure life up.

920
00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.390
I have to learn how to date and there'll be all over it.

921
00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:14.860
What do you mean daddy's easy?
You should have by an ex,
you know,

922
00:56:14.861 --> 00:56:16.150
are fucking hands on your thigh,

923
00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:17.853
<v 4>right?</v>

924
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.710
<v 0>Couple of limes in the coronas and exceeding or whatever.
Alright.
Hey,
that's,</v>

925
00:56:23.711 --> 00:56:25.810
that's what,
that's what I hope happens for you.
All right,

926
00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:29.310
the last one here before I wrap up the podcast.

927

928
00:56:32.631 --> 00:56:35.050

952
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:07.350
You know,
like,
like those violent ones?

953
00:58:07.351 --> 00:58:09.840
I don't even know what they're called anymore.
I had to wean myself off of them.

954
00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:14.950
Pay Low and that type of stuff.
I Dunno.
I think it's cool.

955
00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:18.130
All right,
the last one here.
I don't even know what this one's true guys.

956
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:23.140
I hope this is true.
I don't know that,
but this,

957
00:58:23.141 --> 00:58:27.190
this,
this seems too true too.
I mean,
too unbelievable to be true.

958
00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:32.020
This is called threesome says,
dear bill,
I was a virgin who never wrote in,

959
00:58:32.021 --> 00:58:32.860
but listen to your,

960
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:38.050
listen to you respond to other virgins who wrote in I am 19 not exactly old,

961
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.760
but who wants to break 20 before blowing your load and age girl.

962
00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:44.490
The remarkable part,
um,

963
00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:48.960
is that I had a threesome to kick off my new life as not a virgin.

964
00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:50.963
See that?

965
00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:56.570
This guy's trying to make me believe that right out of the gate.

966
00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:58.920
I mean,
it can happen.

967
00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:02.430
People get called up from the minors their first fucking time.
You know,

968
00:59:02.431 --> 00:59:06.870
they hit for the fucking cycle.
They throw a perfect game.
It can happen,

969
00:59:06.871 --> 00:59:08.550
but I'm reading this one with a grain of salt.

970
00:59:08.551 --> 00:59:11.160
I don't know if this is a listener fucking with me or what,
but here we go.

971
00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:15.120
He said,
I met this girl.
Let's see.
I'll believable if sound's all right,

972
00:59:15.121 --> 00:59:19.740
then we'll take a vote whether you believe this or not.
I hope it's true.
Anyways,

973
00:59:19.741 --> 00:59:22.250
I met this girl at the beach

974
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:25.100
<v 3>last summer and ran into her again sometime in July.</v>

975
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:29.210
She's being very flirty and kept talking about her summer bucket list.

976
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:32.960
She said her and her friend had the same goal.

977
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:37.100
I thought they meant that they separately wanted to get the flowered.

978
00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:41.900
Not Thinking that hey,
everyone is probably not thinking that hey,

979
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:47.120
everyone is probably getting laid.
I figured we were all on the same page.
Oh,

980
00:59:47.121 --> 00:59:50.840
so you thought that they were both versions.
So week back I invited to a party.

981
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:55.310
My friend was having,
she brings her friend and her friend is hotter.

982
00:59:56.350 --> 01:00:01.010
Uh,
I start working on her cause I'm drunk and on a roll and I'm going for broke.

983
01:00:01.011 --> 01:00:03.620
Good for you,
good for you.
And in fact,

984
01:00:03.621 --> 01:00:08.120
at one point another dude came in to interrupt the conversation and I gave him
a,

985
01:00:08.121 --> 01:00:12.410
Whoa,
you got to,
you got to raise your hand.

986
01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:16.560
What does that mean?
He raised it all.

987
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:20.260
I'll you got to raise your hand to come into the conversation.
Jesus Christ,

988
01:00:20.261 --> 01:00:23.640
this kid took his Fonzie pills.
I said,
he uh,

989
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:26.530
he raised his hand and I called him a clown.

990
01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:31.990
Everyone laughed.
What a fucking idiot.
He did that anyways,

991
01:00:31.991 --> 01:00:35.920
why wouldn't I think this girl want,
wanted to bang.
Wait a minute,
dude.

992
01:00:35.921 --> 01:00:38.470
How are you?
This fucking cool.
And you never got any ass before.

993
01:00:38.471 --> 01:00:39.730
This doesn't make any sense.

994
01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:45.080
You're coming off like a Billy Ray Valentine here anyways.
Well,

995
01:00:45.081 --> 01:00:47.690
it turns out her and her friends wanted to have a threesome.

996
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.950
I realized this when they both told me flat out that they want it to,

997
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:53.690
I went for a bill.

998
01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:56.930
I didn't really know what I was doing for the first 10 seconds or so.

999
01:00:56.931 --> 01:01:00.650
But after that,
it just all made sense.
Like when Neil saw the matrix,

1000
01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:03.860
I couldn't have done it without the podcast.
Well,
let me ask you this.

1001
01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:05.090
Do you guys believe that?

1002
01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.940
I didn't know what I was doing for the first 10 seconds.

1003
01:01:08.941 --> 01:01:10.380
And then you all of a sudden you understood,

1004
01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:13.350
but then he makes a reference to neo in the Matrix,

1005
01:01:13.351 --> 01:01:18.280
which is something that a fucking nerd would do.
I Dunno.
It's a hell of a story.

1006
01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:22.900
I hope it's true.
They did.

1007
01:01:22.901 --> 01:01:24.870
That just doesn't make sense.
You're fucking virgin.

1008
01:01:24.871 --> 01:01:29.050
You get a threesome the first time without paying for it.
You know,

1009
01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:34.260
you fucking,
you have the ball,
you're a fucking virgin.
But you had the bitch.

1010
01:01:34.261 --> 01:01:37.140
You're making the move of a guy who has gotten laid where you go for the even

1011
01:01:37.141 --> 01:01:40.470
harder one and then you stop the guy from cock blocking you.

1012
01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:46.200
You know,
I mean it,
unless you're an absolute,
you're fucking the natural.

1013
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.020
There's no way.
How do you have all these skills?
He never got laid before.

1014
01:01:51.021 --> 01:01:55.970
I'm calling bullshit on this one.
I hope it's true.
I hope it's true.
I really do.

1015
01:01:56.930 --> 01:02:01.640
And if it is true,
I want to know what the fuck you would drink it.
Um,
our right.

1016
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:04.880
Is that the podcast?
I don't know if it is way,
way,
way,
way wait.

1017
01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:06.620
