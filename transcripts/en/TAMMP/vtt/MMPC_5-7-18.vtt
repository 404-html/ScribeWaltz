Oh my God.

26
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:36.120
I know right?
I did that.
You know I didn't,

27
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.260
I took a half court shot and God did the rest of the law.

28
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.870
Um,
anyways,
so we ended up going out to a steak house,
right.
Sydney has like,

29
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:50.490
I don't want to stake but I'd like some steak.
Are you going to order a steak?

30
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.320
And it's like,
yes.
When in Rome.
Hi.
Hi.

31
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.730
Hi.
Did you just say hi to me?
You say hi to the listeners.
Qt.

32
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.020
So Nia is just like,
can you kind of kid a steak?

33
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.440
I don't want stay on a whole steak.
I wanted to get tuna tar,

34
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:11.010
tar and I wanted a crab.
The lump crab cake,
which is what you ordered.

35
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.490
And I wanted a little bit his day cause I want to do a little surf and turf.

36
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.680
Yeah.

37
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.170
So what does all freckles to what is all freckles still he key orders of course.

38
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:23.400
What do you order?
Oh Billy steg face.
I ordered the bone in Ribeye.

39
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.210
How the hell did that happen?
Sorry,
what just happened there?

40
00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:32.440
Somehow I moved in,
the volume got turned down anyways,

41
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.490
I'll have to edit that part out.
So anyways,
I'll Billy stake face.

42
00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:41.230
I order a bone in Ribeye.
So Cutie Pie here starts getting frustrated.

43
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.300
Nah,
starts making noise and I,
you know,

44
00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:45.730
I don't want to be that guy at the restaurant with the baby that's crying

45
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.600
specially in a steakhouse steak house.
You have a lot of people,

46
00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:54.520
they're in their second marriages.
People who you know,
didn't get married,

47
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.850
guys who are paying for a house that they're no longer allowed to go into.

48
00:02:57.851 --> 00:03:02.260
You know,
there's a lot of that go in,
you know,
a lot of child support being paid,

49
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.760
you know,
by some of these people who had to rebuild it again.
So it'll add lead.

50
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.450
You have belly hanging out.
Let me give Kelly hanging out.
What are you doing?

51
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.470
So she was,
my daughter was getting frustrated,
so I just started,
I started,

52
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:17.140
you know,
walking around the restaurant and everything.

53
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:22.141
Like that being the amazing father that I am right running around,

54
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.080
she's so short,
I got to like,
you know,
bend it that angle,

55
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:30.640
then it's like killing my back.
But I,
but I stuck it out.
I did it for you.

56
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.820
I did it for all those divorcees in there.
Right.

57
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.710
All those people paying child support,

58
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:38.110
even though the women that women are starting to pay child support to.

59
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.850
Oh you haven't seen it,
you haven't read that.
And cosmo,
cosmo,
cosmo,
yeah.

60
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.560
Yeah.
And they out there,
they're complaining that which I love.

61
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.310
I love this whole equal pay cause you wait and you wait till enough women have

62
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:54.760
to start paying child support and you watch those divorce laws change.

63
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.700
Um,
so anyways,
while I'm being the amazing father than that,

64
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:05.560
I am obviously,
this is my,
uh,
this is my version of the story.
Uh,

65
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.850
my stake arrives.

66
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.960
So Nia goes to cut off her portion of the steak.

67
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:15.961
And basically what she does is she cuts the thing like length wise,

68
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.180
right a lot like an inch away from the bone and she takes all the meat along the

69
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:24.490
bone and then gives me the rest of it.
And for those of you who aren't meaty,

70
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.230
there's all you've vegetarians out there,

71
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.250
the most flavorful part of a bone in Ribeye.
The reason is is all along the bone.

72
00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:34.120
And she took the best meat and I was so upset with her,

73
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:37.780
I told her that she needed to go to ancestry.com because that was some northern

74
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.380
white European shit.
What you just did there?

75
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.930
Uh,
yeah,
I'd say the,
yeah,
I did.
That's my favorite.

76
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:52.610
Fired the bone.
I

77
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.520
all right guys,
she ever want to know.

78
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.970
If you want to know what it's like to be a husband and a father,

79
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:04.300
that's what it is.
She makes the baby.

80
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.990
She goes through all of that.
She goes through nine months of hell,

81
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.200
10 months of hell.
Actually this,
the middle three.

82
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:13.030
That's like the summer vacation,
but whatever.

83
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:16.630
We'll say 10 months of hell and you know what?
And then as a guy,

84
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:19.090
you pay for it for the rest of the relationship.

85
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.690
She gets it all back with little f little shady cuts of bone in Ribeye.

86
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.940
I couldn't believe that.
Hi.

87
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.660
Hi Cutie.
He's smiling at you,
Huh?
She is in love with you.

88
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.450
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
and I'll be in love with her until the day she takes the,

89
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.900
the good part of my cheerios.
All right.

90
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.100
Hi.
How are you,
Cutie.
All right,

91
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.700
daddy has to talk filthy so I can still buy your diapers.
That's how it works.

92
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:53.380
I'm sorry I'm too far down this road to pretend that you have a respectable
dead.

93
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.830
All right,
lovely ladies.
Well,

94
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:59.650
I mean thought that you were going to try to defend your position and you didn't

95
00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.930
you like,
yeah,
I did.
That's what I did.

96
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.910
<v 2>I mean,
that's,
that's,
that's really all there is to say.
I did.
I saw that</v>

97
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.810
<v 1>meet along the loans.
You're doing Donald Trump right now and what does that,</v>

98
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.070
that's how he got out of stuff.

99
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.860
You said all this horrible stuff about women and he's like,
no,

100
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:18.190
I said that about Rosie O'donnell.
And they were like,
no,

101
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.050
you said that about other women.
He was like,
yeah,
you're probably right.

102
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.720
It's like all right.

103
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.170
I thought that was going to be a big funny fight and it was nothing out.

104
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:30.100
You're on my ankle.
Okay.

105
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.370
All right ladies.
Bye Bye.

106
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:37.890
Can you say bye bye
bye bye.

107
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.690
All right.
Oh well yeah,
I'll see you later.

108
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.150
Bye.
If she's Burton your leg.
Oh okay.

109
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.020
You get my sake and I get a cheaper later.
Let me guess.

110
00:06:57.021 --> 00:07:00.260
Mcdonald's,
what do you guys want?
What do you like Betty?

111
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:02.840
Like Mcdonald's or Burger King?
I've always,
I've always been a McDonald's guy.

112
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.760
Oh he's been Mcdonald's and I know it's not like I'm out here looking for

113
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.220
another advertiser.
I'll tell you right now,

114
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:15.221
I feel the best poisoned in fast food is Mcdonald's.

115
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.970
This is how I would,
I would rank.
So I ranked my fast food cheeseburgers,
Nia.
Oh,

116
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.010
okay.
All right.
As much as there's some great ones out there like in and out.

117
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.700
I have to go to Mcdonald's cause the child's sense memory.
Okay.

118
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.440
You know that just takes me back to,
you know,
when my bicycle was orange,

119
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:39.010
just like my hair that I used to have and I had the white tape around the handle

120
00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:41.420
bars.
[inaudible] tell you what happened.

121
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.640
<v 2>I went to the,
um,
to see my trainer and when I got in there,
oh yeah.</v>

122
00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:49.480
Did you take the Best Matt in the gym?
Yes.

123
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.110
And he was finishing up with another client and she had her daughter there who

124
00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:56.050
was like four years old and she's so cute.
So I was like,
oh,

125
00:07:56.051 --> 00:07:57.460
you want to see pictures of my baby?

126
00:07:57.461 --> 00:08:01.210
And so I was showing her pictures of the baby and then she saw a picture of you

127
00:08:01.211 --> 00:08:05.290
with the baby and she goes,
who's that?
And I said,
Oh that's,
I'm her daddy,

128
00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:09.610
that's my husband.
And she goes,
okay.
She goes,
why does he have any hair?

129
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.990
Who said that the kid can the fourth girl.
And I said,
well,
you know,

130
00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:18.370
sometimes when people get older,
you know,
their hair starts to come out,

131
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.030
and so he just decided to cut it off because he didn't want it just to be

132
00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:25.000
falling on it.
I think it looks better this way,
and she was like,
yeah,

133
00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:25.834
that's true.

134
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.660
<v 1>Why did I need to know that there was a cute already feel bad enough about</v>

135
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:35.830
myself?
Do you want me to kids who looked at me and said,
you're ugly in my life?

136
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.570
How may at least six.
No,
I swear to God we won.
I had hair.

137
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.890
No.
Yeah,
children and children are honest.

138
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.190
I know what all you adults to do and you'd just be a nice to me.

139
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.650
Maybe you deserve that bone in Ribeye and just give me the ship,
right?
Ai.
Yeah.

140
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.490
Ugly piece of Shit.
Get outta here,
Nina.
Like that cute story.

141
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.460
Neal
and I met this girl the other day and she,

142
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.220
I showed her a picture of you and she was like,
hey,
why is her butt's so big?

143
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:12.100
And I was like,
well,
you know,
you bought as in pig.
All right,

144
00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:13.500
but now I'm going to fucking pay father,

145
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.850
you're going to laugh at that and I'm going to pay for that comment forever,

146
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.860
right?
You can just,
you can just eviscerate me

147
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.190
<v 2>child that's senate.</v>

148
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.160
So I don't know why you're making up some scenario where someone's insulting

149
00:09:28.161 --> 00:09:32.570
like my looks that's not a child.
And for the record,

150
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.480
my ass might be big,
but it's like perfect.
So

151
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.540
<v 1>it is,
it's why I married you would certain wasn't certainly wasn't the other end</v>

152
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.940
rather end.
I have no problem with the,
is she a fucking Yap.

153
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.160
That drives me up the wall.
All right.
Whatever.
Why,
why,

154
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.820
why do I try to make a point?
Why do I try to get ahead?
They know what I mean.

155
00:09:52.821 --> 00:09:54.830
It's just like bill,
you'll lose it.
Okay.

156
00:09:54.831 --> 00:09:58.890
You're at a casino and the House always wins in the house is you fucking wife.

157
00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:03.290
So just fucking cash in your chips and go back to the Goddamn Room.

158
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.380
Anyways,
let's get back to the NHL playoffs.

159
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.110
Congratulations to the fucking expansion.
Tampa Bay lightning.

160
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.670
I don't hate you guys cause I love Steve,
ours,
him and,

161
00:10:15.671 --> 00:10:20.480
and I know he's in your front office so I'm happy for him.
All right.
Okay.

162
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.070
Having said that,

163
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.440
you guys were the better team no matter how bad the officiating was.

164
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:32.270
It was bad for both sides.
Um,
and no matter what I think you guys still use,

165
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.610
you just were a better team.
He just rebelled a team,

166
00:10:34.611 --> 00:10:36.530
no matter what you were going to win.
But I will say this,

167
00:10:36.531 --> 00:10:40.430
this officiating straight across the board in the NHL playoffs,

168
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:45.460
not just arguing for my team has been really a unprofessional,

169
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.170
really unprofessional.
There's always a couple of calls here or there,
but like,

170
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.090
it's reminding me of NBA officiating last decade when I called it,

171
00:10:56.091 --> 00:10:59.270
I said it was fixed.
I'm not saying it's fixed,

172
00:10:59.271 --> 00:11:03.440
this is coming off more like,
I feel like it's like,

173
00:11:03.441 --> 00:11:07.310
did the real refs go on strike?
And these are like some fucking scab refs.

174
00:11:07.311 --> 00:11:12.260
They pulled out of the fucking crowd.
Um,
there was just a couple of like,

175
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.680
look,
you know,
Marshawn took that guy's fucking knees out.

176
00:11:15.681 --> 00:11:19.640
They didn't make a call there,
which I thought was bullshit.
And uh,
you know,

177
00:11:19.641 --> 00:11:24.020
I know we were licking people's faces and that is no rule against that yet.

178
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:28.250
I can guarantee you maybe now that the Bruins are knocked out,
maybe they'll,

179
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.060
they'll relax.
But I mean,
I thought if we advance to the next round,

180
00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:35.630
they were going to make a quick rule that's going to be called the Marshawn
rule.

181
00:11:35.631 --> 00:11:38.270
It's going to be no player Shell,
kiss,

182
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.300
lick tongue or in any manner use his facial or a fist

183
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.760
with inappropriate contact is going to be the,
there's going to be the bread,

184
00:11:49.761 --> 00:11:53.650
Marshawn rule.
And someday if I live enough,

185
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.000
I will see Brad when he's in his seventies on the NHL Network,

186
00:11:58.001 --> 00:11:59.080
laughing about it,

187
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:04.081
talking about how that rule came about and why he was doing what he was doing.

188
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.370
Um,
it's the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.

189
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.480
And it was,
it was,
it was hilarious.
And when they went back to the,
to studio,

190
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:17.200
Jeremy Ronek was,
is,
it was like,
it happened to him.
He's like,

191
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:20.290
I would have immediately gone to the showers and I was thinking like,
well,

192
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:25.030
that's great.
You're all of fame player.
Let's get you off the ice.
Um,

193
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.000
I had a buddy of mine actually texted me,
said,

194
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:31.570
not even Sean Avery licked another player.
And I was like,
yeah,

195
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:35.870
well he was too dumb to think of it.
And he goes,
well,
if he's that dumb,

196
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.700
why is he married to a supermodel?
And I said,
all right,
fair enough.
You got me.

197
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:45.430
Um,
anyways,
but just,
you know,
I mean,
what the fuck that guy,
the guy in Tampa,

198
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:50.460
like we really needed to win game four so we can lose in six games and we lose,

199
00:12:50.801 --> 00:12:54.700
still going to lose the fucking template is his hands off his stick.

200
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.030
He hauls McAvoy down behind his own net,

201
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.010
behind his own fucking net,
no call.
It was,

202
00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:05.700
it was the most obvious.
Not only did the announces,

203
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.830
when they went back to the fucking studio even,
they were like,
what the fuck?

204
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.270
Tampa takes it,

205
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.900
pass it over stamp cost and they tied a fucking game up and wheat instead of

206
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.560
having a chance to even this series at two two we go down three one it was just

207
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:21.930
stuff like that.
I,
you know it's funny as Barton,

208
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.600
nick was in Tampa Bay and he was listening to it on the radio and Esposito said

209
00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:29.440
that it looked like a dive,
which is the funniest fucking thing ever.

210
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.451
Esposito.

211
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:36.451
I is still fucking pissed that he asked for like $3 more from the cheap ass

212
00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:40.330
Boston Bruins 45 years ago and they ship them to New York,

213
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.540
our archrival other than the Canadians during that time.

214
00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:47.260
So he will never be impartial when it comes to us.
But what the fuck?

215
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:52.261
Kind of who the fuck is going to dive behind their own net with the puck behind

216
00:13:53.741 --> 00:13:55.020
your own fucking net when you're,

217
00:13:55.021 --> 00:13:58.090
you're up by one and you have to win that playoff game or are you going to go

218
00:13:58.091 --> 00:14:02.230
down three games to one?
I don't know.
He is Esposito.

219
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:07.210
He is a hall of Famer,
but that did not look like a dive to me.

220
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.700
And having said all this fucking sour grape shit,

221
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.040
I know Tampa's still would've won.
I know they probably would've wanted to.

222
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:13.870
Probably six games is what I think would have happened.

223
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.760
They just had too much fire power.

224
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:20.710
And I think by the time we decided to get physical in the series it was too
late.

225
00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:25.450
But um,
that's what was missing in our game this year,

226
00:14:25.451 --> 00:14:27.790
I think against Toronto and against Tampa,

227
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.710
which both of them I felt had more firepower than we did is when you're playing

228
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:34.900
a team that has,
you know,

229
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.130
faster than you and has more gold scores,
you have to get physical with them.

230
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:41.860
You can't just let them fucking skate around.

231
00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:43.150
And I think we just waited too long,

232
00:14:43.151 --> 00:14:47.650
but haven't said that this rebuild is on an upswing.
I mean,

233
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:50.410
I thought that we were going to be bad for a good six,
seven seasons.

234
00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:54.650
I didn't see the light at the end of the tunnel.
So I'm very happy that we,
uh,

235
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.930
we want to play off series advanced to the second round.

236
00:14:56.931 --> 00:15:00.770
It's definitely a very successful year and a,

237
00:15:00.771 --> 00:15:04.180
we're going to have a new rule named after one of our players to Marshawn rule.

238
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.200
Maybe it's a good thing that we lost in five.
If there was any more games,

239
00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:17.201
he might've been the first guy to get a fucking meat to case from another guy,

240
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:19.070
right?
Oh No,
no,
wait,
that one guy did.

241
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:23.030
The agent did with the other guy from the cop show.
All right.

242
00:15:23.031 --> 00:15:25.340
I guess everything's been done.
Is that what it is?

243
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:26.990
Has everything been done in the whole time?

244
00:15:26.991 --> 00:15:30.860
This is what kills me is I'm watching the Bruins,
you know,

245
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.940
just fucking losing this series lick and people's faces and shit.
And I,

246
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I missed every single second of the Celtic 70 sixers.
You know,
I just,

247
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.360
I had to pick a road.
So busy.

248
00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:47.150
I've got the kid and all that and I only had time and I missed,

249
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.860
I guess one of the most epic Celtics Games in recent memory where they tied it

250
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:55.250
up at the buzzer against the sixers.
And then came back and won in overtime.

251
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:58.490
All I'm hearing is Rosier Tatum Brown.

252
00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:03.491
How much this stepping up Al Horford I guess was a blocking shots like a maniac.

253
00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:08.840
And uh,
so now I gotta
I gotta I gotta I have,

254
00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:11.570
I have all the time in the world to watch the Celtics now.

255
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.080
So that's what I kind of realized.
You know,

256
00:16:15.081 --> 00:16:16.760
as much as I love the Celtics and everything,

257
00:16:16.761 --> 00:16:20.390
I really am a hockey guy because I knew we were going to lose that series and I

258
00:16:20.391 --> 00:16:22.520
still hung in there and wash it.

259
00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:26.540
Although I missed yesterday's game because I was at a kid birthday party and

260
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:29.660
awesome kid birthday party,
like a,
you know,

261
00:16:29.661 --> 00:16:33.620
you know when parents do a kid birthday party,
right?
You take notes.

262
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.470
These people did a great,
they didn't have it at their house.

263
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:39.770
They had it at like a function room.
There was an outdoor area,

264
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.150
there was a little jumpy house.
This guy did a bubble show,
you know,

265
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.540
he had a good set to man.
That's a tough crowd.
You know,
kids trying to keep them,

266
00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:52.010
you know,
their attention.
They had booze for the,
the parents,
they had great food,

267
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.120
you know.
And then,
uh,
over in the corner they had this area where the kids,

268
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.400
you know,
one of those playpens that has like a zillion

269
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.750
different multicolored balls and all that type.
And it's just,

270
00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:05.300
my kid was totally entertained the whole time.

271
00:17:05.301 --> 00:17:09.410
I don't think I saw any kid crying just until the very end with the kids,

272
00:17:09.411 --> 00:17:13.400
you know,
they need a nap and then just like,
I don't want it.
But

273
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.800
it was a great time.
So,
uh,
somebody there asked me,

274
00:17:18.801 --> 00:17:21.110
cause you Bruins playing right now.
I'm like,
I'm afraid to look.

275
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:24.640
So it was kind of looking down and looking at the scores and then all my Boston

276
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.610
friends was sending me texts going,
what the fuck are we doing?

277
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.140
These refs suck.
The refs really did suck.
Um,

278
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.391
you know,
who knows,

279
00:17:35.391 --> 00:17:38.090
they probably still would've maybe tied it up and beat us in five.

280
00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:41.510
Who the fuck knows?
But I'm just saying,
you know,
I just hate having that,
like

281
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.250
that God damn feeling,
you know,
it's like that year the Lakers beat us,
you know,

282
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.090
which sucks enough.
But if the Lakers,
it's fine.

283
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.480
I can live with that to the fucking Lakers,
you know what I mean?

284
00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.180
But you know,

285
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.640
you call like thirtysomething files on one team and you know,

286
00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.890
in the teens on the other and a game seven,
it's just inexcusable.

287
00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.590
Unless we were out there hacking people up and it just,

288
00:18:06.591 --> 00:18:11.120
I dunno fucking drives me up the God day.
Those are the ones that stay with me.

289
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.930
You know what I mean?
I don't give a fuck if he just come in and kick our ass,

290
00:18:14.931 --> 00:18:15.930
but we don't.
I,
but I,

291
00:18:15.931 --> 00:18:19.990
I do take peace in the fact that Tampa Bay was definitely the better team and,

292
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.940
and I feel it
easily could have just beat us at six.
Um,

293
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.640
as much as,
I hate to admit any motherfucker anyways,
plowing ahead,

294
00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.600
what's going to go on with the capitals or the capital's finally going to get

295
00:18:32.601 --> 00:18:36.800
over the Hump and slay the dragon and beat these goddamn penguins from

296
00:18:36.801 --> 00:18:41.801
Pittsburgh or the Pittsburgh penguins going to continue their march to be the

297
00:18:42.891 --> 00:18:47.891
first team since the New York Islanders is Steve Byrne reminded me yesterday,

298
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.650
just the New York islanders to win three in a row.

299
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:53.930
It's been that long.

300
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:58.550
The island is actually won four in a row from 80 to 84.

301
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.290
And um,

302
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.790
I remember demo the one on the cover the next year of sports illustrated and

303
00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:08.200
they said the strive for five to assume you know,
the rate,

304
00:19:08.201 --> 00:19:11.600
one of the rare times sports illustrated put a hockey player back then,
you know,

305
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.230
on the cover.
And I think it was Mike Bossy,
if I remember correctly.

306
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.960
And um,

307
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:18.490
<v 0>okay.</v>

308
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.250
<v 1>Yeah,
that was the age of dynasties when I grew up,</v>

309
00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.860
when I think about it from like,

310
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:31.190
you look at the 70s in hockey Bruins,
one,
two flyers,
one,

311
00:19:31.191 --> 00:19:35.810
two and see Canadians one six.

312
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.560
So he had three teams,
basically won everything.

313
00:19:39.561 --> 00:19:41.570
And then the previous decade it was,

314
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.610
it was Canadians beliefs and then the Blackhawks won one.

315
00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.173
Um,

316
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:53.390
and then I think Canadians want five and and the least one four,

317
00:19:53.391 --> 00:19:55.310
cause I want to say the least one like three in a row.

318
00:19:55.311 --> 00:20:00.311
And then one in 67 and the Blackhawks won is 61 and everything else was the

319
00:20:00.861 --> 00:20:04.470
Canadians,
if I remember correctly.
Um,

320
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.170
and then you went to the eighties,
then the islanders.
So basically after the,
the,

321
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.630
uh,
it went Bruins,
Canadians,
Bruins can age flyers,
flyers.
Then Canadians,

322
00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:18.200
Canadians,
Canadians,
Canadians and islanders,
islanders,
islanders,
islanders,

323
00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.070
Edmonton,
Edmonton,
Canadians,
Edmonton,
Edmonton.

324
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:27.290
Then cow beat the fucking Canadians.
I one of my favorite one,

325
00:20:27.291 --> 00:20:30.500
landing macdonald,
the Ginger,
um,

326
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.200
and then add mutton again in [inaudible] 90

327
00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.840
and then 91 92 was the penguins.

328
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.840
And that was like immediate talking a,

329
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.990
I mean,
you could literally go back all the way to the 50s cause I know like the

330
00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:49.360
Redwings one like back to back and everything else was just,

331
00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:54.361
it was just fucking basically pre 1967 if you had to guess who won the cup that

332
00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:58.690
year,
either guests,
Canadians or may beliefs.
Um,

333
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.630
but then all of a sudden,
you know,
once,
you know the,

334
00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:06.070
the expansion six and 67 and then they added a,
you know,

335
00:21:06.071 --> 00:21:10.270
Edmonton Oilers and all those guys and like I believe 78 or something like that.

336
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.930
And then it was a 2018 league and it just took a little bit,

337
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.000
well actually island was where expansion team in the early seventies.

338
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.930
Then they got al La,
they went on that run.

339
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.540
But uh,
then after that,
after the penguins went back to back,

340
00:21:28.541 --> 00:21:29.500
it's just basically,

341
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:33.130
but every other year it's like somebody else wins it other than the one,

342
00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:37.300
the red wings one,
two in a row.
And I think,
uh,

343
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.740
the penguins right now,
right.
It's not how it goes.
I don't fucking know.

344
00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:46.900
Um,
but anyways,
which is why I hate to say this is a Celtics fan.
I think the,

345
00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:50.620
uh,
the Lakers are,
they,
they're the most successful franchise,
um,

346
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:56.220
in the modern era because they were able to during free agency win championships

347
00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:03.190
at a clip that people,
one before,
you know,
back when there was like a,
you know,

348
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.620
if you were a Laker you or a lake or go fuck yourself,

349
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:09.430
you're not going somewhere else unless the owner decides,
um,

350
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:14.820
haven't said that.
You know,
the Lakers do have a championship,
uh,
that,

351
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.090
you know,

352
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.750
there was a mobbed up ref and fucked over the Sacramento Kings that year.

353
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:21.640
I'm not saying the kings would have wanted,

354
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:23.830
but the Lakers would not have gotten a banner that year.

355
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:27.370
And then that other one with the fucking 37 files,

356
00:22:27.371 --> 00:22:29.980
37 files in 48 minutes of the Celtics

357
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.590
and never forget Colby.
He goes,
I don't know how we won that game.
Well,

358
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.160
fucking talk to the guys with the athlete's foot shirts.
Um,

359
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.150
anyways,
sorry,
I'm just in a fucking bad mood cause my team lost.
Um,

360
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.210
anyways,
plowing ahead here.
Uh,
old Billy.
No vice

361
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.100
trudging along
into May.

362
00:22:57.101 --> 00:23:00.960
I wanted to go at least a weekend to May cause I was just trying to go,
you know,

363
00:23:00.961 --> 00:23:02.500
the,
the month of April,

364
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:08.170
basically vice lists and then I go into may and then I'm just like,

365
00:23:08.171 --> 00:23:12.490
you know what,
I'm looking good.
I'm keeping the weight off.
I got the Big Five,

366
00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:13.480
oh next month.

367
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:18.220
It would really be a shame if I got this close to my birthday.

368
00:23:18.221 --> 00:23:22.540
Look in this good.
And then I just,
you know,
I just fucking,
you know,

369
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.420
put on that booze 10 pounds.
I don't want to do that.
But so,
uh,

370
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:29.980
I've been laying off,

371
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:36.270
laying off bored as shit went to that party yesterday.

372
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.210
There was booze there.
Could have had one 10 do it,
went to the steakhouse,

373
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.840
said all the beautiful fucking bottles behind the bar,
do it.

374
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.650
Came home,
trudge passed my bar.

375
00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:56.220
They don't even say hi anymore.
Didn't do it.
Went downstairs,

376
00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:02.730
took out my phone,
played solitaire on it,
fell asleep.

377
00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:08.250
The exciting life of sobriety.
You know,

378
00:24:08.251 --> 00:24:11.660
it's hard to,
as I watched the Kentucky Derby,
um,

379
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.820
I would have won money cause I always bet on that white haired guys horse cause

380
00:24:16.821 --> 00:24:20.720
he's,
he's just a man.
He's the bill Belicheck at that shit.
And uh,

381
00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:23.340
the year I went,
the only time I went,

382
00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.450
what does that triple crown winner and he owned it.
I won money on that one.

383
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.530
And uh,
I was thinking if I was there,
I,
I always,

384
00:24:31.531 --> 00:24:36.531
I always the Michael McDonald Guy of the horse racing owners and I was just

385
00:24:37.081 --> 00:24:40.980
watching that,
that event.
And I was just,

386
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.650
I was like,
why am I not sitting here right now drinking some bourbon,

387
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.020
smoking a cigar,
right.

388
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.360
Watching it through my front window with the volume turned up.
Oh,

389
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.060
she can't smoke a cigar in the house,
but I didn't do it.

390
00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.930
I just sat there,
you know,

391
00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:06.060
I bought one of those TRX bands,
you know,
I'm going to go on the Internet,

392
00:25:06.061 --> 00:25:09.950
still have my custom workout,
you know,
uh,

393
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.650
my shoulder feels really good.
It's really strong.
Uh,

394
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.770
I still haven't done a pull up and like two years.
Uh,
oh actually,
no,
I did.

395
00:25:16.771 --> 00:25:20.940
And then re-injured it,
you know,
six months ago.
So now I'm rehabbing it back.

396
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.780
So now I'm trying to go nice and frigging slow.
I got these bands.

397
00:25:24.781 --> 00:25:27.150
Now I'm back into doing yoga.

398
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:32.360
I'm not fucking j good or not smoking and not bored shitless there.

399
00:25:32.371 --> 00:25:35.970
I said it,
I'm fucking bored shitless.

400
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.300
Like people who are sober,
how the fuck,

401
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.410
you know?
You know what?
I actually finally I bought an external,

402
00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:50.330
a little CD player to plug in so I could finally do my,
uh,

403
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:56.210
my Rosetta Stone French and um,
I've been doing that.
Then of course,

404
00:25:56.211 --> 00:25:57.044
you know,

405
00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:58.650
<v 0>okay.</v>

406
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:03.570
<v 1>My wife helps me set the fucking thing up and then I,
uh,
you know,</v>

407
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.570
it's working,
I'm having a great time and then I go to use it again.

408
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:11.240
And of course it won't fucking work.
It doesn't recognize anything.

409
00:26:11.241 --> 00:26:14.780
I don't know how to open it up and it's just a fucking pain in the ass.

410
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:17.450
So hopefully at some point she'll take some time out of our day.
But anyways,

411
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:18.800
I'm going to polish up on that shit.

412
00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.310
We tried to do an hour or two every single day right up until I get over to

413
00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:25.970
France.
I just want to get a little bit better with my shit.
But uh,

414
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.390
you know,
at some point I gotta,
I gotta I gotta learn,

415
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.750
I gotta become fluent in French because I just think a fucking moron like me

416
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.000
knowing how to speak French,
this is just something,

417
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:39.710
it's too funny to not do it right.
Um,
okay.

418
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.950
I've actually ordered kids French books and I'm them to my daughter.

419
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:45.360
Those are great cause I was thinking like,

420
00:26:45.361 --> 00:26:48.810
well how did I learn how to read English and speak it?
You know,

421
00:26:48.811 --> 00:26:52.650
I had those little books being in Sandy.
Sandy had been,
do you remember that?

422
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.340
Did they still have those fucking books?
They were like these dogs.

423
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.440
That's what that is really is one of the most fascinating things ever is

424
00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:02.580
learning how to read.

425
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.580
And you're a kid so you don't really remember like somebody like teaches you how

426
00:27:05.581 --> 00:27:06.570
to fucking read.

427
00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:09.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

428
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:14.280
<v 1>All right.
Let me see sandy and being,
they were a dog and a cat.</v>

429
00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:16.623
<v 0>Okay.</v>

430
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.440
<v 1>See this?
Oh Man,</v>

431
00:27:18.441 --> 00:27:22.070
I'm going back 45 years shandy and buying books.

432
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.690
I swear to God,
if I see this,
this is going to freak me out to see these books

433
00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.310
and of course it's not coming up.
Come on.
Yeah,

434
00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.200
I the slowest Goddamn Internet ever.

435
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:43.840
Oh,
they don't even have them anymore.
Oh,

436
00:27:43.841 --> 00:27:46.210
Stanley big.
Some guy,
Stanley being wrote a book,

437
00:27:46.211 --> 00:27:48.320
a hundred bullshit jobs and how to get them.

438
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.640
That is fucking hilarious.

439
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:55.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

440
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.960
<v 1>Why the hell would you do that?
Why?
Why would you,</v>

441
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.170
oh my God.
Look at this book.

442
00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:02.460
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

443
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.640
<v 1>The bent,
the Bernstein bears in the mean drunk</v>

444
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.070
and is it does a bear.
I swear to God,

445
00:28:10.071 --> 00:28:14.330
wearing a wife beater holding a bat and it looks like a bottle of Jack Daniels.

446
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.840
This is why you got to love the Internet.
I'm looking up a kid's book

447
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:27.790
and I find a hundred bullshit jobs and how to get them and the Bernstein bears.

448
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.450
Am I saying that right and the mean drunk.

449
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:38.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

450
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.900
<v 1>Bingo.
Crosby,
Ghana,
some bugs bunny one.
All right.
Sorry.
What the fuck him.</v>

451
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:45.780
You guys are literally listened to me surf the Goddamn Internet.
Um,

452
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.310
I had been doing a bunch of standup and popping in a bunch of places out here

453
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:55.820
getting ready for the gigs I have coming up that I do not deserve to be doing in

454
00:28:56.191 --> 00:28:59.010
Ireland and in London,
Dublin and in London.

455
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.690
So I'm going to make sure I'm beyond on my game when I do those things.
I have a,

456
00:29:03.691 --> 00:29:04.430
uh,

457
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:09.430
a run of dates coming up in San Francisco Monday,

458
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.493
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,
Friday.

459
00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:14.160
I'm going to be up there with Nate Kraig Milwaukee Bucks Fan.

460
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:19.710
I'm not going to rub it in unless he brings it up.
Um,
and I'll be,

461
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.150
I'll be up there all week,

462
00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.840
going to find a studio space with a drum kit.

463
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:26.940
I'm gonna fucking practice that bullshit.

464
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.990
I'm be doing my French and I'm not going to be drinking and I'm not going to be

465
00:29:30.991 --> 00:29:34.500
smoking cigars.
A boy.

466
00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.550
I don't know.
I,
there's no fucking way I'm going to do this.

467
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.470
I guess this is why people who are,
you know,

468
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:43.550
somebody actually asked me that the day if I wanted to go to a meeting.

469
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

470
00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.880
<v 1>You know what I mean?
And I was just like,
dude,</v>

471
00:29:46.881 --> 00:29:50.510
I can't sit there with all this fucking donuts and people smoking cigarettes.

472
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.820
I'm just,
you know what I mean?
I'm just not,
I'm not that,

473
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.333
<v 0>you know,</v>

474
00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:01.470
<v 1>like I'm a,
I mean everything I ever fucking joint,
I was like,
I'm not this,</v>

475
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:06.510
I'm not this,
I'm liking this,
but I'm not quite this.
Even like playing drums.

476
00:30:06.511 --> 00:30:10.550
As much as I love playing drums,
I know I'm not a musician.
Like when I got,

477
00:30:10.551 --> 00:30:13.830
you see,
you know,
when you really see somebody that has the fucking gift,

478
00:30:13.831 --> 00:30:16.440
do you like,
that's what that is.
I mean,

479
00:30:16.441 --> 00:30:20.280
I can try to do this and make a really difficult life for myself.

480
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:25.350
It wasn't until I walked into a comedy club and open Mike and I saw all those

481
00:30:25.351 --> 00:30:29.850
desperate lunatics and I'm like,
yeah,
this is,
this is me.

482
00:30:29.851 --> 00:30:31.650
I'm this,
this is what I am.

483
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.810
So I went to an AA meeting,
I've gone to a couple of them.
Um,

484
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:40.230
they were required by the,
the fucking courts of Massachusetts.

485
00:30:40.231 --> 00:30:44.460
I was required to go to two of those in a mother against drinking and driving

486
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.780
way back in the day when I got arrested with that shit back in the 80s,
you know?

487
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:50.853
<v 0>MMM.</v>

488
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.710
<v 1>And I remember sitting there listening to these fucking stories and I was just</v>

489
00:30:56.711 --> 00:30:59.170
like,
Jesus fucking Christ.

490
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:00.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

491
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:05.920
<v 1>These people would have like head wounds and wake up from head wounds or stumble</v>

492
00:31:06.291 --> 00:31:11.291
out of jail barefoot and just stumble across the street directly over to a

493
00:31:12.141 --> 00:31:15.020
liquor store.
I mean,
that is a fucking alcoholic.

494
00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.403
<v 0>You know,</v>

495
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:20.480
<v 1>they need help.</v>

496
00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:21.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

497
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:26.020
<v 1>To Stop.
I could stop on my own.
I might just justifying all of this.</v>

498
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:27.520
That's what I'd be buddying the programs,

499
00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.660
cause I can stop on my own and I just sit here and I'm just fucking bought,

500
00:31:30.661 --> 00:31:34.780
just born out of my fucking mind.
It doesn't make any sense.
It's like I'm saying,

501
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:38.130
that's like saying I'm never going to have ice cream ever again.
It's like amber,

502
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.140
I could see not having it all the time,
seeing out of fat.
Fuck,

503
00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:44.710
I get dad so your teeth don't rot out of your fucking head.

504
00:31:44.711 --> 00:31:49.000
I was definitely drinking too much,
but like,

505
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.590
<v 0>okay,</v>

506
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:51.910
<v 1>I'm never going to have it again.</v>

507
00:31:51.911 --> 00:31:55.180
We're going to go to the Kentucky Derby against someday.
God fucking willing.

508
00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:00.430
I'm going to go to the Kentucky Derby again and I'm going to sit there stone

509
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:01.270
sober.

510
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:03.873
<v 0>Okay.</v>

511
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.100
<v 1>I mean,
you go into the track.
I mean right there,
you're a degenerate.</v>

512
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:11.300
Why not give into it?
I Dunno,
who knows?
But I will tell you,

513
00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.920
I do love it in the morning when I wake up clearheaded in the morning,
it might,

514
00:32:15.921 --> 00:32:20.720
pasty stomach is nice and flat.
I definitely,
I definitely enjoy that.
You know,

515
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:24.440
makes me a better dad.
I always make my daughter breakfast.

516
00:32:24.441 --> 00:32:26.810
That's my thing every morning.
Right?
I'd go out and I get her,

517
00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:31.280
I opened the door and she goes,
hi,
am I gay?
Right.

518
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.830
Excuse me.
A nice hug and a kiss.
Then,
uh,
you know,
change your,

519
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.730
put a Pajama bottoms across your eyes.
Where is she?
Where is she plays that game.

520
00:32:41.731 --> 00:32:45.250
Loves it.
Still loving that game.
Right.
And um,

521
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:51.390
then I go upstairs.
She's really easy.
I cut up bananas,
strawberries,
blueberries.

522
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:53.940
Did I make her a couple of eggs scrambled.

523
00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:55.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

524
00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:58.090
<v 1>It's funny what I think you'd like to do is I like to have it all prepared</v>

525
00:32:58.091 --> 00:33:01.030
before I bring her upstairs because if I do,
you know,

526
00:33:01.031 --> 00:33:03.990
cause if she's just sitting there,
she starts to get restless.
Like you know,

527
00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:08.270
where's the food?
But if I have it all,
yeah.
Ready?
We other day I had it already,

528
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.670
you know,
and I brought her up but I put her in there,

529
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.540
a little chair and I put a bib on and all that and then I put the plate down

530
00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:19.370
already ready and everything made and she just goes,
wow.
Now she goes,

531
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.270
Whoa,

532
00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.010
it was awesome.
And she can feed herself.

533
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.660
The only thing I got to watch out for is she,
she wolfs down food the way I do.

534
00:33:31.661 --> 00:33:33.250
So I just got to make sure I'm a

535
00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.080
<v 0>okay</v>

536
00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.110
<v 1>just staying on her.
So I make sure I cut up everything nice and small,</v>

537
00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:40.660
spread out the egg.
So they cool off.

538
00:33:40.661 --> 00:33:43.890
She doesn't burn them off and then that's it.
Give her a glass of water,

539
00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:48.640
then it's all good.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,
you know,

540
00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:51.370
then I guess if I was hung over and it'll probably be a bad thing.

541
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.470
So then I think to myself,
what if I just get shit faced when I'm on the road?

542
00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.710
I'm only on the road like four days a month.
That would be fine.
Right.

543
00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:03.910
What do you guys say about that?
Oh,
well what do you say?
Oh,

544
00:34:03.911 --> 00:34:06.790
you guys and fucking Aa and I don't drink on the plane.

545
00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.050
It's just after the shows.

546
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:13.320
It's gotta be a way to do it the way I used to be able to do it,
you know?

547
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.590
Do you know,
you know what the really thing that did fuck me up was I,
I,

548
00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:21.700
I never used to have booze in the house.
So that's the problem.

549
00:34:21.701 --> 00:34:24.490
So when I do start drinking again,
because I am going to start drinking,

550
00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:29.320
what I'm going to do is I'm going to finish all the liquor in my house,

551
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:34.270
which even if I drank at a degenerate level,

552
00:34:34.271 --> 00:34:36.820
would probably take me a good six months.
So I don't,

553
00:34:36.821 --> 00:34:37.660
I don't know how I'm going to judge,

554
00:34:37.661 --> 00:34:40.930
probably should have some people over and help them kill some of these bottles,

555
00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:45.250
but I have such good booze,
I just,
I just can't give it away to some bum.

556
00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:46.361
You know what I mean?

557
00:34:46.361 --> 00:34:50.170
Like do you ever give a Cuban cigar to some guy who occasionally smokes and you

558
00:34:50.171 --> 00:34:53.740
just watch him,
which is half the whole fucking thing down and you know,

559
00:34:53.741 --> 00:34:57.180
you might as well give him a Dutch master.
Yeah.
That's the kind of booze I have.

560
00:34:57.181 --> 00:35:02.181
So what I would like to do is slowly knock out all the booze over the next five

561
00:35:04.021 --> 00:35:07.320
years than I have in the house and not replace any of the bottles.

562
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.660
And then,
because I think even back in the day when I lived in New York,

563
00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:18.630
when I was living in New York and Derosa was living in New York,
um,

564
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.780
I mean we used to just get fucking annihilated.

565
00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:24.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

566
00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:28.060
<v 1>And uh,
but I never had any booze in the house.
Okay.</v>

567
00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:32.020
So in my apartment I should say.
So I think that that's,

568
00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.970
I think that's right there was the game changers when I had it at home and then

569
00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:41.020
had these nice fucking glasses.
You know,
when you really get into it,

570
00:35:41.021 --> 00:35:43.870
like this is high level booze and these high level like you know,

571
00:35:43.871 --> 00:35:48.850
the right glass and you get into the whole like ritual of it and you really can

572
00:35:48.851 --> 00:35:52.240
trick yourself that you're not just being sub degenerate drinking alone.

573
00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.940
You know what I mean?
You know he is a high ball glass,

574
00:35:54.941 --> 00:35:57.400
so this is what you is a list of those glass here is for us.

575
00:35:57.401 --> 00:36:01.540
Sam Adams beer actually have the Sam Adams glasses.
You know what,

576
00:36:01.541 --> 00:36:04.900
that little lip at the top like it's supposed to make the head and the hops and

577
00:36:04.901 --> 00:36:07.780
all of that tastes good.
It tastes the fucking same.
You know what I mean?

578
00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.740
That's like when they do all these reissues of guitars,
you know what I mean?

579
00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.190
I can't tell the difference the way I play guitar,

580
00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.470
which I barely do anymore.
Um,

581
00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:23.260
and uh,
you know,
you could give me the greatest guitar in the world.

582
00:36:23.261 --> 00:36:25.210
I'm still going to sound like make,
which is shitty.

583
00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:32.020
So anyways,
I don't know who the fuck knows,

584
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:37.370
but a buddy of mine is actually been listening to these tapes that,
you know,

585
00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:41.440
talk about alcohol,
not,
and that's stupid.
You need to go to get help type of way,

586
00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.820
but they just talk about,
they just put it in a different perspective.
Um,

587
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:50.110
I dunno,
I'm just like a streaky person.
That's all it is.

588
00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:51.250
So like when I'm not drinking,

589
00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.790
I don't want to drink cause I don't want to ruin the streak.
Oh my God,
man.

590
00:36:54.791 --> 00:36:59.140
I've gotten like 35,
40 days here.
I'm gonna start all over again.

591
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.730
Let me see if I can make it to 50 because there's a big part of me that,
um,

592
00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:10.120
you know,
would like to plow right through my birthday and not drink,

593
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.730
but then it's like,
I'm going to be in France.

594
00:37:12.731 --> 00:37:14.410
How the fuck do you not drink when you're over there?

595
00:37:14.411 --> 00:37:15.970
I'm not gonna have a fucking glass of wine.

596
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:22.160
Sit there like a fucking jerk off.
I don't know.
We'll see.
Anyways.
All right.

597
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:23.420
Zip Recruiter.
Zip.

598
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:24.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

599
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:25.860
<v 1>Recruit up.</v>

600
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:31.850
Talk about the challenge of finding great talent and how the way you went about

601
00:37:31.981 --> 00:37:35.190
it just did not work or was inefficient.
Well,

602
00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:37.680
I'd love to tell you that that was a problem.
But,
uh,

603
00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.340
I actually got lucky for somebody who was a fan of my podcast,

604
00:37:41.341 --> 00:37:44.850
reached out to me by the name of Andrew Sam Willis.

605
00:37:44.851 --> 00:37:49.470
And I've been working with them ever since,
you know,
and he's been great.

606
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.440
So I don't know what to tell you.

607
00:37:52.441 --> 00:37:55.350
Simple ZipRecruiter knew there was a smarter way.
Well,
look,

608
00:37:55.351 --> 00:37:58.290
obviously if I actually ran a business where I needed more than one frigging

609
00:37:58.291 --> 00:38:00.600
employee,
okay.

610
00:38:00.601 --> 00:38:05.601
And I don't want to waste time bringing people in and sitting there talking to

611
00:38:05.881 --> 00:38:08.760
them and trying to find out if they came from divorce or you know,

612
00:38:08.761 --> 00:38:13.761
how they did in school or go go check their Goddamn Facebook page to see what

613
00:38:13.951 --> 00:38:16.820
they've liked or not liked.
Um,

614
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.040
this seems the easiest way to do it.

615
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.790
And you can just see if what shift through a entire,

616
00:38:23.791 --> 00:38:26.760
the entire nation of qualified candidates.
Well,

617
00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:28.590

here's my problem with sunglasses.

647
00:40:27.031 --> 00:40:31.650
Evidently I got all these cheap pairs to look terrible.
No,
I don't.

648
00:40:31.651 --> 00:40:36.390
I have nice sunglasses.
I have a couple cheapos and I fucking hate those,

649
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:40.230
but every time I buy a $200 pair,
I feel like I get ripped off.

650
00:40:40.231 --> 00:40:41.220
That's not the truth.

651
00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:46.370
Every time I spent $200 I ended up fucking losing it or sitting on him or drop

652
00:40:46.561 --> 00:40:51.330
him on the pavement.
Well,
our friends at movement.
Yeah,

653
00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:55.170

everybody like the Ohio State University.

672
00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:00.500
This is the black Tux.

673
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:04.670
These are the Tuxedos that those people on Ohio state were wearing when they

674
00:42:04.671 --> 00:42:07.970
sold their jerseys and he got put on suspension.

675
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:12.920
Wedding season is upon us.
It's right,
it is.

676
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:17.720
You're going to be doing it big and going out to all of your buddies weddings.

677
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:19.760
I gotta be honest with you.
Weddings are actually great now.

678
00:42:19.761 --> 00:42:23.150
Wedding sucked when I was a kid cause they was still like,

679
00:42:23.151 --> 00:42:26.240
people weren't making them individual,
they just were all the same.

680
00:42:26.241 --> 00:42:30.530
They will long and fucking boring and you would like,
when can we get to the bar?

681
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.950
Uh,
when you're bringing a date,
you want to look fresh,

682
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:39.020
but it has to be convenient.
That's where the black tux comes in to.

683
00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.990
You're not even in the wedding and you're going to wear a Tuxedo to wedding.

684
00:42:41.991 --> 00:42:44.480
That's fucking hilarious.
Going out dress the groom.

685
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.310
I liked the way these people are thinking.

686
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:51.080
The Blackstocks has awesome suits and Tuxedos and all kinds of styles and you

687
00:42:51.081 --> 00:42:53.440
rent them online.
Oh,
I get it.
You gonna wear a suit.
The,

688
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:57.950
the black Tux offers the kinds of suits and Tuxedos styles that would normally

689
00:42:57.951 --> 00:43:02.120
be wildly expensive to buy.
You might only wear it once,

690
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:07.010
like the Emerald Shawl Tuxedo.
It's funky.
It's cool.

691
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:11.540
But how many times are you going to wear an Emerald Green Tuxedo with the Black

692
00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:16.370
Tux?
You can,
you can do you and blow it out for your one big event.

693
00:43:16.371 --> 00:43:19.700
You're going to wear an Amarillo Green Tuxedo to somebody else's wedding.

694
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:23.960
You know,
when you do that,
you do that when you,
you used to be fucking the bride,

695
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:25.483
you know,

696
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:30.520
and she's doing that Douche move of inviting an old boyfriend to the wedding.

697
00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:34.340
Brigid's friends.
We're at a good place.
By the way,
as a man,

698
00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:38.060
you cannot allow that to happen.
You can not allow that to happen.

699
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:39.741
I mean,
I,

00:43:39.741 --> 00:43:42.530

because uh,

723
00:45:14.101 --> 00:45:17.400
you know whenever I send out my post its which by the way you got to see the

poster for my tour coming up,
which is simply called 50.

725
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:25.770
All right.
The big five o people.
Um,

726
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:30.390

That's the first place the posters with the tour officially gets kicked off.

728
00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:35.643
Um,

729
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.890
and I actually am not going to be using stamps.com for that just because the

730
00:45:40.891 --> 00:45:43.020
company's going to be sending it out themselves.
However,

731
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:45.720
when they send me the rest of the posters and I,

732
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:47.280
when I do Minnesota and all that,

733
00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:51.330
I will be using stamps.com and right then I'm a moron if I could figure it out.

734
00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:53.550
So can you,

738
00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.460
uh,
in Dublin and in London,

739
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:13.490
I will be coming out after the show to take pictures and sign your posts or

740
00:46:14.881 --> 00:46:17.990
something.
I that I have not done in fucking years.
Um,

741
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.240
I'm going to do that again because a,

742
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:24.660
I appreciate you guys coming out.
It is a big birthday.

743
00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:29.590
Why not?
You know,
man,
God knows I'm not in the back drinking.

744
00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.520
<v 2>Ooh.</v>

745
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:36.990
<v 1>Although I think once I get through Dublin and once I get through London,</v>

746
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:42.840
I think,
you know,
that's would be June 6th.
I think that's the night.

747
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:47.220
I might actually have a little,
uh,
a little stumped and who knows?
I don't know.

748
00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.280
But you know,
I'm bringing my whole family over there.
I can't be hung over.

749
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.450
That's another reason why my daughter's the best.
Right.
She keeps me sober.

750
00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.080
All right,
hang on one second.

751
00:46:58.081 --> 00:47:00.270
I have to look something up here because now we're going to get into the

752
00:47:00.271 --> 00:47:03.340
questions this week.
And um,

753
00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:06.540
there's a point that somebody is bringing

754
00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:12.900
some point that somebody bringing up about guns and they're doing it in the

755
00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:16.680
usual way that people do it on the Internet where they insult the other person.

756
00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:22.170
And I just want to make sure I have the definition of something up here.
Okay.

757
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.740
Bullshit.
Ar 15 response to goat guy

758
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:31.300
for those of you who don't listen all the time.
Um,

759
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:32.480
<v 0>okay.</v>

760
00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.620
<v 1>You know,
I,
I,
you know,
there's a whole gun debate.
Why do you need an Ar 15?</v>

761
00:47:36.621 --> 00:47:38.900
So I was asking people that have a,
our 15th.

762
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.860
I said the why do you have one and don't give me that bullshit about fucking,

763
00:47:42.861 --> 00:47:47.460
you know,
home defense and all of that crap.
I mean,
Jesus Christ.
I mean,
you could,

764
00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.820
I mean,
you could literally have a 22.
Oh you fuck.

765
00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.110
Anybody want to get shot by a fucking 22?

766
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.590
I would have a 22 I did a whole bit on that just because I don't want to fucking

767
00:47:57.591 --> 00:47:58.730
blow my ear drums out.

768
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.940
<v 0>Okay.</v>

769
00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.590
<v 1>I mean,
a fucking BB gun.</v>

770
00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:04.380
<v 0>Okay.</v>

771
00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.710
<v 1>You know,
we've got all those little fucking CO2 cartridges.</v>

772
00:48:06.711 --> 00:48:09.530
You shoot somebody in the fucking face with that.
They know what they gonna do.

773
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:11.700
They're going to keep that going to come,
keep walking through that,

774
00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:15.450
then go down the street and just not have to worry about anything when they walk

775
00:48:15.451 --> 00:48:18.120
into that house.
I don't know.
Anyways,
but you know,

776
00:48:18.121 --> 00:48:20.550
or to fight off the government.
That's my,
another famous want.
No,

777
00:48:20.551 --> 00:48:21.840
that's my other favorite one.

778
00:48:21.841 --> 00:48:25.020
You're going to fight off the government with your fucking semiautomatic gun

779
00:48:25.021 --> 00:48:28.610
here.
The whole government.
You're going to fight them all off.
Um,

780
00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:32.330
I got a lot of bullets,
mother fucker.
All right.
So anyways,

781
00:48:32.331 --> 00:48:37.331
so this guy ends up writing in saying that he was a sheep farmer or whatever,

782
00:48:37.861 --> 00:48:40.840
goat farm or something like that.
Gold farmer and a,

783
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:45.870
he uses the milk to make a Parmigiano reggiano and he yells,

784
00:48:46.101 --> 00:48:49.050
so you are so whenever the fuck he used two different types of cheese,

785
00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:51.030
I forget what the other kid,

786
00:48:51.031 --> 00:48:55.010
but both delicious types of cheese and there's all these coyotes and they hunt

787
00:48:55.011 --> 00:48:59.100
in packs and he's shooting at a moving target and it just made fucking sense.

788
00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:02.430
So then somebody else wrote back,
God,
that's bullshit.

789
00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:07.910
Just get some fucking dogs.
They'll fight off the coyotes,
coyotes,
a coward,

790
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.120
this guy's full of shit.
And to be randomly killing coyotes like that,

791
00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.680
you know,
mean and all that.

792
00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:19.500
So this guy is responding to the person that responded to the guy because I was

793
00:49:19.501 --> 00:49:22.290
impressed with that guy when he said that,
this is why I use it.
I'll go on.

794
00:49:22.291 --> 00:49:25.050
Oh Shit.
That makes sense.
And I like that cheese.
So God bless you.

795
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.410
Kill those coyotes.
Right.
Um,

796
00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.710
so my name's this guys responding to the person that said the tech guys still

797
00:49:31.711 --> 00:49:34.350
didn't need the gunny could just get a couple of dogs.
So anyways,
he said,

798
00:49:34.351 --> 00:49:34.741
hey pill,

799
00:49:34.741 --> 00:49:39.741
I'd like to say to the guys response about just by dogs instead of an air of 15

800
00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:44.010
does not know what the fuck he's talking about.
First of all,

801
00:49:44.011 --> 00:49:48.810
it's not a machine gun.
You dumb cunt.
It's semi automatic rifle.

802
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:53.250
Meaning you pull the trigger once in one bullet fires.
Okay,

803
00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.930
now do you see how he just made his point?

804
00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:01.010
It's not a machine gun.
You dumb cunt.

805
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:04.520
It's a semiautomatic rifle.
You should say it's not a machine gun.

806
00:50:04.521 --> 00:50:08.960
It's semiautomatic.
And then you should explain what semiotic Madec meets.

807
00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:10.340
All right,

808
00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:14.720
send me automatic doesn't just mean that you just pulled the trigger in one

809
00:50:14.721 --> 00:50:18.680
bullet fires because then literally a fucking 38 is semiautomatic.

810
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:23.720
Doesn't that mean like you can,
you can actually pull the trigger quickly faster.

811
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:25.370
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

812
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:27.760
<v 1>Where it won't get jammed or something like that mean there's something</v>

813
00:50:27.761 --> 00:50:32.110
different between just a fucking revolver,
a semiautomatic and fully automatic.

814
00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:34.030
I don't know shit about guns.
Right.
But isn't there.

815
00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:38.460
So I looked up semiautomatic firearm.
It says this,

816
00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:41.680
without calling anybody a dumb cunt,
he just not informed.

817
00:50:41.681 --> 00:50:43.420
There's a lot of information in the world.

818
00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:48.240
You can't have it all between your ears,
semiautomatic,
firearm,
or a cell.

819
00:50:48.241 --> 00:50:53.241
Floating firearm is one that not only fires a bullet each time the trigger is

820
00:50:53.291 --> 00:50:53.950
pulled,

821
00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:58.950
but also performs all steps necessary to prepare it to discharge.

822
00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.513
Again,

823
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:04.690
assuming cartridges remain in the firearm feed device,

824
00:51:04.691 --> 00:51:09.691
typically this includes extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge case from

825
00:51:11.321 --> 00:51:12.460
the firing chamber.

826
00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:17.520
Recopying the firing mechanism and loading a new cartridge into the fire firing

827
00:51:18.251 --> 00:51:21.100
chamber to fire again,
the trigger is released.

828
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:23.440
<v 0>Okay</v>

829
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.000
<v 1>to fire again.
The trigger is</v>

830
00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:25.920
<v 0>okay.</v>

831
00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:30.630
<v 1>Released and repressed again.
All right,
so now let me ask you this.
So is,</v>

832
00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:31.770
is it 38

833
00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:33.760
<v 0>okay,</v>

834
00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.600
<v 1>because the revolver turns,
is that considered semiautomatic?</v>

835
00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:39.940
Now I'm just confused.

836
00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.330
The semiautomatic,
let me look up.
Let me look this up.

837
00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:49.790
<v 0>Okay.</v>

838
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:51.680
<v 1>Is a revolver.</v>

839
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:53.250
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

840
00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:54.970
<v 1>You know,
it's funny.
People were in the gun.
Right now,</v>

841
00:51:54.971 --> 00:51:57.850
the amount of people that are listening to me like I'm a fucking moron.

842
00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.210
Like this means that they're better at math.
It's like I don't own guns.

843
00:52:01.211 --> 00:52:02.410
I don't know anything about this shit.

844
00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:05.420
If you didn't know anything about drums I wouldn't make funny cause you didn't

845
00:52:05.421 --> 00:52:09.250
know what to fucking high hat was.
Is it a revolver?
Semiautomatic?

846
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:16.620
Let's see here.
Any hit search and it takes two hours.

847
00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.310
A revolver,
which uses multiple chambers,

848
00:52:21.311 --> 00:52:26.311
any single barrel in a derringer which uses multiple chambers in multiple bears.

849
00:52:26.741 --> 00:52:28.960
Also fire one round per trigger pull,

850
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:33.520
but achieved this in different ways and as such are not classified as being

851
00:52:33.521 --> 00:52:38.330
semiautomatic,
semiautomatic pistols.

852
00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:39.550
<v 0>Okay.</v>

853
00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:41.270
<v 1>It's semi automatic pistol.</v>

854
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

855
00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:47.580
<v 1>Is a type of pistol that is semiautomatic.
I swear to God.</v>

856
00:52:47.581 --> 00:52:49.080
That's the first statement.

857
00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:55.010
Meaning it uses the energy of the fired cartridge to cycle the action of the

858
00:52:56.131 --> 00:53:00.810
firearm and advanced to the next available cartridge into position.

859
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:05.040
So basically if I don't have some revolutionary war thing,
it's just like I buy,

860
00:53:05.041 --> 00:53:05.940
put a bullet in,

861
00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:09.720
shoot and then put another bullet in or I don't have to do that cocking thing

862
00:53:09.721 --> 00:53:11.730
that you always see with the sniper rifles.

863
00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:13.800
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

864
00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.920
<v 1>All right,
so this is sort of a basic gun there.</v>

865
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:17.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

866
00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:21.100
<v 1>This just like a car with power windows and power brakes,
power steering,</v>

867
00:53:21.101 --> 00:53:22.450
like most cars have that now.

868
00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:26.290
Is that basically what you're saying when you were calling guy a dumb cunt?

869
00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:30.280
He's not a dumb cunt.
I bet that Deca what did this guy,

870
00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:34.820
what if he's a veterinarian?
It doesn't mean you're a dumb cunt.
All right.

871
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:39.490
Do you should've said you uninformed comment.
How about that?
Can we,

872
00:53:39.491 --> 00:53:42.280
can we meet in the middle there and get,
still call him a cunt,

873
00:53:42.281 --> 00:53:44.890
but just use the correct adjective?

874
00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:47.283
<v 0>MMM.</v>

875
00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:51.310
<v 1>Anyways,
just like most rifles and handguns these days.
Oh,</v>

876
00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:55.360
you actually explained it to me if I considered continued reading.
Okay.
Uh,

877
00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:59.140
first of all,
it's not a machine gun.
You'd dump con it's a semiautomatic rifle.

878
00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:02.170
Me,
you pulled the trigger once and one bullet fires.

879
00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:06.880
Just like most rifle and handguns these days,
right off the bat,
you know,

880
00:54:06.881 --> 00:54:10.870
this guy doesn't know what he's talking about and probably never shot a gun in

881
00:54:10.871 --> 00:54:13.630
his life.
Fair enough,
your honor.
That's all good.

882
00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:16.420
I usually wouldn't be this hostile,
but hey,

883
00:54:16.421 --> 00:54:20.410
I had a few drinks and I'm passionate about this subject.
All right,
fair enough.

884
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:22.140
Uh,
anyway,

885
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:27.150
I believe his argument was to buy a fleet of dogs to protect your livestock.

886
00:54:28.001 --> 00:54:32.590
He didn't say a fleet.
He said,
you know,
I get like two or three.

887
00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.530
He said,
get the fuck Outta here.
You know,

888
00:54:35.531 --> 00:54:38.770
expensive train dogs are to protect your livestock.

889
00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:43.600
I'm well do you?
Are you just drunk at a bar throwing this out?

890
00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:49.390
I mean,
Christ purebred German shepherds are eight to $900 around here.

891
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:52.890
Now you're a moron.
No one's getting a German shepherd dipper.

892
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:57.950
You get like a fucking sheepdog or a Christ.

893
00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:01.180
One of my buddies has one of those dogs.
There's smartest shit.

894
00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:06.240
I forget the name of the dog.
He wouldn't.

895
00:55:06.241 --> 00:55:09.770
You've seen and now you don't know about dogs.
He had dumb cunt.

896
00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:14.420
You uninformed cont God knows what a fucking fleet of dogs cost.

897
00:55:14.421 --> 00:55:16.520
Not to mention the food and attention.

898
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:21.680
You have to give him a or 15 prices are going down every day and with Ammo,

899
00:55:21.681 --> 00:55:26.210
well under 50 cents around,
you'd have to be a dumb ass,

900
00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:31.700
oh,
Jesus.
Parentheses or a liberal not to use this.
All right.

901
00:55:31.701 --> 00:55:34.340
And right there,
your whole argument is out the window.

902
00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:36.610
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

903
00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:41.610
<v 1>Anybody who classifies all conservatives or Republicans are all Liberals or</v>

904
00:55:41.951 --> 00:55:45.880
Democrats is morons right there.
You know what I mean?

905
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:47.210
<v 0>Okay.</v>

906
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:49.970
<v 1>That's Kinda like what I was doing earlier when I was talking about how bad the</v>

907
00:55:49.971 --> 00:55:50.830
officiating was.

908
00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:52.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

909
00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:54.590
<v 1>Against the Bruins.
However,
I did bring up that,
you know,</v>

910
00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:58.640
Marshawn should have got a fucking misconduct for taking that guy's knees up.

911
00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.990
Um,
and I did say that straight across the board.
It was,

912
00:56:02.991 --> 00:56:06.800
it's been really fucking unprofessional.
Uh,
however,

913
00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:10.340
but if I were to just sit there and say all the bad calls went against us,

914
00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.570
I mean,
I don't know.
I would beat that would be,
oh,
well,

915
00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:17.150
what kind of fucking world and kind of dual badge or liberal.

916
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:22.280
And I just made them out to all be southerners.

917
00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:25.460
Like everybody down south is a dumb ass,
which is not trope

918
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:30.330
Mark Twain.
You know what I mean?
That guy was so smart.

919
00:56:30.331 --> 00:56:33.240
He wrote all those books and Kentucky Fried Chicken had that guy dressed.

920
00:56:33.241 --> 00:56:36.900
Just like in conclusion,
he said,
in conclusion,

921
00:56:36.901 --> 00:56:40.350
as if he sees he's made this great argument,
uh,

922
00:56:40.351 --> 00:56:44.440
I think there is a huge lack of education on farms in the u s today.

923
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:50.120
He actually wrote in the US today,
he didn't capitalize the u s um,

924
00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:53.190
I would 100% agree with that.
At the end of the day,

925
00:56:53.191 --> 00:56:57.060
the Ar 15 is the most effective tool for a lot of jobs.

926
00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:02.100
A Psa.
Saleo Nashville,
your final bit fucking killed.

927
00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.170
Love you and go fuck yourself sincerely.

928
00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:08.880
Your freedom loving fans in Nashville.
Uh,
dude,

929
00:57:08.881 --> 00:57:13.110
you know something?
I gotta be honest with you.
I agreed with your points,

930
00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:18.300
but when you said dumb ass or liberal and the fact that you said freedom,

931
00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:21.450
loving,
like who doesn't love to be free?

932
00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.300
You know what I mean?
Are you another one of these peace people,

933
00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:30.240
people that thinks that isis is a major threat to a first world country with

934
00:57:30.241 --> 00:57:35.130
their no plane,
no boat,
no uniform,
no real weaponry,

935
00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:38.190
modern weaponry,
fucking army.

936
00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:44.170
You know what I mean?
Do you think if isis was,
uh,

937
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:45.700
living in the bad lands,

938
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:50.730
we would even waste of fucking second of our goddamn tax dollars to try and stop

939
00:57:50.921 --> 00:57:54.250
him?
There's plenty of fucking consult there.

940
00:57:54.251 --> 00:57:58.510
They're just not sitting on top of a bunch of fucking oil freedom.

941
00:57:58.511 --> 00:58:01.960
Loving fucking,
you know,
something you've really,

942
00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:06.310
you've really lost me there.
I mean,

943
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:09.490
if you don't agree with me,
I guess she just don't like freedom.

944
00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:13.143
Yeah.
Boy,

945
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:18.870
what I at the amount of people that are drinking that fucking Koolaid 15 years

946
00:58:19.211 --> 00:58:20.230
into this fucking thing,

947
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.770
<v 0>okay,</v>

948
00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:26.340
<v 1>it's a liberation.
They have weapons of mass destruction.</v>

949
00:58:26.341 --> 00:58:28.500
They've changed it like 90 fucking times.

950
00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:31.920
And I'm so sick of the fact that you can't criticize what the fuck were those

951
00:58:31.921 --> 00:58:36.450
fucking broke ass console over there are going to bankrupt us.

952
00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:40.590
How long can you spend $700 billion a fucking year.

953
00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.870
At some point we're going to have to pay for that.

954
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.420
I'm going to have to pay for it.
You're going to pay for it.
Our kids,

955
00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:47.070
their kids and all of that.

956
00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:53.380
Jesus fucking Christ over a bunch of jerk offs with a bag of mad

957
00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:59.590
unfucking,
believable.
Unbelievable.
You know why we're over there.
Sit Down,

958
00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:02.450
knew why we went over there.
He lit it on fire before we got there,

959
00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:06.170
but you can't say that anymore in this country because if you'd do that means

960
00:59:06.171 --> 00:59:10.340
you're an isis or you're a socialist or some shit like that.
It's just fucking,

961
00:59:10.341 --> 00:59:14.810
it's unbelievable.
It's unfucking believable be,
wow,

962
00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.350
this place is going to hell in a hand basket with a nationwide heroin epidemic.

963
00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:23.270
Our food supply is fucking poison and the got the houses back so they can cook

964
00:59:23.271 --> 00:59:27.110
the economy again.
All of that is fine.
All of that is fine,

965
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:31.640
but you should tell jokes at a fucking
presidential.

966
00:59:31.641 --> 00:59:36.020
Whatever the fuck that is,
the whole God damned world stops.
All right.
This girl,

967
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:40.850
uh,
Billy blowfish,
love you.
Delete blowfish.
I like that.

968
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:44.960
Love your podcast.
I've been listening to it every time I'm in the car.

969
00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:49.400
Driving to and from work definitely makes my commute better.
Listen,

970
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:53.750
I'm a 22 year old guy and I've been talking to this girl who has a kid.

971
00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:55.250
Now I know what you're thinking.

972
00:59:55.251 --> 00:59:58.310
What the fuck is going through your stupid fucking head.
Uh,

973
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.730
but the problem is is I think I really liked this girl.

974
01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.990
I don't think that's a problem.

975
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:07.700
As long as you're willing to take on the responsibilities of that relationship

976
01:00:07.701 --> 01:00:11.060
is nothing wrong with it.
And I,
one thing I forgot to mention,

977
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.370
I haven't even met her in person yet.
Uh,
okay.
I just,

978
01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:21.050
I just dropped the microphone on that one.
I'm supposed to meet her.

979
01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:22.820
I supposed to meet up with there.
Okay.

980
01:00:22.821 --> 01:00:27.230
I just saw you were stalking her on social media.
I'm supposed to meet her.

981
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:32.930
I was supposed to go meet her up this Saturday.
Is that a new expression?

982
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:36.470
I think you said you didn't think you meant to say meet up with her this

983
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:39.380
Saturday night after work and I'm not sure what will happen.

984
01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:44.930
The thing is she's exactly like me.
She's vegetarian,

985
01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:49.250
she likes animals and nature,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

986
01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.710
What's the Nashville Guy doing right now?
Yeah,

987
01:00:51.711 --> 01:00:56.540
she likes all that but doesn't laugh.
Um,

988
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:59.570
but she has a fucking kid bill.

989
01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:04.160
I'm fucking 22 years old and can't stop thinking about this girl who has a

990
01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.950
fucking kid.
Please give me some advice.

991
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.320
I'm not sure how to proceed.

992
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.700
Well I think you're very concerned with the responsibilities of the fact that

993
01:01:13.701 --> 01:01:18.350
she has a kid and what that's gonna mean and you're only 22 years old and

994
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:21.440
there's fucking nothing wrong with that.
Okay.

995
01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:25.070
And don't let all these fucking don't don't ask a woman about this cause she's

996
01:01:25.071 --> 01:01:28.790
just going to stick up for the fucking woman because she's going to insert

997
01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:30.800
herself into that situation would be like,
well,

998
01:01:30.801 --> 01:01:33.590
I'd still like to be able to find love just cause I have a kid to,

999
01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:37.940
you're 22 years old,
you are a kid.
All right.

1000
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:43.160
Unless you're like really mature or something like that,
that that is a major,

1001
01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:48.680
uh,
detail that you should be thinking about.
All right?

1002
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:50.360
So,
uh,

1003
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:55.700
I would respect the fact that there's a voice in your head that's saying,
dude,

1004
01:01:55.701 --> 01:02:00.020
she's got a fucking kid.
All right.
Before,

1005
01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:03.710
uh,
you know,
because I would tell you right now,
dude,

1006
01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:08.440
like what's you're getting involved in there?
You know,
if that goes south,

1007
01:02:08.441 --> 01:02:10.490
you're going to break two hearts.
Okay.

1008
01:02:10.491 --> 01:02:14.150
Cause there's two people that are going to fall in love with you in that thing.

1009
01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:15.170
So make sure you're,

1010
01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:20.171
you're prepared and you don't waste her time and that poor kid's time.

1011
01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:25.770
All right,
so there you go.
That's my advice to you.

1012
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:29.150
This isn't,
you know,
oh look at it.
Tits.

1013
01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:33.150
I want to fuck her or this is not that situation,
you know.
All right.

1014
01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:36.270
Advice Dick,
that douchebag friend,

1015
01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:42.660
dear Billy angel tits.
Um,
I didn't know what that means.

1016
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.160
Anytime anybody calls me an angel,
I take that as a compliment.
Um,

1017
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:51.390
I guess cause there is white as an angels gown,

1018
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.240
maybe it's an insult.
I don't know.
Billy red tits,
Billy devil tits.

1019
01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:01.770
It can go either way on that.
Um,
love the podcast.

1020
01:03:01.771 --> 01:03:05.970
I thank you a sense you're always offering great wisdom and words to live by.

1021
01:03:05.971 --> 01:03:08.940
I'm really not.
I'm a fucking moron and you guys listen to me for some reason.

1022
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:14.240
Maybe you could help me out with this one for the sake of a nymity hope I said

1023
01:03:14.311 --> 01:03:16.920
that right.
Let's call this Douche bag friend of mine.

1024
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:21.950
Dick Dick is the kind of person that can get annoying and touchy towards women

1025
01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:26.250
when he's drunk to the point where it starts to border on harassment.

1026
01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.440
It's always weird.

1027
01:03:27.441 --> 01:03:31.650
It always weirds me the fuck out and I don't know how to address this behavior.

1028
01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:36.990
Simple be like,
hey deck where you fucking knock it off.
Well.

1029
01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:41.450
What's wrong with you?
Keep your hands.
See Yourself.
He goes,
a few weeks ago,

1030
01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:46.070
he met this 18 year old girl at a bar.
What the fuck she doing at a bar,

1031
01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:48.200
which we had a great time with.

1032
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:53.120
We all went to Dick's house afterwards for a couple more dicks drink,
sorry.

1033
01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:55.970
And Dick tried to make some moves on this girl.

1034
01:03:56.270 --> 01:04:00.530
He couldn't get into her pants that night.
However,
however,
last Friday he did.

1035
01:04:00.830 --> 01:04:02.270
Now this is where it gets crazy.

1036
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:09.670
The next day he took the girl to a yearly festival to celebrate Liberation Day

1037
01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:13.370
where he and I and a whole bunch of friends I had planned to meet up.

1038
01:04:13.371 --> 01:04:15.830
This is obviously from another country,
I don't know,
a liberation day.

1039
01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:21.100
She basically only knew me and him about 15 minutes into meeting each other

1040
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:24.890
there,
the girls started puking up foam.

1041
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:32.490
As it turns out,
she hadn't eaten all day and it popped a pill of ecstasy,

1042
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:37.010
which he had given to her.
Oh my God.

1043
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:39.830
He didn't seem to care what was happening.

1044
01:04:39.831 --> 01:04:44.831
So I decided to take her to the bathroom area to clean her up and I brought her

1045
01:04:45.261 --> 01:04:48.080
some water and then we went back to look for Dick.
Well,

1046
01:04:48.081 --> 01:04:51.440
why would you take her back to him?
When we finally found him,
let me guess.

1047
01:04:51.441 --> 01:04:54.050
He was trying to hook up with somebody else.
I told Dick like to,

1048
01:04:54.051 --> 01:04:55.400
she hasn't eaten all day,
man.

1049
01:04:55.401 --> 01:04:58.550
She was puking back there and you should get her son to eat.

1050
01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.380
And what did this mother fucking do?

1051
01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.520
He quickly walked away and left me to deal with this 18 year old chick for the

1052
01:05:04.521 --> 01:05:05.750
rest of the entire day.

1053
01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:10.040
We didn't see him again for the rest of the day and we made no effort in trying

1054
01:05:10.041 --> 01:05:10.660
to,

1055
01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:15.440
he made no effort and trying to find us what a Dick being the gentleman that I

1056
01:05:15.441 --> 01:05:20.200
am,
I decided to stay with to guide her through this ecstasy trip.

1057
01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:21.773
Uh,

1058
01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:27.640
I gave her some food and tried to have fun and even though we did have fun,

1059
01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:31.720
it had already ruined that day for me.
He tried to contact me today,

1060
01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:34.360
but I'm really questioning whether he even deserves a response.

1061
01:05:34.361 --> 01:05:34.991
What do you think,
Bill?

1062
01:05:34.991 --> 01:05:38.500
Should I give this ticket another chance or it's just the kind of person you

1063
01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:41.110
want to cut out of your life.
Complete me things.
I'll tell you too.

1064
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:45.820
This is the no brainer.
I pick up the phone and I would just tell him like,
dude,

1065
01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:50.821
you are a fucking piece of shit and your behavior around women is completely

1066
01:05:53.171 --> 01:05:54.250
unacceptable.

1067
01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:00.040
To the point I would warn other women to stay away from you and I don't want to

1068
01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:05.041
be friends with a person like you have a nice life and God bless the United

1069
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.690
States of America.
I mean that's it.
That's an easy one.

1070
01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:11.500
I don't even have to think about that one.
All right.
Fuck banks.

1071
01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:12.851
Bill,

1072
01:06:12.851 --> 01:06:16.390
I'm writing to you because I believe you are the only man crazy and angry enough

1073
01:06:16.391 --> 01:06:20.350
to relate with me on this dude.
Fuck banks.

1074
01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:25.410
Fuck them all this month I just found out I owe my bank $45 apparently fitness

1075
01:06:26.231 --> 01:06:30.490
connection attempted to withdraw $10 from my account these past two months.

1076
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:35.230
Once a month at about $5 in my bank two months ago.

1077
01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:40.590
This could not cover the $10 fee a month for my gym membership twice.

1078
01:06:41.381 --> 01:06:46.381
So now I'm being charged a fee of 40 dive $5 even though one it's debit to

1079
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:50.890
fitness,
didn't actually withdraw the money.
They only attempted to,

1080
01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:55.770
nothing went through.
So not only do I owe my bank $45 Buddy,

1081
01:06:55.771 --> 01:07:00.771
oh so fitness connection about 50 in late fees and the $2 to $10 fees that never

1082
01:07:02.471 --> 01:07:03.304
got paid.

1083
01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:07.780
Please explain to me why I'm being charged for this transaction that didn't go

1084
01:07:07.781 --> 01:07:08.614
through.

1085
01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:13.680
Is there a guy working in the dark room at the bank pushing buttons who they

1086
01:07:14.141 --> 01:07:16.750
have to pay for the transaction services?
No,

1087
01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.170
it's all fucking ones and Zeros.
All computers.

1088
01:07:20.171 --> 01:07:24.820
Yet another fee that we as consumers,
except for no reason at all,

1089
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.410
even if it makes no sense.

1090
01:07:26.411 --> 01:07:30.130
The idea of letting an entities such as a bank holds your money,

1091
01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.700
seems to carry way more cons than it does parks.

1092
01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:39.070
I'm taking your advice and I'm going to call and complain until I get what I

1093
01:07:39.071 --> 01:07:43.120
want.
Fuck banks forever.
Now.
All my money lives in the walls.

1094
01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.910
If the house burns down then so be it.

1095
01:07:45.911 --> 01:07:47.800
But at least I didn't get fucked by the man.

1096
01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:50.980
Keep the good work and good luck to you Celtics.

1097
01:07:50.981 --> 01:07:54.310
Jason Tatum is looking like a baller.
All right.

1098
01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:56.800
I agree with a lot of things you're saying there,

1099
01:07:56.801 --> 01:08:01.570
but what you didn't take responsibility for was your own actions that led to

1100
01:08:01.571 --> 01:08:03.550
this.
All right?

1101
01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.630
If you know that you owe your gym $10 a month,

1102
01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.960
you're going to have to fucking have that in your bank account.

1103
01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:14.830
You didn't have that.
So then,
um,
I don't know how it works.

1104
01:08:14.831 --> 01:08:19.320
I know you write a check the,
and it bounces.
There's a fee.

1105
01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.090
So you're saying this is debit,

1106
01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:25.290
but you're using your debit like paying cash and everything.

1107
01:08:25.291 --> 01:08:30.090
So I actually don't think banks are out of line for doing that.

1108
01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:35.120
Why would I think is you need to be more responsible with the money and like I

1109
01:08:36.901 --> 01:08:41.890
agree with you.
Banks are fucking evil.
It's a giant Ponzi scheme.
Um,

1110
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.600
there's nothing behind the fucking money,
but everybody believes in it.
So,
hey,

1111
01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.470
we live another day.
All right.
Um,

1112
01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:55.080
but the thing about it is,
is you have to learn to make money work for you.

1113
01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:57.150
And if you don't understand money,

1114
01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:01.110
the wonderful thing about the internet is if you stop,
you know,

1115
01:09:01.111 --> 01:09:05.370
reading people screaming about politics or watching online porn and all of that

1116
01:09:05.371 --> 01:09:08.050
Shit,
which I've been guilty of,
all of that stuff,

1117
01:09:08.051 --> 01:09:11.830
that's actually a lot of things that you can learn.
And,
um,

1118
01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:17.690
what I've learned about money is that money can set you free or it can in

1119
01:09:18.111 --> 01:09:18.870
prison.
You,

1120
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:22.680
and it all depends on the choices that you're making and the choices that you're

1121
01:09:22.681 --> 01:09:23.071
making.

1122
01:09:23.071 --> 01:09:27.870
Sur are horrific and back in the day would have landed you and all of your

1123
01:09:27.871 --> 01:09:32.370
family and to debtor's prison.
So you got off easy in the modern world.

1124
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:37.190
Um,
uh,

1125
01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:39.920
you know,
I guess taking your money out of the banks,
you know,

1126
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:41.930
putting you in your walls.
I,
you know,

1127
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:46.850
I don't disagree with that past a certain amount of fucking money,
but,
uh,
I,

1128
01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:51.410
I like to invest in things that are tangible.
I'm into real estate.

1129
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:55.310
I'm into buying apartment buildings.
And Shit like that.
Um,

1130
01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:59.300
you always have to hedge your bets.
Like I'm buying apartment buildings,

1131
01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.960
just starting to do that.
And I was like,
I bought a bunch of looking at one,

1132
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.770
right?

1133
01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:08.770
Because it fascinates me to have income coming into my house every month.

1134
01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:16.070
That's not actually in the business that I'm in and the business that I'm in now

1135
01:10:16.071 --> 01:10:19.700
considering now with social media,
somebody can just say,

1136
01:10:19.701 --> 01:10:23.970
you did something and there's no,
um,

1137
01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.360
what do you call it?
There's no due process or anything.

1138
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:32.130
And that could literally cause everybody in the business you're in to just walk

1139
01:10:32.131 --> 01:10:36.150
away from you and then,
then what do you do?

1140
01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.970
You know?
So,
uh,

1141
01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.920
and that's just a new pitfall in this fucked up business that I'm in,
which,

1142
01:10:44.921 --> 01:10:49.450
you know,
even before all that,
me too.
Shit,
I mean you,
you see these movie stars,

1143
01:10:49.451 --> 01:10:51.010
one hit after another,
one after another,

1144
01:10:51.011 --> 01:10:54.010
and all of a sudden they have a couple of flops in a row and then they just

1145
01:10:54.011 --> 01:10:57.610
disappear.
So this business has always been fickle as hell.

1146
01:10:57.611 --> 01:10:59.710
So I planned on doing this anyways.

1147
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:02.800
But after all of that stuff came out and like,
you know,

1148
01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:04.570
just recently looking at Tom Brokaw stuff,

1149
01:11:04.571 --> 01:11:06.040
I don't know if he's guilty or innocent,

1150
01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:09.580
but the fact that two people can just accuse him

1151
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:14.080
and which is their right,

1152
01:11:14.081 --> 01:11:19.081
but the amount of people that just on the accusations now just look at that guy

1153
01:11:19.151 --> 01:11:23.140
like he's a complete piece of shit is uh,

1154
01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:25.300
isn't right,

1155
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:30.490
is it isn't any more right than if he actually did what they said they were

1156
01:11:30.491 --> 01:11:34.270
doing.
And then he's actually guilty of it.
But to just,
you know,
an accusation,

1157
01:11:34.271 --> 01:11:37.420
it's just an accusation.
But the amount of people that then take that as,

1158
01:11:38.230 --> 01:11:42.100
you know,
the game set match is,
um,

1159
01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:48.400
I mean it's just how the world works.
It's just how it works.

1160
01:11:48.401 --> 01:11:52.330
So,
um,
you need to learn about money.

1161
01:11:52.331 --> 01:11:56.350
Can't just say fuck banks and then just be antisocial and have your like money

1162
01:11:56.351 --> 01:12:01.040
in the walls.
I mean,
you can use banks as long as you know what,
what,

1163
01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.560
what the game is,
you can use it in your favor.
And,

1164
01:12:05.561 --> 01:12:09.660
um,
and if you just resist

1165
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:16.630
the stupidity of consumption and flat screen TVs and all of this shit that these

1166
01:12:17.931 --> 01:12:21.890
stupid fucking celebrity show you when they go into their houses and all,

1167
01:12:21.891 --> 01:12:26.180
I had this stupid,
they all,
what they're showing you is a,
a fucking,

1168
01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:32.150
the only thing that's impressive is that house,
everything else is,
uh,
is it?

1169
01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:36.170
There's a liability.
It's all depreciating assets.
They're fucking cars,

1170
01:12:36.171 --> 01:12:39.530
all of that shit.
You know what I mean?

1171
01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:43.370
Those stupid supercar that does fucking idiots buy that.
You know,

1172
01:12:43.371 --> 01:12:46.970
the only place you really should be taken it is to a track she can actually
know,

1173
01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:51.620
open the thing up.
And then all of those cards,
like,
you know,

1174
01:12:51.621 --> 01:12:53.420
you look at those four gts,

1175
01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:58.900
I saw one the other day for sale and it was like fucking 10,

1176
01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:03.890
15 years old and it was high miles.
It had 6,000 miles on it.

1177
01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:07.940
Now it retained most of its value,
but it's just,
I dunno,

1178
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:09.890
I guess unless you're going to buy those things,

1179
01:13:09.891 --> 01:13:12.200
but all of those flat screen TVs,

1180
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:17.370
the monogram fucking stupid shit,
the oil painting yourself,
it's just a bunch.

1181
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:20.960
It's a bunch of shit.
It's fucking stupid.

1182
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:27.050
Um,
the pots and pans that you buy that rather than just buying the ones that

1183
01:13:27.051 --> 01:13:27.561
target,

1184
01:13:27.561 --> 01:13:32.210
you go out and you gotta go to fucking foofy Foose fucking place and getting by

1185
01:13:32.211 --> 01:13:36.670
the,
these Gore may level fucking pots and pans to heat up.

1186
01:13:36.671 --> 01:13:39.290
We have fish sticks because at the end of the day,

1187
01:13:39.291 --> 01:13:41.750
you're still dead blue collared jerk off.

1188
01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:45.890
It's all a fucking waste of money and it's just a bunch of shit.
Now,

1189
01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:50.790
if you actually take your money right,
you know,
and,

1190
01:13:50.791 --> 01:13:53.570
and learn how to invest it,

1191
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.120
and then your money starts making money.
That's when you flip it.

1192
01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:01.850
When your money is earning you fucking money.

1193
01:14:01.851 --> 01:14:06.140
When you're fucking sitting on a couch watching a game and your money is out

1194
01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:10.270
there and making you fucking money,
then you understand it.
Um,

1195
01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:13.730
and I mean,
I don't even understand it.
Okay.

1196
01:14:13.731 --> 01:14:18.700
But I'm just starting to learn how to do it.
And the,
the,
I don't,

1197
01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:21.740
they just,
it's nowhere in the educational system.

1198
01:14:21.741 --> 01:14:24.710
You have to seek out that knowledge yourself.
Like most

1199
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:28.550
quality knowledge that's out there,

1200
01:14:28.551 --> 01:14:30.950
you have to seek it out because people aren't going to give it to you.

1201
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:34.520
So that's what I would say.
So I feel few that you're in that position.

1202
01:14:34.521 --> 01:14:36.680
I've been in that position,
but uh,

1203
01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:40.700
I wouldn't say fuck banks use banks rather than have bank.
Shoo.
Shoo.
All right.

1204
01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.510
There you go.
It's a long explanation,
but an important subject.
All right.

1205
01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:49.310
My sister's dead beat boyfriend.
Dear terror,
Billy.

1206
01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.420
I mean,
what that means.
I'm a,

1207
01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.650
I'm a junior in high school and I live with my mother,

1208
01:14:54.710 --> 01:14:59.190
sister and her dead beat boyfriend.
Wow.
Uh,

1209
01:14:59.510 --> 01:15:03.010
he moved in with intentions to pay rent and help fix up our house.

1210
01:15:03.011 --> 01:15:04.790
That is slowly falling apart.

1211
01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:09.830
Is this Dwight Yoakam from fucking a sling blade,
but for the past year,

1212
01:15:09.831 --> 01:15:13.670
this losers had no job and pass paid no rent.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1213
01:15:13.671 --> 01:15:15.950
He's a gold digging whores.
Uh,

1214
01:15:15.951 --> 01:15:19.010
all he does is sleep all day and play Xbox.

1215
01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:24.100
He also mentally manipulates my sister by telling her things like her family

1216
01:15:24.261 --> 01:15:28.100
doesn't care enough about her to give her a funeral.

1217
01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.153
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1218
01:15:31.190 --> 01:15:32.023
<v 1>Oh my God.</v>

1219
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:35.860
You got to get this guy out of the house while he gets high and drunk and totes

1220
01:15:35.861 --> 01:15:36.980
is guns around.

1221
01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.120
My mom has on multiple occasions threatened to kick him out because,

1222
01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:45.550
but she won't in fear that my sister will go with him.

1223
01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.180
What in the fuck is
I,

1224
01:15:54.810 --> 01:15:58.490
I don't even understand how a parent loses his level of control in their own

1225
01:15:58.491 --> 01:16:02.720
house.
So bill,
what do you think I should do about this situation?

1226
01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.960
Thank you for being sit damn fire.
Thank you.
All right,

1227
01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:10.060
looking forward to season three a,

1228
01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:12.270
what do you think I should do?
Um,

1229
01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.120
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1230
01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:18.390
<v 1>you got to sit down and talk to your mom
and he just say,
mom,</v>

1231
01:16:18.391 --> 01:16:20.820
I know this is a difficult situation,

1232
01:16:20.821 --> 01:16:25.800
but you got to kick this guy out of the house.
Um,
he's drunk and he's,
he's,

1233
01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:28.620
he's walking around with guns.
You got to choose your family first.

1234
01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:33.780
And if our sister chooses him over us,
then so be it.
I mean,
that's it,
dude.

1235
01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:36.870
You got to get that guy out of the fucking house.
Fuck that loser.
That's it.

1236
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:41.830
These are all cut and dry as this week dumped at fucking Douche.

1237
01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:46.320
Banded that check after he gave her the ecstasy learn,
you know,

1238
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:49.170
learn how to fucking use money correctly and get this fucking guy out of the

1239
01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:50.004
house.

1240
01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:51.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1241
01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.390
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
I feel like I'm cheating on a test here.
These are easy this week.</v>

1242
01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:59.310
Sit Down with your mom and just say,
we've got to kick this guy out.
Um,

1243
01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:01.190
<v 0>okay.</v>

1244
01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:06.140
<v 1>And this is what I would do.
I would,
um,
if you need to,</v>

1245
01:17:06.141 --> 01:17:09.390
I would call the cops before you kick them out.

1246
01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:10.620
If you think he's going to be a problem.

1247
01:17:10.621 --> 01:17:12.910
I would have the cops come down there and say,
ah,

1248
01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:14.550
I don't want this guy in my house anymore.

1249
01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:18.840
He does have firearms and I want them out of the house.
Um,

1250
01:17:19.230 --> 01:17:22.260
what a fucking loser.
Alright.

1251
01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:25.200
Dumped because of infidelity 20 years ago.

1252
01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:28.470
A big Billy Ball balls,

1253
01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:32.980
massive fan of the podcast and your specials have had me in stitches.
Oh,

1254
01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:35.070
thank you.
Um,

1255
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:41.150
I really need your advice,
opinions,
opinions,

1256
01:17:41.151 --> 01:17:43.580
sliced advice on a situation with recent issues.

1257
01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:46.490
I've just broken up with an amazing lady.

1258
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:49.070
The woman I was going to propose to this month.

1259
01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:52.010
We had been to get together eight months.

1260
01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:57.770
When you get to your late 30 she can cut through the bullshit pretty quickly and

1261
01:17:57.771 --> 01:17:59.570
get to a meaningful relationship.

1262
01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:02.510
I knew she was the one I want him to spend the rest of my life with.

1263
01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:07.100
Our relationship had been great.
No arguments,
lots of fun,
laughter and love.

1264
01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:12.340
Only one issue existed between us and it seems to have caused the end of the

1265
01:18:13.011 --> 01:18:17.180
relationship not long after we started dating.

1266
01:18:17.181 --> 01:18:21.500
We were out having drinks and we were talking lately about past relationship and

1267
01:18:21.501 --> 01:18:25.580
she asked if I'd ever been unfaithful.
I want it to be honest and said yes.

1268
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:30.230
She asked to know more and I just described a time when I was 20 and I had been

1269
01:18:30.231 --> 01:18:32.330
an idiot and cheated on my girlfriend at the time.

1270
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:36.560
I stressed that I regretted it and have never entertained the thought of doing

1271
01:18:36.561 --> 01:18:38.630
that again.
I am simply not the same guy.

1272
01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:43.460
She reacted barely badly leaving the pub crying outside before coming back in

1273
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.410
and telling me she wished I'd lied.
We managed to get past it though.

1274
01:18:48.411 --> 01:18:53.330
That night,
Dude,
you were 20 the relationship went on his normal.

1275
01:18:53.331 --> 01:18:57.770
We shared many weekends and holidays,
Fun Nights out,
cozy nights in,

1276
01:18:58.070 --> 01:19:01.850
talked about a future together and I was invited to share Christmas and new

1277
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:05.330
years with their entire family was great.
Even as recently as last week,

1278
01:19:05.331 --> 01:19:09.410
she was redesigning my garden for use in the summer.

1279
01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.640
It is rear its head two more times since then.

1280
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:18.350
One saw my birthday in January when we nearly broke up over it and she was

1281
01:19:18.351 --> 01:19:21.470
struggling with it again.
She was so upset,
kept saying,

1282
01:19:21.471 --> 01:19:23.240
why couldn't you have just lied?

1283
01:19:23.690 --> 01:19:28.690
But we talked through and moved on again or so I thought and then of course

1284
01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:31.430
recently when it all ended,

1285
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:36.020
every time it has come up had been honest and shown true remorse and been very

1286
01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:36.854
supportive.

1287
01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:42.160
Very recently we broke up because she just can't get past my past and said it's

1288
01:19:42.381 --> 01:19:45.530
the only thing stopping her from committing to me fully.
She loves me.

1289
01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:50.360
Wanted to be talking about having shoulder with me,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1290
01:19:50.361 --> 01:19:52.930
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I don't need to reread the less this.

1291
01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:58.820
Everywhere you look,
all you hear is the once a cheater,
always a cheater lines.

1292
01:19:58.821 --> 01:20:01.940
What should my case simply is not true.
I know

1293
01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:06.690
that's some of this stems from one of her past relationship,

1294
01:20:06.691 --> 01:20:10.740
which ended 2016 when she was engaged and the guy broke it off and ran off in

1295
01:20:10.741 --> 01:20:13.050
front of her friends.
I don't want to lose this lady.

1296
01:20:13.051 --> 01:20:15.990
Only back on Valentine's Day,

1297
01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:18.180
she made me present.

1298
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1299
01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.290
<v 1>Okay.
Back on Valentine's Day.</v>

1300
01:20:22.291 --> 01:20:25.110
She made me a present of a lot of reasons why she loves me.

1301
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:28.080
One of them was that she thinks about the future.

1302
01:20:28.081 --> 01:20:32.910
She only saw it with me and then I made her feel like no one else has.

1303
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:38.370
This can surely be saved,
but I don't understand it and I don't know what to do.

1304
01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.790
Thanks bill and go fuck yourself.
Well,
I mean,
what the fuck can you do?

1305
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:46.710
I mean,
if she's going to judge you by what you did when you were 20 years old,

1306
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:50.190
I just laid on table said,
listen,
I want to marry you.
All right,

1307
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:53.430
well there's nothing I could do to make,
you know,

1308
01:20:53.431 --> 01:20:55.470
I'm paying for the sins of that last guy.

1309
01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.660
And if you want to throw this relationship because of that away,

1310
01:20:58.670 --> 01:21:03.060
because of that last guy that's on you.
Dude,
you've done all you can do here,

1311
01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:05.960
need done,
all you can do here.

1312
01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:11.000
So she's obviously not over that other guy or the pain of that other guy and now

1313
01:21:11.001 --> 01:21:13.760
you're paying for it.
Um,

1314
01:21:15.850 --> 01:21:16.683
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1315
01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:18.560
<v 1>I dunno.
So I mean what the fuck can you do?</v>

1316
01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:21.260
I would just tell her how I feel about her and just say,
listen,

1317
01:21:21.261 --> 01:21:25.340
I'm ready to get married anytime you want to,
but um,

1318
01:21:26.690 --> 01:21:30.200
if you don't,
then you got to let me go and I got to move on.
I got to get,

1319
01:21:30.230 --> 01:21:30.471
you know,

1320
01:21:30.471 --> 01:21:34.370
cause I'm in my late thirties and if you don't trust me enough that I'm not

1321
01:21:34.371 --> 01:21:38.830
going to fuck around on you,
then I,
you know,
I don't want to tell you
did,

1322
01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:42.080
I guess it is over,
but it's going to be your call.
It's not my call.

1323
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:46.400
Something like that.
I Dunno.
That's a tough one buddy.
All right.
The last one,

1324
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:48.130
last one at Jesus's along pockets.

1325
01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:52.010
Did I blow my chances with this girl from work?
Hello,

1326
01:21:52.011 --> 01:21:56.510
Bill Nye the angry guy.
I'll keep this as short as I can.

1327
01:21:58.310 --> 01:22:03.020
Who just opened that door?
Hey Buddy.
Hey,

1328
01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:07.880
what's up cutie pie?
Um,

1329
01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:10.720
I guess I'm watching you right now.
Hi.

1330
01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:20.000
What's going on?
Don't pull the cord.
Don't pull the cord.

1331
01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:22.730
All right.
Yeah.

1332
01:22:22.731 --> 01:22:26.840
Help me out with this one guys acid that I blow my chances with this girl from

1333
01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:30.710
work.
Hello,
Bill Nye the angry guy.
I'll keep it short as I can.

1334
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:32.990
I work with this girl that is a solid 10.

1335
01:22:32.991 --> 01:22:36.440
She's absolutely gorgeous and a personality matches mine in a hundred different

1336
01:22:36.441 --> 01:22:40.910
ways and she's a nerdy chick,
which is a massive plus.
If you saw her,

1337
01:22:40.911 --> 01:22:44.720
you'd say,
holy s,
why does she work in a place like this?

1338
01:22:44.721 --> 01:22:48.950
Can Curse my kids here a quick and simple.
I got to know her.

1339
01:22:48.951 --> 01:22:53.480
We constantly flirted back,
back and forward,
not back and forth near.

1340
01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:57.680
They flirted back and forward.
Uh,
she put a lot of attention on me.

1341
01:22:57.710 --> 01:23:00.140
Not to sound egotistical,
but I'm a good looking.

1342
01:23:00.710 --> 01:23:04.490
I thought he said 62 year old guy's six foot two guy.

1343
01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:09.470
My issue is that when I get too comfortable,

1344
01:23:09.471 --> 01:23:14.471
I began to spill my red flags and I start to describe my self confidence issues.

1345
01:23:15.230 --> 01:23:20.090
I guess I do this to see if she's okay with them.
Bad move.
Yes it is.

1346
01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:24.350
After working with her for nearly a year and a half now she seems distant.
Yeah,

1347
01:23:24.351 --> 01:23:27.980
you probably weighed two.
What?
We used to watch the same shows,

1348
01:23:27.981 --> 01:23:29.090
not physically together,

1349
01:23:29.091 --> 01:23:32.860
but then come to work the next day and have long conversations about hos and

1350
01:23:32.861 --> 01:23:36.110
though they were,
she used to make efforts to initiate conversation.

1351
01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:39.680
Now she barely acknowledges me anymore.
It was,
it was really sudden.
Well,

1352
01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:44.650
she probably met someone.
I'm not trying to be a dick here.
I've tried,
uh,

1353
01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:48.140
a lot to strike up conversation,
but she acts this interested.

1354
01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:52.720
I started trying to make her jealous,
but she doesn't seem to give a f.
Uh,

1355
01:23:52.721 --> 01:23:55.960
we work in a almost exclusive male workplace,

1356
01:23:55.961 --> 01:24:00.190
so of course everyone is trying to get with her.
It burns my blood to watch it,

1357
01:24:00.191 --> 01:24:02.980
but it's my fault.
Is there anything I can do to resist the perverse,

1358
01:24:02.981 --> 01:24:07.270
my situation or vice sealed this case shut.
Thanks for reading.

1359
01:24:07.271 --> 01:24:11.530
Please come to,
I'm not going to say the city in case she's listening.
Um,

1360
01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:16.220
yeah,
I think you blew it with her.
The only girlfriend broke up with you.

1361
01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:19.170
Your work girlfriend broke up with.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1362
01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:22.150
I think what you need to do is move on and uh,

1363
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:26.250
stop talking about your confidence issues.
He need to get some confidence in.

1364
01:24:26.251 --> 01:24:31.090
You need to get outside the workplace and you need to start hitting on some

1365
01:24:31.091 --> 01:24:34.450
women and he need to go on dates and then you're going to feel more confident

1366
01:24:34.451 --> 01:24:35.284
about yourself.

1367
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:38.430
And that's the best way to try and make this woman more interested in you.

1368
01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:43.240
All right.
Don't s where you eat anyway,
right.
Don't ask where you eat.

1369
01:24:43.450 --> 01:24:47.380
Yeah.
Yeah,
because yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.

1370
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:49.720
Well,
this guy doesn't have confidence,

1371
01:24:49.721 --> 01:24:52.150
so he's not going to walk up to a woman that doesn't really know he needs to get

1372
01:24:52.151 --> 01:24:55.070
over that hub,
which is why it works.

1373
01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:56.860
Because there's a reason they're supposed to be there.

1374
01:24:56.861 --> 01:24:59.320
He feels more comfortable and he,
you know,

1375
01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:02.050
she was probably waiting for him to ask around and then he didn't.

1376
01:25:02.051 --> 01:25:05.230
And then now it sounds like she's with somebody else.
Yeah.

1377
01:25:05.231 --> 01:25:08.980
Or She's just over his,
just over it,
you know,

1378
01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.340
that'll fun.
Like I said,
work boyfriend,

1379
01:25:12.341 --> 01:25:17.230
girlfriend relationship and now she's moved on.
There you go.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

1380
01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:20.320
yeah.
Do plenty of fish in the sea,
you know,

1381
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:22.390
and don't waste your time getting jealous,

1382
01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:27.280
but this person just like you go in there,
you know,
you don't care.
Huh?
Hi.

1383
01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.193
Hi.

1384
01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.273
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1385
01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:32.390
<v 1>Yeah.
What's up?
Smiley.</v>

1386
01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:37.130
<v 0>Hi.
Please say hi.</v>

1387
01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:38.760
<v 1>Um,
you know,</v>

1388
01:25:38.770 --> 01:25:41.680
it's funny now as she speaks jibberish but she knows exactly what she's saying

1389
01:25:41.681 --> 01:25:44.770
and then she'll just throw in a random real world.
Should be like,
I should check,

1390
01:25:44.771 --> 01:25:48.920
check,
check,
check,
check.
Hi,
Huh?

1391
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:51.860
Yeah.
You want to tell some stories?
All right.

1392
01:25:51.861 --> 01:25:55.070
That's the podcast for this week a go.

1393
01:25:55.071 --> 01:25:59.700
You know what yourselves and I'll check in on you on Thursday.
Bye.

1394
01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:04.530
Yeah.
Congratulations to the Tampa Bay lightning.
Yup.
Yup.

1395
01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:07.480
Bunch of BS.
All right.
I'll talk to you later.
