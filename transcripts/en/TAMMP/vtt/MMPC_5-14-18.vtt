00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.510
Hey,

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:07.770
It's time for the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,
Monday,

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.810
May 14th,
2018 how are you?
What is going on with you?

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.540
Oh really?
Is that is,
that is interesting.

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.470
I just feel like for me,

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.150
do you know I went to a a for mother's Day,
by the way.

7
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:28.820
Happy Belated Mother's Day out there for all the women out there who love
others.

8
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.420
It,
you know,
there's nothing more important are loving it.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.100
Gallery the way they go on and on about mothers.

10
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.900
Remember that on Father's Day?
Jesus Christ.
That's like a fucking blurb,

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.550
you know,
at the bottom of the stock exchange.
Oh,
by the way,
happy father's Day.

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.373
<v 0>MMM.</v>

13
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.400
<v 1>There's nothing more important.
Hey.
Um,</v>

14
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.860
anyways.
Anyways.
You know what I mean?
They're,
they're,
they're the quarterback.

15
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.490
They get all the fucking glory.
He is a father.
You're the left tackle,
you know,

16
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:01.560
protecting their ass and nobody gives a shit.

17
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.790
They don't even know when you get trade.

18
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.520
Nobody's sitting in the stands wearing your jersey.
Right.

19
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.990
Who the fuck buys a fucking left tackles fucking Goddamn Jersey.

20
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.453
<v 0>MMM.</v>

21
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.060
<v 1>Is it the guard?
Is it the guard position?
Is that the one that's all important?</v>

22
00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:16.471
Is that though,

23
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:19.900
and I'm sure everybody who plays fantasy football and never competed in their

24
00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:22.510
life will let me know that that's not exactly,
it's not to tackle,

25
00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:25.420
it's the guard or is it to tackle?
I don't give a fuck.

26
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.323
<v 0>MMM.</v>

27
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.870
<v 1>So we went to the,
uh,
the Getty villa,
which is a museum.</v>

28
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.240
And uh,

29
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.270
evidently it's by this Guy John Paul Getty and John Paul Getty evidently was a

30
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:45.350
really rich guy and like a lot of rich guys.
Uh,
he didn't pay any taxes.

31
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:48.410
Evidently he went out,
he bought a bunch of art.

32
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.230
John Paul Getty,
let's see.

33
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.590
Didn't pay the taxes.

34
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.630
Let's see if this comes up with anything.
Uh,

35
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.850
the reason why J and j Paul Getty refuse to pay 16 or the billionaire refuse to

36
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:08.780
pay kidnappers.
All those kids kidnappers the tragedy of the Gettys on,

37
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:13.490
I feel bad.
What happened?
Severed ears.
What happened?

38
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.710
Safari can open this page.
Is it still an active case?

39
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.110
<v 1>To a billionaire who refused to pay kidnappers to save as grandson's life?</v>

41
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.920
<v 0>What?</v>

42
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.680
<v 1>Oh man,
that would a cold bastard,
the upcoming film,
all the money in the world.</v>

43
00:02:32.681 --> 00:02:36.190
When the fuck did this come out.
Oh,
it's a film.

44
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.000
That doesn't mean anything that'd be do is based on a true story and then

45
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:41.770
everything else is going to be bullshit,
right?

46
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.640
It's like that movie hidden figures.

47
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.260
They start like taking real people and then they combine them together and they

48
00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:54.220
amalgam like take three people and they combined them into one person and then

49
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:56.950
people start coming up to you.
When they start quoting movies like that,

50
00:02:56.951 --> 00:03:00.020
like they read a fucking history book.
It's like,
no,
you went to the movies,

51
00:03:00.021 --> 00:03:04.700
you ate gummy bears and popcorn.
That's not reading.

52
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.080
This is coming from someone who doesn't read.
Oh,

53
00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:14.081
Kevin Spacey played fucking a fucking j Paul Getty,

54
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.723
the upcoming,

55
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.730
all the money in the world has been garnered and gardening a lots of buzz for

56
00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:25.910
the scandal around it a month ago.
The filmmakers to Jesus Christ,

57
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.050
not that scan.
I want to hear about the fucking kids life.
All right.

58
00:03:30.051 --> 00:03:35.051
But the scandal and propose based on a 1973 John Paul Getty,

59
00:03:35.361 --> 00:03:39.090
the third,
the 16,
the 16 year old grandson of the oil men,

60
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.850
Jay Paul Getty then said to be the world's richest man,
where some 1.2 billion,

61
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.820
which is around 9.1 billion today,
was kidnapped in Rome,
is it?

62
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:53.600
Ductors demanded 17 million bucks with this guy probably had in his breast coat

63
00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:56.060
pocket.
Although rich people never walk around with Dick,
you know,

64
00:03:56.061 --> 00:03:58.620
they never have,
they never fucking have it.
Um,

65
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.700
which is family wouldn't pay leading to his captors to cut off his right ear.

66
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.370
The ordeal coupled with terrible neglect,

67
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:12.930
ruined the boy's life at just 24 he ended up paralyzed,

68
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.040
has as a result of a drug overdose.
As it turns out,

69
00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:18.840
all the money in the world could not save him.

70
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.020
<v 0>Okay.</v>

71
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.660
<v 1>Wow.
I wonder what he was probably thinking,
well,
if I pay this guy,</v>

72
00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:24.830
I'm going to have to pay everybody.

73
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.730
<v 0>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.020
<v 1>I'm not given yet.
Shabbit Chade Melea and you realize how many Derrek Saca bye</v>

75
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.250
yelling at his daughter.
Well,
fuck yeah.

76
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.590
Christ.
They're afraid.

77
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.150
That's one of the few things in life,
that story,
make it a baby.

78
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.600
Making a baby is free.
You know,

79
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.680
provided you can find a woman that doesn't need to go on a date and have a

80
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:57.010
relationship first.
Um,
other than that,

81
00:04:57.011 --> 00:05:00.550
it's probably one of the more expensive thing she'd do.
Um,
how are you everybody?

82
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:03.460
This is the Monday morning podcast.
It's a little bit late.
Um,

83
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.530
cause I was out celebrating mother's Day.

84
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:09.280
I realized for the 9000000th time of my life,
I am not a museum guy.

85
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.010
Um,
unless it's like a museum of cars,
drums.

86
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:20.011
I would literally enjoy seeing a museum of refrigerators that started with ice

87
00:05:20.971 --> 00:05:23.770
boxes,
you know,
and they just,
you know,
wow.

88
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:28.460
Racking on 18 fucking teams that first or ice cars bought icebox found her fate.

89
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.730
God's your fucking IC bark.
You love cops.

90
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.830
Get your rights here.
Right?
Watch one of those things.

91
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.120
I went to the Harley Davidson Museum.
I obviously enjoyed that,
you know,

92
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:44.620
but I'm not a headphones guy.
You know,
you get to the fucking museum.

93
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.090
I'm going to tell you guys what kind of Guy I am by telling you all the guys I'm

94
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:53.320
not,
and then you can do process of elimination.
Okay.

95
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.120
What you've learned on this fucking podcast already.
I'm at a museum guy.

96
00:05:58.121 --> 00:06:00.940
I'm not a headphones guy and a few podcasts back.

97
00:06:00.941 --> 00:06:03.890
I told you I was at breath breakfast guy.
All right.

98
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.230
I'm the kind of guy that tells you what kind of guy he is and he isn't whether

99
00:06:08.231 --> 00:06:09.160
you asked or not.

100
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.330
And I'll go on and on and on and on and on and you won't even get to speak.

101
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.810
I just got a guy a am.
Um,

102
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.160
I don't like going to museums and you get that little fucking recorder and then

103
00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:22.510
you have like the headphones and shit.

104
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.970
You got to walk around and look at every God damn exhibit.

105
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.510
I just kind of blow through it and get a gist.
And if anything catches my eye,

106
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.840
I'm fine with it.
You know,

107
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.910
I don't need to look at every God damn knickknack and see what like a broach

108
00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:39.400
look like in the Middle Ages.
Um,

109
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.630
so I went to the j Paul Getty Phila

110
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.940
um,
and I imagine 17 million probably put that pool in,

111
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.620
so all then a lot of people would give their ear for that.
So maybe he was right.

112
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:58.270
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.
Anyways.
Um,

113
00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.920
<v 2>okay.</v>

114
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.320
<v 1>That's what I would do if my parents were that fucking rich.</v>

115
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.070
My parents were that God damn rich,
I would,

116
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.110
I would die of a drug overdose or something my to go out and get a job.

117
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.670
You know what sucks is when you're that level rich,

118
00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:17.260
they can always hang it over your head.

119
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

120
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.390
<v 1>So I would probably rebelled and just go my own way.</v>

121
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.540
Be One of those fucking morons,
you know?

122
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.840
<v 2>Okay.</v>

123
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.580
<v 1>Stead of having a fucking chumps wherever you hoop,</v>

124
00:07:30.581 --> 00:07:34.340
all of a sudden you gotta take fencing classes and all that shit that makes you

125
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.830
a gentleman.
Um,

126
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.840
learn how to sail

127
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.330
in all that rich white shit that if you're in a fucking will,

128
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.990
you know what I mean?
First of all,
someone that has that,

129
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.660
that amount of money for the most part,
you know,
as far as the movies,

130
00:07:55.661 --> 00:07:58.420
tell me when I sit to written,
you know,
I don't eat gummy bears.

131
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.000
I always go with the fucking peanut M and.
M's.

132
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.550
You can't get the ones that don't have peanuts in them.

133
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.050
When you get the plain m and,
m's,

134
00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:08.260
if you actually eat a movie size bag of one of those,

135
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.640
you are so full of sugar.
Like you start having like disturbing thoughts.

136
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.930
You got to get the peanut M and.
M's.
I think oral,
get the chocolate covered,

137
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.030
covered almonds.
Hey,

138
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.810
I'm a fucking peanut m and M guy.
I'm not a plain Eminem.

139
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.270
What did I start saying?
What kind of Guy I am?
This is some middle aged shit.

140
00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:32.590
You realize that when you start talking about that shit,
you know,

141
00:08:32.591 --> 00:08:33.700
trying to carve out,
you know,

142
00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:37.420
hoping somebody someday it's gonna make a statue of you.
It ain't happening.

143
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.230
Do you realize how many people you have to kill and oppressed in order to get a

144
00:08:41.231 --> 00:08:44.950
statue made out of you?
You know,
if you don't have an athletic ability,

145
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.900
but even then you got to crush a lot of homers dunk.
A lot of balls score,

146
00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:53.710
a lot of goals throw for a bunch of touchdowns is you've got to do a lot of shit

147
00:08:53.711 --> 00:08:57.320
to get a statue.
Everything's lot.
So if you're in power,

148
00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.920
you have to press a lot of people,
you have to kill a lot of people,
you know,

149
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:05.660
or maybe died tragically.
It's not worth it.
You know what I mean?

150
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.380
Even if feel like fucking one of those athletes that gets,

151
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.450
gets a statute because then what happens,
you know,

152
00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:15.320
you miss your kids growing up while you were out there and fucking,
you know,

153
00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:18.520
getting you Gordie Howe had tricks.
What were the,
what were they doing it?
Huh?

154
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.490
There you were out there getting kidnapped,
getting there.
He has chopped off.
So,

155
00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:26.160
you know,
I guess,
I guess what I'm trying to say,

156
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:30.840
is this a price that everybody pays?
Um,
yeah.

157
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:33.000
So I went to that museum and um,

158
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.830
the only thing I liked,
they had giant ball of playdough.

159
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:42.150
Then for some reason took somebody 20 years to put together
an,

160
00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:46.350
I can't imagine how much still their significant other much the complaint.

161
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.860
You know,
I was a guy,

162
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:53.210
I don't know if my wife just started doing that with the play dough after a

163
00:09:53.211 --> 00:09:57.010
while I go guy.
I like it keeps her happy.
Yeah.

164
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.050
I was going to say she's out of my hair,
but I don't have any.
Um,

165
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.461
other than that,
I don't know.

166
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:07.410
It's just a bunch of fucking weird looking statutes.

167
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:12.270
Nobody looked happy back in the day.
You know,
everybody's just fucking grumpy as,

168
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:15.930
because most people died by the time they were like 20,
like,

169
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:18.310
<v 2>yeah.</v>

170
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.310
<v 1>You're like now like people have a problem contemplating their own mortality</v>

171
00:10:21.311 --> 00:10:24.130
cause you can,
you know,
even if you're a moron,
you,

172
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.060
you can pretty much live a good 70 years so you don't have to think about it for

173
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.680
awhile.
You can stand there on your smart phone.

174
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.130
Right.
Did you take a picture of the menu and then text,

175
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.880
what should I get to your fucking boyfriend and your girlfriend?

176
00:10:39.881 --> 00:10:43.150
Whatever your deal is,
but deck.
Then you know,
people like,

177
00:10:43.151 --> 00:10:47.650
he got a fever and you just died.
You know,
you fell off something,

178
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.460
you know,
your leg turned fucking black.
He just teaches,

179
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.990
fucking people died back then.
You know,

180
00:10:55.991 --> 00:10:59.750
they didn't just keep going the way we do.
Once you fucking,
you know,

181
00:10:59.751 --> 00:11:03.400
if anything happened to you back then,
you've just fucking died.

182
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.470
Mothers given birth,
died,

183
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.370
babies died two for one right there.
You know,

184
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.550
it really is amazing.
You got to,

185
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.030
you can really have to appreciate the level of fucking that has been done

186
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:21.730
globally for us to get to this level.
I guess maybe it's science,

187
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:26.420
you know,
coming up with aspirin and shit like that.
Um,

188
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:31.180
you know,
this is even dumped for me.
I'm really stepping outside of myself.

189
00:11:31.181 --> 00:11:35.290
Listen to this.
Here's a funny story for you.
Real quickie.
All right.

190
00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:36.850
Last night I went down to the comedy store.

191
00:11:36.851 --> 00:11:41.350
They had the memorial ceremony for a Mitzi shore.
Uh,

192
00:11:41.351 --> 00:11:44.260
the woman who created,
started the,
uh,

193
00:11:44.261 --> 00:11:47.650
the comedy store and ran it for decades.

194
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.780
And basically because of what she did,

195
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:54.400
I got to see all of these comedians that I watched that um,

196
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:56.160
<v 0>yeah,</v>

197
00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:01.160
<v 1>made me want to be a comedian was because that she started the place and looked</v>

198
00:12:01.171 --> 00:12:04.920
out for him and all of that stuff.
So I had to go down there,
you know,

199
00:12:04.921 --> 00:12:08.940
even though I only met her twice,
one time I didn't really even meet her.

200
00:12:08.941 --> 00:12:12.690
I was auditioning for and they will like to submit,

201
00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:16.630
she show and she barely looked at me and I went up on stage and I don't even

202
00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:21.540
know how much time I did,
but she was gone by the time I got off.
And her,

203
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.990
um,
review was a,
he has in ready,

204
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:28.800
<v 2>yes.</v>

205
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.460
<v 1>[inaudible] me off.
She was right.
I wasn't ready.
Um,</v>

206
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.620
and then years later I got in.

207
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

208
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.210
<v 1>And I talked to her briefly,
so,
you know,
I didn't want to go up.</v>

209
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

210
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.051
<v 1>You know,</v>

211
00:12:42.051 --> 00:12:45.080
I hate when people go up on a memorial service and talk when they didn't fucking

212
00:12:45.081 --> 00:12:49.640
know the person.
So,
uh,
unfortunately I didn't get to know her.
Um,

213
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.760
but I definitely more than profited off of all the work that she did and all the

214
00:12:55.911 --> 00:13:00.590
comics before,
so thank you to all of them.
So anyway,
so I'm down there and,

215
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.433
uh,

216
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:02.700
<v 0>okay.</v>

217
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.460
<v 1>You don't get to watch all these people talk and tell him these hilarious</v>

218
00:13:05.461 --> 00:13:09.240
stories about Mitzi and the comedy store back in the day.

219
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.550
And a,
this person comes up to me
and goes,
hey,
you know,

220
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.490
I guess like an audience member or something was,
I was at,
you know,

221
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.820
comedy groupie assumption was gone.
A,
I was in fucking,
uh,

222
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.840
I was at your show the other night.
Well,
you tried out a bunch of new stuff.

223
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.140
I said,
I,
you know,
a few things here or there when new,
but you know,

224
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.710
for the most part,
you know,
it's the proven stuff.
And she goes,

225
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:36.390
what about that me to stuff?
And I said,
uh,
I know I've had that sense,
you know,

226
00:13:36.391 --> 00:13:38.820
shit started going down and she goes,

227
00:13:38.821 --> 00:13:43.260
would you like to hear my opinions of that material as a woman,
as a female?

228
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.070
She goes,
would you like to hear my opinions on that material as a female?

229
00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:48.210
And I just go,
no.

230
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.600
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

231
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.680
<v 1>I walked away.</v>

232
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.530
I just love that.
Would you like to hear my opinions as a female?

233
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:01.750
What does that mean?
As a female,
you are a female.

234
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.920
Could you give me your opinions as a Hermaphrodite?
Do you know,

235
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.990
how would you do that?
Um,
I have no idea.

236
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:15.130
I don't,
I,
and I,
I'm just,
I'm sure that person is a nice person.

237
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.900
I didn't take offense to it,

238
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:19.720
but it was one of the easiest questions I've ever had to answer.

239
00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:24.160
And I just walked away.
And to her credit,
she laughed and I just walked away.
But,

240
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:27.520
um,
I think that's just a symptom of,
you know,

241
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.670
just the Internet.
Now you can comment on fucking youtube videos.

242
00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:38.540
You can comment on fucking,
uh,
you know,

243
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.500
fucking spew every thought.
You have a fucking Abbott on podcasts.

244
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.410
I'm literally talking to myself,
so maybe that's what the fuck it is.

245
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:46.300
But I've never in my life,

246
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.690
I've never had a conversation like that was fucking bizarre.
Oh yeah.

247
00:14:51.691 --> 00:14:54.090
By all means.
Why don't you,
you punch up my shit.

248
00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:01.110
That's what I was waiting for.
A complete stranger to help me out with my act.

249
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.300
Could I have a complete strangers set of eyes on this shit?
And by the way,

250
00:15:06.301 --> 00:15:10.230
the material,
I did it fucking killed it.
Fucking killed that night.

251
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.740
Let me get your opinion as you didn't like it.
Oh,
maybe that's why I'm doing it.

252
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:17.320
<v 0>Okay.</v>

253
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.490
<v 1>Do you have a notice?
Some kind of an asshole?
Um,
anyways,</v>

254
00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:22.390
plowing ahead.

255
00:15:22.391 --> 00:15:27.160
Did anybody watched the f one race over there and fucking a in Spain place?

256
00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:28.330
I would love to go someday.

257
00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.173
<v 0>MMM.</v>

258
00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:35.440
<v 1>What an exciting race.
They got to do something,
man.</v>

259
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.460
They got to do something to these cars where there's some sort of passing in the

260
00:15:39.461 --> 00:15:41.670
front row.
It's like Lewis Hamilton just fucking,

261
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.820
he just,
he just got to the corner first he was in pole position and then that,

262
00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:48.431
that was it.

263
00:15:48.431 --> 00:15:52.630
The one exciting thing was Ferrari pit it early and they went to the medium

264
00:15:52.631 --> 00:15:55.810
tires,
you know,
you know,
I remember that.
The one,

265
00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.580
the ones with the white lettering,
I'm medium.

266
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.480
It's cause they always say white guys are boring,
average,
whatever,
you know,

267
00:16:01.481 --> 00:16:05.170
that's how I remember those.
And then I always forget like yellow soft,

268
00:16:05.171 --> 00:16:07.690
it's super soft.
It's a pink right.

269
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.440
And I'm not going to get to the metaphor about debt,
but anyways,
um,

270
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.630
the only exciting thing was when,
uh,

271
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.290
Sebastian Vettel pitted early and changed his tires and it was just like,

272
00:16:17.291 --> 00:16:18.940
is he going to be able to catch them in that?

273
00:16:18.941 --> 00:16:22.780
And that was answered pretty fucking quickly with a resounding no.

274
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:28.710
And I'm somehow Lewis Hamilton absents such a shitty fucking start is fucking a,

275
00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:33.520
he's back in first place again.
And I don't know why it bugs me.

276
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:35.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

277
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.740
<v 1>That was just because years ago I remember when like,
you know,</v>

278
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.850
he was asking his teammate to fucking help him out.
This is when he had the,
uh,

279
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.740
the,
the,
the fucking days of thunder,

280
00:16:43.741 --> 00:16:46.020
Ricky Bobby Shit going on with that fucking guy.

281
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.990
What the fuck was his name back in the take?
Nico Rosberg they didn't get along.

282
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:53.730
<v 0>Okay.</v>

283
00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:57.480
<v 1>So Nico was being a teammate for him,
a few races earlier.</v>

284
00:16:57.481 --> 00:17:02.430
And then when it was flipped and Nico was winning the race and they needed Lewis

285
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:03.780
Hamilton to do something,
you know,

286
00:17:03.781 --> 00:17:06.990
basically do the same thing that Nico did for him.
He fucking refuse,

287
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:12.000
which is not what you're supposed to do.
You know,
he went Koby Bryant on it.

288
00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:17.220
I want the ball.
Um,
and ever since then I was like,
ah,
fuck it.
Fuck this guy.

289
00:17:17.221 --> 00:17:20.790
I don't like this guy with this red private jet.
All right.
I'm stalking them.

290
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.630
I don't like literally not like the guy,
but that was just one of those things.

291
00:17:24.631 --> 00:17:25.464
It's just like,

292
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.830
<v 0>okay.</v>

293
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.530
<v 1>You know,
I don't know.
Um,
so anyways,</v>

294
00:17:29.531 --> 00:17:32.440
so I have somehow being German and Irish guy,

295
00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:35.800
I should be rooting for the fucking Mercedes team.
Right.
I'm mostly chairman.

296
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.173
<v 0>MMM.</v>

297
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.740
<v 1>But,
uh,
for some reason I'm rooting for Ferrari.
Maybe cause it's just every time,</v>

298
00:17:42.741 --> 00:17:43.461
every fucking year.

299
00:17:43.461 --> 00:17:47.060
It's like Mercedes wins the two years that I've been watching it.
I think that's,

300
00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:47.894
that's what it is.

301
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.793
<v 2>Yeah.
I Dunno.</v>

302
00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:51.980
<v 1>Louis,</v>

303
00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:56.980
would you like to hear my opinions of your driving as a male who doesn't drive

304
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.090
competitively?
Um,
so anyways,

305
00:18:02.091 --> 00:18:03.890
I'm up here in San Francisco.

306
00:18:03.891 --> 00:18:08.660
That's why I had an early flight today and that's why the podcast is a very late

307
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.360
today.
Um,
slow up here.
It was funny.

308
00:18:11.361 --> 00:18:15.860
I check the weather in San Francisco and right before the window opened I said

309
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.860
gloomy and shitty and that's exactly what it is.

310
00:18:18.861 --> 00:18:23.120
Although the sun's coming out right now.
This,
this,
everybody talks about Seattle,

311
00:18:23.121 --> 00:18:26.050
how it rains and his fucking gloomy and all that to,
I don't know,

312
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.640
I have had more sunny days on shows in fucking Seattle

313
00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.420
in Portland combined than I have the,

314
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:41.040
every time I've come here it's just always just sort of a,

315
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.790
you know,
you always have to have a jacket.

316
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.380
I can't like if I ever started a store here in San Francisco,

317
00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:52.680
I wouldn't try to fuck with the burritos cause everybody's got that locked down.

318
00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:55.860
But I would definitely have some sort of jacket and hat store.

319
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.460
It's just fucking miserable here.
And I'm staying at this hotel.

320
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:03.540
I'm doing one show a night,
7:00 PM shows.
I love it.
I'm an old guy.

321
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:08.310
I love the 7:00 PM one show done at nine o'clock.
I come home,

322
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:13.020
I get in the bed,
I fucking relax.
You know,
I do my resent a stone,

323
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.180
a little bit of French,
you know,
not hurting anybody,
just an old bald white guy.

324
00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:21.810
Right.
Um,
but anyways,
you know,

325
00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:26.010
I wanted to do my big birthdays coming up 50 turning 50 June 10th Beck's fucking

326
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:27.420
months.
So I wanted to uh,

327
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.680
drop the last couple of pounds and I went downstairs and they got this Shitty

328
00:19:31.681 --> 00:19:35.700
fucking gym.
It's the worst.

329
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.680
Do you have a chance?
Yeah,
we have the chip now.
He had,

330
00:19:38.681 --> 00:19:41.880
don't did JIM is smaller than my Roman.

331
00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:46.230
I have a basic fucking room with two queen beds that,
Oh,

332
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.920
maybe the gym is the same.
So I think they just took a Roman,
they just,
they got,

333
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:54.930
they got one,
that thing where you sit down and pretend you're riding a bicycle,

334
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.680
which nobody gets on that.
Right.
Uh,

335
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.860
people who wear makeup and read US magazine while they work out,

336
00:20:01.861 --> 00:20:04.590
get on that fucking thing.
Then they got an elliptical great.

337
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.580
But they only got one and right next to it is a treadmill and right next to that

338
00:20:08.581 --> 00:20:11.880
as a treadmill.
And then you're at the wall.
They got a couple of kettle bells.

339
00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:15.930
They've got some dumbbells,
they got no bench,
you know,

340
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.690
so I guess you just deal with shoulders and curls.
Uh,
you know,
I don't know what.

341
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.850
And uh,
they got a couple of dirty bands down there.
Those elastic pants.

342
00:20:25.851 --> 00:20:29.160
Well fortunately I brought some shit with me,
but um,

343
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.553
<v 2>I dunno,</v>

344
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.930
<v 1>I could start making demands here.
If I'm going to be in a hotel,</v>

345
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.110
the gym has to be bigger than my hotel room.

346
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.130
Can there be more than one?
Cause you know what's going to happen.
Yeah,

347
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:49.690
you're going to go down there and it's just to be fucking,
you know,

348
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:51.160
you get down there in the morning,

349
00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.690
it's just going to be those gym rats down there just fucking all over those

350
00:20:55.691 --> 00:20:58.420
things.
Sweating and shit.
It's going to be gross.

351
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.780
But fortunately it's San Francisco,
so I'm just going to walk the hills.

352
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:02.710
I think that's what I'll do.

353
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:07.330
Um Oh and how bout those Celtics?

354
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.260
I taped the game,
I didn't see one second of it.

355
00:21:11.261 --> 00:21:14.470
I was over at the j Paul Getty Pavilion,

356
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.280
whatever the fuck I was the um,

357
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.553
<v 0>the villa,</v>

358
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:25.160
<v 1>which uh,
I you actually,
when I fly,
well I do solo flights.</v>

359
00:21:25.161 --> 00:21:30.161
I fly out of Burbank a lot and I go all the way out past a Camarillo.

360
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:35.060
I always call Kamma Rio cause it rich came a real punch up for the Patriots and

361
00:21:35.061 --> 00:21:38.690
then it come down the coast all the way down Malibu raise,

362
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.190
you get to the Pacific Palisades,

363
00:21:40.191 --> 00:21:44.590
she get on with the Santa Monica airport and you see at the,

364
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.610
at the Getty villa,
Pella Copter,
whatever,
whatever,
whatever.

365
00:21:47.611 --> 00:21:51.740
I'm Santa Monica Tower,
helicopter,
whatever,
whatever,
uh,

366
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.550
south bottle on the coast at the uh,

367
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:59.770
Getty villa questing fucking eastbound transition.

368
00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:03.050
So your fucking airspace.
Um,
sorry,
I'm out of it.

369
00:22:03.051 --> 00:22:05.930
This is why I never do podcasts when I fly.
I don't know what the hell happens.

370
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.823
Um,

371
00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:11.750
I flew southwest and there was no fucking stand up on the flight.
It was great.

372
00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:16.440
No bad stand up on the flight
and a cruise right up here.

373
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:21.410
Great flight.
And all that.
And um,
I,
anyway,
so yesterday I was at the fucking,

374
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:27.230
the Getty a filler and a that's when the Celtics game was on.

375
00:22:27.231 --> 00:22:29.690
I missed the whole fucking game.
And uh,

376
00:22:29.691 --> 00:22:32.690
I don't know how we did it but we beat them and we won by 20 points,

377
00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:33.891
which is amazing.

378
00:22:33.891 --> 00:22:37.520
But I'm thinking that might have been like a fucking hangover game because uh,

379
00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.460
no.
Yeah they will do what they were idle.
That's right.

380
00:22:40.461 --> 00:22:42.440
Cause they swept a Toronto.

381
00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.280
So game too is fucking huge.

382
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.580
Game Two,
I actually think if we win game two,

383
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.320
having watched three Celtics games this year,
if we win game two,
we,

384
00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.840
I think actually I think game two is a must win.

385
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.003
<v 0>MMM.</v>

386
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.750
<v 1>Because uh,</v>

387
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.040
<v 0>okay</v>

388
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.670
<v 1>cause they got Lebron James,
Lebron James,</v>

389
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.050
one of the biggest enigmas I've ever,

390
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:15.780
as far as like what that guy is done versus the level of shit that he gets.

391
00:23:15.781 --> 00:23:20.260
I just,
I don't understand it.
Yeah.
Is,

392
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.500
are people ever going to fib,

393
00:23:21.501 --> 00:23:25.250
forgive that guy for taking his talents down to south beach.
All right.

394
00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:29.270
So he went down there.
He was part of a couple of pile on fucking teams,

395
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.790
but then he went back to Cleveland at one,

396
00:23:31.791 --> 00:23:36.470
them their first fucking championships since fucking Jim Brown in 1965.

397
00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.780
That should have been the end of the movie.

398
00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.270
The man redeem himself that I've never seen a guy,

399
00:23:41.271 --> 00:23:45.620
no matter what the fuck he does,
people find a reason to shit over.

400
00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.480
Um,

401
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.480
and what kills me is meanwhile Coby Bryant demanded free agents every fucking

402
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:57.810
year for shack out of town,
cost them a fucking championship.

403
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:02.550
Cause Shaq was still in his prime.
He went to Miami,
they went there.
Um,

404
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.050
never gets any shit.

405
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.110
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

406
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.690
<v 1>Or doesn't get nearly as much shit.
I don't,
I,
for the life of me,</v>

407
00:24:08.691 --> 00:24:11.610
I don't understand why Lebron James get so much shit.
Um,

408
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.040
he's literally willingness team into the,
into the conference finals.
Um,

409
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:21.380
so whatever other people don't understand that guy.
I get,

410
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.070
I get who that fucking dude is.
And a,
I think if we don't win game two,

411
00:24:25.071 --> 00:24:28.580
we have no shot at went in this series.
And even if we do win game two,

412
00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:30.020
because of Lebron James,

413
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.000
<v 2>um,
I dunno,</v>

414
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.360
<v 1>I got 200 bucks on this series stuff.
Somebody talked me into it.
I was like,
dude,</v>

415
00:24:39.361 --> 00:24:42.060
I ain't got a fucking bag.
If we went to games,
I want to be thrilled.

416
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.060
We got to the Eastern Conference finals,
you know,

417
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.210
without Rick Robbie and Eric Bernstein,

418
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.640
who's that guy that we got from the Cavaliers who's up?

419
00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:52.560
I already don't remember his name.

420
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.360
The other guy that Mel Howard that we got from fucking Utah.

421
00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:01.980
I missed every Celtic game this year.
Just about,
except for like maybe two.
Um,

422
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.700
I know Jaylen Brown and a rosier and Tatum have been the story a Kyrie Irving.

423
00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.283
There we go.

424
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.183
<v 2>MMM.</v>

425
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:13.940
<v 1>I think next year we're going to look pretty good.</v>

426
00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:17.870
Be Great to get another championship before the Lakers rebuild.

427
00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.150
Uh,
I dunno.
We'll see.
We'll see what the fuck happens.

428
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.410
But I should probably,

429
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:27.110
you know what's great though is the fact that I have early shows,

430
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.990
I think I can actually,
uh,

431
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.720
catch a lot of the games this week.

432
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.660
Maybe get back into its fucking lyrics and watching the Celtics for the last two

433
00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:37.940
years and now they're like,
[inaudible],
well,

434
00:25:37.941 --> 00:25:39.590
I can't say a legit shot to be killed.

435
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.440
You know that I didn't know what the fuck I'm talking about this week.

436
00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:46.790
Why don't I just do a little bit of a advertising here?
How about that?

437
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.720
I went old school,
by the way,
I brought all my shit up here,

438
00:25:50.721 --> 00:25:53.630
but all my podcasts and stuff up here is something I haven't done in a while and

439
00:25:53.631 --> 00:25:55.640
he would think if I were to bring all my equipment up here,

440
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:59.940
I'd actually have a decent podcasts,
but I haven't.

441
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.430
Alright.
Simply stay for everybody.

442
00:26:02.431 --> 00:26:06.720
It's important to protect your home with a home security system.

443
00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.930
How can we protect your home and your privacy?

444
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.050
That's what I love about simply safe.

445
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:18.720
They obsess over details like no other home security company.
Here's an example.

446
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.960
Simply save as a camera.
You can control from your phone.
You know what I,

447
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.941
in the future,

448
00:26:23.941 --> 00:26:26.670
they're going to have something that tells you if somebody's coming up,

449
00:26:26.671 --> 00:26:28.770
your walk is a person or a robot.

450
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.330
<v 2>Okay?</v>

451
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.330
<v 1>That's what I'm guessing.
But they want to protect your home and your privacy.</v>

452
00:26:33.331 --> 00:26:37.860
So they came up with this brilliant idea,
a privacy shutter for the camera.

453
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:43.950
Now simply safe.
What?
I don't even know what just happened there.

454
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:47.980
An example,
it simply safe,
has a camera you control,
can control from your phone,

455
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.110
but they want to protect your home and your privacy.

456
00:26:50.111 --> 00:26:53.950
So they came up with this brilliant idea,
a privacy shutter for the camera.

457
00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:58.610
I don't understand how,
what,
what,

458
00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.880
what is your face looking out of the camera and the and the guy breaking in

459
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:08.050
concede or are you worried about somebody on the bus looking over your shoulder

460
00:27:08.051 --> 00:27:11.290
and seeing where you live going?
Oh,
I know I recognize that shrub.

461
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.030
I don't get,
what do I don't know when it's going on right now.

462
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:19.570
Now simply safe wanted you to be able to hear the shutter.
Click.
See,

463
00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:22.370
you know it's closed.
They wanted to have it.

464
00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.670
Have a light on it so you could easily tell when it's on.

465
00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.080
And they needed it to work for the entire lifespan of the system.
So simply safe.

466
00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:34.550
Got To work.
Testing different metals and hinge designs for months and months.

467
00:27:34.551 --> 00:27:38.600
The result in effective home security camera with a thin,

468
00:27:38.601 --> 00:27:43.030
lightweight aluminum privacy shutter
that will work every time.

469
00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.880
I don't understand what they're protecting your phone.
What's the privacy?

470
00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:50.500
Is that kind of attention to detail that said simply safe apart and keeps your

471
00:27:50.501 --> 00:27:51.940
family safe?
I don't know what they did,

472
00:27:51.941 --> 00:27:53.470
but it seems like they work real hard on it.

473
00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.910
Simply safe isn't just a home security.
It's home security.
Done right.

474
00:27:57.911 --> 00:28:01.730
Checkout simply safe.

482
00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.850
Go out to the cafeteria and order some rice.

483

It tastes like shit in it's 100 bucks cause you're eating at a fucking museum

484
00:28:38.831 --> 00:28:43.480
with a bunch of snotty kids.
Um,
I don't like little boys by the way.

485
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.020
Now that I have a daughter,
if they're always fucking jumping around,

486
00:28:47.021 --> 00:28:51.580
making all kinds of noise and fucking bumping into kids,
I really don't like him.

487
00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:55.180
The amount of times I've fantasized about punting one of those little bastards

488
00:28:55.181 --> 00:28:57.700
across the fucking room.
You know,

489
00:28:57.701 --> 00:29:00.700
I had my daughter there at the museum and I just knew these fucking kids,

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.990
talking in weird voices and jump around flailing their fucking arms.

493
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:10.263
Good Lord.

494
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.080
As much as I can't stand my eyes and I realized that I was one of them.

495
00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.250
Alright me undies,

this run a dates here is my last two now before I go over there and do these,

579
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:40.470
those two huge shows,
which I'm in a good way,

580
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.030
I am nervous about.

581
00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:43.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

582
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.960
<v 1>I want to make sure that I have a good show.</v>

583
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:49.961
So I am going to be doing a bunch of shit this week and then that'll be what the

584
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:52.970
end of this week will be the 18th

585
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:54.910
<v 2>okay.</v>

586
00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:57.660
<v 1>All right.
Sounds.
So I still have a have like a two week gap.</v>

587
00:34:57.661 --> 00:35:00.890
I'm going to have to do a lot of fucking popping in,

588
00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:05.580
doing some shows to make sure I stay on my fucking game here.
Um,

589
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.930
all right.
In the eye of the beholder.
Oh fuck.
Why didn't I write that down?
Oh,

590
00:35:09.931 --> 00:35:14.850
you know what,
cause since my Bruins lost in the playoffs,

591
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:18.810
um,
I ended up,
uh,

592
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.520
some friends wanting to get together and they wanted to play that Metallica,

593
00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:26.580
Metallica song,
eye of the beholder from the off of the injustice for all album.

594
00:35:26.581 --> 00:35:29.670
I believe it's track number two.
And um,

595
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:33.090
so I've been listening to all this Metallica and uh,

596
00:35:33.091 --> 00:35:34.440
I never used to listen to them.

597
00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:35.910
<v 2>Okay.</v>

598
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:40.690
<v 1>I went the other way.
I listened to more fucking,
uh,</v>

599
00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.960
warrant.
Then I listened to Metallica.

600
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.220
I like single bass drum plane and I just like,

601
00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:53.060
it was just too raw,
too fast for my years.
I never get into it.

602
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.370
So now of course I'm going back down plus to have going,
oh my God,

603
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.210
this shit is unbelievable.
And um,

604
00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.280
I actually sat down,
I took a video of,
I'll take a video of it and I'll,

605
00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.293
I'll post it.

606
00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:09.490
I actually wrote the entire drum chart out in my own chicken scratch.

607
00:36:09.491 --> 00:36:13.030
I didn't put down the high ed or Monday may the crash symbols,
just uh,

608
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:16.300
just so I could make sense of this song.

609
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:20.140
And what I noticed about Lara's playing is he's pretty,
uh,

610
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.640
religious when it in the chorus and then,
you know,

611
00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.710
a lot of time changes obviously on that album.

612
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.440
So those drum parts are pretty repetitive,

613
00:36:29.441 --> 00:36:34.441
but in the fucking versus that guy is just like flying by the seat of his pants.

614
00:36:35.111 --> 00:36:38.950
So he has all these different little things that he does and um,

615
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:40.550
<v 0>yeah,</v>

616
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:42.590
<v 1>really,
really fun album to listen to.</v>

617
00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.910
And so I sat down and I wrote out the whole fucking drum chart for that song.

618
00:36:46.911 --> 00:36:51.620
It's like four or five pages long because I was trying to memorize it.
I'm like,

619
00:36:51.621 --> 00:36:55.090
this is going to take me for fucking ever.
Why do I know how to read drum music?

620
00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.820
So why don't I just sit down and write this shit out and I'm,

621
00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:01.820
I'm really glad that I did,
but then I have to watch out,
like,

622
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:05.540
like I get into shit.
So then all of a sudden it's like,
well,

623
00:37:05.541 --> 00:37:07.360
I'm going to write up the drum shot for shortest Straw.

624
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:10.640
I'm going to do the whole fucking album.
Um,

625
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:15.530
anything to keep me out of the bath.
I'm not going to lie to you.

626
00:37:15.531 --> 00:37:19.910
I had one drink Saturday and one drink Sunday,
small ones and uh,

627
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:21.720
<v 0>yeah,</v>

628
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:26.160
<v 1>very small.
It's,
and now I'm back on the wagon again.
So,
uh,</v>

629
00:37:26.161 --> 00:37:28.310
that's how I'd like to drink.
I,

630
00:37:28.311 --> 00:37:31.140
I'd like to really think about drinking now before I do it,

631
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.160
which is what I think about is the next morning and how awesome I have felt not

632
00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:40.860
drinking.
So,
uh,
I had a very,
very,

633
00:37:40.861 --> 00:37:45.270
very fucking incredible Tequila and,
uh,

634
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:49.170
it wasn't even a finger,
like as far as how much I poured,
maybe it was a finger.

635
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.300
Um,
and I just sip it.
It was nice.

636
00:37:55.230 --> 00:38:00.210
I really enjoyed it.
Didn't even have ice on it.
Not that,
just really nice.

637
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:01.830
And then that was it.
And then I was done.

638
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.290
And then I had a water right next to it and I go at one,

639
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.700
if I go to the water that that fucking makes me not go like,
oh,

640
00:38:08.701 --> 00:38:10.680
I'm going to have a fucking bunch of these.
Um,

641
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.710
so anyways,
I think I'm going to,
uh,
the goal anyways.

642
00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:19.860
It's just kind of chill this week.
And,
um,

643
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:22.363
you know,

644
00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.880
I've been talking to a couple of my buddies who've just been starting to slow

645
00:38:25.881 --> 00:38:29.060
down a little bit with the drink it and it's just more like,

646
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:34.270
I don't know how you look at it,
you know,

647
00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:39.300
cause I not by any means a young man anymore and that shit will fucking age you

648
00:38:39.971 --> 00:38:43.210
and kick the shit out of you.
And,
uh,
life is hard enough.

649
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:48.310
I don't need to be adding that,
you know.
So anyways,
speaking of which,

650
00:38:48.311 --> 00:38:51.220
I found a healthy place to my hotel and I just walked down there,

651
00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:57.160
got that stuff and all that Shit,
you know?
So I guess I got it.
I got it.

652
00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.010
It's time to pass the baton.
Okay.

653
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:04.210
Partying is a young man's fucking game and,
uh,

654
00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.990
I'm done with it
there.
I said it,

655
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:12.910
I want to be done with it.
I should say every once in a while though,

656
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:13.960
every once in a while,
you know,

657
00:39:13.961 --> 00:39:18.490
I go to that one big college football game a year.
I go to the Rose Bowl and uh,

658
00:39:18.491 --> 00:39:22.640
you know,
whatever.
Maybe three,
four times a year.
But other than that,
I,

659
00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:26.970
I'm fucking done with this shit.
I'm okay.
I hope anyways.
All right.

660
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.730
Ex Wife pretended to be my parole officer.

661
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:36.820
Um,
okay.
Uh,
a Billy blue balls.

662
00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:41.890
I wish making this story.
I wish I was making this story up,
but I am not.
Well,

663
00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:45.460
how would she pretend to be your parole officer without you knowing she must

664
00:39:45.461 --> 00:39:49.450
have done it to somebody else somehow.
She must've fucked you over.
Anyways,

665
00:39:49.451 --> 00:39:53.380
I'm in my early forties and had been married for 12 years.
Unfortunately,

666
00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.960
the marriage ended in a divorce last year,

667
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.810
but when she found out you were in the mob,
I have fought.

668
00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:03.310
You're married for 12 years.
It's guys like a responsible fucking dude.

669
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:07.290
He ends up going to jail even though we had no children.

670
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:11.800
My wife got to keep the house in the divorce settlement.
Of course she did.

671
00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.590
Of course she did.
But they're always victims.

672
00:40:14.591 --> 00:40:18.240
And the guys always the fucking asshole.
Um,

673
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.470
divorces and alimony are expensive.

674
00:40:20.471 --> 00:40:25.090
So for the past year I had been renting a townhouse.
Well Dude,
you're doing fine.

675
00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:28.270
You renting a townhouse and this little community,
uh,

676
00:40:28.271 --> 00:40:32.170
where most of the other residents are elderly couples.
Oh,
I see.
See,

677
00:40:32.171 --> 00:40:36.180
waiting for someone to die and you moved in there.
I love it.
Uh,

678
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.880
I enjoy like just don't steal their fucking social security checks.

679
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.960
I enjoy living here and even though most of the other residents are older,

680
00:40:43.961 --> 00:40:46.940
there is a nice community center that has a tennis court.
Yeah.

681
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:51.430
You fucking beaten everybody feeling like a young man and a pool and events

682
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:54.790
during the week and sometimes even live music.
So all in all,

683
00:40:54.791 --> 00:40:56.410
not too bad of a situation.

684
00:40:56.411 --> 00:41:00.250
Well about three months ago I met this great lady and we began to date,

685
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:05.760
my ex wife found out and did not take it well that I was back in the dating pool

686
00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.980
so quickly.
Yeah.
Cause why getting the how,
you know,

687
00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:10.540
she just got the fucking house.

688
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:15.790
So she went around to all my neighbors pretending to be my parole officer.

689
00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.330
Wow.
Well,
they're all witnesses.

690
00:41:19.331 --> 00:41:24.190
When are you sewer for defamation of character?
She can you do that?

691
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.870
She claimed that I am a registered sex offender and she was following up to see

692
00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:33.570
if I had gone around door to door to admit to my neighbor I was a sex.
Oh,

693
00:41:33.571 --> 00:41:35.190
you gotta sue the shit out of this woman.

694
00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:39.180
Obviously I did not do this because I am not a sex offender and so all the

695
00:41:39.181 --> 00:41:40.290
neighbors said no,

696
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:44.580
I not disclose to them my sex offender pass.

697
00:41:44.581 --> 00:41:48.390
I had no idea my ex did this until a week later I got a letter from the

698
00:41:48.391 --> 00:41:52.170
community board residence requesting that I move out for being in breach of

699
00:41:52.171 --> 00:41:56.190
state laws require me to disclose my sex offenses.
All right,
dude,

700
00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:00.810
all you need is a lawyer,
brother.
All you need is a lawyer.
This is easy.

701
00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.340
This is fucking easy.
I,

702
00:42:02.341 --> 00:42:04.920
of course went to the board and told them that they were all lies,

703
00:42:04.921 --> 00:42:08.250
but they did not believe me because I could not prove I'm not a sex offender.

704
00:42:08.251 --> 00:42:10.260
Yeah,
you can go get your fucking record.

705
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.680
I found a website and search my name and of course nothing came up,

706
00:42:13.681 --> 00:42:18.210
but they wouldn't believe me.
Plus the dude,
this is so simple.
This is so simple.

707
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:23.670
So your wife and so this fucking say you're going to sue this old fucking folks

708
00:42:23.671 --> 00:42:27.660
home if they kick you out.
Plus say said even I was telling,

709
00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.240
even if I was telling you the truth and then my ex is lying,

710
00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.880
they don't want me in my community because I hang around with people who

711
00:42:32.881 --> 00:42:36.180
wouldn't lie about such a transgression.
Okay,
well that's,

712
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:38.700
that's kind of fair on their part.
I did not want to move,

713
00:42:38.701 --> 00:42:41.160
especially because they said they did not,

714
00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:45.900
they don't have to give me any sort of refund and I'd be liable to pay the

715
00:42:45.901 --> 00:42:46.890
remainder of my lease.

716
00:42:46.891 --> 00:42:51.180
I'm not sure what my options are and to involve the legal team will only add to

717
00:42:51.181 --> 00:42:55.440
expenses.
Well,
you'll send them right back to her and I still may have to move.

718
00:42:55.441 --> 00:42:58.560
What do I do?
Thanks for listening and go fuck yourself.
Well,

719
00:42:58.561 --> 00:43:00.000
provided you're not a sex offender.

720
00:43:00.001 --> 00:43:04.170
I would get a fucking lawyer and tell the guy,
listen,
you got to fucking,

721
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:10.640
you know what do they call that working pro bono or some shit working to the sag

722
00:43:10.641 --> 00:43:13.550
minimum.
I would absolutely get a lawyer.

723
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:17.110
I would absolutely get a lawyer.
And I think you're the,
the,

724
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.710
the judge and your divorce case who handles your alimony and all that shit

725
00:43:21.711 --> 00:43:26.240
should know what this woman did.
I would press,
I would find out whatever.

726
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:27.283
Um,

727
00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:29.340
<v 2>yeah,</v>

728
00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:33.090
<v 1>whatever.
Legally you can do whatever a law she must get.</v>

729
00:43:33.091 --> 00:43:36.420
Can't be fucking legal to do that.
And then you got all that shit the day.

730
00:43:36.421 --> 00:43:39.390
Do all the emotional stress and how this fucking effected you.

731
00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:44.280
And I would sue the fucking shit out of her.
Um,

732
00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:47.190
that is all,
that's what I would do.
Absolutely.
Get a lawyer.

733
00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:51.930
Apps of Fucking Luli get a Lord Jesus fucking Christ.

734
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:58.700
Did you see this?
This is why this me too.
Shit.

735
00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:03.650
Or you've created this thing now where you don't need any proof.

736
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:08.890
You know what I'm saying?
I'm all forgetting all these bad guys,
you know,

737
00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:11.140
outdated and all that shit.

738
00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:14.770
But you can't just create a system where you take due process and you throw it

739
00:44:14.771 --> 00:44:19.480
out the fucking window.
Okay?
Because of shit like this,

740
00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.320
and I know all the hype out there right now is that women are victims and there

741
00:44:23.321 --> 00:44:25.750
are all these fucking angels.
And the truth of the matter is,

742
00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:30.640
is there's assholes in this vindictive people out there who have dicks and

743
00:44:30.641 --> 00:44:32.420
sometimes have vaginas and you can,

744
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:34.890
you just can't have people going around fucking doing stuff like this.

745
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.210
And you know,
if we're really going to go into a future where everything is fair,

746
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.370
you have to start,
you know,

747
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.010
women have to be responsible for their actions.

748
00:44:45.011 --> 00:44:49.570
You can't fucking go around and do something like that over some petty bullshit

749
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:53.920
to fucking ruin a guy's life like that.
I mean,

750
00:44:53.921 --> 00:44:56.380
do you realize like how vindictive that is?

751
00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:02.230
That is unfucking believable.
And I like,
I be honest with you,

752
00:45:02.231 --> 00:45:05.890
I would never in a million years matter how long I sat there and thought,

753
00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:07.710
<v 2>okay,</v>

754
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:11.900
<v 1>I could never come up with something as bad as that.
And,
um,</v>

755
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:13.500
<v 2>yeah,</v>

756
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.570
<v 1>I don't need to tell the guys listening to this step.</v>

757
00:45:15.571 --> 00:45:20.040
Women can effortlessly do that.
Hell hath no fury like a fucking woman scorned,

758
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:23.190
especially when they're not held fuck a response.
You know,

759
00:45:23.191 --> 00:45:25.950
I just love how women can get away with like destruction of property.

760
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:28.950
There's even a commercial on TV where this guy's going through some sort of

761
00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.340
breakup and this woman has just throwing all of his shit out the fucking window,

762
00:45:32.341 --> 00:45:34.770
computers and all that,
and it's played for comedy.

763
00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:39.400
It's fucking considered hilarious.
You know what I mean?
Which is fine.

764
00:45:39.401 --> 00:45:42.010
I can roll with that.
But you can't,
uh,
you know,

765
00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:47.740
have some overbearing guy screaming at his fucking wife played for comedy

766
00:45:47.741 --> 00:45:51.730
anymore.
I guess she used to be able to do that.
But um,
you know,

767
00:45:51.731 --> 00:45:54.520
sorry if you were actually innocent of all everything that she just did there,

768
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:58.600
I would absolutely.
You know what to,
why don't you start a startup?

769
00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

770
00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:04.610
<v 1>Started a startup to get a fucking lawyer.
You give me the link dude,
and I'll,</v>

771
00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:08.420
I'll throw 500 bucks at it.
Sue the shit out of her.

772
00:46:08.421 --> 00:46:11.670
If she fucking did this to a sue,
the fucking shit out of it.
Good luck to you.

773
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.560
All right?
And I'll tweet out the fucking Lincoln.

774
00:46:15.561 --> 00:46:17.420
Everybody just get on this thing and he,

775
00:46:17.421 --> 00:46:21.740
let's get this guy a fucking lawyer so he can get on with his goddamn life.

776
00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.470
He's not doing anything wrong according to him,
okay?

777
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.450
As long as what he's doing is telling the truth.
Other than that,

778
00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:32.330
I think I might be given $500 to a sex offender.
Kidding.

779
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:35.700
All right.
Crazy wife.
Jesus,
they ladies,
can you guys write into,

780
00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:36.860
cause I want to keep this balance.

781
00:46:36.861 --> 00:46:40.690
I don't want it to this to be a fucking sausage fest here.
All right?
Um,

782
00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:45.750
all right.
Crazy wife.
I have a wife.
I met overseas.
All right,

783
00:46:45.751 --> 00:46:48.660
well,
you know what?
That's your fucking fault.
All right?

784
00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:51.090
You know you're going to go over there and they're going to have their fucking

785
00:46:51.091 --> 00:46:53.900
wooden shoes and they're awful teeth.
I mean what,

786
00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.430
you know you're going to be over here and bring her around the buffalo wild

787
00:46:56.431 --> 00:47:00.690
wings.
What do we think's going to happen anyways?
He goes on 25 and she's 22.

788
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.800
We're not technically married since we didn't finalize the paperwork.

789
00:47:04.801 --> 00:47:08.160
Okay then what is the problem?
We just had the ceremony,

790
00:47:08.161 --> 00:47:11.490
which is the only reason this question is worth asking.

791
00:47:11.491 --> 00:47:13.800
Otherwise I just deal with it.
Okay,
fair enough.

792
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:17.700
By now it seems like the possibility of dealing with the consequences of

793
00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:21.810
dropping her is the better option.
A.
Okay.
This is already sales.

794
00:47:21.811 --> 00:47:24.890
Like you've already made your decision.
You just want me to back it up.
Uh,

795
00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:28.980
we were dating two years.
She was normal,
but since we got married she flips out,

796
00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:33.260
gets hysterical over little things to the point where I feel awkward to just be

797
00:47:33.261 --> 00:47:37.880
next to her even when we're alone.
My first guest is,
uh,

798
00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:39.860
she got married too young and she's freaking out.

799
00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:43.100
Cause I would guess most of her friends aren't married yet at 22,

800
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:47.570
I think she must be bipolar or something.
She's still overseas.

801
00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.630
I'm about to submit to the paperwork to get her a visa.

802
00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.920
But I'm at a critical point in my future career that's very competitive and I

803
00:47:54.921 --> 00:47:59.630
can't deal with any of that much less put up with it for the rest of our lives.

804
00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:02.390
When she freaks out,
she says things like,

805
00:48:02.391 --> 00:48:06.560
she wished she hadn't married me and fuck me and all that,
which is one thing.

806
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:10.970
But then she says she wishes she were dead and that she wants to kill herself.

807
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.390
Oh Dude,
dude.
You know what,

808
00:48:14.391 --> 00:48:18.260
I would take that paperwork and I would go down to staples and say,
hey,
you know,

809
00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:23.300
I'm in the market for a paper shredder.
Um,
do you have the cross cutting one?

810
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.140
And they'd be yes.
Any way you could plug it in.
I could just try it out.

811
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:32.230
And then when they plug it in,
you put that marriage contract and there to here.

812
00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.300
<v 2>Yeah.
Why?</v>

813
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:40.180
<v 1>And then look at the staples guy and be like,
yeah,
I mean it's nice,
but I don't,</v>

814
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.150
I don't think I need it.
I don't think I like it.
And then just walk out.

815
00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.690
All right,
because dude,

816
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:49.780
I think you're going to end up like the guy in the last one living in an old

817
00:48:49.781 --> 00:48:52.090
folks home with some crazy fucking woman.
Anyways,
he goes,

818
00:48:52.091 --> 00:48:55.360
I can find someone else by my friends and family.
No,

819
00:48:55.361 --> 00:48:58.990
we got married and we're expecting to have her over soon.

820
00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.940
Do your parents aren't going to give a fuck?

821
00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:05.770
Is it better to bite the bullet and admit I made a dumb choice rushing into

822
00:49:05.771 --> 00:49:08.770
marrying this girl before I have to deal with the divorce settlements and

823
00:49:08.771 --> 00:49:09.880
absolutely is.

824
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.200
Keep in mind her culture is very old fashioned and our friends and family would

825
00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:18.400
look down on her and she might never date slash marry again.

826
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:22.000
Not your problem,
not your fucking problem.

827
00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.210
She met one foreigner,

828
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:28.150
she can meet another and in case you're wondering,

829
00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:32.200
I'm an average looking white dude.
She's a solid eight to,
I don't give a fuck.

830
00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:35.230
I don't give a fuck.
All right.

831
00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:42.660
Okay,
dude,
I'll,
this is an in the fact that she's not even there.
I mean,

832
00:49:42.661 --> 00:49:45.930
whatever the fuck you are,
this is,
this is the greatest thing ever.

833
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:51.420
The situation that you're in is so easy.
Just don't sign the papers,

834
00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:53.933
<v 0>you know,</v>

835
00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:00.040
<v 1>just call and just be totally honest with just say your mood swings are so crazy</v>

836
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:03.380
that I,
uh,
you know,

837
00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:09.320
I no longer want to marry you and let her flip out and let us scream and yell

838
00:50:09.321 --> 00:50:12.170
and say she's gonna kill herself and all that.
Dude,
you know,

839
00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:17.360
you can feel bad for her,
but you know,
you live once,

840
00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:22.880
okay?
You only live once.
Okay.
And being married is difficult.

841
00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.330
Even when you marry the right person.
Forget about somebody that,
that's,

842
00:50:26.331 --> 00:50:30.500
that emotionally the Radigan she's saying,
I wish I never got fucking married

843
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:35.630
so early in the marriage that you haven't even submitted the fucking papers.

844
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:36.920
I Made Jesus Christ.
Dude,

845
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:42.200
take the hint and you're not happy and you've already made the decision.

846
00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:44.000
[inaudible] we know what you're worried about,
dude.

847
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:49.210
It's going to be weird for a bout fucking four or five days.

848
00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.970
It's like shaving your head.
People like,
dude,
what the fuck?

849
00:50:53.971 --> 00:50:57.940
And half to five days,
I can't remember what you look like with hair doodle.

850
00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:03.140
Walk away walking dumper and just go to the bar and get yourself a really nice

851
00:51:05.161 --> 00:51:09.510
fucking Ipa,
right?
A really nice fucking bear.
Whatever the fuck you want.

852
00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:15.270
And just sit there and just know that you,
your whole future is,
is,

853
00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:21.090
is just wide open,
wide open.
Anything can fucking happen.

854
00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:25.770
Okay.
And that's it dude.
Walk the fuck away

855
00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:31.080
and God bless you for writing in before you ended up in that other guy's

856
00:51:31.081 --> 00:51:34.470
situation.
12 years in and you got that fucking nightmare.

857
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:38.430
Please start that startup.
Dude.
I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding.

858
00:51:38.431 --> 00:51:43.200
I'll give you a fucking 500 bucks.
All right.
Worried about my future.

859
00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:48.630
Uh,
hey Billy,
eight ball.
I love the comedy,
the podcasts,
all of it.

860
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:52.710
I have a problem and was wondering to get some of your advice.

861
00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:58.400
I am the oldest of six and I am a junior and I am a junior in high school and

862
00:51:59.431 --> 00:52:02.580
soon entering my senior year,
everything is going fine,

863
00:52:02.581 --> 00:52:06.180
but the only thing is that I don't want to go to college.
Well then don't go.

864
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:11.580
I personally think college is a scam and unless you want to do to do specialized

865
00:52:11.581 --> 00:52:14.700
profession,
unless you want to do a specialized profession,
I 100% agree.

866
00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:19.350
But besides that,
it's nothing but an institution to make debt slaves.
All right,

867
00:52:19.351 --> 00:52:21.990
well,
okay.
Okay,
relax,
relax.

868
00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:27.450
It's also a great place to meet women.
You know,
it's a great,

869
00:52:27.451 --> 00:52:30.690
it's a great social thing too.
Uh,
he goes,

870
00:52:30.691 --> 00:52:34.620
I want to leave my home state and move out to Wyoming and become a correctional

871
00:52:34.621 --> 00:52:37.110
officer.
Uh,

872
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.840
the only problem is my parents want me to become a lawyer.

873
00:52:39.841 --> 00:52:43.290
I don't want to become a lawyer.
I want to be,
I want to do law enforcement.

874
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.940
I didn't think I should go about telling them I love the podcast and go fuck

875
00:52:47.941 --> 00:52:49.890
yourself.
So I would say,
mom and dad,

876
00:52:49.891 --> 00:52:53.910
I have something important that I need to talk to you about.
Don't worry,

877
00:52:53.911 --> 00:52:58.290
nobody's pregnant.
I'm not on drugs.
Okay.
Start with that joke.

878
00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:01.350
So they'll relax.
It's not life or death.

879
00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:06.180
Just something I need to talk to you about.
Sit and down and say,
listen,

880
00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:12.590
I don't want to be a lawyer.
I want to be in law enforcement.

881
00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:17.630
And then that's it.
And let them react how they're going to react.

882
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:20.510
But you do what you want to do in life.
Uh,

883
00:53:20.511 --> 00:53:25.511
I wouldn't have such a bleak look about how you're definitely informed,

884
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.430
but you don't want to get so dark that you bump people out that you say stuff

885
00:53:29.431 --> 00:53:31.920
like dead slaves.
Um,

886
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:34.860
there's also people that go to college for one year and they meet somebody else

887
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:37.920
and then all of a sudden they build the computer and they make fucking billions

888
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.840
of dollars.
There's all different ways you can do it.

889
00:53:39.841 --> 00:53:44.010
There's also ways go to a fucking community college for two years and then

890
00:53:44.011 --> 00:53:48.930
transfer into the fucking more expensive,
fancier school.

891
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.380
The piece of paper's still going to say that you graduated from there,

892
00:53:52.381 --> 00:53:54.570
you're going to cause going to cost you half as much.

893
00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:59.610
There's a bunch of ways to do it.
All right.
Um,
but I would just sit down,

894
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.360
just
tell your parents what the deal is.

895
00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:07.410
Just let him know.
Like I said,
that you didn't get anybody pregnant in union.

896
00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:11.100
I'd fucking uh,
on drugs so they can fucking relax.
Sorry.

897
00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:15.060
Boston or Chicago for a lady,

898
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:20.910
a Billy Burger.
Tits.
Um,
I'll have you know that I'm back into working out,

899
00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.990
back doing pushups.
Um,
I don't have burger tits.

900
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.240
I have slider tits.
Thank you very much.

901
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:31.200
I'm a 28 year old engineer from the north shore there.

902
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:33.120
Went to school in Boston,

903
00:54:33.121 --> 00:54:38.121
now work in Boston and I live in Somerville saying the rent they used to be

904
00:54:38.461 --> 00:54:39.360
called Slummerville.

905
00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:44.190
Now it's all fucking hipsters and cupcake places and all that.
It's amazing.

906
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:49.550
I started dating this girl a little over a year ago who lives in Somerville too,

907
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:56.720
but it's from Chicago
ball,
but is from Chicago.

908
00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:01.470
She just got a new job in Chicago and is moving back there in a month.

909
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:06.920
We talked about this happening before and kind of just decided to play it by

910
00:55:08.731 --> 00:55:11.730
beer,
she said and deal with it when it comes.

911
00:55:11.731 --> 00:55:16.500
Well it came and short term solution is that I will stay in Boston for the next

912
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:21.000
year and do long distance relationship.
All right,

913
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:25.470
wait a second.
Start dating this new girl.
A little oversee.
Been in it for a year.

914
00:55:25.471 --> 00:55:27.270
You're 28 okay,

915
00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:32.280
so I guess my problem is that I'm kind of at an age where I should buy a house

916
00:55:32.281 --> 00:55:36.270
instead of throwing money away on rent.
So if I decided to move to Chicago,

917
00:55:36.271 --> 00:55:39.120
I think we would settle down there and stay there.

918
00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:43.500
But I love living in the Boston area.
Granted,
I've never lived anywhere else,

919
00:55:43.501 --> 00:55:45.720
so who knows what it will be like.

920
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:51.270
I'm still very close with all my high school friends who all live around here.

921
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:56.070
My old man's always on me about buying a house here and wants to fix it up

922
00:55:56.071 --> 00:56:00.090
together.
If I moved to Chicago,
that doesn't help.
Do I choose the girl?

923
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.570
And life most likely in Chicago or stay here,

924
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:05.640
save up for a house,

925
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:10.650
be close to friends and family and try to convince her to come back to Boston.

926
00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:14.970
Um,
so I,
a few years ago at the Wilbur,

927
00:56:14.971 --> 00:56:18.360
we'll be at the garden show in October with the boys.
Can't fucking wait dude.

928
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:23.100
Thank you.
Thank you for that.
Um,
I dunno dude,
is she the one?

929
00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:28.890
Um,
that's what I would ask myself.

930
00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:33.780
I would just do what I want.
I want you do this over the next fucking year.

931
00:56:33.781 --> 00:56:36.120
Why don't you go out there and visit Chicago

932
00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:41.570
and see if you like it and see if you still like that person.

933
00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:44.750
The great thing is you don't have to make this decision right now.

934
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:49.010
And if you wait another year to buy a house,
no biggie.
Okay.

935
00:56:49.011 --> 00:56:52.070
As far as making a rash,
fucking decision,

936
00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:55.900
dumping this person or buying a place in Boston or,

937
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:58.010
or buying a place out there before you know about,

938
00:56:58.011 --> 00:57:01.160
I would just go out there and I'd get the lay of the land.

939
00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:04.670
I get the lay of the land there.
I can tell you

940
00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:10.850
Chicago is,
uh,
an incredible city.
I love it.

941
00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:15.050
The food's amazing.
The people are amazing.
The sports there are incredible,

942
00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:18.530
but you know whose kid note you're always going to be a Celtics Bruins,

943
00:57:18.531 --> 00:57:20.720
red sox or patriots fan that you just have to be.

944
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:23.270
But now you've got the sports packages and all of that.

945
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:28.630
But I can't tell you since 1995 I've been living behind enemy lines as a sports

946
00:57:31.971 --> 00:57:36.230
fan.
I don't think it'll be as bad in Chicago.
Um,

947
00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:38.420
I just live in New York and La,

948
00:57:38.421 --> 00:57:42.500
so it was like fucking Yankee fans and Laker fans.
So it's just that bullshit.

949
00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:47.540
Um,
also during the curse of the Bambino.

950
00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:53.350
Um,
so,
but that is a big decision.
Um,

951
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:57.230
and I don't know how much you're into this person.
All right.

952
00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.440
I would think of what your soul mate,

953
00:58:00.441 --> 00:58:04.430
it would be a no brainer and you just go wherever the fuck she was going.

954
00:58:04.431 --> 00:58:07.160
Within reason though,
cause you can meet your fucking soul mate.
You know,

955
00:58:07.161 --> 00:58:10.670
if they go into some shit all,
you know,
you're not going to want that.

956
00:58:10.671 --> 00:58:13.010
But Chicago was not a shit hole.

957
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:14.563
<v 0>Uh,</v>

958
00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:20.700
<v 1>yeah.
I mean,
I obviously I can't make this decision for you,
but,
uh,
if you think,</v>

959
00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:24.330
I dunno,
you know,
when you know,

960
00:58:24.331 --> 00:58:27.180
you know when you're with the right fucking person.
So if you feel that,

961
00:58:27.181 --> 00:58:31.950
then I would,
you know,
worry about going somewhere where she lives.

962
00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:36.480
Uh,
because it's Chicago.
I mean,
that's a good move.
Chicago's fucking great.

963
00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.320
One thing went from Boston to like fucking,
I don't know Albany,

964
00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.770
no offense Albany,
but you know what the fuck?
Um,

965
00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.580
I don't know to what,
I can't make this fucking decision for you,

966
00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:52.350
but I wouldn't buy a house or move out there until you figured it out.

967
00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:55.800
How about that?
Uh,
your high school friends,

968
00:58:55.801 --> 00:58:58.080
but you guys are all going to get married and have kids and then you're never

969
00:58:58.081 --> 00:59:01.690
going to fucking see each other anyways.
I can tell you that.
Um,

970
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:07.770
or barely see each other or fucking go out and happy to be home by nine 30 or 10

971
00:59:07.771 --> 00:59:11.910
o'clock for the sitter,
which is a really healthy life,
which is why I wished,

972
00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:14.820
you know,
I got married and had kids along fucking time ago.

973
00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:18.630
I wouldn't be fucking out there running around,
um,

974
00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:20.280
staying out all hours of the night,

975
00:59:20.281 --> 00:59:23.410
which is what I would do because I didn't want to go back to the empty lonely

976
00:59:23.411 --> 00:59:24.051
hotel room.

977
00:59:24.051 --> 00:59:27.730
So I would stay out as long as I could tell us about ready to fall asleep and I

978
00:59:27.731 --> 00:59:31.580
would just coming to the hotel room and just fucking collapsed.
Uh,

979
00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:32.800
so they go,

980
00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:38.010
there's my advice from a fucking moron comedian.

981
00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:41.260
All right.
That,
that was my,

982
00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:46.340
my pinion as a male for me anyways.

983
00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:47.341
All right.

984
00:59:47.341 --> 00:59:52.200
Go Celtics game to a red sox and Yankees tied for first place,

985
00:59:52.201 --> 00:59:56.760
which is fucking awesome.
A Red Sox is on fire now.
We've cooled off.

986
00:59:56.790 --> 01:00:00.570
Now the Yankees are on fire tied for first place and maybe they're a game ahead.

987
01:00:00.571 --> 01:00:02.820
It's right where you want it.
It's right where you want it.

988
01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.770
It's no fun being at first place if the Yankees aren't there as a red sox fan.

989
01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:10.080
Okay.
And we've played each other's six times.

990
01:00:10.081 --> 01:00:13.650
They were three and three so hopefully we'll get to,
you know,

991
01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.000
battle it out in September.

992
01:00:15.001 --> 01:00:19.050
Maybe we both make the make the playoffs and we meet once again in October.

993
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:22.680
That's what I'm hoping for.

994
01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:26.630
And hopefully the Lakers get fucking good against so we can beat their asses in

995
01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:30.210
the final next year.
God knows they'll go out and fucking uh,

996
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:34.290
get a whole bunch of free agents.
Who doesn't want to play out their racist La,

997
01:00:34.291 --> 01:00:38.880
it's always summer and a,
you can fuck movie stars.
All right.

998
01:00:38.881 --> 01:00:43.710
That's it as opposed to racist Boston where you got to deal with the witness and

999
01:00:43.711 --> 01:00:47.130
for the most part you go walk around fucking sixes and sevens,

1000
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:50.760
I guess you'd fuck tens but there's not as many tens in Boston.

1001
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.570
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1002
01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:57.010
<v 1>And then in the end,
the best tense,
the top of the line 10.
So they all leave.</v>

1003
01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:01.000
They all go to the majors like New York or fucking in La,

1004
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:04.540
and then New York and La claim them as if they're from them,

1005
01:01:04.541 --> 01:01:09.340
but they're not like New York City is a free agent town as is la.

1006
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:15.280
There's just a bunch of fucking people coming in there.
Um,
so anyways.
All right.

1007
01:01:15.281 --> 01:01:19.240
That's it.
That's the podcast for this week.
I will check in on you on Thursday.

1008
01:01:19.241 --> 01:01:23.210
Thanks for all the kind of notes about the bill Hader interview.
Uh,

1009
01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:26.770
I would like to do more of those in the future.
Um,
and that's it.

1010
01:01:26.771 --> 01:01:28.830
And if you haven't checked out Barry yet on Hbr,

1011
01:01:28.831 --> 01:01:32.230
promoted against a might be my favorite show out there right now.
All right,

1012
01:01:32.231 --> 01:01:34.900
that's it.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I'll talk to you on Thursday.
