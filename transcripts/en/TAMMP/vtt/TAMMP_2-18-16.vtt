00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.440
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr and his time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:08.990
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.300
Dan Checking in on.
Yeah.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.220
I'm just checking in on you.
How are you?
How's your week going?
I hope you're,
uh,

5
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.210
help you're accomplishing things.
I hope you have a sense of purpose.

6
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.960
I hope that uh,
that

7
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.220
<v 0>Douche with the bad breath in the fucking terminal head cold,</v>

8
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.640
that content doesn't walk by your cubicle today.

9
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:38.200
You know him fucking coming down the fucking hall.

10
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.600
Um,
anyways,
I am in a,
I'm in a great mood.
Believe it or not,

11
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.440
I just uh,
I finally got,
I tell you guys are saying,
you know,

12
00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:52.060
I was trying to take the uh,
the old timey door locks out of my old timey doors,

13
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:55.810
my old timey fucking house,
which by the way,

14
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.690
I had an architect come over here.
I was going to do it right this time,
you know,

15
00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:04.570
for the whole fucking idea that I was going to have to make a drum room in my

16
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:07.570
garage or whatever.
And,
you know,
the whole thing went to shit.

17
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.470
And I'm not going to tell you why because I don't need the fucking hassle man.

18
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.690
But I just,
I found out the fucking history of this house and,
um,

19
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.340
you know,
I didn't want to get into it.

20
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.590
Tony,
you want to get into it?
Just,
you know,
fuck it.

21
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.970
Just forget it.

22
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.320
<v 1>I had a dream and it went in the shitter.</v>

23
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.490
<v 0>Um,
is it,
I swear to God I'm,
I'm,</v>

24
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:40.790
I'm in with this fucking house.
There's no turning back.
So anyways,
I'm just,

25
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:44.660
I'm just putting my head down and I'm fixing every fucking goddamn thing in this

26
00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:48.680
fucking house that was painted over Jerry rigged.

27
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.480
Not done with the fucking,

28
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.530
I don't know who bill a fucking mailman built half of his fucking house.

29
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.480
So anyways,
I got these,
uh,

30
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.540
these old door locks and of course some dose paid this other Douche to come in

31
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:05.990
here and he just painted over everything.
Well,
she did.
Okay.

32
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.600
I don't really branded as sexist here.
Okay.

33
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.130
A woman is just as good with the paint brush as a man is,
if not better.

34
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.250
There are certain studies on scratch my twat.com that actually indicate that a

35
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:23.750
female.
Um,
so I finally got the,
uh,

36
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.221
I finally got the door,

37
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:28.640
looks out of my door and I brought him down to the old fella down the street,

38
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:33.620
the locksmith guy and I gave him three,
two of which were original,
none what?

39
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.710
And another one was a newer like home depot style ones.
So he goes,

40
00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:39.080
this new home depot,
when I can't make a skeleton key for,

41
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:40.310
it's a big fucking pain in the ass.

42
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.340
I think I have an older lock from the same era is your other locks.

43
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:48.080
So I said,
well okay,
let's do that.
And I was like,
all right,

44
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.310
you'll give me a shout when you,
when you get these things done.
And I said,

45
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.001
you know,

46
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:58.001
preferably one key would be able to match all of them like a skeleton key and

47
00:02:58.071 --> 00:03:02.170
can I also get one of those cool looking skeleton keys instead of some modern

48
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:05.050
looking key?
And he goes,
oh,
absolutely.
He goes,
that's the only key that'll work.

49
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.100
And guess who fucking called me right before I sat down two days,

50
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.110
two days later,
this guy called Becky has to lock fixed and all that shit.

51
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:18.670
So now in my office there's a,

52
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.590
you know,
I got two little closets.

53
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.010
I can lock both those doors and I can lock the main door.
And then the,

54
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.870
when you go into the bathroom,
um,
you can,

55
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:32.920
uh,
that one I had fixed last year,
so they'll all fucking work.

56
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.570
You know what I love about it is Nia was giving me shit going like,

57
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:40.720
what the fuck are you pulling all the doors apart?
You know?

58
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.470
And I tried to tell her,
and she just kept going,
you are not a locksmith.

59
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.200
Just kept giving me shit going,
you're going to fuck up the house.
I go,
no,

60
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:53.920
and I'm gonna do it.
Just kept going,
Yo,
not a locksmith.
Um,

61
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.440
and then just was openly laughing at me,
um,

62
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.650
as she does,
which of course made me laugh at myself,
but I got these fuckers out,

63
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.130
um,
by,
of course,

64
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:10.690
going on youtube and learning how to like get these things off without stripping

65
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:13.810
the,
uh,
the screws and all that.

66
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.510
I found this great youtube video of this guy goes,
all right,

67
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:20.380
you just stick the screwdriver in there and you give just a little bit of

68
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:24.720
pressure and then you just sort of tap it lightly with the hammer,
you know,

69
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.760
and that loosens up the paint and then eventually you were able to turn the

70
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:29.320
thing and God damn it,
if it didn't work,

71
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:32.680
it worked on all of them except the ones that I stripped from being too fucking

72
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:37.110
impatient.
So I have a bit of a problem on a couple of doors.
But anyways,
um,

73
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.670
I got three of them down in this room and I've got about another five to go.

74
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.500
And then unfortunately I,
there's another couple of doors that,
um,

75
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.350
you know,
we'll replace with those awful home depot one.

76
00:04:51.351 --> 00:04:53.270
So I'd like to get some new ones.
And I know what you think.

77
00:04:53.271 --> 00:04:55.690
And like Jesus Christ,
Bill,
what's with all the doors in your house?

78
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.530
Old houses had a lot of doors,
not a lot of square footage,

79
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.370
not a lot of big closets or anything,
but the,
God damn it,

80
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:04.690
they had a lot of doors.

81
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.490
And despite the fact that everybody back then seem to own maybe one suit that

82
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:13.930
you got married in and you know,
buried your friends in and all of that shit.

83
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.960
Like for some reason they had an unbelievable urge to lock things up.

84
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:20.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

85
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.320
<v 0>You know
what they had back then,</v>

86
00:05:24.321 --> 00:05:27.550
then maybe they would pan and for gold and shit.
I don't know.

87
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.220
I don't know what you would have a value back then,
right?

88
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:32.530
Everybody walking around looking like Johnny Appleseed,

89
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.790
why do they have so many door?
Um,

90
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.530
so anyways,
that's like the big fucking highlight of my day.
And,
uh,

91
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.840
also speaking of which,
I've watched the,
uh,

92
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:47.740
the Bruins replay today at them playing,
uh,
the Columbus blue jackets.

93
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.940
And once again,
another great game was great to see Adam McQuade come back.

94
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.490
And as much as Marshawn scoring streak ended,

95
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:59.491
Louie Erickson's has kept his going and a fucking broad man.

96
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.620
I'm telling you,
I can't stress it enough.
Like I was go,

97
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.970
they got rid of Lou Cheech and all those guys.
I was like,

98
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:08.660
we are going to absolutely suck this year and we are a solid fucking team.

99
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.690
Um,
so anyways,

100
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:14.870
so I'm watching the game and at one point,

101
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:16.370
I don't know if anybody watched the game,

102
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:21.371
they were doing this camera angle where it was almost at like the top of the

103
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:22.394
building.

104
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.190
So it'd be like if he had like upper deck seats so you could really watch like

105
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.980
the play develop.
Um,
and I just thought it was a great camera angle.

106
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.680
If the NHL wanted to get more,
of course they want to get more.
Right.
Of course.

107
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:39.320
They want to get more fans.
They want to make more money.
It's like the NFL.

108
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:42.470
I was talking to somebody last night and they were trying to claim that the

109
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:46.070
fucking Jacksonville Jaguars might move to London.

110
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.990
All right.
And I don't mean Connecticut,
isn't there a London and Connecticut,

111
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.420
London,
England.
Like,
that's how we're going to,

112
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.450
that's our first move to make NFL football worldwide.

113
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.890
We're going to take our worst fucking franchise

114
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.960
and put that thing on point.
Um,
evidently it's owned by some,
uh,

115
00:07:09.961 --> 00:07:12.380
I think Pakistanian or something.
And who lives in England?

116
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:14.420
I have no fucking idea.
That's what somebody was trying to tell me.

117
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:17.630
I have no idea.
I was in a bar.
People were talking,
I was nodding,

118
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:20.390
my eyebrows were up going,
Oh really?
Rarely.

119
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.540
And now I'm just telling you what I heard.
I haven't looked any of this.

120
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:26.210
I didn't even Wikipedia the bullshit.
I'm telling you right now.

121
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:28.700
So take all of that with a giant grain of salt.

122
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:30.270
Throw it over your shoulder and you know,

123
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.040
do your little Sammy Sosa Kiss your fingers.
Ll Cool j thank right.

124
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.130
Anyways.
Um,

125
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.490
<v 4>okay.</v>

126
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.650
<v 0>I think bay,
I know sitting there going,</v>

127
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:42.370
why the fuck would the NFL wanna put a team in London?

128
00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:45.520
Like why can't you just be happy being like billionaires?

129
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.020
Like isn't that enough for you?

130
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.330
And I think they're jealous of world cup soccer because as much as the

131
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:55.990
Superbowl's this giant thing,
or we think it's this giant thing,
it got like,

132
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.770
I guess like 80 to 100 million views or something.
Once again,

133
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.030
I'm just throwing these numbers out there,

134
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.630
but recently like a soccer or football is what I should really call it,

135
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.800
considering that's what the world calls it.

136
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.583
<v 4>MMM.</v>

137
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:13.510
<v 0>Do you know it's funny when they say they go,</v>

138
00:08:13.511 --> 00:08:18.100
why do you call it football when you carry it?
And it's just like,
it's like,

139
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.700
I don't know,
somebody had the great joke,
but why don't you call it feet ball?

140
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.610
You know,
you'd be able to use both of them,
right?

141
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:29.080
If you want to be fucking clever.
Cons about it.
Um,
so anyways,

142
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:29.980
football,

143
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:34.840
World Cup football had a sum game that was just some regional final or whatever

144
00:08:34.841 --> 00:08:37.810
the fuck it was.
A friendly,
whatever the fuck they call it.

145
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:43.210
It's one of those ones that isn't the World Cup.
And it got like a billion views.

146
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.890
Like out of the seven and a half billion people on this fucking planet.

147
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.833
<v 4>MMM.</v>

148
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.960
<v 0>It got a billion fucking views.
So this sitting they go,</v>

149
00:08:52.961 --> 00:08:54.820
we got to go global with us,
Shit.

150
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.070
And our first move is going to be descending evidently the Jacksonville Jaguars

151
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:00.750
out to fucking London,

152
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:05.640
England to a bunch of fish and chips and cuts.
Um,

153
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.520
anyways,
I'm fucking with you.
So anyway,
so much in that the,

154
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:11.910
the Bruins game.

155
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.940
So they do this camera angle from up top of the building and you can really

156
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.230
watch the play develop,

157
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.550
especially if you're like a novice fan of hockey because the fact that they're

158
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.980
to the side,
you know,

159
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:28.590
if you've played hockey and you've gone to enough hockey games,

160
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:32.250
like you actually have to watch,
you got to know what's going on,

161
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.090
like three feet off of the screen,
you know,

162
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:40.680
like literally like you'll see a team bringing the puck down the ice and a guy

163
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:44.400
flips it into the zone and then the entire team disappears as the camera follows

164
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:47.670
the puck.
Now if you know,
watch hockey,
you're going like,
well,

165
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.360
what the fuck to everybody just quit.
Where'd they go?
You don't realize that?
Oh,

166
00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:56.130
it's a line change.
Um,
now with this angle you could do that.

167
00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:58.200
And I was actually thinking what would be cool as you know,

168
00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:01.320
the NFL has those cameras on fucking why

169
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.890
they should do that.
They should have a camera.

170
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:13.070
Like I would say that you should run a line right across the red line

171
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.610
that they still have,
even though they don't even use it anymore.
Okay.

172
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:18.950
And you have one camera pointed down,

173
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.860
one end and the other down the other and basically you just follow the puck up

174
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:27.330
the ice,
um,
as you normally do throughout the whole game.

175
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:32.100
But anytime there's like a power play or if a team establishes,
you know,

176
00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:33.870
themselves in the offensive zone,

177
00:10:33.871 --> 00:10:37.830
you would then cut to that camera and you could really,

178
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:42.660
you could basically see what everybody was doing because a lot of times when it

179
00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:44.700
goes out to the point,
you can't see what's going on.

180
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.180
If somebody down behind the neck,
you could just be,
you know,

181
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.500
seeing the entire thing.
And then the second it fucking,
you know,

182
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.140
the other team gains control of the puck and they comp the ice.

183
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:58.440
He just flip back to that traditional view that they always show.

184
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.020
And Oh,
freckles,

185
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:03.690
fucking brain was going when I was watching this and I was thinking,

186
00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:03.991
you know what,

187
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:08.991
I bet in the future they'll have something like that and probably they'll end up

188
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:15.240
having cameras in the helmets and you'll be able to add home,

189
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.020
act like the guy in one of those Monday night football trucks and you'll be able

190
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:20.460
to direct your own game.

191
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:26.150
And then the NHL would have like a show us your best edit of fucking,

192
00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:29.490
you know,
whatever McQuaids slap,

193
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:33.900
slap up from the point or whatever and you get to show your,
your,
uh,

194
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.910
your edited version of the fucking game.
Like in the future,

195
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.130
just be able to flip around and it'll drive everybody fucking nuts who's trying

196
00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:44.940
to watch the game.
And then there'll be an old grizzled cont like may God,

197
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.290
I'm old school.
I looked at TV,
dictate the angles,
you know.

198
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.560
Um,
but anyways,
I just thought it was like a really cool

199
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.020
way to watch the game.
And,
and um,
the NHL is,

200
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.640
was actually ahead of everybody else by having onscreen graphics.

201
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.050
They just came out too early and went too hard when they had the flaming trail

202
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.130
behind the puck and everybody laughed at him and ridiculed him and everything.

203
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.030
But now when you look at NFL football and they have like the first down thing is

204
00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:20.590
all lit up and uh,
everybody's drawn all over the screens and all of that show.

205
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:25.240
I guess Madden was doing that beforehand.
Um,
I dunno,

206
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.600
I just thought it was a cool way,
you know,
something I,

207
00:12:27.601 --> 00:12:30.610
I thought it was a good idea and then I set it out loud and I still think it's a

208
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:34.550
good idea,
but I really just bombed in the presentation.
But I'm,

209
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.750
speaking of which,
as far as like hockey,
I guess Las Vegas,

210
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.480
even though they haven't been awarded a team yet,

211
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.490
is just gone ahead and just as building a stadium that evidently is going to be

212
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:51.700
one of the best stadiums in the league if they're allowed in the league,

213
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:57.090
which is exciting and really fucking annoying to me as a Bruins fan,

214
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.150
one of the original six teams,
the fact that we just went down to home depot,

215
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:02.050
as I've always said,

216
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:07.200
and just bought 50,000 fucking cinderblocks and built a rectangle considering we

217
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:10.690
used to play in the Boston Garden,
which was one of the fucking,

218
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.740
you know Meccas I don't want to use that fucking Madison Square Garden world.

219
00:13:14.741 --> 00:13:18.640
It was,
it was a fucking church.
It was a cathedral.
It was an old barn.

220
00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:22.180
It was the shit.
All right.
And the fact that we just,
you know,

221
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.890
the fact that the Dallas Stars have a better fucking,
you know,
Minnesota wild,

222
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.040
they got a bit,
they got a way better,

223
00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:33.670
way more personality and shit to those fucking venues than what we have is a

224
00:13:33.671 --> 00:13:36.790
goddamn crime.
So now in Las Vegas,

225
00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:41.350
that building a fucking arena for a team,
they don't even have yet.

226
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.900
I just saw it like halfway completed.
I've got to look at this.
Fuck,

227
00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:44.980
this place looks amazing.

228
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.050
So I immediately started thinking like,
well wait a minute.

229
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:55.570
Vegas is going to have a team.
What would you call the team?
Now,

230
00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:58.570
back in the day,
you could call them what they should be called.

231
00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:02.980
This should call them like the gamblers.
You know,
remember the Houston gamblers,

232
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:07.000
they had the gamblers back in,
uh,
the USFL days.
They were the Houston gamblers.

233
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.560
But you know,
there's no fucking way,
there's no fucking way they'll do that.

234
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.650
They should call him the fucking Vegas Gamblers,
right?

235
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.310
And their mascot should be like this degenerate gambler,
right?

236
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.150
Just look at some broke ass guy,
just,
you know,
but it's,
it's a,

237
00:14:22.151 --> 00:14:24.820
it's a fucking mascot look and things.
So it's,
it's funny,

238
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:29.080
kind of like being the town drunk used to be funny before they said,
no,

239
00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:33.610
he's an alcoholic,
he has a disease and you know,
all the foster Brooks guys,

240
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:37.120
stop losing.
Stop getting work.
You know,

241
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.550
you know it's going to fucking happen.

242
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:43.550
All these fucking Goddamn Pansy fucking soccer mom,

243
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:49.540
mini van driving Douche bags,
they're going to end up calling them like,

244
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.570
I don't know the Geckos of the road runners.

245
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.970
Yeah.
No,
not even.
They won't even call him the sidewinders.
You know,

246
00:14:58.971 --> 00:15:01.730
cause well that's a poisonous snake and,
and you know,

247
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.710
we don't want to scare the children.

248
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.153
<v 3>Okay.</v>

249
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.880
<v 0>You know,
I just,
I don't fucking understand it.</v>

250
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.100
Why can't you call him the gambles?

251
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.670
You have a degenerate gambler as a mascot and then you teach a kid a lesson.

252
00:15:14.671 --> 00:15:16.290
You see that?
You see that fucking right.

253
00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:20.570
That's what happens when you go on these goddamn casinos.
Okay.
All right.
No,

254
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:23.360
I'm not getting yet another fucking popcorn.
Yeah,
Nah.

255
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.793
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

256
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.910
<v 0>Old School parenting old school.
Yeah.
Parenting.</v>

257
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:33.200
Was it at one point during the game,
you took your kid too.
You made him cry.

258
00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:38.830
All right.
And I'll tell you right now,
the day that that ended,

259
00:15:38.831 --> 00:15:41.080
there was the day that this country started going down the shitter.

260
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:47.830
I'm sorry.
Anyways,
what?
W what do you do?
I want to hear you guys' guesses.

261
00:15:47.831 --> 00:15:49.000
What do you think they're going to call them?

262
00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:51.893
<v 3>Huh?</v>

263
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.480
<v 0>The maces,
the Pueblos.
He can't say pueblos though.
Those were,</v>

264
00:15:57.481 --> 00:16:01.660
there was a native American groups,
so they'll get upset.
The,
uh,

265
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:08.200
the star dust,
you know,

266
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.750
they're going to do that.
If you can't call a team that devil rays,

267
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.640
if you just got to switch it to the res because people are so fucking paranoid

268
00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:18.050
that if you call it the devil rays,

269
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.760
that one of their kids is going to get fucking,
uh,
what do they call it?

270
00:16:22.761 --> 00:16:27.470
Possessed of,
of,
of the name of a fucking baseball team or what,
what,

271
00:16:27.471 --> 00:16:32.040
what a horrific is great as this stadium is as awesome as it would be.

272
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.270
I don't know why.
Like I'm,

273
00:16:33.271 --> 00:16:38.220
I'm totally against teams being down in the sunbelt except in Vegas.

274
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:42.930
Vegas needs to have a team and you know what?
They should be fucking shifty,

275
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:47.610
shady,
any fucking thing that begins with the sh other than Shitty,

276
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.230
you know,
they should cheat.
They should have like a bunch of Ken Lynn Smith.

277
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.730
I don't want fucking knee breakers,

278
00:16:53.731 --> 00:16:58.660
but they just used to be the cheapest motherfuckers in the league.
You know,

279
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.930
just old school fucking shit.
That would be great.
That would be great.

280
00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:05.690
That's not going to happen.
That's not going to happen.
They'll play,

281
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.440
they'll call him the fucking,
uh Oh,
what do they call them?

282
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.210
Something like that.
The star dust and they'll hire the first female head coach.

283
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.220
They just,
they're it.
They'll go that route.

284
00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.310
That's the direction it's all heading.
You know,

285
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:25.330
we should have known when when times square went from like fucking a place where

286
00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:29.360
you could jerk off while someone mopped it up simultaneously.
Right.

287
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:34.010
It's some one legged freak was doing her dance in front of you to go into like

288
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:39.011
the M and m store and now they have chairs where you can sit down in the middle

289
00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:41.870
of the fucking street once,
once that went that direction.

290
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.150
How did I not see the direction?
That's sports.

291
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:48.140
We're going to go and you know that everyone was going to get a ribbon.

292
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.310
You know?
I don't know.
I don't even want to get into this.

293
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.700
I don't even give it a shot.
What happened?
I was in a great mode or hey,

294
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.970
I have got to live with these fucking door locks.
All right,
what are we into?

295
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:03.060
17 minutes into year checking in on you here.
Um,

296
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.920
what else did I want to talk about here in this thing?
Oh my God,
I lost my shit.

297
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.700
I had been doing so well with my temper lately.

298
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.280
You wouldn't know it from this podcast,
but all Billy's been making some strides.

299
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.330
Um,
I don't want to happen about a month ago,

300
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.950
I started to flip out when I was in the car.
No,
I was at an airport.
That's right.

301
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.220
Car Airport.
When you get to my age,
it's all the same thing.

302
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.280
It's some form of transportation,
whether you're in it or standing,

303
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:30.810
trying to get on it.
It's all it gives.

304
00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:33.870
It just sorta all blends into one thing and then all of a sudden you're just

305
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:38.440
like,
it's Christmas again.
That's what getting old is.
All right.

306
00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.250
You don't know where you are and all of a sudden it's Christmas again.

307
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:44.070
That's basically what you have to look forward to.
All right,

308
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.280
so what that depressing thought.
Let's plow forward.
So we're in this,

309
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.750
we're at the airport and I went to the sky cap,
you know,

310
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:55.380
rather than going to the fucking electronic faceless cut thing that I'm supposed

311
00:18:55.381 --> 00:18:56.910
to,
you know,
that can't read my

312
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.550
credit card and all of that horseshit and is what one person to help 70 people

313
00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:06.270
on these things.
I go to this fucking guy and uh,

314
00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:09.030
he ends up shooting the shit with somebody else he takes for fucking ever.

315
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.420
And I was starting to lose my shit as I do,
as I do.

316
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.190
I don't have control of my emotions.
My emotions have control of me.
Um,

317
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:22.680
my wife just tapped me and she just goes,
given a minute.
It's all she said,

318
00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.750
given a minute.
And for some reason,

319
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:29.400
I don't know why that is just stuck in my head.
And as I,
you know,

320
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.940
more times than not,
when I start to flip out,
I just think given a minute,

321
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.550
take a breath,
just given them an a and it's been really fucking work.

322
00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:41.370
And for me about,
you know,
11% of the time,
um,
which is,

323
00:19:41.371 --> 00:19:44.820
you know,
whatever,
you know,
11% better.

324
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.190
So last night I get in the car,
it's fucking raining out here.
So you know,

325
00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:51.840
the deal,
you'd starts to rain out here,

326
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.830
everybody freaks the fuck out because you know,
they're not used to,

327
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.110
I don't know what the deal is.
I guess there's a bunch of

328
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.570
fluids from cars just builds up and it doesn't get washed away.
So yeah,

329
00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:07.920
I guess the roads are a little more slippery.
But anyways,

330
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.320
so I'm driving to pick my wife up,
right?

331
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:16.980
And I'm at this red light and I'm the third person in line at the red light.

332
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.263
Okay.

333
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:22.560
So when you're the third person in line to make a left in Los Angeles,

334
00:20:22.561 --> 00:20:27.120
your eyes are fucking locked in on the movements of the person who's in the pole

335
00:20:27.121 --> 00:20:31.740
position.
And you need that fucker to make a move.
Okay?

336
00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:35.670
Take a little bit of risk or you're not going to make the light.
Okay?

337
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.990
So I'm just sitting there locked in on that thing,
like my fucking pit bull,

338
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.740
when it hears a noise at the front door and it's fucking ears goes up and it's

339
00:20:43.741 --> 00:20:48.400
such going low,
right?
And it's fucking hair.
That's,

340
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:53.350
that's the fucking mode I'm in.
And do you know,
I watched this stupid La Cunt,

341
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.940
all right?
Or whatever transplant,
not going to blame the city here

342
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.830
goes to make a left stops.

343
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.440
Okay.
Stops.

344
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.100
There's somebody in the crosswalk so the person stops.

345
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:12.101
Okay.

346
00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:15.310
And then the traffic that's trying to drive through one person is making a right

347
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.870
where that person's making the left.

348
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.350
So they're waiting for the person that crosswalk and the other person is trying

349
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:21.190
to make a left.

350
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.550
So this person is not blocking because both people are turning,

351
00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:28.850
one's turning on the same street as the fucking lefty cunt and the elements

352
00:21:28.851 --> 00:21:33.200
going the other direction.
Do you know?
For whatever fucking reason,

353
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:38.790
this asshole,
like I don't know what they did.

354
00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:41.970
They just,
a person got through the crosswalk and then rather than going,

355
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.740
I,
and I'm like three cars back on what?

356
00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.990
You know what they did?
You're never going to guess.

357
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.890
They backed up and got back in line,

358
00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.160
backed up in fucking,
was it 2007,

359
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.300
nine years coming up on nine years of living out here.

360
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.200
That is the most fucked up moron move I've ever seen.

361
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.730
And you want to talk about not giving it a minute and absolutely losing your

362
00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:16.920
shit.
Aye.
I literally was in the car and went,

363
00:22:16.921 --> 00:22:21.921
you fucking fucking and then said the word that isn't acceptable now anymore.

364
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.280
It used to mean you're a jerk.
Um,

365
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.960
and also begins with an f.
And then what I did was,
you know,

366
00:22:33.961 --> 00:22:37.320
it was funny right after I did that because I yelled and I had to do a show.

367
00:22:37.321 --> 00:22:41.070
I reached into my console and I put a lodge in my mouth.

368
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:44.750
<v 6>Okay.</v>

369
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.310
<v 0>And I immediately laughed at myself and saw how ridiculous I was.
Big.</v>

370
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.270
I really wish I could control my emotions more.
Um,

371
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.280
I've never noticed cause I grew around,

372
00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.120
I grew up around a bunch of fucking hotheads and I never realized like it's

373
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:05.290
finally dawning on me as I approached the fucking half century mark.

374
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.210
Um,
it's,

375
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.330
it's finally dawning on me a what?

376
00:23:11.331 --> 00:23:14.500
A weakness that is.
Yeah,

377
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:19.290
I know it because it's just dawning on me now.
I can't really articulate it.

378
00:23:19.291 --> 00:23:23.650
It's one of those,
those,
uh,
one of those Mama,

379
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.493
I'm trying to think of them,

380
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.560
Hollywood movie I've seen where somebody just gets caught up in their own

381
00:23:27.561 --> 00:23:30.410
fucking power and then halfway through it they're like,
wait,

382
00:23:30.411 --> 00:23:34.910
but we're the victims,
right?
Were what the fuck movie was that,

383
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:42.240
ah,
Shit.
Who's this great movie with?

384
00:23:42.241 --> 00:23:47.241
This guy was getting picked on and then he just took fucking control and then he

385
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:51.590
started abusing his power and then the end,

386
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.600
he just sorta kinda dawned on him that,
wait a minute,
and I w w

387
00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.130
I'm right,
right.
As he sees,

388
00:23:59.131 --> 00:24:03.120
seen the fucking hurt that he caused other people.
And I want to say,

389
00:24:03.121 --> 00:24:07.800
blows his brains out.
Add Jesus Christ building.

390
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.390
You know,
it's what he got to fight a dollar for every fucking movie.
I la,

391
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:15.530
I forgot.
You know,
I'd have a good 250 bucks.

392
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.570
Um,
all right,
let's,
uh,
let's read a little advertising here for this.
Uh,

393
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.830
for this Thursday afternoon,
um,
headspace.

394
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.910
All right.
Let's be honest.
Most of your problems start with your mind.
Fear,

395
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.770
anger,
stress.
Oh,
Jesus was not,
was I not telling the perfect story?
Fear,
anger,

396
00:24:37.771 --> 00:24:40.650
stress,
anxiety,
depression,
sleeplessness.

397
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.970
They begin in your head,
but they can wreck your life.

398
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:46.363
<v 4>MMM.</v>

399
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.420
<v 0>Please include all of the falling points during your read.
Ah,</v>

400
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:55.160
why did they write that?
I'm going to read everything you wrote.

401
00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:59.060
All right.
I've said this on numerous episodes.
Okay.

402
00:24:59.061 --> 00:25:00.500
But it doesn't have to be that way.

403
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.800
You can make a major difference in just 10 minutes a day.

404
00:25:03.801 --> 00:25:06.080
The change comes through guided meditation.

405
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:10.260
I need the shipment with the new headspace APP.

406
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:16.610
Headspace is meditation made simple.

407
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.720
It's guided meditations that you listened to whenever you want,

408
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.170
wherever you want,
right on your phone,
computer or tablet.

409
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.820
Meditation is rooted in thousands of years of tradition and we're going to take

410
00:25:28.821 --> 00:25:32.090
that tradition and throw it out the fucking window and let you do it as you

411
00:25:32.091 --> 00:25:34.710
drive down the highway.
Um,

412
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.031
you know,

413
00:25:38.031 --> 00:25:42.240
recently I saw yoga instructor saying he was quitting it because like all of
the,

414
00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:47.600
it's been distilled down to just get in the fucking killer body,
you know,

415
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.730
anyways,
with thousands of scientific studies that show its positive effects,

416
00:25:52.731 --> 00:25:57.560
like improving focus and relationship harmony and decreasing anxiety and stress.

Join over 5 million users already getting some headspace man for free right now.

418
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.393
<v 4>MMM.</v>

419
00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.670
<v 0>I don't understand.
Well why I would need to be able to do it.
I guess.</v>

420
00:26:09.671 --> 00:26:10.840
What if I'm on the road?

421
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.330
<v 4>Okay.</v>

422
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.580
<v 0>And I'm in the quiet of my hotel room.
You know,</v>

423
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.070

440
00:27:20.011 --> 00:27:24.060
You know what I just realized the most arrogant thing you could ever do,

441
00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:28.740
you know is a rich person is your joint trunk club and that person has to go

442
00:27:28.741 --> 00:27:31.500
down the mall and some psycho goes down there,

443
00:27:31.501 --> 00:27:36.501
pulls out a gun and does one of those mass shootings and you still bitch that it

444
00:27:36.841 --> 00:27:38.610
took too long for the trunk to get there.

445
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.260
Even though that person went down there,

446
00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:43.200
which should have been you when they had to go down there and dodge the bullets.

447
00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.300
Oh,
I don't give a shit what happened.
Okay.

448
00:27:45.301 --> 00:27:49.770
I am going to bed tonight and I need my top seat out 2016 it's going to be a

449
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:50.604

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.700
the middle aged curmudgeon.

47 times two is 94 not a lot of people get to 94.

500
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.840
I'm an over the hill guy.
Who's kidding?
Who could,

501
00:31:06.841 --> 00:31:09.600
who could still bang out fucking 10 pull ups.
Huh?

502
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.430
He liked that Dash Dash Dash Dash.
Um,

503
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.970
what am I saying here?
Um,
I,
I,
yeah,
I'm,

504
00:31:19.971 --> 00:31:24.971
I'm one of these fucking people that I do not give it up to young people right

505
00:31:25.011 --> 00:31:28.190
out of the fucking gate.
I don't give a fuck how good a game you had.

506
00:31:28.191 --> 00:31:31.340
I don't give a fuck how good his season you have.
I want to see the career.

507
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:32.870
And you know,

508
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:37.780
that whole crown of king began somewhere at the beginning of shacks career that,

509
00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:38.870
that fucking,
you know,

510
00:31:38.871 --> 00:31:42.320
when you came into the league and you already had your own fucking sneaker,

511
00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.020
you know what I mean?
Um,

512
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:46.240
<v 6>yeah.</v>

513
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.540
<v 0>So I never give it up to people until like,
you know,</v>

514
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:52.780
people going to Tom Brady's the greatest of all time.
I still was going like,

515
00:31:52.781 --> 00:31:56.410
well,
Joe Montana has four rings and it only took them four times to get it.

516
00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:01.150
He won with nobody's,
he won with superstar teams.
All right.

517
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:02.853
So,

518
00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:03.970
<v 6>okay.</v>

519
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.370
<v 0>Until this guy does something above and beyond him,</v>

520
00:32:06.371 --> 00:32:11.170
the best he could do is be on his level.
I'm one of those guys,
having said that,

521
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:15.550
Steph curry is the greatest fucking shooter of all time.
I believe.

522
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.010
I already think that.
So I made it,
uh,

523
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:23.890
a promise as a sports fan that I was going to try and see him this year.
Um,

524
00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:24.641
well,
uh,

525
00:32:24.641 --> 00:32:28.930
see him as soon as I can while he's still fucking young and he's in his prime.

526
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.390
You know,
you gotta do that.
Like I saw Jordan when he still had hair,
you know,
so,

527
00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.260
um,

528
00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.090
it turns out I was hanging out at Lago last night doing a,

529
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:45.140
the great Tom Papa's show down there and Al Madrigal from all things comedy,

530
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.390
the creative force,
the brains,
the brawn behind all things comedy.

531
00:32:50.391 --> 00:32:51.740
He was down there and he's a,

532
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.390
he's a bay area guy and he watches every single golden state warriors game.

533
00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:01.040
And he said,
you know what,
he goes to the warriors are in town this Saturday.

534
00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:06.600
So I,
uh,
I woke up this morning by Dubai Bordeaux boob.
I went on Stubhub,

535
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:07.540
go do to do,
do it.

536
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:12.290
And I paid through the fucking nose for two fucking great seats.
Um,
yeah,

537
00:33:12.291 --> 00:33:14.300
I'm going to go Saturday night.
Fuck it.

538
00:33:14.301 --> 00:33:18.020
I gotta see this guy and I'm going to get there early for the shoot around.
So,

539
00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:21.680
cause I want to see him put on a show and I'm hearing people talking about how

540
00:33:21.681 --> 00:33:24.020
fucking unreal it's just to watch the guy shoot around.

541
00:33:24.021 --> 00:33:29.021
And it's reminding me of when I went to a San Diego Padres game back in May of

542
00:33:31.221 --> 00:33:35.990
1998 I remember me and this comedian dance Smith,

543
00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.320
now the Boston guy.
We went down there and it was,

544
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:43.280
we saw a mark McGwire and this is when they,
you know,

545
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:49.100
this is when they were,
uh,
you know,
going after the Roger Maris record,
you know,

546
00:33:49.101 --> 00:33:52.460
and everybody was having Andrew Steam delivered to their house and their wife's

547
00:33:52.461 --> 00:33:54.320
name.
I'm actually going to look it up.

548
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.830
I'm going to find you the exact fucking date.
San Diego Padres,

549
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.320
1998.

550
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:04.700
Schedule the fucking hilarious that this still exists.

551
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:09.170
That some who to fuck look this up today.
1998.

552
00:34:09.171 --> 00:34:12.530
San Diego Padres schedule.
I remember it was may 20 something.

553
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:18.150
Where the fuck was it?
It was a cat nose.
All right.

554
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.870
This is some fucking,
oh Jesus Christ.

555
00:34:22.871 --> 00:34:25.480
They had the games numbered rather than the date you fuck out there.

556
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:29.260
There's the date.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

557
00:34:29.261 --> 00:34:34.110
So sorry.
Come on.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Right.

558
00:34:34.111 --> 00:34:38.520
They're like
fuck yourself.
Five 29,

559
00:34:38.521 --> 00:34:43.521
1998 or five 30 or five 31 it wasn't June.

560
00:34:43.951 --> 00:34:45.010
I remember it wasn't June.

561
00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:50.040
I went to one of those fucking games against the Saint Louis cardinals and we

562
00:34:50.071 --> 00:34:54.120
got there early and we watched mark McGwire take batting practice.

563
00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.020
And um,
if there's any footage of that,

564
00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:02.760
if you could have been there and watched the performance this man put on and you

565
00:35:02.761 --> 00:35:05.970
still think that performance enhancing drugs should be illegal.

566
00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:10.320
You're out of your fucking mind.
These people are special.

567
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.040
These people are better than us.
Okay.

568
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:18.270
You know when you take a Prius to the fucking gas station,

569
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:19.830
do you put the fucking,

570
00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:25.250
the put premium super fucking the best gas.
You don't.

571
00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.260
You give it the shit gas,
right?

572
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:33.780
Did you pull up in a fucking supercar you give it to you put the best fuel in it

573
00:35:33.781 --> 00:35:36.960
that you can.
All right,
and you know what it is.

574
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:40.170
I don't think it sees athletes fall.
I think it's the people in the crowd.

575
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.120
We don't want to admit that.
Where'd you well,
you know we are,

576
00:35:42.121 --> 00:35:44.460
we're a bunch of Toyota Prius.
This what we are,

577
00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.900
bunch of Ford escorts and we deserved that shit food that they feed us and fuel

578
00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:52.771
our bodies with.

579
00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:56.340
As we sit there and just getting the hightest in the fifth inning from all the

580
00:35:56.341 --> 00:35:59.580
booze and fucking hot dogs,
you weight these fucking athletes.

581
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:02.100
They're better than us.
They're special.

582
00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:08.120
They need the high octane fuel and they should go out there and put on a fucking

583
00:36:08.121 --> 00:36:10.670
show and fill up our lives.

584
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:13.383
<v 5>Right.</v>

585
00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.860
<v 0>Anyways,
I'll tell you right now,</v>

586
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:20.890
I would rather watch a fucking roided up athlete take batting practice than

587
00:36:21.621 --> 00:36:25.790
watching all natural one breakdown at 35 and remind me that I'm going to die

588
00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.040
someday.
You know what I mean?
I want him to be superhuman.

589
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:31.950
I want their head to be three times this size.

590
00:36:31.951 --> 00:36:36.660
It was before they started their career that those people,

591
00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:39.510
they're heroes,
they using themselves as Guinea pigs.

592
00:36:39.511 --> 00:36:42.120
They put that shit in their body.
They didn't know what the fuck it was.

593
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:46.050
They didn't know what the fuck it was because they wanted to make you happy.

594
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:51.390
They wanted to hear you chair,
right?
They wanted to see a little kid go,

595
00:36:51.391 --> 00:36:53.700
boy,
oh boy,
this is the greatest time ever.

596
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.440
And then they wanted to go out and have their choice of pussy after the gape top

597
00:36:58.441 --> 00:37:02.970
shelf,
high octane,
fucking Victoria secret pussy.
And they,

598
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:06.010
God damn it,
they earned it
all right.

599
00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.890
You'd walk it around letting somebody shoot horse horse tranquilizers into your

600
00:37:09.891 --> 00:37:14.430
fucking ass,
you know?
And then what do you get?
What do you get?

601
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.990
What do you get to as a thank you.
You got to sit in front of the Senate.

602
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.070
They make you cry.

603
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.080
If I was running this nation,
no,
I,
this is where he got big day.

604
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.130
I loved that athletes,

605
00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:31.620
she used performance enhancing drugs and I hope they continue to do it because

606
00:37:31.621 --> 00:37:33.270
as much as people are condemning it,

607
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.840
we learned things by them using them and eventually they're going to figure out

608
00:37:36.841 --> 00:37:40.440
how to make them safe.
And when I'm old,
what?

609
00:37:40.441 --> 00:37:44.880
I'm old and you guys go to see me at a casino when I am 94 and I am fucking

610
00:37:44.881 --> 00:37:49.440
jacked with a full head of fucking hair.
You can thank the mark.
Mcguire's.

611
00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.530
Okay.
Deg To fucking die.
The other,

612
00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.710
whoever the fuck else took it.
I don't know where the fuck I,

613
00:37:56.711 --> 00:37:59.930
you know who gives a shit?
You could thank Peyton Manning's wife.

614
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:01.741
All right.

615
00:38:01.741 --> 00:38:05.100
If she didn't blow out her fucking shoulder taking those cookies out of the oven

616
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.350
and she didn't need that shit.
Goddammit.

617
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.930
Can somebody please make a picture of me at 94 Jack with a full head of hair

618
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.340
wearing a Tuxedo,
playing the stardust,
cheering on the Vegas.

619
00:38:17.341 --> 00:38:20.730
Gfe shut the fuck up hill.
All right,
that's the end of the podcast here.

620
00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:22.680
Everybody have a wonderful weekend.

621
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.830
I'm going to make a little video of my,

622
00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.840
my new door locks when I get them in there and I'll be excited about it and you

623
00:38:29.841 --> 00:38:34.090
guys can shit all over it because it's the internet.
All right?
Yeah.

624
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:35.120
Fuck you too

625
00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:01.460
<v 7>slowly
fill</v>

626
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.033
reason.

627
00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:17.760
Oh,
gone crazy.

628
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:25.680
Oh Man.

629
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.590
Last night

630
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.440
<v 1>I was sitting on the couch booboo to Lou due at nine in my own fucking business.</v>

631
00:39:35.441 --> 00:39:40.441
Ludo Ludo I was watching metal mania on VH one.

632
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.580
Metal Mania.
Cleo.

633
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:45.620
<v 3>Okay.</v>

634
00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.530
<v 1>I think my dog is sleeping with him with his eyes open.
Oh No,</v>

635
00:39:48.531 --> 00:39:49.580
she just moved her eyebrows.

636
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.820
<v 3>Okay.</v>

637
00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.230
<v 1>Do,
what the fuck did you just go?</v>

638
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:54.363
<v 3>Huh?</v>

639
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.310
<v 1>Cleo?
Whatever you're thinking about,
it's going to be okay.</v>

640
00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.233
<v 3>All right.</v>

641
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:04.720
<v 1>Anyways,
you know it's weird when my dog sees a squirrel through a window.</v>

642
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.530
If it cries
like,

643
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.670
like it's a long lost buddy.

644
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:16.750
But if my dog is outside and there's a squirrel,
you know,

645
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:20.230
if there's no window between my dog and the squirrel it,

646
00:40:20.231 --> 00:40:23.800
we'll try and rip his fucking head off so I don't,

647
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.830
does anybody know anything about dogs?
What is it crying about as it crying?
Like,

648
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:31.180
Ooh,
I want to rip its head off.
Oh,
I wish I could just end.

649
00:40:31.181 --> 00:40:32.380
That thing's fucking life.

650
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:33.900
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

651
00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.570
<v 1>You don't make any sense to me anyway.</v>

652
00:40:36.571 --> 00:40:40.620
So I'm watching fucking metal mania alliteration.

653
00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:45.570
This has gotta be a hit show,
right?
So I'm watching this shit and uh,

654
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.673
<v 3>yeah.</v>

655
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.620
<v 1>At the risk of pissing off a lot of listeners,</v>

656
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:55.450
I think most metal slash hair metal,

657
00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:00.610
it arguably is the worst fucking music ever made.

658
00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:06.130
Worst of disco.
I don't know why disco gets such a bad rap.
Like disco was the,

659
00:41:06.131 --> 00:41:10.780
is the default example of bad music.
The Way Hitler is,

660
00:41:10.781 --> 00:41:14.470
the default example of,
of evil duties.
The next Hitler,

661
00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:18.550
it's always the next fucking Hitler never pull pot.
You know,

662
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.730
never fucking,
I dunno,
picking up,
I don't even know another one.

663
00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.000
You know Ivan,
the terrible,
was that a wrestler?

664
00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:34.580
Was that a comic strip?
I know.
Horrible.
Haggar don't fucking know.
Right.
See,

665
00:41:34.581 --> 00:41:36.260
I don't even,
I don't even have any other examples.

666
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:37.450
<v 3>Okay.</v>

667
00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:40.180
<v 1>Whose fault is that?
Build is a library right down the street.</v>

668
00:41:40.181 --> 00:41:43.760
I'll go fuck yourself.
You know what I'm saying?
Um,

669
00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:50.250
everybody always talks about disco and how bad disco was and it just needs to be

670
00:41:50.251 --> 00:41:52.200
a change man.
Right.

671
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:57.230
And like then they'll talk about like the police and all this new wave shit and

672
00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:59.500
the punk scene and all that.

673
00:41:59.501 --> 00:42:04.501
But what they completely fucking ignore is that right after disco and it just

674
00:42:06.381 --> 00:42:11.381
immediately the mainstream then went over to like this fucking heavy metal music

675
00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.520
like that was better than disco.
I think it's fucking worse.

676
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:20.870
And I think all these times where they keep saying that everybody there was a

677
00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:25.310
big change and that this quality music came out.
I don't know if that happens.

678
00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:30.250
I think it just,
you know,
you know,
nirvana comes around and there,
what,

679
00:42:30.251 --> 00:42:34.540
four years later everybody's listening to fucking old town or the main stream
is,

680
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.500
it's just this long,
tragic,

681
00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.880
just flatline of shit music.
I was watching the shit last night,

682
00:42:43.881 --> 00:42:47.510
shit that I used to like and my jaw was on the ground.
How fucking bad it was.

683
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.620
It was horrible.
I,
I actually,
I was so bad.

684
00:42:51.621 --> 00:42:54.770
I was like texting paragraphs to the sensation.

685
00:42:54.771 --> 00:42:59.150
Joe Derosa capitol records.
The guy who built capital records.

686
00:42:59.151 --> 00:43:01.900
Joe Rosa,
I'll actually,
you go,
well,
I'll,

687
00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.820
I'll get a little intimate here with you.
I'll,
I'll read you the text message.

688
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:09.980
I've fucking wrote Joe.
Uh,
Joe,
where the hell are we here?
Where the hell are we?

689
00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:15.130
Joe?
Hair slash heavy metal is the worst music ever made.

690
00:43:15.131 --> 00:43:19.600
Disco gets a bad rap watching metal mania on VH one.

691
00:43:19.601 --> 00:43:23.560
Guns and roses.
Queens,
Rick Wasp.
Quiet riot.

692
00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.940
David Lee Roth Solo Shit.
It's fucking God awful.
Yeah.

693
00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:32.510
I saw David Lee Roth on,
on his,
uh,

694
00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:36.870
Itam and smile tour and I saw that video last night.

695
00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.030
Go wing crazy day

696
00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:42.000
<v 8>from day.
He,</v>

697
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:48.800
<v 1>that sounds like a song Wahlberg's character would have written with John C.</v>

698
00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:51.510
Reilly and Boogie nights.
Remember that?

699
00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:52.540
<v 3>Okay,</v>

700
00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.210
<v 8>he will rock you</v>

701
00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:00.290
<v 1>and we'll whoa.
You like it was,
it was that bad</v>

702
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:06.750
teenage Frankenstein.
I'm a teenage package died.

703
00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:11.130
You're telling me that that song is better than more than a woman?

704
00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:22.120
You know,
I,
I think arguably it's,
I dunno,

705
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:25.420
I can't believe the shit that I used to watch.

706
00:44:25.421 --> 00:44:29.320
And like I used to listen to this shit around checks,

707
00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.940
you know,
just hopelessly thinking that this would get me laid.

708
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:35.880
Like they would think that I was some Badass like loner.

709
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:37.410
<v 6>Okay.</v>

710
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:38.410
<v 1>Bag your</v>

711
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.400
<v 6>yeah.</v>

712
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:45.390
<v 1>I mean the whole fucking,
the fact that I never got laid in high school,</v>

713
00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:48.600
it just fuck it went away right in that moment.
It was like,

714
00:44:48.601 --> 00:44:52.140
this is what I was going to do.
I wasn't going to try to make them laugh.

715
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:54.810
I wasn't going to hit on him.
I wasn't going to try it.

716
00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:00.030
I was just going to play this music around them and this was going to bring me

717
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:01.470
to the fucking promise land,

718
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:06.690
looking like a fucking teenage Ron Howard.
That was my game plan.

719
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.310
Is it any wonder I failed Jesus Christ?
And I remember I would be watching it

720
00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:17.690
on a big square TV.
Um,
just watch it,

721
00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:22.740
lay it damn fuck horrific fucking music.

722
00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:29.030
And my dad would come in and just have his face would just be all twisted up,

723
00:45:29.031 --> 00:45:32.420
gone.
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck you listen to you like this shit.

724
00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:38.630
And I thought I was a rebel,
Amit.
He doesn't know.
Understand man.

725
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:42.290
You know what?
He totally understood.
He totally understood.

726
00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:48.100
My Dad called it back in [inaudible] 83 called it jungle music,

727
00:45:48.591 --> 00:45:49.640
says a bunch of shit.

728
00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:54.860
Told me straight up gay man.
He was like,
son,

729
00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.950
this music you're listening to is fucking horrible.

730
00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.130
And there was all these shout at the devil.

731
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:06.150
Is anybody really going to sit there and defend that fucking song?
Doodoo delay

732
00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:12.420
<v 9>Du du,
Du Du,
Du Du,
Du,</v>

733
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:14.730
Du du Du du Du du Du du Du

734
00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:18.830
<v 1>can find you could fucking a five year old could write that on a xylophone.</v>

735
00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:24.590
Shout at the devil.
Never knew why we were shouting,
you know,

736
00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.440
blacking lawless,
laggy,
lawless,
that was his show named Eddie.

737
00:46:29.441 --> 00:46:34.150
He took a radial arm saw and cut the blade in half and put one hat,
one blade,
uh,

738
00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:38.140
one of his forearms at one or the other on these leather.
Uh,

739
00:46:38.141 --> 00:46:41.650
I'm gonna do a bunch of dishes in an evil way.
Gloves.

740
00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:46.270
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

741
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:47.820
<v 1>Oh,
we all thought it was crazy.</v>

742
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.630
Can you imagine if we gave you a forearm shiver?

743
00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:57.210
It was just Eddie used to throw fucking raw meat.
Go to the crowd.

744
00:46:57.211 --> 00:46:57.961
A couple of them did.

745
00:46:57.961 --> 00:47:01.860
That's why that lady Gaga covering or clam and that fucking Pastrami,

746
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:06.960
it's just been done,
you know,
comes out in a fucking egg from Mork.

747
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:10.410
I Dunno.
Same.

748
00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:13.230
The nasally horror act my whole fucking life.

749
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:17.730
You know those fucking checks with the big noses.
They can,
you know,

750
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.110
that's like white people's answer to the big black girl who can sing at church.

751
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.390
We,
we,
what,
what the,
what the check we bring to that fight is the,

752
00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:30.440
the white chick with the big nose white chicks with big noses can sing.

753
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:34.050
I don't know what it is.
Barbara Streisand.
Yes.

754
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:40.660
Right.
I don't know.
It's like their nose is,

755
00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:45.950
it's like that dome at the top of all those con con,
uh,
concert halls.

756
00:47:45.951 --> 00:47:50.850
There you go,
Bill.
Try to spit it out.
You dumb fuck.
But,
um,

757
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:55.430
I want some emails,
people,
I want people try to tell me

758
00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:02.210
how a rowdy crowd by Vida Wigan.

759
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:05.580
Damn.
It'd be,

760
00:48:05.581 --> 00:48:10.581
tell me the musical validity that that has over like disco,

761
00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:17.130
that all those people probably had Comiskey plaque when they blew up those disco

762
00:48:17.131 --> 00:48:20.730
records like fucking five,
six years later.
That's what they were listening to.

763
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:23.040
<v 3>Okay.
Nope.</v>

764
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:34.150
<v 1>That was a hit.
That was a hit in the 80s</v>

765
00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:43.160
wow.
Do I owe my dad and apology?

766
00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:48.620
I just,
I was sitting there just one video after the queen's Reich.
I mean,

767
00:48:48.621 --> 00:48:53.270
all this stuff that I thought was just fucking unbelievable.
You know what?

768
00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.060
I'm going to get emails this week.
It's like,

769
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:58.860
I don't know what it's going to be.

770
00:48:58.861 --> 00:49:01.470
It's going to be like people either going to be like,
yes,

771
00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.990
absolutely is this is going to be,
there's going to be no middle ground.

772
00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:07.920
He wasn't going to 100% agree with me or a,

773
00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.200
I'm going to get punched in the face by Eddie trunk.

774
00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:17.610
I just,
I was taken aback.
I mean,

775
00:49:17.611 --> 00:49:20.910
I haven't seen those videos and fucking forever ks.
You.

776
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:23.370
I'll go back and I'll look at some old videos,
but I mean,

777
00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:26.640
a lot of it was like ACDC,
like shit.
They can like,

778
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:31.860
you know me back in black is timeless.
There's some timeless shit in there.

779
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:37.320
You know?
I even watched that guns and roses,
sweet child of mine,
and I thought,

780
00:49:37.321 --> 00:49:38.220
I thought it was horrible.

781
00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:39.793
<v 10>Well,</v>

782
00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:47.600
<v 1>and that little fucking Shim Sham dance he was doing was,</v>

783
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.850
oh,
and then the emotion he tried to have in the end.

784
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:52.733
<v 10>Wow.</v>

785
00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.140
<v 1>All right.
And they kind of closed his eyes like,
ah,</v>

786
00:49:58.141 --> 00:50:01.410
I really went somewhere when I've,
I was just fucking horrible.

787
00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:06.400
You know,
I was right down.
I help hold it up.
Oh,

788
00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:11.250
Def Leppard pause should rob me.
I hated that when that fucking came out.

789
00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:16.470
And all the ladies liked it and he came out in his acid washed jeans.

790
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.060
I actually saw him on that tour.

791
00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:19.690
<v 3>Okay.</v>

792
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:24.280
<v 1>Deny.
Yeah.
Reynolds' Coliseum in Tesla opened up Tessa,</v>

793
00:50:24.281 --> 00:50:26.690
which I didn't think they were that bed.
They weren't that bad.

794
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:29.533
I don't know.

795
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:33.680
I thought you're supposed to go back and listen to the fucking music of,
uh,

796
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:37.580
of your youth being like,
wow,
that stuff was all,
that was awesome,
man.

797
00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:41.750
Remember that?
And then,
you know,
that was the first time I tried blow,
you know,

798
00:50:41.751 --> 00:50:45.830
reminiscent
actually first time I ever saw cocaine,

799
00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:47.493
uh,

800
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:51.680
saw it and saw it being done was a,

801
00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:56.210
at the providence civic center.
I saw ACDC on the who made,

802
00:50:56.211 --> 00:50:57.830
who tore with loudness,

803
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.520
the Japanese heavy metal band that couldn't speak any English yet,

804
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:04.250
sang in English.
Um,

805
00:51:04.251 --> 00:51:06.600
I just can't imagine the disconnect as she's,

806
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:11.180
I can't imagine like memorizing a bunch of Japanese and going in over there and

807
00:51:11.181 --> 00:51:12.720
just singing it and then not knowing,
uh,

808
00:51:12.721 --> 00:51:15.530
what the fuck I was saying going out there

809
00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:18.573
and everybody

810
00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:23.030
like I have no idea what I just said.

811
00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:27.470
Tee Shirts at 20 bucks.
Did I just say that or did I say,
are you ready to rock?

812
00:51:27.471 --> 00:51:32.120
I have no fucking idea.
Um,
anyways,

813
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:36.680
so I saw them,
they opened up and uh,

814
00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.210
anyways,
we're out in the parking lot and we're drinking beer stick.

815
00:51:40.211 --> 00:51:42.980
You work crazy driving of course,

816
00:51:42.981 --> 00:51:46.010
cause it's the eighties this is right around before,

817
00:51:46.011 --> 00:51:49.790
right before mad kicked in and they used to bring like wreckage from a fatal

818
00:51:49.791 --> 00:51:52.490
drunk driving accident.
Anybody else's highschool do that?

819
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.180
They actually brought a car from a fatal drunk driving

820
00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:02.420
accident and they dragged in onto the lawn of our campus.

821
00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:05.720
You want to call it a campus?
A little island with the tree.

822
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.550
They just left it there.

823
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:11.090
And we all just stared at it trying to figure out how many people were in the

824
00:52:11.091 --> 00:52:14.690
car,
how many people died.
And then we just walked away.
Like,

825
00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.400
you know when you're young,
you don't give a fuck.

826
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:20.300
10 minutes later you're talking about,
dude,
I can't fucking wreck tonight.
Rat.

827
00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:25.490
That was the word.
Get wrapped.
Kittens destroyed Hammond,
right?
So anyways,

828
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:31.720
the driving down their beer between your legs as you do see eighties you know

829
00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:37.490
you fucking lifted weights all that week.
Never all of it above the waist.

830
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:41.690
Curls.
Fucking Bension shoulders.

831
00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.750
Nobody did squats in the 80s nobody did.
Right?

832
00:52:44.751 --> 00:52:48.440
So you got your fucking tight five oh one blues on with the Little Pencil

833
00:52:48.441 --> 00:52:50.960
fucking legs.
Then you overdeveloped upper body,

834
00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:55.280
you stupid gold chain and a,
he had a beer between your legs.

835
00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:57.560
That's how he did it.
So we're fucking going down.

836
00:52:57.561 --> 00:53:02.020
There were probably on eight a piece fucking hammered.
Uh,

837
00:53:02.021 --> 00:53:04.670
I was driving this piece of shit,
83 Ford Ranger.

838
00:53:04.671 --> 00:53:07.760
I got like five fucking drunk friends in the back,

839
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:10.310
which was still not even grounds for getting pulled over.

840
00:53:10.311 --> 00:53:14.060
You could just have people in the back like you were bringing fucking turkeys

841
00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:16.220
off to slaughter.
Nobody gave a shit.
Right?

842
00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:21.650
So we pull in and right as I pulled up and it got a parking spot,

843
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:23.450
there was this kid,

844
00:53:23.451 --> 00:53:28.290
he had his door open and he kinda had like a Sammy Hagar meets John Fogarty

845
00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:29.580
haircut blonde hair.

846
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:33.990
And I remember he fucking did align right as I was pulling up.

847
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:38.790
And I fortunately had my window up and he saw me and he saw,

848
00:53:38.791 --> 00:53:43.320
we all had ACDC tee shirts on or whatever and he just got to the cow.

849
00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:44.163
It's just so

850
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:50.190
it's like a haunted house right up to the fucking window.

851
00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:54.000
And I was just trying to take it all in like,
okay,
he just,

852
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:58.110
how am I supposed to behave around somebody with,
with WHO's on coke?

853
00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:01.080
Does this guy have like,
you know,
Hulk Strength Right now?

854
00:54:01.081 --> 00:54:05.490
Is he going to tip over the truck?
Um,
anyway,
so that was the,

855
00:54:05.491 --> 00:54:09.120
Fred was the first time I saw blow.
I didn't know what the point of all that was.

856
00:54:09.121 --> 00:54:13.530
I was just shocked.
Look,
I know it wasn't all bad.

857
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:18.480
Like the steam early Metallica,
you know,
right through and justice for all.

858
00:54:18.481 --> 00:54:21.810
I know that that stuff was great,
but uh,

859
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:25.800
I'll tell you it is slim.
Fucking pickings.
My friends,

860
00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:27.480
slim pickings.

861
00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:31.413
<v 4>Ah,</v>

862
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.480
<v 1>I don't even,
I didn't know what to tell you.</v>

863
00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:35.683
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

864
00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.920
<v 1>I mean I even go back sometimes I try to listen to appetite for destruction.</v>

865
00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:39.760
I know that's this,

866
00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:43.630
this watershed fucking moment in that music with some of those fucking songs

867
00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:49.120
<v 8>they are out to get me.
So you can stop me.</v>

868
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:54.110
<v 1>Take that one to heart.
Kill yourself.</v>

869
00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:59.000
Um,
all right.
That didn't get me a lot of fucking criticism.

870
00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:00.870
<v 4>Okay.</v>

871
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:03.750
<v 1>The 1980s,
they'll fuck it.</v>

872
00:55:03.751 --> 00:55:08.430
80 did I nail it though?
By the way?
Everyone had the five o one blues.

873
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:12.540
Remember that button fly dude,
I watched him three times and you're nuts.

874
00:55:12.541 --> 00:55:14.790
Couldn't breathe.
You know,

875
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:17.700
and you wonder why you've got all these fucking crazy kids that need to be on

876
00:55:17.701 --> 00:55:19.230
drugs now.
Hey,

877
00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:24.150
what is worse hair metal or some of that fucking patriotic country music post

878
00:55:24.151 --> 00:55:28.510
nine 11.
What is worse to you?
What is more cringe worthy?

879
00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:31.190
<v 4>You know,
um,</v>

880
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:36.280
<v 1>shout at the devil or that,
that Toby Keith,</v>

881
00:55:36.281 --> 00:55:39.430
Uncle Sam's going to put a boot in your ass.

882
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:43.870
<v 4>Ugh.
Um,
oh my God.</v>

883
00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:49.330
<v 1>Every dime that guy made in that song should've been thrown in his face and then</v>

884
00:55:49.331 --> 00:55:53.200
give it to the troops or something else or just,
and then the,

885
00:55:53.201 --> 00:55:57.820
on the then a partial of it would be to incinerate any record that,
that,

886
00:55:57.821 --> 00:55:59.830
that track was ever recorded.

887
00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:04.180
The most pandering horseshit you could ever come out with,

888
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.860
open and Piss you guys off too much by fucking trash and all that metal shit.

889
00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:12.100
You know?
I have half those t shirts and I went to go see that.

890
00:56:12.101 --> 00:56:16.150
I was just embarrassed by some of that shit that I used to listen to.
Um,

891
00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:17.950
<v 4>okay.</v>

892
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:22.320
<v 1>Oh Jesus.
Right up until I was like 2021 fucking brutal.
What,
what,
what,</v>

893
00:56:22.321 --> 00:56:24.040
what redeemable that I have.

894
00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:25.630
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

895
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:28.750
<v 1>I did listen to the Beatles,
the doors to stones,
all that white boy shit.</v>

896
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:31.600
Stevie Ray Vaughan.
I did listen to Hendrix.

897
00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:36.690
I listen to all the big band swing through my dad shift from the fifties.

898
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:38.450
<v 7>Okay.</v>

899
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:40.910
<v 1>Uh,
I had such a weird musical upbringing anyways,</v>

900
00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.250
which was actually good because it was kind of all over the map.

901
00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:45.320
<v 4>MMM.</v>

902
00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:47.600
<v 1>I started hanging out with Patrice back in the day.</v>

903
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:51.290
Patrice was the one rest his soul got me the,
uh,

904
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:53.130
<v 7>okay.</v>

905
00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:56.310
<v 1>I still remember when he got in at that same piece of shit truck that I went to</v>

906
00:56:56.311 --> 00:57:01.140
the ACDC concert in seven fucking years later.
I'm still driving it.
Right.

907
00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:04.650
Making the sacrifices.
Remember that I told you,

908
00:57:04.651 --> 00:57:07.980
you don't get some fucking job and go out and buy a fucking new car.

909
00:57:07.981 --> 00:57:10.500
You just change yourself to your cubicle.
I was kept Mike,

910
00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:12.360
I put a new engine in the fucking truck,

911
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:15.360
had somebody slap that in there for 1200 bucks,

912
00:57:15.361 --> 00:57:19.710
pay that down rather than 12 grand for a new car like it was back then.
Um,

913
00:57:19.711 --> 00:57:21.030
so anyways,
I still remember

914
00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:23.243
<v 4>mmm.</v>

915
00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.230
<v 1>Swinging by picking Patrice up and going into next,</v>

916
00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:30.650
and he had the cassette tape of re ready to die.

917
00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:32.180
<v 7>Okay.</v>

918
00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:33.380
<v 1>And him putting that in.</v>

919
00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:34.550
<v 7>Okay.</v>

920
00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:37.760
<v 1>Um,
telling me that this guy was going to be the next guy.</v>

921
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.880
<v 7>Okay.</v>

922
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.260
<v 1>And then through all of that,</v>

923
00:57:40.261 --> 00:57:45.261
like he cured me of all the rap that a white kid liked who lived in a cul de

924
00:57:46.131 --> 00:57:46.964
sac.

925
00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:48.953
<v 4>MMM.</v>

926
00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:53.650
<v 1>And he showed me all the,
all of that shit.
So I had that whole background,</v>

927
00:57:53.651 --> 00:57:58.060
all that stuff fucking held up.
But the fucking metals that I listened to,

928
00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:00.970
I even watch like Lawrence Welk when I was a kid,

929
00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:05.950
when the creepiest shows ever even that was fucking thrown in there.

930
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:07.320
<v 7>Okay.</v>

931
00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:07.861
<v 1>It's funny,</v>

932
00:58:07.861 --> 00:58:11.220
like fucking almost 40 years later I'll be walking down the street and all of a

933
00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:12.840
sudden Winchester cathedral,

934
00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:18.290
we'll be going through my head when Chester Cathedral Bodo Doda do yell Brang

935
00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:24.030
and made down,
am I really going to sing this?
You could have done something.

936
00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:43.843
<v 7>Wow.</v>

937
00:58:58.340 --> 00:58:59.840
<v 1>Oh my God.
Here's one for you guys.
Uh,</v>

938
00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:03.500
my boyfriend wants to have his for skin restored.
By the way,

939
00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:07.220
how fresh and new are these,
uh,
these emails here,

940
00:59:07.221 --> 00:59:10.760
just because it's coming from the female perspective.
I love this shit.
All right.

941
00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:13.020
That's saying they don't want guys to email him,
but I,

942
00:59:13.021 --> 00:59:17.060
I would like to have a nice balance here.
I already say enough shit.

943
00:59:17.061 --> 00:59:22.010
Trash and women.
So it helps if women come in trash and guys,
because,
uh,

944
00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:26.240
I,
you know,
it'll,
it'll be a nice balance here.
All right.

945
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:29.780
My boyfriend wants to have his for skin restored.
Dear bill,

946
00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:34.420
I wanted to get your take on the situation I'm in with my current boyfriend.
Uh,

947
00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:36.890
I'm a girl.
All right.
A few weeks ago,

948
00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:41.750
my boyfriend of two years told me that he's become totally upset that he

949
00:59:41.751 --> 00:59:46.751
circumcised and wants to restore his for skin via taping and stretching methods.

950
00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:50.953
What,

951
00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:57.430
and basically why he wants to do this is because everybody,
they say that,
um,

952
00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:02.320
intercourse you,
you lose like,
I dunno,
some percentage of sensitivity

953
01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:06.410
when you have your forced skin removed and um,

954
01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:07.630
<v 9>yeah,</v>

955
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:12.340
<v 1>all I can say is no guy can tell the difference whether he has a four skin or</v>

956
01:00:12.341 --> 01:00:13.174
whether he doesn't.

957
01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:17.140
Because unless you got laid when you were fucking six weeks old,

958
01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.660
you don't know what you're gaining or what you're missing.

959
01:00:19.661 --> 01:00:21.610
So I don't understand why you would do this.

960
01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:27.190
So t by restore has forced came via taping and stretching methods.
She goes,

961
01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:31.240
I know,
I know.
It makes me want to throw up just thinking about it.

962
01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:36.580
I wanted to tell him,
I think he's out of his mind.
Uh,

963
01:00:36.581 --> 01:00:39.070
but I don't want to hurt his feelings.
The thing is,

964
01:00:39.071 --> 01:00:44.071
I'm totally grossed out by the idea of for skin penises are gross enough

965
01:00:45.881 --> 01:00:50.260
already.
There's no need to make it even grosser.
Um,
you know,

966
01:00:50.261 --> 01:00:52.840
what am I the only guy that totally agrees with that?

967
01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:58.140
Is there anything more fucking disgusting then I'll fucking flacid for skin

968
01:00:58.961 --> 01:00:59.800
covered Dick.

969
01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.360
I didn't know what it looks like.

970
01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:06.270
<v 9>Okay.</v>

971
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:10.150
<v 1>It looks like a fucking,
I don't know what it looks like.</v>

972
01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:17.400
I,
it's,
it's just fucking disgusting.
I don't even have like a reference.

973
01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:19.300
<v 9>Okay.</v>

974
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.580
<v 1>Oh,
sorry.
Going to elephant Dick.
I got,
I don't even know what to say.</v>

975
01:01:21.581 --> 01:01:25.390
It's just gross.
It's fucking disgusting.
Um,

976
01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:29.020
she goes,
obviously I can't tell him how I feel.

977
01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:31.930
He's clearly having a really hard time with this.

978
01:01:31.931 --> 01:01:34.900
He tells me that he feels violated and disfigured.

979
01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:37.870
This guy's a pussy.
This,
throw this,

980
01:01:37.871 --> 01:01:40.900
throw this guy into the fucking pussy band and get on with your life.

981
01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:45.190
He also claims that for skins has a lot of advantage for both partners,

982
01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:50.520
but it's hard for me to totally buy that considering the fact I have slept with

983
01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.510
a couple uncircumcised guy and I didn't notice any extra pleasure.

984
01:01:55.810 --> 01:02:00.010
Although I did use a condom with both guys.
Yeah,

985
01:02:00.011 --> 01:02:04.000
he's full of Shit.
He's full of Shit.
It may be more pleasure for him.

986
01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.770
I don't know what I mean.

987
01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.710
I think it's amazing that women will put a dick in their mouths.

988
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:12.340
You know the least she can do is try and tidy up down there.
You know?

989
01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:14.830
How about happened?
Fucking empathy.

990
01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.533
<v 9>Okay.</v>

991
01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:21.060
<v 1>I've asked you this discussed.
It's just fucking extra skin.
Yeah.</v>

992
01:02:21.061 --> 01:02:25.440
Nothing more sexy or then extra skin.
Yeah.
Yeah.

993
01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:28.800
It's like your Dick used to be obese and then lost a ton of weight but didn't

994
01:02:28.801 --> 01:02:30.960
have enough money to have that surgery.

995
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.940
They get rid of the extra and it's gross.

996
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.220
There's another two paragraphs,

997
01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:42.480
people just just preparing you for another two paragraphs of having an

998
01:02:42.481 --> 01:02:47.190
uncircumcised stretch tape dick in your head.
Anyway,

999
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:51.570
I think it's absolutely disgusting and totally weird that he wants to do this

1000
01:02:51.571 --> 01:02:55.440
and I'm starting to get really turned off by the idea of sleeping with him while

1001
01:02:55.441 --> 01:02:57.210
he's stretching out.
As for skin,

1002
01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:02.370
he told me he's going to tape it to when elastic strap,

1003
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:05.130
which is going to tie around his leg.

1004
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:08.400
I know what the fuck is he just coming up with this shit on his own.

1005
01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:10.710
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1006
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:13.440
<v 1>I told him that he should see a doctor before he starts to do this,</v>

1007
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:14.274
but he doesn't want,

1008
01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:18.300
but he doesn't think that doctors know much about this sort of thing.
Oh,

1009
01:03:18.301 --> 01:03:22.710
so he's just going to take it in his own hands.
Congratulations sweetheart.

1010
01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.360
You're dating a fucking moron.

1011
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:27.063
<v 9>Yeah,</v>

1012
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.140
<v 1>come on.
This is the father.
You had children?</v>

1013
01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:31.600
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1014
01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.660
<v 1>Coming up with,
you know,
taking an erector set to his fucking Dick.</v>

1015
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:39.430
It was he this.
Do I have to finish reading this?

1016
01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.900
I'm thinking of breaking it off with them.
Really.
Course you are.

1017
01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.940
I thought he was a normal guy,

1018
01:03:46.941 --> 01:03:50.690
but I had no idea he had all this freaky shit going on underneath the surface.

1019
01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:53.840
Anyways.
What do you think about all of this?

1020
01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:56.210
You got to go ll cool j

1021
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:01.250
got to do what he did.

1022
01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:03.443
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1023
01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:07.900
<v 1>You stretching out your fucking Dick.
I know.
I said I'd be true.</v>

1024
01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:12.850
You're stretching out your fucking Dick,
so I'm leaving you go fuck yourself.

1025
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:17.530
It's over.
Yeah.
Fucking gross.

1026
01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:18.791
Anyway,

1027
01:04:18.791 --> 01:04:22.600
what do you think all this is my justify dumping him away or would that make me

1028
01:04:22.601 --> 01:04:26.710
an insensitive comment?
No,
it would make you a strong person.

1029
01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:32.080
All right?
Go with your gut on this one.

1030
01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:38.230
This guy is trying to,
to do the impossible,
like,

1031
01:04:38.231 --> 01:04:41.200
uh,
like he said,
fucking scientists and that Michael j,

1032
01:04:41.201 --> 01:04:45.400
Fox movie back to the future.
He's basically,

1033
01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:46.630
you know,

1034
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:50.860
doing the Delorean bullshit with his Dick and he doesn't want to go see a
doctor.

1035
01:04:50.861 --> 01:04:53.350
Any doctor would tell him,
you can't do that.

1036
01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:54.660
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1037
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.810
<v 1>You'll be funny.
That was if you dumped this guy right,
and it actually works.</v>

1038
01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:01.930
And then he starts screaming like Billy Mays on TV with his,

1039
01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.520
his Dick Stretcher.
Then he sells it for 1995.

1040
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:10.380
It makes a zillion dollar.
I'm just playing devil's advocate here,
you know?

1041
01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:12.390
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1042
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:15.390
<v 1>There's a 99% chance you're doing the right thing,</v>

1043
01:05:15.391 --> 01:05:19.070
but there is a 1% chance you could be walking away from a,

1044
01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:23.920
a potential millionaire.
Cause I gotta be honest with you,
if,

1045
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:27.160
if that guy actually pulls this off,
no pun intended,

1046
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:28.960
he pulls this off,

1047
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.230
<v 9>okay.</v>

1048
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:33.770
<v 1>And he's able to do it with some household material.
And then he,</v>

1049
01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:37.750
you know,
Pete,
they already make millions of dollars with those,

1050
01:05:37.751 --> 01:05:40.540
those pills that say they're going to make your Dick Bigger,

1051
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:44.170
which we all know it doesn't work because of it fucking work.

1052
01:05:44.171 --> 01:05:47.680
That would be an international story and um,

1053
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:51.070
and then it still wouldn't work because then what would happen was everybody

1054
01:05:51.071 --> 01:05:52.450
would take big dick pills,

1055
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:56.320
even guys with big dicks because they don't want everybody else catching up with

1056
01:05:56.321 --> 01:05:56.800
them.

1057
01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:01.800
So then having a little dick would then be like having a six inch dick as

1058
01:06:02.141 --> 01:06:04.240
opposed to a three inch,
four inch Dick.
Right.

1059
01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:09.220
It's a math workout on that or get bumped up.
You've got to six,
seven inch Dick.

1060
01:06:09.221 --> 01:06:12.550
He just,
he just regular,
no,
you're actually not regularly.
Yeah,

1061
01:06:12.551 --> 01:06:13.420
you'd have a little Dick.

1062
01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:17.650
So if this guy actually fucking is able to pull this,

1063
01:06:17.651 --> 01:06:19.180
that doesn't even make sense.

1064
01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:22.383
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1065
01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:23.273
<v 1>He's going,
he,</v>

1066
01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:27.210
if he thought he was disfigured now wait till he tries to fucking do this.

1067
01:06:27.211 --> 01:06:29.490
I mean his dick is going to look like,

1068
01:06:29.491 --> 01:06:31.830
you know when those people put that shit their ear Lobes,

1069
01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:33.413
<v 9>okay?</v>

1070
01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:38.510
<v 1>They put those fucking,
um,
those circles,
circular things.</v>

1071
01:06:38.511 --> 01:06:42.670
You could shoot a God damn fucking bow and Arrow through somebody's ear lobe and

1072
01:06:42.671 --> 01:06:45.410
not draw any blood.
He's going to do that to his deck,

1073
01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:48.800
except he's not going to have that thing in there and it's just going to be

1074
01:06:48.801 --> 01:06:51.260
hanging out,
right?
Bill?
We got it.
It's disgusting,

1075
01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:10.030
<v 7>Eh?</v>

1076
01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:28.890
Oh,
whoa.

1077
01:07:58.290 --> 01:08:01.110
Underrated.
Overrated.

1078
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:03.980
Fucking voicemails leaving them as the most,
most

1079
01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:07.220
<v 1>awkward thing.
I've always said that I'm terrible at leaving them,</v>

1080
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:10.310
but whenever I say that,
everyone else,
whenever I say that,

1081
01:08:10.311 --> 01:08:15.080
everyone else always says it too.
So I'm putting my foot down on the issue,

1082
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.680
calling it right now,
leaving a message for someone on the phone sucks.

1083
01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:22.640
There's no way to start your message normally without sounding like a Douche.

1084
01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:25.790
And then five minutes later you realize you've been trailing on and on while

1085
01:08:25.791 --> 01:08:30.080
saying,
ah,
um,
too many times making you want to kill yourself,

1086
01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:32.990
ending with the inevitable.
A.
Okay,
thanks.

1087
01:08:32.991 --> 01:08:37.780
By reminding them that you're still a Douche.
Fucking awful dude.

1088
01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:41.720
This is something that's really like an epidemic in this young generation is

1089
01:08:41.721 --> 01:08:45.110
everybody just feeling awkward and feeling like a Douche.

1090
01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:50.120
I don't know what happened to you guys.
I think this last generation of fathers,

1091
01:08:50.121 --> 01:08:52.760
they flipped.
Like,
I'm not going to beat the shit out of my kid.

1092
01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:58.100
Not how them and never tell him that I,
that I,
that I love him.
Uh,
you know,

1093
01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:01.160
I'm going to do all of that shit and you end up with these people who can't even

1094
01:09:01.161 --> 01:09:03.560
fucking leave voicemails.

1095
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:07.880
What is so awkward?
You know,

1096
01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:13.410
I,
I,
you know what?
I have a hard time getting off the phone.
I forget.

1097
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:15.000
I forget what I used to say.

1098
01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.240
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1099
01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.260
<v 1>But I don't feel awkward.</v>

1100
01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:19.010
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1101
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:21.330
<v 1>Well,
I just feel like an idiot.
I guess.
So I guess I kind of relate.</v>

1102
01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:22.990
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1103
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:24.640
<v 1>I just go right.
That's it.
I'm Outta here.</v>

1104
01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.290
I will say that believe in a message.
I like leaving messages.

1105
01:09:32.291 --> 01:09:36.010
I sing on people's voicemails.
You know,

1106
01:09:36.011 --> 01:09:38.770
whenever I call up fucking Blob,
Yay.

1107
01:09:38.771 --> 01:09:43.210
Bobby Kelly or in fucking Joey roses.

1108
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:47.890
I call him up and I,
I'll just immediately,
I'll just,
whatever comes to my mind,

1109
01:09:47.891 --> 01:09:52.270
I'll just start singing.
Who's the con to that?
I love the most.

1110
01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:57.130
Who's that fucker?
Who eats the toes?
Did Joey,

1111
01:09:57.430 --> 01:10:02.320
he's such a big FHEG.
Derosa what's going on?

1112
01:10:02.321 --> 01:10:06.670
It's bill.
Give me a call back.
You can't click.
That's it.

1113
01:10:06.730 --> 01:10:10.000
Why don't you try singing?
You can do it for anybody.

1114
01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:16.360
Hey Mom,
what's up you sweetie?
Thanks for having me.

1115
01:10:16.361 --> 01:10:20.950
40 years ago I sent you some flowers.

1116
01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:22.210
You didn't call me.

1117
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:26.590
Do you like my siblings better than me?

1118
01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:30.680
Click right?
Why don't you do that?
Try that,
sir.

1119
01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:34.450
Try singing first.
Um,
all right.
Underrated.
Overrated.
Underrated.

1120
01:10:34.451 --> 01:10:38.320
Sitting Down to pee.
If you're a guy.
Uh,

1121
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:43.623
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1122
01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:47.270
<v 1>Is it that,
how old are you?
Is it that hard to stand up?</v>

1123
01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:49.210
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1124
01:10:49.210 --> 01:10:53.320
<v 1>What is wrong with this fucking generation of guys?
You Know,</v>

1125
01:10:53.321 --> 01:10:54.490
Sitting Down To pee,

1126
01:10:54.491 --> 01:10:58.430
it's actually easier and you don't get varicose veins from all those years of

1127
01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:01.810
stay.
There's nothing better than just pulling out your Dick.

1128
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.640
It just fucking pee and all over everything.
You know,

1129
01:11:06.641 --> 01:11:11.480
you fucking shooting the toilet paper around.
It's fucking good time.
Um,

1130
01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.270
anyways,
it says guy who drives a fucking hybrid.
Um,
anyways,

1131
01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:18.150
there are many benefits to being a guy in sitting down to peace,

1132
01:11:18.151 --> 01:11:22.440
such as not having to hear your chick complain about peeing on the seat,

1133
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:27.470
even though it's on the fucking top of the bowl and it's not actually the seat.

1134
01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:29.310
Yup.
Here's a guy,

1135
01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.840
he's literally sitting down to pee,

1136
01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:37.680
so his girlfriend will stop yelling at him.
Okay.

1137
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:42.360
I don't know what happened.
People a hundred years ago,

1138
01:11:42.361 --> 01:11:45.180
we could hit them with mop handles and I don't know what happened.

1139
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:46.710
They got organized and we didn't,

1140
01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.670
and now we're sitting down to pee just so they'll stop yelling at us.

1141
01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:53.610
Um,
all right,
number two,
if you like me,

1142
01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:55.980
if you're like me and you wake up to pee at night,

1143
01:11:56.010 --> 01:12:00.300
you don't have to fuck with your eyes and turn on the bathroom lights to aim.

1144
01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:01.730
<v 7>Okay?</v>

1145
01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:03.500
<v 1>Oh Dude.
You take it all the fun out of it.</v>

1146
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:08.390
That's how you train your ear.
All right,

1147
01:12:08.391 --> 01:12:10.820
that sounds like the back of the ball.

1148
01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.830
Where's the water?
That's the floor.
There it is.

1149
01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:20.240
One small step number three,

1150
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:23.210
not bending down to lift up the seat out.
You know what,
dude?

1151
01:12:23.211 --> 01:12:24.530
You're a fucking pansy.

1152
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:28.970
Not Bending down to clean off to see less bending in general.

1153
01:12:28.971 --> 01:12:32.270
Why don't you just bend over and suck your own Dick is just sit on the bowl.

1154
01:12:32.271 --> 01:12:36.860
You fucking Douche.
Fuck that guy peeing sitting down.

1155
01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:41.630
Do you know
what else,
sir?
What?
What?
What else is overrated?

1156
01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:44.470
Lifting weights.
Um,

1157
01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:51.260
owning a gun.
Chewing tobacco.
Eating steak.
What else?

1158
01:12:51.261 --> 01:12:56.240
Drinking Scotch.
Smoking cigars.
Fixing your own car.
What?

1159
01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:58.320
What else?
Or what else is fucking overrated?

1160
01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:01.940
Everything that makes being a guy fucking awesome.
Losing your shit.

1161
01:13:01.941 --> 01:13:04.340
Because some guy you don't know Mr. Field Goal,

1162
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:09.920
that really has no effect on your life.
Talking Shit.
Is that all overrated?
Lee?

1163
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:10.783
Marvin's

1164
01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.220
the only thing that saved you surge.
You didn't leave your name.
So that,

1165
01:13:16.221 --> 01:13:19.370
that's the only thing that I can say is I can at least see that there was sort

1166
01:13:19.371 --> 01:13:23.360
of some,
some sort of shame in your email.

1167
01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:43.770
<v 7>[inaudible].</v>
