1
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.150
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.530
January 27th,
2014 out of what he doing.

3
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.150
Um,
I'm out here in Hawaii.

4
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.250
The day after the pro bowl,
I brought all my fucking,
I brought my mix,

5
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.400
I brought my chords,

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.300
I brought everything that I needed except for a God damn microphone so I can got

7
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:30.090
to do with this bootleg way,
um,

8
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.670
because my flight isn't until later.
And uh,

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.710
oh look who just walked in the lovely Nia.

10
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.790
I thought you're going to take a walk down the beach and you a little trip.

11
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.900
All right.
All right,
well hey,
you know,
don't let us stop you.

12
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.180
All right.
Enjoy yourself.
Alrighty.

13
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.540
So you that she walks down the Goddamn beach and I'm sitting here waving away,

14
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.710
which you hear a Goddamn.
Thank you.
No,
just keeping me at a great time out here.

15
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.740
Um,
but yeah,
our flight isn't until later on,
so

16
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.050
I got to do it now so I don't have a fucking microphone,
so I apologize.
Anyways,

17
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.850
I am out here in Hawaii.
I had a great time.
Um,

18
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.670
did a show Friday night and uh,

19
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.570
at this theater,
I remember the fucking thing,
the Hawaiian,

20
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:25.120
the Honolulu center or something like that.
It was really fucking cool,
man.

21
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:29.010
That was like a,
the Chinese New Year was going on right next door,

22
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:31.470
right down the street.
And it was fucking crazy.

23
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.120
It was this sort of this artsy cool and shady part of town and it was night and

24
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:41.040
they will lighten off those fireworks.
And uh,

25
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.730
I didn't know what it was at first and I'm like peeking around the corners,

26
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.560
several walking down the street go,
what the fuck is that?
And uh,

27
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.190
cause they will lighten off like those giant cakes of,
uh,

28
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.700
of firecrackers is a couple of,
you know,

29
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.150
Chinese dudes are walking around with the dragon outfit on night.

30
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.300
Was that offensive?
I don't give a fuck.
It's basically what I saw.
Um,

31
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.340
<v 1>trying to disrespect your fucking new years.
Um,</v>

32
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.250
and you know,
I grew up watching like platoon,
um,
what was the,

33
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.350
Whoa,
all those fucking movies there.
Uh,

34
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.280
what was missing in action?
All of that,

35
00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:24.340
which basically just,
it was,

36
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.400
I don't know why agents didn't complain more in the 80 some of the fucking

37
00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:31.750
movies and they made the way that they made you guys.

38
00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:35.320
And that's what's funny is that stuck in my head.
I didn't think it was,

39
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.851
I didn't think,

40
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:41.260
it wasn't until I heard gunpowder being lid off and I was in this part of town

41
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.800
that had all his,
you know,
Asian look and stuff.

42
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.370
All of a sudden I started feeling like,
Hey,

43
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:52.300
am I going to get stuck in a bamboo cage with some rats and then get dragged out

44
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.420
Mau,
Mau?
Is that going to happen?
Like I was literally feeling that,

45
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.660
which I know to speak it out loud is ridiculous.

46
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.880
I guess what I'm really doing here is I'm speaking about the power of the images

47
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.620
that we see on television and movies.
They're corrupting our children.

48
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.370
Um,
I guess maybe tip a Gore had a point.

49
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.920
So anyways,
I went down there.
Then once I saw what was going on,

50
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.280
it was cool as hell.
I got to,
uh,
I'll show,
I'll actually,

51
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:26.281
I'll post the video because the video is basically me gradually discovering what

52
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:30.370
it is.
I mean,
I kind of knew as I started to,
uh,
um,

53
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.180
walked down towards that.
I think somebody finally had told me and uh,

54
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.500
but it really looks like the beginning of either some,

55
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.393
uh,

56
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.470
Oscar winning movie or some really creepy youtube video that they're going to

57
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:45.250
take down soon.

58
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.980
It just looks like something fucked up is about ready to happen and it's

59
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:51.070
actually a celebration.
So if you ever go down there,

60
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.430
white people and black people,
you know,
like what,

61
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.370
you understand Asians better than us.
You just as confused as we are.

62
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.900
Get off your fucking I yours,

63
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.000
when you go down there and the dragons doing all the God damn thing,
you know,
um,

64
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.530
<v 0>you know,</v>

65
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.650
when it comes over to you stick money in its mouth and that's supposed to bring

66
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:12.460
you good luck.
I don't fucking know.
Whatever.
I participated,

67
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.960
I'm on my best behavior.
I'm in a different country out here in Hawaii.

68
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.220
I don't give a shit what they say that this is part of America at.
This is,
it is,

69
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:23.200
but it isn't.
You know what I mean?

70
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.550
This is clearly some shit that we took over where I will argue with the native

71
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.900
Americans,
um,
till the day I die about whether or not we stole the country.

72
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.450
Because I got to tell you,

73
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:42.451
I look around and I see all non native Americans in the continental United

74
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.640
States and everybody looks pretty comfortable.
You know,

75
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.690
they look like they fit in like they should be there.
All right?

76
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.360
So I swear to God,

77
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:55.360
if one more patchy comes up to me and starts talking about how we stole the

78
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.171
country,
it's just like,

79
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:59.620
well then why do I look so normal up against this oak tree?

80
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.683
Okay,

81
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.680
now you take those same white people and you stick them out here in Hawaii and

82
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:12.790
we just look like we're on vacation and people are,
no,
I live here.
No,

83
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:15.070
no you don't.
No you don't.
Something happened,

84
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.390
something happened and somebody lost an arm cause they couldn't find the shiny

85
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:19.990
shit.

86
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.990
And now you have a home with that person used to have a fucking hut or some sort

87
00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:28.870
of fucking thing that was made out of the ground and it was all natural,

88
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.080
right in the rivers were nice and clean and then we fucking showed up.

89
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.590
I thought it was a great moment yesterday of a,
the awfulness of,
uh,

90
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.920
the direction that we've had it in.
It's actually,
you know,
I'll fucking,

91
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:45.820
I'm sitting in and the upper deck of the pro bowl because I have connections

92
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:46.654
like that.

93
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.460
And that stadium used to be,
um,

94
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.480
it used to be one of those multi faceted stadiums would have multipurpose

95
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:03.350
stadiums where you played football and baseball there and you could like shift

96
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:06.260
around the stands and stuff like that and all this fucking crazy stuff.

97
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:09.080
So of course,
you know,
it rains out here,

98
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.010
there's all kinds of salt water in the air,
right?

99
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:16.120
So eventually everything rusts up and the thing can't fucking move anymore.

100
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.300
So basically they,
they welded permanently in the football position,

101
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.880
football position.
And,
um,

102
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.270
basically on each corner of the stadium,
whether it should be a corner,

103
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.230
you can actually look through and see out.
It's fucking hilarious.

104
00:06:32.231 --> 00:06:37.231
You could see all the way from the field to the outside parking lot to the

105
00:06:37.391 --> 00:06:38.620
houses in the hills,

106
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.000
all the way up to the mountains where it was all green and you just started at

107
00:06:43.001 --> 00:06:46.330
the top and when looked all the way down to the stadium or went the other way

108
00:06:46.331 --> 00:06:48.250
and you saw the,
uh,

109
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.480
the progress of us ruining this fucking paradise out here.

110
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.840
Um,
but having said that,

111
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.170
I actually went,
I'm going to argue,

112
00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:03.700
I went to the most exciting pro bowl in recent memory yesterday in case you

113
00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:08.050
missed it in case you weren't one of the 40 people will actually watch the

114
00:07:08.051 --> 00:07:11.230
fucking thing.
Um,
this year,

115
00:07:11.231 --> 00:07:14.320
what they did to try to add a little bit of excitement to try to get the

116
00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:18.580
competitive juices flowing so people would actually fucking play the game as

117
00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:20.140
opposed to playing patty cake,

118
00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:24.310
patty cake and fallen down on the ground when anybody was near you.
Um,

119
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.860
which I totally understand why the players do it.

120
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.580
I mean this game does not mean shit and they're basically,

121
00:07:30.581 --> 00:07:35.320
well do I want to keep making five to 10 million a year or do I want to risk

122
00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:40.300
that trying to score a touchdown in this fucking game?
That doesn't matter.
Um,

123
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.870
what they did was they had a,
they had two team captains.

124
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.270
They had Jerry Rice and Deion Sanders and both of them,

125
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:49.900
they actually had a draft and they,
you know,

126
00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:53.350
they pick the players and all that type of shit and it basically came down to

127
00:07:53.351 --> 00:07:56.140
the end.
And uh,
there was a minute,

128
00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.610
44 or 48 left,
most of the crowd had left.

129
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.380
Uh,
Tim Rice was down by seven.
And um,
I actually,

130
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.840
I'm not going to say I was drunk.
I was pretty,

131
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.370
I was feeling pretty good and I commentated the last minute,
44 weeks,

132
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.050
I got it all edited together in a video on the podcast page.
You got to watch it.

133
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.500
I'm not going to say what happens in case you missed the final outcome.

134
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.710
Maybe you can get excited,
get excited watching the video.

135
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:28.640
I think I did a pretty good job for being a little bit drunk,
you know,

136
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.210
and if you take out the curses,
I thought I held my own with a,
you know,

137
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:36.800
the gym lamp police up there.
I thought I'd done a nice job

138
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.440
by the way.
I also came out here.
I did a little something for I inside the NFL.

139
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.340
I did a little pro bono piece while I was out here and I got to talk to some of

140
00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:50.910
the play and um,
I got to uh,

141
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.060
check out the stadium and all that type of stuff.

142
00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:56.550
I'm not going to do any spoiling here,

143
00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:00.960
but it's going to air this week on,
inside of the NFL on Wednesday on showtime.

144
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.350
All right.
And if you don't have showtime,
why don't you go order it?

145
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.520
I'll go find a friend that has it.
Um,
it was an unbelievable,

146
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:14.040
unbelievable week.
Uh,
yeah,
it was supposed to fucking nuts.

147
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.830
I don't know how to explain it.
Put it this way.
At one point,

148
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:21.780
I was actually up in the broadcast booth before the game and I got to interview

149
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.520
Chris Collins Worth in Al Michaels and it was just the greatest,

150
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:29.250
funniest guys and all that type of stuff.
And it just was a,

151
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.110
I was fucking awesome course.
I talked to Al Michaels about hockey.

152
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.030
Why wouldn't I,
you know,

153
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.090
and he had the exact opposite views I had on a lot of this stuff,

154
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.050
which was crushing me.
I want him to be like,
yes,
yes.
And he was just like,
no,
no,

155
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.060
I feel a B and c.
He's like,
no,
D and F and I'm like,
half,
fuck.
I mean idiot.

156
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.270
But it was awesome.
And uh,
the game was great and I actually saw this fan,

157
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.840
I don't know if he's a hero or an absolute disgrace.

158
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.140
It to all depends on how you view,
uh,

159
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.930
your behavior,
right?
A game.

160
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:09.110
This fucking jerk off somehow got himself kicked out of the pro bowl.

161
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.270
I don't know even know how that happens.

162
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.860
Everybody was so well behaved and so psyched.
You're in fucking Hawaii.

163
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.180
The game doesn't mean anything.
Everybody's just having a great time.

164
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.500
This guy was such a fucking maniac and everybody else was behaving so fucking

165
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:27.000
well that I swear to God,

166
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:31.290
the entire security force for the whole fucking stadium all responded to the

167
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:35.540
call.
I've never seen that many cops.
For one guy,
they actually had,

168
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.900
there was like at least a half a dozen cops and two people with like those
white,

169
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.820
uh,
medical fucking shirts on just to kick this one idiot out.

170
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.830
And they finally kicked him out and he's got his tattoo chicken,

171
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.220
that type of shit.
And we think that gone long gone,
blah,
blah,
blah.

172
00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:58.110
Which I think they kicked him out and evidently his chicks stuck around because

173
00:10:58.111 --> 00:10:59.700
with like two minutes left,

174
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.990
this fan runs out on the field and this is what's fucking hilarious is how,

175
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.020
how like how much the game doesn't mean Shit.

176
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.840
Everybody's just sort of mentally on vacation.
I swear to God,

177
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:16.530
this woman ran around for like 50 seconds,
45,

178
00:11:16.531 --> 00:11:19.290
50 seconds before anybody even knew.

179
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.460
Like before you saw the first security guy going out there,

180
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.000
they were so busy staring at the half filled stands.

181
00:11:27.001 --> 00:11:28.260
They didn't know what we were yelling about.

182
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.760
This woman was running out of people.
She was doing that thing,
you know,

183
00:11:32.761 --> 00:11:34.890
you're jumping in the air and bump into the person.

184
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.440
She was doing that to everybody on the field.

185
00:11:37.441 --> 00:11:40.470
She was like running out of players by the time they fucking came out there and

186
00:11:40.471 --> 00:11:42.300
we're looking down there with somebody falling.
It goes,

187
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.200
that's that fucking chick who's with the drunk guy.
So I'll,

188
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.150
I'll section was laughing at it and I'm,

189
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.090
I swear to God it took him about a minute and a half.

190
00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:54.310
She started running down the field towards the other touchdown

191
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.630
<v 1>in the place was going nuts.</v>

192
00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:56.470
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

193
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.000
<v 0>it was a great time.
I highly,</v>

194
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.440
highly recommend coming out here to the pro bowl.
It's a great,
great,

195
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:05.260
great fan experience.
Especially if the Games are going to be like they way,

196
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.050
the way they are now with them.
Uh,

197
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:09.140
<v 2>yeah.</v>

198
00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.840
<v 0>Picking players and stuff.
So they actually,
you know,
it,
you know,</v>

199
00:12:11.841 --> 00:12:15.140
I'm not going to lie to you,
they weren't playing the whole time,
but they will,

200
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.330
you know,
moments where they would,
they would,
you know,

201
00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.420
Deon I guess was talking to the camera.
I didn't see that part,

202
00:12:20.421 --> 00:12:22.940
but was like going,
that's not going to be like this and eat,

203
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.270
amp them up and they'd play for a couple,
uh,
you know,

204
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.210
for the rest of the fucking quarter or something like that.
But at the end of it,

205
00:12:29.211 --> 00:12:32.120
who gives a fuck?
You were in Hawaii.
So anyways,

206
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.410
sorry for the fucking man right here.
What am I up to here?
12 minutes.
12 minutes.

207
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:39.310
<v 2>Okay.</v>

208
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:40.750
<v 1>Oh,
I got it.
I forgot to tell you this.</v>

209
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:43.540
I'm sorry if I'm speaking a little too quietly here cause I'm in my hotel room

210
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:47.950
and they can't be screaming cunt and my hotel.
Um,

211
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.501
so anyways,

212
00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:54.090
they actually had all like all the mascots or majority of them.

213
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.120
I didn't see the Patriots,
stupid Paul Revere,

214
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.520
whatever the fuck that guy's supposed to be mascots at the pro bowl.

215
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.070
So I wasn't really paying attention,

216
00:13:02.071 --> 00:13:04.950
but at one point all the fucking mascots are in the end zone.

217
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:06.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

218
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.200
<v 1>And they have like a little card with a letter on both sides,
which I think,</v>

219
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.000
you know,
they all line up in it.

220
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.920
It says welcome to the pro bowl and then they turn it over a police support the

221
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:20.920
troops,
whatever the fuck it's spelled out.
So it was one of those deals,

222
00:13:20.921 --> 00:13:21.731
they spelled something,

223
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:23.620
then they flipped it over and it's spelled something else.

224
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:25.210
And then they were done,

225
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.950
the camera shot was done and then they just all sort of started to separate

226
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.630
in three mascots,

227
00:13:32.631 --> 00:13:37.631
randomly got together and for five seconds for standing in the end zone spelling

228
00:13:38.211 --> 00:13:39.044
out Jew.

229
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.570
It was one of the funniest fucking things I ever saw.

230
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.230
And what's killed me was how many people missed it cause everybody,

231
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.230
cause they went down to the right hand side and the ball was down in the left.

232
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:54.850
It was like a TV time out or something.

233
00:13:54.851 --> 00:13:58.570
So they was spelling out some fucking thing for the fans and they went back the

234
00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:01.630
other way.
And I had interviewed a couple of the fucking mascots,

235
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:03.660
so I was kind of just watching that little shtick.

236
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

237
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:09.390
<v 0>And um,
me and the people we were with sought and Oma,
God fucking dying,</v>

238
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.870
dying,
laughing.
If I,
if I had a picture of that,

239
00:14:12.871 --> 00:14:15.750
that would have been the funniest shit ever.
You know,

240
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.150
that's where those Nazis has been hiding all these years.

241
00:14:18.151 --> 00:14:21.540
Everybody's been looking for him down in South America and fucking Brazil.

242
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:26.570
They've been hiding in plain sight dressing up as huggable fucking Baltimore

243
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.870
Ravens.
I forget.
I want to rat anybody else.
But the Raven Guy was part of it.

244
00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:34.920
I think he was holding up the w uh,
oh my God,
that was,

245
00:14:34.921 --> 00:14:38.060
can you think of anything less antisemetic than a fucking mask off?

246
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.490
It's just supposed to be this lovable thing doing the worm and the fucking

247
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:45.990
Moonwalk,
getting people going.
Right.
Sticking your fucking head and its mouth.

248
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.160
Then all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,
you just see this ugly side of this thing.

249
00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.020
<v 1>It was so fucking this,
like why,
if he just took it seriously,</v>

250
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:02.030
like why would a mascot hate Jewish people?

251
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.100
And I love that there was no point.
It just said Ju

252
00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.840
oh shit and out,
whatever.
It was fucking funny to me.

336
00:20:26.371 --> 00:20:29.930

337
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.710
upset with me,
but I,
you know,
some,
I don't give a shit.

338
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.590
I hate when they do that stuff.
Well,

there's no trans fats that's like you fucking,
you know,

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.670
drinking yourself to death and you're going,
well,
you know,
there's no heroine,

342
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.710
no heroin in this shit.

343
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.960
<v 0>Um,
this probably be the last week for that reason.
You know,</v>

344
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.860
out of fucking what are you gonna do?
Okay,
let's get back to,

345
00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.870
let's get back to the podcast.
Oh,
this week I finally announced,
um,

346
00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.720
after three people on the Internet were clamoring going,
when are you good?

347
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:06.960
Announced your Canadian tour.

348
00:21:06.961 --> 00:21:10.590
We actually had the presale on Wednesday of last week and it officially went on

349
00:21:10.591 --> 00:21:15.591
sale on Friday and I have to take time to thank the entire almost set continent,

350
00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.540
the entire country of Canada for the unbelievable response.
Oh,

351
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.860
Canada,
you bought a bunch of tickets.

352
00:21:25.861 --> 00:21:30.720
So we add,
it shows four rolled red phase,

353
00:21:30.721 --> 00:21:35.460
twinkle toes.
I'm going to break my jokes and a shiny shirt.

354
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:39.490
I'll do my act for you.
Hey,

355
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:44.530
you know what kills me is if you saw some of the fucking godforsaken places that

356
00:21:44.531 --> 00:21:49.200
I'm going on on this Canadian tour.
All right.

357
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.650
You would think that all Canadians would be happy that I didn't just go to

358
00:21:53.651 --> 00:21:58.360
Montreal,
Toronto,
and they'd go to Vancouver and then just say,
oh,
hey,

359
00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.770
I toured Canada.
I'm going to Vancouver,
Edmonton,
Calgary,

360
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.240
Winnipeg,
Toronto,
someplace,
Hamilton.
I,
you know where the fuck that is?

361
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.333
<v 2>MMM.</v>

362
00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.850
<v 0>Ottawa.
Montreal.</v>

363
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.340
I'm going to Nova Scotia,
I think Halifax.
Is that what that does?
That?

364
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.420
That's where it is.
You would think they'd be like,
wow,
thanks bill.

365
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.960
Thanks for the fucking effort.
You'd think everybody would say that,
but no.

366
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.240
Only 98% of Canadians.
Yeah.

367
00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:29.600
<v 2>Okay.</v>

368
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.130
<v 0>Was that where,
where would that thankful?</v>

369
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.940
Then I got another 2% that were giving me shit because I skipped over

370
00:22:34.941 --> 00:22:35.900
Saskatchewan.

371
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.410
<v 2>Okay.</v>

372
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.790
<v 0>Right.
I want to win a too.</v>

373
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:40.300
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

374
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.480
<v 0>Hey,
people in Saskatchewan,
I appreciate the interest,</v>

375
00:22:43.481 --> 00:22:46.300
but you have a fucking stop for two seconds.

376
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.870
You ever think of rather than just looking at your fucking Igloo,

377
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.800
you may be try and look and see where I'm coming from.
I live in Los Angeles.

378
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:58.900
Okay.
Do you think I have time to go to every God damn province up there?

379
00:22:58.901 --> 00:23:02.200
I'm going out of five.
Five.
You got 10 provinces out there.

380
00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.580
I'll go into five out of 10 of them.
Why can't you see that?

381
00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:08.650
The syrup bucket is half full.

382
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:09.610
<v 2>Okay.</v>

383
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.800
<v 0>You know I live in Los Angeles.</v>

384
00:23:11.801 --> 00:23:15.490
I have fake titties to look at and I'm taking time on a Mike.

385
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.520
Nice sunny fucking winter to go up to that fucking most to step around most

386
00:23:21.591 --> 00:23:23.050
shit.
All right?

387
00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:24.500
<v 2>Okay.</v>

388
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.990
<v 0>For most of the months of March.
Okay.</v>

389
00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.200
And you're going to give me shit because I'm not going to Newfoundland.

390
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.440
I'm not going to Saskatchewan.

391
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:39.740
Why don't you get in your fucking pickup truck and drive over one province?

392
00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:44.660
Help me out.
Help me help you.
Can you do that?

393
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.060
I'm just fucking with the,
actually,
uh,

394
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:52.070
I heard your complaints and because I'm a people pleaser,

395
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.910
I'm actually talking to my agent right now and we're seeing what we can do.

396
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.553
All right.

397
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.900
If I have time or I can fucking put another one in there,
you know,

398
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.580
rather than take a day off and get drunk and go curling or maybe play some pond

399
00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:11.600
hockey and do something that I wanted to do,
you know,

400
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.590
go up there and hang out with the Celine Dion Hall of fame.

401
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:19.970
Something that I would've found enjoyable.
I'm actually looking into my schedule.

402
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:26.660
Okay.
To see if I can make it to those fucking places and you know,
it's funny.

403
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.410
I'll add those and then some con,
the Yukon territory is going to give me shit.

404
00:24:30.411 --> 00:24:32.420
You know what,
I'm never going to get off the road.
Hey,

405
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:33.890
here's a fucking question I have for you.

406
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:35.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

407
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.760
<v 0>All right.
When you're flying internationally,
all right.</v>

408
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.040
For New fucking international flyers out there,

409
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.890
when you're going from like,

410
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.150
<v 2>okay,</v>

411
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.090
<v 0>say like the Olympics Olympics,
so like,
or what Moscow this year,</v>

412
00:24:48.091 --> 00:24:52.490
I know they're in the Ukraine.
They always fly up.

413
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.870
If you're flying from the states,

414
00:24:53.871 --> 00:24:57.650
they fly you up by Greenland and they go up to the top of the globe,

415
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.320
also known as North,
you know,

416
00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:03.740
cause it should conferences or lunch shorter up there.
Right.

417
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.640
And you fly over there so they can save gas and you don't run out and fall into

418
00:25:07.641 --> 00:25:10.160
the fucking ocean.
I get that.
Here's my question.

419
00:25:10.161 --> 00:25:14.600
Why don't they have it just go up and over.
Just go right up and over.

420
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.530
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

421
00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:17.940
<v 0>Say if you want to go to Moscow,</v>

422
00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:21.210
if it's bay or Beijing and it's on the opposite side of the world,

423
00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:26.460
why don't you just get in a plane in Chicago and flied due north and go right up

424
00:25:26.461 --> 00:25:29.790
and over the fucker.
You watch a couple of movies and you're there.

425
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.450
<v 2>Okay.</v>

426
00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:36.450
<v 0>How was asking this question as I always do a to non pilots because I love to</v>

427
00:25:37.211 --> 00:25:41.140
hear what non pilots have to say about flying and then take their information

428
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:45.910
and presented as fact to a other people who aren't in the aviating field.

429
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:49.660
Um,
what does it have to do with the magnetic poles of the planet?

430
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.780
That's it.
Fuck.
With the,
yeah,

431
00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:58.390
you're a little fucking rotisseries there on the fucking dashboard and all of a

432
00:25:58.391 --> 00:26:01.060
sudden you don't know where the ground is and where the sky is.

433
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.500
You know what exactly is the problem?
United Airlines.

434
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:08.630
Why can't you just fly up and over?

435
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:09.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>

436
00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.560
<v 0>Or down in under from my friends down there in Argentina.</v>

437
00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.353
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

438
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.580
<v 0>In Australia.
Why can't they do that with a fuck?
Would you go then?</v>

439
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.040
Hey,
when you fly,
you know.

440
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.720
<v 2>Okay.</v>

441
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.770
<v 0>If,
when you fly over Antarctica,
is there a point where you're just upside down?</v>

442
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.440
I'm
sorry,

443
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:39.830
that was only 80% joking.
Um,
all right,
so here's,
here's a,
here's a video.

444
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.250
Here's a video of that that a lot of people sent me this week.

445
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.000
It was about these,
uh,
these fucking bank,
a cock suck.
Is there,

446
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.540
um,
let's see,
what letter is it here?

447
00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.020
This isn't the BBC news.
Uh,

448
00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:59.980
HSBC imposes restrictions on large cash withdrawals.

449
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:06.580
All right.
And uh,
so at HSBC,
customers have been prevented.

450
00:27:06.581 --> 00:27:10.480
Some customers have ever been prevented from withdrawing large amounts of cash

451
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:15.280
because they could not provide evidence of why they wanted it to.

452
00:27:15.281 --> 00:27:18.490
BBC has learnt,
isn't it?
Learned,

453
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.010
has learnt anyways.

454
00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:25.150
Listeners have told radios for his money box,

455
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.090
not to be confused with nature's box.

456
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:33.400
They were stopped from withdrawing amounts ranging from five grand of 5,000

457
00:27:33.761 --> 00:27:35.410
pounds,
10,000 pounds.

458
00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.130
HSBC admitted it is not informed.

459
00:27:39.131 --> 00:27:43.300
Customers have to change in policy policy,
which was implemented in November.

460
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.410
The bank says it is now changed its guidance to staff.

461
00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.540
Um,
so basically,

462
00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.200
<v 2>okay,</v>

463
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.430
<v 0>this guy went down,
they said,</v>

464
00:27:52.431 --> 00:27:55.910
can I have my 5,000 pounds that I earned and I put in this bank for safety?

465
00:27:55.911 --> 00:27:59.990
They said no.
He said,
can I have 4,000 pounds?
They said no.

466
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:04.610
And then I wrote one out,
I guess one of the withdrawal slip for 3000 pounds.

467
00:28:04.611 --> 00:28:09.550
And they said,
okay,
we'll give you that.
Um,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

468
00:28:09.551 --> 00:28:10.011
blah,
blah,
blah.

469
00:28:10.011 --> 00:28:12.710
So they got a bunch of bad press and how allegedly they're changing it.

470
00:28:12.711 --> 00:28:16.350
So a bunch of people said,
you know,
what's the fucks with these banker con?

471
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:21.500
You know,
it's,
it's our money,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada and all that shit.

472
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.040
I got news for you.
It's not your money.

473
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:30.490
<v 1>All right.
It's their money.
They print it,
it's theirs,
okay?</v>

474
00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:35.550
And your job is to take the money that they give you for working your ass off

475
00:28:35.651 --> 00:28:36.031
all week,

476
00:28:36.031 --> 00:28:41.031
and your job is to then take that money and give it back to them or get your ass

477
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.540
into debt with it.

478
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:45.030
<v 2>Okay?</v>

479
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:47.480
<v 1>Think about your work all fucking weekend.
What do I do?</v>

480
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.410
Even hold money in your fucking hand anymore.

481
00:28:49.411 --> 00:28:52.230
They give it to you on this fucking piece of paper,
all right?

482
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.540
I know a lot of people rolling their eyes right now,
okay?

483
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:57.450
But I got to point at the end of this shit.
Okay?

484
00:28:57.451 --> 00:28:59.050
You take it down to these fuckers.
Just

485
00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.060
<v 0>give it to them.
Now this is the thing,</v>

486
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:06.410
the reason why it's not like the reason why they didn't give that person the

487
00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:08.920
10,000 pounds.
Do you know why they didn't give it to them?

488
00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:10.840
It's because they don't have it.

489
00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.220
<v 2>Okay?</v>

490
00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.820
<v 0>I'm not saying that they don't physically have 10,000 pounds in the back.</v>

491
00:29:15.821 --> 00:29:16.660
Yes they do,

492
00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:21.250
but they don't have 10,000 pounds available to give to it.

493
00:29:21.251 --> 00:29:24.220
Just some random jackass who goes,
oh,
by the way,

494
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.150
I want to take 10,000 pounds out right fucking now they don't have it.

495
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:34.020
Well,
I dunno about how it works in England,
but as far as in the United States,

496
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:39.090
they don't have it for the simple fact that when,

497
00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:40.470
<v 2>yeah,</v>

498
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.510
<v 0>if you went and you deposit some regular fucking Tom,
Dick,</v>

499
00:29:43.511 --> 00:29:47.500
Harry or Louise and you deposit 10 grand into a bank,

500
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:53.670
back in the old days when there was some sort of rules and regulations governing

501
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:58.870
these audit control cons,
when you ran a bank,

502
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.120
you had on your books,

503
00:30:01.121 --> 00:30:05.950
like you can only loan out a certain percentage of the money

504
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.230
or the bank was in violation.
Like,
like saying,
let's just say to make it easy,

505
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.620
there are million dollars was deposited into your bank.

506
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.860
You could only at during that time you could only loan out,

507
00:30:17.861 --> 00:30:21.790
I don't know what the percentage was,
but it was like 300 grand of it,
400 grand.

508
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.020
Um,
I forget what the percentage was,
but she,
you could,
you could,

509
00:30:26.021 --> 00:30:30.670
you couldn't go past a certain tipping point because God forbid if there was a

510
00:30:30.671 --> 00:30:34.450
run on money and everybody started withdrawing,

511
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:36.940
the bank would fail.
Now any bag,

512
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:41.941
if everybody shows up and tries to take the money out is gonna fail because you

513
00:30:42.251 --> 00:30:46.060
know,
they,
they,
they loan out a certain percentage of it all right?

514
00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:49.990
But throughout the years they kept pushing that percentage up more and more and

515
00:30:49.991 --> 00:30:54.991
more and more to the point that they got up to not only can they loan out 100%

516
00:30:56.321 --> 00:31:00.640
of the deposits from the hard work and the people that deposit the money in

517
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:01.360
there,

518
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.360
they can actually then create another $2 million off that million,

519
00:31:07.481 --> 00:31:10.210
something like that.
Like,
so if you deposit 10 grand,

520
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:15.240
they can take your full 10 grand loan it out plus another 10 grand off that 10

521
00:31:15.971 --> 00:31:18.340
grand plus another 10 grand off that 10 grand.

522
00:31:18.341 --> 00:31:22.990
So they basically just invented slash counterfeited 20 grand.

523
00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.220
That didn't even fucking exist off that 10 grant.

524
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:31.710
They got 30 grand loaned out so they can make the money off that fucking 20%

525
00:31:32.381 --> 00:31:36.610
interest off of that kick and you half a percent in your fucking account and

526
00:31:36.611 --> 00:31:41.470
they just sit there knowing full well at some point whatever bubble they're

527
00:31:41.471 --> 00:31:44.620
creating is going to burst.
Shit is going to hit the fan.

528
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.560
You're going to be asked out and they're too big to fail.

529
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:51.370
And at worst case scenario that you're going after a corporation and what are

530
00:31:51.371 --> 00:31:54.640
they?
They're just,
they're just,
they're faceless corporation is faceless.

531
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:56.200
They take their bonuses.

532
00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.590
It's just sitting there waiting for John Cougar Mellencamp to write you a

533
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:00.424
fucking song.

534
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.960
It fucking jackass aid and they're out there buying a new fucking yacht.

535
00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:11.380
All right.
Did that make sense?
And I know you guys are going to be a girl.

536
00:32:11.381 --> 00:32:13.030
You full of Shit,
blah blah,
blah blah.

537
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.480
You don't know what the fuck you talking about.
You sound like a moron.
Hey,

538
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:17.650
I'll take all of that.

539
00:32:17.651 --> 00:32:20.980
But I'm going to tell you this for like the fucking hundredth time in my standup

540
00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:22.840
career when I was in Albuquerque,

541
00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:27.400
I had a banker come up to me and was laughing going,

542
00:32:27.401 --> 00:32:31.050
I know you hate us.
And I said,
listen,
am I a moron and the podcast?

543
00:32:31.051 --> 00:32:34.120
And they always say no.
They go,
no,
you're not.

544
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.150
You know this of some factual errors a little bit here or there.

545
00:32:37.151 --> 00:32:39.770
But basically what you're saying is 100% true.

546
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:45.170
I talked conspiracy theory one time in my own bank as I was trying to set

547
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:47.270
something up new on my account.

548
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:52.160
I was talking to a banker about conspiracy theory and he was talking about

549
00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:54.800
banking.
It was talking about how scary and fucked up it was.

550
00:32:54.801 --> 00:32:57.080
And he was asking me what I plan to do.

551
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.600
What do you think about gold and silver coins?

552
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.900
What are you think about growing Zucchini?
And I,

553
00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:06.210
it was the most techniques whispering and shit.
I'm telling you.
Um,

554
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.210
and I have no solution.

555
00:33:09.211 --> 00:33:13.790
So when I'm really being right now was the fucking fearmonger.
But,
uh,
this is,

556
00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:16.640
this is the great thing about banking is that,
you know,

557
00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:21.670
I would say a good 95% of people walking around with a fucking Goddamn tootsie

558
00:33:22.791 --> 00:33:27.410
pop in their mouth,
pulling their fucking Hawaiian shorts out of their ass,
crack,

559
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:32.810
believe in it.
All right?
And as long as they continue to believe in it,

560
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:38.380
you can kind of exist in the game drafting behind there.

561
00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:43.130
Um,
uninformed.
I don't know what the fucking words,

562
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.840
I'm too stupid to do this,
but you just basically like,
I dunno,

563
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:53.300
I am of the belief that if you can get a fucking house by one that you can

564
00:33:53.301 --> 00:33:56.150
afford and then pay that fucker down as soon as you can.

565
00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:00.000
And all of that shit that people say where they go,
oh no,

566
00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.680
invest investment because you go to the dude,
fuck that.

567
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.960
Pay Off your fucking house.
And then if the bank fails,
you still have a house.

568
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.280
Who gives a fuck if you paid 700 grand for it,

569
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:17.000
now it's only worth a hundred grand.
You still have a house.

570
00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.350
As much as that sucks,
at least just still have it.

571
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:26.030
Like the fucking stock market,
right?
You work your whole God damn life.

572
00:34:26.031 --> 00:34:28.670
You stick it in that and stick it in this over there when you think you're being

573
00:34:28.671 --> 00:34:29.504
conservative,

574
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:33.680
the thing shits the bed and in the end you can be left with nothing.

575
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:38.480
So I am into tangent,
tangible shit.
Can you tell?

576
00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:43.460
He screamed whenever I do a podcast the day after I went to a game or I did a

577
00:34:43.461 --> 00:34:47.150
lot of shows.
I sound like I'm going through puberty again.
I apologize.

578
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:52.040
But um,
I believe in investing in tangible shift.

579
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:55.580
And don't let your wife or your husband be local.
We go,
kid,
we'd go,

580
00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.310
we'd go to shave up with a college education.
You know what?

581
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:03.440
Fuck their college education.
All right.
Take out a loan.

582
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.490
Take out a fucking look.
You're paying interest on your house.

583
00:35:07.491 --> 00:35:11.720
Now the amount of money that you're going to save knocking down your principal

584
00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:16.070
will pay for most if not all of their college education.

585
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.660
All right?
Unless they just go to some unbelievably expensive school.
And your,

586
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:24.740
I dunno,
living in some little house on the prairie,

587
00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:29.180
I'm like a land and smoking a pipe.
Um,

588
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.770
so there you go.
So that's why,
that's why when they go down there,

589
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.170
because they,

590
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:41.070
they're not going to give 10 grand or 10 pounds to the average jackass walking

591
00:35:41.071 --> 00:35:44.610
in there because that starts fucking with their game,

592
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:48.120
which is pretending that all the money is there and that it's,

593
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.590
it's safe and that there's nothing to worry about and nothing to see here.

594
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:57.590
So what they do is they pull this shit and they bullied people individually over

595
00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:01.530
in the corner behind that bulletproof glass.
And they're like,
no,

596
00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:05.370
you have to get a note.
And blahblahblahblahblah.
And most people,

597
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:12.380
like they have a parent child relationship their entire life.

598
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:18.180
They come out as a child,
their parents tell them what to do,

599
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.370
what they can and can't do,
when they can eat,

600
00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:24.480
when they have to go to bed and they go off into the world,
you know,

601
00:36:24.481 --> 00:36:27.840
you go to school,
we'll go to lunch,
now you have a question,

602
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:31.200
raise your hand and you,
you stay in that mentality.

603
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:36.320
So to the point you have a fucking adult who earned the money will go into a

604
00:36:36.481 --> 00:36:37.314
bank.

605
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.790
<v 1>You know,
God bless this person who actually fucking was like,
no,</v>

606
00:36:40.791 --> 00:36:43.490
this is my money and complained and brought this out to light.

607
00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.010
But do you think this is the only person they did that?
So

608
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:50.690
the money's not there man.
Yeah.

609
00:36:50.691 --> 00:36:54.680
Like if you had like two 300 grand in an account and you decide that you just

610
00:36:54.681 --> 00:36:58.310
want to fucking take it out.
Like if you physically want the money,

611
00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.080
if you want to transfer it,
like fucking numbers,
hit enter,

612
00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.370
they'll fucking do that all day.
I had no worries.

613
00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.740
But if you actually wanted the paper,

614
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.310
like you can't just walk in there and be like,
yes,

615
00:37:10.311 --> 00:37:13.760
I'd like my 300 grant and they'd be like,
oh,
okay.

616
00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:15.740
And come out big sex and money.

617
00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.830
You got to call them days if not a week in advance.

618
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.280
And then what they gotta do is frantically call around and find an armored car

619
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:30.160
with enough of this paper that isn't worth shit other than the fact that the guy

620
00:37:31.131 --> 00:37:33.260
with the underwear and his ass still believes in it.

621
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.660
They got to drive that there so they can physically keep the lie going.
Alright,

622
00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.810
there you go.
So that's the end of my,

623
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.270
my fucking a barroom banking one oh one.
All right.

624
00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:48.400
And uh,
you know,

625
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:52.970
I don't give a fuck about your opinions either because I'm not enlightened as a

626
00:37:52.971 --> 00:37:55.640
human being.
If you don't agree with what I said,
then you know,

627
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:59.810
just laugh at me and continue on with your fucking day because a,

628
00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.920
you're actually helping me out as long as you keep fucking believing in it

629
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.520
<v 0>minute.</v>

630
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:09.520
But I think the day the wave hitting the beach is coming soon because,

631
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.560
uh,
you know,
at least in this country,

632
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.170
I mean the government shut down for three fucking days and I know it made for

633
00:38:18.171 --> 00:38:21.260
great standup material,
but that is absolutely fucking terrifying.

634
00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:26.540
Every year when August comes around and we hit the debt ceiling and we just keep

635
00:38:26.541 --> 00:38:30.710
raising it,
we just keep pushing more of shit under the bed.

636
00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.820
Like eventually,
it's not all,
I dunno,
that's probably the wrong analogy.

637
00:38:34.821 --> 00:38:35.950
I don't what the fuck we're doing,

638
00:38:35.951 --> 00:38:39.700
but eventually the shit is going to hit the fan.
So,
uh,

639
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:43.990
<v 1>I'm not saying I'm going to survive it,
whatever the fuck happens,</v>

640
00:38:43.991 --> 00:38:45.280
but I do have a game plan.

641
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.180
My game plan is to pay off my house as quickly as I can.

642
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:54.070
So when the first wave of people are being brought to the,
uh,

643
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.710
I dunno what euphemism they're going to be using for that

644
00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:01.360
<v 0>detention camps.
Um,
I figured it'll be like,</v>

645
00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.600
<v 1>but you can't pay off your house for repossessing the house.</v>

646
00:39:03.601 --> 00:39:07.770
So now we're going to move you to alternative,
relaxing,
living,

647
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:09.150
whatever the fuck they're going to call it.

648
00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.790
At least I won't be in that first wave of people.

649
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:17.940
<v 0>I will have my house paid off and I was standing there dressed like a court</v>

650
00:39:17.941 --> 00:39:20.810
gesture with my little fancy cane.
Okay.

651
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.830
<v 1>Going but get off my property and they'll look at me and be like,
oh,</v>

652
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:27.310
look at those little cut thick and he has power.
All right,
we'll be back for you.

653
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.970
We'll be back for like a month to salt.
Let's just get the,
uh,

654
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.470
let's get the mouth breathers first.

655
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:37.230
Let's get the easy people then will weed out the red conch and then it'll all be

656
00:39:37.231 --> 00:39:38.064
ours.

657
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:43.810
Some of that somehow ties in to how they're trying to make robots more and more

658
00:39:44.981 --> 00:39:45.814
human link.

659
00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:50.890
<v 0>All right,
this is the kind of Shit,
this story right here</v>

660
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:56.620
<v 1>that seems like a victory for the common man.
And what it really is,</v>

661
00:39:56.621 --> 00:40:01.420
is this just moving the ball forward on the development of robots so they can

662
00:40:01.421 --> 00:40:02.860
eventually phase us out.

663
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:07.350
<v 0>Um,
and then they can just have robot people that will never,
never complain.</v>

664
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.590
And then of course,
if you watch science fiction movies,

665
00:40:10.591 --> 00:40:13.790
they somehow take over the humans,
which they're not going to do.

666
00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:18.240
They're not going to do that.
All right?
We made you all right,

667
00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:24.540
we'll unplug you.
We won't fix.
You have dump some water on you.

668
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.630
You know,
this is the deal.

669
00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:32.640
Every fucking web designer when he builds your website or build you a secure

670
00:40:32.641 --> 00:40:36.150
site always builds in a fucking back door.
All right?

671
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.270
So the guys making the robots are going to do the same fucking thing.

672
00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:43.230
There's no way the Illuminati is going to have a bunch of robots that are

673
00:40:43.231 --> 00:40:46.530
stronger than them.
Don't need to sleep and all that type of shit.

674
00:40:46.531 --> 00:40:50.010
And like they watch science fiction movies.
These fuckers are science fiction.

675
00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:51.840
How crazy do I sound this week?

676
00:40:51.841 --> 00:40:54.680
I'm actually enjoying every fucking second of this.
Um,

677
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:57.710
they're going to have a back door,
you know,

678
00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:02.140
somewhere up that robots ask this gotta be something that they can fucking do.

679
00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:07.190
Some button they have to push.
Um,
all right,
so they got,

680
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.890
was that weird enough for you?
Huh?
I'm sorry.

681
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.210
What do you,
what do you want from me?
You know,
I'm a fucking weird guy.

682
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.500
<v 1>Some more.
Let me,
let me bring it back to earth with a fucking commercial.</v>

683
00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.360
All right.
Legal Zoom,
everyone.
You know,

684
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:27.440
some things like starting your own business or protecting your family with a

685
00:41:27.441 --> 00:41:30.590
will aren't like your other new year's resolutions.

686
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:35.030
You can't afford to blow them off.
Instead of less snacking and more exercise,

687
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:38.060
put those things to the agile is set at the top of your list.

688
00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:40.880
I still think that that's written incorrectly.
That's why I tried to Improv.

689
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.300
Improv my way through that legal zone helps you in court what they're really

690
00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:44.841
trying to say.

691
00:41:44.841 --> 00:41:48.290
Instead of watching your waistline and exercise and what you're great things you

692
00:41:48.291 --> 00:41:51.800
might want to consider having a will.
All right?
In case you get hit by a bus,

693
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.900
you know when somebody takes you all the stuff off your mantle and your kids

694
00:41:56.901 --> 00:41:58.460
don't get it instead of why whatever.

695
00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:02.840
Over a 1 million entrepreneurs have done it in 90% of customers.

713
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:04.610
And juggling incoming calls yourself,

714
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:09.120

You know,

730
00:43:59.101 --> 00:44:02.250
I fucked up there in the ending because I could swear to God that nature box was

731
00:44:02.251 --> 00:44:03.210
really bothering me.

732
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:05.923
<v 2>You know,</v>

733
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:08.460
<v 1>I'm going to talk to those guys.</v>

734
00:44:08.461 --> 00:44:11.190
I'm going to find out more about what they're putting in nature's box there

735
00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.760
because I'm not going to sell you guys a bunch of shit that's not even healthy

736
00:44:17.381 --> 00:44:20.680
for you,
but you know that's looks like one of those fad diet.
You know what?

737
00:44:20.681 --> 00:44:25.680
You just eat a fucking banana.
Okay,
Laurie,
what is a banana?

738
00:44:25.681 --> 00:44:29.850
25 cents 35 cents in New York with a 50 cents.

739
00:44:29.851 --> 00:44:32.100
Now gives a fuck.
Eat a God damn banana.

740
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:37.590
<v 0>Have an apple,
it's fiber.
It's going to fill you up.
Have a giant salad.</v>

741
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.440
You know what you need to do and you're just being lazy.

742
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:45.240
And rather than doing that,
okay,
cause your body's craving sugar and salt,

743
00:44:45.241 --> 00:44:49.050
you think in that you want to eat fucking Carmel Pretzel Cupcakes,

744
00:44:49.051 --> 00:44:50.970
whatever the fuck they're selling,
you don't.

745
00:44:50.971 --> 00:44:55.650
What you need to do is you need to fucking do.
You need,
they get a goddamn salad.

746
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.280
You need to get that in your body and then your body will crave that.

747
00:44:59.281 --> 00:45:02.880
Your body will crave nutrition and it's the greatest fucking thing ever.

748
00:45:02.881 --> 00:45:04.980
And if you actually read up on nutrition,

749
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.510
which I have only kind of done and it's helped me immensely,
but if you guys,

750
00:45:09.511 --> 00:45:12.090
you know,
there's no way you're gonna be dumber than I am.

751
00:45:12.091 --> 00:45:16.260
If you actually read up on nutrition,
you don't even fucking,
if you go for walks,

752
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:18.060
you don't need to go to the gym.

753
00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:23.610
If you just did pushups and pull ups and you ate a balanced nutrition diet,

754
00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:28.230
nutrition,
nutritional diet,
you know what?

755
00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.450
The goddamn fucking

756
00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:35.550
snicker doodle that looks like a chocolate color covered fucking apple.

757
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.830
I hate that shit.
All right.

758
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.700
I just have a bio of fucking old roommate of mine used to do that all the time

759
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:46.320
and you'll know who it is by the impression,
you know?
No,
I'm not going to do it,

760
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.390
but this first,

761
00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:50.820
some used to fucking go on these God used to one time he was on this diet,

762
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.050
drinking like this chocolate shake three times a day.

763
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.240
Three times a fucking day.

764
00:45:57.241 --> 00:46:02.241
This dude is drinking a goddamn chocolate shake to lose weight.

765
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:08.730
Oh,
it's chocolate.
Favorite fucking powder.
Oh yeah.
I'm sure that's not,

766
00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:10.500
I'm sure that's great for your waistline,

767
00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:12.810
but I can imagine that's doing something else fucked up.

768
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:15.090
Would you look at what you're,
you're putting in your body.

769
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.740
You fucking moron us.
It's just,
and I'm more on what are you,

770
00:46:19.741 --> 00:46:22.260
what are you going to do?
Hey,
you know,
Drake,
you fucking powdered milk.

771
00:46:22.261 --> 00:46:26.850
I don't give a shit die sooner.
And uh,
you know the rivers are cleaner.

772
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.020
All right,
where do I go from here?
Oh,
last week.
You know what?

773
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:35.030
I forgot to bring up.
I had such a busy week.
Um,

774
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:39.690
I went to the,
uh,
hang on a second here.
What the fuck did I just do there?

775
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:41.580
<v 2>Okay.</v>

776
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.030
<v 0>I gotta make sure.
Oh,
all right.
Hang on a second.</v>

777
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:50.690
I know it sounds weird right now.
I gotta look this up here.

778
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:55.670
Make sure I get this right and get the dates right and everything.
Um,

779
00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.180
all right.
Last week I forgot to mention,

780
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.970
<v 2>okay,</v>

781
00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:02.540
<v 0>that I went to the,
uh,</v>

782
00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:08.990
now why the fuck motor come out now?
Could now it comes up.
All right.

783
00:47:08.991 --> 00:47:11.840
This happens once a week on the podcast.
If you new to it,
by the way,

784
00:47:11.841 --> 00:47:14.930
I always go to look something up and of course my computer doesn't even fucking

785
00:47:14.931 --> 00:47:18.590
work.
Um,
anyways,
I went to the,
uh,

786
00:47:18.591 --> 00:47:21.110
the common thread clinic tour,

787
00:47:21.111 --> 00:47:23.270
which is a drum clinic for all your drummers out there.

788
00:47:23.271 --> 00:47:28.271
If you just want to watch three absolute fucking beast on the drums with three

789
00:47:28.641 --> 00:47:31.960
totally styles.
Um,

790
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:35.080
and what's really cool is they're actually all seven years apart.

791
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:39.700
That's what they said once 23,
one's 30,
one's 37.
And,

792
00:47:39.701 --> 00:47:40.534
um,

793
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:46.300
it was just an absolutely incredible tour that I ended up going to because I was

794
00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:50.320
following Mike Johnston,
who I've talked about here,
Mike's lessons.com.

795
00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:51.970
And,
uh,

796
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:56.410
he's on tour with Matt Halpern and a JP Bouvier.

797
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:59.830
I hope I said that right.
Fluent French for so many God damn years.

798
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:03.490
Absolutely amazing.
Um,
amazing,
amazing drummers.

799
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:07.720
So as far as the tour that I see,
uh,
it looks like they're off right now,

800
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:12.220
but they're gonna maybe start back up in April of I'm saying this right.
Um,

801
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:16.090
you can look it up on Facebook.
The common thread clinic tour,
April 18th,

802
00:48:16.091 --> 00:48:19.570
19th 20th 22 2125 they go,

803
00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:23.680
this was basically there'll be Lancaster,
Pennsylvania on the 18th.

804
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:29.350
Uh,
they're going to be in debt for township,
New Jersey on April 19th,

805
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:33.970
Asbury Park,
New Jersey on the 20th.
Manhattan,
New York,
Sam Ash,

806
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.280
the 22nd,
uh,

807
00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:41.310
Middletown New York on the 23rd Manhattan New York drummers collective.

808
00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:47.490
April 25th.
I used to take drum lessons there,
places.
Awesome.
Anyways,
um,

809
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:49.990
if you're a drummer or even just a musician,

810
00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:54.490
like they gave just great advice on how to get better and how to actually make a

811
00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:59.491
living as a musician was absolutely fucking mind blowing.

812
00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.070
Amazing.
Um,
drum clinic.

813
00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:06.700
And one of the coolest things is all three of them are up there at the same
time.

814
00:49:06.701 --> 00:49:09.640
So they kind of draw out of a hat who's going to solo first.

815
00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:14.170
And one of the coolest thing other than listening and watching the drum solo is

816
00:49:14.171 --> 00:49:18.310
watching the other two drummers watching who's ever playing.

817
00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:21.640
And you watch them learning stuff and kind of looking at each other smiling when

818
00:49:21.641 --> 00:49:24.850
they see whatever cool Phil or something like that.
It was,

819
00:49:24.851 --> 00:49:29.620
it was fucking awesome.
Can't say enough great things about it.
So,
uh,
you know,

820
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:33.660
we'll have the link up on the podcast page for the common thread,
a clinic tour.

821
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:38.140
Hope you guys get to check it out or he just like fucking drums.
You know,

822
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:41.860
it works on so many levels.
Do you want to make a dream come true?

823
00:49:41.861 --> 00:49:46.810
It actually works on that fucking level.
Um,
if you know how to just apply it.

824
00:49:46.811 --> 00:49:49.690
And what kills me about watching these guys getting better,

825
00:49:49.691 --> 00:49:52.260
talking about getting better as drummers,
this,

826
00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:57.360
it's the exact same like process as getting to get better as a,

827
00:49:59.441 --> 00:50:03.970
uh,
a comedian or even like an athlete,
you know,
finding a weakness,

828
00:50:03.971 --> 00:50:08.320
working on a weakness,
you know,
sticking with it,
you know,

829
00:50:08.321 --> 00:50:12.250
being open and be a positive networking with the people.
It's the all the same,

830
00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.730
the exact same thing.
It was really fucking mind blowing.
So,
uh,

831
00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:17.170
check it out if you get a chance.

832
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.800
And with that we are one week away,

833
00:50:20.801 --> 00:50:24.250
not even one week away from the super bowl everybody.
And um,

834
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.130
I actually thought that all they were going to do is talking about Sherman Guy

835
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.840
and uh,
evidently I guess all they've been talking about is the weather.
I don't,

836
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:36.320
you know,
I haven't been paying attention,
but uh,
you know,

837
00:50:36.321 --> 00:50:39.950
I did that thing this week and I talked to a lot of football guys and people

838
00:50:39.951 --> 00:50:41.000
just kept bringing up the weather.

839
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.870
I don't understand what is the big fucking deal that it's in New York City

840
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:50.030
football fans.
Like,
I don't understand.
Why are they tough?
Right up until the,

841
00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:55.040
the AFC and NFC championship games and they could sit and snow.

842
00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:59.090
You know,
did anybody die at the Green Bay packer game?

843
00:50:59.091 --> 00:51:02.900
It was like fucking minus 20 whatever it was.
It was fine.

844
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.610
They're football fans.

845
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:08.930
Why are they making such a big fucking deal if it snows and the Superbowl and

846
00:51:08.931 --> 00:51:11.450
you know what it is for what I've heard,

847
00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:16.570
it's because so many fucking haberdashery cons who don't even give a fuck these

848
00:51:17.001 --> 00:51:21.080
corporate people that want to show up in their wing tips in there fucking ties,

849
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:23.413
you know,

850
00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:29.180
and he fucking Sushi and all that shit during the game.
That's the big deal.

851
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:31.071
That's the big deal.

852
00:51:31.071 --> 00:51:32.750
Cause I was sitting there thinking like this is fucking great.

853
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.230
The one of the great NFL films of all time is when they show a,

854
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:41.690
that Greenbay Dallas cowboys game up in Lambeau field,
the frozen Tundra,
right?

855
00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:45.860
People are going to be fine.
There's no problem.

856
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:50.660
Stop acting like regular people are nervous about a little bit of fucking snow.

857
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:54.530
I think it's going to be great.
It's about time.

858
00:51:54.531 --> 00:51:58.880
Why do they always get to play around a bunch of palm trees?
I fucking,

859
00:51:58.881 --> 00:52:00.830
you know something.
I fucking hate the Superbowl.

860
00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:03.800
I love that it's for the championship,

861
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.700
but I hate all of how much more shit can add to it.

862
00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:13.250
Jesus fucking Christ.
Now one band,

863
00:52:13.251 --> 00:52:16.850
you've got two bands.
You've got all this stupid commercials,
you know,

864
00:52:16.851 --> 00:52:20.720
I said last week to just let the game go.
Like take the game,
let it go.

865
00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:22.280
90 minutes before you start.

866
00:52:22.281 --> 00:52:27.281
I would actually go a full two hours this year with all of the Goddamn crap that

867
00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:33.760
I'm a grumpy old man.
All right,
let's plow forward.
Um,

868
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.800
and somebody give that Guy Sherman a hug.
Okay.

869
00:52:36.801 --> 00:52:39.440
I know he's acting all confident in everything,
but I'm telling you,

870
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:43.520
that guy needs a hug.
He needs a hug and please tell him that he's the best.

871
00:52:43.521 --> 00:52:48.440
Everything in the world.
I'll call it it right now.

872
00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:50.293
Call her right now.

873
00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:55.420
That guy will eventually break down and cry in an interview.

874
00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:01.340
He's going to,
there will be the softer side of,
uh,

875
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:06.200
whatever his first name is Sherman.
I swear to God,
I seen him before.

876
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:09.350
I called it when I saw a rex Ryan walking around,

877
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:14.090
stick it out as fucking is man.
Tits talking all this shit.

878
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:19.010
I'm telling you,
that guy cries himself to sleep with a bowl of ice cream.

879
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:23.180
You know,
his wife rubs his head every night telling him it's,

880
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:24.360
it's going to be okay.

881
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:30.430
<v 1>I'm just fucking with rex riding.</v>

882
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:32.940
I actually think he's a great coach and he asks you,

883
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.680
he hasn't talked any shit in a couple of years,

884
00:53:34.681 --> 00:53:36.330
but he hasn't had a team where he could.

885
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:40.740
So I think it's very easy for him to be behaving himself.
So we'll see.

886
00:53:40.741 --> 00:53:44.790
Who the fuck knows what [inaudible] judge him.
Right.
All right.

887
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:48.030
Okay.
Let's get with into the emails for the week.

888
00:53:48.031 --> 00:53:51.870
Paul Pierce's returned to Boston,
a Billy leaf clover.

889
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:56.800
I just left the TD bank north Gatton.
Not sure if you had any hotels,

890
00:53:56.801 --> 00:54:00.780
sports center time whilst in Hawaii,
but peers made is returned tonight.

891
00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:03.600
It was really special.
The consensus was that no one,

892
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:08.190
no other Boston athlete has received as warm.
A welcome is pierce would,

893
00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:12.690
uh,
having been there,
I got to say it's the truth.
No Pun intended.

894
00:54:12.691 --> 00:54:14.990
Men were crying.
Kids who didn't grow up watching,

895
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:19.410
watching him knew he was something special,
by the way.
It felt in there tonight.

896
00:54:19.411 --> 00:54:23.280
No one played harder night after night for over a decade.
And even while,
no,

897
00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:27.600
even while no one was watching Tuesday night games against the raptors at the

898
00:54:27.601 --> 00:54:30.960
end of a losing,
losing season and he would still play his heart out.

899
00:54:30.961 --> 00:54:33.690
It was really amazing.
The link is below,
uh,

900
00:54:33.691 --> 00:54:36.270
for the video from the game actually watched it.
Yeah,
it was amazing.

901
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:40.970
A Celtics fan traded him right when he came back.
Um,

902
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:42.750
yeah.

903
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:46.080
I mean that reminded me of the standing ovation that Bobby your got when he came

904
00:54:46.081 --> 00:54:50.880
back,
when Larry Bird a retired.
I mean,
that was right up there with,

905
00:54:50.881 --> 00:54:55.860
um,
with everybody.
And I think that's such a great thing when fans,
uh,

906
00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.730
show their appreciation like that.
So I'm psyched.

907
00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:03.030
It seemed like obviously Paul Pierce was really moved and that type of thing,

908
00:55:03.031 --> 00:55:04.830
and he's definitely,
he's going to be up there.
They're,

909
00:55:04.831 --> 00:55:07.860
I think they're going to retire as number they have to.
They have to.

910
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.420
He's one of the great,
so,
uh,
if you didn't get a chance,
we'll have that link.

911
00:55:12.421 --> 00:55:16.890
I got alarmed.
I'm promising a lot of links this week.
Everybody.
Okay.

912
00:55:16.891 --> 00:55:18.040
Did I mention that I,
yeah,

913
00:55:18.041 --> 00:55:21.300
I mentioned that I commentated the last minute 45 of the pro bowl.

914
00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:24.980
That's the one I'm,
I'm looking forward to hearing your reaction to because,
uh,

915
00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:30.000
I'm about me,
not Paul Pierce.
I'm a selfish shit and Taina.
Um,

916
00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:33.780
all right.
Uh,
Bill,
my friend wants to be you,

917
00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.520
dear freckled avenger.
I have a problem.

918
00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:42.090
Ever since one of my buddies started listening to you,

919
00:55:42.091 --> 00:55:44.910
he started trying to act exactly like you.

920
00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.700
He started using a fake Boston accent.

921
00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:52.170
He changes as appending pinions according to the weekly podcast.

922
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:56.490
I know because I listened to the show and I can hear his opinions changed during

923
00:55:56.491 --> 00:56:01.230
our conversations on Tuesday morning.
Also,
he roots for all Boston sports teams.

924
00:56:01.231 --> 00:56:04.650
Now,
the only thing he hasn't done his dies fucking hair red.

925
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:06.410
I don't want to be the asshole.

926
00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:10.320
I don't want to be the asshole calls them out of ruins the friendship.

927
00:56:10.321 --> 00:56:13.800
Could you please say a few words about this?
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.

928
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:15.300
Well listen pal,

929
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:21.380
you know it's long been stated that I am the Taylor swift of podcasting,

930
00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:27.160
right?
Little boys and girls look up to me.
They want to be me.

931
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:28.630
They play dress up.

932
00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:35.180
Yeah.
I don't know what to do with this fucking email.
Whatever.

933
00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.180
He seems like he's enjoying it to another level.
I liked that.

934
00:56:38.181 --> 00:56:42.050
He's a fan of all Boston teams right now and I'm kind of enjoying that.

935
00:56:42.051 --> 00:56:45.860
It's ruining your life.
I actually wish I didn't read this.

936
00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:50.220
I wonder if he's listening right now and can actually tell that your,

937
00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:54.800
his own friend wrote this.
This is fucking weird.
I'm right in the middle of it.

938
00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:57.123
Um,

939
00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:01.520
is he going to get a fucking Patriots Jersey that says freckled to venture on

940
00:57:01.521 --> 00:57:02.430
the back of it?
No.

941
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:04.103
<v 2>Okay.</v>

942
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:07.460
<v 1>And what kind of friend to you?
Man.
Why?
Why can't you just let him have his fun?</v>

943
00:57:07.461 --> 00:57:12.230
People need heroes.
Why can't I be a hero to somebody?

944
00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:15.410
You know?
You know what I want to do.

945
00:57:15.411 --> 00:57:18.800
I want that dude to come out to a comedy show.
When he laughs at one of my jokes,

946
00:57:18.801 --> 00:57:23.030
I want to do that Taylor swift thing and I'll look over and his direction and

947
00:57:23.031 --> 00:57:23.864
I'll just whisper,

948
00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:31.830
did you ever see that thing on 60 minutes?
Would she,

949
00:57:31.831 --> 00:57:33.320
she would look into the upper deck,

950
00:57:33.321 --> 00:57:36.140
what all these girls were screaming and she would get this weird look on her

951
00:57:36.141 --> 00:57:38.870
face and then she would whisper,
oh my God.

952
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:43.610
And it was just this total calculated thing to try and make it appear that she

953
00:57:43.611 --> 00:57:48.560
was so blown away by their,
uh,
show of affection.

954
00:57:48.561 --> 00:57:52.990
But what it really seemed like
the look on her face.

955
00:57:52.991 --> 00:57:55.870
And then the fact she was saying,
Oh my God,
she actually looked like,

956
00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:57.410
<v 2>okay.</v>

957
00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:58.760
<v 1>She looked like she was thinking like,</v>

958
00:57:58.761 --> 00:58:02.720
I thought I already killed those little bastards.
They're back again.

959
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:05.670
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

960
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:10.290
<v 1>I,
you have to fucking poison them again.
Um,
but there you go.
Everybody.</v>

961
00:58:10.291 --> 00:58:14.670
I have my first,
I'm
single.

962
00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:16.710
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

963
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:21.420
<v 1>What is it?
Single white male.
Maybe we'll do a remake of the movie.
Hey,</v>

964
00:58:21.421 --> 00:58:26.140
you know what?
In that movie.
That chick was a red hat,
right?
Not Jesus.
Alright.

965
00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:28.230
Dutch girlfriend turns out to be a hawk.

966
00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.153
<v 2>Griffin.</v>

967
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:38.530
<v 1>Oh Man,
I feel bad for you,</v>

968
00:58:38.531 --> 00:58:43.531
but I don't feel bad for you provided you didn't get an STD and you didn't knock

969
00:58:43.901 --> 00:58:46.660
her up.
Oh,
Jesus.
All right,

970
00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:51.640
let's put on some latex and wade into this one.
Everybody dear bill,

971
00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.080
I live in the Netherlands.
Um,

972
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:59.830
I've been casually seeing this girl for a few months.
Her family is rich.

973
00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:05.130
She's a pro fashion model and it looks like Brigitte Bardot.

974
00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:09.930
I've heard that name,
but I can't picture the face with a name like that.
Right?

975
00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:14.920
She's gotta be all stuck up.
Huh?
Was there fucking perfect jeans?
Anyways,

976
00:59:14.921 --> 00:59:19.780
yesterday she told me that for the past few months she's been working as a
whore.

977
00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:25.750
How fucked up my mind that actually find that sexy on some level.
Um,

978
00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:29.070
high class on account of her looks and profession.

979
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:33.990
2000 euros for three hours.
10,000 euros for 24 hours.

980
00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:36.810
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

981
00:59:36.811 --> 00:59:39.300
Some guys slobbered all over you for 10,000 hours.

982
00:59:39.301 --> 00:59:41.160
How quickly did you have to break up with this girl?

983
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:46.020
I shouldn't make fun of this.
This is terrible.
Why?
Why is she tapping out?

984
00:59:46.021 --> 00:59:47.280
She's taking the easy way out here.

985
00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:48.550
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

986
00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:52.870
<v 1>You're already a model.
Everybody's rich.
Is she getting written out of the will?</v>

987
00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:54.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

988
00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:57.250
<v 1>She's freaking out like what do I do?
I've been rich my whole life.
Dot.</v>

989
00:59:57.251 --> 01:00:00.870
I'm not going to be,
oh,
suck it.
Oh,
well,

990
01:00:00.871 --> 01:00:02.820
why do I read when I continue reading here?

991
01:00:02.821 --> 01:00:07.821
The usual clientele is rich corporate assholes and idiots who save up and think

992
01:00:08.131 --> 01:00:12.390
paying ludicrous amounts of money.
We'll get them a better orgasm.

993
01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.680
I have absolutely no interest in seeing this girl anymore.

994
01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:20.880
She's not going to be the mother of my children.
Yeah,
no,
she's not yet.

995
01:00:20.881 --> 01:00:22.950
She's only told for other people.

996
01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:28.260
If I split after her telling me this secret,
she'll feel like a piece of trash.

997
01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.110
If you me like some puritan ass wipe.

998
01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:36.120
My real reason for running away is you can't ask her to quit and if she does,

999
01:00:36.121 --> 01:00:41.121
she'll only resent you for it and be at risk of relapsing any time I got to get

1000
01:00:41.341 --> 01:00:43.290
out.
How do I do it?
Well,
well,

1001
01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:46.380
what's you have to do is stop being concerned about her feelings.

1002
01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:48.180
What about your failings?

1003
01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.930
What about the fact that this woman is fucking around on you?

1004
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.250
What about the fact that she could give you an STD?
What about the fact that she,

1005
01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:00.480
that relationship is built on trust and she has this giant fucking secret,

1006
01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.000
arguably the biggest fucking secret you could have.

1007
01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:05.483
<v 2>You know,</v>

1008
01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:11.250
<v 1>I'm not judging anybody in this fucking story because I've been using when I've</v>

1009
01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:12.084
been the whore,

1010
01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:16.620
I'm just it from the whore.

1011
01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:20.610
I except I except to get fight expected to get fucking dumped.

1012
01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:25.710
You know,
it's plenty of man or is out there,
you know?
That's what happens.

1013
01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:31.020
Um,
yeah,
dude,
you got to stop thinking about it.
Like,

1014
01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:35.100
it's weird.
Like this is what you have to do.
You,
you have to get over the,
um,

1015
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:38.740
you have to be selfish in a fucking relationship to end up getting what you want

1016
01:01:38.741 --> 01:01:39.574
in life.
All right?

1017
01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:44.370
And you have to have parameters and you know,

1018
01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.640
to use the Cliche,
you know,
to make it home,
that you've got to break some eggs.

1019
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:52.710
That's basically what you gotta do.
And this is not your fault.
Um,

1020
01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.880
I don't know what happened her that made her choose this horrific fucking

1021
01:01:56.881 --> 01:02:01.410
profession,
but it's not your fault and it's not your job to fix it.

1022
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:07.590
And,
um,
you said it in your last two sentences.
I got to get out.

1023
01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:11.010
How do I do it?
Uh,
so I guess your second to last sentence you said it,

1024
01:02:11.011 --> 01:02:15.360
I got to get out.
So you just have,
you don't have to be mean about it.

1025
01:02:15.361 --> 01:02:19.920
You just have to say,
listen,
that's just a,
a unbelievable

1026
01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.160
<v 0>piece of information you just gave me that you were keeping from me.
And uh,</v>

1027
01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:30.270
uh,
Jesus Christ,
he's this guy.
You've got to use the Cliche,
you know,

1028
01:02:30.271 --> 01:02:34.470
relationships built on trust.
You know,
I'm not judging you.

1029
01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:38.550
I wish you weren't.
Maybe you know,
there's a part of her that might want,

1030
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:39.983
is probably,

1031
01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:43.140
I don't even tell you this because you might run to this cause it's easier,

1032
01:02:43.141 --> 01:02:48.080
but like,
you know,
I dunno.

1033
01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:48.841
Well this is what I would do.

1034
01:02:48.841 --> 01:02:51.810
I would break up with her and then also try to get our help to get her out of
it.

1035
01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:55.500
That's what I would do.
And by getting her help,

1036
01:02:55.501 --> 01:02:58.590
I would give her information where she can go,

1037
01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:03.720
she needs to handle this on her own because you have feelings for her and you

1038
01:03:03.721 --> 01:03:05.430
know that this isn't the mother of your kids.

1039
01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.020
And if you just keep hanging around with her,

1040
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:08.670
you're going to get sucked back into it again.

1041
01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:13.560
And now you have to trust somebody who lied to you at that fucking level.
And,
um,

1042
01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:18.780
that is just a fucking train wreck waiting to happen.
All right,
dude.

1043
01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:24.060
I would go get myself tested for everything on the under the fucking Sun.
And,

1044
01:03:24.061 --> 01:03:28.920
um,
that's it.
That's it.
And if she cries,

1045
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:33.690
I mean,
that's part of it.
And she brought it on herself.
It's not your fault.

1046
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:37.800
All right.
And I'm not trying to be mean or whatever.
I mean,

1047
01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.960
I don't know what happened to her that made her do that type of shit,

1048
01:03:39.961 --> 01:03:42.650
but that's not your fault.
Okay?
So why don't you go out there,

1049
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.920
find a great girl who isn't a horror on the side and go live your dreams,

1050
01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.740
all right?
And you know what?
You're going to dump yard.

1051
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:50.160
It's going to hurt for a little while,

1052
01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:52.530
even though you knew it was the right thing to do,

1053
01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.840
it's still supposed to hurt because you're a human being.

1054
01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:56.340
You just got to push through that.

1055
01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:01.590
Go to the gym right now of a couple of belts at the bar,

1056
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:06.360
but just stay in it.
Stay in that pain and you wait to,
that pain's gone.

1057
01:04:06.361 --> 01:04:10.680
And then you fucking go out and try to find somebody else in the meantime,

1058
01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:12.470
you know,
rub one out.
All right?

1059
01:04:17.350 --> 01:04:21.630
Okay.
Ordain my wedding a bill.

1060
01:04:21.631 --> 01:04:23.700
I'm getting married in October.
Yes,

1061
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:27.920
I'm getting in that line to lose half my shit.
Well,
Hey,
welcome to the club soda.

1062
01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.090
A strange request,

1063
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.670
but would you ordain my wedding or at least be my best man?
Uh,

1064
01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:38.700
what is ordained me?
You want me to go,
dude,

1065
01:04:38.701 --> 01:04:43.701
we are gathered here his day to join these two people in holy matrimony and the

1066
01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:49.350
eyes of God planted the Church next to you.

1067
01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:54.600
You fucking busted aspirated tube.
The um,
yeah.

1068
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:56.910
What kind of a man invites another man to a fucking wedding?

1069
01:04:57.210 --> 01:05:00.330
Don't ever do that to me again.
Okay.
I'll look past at one time.

1070
01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.870
Why the fuck would I want to go to a wedding?
You know,
actually,

1071
01:05:03.871 --> 01:05:06.210
you know what the reason why I didn't like to go to weddings in the past because

1072
01:05:06.211 --> 01:05:09.020
it put pressure on my relationship.
Now that we finally got married.
I,

1073
01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.400
there's no fucking pressure.
We're going to a marriage.

1074
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:16.730
Marriage will go into a wedding coming up and I'm fucking site.
You know,
I,

1075
01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:18.010
I already

1076
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.420
<v 1>did it.
I don't have a fucking problem.</v>

1077
01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:23.350
You sitting there eating fucking hors d'oeuvres,
dancing to the local motion,

1078
01:05:23.351 --> 01:05:25.420
whatever the fuck it is.
Just getting the habit.

1079
01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:27.430
I'm going to have a great fucking time for the first time.

1080
01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:31.000
You know what I might do you,
where is your wedding?
If I got a Gig in the area,

1081
01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:37.120
I got a Gig in the area,
I,
I might come over there.
Tell me where it is,

1082
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.140
who knows?
Stranger things have happened.
But then if I two years,

1083
01:05:41.141 --> 01:05:45.970
then I got to do everybody right.
Can I sell my DVDs at the end of your wedding?

1084
01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.890
Try it.
A couple of bits.
Um,
anyways,

1085
01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.870
MIT master two shifts.

1086
01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:57.550
It's till technology creates toughest tongue twister.

1087
01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:02.170
Ever dare bill literate.
How you fucking cunt.

1088
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:07.270
That's a great one.
Um,
thanks for the show.

1089
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.830
You are amazing.

1090
01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:12.280
Look at this about this person is buttering me up to make a complete ass of me.

1091
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:17.020
We all love the podcast and by far the best part is listening to you attempt to

1092
01:06:17.021 --> 01:06:18.310
reach spots and emails.
Yeah.

1093
01:06:18.311 --> 01:06:21.370
That's cause you're not happy or confident in your own life that you have to

1094
01:06:21.371 --> 01:06:24.820
watch somebody else fail.
That's what it is.
What does that say about it?

1095
01:06:24.821 --> 01:06:27.100
That's just more about you than it says about me.
All right,

1096
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.040
you guys aren't my real friends.
Um,

1097
01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:34.000
MIT recently created what they think is the toughest tongue twister ever.

1098
01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:37.450
Give it a shot.
This is what they're doing at Mit.

1099
01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.520
I couldn't get accepted there.
If you can say it 10 times fast,

1100
01:06:42.521 --> 01:06:47.080
you get a price.
I'll go fuck yourself.
What am I at?
Goddamn dancing monkey.

1101
01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:50.800
What is it?
Pad Kid.

1102
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:55.250
That's not even a,
well,
that doesn't even make sense.

1103
01:06:55.251 --> 01:06:58.190
Pad Kid poured curd pulled cod.

1104
01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.440
It shouldn't be that kid.
That kid poured curd pulled cod.

1105
01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:04.860
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1106
01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:08.320
<v 1>Pad Kid poured curd pulled cod.
Eh,
go fuck yourself.
Is this,</v>

1107
01:07:08.321 --> 01:07:11.070
this is my actually saying something dirty and I can't hear it right now.

1108
01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:16.190
I don't fucking know.
All right.
For those of you who have absolutely no life,

1109
01:07:16.191 --> 01:07:20.960
if you want to fucking try and do that,
I,
you know,
have fun.
Okay.

1110
01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:25.940
Book recommendation.
Um,
what are we up to here?
Hour and seven minutes.

1111
01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:30.320
Beautiful.
Hey.
Hey Billy burgundy balls
heard.

1112
01:07:30.321 --> 01:07:33.560
You mentioned that no country for old men is one of your favorite movies.

1113
01:07:33.561 --> 01:07:36.710
Mine too.
If you're looking for any good books to read,

1114
01:07:36.711 --> 01:07:41.540
I highly recommend anything by Carmack McCarthy.
I hope I said that right.

1115
01:07:41.541 --> 01:07:44.720
Carmax,
c a r m a c one word.
Mccarthy,

1116
01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:49.130
m a lowercase c a R t.
H y author of no country.

1117
01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.590
Carmack McCarthy.
Oh,
he wrote that.
I actually want to read the book.

1118
01:07:51.591 --> 01:07:56.120
No country for old men.
Uh,
he said,
I read said book after I saw the movie.

1119
01:07:56.121 --> 01:07:58.250
And even though they did a great job with the movie,

1120
01:07:58.251 --> 01:08:02.390
the book was still incredible.
Everything I've read for him was top notch,

1121
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:06.020
the border trilogy probably being my favorite.

1122
01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:11.270
If you hate easy going light on your low for stories with predictable happy

1123
01:08:11.271 --> 01:08:15.410
endings,
you'll dig his shit.
Come to Indianapolis and go,
fuck sir.

1124
01:08:15.411 --> 01:08:19.760
I came there last April.
Um,
all right.
You know what?

1125
01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:23.720
I will check that out.
I like him.
I make,
I make,

1126
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.720
you know what I'm going to do.
You know what I'm going to do people,

1127
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.650
I'm going to go to my website,
click on the podcast page,

1128
01:08:30.651 --> 01:08:34.430
and then I'm going to click on the Amazon banner in the corner,

1129
01:08:34.431 --> 01:08:38.990
which is gonna take me to Amazon because when you go to Amazon through us

1130
01:08:38.991 --> 01:08:43.550
here@billburr.com,
um,
it doesn't cost you any extra money,

1131
01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:48.350
costs you an extra click or your finger.
And,
um,

1132
01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.210
<v 2>okay,</v>

1133
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.760
<v 1>well,
you know,
whatever they,
you,
you know,</v>

1134
01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:54.140
you buy whatever you buy and then they kick it back to me.

1135
01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.840
They give me a little bit of a kickback.
That's what they do.

1136
01:08:56.930 --> 01:09:00.170
And then I take that money and I give it to a charity that isn't corrupt,

1137
01:09:00.171 --> 01:09:03.710
hopefully like the last one I was giving to what should evidently,

1138
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:05.900
and people saying is not exactly on the up and up.

1139
01:09:05.901 --> 01:09:07.610
So now I got to switch it to something else.

1140
01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.660
What kind of a fucking person does it and starts a goddamn charity.

1141
01:09:13.661 --> 01:09:17.650
Get show of fucking excited about it.
You think you'd make an,
you know,

1142
01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.210
and that's right up there with that pink lady,
man,
she's got her day in fucking,

1143
01:09:22.211 --> 01:09:26.440
something is coming.
I'd like to think.
I would like to thank.
Okay.

1144
01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.180
So anyways,
um,

1145
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:30.000
<v 2>okay.</v>

1146
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.130
<v 1>I guess that's the podcast for this week.
Once again,</v>

1147
01:09:32.131 --> 01:09:35.330
everybody check out the common threat clinic tour and uh,

1148
01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:39.960
all these guys are monster drummers and really unbelievable,
uh,

1149
01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:43.320
educators and drums.
And I'm telling you,
they've got websites,

1150
01:09:43.321 --> 01:09:44.550
they've got all kinds of stuff.

1151
01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.870
They got stuff to get your band's going and just all kinds of information was

1152
01:09:48.871 --> 01:09:53.700
phenomenal.
Um,
anyways,
that is the podcast for this this week.

1153
01:09:53.701 --> 01:09:55.440
I'm trying to think where am I going to be next?

1154
01:09:56.010 --> 01:10:01.010
Next thing I'm doing is I'm doing a a a casino gig in Minnesota on February 7th.

1155
01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:03.270
It's just outside of Minneapolis.

1156
01:10:03.271 --> 01:10:07.590
I have all the dates and other proper links up on my website,

1157
01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.180
[inaudible] dot com and once again,

1158
01:10:09.181 --> 01:10:11.280
I know I was given the people in Saskatchewan.
Shit,

1159
01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.750
I'm going to try to get out there.
Uh,
I really,
I absolutely blown away,

1160
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:21.470
blown away by the response to me finally touring Canada up there and uh,

1161
01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:25.800
I'm going to be bringing the lumber.
All right,

1162
01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:28.950
so I'll see you guys in a couple of months.
I got a nice run,

1163
01:10:28.951 --> 01:10:30.270
a dates going through jersey,

1164
01:10:30.271 --> 01:10:35.271
down into Maryland and into Virginia also in February and we got the Patrice

1165
01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:38.580
O'neil is second annual.

1166
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:43.500
I'm so proud to say that the second annual Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit on

1167
01:10:43.501 --> 01:10:47.850
February 18th in New York City.
It's already sold out.
But,
uh,

1168
01:10:47.851 --> 01:10:51.240
there aren't going to be ways that if you would like to contribute that we will

1169
01:10:51.241 --> 01:10:55.380
have.
I'm actually thinking about starting up an email where I can,
um,

1170
01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:59.160
you know,
get some more pictures of Patrice was maybe some,
you know,

1171
01:10:59.161 --> 01:11:00.900
some fan photos they took after.

1172
01:11:00.901 --> 01:11:04.860
I know he used to like going out and talking to people and uh,

1173
01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.020
I'm just really proud that we're doing it again this year,

1174
01:11:07.050 --> 01:11:09.120
helping out all the people that he was helping out.

1175
01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:14.130
And I'm keeping the memory of,
uh,
the

1176
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:17.850
<v 0>most amazing comic I ever saw live.
And that's not it.
That's not,</v>

1177
01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:22.140
I probably then,
I'm not exaggerating like this guy,
you know,

1178
01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:24.270
anything I highly recommend,

1179
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:28.540
any fucking thing that you can watch on youtube or download or anything by his

1180
01:11:28.541 --> 01:11:30.180
specials.
Uh,

1181
01:11:30.181 --> 01:11:34.110
if you have any sort of appreciation for comedy or just art in general.
He was,

1182
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:38.580
he was the best.
He made all of us look like little kids.
So,
uh,

1183
01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:39.810
the second annual one,
and I,

1184
01:11:39.811 --> 01:11:44.400
I hope to be doing this for as long as I'm around is going to be on February

1185
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.590
18th.
And like I said,
we will try to get some merged together.

1186
01:11:46.591 --> 01:11:49.040
We're trying to figure out what the fuck we're going to do for the fans that

1187
01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:52.830
couldn't make it there.
They're wanting to donate.
Um,
maybe have a donate button.

1188
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:53.521
Maybe bill,

1189
01:11:53.521 --> 01:11:55.860
maybe you could just figure out what the fuck it is instead of trying to

1190
01:11:55.861 --> 01:11:58.140
brainstorm on your podcast.
All right,
go fuck yourself.

1191
01:11:58.650 --> 01:12:01.020
I'll talk to you next week.
Oh,
Superbowl prediction.

1192
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:05.460
I said it last week and what to say it again this week?
I think,
uh,

1193
01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:10.980
Oh man,
I think I got to go with Seattle.
This something.

1194
01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:16.010
There's something about fucking Denver and how John Elway at the end of his

1195
01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:21.150
career solidified his name in history by fucking,

1196
01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:23.610
uh,
within those last two.
And now,
I don't know,

1197
01:12:23.611 --> 01:12:25.650
some weird that Peyton is playing for the Broncos.

1198
01:12:25.651 --> 01:12:27.180
That's the only thing that's making me nervous.

1199
01:12:27.181 --> 01:12:30.480
But I think the difference in the game is going to be Marshawn lynch.

1200
01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:35.550
And I think Denver is going to do a good job in the first half of doing,

1201
01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:39.060
you know,
the best you can to contain that unbelievable talent.

1202
01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.160
But I think that they get to wear him down.

1203
01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.440
I thought that Denver's defense looked a little,

1204
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.900
I don't know if they were tired or what,

1205
01:12:45.901 --> 01:12:50.220
but I was not liking the fact if I'm a betting man,

1206
01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:53.910
the way they let San Diego in New England hang around even after they totally

1207
01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:57.360
fucking dominated them for the first two,
three quarters.

1208
01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.850
So I think Marshawn lynch is going to be the difference.

1209
01:12:59.851 --> 01:13:03.390
He's going to chew up some clock and a pig man.

1210
01:13:03.391 --> 01:13:07.620
He's going to be standing there on the sidelines with that look on his face.

1211
01:13:07.621 --> 01:13:11.790
Like he got to be fucking shitting me.
Not again.
Um,
but having said that,

1212
01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.550
I actually really liked both teams and um,

1213
01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:19.080
I actually all the Shit I've talked about Peyton over the years,
you know,

1214
01:13:19.081 --> 01:13:22.320
really sticking up for Brady made me not like Payton,
you know,

1215
01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:26.520
it's not like I know the guy.
I actually would love to see him win another one.

1216
01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:32.040
But I would also like to finally see Seattle's fans actually have something to

1217
01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:33.330
cheer about loudly,

1218
01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:38.790
like a championship as opposed to that with the best dressed where the most

1219
01:13:38.791 --> 01:13:42.120
spirited with allowed us to fucking horseshit that they've started.

1220
01:13:42.121 --> 01:13:46.740
And you did start that.
Okay.
So know that,
know that,

1221
01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:52.160
that you started that and when you see it in the future that it started in your

1222
01:13:52.201 --> 01:13:55.980
fucking coffee making God damn city.
Oh,
by the way,

1223
01:13:56.010 --> 01:13:57.240
did anybody see,

1224
01:13:57.450 --> 01:14:02.450
and this is why I don't like that Sherman talk and Shit fucking horseshit after

1225
01:14:03.631 --> 01:14:07.950
a game.
I really,
I,
I'm that old white guy that thinks it's absolutely classic,

1226
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:12.250
classless.
Um,
can I say it right?
Classless and,

1227
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:16.870
and just what it teaches children.
And I can tell you right now,

1228
01:14:16.871 --> 01:14:21.871
did anybody see that Justin Bieber video of him playing one on one with his

1229
01:14:22.661 --> 01:14:27.420
black friend that he paid to lose during the youtube video that anybody watched

1230
01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:30.490
that?
I can't even remember what the fuck I saw it.

1231
01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.660
I can't remember if it was on the news or if I watched it online,

1232
01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.800
but he sinks his shot.
He's filming himself.

1233
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:43.830
He sinks his shot and he turns around and gives this look to the video camera is

1234
01:14:46.271 --> 01:14:49.600
he walks all the way back to take the ball out again.

1235
01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:54.630
If you see the look on this fucking hundred and 40 pound jack asses face and I

1236
01:14:56.981 --> 01:14:58.180
can't even get mad at him,

1237
01:14:58.210 --> 01:15:03.210
he learned it by watching these fucking idiots who hit layups and you know,

1238
01:15:04.091 --> 01:15:08.710
thought that chest and do that 300 fucking yell after everything that they do.

1239
01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:11.980
It's the dumbest

1240
01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.070
people literally fighting and wars like fucking Rambo taken out three people at

1241
01:15:18.071 --> 01:15:22.150
once.
After they do that,
they don't fucking turn around and give a look.

1242
01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:26.890
Why don't you hit a fucking the kid?

1243
01:15:26.891 --> 01:15:31.891
It's like a 10 foot turns around and he looks like he's like,

1244
01:15:32.421 --> 01:15:37.190
dislike it.
I never even saw Jordan do that.
He stared down some people,

1245
01:15:37.191 --> 01:15:37.791
absolutely.

1246
01:15:37.791 --> 01:15:41.120
But after what he dunked on Patrick Ewing and some other six foot 10 guy,

1247
01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:46.670
that's what I don't like about it.
And I see it just,

1248
01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:47.850
<v 2>yeah,</v>

1249
01:15:47.850 --> 01:15:48.271
<v 0>the kids,</v>

1250
01:15:48.271 --> 01:15:51.420
they learn it and then all of a sudden they're playing the fucking game and I

1251
01:15:51.421 --> 01:15:55.380
got to sit there and every time somebody hits a layup or catches a four yard

1252
01:15:55.381 --> 01:15:58.980
pass for a first down,
they got to act like they reinvented the game.

1253
01:15:58.981 --> 01:16:02.730
And I never saw Jerry Rice.
Wayne Gretzky.
I mean,

1254
01:16:02.731 --> 01:16:05.880
I've seen some magic Johnson.
I never saw do that.

1255
01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:10.710
Jesus Christ act like you fucking been there the before you goddamn idiots.
I,

1256
01:16:10.711 --> 01:16:14.640
I dunno.
I swear to God.
If everybody starts doing it,

1257
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:17.970
I'm going to get into needlepoint.
All right.
You know what?

1258
01:16:17.971 --> 01:16:22.530
Maybe that'll call me down.
Maybe it'll help me with my fucking Tampa.
All right,

1259
01:16:22.531 --> 01:16:24.360
I'll talk to you next week.
Go Fuck Yourself.
