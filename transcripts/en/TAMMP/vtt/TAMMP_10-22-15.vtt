00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.730
Hey,
what's going on is bill burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:08.160
Monday morning podcast just before Thursday.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.190
And I am just checking in on you.

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.420
Okay.
Now I know you just appointed,
you're like bill,
Bill,

5
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:18.840
you're usually yell like a maniac.
Usually act like a fucking idiot.
Well,

6
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:23.841
it's like eight 30 in the morning and I'm in a hotel room and a bar.

7
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.390
You're just going to have to deal with that.
All right then.

8
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.980
Don't act like a fucking baby about it.
I swear to God,
I'll make it up to you.

9
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.290
I feel like I'm talking to a child right now.
You know?

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.470
And you guys didn't even say anything.
You probably,
yeah.

11
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.500
You know I'm arrived at every once in a while,
Bill.
If you don't,

12
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.370
if he all chuck and Ami crazily,
you know,

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.500
on a Thursday or whatever.
Um,
I am in Columbus,
Ohio

14
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.300
and all I can tell you about Columbus,
Ohio is when you want something to eat.

15
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.900
When you go out of your fucking hotel room,
don't go right.

16
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.010
Go left at least wherever the fuck I'm staying.

17
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.583
I went to the right.

18
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.440
Can we get one of the shittiest fucking lunches I've ever had I order of it was

19
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:14.730
this little fucking Bistro to second place is calling themselves a B.

20
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:18.660
Stroh is if like,
Ooh,
this is sort of a taste of Perry here.

21
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.920
This is going to be like you're in Paris,
but you were in Columbus,
Ohio,
who?

22
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.920
Some fucking base stroke type thing,
right?
I order,
I ordered some fuck.
Oh,
well,

23
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.800
one of them.
Tomato,
Mozzarella,
fucking salads.
So the doe goes to me.

24
00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:35.880
He goes,
hey,
you want the Balsamic vinegarette on the side?
And I said,

25
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:40.881
I'd love that because I fucking hate balsamic vinegarette on a tomato Mozzarella

26
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:44.340
fucking salad.
I don't even know why it's in there.

27
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.060
<v 1>It just puts some fucking olive oil on it.
A little salt
on it.</v>

29
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.200
Bell pepper.
Maybe that's it.
Simple clean,
classic,

30
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.270
classic Italian cuisine.
Couple,
two,
three ingredients,
and it tastes like heaven,

31
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.050
right?
Greatest fucking cooks on earth.
What are these cons too?

32
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.530
They put the Balsamic vinegarette on the side.

33
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.060
They put the tomato in the fucking Mozzarella they put,

34
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.830
they put it on this iceberg lettuce,
which I can forgive you,
whatever.

35
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.640
God knows I need to eat a fucking salad out here.
Right?

36
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.010
Being on the road for two weeks.

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.650
And then for whatever fucking reason they took this creamy fucking dressing,

38
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.370
it just poured it all over the cheese and the tomatoes.

39
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.480
Why would you put fucking creamy dressing over creamy cheese?

40
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.580
Why would you do that?

41
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.870
He's supposed to add ingredients to compliment the other thing.

42
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:44.370
Not fucking reinforce it.

43
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.390
Like two parents yelling at you because you took the car out and wrapped it

44
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:53.100
around a tree.
Then I understand it.
These aren't two parents.
All right,

45
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.450
this is some tomato when some folk a Mozzarella

46
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.890
completely fucked that up.
And I also ordered a cup of Chili,
right?

47
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.440
Cause I'm an old white guy and that's what we do when we get,

48
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.370
we started approaching the age of 50 we start eating soup,
you know,

49
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.790
because that's our only hope it continues to live in,
right?

50
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:15.910
So I ordered this cup of Chili with the broth was his water.

51
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:19.780
It was just like fucking water with a little bit of hamburger helper.

52
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.810
My God,
the place drove me,
not nice people.

53
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:26.830
They're very nice people fucking work there.
Jesus fucking Christ,

54
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.580
one of these fucking places.
You walk in and there's like two registers.

55
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.510
So I walk up to the first one and I say to the guy and go,
hey,

56
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.240
can I order food from here?

57
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.140
And he just nods so I fucking start ordering food.

58
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.950
And then the fucking manager,
God comes over,
he goes,
oh,
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.010
The way it worked is you got to go to this fucking registered down here.

60
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:48.844
He didn't say fucking,

61
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.190
you're going to go down on that register there and order your food.

62
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.570
And then he'd come over here and pay and I'm looking at the fucking guy behind

63
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:57.910
the register looking like two did.
I just asked you that.

64
00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:01.960
And he's just staring at me blankly like,
all right.
So I fucking go down there,

65
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.020
meet the person making the food fucking sweet out of a guy as it's doing,

66
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.080
you know,
I don't Blah Blah Blah.
I order the shit now.

67
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.340
I go to walk back down to fucking pay at the register and some conscious walks

68
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:19.090
off the street.
It walks up to that register in order as a cup of coffee,

69
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.130
right?
And then servicing the guy.
So now I'm behind him.

70
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.440
It's that kind of fucked as this work.
Oh,
and this one,

71
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:31.150
you just pay cash or you order coffee.

72
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:33.940
So now this fucking guy who wasn't in front of me is now some out in front of
me.

73
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:37.600
I don't understand it.
I don't fucking understand it.

74
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.250
And then I sit down and go to eat the shit.

75
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:42.280
It was one of those deals where I had to take the knife and I'm scraping the

76
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:45.190
fucking awful shit off of the shit that you want to eat.

77
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.630
And I'm not going to lie to you.
It put me in a mood.
I'll put me in a mood.

78
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.240
I was going to be like,
you know what?
Fuck Columbus.

79
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.160
Fuck this whole fucking state.

80
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.880
And he fucking state that puts creamy dressing on Nice fucking hunk.

81
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.610
So mood sedan.
I'm fucking Outta here.

82
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.400
I don't need to have a come back.
Right.

83
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.130
But the evening was saved by an unbelievable crowd,

84
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.110
a beautiful fucking theater.
And,
uh,
we ended up going to this bar late night,

85
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.940
uh,
the elevator and a great bartender,

86
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.900
Pittsburgh guy.
And it means a couple of fucking drinks.

87
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:25.570
We just laughing our balls off,
telling whole coke and stories.

88
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.250
And then we ended the night up watching the beginning of good fellas on the bus

89
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:35.080
and then they called it a fucking night.
I don't be in a whiny cunt,
but why,

90
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:39.040
why would you do that?
Perfectly good fucking food.
You know what I mean?

91
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.350
Well,
why would you do that?
Um,

92
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.340
the fuck was I just going to talk about in there.
I spaced on something.

93
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.600
Tomato the moots or Ale fucking Dan.
Yeah,

94
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.400
let me know
and I'll follow.
You know what,
somebody from after the,
uh,

95
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.380
after the show came up to me and,
uh,
he,

96
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.490
he gave me,

97
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.610
I want to thank the person who once again he got me this drum DVD that Joe,

98
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:11.810
Joe Mayor,
you know,
top secret stuff for the,
uh,
the modern drummer,

99
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.470
basically all that molar method stuff.
Uh,
it's really fucking nice to you.

100
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.450
And when I was in Cincinnati,
uh,
somebody interviewed me,
a comedian,

101
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:24.050
Muhammad came,
I got me some Pete rose tee shirts.

102
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.370
I got you backstage passes young buck comedian.
I didn't,

103
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:30.800
you never came back.
I hope you made it out to the show.

104
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.010
I double checked that they had your name at the door.
I hope you fucking made it.

105
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.840
Now I'm all fucking paranoid.

106
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.380
They didn't let you in and you hook me up with some tee shirts and you like that

107
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:42.860
fucking bill burrs to biggest Fred had had contact ever met in my life.

108
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.940
Um,
so anyways,
here we've been having a great time.

109
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:48.290
We had a great time to Cincinnati.

110
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.900
I'm trying to think where the fuck we been since I last talked to you guys.

111
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.610
See it was Fort Wayne,
Cincinnati.

112
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:58.170
Then we did Dayton dirty Dayton.

113
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.460
They called their fucking town that 30 day or something like that.
I was going,

114
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:06.000
why the fuck would you call yourself to,

115
00:07:06.001 --> 00:07:09.260
and this is why you don't get any tourism here.
You know,

116
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.390
I don't fucking know.
Whatever.
I've been having a great time and I'm

117
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.950
at keeps getting fucking,
I think,
oh actually been doing too much time,

118
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:21.170
but doing like an hour and a half for the last couple of nights.

119
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.290
I got to tighten it up a little bit.
But um,

120
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.210
what do I get tonight?
I got Pittsburgh and then I got Cleveland and that's,

121
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.820
that's the first leg than the first leg is fucking done.
Just like that.

122
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:38.270
The first week is over.
But last night when I was on stage,

123
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.530
my beloved Boston Bruins,
my fucking hat dude,

124
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.750
they paid the filthy flyers in the fucking new Boston Garden,

125
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:51.680
the Td Bank,
fucking JP Morgan Center,

126
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:54.800
whatever the fuck they call it.
You know,

127
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.720
those 40,000 cinder blocks that they went out and bought and built a big square

128
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:04.640
building.
Nothing interesting.
Architecturally speaking,

129
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.000
there are only one of the original six teams.
Why would you give them a fucking,

130
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:11.000
you know,
the Columbus blue jackets should have a better facility.

131
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.980
The Minnesota wild should have a better looking fucking ranked than the Boston

132
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.980
Bruins.
That completely makes sense.
Right.
You know,
Geez.
Um,

133
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.930
I'm going to rewind.
Well,
after this tour,
I'm Mexican and watch the game.

134
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.150
I did watch the highlights and um,

135
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.660
as much as a fucking brutal heartbreaker that was that they,

136
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.310
they lost in overtime.
We did get a point and a,

137
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:38.480
as far as I was watching with the highlights,
we look,
uh,
you know,

138
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:42.200
we look like a fucking decent team and I was really nervous about that,

139
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:45.350
so I'm happy with it.
These guys are still fucking Gel and that came,

140
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:48.740
I can tell you right now as a game,
we would have lost a week ago.

141
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.860
You know what I mean?
You know,
maybe a week and a half ago and guys,

142
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:53.720
we're still getting to know each other or whatever.

143
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.700
The fact that we just blew it and overtime I feel as a step forward,
right?

144
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.630
<v 2>Ooh.</v>

145
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.110
<v 1>Um,
I was actually on the bus and I saying,
well,
what's the score?</v>

146
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.980
Cause it fucking satellite thing wasn't working and adverse.
He looked it up set.

147
00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:13.870
It was a,
you know,
four to two and I was so fucking excited,

148
00:09:13.871 --> 00:09:16.820
but I also knew there was like 13 minutes left and I was like,
oh Jesus,

149
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.800
42 we'd been up three games to none against these guys and couldn't fucking

150
00:09:20.801 --> 00:09:25.600
close it up.
God Damn filthy flyers.
Gay Men,
congratulations to them.

151
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.510
You know,
they were supposed to suck this year,
won't they?
Bruins and out.

152
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:33.550
Well maybe we just to shitty teams passing in the night.

153
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.800
I have no idea.
I don't think was shitty though.
Speaking and not shitty.

154
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:42.000
I bought those fucking Canadians
seven and Oh,

155
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.010
do you know what actually bothers me as a Bruins fan?

156
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.310
Knowing how happy Canadian fans,
I don't hate the Canadians.

157
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.420
I've realized that over the years,
it was never about the Canadians.

158
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.390
It was about this silly sock where in French,

159
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.650
French frenchies up there and join yet another Stanley Cup victory.

160
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:04.060
And I got to tell you,
I've completely enjoyed the,
the,

161
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.800
the 20 something year drought of your Stanley Cups.
And uh,

162
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.720
even I as a,
as a,
as a fucking Canadian hater got to say,

163
00:10:13.721 --> 00:10:17.020
this is easily the most scared.

164
00:10:17.021 --> 00:10:20.380
I've been in fucking over 20 years and you guys were going to fucking end the

165
00:10:20.381 --> 00:10:22.480
drought.
Um,

166
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.810
God knows we're not going to be the ones to stop you.

167
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:32.420
So I'm rooting for the fucking West to be a monster of a fuck.

168
00:10:32.811 --> 00:10:37.390
It's somebody out there to be another black hawks.
Got To do it again.

169
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.870
Who knows?
Uh,
speaking of which,

170
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:46.050
my condolences to the a Chicago cub fan and congratulations to the mats and,

171
00:10:47.531 --> 00:10:50.440
uh,
you know,
I had half an eye on that fucking series.

172
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.950
I've been traveling around in Jesus Christ.
Um,

173
00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.340
I don't think there's ever been an easier MVP trophy to,

174
00:11:00.341 --> 00:11:04.780
uh,
to be given out than to give it to fucking Daniel Murphy,

175
00:11:04.781 --> 00:11:08.200
Jesus Christ.
I didn't even realize,
I knew he had some fucking home runs.

176
00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:11.740
I didn't realize he hits six games in a fucking row.
That's ridiculous.

177
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:17.170
That's from a second baseman man.
Unfucking believable.
So,

178
00:11:17.171 --> 00:11:21.880
uh,
I really wish I had time to watch that series.
I had no fucking idea.

179
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:26.950
Um,
and I'm glad I didn't see the Clo.
I guess it wasn't a,
the new Shea stadium,

180
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.660
you know,
cause I'll tell you,
them panning around the crowd when,
uh,

181
00:11:32.661 --> 00:11:36.280
the cubs were going down three games to none or whatever the fuck it was.

182
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.480
That reminded me a long time ago,
you know,

183
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.830
when the red sox were going through their shit.
So,
uh,
that sucks for them,

184
00:11:44.831 --> 00:11:49.000
but they're a young team.
They could get better next year.
Poo who?
Um,

185
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.480
but you know,
really quickly,
by the way,

186
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.100
you know what really fucking annoyed me was the amount of cubs fans that fucking

187
00:11:56.101 --> 00:11:57.500
filed out of that stadium.

188
00:11:58.740 --> 00:11:59.000
<v 3>Okay.</v>

189
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.910
<v 1>Jesus fucking Christ.
Half the fucking stadium left.</v>

190
00:12:01.911 --> 00:12:04.700
And I've always maintained that,
that for every fucking team,

191
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:09.110
half the people there are actually true fans.
The rest of them just show up.

192
00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.850
You know,
like all those fucking country met fans that have caught met fever,

193
00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.200
you know,

194
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.010
where were you a couple of years ago when they sucked for fucking 10 years?

195
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:20.401
Where were,

196
00:12:20.401 --> 00:12:24.770
you know what you were at home with the girlfriend sitting there watching

197
00:12:24.771 --> 00:12:28.430
fucking survivor or something like that.
Like,
dude,
I'm,
I'm not watching the mets.

198
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.030
Uh,
can't a kid of the biggest myths fan or can't fuck you.

199
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.830
Where the fuck were you?
Right.

200
00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.950
I can say that about the important teams to all these fucking Patriot fans where

201
00:12:37.951 --> 00:12:40.670
to fuck with you.
And we used to play in that high school football stadium,

202
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.450
but those a little bit of benches and you stood up and you've fucking lost his

203
00:12:44.451 --> 00:12:48.710
seat.
Where were you?
Where were you?
You were at home.
I've been so fucking

204
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.490
<v 3>chowder.
Um,</v>

205
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.410
<v 1>so anyways,
you know,
my dumb ass is going to do,
you know,</v>

206
00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.940
like I couldn't be watching any more fucking sports is my life is whizzing by.

207
00:13:00.941 --> 00:13:03.460
I think I'm going to get the NBA package this year.
I don't know why.

208
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.550
I just think the Celtics are going to be fun to watch this year and I,
you know,

209
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:11.710
I'd never been a big basketball fit.
You know,
I just,
I,
I can't get into it.

210
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:14.470
It's like they score every fucking three seconds.

211
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.180
Anytime anybody looks at anybody.
It's a fucking filed.
I,
you know,

212
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.550
it's kind of like soccer except you can use your hands,

213
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.550
except there's also a ton of scoring.
It's not that obviously it's not that bad.

214
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.960
Um,
I don't know.
I think I liked college hoops better,
but whatever.
Hey,

215
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.270
by the way,
um,

216
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.780
as far as my workout regimen by go to the gym every day,
you know what?

217
00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:42.400
I also have been eating like a fucking,

218
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:44.570
<v 3>okay.</v>

219
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.850
<v 1>Uh,
I been eating like a fat girl on Prom night.</v>

220
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.100
How come nobody took me?
Um,

221
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.160
what did I have to go up to fat girls?

222
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.520
Maybe I could say I was eating like a redhead,
a redheaded mail on prom night.

223
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.250
<v 3>I don't know.
Um,</v>

224
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.550
<v 1>oh my God,
I've been eating like a fucking animal.</v>

225
00:14:04.551 --> 00:14:06.320
I've also been working out like an animal,

226
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.290
so I've gone up one notch and the old belt there,
but uh,

227
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.560
that's kind of been my game plan because every night I say I'm not going to

228
00:14:12.561 --> 00:14:16.040
drink and I'm not going to act like a fucking idiot.
But,
uh,

229
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.100
I'm hanging out with my three best friends in the fucking world on this tour.

230
00:14:19.101 --> 00:14:21.950
You know,
what are we going to do?
And it's always every night,

231
00:14:21.951 --> 00:14:24.080
right before the show,
we always say the same thing too.

232
00:14:24.081 --> 00:14:27.590
When are going to go easy tonight,
you know,
we're going to go easy and uh,

233
00:14:27.591 --> 00:14:32.270
you know,
fucking you don't,
we've got Pittsburgh tomorrow night.

234
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.150
It's Columbus,
you know,
it's going to be quiet town after the show.
Let's,
she's,

235
00:14:35.151 --> 00:14:38.330
let's just fucking go home.
All right?
And everybody goes,
yeah,
yeah.
Good idea.

236
00:14:38.331 --> 00:14:41.730
Good idea.
Right?
Then what happens?
You know,
somebody just gives one,

237
00:14:41.731 --> 00:14:43.220
somebody look,
you know

238
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.960
somebody last night it was [inaudible] first he gave me look,
just going like,
uh,

239
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.440
so what do you think?
You know,
he was done with the set.
I hadn't gone on yet.

240
00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:56.440
You know?
What do you think it's maybe a going back to the hotel,

241
00:14:56.530 --> 00:15:00.460
just calling it a night and then I just start laughing and he starts laughing

242
00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:02.560
and the next thing you know,
we stay out till fucking three in the morning,

243
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.180
like assholes.
Fucking assholes.
Who likes,
who likes working out?

244
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:08.703
Honestly,

245
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.460
I'm sure you like it in your twenties but at my age it's not a fun thing to do.

246
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.280
And I go on,
I work out,

247
00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:20.740
I do all his fucking sweating and fucking my old God damn knees and all this

248
00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:25.270
shit.
And then what do I do?
I give it away,
you know?

249
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.240
Come back here.
We need a sleeve of fucking Oreo cookies.

250
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.020
I'm thinking of the back of my head like,
what am I doing?

251
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.320
Literally two of these fucking cookies.

252
00:15:35.321 --> 00:15:38.770
That's probably 40 minutes.

253
00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.820
How many calories are in a fucking Oreo cookie?
Oh my God,
dude,

254
00:15:42.821 --> 00:15:44.950
yesterday when I bought the Oreo cookies,
right?

255
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.610
Am I already hated myself already fat shaming myself.

256
00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.390
It's like the middle of the day two.
I bought him a broad day light,

257
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.050
wherever I felt like everybody was looking at me.
Go look it up,

258
00:15:56.051 --> 00:15:58.150
look at him eating his cookies,
right?

259
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.110
And I go walking by and there was this Asian Dude,
right?

260
00:16:02.111 --> 00:16:04.420
I don't know where he was from,
but uh,

261
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.390
he was definitely an immigrant because he had the hardcore fucking accident,

262
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.600
right?
Just one of these fucking guys made you smile.

263
00:16:10.601 --> 00:16:13.930
You had great fucking energy.
And he just went like,
oh,
hello.
How are,
you know,

264
00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:18.580
he's fucking cleaning up vacuum in Assam Shit,
right?
Classic immigrant job.

265
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.750
And I say,
how you doing man?
How's it going?
He goes up,
do I go do?

266
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.330
Then he just goes and sees the cookies.
He just goes,

267
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.210
I hope I'm going to be able to do it.
I smoked a cigar last night.

268
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.000
He looks at the cookers and you just goes,
Oreo.

269
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.710
And I just started fucking last.
And I go,
yeah man,

270
00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:43.840
I got some Oreos and it goes,

271
00:16:43.841 --> 00:16:47.800
all those are my favorites and I'm laughing going,
I love him too.

272
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.970
But it sounded like he was shitting on me the way he went or real.
It's like,

273
00:16:51.971 --> 00:16:56.410
you fucking bitch,
you bringing cookies back there.
There's sugar,
tits,

274
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.140
dude,
it made my fucking afternoon.

275
00:16:59.141 --> 00:17:03.520
He was such a fucking funny guy and he wasn't being a bad guy.

276
00:17:03.521 --> 00:17:06.820
That's what I loved about him.
He was actually,

277
00:17:06.821 --> 00:17:11.080
he was more saying it like a big black or like,
hey,
right,

278
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.550
like that's what I'm talking about.
What I love was,

279
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:20.200
it was just me and him in the lobby and they had a big ceiling and it was like

280
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.510
echoed when he did it.
Oreo.

281
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.480
I went upstairs and I sit down like a fucking loser and I start eating with a

282
00:17:30.221 --> 00:17:34.990
sleeve of cookies with his voice ringing in my head and I was laughing,

283
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.530
eating the cookies and I swear to God for one second I almost started crying.

284
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.640
There's no way.

285
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:48.040
If you're any sort of a human being to sit in a hotel room by yourself and need

286
00:17:48.041 --> 00:17:53.041
a sleeve of Oreo and not just feel a wave of depression wash over you.

287
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.630
It's one of the saddest things you can ever do.
If you've noticed,

288
00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.940
I can't even know.
I don't even know if they even have,

289
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.930
do they even have commercials for Oreos?
Do they even need to?

290
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.010
You know what I mean?
It's like the Jordan of fucking cookies.

291
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.950
As far as none other than the ones your mom makes or something,
you know,

292
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.300
you know,
some lonely cut like me makes a homemade are going to be better,

293
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:17.790
but it's just as far as like store bought cookies.
Okay,

294
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.440
let's start a battle here.
Right?
Let's start a debate.
C'Mon.

295
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.660
Are you guys aren't a sea going to sit there and tell him he can fuck with Oreo

296
00:18:24.661 --> 00:18:26.970
cookies?
It is.
It is.

297
00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.330
It's the perfect fucking cookie.

298
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.600
And you know what kills me is when you bite off one side and then you bite off

299
00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:34.500
another side,
another one,

300
00:18:34.501 --> 00:18:37.230
you stick them together to make your own double stuff on.

301
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.830
Why does that one taste so much better than the actual double stuff?

302
00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:44.460
One that's doing the work for you.
You know what I mean?

303
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.200
When you buy the double stuff once it's just like it,

304
00:18:49.201 --> 00:18:52.440
there's too much of the cream in it,
you know,

305
00:18:52.441 --> 00:18:55.380
and it just too sugary and you can't fucking eat them.

306
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.850
But when you do the other ones,

307
00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.520
I don't know who the fuck is in charge of that over there at Oreo.

308
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.470
Just dial back the frosting.

309
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.650
You went a little too fucking hard and it's not ringing God damn true.

310
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.900
Um,
without a doubt that my,

311
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.070
my favorite fucking cookie and uh,

312
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.820
was it territo says you can't just have one fucked to raise by the way,

313
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.320
everybody,
you know what?
You know what Doritos are?
I'm 47 years old.

314
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:27.530
Anybody under the age of light 40 Doritos or this shit original Doritos,

315
00:19:29.341 --> 00:19:32.760
you cannot fuck with them.
They're considered the greatest chip of all time.

316
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.970
I grew up on,
I grew up on Fritos.

317
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.800
Ruffles like Pringles are still new to me.

318
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.140
Like when those things first came out and they stacked them up and that can
like,

319
00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.740
we would just like to what that,
what that was like when,
for my generation,

320
00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:51.750
that was like when playstation first came out,

321
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:56.940
tap potato chips that you could actually stack up,
you know,

322
00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.920
to have like fucking 300 potato chips that are actually on the same page.

323
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.800
You know what I mean?
As opposed to the usual one.
You open up a bag,

324
00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:07.020
they're all going a different direction.
You know,

325
00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:10.860
like some fucking team with a coach lost the locker room,
right?

326
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.820
Pringles,
a the fucking New England patriots.

327
00:20:14.821 --> 00:20:19.350
They got a system and everybody does their fucking job and they get it done

328
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.640
right.
And they're so God damn good about it.
The crying coats,

329
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:28.680
coats got to fucking talk about air pressure.
By the way,

330
00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:32.020
I watched this fucking thing.
Uh,
yesterday,
one of those 30 for thirties,

331
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.710
on a old pistol,
Pete Carroll at the,
uh,
when he coached for USC.

332
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:41.370
Dude,
I can't fucking believe I missed,
I missed that whole era.

333
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.500
I don't think I watched one fucking game.

334
00:20:43.501 --> 00:20:48.500
I was so busy traveling to all of these,
I'm going to right now,

335
00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.710
which by the way is bring it back a ton of memories.
Um,

336
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.090
I remember I went to an Ohio state game against like,

337
00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.840
I can't remember who the fuck they play the game with a B
wasn't,

338
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:06.200
believe me,
it wasn't Boise state.
It was just some fucking shit.

339
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.430
Head team,
division three way back in the day,

340
00:21:10.431 --> 00:21:13.250
those classic cupcake games.
I went to it by myself.

341
00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:18.140
I fucking came here and I went into their old basketball arena where the band

342
00:21:18.141 --> 00:21:20.700
plays before the game.
And I went into the horseshoe,

343
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.040
which isn't a horse shoe anymore.

344
00:21:22.041 --> 00:21:24.950
Nobody really has a horse shoe unless you're fucking programs.
Thanks again.

345
00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.480
They got to build,
you know,

346
00:21:26.481 --> 00:21:29.210
they've got to keep adding onto the stadium because people keep fucking right

347
00:21:29.211 --> 00:21:31.910
and there's too many God damn people and there's traffic.
24,
seven,

348
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.940
we got to have enough extra seats to put these animals right.

349
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:39.530
And I went to the game by myself.
Um,
I have a lot of memories of that.

350
00:21:39.531 --> 00:21:41.670
I'm going to go to Milwaukee.
I,

351
00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:45.860
I've been to county stadium and the Miller Park.

352
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.640
I've been to both of those by myself.
I still remember at Miller Park would,

353
00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:50.750
somebody took my picture.

354
00:21:50.751 --> 00:21:54.350
I had him take my picture on one of those little fucking disposable cameras and

355
00:21:54.351 --> 00:21:56.540
they did the thing where they took it from my neck up.

356
00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.670
And like the top of the picture is like the entire fucking stadium and the,

357
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.010
and the roof of it.
Just one of the worst pictures of all time.

358
00:22:04.011 --> 00:22:07.490
Actually just laughed.
I got a stack of those somewhere,
like little,

359
00:22:07.491 --> 00:22:11.750
those little fucking five by eight printouts that you get when you took it to

360
00:22:11.751 --> 00:22:16.370
the,
uh,
the drug store to get them developed of me standing in front of about 40

361
00:22:16.371 --> 00:22:19.940
different stadiums that no longer exist.
Um,

362
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.730
let me see if I can go through some of them.
Let's see.
Okay.

363
00:22:25.731 --> 00:22:29.270
I've been to Olympia stadium,
one of the fuck that was for an expos game.

364
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.010
That still exists,

365
00:22:31.011 --> 00:22:36.011
but the expos don't Miller park the kingdom.

366
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.630
<v 0>Okay.</v>

367
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:43.240
<v 1>Uh,
the Astro Dome Mile High Stadium,</v>

368
00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:48.050
Sullivan Stadium,
the Boston Garden.

369
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.870
Jesus Christ.
I even took a tour of fucking maple leaf garden by myself,

370
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.230
one on this fucking tour.
It's one of the cool tours I took.

371
00:22:58.231 --> 00:23:02.340
I aim to fucking older my be all these fucking place candlestick

372
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.830
the fuck else did I go Mick Nichols arena.
It's where the nuggets played.

373
00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:11.200
I went there by myself doing a college gig

374
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.870
watching the fucking Denver Nuggets and they were terrible.

375
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.350
That was one of those deals.
And they were barely in the fucking leave.

376
00:23:20.351 --> 00:23:25.190
I saw an avalanche game there too,
before they built the Pepsi Center.

377
00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.770
Um,
the Old Dallas Cowboys Stadium.

378
00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.000
I,
I,
you know,
one of these days I,

379
00:23:34.001 --> 00:23:37.650
I gotta make a list of all the fucking stadiums I've been to that no longer

380
00:23:37.651 --> 00:23:41.370
fucking exist.
And not only did I go there,

381
00:23:41.371 --> 00:23:44.010
I went there by myself.
But anyways,

382
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:50.150
let's plow ahead here.
So,
um,
yeah,
I do too.

383
00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:52.460
I just been working out and eating like a fucking moron.

384
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:56.590
And tonight I'm going to Pittsburgh and I got a ton of friends there.

385
00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.480
Randy bombing,
um,
Bill Crawford from Wd v,

386
00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.010
you know,
Randy always say he built me up in that market.

387
00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:05.690
He's the reason why I sell tickets there.

388
00:24:05.691 --> 00:24:10.320
So we always hang up and then we always end up at that fucking the,

389
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.020
the,
the evil yet delicious.
Whatever the,

390
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.660
I always forget the name of it,

391
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.690
the fucking sandwich where they put the French fries on it.

392
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:24.990
All these fucking Pittsburgh guys are screaming about it,
uh,

393
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.600
to Nerys pin.
Amies Peramis I always forget the name of it,

394
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.120
the fucking sandwich there where they put all this shit on it because,
you know,

395
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.470
I forget why it had to do with fucking people building bridges and they just

396
00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:42.200
needed to stick everything that they were going to eat for lunch in between

397
00:24:42.201 --> 00:24:45.770
bread and they shoved it down their fucking throats and then they just ate it.

398
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:47.743
Um,

399
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.620
we're gonna end up there and of course we're going to have some fucking drinks

400
00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:56.621
and then we're going to end up in a Cleveland the next night and when we go to

401
00:24:58.161 --> 00:25:02.960
fucking Cleveland,
um,
by the way,
the after party,
I never have after parties.

402
00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.050
So,
you know,
this is going to be a special night.
Uh,

403
00:25:06.051 --> 00:25:07.970
the after party is going to be at hilarity.

404
00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:12.890
His comedy club downstairs at the a Martini bar.
So,

405
00:25:12.891 --> 00:25:16.770
uh,
if you want to come down there,
uh,
me,
Bart,
nick,

406
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.920
and lie at are all going to be there.
Um,
stop by,
come up,
say hello.

407
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.420
You know,
just by a couple of drinks in there because nick costs,

408
00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:28.940
this is another guy that fucking,
you know,

409
00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:32.990
that guy used to headline me when I would fill up like a third of his club and

410
00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:37.840
he built me up in that market.
So,
you know,
coming through town and,
uh,
I,

411
00:25:37.841 --> 00:25:42.841
we stopped in and make sure I pay my respects to one of the legends in standup

412
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.960
comedy.
So,
uh,
please come down there,
you know,
stop by,
say hello to us and uh,

413
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:53.450
by a couple of drinks and uh,
yeah,
whatever.

414
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.840
So,
but I think after that,
then we're in Indianapolis.

415
00:25:56.841 --> 00:25:59.120
That's another fun time to drink.
And you know,

416
00:25:59.121 --> 00:26:01.760
at some point I just have to admit that I like to drink,
right.

417
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.460
But I'm just going to keep working on,
I'm trying to fucking,

418
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:08.660
I'm losing the battle,
you know what I mean?
Like I've put on like,
you know,

419
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.270
a couple,
two,
three here,
but you know,
I'm still going to the gym.

420
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:15.230
So rather than putting on a fucking seven,
putting out two,
three pounds is a bad,

421
00:26:15.231 --> 00:26:18.200
you put on seven,
that's when you just start to give up on yourself.

422
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:21.610
Don't give up on me,
be um,

423
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:25.940
that's when he started giving up on yourself and then you fucking in trouble.
Um,

424
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.380
all right.
Can I talk good fellas here?

425
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:32.300
The Greatest Guy fucking movie of all time.
We watched it again and it's just,

426
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:38.020
I was watching it last night and what I realized is it's just a bunch of scenes

427
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.300
that to me is far as like a standup comic goes.

428
00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:47.830
It's the equivalent of an unbelievable closing joke,

429
00:26:47.831 --> 00:26:51.820
like a chunk of material.
But it's every fucking scene.

430
00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.190
Every scene is a fucking closer.

431
00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:01.100
It's the greatest fucking movie that's ever been made.
I,
it just does.

432
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.890
You cannot,
that's up perfect fucking movie.

433
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.860
And every time I watch it,
I see something different.
You know,

434
00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:08.730
it was fucking great.

435
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.880
It wasn't the beginning of the movie when it's raining out right.

436
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.460
At a young Henry Hill is holding the umbrella.

437
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.790
And that guy who gets mad at them for wasting a prince,

438
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.210
he's got the cigar in his mouth,
the run that he does,

439
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.870
the way he runs over to Polly's house and then he runs back over the phone,

440
00:27:27.241 --> 00:27:31.420
his run and the unlit cigar in his mouth is just so fucking perfect,

441
00:27:31.421 --> 00:27:35.160
get kills me.
So fucking masterpiece.

442
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:40.440
So we watched it so many times.
I'm trying to,
I'm trying to,

443
00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.580
uh,
you know,

444
00:27:43.581 --> 00:27:46.400
I've got a couple of questions cause everything in there means something,

445
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.210
you know,
Scorsese,
you know what means something.

446
00:27:50.211 --> 00:27:53.540
So I want to ask you guys a question.
I came up with a theory.

447
00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.890
Do you know when they,
uh,
when they got Billy batts in the trunk of the car,

448
00:27:57.891 --> 00:27:58.520
right?

449
00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.710
And they open it up and he's still alive and they fucking shoot them and stab

450
00:28:02.711 --> 00:28:07.520
him and all of that.
You know,
it's backlit and it's all red.
And then again,

451
00:28:07.521 --> 00:28:11.600
when they go to dig them up,
it's all fucking red like this.

452
00:28:11.601 --> 00:28:15.290
The whole sky isn't just the brake lights of the car.
It's the whole fucking sky.

453
00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.960
And my theory was,

454
00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:23.650
the reason why it was red was because that move who's quite got Tommy whacked.

455
00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:25.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

456
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:28.650
<v 1>And that was sort of the beginning of the end of their crew.</v>

457
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.760
You know what I mean?
That's like a theory.

458
00:28:32.761 --> 00:28:36.270
I have the theory I have about,

459
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:37.550
<v 0>okay,</v>

460
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:41.930
<v 1>in the end when Henry Hill is fucking crying like a fucking bitch and the end,</v>

461
00:28:41.931 --> 00:28:42.531
by the end of the movie,

462
00:28:42.531 --> 00:28:44.780
I hate the character because he fucking need went out dead.

463
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.410
Exactly what fucking Paulie told them not to do.
And then he gets caught.

464
00:28:48.411 --> 00:28:50.780
He fucking rats everybody else.
And he's fucking Billy.

465
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.230
I get egg noodles and ketchup.
If they do,
dude,
you should be in fucking jail.

466
00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:59.690
You can't,
um,
the add,
you know,

467
00:28:59.691 --> 00:29:02.260
when he's sitting there talking,
when he just got done testifying,

468
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.750
all of a sudden they cut to Tommy and he just brings the gun up and he just

469
00:29:05.751 --> 00:29:09.260
starts shooting.
That's Tommy from beyond the grave

470
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:14.640
because he ratted out Jimmy and,
and,
and uh,

471
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.840
and Paulie.
I think that that's him coming back from the grades.
Like,

472
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:22.000
this is what I would have fucking done.
Do you Henry?

473
00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.550
I would've fucking whacked it.
These are all just my theories.

474
00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:30.280
Joe To Rosa has a great theory where at some point Pauley is,

475
00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:34.570
is talking to Henry Hill and he's making those sausages.

476
00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.500
He said there's a,
there's a,
there's an expression the pigs are in the fire,

477
00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.740
which means shit has already been set in motion as he's sitting telling them not

478
00:29:41.741 --> 00:29:44.620
to fucking get involved with drugs.
Like that's the level.

479
00:29:44.621 --> 00:29:46.510
Like I'm trying to watch the movie at this point.

480
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.560
So I've got a question for you to just basically when it's backlit and red,

481
00:29:50.561 --> 00:29:52.540
why do you think it's backlit red like that?

482
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.780
And then also why did they cut to that fucking old school clip or that guy

483
00:29:58.261 --> 00:30:02.650
singing?
Um,
you know,
he's whistle on like a bird.

484
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.500
You know that part goodbye.
[inaudible] goodbye.

485
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.800
You know when they show that part of saint a virtualized,
they go,

486
00:30:08.801 --> 00:30:10.840
why do you think he shows that clip you in?
It's like,
you know,

487
00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:13.990
it means something.
I'm trying to think of the era.

488
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.080
I'm trying to think of the lyrics of the song for the life of me.

489
00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:19.810
I don't have a fucking theory.
You guys put,
does this sound like Consumer Mike?

490
00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:22.430
My conspiracy theory sticks,
but accept them.
Uh,

491
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.730
I'm fucking talking about good fellas.
I Dunno.
Anyways.

492
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:33.010
Um,
oh,
last time was for God last night when I was at the,
uh,

493
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.440
at the theater here in Columbus.
Um,
they had all like these Broadway shows,

494
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.800
you know,
where they,
they,

495
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:46.860
they would put like the logo and he or they put like a cats or whatever the

496
00:30:46.991 --> 00:30:49.580
fuck.
I can't,
I don't know what the fuck they are,
you know,
Mama Mia,

497
00:30:49.581 --> 00:30:53.260
all that stuff.
And the,
uh,
then the whole cast would sign.

498
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.650
I always look at all those things and I always think it's fucking cool.

499
00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:00.820
I'm looking at all that stuff and all the performers and the bands and all of

500
00:31:00.821 --> 00:31:03.040
that shit.
And uh,

501
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:07.510
so I saw the monkeys were up on the wall and I was a big monkeys fan.

502
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.770
I love the TV show.
When I was a kid.

503
00:31:09.771 --> 00:31:13.720
I thought it was funny as hell and I liked the fucking songs.
And uh,

504
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:16.810
I'm looking up there and I see Davy Jones,

505
00:31:16.811 --> 00:31:21.610
his signature from the 2001 tour.
David Jones,
rest his soul.

506
00:31:21.611 --> 00:31:24.460
Peter Torque,
Micky Dolenz that I'm looking going,

507
00:31:24.461 --> 00:31:27.010
did Mike Nesmith ever come back?
He never came back to dirty.

508
00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.940
And then right as I was thinking like,
oh wait a minute,
way back in the day,

509
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:35.020
like I'm going back like 12,
13 years ago,

510
00:31:35.021 --> 00:31:39.040
I used to take drum lessons at this place called the a drummer's collective,

511
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.650
the drama collective in New York City,

512
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.290
which just has a bunch of monster fucking players down there.

513
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:50.800
These just unbelievably gifted kids go there and then they have these sick ass

514
00:31:50.801 --> 00:31:55.540
fucking teachers there and um,
you know,

515
00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:58.570
but then like a jerk off like me can just come in and start taking lessons.

516
00:31:58.571 --> 00:32:00.970
They don't care.
Like whatever your talent level is,
you know,

517
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.080
they'll teach her right and outright.
As I was looking at the monkeys thing,

518
00:32:05.081 --> 00:32:09.010
I was like,
wait a minute.
I used to take lessons from this guy,

519
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:14.011
sandy genero big time Yankee fan lived in Staten Island and I was,

520
00:32:15.131 --> 00:32:18.340
you know,
obviously a red sox fan and that was when the curse was still going on.

521
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:22.600
And I remember I was taking lessons during 2003 and I remember when Pedro

522
00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.360
fucking through grab Don Zimmer by Jacqueline,

523
00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.020
Jacqueline and head in fucking threw him down on the ground.

524
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:34.590
And uh,
I used to do a bit about that,
defending,
defending,
uh,

525
00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:39.190
Pedro Martinez going he out and he what,

526
00:32:39.191 --> 00:32:42.180
what were his options to turn around and run.

527
00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:45.420
Then he's running around from an old man,
you know,

528
00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.850
to hold his ground and punch him.

529
00:32:47.851 --> 00:32:51.630
He can't do that cause he's an old man or three,

530
00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.000
grab him by his big Macy day head.

531
00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:59.180
And so to guide them down to the ground and it actually would get a laugh in New

532
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.570
York.
But last night,
Joe Part,

533
00:33:00.571 --> 00:33:05.130
Nick finally convinced me it was the wrong thing to do cause he looked at me and

534
00:33:05.131 --> 00:33:08.760
he just goes,
pill.
He goes,
it was don Zimmer,

535
00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.570
he's an old man because it old man comes from at you.

536
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.200
You just put your arms out and you hug them.
You know,

537
00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.300
he just got done you baseball.

538
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:22.200
I can't do this to you and I just put my head down at this point.

539
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:23.723
You're right.

540
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.943
<v 5>Okay.</v>

541
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.780
<v 1>And then for,
as he told the story that I guess,
I don't know,
at some point,</v>

542
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.650
I think after retired or whatever,
there's a,

543
00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:41.730
there's a baseball story out there that Pedro sat down and had lunch with,

544
00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:46.160
uh,
um,
which George Steinbrenner,

545
00:33:46.161 --> 00:33:47.960
the late great George Steinbrenner.
Right.

546
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.220
And to break the ice because that was still hanging in the air.

547
00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.710
He sits down with them and he just sort of looks,
Pedro looks down,
he just goes,

548
00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.900
bless me father for I have sinned.

549
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.250
And I guess Steinberg and just started laughing and then it was fucking over a

550
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:07.220
fucking cool.
Is that,
um,
I don't even care if it didn't happen.

551
00:34:07.221 --> 00:34:10.400
I just think it's a great fucking story.
So,
uh,
anyways,

552
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.470
so I used to take drum lessons from,
uh,

553
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:17.450
sandy genero and like he was a monster fucking player to get an unbelievable

554
00:34:17.451 --> 00:34:18.230
based on foot.

555
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:22.010
And he was the first guy that showed me that slide step thing because I was

556
00:34:22.011 --> 00:34:27.011
going through probably my 50th obsession with John Bonham and he was the guy who

557
00:34:29.151 --> 00:34:34.010
finally showed me how to do that.
Um,
and he was doing the good times,
bad times,

558
00:34:34.011 --> 00:34:36.170
licking and all that stuff.
He was just a monster player.

559
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.430
And one of the things he did,
um,
he used to get,
uh,

560
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:45.110
Peter Criss from kiss ready to go out on tour,
you know,

561
00:34:45.111 --> 00:34:47.120
if we just take them through the paces and all that,

562
00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:49.970
get them up to speed so we could go out and go kill it with the,

563
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:55.650
with the van kiss and a,
and another thing he did was he played,
um,

564
00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:01.760
he played drums with the monkeys when they would go on the road.
And,
and I,

565
00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:06.350
I hadn't thought about taking lessons with them in such a long fucking time.

566
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.680
So I'm sitting there in Columbus and,
um,

567
00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.360
I'm looking at the monkeys thing and I see Peter Torque,

568
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:18.170
Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz.
And I was thinking and it right as I thought,

569
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.490
wait a minute,
ice,
take drum lessons from a guy,
sandy generra.

570
00:35:22.491 --> 00:35:23.810
We used to play with these guys and he,

571
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.420
and I know he was on tour with these guys during the time.
And right.

572
00:35:26.421 --> 00:35:29.000
Then I looked and I saw his fucking signature was coolest shit.

573
00:35:29.001 --> 00:35:31.400
I took a picture of it and um,

574
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:36.590
he also played with Cindy Lopper like he did like that's the cool thing about

575
00:35:36.591 --> 00:35:40.910
drama collective.
Like they,
they'd fucking major,
major drummers.

576
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.670
There was another guy down and he could just walk in like a fucking bum like me

577
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:48.180
and you could just take fucking lessons from,
they had another guy down there.

578
00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.713
<v 3>MMM.</v>

579
00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:55.090
<v 1>The fuck is his name.
I'm going blank on it.
He used to play with a</v>

580
00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:59.210
Herbie Hancock.
Let me look this up.
Rory handcuffed.

581
00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:03.830
The guy played on the loft funk.
I mean,
uh,
you can't,

582
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:07.730
here we go.
Come on and build.
Learn how to spell

583
00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:10.820
<v 3>funk,
drummer</v>

584
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.620
<v 1>something simple.
Mike something or other.
My Clark,
I could believe it.</v>

585
00:36:16.621 --> 00:36:20.860
When I went down there,
I just saw the guy go walking by and I was like,

586
00:36:20.861 --> 00:36:24.080
is that fucking my clock to go?
Yeah.
I go,
what is he doing it again?
I,

587
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:29.100
he's wanting to teachers so you can take a fucking less than what that guy said

588
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:31.700
it.
Listen to his shit.
Trying to figure out how to fucking do it.

589
00:36:31.701 --> 00:36:33.160
He could actually walk down and take a lesson.

590
00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.810
And I know there's some of you younger guys,

591
00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:38.410
this is no big fucking deal cause you got youtube and he can just watch the guy

592
00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:40.660
and break it down and slow it down.
And I have some guy,

593
00:36:40.661 --> 00:36:44.750
but back in the day you couldn't do that.
And I was just like,

594
00:36:44.751 --> 00:36:46.790
this is why it's great to live in fucking New York City.

595
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:51.950
These fucking guys are actually out here.
Um,
anyways,
so,

596
00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:55.250
uh,
I'll end on this thing here and I'm gonna have to punch in the,
uh,

597
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.370
the advertising because I haven't gotten it yet.

598
00:36:58.371 --> 00:37:02.890
I'll have to put it in later on when I'm on the bus.
Um,
but anyways,
uh,
I,

599
00:37:02.891 --> 00:37:06.140
I discovered a fucking drummer.
I don't know how,

600
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:09.440
where I was a guy,
Chris Coleman,

601
00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:11.540
and he dramas out,

602
00:37:11.541 --> 00:37:14.600
they're familiar with this guys when these Gospel Drummers guys fucking

603
00:37:14.601 --> 00:37:18.250
unbelievable.
I just stumbled upon a,
uh,
the,

604
00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.060
I watch a bunch of drum videos on youtube.

605
00:37:20.061 --> 00:37:23.360
They always have them on the fucking sides.
And,
uh,

606
00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:26.120
it just popped up and I was like,
who is this cow?
Check out.

607
00:37:26.121 --> 00:37:30.290
This guy's playing just a fucking unbelievable solar.
So,
uh,
I'm gonna put the,
uh,

608
00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:35.120
I'll post a clip of the picture.
I took a theater here in Columbus,

609
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:39.200
uh,
with the monkeys and that Sandy Janeiro's signature drew a little drum man.

610
00:37:39.201 --> 00:37:43.400
It was fucking cool as shit.
And uh,
and also,
uh,

611
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.370
the video clip of Chris Coleman.
Um,

612
00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.940
by the way,
by the way,
before I get Outta here,

613
00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:53.030
a must win fucking gang.

614
00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:58.160
Obviously for Kansas City,
Kansas City has to win this,
this game,

615
00:37:58.161 --> 00:38:00.620
six or,
uh,
I don't know,
man.

616
00:38:00.621 --> 00:38:05.000
I think Toronto might come back and if they go back to their home,
you know,

617
00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:07.160
uh,
it's turned into a great series.

618
00:38:07.161 --> 00:38:09.770
Remember I was bitching about that when they were down fucking,
uh,

619
00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.190
oh to telling them,
you know,

620
00:38:13.191 --> 00:38:16.850
I want to see a seven game fucking series and look at that.
Hey,
they come,

621
00:38:16.851 --> 00:38:19.550
they come storming back.
He got to give it up to Toronto.

622
00:38:19.551 --> 00:38:23.630
Even if they don't fucking win this next woman that teams got major fucking

623
00:38:23.631 --> 00:38:27.590
heart.
Uh,
I can't believe I'm missing all these fucking games.
I mean,

624
00:38:27.591 --> 00:38:29.720
I obviously I'm already having a great fucking time,
but,
uh,

625
00:38:29.721 --> 00:38:30.554
this is the time of year.

626
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:35.330
I like to be home to actually fucking watch a bunch of baseball.
So,
uh,
um,

627
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:38.770
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.
Whatever.
I gotta go,
fuck.

628
00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.400
Got To get running here.
How can you know what I gotta do?

629
00:38:40.401 --> 00:38:43.490
I gotta go fucking work off at least maybe three of these goddamn cookies.

630
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.640
Do you want me fucking cookies that were in here?
Let me see.

631
00:38:46.641 --> 00:38:51.050
How many servings say,
say this is,
you know,
cause they was,
let's see here.

632
00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:56.150
Amount of servings,
calories,
160 calories from fat.

633
00:38:56.151 --> 00:38:59.600
60 serving is three cookies.

634
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:01.010
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

635
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:05.600
<v 1>serving per kid per container is about 4.5.</v>

636
00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.020
So I had enough Oreo cookies for four and a half.

637
00:39:09.021 --> 00:39:11.920
Fucking people's being fucking freckled content

638
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:16.770
hundred 60 cow amount per serving

639
00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:23.390
is one 60.
There's no way for that.
There's no way.
Three cookies are 160.

640
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.380
That's gotta be 160 per cookie.
All right,

641
00:39:28.381 --> 00:39:31.230
Bill,
do the math.
That's 300 plus one 80.

642
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:36.300
That's 480 calories.
Times three.

643
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:40.380
There's over 12 cookies.
Oh,
you fucking jerk off.

644
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:47.490
So I got to multiply that three 80 times four.

645
00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:49.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

646
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.460
<v 1>That's 1,203.
2015.</v>

647
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.250
Over 1500 fucking calories.

648
00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:01.470
You have a fucking just sweat your balls off on the elliptical for an hour.

649
00:40:01.471 --> 00:40:06.330
You're lucky if you make 600 fucking calories.
Oh Dude,

650
00:40:06.331 --> 00:40:08.280
I gotta I gotta go to the front.
I got to go downstairs.

651
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.690
I get to hit the gym before I get on the bus.
All right,
that's the,
uh,

652
00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:13.680
Thursday afternoon podcast.
I know it was kind of all over the place.

653
00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:18.450
I'm going to try to get some of the guys on the podcast from Monday.
Uh,

654
00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:22.380

Thank you to everybody that's been coming out to the shows.
And um,

655
00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:23.791

656
00:40:23.791 --> 00:40:26.370
thank you again for the people who brought up the drum videos and the tee shirts

657
00:40:26.371 --> 00:40:29.550
and all that shit.
You guys don't have to do that stuff.
All right?

658
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.680
You don't have to do that.
Um,

659
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:36.870
I got a ton of fucking shit already did I got to get rid of and uh,

660
00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.830
you know,
the last thing I need is more cool.

661
00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.200
I'm never going to be able to throw out those Pete rose tee shirts.

662
00:40:43.201 --> 00:40:47.780
That too fucking cool.
Right?
And then I buy whatever I gotta throw it.
I got it.

663
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:51.780
No,
I have not.
I have to throw something out.
Well,

664
00:40:51.781 --> 00:40:54.600
my old Quebec Nordiques t shirt,
I'm not fucking throwing that out.

665
00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.360
It's starting to spill it to my wife's side of the closet.

666
00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:02.190
I'm like a broad was shoes except it's t shirts over there.
All right.

667

<v 6>Alright,
now it's time for the rates and no,</v>

672
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.990
I haven't gone to the gym yet and yes,

673
00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:27.030
it is a few hours into the future and I am on my iPhone over there.

674
00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:31.260
All right.
Blue Apron Epi buddy.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You can admit it.

675
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.690
The last thing anyone wants to after work is wait in line at the grocery store,

676
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:40.550
Schlep home and cook a complicated Goddamn meal and expensive,

677
00:41:40.551 --> 00:41:45.080
unhealthy takeout is hardly better.
Hey,
I should know I'm living it right now.

678
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.960
That's where the new service blue apron comes in.

679
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:51.540
Did I mention I went to white castle a few nights ago?

Let's make it feel much.

691
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:40.540

692
00:42:41.181 --> 00:42:43.490
never know it.
Cooking takes half an hour.

693
00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:47.870
Shipping is flexible and free and the menus are always knew they won't send the

694
00:42:47.871 --> 00:42:50.810
same meal twice.
I love that.
It's so tasty.

695
00:42:50.811 --> 00:42:54.110
You'd never know cause you know a bunch of fat fucks who like fiber and it's 700

696
00:42:54.111 --> 00:42:58.280
calories doesn't taste good unless it's three Oreos.

697
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.130
Maybe that was me thinking that.
Anyways,

698
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:05.740
they work around your schedule and dietary preferences and blue apron experts

699

701
00:43:13.581 --> 00:43:15.920

702

703
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.710

00:44:21.921 --> 00:44:22.754
comfortable.

721
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:26.070

<v 8>here.

753
00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:25.810
I want to thank the 43,000 people who sent me that story about how the world's

754
00:46:26.421 --> 00:46:30.350
largest sperm bank has been turning away the ges of redheads.

755
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:36.140
Okay?
Uh,
bank,
uh,
biggest sperm,

756
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:40.310
world's biggest sperm bank tells red heads we don't need your semen.

757
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:48.790
No fucking degrading.

758
00:46:48.791 --> 00:46:53.791
That is you showing up to jerk off into a Dixie Cup and they turn you away.

759
00:46:54.371 --> 00:46:57.370
Like,
Nah,
that's all right.
That's,

760
00:46:57.371 --> 00:47:01.690
that's like telling a stripper to put clothes back on.
He's fucking horrific,

761
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:05.620
you know?
But for some reason,
like people think that that affects my life.

762
00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:09.010
It doesn't,
all right,
they turn away a lot of fucking people.
Okay.

763
00:47:09.011 --> 00:47:12.520
If you got different shit and your family,
they turn you away.
And not to mention,

764
00:47:12.521 --> 00:47:17.050
I got to tell you as a guy,
that story has no effect on you.
Okay?

765
00:47:17.051 --> 00:47:19.390
As far as your ges,
I guess.
Yeah.

766
00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:23.560
I can't sell my ges to a sperm bank.
I mean,
how,

767
00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:28.120
what sort of financial fucking crisis am I going to be and where I'm going down

768
00:47:28.121 --> 00:47:32.410
to a Duane Reades in the lube and then limping into a sperm bank to fucking

769
00:47:32.411 --> 00:47:36.640
shoot something into a goddamn graduated cylinder.
You know,
rarely.

770
00:47:36.641 --> 00:47:41.260
I can't fucking do that.
You think I give a fuck?
Let me tell you something.

771
00:47:41.261 --> 00:47:45.940
This is what I've learned is what I learned in life.
Okay?
If you're making money,

772
00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:50.020
they'll
want you fucking ges.

773
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.970
I don't give a fuck what you look like.

774
00:47:51.971 --> 00:47:55.840
You can be a one eyed balled midget troll they wanted in them.

775
00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:01.660
All right?
Trust me.
So any redhead who took that in a bad fucking way,

776
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:04.510
just go out and make something yourself.
I'm telling you,

777
00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:09.540
you'll get a fucking 10 and you'll dump a fucking nice unwanted spoons right in

778
00:48:10.541 --> 00:48:14.890
her.
That was disgusting.
Yet pro redhead.
How do you like that?

779
00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:19.210
Everybody pro fucking redhead.
Um,

780
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:22.300
I just loved,

781
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.340
I just love how many people sent me that story.
Like I swear to God,

782
00:48:27.341 --> 00:48:29.980
I said 40,000,
but it had to be at least be a hundred.

783
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:34.780
And that's one of the things that I love about the Internet and I hate it at the

784
00:48:34.781 --> 00:48:37.180
same time because the Internet,
I swear to God,

785
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:42.210
allows adults to act the same way you acted when you were in like kindergarten

786
00:48:44.711 --> 00:48:49.711
or first grade on the playground where you would just completely uninhibited and

787
00:48:50.351 --> 00:48:53.200
you were mean.
Remember that Shit.
You just walk up to somebody and be like,

788
00:48:53.201 --> 00:48:57.610
I don't like your face.
Right?
You could just be that.
And then when you get older,

789
00:48:57.611 --> 00:49:00.520
you still think that he saw you sitting there in the board room going into this

790
00:49:00.521 --> 00:49:04.630
guy with his fucking face,
his stupid fucking tie,
right?

791
00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:09.610
You think childish shit,
but because you're older and mature,
you don't say it.

792
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:15.250
You know,
because you know you've got debt.
You don't want to get fired.
Well,

793
00:49:15.251 --> 00:49:18.520
he's doing a great job.
And they told the boss,
uh,
he didn't like his face.

794
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.210
That'd be Hilarie.
Why did you get fired from your last job?
You know?

795
00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:24.400
And he had to tell him some childish shit like that.
Well,

796
00:49:24.401 --> 00:49:29.401
the great thing is about the Internet is it allows you to tap back into that

797
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:34.030
part of you,
you know,
and,
and,
and actually,

798
00:49:34.031 --> 00:49:37.540
and then debunk the fucking myth that when you become an adult,

799
00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:41.590
you still don't think those thoughts that you did when you were in first grade

800
00:49:41.591 --> 00:49:42.850
because you're now you're older and mature.

801
00:49:42.851 --> 00:49:47.440
You still think I'm you just programmed not to fucking say him.
So,
uh,

802
00:49:47.441 --> 00:49:52.300
I don't know it.
At first I was like,
what the fuck?
And then by the time I,

803
00:49:52.301 --> 00:49:56.090
the 11th person sent it to me and,
and actually this,
this story broke like,

804
00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.220
like two weeks ago.

805
00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.810
And like two weeks in is people are still sending me this story.

806
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:05.290
That's what maybe find the Internet fucking hilarious.

807
00:50:05.291 --> 00:50:08.320
The fact that somebody's going to listen to this podcast and then send it to me

808
00:50:08.321 --> 00:50:11.260
on Twitter after it.
That's like that.

809
00:50:11.261 --> 00:50:15.250
That's literally that I don't wake your face Nana Nan ass shit.
That's just data.

810
00:50:15.251 --> 00:50:20.251
It's fucking childish and 99.9,

811
00:50:21.161 --> 00:50:25.750
it's just fucking hilarious.
Can even explain it.

812
00:50:25.751 --> 00:50:29.180
I think that's why.
Well,
maybe it's because guys are childish.

813
00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:34.040
Why I think guys are so funny is because we have the fucking maturity level.

814
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:36.740
I don't give a fuck what we're doing in our lives.

815
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:41.220
How much responsibility we have,
how much money we're making,

816
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:45.500
how good a husband or a father or anything like that we are.

817
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.293
Um,

818
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:52.730
we're still immature as hell unless you just a fucking boring Douche.
Anyways.

819
00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:56.540
The fuck do I know?
Huh?
What do I know?
The world doesn't want my sperm.

820
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:57.860
Why would you listen to me?

821
00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:07.790
Oh,
this just in the world says,
fuck you bill.
Fuck you.

822
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:11.960
And you'll read nuts.
We don't want them.
Oh my God.

823
00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:17.620
How much of an Egomaniac of my that that doesn't even bug me that I actually

824
00:51:18.231 --> 00:51:19.130
find it funny.

825
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:24.020
The world just said no to me and I still feel good about myself.

826
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.630
What kind of a man has an ego to that level?

827
00:51:26.631 --> 00:51:29.840
I'll tell you the kind of man who has the balls to do a podcast by himself,

828
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:33.770
who actually thinks he's fucking interesting for an hour.
Know,
gee,

829
00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:39.890
you know what?
I think I was a little too mean on the fatty.
I did.

830
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:42.410
I did what everybody does.

831
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.360
I judge fatties the way the world judged my sperm.

832
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:56.690
You don't see people.
This is why.
This is why my podcast is so mean.

833
00:51:57.110 --> 00:52:00.080
This is why I don't give a shit about other people's feelings.

834
00:52:00.081 --> 00:52:03.800
This is why I say cry me a fucking river.
I don't give a f.

835
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:08.630
The world just said no to my just the fucking world.

836
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:11.390
There's people out there,
okay,

837
00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.140
they're shitting on the side of the road after they fucking,
you know,

838
00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:20.270
skip out of a bamboo hut.
Okay?
I come up with my,
just,
Eh,

839
00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:22.760
I'm all set.
I'm going to wait for something better.

840
00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.650
There's people in fucking Columbia,
Venezuela,
who,
those people that,
uh,

841
00:52:31.651 --> 00:52:35.960
what's his face help helped out.
Escobar.

842
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:39.930
They were living at the dump.
They were living in a junk yard.

843
00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:44.240
He went out and built him a small city.
Uh,

844
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.510
those people also said no to my ges.

845
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:54.020
This just in the world says so.
I just don't,

846
00:52:54.021 --> 00:52:55.820
I don't have any fucking,
uh,

847
00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:00.830
I just don't have any sympathy yet.
I do.
I understand.

848
00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:02.480
People don't want to be fat fucks,
you know,

849
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:06.740
the same way you understand that you'd like the world to welcome your just as

850
00:53:06.741 --> 00:53:11.180
opposed to say no to the world outside zone.

851
00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:17.280
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

852
00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:28.683
oh,

853
00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.680
<v 6>I ate a paper.
Yes I did.
I still rode a bicycle.</v>

854
00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:51.530
Just let me paint a picture for you.
Okay.

855
00:53:51.531 --> 00:53:56.531
Big Reddish Orange Afro riding a beach rambler with white wall tires is big

856
00:54:00.411 --> 00:54:02.630
peewee Herman bike with white wall tires.

857
00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.630
Fucking insanely giant tires.

858
00:54:05.631 --> 00:54:09.080
Like if you went fast enough and slammed on the brakes,
it sounded like a car.

859
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:10.543
<v 9>It went,</v>

860
00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:16.750
<v 6>people thought it was the shit.
Now they didn't,
nobody liked me.
Right.</v>

861
00:54:16.751 --> 00:54:17.584
So anyways,

862
00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:22.930
I had paper route money people I had been doing the paper I have from third

863
00:54:22.931 --> 00:54:25.240
grade to freshman year in high school.

864
00:54:25.241 --> 00:54:29.050
I got up every fucking morning cause there's no day off with papers.

865
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:33.850
If you notice that even on Christmas when you wake up,
right?

866
00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:38.350
You walk by your children and that woman that you're married and you got your

867
00:54:38.351 --> 00:54:42.040
robe on,
you know,
tied Nice and tight.

868
00:54:42.041 --> 00:54:44.470
See a fucking Hogan doesn't spell out.

869
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:49.960
So all a day put your junk away,
dad.
What the fuck?
Right?

870
00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:53.680
And you walk to the front door,
there's the paper.

871
00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:59.340
Why you think it got there?
Well nowadays it's probably,

872
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:04.440
it's probably thrown there from a car out a car window by a 40 year old.

873
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:09.880
All right.
But when I was young,
all right,
it was still delivered by children.

874
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.780
Yeah,
it was great.
Back then they had paper boys.

875
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.310
Then the broads had to come along.
Well,
what about paper girls?

876
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.750
Why can't we do that awful job?
You know,

877
00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:29.970
typical fucking broads.
Oh,
this is early.
Am I,

878
00:55:29.971 --> 00:55:32.040
are you going to say that six minutes in?

879
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:35.580
Let me tell you something about these fucking lady.

880
00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:40.530
You know the funny thing about feminism

881
00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:45.810
<v 8>is they sat the,
sometimes you just,
you got to really look,</v>

882
00:55:45.811 --> 00:55:48.480
you got to really examine what you're asking for.

883
00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:53.430
It's kind of like gay people pushing for the right to get married.
It's like,

884
00:55:53.431 --> 00:55:57.900
did they have any fucking idea what they're signing up for?

885
00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:00.023
You know,

886
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:06.080
there's so wrapped up in being treated the exact same way as heterosexuals,

887
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:11.400
which they should be,
right?
I'm not giving you a rough time,

888
00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:16.080
their twinkle toes.
You should be okay,

889
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:19.320
but they're rare.
There are some advantages of being gay.

890
00:56:19.321 --> 00:56:24.090
One of them is you don't have to get married.
You get have

891
00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:26.520
<v 6>a life plot.
Right?</v>

892
00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:30.840
And at no point in the relationship can the dude sit there,

893
00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:35.220
right?
He's got his head on your shoulder,
plane with your chest hair,

894
00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:43.350
you know,
and you can just feel the sadness of his head.
And then you go,

895
00:56:43.351 --> 00:56:45.550
what's a matter of Scott?
You know?
You know,

896
00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:52.470
I don't know why Scott struck me as funny.
What's the matter of Scott?

897
00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:57.900
You don't seem like your normal self.
And he can be like,
oh,
it is.

898
00:56:57.901 --> 00:57:01.410
So where is this relationship going?
And then you're in that,

899
00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:05.940
then you're in that and then you got to get married and he got to put all your

900
00:57:05.941 --> 00:57:10.770
shit on the line,
right?
Well let me ask you this,
gay guys,

901
00:57:10.771 --> 00:57:14.920
what if Scott is a fucking bum?
Uh,

902
00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:17.960
what if he sucks at math?
What if,
what if he's not an earner?

903
00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:22.340
You ever think about that during your parades?

904
00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:27.470
Have you ever thought about that?
What if he's a fucking loser?
Loser?

905
00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:29.810
Huh?
Then what?

906
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:34.430
And then three years later you're under a lot of stress cause you got to fucking

907
00:57:34.431 --> 00:57:35.750
support his ass too.

908
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:40.120
You don't have time to go to the gym and keep your abs all in shape,
right?

909
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:44.360
And all of a sudden you get a little doughy,
little doughy,
right?
He's a,

910
00:57:44.361 --> 00:57:49.340
he's a guy.
He totally judges people by how they look in a tight shirt,

911
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:52.880
right?
He fucking walks out on you,

912
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.650
walks out on you,

913
00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:59.600
takes half your shit and now you got to pay alimony for a God damn man.

914
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:06.150
And do you ever think about that?
Well you should.

915
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.270
All right.
Don't fuck into what y y you know?
Oh,

916
00:58:12.271 --> 00:58:14.880
that would be great.
Do you guys have common law marriage

917
00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:20.370
or do they not even recognize that because you both either women or both guys.

918
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:25.260
I mean,
the fucking advantages of that is just,
it's,
it's incredible.

919
00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:30.570
You know,
it's almost worth the rejection.
Wouldn't you say?

920
00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:33.930
<v 7>Oh,
whatever.
Go Fuck Yourself.</v>

921
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:46.060
[inaudible] [inaudible] all our bill,

922
00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:15.510
<v 6>my younger brother and I have been having this debate about whether he took his</v>

923
00:59:15.511 --> 00:59:17.240
girlfriend's virginity.
All right.

924
00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:19.200
This is going to be about a guy who's still a virgin.
All right.

925
00:59:19.201 --> 00:59:20.880
This might get ugly.
All right.

926
00:59:20.881 --> 00:59:24.650
My brother and I have been having this debate about whether he took his

927
00:59:24.651 --> 00:59:25.790
girlfriend's virginity.

928
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:31.030
Basically my brother who is now 20 has been dating the same chick since they met

929
00:59:31.551 --> 00:59:35.780
in Catholic high school.
He says his girlfriend is saving herself for marriage,

930
00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:37.010
like a good Catholic.

931
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:41.780
My brother and the other hand lost his virginity before they met,
so get this,

932
00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:46.070
get a load of this guy's writing it like it's the 20 here's the kicker.
I say,

933
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:50.660
instead of typical fucking this chick,
let's my brother.

934
00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:55.730
Fuck her in the ass.
Let's read that again.

935
00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.320
So get this,
get a load of this instead of typical fucking this chick,

936
01:00:00.321 --> 01:00:03.680
let's my brother fuck her in the ass.
And furthermore,

937
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.710
she has convinced him that she is still a virgin.

938
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:09.610
I tell my brother,
uh,

939
01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:14.270
first consider yourself lucky because most women will never let you do that.

940
01:00:14.271 --> 01:00:17.270
And second,
this chick is not only a fucking whore,

941
01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:22.430
but his fucking royally stupid according to her Catholic standards.

942
01:00:22.431 --> 01:00:27.140
If you only have anal sex,
then you're still a virgin.
This is complete horseshit.

943
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:31.160
It's sad to me because I know this isn't an isolated incident,

944
01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:36.140
but rather a growing phenomenon.
Uh,
what websites are you going to,
sir?

945
01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:36.891
Um,

946
01:00:36.891 --> 01:00:41.180
it appears that more and more so called Catholic school goody two shoe bitches

947
01:00:41.181 --> 01:00:44.840
have been brainwashed to think that they are holy in the eyes of the Lord by

948
01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:48.820
maintaining their virginity even though they spread their butt cheeks and show

949
01:00:48.821 --> 01:00:52.460
that our writer,
right Jesus Christ,
please bill for the love of,

950
01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:54.200
of all that is holy help me,

951
01:00:54.201 --> 01:00:58.460
could help me to convince not only my brother but all these so called children

952
01:00:58.461 --> 01:01:03.050
of God that even if you don't fuck a girl in their vagina,
that a girl loses her.

953
01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:06.860
Virginia,
Virginia,
virginity,
Virginia,

954
01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:12.700
when she gets banged in the EA problem with lack of sexual education in this

955
01:01:14.901 --> 01:01:19.850
country,
particularly when it comes to like Catholic school and relaxing.

956
01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:24.140
Before you get on your soapbox,
do you feel,
do you feel,

957
01:01:24.141 --> 01:01:26.360
to get on my soapbox,
I just knocked you off.

958
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:30.560
Do you feel that this woman is still a virgin?
No.

959
01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.730
She's not a virgin.
No.
Even though when you go to put it in her,

960
01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:38.780
her hymen isn't broken but her hymen isn't place.
It's basically,

961
01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:41.450
but the seal hasn't been broken on the bottle,

962
01:01:41.451 --> 01:01:44.210
but you screwed in the bottom and all the liquid is poured out

963
01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:51.110
gospel now because it's like you're supposed to be,
there's this virtuous woman.

964
01:01:51.111 --> 01:01:53.540
So yeah,
it does create this weird complex in you.

965
01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.610
And then you do one of them old.

966
01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:59.510
This most Skanky just sex act you could possibly do.
Why is that?

967
01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:03.590
Skanky uh,
I it,
it's just sex.
Look,

968
01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.650
listen,
listen.
No.
Listen.

969
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:12.320
Different sex act as a sex act.
They shouldn't be demonized one way or another.

970
01:02:12.321 --> 01:02:16.130
And I take umbrage with this guy calling his gore a whore just because she's

971
01:02:16.131 --> 01:02:20.400
having anal sacs.
Okay.
Are you a whore?
Because you bang girls shut the fuck up.

972
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:25.260
That's right.
That's wrong.
That's the wrong way to look at it.
No,

973
01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.300
he's not a whore.
Not a whore.
Well,

974
01:02:27.301 --> 01:02:31.110
he's calling her a whore just because she's having anal sex.
Why?

975
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:36.330
Cause she took it in the age.
So do a lot of people.
How does it make them whores?

976
01:02:36.331 --> 01:02:40.230
It's a sex act,
but it's a dirty,
filthy one.
Well,

977
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:44.000
that's your issue.
And people need to let that go.
As far as him though,

978
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.090
it doesn't matter.
Matter what he does,
he's never going to be a whore.
He's a guy.

979
01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:53.040
Right?
Right.
Listen,
let me,
I'll explain it to you this way.

980
01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:57.720
If you take that patronizing tone with me,
you,
you already used the word umbrage.

981
01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:01.380
Yeah,
because I'm smart.
Don't get all right.

982
01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:06.330
I don't know what I'm bridge.
I take umbrage.
Um,

983
01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.450
I take umbrage with the fact that you used umbrage.

984
01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.310
It didn't warn me that you're going to do that.
And you see the look in my eyes.

985
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.270
The fuck is that it was this meet the press.
No,
listen to me.

986
01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:16.910
I've heard a lot of girls are doing that these days.

987
01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:20.730
They're having anal sex thinking that it's not regular sex,

988
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.710
but it's all sex people.

989
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.520
So if you're taking in the ass or you're taking it in the video page,
okay,
let's,

990
01:03:26.521 --> 01:03:31.380
let's,
let's see.
Okay.
And a drug sense.

991
01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.720
Alright.
Making out.
That's like you had a beer getting felt up.

992
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:40.110
You smoked a joint.
Going to third,

993
01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:43.200
going to second at what base am I on right now?
Third,

994
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:48.470
going to third is a like you just did some blow and getting fucked.

995
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:54.890
No wait,
you're all over.
All over the place.
I lost my train of thought though.

996
01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:58.770
Yeah.
If it was like drugs.
Okay.
First base is drinking.

997
01:03:58.771 --> 01:04:03.720
Second basis we'd third base is coke,

998
01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.940
maybe shrooms.
It shrooms.
Home is coke,

999
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:14.220
and then getting banged in.
The Hess is heroin with some math.

1000
01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.450
That's like,
you're not coming back.
All right,
so she skipped.
That's what she did.

1001
01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:23.690
She went from just sort of drinking and smoking some weed and went straight to

1002
01:04:24.331 --> 01:04:27.840
meth.
It's beyond needy.
It's beyond.

1003
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:30.960
You ran past home plate.
You went into the Dugout,

1004
01:04:30.961 --> 01:04:34.470
you kept going past the showers and you ran right out of the fucking stadium.

1005
01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:37.140
Worried about his brother and the girl that he's fucking,

1006
01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:39.750
why don't you worry about getting your own piece of tail?

1007
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:43.470
He actually agrees with you.
He agrees with you that there's,

1008
01:04:43.471 --> 01:04:45.450
there's a misinformation out here.
Yeah,

1009
01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:48.030
but he's directing it towards the girls that are doing it.

1010
01:04:48.031 --> 01:04:50.430
Not to the people who come up with these rules to begin with,

1011
01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.160
which is what I wanted to explore.

1012
01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:56.340
His anger is what I want to explain to you on standing up.
I'm walking around,

1013
01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:01.620
I'm about ready to drop knowledge.
All right,
here you go.

1014
01:05:02.130 --> 01:05:06.540
This is the deal.
This is why I'm interested in judgment and shaming people.

1015
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:12.300
They just never stop.
Um,
this is why,
this is why,

1016
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:17.580
if a guy does it,
he's not a whore.
If a woman does it,
she is okay.

1017
01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:18.120
This is first

1018
01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.570
<v 8>of all why it's,
it's not a big deal if a guy engages in that act.
It's basically,</v>

1019
01:05:22.571 --> 01:05:26.940
yeah,
it's because we enter,

1020
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:28.230
<v 7>okay.</v>

1021
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:32.100
<v 8>You know,
you're,
uh,
you allow somebody to enter your body that's,</v>

1022
01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:34.920
that's like so much more than like,
what the fuck we do?
Let's,

1023
01:05:34.921 --> 01:05:36.570
why sex is not a big deal to us.

1024
01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:39.870
I've told you this analogy before that basically,
well,

1025
01:05:39.871 --> 01:05:42.450
basically like this is the deal.
If somebody said,
hey,

1026
01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:47.040
I'll give you 1000 bucks to go over to that.
Does it say there's a birthday cake?

1027
01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:49.800
Give you 1000 bucks to go over there and just stick your finger in it.

1028
01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:53.400
You do it in a second,
right?
Yes.
If somebody said,

1029
01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:57.000
I'll give you 1000 bucks to take that cake and shove it up your ass.

1030
01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:03.060
All right?
You'd have some questions.
Where is that cake,
Ben?

1031
01:06:03.450 --> 01:06:07.110
What do I get out of it?
You didn't negotiate for more fucking money,

1032
01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:11.820
so that's the same thing.
That's just what we do.
Sticking our fingers and cakes.

1033
01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:16.600
That's that's,
that's how much sex means to us.
I think that's bullshit.

1034
01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:20.540
Well,
I don't expect you to understand it.
Right?
You know,

1035
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.630
saying that I don't understand.
This isn't about my,
my comprehend.

1036
01:06:23.631 --> 01:06:24.540
That's why you guys,

1037
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:29.550
that's why I don't believe that's why you guys think way more about who you're

1038
01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:32.280
going to have sex with because you're letting somebody enter your fucking body.

1039
01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:36.000
Now I'm just walking around.
I'm poking people now.
It's conditioning.

1040
01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:40.410
It's not like reality.
It's,
it's conditioning.
It's you.
You,

1041
01:06:40.411 --> 01:06:44.210
you grew up with this idea that you're supposed to not feel a certain way and do

1042
01:06:44.211 --> 01:06:46.680
you use the word society?
I swear to God,

1043
01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:51.480
we're just brainwashed from day one that what we do is wrong.

1044
01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:55.770
There are many guys who have had emotional moments when having sex with
somebody.

1045
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.860
They just don't want to talk about you.

1046
01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:02.550
I've had an emotional moment.
Yeah,
like what?

1047
01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:05.250
Oh my God,

1048
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:10.310
why are you making it sound like I cried or something?
I never did that.
No,
no,

1049
01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.920
you never did that.
So what?
Why did you just say that?
You're just making shit up.

1050
01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:17.160
You went from the,
I'm sure there's guys out there,

1051
01:07:17.161 --> 01:07:20.340
there's no research behind that and then you just threw that out there.

1052
01:07:20.341 --> 01:07:22.800
Would you like to meet to talk about my research or would that make you

1053
01:07:22.801 --> 01:07:27.060
uncomfortable?
Oh,
this is world series of poker.
You just went all in.

1054
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:31.500
Now I got to figure out if you're bluffing or not.
Am I going to call your hand?

1055
01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:38.180
Oh,
you're staring right at me.
Ah,
you fucking pain in the hand holding.

1056
01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:41.970
I'm folding.
Why do you always do this to me on the podcast?

1057
01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:44.960
This is the second time.
Are you on your bullshit?

1058
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:48.560
I thought that's what I was here for.
You ever do that again?
Saying that,

1059
01:07:48.561 --> 01:07:52.120
nodding with your eyebrows.
They're calling you on your bull shit.

1060
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.530
The fucking ego of females.

1061
01:07:54.531 --> 01:07:58.250
You guys are just always patting yourself on the back.
Are you?

1062
01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.690
Let me tell you something right now.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1063
01:07:59.691 --> 01:08:01.040
If you were a fucking dude right now,

1064
01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:03.380
I kick you in the chest and what's your fault?
Right off the bed.

1065
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:06.440
But I can't do it cause that's what you deserve right now.

1066
01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:08.540
But I can't do it because you're alleging

1067
01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:24.100
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

1068
01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:45.190
<v 6>I got an overrated overrated.</v>

1069
01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:46.900
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1070
01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:51.520
<v 6>Picking up a fucking magazine that lists 10 great places to go to breakfast and</v>

1071
01:08:51.521 --> 01:08:55.540
then believing that no one else read the magazine and there's not going to be

1072
01:08:55.541 --> 01:08:58.870
aligned three miles long the next fucking morning when you show up to get your

1073
01:08:58.871 --> 01:09:01.060
pancakes.
That's exactly what happened.

1074
01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:05.110
We pull up and I see this fucking looks like a goddamn breadline during the

1075
01:09:05.111 --> 01:09:09.310
depression and with Nia and a mom and I immediately just go,
hey,

1076
01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:12.820
you guys want to go somewhere else?
And then somebody in the car goes,
well,

1077
01:09:12.821 --> 01:09:14.620
it's probably going to be a line everywhere,
right?

1078
01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.610
So we fucking stand in line for 40 minutes.
Got to the point.

1079
01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:23.050
I'm crouching down like my back is killing my lower back.
Like I'm so old,

1080
01:09:23.051 --> 01:09:27.850
I can't stand for longer than like 20 minutes without my lower back killing me.

1081
01:09:27.851 --> 01:09:32.740
So I'm standing there 40 minutes in,
I'm crouching down like a,

1082
01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:35.740
ever see Asians when they have a conversation in China,

1083
01:09:35.741 --> 01:09:37.030
how they just fucking Nick Dave,

1084
01:09:37.150 --> 01:09:40.830
they can crouch down like that and are people in India,
you know,

1085
01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.600
they crouched down like that.
They'd been doing it their whole lives.

1086
01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:47.980
So their hamstrings are all stretched out.
I was down like that.

1087
01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.230
My big head turning all red.

1088
01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:55.930
I'm trying to stand in a little bit of the shade and a,

1089
01:09:57.890 --> 01:10:00.140
I don't know,
I'll find that.
I was like,
look,
let's get the fuck outta here.
Right.

1090
01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:03.790
So everybody agreed.
We leave and we end up going,

1091
01:10:03.791 --> 01:10:06.680
I mean we stood in line for breakfast so long it was now time to get lunch.

1092
01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:07.940
So we ended up going down.

1093
01:10:07.941 --> 01:10:12.941
We were on Santa Monica and we go down into West Hollywood and there's a place

1094
01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:16.640
down there,
hamburger Harry's,
they have great fucking,
uh,

1095
01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:18.380
they've got great burgers and it's one of,

1096
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:22.160
but it's also one of the gayest places you'll have a goatee in your life.

1097
01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.160
I didn't realize how gay it was.

1098
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:28.610
And I went there and the waiter was like really gay or whatever,

1099
01:10:28.611 --> 01:10:30.050
but I didn't really think about it,
right?

1100
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:34.580
So I drop off the ladies and I go over and I parked the car,

1101
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:39.050
I get out of the car and I come walking in and I'm starving.

1102
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:43.280
And as I'm walking in,
all of sudden this guy pushes me in the back,

1103
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:48.080
like gave me a nice little shove.
And I turned around and he goes,

1104
01:10:48.081 --> 01:10:49.280
do you need a table?

1105
01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:56.320
Fucking,
there's fucking gay dude pushed me in the bed.

1106
01:10:56.330 --> 01:11:00.710
He pushed me like,
fuck that.
Like not hard enough to make me stumble,

1107
01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.850
but hard enough to fuck up the gate of my walk.
And immediately,

1108
01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:09.350
you know,
felt the feelings you feel when somebody fucking pushes you.

1109
01:11:09.351 --> 01:11:11.720
When I turned around like,
what the fuck?
And the guy's just standing there.

1110
01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:16.750
She did a table,
I went nose,
I'm just meeting them over there.

1111
01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:21.250
And then he kinda had a weird look on his face and he walked away and I sit down

1112
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.520
and he's like,
hey,
how's it going?
How's it going?
I go there.

1113
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:29.290
Fucking gay guy just pushed me.
So I tell her the story and I'm off.

1114
01:11:29.291 --> 01:11:31.090
I've got what the,
what the fuck is it?
Some gay thing.

1115
01:11:31.091 --> 01:11:34.120
You just fucking go around and pushing people and then Nia goes,

1116
01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.860
he was probably hitting on you.

1117
01:11:36.970 --> 01:11:40.750
<v 8>Right?
So now my ego kicks in.
I'm like,
fuck,
I still am in shape.</v>

1118
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.940
<v 6>So for any of my fucking twinkle toed listeners out there,</v>

1119
01:11:44.941 --> 01:11:48.750
is that how you guys hit on each other?
Or was that just like,
Hey Philly,

1120
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:53.820
do you want a table?
Is that what he was doing?
It's fucking annoying.

1121
01:11:53.821 --> 01:11:56.460
Whatever it was.
And I felt embarrassed and I felt bad,
like,

1122
01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.780
like that look on his face when I went,
now I'm sitting over here like,

1123
01:12:00.781 --> 01:12:02.850
then he thought that I,
I don't know what,

1124
01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:04.580
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1125
01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:07.430
<v 6>that I was saying,
get out of here.
You're queer.
You know,</v>

1126
01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:10.760
cause that's a whole big fucking thing now you gotta be nice to those guys.

1127
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:17.650
<v 8>What the fuck I'm saying?
So anyways,
so we sit down.
All right.</v>

1128
01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:21.980
<v 6>And immediately the dude comes over,
oh I can,
I take your order,</v>

1129
01:12:21.981 --> 01:12:26.090
we fucking order and we're getting our food immediately the way you should when

1130
01:12:26.091 --> 01:12:30.720
you go out to eat.
So now,
despite the fact that fucking the,

1131
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:33.720
the waiter pushed me like that dude who pushed Zidane Oh,

1132
01:12:33.721 --> 01:12:37.100
Chara after he scored the goal,
that's basically how he pushed me.

1133
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.870
And then I turned around and looked at it.
I'm like,

1134
01:12:38.871 --> 01:12:41.180
I was going to run him into the boards basically.
Right.

1135
01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:45.020
So they fucking bring the food over.
It's delicious,
everything's going great.

1136
01:12:45.021 --> 01:12:46.090
And then all of a sudden

1137
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:50.480
<v 8>this fucking dude gets on the Mike and he can't see him.
He's like,
yeah,</v>

1138
01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:55.750
<v 6>okay,
everybody show thought good 10 minutes,
right?</v>

1139
01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.500
<v 8>And I'd say,
yeah,
go,
what's going on?
She goes,</v>

1140
01:12:58.501 --> 01:12:59.940
evidently they're going to have a show.

1141
01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:03.780
So it's fucking broad daylight out.

1142
01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:08.370
I guess they're going to come out and drag and they're going to do a show like

1143
01:13:08.371 --> 01:13:08.641
this.

1144
01:13:08.641 --> 01:13:13.641
This is how gave this place is that they're going to have a brunch slash

1145
01:13:13.651 --> 01:13:18.090
transvestite Lipsync fucking show.
And I got to tell you,

1146
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.730
it was absolutely fucking hilarious.

1147
01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:24.120
We was sitting there and the guy on the mic,

1148
01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:28.770
it's like 1130 in the morning,
and he said,
cunt on the mic.

1149
01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.230
<v 6>He goes,
come on,
bitches,
drink up.
We're having a show.</v>

1150
01:13:33.231 --> 01:13:36.230
Don't be a bunch of something.
And he goes,
sorry,
I'm sorry,

1151
01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.330
I'm just feeling a little cunty

1152
01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:45.480
there with Nina's mom.
And this guy starts saying cunt,

1153
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:49.070
like every other fucking word in broad daylight.
And as a comedian,

1154
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:52.220
I had to respect that guy.
All right?

1155
01:13:52.221 --> 01:13:55.220
I've never said cunt on stage when the sun's out.
I'm not going to lie to you.

1156
01:13:55.221 --> 01:13:58.940
I barely say it on stage.
I say it a ton of times here,
cause it's ridiculous,

1157
01:13:58.941 --> 01:14:02.270
but I really don't say it that much on a comedy club stage.

1158
01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:07.271
And this dude slash half a lane is saying [inaudible] every other word at

1159
01:14:07.521 --> 01:14:08.354
brunch.

1160
01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:12.080
<v 8>And uh,
so anyways,
so they come</v>

1161
01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:16.640
<v 6>down like three of them.
The whole sucked,</v>

1162
01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:21.020
right?
He had this giant head with this huge fucking,
uh,

1163
01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:25.580
I don't know what blonde wig on.

1164
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:27.400
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1165
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:31.690
<v 6>And he,
he was like doing jokes that should have been funny,</v>

1166
01:14:31.691 --> 01:14:36.130
but weren't at some point he said something about a bloody pussy and was sitting

1167
01:14:36.131 --> 01:14:39.910
here eating brunch and he makes a bloody pussy joke.
So just as a comedian,
this,

1168
01:14:39.911 --> 01:14:42.130
this should have been hilarious with timing was awful.

1169
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:46.660
He'd say the set up and then he'd mumbled the punchline and he was annoying me.

1170
01:14:46.661 --> 01:14:49.930
The next one came out was all right.
The dude looked like Nancy grace.

1171
01:14:49.931 --> 01:14:53.380
So that was cracking me up.
And then,
uh,

1172
01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:58.850
the next one looked like a soccer mom
if,

1173
01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:03.350
if she was in Battlestar Galactica,
you know,
you know when they have those,
uh,

1174
01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:08.630
you know,
they get that Woodstock,
Ellen degenerate haircut.
Kinda had that,

1175
01:15:08.631 --> 01:15:12.560
but spiked up and that was hilarious.
And then the last one freaked me out.

1176
01:15:12.561 --> 01:15:15.620
There's always one that's going to freak you out because it's going to almost

1177
01:15:15.621 --> 01:15:16.820
look like a fucking chick.

1178
01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:20.750
So it had like acid plants and it's like I'm trying to eat and I gotta I gotta

1179
01:15:20.751 --> 01:15:25.730
get Outta here.
So I go up,
I walk out of the restaurant because you know,

1180
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:30.860
it's one of those deals you,
it's like when in Rome you went into their place,

1181
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:33.530
so you got to tolerate.
Then it becomes,
there's that point where you just like,

1182
01:15:33.531 --> 01:15:38.120
all right,
this is,
this is too fucking creepy.
I gotta get Outta here.
You know?

1183
01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:43.900
So I walk out and I'm standing on the corner out in front of this place that

1184
01:15:44.361 --> 01:15:47.900
turned into the gayest place I've ever been in.
And I got to tell you,

1185
01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:49.970
I walked down the street all the time in la.

1186
01:15:50.210 --> 01:15:53.960
Nobody ever tells me that they saw me.
Nobody's ever seen me,
nothing.

1187
01:15:53.961 --> 01:15:55.850
I come walking out of this place right?

1188
01:15:56.330 --> 01:16:01.330
And this behind me is this some the transvestite that almost looks like it,

1189
01:16:01.841 --> 01:16:06.560
chick with acid plants and his dancing to salt and pepper push it.

1190
01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:07.453
I swear to God.

1191
01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:12.920
So I'm standing out in front of that place and it's that part of the song was

1192
01:16:12.921 --> 01:16:16.160
going,
bullshit donor donor.

1193
01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:20.090
And this guy pulls up from the comedy store,
stopped at the red light.
He's like,

1194
01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.830
hey bill,
how are you doing?
And I'm just like,
hey,
how's it gone?

1195
01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:28.880
Done the and the fucking background and my face literally turned red with

1196
01:16:30.201 --> 01:16:31.034
embarrassment.

1197
01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:36.470
But fortunately,

1198
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:40.490
fortunately the guy owned a restaurant across the way.

1199
01:16:40.491 --> 01:16:44.240
So then he ended up coming out,
coming over to me,
coming out.

1200
01:16:44.241 --> 01:16:48.170
How fucking funny is that?
He comes over to me and he goes,
uh,
you know,

1201
01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:48.861
to shoot the shit,

1202
01:16:48.861 --> 01:16:51.200
cause I've been telling him I was going to go to his restaurant and that just,

1203
01:16:51.201 --> 01:16:56.201
then fortunately Niya and her mom walked out and I've never been so relieved to

1204
01:16:56.361 --> 01:17:00.500
be like,
this is my girlfriend and this mom.

1205
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:04.700
I didn't know that there was going to be a fucking,

1206
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:08.720
it was like a s when I got it.
I got a mid eighties,

1207
01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.530
I don't know what a mid eighties

1208
01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:13.320
<v 7>okay.</v>

1209
01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.510
<v 6>Sitcom,
you know,
with this,
this situation.</v>
