1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:02.791
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:06.450
It's bill burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.250
September 12th,
2016 what's going on?

4
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:13.680
How are you this wonderful,

5
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:17.700
wonderful football Monday fucking morning.
Um,

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.070
I'm actually recording this Sunday afternoon.

7
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:22.710
I think I'm going to be doing this and like two different chunks I'm going to do

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.370
before my show and after my show because,
uh,

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.640
I got to travel tomorrow on the podcast would be later than it usually is.

10
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.240
So,
um,
unfortunately,
uh,
because I've been on the road,

11
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.430
um,
I not seeing the UFC event yet.

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.370
So I know some people ask me if I was going to be talking about it.

13
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.290
I definitely will.
Very excited to watch it.
Uh,
but I will not see it until,

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.130
uh,
I'll be able to talk about it until Thursdays podcast.

15
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.150
So sorry to all the fight fans who like to listen to me and the my usual

16
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:59.550
ignorant completely not knowing what the fuck I'm talking about.
Way.
Uh,

17
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.620
talk about that fucking great sports.
So having said that,

18
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.710
it finally just dawned on me after living in Los Angeles since 2000 fucking

19
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:13.280
seven,
you know,
and also being there in the late nineties,

20
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.180
um,
that this is,
I'm finally,

21
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.180
it's finally dawning on me that we're actually finally going to have a,

22
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.880
a NFL team out there,

23
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:28.881
which is great because maybe I can finally see my patriots play without having

24
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:31.980
to fucking fly somewhere.

25
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:34.080
I could just go right down the goddamn streets would,

26
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:37.120
which would be tremendous for,

27
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.610
for a a man like myself sliding.
Yeah.

28
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.140
Into 50 years old,
48 years old,
man,
I want to fucking do this.
I don't know.

29
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.000
I can't jump on another southwest flight to watch Tom Brady pick apart yet

30
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:53.750
another fucking defense in some God forsaken stadium.

31
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.370
I want to go right down the street like an old man,
right.
When am I old man hat.

32
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:02.980
So I don't sunburn the top of my fucking baldhead be tremendous.
So,

33
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.840
um,
I also,
I know that they're building them a stadium and I,
I've been,

34
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.260
I've just been so busy,
I haven't even fucking thought about it.
And I'm like,
Bob,

35
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:11.830
tomorrow night,

36
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.160
Monday night football is going to be the rams first game in Los Angeles since

37
00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:18.730
like 1995.
What the hell they playing this game?

38
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.690
It turns out that back at the,
uh,
the La Coliseum,

39
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.340
which is where they played when I was a kid back when I used to watch Pat Haden,

40
00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:30.250
Vince Ferragamo,
that quarterback controversy,

41
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.750
Wendell fucking Tyler.
And then they also had a,

42
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.630
the young bloods,
Jim and Jack,
Young Blood Jack plane,

43
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.880
the Superbowl against the Pittsburgh Steelers played it on a fucking broken leg.

44
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.170
I mean,
I don't know if it was a compound fracture,
hairline fracture or whatever,

45
00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:51.640
but his leg was fucking,
was broken and he's going gonna fucking play defense.

46
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:55.570
You assholes.
Sorry,
I've got a game on in the background.

47
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.470
Um,
I dunno why I love giants,

48
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:03.210
but I'm rooting for this kid on the cowboys.
You know,

49
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.570
Dak Prescott has been pretty good so far.
You know,
you know,
we started tell you,

50
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:08.081
what do you want me to do?

51
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:11.620
The fucking dumb analysis might tell you what I like about teach guy.

52
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.530
He's standing in the parking,
he's feeling the pressure,

53
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.410
he's got the clock in his head,
he's not rushing.

54
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.200
He's looking at second and third options.
Okay.

55
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:24.520
What we're seeing here is not what we saw last year when so and so was in there.

56
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.473
And he had,
he had the,

57
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.140
he was patting the ball telegraph and he's pitch it gives a fuck.

58
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:32.500
All I know is he's throwing the ball and guys with the same colored shirt,
uh,

59
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:34.270
catching it and they put putting points on the board.

60
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.780
It's 97 currently and I'm a join it very much the,
um,
you know,

61
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.410
eli is going to come back here.
He's going to stomp his foot.

62
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:43.000
He's going to make a fucking audible.

63
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.660
I love the Peyton Manning's fucking retired and I got to look at is dumb face

64
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:48.940
even more because he's going to be in every fucking commercial.

65
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.580
God bless the guy.
God bless him.
You know,

66
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.040
I should talk with my Charlie Brown have,

67
00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:59.320
what would you rather have my Charlie brown he had or his a number two pencil.

68
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.880
Fucking neck and head.
That's it.
No,
it's a rough one,
you know,

69
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:06.640
but he's got the full head of hair,
so you've got to give them that,
right.

70
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.100
He's a hall of Famer.
He's got plenty of fucking money.
He owns part of Budweiser.

71
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.060
Yeah.
It's fucking asshole guy destroyed me.
Um,

72
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.980
you realize the ego on me that I actually just,

73
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.030
I just fucking mentally measured myself to a hall of fame fucking quarterback as

74
00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:27.740
a what?
A Dick and shit joke.

75
00:04:27.741 --> 00:04:31.790
Talent comic and an and a host of a fucking podcast where I sit,

76
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.230
I lie on sit.

77
00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:37.130
I fucking laid down in God forsaken fucking hotels in the middle of nowhere.

78
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.170
You know what I mean?
I'm in Virginia right now.
Okay.

79
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.180
The state that professional sports for Gut Virginia is such a fucking enigma.

80
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.750
You know what I mean?
It's like you're in the south.

81
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.670
They don't have any professional teams and then their college teams haven't made

82
00:04:55.671 --> 00:05:00.590
enough fucking noise.
You know what I mean?
Like if you're in South Carolina,

83
00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:03.230
they don't have a professional team,
but they got,
they got Clemson,

84
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.360
they got the game cocks right up here.
You got Virginia,
you got Virginia Tech,

85
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.570
you know,
no fucking disrespect.
But you know,

86
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.630
last time Virginia was on the map for me was when Ralph Sampson Played Center

87
00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:18.590
for your team.
You know,

88
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.100
and I'm not into fucking James Town and this bearded fuck who came over here,

89
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.660
you know,
what do you mean?
Pocahontas?

90
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.890
And he chopped down some trees and he made the first drive in movie theater and

91
00:05:30.891 --> 00:05:34.940
he put his fucking hand up or a little fucking leather flap there.

92
00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:37.460
Whatever the fuck have I,
I'm not into it.
The first settlements,

93
00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:39.650
I don't give a shit.
I don't care about.

94
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.640
Almost said Tom and Jerry Thomas Jefferson's house.
It says here,
I don't,

95
00:05:43.641 --> 00:05:45.710
George Washington is like,

96
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.520
I find that stuff just mind numbingly boring.

97
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

98
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.050
<v 1>I don't know what it is.
The civil war is interesting to me.</v>

99
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.810
God knows they have some shit like that here,
but I don't know.

100
00:05:56.811 --> 00:06:00.590
I Seeked it out World War II,
um,

101
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.110
did that,
that's like,

102
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.420
that's the good fellas of fucking wars as far as I'm concerned.
As far as,

103
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.820
you know,
the I footage of it,
you know,

104
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.700
there's been enough of the stories documented.
You know,

105
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.080
the got Ken Burns the war.
He did that whole great thing on World War II.
Um,

106
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.860
worldwide.
One fascinates me because nobody ever talks about it.

107
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.100
You know what I mean?
It's like a,

108
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.260
you know,
like the godfather part three,
you know what I mean?

109
00:06:29.261 --> 00:06:31.690
Just like nobody really brings it up.
Well,
not really,

110
00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:34.080
cause no one criticizes that,
but they trash got fun three,

111
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.670
I don't know what the fuck I'm saying,
but the revolutionary war,

112
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.180
the war that basically got us away from England and allowed us to become what we

113
00:06:42.971 --> 00:06:47.830
are,
which is a tremendous nation and also tremendously fucked up.

114
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.910
Right.
But what makes us,
what we are meatball sub having fucking

115
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.930
country that we are,
it just bores me to tears.

116
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.450
There's something about powdered wigs.
There's something about buckle

117
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.580
<v 2>on your hat.
You know what I mean?</v>

118
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.330
There's just certain parts of history that either appeal to you or they don't.

119
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.400
And the fucking revolutionary war,
I could just give a fuck.
You know what I mean?

120
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.260
The revolutionary war to me is like when you watch highlights of the NBA in the

121
00:07:16.261 --> 00:07:21.261
1960s and people are taking set shots and diaper shots and you know,

122
00:07:21.331 --> 00:07:23.970
everything's considered a carry and nobody's dunking.

123
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.240
I mean what is exciting about a fucking war?

124
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.160
We got a bunch of guys in red coats standing up,
standing in line like,
like,

125
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.090
like they're doing a halftime show while you got a bunch of dirty,

126
00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:39.950
filthy fucking Americans hide behind trees,
picking them off.
I just don't under,

127
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:44.920
it's just,
I mean it's just a bad game plan to begin with.
Um,

128
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.050
I like pirates.
I don't know when the,
when,
when the fuck did pirates and

129
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.140
I know recently there was a pirate movie cause Tom Hanks made the movie I love

130
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.980
about Tom Hanks is just like,

131
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.340
if there's any sort of heroic act,

132
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.590
it's like he has to play the part.

133
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.580
I don't give a fuck if you're in space.

134
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.400
All right.
If there's a d a disease,
he's done the disease.

135
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.800
He's been lost in space.
He's dealt with pirates.
I'm sorry,

136
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:22.340
my voice is fuck pirates.
He's fucking,

137
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.800
he's dealt with identity theft.

138
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.210
He's landed a plane in the Hudson River,
you know what I mean?

139
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.290
And he's great at all of it,
but it,
it starts to get to the point of like,

140
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.550
who the fuck does this,
Tom Hanks thinking is,
you know,

141
00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:40.770
as much as he's doing all of this in the movies,

142
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.370
has Tom Hanks ever rescued,

143
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.380
rescued a cat out of a tree?

144
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.090
<v 1>You know what I mean?
I,
I just don't understand where,</v>

145
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.680
where he gets off accepting all these roles at some point.
I mean I always am.

146
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:56.040
I'd be like,

147
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.010
<v 2>I have to go out and go do something heroic something,
you know what I mean?</v>

148
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.400
I got to,
you know,
help an old lady cross the street.

149
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.010
Is that a weird thing to think?
Like if I was like one of those action heroes,

150
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.240
at some point I would have to learn how to fucking shoot a gun.

151
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.450
I'd have to get in a bar fight and you'd have to win.
You know,

152
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:22.280
it's some point or you just feel like it when you feel like an asshole and said,

153
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.290
how many times can you do that?
Bruce Willis?

154
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:29.040
Look over your shoulder when you raise up one eyebrow and you just catch the

155
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:31.920
camera crew looking at you.
And you know,
when they no one,

156
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:35.430
they could all beat the shit out of you and you sitting there in this fake third

157
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:39.840
of a plane,
right rudder.
But whenever the fuck you gotta Yell,

158
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.150
yeah,
Bill,
it's called acting.
You'd douchebag.
Yeah.
You know,

159
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.910
I'm just fucking around.
I love Tom Hanks.
You know what I mean?

160
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.380
He seems like a swell guy.
It's very wholesome.
You know what I mean?
It's funny.

161
00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:54.390
He started off,
you know,
I don't think the religious right would have liked him,

162
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.000
you know,
when he was in the dress.
But I think gradually ease.
He's become very,

163
00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:03.430
you know,
appealing to the people on Fox News.
He totally read himself.
You know,

164
00:10:03.431 --> 00:10:06.490
like a lot of Republicans,
modern Republicans start,
you know,

165
00:10:06.491 --> 00:10:08.200
at some point they're going to address right.

166
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:13.000
And then they apologize and they say that it's the booze,
you know what I mean?

167
00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:13.780
And then,

168
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:18.250
then they just get super hardcore into Jesus where it was your Democrats,

169
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.760
you know,
you know,
they're,
they're fucking,
they're there.

170
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.280
They're in their bare feet and college walking around,

171
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.560
taking LSD and all that type of shit,
you know,
then they lie about it later.

172
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.050
Okay.
I don't even know what I'm talking about.

173
00:10:32.051 --> 00:10:36.040
All I know is I just wish I could hit pause and never have this election

174
00:10:36.041 --> 00:10:36.874
happened.

175
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.470
This has got to be there.
This is,
there's just,

176
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.020
there's no winning.
There's no fucking winning.

177
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.900
Um,
but for the first time ever,

178
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.260
I think I'm going to have to vote for one of the two fucking leading candidates.

179
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:02.670
I don't feel,
I know.
What are you going to him?
What are you going to do?
Yeah.

180
00:11:02.671 --> 00:11:07.670
Worst case scenario,
you just deal with one of them for eight years.
You know,

181
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.240
long it's going to get Trump just to get somebody to fucking get the contract.

182
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.670
I piece of shit,
I'll probably give it to his own company.
Trump wall building.

183
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.440
Love.
His name's spelled out all over the fucking thing.
Um,
Bill,

184
00:11:22.441 --> 00:11:27.030
why do you try to talk politics?
You know,
you don't pay attention.
Um,

185
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.900
all right,
let's plow ahead.
I was talking about the rams here and um,

186
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.310
does anybody know the,
you know,

187
00:11:34.311 --> 00:11:37.800
it's funny as I'm on their Wikipedia page and somebody hacked it.

188
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.440
It's funny cause the owner's name right now,

189
00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:44.160
his little bitch and the head coach is get a new one.

190
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.033
Um,

191
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.540
so I'm sure the rest of this stuff here is reliable.
Um,

192
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.040
team's history.
Now I actually

193
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.220
<v 1>knew this.
I got all this stuff in front of me.
I knew some of this stuff.</v>

194
00:11:57.221 --> 00:12:02.221
I did know because I am a fucking nerd when it comes to sports that uh,

195
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:06.400
the rams initially started in Cleveland.
Why they would call the rams?

196
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:10.420
I have no fucking idea.
As far as I know,
there are no rams.

197
00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:12.400
<v 0>Okay.</v>

198
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.160
<v 1>I don't know if there's any fucking rams in the United States are there?</v>

199
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.080
There's certainly not in Ohio.

200
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.800
<v 2>There's definitely some buffalo off.
You know what the fuck?
I mean,</v>

201
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.070
fucking Midwestern people do they,
do they ever not get seconds?

202
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.570
You know what I mean?
Look how they make their pizza there.
Rams.

203
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:30.581
Let's see here.

204
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:35.530
Rams in the USA by the guests.

205
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.830
I would say maybe Montana.

206
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.570
I didn't think they in Colorado

207
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.800
would want to be around all those dirty hippies out there growing weed.

208
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.700
Just fucking with you.
God bless him.
Ram Usa.

209
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.740
Do I literally have to write animal rams and USA animals that was going to have

210
00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:58.210
a bunch of barefoot people at the fucking airport.

211
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:00.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

212
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:05.490
<v 2>Big Horn sheep.
Do you know you have to correct me every time.</v>

213
00:13:05.491 --> 00:13:10.220
You can't.
All right.
Big Horn sheep.
My,
my,
my mistake.
Oh,

214
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.370
hang on.
That's room service.

215
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.130
<v 1>Alright,
I'm back.
Um,
Jesus Christ,
he's fucking</v>

216
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.560
<v 0>okay.</v>

217
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.410
<v 1>Goddamn sheep are all over the place.
They are in Colorado.
In your mind,</v>

218
00:13:22.411 --> 00:13:25.410
Wyoming and the Western project shall would you call it in North Dakota?

219
00:13:25.411 --> 00:13:26.790
They are some fucking,

220
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:28.510
<v 0>okay.</v>

221
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:33.490
<v 1>The appendix that hangs off of a Baja,
whatever the fuck you call it,</v>

222
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:37.300
that hangs off,
um,
California.
That down there.

223
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.030
Not that in Cleveland.

224
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

225
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.640
<v 1>All right.
What the fuck was the point I was trying to make?
So anyway,
so they,</v>

226
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.180
they were in Cleveland.
All right,
let's get the momentum going again.

227
00:13:48.181 --> 00:13:51.810
Here it's five 57 I gotta be at the fucking place by six 30 here.

228
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.920
I haven't showered.
I haven't ironed my clothes.
Um,

229
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:57.440
<v 0>okay.</v>

230
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.770
<v 1>Does anybody know?
Do they have the record for like moving the most?</v>

231
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.290
It's gotta be for professional football team.

232
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:08.590
They were the Cleveland Rams from 1936 to 1945 and then they moved to Los

233
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:16.180
Angeles and they were there from 1946 to 1994 at some point they did play in

234
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:17.690
Anaheim.
I know that.

235
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.920
And then 95 to 2015 it was saint Louis Rams and now they're back.

236
00:14:21.921 --> 00:14:24.050
So they've played one,
two,
three,

237
00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:27.020
four different fork in places or three different places,

238
00:14:27.021 --> 00:14:30.950
but they've moved to three,
four fucking times,
right?
CLEVELAND,

239
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.710
that was one,
two,
three.
Now they moved three times,

240
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.300
but they've been afforded some places.
No,
three different places,

241
00:14:38.301 --> 00:14:42.530
but they weren't from Cleveland,
Los Angeles,
St Louis,
back to Los Angeles.

242
00:14:42.531 --> 00:14:44.720
There you go.
All right.
How many fucking flights would that be?

243
00:14:44.721 --> 00:14:47.870
That's how many times they went.
All right.
And um,

244
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.630
<v 0>okay.</v>

245
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.300
<v 1>I told you I used to watch them way back the day,
you know,
Eric Dickerson,</v>

246
00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.900
you know,
he used to watch him.

247
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.400
The fucking,
uh,
who else did they have back there?

248
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.480
John Robinson is a coach then I remember that the guy from fucking USC,

249
00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:10.190
but I'm psyched that they're playing in the a La Coliseum to see an NFL game.

250
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:14.570
There was huge.
I've obviously seen USC play there,
but I never saw an NFL game.

251
00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:18.380
And that's huge to me because,
uh,
that's the site of the first two super bowls.

252
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:19.491
You know,

253
00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:22.580
the first of which didn't even sell out wasn't even a Superbowl was a title
game.

254
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.630
The NFL AFL championship game,
whatever the fuck they called it.
Um,

255
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.410
so anyways,
uh,
I think I'm sort of going to be a rams fan.

256
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.700
I'm not going to root against him.
I'm not going to be a content.
Um,

257
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.120
I watch them.
Do you know who do they,
what do they play against?

258
00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:44.240
I don't know what the divisions that when I was a kid it was so the rams,

259
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:46.070
the 40 niners the saints,

260
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.860
somebody else was in the NFC west.
Uh,
fuck.

261
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:56.790
Was it falcons?
And then the central was Chicago,

262
00:15:56.791 --> 00:16:00.420
Detroit,
Greenbay,
Minnesota and Tampa.

263
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.620
I'm still looking at the poster when I was a kid.
I'm thinking of,

264
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.610
and then it was the fucking giants,
cowboys,

265
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.220
Redskins,
Eagles

266
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.880
and cardinals.
Right.
And afcs was the colts,
the Patriots,

267
00:16:17.881 --> 00:16:21.090
the bills,
the jets and the dolphins.

268
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.190
Seattle was in the AFC.
West Adams has fucking nuts.
They move it all around now.

269
00:16:26.191 --> 00:16:29.550
I don't know.
I don't even get it.
I don't know why they keep switching it up.

270
00:16:29.551 --> 00:16:33.600
Maybe because it was to for travel.
I have no idea.
But,
um,

271
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.820
all I know is I got to get ready to go do my show.

272
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.230
So through the magic of the pause button,
you'll have to wait two seconds,

273
00:16:40.231 --> 00:16:44.520
but I'm going to come back.
And,
uh,
having done my final show here in Richmond,
um,

274
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.900
but having a great time on this tour,
Todd rex has been fucking destroying.

275
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.970
Um,
and I want to thank everybody that came out to Charleston,
South Carolina.

276
00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:59.050
We hit that cigar bar again.
Um,
you know,

277
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.250
I haven't worried worked out.
I've eaten like,
okay.
Or horrifically.
I,
I'm hoping,

278
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:08.680
you know,
we're five days in the road.
He's takes a rough one,
you know.
Um,

279
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:09.860
<v 0>okay.</v>

280
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:14.210
<v 1>Charlotte was great.
Fucking Todd took me to this God damn one of those,
you know,</v>

281
00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:17.420
mom and pop chicken places,
right?

282
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:22.280
Which was fucking delicious,
but you know,
like 9 million calories.

283
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.770
I didn't eat for the rest of that God damn day after that place.
But,
um,

284
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:34.150
so we went there and then this friend of ours who was down there took us over to

285
00:17:34.341 --> 00:17:38.330
the Charlotte Motor speedway and they got this thing called the NASCAR

286
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.600
experience where you can literally take this class and learn how to drive the

287
00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:44.030
car and all that.
But you know,
we didn't have time to do that.

288
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:49.630
So they had a fucking NASCAR and they took us around the track doing about 165

289
00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:54.780
miles an hour.
Took me first to then Todd and we sat in like the passenger seat,

290
00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.720
like Luke Duke and went around and um,

291
00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:01.750
<v 4>okay,</v>

292
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:05.830
<v 1>I got to tell you like this is the amazing thing because they try to keep the</v>

293
00:18:05.831 --> 00:18:10.240
car so light.
You feel like you're in an absolute piece of shit.

294
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:15.190
I mean even like the,
the,
the gas pedal,
the throttle was like,

295
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.620
it was like the tiniest thing I've ever seen in my life.

296
00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:21.610
It didn't even have the pedal on it any way that they can get out of the car,

297
00:18:21.611 --> 00:18:24.940
they get out of the car.
So all it was,
I should've taken a picture of it.

298
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.710
It looked like a,

299
00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:33.080
it was like the thickness of a fancy coat hanger and it kind of came up through

300
00:18:33.081 --> 00:18:37.400
the floor and then just went up and like started to make the letter f but it

301
00:18:37.401 --> 00:18:40.520
didn't have that short little one.
That's all it was.
I'm like,

302
00:18:40.521 --> 00:18:44.090
your foot doesn't slip off that and the kids just laugh and go,
no,
it doesn't.

303
00:18:44.091 --> 00:18:49.091
Even some 21 year old kid flying around the fucking track like 165 miles an

304
00:18:50.001 --> 00:18:50.990
hour.
I gotta be honest with you,

305
00:18:50.991 --> 00:18:54.770
I didn't do well through the first like lap and then I kind of settled into it.

306
00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:59.270
Um,
I don't mind going fast if I'm the one driving,
but um,

307
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.420
<v 4>yeah,</v>

308
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.860
<v 1>you know,
just sitting in a chair is someone else is going 165 miles an hour.</v>

309
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:10.080
That close to the wall was pretty,
uh,
it was pretty God damn intense.
But,

310
00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:10.530
um,

311
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:14.820
I want to thank everybody over it and at the NASCAR facilities for letting us do

312
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.320
that.
Um,

313
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.630
<v 4>okay.</v>

314
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.200
<v 1>There I have to tell you instantly the heat,</v>

315
00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.010
the level of heat that was in that fucking car cause it was a really hot day.

316
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:28.690
I can't imagine with all those people watching all of those other cars driving

317
00:19:28.691 --> 00:19:32.210
around the track how fucking hot it gets.
And um,

318
00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:33.560
<v 4>yeah.</v>

319
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.230
<v 1>And then also,
you know,
you kind of get thrown around the car a little bit.</v>

320
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.880
Like I said,
it's not like you're riding in a Lincoln continental and,
um,

321
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.560
I don't know.

322
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.460
My biggest concern is smelling all those fumes and all that shit and just

323
00:19:45.461 --> 00:19:49.450
driving around.
I probably get sick just driving in a circle,

324
00:19:49.451 --> 00:19:52.930
like the level of concentration that it would take to just keep fucking doing

325
00:19:52.931 --> 00:19:56.960
that for two and a half hours or however long it takes.
There'd be a,

326
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.770
I was just pulling the pit stop and just pay.
He had to do it.
I'm gay,
I'm gay.

327
00:19:59.771 --> 00:20:03.250
I don't want to do with this anymore.
I did it,

328
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.040
went around the block coming to fucking times.
I got to do this.

329
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.960
I don't want to do this shit.
Um,

330
00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.460
forget about actually hitting the wall.
That's why I just kept thinking about,
um,

331
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.060
for some reason I wasn't thinking about going in head first.

332
00:20:16.061 --> 00:20:19.150
I was thinking about it.
If you've got spun around and you went,
you know,

333
00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:23.980
rear of the car in first,
that's how bad that would fuck up your back.
Um,

334
00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.960
but it was cool.
We got to ask the driver,
you know,
about some of his worst,

335
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.030
his course racks and all that type of shit.
And then,
uh,

336
00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.190
we went down and did the show

337
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.840
and I'm one of these nights,
I did like a fucking two hours show.

338
00:20:38.841 --> 00:20:40.880
I think that was in Charlotte.
I got to stop doing that.

339
00:20:40.881 --> 00:20:43.010
I'm supposed to get my act out.
Oh,
about an hour and 20 minutes.

340
00:20:43.011 --> 00:20:47.000
But I'm thinking this special is going to be somewhere between 1:20 AM one 30.

341
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.290
Um,
oh maybe.
Maybe they'll get it down.
I got to start time and it though.

342
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.470
But uh,
speaking in which that happens right now.

343
00:20:55.471 --> 00:20:59.240
So I'm going to hit the pause button and uh,
I mean it does.

344
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.960
I don't know why I tell you guys this because it's just,

345
00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.450
there's going to be no delay in your world,
but,
uh,

346
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.780
I'm off to go do my show here in Richmond,
Virginia.
Like I said,

347
00:21:06.781 --> 00:21:09.870
thank you to everybody who shoot,
who showed up on this tour,
uh,

348
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.220
and having a great time and,
uh,
you've been helping me get ready for my special,

349
00:21:14.221 --> 00:21:16.860
so thank you.
And uh,

350
00:21:16.861 --> 00:21:20.190
I guess I'll let you know how my show went in about two seconds.

351
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.150
<v 2>All right.
I'm back.
I am back show is amazing.</v>

352
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.370
Amazing crowd.
Unbelievably beautiful theater.
Todd Rex fucking murdered.

353
00:21:36.371 --> 00:21:39.550
And he told me,
guys,
he told me to tell you this story.
I can't believe.

354
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:40.900
I almost forgot this story.

355
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.980
It was such like a fucking Patrice moment.

356
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.740
It just,
so remind me of something Patrice would have done.
We would,

357
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.690
after we did Charlotte [inaudible],

358
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:58.000
we drove all the way up to a Norfolk,
Virginia,

359
00:21:58.001 --> 00:22:02.500
which is like a five and a half hour drive.
And at my age,
I usually,

360
00:22:02.501 --> 00:22:06.340
the cutoff is four hours.
You know,
back in the day,
I drive eight hours.

361
00:22:06.341 --> 00:22:09.640
Then that became seven.
And then the cutoff was,
now it's just if,

362
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:13.750
if it's fucking for a pass in a ferrets,
17,

363
00:22:13.751 --> 00:22:18.310
14 patriots,
sorry.
Um,
anyways,

364
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.210
um,
so we were fucking exhausted rice.

365
00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:26.390
We walk into the hotel to check in and this cute girl,
right?
She was like 21,

366
00:22:26.391 --> 00:22:30.560
22 adorable.
Just right out of college.
It's sitting there,
right.
And we get,

367
00:22:30.561 --> 00:22:32.150
we check in,
right.
And she,

368
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:33.190
<v 0>okay.</v>

369
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:37.210
<v 2>Before she,
you know,
she's handling this stuff,
she's getting all this shit ready.</v>

370
00:22:37.211 --> 00:22:42.040
Like,
uh,
she's going like,
okay,
just telling you about the hotel.
Um,

371
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.220
you know,
we have a restaurant here.
It's Italian food.

372
00:22:45.221 --> 00:22:48.020
It's open from his time to this time and especially as a blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

373
00:22:48.021 --> 00:22:48.341
blah.

374
00:22:48.341 --> 00:22:53.341
It's part of this Peneda on the second floor is the gym a second floor of the

375
00:22:53.471 --> 00:22:54.540
gym but Blah Blah Blah.

376
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.070
And the top floor is this due to do the deal if you want it to this.

377
00:22:57.071 --> 00:22:59.950
But when she goes to this big long speech and she's right in the middle of this

378
00:22:59.951 --> 00:23:03.130
speech and Todd's behind me and I just hear him just go,

379
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.410
just give us the keys.

380
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.650
<v 4>Okay,</v>

381
00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.650
<v 2>I fucking died.
I put my head down on the desk.</v>

382
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.860
She was so shocked that he said it.

383
00:23:15.861 --> 00:23:19.460
But it was such a classic Patrice thing cause I was thinking,

384
00:23:19.461 --> 00:23:22.940
I don't want to hear all of this shit.
I'm not gonna remember all this stuff.

385
00:23:22.941 --> 00:23:26.800
I'm fucking exhausted.
I just want to go.
He said,
just the way he says it,

386
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:31.400
it always feels like this Archie bunker thing.
He goes,
just give us the keys.

387
00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:36.710
And the poor girl,
she didn't know what to do.
She never,
you know,
she was younger.

388
00:23:36.711 --> 00:23:40.060
So it took all,
I felt bad because it took us like a minute for,

389
00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:44.390
to sort of regroup and then just realize that we were too silly older guys.

390
00:23:44.391 --> 00:23:46.010
And then she and then said Todd

391
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.300
<v 1>was rude but oh my God,
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.</v>

392
00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:55.060
And it really
reminded me of uh,

393
00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.660
of Patrice,
which was crazy because tonight,
you know,

394
00:23:59.661 --> 00:24:02.720
his mom came up to the show and his sister and uh,

395
00:24:02.721 --> 00:24:06.590
I hadn't seen them was really just,
it was just the synergy.

396
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:11.780
So anyways,
let's plow ahead here with the podcast.

397
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.280
Um,
you know,

398
00:24:14.281 --> 00:24:18.890
it would be fucking amazing in this first week here is if the Patriots win.

399
00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:23.390
Cause I think I just saw the cults lost and I love Andrew Luck and I actually,

400
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.290
you know,
I like the Colson,
everything like that.
I just obviously you know,

401
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:32.320
the severity of this fucking stupid ass think it would be nice to see them lose

402
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:34.400
a couple of,
if we have the same record.

403
00:24:34.401 --> 00:24:37.880
But then the other thing too is I don't want the colts to shit the bed cause I'm

404
00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:41.420
hoping we're going to make the playoffs and um,

405
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.550
I want to play them again,

406
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.760
see what they're fucking excuse is going to be when we kicked their ass again.

407
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:51.110
And I'm saying we,
because I don't play for the team,
I should really be like,

408
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:53.680
hopefully we beat him.
Who the fuck knows?
But,
um,

409
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.940
<v 5>okay.</v>

410
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.900
<v 1>I Dunno.
I,
I,
this is,
I mark my words in,</v>

411
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.580
in the history of sport.

412
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:05.490
Like this will go down as one of the most ridiculous fucking suspensions after a

413
00:25:05.491 --> 00:25:06.770
while.
And I'll tell you why,

414
00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:10.670
because I was literally just watching when I was trying to find this game.

415
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.470
Um,
they had a thing on the Celtics and a that time Dennis Rodman set,

416
00:25:15.471 --> 00:25:20.240
if Larry Bird was a black guy,
you know,
he's a very,
very good basketball player,

417
00:25:20.241 --> 00:25:24.110
but if he's a black guy,
he'd just be another good player.
And,
um,

418
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:29.180
and then they asked what does his face Isaiah and I was Isaiah was like,
yeah,

419
00:25:29.181 --> 00:25:32.840
I'd have to agree and how that whole thing blew up and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

420
00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:37.190
So now it's like 30 years later and now they're actually saying,
well,
you know,

421
00:25:37.191 --> 00:25:40.430
they're actually kind of defending Isaiah,
not saying what he said was right,

422
00:25:40.431 --> 00:25:42.620
but they're looking at it like Isaiah.

423
00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:47.280
Unfortunately in that time he said the wrong thing about the wrong white guy.

424
00:25:47.281 --> 00:25:51.020
And now,
now it's much more like measured how they're looking at it.

425
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:55.550
I think that'll happen if the fucking time.
I hope so.

426
00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.360
I just said for Tom,
like I was like part of his fan club.

427
00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:04.760
I hope that happens for Tom.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

428
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.870
just an absolutely incredible run.
Um,
I'm telling you,

429
00:26:08.871 --> 00:26:13.730
people sleep on the south.
They really do.
How fucking great it is down here.

430
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:15.980
Um,
but like I said,

431
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:21.010
I've never been tailgated the way I was tailgated from fucking South Carolina up

432
00:26:22.161 --> 00:26:26.100
to Charlotte and Charlotte over to Norfolk,
Norfolk over the fucking

433
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.430
Richmond.
They get down to these two lane highways and I'm telling you,

434
00:26:31.431 --> 00:26:36.410
they are the,
it's like a NASCAR race.
They're right on your ass there.
Um,

435
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:41.660
so anyways,
I got to do a couple,
unfortunately I have to read out loud.

436
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.820
I know you guys get a nice fucking enjoyment out of this.

437
00:26:44.821 --> 00:26:48.780
Let me just knock these things out because I'm going to go down the street and

438
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:52.980
have a Sas Barilla with Todd Brexit.
Jesus fucking Christ he murdered on this.

439
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:57.270
People went out to my show was a lane about that guy.
How funny is he?

440
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:02.670
He's so fucking silly to sell.
He's one of my favorite things ever.
Um,

441
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:07.070
so anyways,
here we go.
Oh Jesus.
All Right,

442
00:27:07.071 --> 00:27:11.910
dial is shave club.
Everybody Dollar Shave Club keeps getting better.

443
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:17.930
They started four years ago by delivering their amazing affordable razors and

444
00:27:18.091 --> 00:27:22.470
they've grown to over 3 million members who no longer overpay for a quality

445
00:27:22.471 --> 00:27:26.550
morning shave.
And now new members can get their first month for free.

446
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:31.050
Dollar Shave Club is about,
is about so much more than just razors.

447
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:35.280
They have a mission.
They want you to look,
smell and feel your best.

448
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:39.750
And they've been investing millions in R and d developing whatever the fuck that

449
00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:43.980
means.
Their original grooming formulas for your face,
hair and body.

450
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.060
This stuff is amazing.
How,
how exactly do you work on that?

451
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:50.453
You know,

452
00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.660
you just find people that a Walmart that will loan their face to your fucking

453
00:27:54.661 --> 00:27:59.040
products and you make sure it doesn't mess up their face.
Is that what it is?

454
00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:03.030
20 to 14 patriots cause up.
It's good.
By the way.

455
00:28:03.031 --> 00:28:05.850
Cardinal fence that pass interference call in the end zone.

456
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.930
That's set up the field goal for 20 to 14 uh,
your rate,

457
00:28:09.931 --> 00:28:13.060
if you said that was bullshit,
that dude literally started falling down.

458
00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.750
He reached out and grabbed the other person like it was falling off a boat.

459
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.640
All right.
Anyways,
okay.
This stuff is amazing.

460
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.980
Evidently pre and post shave formula,

461
00:28:22.981 --> 00:28:26.610
skin protection formulas or do they shave the face of a rabbit?

462
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:28.140
They're always using rabbits.
You know,

463
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:32.910
rabbits have such a brutal life that I think that's why God let them fuck as

464
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:35.430
much as they do.
Because if they're not getting eaten by a snake,

465
00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.160
we're rubbing shampoo into their eyes and stuff,
you know,

466
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.310
cut their feet off so they can,
we can be lucky.
Um,

467
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.820
the staff is amazing.
Preimpose shaped formulas,
skin protection,
farmers,

468
00:28:47.821 --> 00:28:49.500
killer hairstyling products,

469
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:53.880
and literally the most amazing soap and body wash she'll ever use.

470
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.870
Hairstyling products.
I can't remember the last time I had to use those

471
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.480
as the thing about Moose in the late nineties.
Uh,

472
00:29:03.481 --> 00:29:07.440
the store experience is awful.
All this stuff looks the same.

473
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.010
There's too many options and no one's there to help you find the products that

474
00:29:11.011 --> 00:29:14.370
are right for you.
It's not true if you're going into the ladies' part,

475
00:29:14.371 --> 00:29:16.830
they always have somebody always wearing a lab coat.

476
00:29:16.831 --> 00:29:21.240
Like they went to fucking medical school.
Thank you.
Put clown makeup on fucking

477
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.800
soccer moms.
Right?
What's with this mark?

478
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.090
Do you have any idea why you picked the shampoo or body wash should do seriously

479
00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.360
just get all your grooming stuff shipped from dollar shave club.

480
00:29:33.361 --> 00:29:35.700
You don't have to deal with that shit anymore.
Give it a try.

481
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:39.210
Once you get in there,
you'll see the products work.
Amazingly.

482
00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:42.460
The service is world class and there's no commitment,

483
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.360
<v 2>no hidden fees.</v>

484
00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:47.010
What makes it world class that you order it and they ship it to you.
You can't.

485
00:29:47.011 --> 00:29:48.070
So whenever you want,

MVMT watches Michael Vincent,</v>

490
00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:06.450
Michael Thompson,
uh,
when you were in your early twenties and thirties,

491
00:30:06.451 --> 00:30:07.170
money can be [inaudible]

492
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:08.003
<v 1>tight</v>

493
00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.200
<v 2>if you're not careful,
dressing well can quickly drain your bank account.</v>

494
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:17.400
Like spending 400 to $500 on a department store.
Watch,
uh,

495
00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:19.430
there's some brands out there changing,

496
00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.720
charging insane prices for watches that aren't even worth it.
Well,

497
00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:25.520
if you want to look great when you go out,

498
00:30:25.521 --> 00:30:29.450
but still have enough money to buy him or her a drink,

watches.com um,

500
00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.800
I've seen them before of a deadly in these watches.
A sharp,
actually,
yes,

501
00:30:36.801 --> 00:30:39.740
they've sent them to me.
They're very sharp until you touch them.

502
00:30:39.741 --> 00:30:41.750
Then you're like,
oh,
that's not a thousand dollar watch.

503
00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.060
Originally founded by two broke college kids moving watches,

504
00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:49.220
cut the middleman out and that big brand retail markups in order to give you a

505
00:30:49.221 --> 00:30:53.600
stylish watch for an affordable price move and watch his star for just 95 bucks.

506
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.720
I'll watch with department store quality for a fraction of the price.

507
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.430
They're sleek,
minimalistic,

508
00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:03.460

516
00:31:27.071 --> 00:31:31.000
Beat the blitz.
Nice play Carson.
Calmer year,
wily veteran,

517
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:36.430
um,
trips to the post office have probably becomes second nature to you.

518
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.500
You put on your slippers,
right?

519
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:42.640
Take off your jam jams and you walked down the street with your hog hanging out

520
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:45.040
like everybody does when they go to the post office.

521
00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.540
They seem easy because you've been doing it mailing and shipping that way for so

522
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:52.990
long,
but think about the hassle if you really think about it.

523
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.550
All right.
Oh,
you knew you were getting a flag on that one.
Butler,

524
00:31:57.551 --> 00:32:02.551
that's fucking Fitzgerald and he's a fucking premier player.

525
00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:09.920
<v 2>Let's take a look at this again,
shall we?
Yeah,
she interfering,
joined the boot,</v>

526
00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.560
cut Fitch.
It's going to be a first down,

527
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.980
<v 1>but it was still running his mouth.
Whatever do when it counted,</v>

528
00:32:16.981 --> 00:32:20.760
you pick the ball off and you send everybody in Seattle crying.

529
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:26.450
All right,
that's a bit of a chuck there.
Yeah,
dude,
come on.

530
00:32:26.451 --> 00:32:30.080
You bumped into him.
It's still bullshit.
Back in the day,

531
00:32:30.081 --> 00:32:32.840
it wouldn't be a flag anyways.

532
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.650
<v 2>Okay.
Trips to the post office is probably come second.
I,
where the fuck am I?</v>

533
00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.880
Okay.
You know what I mean?
You used to go into the fucking post office,
right?

534
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.480
But if you really sit down and think about it,
I think what you have to do,

535
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.260
you have to drop what you're doing.
You've got to drive there.

536
00:32:45.261 --> 00:32:47.270
You have to find parking.
You got to wait.

537
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.820
You've got to sit behind that dose with 58 boxes.

538
00:32:49.821 --> 00:32:51.530
Are you going to fucking tackle that guy?

539
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.350
Jesus Christ down to the 10 anyways,

540
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.100
stamps dot coms.
It's way easier,

541
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.420
more convenient way to get posters right from your desk.

542
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:06.320
They make it easy to get the exact postage for any letter,
any package.

543
00:33:06.321 --> 00:33:09.230
I bounced to the outside.
Oh,
come on.

544
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:13.820
It was like five miss tackles there.
That's going to be on like,
oh my God,

545
00:33:13.821 --> 00:33:17.180
that was terrible.
That was terrible.
That right.

546
00:33:17.181 --> 00:33:18.290
That could have cost him the game.

547
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.220
That's going to be one of those things when they do the fucking Sunday night

548
00:33:22.221 --> 00:33:25.220
countdown,
whatever the hell they do there,
they're going to have the numbers.

549
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.380
Let's count the guys that missed a one,
a two,
a three,

550
00:33:30.381 --> 00:33:32.960
four,
five,

551
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:37.850
maybe seven guys had a shot at them.
Where are we?

552
00:33:37.851 --> 00:33:41.210
We're at the post office.
All right,
so they make it easier to any postage,

553
00:33:41.211 --> 00:33:43.030
any letter,
any,
any fucking thing you want to do.

554
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:46.400
No expensive postage meter to lease or no more trips to the post office.

555
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.690
You simply have to try it.
I use stamps.com anytime I send out my posters,

556
00:33:50.691 --> 00:33:53.440
which I'll be doing when I work in DC,
I'm going to make a poster there,

557
00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:56.420
few peoples,

562

You've had this offer since I've been advertising this.

565
00:34:17.871 --> 00:34:22.480
bar.
Ah,
right.
Okay.
Let's get back to the,
uh,

566
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.660
let's get back to the podcast too.
Alright,
what's 21 and 12?
Everybody?

567
00:34:26.661 --> 00:34:31.280
Why that's 33 minutes?
I think it's time.
I think it's time.

568
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:34.480
Nice stiff arm too.
Shit.
I think it's time to do some.
Uh,

569
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:40.520
let's do some questions here for the week.
All right,
mother Theresa.
No,

570
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.320
GS is Mother Teresa.

571
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:47.900
She's up there rubbing Jesus's head at this point.
Um,

572
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:50.210
hey there,
Billy angel tits.

573
00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.730
Uh,
you creative cons.
Um,

574
00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:00.300
way back when you talked about Mother Teresa,

575
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:03.900
I don't even remember this and how overrated she was.

576
00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:08.970
You didn't like her quotes that the US was morally bankrupt in that pub then

577
00:35:08.971 --> 00:35:13.971
that the poverty of spirit in the U s was the worst poverty she's seen.

578
00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:19.320
Including the hunger poverty in India.
Yeah.
I don't like people.

579
00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.320
I don't like people who don't live here talking shit about my country.

580
00:35:22.321 --> 00:35:24.180
If you want to shit on the u s and you live here,

581
00:35:24.181 --> 00:35:25.560
I don't have a fucking problem with that.

582
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.980
I do have a problem with the fact that the car knows almost just scored there.

583
00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.880
Um,
yeah,
we had been shut the fuck up.
You know what I mean?

584
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.720
Why would you talk shit about another country?
I mean I do it,

585
00:35:36.721 --> 00:35:39.500
but that's cause I want to sell tickets.
There.
You know,

586
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:43.350
you talk a little bit of trash.
Them selling the fight.
That's all.
Wow.

587
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:46.380
What a battle between Butler and Fitzgerald,
Hun.
He's hanging in there.

588
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:50.880
He's hanging in there.
Oh,
we should have caught that.
All right.

589
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.570
Sorry.
I'm going to stop watching the game.
No,
I'm not,

590
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:58.140
but I'm going to stop talking about it.
How about that?
All right.
All right,

591
00:35:58.141 --> 00:35:59.970
so I didn't like her talking shit about the country.

592
00:35:59.971 --> 00:36:01.560
Well now she's got to be a sink.

593
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:06.390
There are plenty of documentaries of things she did that had negative effects.

594
00:36:06.391 --> 00:36:10.860
Any thoughts on the Old Lady?
Come back to Seattle?
Well,
here's the deal.

595
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.790
When somebody gets made a saint,
it's a,

596
00:36:14.791 --> 00:36:18.870
it does not cause they did nice things.
First and foremost,

597
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:23.340
you had to make the Catholic church money,
right?
Is that who she works for?

598
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.450
And what she did by going around with all these poor people was,

599
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.630
she was like out in the field.
You know what I mean?

600
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:33.930
She's like that cop that never wanted to have a desk job wanting to be out on

601
00:36:33.931 --> 00:36:35.940
the beat,
be there with the people.

602
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:41.240
But the whole time she's selling that religion and it made them millions and

603
00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:42.211
millions of dollars,

604
00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:46.140
it took millions and millions and millions of dollars out of these poor people's

605
00:36:46.141 --> 00:36:47.580
heads,
you know,

606
00:36:47.581 --> 00:36:52.050
to basically invest in a fucking theory that has no,

607
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.080
you know,
no proof whatsoever.

608
00:36:55.081 --> 00:36:59.640
Basically invest all this money in.
Um,
ah,

609
00:36:59.641 --> 00:37:03.660
you son of a bitch.
Oh,
that's Fitzgerald.
He's 11.

610
00:37:03.661 --> 00:37:07.320
I thought he was 15 and I'm a fucking dope.
Nice catch.

611
00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:13.110
God Damn it.
He's a great player.
Ah,
Shit.

612
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:17.730
What the fuck is this going out?
I would really,
I liked the cardinals fan,

613
00:37:17.731 --> 00:37:20.040
but I really love the Patriots and when just cause the colts loft.

614
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:24.930
Look at the guys almost like an upside down.
Bounces it on his finger.

615
00:37:24.931 --> 00:37:29.200
Does he have control?
Does he make a football move?
Yes.

616
00:37:29.201 --> 00:37:31.800
He fucking caught it.
If they take this thing away,
I swear to God,

617
00:37:31.801 --> 00:37:33.600
I don't even know.
What do,
what does the guy you have to do?

618
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.660
Did he secure it up against it?
Um,
yeah,

619
00:37:39.661 --> 00:37:43.080
so I think she's a saint.
You know,
she,
you know,
she wants,
look,

620
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:44.910
even if she fucked over the poor,
she's still,

621
00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:47.250
they'd be down there in some of basically who's kidding who,

622
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:51.840
some of the stinky as smelly as parts of fucking humanity because you know when

623
00:37:51.841 --> 00:37:53.430
you have that level of poverty,
you know,

624
00:37:53.431 --> 00:37:55.020
and they don't have running water and stuff,

625
00:37:55.021 --> 00:37:59.280
people that just shitting everywhere.
You don't that alone,
the fact that you,

626
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:02.730
if you have access to first-world plumbing,

627
00:38:02.731 --> 00:38:06.030
if you go into the third world to try to help those people out.
Yeah,

628
00:38:06.031 --> 00:38:10.180
I think you are a saint.
I would think so.
Granted she sold them,
you know,

629
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.400
the whole fucking bill of good stereo with a mass murdering,
you know,

630
00:38:14.401 --> 00:38:17.220
child raping entity.
But other than that,
I mean,
so you know,

631
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:20.280
when those people say you're a saint,
does that really mean something?

632
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.640
I'm going to be honest with you.
I have no fucking idea what she did.

633
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:29.520
I know she was like Alicia keys and she didn't wear makeup.
I do know that.

634
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:33.120
I don't think she could play the piano.
Um,

635
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:39.210
yeah,
I have no idea.
Well now she's going to be a saint.
Look,
she's dead.
You know,

636
00:38:39.211 --> 00:38:42.300
I,
I made fun of when she was alive.
Now she's dead.
I think I can leave it alone.

637
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.760
All right.
Lobster,
anesthesia,

638
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.030
all Billy red lobster,
red.

639
00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:51.150
You don't have never eaten at a red lobster.

640
00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.600
I just never had the courage to fucking eat like fast food,

641
00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.800
seafood.
It just,

642
00:38:58.801 --> 00:39:03.120
it always seems like if anything's going to give you food poisoning,

643
00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.980
it's going to be,
it's going to be,
you know,

644
00:39:04.981 --> 00:39:07.950
the bottom feeders of the ocean right there.

645
00:39:07.951 --> 00:39:11.690
We're already eating the fecal matter there,
right?
So,
uh,

646
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:16.560
the only time I've ever been to a red lobster,
I actually performed there.

647
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.940
I remember a long time ago I did a standup show in a red lobster,

648
00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:25.380
but this fucking hilarious comedian Julie Bar and a couple other people.

649
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:30.000
And it was just one of those shows early in my career where you're going in

650
00:39:30.001 --> 00:39:32.490
there and everybody on the show before we go up,

651
00:39:32.491 --> 00:39:36.000
we all know we're going to take a fat one.
It's going to be difficult.

652
00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.680
And you just laugh and you just stand there going,
this is fucking impossible.

653
00:39:40.681 --> 00:39:44.490
This families here,
are we allowed to curse what's going to happen?

654
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:49.950
People got bibs on the train and they try to navigate this fucking little red

655
00:39:49.951 --> 00:39:52.320
dinosaur in their plate.
How the hell are you going to listen to me?

656
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:56.340
I suck when they're paying attention,
you know?
So anyways,

657
00:39:56.341 --> 00:39:58.590
let's get back to red lobster here.
Those acts,

658
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.920
there actually is a method that is supposed to,
and he said,

659
00:40:01.921 --> 00:40:06.921
I'm no lobster neurobiologists to numb lobsters before you boil them.

660
00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:10.920
You stick the lobster in the freezer for a few minutes.

661
00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:11.870
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

662
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.180
<v 2>before slicing it through the brain.</v>

663
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.550
The freezer is supposed to be the most humane way because at least

664
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.110
when people start to freeze to death,

665
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:28.060
they eventually feel a warmth go over them and they start to become unconscious.

666
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:33.040
Supposedly this helps the flavor because the anesthesia does creased,

667
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:38.100
dis decreases the stress hormones release compared to the dude being boiled.

668
00:40:38.111 --> 00:40:43.111
Well conscious or having its brain shopped and half like the obituary saw.

669
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:48.090
Hope this helps and have a blessed day.
Fuck Fucko um,

670
00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:50.210
<v 0>okay.</v>

671
00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:54.020
<v 2>If you stick a lobster in a freezer for a few minutes,
it's just going to freeze.</v>

672
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:58.730
It's just going to be really cold and be miserable and then you're gonna stick

673
00:40:58.731 --> 00:41:01.970
it in the fucking hot water.
I just,
I,
you know something.

674
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:07.010
I'm never eaten lobster again.
Okay.
They do enough bad shit.

675
00:41:07.011 --> 00:41:11.420
The chicken and cows and stuff,
I don't need to add this.
It's just so fucked up.

676
00:41:11.421 --> 00:41:14.990
I was watching this thing on this French restaurant and this guy takes these

677
00:41:14.991 --> 00:41:19.620
live lobsters and puts him over an open flame.
It's just like,
yeah,

678
00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.320
I always go back to that time.

679
00:41:21.321 --> 00:41:25.520
I watched that chimpanzee catch that smaller monkey and he stood on the thing

680
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:29.300
and he just started just digging into his back,
pulling it's back,

681
00:41:29.301 --> 00:41:31.430
meet out is this thing was screaming.

682
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.090
It's just like when for fucking animals,
man,

683
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:37.910
there's no fucking reason to do that,
man.

684
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:43.990
I still think what I'm saying is better.
You just take a little lobster bat.

685
00:41:43.991 --> 00:41:47.790
You Bash it over their head immediately unconscious.

686
00:41:47.791 --> 00:41:50.110
Like if somebody hit you in the head is hard as it could with the bat,

687
00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.990
you're not going to feel any pain.
You're not even gonna fucking remember it.

688
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.520
He can't do that to those things.
I don't know.
It just seems wrong.

689
00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:02.140
All right,
so it's 2120 we just took a fucking sack.
Nice play.

690
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:06.790
God dammit.
Bull Rush.
Jones right up the fucking middle.

691
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:09.910
Gave us the old right there,
Fred.
But you know what?

692
00:42:09.911 --> 00:42:13.570
Look at fucking Jimmy graph below here.
Garappolo he's doing great.

693
00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.300
We're hanging in there.
Cardinals are no slouches right there.

694
00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:22.060
They always go to the Superbowl last year
while we even held on that play.

695
00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.193
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

696
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:28.560
<v 2>gave a little spin move.
Alright,
grumpy below goat.
Billy goat.</v>

697
00:42:28.561 --> 00:42:33.300
Terrorizes town.
All right.
Evidently I'm supposed to watch this.
All right,

698
00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.690
I'll watch it.
Here we go with my hotel.
Internet.

699
00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:38.200
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

700
00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.770
<v 2>Oh,
this is great.
I love coach.
So it was just two people on a scooter.</v>

701
00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.900
It's fucking thing.
Just knocks him over by watching late.

702
00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:49.960
You got to feel the backside pressure,
backside pressure.
Get rid of the ball.

703
00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.430
Get rid of the ball.
Are you looking for the Tom Brady fucking treatment?
Yeah,

704
00:42:54.431 --> 00:42:59.260
that's it.
No flag there.
C'Mon UFC.
You can't kick when they're down.

705
00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.210
I look at this guy coming in.
There you go.
Front kicked.
Fun Kid.

706
00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:10.930
Always going like,
what's his face there?
Come on man.

707
00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:14.890
What do I root for you?
This is,
this is,
you know what?
Come on.

708
00:43:14.891 --> 00:43:17.460
I want the guy in the striped shirt.
There you go.
Kick that motherfucker.

709
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.900
You hit your lady.
This thing's a pimp.

710
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.880
Should have kicked it right and it's fucking other

711
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:30.130
dude.
I would grab that thing by his fucking head.

712
00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.470
Is that a cop?
That's hilarious.

713
00:43:35.471 --> 00:43:38.470
This is definitely another country that was a cop here,
that fucking shooting.

714
00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:42.700
He loves that.
Doing the stripe shirt.

715
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:50.460
Sky's going to slip and fall and crack his head.
Dude.
He runs like a girl.

716
00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:55.210
Come on man.
How was that was interesting.
I like to,
I like,
yeah,

717
00:43:55.211 --> 00:43:59.110
I love Goldsmith.
The thing is that you can't,
you can't show any fear,
man.

718
00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.360
I like how that guy was trying.
He was trying to give him the,
the,

719
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:05.670
the front kicks,
like the Anderson Silva.
Right.
Um,

720
00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:11.080
all right.
I don't know why.
I Dunno.
Why?
Why the fuck would I watch that?

721
00:44:11.081 --> 00:44:14.470
You guys can't see it,
right?
Well,
you know what?
Grumpy bill.
Billy goat.

722
00:44:14.471 --> 00:44:16.930
Terrorizes town.
That's what you want to look at.

723
00:44:16.931 --> 00:44:21.040
If you want to see the commentary there and where the fuck was I?
All right.

724
00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.770
I love goats,
man.
I've ever tell you that shit.

725
00:44:23.771 --> 00:44:25.840
Like that's the best of pet I should have had.

726
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:30.070
They just smelled really bad though.
But like,
you know,
they have like,

727
00:44:30.071 --> 00:44:33.960
I was like wrestling with my dog and shit,
but it makes the dog aggressive.

728
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:36.720
But goats are already like that and they live outside.

729
00:44:36.721 --> 00:44:40.440
So then I couldn't be anywhere near your company.
I should get,
you know,

730
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:42.450
that's the next thing I'm like,
I'm going to get a goat,
right?

731
00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:46.770
I just have it in a pen.
Get it a friend.
Right.
They can fucking hang out.

732
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.130
And then every morning I'll come out there and I'd be like,
what's up?
You know,

733
00:44:50.131 --> 00:44:54.150
reach over the fence,
grab it,
bites beer,
get a little fucking Yankee,
you know,

734
00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:55.560
get the thing going.

735
00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:02.620
Wrestle around with it for a little bit.
All right.
Dad Won't quit smoking.
Oh,

736
00:45:02.621 --> 00:45:06.670
Jesus.
Your Dad will not quit smoking.

737
00:45:06.671 --> 00:45:09.580
What the Hell's wrong with him?
He's going to,
it's going to kill himself.

738
00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.340
All right.
Hey,
Billy.
Red Nuts.

739
00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:17.370
My Dad's been smoking since he was 14 years old and it's 62 years old.

740
00:45:17.711 --> 00:45:22.030
He recently had his second heart attack.
Jesus Christ.

741
00:45:22.031 --> 00:45:23.860
The doctor has told them flat out.

742
00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:25.020
<v 4>Okay,</v>

743
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.980
<v 2>if you want to live,
you have to talk.
You have to stop smoking.</v>

744
00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:31.643
<v 4>MMM.</v>

745
00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.330
<v 2>Yeah,
I would think so.
Even after hearing this,</v>

746
00:45:34.331 --> 00:45:38.140
he lit up a cigar five minutes after getting out of the hospital.

747
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.750
I got into a huge argument with him about it and I told him,

748
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:46.590
if you didn't give a shit about his health,
then I shouldn't care either.

749
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:50.910
We didn't talk for months.
Wow.
Dude,
this is fucking heavier.

750
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:56.790
Uh,
we've tried to,
we've tried reasoning with him.
We've tried to yelling at him.

751
00:45:56.791 --> 00:46:00.930
We've tried guilting him with a don,
you want to walk me down the aisle routine.

752
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:06.150
None of it works to clarify.
He smoked cigars every single day,

753
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.930
all throughout the day.
So it's more than an occasional puff.

754
00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.610
Uh,
his diminishing health is visible in his everyday interactions with us.

755
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:19.180
It's harder for him to breathe.
He can't,
is he inhaling?

756
00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:23.390
He can't walk as fast as or as far as he used to.

757
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.280
He can barely play with his grandkids and his face his age to immensely since

758
00:46:28.281 --> 00:46:32.480
the last heart attack,
every time I get a call from a family member,

759
00:46:32.481 --> 00:46:36.830
I get anxious that it's going to be the call telling you my dad has had his last

760
00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:38.300
heart attack.
It's,

761
00:46:38.301 --> 00:46:42.050
I'm constantly on pins and needles and it's really starting to affect me.
Yeah,

762
00:46:42.051 --> 00:46:42.884
I would think so.

763
00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:44.893
<v 4>Uh,</v>

764
00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:48.260
<v 2>is someone who has struggled with certain vices yourself,</v>

765
00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:52.760
what finally made you feel like you want it to limit your intake?

766
00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:53.721
Uh,

767
00:46:53.721 --> 00:46:58.721
is there a way I could get through to my father and get them to quit for good or

768
00:46:59.601 --> 00:47:04.070
should I just accept the fact that we all go someday and let him enjoy himself

769
00:47:04.071 --> 00:47:07.220
for the limited amount of time he has left?
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.

770
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:09.430
All right.
Wow.
Um,

771
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:12.040
<v 4>okay.</v>

772
00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:12.251
<v 2>All right.</v>

773
00:47:12.251 --> 00:47:15.460
What makes me want to limit my intake is cause I don't want to end up being like

774
00:47:15.461 --> 00:47:16.294
that.

775
00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:17.530
<v 4>MMM.</v>

776
00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:24.770
<v 2>But I also,
I don't know,
I don't like having shit have control over me,</v>

777
00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:30.130
you know what I mean?
And,
uh,
I also found that like when you just smoking

778
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.730
<v 1>a cigar,
you know,
if you smoke too much,
like they,</v>

779
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:38.020
they're not special anymore.
Like,
it's great when,
you know,

780
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:41.500
I like now just planning a cigar night,
like a couple of weeks away,

781
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.450
like a,
the absolutely fucking hilarious.

782
00:47:46.451 --> 00:47:49.570
Bert Kreischer is,
um,

783
00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.360
one of the great guys you could have a hang out with,

784
00:47:52.361 --> 00:47:57.000
forget about smoke a cigar with,
he's trying to organize a cigar night.
And um,

785
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.250
I already have it circled on my calendar.
I'm excited.

786
00:48:00.251 --> 00:48:04.570
I'm thinking about what cigar I'm going to have.
But like when I just,
you know,

787
00:48:04.571 --> 00:48:07.780
have a whole box of them and every night I'm just going out there smoking.

788
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:12.030
It's just,
he starts smelling like a cigar.
It's bad.
It's like,
you know,

789
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:14.440
if I'm drinking every night,
I dunno.

790
00:48:14.441 --> 00:48:17.890
It's just one of those things where I don't like the way I feel.

791
00:48:17.891 --> 00:48:22.210
I don't like the way I feel when I wake up in the morning.
And I know it's bad.

792
00:48:22.211 --> 00:48:25.300
I know it's aging me.
I just know,
I know it's bad for me.

793
00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:30.720
But with your dad that he's been doing this for so fucking long.

794
00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:33.500
<v 4>MMM,</v>

795
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:36.730
<v 1>I would definitely,</v>

796
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:42.810
I would be livid at my dad if he was doing that and I would be unbelievably

797
00:48:42.971 --> 00:48:47.971
frustrated and I would continue obviously to try to get them to stop because you

798
00:48:48.341 --> 00:48:51.790
love your dad,
you know?
However,

799
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.740
there does come a point where it's just like,
if

800
00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:02.920
the person has resigned themselves to,
this is what they want to do.
I mean,

801
00:49:02.921 --> 00:49:06.220
if he just had his fucking second heart attack and the doctors going,
listen,

802
00:49:06.221 --> 00:49:11.221
you're going to die if you don't stop smoking any walks out and literally just

803
00:49:11.261 --> 00:49:14.140
lights up a cigar.
Um,

804
00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:19.610
obviously he's a complete addict and,
but
I dunno,

805
00:49:19.611 --> 00:49:21.930
he's not fighting it on any level.
So,
um,

806
00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:28.860
I dunno,
depending on how exhausted you are.
I know myself,

807
00:49:28.861 --> 00:49:33.690
after awhile I would just say,
you know what,
fuck it.
Um,

808
00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.860
and it would suck because when my dad,
if my dad died like that,
I would,

809
00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:42.890
there would be a definite level of resentment and anger that I would have had

810
00:49:43.381 --> 00:49:47.700
him.
But I,
I just think maybe the piece you can find is that he's addicted.

811
00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:52.380
He's an addict and this isn't your father making this decision.

812
00:49:52.381 --> 00:49:57.330
It's the chemicals and all of that shift that makes you make sure you do this.

813
00:49:57.331 --> 00:50:00.480
That's really unfortunate,
man.
There's really nothing funny in there.

814
00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:06.000
Jesus.
I was going to smoke a cigar night too.

815
00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:14.640
Um,
well I guess that's fucking,
that's out the God damn window.
Jesus Christ.

816
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.820
Anyways,
start to shake that off.
All right.
Uh,

817
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:26.220
advice strip club with wife.
Oh,
Jesus.

818
00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:31.110
A builder.
Uh,
that's a good one.
I've heard that one before,

819
00:50:31.111 --> 00:50:33.000
but it's always nice to bring that went back.

820
00:50:33.001 --> 00:50:38.001
Me and my wife in six of our friends are planning a trip to Vegas early next

821
00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:41.310
year.
Bars,
strip clubs,
the whole Shebang.

822
00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:45.990
I'm 27 and my wife is 26.
We've been married for four years.

823
00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:50.430
I was wondering if you are near or past girlfriends have gone to strip clubs

824
00:50:50.431 --> 00:50:53.310
together and if so,
what's the etiquette?

825
00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:56.370
Neither me and my wife had been to a strip club before.

826
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.070
Obviously I wouldn't mind taking in the sights,

827
00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:02.610
but also don't want to be a piece of shit.
Oh God,

828
00:51:02.611 --> 00:51:06.000
this has fucking train wreck written all over.

829
00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:07.170
<v 4>Okay.</v>

830
00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:10.140
<v 1>I know this isn't exactly something on my wife's bucket list,</v>

831
00:51:10.141 --> 00:51:11.910
but I don't think she'll hate it either.

832
00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:15.330
She's told me in the past she appreciates the female body.

833
00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.510
Not necessarily grinding on mine though.

834
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:20.260
<v 4>MMM.</v>

835
00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:24.780
<v 1>I think she probably enjoyed it more.
If I wasn't there.
Lol.</v>

836
00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:28.020
Would love to know what you and near would have to say on the subject.
Thanks.

837
00:51:28.021 --> 00:51:32.650
Well,
Nia is not here.
This is what I would say.
Okay.

838
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:34.503
Um,

839
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:36.030
<v 4>okay.</v>

840
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:40.530
<v 1>You need to stay as sober as humanly fucking possible and you need to not</v>

841
00:51:40.531 --> 00:51:43.380
indulge it all.
Your indulgent should be,

842
00:51:43.381 --> 00:51:48.130
is your wife enjoying the experience?
That's what should do.
All right.

843
00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:53.230
And,
uh,
I would not get a fucking lap dance in front of my wife.

844
00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.680
I would not do that.
Not that my white Neil wouldn't give a shit,

845
00:51:56.681 --> 00:51:59.260
but my wife is like ridiculously fucking cool.

846
00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:03.710
My wife is honestly one of the coolest females.
She,

847
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:05.650
she transcends her sex.

848
00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.720
The only reason why I say she's a cool female is because so many of them are

849
00:52:10.721 --> 00:52:13.390
fucking nightmares and they won't let you do anything.

850
00:52:13.391 --> 00:52:17.800
They won't let you have any fun or whatever.
Like she just,
you know,

851
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:21.610
gee guys here on the podcast,
she's,
that's not an act.

852
00:52:21.611 --> 00:52:26.320
She's that fucking cool and funny,
but most people are not in that situation.

853
00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:31.210
So it's the,
there's a few red flags in there.
You're going with other couples,

854
00:52:31.211 --> 00:52:35.680
like let the other couples get into the fights because somebody is going to go

855
00:52:35.681 --> 00:52:38.770
to fucking far,
somebody's going to get too drunk.

856
00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:43.330
Somebody gonna fuck up and somebody is going to have that fucking thing brought

857
00:52:43.331 --> 00:52:47.740
up for the next 10 years in their fucking marriage because God knows that's what

858
00:52:47.741 --> 00:52:52.510
the fuck they do.
So all your mission that night is,
is to not be that guy.

859
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:56.470
Strip clubs are not going anywhere.
Okay.

860
00:52:56.620 --> 00:53:00.320
You can always go to one another night when she's not fucking there.

861
00:53:00.321 --> 00:53:04.870
Or if she actually ends up having a good time the second time and just literally

862
00:53:04.871 --> 00:53:05.830
tell,
just say,
listen,

863
00:53:05.831 --> 00:53:09.010
I wasn't going to get drunk and I was going to do anything to embarrass you,

864
00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.690
then she'll fucking respect you.

865
00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:15.790
So I would just say go really easy on the booze there and uh,

866
00:53:15.791 --> 00:53:20.460
you know,
get your wife a fucking lap dance.
That's what you do.
And then just,

867
00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:21.373
you know,

868
00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:22.350
<v 4>yeah.</v>

869
00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:24.210
<v 1>And just say,
you're good,
you're good.
You know,</v>

870
00:53:24.211 --> 00:53:28.080
and when you're fucking friends are all trying to pressure you into doing some,

871
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.990
just tell him to go,
you know,
Jay,
yeah,
I'm cool.
I'm cool.
Don't worry.

872
00:53:30.991 --> 00:53:35.820
I'm having a good time.
Okay.
And let them do all the dumb shit.

873
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.980
Let them wake up the next day.

874
00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:41.820
When you guys go to breakfast and be the ones that have to say,
hey,
say hey,

875
00:53:41.821 --> 00:53:46.560
look crazy and or be the ones that are clearly just had a huge fight and are not

876
00:53:46.561 --> 00:53:49.800
talking during breakfast.
You don't need that shit.
All right?

877
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:54.390
You don't need that shit.
It's a very,
um,
all of that type of shit.

878
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.570
There's like when you're sitting there going,
what are the rules?

879
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:58.870
The rules are the rules,

880
00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:03.270
<v 2>rules that you and your wife come up with.
And um,</v>

881
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:08.960
the fact that your wife has never been to one is just all of the fucking makings

882
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:14.180
of a shit show.
So like I said,
I'm not going to read it.

883
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.280
I'm gonna say this again because you were a young guy.
Do not be the drunk guy.

884
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:20.490
And I'm telling you,
just make sure she has a good time.

885
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.760
Ask her if she's all right,
ask her if this is cool.

886
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:25.470
If she wants to get out of there,

887
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:30.540
just totally be attentive to her and there's no way it can be a fucking problem.

888
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.810
And then you can get on with you God damn life and then fucking whatever.

889
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:38.700
Some other time you go to a titty bar,
maybe you bring her along,
you know,

890
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:41.750
she might fucking end up wanting to see you get a fucking lap dance and you're

891
00:54:41.751 --> 00:54:45.930
like,
you serious?
Yeah.
And then she'll be like,
all right,
which one do you want?

892
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.450
You know,
and then that's another thing that could be

893
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:51.490
<v 1>be a fight.
You know what I mean?
You fucking pick some,
you know,
I don't,</v>

894
00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:57.030
I don't,
that's just one of those,
it's just,
it's just one of those things.

895
00:54:57.031 --> 00:55:01.710
I remember one time,
um,
there's this famous,

896
00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:07.560
um,
strip club in Los Angeles called jumbo was clown room.

897
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:12.900
Okay.
And it is just as creepy and disgusting as it sound.

898
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:16.890
I don't think it's not that anymore.
It's,
it's way better now.

899
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:21.930
But back in the day,
it was literally like,

900
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.730
you know,
if I was a serial killer,
like that would be my Starbucks,

901
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:27.623
you know what I mean?

902
00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:32.760
Sit there with my laptop in a chat room with other serial killers.
I mean,

903
00:55:32.761 --> 00:55:35.520
it was a fucking disgusting place.
So,

904
00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.080
<v 4>yeah,</v>

905
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.880
<v 1>I had been there,
uh,</v>

906
00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:44.570
maybe three times over the course of 20 years going out to La and it was always

907
00:55:44.791 --> 00:55:48.580
just a shady shifty fucking place.
So one time,
um,

908
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:53.010
I was out with Nia and she's brought up that she wanted to go to this fucking

909
00:55:53.011 --> 00:55:57.090
place and I was just like,
are you serious?
You want to go to that place?

910
00:55:57.091 --> 00:55:58.650
I don't want to go to that playground other places.

911
00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:01.800
It's not a cool place where I'd have since she goes,
come on,
let's just go.

912
00:56:01.801 --> 00:56:06.090
So I fuck it.
Let's go.
It was her fucking idea.
So we ended up going there.

913
00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:11.120
By the way,
it's 23,
21 with three 38 to go.
I already know.

914
00:56:11.121 --> 00:56:12.770
You guys know who won this fucking game

915
00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:18.310
<v 2>lag on the fucking cardinals.
I love it.
Take it back.
Take it back.
By the way,</v>

916
00:56:18.311 --> 00:56:22.390
I forget the cardinals coach man,
but I saw a great,
uh,

917
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:24.130
they did a whole on the guy.
Seems

918
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:28.870
<v 1>like the fucking coolest dude ever.
Um,
but anyways,</v>

919
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:29.793
um,

920
00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:34.450
so we ended up going there and I sat over in the corner.

921
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:36.190
I didn't get a lap dance or anything like that,

922
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:37.690
but I think I've told this story before.

923
00:56:37.691 --> 00:56:42.250
I literally saw a stripper quit on stage that night.
It was fucking amazing.

924
00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:43.900
Um,

925
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:48.900
we walked in and there was like one guy sitting up near the stage and there was

926
00:56:49.271 --> 00:56:54.160
like three other people up at the bar with their backs to the stage.

927
00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:58.510
So this woman comes out

928
00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:04.750
looking a little rough,
you know,
and uh,
she starts doing the things,

929
00:57:04.751 --> 00:57:09.370
she dances to one song,
the song ends,
nobody claps.

930
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:11.103
Okay.

931
00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:15.820
The guy who was sitting up near the stage was not there anymore.

932
00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:17.990
So now it,

933
00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:23.250
it kind of becomes like a philosophical,

934
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:24.790
philosophical question.

935
00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:29.970
Like basically if I'm in a strip club dancing,

936
00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:35.680
but nobody's watching me,
am I technically still in show business?
Right.

937
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:38.050
So basically what happened was,

938
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:43.960
<v 2>you know,
no one was fucking paying attention.
So she ends the first song,</v>

939
00:57:43.961 --> 00:57:48.130
you know,
you know,
cause I'm won it dead or alive.

940
00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:52.630
She slowly slides down the pole and then the next song starts and she's just

941
00:57:52.631 --> 00:57:56.590
laying there and she's not dancing,
she's not doing anything.

942
00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:00.930
And I'm going like,
oh my God,
this was like watching a boxer,

943
00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:04.600
like not answer the belt.
Right.
And just quitting on the stool.

944
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:09.990
And She just rolled over and somehow she had her cell phone and she just started

945
00:58:10.031 --> 00:58:14.170
checking like her fucking emails.
And at that point,
like this,

946
00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:19.880
<v 1>one of the bar back ladies walked by,
saw it and laughed and said,
that's awesome.</v>

947
00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:24.310
<v 2>And she just laid there for the rest of the song and didn't dance and gathered</v>

948
00:58:24.311 --> 00:58:26.860
us shit.
Didn't take up any more of a close.

949
00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.620
And then like she quit being a stripper.
She just quit

950
00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:32.230
<v 1>dancing for the night.
And uh,</v>

951
00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:37.180
I thought it was fucking awesome because fuck it Larry Fitzgerald.

952
00:58:37.181 --> 00:58:39.040
What a catch.
God Damn it.

953
00:58:39.041 --> 00:58:42.730
That guy's good at marching down the field.
It looks,

954
00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:46.260
doesn't look like we're in a prevent though,
so that's good.
You know what,

955
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:49.120
in the fuck I got,
here it comes,
they're going to be in two more catches.

956
00:58:49.121 --> 00:58:53.560
They're going to be in fucking field goal position,
ripping out hard out there.

957
00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:57.570
And,
um,
so anyways,
she ends up,
uh,

958
00:58:57.990 --> 00:59:00.750
<v 2>yeah,
just as a performer,
I respected it.
You know what I mean?</v>

959
00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.570
It's like if you're a comedian,
I'm doing my act and no one's listening.

960
00:59:03.571 --> 00:59:04.470
No one's paying attention.

961
00:59:04.471 --> 00:59:07.560
I'm just going to stop and I'm going to shit on the crop.
That's it.

962
00:59:07.561 --> 00:59:09.240
Am I going to waste my time doing my material?

963
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:11.040
So why should she take her bottoms off?

964
00:59:11.041 --> 00:59:13.800
It showed everybody the fucking world if they're not even gonna look at it.

965
00:59:14.770 --> 00:59:15.603
<v 1>Right.</v>

966
00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:19.440
<v 2>So there you go.
There's my fucking stripper story.</v>

967
00:59:19.441 --> 00:59:22.580
But me and Nia never had a problem.
I think I want to see,
I've gone to a couple.

968
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.710
<v 4>Okay.</v>

969
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:26.140
<v 2>Yeah.
My,
it will come.
Maybe one other with her.</v>

970
00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:27.873
<v 4>MMM.</v>

971
00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:30.470
<v 2>I gotta tell you it's not fun.</v>

972
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:32.400
<v 4>Okay.</v>

973
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:36.870
<v 2>It's not fun to go to a titty bar with your wife or even with other women.</v>

974
00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:40.080
It's just like everything.
I used to do a bit in my act about that.

975
00:59:40.081 --> 00:59:43.800
Like when women started going to titty bars,
they would always go like,
you know,

976
00:59:43.801 --> 00:59:47.220
at some point they always say,
this is,
this isn't as bad as I thought it was.

977
00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:49.470
And it was,
isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.

978
00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:52.410
And the joke of my act was,
yeah,
cause you are here,

979
00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:56.150
leave and it'll get evil again.
Um,

980
00:59:56.770 --> 00:59:59.610
it's one of the worst things ever that happened that women started going to

981
00:59:59.611 --> 01:00:01.830
titty bars.
You know what I mean?
It's like,

982
01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:03.960
can't you just go to a fucking mail one?

983
01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.500
Did you go to the fucking Dale one and have so fucking Goddamn Dick swinging in

984
01:00:09.501 --> 01:00:14.360
your face?
If you're a lesbian then yeah,
come on in.
Have a good time.
Right.

985
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:19.670
It's just like they just constantly,
they just constantly have to be around us.

986
01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:24.260
It's fucking unbelievable.
They think we're stupid.
They think we do dumb shit,

987
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:28.460
but they just can't get enough a doing every dumb fucking thing that we do that

988
01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:30.410
down to the 28 fucking yard line.

989
01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:33.493
<v 4>Okay.</v>

990
01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:36.200
<v 2>The Angel of the announcers are going to be in,
right?
No,
no.
The question is,</v>

991
01:00:36.201 --> 01:00:39.500
are they leaving too much until I'm on the clock or assuming that they hit this

992
01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:40.334
field goal.

993
01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:41.540
<v 4>Okay.</v>

994
01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:44.300
<v 2>I actually liked it.
This is going to happen cause if they kicked this field,</v>

995
01:00:44.301 --> 01:00:46.220
go right,
what are they going to be up by one or something?

996
01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.253
Is that what it's going to be?

997
01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.360
And then we get to watch Jimmy go down and do his thing.

998
01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.640
He's going to get some experience.
I got to tell you,

999
01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:55.070
I've been impressed with them.
He's playing all right.

1000
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:59.620
You know that kid for fucking Dallas played all right.
And the dude,

1001
01:00:59.621 --> 01:01:01.040
they're on Tampa Bay.

1002
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.990
I guess like Jason Law had said a long time ago.
He's like that guy,

1003
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.140
even though we saw them get destroyed in the fucking Roseville,

1004
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.410
he was still talking about him.
Jamieson,
right?

1005
01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.760
Don Jamison and Leslie,

1006
01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:18.860
it's the fucking comedian there from fucking a that,
that metal show.

1007
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.520
Whatever he was saying that if,
um,

1008
01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:24.800
<v 4>if a,</v>

1009
01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.790
<v 2>you know,
he had a couple of,
I feel like I had said,</v>

1010
01:01:27.791 --> 01:01:30.140
so give me a couple of good white ops in that fucking quarterback and you could

1011
01:01:30.141 --> 01:01:32.930
do something in the NFL and it's looking like he's right.

1012
01:01:32.931 --> 01:01:37.760
He had four fucking touchdown passes today.
It's incredible.
Um,
of course.

1013
01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:39.830
Yet another thing that I missed here.
So anyways,
all right,

1014
01:01:39.831 --> 01:01:40.940
that's the podcast here.

1015
01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:45.650
I'm going to sweat this out or do you guys want me to hang in here?
I can't.

1016
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.590
I can't cause it's almost 1130 and I have an early fucking flight.

1017
01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:52.220
I know you cardinal fans,
if you won,
you want to hear my fucking devastation.

1018
01:01:52.221 --> 01:01:54.590
But if we win,
you're not gonna hear me fucking Sharon.

1019
01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:58.790
All I know is that the colts lost.
And even if we lose,

1020
01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.260
I think that's fucking fair.

1021
01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:05.390
And if the colts actually had the same fucking record that we have at the end of

1022
01:02:05.391 --> 01:02:09.530
this fucking travesty of a Goddamn horseshit suspension,

1023
01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:14.360
um,
then I will say that God,
not only is God a fair God,

1024
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:18.940
he's also a football fan and he is a man,
by the way.
All

1025
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.560
<v 1>he is a man.
So get that right out of your fucking head.</v>

1026
01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:27.570
There's no way God's a woman.
Because if God was a woman,
he wouldn't create,

1027
01:02:27.571 --> 01:02:31.980
she wouldn't create,
you know,
a fucking animal like me.
All right,
that's it.

1028
01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:35.220
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll check in you on Thursday.
Promise.

1029
01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:40.140
I'll watch the fucking UFC event and a very excited about the first Ram's home

1030
01:02:40.141 --> 01:02:43.920
game.
I think it's so fucking cool that they're back in La and a,

1031
01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:46.800
it would be great if the the fucking cardinals would uh,

1032
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.390
moved back to Saint Louis.

1033
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:51.780
I wonder if saying love Saint Louis fans now that is going to be this weird

1034
01:02:51.781 --> 01:02:55.710
thing.
They don't have a team.
The older generation.

1035
01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:57.210
I bet it's still cardinal fans.

1036
01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:00.510
But then you won the younger ones that they still gonna follow the rams or do

1037
01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:03.780
they feel like they've been burned?
I have no fucking idea.

1038
01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:06.720
Go ahead and throw the ball again,
Carson.
Go ahead.
Fuck it.
Throw it again.

1039
01:03:06.721 --> 01:03:07.620
That now they'd not.

1040
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:10.163
<v 4>What are they doing here?</v>

1041
01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.800
<v 1>What is it there on the 33 yard line?
Am I what do you,
what do you add?
18 yards?</v>

1042
01:03:14.801 --> 01:03:18.830
Is that what you had?
33.
It's like a 50,

1043
01:03:18.831 --> 01:03:23.210
51 yard at this point.
I'll tell you,
this is no poke poke.

1044
01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.110
All right.
I got to end this and sweat this fucking thing out.

1045
01:03:27.111 --> 01:03:31.490
We're up by to you mother fuckers.
All right.
Once again,

1046
01:03:31.491 --> 01:03:35.690
Bill Bellacheck showing why he's the greatest of all fucking time.
Look at this,

1047
01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:40.580
Huh?
It was a nine point spread.
Patriots are getting nine points at home.

1048
01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:46.130
Tremendous.
Fucking tremendous.
Were up by two with a minute.
55 left.

1049
01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:49.430
Um,
all right.
Dad said,
go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you on Thursday.
