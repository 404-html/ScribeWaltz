1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.133
Okay.

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.930
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on is bill burr</v>

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.530
and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,

4
00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:14.230
Monday morning podcast.
And I'm checking in on you,

5
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:17.080
although the way I was just cloth when you should be checking in on me.

6
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.990
What are you thinking?
Hey,
what are he smoking and budgets?
You guys,
your bill?
No,

7
00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:23.350
I'm not.
I was just,
uh,
I just,
I got a little sick.

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.840
<v 0>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.600
<v 1>I got a little sick,
but not entirely.
I just got a little sick.</v>

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.410
I just wrapped on my general hospital,
my,

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.450
my 72 episode arc on General Hospital,

12
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.330
um,
12 hour days,
six days a week.
And uh,

13
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.210
we knocked it out and I actually got to see a sneak peek of the,

14
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.440
obviously it's not journal hospital.

15
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:49.890
I got to see this sneak peek of this thing that I'm going to be a small part of.

16
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:53.790
As always,
I always paratroop into things that are really cool.

17
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:57.600
I'm never the main guy.
All right.
That,
that,
that's not the road for me.

18
00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.103
<v 0>You know,</v>

19
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.620
<v 1>I'm a bald,
redheaded male.
Okay.
I know the deal.
I'm in the background.
I get it.</v>

20
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.431
All right.
You know,

21
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:08.570
you don't see me cold complaining like some of these fat chicks out here in

22
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:12.020
Hawaii and I used almost said Hawaii out here in Hollywood.
Like,
oh,

23
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.210
how come I'm not starting in a,
in a,

24
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:18.440
in a fucking movie because you look like me with a dress.
That's why.

25
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.060
Okay.
And people invest money and they want to make it back.
Okay.

26
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:26.960
So at some point you're going to have to deal with the fact that you know,

27
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.630
you're in the van,
man.
All right.
You're not picking the fucking safe.

28
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.460
The lock on the safe.
Anyways,
we rapped on it.
I had a great time.

29
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.410
I took some chances as an actor,
I learned some things.

30
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.253
<v 0>MMM.</v>

31
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.960
<v 1>I,
I learned what I always learned whenever I go on a shoot like that.</v>

32
00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:50.530
Just the sheer amount of fucking work,

33
00:01:50.531 --> 00:01:54.580
how hard everybody works on those things.
And it just kills me.

34
00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:59.050
Whenever these politicians,
none of these politicians run for office.

35
00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:00.160
Who Do they talk about?

36
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.160
Did they talk about people busting their asses?

37
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.860
Like people who fucking write scripts and people got to figure out how to then,

38
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:11.980
you know,
fucking shoot the thing and all these different looks.

39
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:14.800
And now when they talk about Joe six pack,

40
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.740
Joe Sixpack fucking putting his pants on one leg at a fucking time.

41
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.350
He's got time to go drink a fucking six peck,

42
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.773
<v 0>you know,</v>

43
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.940
<v 1>some fucking dope just driving around in a,
in a,
you know,</v>

44
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.720
I don't know why no fucking ice cream truck.

45
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.620
He's getting more love from the next potential president of the United States.

46
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.750
Did that.
Somebody has got to stand there,

47
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:41.640
hold the fucking microphone over some ball.
Jackass like me for 12 hours a day.

48
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.030
I Dunno.
I think these politicians are rock.

49
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.470
Maybe if all these fucking Hollywood people would quit shitting on half of them.

50
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.470
Maybe the hardworking people in the movie industry,
we get a little more love.

51
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.210
That's just,
just,
I'm just thinking out loud here,
people.
Um,
anyways,

52
00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:03.211
I had a awesome time and I got to work with some amazing actors and uh,

53
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.033
you know,

54
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.910
<v 0>yeah,</v>

55
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.020
<v 1>just great storytellers and all that and I had a great fucking time.</v>

56
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:15.790
Having said that,
I'm old and I'm exhausted.
Um,
all right.

57
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.760
And I got to jump on a red eye tonight to go out,

58
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.970
fly direct to fucking Atlantic city.
Um,

59
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.380
cause I'm doing a Gig at the Borgata tomorrow night.

60
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

61
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.700
<v 1>All right.
I'm taking off my acting hat and I'm putting on my standup shirt.</v>

62
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.360
Um,
anyway,
speaking of shirts,

63
00:03:35.361 --> 00:03:37.850
did anybody see that stupid sweater Gucci made?

64
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.190
I'm getting all my news from Twitter by the way.

65
00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:43.010
I've just given into the fact that I'm not going to be an informed person.

66
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.800
All right.
You're listening to the wrong bill.
Okay?

67
00:03:45.801 --> 00:03:47.450
You want to listen to Bill Maher if you want to,

68
00:03:47.451 --> 00:03:50.480
if you want to listen to somebody who knows what the fuck is going on,
okay?

69
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.860
You want to listen to that bill?
All right?

70
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.110
You want to listen to some shithead who reads hashtags and whatnot.

71
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.170
You're listening to the right podcast.
All right.
Gucci sweater,

72
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.080
one of these fucking idiots,
right?
Goes out and he designs his fuck.
He or she.

73
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.033
All right.

74
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

75
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.190
<v 1>It was either some dumb guy or a strong brave woman.
Is that my,</v>

76
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.880
is that how he's supposed to say it politically?
Um,

77
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.500
designed a turtle neck that was black that you feel whatever stupid fucking

78
00:04:18.501 --> 00:04:23.330
reason you pulled up like right up underneath your nose and then your,

79
00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:26.660
your mouth came through it.
And then there was these big red lips around it.

80
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.850
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.150
<v 1>So if you've seen the picture,
just Google a picture of it.
All right.</v>

82
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.320
African American people,
you know,
not all of them.
I don't even know how many,

83
00:04:36.321 --> 00:04:39.110
I don't,
I didn't take a fucking sense.
It start going,
Jesus Christ.

84
00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:41.070
Can we start with the fucking black face?

85
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

86
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.190
<v 1>This is offensive.
You know,
they said the sweater look like,</v>

87
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:46.350
<v 0>yeah,</v>

88
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.350
<v 1>it was black face and they immediately made it about themselves rather than the</v>

89
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.224
real issue.

90
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.510
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

91
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.280
<v 1>Which was that it was an unbelievably ridiculous and ugly fucking turtleneck</v>

92
00:04:58.281 --> 00:04:59.114
sweater.

93
00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

94
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.760
<v 1>That's all it was.
It was an ugly turn neck sweater or you know,
and I don't,</v>

95
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:06.550
I don't want to get involved in a racial debate here,

96
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.830
but as a privileged white male,

97
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:13.240
I want you to know that I was triggered by the fact that all those black people

98
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:18.241
ignored the fact that there was also half a white face behind that turtleneck.

99
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.690
Okay.
And how do you think I felt to not feel represented?

100
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.020
And that sweater scandal?

101
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.030
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

102
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.740
<v 1>Um,
is it a fucking amazing,</v>

103
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:33.430
that shit that just get light somehow gets traction on social media?

104
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.660
You know,
what about the fucking eight year old,
you know,

105
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:40.000
who usually goes to bed at three in the morning after?

106
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:43.420
So when those fucking things together in some sweatshop now he had to stick

107
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:45.160
around for an extra half hour to,

108
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:48.610
so the extra fucking thread to make sure it went up and over your mouth.
Right.

109
00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:52.150
And then what happens to everybody in the first world country makes it all about

110
00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:55.360
themselves and everybody forgets about that little fucking kid there.
Right?

111
00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.990
Little fucking Joe

112
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.040
<v 0>six pack.
Right?
Um,</v>

113
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.160
I dunno,
my wife is really into fashion.
I so much of it is just ugly Shit,

114
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.340
you know?
And then they just have some beautiful woman walked down the,
the,
the,

115
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.880
the runway,
like looking confident,
you know.

116
00:06:18.881 --> 00:06:22.210
But that one,
I swear to God,
that was like something out of the muppets,

117
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.190
wasn't it?
I was like the dumb Donald fucking no dump.

118
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:31.210
Donald had a hat pulled down over his fucking,

119
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.770
I used to know all the fucking Cosby kids who was weird.
Harold,

120
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.910
one of them had a sweater yanked up over its face.
Right over it's wall.

121
00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:41.500
It's a cartoon.
Right?
Hold on a second.

122
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.600
Fat Albert kids.
All right.
Who are they?

123
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.350
Let's see.
What did you have?
What did you have images?

124
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.830
Okay.

125
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.750
<v 1>Um,
there was one,
was it weird Harold?
No,</v>

126
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.760
didn't one of them.
No,
I guess they didn't.
There was Russell,

127
00:07:02.761 --> 00:07:07.590
Rudy blocky bill.
Dumb Donald.

128
00:07:07.591 --> 00:07:11.070
Weird Harold.
When was the last one?

129
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.440
Mush mouth.

130
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.910
One of those fucking cartoons at somebody with a thing yanked up over its face.

131
00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:22.890
I had,
I don't fucking remember.
Um,
anyway,

132
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.820
so that was a big scandal.
Everybody.
That was a big fucking scandal,

133
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.960
you know?

134
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.960
But thank God people spoke out and those sweaters will not be mass produced.

135
00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:40.120
So whatever ones that they have will now be thrown into the ocean and we'll let

136
00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:42.520
the porpoises and dolphins deal with it.
You know?

137
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.640
I mean it could have kept a lot of half the lower half of a lot of people's

138
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:51.190
faces warp,
you know,
they easily could have died.
It,

139
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.260
you know,
made it a different color.
I then,
and then what?

140
00:07:57.261 --> 00:08:01.910
Then you get Asians and
native Americans start fucking complaining.

141
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:05.060
It's just a bad idea though.
I think that's what we learned this week.
You know,

142
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.350
you can't get mad at somebody for trying.
I mean it was a turtle neck sweater.

143
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:12.800
What the fuck can you do with it?
Can you lower it a little bit?

144
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.360
It's already been done.
Mock turtleneck sweater.
What do we do?
Well,
let's fucking,

145
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:21.440
let's keep it going.
What do you think?
What do you think?
Underneath the mouth?
No,

146
00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:25.820
right up and over it.
That looks weird.
I'll put some fucking lips on it.

147
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.390
You know,
if you sit sitting there going like bill,

148
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.310
who the fuck talks about half a turtle neck fucking black face sweater for fuck

149
00:08:36.311 --> 00:08:39.380
at eight minutes.
Well you know what,
it's not football season anymore.

150
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.370
Football season is over.
Um,

151
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.020
then your New England patriots.

152
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.380
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

153
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.350
<v 1>New England patriots are the fucking champion.</v>

154
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.980
Your Boston Red Sox or the world series champion and it's fucking unbelievable.

155
00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.980
You know Bruins,
a play in our right.

156
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:01.740
I don't know what's going on with the Celtics.
Somebody asked me today on set,

157
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.340
they go,
hey,
is Kyrie Irving going to go to the Lakers?
This kind of a room.

158
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:08.730
I heard a rumor.
I have no idea.

159
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.690
All I know is I don't think that they've been playing as well as everybody

160
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:14.880
thought they were going to play.
So I have no idea.

161
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.670
But I'm going to try to check in on that.
All I have to do now,

162
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:21.180
now that I'm on the other side of that acting Gig,
all right.

163
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:22.630
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

164
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.160
<v 1>All I gotta do now,
you know,</v>

165
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.940
I keep doing the F is for family stuff and at night I'm just going to be running

166
00:09:27.941 --> 00:09:30.820
my hour because I am taping my hour special.

167
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:34.090
I kind of kept it under wraps as to where I was taping it,

168
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:39.090
where I was recording it and I feel like now's the time,
you know,
cause it,

169
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:40.990
it's a very weird time in comedy.

170
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.800
You hear that a lot now is not the time for those jokes.

171
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.650
I'm a white woman who's not even funny and I'm telling you that now is not the

172
00:09:50.651 --> 00:09:52.000
time for that.

173
00:09:52.001 --> 00:09:55.870
Have you noticed that most people who were saying what you should and shouldn't

174
00:09:55.871 --> 00:09:59.860
be saying comedically are about as funny as your average feature act?

175
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.760
They're like Middle Act,
funny telling like fucking really funny people.

176
00:10:03.761 --> 00:10:07.420
What they should be saying.
Um,
Oh yes.
Yes.

177
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.880
You by all means who with your best joke.

178
00:10:09.881 --> 00:10:14.470
You just make me raise my eyebrows a little bit like hmm.
Yeah,
that was a funny,

179
00:10:14.471 --> 00:10:18.730
wasn't it?
By all means.
Tell the world what is funny.
Um,

180
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:23.790
I am going to be recording my next hour special and um,

181
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:29.140
Royal Albert Hall in London.
That's right.
I'm a trader.

182
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:34.230
I'm going back to the motherland,
eh?
Well,
yeah.

183
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.120
What the fuck?
I mean,
I'm on my sixth one.
I've got to try something different.

184
00:10:37.121 --> 00:10:41.680
I'm going to go over there,
be funny.
Half of my shit.
People will be like,

185
00:10:41.681 --> 00:10:44.110
I don't understand that.
And maybe I'll bomb for part of it.

186
00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:45.310
We'll see if it's funny.
Anyways,

187
00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:49.600
I'll be doing it at Royal Albert Hall on a Monday and Tuesday.
March.

188
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.380
Uh,
what the fuck is that?
Third and fourth.
Fourth and fifth.

189
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.640
Fifth and sixth.

190
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:55.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

191
00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.610
<v 1>So I'm going to be doing a run at dates out here.
Um,</v>

192
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.220

Ghada the fuck month is this.
Oh,

193
00:11:07.221 --> 00:11:10.790
that's October.
Why is this an October?

194
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.150
There's the last time I actually put anything in my calendar.

195
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:17.190
October 29th I put Jimmy Kimmel.

196
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:18.790
<v 0>Okay.</v>

197
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.290
<v 1>How the fuck do I get out of this?
Click on this today.</v>

198
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.430
Click on today.
All right,
here we go.
I'm sorry.
March.
Yeah,
March 4th and fifth.

199
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.860
All right.
So next week on the 15th,

200
00:11:32.861 --> 00:11:36.460
16th and 17th,
I'll be in Santa Barbara,

201
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:41.890
I'll be in Pasadena and I'll be,
uh,
in,
uh,
Riverside,

202
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.750
California.
And then I go to New York City on the 19th.

203
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.400
And I do the Patrice O'Neal benefit.
And then,

204
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.830
um,
I'm in York for a little bit,

205
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:58.831
doing some spots out there and then I embark on a little run of dates through

206
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.940
unit,
a great United Kingdom,
Great Britain,
whatever the fuck you call it.

207
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.630
And then I end up at,

208
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:06.603
<v 2>MMM,</v>

209
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.580
<v 1>I ended up a Royal Albert Hall and they have it.</v>

210
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.100
And then when I get on the other side of that Shit when I Sang,
thank you.

211
00:12:13.101 --> 00:12:15.680
Good night on March 5th.

212
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.640
Then all I have to do is worry about wrapping up the writing on season four of f

213
00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:24.950
is for family and I don't have shit until the summertime and I'm just going to

214
00:12:24.951 --> 00:12:28.340
be fucking hanging in Cali doing,
you know,

215
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.280
getting ready to do my new hour work of mine.
That's,
that's the game plan.

216
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.900
All right.
Because,
uh,
I love my daughter and I,

217
00:12:35.901 --> 00:12:40.580
I don't like leaving the way I used to,
you know,
do you know,
she,

218
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.740
she tried to get out of her bed.

219
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.750
I saw two months ago she was swinging her leg up and over the,
the,

220
00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:52.100
the crib and my gut said you better put some pillows down around the floor in

221
00:12:52.101 --> 00:12:53.780
case she goes up and over.
And I just,
you know,

222
00:12:53.781 --> 00:12:57.390
I didn't listen to my gut like a fucking idiot.
So it was coming home from the,

223
00:12:57.391 --> 00:13:00.500
at that amazing shoot that I was on that I can't wait to fucking tell you guys

224
00:13:00.501 --> 00:13:04.070
about,
but I'm just not allowed to,
was so awesome.

225
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.330
<v 2>Um,
but uh,</v>

226
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.080
<v 1>I came home last night and you know,
after I got off set,</v>

227
00:13:12.081 --> 00:13:15.800
I never bring my phone down to the set or a watch,
you know,

228
00:13:15.801 --> 00:13:18.440
cause I don't want to know what time it is because then it just makes it drag.

229
00:13:18.441 --> 00:13:22.610
So I just focus on whatever the fuck it is I need to do and then I come walking

230
00:13:22.611 --> 00:13:25.640
out at like one in the morning,
however it works.
Anyway,
some fucking coming back.

231
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.830
You know,
I come outside and I get the,
uh,
oh,
the pizza's here,

232
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.570
I get this text message.

233
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.463
<v 3>Okay.</v>

234
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.670
<v 2>And,
uh,</v>

235
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.430
<v 1>it says we're at the emergency room,
blah,
blah,
blah,
all this fucking shit.</v>

236
00:13:43.431 --> 00:13:44.390
She fell out of the bed.

237
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.150
<v 3>Okay.</v>

238
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.200
<v 1>And I'm like,
Oh my God,</v>

239
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:50.590
I'm wiped out and I have to go to the emergency room and my fucking tires has a

240
00:13:50.591 --> 00:13:54.400
slow leak on the left side.
So I'm like,
great.

241
00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:59.350
It never rent.
So I'm on my way there.
And it's so funny,

242
00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:01.780
like how my wife is wired and how I'm wired.

243
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.980
Like my wife is wired like a normal caring human being.

244
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

245
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.690
<v 1>And I'm like a fucking lunatic.</v>

246
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.690
I was raised the way I was raised just in a different time.

247
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.023
<v 2>So</v>

248
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.170
<v 1>I call her up,
she goes,
I go,
is she talking?
Is she find,
yeah,
she's fine.</v>

249
00:14:19.171 --> 00:14:20.850
She's joking around,
she's laughing.

250
00:14:20.851 --> 00:14:23.550
She actually didn't even cry until I came in the room and cried.

251
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.473
<v 2>MMM.</v>

252
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.300
<v 1>And she sent me a picture,
you know,
and I'm driving and I'm looking at it,</v>

253
00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:32.780
you know,
like I shouldn't be.
And I was just like,
yeah,
she's fine.

254
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.290
<v 3>Okay,</v>

255
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.500
<v 1>she's fine.
She's got a bump on her head.
She's,
she's going to be fine and blah,</v>

256
00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:41.070
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And we both had the exact opposite.
She's like,

257
00:14:41.071 --> 00:14:44.400
I'm not bringing her home until a doctor looks at her.
I'll never forgive myself.

258
00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:47.400
And I'm like,
she's fine.
She's fine.

259
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.740
So we walk up to the window to see where we are.

260
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.550
It's like fucking one in the morning or midnight I think.

261
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.630
And there's all these fucking people there with their kids and they're all

262
00:14:56.631 --> 00:14:57.700
screaming and crying.

263
00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.033
<v 0>Okay.</v>

264
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.100
<v 1>They say we're 16th in line.</v>

265
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:03.770
It's just like they're not going to get to us to like fucking three in the

266
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:07.930
morning,
you know,
she's fine.
I literally,

267
00:15:07.931 --> 00:15:11.110
I remember being a kid swinging on these ropes.

268
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.190
My other brother was on another rope and we went right by each other and then

269
00:15:15.191 --> 00:15:19.750
slammed into the backs of our heads,
like slammed into each other.

270
00:15:19.751 --> 00:15:23.970
Like I saw stars.
It all went white and I landed face down on the ground.

271
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.103
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

272
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:29.750
<v 1>All right.
I was out,
like I was conscious when I was on the rope and when we hit,</v>

273
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.910
I was unconscious than I hit the ground.

274
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.930
And you know what my dumb ass did an hour and a half later got right back on

275
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:37.940
that fucking thing.
And my other brother did too.

276
00:15:37.941 --> 00:15:40.400
And I remember the looks on our faces when we passed each other going,

277
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.730
are we really going to do this again?
And Bam,
back of our heads again,

278
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.810
saw lights knocked out,
hit the ground,
you know.

279
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.270
<v 0>Okay.</v>

280
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.030
<v 1>And I was fine,
so fuck it.</v>

281
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.920
So I convinced her that she was all right and she was all right.

282
00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:01.000
But like I've kind of realized in that like I need to like kind of gauge that.

283
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:02.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

284
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.570
<v 1>Because you know,</v>

285
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.900
I came from a house where like I had a ruptured appendix at one point and my

286
00:16:06.901 --> 00:16:08.820
parents were like,
you're fine,
you're fine.

287
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.630
It finally one of the hospital,
they slice me open and I don't like,

288
00:16:15.631 --> 00:16:19.620
my whole belly was just fucking pus.
You're like,

289
00:16:19.621 --> 00:16:22.230
Jesus Christ.
Um,

290
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.700
<v 0>yeah.</v>

291
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.430
<v 1>So whatever you can take that,
rub some dirt on it too far.</v>

292
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.400
And then he can go the other way where every time somebody has to fucking

293
00:16:29.401 --> 00:16:32.670
sniffles you take beyond to the God damn hospital.
You know what I mean?

294
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.560
But I think my wife was right to take her down there,
but she was okay.
And uh,

295
00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:41.400
she woke up today and then not on her head was a lot smaller and uh,
you know,

296
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:45.540
every kid has to have their black I picture,
you know what I mean?

297
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.050
Um,
something that you did.
So,
uh,

298
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.110
it was cool and I was so proud of her that she didn't cry and she was,

299
00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:56.400
she's a little toughie,
you know,
she's a little bad ass.
So anyways,

300
00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:57.661
you know,

301
00:16:57.661 --> 00:17:00.990
she's talking up a storm and I got my little book and I try to keep up on all

302
00:17:00.991 --> 00:17:05.390
the things that she says,
you know,
um,
you know,
it's funny now is uh,

303
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:10.940
they have a park nearby and like once a year they just,

304
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:15.390
little carnival thing comes by and they have like little pony rides and stuff.

305
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:17.820
So I took her over there and you know,

306
00:17:17.821 --> 00:17:21.240
it was going on like all the little kiddie rides with her.
It was awesome.
And um,

307
00:17:21.241 --> 00:17:23.730
and then she saw the horses,
she's like horse horse,
you know,

308
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.880
she knows how to make the noise and shit.
And um,

309
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.450
<v 0>okay,</v>

310
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.540
<v 1>they had the little pony rides or do you want to ride the horse?
She goes,
yeah,</v>

311
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.280
right up,
right horse ride horse.
She was all about it.
Right.

312
00:17:33.281 --> 00:17:37.390
And then paid the ticket.
I'm going in.
I was like,
wow,
man,
she's so brave.

313
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.970
You know,
she's so brave.
Right.
And uh,

314
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.760
and she was all about it and right as I went to put her down on it because it

315
00:17:44.761 --> 00:17:47.920
can put you down and then they'd like puts this little safety harness and then

316
00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:49.590
you was the parent walk along with it.
Right.

317
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.370
I want to set her down in the second I started setting down.
She's going,
no,
no,

318
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.630
no horse,
no horse.

319
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:03.710
So I immediately got her out of there cause I didn't want to have her to have

320
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.740
issues with horses.
Speaking of horses,

321
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.530
one of the actors that I worked with that,
um,
you know,

322
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:14.670
all of this shit I'm not allowed to say knows a thing or two about horses.

323
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.080
And I somehow asked him,

324
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:20.850
what is that a road rode hard and put up wet.

325
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.100
What does that expression mean?
Or uh,
you know,

326
00:18:25.101 --> 00:18:27.170
there's a couple of different ways to say it,
but that's basically,

327
00:18:27.171 --> 00:18:28.700
it rode hard and put up wet.
He goes,

328
00:18:28.701 --> 00:18:32.120
that's actually talking about horses and it's kind of a human cell.

329
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:36.620
Somebody like Jesus Christ,
that guy looks rode hard and put up wet.
Um,

330
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.450
and it basically was,

331
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.990
I guess if you ride a horse hard enough that it's,

332
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.330
it's breathing hard and it's sweating.

333
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.630
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

334
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.780
<v 1>And you just were to then just walk it into a barn.</v>

335
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.240
<v 3>Okay.</v>

336
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.490
<v 1>I guess they get like these stomach cramps or something.</v>

337
00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:58.110
They call it colic or something and they literally laid down in the ground and

338
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.450
they flip around or I don't know what happens.

339
00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:02.850
Something gets twisted up and they just fucking die.

340
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.200
So what you have to do is after he wrote them hard is you have to walk a horse

341
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:11.100
around until it's slows,
slowly,
cools back down again.

342
00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:15.420
So it doesn't get those cramps.
And if you put it into early and it lays down,

343
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.450
you got to fucking get that thing back up or it's going to die or whatever,

344
00:19:18.451 --> 00:19:20.730
you know,
fucking horse,
just man,
they're really temperamental.

345
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.700
So I had no idea about that shit.
So,
you know,

346
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:28.110
these are the things that you learn about while you're sitting there.
You know,

347
00:19:28.111 --> 00:19:32.850
I learned all of this Shit I learned about,
you know,
there was an old school guy,

348
00:19:32.851 --> 00:19:36.300
they're telling me about different actors and how much of the,

349
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:41.280
how much land they owed out owned out here.
You know,

350
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.690
like this,
this actor went out and he bought from this street to this street.

351
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.890
<v 3>Okay.</v>

352
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:47.590
<v 1>Which would,
yeah,</v>

353
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:51.000
I mean if somebody wants to buy that same parcel land today out here in La,

354
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:53.340
like I don't even have to be $1 billion or something.

355
00:19:53.341 --> 00:19:55.560
And that person bought it for like five grand.

356
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.110
And then for the rest of their acting career,

357
00:19:58.111 --> 00:20:02.230
they just sort of slowly sold it off and made all this money.
It's,

358
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.130
it's fucking like,
La is one of the most amazing

359
00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:11.290
historic cities.
If you can somehow find out what the fuck happened.

360
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.340
Cause God knows it's not in any books because they don't give a shit out here.

361
00:20:15.341 --> 00:20:18.250
They just fucking pave shit over.
Um,

362
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.880
it's one of the shady ass God damn place.
Awesome.
I fucking love it.

363
00:20:21.881 --> 00:20:24.550
But it is so fucking shady with,
you know,

364
00:20:24.551 --> 00:20:27.550
we used to have street cars and trolleys and all of this fucking shit.

365
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.390
And then one day,
you know,
the,
allegedly this group of people got together,

366
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.500
you know,
that was allegedly the automakers and,
and,

367
00:20:34.501 --> 00:20:39.501
and the Goodyear tire people got together and they bought up the trains and the

368
00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:42.760
trolleys and they just ripped up all the fucking tracks and turned it into this

369
00:20:42.761 --> 00:20:44.500
fucking mess that it is now.

370
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.310
Now I got a Elon must dig in the fucking,
you know,
we,

371
00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.320
these already dug this tunnel underneath la and the people that live in Beverly

372
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.190
hills are so fucking rich.
They stopped elong Musk

373
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.400
who's powerful enough to just start drilling underneath the fucking city.

374
00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.493
And

375
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.470
<v 3>yeah,</v>

376
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:11.100
<v 1>they're powerful enough to be at.
We do not want those commoners.</v>

377
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.670
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

379
00:21:17.081 --> 00:21:22.081

380

Oh No,

381

382
00:21:34.411 --> 00:21:36.690
to kick,
to get away from these fucking people,

383
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:41.760
to have them then just get on some magic carpet ride underneath the fucking

384
00:21:41.761 --> 00:21:42.960
surface of the earth.

385

459
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:22.100

Okay,
cool.
Um,
you know,

460
00:26:22.101 --> 00:26:23.900
I was thinking the other,
by the way,

461
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:28.160
I didn't gloat about the Patriots winning the Superbowl because I still can't

462
00:26:28.161 --> 00:26:31.850
believe they fucking did it,
but it does make me feel good.
You know,

463
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.880
after all the shit giant fans gave me that the new England patriots now have

464
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
more fucking Tom Brady has more fucking rings then the giants and jets combined

465
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.690
and the buffalo bills.

466
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:50.870
There are three NFL teams in the state of New York and Tom Brady alone has one

467
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:56.880
more super bowls than those three teams in their entire fucking existence.

468
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.740
So I'll take those two losses.
Oh,
Boohoo we only went six and three.

469
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.550
Sorry,
just given,
um,
fellow patriots fans some fucking Ammo.

470
00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:10.810

all these fucking women do is bitch.

496
00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.710
they cost?
20.
[inaudible].
Um,
all right,

497
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:52.980
let's look up steak in a blow job day.
I always heard that that fucking exists.

498
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:57.420
Is that an actual day steak and a blow job?

499
00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.500
God knows a progressive mayor will take a veggie sandwich at a fucking hand job.

500
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:06.890
Um,
let's see here.
Steak and a blow job.
Alright.

501
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:08.070
Steak in a blow job day.

502
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.000
Sticking a blow job day is a satirical holiday creating the United States.
Okay.

503
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.710
Yeah.
It's a male response to Valentine's Day and celebrate it.

504
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:19.410
A month later on March 14th on the day,

505
00:29:19.411 --> 00:29:24.411
women are proport purported to supposedly to cook a fillet steak.

506
00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.740
Okay.
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.

507
00:29:27.741 --> 00:29:31.580
Good luck getting any woman under the age of fucking 50 to do that.

508
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.310
The women on a cook anymore.
I mean,

509
00:29:34.311 --> 00:29:39.311
I think they do it for themselves and perform fellatio on a man in response to

510
00:29:39.321 --> 00:29:43.210
postcards,
chocolate and flowers by men on Valentine's Day.

511
00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:45.700
The observance has no official status of course,

512
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.810
being a popular Internet meme rather than an actual holiday.

513
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:54.430
But various souvenirs and video clips have been produced about it.

514
00:29:54.431 --> 00:29:59.431
It was conceived in 2002 by Dj Tom Birdsy on Wfm next radio that's in Boston.

515
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:06.340
It's been suggested that steak and a blow job day is a backlash against the

516
00:30:06.341 --> 00:30:09.100
feminist movement.
Uh,

517
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:12.090
it has nothing to do with the feminist movement has to do with the firm.

518
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.230
Why the fuck are we sell?

519
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:17.320
Why do I only have to buy shit to celebrate that we're together.

520
00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:19.753
<v 4>Okay.</v>

521
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:23.410
<v 1>Anyways.
Oh,
oh.
Who's coming in?
My little toughie.</v>

522
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:25.870
Hey.

523
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.473
<v 4>Hey Nia.</v>

524
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.090
<v 1>Just to let you in.
Do you know when the official stake in a Bj Day is?</v>

525
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:37.120
When is that?
Uh,
March 14th.
All right.

526
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:41.560
How well did it in my calendar?
Beautiful.
Just like that.

527
00:30:41.561 --> 00:30:45.610
See that I didn't have to make say anything about feminism.
Did I?
Hi.

528
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.960
Gorgeous.
Oh,
look at you.
You look like it's week two of the playoffs.

529
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.300
Sherry's berries near.

530
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.350
Talk about your plans for Valentine's Day this year.

531
00:30:56.351 --> 00:30:59.830
What would you do if you weren't procrastinating?

532
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.700
I'm not procrastinating.
I already have a reservation that my wife made.

533
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.690
We're going to go out and we're going to have some neat share.

534
00:31:07.691 --> 00:31:11.050
A Personal Valentine's Day story.
All right?
I always tell this story.

535
00:31:11.051 --> 00:31:14.890
One time I was dating this woman and uh,
I didn't know what to get her.

536
00:31:14.891 --> 00:31:18.790
It was like my first girlfriend and I went to the mall and they had these polo

537
00:31:18.791 --> 00:31:22.690
shirts that were on sale,
so I bought three of them for like golf shirts.

538
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:25.990
That's what I bought a female and she opened them up.

539
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:29.010
She was all excited and she opened them up and she just went like,
what?

540
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.590
What is this?
Who would buy these?
And she got so mad at me,

541
00:31:32.591 --> 00:31:37.030
she started yelling at me and I was so embarrassed that I literally sat down in

542
00:31:37.031 --> 00:31:41.290
the bed like a scolded child and let her yell at me for like three minutes

543
00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:46.120
before I finally got enough self esteem to tell her to go a,
to go to hell.

544
00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:49.420
And then she tried to back pedal that she actually appreciated the fact that I

545
00:31:49.421 --> 00:31:51.640
went in and I got her gift.
Like it's just like,
sweetheart,

546
00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.490
you're not buying me anything.
I know this gift stinks,

547
00:31:54.491 --> 00:31:58.450
but it's the thought that counts.
Right?
Isn't that what it is?
No,

548
00:31:58.451 --> 00:32:01.510
it's the thought.
The shyness and how much you spent,

549
00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:04.760
<v 4>was it at least three different colors?
Yeah.</v>

550
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.340
Three different color polo shirts.

551
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:12.180
<v 1>They were ugly.
She was right.
She was right.
Uh,</v>

552
00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:16.890
what do you do to look good on Valentine's Day?
Well,
I get a spray Tan for one.

553
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:21.360
I put on some me undies,
the Greg Logan from the Greg Louganis line.

554
00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:26.100
Um,
I get a spray on like stubble on top of my head,

555
00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.060
put on a cumber bun and then I'm out the door.
Never,

556
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:35.100
never go wrong with signature dip Valentine's strawberries dipped in milk,

557
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:39.380
dark or white chocolate.
Goodness for any discernible palate.
Uh,

558
00:32:39.381 --> 00:32:43.790
that's very progressive.
Near notice the white chocolate was last.
Okay.

559
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.090
Although milk,
light skin,
there's still,
you know,
still a little prejudice.

560
00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.710
It's light skinned to did it.

561
00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:54.210
<v 4>No,
it's not.
What do you mean it's not light skin?</v>

562
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:58.570
The color of it that's hockey would be considered light skin.

563
00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.750
You're going to try to raise as come here.

564
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.530
<v 1>Let me,
can I ask you a question yet?
Were you offended by that Gucci?</v>

565
00:33:04.531 --> 00:33:07.140
A half a blackface sweater.

566
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:10.260
<v 5>Aye.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

567
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.300
The whole thing was just very strange to me.

568
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.940
Didn't you think it was a tribute to half moon cookies?

569
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:20.100
I did not think that at all.
No,
I didn't think that you can.

570
00:33:20.101 --> 00:33:24.750
It was black,
half of face,
half half black face,
black half phase.

571
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:28.710
<v 1>But I felt triggered as a white man that they didn't recognize the half a white</v>

572
00:33:28.711 --> 00:33:33.630
face that was there.
Did you?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm sure they will.
Anyways,

573
00:33:33.631 --> 00:33:37.410
dipped in milk,
dark or white chocolate.
Goodness for any discerning palate.

574
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:40.740
She'll fall in love with every bite.
Top with decking it toppings,

575
00:33:40.741 --> 00:33:43.170
chocolate chips,
heart and glitter.
Sparkles.

576
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.810
Perfect companion to a candle lit dinner,

577
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:48.840
a bouquet of flowers or a night out on the town.

578
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:52.560
Arrive with 100% Sherry's.

579

gig.
Thank you.
Everybody gave me the opportunity.

Um,

625

and I can't wait for you guys to see and I can't wait for you to tell you what

627
00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.060
yes.
Hi.

628
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.533
<v 7>I'll talk to you later.</v>

629
00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:14.183
Wow.

630
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:51.530
<v 5>Hey,
what's going on?
It's Belper and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

631
00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.940
February 7th,

632
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.960
2011 seven days into February.
I'm actually doing this Sunday night,

633
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:05.000
which is why all you mother fuckers in Europe actually got this fucking podcast

634
00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:10.160
on Monday morning and everyone across the states got it Monday morning.

635
00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:11.570
All right.

636
00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:16.570
And even if you're on a fucking oil tanker in the middle of the Goddamn Atlantic

637
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:18.523
Ocean,
all right?

638
00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:23.180
If you didn't have to go off and swab the deck or whatever the fuck it is you

639
00:38:23.181 --> 00:38:25.670
people do out there,
you got it on a Monday morning.

640
00:38:25.671 --> 00:38:29.030
So I don't wanna hear any God damn bitch in this week.
Where are you?

641
00:38:29.031 --> 00:38:31.910
Could you made your body pod casts?
It's my podcast.

642
00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.980
You're probably asking yourself,
why do I work in a cubicle?

643
00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:41.200
But beyond that,
you probably ask yourself,

644
00:38:41.201 --> 00:38:45.280
why did bill actually do one on a Sunday evening?

645
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.480
So it was actually there for his listeners on a Monday.

646
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.460
Maybe if he did that more often,

647
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:55.840
he wouldn't beat ranked number 52 on iTunes.

648
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:57.100
According to one of my listeners,

649
00:38:57.101 --> 00:39:01.960
he let me know that he loved my podcast and he thought that I should be ranked

650
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:06.100
much higher than number 52 well,
thanks a lot.

651
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:09.450
Thanks for letting me know how far down the fucking ranks I am

652
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:15.010
when you're doing rankings.
Who counts beyond the top 20 honestly,

653
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:20.910
coming in at number 73 Mabel Millan field with her,

654
00:39:22.041 --> 00:39:25.990
uh,
how to make a pot roast podcast every week she talks about how to make a

655
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:29.890
podcast.
You'd figured that that would get boring way to go,

656
00:39:29.891 --> 00:39:32.710
whatever made up name,
I said five seconds ago.

657
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:38.340
So I'm doing it because I'm fucking busy today on Monday.

658
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:43.540
Uh,
believe it or not,
I actually,
I booked some acting work.

659
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:48.010
You know,
it's a great thing,
you know,
when you,
uh,
you know,

660
00:39:48.011 --> 00:39:52.240
being in this business,
you can watch shows on TV and be fans of them.

661
00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:57.790
And actually,
Lo and behold,
one day I should be on the fucking show.

662
00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:03.370
And,
uh,
since its inception,
this very few shows that I watch every episode of,

663
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.810
and I just have to tell you from day one,
I have just loved that show glee.

664
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:13.360
I mean,
it is just phenomenal.
You know,
the singing,
the dancing,

665
00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:18.160
the way they stole the Nelly Olson character from little house in the prairie

666
00:40:18.161 --> 00:40:21.820
matters,
some old country with the fucking rape whistle,
right?

667
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:23.710
It's a great God damn show.

668
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:28.990
And evidently they've been listening to my podcast and they can,
you know,

669
00:40:28.991 --> 00:40:31.150
they hear that I can belt out a tune,
you know,

670
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:35.230
I could carry a tune and um,
you know,

671
00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:39.670
I'm going to go on this thing a little bit Tony Bennet and uh,
I can't,
I'm,

672
00:40:39.671 --> 00:40:44.050
you know,
I'm legally obligated to not say what the entire episode is about.

673
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:49.360
So,
uh,
yeah.
So I'm actually,
I'm taping an episode of Glee this week

674
00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:56.020
and if you believe that I um,
I got a fucking,
I got a,

675
00:40:56.021 --> 00:40:59.880
I got a wind screen to sell Ya.
Ya know,

676
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:03.190
I am working this week as an actor.
I'm not fucking telling you on which show.

677
00:41:03.191 --> 00:41:07.420
Okay.
You figure it out.
All right.
There's only 600 channels,
you know,

678
00:41:07.421 --> 00:41:10.210
how far into my life do I have to let you.
But I am working as an actor.

679
00:41:10.211 --> 00:41:15.211
I'm fucking psyched because my pilot for comedy central that I was doing a with

680
00:41:16.061 --> 00:41:19.600
another,
one of the funniest fucking Comedians I know did not get picked up.

681
00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:24.520
That's how my year began.
Began with the little bit of hope for about two weeks.

682
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:29.350
And then the industry grab one of my ankles and then someone else,
he ended,

683
00:41:29.351 --> 00:41:34.130
she grabbed the other ankle and then they drove a fucking TD emblem right into

684
00:41:34.131 --> 00:41:38.600
my ball bag and it said,
hey,
you got bell,
have a great fucking 2011.
You know,

685
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:43.610
and that was down in the dumps for a couple,
two,
three days.
But you know,

686
00:41:43.611 --> 00:41:47.290
just like one of those old,
uh,
one of those old fucking crooners songs,
jazz,

687
00:41:47.291 --> 00:41:49.640
what makes that little hack?

688
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:55.630
They key can stomp dance something in South Day and everyone knows that your

689
00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:00.470
fucked,
but you don't got the balls to kill yourself.

690
00:42:00.471 --> 00:42:04.880
So you keep a dash shinning.
See,
can you believe I'm not,

691
00:42:04.881 --> 00:42:09.410
I'm fucking glee.
Um,
I can't to go fuck yourself.

692
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:14.360
You figure it out when I'm on.
All right.
Um,
so anyways,

693
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.490
so this is the podcast.

694
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:21.150
So I was going to do it this afternoon and,
uh,
I dunno,

695
00:42:21.151 --> 00:42:24.020
a day got away from me and then I was like,
wow,
the super bowls today.

696
00:42:24.021 --> 00:42:27.830
So I gotta make sure I do it after the super bowl because I always talk about

697
00:42:27.831 --> 00:42:32.450
sports.
And,
uh,
if you're someone who's a hates,
when I talk about sports,

698
00:42:32.451 --> 00:42:34.790
you really get to hate this podcast.
All right?

699
00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:36.110
Cause I got to talk about a little bit.

700
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:38.360
There was the fucking super bowl and you know,
you showed up,

701
00:42:38.361 --> 00:42:41.450
you sport hate and can't,
didn't you?

702
00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:45.740
And you sat there and you ate the fucking food,
didn't you?

703
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.570
And you've ran your mouth during the fucking game and then you shut up during

704
00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:54.890
the commercials,
right?
And then you gab with all the chicks afterwards.

705
00:42:54.891 --> 00:42:56.830
I thought that that was the good one.
Can you,

706
00:42:56.831 --> 00:43:00.800
do you believe they pay nine zillion dollars a second?
Right?

707
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.470
So shut your face.

708
00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.890
People will say they hate fucking sports.
Still show up to Superbowl parties.

709
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:12.520
All right?
If you do that,
you're,
you're,
you're a punk.
All right?

710
00:43:12.521 --> 00:43:17.500
When I say I hate sex in the city,
I don't show up for the season finale.

711
00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.380
You know,
I don't go to the movies.
They are,

712
00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:23.440
that's what I should do when they make another one of those horrific movies,

713
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:27.910
right?
Do you know,
I heard most of the budgets of those movies is,
uh,

714
00:43:27.911 --> 00:43:32.290
is actually a dying,
the pubes of the women who play those girls.

715
00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.420
It's true.
People out here in Hollywood,
man,

716
00:43:40.421 --> 00:43:44.740
I have the fucking trade magazines at my fingertips.

717
00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:48.060
I know people who are on television,
they tie,

718
00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.810
you get the inside information here.

719
00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:54.460
I can't believe I'm ranked 52 with some of these gems that I'm giving you this

720
00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.250
week.
It really boggles my mind.
I'm going to say I'm going to,

721
00:43:57.251 --> 00:44:00.610
I'm going to crack the top 50 this week.
I'm going to get to number 49.

722
00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:05.860
What do you think about that people,
um,
I,
what the hell I'm talking about.

723
00:44:05.861 --> 00:44:10.600
This one's just going to be all momentum people.
All fucking momentum.
Uh,
let's,

724
00:44:10.601 --> 00:44:14.560
let's talk about the Superbowl,
shall we?
It's shut off right out of the gate.

725
00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:19.780
My condolences to Pittsburgh.
Steeler fans was a hell of a fucking game.

726
00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:21.910
Little bit boring and points.
But,
uh,

727
00:44:21.911 --> 00:44:26.911
I think some of that was had to do with the both teams had great defenses and

728
00:44:27.341 --> 00:44:32.341
the fact that Ben Roethlisberger was wearing one sneaker and one moon boot or

729
00:44:33.211 --> 00:44:35.280
was that an Ugh,
I don't know what happened.

730
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:36.330
I don't know what happened to that guy,

731
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:41.100
but I didn't realize that he was so fucked up before the God damn game.
But uh,

732
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:45.750
my condolences and congratulations to the Green Bay packers,

733
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:50.780
ladies and Gentlemen Are Fourth Super Bowl Championship.

734
00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:54.163
<v 8>Okay?</v>

735
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:59.160
<v 5>Combining that with nine NFL titles.</v>

736
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.790
All right?
In three league titles,

737
00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:07.820
giving them an overall total of 16 titles are right.

738
00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:13.850
Nobody can fuck with that in professional football in America.

739
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:17.190
All right,
shut up.
You can see over there in Europe.
All right,

740
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:19.770
we call football football over here.

741
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.920
Even though we had the brains to pick the fucking thing up set our Ra's skipping

742
00:45:25.921 --> 00:45:29.200
around fucking unbelievable.

743
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.690
<v 3>Okay.</v>

744
00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:33.470
<v 5>You over there in Europe,
they always give you shit on me.
Like,
well,
you know,</v>

745
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:36.870
while you call it football might yell.
He knew you fucker for shut up.

746
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:40.440
You do use your foot when you kick a field goal.

747
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:44.070
And when you fucking kick off or you when your punt.
All right.

748
00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:50.610
Jesus fucking Christ.
It's was called foot and hand balls.
How,

749
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:52.970
what the fuck was [inaudible]?
How come you don't call it foot in head ball?

750
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.700
How come you don't call it that?
You use your fucking head over there too,

751
00:45:55.701 --> 00:45:59.330
don't ya?
All right.
This smarty pants.
Um,

752
00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:04.340
anyways,
sorry.
16 fucking titles.

753
00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:10.310
All right.
That is their 16th title.
Saw You people there,

754
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:14.840
uh,
around the fucking league who keep looking.
I don't know.
And nobody,

755
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:19.930
I asked this question why they don't count NFL fucking titles and nobody gave me

756
00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.100
a decent explanation.

757
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:27.380
They raise good people fucking shut back.
Then I got shit like that.

758
00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:32.110
I got shit like urge because [inaudible] merger,

759
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:34.370
dumb shit like that.
Right?

760
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.880
That just made a lot of sports guys perk their fucking ears.
So yeah,

761
00:46:37.881 --> 00:46:42.040
that is right that he's white.
He's because the merger is it,
is that why?
It is,

762
00:46:42.041 --> 00:46:45.970
it's a fucking stupid reason because nobody else did that when they had a
merger.

763
00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:48.363
<v 8>You know,</v>

764
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:54.440
<v 5>the NHL had six teams for fucking ever in 1967 they added the expansion.</v>

765
00:46:55.051 --> 00:46:58.440
Six,
they doubled the size of their fucking league.

766
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.410
No other league has done that in one year ever.
Okay.

767
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.860
They didn't tell Montreal and Toronto to go fuck themselves with all their cups.

768
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.270
Montreal used to win him back.

769
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:10.830
You know when they used to play in a pond and the Stanley Cup was the size of

770
00:47:10.831 --> 00:47:13.440
like a fucking shot glass.
They count those.

771
00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:20.730
The fucking Chicago cubs have been waiting since 1907 I don't fucking understand

772
00:47:21.101 --> 00:47:24.580
it.
It's bullshit.
It's bullshit.
Okay.

773
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:28.120
And later on in this podcast,
I'm,
you know what?
Fuck it.

774
00:47:28.121 --> 00:47:32.200
I'm gonna read it right now.
All right.
This is basically how it went down.

775
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:36.790
All right.
And I know why you all you fucking sports nerds out there by the way.

776
00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:43.000
I want you guys to debunk my,
my,
my way of thinking here.
Okay.

777
00:47:43.001 --> 00:47:45.990
Cause you look at the Los Angeles Lakers to,

778
00:47:45.991 --> 00:47:50.830
or their NBA championships are not even,
they weren't even one in the NBA.

779
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:52.160
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

780
00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.350
<v 5>They were one in a league called the BBA,</v>

781
00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:59.930
which then merged with some other that then became the NBA.
I mean,

782
00:47:59.931 --> 00:48:02.860
you want to talk about padding your fucking stats.
You got every,

783
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:07.400
the Lakers can get away with that shit and act like they're one title away

784
00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.470
from the fucking Celtics.

785
00:48:10.471 --> 00:48:15.030
If they can get away with that horse shit with that Hanky that they put up with

786
00:48:15.031 --> 00:48:17.610
five fucking titles on it.
Right.
It's funny.

787
00:48:17.611 --> 00:48:21.480
Every other championship banner they have hanging on their wall,
it just says,

788
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.770
you know,
NBA champion,
1980 NBA champion,

789
00:48:25.771 --> 00:48:29.330
1985 right.
They just have,
it's,

790
00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:33.510
it's its own flag.
Then they got this one little fucking Hanky.

791
00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:34.630
Okay.

792
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:38.640
Which should be a big slice of fucking toilet paper that they got five fucking

793
00:48:38.641 --> 00:48:39.720
championships on.

794
00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.060
I think shimp played on one of those God damn teens.
It's fucking ridiculous,

795
00:48:45.061 --> 00:48:46.980
but if they can get away with that,
I'm telling you,

796
00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.260
I'm counting from here on out.
I'm counting NFL titles.

797
00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:55.290
All right.
I'm going to start a movement.
Okay.

798
00:48:55.291 --> 00:48:57.480
If I can't close down the fucking Federal Reserve,

799
00:48:57.481 --> 00:49:01.080
at least I can make this thing right in this goddamn country.
Okay.
Here,

800
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:03.300
here's how it goes.
All right?

801
00:49:03.301 --> 00:49:07.740
Just if you want to know Green Bay's on top.
All right?

802
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:12.060
This is how it worked.
Okay?
1920s when the NFL starting,
all right,

803
00:49:12.061 --> 00:49:14.160
from 1920 to 1932,

804
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:19.370
they had the league championship and it was determined by team wins and loss

805
00:49:19.681 --> 00:49:21.840
percentages with ties admitted.

806
00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:25.770
And then in 1932 because of a tie in the final standings,

807
00:49:25.771 --> 00:49:28.950
a playoff game was played to determine the championship.

808
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:34.190
And from 1933 on that was called the NFL championship game,

809
00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:38.010
all right?
That's how it fucking worked.

810
00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.450
<v 3>Okay?</v>

811
00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:43.500
<v 5>Okay.
And all these teams,
including the fucking Steelers played,
played back then.</v>

812
00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:47.340
So they had an opportunity to win titles,
which they did not.
So here we go.

813
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:51.930
Here's how it goes down.
The most successful team.
So back then,
all right.
Uh,

814
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.160
the Green Bay packers,

815
00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:58.880
they won nine NFL championships in three league titles for a total of fucking

816
00:49:59.251 --> 00:50:04.170
was at 93,
the one 12th.
Um,
fuck it.
I didn't put these in in,

817
00:50:04.171 --> 00:50:07.270
in,
uh,
any sort of chronological order here.
So I just got to read them.
The cults,

818
00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:11.210
one for NFL Championships.
All right.
And,

819
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:14.310
and then another two Superbowls.
So they got six total.

820
00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:17.850
The giants won New York giants,
New York football giants,

821
00:50:17.851 --> 00:50:22.350
one for NFL titles plus three Superbowls.
So they got seven,

822
00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.370
they get seven fucking championships.
You know,

823
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:29.270
this sitting there walking around like they only got three,

824
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:33.800
like to hang in there with my patriots then that they got twice as many as us

825
00:50:33.801 --> 00:50:38.801
plus one Chicago bears won nine NFL fucking championships plus one Superbowl for

826
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:44.750
grand total of a,
of 10.
Uh,
the cardinals,

827
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.660
I've lost,
this is why I'm ranked number 52.

828
00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:49.880
I've lost so many listeners at this point,
but I don't give a fuck.

829
00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.840
Chicago cardinals,
which then became the Saint Louis Cardinals,

830
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:55.940
which then became the Arizona cardinals.

831
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:59.300
They won one league in one NFL title.

832
00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:02.060
And if you want to go to an Arizona cardinals game,

833
00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:07.330
and if you want to fucking chance a year at those fucking retired George

834
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:12.800
Mcgovern,
Republican cunts,
uh,
1947 that's the year you want to chant it.
Damn.

835
00:51:12.801 --> 00:51:17.030
1947 right?
The lines one for NFL championships,

836
00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.030
I forget when their last one I have the wrong year.

837
00:51:20.031 --> 00:51:24.080
Written down was 1950 [inaudible] Cleveland Rams,

838
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:29.570
which then became the La rams in 1946 and then became the Saint Louis Rams in 19

839
00:51:29.571 --> 00:51:31.790
fucking 95 I know,
I sound like the rain man.

840
00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:36.650
They have one three NFL championships plus one super bowl for grand total of

841
00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:37.484
four.

842
00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:43.010
Here's my favorite one in the Cleveland browns they want for NFL titles.

843
00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:44.843
All right.

844
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:50.230
And before that they want for all American football conference titles.

845
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:51.861
All right.

846
00:51:51.861 --> 00:51:55.040
And there were three teams that were in the All American football conference

847
00:51:55.041 --> 00:51:59.080
that merged with the NFL in 1950 and I'm not counting those championships,

848
00:51:59.081 --> 00:52:01.070
by the way,
the all American football conference.

849
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:03.650
I wouldn't count those because that wasn't in the NFL.

850
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:07.340
That would be like the Lakers counting those BBA fucking championships.

851
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:08.833
Um,

852
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:13.870
the all American football constant conference existed from 1946 to 1949 they had

853
00:52:14.271 --> 00:52:17.720
four championship games and the fucking Cleveland browns when all four,

854
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:19.370
they dominated that league.

855
00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.480
That league merged with the NFL in 1950 and they took three teams with them.

856
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:26.330
The browns,
the cults,
and the 40.
Niners.
All right,

857
00:52:26.331 --> 00:52:30.770
we're continuing and we've got a couple more here.
The Philadelphia Eagles,
one,

858
00:52:30.771 --> 00:52:34.460
three,
three NFL titles.
Last one's 1960.

859
00:52:34.461 --> 00:52:36.500
That's what you want a chance at those angry bastards.

860
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:41.010
And then good luck to you after that.
40 niners one zero and five Superbowls.

861
00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:45.880
Steelers one zero NFL titles and have six Superbowls.
So they,

862
00:52:45.881 --> 00:52:50.300
you go for all you sports nerds out there.
That's the deal.

863
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.480
All right?
So I don't want to fucking hear any of this.

864
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:56.900
Any acting like those things don't count.
They do count.

865
00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.030
That was the best of the best back then.

866
00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:03.620
And they went through the same bullshit as every other fucking league with.
Oh,

867
00:53:03.621 --> 00:53:07.010
but they didn't let black guys play back then.
So what,
so what?

868
00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:11.060
Every other sport counts,
those fucking things.
So,
um,

869
00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.250
I didn't want to Hell my God damn point was,
but uh,

870
00:53:13.251 --> 00:53:17.210
you know what I did want to read to continue with,

871
00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:19.880
I'll get back to the stats in a minute,
but can I,
Hey,

872
00:53:19.881 --> 00:53:23.270
can actually bring up something here about the super bowl.
Um,

873
00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:26.190
what was going on with the beginning

874
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:30.960
<v 9>of the game to share with those fucking whaling whores that they brought out to</v>

875
00:53:30.961 --> 00:53:34.230
sing every song that,
that ever about America.

876
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:36.263
<v 4>You know,</v>

877
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:41.300
<v 9>they brought up that shit from fucking glee who tried to make America the</v>

878
00:53:41.301 --> 00:53:42.370
beautiful,
sexy.

879
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:48.720
<v 5>Well,
wait,
what does it oh or singing amazing Grace May zing grays.</v>

880
00:53:48.721 --> 00:53:51.080
They get the little as a slide,

881
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:53.320
<v 9>the fucking line.
All right.</v>

882
00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:58.070
She should have been booted right in the box and Christina Aguilera,

883
00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:02.120
right then she comes out with terror booze face.
Say.
That's why I let,

884
00:54:02.121 --> 00:54:06.050
I've been laying off the booze man.
That's it right there.
That's not baby weight.

885
00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:08.090
Alright.
That chick likes her bear.

886
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:12.860
She came out there and uh,
I loved her though.

887
00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:17.030
I liked how she sorta freestyle the national anthem.
You know what I mean?

888
00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:20.330
Who can honestly remember those words unless you're singing it with somebody

889
00:54:20.331 --> 00:54:24.350
else.
That's a really difficult thing to do.
She was just out there,

890
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.520
<v 10>stars then the free flow</v>

891
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.010
and could talk.

892
00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.410
Let's go to oh,

893
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:41.640
<v 5>sheltered else American.</v>

894
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:43.140
<v 4>Okay.</v>

895
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:47.810
<v 5>And the flag was still there.</v>

896
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:54.860
Um,
so what,
I mean,
how long did that,
you know,

897
00:54:54.861 --> 00:54:59.630
what kills me was I looked on my cable thing and it said Super Bowl pregame.

898
00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:03.410
All right.
Out here,
the super bowl comes on at three in the afternoon.

899
00:55:03.411 --> 00:55:08.411
So I see from fucking like 12 noon to like three is to pregame.

900
00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:13.070
I don't want to see that shit.
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a shit.

901
00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:16.400
I don't really see these people break down the game.
The keys to the game.

902
00:55:16.401 --> 00:55:21.170
I could give a fuck.
All right.
They're never right.
I don't give a shit.

903
00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.630
I just don't care.
So I'm like,
okay,

904
00:55:23.631 --> 00:55:25.910
the game starts at three and then I go to put it on.

905
00:55:25.911 --> 00:55:30.380
And what do they have more of this pomp and fucking circumstance and I don't

906
00:55:30.381 --> 00:55:35.210
like how they got to sing like 58 songs about fucking,

907
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:38.360
I understand that it's in America.

908
00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:39.370
<v 4>Okay.</v>

909
00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:40.420
<v 5>It's obnoxious.</v>

910
00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:44.810
Jesus Christ with the fucking songs and then the,

911
00:55:44.811 --> 00:55:47.450
and then they got to make them laugh every time you think that done,

912
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:51.890
they got to add a couple who had to the fucking line and you just sit in there.

913
00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:52.821
Yeah,
I don't get it.

914
00:55:52.821 --> 00:55:57.821
It's the most important game of the NFL season and they just drag out one douche

915
00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:01.910
bag after another.

916
00:56:01.911 --> 00:56:04.460
It has nothing to do with the game ended by the time the game starts.
It's like,

917
00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:07.980
I don't even give a shit.
Um,

918
00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:12.000
but at least Deion Sanders dressed up for the game.
Jesus Christ.
Man,

919
00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:14.250
that guy really was showing his age.

920
00:56:14.251 --> 00:56:18.450
How can you be that flashy and fuck up that bad?
You know what I mean?

921
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:22.500
It was like he picked out that shirt and tie and right before he went out there,

922
00:56:22.501 --> 00:56:24.190
somebody spilled coffee all over it.

923
00:56:24.191 --> 00:56:28.330
I think he had like a white suit and then he just went to the nearest like tire

924
00:56:28.331 --> 00:56:30.430
salesman.
Hey,
you know,
once you give me,
uh,

925
00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:33.490
just give me this brown suit and I'll just put it over.
This,
uh,

926
00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:39.670
<v 9>is candy came striped shirt with the fucking tie.
Um,
anyways,
let me,
let me get,</v>

927
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:43.960
let me get to some stats.
The past fucking week here.
I actually,

928
00:56:43.961 --> 00:56:47.230
I actually took the Steelers in the over just cause I knew everyone was going to

929
00:56:47.231 --> 00:56:50.200
pick the packers and the under.
I don't even know what the fuck was.

930
00:56:50.201 --> 00:56:53.020
I lost 25 bucks.
That was my big thing.
You know what?

931
00:56:53.021 --> 00:56:57.730
This is the first time the fucking podcast officially hit a goddamn speed bump

932
00:56:57.731 --> 00:57:02.620
here.
All Right,
Bill,
I'm emailing you.
So we didn't my stats last week,

933
00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:07.030
how many times I said fuck on the podcast.
This is pretty staggering.
So bill,

934
00:57:07.031 --> 00:57:07.690
I email,

935
00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:11.580
I'm emailing you to inform you that I served as your personal status Titian

936
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:16.600
statistician during your previous podcast on January 31st,
2011.

937
00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:20.620
I documented each and every time you said the word fuck or some variance of the

938
00:57:20.621 --> 00:57:25.240
word,
I must say,
you are in a goddamn league of your own.
Thank you.
Uh,

939
00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:30.150
you're the podcasting f bomb dropping equivalent of fucking wilt Chamberlain in

940
00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:35.180
1962.
Um,
all right,
let's get to,
um,

941
00:57:36.070 --> 00:57:38.610
anyways,
he said,
uh,

942
00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:44.410
it's kind of ironic that a patio on the back in a way for this feat because th

943
00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.890
through a little research I discovered that you used to pride yourself on a

944
00:57:47.891 --> 00:57:51.790
clean bit during the early stages of your career.
Yeah,
I did.

945
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.550
<v 5>I had to figure out if I could be funny without Carson.</v>

946
00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:59.290
Now once I proved to myself that I could,
I was then free to be myself.

947
00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:04.870
Um,
who's a cozy smug country.
Um,
despite that fact,

948
00:58:04.871 --> 00:58:09.310
he said it's obvious that you're off the wagon and fucking shit up on a whole

949
00:58:09.311 --> 00:58:12.160
nother level.
Nowadays your numbers are fucking astonishing.

950
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.170
You might as well throw on some red,

951
00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:18.160
red leather pants and a gold chain cause your volt,

952
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:23.110
you're vulgarity is reminiscent of Eddie Murphy's,
uh,

953
00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:25.480
in the 1980s,
you transparent bastard.

954
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:29.620
I'll list a few of your milestones below and then elaborate on just how

955
00:58:29.621 --> 00:58:33.520
revolutionary earth shattering your last podcast was.
All right.
This is actually,

956
00:58:33.521 --> 00:58:37.720
I was kind of amazed by this.
Uh,
first usage of the word fuck occurred.

957
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:42.100
38 seconds into the podcast.
You hit the century mark.

958
00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:46.650
17 minutes in this stat is mind boggling to me.
It took you little old,

959
00:58:46.651 --> 00:58:50.920
a little over the equivalent of one quarter of football to drop a hundred f

960
00:58:50.921 --> 00:58:55.480
bombs.
You did this almost leisurely too.
You're a fucking juggernaut.

961
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:59.770
I can only imagine the damage you do while watching a real quarter of football,

962
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:04.240
all sauced up on the juice.
So anyways,
I guess I,
I,
uh,

963
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:09.270
last week my podcast was 73 minutes and I said the f word 347 times.

964
00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:15.071
Jesus Christ.

965
00:59:15.071 --> 00:59:19.990
You used roughly a year's worth of cuss words in a little over an hour.
Come on,

966
00:59:19.991 --> 00:59:23.300
dude.
If you use the word,
there's no way you say it once a day.

967
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:25.550
Um,
all right.

968
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:29.360
That's 4.753 uses per minute.

969
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:33.650
You make Andrew dice clay and Bob Saget stuff.
Look PG 13,

970
00:59:33.651 --> 00:59:37.880
I'd argue that first half breakdown in the first 36 and a half minutes.

971
00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:41.420
I used it 210 times and the second half,

972
00:59:41.421 --> 00:59:45.590
137 look at that.
I slowed down after the all star break.

973
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:50.660
Everybody thought I was going to be the first guy to break 400 and I didn't.
Um,

974
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:56.420
so this guy actually uh,
made a graph of it.

975
00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.970
First of all,
if I can figure out how to download this shit I downloaded,

976
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:01.310
I can't find it on my computer.

977
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:06.640
He has the marker with next to was the sharpie with his headphones and all that.

978
01:00:06.651 --> 01:00:08.450
Like he's counting off days in prison,

979
01:00:08.451 --> 01:00:11.420
345 little slashes there in groups of five.

980
01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:16.370
And then he compared me to some of the most vulgar movies of all time.

981
01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.650
Um,
uses per minute.

982
01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:22.760
I beat out Casino Martin Lawrence Live Goodfellas,

983
01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.070
menace to society.
Eddie Murphy delirious,

984
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:30.100
the big Lebowski and pulp fiction and then total counts of movies.

985
01:00:30.141 --> 01:00:33.960
I came in second behind casino,
but in my defense that's like a two hour movie.

986
01:00:33.961 --> 01:00:36.680
So fuck them.
Um,
there you go.

987
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:38.960
Is that enough stats for you in the first 20 minutes?

988
01:00:38.961 --> 01:00:42.530
Jesus Christ can be ranked like 700 at this point.
Um,

989
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.460
so anyways,
what the hell was my,
uh,
my week,

990
01:00:46.461 --> 01:00:51.350
like I got over my road aids just to let you guys know I got over it.

991
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:53.950
Ah,
yeah.
I don't know.

992
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:58.340
It just kept getting worse till like Friday and uh,

993
01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:01.250
it's all cause I forgot my vitamins.

994
01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:04.610
I told you guys that I booked some acting work right for tomorrow.

995
01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.030
So what do I do?
I'm getting ready for the Superbowl.
Okay.

996
01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.070
My Pay Patriots got beaten by the jet,
so I don't give a shit.
Um,

997
01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.190
and I know I said it wouldn't trach rex Ryan,

998
01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:16.100
but for some reason I couldn't resist and I had to watch his post,

999
01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:17.943
<v 2>uh,</v>

1000
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.970
<v 5>game,
uh,
lost to the Steelers speech.
A just,
you know,</v>

1001
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.570
it just drove me nuts.
He was like,
you know,

1002
01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.960
you know,
a lot of people are gonna want to criticize us and they can,

1003
01:01:31.961 --> 01:01:35.940
but you know,
they don't have,
they don't have any right.
I,

1004
01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:39.690
it's just why don't they have a right,
he's like,

1005
01:01:39.691 --> 01:01:41.610
just change been through a lot.
Yeah.

1006
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:45.030
You created most of it with your shit-talking.

1007
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:48.510
You Shit talked the whole world the whole fucking year.

1008
01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.000
And you also said you were going to win the Superbowl.

1009
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:52.770
You run it the side of the bus and you didn't.

1010
01:01:52.771 --> 01:01:56.880
Why do you feel people don't have a right to give you shit at that point?

1011
01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:01.520
It's fucking annoying in your gear yet.
Oh good.
You had the shame you,

1012
01:02:01.521 --> 01:02:05.460
it's going to be the shame.
I'll have the same goal.

1013
01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.330
You know what I hate about that con is one year he's finally going to win it and

1014
01:02:09.331 --> 01:02:12.510
be like,
dude,
what?
I say what I say?
You know what you said,
rex?

1015
01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:15.840
The same thing you say every fucking day.
So stop acting like you called it.

1016
01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:20.070
I can't stand that shit.
It drives me nuts.
You fucking wrong.

1017
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.080
<v 9>Just be a man about it and be like,
yeah,</v>

1018
01:02:22.081 --> 01:02:24.150
I talked a lot of shit this year and I was fucking wrong.

1019
01:02:24.151 --> 01:02:26.940
So I'm here to take my medicine,
you know,

1020
01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:31.800
such a fucking fat bitch.
Um,
anyways,

1021
01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:33.910
so I'm getting ready for the,

1022
01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.780
I'm getting ready for the Superbowl and I don't give a fuck.
Writes the Steelers.

1023
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.820
It's the packers.
I don't give a shit.

1024
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:44.490
I ain't give a flying fuck about this game.
You know,
I don't,
I don't care.

1025
01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.630
Neither one of those teams I've ever done anything really to the Patriots.

1026
01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.350
I guess the packers beat us in [inaudible] 97,
but who gives a fuck?

1027
01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:54.540
We weren't supposed to win that game.
That was Brett Farve.

1028
01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.670
Remember that young Brett Farve,

1029
01:02:56.671 --> 01:03:01.560
he had brown hair and then he threw that first touchdown pass and he took his

1030
01:03:01.561 --> 01:03:02.770
helmet off and ran.
And when,

1031
01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:04.650
<v 5>hey,</v>

1032
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:06.860
<v 9>over to the sideline,
you remember that?</v>

1033
01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:10.630
And they actually had to make a rule that you can't do that anymore because he

1034
01:03:10.631 --> 01:03:15.631
was so blatantly trying to get some sort of national commercial.

1035
01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:17.283
<v 5>Ooh.</v>

1036
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:23.000
<v 9>Um,
he,
I'll tell he just loves the game.
That guy just loves playing a game.
Oh.</v>

1037
01:03:23.001 --> 01:03:27.110
How funny was it when the big Lebowski guy with the fucking most insane mustache

1038
01:03:27.111 --> 01:03:30.950
ever when he did those voiceovers people of Pittsburgh,

1039
01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:35.900
are you tired of them acting like people still work in steel mills out there?

1040
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:39.830
You know,
cause I have to admit,
as a fan from Boston,

1041
01:03:39.831 --> 01:03:43.310
anytime they do anything about New England,

1042
01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:46.370
they show a lighthouse and a fucking lobster fishermen.

1043
01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:51.790
And I lived there for 27 years and I never met anyone who worked in a fucking

1044
01:03:52.221 --> 01:03:56.630
light house,
ran a lighthouse or even worked on a fucking lobster boat.
Nobody,

1045
01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:01.730
you know.
And I didn't like clam chowder.
I thought it looked like a,

1046
01:04:01.731 --> 01:04:06.290
it just looked like a curdled milk.
Get Out.
Look Gross.

1047
01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.390
I didn't like it.
But you know,

1048
01:04:08.391 --> 01:04:10.540
they're just sitting there talking about Pittsburgh going,

1049
01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:12.360
<v 5>Eh,
Pittsburgh.</v>

1050
01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:17.610
Pittsburgh's a tough town built on steel and when you're in Pittsburgh,

1051
01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:21.730
if you get hit by a bus,
she mother calls you a Faggot,

1052
01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:27.160
<v 9>right?
Sorry,
got a little bit of the aids left.</v>

1053
01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:31.330
Um,
I fucking hate that shit.
And then they go up

1054
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.070
<v 5>big green basis.
Same Shit is itself welcome place.</v>

1055
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.340
People used to pack shit,

1056
01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:42.330
hope and greed it green bay when there's pack and it'd be done.

1057
01:04:42.331 --> 01:04:45.550
You don't have to look too far to find somebody to pack.
So

1058
01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:50.350
<v 9>did you know,
I just wish there would be more honest.
You know</v>

1059
01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:54.100
<v 5>there's place used to have a bunch of steel mills.</v>

1060
01:04:54.101 --> 01:04:57.940
Now they all closed down and they're all rusted and half of them got turned into

1061
01:04:57.941 --> 01:04:58.451
malls.

1062
01:04:58.451 --> 01:05:03.451
Now there's a bunch of half fag sitting in cubicles looking at spreadsheets of

1063
01:05:04.541 --> 01:05:05.400
Wisconsin.

1064
01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:10.410
You got a bunch of fat fucks that are the God damn fucking pasty and they got

1065
01:05:10.571 --> 01:05:13.750
read shit on their face from the God damn cold.

1066
01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.140
And she had been packed up here since 40 years.

1067
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:21.430
Nafta there a bunch of cheesy and fat flux.

1068
01:05:21.431 --> 01:05:24.630
This is all like that for the love of God.
Let the packers weird.

1069
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:26.740
Why don't they do shit like that?
Could they do that?

1070
01:05:26.741 --> 01:05:29.800
Then I'd watch it then I wouldn't have it on fucking mute.
You know,

1071
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:35.580
it'd be a nice break between whaling whores singing songs about America.

1072
01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:41.230
My is a fee

1073
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:48.010
that diva shit.
Ah,
cause Christina Aguilera.

1074
01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:52.210
How about some PNID ex baby.
Good Lord.

1075
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:55.640
I don't give a fuck.
She had a kid.

1076
01:05:55.641 --> 01:06:00.350
You still in your 20s go hit the fuck a treadmill.
What happened?
You know,

1077
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:04.880
that's the danger.
That's the danger.
You know?
That's why I'm so glad you know.

1078
01:06:04.881 --> 01:06:09.881
I had a choice at some point in my career to become a sex symbol and I was just

1079
01:06:09.951 --> 01:06:12.590
like,
you know what?
I'm not going to do it.
You know,

1080
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:16.940
cause there's only one way to go.
Just go down.
I did people,

1081
01:06:16.941 --> 01:06:19.550
I actually had the opportunity

1082
01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:27.140
to become Hollywood's first male redheaded sex symbol.

1083
01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:28.760
All right.
I know what you're thinking.

1084
01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:33.150
What about that fucking pasty freckled ass count who was on on end?

1085
01:06:33.210 --> 01:06:36.320
Ypd Blue fucked his whole career up.
What about that guy?

1086
01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:41.090
I have been in this business since before he fucked up his career.

1087
01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:41.960
Do you understand that people,

1088
01:06:41.961 --> 01:06:46.961
do you realize on March 2nd I am going to be celebrating my 19th year of

1089
01:06:47.481 --> 01:06:50.840
traveling to strip malls,
making people laugh,

1090
01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.980
giggle at my little wacky view of the world.

1091
01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:59.870
It's pretty fucking depressing.
I can't believe it,
man.
I remember when I was,

1092
01:06:59.871 --> 01:07:02.000
when I was a fucking kid,
when I got in this business,

1093
01:07:02.001 --> 01:07:05.000
when I looked at some of them been doing it 17 years,
I used to look at him like,

1094
01:07:05.001 --> 01:07:07.580
dude,
fucking hang it up because it is over.

1095
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:10.400
It is fucking over.

1096
01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:14.720
You are not making it buddy.
Okay.

1097
01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:20.500
Maybe that's why you sweat and right through your fucking sport coat.
Jesus.

1098
01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:25.270
I started in 1992 that's right.
So if there was a 17 year fucking veteran,

1099
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:29.740
not Jesus,
I gotta do math now.
That would be there.

1100
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:34.240
That would mean they started in 1975 if I worked with somebody in 1992 when they

1101
01:07:34.241 --> 01:07:39.070
started in 1975 I would bitch be like,
dude,
wow.

1102
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:40.280
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1103
01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.010
<v 5>What was that like?
What was it like?
You know?</v>

1104
01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:44.550
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1105
01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:48.210
<v 5>Drive into,
you know,
I don't know what the fuck you guys did back then.</v>

1106
01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.060
Flying on planes with propellers.
What,
what happened?

1107
01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:55.020
And now I don't know what happened.
I'm 19 years into this shit

1108
01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:58.980
and I realize now why those guys,
17 years,

1109
01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:03.990
it didn't quit because when you have a 17 to 19 year gap in your resume,

1110
01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:08.790
you know from the last time you actually had a day job,

1111
01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:14.940
excuse me.
Um,
yeah,
you're done.

1112
01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.330
<v 9>No,
no one's going to hire.
What are you going to hire me to do?
Sell cars.</v>

1113
01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:20.390
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1114
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:23.560
<v 9>All right.
What you been doing since 1992 I was kind of was kind of a cunt.</v>

1115
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:28.730
I have three and a half years of podcasts where I say some of the most horrific

1116
01:08:28.731 --> 01:08:32.480
shit ever.
There was any sort of corporate job.
Right?

1117
01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.810
Why the hell would I want to work for them anyways?
You know,

1118
01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:39.230
become part of the murder or whatever the fuck it is that you're doing.

1119
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:43.070
There's always some sort of killing going on when you were for corporation,

1120
01:08:43.071 --> 01:08:47.450
you know,
it is if you follow it and then you sit there lying to yourself.
Well,

1121
01:08:47.451 --> 01:08:51.560
you know,
I just shine the gun.
I don't pull the trigger,

1122
01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:53.443
<v 4>you know,</v>

1123
01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:00.940
<v 9>it's a fucking worst.
Um,
yeah.
So I've been doing it 19 years in,</v>

1124
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:04.440
there's really no turning back for me.
And,
uh,

1125
01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:08.760
if for some reason the bottom falls out,
I don't know what I would do.

1126
01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:13.160
I have no idea,
no fucking idea what I would do with,

1127
01:09:13.161 --> 01:09:15.300
which is why I don't think about this type of shit.

1128
01:09:15.301 --> 01:09:18.620
So I got 19 fucking years in.

1129
01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:24.700
That's unbelievable to me.
I remember when I hit 10 years in,
I was like,

1130
01:09:24.701 --> 01:09:29.500
Jesus,
I used to look at guys like 12,
13 years in when I had like eight.

1131
01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.310
Got Man,
they've been doing it a while.
They have to make it now.

1132
01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:38.470
They've been a make it now a is fucking over.
Um,

1133
01:09:38.530 --> 01:09:42.400
so I don't want them saying,
you know,
which probably brings up the question,

1134
01:09:42.401 --> 01:09:46.420
you like,
Bill,
do you think you made it?
Like what is it that makes you feel like,

1135
01:09:46.690 --> 01:09:48.220
you know what I think I did.

1136
01:09:49.150 --> 01:09:52.120
<v 4>I did right.
The fuck</v>

1137
01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:57.230
<v 9>I didn't have high look,
I must fucking see student.
Okay.</v>

1138
01:09:57.231 --> 01:10:01.040
So my goals aren't that high.
I look at it like I made that book glee this week.

1139
01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:10.390
Oh Shit.
I gotta get a puppet people.
I got to do it,

1140
01:10:10.391 --> 01:10:13.120
man.
I got to make it.
I have one year to make it.

1141
01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:17.470
If I don't fucking make it in the next year at 20 fucking years in,

1142
01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.640
I'll tell you right now,

1143
01:10:18.641 --> 01:10:22.570
you better build an extension to your Goddamn cubicle people cause I'm showing

1144
01:10:22.571 --> 01:10:26.590
up now.
I can't do it.
I left the program.

1145
01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.690
I'm like fucking uh,
uh,

1146
01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.840
what's his Marlon Brando's character in a pop apocalypse now?

1147
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:35.530
I'm all the way up the river.
It's over already.
Got Ahead on the stick.

1148
01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:39.640
There's no fucking way.
There's no way I could ever go back and get a real job.

1149
01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:44.740
I'd have to have a kid and be like,
I'm doing it for him or her.
Right.

1150
01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.180
That's the only way I could,

1151
01:10:46.181 --> 01:10:50.800
there's no fucking way I could go in there and have somebody.

1152
01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.810
Oh,
Bill.
Oh my noticed you came in at nine oh eight this morning.

1153
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:59.600
Yeah.
Did you,
did you notice anything else?

1154
01:10:59.601 --> 01:11:01.850
Like how fucked up that tie is you have like immediate,

1155
01:11:01.851 --> 01:11:05.100
I would just go to that actually.
I wouldn't,
yeah,

1156
01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.780
look at me trying to paint myself like I'm a bad ass.
I wouldn't,
I'd be like,

1157
01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:11.010
Oh yeah.
So I immediately go into that.
Sorry.

1158
01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.040
Traffic and you

1159
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:14.250
<v 5>know,</v>

1160
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:19.250
just become that guy and hate myself and take it out on some sweet lady of work

1161
01:11:19.711 --> 01:11:22.590
next to me has been with the company for 25 years.
You know,

1162
01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:26.250
she's never missed a day.
Yeah,
it's cause she's stealing from the company.

1163
01:11:26.251 --> 01:11:30.210
You'd dumb fucks.
Um,
she's too afraid to take a day off.

1164
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:34.620
You have think about that.
All right,
let's get,
let's get to some topics there.

1165
01:11:34.621 --> 01:11:38.550
So once again,
congratulations to the Green Bay packers.
All right.

1166
01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:43.110
Up there in Green Bay,
when you live off one of the Great Lakes,

1167
01:11:43.111 --> 01:11:46.310
you better take your Dick and wrap it around your balls because they're,

1168
01:11:46.311 --> 01:11:50.970
they ain't no room for pussies.
Sorry.

1169
01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.080
Um,
I bet it saved my voice.
See this is,

1170
01:11:55.081 --> 01:11:58.100
this is the type of self sabotage and that's been part of my career for the last

1171
01:11:58.101 --> 01:12:00.480
19 years.
I do shit like this.
I should,
you know what?

1172
01:12:00.481 --> 01:12:05.481
I should just be thinking of myself and say fuck you guys in the 52nd rank

1173
01:12:06.151 --> 01:12:09.900
podcast on iTunes and I should be resting up on my voice.

1174
01:12:09.901 --> 01:12:13.770
That's what I should be fucking doing it.
But I'm not,
I'm not,
this is,
this is,

1175
01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:18.720
this is what I,
you know,
I don't know why I just up,
I thought,

1176
01:12:18.721 --> 01:12:21.790
oh,
I,
this is my thought I had.
So I'm getting ready to go super bowl,
right.

1177
01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:24.280
I don't give a fuck about any of the team I,

1178
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:25.620
so I'm going to go make a couple of burgers.

1179
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.740
So I've been using this natural goddamn charcoal,
which is great.

1180
01:12:28.741 --> 01:12:30.570
Doesn't have that chemical shit on it.
You know,

1181
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:33.750
you know that shit when you're really hungry.
If he ever used that,

1182
01:12:33.751 --> 01:12:37.210
that match light stuff,
he just throw the Patty on too early.

1183
01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:41.640
You taste the lighter fluid fluid in,
in,
in your burger.
Um,

1184
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:44.190
so I'm using the natural stuff,

1185
01:12:44.191 --> 01:12:48.210
which takes longer to light and it's more of a pain in the ass when you get down

1186
01:12:48.211 --> 01:12:49.590
to the bottom of the bag.

1187
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.460
The pieces are too fucking small or he got one giant piece.

1188
01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:57.840
So I take out one giant piece.
It's like I'm not breaking this mother fucker up.

1189
01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.410
Long story short,
I couldn't get any sizzle,
a mag residual.
All right.

1190
01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:06.870
Then I'm starving.
So my girls,
I night,
well,
why don't we just make it,

1191
01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:11.160
why don't we just make it on,
on the,
on the,
on the stove top.
And it's like,

1192
01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:16.010
I'm like,
because I'm a man.
That's why,
because I can't admit defeat.

1193
01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.970
I can't admit the fact that what I'm doing.

1194
01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:21.240
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing right now.
All right?

1195
01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.670
So I just added more fuel to the damn fire.

1196
01:13:23.671 --> 01:13:28.470
So then they throw these fucking patties on
is what I do.

1197
01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:33.030
And uh,
I make these two fucking things.

1198
01:13:33.031 --> 01:13:35.670
I melt the cheese and I think everything's going on right now,

1199
01:13:35.671 --> 01:13:40.350
but I'm doing it like I had some sizzle on my grizzle.
You like that?

1200
01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:45.000
That's where a little hip hop,
not for this week.
And evidently I didn't.
So I,
I,

1201
01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:48.590
you know,
rather than cutting in and making sure everything was done,
it didn't,

1202
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.380
I just take these motherfuckers off.
Okay.
And they're like the size,
you know,

1203
01:13:52.381 --> 01:13:55.170
twice the size and Mcdonald's Burgers,
it just little ones.
I don't give a fuck.

1204
01:13:55.171 --> 01:13:59.400
Right.
So I take it off the grill.
I put one I put on my pervious,

1205
01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:02.900
which it's just ketchup and pickle.
I keep it fucking simple.
All right.

1206
01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:06.630
Slice the motherfucker and half and I look in the inside of it looks like raw

1207
01:14:06.631 --> 01:14:09.930
meat and immediately my brain goes,
don't eat that shit.
Okay,

1208
01:14:09.931 --> 01:14:12.460
you're going to get a coal lie.
You have to take glee tomorrow.

1209
01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:16.730
How can you sing with a deadly virus inside of you?

1210
01:14:16.731 --> 01:14:18.880
He just got overrode aids.
Okay,

1211
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:23.620
let's not had a cold light to this for.
What do I do?

1212
01:14:23.621 --> 01:14:28.450
I don't give a fuck.
I just eat the goddamn thing,
you know,
eat the fucking thing.

1213
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.300
I smell like smoke.
I got,

1214
01:14:30.301 --> 01:14:34.450
I'm taking a shower and I'm in that just waiting for this feeling of fucking

1215
01:14:34.451 --> 01:14:38.380
death.
You know?
Fortunately it never hit me,
but you know why?
Why?

1216
01:14:38.381 --> 01:14:39.850
Why would I do something like that?

1217
01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.710
Self sabotage stupid,
you know?

1218
01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:47.920
That's why I never booked an episode of Caroline in the city.

1219
01:14:47.921 --> 01:14:52.810
I mean I booked one,
but I uh,
you know I fucking night I got salmonella.

1220
01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:57.100
Um,
all right.
You know what people that story went nowhere.
I'm up.
I apologize.

1221
01:14:57.101 --> 01:14:59.410
So you know what?
I think it's time to bring a guest onto the show.

1222
01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:02.200
I'm going to hit pause here on the recording cause I got to set up the

1223
01:15:02.201 --> 01:15:02.711
microphone.

1224
01:15:02.711 --> 01:15:06.490
We're going to bring my lovely girlfriend in and she's going to contribute on

1225
01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:10.990
this week's version of um,
is it racist,

1226
01:15:10.991 --> 01:15:12.460
racist,
racist?

1227
01:15:15.170 --> 01:15:19.340
<v 9>Yes.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is time.
Once again for,</v>

1228
01:15:19.341 --> 01:15:24.050
is it racist,
racist,
racist,
yes.
And this time,

1229
01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:29.420
this time I am joined by my lovely girlfriend,
Nia.

1230
01:15:29.421 --> 01:15:33.290
How are you sweetheart?
I'm great sweetie.
How are you?
Fantastic.

1231
01:15:33.291 --> 01:15:36.560
Let's not be too nice to each other because of my listeners.
You know,

1232
01:15:36.561 --> 01:15:40.820
I find out this week I'm ranked 52nd on the podcast in iTunes.

1233
01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:43.700
Out of how many?
Like 63?

1234
01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:48.380
No,
I don't,
I don't know how many there are.

1235
01:15:48.381 --> 01:15:52.460
I know everybody has a plot here getting their baby.
See that?
All right,

1236
01:15:52.461 --> 01:15:57.140
well here we go.
We're gonna,
we're gonna,
we're gonna bring you in here and uh,

1237
01:15:57.230 --> 01:16:01.430
and I,
you know,
you gotta hand it to me,
Huh?
Um,
you know for what?
Well,
you know,

1238
01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:06.000
I booked glee this week.
Oh,
that's right.
I know.
I'm so excited about that.

1239
01:16:06.001 --> 01:16:10.740
And now I'm nervous about my dancing.
I'm all right with my singing,
but the,
the,

1240
01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:15.420
the,
no,
we've been working on your pot of arrays,
so I have felt pretty confident.

1241
01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:20.360
Fuck that.
And here we go.
All right.
Uh,
this guy wrote from a Byu.

1242
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:25.200
Are you familiar with Byu?
Brigham Young University?
This is the Mormon.

1243
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:29.540
You know those people,
right?
Sure.
Big gloves.
Yeah,
they're wild and out out there.

1244
01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:31.280
Right while and out while it out.

1245
01:16:31.281 --> 01:16:34.940
They have like 12 wives each skirts down to their ankles,
gorgeous.

1246
01:16:34.941 --> 01:16:38.690
Down to their ankles and they don't call us up to their right shin.
Yeah.

1247
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:42.650
And they're all virgins before they get married vaginally.
Right.

1248
01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:46.850
They just have anal [inaudible].
That's how they do it.
That's,

1249
01:16:46.851 --> 01:16:50.030
you tie everybody that the salt flats and you've seen that fucking sit.
Oh,

1250
01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:53.660
it's that state.
All right.
Byu,
is this racist?
He says,
Bill,

1251
01:16:53.661 --> 01:16:56.240
is it racist to root for Byu?

1252
01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:01.370
This is the college because they have the best scorer.
Glen Falls,

1253
01:17:01.371 --> 01:17:04.340
finest white boy.
Uh,

1254
01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:08.930
they start four white kids in total and our eighth in the note in the,

1255
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:13.640
because I do so evidently this guy's white and he's rooting for,

1256
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.450
uh,
this white basketball team.

1257
01:17:17.451 --> 01:17:20.120
Basically they start four white guys and one of the higher,

1258
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:23.810
the number one scores and eleague is white and he's white.
Is it right?

1259
01:17:23.811 --> 01:17:25.400
Is it racist?
Racist.

1260
01:17:25.401 --> 01:17:29.450
Because why don't you just use the effect of your garage band?

1261
01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:33.890
Because it takes too much fucking time.
Um,
plus I think it sounds better.

1262
01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:39.480
Racist.
Racist.
Yes.
Yes,
yes.
See,
I can do it.
Um,

1263
01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:45.200
is it racist that a white guy is white for white people on a white team full of

1264
01:17:45.201 --> 01:17:50.060
white people doing white things?
Plain white beliefs?
Plenty basketball?
No,

1265
01:17:50.061 --> 01:17:53.670
it is not racist.
Is Not Racist.
Okay.
And what?
Cause it,

1266
01:17:53.671 --> 01:17:55.010
it has nothing to do with race.

1267
01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:57.720
It's not like he's saying that God has everything to do with race.

1268
01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:01.550
Like he's saying like,
you know,
fuck black people,

1269
01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:05.420
they can't play basketball.
Right.
There's white people,
white people own,

1270
01:18:05.421 --> 01:18:07.310
that's what it is.
You know that it's not like that.

1271
01:18:07.311 --> 01:18:10.670
He just likes the white people.
I,
I,
this is what,
this is what I think.

1272
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.590
I think if you,

1273
01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:17.620
if your people traditionally suck at something or have been prevented from doing

1274
01:18:19.641 --> 01:18:23.150
something,
then it's okay for you to root for your guy.
Okay.

1275
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:26.460
Now that is nobody prevented what people from playing basketball.

1276
01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.200
We just sort of sucked at it for a while.

1277
01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.230
I don't understand why cause we can't jump.
No,
no,
no,
no.
I'm,

1278
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:39.140
I don't understand why he thinks that that would even be in the racist category

1279
01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:43.640
because we get in trouble for everything because he's rooting for a,
he's like,

1280
01:18:43.641 --> 01:18:46.340
I like this team.
I'm rooting for them,
but I don't want people thinking,

1281
01:18:46.341 --> 01:18:49.490
think I'm racist.
No,
it's because,
look,

1282
01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:52.280
if you're fucking 30 years or younger,

1283
01:18:52.281 --> 01:18:55.130
you don't even remember white people doing a 40 years or younger,

1284
01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:58.610
you don't remember was dominating any fucking spot other than hockey.
Right.

1285
01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:01.740
All right,
and we're starting to creep in on that a little bit that you know what

1286
01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.600
black people,
it's like,
it's like,
well,
Bronwyn,

1287
01:19:05.601 --> 01:19:08.480
Lebron talks about the scoring title.
Yeah,
I remember that.
Well,

1288
01:19:08.481 --> 01:19:09.171
you don't watch sports,

1289
01:19:09.171 --> 01:19:12.500
but like Lebron was just like one time they were asking him about the scoring

1290
01:19:12.501 --> 01:19:15.950
title and they were like,
you know what?
Anything about Colby.
And he said,
look,

1291
01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:20.060
if I wanted to,
if I want it to,
I could win that fucking thing.

1292
01:19:20.061 --> 01:19:22.940
But he's trying to,
like,
when I look at,
I look at hockey the same way,

1293
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:26.750
like a black people want it to,
if you want it to,
if we get dominated hockey,

1294
01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:29.360
you could,
I don't know,
you know?
I mean,
how many,
how many,

1295
01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:33.590
how many more sports examples do you need?

1296
01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:37.310
How many more sports do you have to fucking take over before you just sort of

1297
01:19:37.311 --> 01:19:41.690
realize,
you know,
you killing it.

1298
01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.500
Yeah.
Now that,
that,
that is not racist.

1299
01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:49.130
I don't think it's phrased as either because we've been getting dunked on for

1300
01:19:49.131 --> 01:19:53.570
fucking,
yeah.
I,
he wants to rule for white people.
That's not racist.
Yeah.

1301
01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:57.410
Okay.
All right.
So there we go.
That's,
that's the first one.
All right,
next one.

1302
01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:02.720
This is,
this is a good one here.
Uh,
racism or ethnic,

1303
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:07.260
then I have to fucking no ethnicity.

1304
01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:10.100
That's not what I did this after the Superbowl.

1305
01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:13.380
I got e coli and covering from road eights here.

1306
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:19.270
Bill a bit listening to your recent podcast about racism ahead.

1307
01:20:19.271 --> 01:20:24.240
Had a few questions.
Uh,
pop in my head.
Why do they call your background,

1308
01:20:24.241 --> 01:20:29.160
your ethnicity?
Example?
Spanish,
African American,
Chinese.

1309
01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:32.820
But why?
When we tee someone's ethnicity,

1310
01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:37.740
it's called racism.
Maybe it should be called ethnicity or ethnicity.

1311
01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:40.830
I don't know what he's basically saying.

1312
01:20:40.831 --> 01:20:45.831
There is a why if I guess if you go,

1313
01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:48.660
I don't like those German motherfuckers.

1314
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:51.690
Why would that be considered racist and shouldn't that be,

1315
01:20:51.691 --> 01:20:54.030
that would be more of an ethnic thing.
Cause they are,

1316
01:20:54.031 --> 01:20:58.890
they are a certain brand of white people.
I honestly don't know.

1317
01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:03.080
<v 11>I understand this question.
No,
no.
I think I'm a little stumped too.</v>

1318
01:21:03.081 --> 01:21:08.081
Like I don't know that I know that the difference necessarily between ethnicity

1319
01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:13.220
and race.
All right.
Well why don't I know that.
I don't know why,

1320
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:15.050
will tell me.
Okay.
Well

1321
01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:20.200
<v 9>races like,
like a would be like,
um,
um,
uh,</v>

1322
01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:24.080
here we go.
Uh,
black people,
white people like look,

1323
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:28.340
people from people from England,
France,
Germany,
all of them.

1324
01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:31.350
<v 11>Those are white people.
Ethnicity,</v>

1325
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:35.800
but like your ethnicity as German?
Irish.
I'm German,
Irish,
Scottish,

1326
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:36.910
English and French.

1327
01:21:36.970 --> 01:21:41.080
My hunch city is like African and like a small,

1328
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:45.190
small drop of native American or something.
You Go,
okay.

1329
01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:48.130
So what was your price?

1330
01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.000
<v 9>Racist.
Black I guess basically or African American,</v>

1331
01:21:51.090 --> 01:21:53.650
whatever the fuck you fill out.
Right.

1332
01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.560
I guess you say it a lot of times that uh,

1333
01:21:58.650 --> 01:21:59.670
I don't know what the fuck he's saying.

1334
01:21:59.671 --> 01:22:04.470
I think he's saying like if someone like was given shit about Irish people,

1335
01:22:04.471 --> 01:22:06.270
they say it's racist or something like that.

1336
01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:10.690
<v 11>Oh,
you're making fun of the ethnicity.
God,
you know,</v>

1337
01:22:10.691 --> 01:22:13.060
cause you're not trashing all white people,
right.
You're just,

1338
01:22:13.330 --> 01:22:18.330
you're just complaining about a certain ethnicity as opposed to entire race of

1339
01:22:19.451 --> 01:22:23.650
people.
Caucasian versus Irish or something.

1340
01:22:25.210 --> 01:22:28.690
Yeah.
I don't fucking know what,
I'm trying to get some fire on this topic

1341
01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.280
too.
Fucking artists.
You just agree with all of this shit.

1342
01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:35.530
I'm not agreeing with it.
I just,
I don't know why they,

1343
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:37.210
I don't know why that it's called that either.

1344
01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:40.960
Well you thought my older Asian game that I play,
you said that that was racist,

1345
01:22:40.961 --> 01:22:43.900
right?
Yes.
How,
how is that racist?

1346
01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:49.960
Not The old part.
That's ageist.
Right?
But um,
yeah,

1347
01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:54.310
cause you said that all Asian people can't drive.
I don't,
I didn't.
Yes you did.

1348
01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:56.640
What did I say that you always say that I didn't,

1349
01:22:56.650 --> 01:23:00.640
I said if somebody fucks up in front of me,
those are the two.

1350
01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:04.900
I'm guessing you don't see how that's or Asian,
you don't see how that you're,

1351
01:23:04.901 --> 01:23:09.040
you're like one group of people and stereotyping them.
Yes,

1352
01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:13.000
I'm definitely stereotyping them.
Oh,
I see.

1353
01:23:13.001 --> 01:23:14.500
But what you're saying is that you're not lying.

1354
01:23:14.501 --> 01:23:17.730
I'm not saying ain't Asians are bad people that Ah,
yeah,

1355
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:19.390
just saying that they can't drive.

1356
01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:23.800
So your stereotype in the quest and makes a fucking,

1357
01:23:23.801 --> 01:23:28.390
you turn on a highway if it's not an 85 year old guy,

1358
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:30.790
if you had to take your life savings,

1359
01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:35.470
I'm not even saying it's going to be an Asian guy.
So what if you had to bet,

1360
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:36.450
right?

1361
01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:41.450
And if your life was on the fucking line telling you I know what I know in the

1362
01:23:41.741 --> 01:23:45.730
grand question of his bill burr racist against Asians,

1363
01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:50.770
I would say no,
but he does stereotype them really,
really bad.

1364
01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:55.420
And who's fault is that?
Yours?
No one isn't.

1365
01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:57.780
Do you think I just pulled that out of it?

1366
01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:00.130
If someone said that white people can't jump,

1367
01:24:00.131 --> 01:24:02.500
do you think they just pull that out of their fucking ass?

1368
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:05.600
Don't how many fucking white guys do you have to watch?

1369
01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:09.520
How many six foot 10 inch white guys do you got to watch slam the ball under the

1370
01:24:09.521 --> 01:24:10.354
front of the rim.

1371
01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.470
It almost dislocate their shoulder trying to dunk on a fucking break away before

1372
01:24:14.471 --> 01:24:16.150
you can say white people can't jump.

1373
01:24:16.410 --> 01:24:21.400
Did you go and you go on youtube and you'll see some white dudes doing some shit

1374
01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:24.380
white people could do.
Right.

1375
01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:27.070
You think you're think there are the exception and not the rule.

1376
01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:32.150
I'm just saying that if somebody said to me who wasn't white said white guys

1377
01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:34.960
can't jump and they can't fucking dance,

1378
01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:39.090
I'm really not going to get into a heated debate about that.
Right.

1379
01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:44.580
I'm sure Donny Osmond can cut a fucking rug with John Travolta or whoever the

1380
01:24:44.951 --> 01:24:49.060
fuck you want to talk to him in federal line.
He was a dancer.
Yeah,
that's it.

1381
01:24:49.061 --> 01:24:52.990
That doesn't count before he became a meme,
but it wasn't though.
He hung up.

1382
01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:56.530
He hung out with black people and he did hip hop.

1383
01:24:57.790 --> 01:25:01.690
He bought one of those
video.

1384
01:25:01.691 --> 01:25:05.540
He had corn rows.
Yeah.
And he liked to bang black girls.
That doesn't count.

1385
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:10.410
That doesn't count.
It doesn't fucking count.
Timberlake.

1386
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:15.470
I mean stole Michael Jackson's voice and all the shit that Michael Jackson

1387
01:25:16.481 --> 01:25:19.570
actually stoled from Mimes and hip hop dancers

1388
01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.950
and James Brown.
James Brown.
There you go.
I don't fucking,

1389
01:25:23.951 --> 01:25:28.660
I'm just talking shit in here.
Um,
all right,
well I see the distinction,

1390
01:25:28.661 --> 01:25:31.390
but it's still,
it's still wrong.
What is wrong?

1391
01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.610
It's wrong of you to stereotype Asian people.

1392
01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:37.570
I'm not fucking hurting anybody.
It would get started off.

1393
01:25:37.930 --> 01:25:41.760
It started off as a joke in the fucking car.
I know that

1394
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:46.090
does stand up.
Sit down now.

1395
01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:51.940
Unless you're going to use that finger,
I suggest you put it away.
Oh Shit.
Shit.

1396
01:25:51.941 --> 01:25:56.230
That's from like second grade.
What do you have on boots right now?

1397
01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:58.180
It's really annoying.
Why are you in your underwear?

1398
01:25:58.181 --> 01:26:01.340
You want to talk shit cause it's fucking 10 o'clock at night and I'm in my own

1399
01:26:01.341 --> 01:26:04.760
goddamn bedroom.
If you were going outside,
that would make sense.

1400
01:26:04.761 --> 01:26:07.730
You're wearing tidy whities but they're black.
I don't know if these are,

1401
01:26:07.731 --> 01:26:10.670
these are like the snug ones.
They're like biker shorts.

1402
01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:15.110
They cut my balls and make them feel good.
What's wrong with that?

1403
01:26:15.111 --> 01:26:18.380
You said you like these and you were wearing your Boston Bruins yard.
I do like,

1404
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:22.250
but you got a lot of nerve standing up pontificating and your underwear.

1405
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:27.090
Why it areas?
It shows you how passionate and Emma,
but my opinions,

1406
01:26:27.670 --> 01:26:29.150
I want to bribe one of your listener.

1407
01:26:29.151 --> 01:26:32.230
So like send me something like an Amazon gift wish,

1408
01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:33.870
like a gift wishlist and then,

1409
01:26:34.110 --> 01:26:38.320
and I'll send them a picture of you right now as you are.

1410
01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.940
Can I do that?
Can I go ahead and do that?
That's the end of the year.

1411
01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:43.650
Fucking anytime you want to fucking have meals,

1412
01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.900
they don't need it at this point with technology.

1413
01:26:45.901 --> 01:26:49.670
They just take my hand picking on somebody anyway,
so that's true.
Yeah.

1414
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:51.330
Which is what they're all going to do now.

1415
01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:56.110
Anything else you'd like to add Kim?

1416
01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.770
So you guys will somebody please do that.

1417
01:26:58.771 --> 01:27:02.200
Make composite of that and email it to bill.
Okay.

1418
01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:05.860
And you know what this is all about is I have too much control in the

1419
01:27:05.861 --> 01:27:07.340
relationship right now.
So this is what you do.

1420
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:09.580
He's trying to get my listeners to turn on me.
Is that what it is?

1421
01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:14.530
Divide and conquer and making it funny.
I thought that's what I was looking for.

1422
01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:16.960
All right.
This is why I brought that shit up.

1423
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:20.350
This is why stood up my underwear and I started pointing at you raising my
voice.

1424
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:25.450
The fuck are we talking?
We were talking about that older agent thing.
Alright,

1425
01:27:26.290 --> 01:27:29.250
and it was one of the,
we were in the fucking car and you've,

1426
01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.990
you've admitted in the car,
you like Jesus Christ.

1427
01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:36.320
There's something to this game
and the

1428
01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:42.010
time when it was in a little odd,
that's the closest I'm ever going to get.

1429
01:27:42.011 --> 01:27:43.030
You admitted to your boss.

1430
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:47.560
The best one was when it was an old Asian guy and that's what we came up like.

1431
01:27:47.561 --> 01:27:51.170
That was hitting green.
Double Zero in fucking a roulette.

1432
01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:54.640
You had to call old Asian.
Well,
it's rude.
I have a,

1433
01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:55.760
this is going to sound terrible,

1434
01:27:55.761 --> 01:27:59.600
but I have Asian friends so I don't want people to think that I sewed a why they

1435
01:27:59.630 --> 01:28:04.430
Kevin Shay,
Bobby Lee.
I love Bobby Lane.
You don't love Kevin Shay?

1436
01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:08.030
I don't know him.
Really.
Bobby,
Lebron.

1437
01:28:08.031 --> 01:28:12.830
Kevin Shay is like the angry Bobby Lee.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
Got It.
Yeah.

1438
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:15.440
Bobby Lee's anger.
It's just somewhere hidden in there.

1439
01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:22.040
Fuck Jesus Christ.
And yet,
you know,
you know what this is.
This is right here.

1440
01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:25.850
This is why,
you know,
when you went home,
when you want to break balls,

1441
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.820
you got to hang out with other guys because the woman's going to ruin it.

1442
01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:35.180
What about why you want to bring in a little mini bill birth and here just your

1443
01:28:36.101 --> 01:28:38.260
own opinion.
Regurgitated over and over again.

1444
01:28:38.261 --> 01:28:42.290
Why don't you get bored with that audio of a crowd applauding underneath it.

1445
01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:48.580
Bill's always right.
Give me another,
is it racist?
All right,
well,

1446
01:28:48.581 --> 01:28:50.930
I have to look up one.
You really do.

1447
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:54.610
You realize I said the f word 347 times.

1448
01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:59.290
That is incredible.
Even for you.
Really,

1449
01:28:59.590 --> 01:29:02.120
Jesus Christ.
You just really abandoning me,
aren't you?
I'm

1450
01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:07.060
<v 9>not,
but that's excessive.
Yeah.
This podcast,</v>

1451
01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:14.130
<v 11>beard as excessive.
You're the one who told me to fucking grow it.
I love it.</v>

1452
01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:17.970
He told me to grow a God damn beard.
And guess what?

1453
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:20.190
You got a part on glee because of it.
And it's right.

1454
01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:24.850
I'm playing the part of Kenny Loggins.
All right.

1455
01:29:25.710 --> 01:29:29.800
<v 9>These are the ones that I'm just grabbing these,
Eh,
uh,
I don't know where.
Okay.</v>

1456
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.380
Uh,
okay.
And this,
this was your fucking idea too,
cause some of these get crazy.

1457
01:29:34.381 --> 01:29:37.740
All right,
Bill,
I'd like to,
it's your fault.
I'd like to use your,

1458
01:29:37.741 --> 01:29:41.850
is it racist segment to get a ruling on a dispute between myself,

1459
01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:46.880
a white guy and some friends?
The issue involves,
uh,
the,

1460
01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:51.810
the issue in question revolves around a particular Halloween costume of mine a

1461
01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:55.220
few years back.
You chose this one near,
here we go.
Anyway.
Uh,

1462
01:29:55.300 --> 01:30:00.300
anyone who's been to Vegas knows about the porn slappers that clog up all the

1463
01:30:00.691 --> 01:30:04.080
sidewalks on the strip.
I guess it was the guys who hand out the flyers,
I guess.

1464
01:30:04.081 --> 01:30:08.010
I have no idea.
I'm so calls because as they're handing out the stripper,

1465
01:30:08.011 --> 01:30:09.000
our US business cards,

1466
01:30:09.001 --> 01:30:12.130
they give him a quick snap on the hand shoving them in your face.
Okay.

1467
01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:16.440
As if having full color porn pushed on you while trying to walk down the street

1468
01:30:16.441 --> 01:30:17.274
wasn't enough.

1469
01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:21.720
I guess they deem it necessary to violate your auditory senses as well while

1470
01:30:21.721 --> 01:30:25.230
they got to get you to pay attention.
All right.
Um,
during a routine trip,

1471
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:29.840
I'm sorry that that slapping of the card that reminds me of,

1472
01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:33.630
remember when we went to jumbos clown room and that girl,
when we,

1473
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.020
<v 11>when we first went in there,</v>

1474
01:30:36.170 --> 01:30:40.340
the stripper was like super friendly as you walk in and then occasionally you'd

1475
01:30:40.341 --> 01:30:40.970
hear like,

1476
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:44.300
like a clapping noise really loud cause sound like somebody got shot and it was

1477
01:30:44.301 --> 01:30:45.610
her clapping her,

1478
01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:49.460
her stripper boots together trying to get your attention and cause the room was

1479
01:30:49.461 --> 01:30:51.080
too quiet and no one's paying attention to her.

1480
01:30:51.081 --> 01:30:54.230
It was so pathetic in there and all of a sudden it sounded like a gunshot.

1481
01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:58.860
It was clapping.
Her fucking
stripper quit on.

1482
01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:02.020
Exactly.
Anyway,
she didn't like say,
I'm never dancing get,

1483
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:06.800
she just stopped dancing.
She crawled over on her hands and knees to her purse,

1484
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:11.800
lied on her stomach,
pulled her phone out and started texting onstage,
still

1485
01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.500
<v 9>going titties out with the Thong on.</v>

1486
01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:17.820
But the best part was she,
uh,

1487
01:31:18.130 --> 01:31:21.910
she danced through the whole first song yeah.
And didn't make one dime.

1488
01:31:21.911 --> 01:31:23.950
It was slowly coming down the pole,

1489
01:31:23.951 --> 01:31:28.360
grade his love of all and then whatever the hell it and then landed on her back.

1490
01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:33.400
Not One guy.
She was terrific.
She was ugly too.
And um,

1491
01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:37.870
the next song started and she was just laying there.
She didn't answer the bell,

1492
01:31:37.871 --> 01:31:42.580
like a fighter quit on the fucking school.
I had no respect for them.
Anyways,

1493
01:31:42.581 --> 01:31:47.260
let's go,
let's continue here.
Uh,
during a routine trip to Vegas,
noticing yeah.

1494
01:31:47.290 --> 01:31:49.330
How he paints himself as somebody innocent.
You know,

1495
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:53.770
I thought it would be funny to dress up as a porn slapper for Halloween.

1496
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:58.900
So while there I collected a sizable stack of the previously mentioned cards.

1497
01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:04.230
When I returned home I had a fluorescent pink stripper direct to you shirt,

1498
01:32:04.541 --> 01:32:05.670
made a,

1499
01:32:05.710 --> 01:32:09.100
had it made up an assembled with other key components to create what I consider

1500
01:32:09.101 --> 01:32:12.960
to be an authentic reproduction.
Is this going to end with him in blackface?

1501
01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.830
<v 10>It's going to end with him and Mexican face or whatever.</v>

1502
01:32:15.831 --> 01:32:18.770
Cause that's all the guys seem to be like Hispanic.
Handing those out.

1503
01:32:19.190 --> 01:32:20.300
I know where this is going.

1504
01:32:20.301 --> 01:32:23.130
Here's when the train went off the tracks and the claim

1505
01:32:23.730 --> 01:32:25.230
<v 9>costume became racist.</v>

1506
01:32:25.650 --> 01:32:29.790
My completed costume consisted of a straw cowboy hat,

1507
01:32:30.330 --> 01:32:34.170
short black wig,
brown facial makeup,

1508
01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:37.170
a large mustache stripper direct shirt,

1509
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:39.630
so navy Dickies and tennis shoes.

1510
01:32:39.690 --> 01:32:44.690
Basically if Poncho villa to get a second job to pick up a little cash on the

1511
01:32:45.241 --> 01:32:47.790
side.
That's what I ended up looking like.
Now,

1512
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:51.930
did any of my so called white friends mentioned that this costume might be

1513
01:32:51.931 --> 01:32:55.710
racist during the construction frayed or they so called white or are they still

1514
01:32:55.711 --> 01:33:00.540
called friends so called white branch?
Of course not.

1515
01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:02.610
They didn't say,
oh basically says white friends didn't say shit,

1516
01:33:02.611 --> 01:33:04.350
but the second I'm out on Halloween night,

1517
01:33:04.351 --> 01:33:08.970
suddenly I'm surrounded by spokespeople for the Anti Defamation League.
Dude,

1518
01:33:08.971 --> 01:33:10.020
where the fuck did you do this?

1519
01:33:10.230 --> 01:33:13.620
My stance in all of this was a yes that the costumers privately,

1520
01:33:13.621 --> 01:33:16.590
racially insensitive,
but it was not done to be malicious.

1521
01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:20.250
I was just shooting for authenticity and therefore it wasn't racist.

1522
01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:22.830
My friends claim that it was blatantly racist.

1523
01:33:24.630 --> 01:33:25.920
The friends who didn't say shit,

1524
01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:29.570
we're not trying to step away my friends so called white bread.

1525
01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:34.380
Can I please get your opinion on this?
Uh,
all right,

1526
01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:37.470
<v 10>here's my question.
Did he have to,</v>

1527
01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:42.110
he could've done that entire costume without the,

1528
01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:46.920
let's say brown face without the Brown face and people would have gotten it

1529
01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:49.110
because he'd be heading out those bank.
He'd be saying be,
you'll be like,

1530
01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:52.080
oh cause everyone's gone to Vegas.
Everyone's seen those.
I went to Vegas,

1531
01:33:52.081 --> 01:33:54.570
I brought you back a stack of those fucking cards cause I thought it was funny

1532
01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:56.100
and so people would have gotten it.

1533
01:33:56.670 --> 01:34:01.670
So it does seem a little excessive to add the brown face when it's really

1534
01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:05.040
unnecessary.
So he is,

1535
01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:07.860
he's dipping his toe in the racist pawn.

1536
01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:10.800
I do not think that this person is a racist human being.

1537
01:34:11.010 --> 01:34:14.790
I don't think he's like he,
he thinks Mexican people or be,
they shouldn't,

1538
01:34:14.850 --> 01:34:17.010
I shouldn't even say my skin.
They could be Peruvian,
whatever.

1539
01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.720
I don't think things are bad.

1540
01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:23.010
But he definitely dipped his toe in because there was really no need to go that

1541
01:34:23.011 --> 01:34:25.980
far.
He could have gotten the entire thing and everyone would have gotten it.

1542
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:28.020
All right.
This is what I said he didn't need brown face

1543
01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:31.280
<v 9>is what I say.
I say this isn't racist.</v>

1544
01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:36.650
I say what he's guilty of is not knowing that he was going to be called a racist

1545
01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:40.550
because if every fucking due to hand in those things out that weekend was

1546
01:34:40.551 --> 01:34:45.551
Mexican and look like that and he went all out to try and look like that.

1547
01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.180
All he's guilty of is having a fucking kickass cost.
All right,

1548
01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.830
and if the way his brothers can make white chicks,

1549
01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:56.090
that fucking horrific horror that I fucking saw and I say it's up.

1550
01:34:56.091 --> 01:34:58.220
I didn't see the movie just like it was so fucking

1551
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:02.510
<v 11>weird that that just got to transvestite 80 for me when he took his foot out and</v>

1552
01:35:02.511 --> 01:35:03.380
had it on the table,

1553
01:35:03.381 --> 01:35:06.950
it just really was fucking doesn't understand how air we're supposed to believe

1554
01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:10.640
that everyone in the movie doesn't realize that it's black people in white face

1555
01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:13.230
cause it's so hot.
I'm like,

1556
01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:16.250
do people really believe that isn't an a white person?

1557
01:35:16.251 --> 01:35:18.770
Like they're talking to other white people?
Like it doesn't look weird.

1558
01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:24.290
And this is my thing.
If you can fucking do that.
Okay.
Which I get,

1559
01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.020
I get the rules are fucking different because all the bullshit that's happening.

1560
01:35:27.490 --> 01:35:30.490
So that's one of those things where he's guilty of light,

1561
01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:33.560
like a white person who doesn't mean anything bad but says you people are you

1562
01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:37.280
guys?
Right?
And then has to be like,
what?
I didn't know.
I didn't fucking know.

1563
01:35:37.281 --> 01:35:37.990
So I,
I wouldn't

1564
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:40.810
<v 9>say that that's,
that's,
that's not racist.
It's,
it's just a,</v>

1565
01:35:40.811 --> 01:35:43.830
but your friends are fucking sellouts who

1566
01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:46.520
<v 11>I think they did it on purpose.
I think they were like,
oh,</v>

1567
01:35:46.521 --> 01:35:48.640
this is going to be good.
They didn't have a purpose.

1568
01:35:49.130 --> 01:35:52.040
I think they wanted him to get called out.
If they did it on purpose,

1569
01:35:52.041 --> 01:35:55.880
then that's fucking it.
But yeah,
I don't think,
uh,

1570
01:35:56.630 --> 01:35:59.270
I think it was a little unnecessary to add that.

1571
01:35:59.271 --> 01:36:01.160
I don't think he needed that for the costume.

1572
01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:03.350
This is what I would say in a perfect world.
Right.

1573
01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:07.670
<v 9>He had a great costume,
but because of all the shift that we've done,</v>

1574
01:36:08.290 --> 01:36:10.610
you know,
that's just one of those,
one of those extra,
you know,

1575
01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:15.200
because of all the extra perks,
perks you get for being fucking white.
You know,

1576
01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.230
like you should see,
you should have seen the gift bag I got when I was born.

1577
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:20.480
It was,
it was fucking ridiculous.
Yeah,
it was.

1578
01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:25.060
<v 11>It was like a bag full of cash.
Oh yeah.
Subsequent life.</v>

1579
01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:30.220
Your college was automatically paid for it.
You had a job set up.
Oh yeah.

1580
01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:34.770
<v 9>We just bitch.
Cause no,
that's actually,
it's a,
you know,</v>

1581
01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:38.940
I,
if I,
if I could tell you,
I don't honestly how difficult it is being white.

1582
01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.170
<v 11>That's what I want and I want to know the why.
That's,</v>

1583
01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:46.710
I'd be curious to know why he felt like he had it to add that to it.
He did.

1584
01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:50.460
Maybe he didn't feel like the,
the costume was like clear enough.

1585
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:54.220
He's like,
I got everything.
You know what,
this needs penny.

1586
01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:59.310
He could even just left the mustache and not have to go.

1587
01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:02.070
It has a specific guy like Billy crystal.
Yeah.

1588
01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:05.550
<v 9>Would he use to do Sammy Davis Jr on SNL was in,</v>

1589
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:09.800
he was not only in black face,
he was in black body,
black,
everything.

1590
01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:10.761
He wouldn't,

1591
01:37:10.761 --> 01:37:13.730
I mean obviously not underneath but like he and he somehow he got away with it

1592
01:37:13.731 --> 01:37:17.210
cause he was doing a specific guy like how does that work?

1593
01:37:17.211 --> 01:37:20.240
But then Ted Danson comes out and does a roast.

1594
01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:24.140
I mean I'm really going far back here,
which allegedly everything goes.

1595
01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:27.950
Did you see on 30 rock when they had one of the characters in blackface?

1596
01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:31.400
They had a much,
I don't want shit.
Shut up.

1597
01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:35.320
<v 11>The girl that plays I Jane Krakowski.
It was really funny.
And then the context,</v>

1598
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:38.560
it made complete sense and it wasn't like,
all right,
well let me,
let me,
let me,

1599
01:37:38.561 --> 01:37:39.394
let me read one more.

1600
01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:41.820
<v 9>Yeah.
And then,
and then we're going to let you go here now though.</v>

1601
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:44.520
Another stunning performance here.
Dear belt after listing,

1602
01:37:44.521 --> 01:37:46.470
how much better am I getting at reading out loud.
Okay.

1603
01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:47.413
<v 11>You know what it is.
I do it now.</v>

1604
01:37:47.850 --> 01:37:50.070
I'm getting way better at this for like a little kid.
I am.

1605
01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:53.410
What I do is when I start to sound it out,
take your time,

1606
01:37:53.610 --> 01:37:57.150
<v 9>start to lose,
control the sentence.
Just make up whatever they're talking about.</v>

1607
01:37:57.690 --> 01:38:00.360
After listening to all the racist stories from the last two podcasts,

1608
01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:05.150
I really like your comedy bill.
I have one.
Did they really say that?
No.
Okay.

1609
01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:10.250
I have one I wanted to share that I have always felt I lost.

1610
01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:14.490
Uh,
all right.
Back in the 10th grade,

1611
01:38:14.491 --> 01:38:16.860
I had a friend name Robbie.
Um,

1612
01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:20.920
he happened to be one of the five black people in my high school.
Oh Geez.

1613
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:22.450
Here we go.
Here we go.
Yeah.

1614
01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:25.770
I knew him for a few years and we had a few classes together.

1615
01:38:25.890 --> 01:38:29.490
We both took some sort of technical drawing classes and sat next to each other.

1616
01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:34.230
After we became sort of friends,
he thought it was okay to call me cracker Hunky,

1617
01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.150
et cetera.
This must have been the 70s.
So if you broke out Hunky,
uh,

1618
01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.870
I'm pretty sure he stopped calling me by my real name and only by my racial

1619
01:38:42.871 --> 01:38:46.860
slurs in a while.
See how I'm white and I'm pretty laid back.

1620
01:38:46.861 --> 01:38:50.520
I didn't give a fuck about what he called me.
Yeah.
I mean,
at that point,

1621
01:38:50.521 --> 01:38:53.070
if every president was white at that point,
you don't give a shit.

1622
01:38:53.130 --> 01:38:54.960
It doesn't carry as much water.
So anyways,

1623
01:38:54.961 --> 01:38:59.790
after about two weeks of being bombarded with racial slurs,
see,

1624
01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:03.540
I don't even consider those racial slurs.
I just consider those,
you know.

1625
01:39:05.130 --> 01:39:05.650
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1626
01:39:05.650 --> 01:39:08.410
<v 9>I,
I don't consider those ratios.
Yeah.</v>

1627
01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:11.880
Hey white boy,
that doesn't bug me.

1628
01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:12.890
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1629
01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:17.570
<v 9>Hey,
fucking black guy
does.
It does,
it doesn't bother me.</v>

1630
01:39:17.630 --> 01:39:21.740
I don't give a shit.
Hey,
black guy.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

1631
01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:25.670
after about two weeks of being bombarded with racial slurs,
I figured I would,

1632
01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:30.620
I would say,
oh no.
Well,
okay,

1633
01:39:30.710 --> 01:39:35.060
thank him.
He started.
Yeah.
Yes.
You know what it means.

1634
01:39:35.061 --> 01:39:37.040
I figured that by saying it,

1635
01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:42.460
it would be all be in good fun and we would have a good laugh and it would be

1636
01:39:43.041 --> 01:39:47.630
over.
Oh,
I hope.
I hope he buried it in the middle of a sentence.

1637
01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:51.080
That's the only way.
If he had,
he needs a lot of words surrounding it.

1638
01:39:51.650 --> 01:39:53.690
Any better now to set it with the are,
here we go.

1639
01:39:53.691 --> 01:39:57.980
So one day a great opportunity came along when I walked in the room and Robbie

1640
01:39:57.981 --> 01:40:01.490
says,
what's up my cracker in my head,

1641
01:40:01.491 --> 01:40:05.570
I was telling myself to let her rip that's so close to get her done.

1642
01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:09.440
This isn't going to end good.
So while I'm doing some sort of stupid hand shape,

1643
01:40:09.441 --> 01:40:12.410
I replied to Robbie saying,
what's up my n word?

1644
01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:14.750
Instantly without hesitation,

1645
01:40:14.751 --> 01:40:18.110
Robbie's ancestral tribal warrior spirit kicked in.

1646
01:40:18.111 --> 01:40:22.190
Next thing I knew I was being manhandled by a black kid that was much bigger

1647
01:40:22.191 --> 01:40:26.030
than me.
Uh,
the scuffled didn't last long and nobody got hurt.

1648
01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:29.980
He said,
what's up my crack?
And then you said,
what's up my n word?

1649
01:40:29.981 --> 01:40:34.730
And that was a fun mats
that kind of seemed like the comedically that would flow.

1650
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:38.780
Yeah.
And it would be like funny and everyone would be like,

1651
01:40:38.781 --> 01:40:41.000
everyone in school would be kind of like,
wow.

1652
01:40:41.001 --> 01:40:43.800
Like they have that kind of relationship that they can go back and forth like

1653
01:40:43.801 --> 01:40:48.200
that.
Well his actually sounds like a really bad sitcom.
It does.

1654
01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:52.100
All right,
let's finish.
Here we go.
After the fight,

1655
01:40:52.101 --> 01:40:56.920
we got into a twisted debate on how I was somehow wrong for what I said,

1656
01:40:57.550 --> 01:41:01.940
Eh,
that Robbie wasn't,
it was some,
uh,
with some complete bullshit,

1657
01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:06.280
like a bunch of pussies,
afraid of appearing racist.

1658
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:08.880
None of the other white kids in my class had my back to this date.

1659
01:41:08.890 --> 01:41:12.250
Still Amaze me how sensitive people are when it comes to racist shit.

1660
01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:16.430
Robbie could clearly dish it out,
but he couldn't handle any,
uh,

1661
01:41:16.450 --> 01:41:20.380
heat directed toward him.
I didn't give a shit what he called me,
but,

1662
01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:23.050
uh,
shit right there.
I should have made up some shit.

1663
01:41:23.051 --> 01:41:25.810
I didn't give a shit when he called me because I knew he was just joking around.

1664
01:41:25.811 --> 01:41:27.730
When I started joke around with him,
he flipped out.

1665
01:41:27.850 --> 01:41:30.220
We still remained friends throughout high school.
To this day,

1666
01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.860
I feel as if I didn't do anything wrong,

1667
01:41:32.861 --> 01:41:36.040
but I still feel as if I lost the argument.
What do you think?
Uh,

1668
01:41:36.041 --> 01:41:39.360
I think that's one of those things where,
uh,

1669
01:41:40.770 --> 01:41:45.190
uh,
maybe because,
because it was too many other white people around,

1670
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:48.040
but it was one of those things where he should have got at least two minutes for

1671
01:41:48.041 --> 01:41:49.020
instigating on that run.

1672
01:41:49.090 --> 01:41:51.280
<v 10>You know,
what were they fighting?</v>

1673
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:56.190
One gets two minutes cause I can see where if they were in private they might've

1674
01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:57.880
said that to each other and laughed.

1675
01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:02.890
But if there's other people around then his friend feels like embarrassed and

1676
01:42:02.891 --> 01:42:06.790
humiliated and like,
oh you're letting this guy say whatever you want.

1677
01:42:06.850 --> 01:42:08.950
So you know,
but this is like,

1678
01:42:08.951 --> 01:42:13.951
this kind of like reminds me of when black people say that we shouldn't be so

1679
01:42:14.951 --> 01:42:19.900
casual about the n word because it makes white people think that you guys can

1680
01:42:19.901 --> 01:42:23.190
just say it to us because we say it to each other all the time.

1681
01:42:23.191 --> 01:42:27.370
Even the guys say to each other all the time.
I see what the big deal is,

1682
01:42:27.610 --> 01:42:31.480
rappers and stuff.
You guys were constantly saying it.
So it's like,

1683
01:42:31.610 --> 01:42:36.220
and now it's a problem if I say it.
Yeah,
clearly not the same thing.
However,

1684
01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:38.710
I do see that side of the argument where it's like,

1685
01:42:38.711 --> 01:42:42.850
well in a lot of it's from like older black people too that are like,
you know,

1686
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:46.060
you can't keep saying it like that cause white people will think that we don't

1687
01:42:46.061 --> 01:42:49.360
respect ourselves and so they should neither blah blah blah.
Right.

1688
01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:53.080
<v 9>Let me go back to the white guy.
Go,
well what you guys say do Joe Blow?</v>

1689
01:42:53.230 --> 01:42:56.700
That's just a racist for the most part that's just a racist white guy.
Yeah.

1690
01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:00.600
<v 10>Tried to acting is rationalize.
Yes.
Saying the n word.</v>

1691
01:43:00.650 --> 01:43:04.230
I was trying to rationalize trying to get away with it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No.
Okay.

1692
01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:05.450
So I would say

1693
01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:08.440
<v 9>pretty much that's what that is.
I never a,</v>

1694
01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:11.320
<v 10>I don't think his friend should have opened the door to use that kind of</v>

1695
01:43:11.321 --> 01:43:13.990
language and I think his friend was kind of enjoying the phone.

1696
01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:16.930
I call him a cracker and Honky,
I think he liked that,

1697
01:43:16.931 --> 01:43:18.220
that he could just say that to him.

1698
01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:21.400
And it might've been like some sort of subconscious like yeah,

1699
01:43:21.401 --> 01:43:24.100
see I can say whatever I want and you can't say shit to me.

1700
01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:28.360
And then when he did it was like,
no,
you can't.
Which isn't exactly fair.

1701
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:29.140
Well it depends on how

1702
01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:32.380
<v 9>set it.
If you went a little high pitched and try to say it like funny,</v>

1703
01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:33.273
I think he could've.
Yeah.

1704
01:43:35.190 --> 01:43:39.390
<v 10>What's his face?
Do you impression of the peanut here?
How does he,</v>

1705
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:42.890
how does he always greet the black guy on it?
No,
no.
Say it.

1706
01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:46.140
Say The white people for,
we were like,
Hey Sharon.
He goes,
hey,
how you doing?

1707
01:43:46.141 --> 01:43:50.040
Villi?
How's it going?
Tommy looking good.
How you doing Nathan?

1708
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:57.320
<v 9>Oh,
fucking bad.
That's just embarrassing.
Um,
Oh,</v>

1709
01:43:57.340 --> 01:43:58.560
speaking of embarrassing,

1710
01:43:58.590 --> 01:44:03.240
I asked last week who was the last white guy to win an NFL rushing title and I

1711
01:44:03.241 --> 01:44:05.400
actually got two interesting answers.
Okay.

1712
01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:10.230
The last time a white guy won it for the conference,

1713
01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:15.680
Mark Van Egan it for the AFC in 1977 but Walter Payton one,

1714
01:44:15.871 --> 01:44:20.871
the overall rushing title and Jim oldest one in 1975.

1715
01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:27.060
That doesn't sound like a white guy named does it.
Jim Otis,
uh,

1716
01:44:27.170 --> 01:44:28.650
flow either way with that one.
Yeah.

1717
01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.080
Oldest Anderson for the Saint Louis Cardinals.

1718
01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:35.010
He wanted and I think Oj Simpson one at that year,

1719
01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:38.370
uh,
speaking of white people,

1720
01:44:41.850 --> 01:44:42.730
<v 10>I didn't know what he meant by that.</v>

1721
01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:48.070
<v 9>During his,
his,
uh,
the woman,
he fucking,
oh my God.</v>

1722
01:44:48.071 --> 01:44:51.390
A debt to married to back when that verdict was read and we watched it.

1723
01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:55.010
We were watching it in high school and I went to,
you know,

1724
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:56.500
pretty much an all white high school.

1725
01:44:56.501 --> 01:44:58.240
There was definitely some black people there,

1726
01:44:58.241 --> 01:45:00.220
but not as many as the way people are.

1727
01:45:00.221 --> 01:45:02.910
You guys like high fiving is every other white person faces

1728
01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:07.110
<v 10>did it was weird.
Yeah,
it was a weird thing because it's like,
yeah,</v>

1729
01:45:07.111 --> 01:45:11.820
we were watching it in class,
you know,
when we should have been learning,

1730
01:45:11.850 --> 01:45:15.210
but we're watching it in class and then so the verdict and the like,

1731
01:45:15.330 --> 01:45:19.740
you can feel them wanting to sell,
like wanting to be like no.

1732
01:45:19.741 --> 01:45:21.570
And then them looking at me and you know,

1733
01:45:21.571 --> 01:45:25.260
looking at maybe the other one other black Bustos and I remember this guy coming

1734
01:45:25.261 --> 01:45:29.120
up to me,
he goes,
listen,
I am not racist.
And I go,
oh Geez,

1735
01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:35.760
hold that white bitch.
But I think,
I think,
I think he should have gone to jail.

1736
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.890
And I was like,
ah,
okay.

1737
01:45:38.130 --> 01:45:41.860
<v 9>And I said,
well,
he's not,
and he goes,
well,
oh.</v>

1738
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:44.920
And then he just walks away and he walked away and then you probably mumbled

1739
01:45:44.921 --> 01:45:49.090
some other shit.
Um,
but he just felt the need to let me know.
Right.

1740
01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:52.300
Well that's one of those things where black people being happy where the say

1741
01:45:52.330 --> 01:45:56.620
that was just like the white guy rooting for Byu because they just,
you know,

1742
01:45:56.621 --> 01:46:00.820
white guys have not succeeded in basketball and you guys haven't done so well in

1743
01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:01.560
the trials.

1744
01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:03.690
<v 10>Not so much.
Yeah.
Throughout history.</v>

1745
01:46:03.691 --> 01:46:08.691
So it was less about the fact that he clearly did it then the fact that,

1746
01:46:10.021 --> 01:46:10.854
you know,

1747
01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:14.180
<v 9>no he didn't because he wrote that book where he said if he was gonna do it,</v>

1748
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:20.260
<v 10>everyone know what the book was totally different.
The book never even came out.</v>

1749
01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:21.650
First pack of [inaudible] football

1750
01:46:21.650 --> 01:46:25.980
<v 9>cards I ever got Oj Simpson was,
was the,
was the,
uh,</v>

1751
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:29.000
was the first one and I fucking loved the guy.

1752
01:46:29.230 --> 01:46:32.360
He betrayed you guys more than he betrayed us outlook,

1753
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:35.330
which is the ultimate irony.
He,

1754
01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:39.110
I can't even say what I,
what,
how I feel about that shit,

1755
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:40.730
but I'm going to tell you this,

1756
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:45.790
there is actually a picture somewhere in the attic of my life of me in second

1757
01:46:47.031 --> 01:46:51.360
grade sitting on Santa clauses lap with an Oj Simpson Jersey

1758
01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:57.660
that says it all in a sticker on my hand because I had a good day at school or

1759
01:46:57.661 --> 01:47:01.730
some shit.
I don't know.
Oh,
I just remembered another example of,
uh,

1760
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:04.470
well let me fit in a NSA black face.
Let me,

1761
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:09.510
let me finish the rushing title and the last white guy to overall when a rushing

1762
01:47:10.051 --> 01:47:13.290
title like no bullshit was 1962,

1763
01:47:13.291 --> 01:47:17.940
Jim Taylor for the Green Bay packers and he wanted an in between,
uh,
Jim Brown.

1764
01:47:18.150 --> 01:47:21.280
I don't know what happened to Jim Brown that year,
but uh,
so he wanted,

1765
01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:24.600
so there you go.
That's essentially the pot.
Yeah,
it's a podcast for this week.

1766
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:29.570
I got a rest up to do my daily this week.
Um,

1767
01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:34.380
you know what song I'm singing?
No,
what is it?
Ah,
I'm too embarrassed to even say,

1768
01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:37.870
you shouldn't say let it be a surprise.
Let it be a surprise.
All right.

1769
01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:42.450
None of when the tune in it's ugly on the glean network.

1770
01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:45.000
And we'll switch your last thing before I sign off here.

1771
01:47:45.001 --> 01:47:46.190
Cause I got to upload this shit.

1772
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:48.740
<v 10>No,
I'm just gonna I just wanted to talk about really quickly,</v>

1773
01:47:48.741 --> 01:47:50.960
I had a boyfriend in college and

1774
01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.010
we had a great time.

1775
01:47:55.450 --> 01:47:57.280
<v 9>Hey listen,
I know I do have a couple more.
Tufts,</v>

1776
01:47:57.281 --> 01:47:58.660
I don't even know your fucking boyfriend

1777
01:47:58.770 --> 01:47:59.620
<v 10>college.
No,</v>

1778
01:47:59.621 --> 01:48:04.090
it has nothing to do with our relationship is when he was a little kid and he

1779
01:48:04.150 --> 01:48:09.000
was dressed as a hobo for Halloween.
He was white by the way.
Um,

1780
01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:10.870
and he put dirt on it.

1781
01:48:10.871 --> 01:48:14.050
Like he wanted to put like brown makeup on his face to look like dirt.

1782
01:48:14.051 --> 01:48:18.390
So He'd look like a dirty Hobo and it looked like
black.

1783
01:48:19.570 --> 01:48:23.410
Oh.
He went all out.
People were like,
do you think all black people are homeless?

1784
01:48:23.411 --> 01:48:26.390
And he was saying,
I just want to be dirty.
So it was,

1785
01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:30.580
<v 9>which made it worse,
but it was hilarious.
Yeah.
Geez,
that's a funny story.</v>

1786
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:35.170
It really isn't.
No,
you know,
cause cause the fact that he told you that story,

1787
01:48:35.171 --> 01:48:37.180
I can see how far into the relationship you are,

1788
01:48:37.181 --> 01:48:39.910
which means other things were going on,
which I really didn't need to know.

1789
01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:44.290
All right,
here's one best teacher ever.
Listen to this guy.
This,

1790
01:48:44.291 --> 01:48:47.380
I got this from a teacher with the fuck was this guy when I was in high school.

1791
01:48:47.530 --> 01:48:50.320
Hey Bill,
first of all,
love your podcast and your stand up.
Thank you.

1792
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:53.470
The reason why I'm writing to you is I'm a math teacher and I have a student

1793
01:48:53.471 --> 01:48:54.730
who's a class clown.

1794
01:48:54.970 --> 01:48:58.630
I really think he has the potential to be a great standup comedian and I want to

1795
01:48:58.631 --> 01:49:03.310
suggest that to him,
um,
as a potential future for him.
Um,

1796
01:49:03.311 --> 01:49:06.160
I don't think that academics is really his thing.

1797
01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:11.170
What would be some good things slash advice to show slash tell him,
right?

1798
01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:14.280
Rather than being the asshole teacher would be like you shut down,

1799
01:49:14.290 --> 01:49:16.870
shut your fucking mouth and make them clap.

1800
01:49:16.871 --> 01:49:21.130
The erases whatever the fuck these kids do nowadays.
Um,
this guy's actually,

1801
01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:24.310
I'm actually brought the guy back.
I said,
what?
I always say,

1802
01:49:24.311 --> 01:49:27.310
write five minutes of Shit you think's funny.
Sign up for an open mic.

1803
01:49:27.311 --> 01:49:30.220
When they call your name,
go up on stage and there you got.

1804
01:49:30.221 --> 01:49:33.880
Don't judge yourself the first 10 to 15 times you do it 10 times.

1805
01:49:33.881 --> 01:49:37.480
I would say it's all about being like,
wow,
I'm holding a microphone.

1806
01:49:37.481 --> 01:49:38.410
I'm really doing that.

1807
01:49:38.411 --> 01:49:41.790
They really do have brick walls behind me as you're trying to remember your
shit,

1808
01:49:41.791 --> 01:49:45.540
but after 10 times,
then you start getting a feel for it and then then you,

1809
01:49:45.630 --> 01:49:47.350
then everything else falls into fucking place.

1810
01:49:47.550 --> 01:49:51.520
They have a talent contest at a talent show at the school.
He should do it too.

1811
01:49:51.570 --> 01:49:54.670
Oh he shouldn't.
That's what I need to tell you.

1812
01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:59.620
Under no fucking circumstances,
should you ever go on stage.

1813
01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:04.120
The first time you ever did standup comedy in front of your own fucking class.

1814
01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:06.550
Oh my God.
Oh,
that's true.
Because if it doesn't go well,

1815
01:50:06.551 --> 01:50:07.510
it's going to be humiliating.

1816
01:50:07.511 --> 01:50:11.740
So he should do it somewhere else away from us so he can work it out.

1817
01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:13.890
So he doesn't bomb in front of all those friends.

1818
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:18.040
Everybody's going to heckle you in that case,
your balls that that is like,

1819
01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:22.450
that's why like bombing on a cruise ship sucks because when you,
after you bomb,

1820
01:50:22.451 --> 01:50:27.451
you can't leave just with the crowd and everybody just sits there looking at you

1821
01:50:28.570 --> 01:50:31.150
and that that's at least a cruise is over in a week.

1822
01:50:31.150 --> 01:50:34.150
This kid's got to finish off the fucking school year.
But for the love of God,

1823
01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:39.390
if the teacher's listening do not tell him to sign up for a talent fucking

1824
01:50:39.521 --> 01:50:40.090
contest,

1825
01:50:40.090 --> 01:50:43.240
don't do that because that's the type of thing that could leave in emotional

1826
01:50:43.241 --> 01:50:44.021
scar with a kid.

1827
01:50:44.021 --> 01:50:48.340
Might not do it again for five years or never fucking do it again.
Okay.

1828
01:50:48.341 --> 01:50:49.810
You need,
okay.

1829
01:50:50.050 --> 01:50:53.860
You need an escape plan when you're going to go up and do that shit.
Believe me,

1830
01:50:53.890 --> 01:50:58.480
we're not the first time ever fucking bombed.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1831
01:50:58.810 --> 01:50:59.800
Where was the fucking roof?

1832
01:50:59.910 --> 01:51:04.910
Where was the first time you bond in some fucking bar in uh,

1833
01:51:05.670 --> 01:51:07.900
uh,
north reading Massachusetts.

1834
01:51:07.901 --> 01:51:11.110
I want to say some place Kelly's or something doesn't even exist anymore.

1835
01:51:11.770 --> 01:51:14.980
And I walked in and there was this function,
this little half of the bar,

1836
01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:19.630
we could sit down and eat fucking fish and chips and there was like nobody there

1837
01:51:19.631 --> 01:51:20.740
other than other comedians.

1838
01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:24.430
And then like three fucking people who came to see another comedian and then up

1839
01:51:24.431 --> 01:51:29.350
at the bar with just guys drinking like five people spread out amongst 15
chairs.

1840
01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:32.740
You're eating your balls and I didn't know how to handle it.

1841
01:51:32.741 --> 01:51:35.770
And I went up there and I just bombed and said,

1842
01:51:35.771 --> 01:51:37.090
oh I was supposed to do five minutes.

1843
01:51:37.091 --> 01:51:41.950
I bailed like two minutes in and said on the Mike,
I told you that.

1844
01:51:42.710 --> 01:51:46.840
I said to the host Jack,
go jack on Balan in all the comics went ahh.

1845
01:51:46.841 --> 01:51:50.510
And then I felt like a fucking pussy and I want to do is just walk off stage

1846
01:51:50.511 --> 01:51:52.930
getting my car and drive home.
But I was so humiliated.

1847
01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:56.590
I sat in the first fucking chair that was open,

1848
01:51:56.591 --> 01:52:00.310
which was like two rows in and just sat there with my head down wanting to leave

1849
01:52:00.311 --> 01:52:03.550
the whole time.
And sat there throughout the rest of the fucking open mic,

1850
01:52:03.551 --> 01:52:04.840
like a scolded child.

1851
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:10.270
And then I drove home and cried classic German Irish.

1852
01:52:10.271 --> 01:52:11.920
Rather than dealing with the emotion,

1853
01:52:11.921 --> 01:52:16.300
I kept trying to put it outside of my body and it was just hanging in my car the

1854
01:52:16.301 --> 01:52:19.000
whole fuck.
It was horrific.
I can't imagine doing that.

1855
01:52:19.090 --> 01:52:22.480
And then doing it in front of your tire fucking class.
It was horrific.

1856
01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:27.150
So that was my bad.
All right,
you to youtube,

1857
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.630
youtube fucking videos of the week.
Uh,
this one,
uh,

1858
01:52:31.631 --> 01:52:34.720
Brad Garrett was on the job,
a bay horse show.

1859
01:52:34.930 --> 01:52:39.130
If you just want to see a fucking standup comedian in complete,

1860
01:52:39.131 --> 01:52:43.480
not giving a shit mode,
just going off.
You got to watch this.

1861
01:52:43.481 --> 01:52:48.230
He's absolutely fucking hilarious.
This guy is a true standup comedian.

1862
01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:51.680
Like I already loved him from the Ray Romano Shovel and I watched this clip.

1863
01:52:51.890 --> 01:52:55.520
This guy is the shit and I would definitely go see him to stand up.

1864
01:52:55.521 --> 01:52:58.370
This is what it takes to be a great comedian.

1865
01:52:58.371 --> 01:53:00.050
This guy completely doesn't give a fuck.

1866
01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:02.170
And there's a bunch of people evidently watching it cause he,

1867
01:53:02.171 --> 01:53:06.210
he jokes that all is Ray Romano money has gone saying he invested in,

1868
01:53:06.211 --> 01:53:09.740
into this comedy club.
Like he was on a hit series for fucking 10 years,

1869
01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:12.140
like 10 years of syndicated money.

1870
01:53:12.141 --> 01:53:15.560
That's how much it takes to open a fucking room in Vegas.
When you're in name,

1871
01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:20.570
he's clearly juggled,
but people know is he broke his,
he doing heroin.

1872
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:22.280
Heroin?
No.

1873
01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:27.600
What's great is he just at one point he's throwing chips at people who were in

1874
01:53:28.011 --> 01:53:30.530
Vegas.
He,
you go,
you'll white trash,
you know,

1875
01:53:30.531 --> 01:53:33.810
he doesn't call it it's fucking hill.
You got to see it.

1876
01:53:33.811 --> 01:53:38.120
So all of these are going to be on the [inaudible] podcast.com.
Um,

1877
01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:43.640
we put this one up last week,
but I forgot the hype it insane robot movie.

1878
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:46.640
You got to see this thing.
It's just a clip from a fucking great movie.

1879
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.650
And also the greatest wrestling clip I've ever seen in my life.
Nia.

1880
01:53:51.650 --> 01:53:53.440
She wants her five minutes of her life back.

1881
01:53:53.441 --> 01:53:55.220
He's just the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life.

1882
01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:59.600
The name of the video is the most illegal thing I've seen in wrestling history.

1883
01:53:59.810 --> 01:54:03.980
You have to watch it.
It's fucking awesome and quick.
Overrated,
underrated.

1884
01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:11.450
Overrated.
The black eyed peas,
uh,
the bill,
the black ips are terrible.

1885
01:54:11.690 --> 01:54:16.090
I'm pissed.
I watched that halftime,
uh,
bullshit at the Superbowl,

1886
01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:20.060
even on mute with the promise that it was going to be something I didn't want to

1887
01:54:20.061 --> 01:54:20.810
miss.

1888
01:54:20.810 --> 01:54:25.190
They suck and that noise they call music is the worst crap ever.

1889
01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:30.050
Um,
I walk out,
I never watched the halftime shows.
They're fucking horrific.

1890
01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:35.000
They were very different before Fergie showed up.
And I'll just leave it at that.

1891
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:40.160
Okay.
And if you know them,
you know that what I'm saying is true.

1892
01:54:40.670 --> 01:54:45.260
You're blaming the white girl.
Okay.
Is it racist,
racist,
a car sex,

1893
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:48.530
underrated is often unappreciated.
Lol.

1894
01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:53.620
There's nothing like pulling over on the side of a busy interstate and getting

1895
01:54:54.171 --> 01:54:58.760
it on what he says or stumbling out of a bar with some random chick you brought

1896
01:54:58.761 --> 01:55:03.060
a few drinks for and convinced to leave with you going to a car and not even,

1897
01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:06.470
not even making out of the parking lot.

1898
01:55:06.471 --> 01:55:11.300
It's just oh and bang and basically it's just plain awesome.
Uh,
I purchased,
let,

1899
01:55:11.301 --> 01:55:13.000
let it go and loved it.
Thank you.
Um,

1900
01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:17.360
I would say that sex in the car was way better back in the day when they had

1901
01:55:17.361 --> 01:55:21.410
bench seats and actually he made huge cars.
But,
uh,

1902
01:55:22.610 --> 01:55:26.750
I think it's,
I dunno,
you know,
I don't like the look.

1903
01:55:28.210 --> 01:55:32.780
I don't like the fucking look in your Goddamn I.
Okay.

1904
01:55:32.781 --> 01:55:35.120
And I'm not getting into her personal life,
but we don't get enough.

1905
01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:36.680
We don't have enough memories.

1906
01:55:37.710 --> 01:55:41.120
<v 12>[inaudible] yeah.</v>

1907
01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:44.633
<v 9>Wow.</v>

1908
01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:46.890
<v 11>Yeah.
The older cars are better because they have</v>

1909
01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:47.773
<v 9>more room.</v>

1910
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:54.290
Fucking gotta be kidding me.
You know what?

1911
01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:58.220
Why don't you get your trampy ass outta here.
Please meet you think I,

1912
01:55:58.221 --> 01:56:02.030
you think I didn't realize that when I met you.
Huh?
I think I didn't realize,

1913
01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:03.590
you know

1914
01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:06.740
<v 11>you've had a sex life before you got them.
Right.</v>

1915
01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:11.750
So what is the problem is when it took male whore meeting a female horn,

1916
01:56:11.950 --> 01:56:15.420
you were a man whore.
I was not.
No,
you are a man.

1917
01:56:15.421 --> 01:56:19.090
I was always the ladies.
Yeah.
Wow.
I wasn't looking at me.

1918
01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:21.700
I look like fucking howdy duty with a fucking Nah,

1919
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:25.440
but you got that whole little like sexy,
angry thing going on.

1920
01:56:25.441 --> 01:56:27.270
Women like this and yet,
you know what I don't like.

1921
01:56:27.271 --> 01:56:29.040
I don't like being pandering to them,

1922
01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:31.540
<v 9>do whatever the fuck he said.
Oh,
here's one last quick thing.</v>

1923
01:56:31.541 --> 01:56:35.780
I always say I'm gonna fucking ended.
I never do.
All right.
Corporations,
uh,

1924
01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:37.390
selling your information.
Hey Bill,

1925
01:56:37.391 --> 01:56:40.550
I did listen to your podcast for a while now and think,
ah,

1926
01:56:40.551 --> 01:56:43.090
they're very entertaining and funny.
I do have to admit however,

1927
01:56:43.091 --> 01:56:45.310
that every time I,
maybe I'd read this last week,
I can't remember,

1928
01:56:45.490 --> 01:56:48.820
but I'm just happy because I ended up being right here.
Uh,
I do have to admit,

1929
01:56:48.821 --> 01:56:49.181
however,

1930
01:56:49.181 --> 01:56:52.780
that every time you talk about the conspiracy theories and people tracking your

1931
01:56:52.781 --> 01:56:54.640
electronic purchases and whatnot,

1932
01:56:54.850 --> 01:56:58.870
I roll my eyes and wonder why you're so crazy.
However,

1933
01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:03.580
this is why I actually started reading better is I pause now and I look at the

1934
01:57:03.581 --> 01:57:06.850
next three words and it fucking works out now.
Lot of the king's speech.

1935
01:57:08.260 --> 01:57:09.370
Is that what that movie's about?

1936
01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:13.820
<v 11>Hi.
No,
yeah,
I'm not watching it.
It's good.
It's really,
really good.</v>

1937
01:57:13.821 --> 01:57:15.800
It looks like it took place in another time.

1938
01:57:15.801 --> 01:57:19.820
So that automatic place in another time.
It's a period piece about reading.

1939
01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:25.400
It's fucking horrific
cause that's what I was just talking about.

1940
01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:31.020
It's whatever.
What did you think about your time in that Fucking Ltd?
Um,

1941
01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:33.980
however,
recently.
Ah,

1942
01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:40.400
<v 9>that's one of my favorite cars.
You just ruined it.
You know what?</v>

1943
01:57:40.401 --> 01:57:43.160
I'm going to have to tell a fucking story that's going to ruin something for
you.

1944
01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:47.720
Let me think.
What are you into?
Going into the mall?

1945
01:57:48.620 --> 01:57:53.550
<v 11>Yes.
We'll tell him.
I got at the fucking whatever orange Julius stand.</v>

1946
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:55.360
No.
However,
recently

1947
01:57:55.710 --> 01:57:59.670
<v 9>browsing the Internet and started noticing ads on every page that directly</v>

1948
01:57:59.671 --> 01:58:03.180
related to something I had just purchased online.

1949
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:05.040
How fucked up is that?

1950
01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:09.690
Now I knew things like this happened and that site's kept certain information

1951
01:58:09.691 --> 01:58:13.920
about you,
but I guess since I never saw any visual evidence of this,

1952
01:58:13.921 --> 01:58:17.220
I simply put it in the back of my mind.
I never worried about it.
However,

1953
01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:21.270
now I had direct in your face evidence of being tracked.

1954
01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:25.950
I have to say I felt a bit violated.
Yeah,
it's weird.

1955
01:58:25.951 --> 01:58:30.150
Like somebody just sitting there watching what the fuck you're doing.
Um,
anyways,

1956
01:58:30.151 --> 01:58:34.080
he says to think that the ads were specifically being put up for me on every

1957
01:58:34.081 --> 01:58:38.310
website I went to struck me as a huge invasion of privacy and it was a bit

1958
01:58:38.311 --> 01:58:40.980
unnerving.
Um,
this was a week,

1959
01:58:41.050 --> 01:58:44.590
two ago and ever since then I've become a bit paranoid about the amount of

1960
01:58:44.591 --> 01:58:46.360
information that is out there about me.

1961
01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:49.210
I thought about all the Times I've entered my credit card information

1962
01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:53.650
information or home address online in order to make some purchases and went

1963
01:58:53.651 --> 01:58:57.220
through every website I could think of.
Jury set information,
dude,
it's over.

1964
01:58:57.580 --> 01:59:00.580
It's already up there.
Um,
I know once it's out there,

1965
01:59:00.581 --> 01:59:03.940
it's impossible to take back,
but I have to do what I can do.

1966
01:59:04.090 --> 01:59:07.510
I've changed my email address,
my old email address,

1967
01:59:07.810 --> 01:59:09.750
had my full name in it,
um,

1968
01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:14.410
started shredding everything with my address on it and started using cash only

1969
01:59:14.411 --> 01:59:18.280
to make purchases so that someone can't track it,
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1970
01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:20.380
Uh,
yeah,
I actually,

1971
01:59:20.381 --> 01:59:24.010
somebody sent me an email the other day update some four year old kid,

1972
01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:28.870
got a um,
got a,
uh,
what do,
what do you call it?

1973
01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:30.070
A credit card

1974
01:59:30.290 --> 01:59:32.840
<v 10>application application.
Yeah.
From American Express.</v>

1975
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:36.260
And why are we talking about how if you use Gmail,

1976
01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:40.340
if you're having an email conversation with somebody and you mentioned something

1977
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:43.100
like,
Oh yeah,
I'll meet you after I go to the spa.

1978
01:59:43.450 --> 01:59:46.420
And next thing you know there's all these ads for spa stuff.
Like someone's,
yeah,

1979
01:59:46.690 --> 01:59:48.620
it,
Google reads your email,

1980
01:59:48.621 --> 01:59:53.621
it picks up on key phrases and then just automatically pops up ads around it

1981
01:59:54.771 --> 01:59:57.480
that you could correlate to that email that you just,

1982
01:59:57.630 --> 01:59:59.540
for some reason you're looking at an email like,

1983
01:59:59.541 --> 02:00:03.800
like it's illegal for you to read my mail mail.
Right?
So the old school shit,

1984
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:08.230
right.
But somehow online they can just look at that because it's just,
no,

1985
02:00:08.450 --> 02:00:11.540
now this is what morons are gonna say,
Look Dude,
to me,
oh,

1986
02:00:11.541 --> 02:00:15.610
it's just a computer program is just picking up certain words

1987
02:00:15.770 --> 02:00:16.281
<v 9>like this.</v>

1988
02:00:16.281 --> 02:00:20.840
This is how you gradually work your way to having a microchip and your forehead

1989
02:00:20.841 --> 02:00:22.900
is they just incrementally,
yeah,

1990
02:00:23.150 --> 02:00:26.270
take away what they used to not be able to do.

1991
02:00:26.930 --> 02:00:31.930
And then what happens is people die off and then the new standard is where this

1992
02:00:32.061 --> 02:00:33.080
new generation was born.

1993
02:00:33.110 --> 02:00:38.110
It's like being taken off the gold standard where cash used to represent gold.

1994
02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:41.570
You brought your golden,
silver was heavy,

1995
02:00:41.690 --> 02:00:44.600
it was dangerous and it was a pain in the ass to carry around.

1996
02:00:44.601 --> 02:00:46.730
Some banks are like,
we'll bring the shit in the US,

1997
02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:50.810
we'll give you these pieces of paper cash that represent the gold.

1998
02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:54.320
You give his $20 in gold,
we'll give you a $20 bill.

1999
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:58.340
And anytime you want you can come back down and fucking,
you know,

2000
02:00:58.341 --> 02:01:02.420
get you $20 in gold.
And after a while we just kept using the piece of paper.

2001
02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:06.230
People forgot about the gold.
The fuckers who brought the golden died.

2002
02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:11.120
They took us off the gold standard.
Now you can't claim it.
What happened?

2003
02:01:11.121 --> 02:01:15.530
All that gold and silver,
those fucking can stick.
They kept it,
they kept a ship.

2004
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:19.520
So that's what I'm saying about all this other stuff is like all this stuff that

2005
02:01:19.521 --> 02:01:21.740
you used to not be able to do like this.

2006
02:01:21.741 --> 02:01:25.160
People being born now will not remember a time when people couldn't just,

2007
02:01:25.161 --> 02:01:25.431
you know,

2008
02:01:25.431 --> 02:01:29.390
when the government couldn't listen to and record every phone conversation you

2009
02:01:29.391 --> 02:01:32.330
ever fucking had.
And I don't know,
people get like,
I don't know.

2010
02:01:32.331 --> 02:01:33.840
This is the type of shit if you talk about it,

2011
02:01:33.841 --> 02:01:35.390
people think you're fucking paranoid.

2012
02:01:35.550 --> 02:01:39.060
<v 10>Well it's also like,
you know the stuff that you put on like Facebook,</v>

2013
02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:42.073
<v 11>I don't care.</v>

2014
02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:47.200
I'm just picturing you in a Goddamn car with your fucking hot ass feet up

2015
02:01:47.451 --> 02:01:50.150
against the fucking window.
All right.
This bill,

2016
02:01:50.151 --> 02:01:53.180
his podcasts is too God damn long at this point.
Wow.
Uh,

2017
02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:56.480
I already did like another 25 minutes other than this was like an hour and 15

2018
02:01:56.481 --> 02:01:58.580
minutes and cut off that part.
If you,
which part?

2019
02:01:58.740 --> 02:02:01.820
The part where we're talking about the stuff with the cars was probably be the

2020
02:02:01.821 --> 02:02:05.480
fucking best part of the podcast at this point.
Alright.

2021
02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:09.090
Sheath and I look,
I got you got,
you know,
that's what I'm here for.

2022
02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:12.410
It helps give and take.
Yeah.
Comedy.
Somebody's got to get hurt this week.

2023
02:02:12.411 --> 02:02:16.340
It was me right?
As the next time.
Is it going to be me?
No,

2024
02:02:16.341 --> 02:02:18.860
I wouldn't do that cause I got to fucking live with you.
Yeah.

2025
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:20.390
I got to live with you.
Well,
that's it.
Listen,

2026
02:02:20.630 --> 02:02:25.630
I have to rest up my voice because I'm singing a macho man in my fucking

2027
02:02:25.971 --> 02:02:28.850
underwear tomorrow and glee.
And that's it.

2028
02:02:28.851 --> 02:02:30.380
Thanks for listening to podcasts this week,

2029

2030
02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.620
on the podcast.
Keep reaching for the stars.
That's right.
That's right.

2031
02:02:39.621 --> 02:02:42.620
