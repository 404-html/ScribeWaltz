1
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:02.750
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.751 --> 00:00:07.310
It's bill burr and it is a time for a special edition of the Monday morning

3
00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:10.480
podcast.
You and all,
every once in a while,
um,

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.490
old freckles here goes out and gets himself a guest and today is no different,

5
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.030
which is why we have a special podcast for this weekend.
I can't think of a,

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.890
this is probably the biggest,
it's gotta be the biggest guest.

7
00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:26.300
I've had an absolute legend.
And usually when people say this shit,
they can't,

8
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.450
you know,
people you can't follow it.
But believe it or not,

9
00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:33.600
I have a from Aerosmith,
legendary lead guitars.

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.970
Joe Perry on the Monday morning podcast.
How are you buddy?
I'm really good.

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.850
Thanks.
Uh,
I don't know about the biggest part.
I mean,

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.070
most people say you look bigger.
I mean you'll look smaller in person,

13
00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:50.180
but uh,
don't you hate that it don't matter.
I mean,
you know,
it's all,

14
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:54.080
it's all about the camera,
England and all that stuff.
But uh,
thanks.

15
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.060
I appreciate that.
Then intro and do you get that a lot?
Be here today?
Oh,
sorry.

16
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.330
Do you get that a lot?
People say that to me,
like,
like,

17
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.610
I don't know why they think I was tall.
I'm average height,
I'm just under five,

18
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:07.220
10.
And then they always come walking up.
They're like,
oh,

19
00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:11.840
I thought you'd be a lot bigger.
It's just,
it's the way that the camera,

20
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.660
because usually a camera,
again,
technically,

21
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:17.420
I mean the carers kind of down at eye level because they want to get you

22
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:22.190
straight on and,
or sometimes they'll shoot you from a little below.

23
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:25.130
So it's really hard to tell,
um,

24
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.100
to get any kind of perspective,
you know what I mean?

25
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.960
Unless you know how tall the person is,

26
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:33.920
you're standing next to that kind of thing.
Um,
I get it with you.

27
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:35.480
It's like you're playing like,
you know,

28
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:39.630
the La Coliseum and you're on like a 40 foot stage.
I mean,

29
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.180
I'm standing in some chuckle hut.

30
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:45.770
It's just like maybe six inches taller than I am when I'm not on stage.
So,

31
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.080
um,
I don't know.
That's always like,

32
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.490
sometimes I just think people just say shit to say shit and like,
do you,

33
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.790
how do you deal with like,
you know,
what like amazes me about before it,
boy,

34
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.160
before we get going here,
uh,
the reason why Joe Perry is here,

35
00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:01.550
he's got a new unbelievable book,
uh,
Joe Barry Gi Joe Perry,

36
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:06.320
my life in and out of Aerosmith.
Uh,
that's available now in a form of,
um,

37
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.820
I'm not mistaken and already went number one,
correct?
Well,
I think it,

38
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.190
<v 1>it was numbered.
It was an,
it's in the top 10,
uh,</v>

39
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.880
was at the top 10,
uh,
uh,

40
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.340
New York Times bestseller list.
Uh,

41
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.660
it was in the top 10 for two weeks in.

42
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.210
<v 0>This is why your career has lasted for so long because you're this honest,</v>

43
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.110
most people would have just been like,
yeah,
man.
Yeah,
one all over the place.

44
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.300
But it's like anybody that,

45
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.550
<v 1>uh,
you know,
sees it.
But the thing is,</v>

46
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:39.070
it's all they say is top,

47
00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:41.800
top seller and they print out on the top.

48
00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:46.120
And that's kind of like the stamp that says that at least more than one person

49
00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:46.954
has read it.

50
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.020
<v 0>And,
uh,
the other thing is that I'm not here just because of the book.</v>

51
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.530
I'm here because you're,
you're a bud from way back.

52
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.200
And I've been looking forward to doing a podcast with you anyway.
Awesome.

53
00:02:59.201 --> 00:02:59.940
For a while.

54
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.840
<v 1>So it's a,
yeah,
it gives me a chance to Yak about the book,</v>

55
00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:06.380
but I also get a chance to have some laughs for change.

56
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.360
<v 0>She had a deal and I promise I'm going to try to steer away from the usual,</v>

57
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.300
you know,
so what Steven,
like what's a,

58
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.370
how do you pick out your leather pants or whatever all,

59
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:17.610
I might ask you that one because I don't think asked me anything

60
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.970
<v 1>and,
and I guarantee the,
the,
the,
uh,</v>

61
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.850
answers will be totally different than they've been from,

62
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.080
from before because a lot of it,
it's not so much the questions,

63
00:03:28.081 --> 00:03:30.150
it's how they're asked and who's asking them.

64
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.210
<v 0>Oh,
okay.
All right.
And I like that.
Well,
let me,</v>

65
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.250
here's one for you is what blows my mind nowadays with the whole Twitter thing.

66
00:03:37.371 --> 00:03:41.900
And Facebook and the whole interactive thing was back in the day.
Um,

67
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.840
there was no way for me to ever write you something that you would ever see,

68
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.470
I Guess Fan mail or something like that.

69
00:03:48.471 --> 00:03:52.670
Just the level of like interaction that people can have.
In fact,
like when I,

70
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.060
when I bought your first albums,
it was like,
uh,
maybe 80,

71
00:03:56.061 --> 00:03:59.320
81 or something like that.
So this was just before MTV,
right.

72
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.410
I didn't even know who was who because I turn over the album.
Sure.

73
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.540
Well I guess I got greatest sets first and they didn't have a picture of you

74
00:04:05.541 --> 00:04:07.490
guys put on when I got like toys in the attic or something,

75
00:04:07.491 --> 00:04:10.340
I remember I turned it over and I was trying to figure out which ones Steve,

76
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.900
which ones,
Joe,
you know,
who's Tommy and all that type of stuff.
Um,
what,

77
00:04:14.901 --> 00:04:19.250
how have you felt like having lived the old way before,
like pre,

78
00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:21.340
even like pre MTV,
but people didn't,
you know,
for them,

79
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.750
let's see what hardcore fans,
they had no idea what you look like.

80
00:04:23.751 --> 00:04:27.860
Seeing you be a little more anonymous if you walked down the street to like this

81
00:04:27.861 --> 00:04:31.880
whole thing now where people can be like,
uh,
no,
he's poke asshole.

82
00:04:31.881 --> 00:04:33.510
Why did you pick this picture?
You know,

83
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.650
just sitting there eating toast and you're fucking kitchen and how doesn't that

84
00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:42.590
doesn't annoy the shit.
I hate the fucking heckles when I'm at home.

85
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.720
<v 1>Well,</v>

86
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.270
it's interesting because you got one thing is you got to keep in mind that it's

87
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:52.640
a very small percentage of the people that are out there.
So,
you know,

88
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.630
a lot of times you can get sucked into the whole Twitter thing or Facebook or

89
00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:01.470
all that,
all the different different outlets that they are.

90
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.340
And you can go,
God,
I can't believe that people think that or,

91
00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:07.200
or how could they say that?
And it's like,

92
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.820
you got to remember that it's like maybe one of 1% that are actually like,

93
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.620
you know,
looking at it.
But,
uh,
uh,
well how long did the great scheme of things,

94
00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:20.520
you know,
but it's Kinda like,
uh,
uh,

95
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.840
it's a good thing and a bad thing.

96
00:05:21.841 --> 00:05:26.790
It gives people a voice and it's kind of like the look we've said before,
the,
uh,

97
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.480
it's like the town square and you're hanging out at the town squared.

98
00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:31.980
Anybody can say what they want.

99
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.190
Some people want us to end it on a soap box so they can be heard.

100
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.570
And very often they get carried away in a white,
uh,
in a white

101
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.120
<v 0>jacket.
But,
uh,
um,</v>

102
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.760
so for you to get to the zen place,

103
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.190
cause it's something that I kind of bad like most times of like,
ah,
whatever,

104
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.300
you know,
whatever the last eight one good,
what are they all going to be good?

105
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:52.631
But like,

106
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:57.370
just every once in a while somebody just writes something so mean that I get

107
00:05:57.371 --> 00:05:58.570
like an urge to like,

108
00:05:58.571 --> 00:06:02.530
I just wish there was an app where you could find out where they lived and just

109
00:06:02.531 --> 00:06:04.330
drive over and,
uh,
you know,
it's funny.

110
00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:07.900
I'd drive over and then lose a fight to them.
But you know,
in my fantasy I went,

111
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.393
yeah,
well,

112
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.930
<v 1>uh,
sometimes you have to do that to let off some steam,
but,
uh,
uh,</v>

113
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.440
not actually do it,
but just kind of go through the middle process.

114
00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:22.180
But the point is,
is that,
uh,
uh,
you read some of that stuff.

115
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.230
It could be so being spirited because they know that they're anonymous and it's

116
00:06:27.281 --> 00:06:31.710
like,
could have been drag,
but,
uh,
I don't know.
Lately it's been,
uh,

117
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.040
uh,
pretty positive.
Okay.
That's cool.

118
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.380
It kind of ebbed and,
uh,
you know,

119
00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:41.520
you've just kind of pay attention to the different woods every,

120
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.200
some people will listen to,

121
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.270
to like one particular thing or they'll kind of drop into at different phases

122
00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:54.100
and things like that.
So I dunno,
it's just,
just another outlet.
Uh,

123
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.390
but,
uh,

124
00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.390
but sometimes we do use it for a input where we talking about a subtlest the

125
00:07:01.151 --> 00:07:04.360
road,
well,
we're thinking about it.
What should we put in there?

126
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.480
It's sometimes somebody will will tweet a song,
we'll go,

127
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.080
I think we remember how to play that one.
We'll throw it in.

128
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:10.680
<v 0>Can I,</v>

129
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.070
can I put out a request course one that I've always wanted to see play live.

130
00:07:14.071 --> 00:07:18.000
It's off your first album.
Uh,
moving out.
Well let me write that down.

131
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.690
<v 1>We do play once in a while.
I played it,
I think the second,</v>

132
00:07:24.691 --> 00:07:29.250
the last show of the tour and we went right into walking the dog.

133
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.380
So it was kind of like,

134
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.470
<v 0>I think your first album is so underrated cause that if I remember correctly,</v>

135
00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:39.160
you basically,
uh,
you guys,
even after you sold that album,

136
00:07:39.161 --> 00:07:41.920
you hadn't gone national yet and it was Kinda like,
um,

137
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.920
you kind of got like New Hampshire,
Vermont,
Maine,

138
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.000
Massachusetts or New England and maybe Justin to Connecticut and New York.
Um,

139
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.440
<v 1>exactly.
And it was just,
it was really like a,
it was an uphill fight,</v>

140
00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:58.490
ma.
You know,
I mean it was,
uh,
you know,
people sick,
you know,

141
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.280
looking from the outside,
you know,
they're looking at the,

142
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:05.540
at the trade magazines that all of a sudden there's this band on the,

143
00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:10.520
on the charts and it seems like there overnight.
But you know,
you forget.
I mean,

144
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.210
it goes,
it's been,
it's been the same ever since the Beatles.

145
00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:18.290
I mean the Beatles spit years and years of those clubs in Hamburg,

146
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:23.360
sleeping in the bathroom,
working hard,
busting their ass.
And the same thing with,

147
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.280
with us.
I mean,
we worked the clubs and it kind of spread out.
It would,

148
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.740
you know,
we'd go through through,
uh,
Ohio and played,
you know,
all,

149
00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:37.250
all the tells in Ohio and make it our way to Detroit.

150
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.230
And Detroit,
of course,
their favorite beard was j Geils.

151
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:46.730
So they were willing to give another band from Boston illicit and we give us a

152
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:51.730
second chance,
you know.
And,
uh,
when we went out there,
they,
they really,
uh,

153
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.010
took us to heart.
And then,
uh,
I've coming back to Boston,
the,
uh,

154
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.350
<v 0>the first album,
uh,
was,
uh,
had,
had come and kind of gone,</v>

155
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.483
but,
uh,

156
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.960
the record company gave us another chance and we did the second record that they

157
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:10.240
were rereleased streamline and,
uh,

158
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.260
it started to get played on the radio that was back with Djs,

159
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:17.650
could actually play what they wanted.
You know,

160
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.390
you could actually go up there and talked to them,
play them something,

161
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:24.390
but if it was any good they would play it.
You know,
it was pretty cool.

162
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.170
That's amazing.
You know what,
I was just back,
uh,

163
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.560
back east doing Dennis and Cam's a comics come home,
you know,

164
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.830
and believe it or not,
it was the 20th,
the 20th anniversary of that show.

165
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.760
And I remember times I did it,
you came out and played with the band,

166
00:09:38.761 --> 00:09:41.010
which was awesome.
And um,

167
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.980
I'd say one thing that strikes me is every time I go back to Boston,

168
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:45.270
because I moved away in [inaudible] 95,

169
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:49.010
it becomes less and less like what I left and I'm going to be,
oh,

170
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.260
I'm going to get a greasy slice of pizza here.
And then it's gone.
And I'm just,

171
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.370
I'm finding it,

172
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:58.371
all these areas that used to be scary are getting like nicer and nicer.

173
00:09:58.411 --> 00:09:59.730
And I remember you,

174
00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.120
what always kills me was when they talk about when you guys were struggling,

175
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.740
they were like,
yeah,
we were all struggling.

176
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:08.790
We were all living in this beat up apartment on Commonwealth Avenue,

177
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.690
which is like Park Avenue now,
uh,
in,
in,
in,
uh,

178
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.380
in downtown Boston.
And I was wondering,
do you,
do you miss like when you go back,

179
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:20.700
go through Boston?
I don't know how often you get to go back there.
Do you,
um,

180
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.350
do you like the direction it went with the whole big dig and well turn in

181
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:29.730
Southie into like a bunch of condos and crap?
Certainly the big dig was,
uh,

182
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:34.170
was it event in everyone's life who lives in Boston?
But uh,
I mean it was,

183
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.250
there's no doubt it will just make one fucking lane.

184
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.870
They turned everything.
They was like,
it was a complete waste of time.
Oh.

185
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:45.450
And the other than aesthetically I'm fucking,
you know,

186
00:10:45.451 --> 00:10:48.150
I was driving to the airport is I went to the airport,
you know,

187
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:52.880
I tried to take the Ted Williams title,
so I get off.
I have a 7:00 AM flights,

188
00:10:52.881 --> 00:10:57.770
like quarter to five in the morning.
And so I get off the Ted Williams,
um,

189
00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.970
exit and then it get to the fork in the road.

190
00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:02.490
We make a left to do it and there's all these fucking cones set up.

191
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.670
So then I have to go by that.
And the Callahan tunnel flipping the fuck out,

192
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.520
curse in Boston,
up and down for the,
the,
the fucking state work on meathead.

193
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.660
And I don't even think that they did it by accident.

194
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.110
I literally think that they do it on purpose and then you fucking go through all

195
00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:19.860
of the bullshit.
And once again,
it's one lane to get to the airport.

196
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:22.530
So it was like,
what was the purpose of all of that?
You know,

197
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.610
it's like go figure.
I mean there's,
there's,

198
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.750
it's all about progress under the name of progress.
I mean,

199
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:34.740
that's what this whole country's built on in growth and all that.

200
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:38.010
And I mean,
I think that things have to change there.

201
00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:40.150
I don't want to add or want to get into that right now,
but,

202
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.740
but the bottom line is you're going to run for office.
So I just,

203
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.060
I haven't been home that much or been out here,
you know,

204
00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:50.690
from the time we were working on the,
uh,
the,

205
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.240
the last Aerosmith record and then going on the road

206
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.210
<v 1>and there's a couple of back and finish the record and they'd go down the road</v>

207
00:11:57.211 --> 00:11:59.580
again.
And then working on the book all through that.

208
00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.670
We've been spending all my time here and,
uh,
uh,
no,
no,

209
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.530
you sound like you caught a cold a little bit,
Andy.
Well,
the allergies here,

210
00:12:07.531 --> 00:12:12.390
it's like,
it's really wet.
You know,
it's back here.
They've got,
he's got,
uh,

211
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.970
it's beautiful.
I mean he's got like fountains everywhere and uh,

212
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.000
it's just beautiful.
But,
um,

213
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:22.770
but the allergies Getcha and I was just reading an article in one of the,

214
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.050
like the Huffington posts and one of those,

215
00:12:25.051 --> 00:12:29.520
one of those things and they were saying how that,
that people's,
uh,

216
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.450
people's allergies are not allergies but there,
their whole nasal thing was,

217
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.220
was like starting to like react to the,

218
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.520
a lot of the differences because they travel so much and,

219
00:12:41.521 --> 00:12:46.160
and there are so many different things that affect people and so they're there.

220
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.310
They're no,
you're wondering why your nose is Jeffords.
It's why.

221
00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.350
Because if your nose is working overtime,

222
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.850
it's got nothing to do with anything from south of the border,
you know,

223
00:12:56.851 --> 00:13:01.140
or anything like that.
It's just strictly your,
your body reacting to,
uh,

224
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.950
to the,
uh,
to the different stuff in the year.
Whether its pollen,

225
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.450
I mean I know in Massachusetts does that time of the year where all the pine

226
00:13:09.451 --> 00:13:12.670
pollen comes down and covers your car green and all that,

227
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.100
<v 0>get sick then to ah,
I'll get like,
it's terrible.
It's kind of dragging nuts.</v>

228
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.360
It's terrible.
It's like a,
how do you handle that?
If you have like a show,

229
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.440
if you're doing a Joe Perry thing,
Joe Perry project where you have to sing,
well,

230
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.590
<v 1>a little bit of that spray,
you know,
that,
uh,</v>

231
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:33.180
you know that you get at the drugstore and it works as long as you don't use too

232
00:13:33.181 --> 00:13:38.150
much of it,
you know,
but it works and it's uh,
and uh,
then you get through it.

233
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.330
<v 0>That's shit never works for me.</v>

234
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.250
Somebody gave me that the other damn doing a cartoon.
Um,
oh,
we got to get ya.
Uh,

235
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.030
like we have music and stuff in between your projects.
Yeah,

236
00:13:48.031 --> 00:13:50.520
we're kind of doing this thing,
it takes place in like the 70s.

237
00:13:50.521 --> 00:13:53.520
I can't give too much of a way.
It's not coming out for like another year.
But,
uh,

238
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.630
you know,
we're,
we're,
we're,

239
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.350
we're doing some stuff of period stuff from the 70s.

240
00:14:01.351 --> 00:14:04.590
I can remember when plant and paid used to do that call and response thing on

241
00:14:04.591 --> 00:14:06.770
the guitar and he'd be,
like I said,

242
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.680
we kind of got some people listening to music like that.
And,
um,

243
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.940
I,
as I was driving over here today,
I was like,
Jesus Christ,
you know,
I mean,

244
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.980
I should've got yin on the fucking thing.
We're having somebody,
yeah.

245
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.310
Try to put together like a song for us or whatever,
but,
uh,

246
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.690
I love to have you come in,
maybe even do a voice or something like that.

247
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.030
<v 1>That's one of the good things about,
uh,
but all this technology is,</v>

248
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:32.020
you don't have to be in the same room at the same time.
You know?
I mean,

249
00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:34.830
certainly there's a advantage to that,
but you know,
if,

250
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.640
if you can't be there physically,

251
00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:41.530
you can certainly send the files and you can work on it and talk on the phone.

252
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.560
I mean,
I just stood,
uh,
um,

253
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.730
it over an overdub one would a Johnny Winters songs,
uh,

254
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.270
God rest his soul.
Uh,
and uh,
you know,
he called me up and said,

255
00:14:54.271 --> 00:14:58.290
do you want to play the record?
You had great.
And,
uh,
they sent me the files,

256
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.370
I played on it.
And,
uh,

257
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:05.440
<v 0>right.
Yeah.
Well here there's a studio writing store.</v>

258
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:10.210
So,
uh,
we wanted him,
as you noticed,
I'm not too good with technology.

259
00:15:10.211 --> 00:15:13.960
I got to tell my listeners the embarrassing beginning to my podcast.

260
00:15:13.961 --> 00:15:16.180
I was in a rush to get over here,
freaking out.

261
00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:19.560
Joe Perry from Aerosmith and I show up.
I got two microphones,

262
00:15:19.561 --> 00:15:20.141
I've got everything,

263
00:15:20.141 --> 00:15:25.060
but I only have one mic cord and Rockstar Joe Perry goes,

264
00:15:25.061 --> 00:15:27.240
I'll go next door and get one.
Like he's getting out.

265
00:15:27.241 --> 00:15:30.130
Like he has all cool neighbors.
So like he's like,

266
00:15:30.131 --> 00:15:34.060
I'd go over and get a cup of sugar.
He goes over and gets up microphone cord

267
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.050
<v 1>and Teresa Hagar roles with kind of musical people,</v>

268
00:15:41.051 --> 00:15:44.710
but also that we stay at the hotel,
the sunset marquee,

269
00:15:44.711 --> 00:15:45.730
I don't know where you stand,

270
00:15:45.731 --> 00:15:50.110
but they have a studio downstairs and that's the only hotel I know of in the

271
00:15:50.111 --> 00:15:54.430
world where you can call room service and get a microphone at two in the
morning.

272
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.500
Is that right?
If you're like a,
I mean,
I've done a lot of,
uh,
of writing.

273
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.510
In fact,
there's a picture of me,
uh,
in,
in the,
in the room,
uh,

274
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.710
working on one of the songs for the record.
And,
uh,
you know,

275
00:16:08.711 --> 00:16:13.520
and we just set up with the,
with the computer and the,
some,
some outboard gear,

276
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.240
some microphones.
And,
uh,
let me sit in there and,

277
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.980
and I actually wrote the song there and some of the tracks actually made it on

278
00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:24.670
the record,
but,
you know,
we're just sitting in the living room,
you know,
and it's,

279
00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:28.290
uh,
and I needed a mic cord and I called down.
They had it there.
And

280
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.720
<v 0>do you find that that new technology makes you a more creative or is it like,</v>

281
00:16:33.821 --> 00:16:36.490
you know,
sometimes there's people out here,
whether even if they like,
right,

282
00:16:36.491 --> 00:16:37.540
they're sitting there going like,
well,

283
00:16:37.541 --> 00:16:40.480
I got to at least have an office where I go to sit down and write because if I

284
00:16:40.481 --> 00:16:44.410
don't,
I'm sitting here,
the TV's here,
the kitchen's here.
I'm not going to create,

285
00:16:44.411 --> 00:16:47.320
defined,
uh,
the new technology where wherever you go,

286
00:16:47.321 --> 00:16:50.860
there's a studio makes you procrastinate more,
or do you work Mark Moore?

287
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.400
<v 1>Definitely a lot more.
Uh,
a lot,</v>

288
00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.220
it takes a lot more,
uh,
get up and go to,

289
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:04.210
to do it because there are so many more distractions is there's no doubt about

290
00:17:04.211 --> 00:17:07.840
it.
Everything from,
you know,
a thousand channels on TV to,

291
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.690
to whatever you're into.
I mean,

292
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:14.740
football 24 hours a day,
I mean,
whatever,

293
00:17:14.741 --> 00:17:18.670
there's so many things that,
you know,
it's an advantage because you can,

294
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.780
you can choose.
But on the other head it's like,
uh,

295
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.980
to be able to record it in your own house can be like the worst thing.

296
00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:30.430
And the best thing,
I mean,
you can always say,
well,

297
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.670
I can put it off till tomorrow because you don't,
you know,

298
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:37.630
you haven't booked time in a studio where they're going to charge you $1,500 a

299
00:17:37.631 --> 00:17:38.380
day,

300
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:43.380
whereas you've already put a deposit down on a studio and so you have to go.

301
00:17:43.571 --> 00:17:47.980
So there's kind of like a,
there's that end of it.
And then there's also,

302
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:52.430
but it really has to from,
from inside and you have to really want to do it.
And,

303
00:17:52.431 --> 00:17:56.690
uh,
I mean,
you know,
you're,
you're,
I mean,

304
00:17:56.691 --> 00:17:57.740
you're a creative guy.

305
00:17:57.741 --> 00:18:01.700
You see things in a different way that us,

306
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:07.250
you see,
you see the humor and stuff,
uh,
and you know,

307
00:18:07.251 --> 00:18:11.150
stuff that we would never occur the rest of us.
But that's why you make us laugh.

308
00:18:11.151 --> 00:18:14.230
And the thing is,
it's,
that's,
that's an art.
And

309
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:15.271
<v 0>let me ask you this.</v>

310
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:18.930
You said that that sunset marquee is the only hotel that you know that you can

311
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:23.220
order a microphone.
Uh,
what's the craziest thing you ever ordered?

312
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.360
Room service.
You're on the road,
you're in the middle of nowhere.

313
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.020
It wasn't so much the craziest thing.
It was the quantity.

314
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.830
Are we talking grams here?
What,

315
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:39.230
what did you order well enough for say 30 people?
Uh,

316
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.703
and what is it,

317
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.620
<v 1>dawn,
dawn and yard,
uh,
by the case,
uh,</v>

318
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.430
I was,
I could rub a stay at,
at the,
uh,
uh,

319
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.440
Beverly Hills hotel in the 70s,

320
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:58.330
and it was kind of like the,
uh,
party central,

321
00:18:58.331 --> 00:19:00.580
cause they have bungalows out,
back,
you know,
like

322
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:06.630
<v 0>everything can be cured as far as STDs go and all that.
I mean,</v>

323
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.200
do you have a missed,
like I look at some of the 70s,
right?

324
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.000
And I just really wish,

325
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.390
I mean of course it's all been romanticized in books and movies and all that

326
00:19:15.391 --> 00:19:19.950
shit,
but do you like aside,
everybody likes being younger.
Do you miss those days?

327
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:24.300
Like thinking about like just the how a lot freer and crazy you could be without

328
00:19:24.301 --> 00:19:26.310
worrying about somebody with a cell phone camera.

329
00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:28.770
I'm talking about single Joe Perry.

330
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.400
I got this drinking and drugging thing under control.
Like you just,

331
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:35.220
you just having a good time.
You playing with your band,

332
00:19:35.221 --> 00:19:37.970
you're selling records and all that is a part of you that you have or just you

333
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:42.210
ever like when you're driving down sunset and just looking at spots going like,

334
00:19:42.211 --> 00:19:47.211
dude I fucking bought a kilo of coke there and had one of the best hot dogs I

335
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:50.270
ever had in my life hanging with John Bonham or something.
Do you like,

336
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.420
do have memories like that still come?
Yeah,
I mean

337
00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:54.330
<v 1>no doubt.</v>

338
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.950
I mean especially here in Manila and there are a couple of places that are
still,

339
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.250
you know,
the same buildings,
so have have changed the names.

340
00:20:02.251 --> 00:20:06.390
But I mean this is a whiskey or Gogo and there's book soup which has been there

341
00:20:06.391 --> 00:20:10.560
forever,
which is the greatest book.
Stores go next,
uh,

342
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:15.450
uh,
city lights up in Frisco and there's what Paris,

343
00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:17.110
it's really good but,
but you know,
there,

344
00:20:17.111 --> 00:20:20.580
there are these certain places that are still there and you know,

345
00:20:20.581 --> 00:20:23.890
the rainbow and,
and the Roxy and uh,

346
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.960
<v 0>some of the people you remember seeing in the rent just because fans are like,</v>

347
00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:32.040
like nerds.
It's like you just want to go to the same place that they stood in.

348
00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.730
<v 1>Chances are if,
if there,
if,
if they were playing in town,</v>

349
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:37.990
uh,

350
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:42.310
you could almost guaranteed to be to see whoever was playing.

351
00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:46.200
And then the rest of the time,
you know,
a lot of people would just,

352
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.460
if they were the middle of,
of a tour,
they had a couple of days off,

353
00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.460
they would definitely come to la to hang out.

354
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:56.270
Cause it was such a great scene here,
you know,
back then and,
uh,

355
00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.360
you could literally like rodents,
heady buddy.

356
00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:02.840
<v 0>What's the craziest thing you ever saw go down at like the rainbow room or the</v>

357
00:21:02.841 --> 00:21:07.140
whiskey or whatever?
Like the most,
I only hung out there a few times,
uh,

358
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.910
because you don't have to name any of them trying to get you in trouble.
But,
uh,

359
00:21:10.911 --> 00:21:11.780
I just,
uh,

360
00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.390
<v 1>it was just a couple of times I've been there,
you know,</v>

361
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.870
it'd be actually probably a lot more than I remember,
but,
uh,
yeah,

362
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.880
<v 0>it's probably a lot more than than I,
than I would forget.</v>

363
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.480
And you're the central person in the story.
You just don't remember the story.

364
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:29.950
What's Joe Perry.

365
00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:34.640
<v 1>But,
uh,
you know,
it was basically a kind of a meeting place for everybody.</v>

366
00:21:34.641 --> 00:21:36.950
They would come down from the hills,
you know,

367
00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.180
run into whoever and then the tables would empty out and as people would take

368
00:21:41.181 --> 00:21:44.960
off,
it was that kind of a place.
But,
uh,
uh,

369
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:50.060
I haven't been up there since,
uh,
Jesus in forever,
so,

370
00:21:50.061 --> 00:21:50.360
uh,

371
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.440
<v 0>well I can guarantee to you,</v>

372
00:21:51.441 --> 00:21:55.070
I don't think they've changed anything when you walk in that all of the covers

373
00:21:55.071 --> 00:21:57.710
on the seat and everything just looked like they'd been there since the

374
00:21:57.711 --> 00:21:58.510
beginning of time.

375
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.240
<v 1>I would bet.
I would bet.
Uh,</v>

376
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.150
and the whiskey is pretty much the same as I remember.

377
00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:09.220
We played there our first time here in La and then we played there not too long

378
00:22:10.411 --> 00:22:14.310
ago and it was pretty much the same,
was a great vibe.
You know,

379
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.520
it was kind of like,
uh,
the paradise,

380
00:22:17.521 --> 00:22:19.890
I don't even know if they changed the paradise at all.

381
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.330
<v 0>And Boston.
Yeah.
Do it.
The paradise has been gone for I think almost 20 years.</v>

382
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.240
I guess it changed,
but uh,

383
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.830
it's probably like clubs still or is it a real,

384
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:36.050
you want to be one of those fucking Panera bread.
Yeah.

385
00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.860
Things and you just thinking.
Yeah,
you too.

386
00:22:37.861 --> 00:22:41.130
And the police started here or there for some of their first gigs,

387
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.620
I guess seen United States.
We're here.
You know,

388
00:22:43.621 --> 00:22:47.810
I just realized as I'm sitting in here,
you probably,
and I can't imagine him,

389
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.160
I think the amount of times you've sat in a room,

390
00:22:50.161 --> 00:22:53.810
whether it was just a suit of armor over in the corner.
Yeah.

391
00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.330
Like some Scooby Doo shit seems like some real like rock star stuff.

392
00:22:57.331 --> 00:23:00.540
Like you've got to have,
you just got to have a suit of armor.
Narya right.

393
00:23:00.541 --> 00:23:04.710
That helps you be creative process.
It came with the place.
Oh,
it did it out.
Odd

394
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.460
<v 1>me enough.</v>

395
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:10.460
I did have one in my house in La in the 70s I had,

396
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.920
I had a suit of armor at the door.
And uh,
where do you,
where do you buy them?

397
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.150
Well,
you have to buy a castle while it's not a real one,
obviously I read,

398
00:23:19.151 --> 00:23:23.740
it's not like,
uh,
like,
uh,
I mean you can tell it's just,

399
00:23:23.741 --> 00:23:27.820
it's like a mock up of one,
but it still looks really cool.
And uh,

400
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.120
how do you know it's not real?
Because there's no,
because marks on,

401
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.990
if you look at it where the screws hold it,
hold it together,

402
00:23:34.991 --> 00:23:38.710
they could have like didn't cut off the edge.
So if you were to put it on,

403
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.630
you'd kind of look like a,
you just got attacked by about,
uh,
uh,

404
00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.650
about a hundred.
Uh,

405
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:48.790
mosquitoes are wasps or whatever because all those little,

406
00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:52.630
those nails would be sticking in you.
Like if you took the helmet off,

407
00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:56.340
could see like,
like the rivet sticking out.
So it's really been made to,

408
00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.520
<v 0>Oh,
I just looked at it,
but I didn't see any scuff marks on it.</v>

409
00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:03.660
I just figured that was like the king son now who never had to go to battle

410
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.660
buddy parade down the street.
And the fucking sense

411
00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.630
<v 1>observation because it's probably true,</v>

412
00:24:07.631 --> 00:24:12.550
but it would be just probably copied off of,
uh,
off of,
uh,
of a real one.
But,
uh,

413
00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:16.800
there are places you can get things like that.
Uh,
you see it all wouldn't,

414
00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:21.760
you know,
odd piece of that in the quarter.
Some,
some,
uh,
you know,

415
00:24:21.761 --> 00:24:24.730
a home and garden place or whatever.
And you know,

416
00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.880
I guess that's where they come from,
you know,

417
00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:33.040
<v 0>but I saw you guys at Jones beach in like a 2006.
You have awesome,</v>

418
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.630
awesome show as always.

419
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:39.930
And I'm Motley Crue was opening for you guys growing their tour and they're,
uh,

420
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.811
recently they're there.

421
00:24:40.811 --> 00:24:43.720
I think this is going to be there if their final tour and all of that.

422
00:24:43.721 --> 00:24:47.710
Do you remember the,
um,
because I'm a huge,
you know,
being a drama Geek,

423
00:24:47.711 --> 00:24:51.790
I'm a huge fan of Tommy Lee.
He was just like,
you know,
just the,
the,

424
00:24:51.791 --> 00:24:55.090
the show that that guy puts on while also playing a beat.
It's just amazing.

425
00:24:55.091 --> 00:24:57.190
I've always loved them.
And now I was wanting,

426
00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.690
do you remember the first time you guys,
uh,
did you talk with them during their,

427
00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.670
their,
when they were just young guys coming up?
Actually

428
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.710
<v 1>I saw the,</v>

429
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:09.710
what are their first gigs at the Santa Monica Civic Center when I was with the

430
00:25:10.531 --> 00:25:14.970
project.
I was out here doing some gigs in and uh,

431
00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.730
<v 0>just for the fans.
Was this the first time Steven left during that period?</v>

432
00:25:19.731 --> 00:25:20.650
Was this like early cause of it?

433
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:25.050
<v 1>No,
no,
this was stirred.
This was when I left in 1979 and I had the,</v>

434
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.710
I was out here with the project,
uh,
at,

435
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:34.710
at some point,
I'm not exactly sure when,
uh,
but the bottom line is,

436
00:25:34.711 --> 00:25:38.680
is I got to see them play,
you know,
at,
uh,
at the,
uh,

437
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.850
Santa Monica Civic Center,
which I don't know,
three,
5,000 seats.

438
00:25:42.851 --> 00:25:46.990
And the buzz was out out of,
so the place was pretty packed in.

439
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:50.130
<v 0>Got You there.
You just,
you just heard a good buzz of autumn.
You're like,</v>

440
00:25:50.131 --> 00:25:51.750
I'm going to go check these guys out.
Yeah.

441
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.310
<v 1>And,
uh,
they said,
well,
somebody said these,
these are the,
the,</v>

442
00:25:55.730 --> 00:26:00.350
this is the new hot band on,
on the Strip and should check them out.

443
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:05.270
So I went down and,
uh,
I'm not sure if I,
if I've met him then,
but there were,

444
00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.580
uh,
we had a couple of friends in common and I remember meeting,
uh,

445
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.750
uh,
uh,
Nikki Sixx and,
uh,

446
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.860
and just kind of like,
you know,
being kind of friends with them,
you know,

447
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.820
from kind of watching their career.
And then,
then,
uh,

448
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:26.900
we were in Vancouver doing,
I think it was,
uh,
uh,

449
00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.320
the second record,
not,
not,
uh,
not prudent vacation,

450
00:26:30.321 --> 00:26:35.060
but I think it was the next one,
uh,
uh,
pump,
I think.
And,
uh,

451
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.660
and there are two studios in that,
in that place,

452
00:26:38.661 --> 00:26:41.780
a little mountain up there in Vancouver,
and they were in the other studio.

453
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.210
And so we read it to each other a lot.

454
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:47.780
<v 0>Oh,
wow.
So they probably doing that,
Dr feelgood right around that.
If that was 89,</v>

455
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:48.643
nine,

456
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:53.200
<v 1>that's right.
There were,
uh,
was,
uh,
uh,
let's see,
uh,</v>

457
00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:59.140
uh,
Mr Rock,
the,
uh,
the producer,
so,

458
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.630
uh,
producer the record I think,
and,
uh,
Bobby Rock,
right?
Uh,
yeah,

459
00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.260
that's it.
And he was,
and they were,
they were,

460
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.540
they sounded great.
And,
uh,
uh,
they,
they,
it was,
you know,

461
00:27:13.541 --> 00:27:18.250
we rented to them pretty much daily and they,
uh,
and of course,
some of the guys,

462
00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.940
you know,
would,
uh,
they would tag,
you have to,
after the session,

463
00:27:21.941 --> 00:27:26.410
they would tag along and go down to the,
to the clubs.
You know,

464
00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:31.820
Vancouver reputably is probably has the best,
uh,

465
00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.420
from what I've heard has some of the best stories.

466
00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:38.530
<v 0>Right,
right.
You're like,
yeah,
I'm the headline.</v>

467
00:27:38.531 --> 00:27:42.280
I'll give you youngsters a ride down there.
They do everybody by the first day,

468
00:27:42.281 --> 00:27:45.340
by the time,
is that hard to be around guys like that?

469
00:27:45.341 --> 00:27:47.980
Because I know by then you'd,
you'd long since cleaned up and everything.

470
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.140
You had your fun basically at that point?

471
00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:55.110
<v 1>Not at all.
I mean,
it was not a,
not an issue.
I mean,
there were,
uh,
uh,
they were,</v>

472
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.640
and they,
you know what they,
uh,
uh,
uh,
you know,

473
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.690
they would party like late at night after they were done,
but when they,

474
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.720
when they came into the studio with the afternoon,
they were all business,

475
00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:10.650
<v 0>you know,
meth as far as people like</v>

476
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.370
<v 1>did with a bottle of Jack Daniels and something.
Yeah.
Who,
let's go,
it's like,</v>

477
00:28:15.371 --> 00:28:18.520
you know,
they had work to do with,
uh,
you know,

478
00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.400
it shows because it was a great record.

479
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:25.560
<v 0>Hey,
did you ever call anybody out for doing the ice tea in the,
in the,
uh,</v>

480
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:29.630
in the Jack Daniels bottle?
You know the couple,
I've heard a couple bands,

481
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.690
they would put ice tea in the Jack Daniels bottle and then they'd go out in

482
00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:36.570
front of the crowd and act like they were crazy and they'd just be chucking ice

483
00:28:36.571 --> 00:28:40.230
tea.
I heard about that,
but I've never,
he never busted anybody doing that

484
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.800
<v 1>red and teddy buddy that did it.
But I heard stories about bids to win that.</v>

485
00:28:45.801 --> 00:28:48.080
But uh,
uh,
you know,

486
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.930
they don't rate very high on my respect.

487
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.100
<v 0>That'd be like a prop act with the comedian and drink it.</v>

488
00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:58.320
You might as well drink it.
You know what I need and what's the,

489
00:28:58.321 --> 00:29:01.920
what's the problem if you don't,
well,
I don't care how the big giveaways,

490
00:29:01.921 --> 00:29:04.110
I don't give,
I don't care how much you've drank.

491
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:09.330
Nobody can chug hard alcohol.
You just can't do it.
You can fit.

492
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:14.280
Like I,
I've seen guys take big Gulps,
but once you start throwing the thing back,

493
00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.250
like Joe Green in that famous commercial,

494
00:29:17.251 --> 00:29:20.160
when he's drinking coca cola and even he had a couple of times on a couple of

495
00:29:20.161 --> 00:29:21.990
takes,
the stop and Belcher,
whatever.

496
00:29:21.991 --> 00:29:24.330
There's no way you could do with hard alcohol.
But before,

497
00:29:24.331 --> 00:29:25.830
before we go any further,
I wanted to ask you,

498
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:30.510
you got a really cool tattoo on your forearm there of a second old school gun.

499
00:29:30.511 --> 00:29:32.400
What's,
what's a story behind that?

500
00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:37.550
<v 1>Smith and Wesson,
uh,
break top fueled,
uh,</v>

501
00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:41.750
I guess it was designed back in the 18 hundreds.
Oh yeah.

502
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:46.760
Uh,
I just liked the shape of it.
It's one of my favorite,

503
00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.660
favorite design.
It's an old revolver and a,

504
00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:52.670
<v 0>you know,
this is a place in New Orleans.</v>

505
00:29:52.671 --> 00:29:55.250
I didn't had an acting gig down there and uh,

506
00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:59.990
somewhere in the French quarter they had all these old guns and rifles.

507
00:29:59.991 --> 00:30:03.850
You ever been in that spot?
Drunk way too,
which muddy the place.

508
00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:08.810
I wanted to buy my dad this,
this,
it was a rifle from like the,
from 18,
12.

509
00:30:08.811 --> 00:30:09.621
Right.
It was insane.

510
00:30:09.621 --> 00:30:12.650
And they even had the ban that and everything and my dad likes that type of
shit.

511
00:30:12.651 --> 00:30:17.651
But the thing was for me to get it from Louisiana all the way up,

512
00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.511
like first of all,

513
00:30:20.511 --> 00:30:23.870
I couldn't get it shipped because Massachusetts has some sort of laws.

514
00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.320
So then I'd have to,
would have had to buy it and then drive it up there.
And as,

515
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.080
as I was crossing state borders,

516
00:30:30.081 --> 00:30:34.250
I just kept thinking about Tommy Chong when he sent the bongs out and shit.

517
00:30:34.251 --> 00:30:37.430
And all of a sudden he had the feds at his door and you know,

518
00:30:37.431 --> 00:30:38.930
who the fuck is going to drive from New Orleans,

519
00:30:38.931 --> 00:30:41.690
Ella to Massachusetts and drive 55.
It's not going to be me.

520
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:45.560
I'm going to drive 80 at some point and be like,
I'm fine.
It's,
it's tough.

521
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:47.870
I think that they must get hanging out the back,

522
00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:52.550
<v 1>you know,
again,
without getting into the politics of things.
I mean,
uh,</v>

523
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.680
I just think that the,
uh,
the things should be a little more,

524
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.860
things should be a little more standardized as far as firearms go.

525
00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:04.390
I think they should be,
uh,
I mean people should be given at least,

526
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.160
uh,
you know,

527
00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:11.530
put through more schooling before they're given a permit.

528
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.550
And it should be more standardized from state to state because there are some

529
00:31:15.551 --> 00:31:16.384
states where it's,

530
00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:20.740
it's easier to get firearms and there are other states where it's really hard.

531
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.480
<v 0>It's hard to keep track of it,
you know what I mean?</v>

532
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.070
It's insane how in some states you can basically just go in and buy it and not

533
00:31:30.071 --> 00:31:32.230
have to prove any sort of capability.
I mean,

534
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.380
it'd be like given like somebody doesn't know how to drive keys to a car,

535
00:31:35.381 --> 00:31:39.490
it's like they're going to kill somebody.
Um,
but I,
I honestly,

536
00:31:39.491 --> 00:31:41.350
I don't have a problem with guns.

537
00:31:41.351 --> 00:31:44.050
I think they are cool as long as the right person owns it,

538
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:47.240
which is the bigger course fly in the ointment.
But,
uh,
what are some of your,
you,

539
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.440
you like the gun,
you just mentioned there.
What is some of your,
uh,

540
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:54.190
you go to guns like right in some of the modern stuff?
What do you like?

541
00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:59.030
<v 1>Well,
I'm not really,
uh,
I mean I have a few modern it,
modern</v>

542
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:04.100
firearms.
I collect all kinds of weapons.
I even got,
uh,

543
00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:09.140
an old Greek sword.
Uh,
that's,
uh,
being out of broads.
It's all like,

544
00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.680
it's green and it's,
it's actually quite small.
So I'll see.

545
00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.140
You guys are very small,
you know,
I mean,
there were people were smaller than,

546
00:32:18.141 --> 00:32:23.000
you know.
And,
uh,
so everything is like,
seems a little smaller.

547
00:32:23.001 --> 00:32:25.540
But anyway,
uh,
uh,

548
00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.050
<v 0>if somebody broke into your house,</v>

549
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.530
you can't tell me if that coming up the stairs.
Right.

550
00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.490
And the only weapon you see is that old Greek Sword Party's got to be like,
God,

551
00:32:34.491 --> 00:32:36.110
that cost me a fortune.
Well,

552
00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.820
what they really want to run this guy through with it

553
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.080
<v 1>within are going to be,
is focusing</v>

554
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.670
<v 0>on that while I walk up behind them with my shotgun.
Are you,</v>

555
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:48.050
you're a shotgun inside guy?
Well,
I do have,
uh,
you know,
I mean it,
the,

556
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.280
they're reliable.
They're,
uh,
but what about,
what about it?

557
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:57.480
<v 1>Understand as you,
uh,
if you're in that situation,
uh,</v>

558
00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.250
there's a,
a level of panic that comes with it.

559
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.300
And I've never been in that situation fortunately.
And uh,

560
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:09.290
I hope it stays that way,
but,
uh,
you know,
I'm not,
I've never been to the area.

561
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.000
I've never been trained and uh,
you know,
uh,

562
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:17.130
so I kind of look at things like the easiest thing that would be to have around

563
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.600
for,
for if somebody's got that far,
you know,

564
00:33:22.601 --> 00:33:26.890
would be something that would be very easy to use and shotgun comes into that

565
00:33:26.891 --> 00:33:28.600
heading.
So,
uh,

566
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.030
<v 0>but again it's like uh,
it's an efficiency thing.
I've always,
you know,</v>

567
00:33:33.031 --> 00:33:36.260
cause I've actually tore through the south that I always tell them they're out

568
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.220
of their minds to have a shotgun in the house.

569
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.550
I got to hope bit coming out on my next special about it where I was think all

570
00:33:41.551 --> 00:33:46.230
you need is like a 22.
Um,
cause it's easy to,
my big thing is you can,

571
00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.250
when you're in the dark,
if you shoot,
you can still hear it doesn't,
yeah,

572
00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:53.130
you've already lost your sight.
It's not going to take away your hearing too.

573
00:33:53.131 --> 00:33:55.320
And people always laugh at at 22,
but it's like,
dude,

574
00:33:55.321 --> 00:33:59.610
if I had it loaded 22 and I pointed it at you,
you're diving,
you're running away.

575
00:33:59.611 --> 00:34:01.850
And if I started shooting you with it,
you wouldn't be laughing going,

576
00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.380
this is the 22,
I could shoot you with a BB gun.
You can be like,

577
00:34:04.381 --> 00:34:05.580
I'm going to get the fuck outta here.

578
00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.550
<v 1>People,
people,
you know,</v>

579
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:12.230
it also kind of hard to tell what it is you have in your head.

580
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.300
The whole thing is so much,

581
00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:19.130
there's so much psychology that goes along with it and I've studied a lot of

582
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:23.090
that because,
uh,
uh,
again it off.
You've got to have,

583
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:27.740
it's a great responsibility to own firearms.
And I've done a lot of,
of,
uh,

584
00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:31.760
of studying,
I've worked with people.
I haven't actually gone to any,

585
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:36.830
any of the,
uh,
the,
the places we can go to trade.
But I've talked to a lot of the,

586
00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:41.300
of,
of instructors and so on.
And uh,
and uh,

587
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.770
from what I gathered,

588
00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:48.220
he had goods are probably the least effective in even in the hands of,

589
00:34:48.861 --> 00:34:52.680
of trained you married people,
people miss.

590
00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:57.820
I think that a Hemingway said that of all of all the weapons out there,

591
00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:04.330
the weapon that misses the most is a handgun because there's so much moving in.

592
00:35:04.491 --> 00:35:05.650
So much going on in,

593
00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:09.160
<v 0>I would think,
just the sound alone.
I'm hearing a gun.</v>

594
00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:10.620
I'm not going to be sitting there.

595
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:14.870
I'm breaking in your house counting shots like they do in the movie and that'll

596
00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:19.300
be at the bottom going,
Joe,
I know you're out of bullets.
Come out with the,

597
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.580
I mean,
I'm not going to find the second step.
We start shooting at me.

598
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.310
I'm thinking I'm going to go rob another house.

599
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:26.710
I would just think people would do that,
but,
well,

600
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.100
I don't know if you know what I did see you on that show was at son of a gun.

601
00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:32.440
Yeah.
Sons are good sons of guns,
man.

602
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:34.540
That must've been fun itself for people don't know.

603
00:35:34.541 --> 00:35:37.030
I don't even know if it's still on this so many frigging channels and shows

604
00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:40.000
these guys just,
it was like a hot rod show,

605
00:35:40.001 --> 00:35:45.001
except it was guns and these guys would just make these insane weapons.

606
00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.100
Uh,
and then people got to come on the show,
you know,

607
00:35:48.101 --> 00:35:51.550
they'd weld like [inaudible] to have like the top of a Prius or something like

608
00:35:51.551 --> 00:35:55.600
that.
Right,
right.
What did,
uh,
what did you get to shoot on that?

609
00:35:55.601 --> 00:35:56.920
Like some anti aircraft guns,

610
00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:02.540
<v 1>couple of a of a hot rotted,
so to speak.</v>

611
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.590
Uh,
you know,
like [inaudible],
things like that.
So we shot those.

612
00:36:06.591 --> 00:36:11.030
But the main thing was I had this,
uh,
this old kid that was,
uh,

613
00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.180
actually from the 18 hundreds,
and uh,

614
00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:19.190
I really didn't know much about it and they could have cleaned it up a little

615
00:36:19.191 --> 00:36:22.250
bit,
Eh,
cut into the serial number.

616
00:36:22.251 --> 00:36:26.810
And it was actually a military issue that it was actually a naval gun.

617
00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.960
And when two ships are at sea and they want to transport like cargo or a person

618
00:36:33.201 --> 00:36:34.340
or something back and forth,

619
00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:37.250
they need to send the line from one ship to the other.

620
00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:41.180
So they used this kid and which is only about three feet long,

621
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:43.310
and they shoot this,
this,
uh,

622
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.680
this led dart over to the other boat and it,

623
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:50.690
it takes a rope with it.
Then they put the,

624
00:36:50.691 --> 00:36:53.790
attach a bigger rope to it and then a bigger rope and a bigger open.

625
00:36:53.791 --> 00:36:54.381
They'd finally,

626
00:36:54.381 --> 00:36:58.490
they have this pulley thing so they can transport stuff back and forth.

627
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.140
So that's what,
that's what it was.

628
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.920
<v 0>How many people who think accidentally got killed on the other ship?</v>

629
00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.030
You know when the him,

630
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.430
even though that they knew that they were shooting it over,
it was just such,

631
00:37:07.431 --> 00:37:10.490
not an exact science.
He didn't really take wind,
you know,

632
00:37:10.491 --> 00:37:12.170
you kind of wet your finger back then.
Right.

633
00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:16.870
<v 1>The people would probably keep their heads up watching with legal was going</v>

634
00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:18.820
<v 0>sure that you got to a baseball game.</v>

635
00:37:18.821 --> 00:37:20.860
Somebody gets dinged in their head all the time.

636
00:37:20.861 --> 00:37:24.730
They just fucking sitting there and these guys are like trying to hit 190 a

637
00:37:24.731 --> 00:37:28.570
hundred mile an hour pitchers and there's always somebody just sitting there

638
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.420
eating and talking and they get,
they always get hit in the chest.
Thank God.

639
00:37:31.421 --> 00:37:34.120
Like a few people have actually gotten hit in the head.
But I've got to ask you,

640
00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:36.790
there's something about candidates that I realized as I was talking to you,

641
00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:40.090
my only knowledge of Canon's is what I've seen in cartoons.

642
00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.790
I'm not even trying to be funny here.
And there's this,

643
00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.860
they tried to make it look like,
you know,

644
00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.540
the thing that they stick in there is like a little bomb and then they shoot it

645
00:37:49.541 --> 00:37:52.300
and explodes.
But it's really just,
it's just a giant,

646
00:37:52.301 --> 00:37:56.650
like a ball made out of metal.
And that gets launched through gunpowder.
Right?

647
00:37:56.651 --> 00:38:00.880
So this is giant metal ball wall,
sit pokes a hole in your ship and syncs it

648
00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:06.380
<v 1>or for what I had to see it cause I've read quite a few,</v>

649
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:10.170
uh,
a historic novels and that part,

650
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:14.180
that part of history,
uh,
fascinates me.
You know,
the,
the,

651
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:17.900
the tall ships and all that.
And apparently some of the,

652
00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.110
some of the things that would put in there would actually be filled with

653
00:38:21.111 --> 00:38:24.110
gunpowder with,
with a few.
So when it would,

654
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.530
when it would get shot off,
it would,
you know,

655
00:38:27.531 --> 00:38:32.450
it was very inaccurate and,
uh,
you know,
was a wild work,
but it would,
it would,

656
00:38:32.451 --> 00:38:36.950
uh,
you know,
it would lead of the ship hopefully explode,
but whatever

657
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.090
<v 0>it goes back to the dark,
I'm saying it's very inaccurate.
They'd shoot it.
Yeah.</v>

658
00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.820
And they'd probably,
somebody caught it in the leg,
right.

659
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:46.090
And then they got a sawed off.
They just give them some whiskey up.
Right.

660
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:51.320
<v 1>Uh,
tell you,
uh,
medicine was not anything near what we think,</v>

661
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.240
you know,
think of medicine or w you know,

662
00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.280
up till up to the end of the day of the 18th century.
It was like,

663
00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.960
just basically that,
you know,

664
00:38:59.961 --> 00:39:04.280
if you got a hangnail foot comes in because it's covered off or,

665
00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.960
you know,
it was really bad.

666
00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.180
<v 0>Thank [inaudible] to stitch you up.
They just stick your leg in a fire.
Yeah.</v>

667
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.780
Quick,
easy,
cheap.
You know,
so amazing.

668
00:39:14.781 --> 00:39:18.930
Like the amount of pain that you can actually take.
You know,
I saw this,

669
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:23.190
this thing as far as like horrific ways,
horrific ways to die.

670
00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.900
They had this thing.
Okay.

671
00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:28.350
You did something and they decided that you are going to die and they had this

672
00:39:28.351 --> 00:39:28.951
giant,

673
00:39:28.951 --> 00:39:33.951
like it was like a fucking brass cow or some sort of animal it made out of some

674
00:39:34.411 --> 00:39:37.620
sort of metal.
Right,
right.
And they would stick you in the fucking thing.

675
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.350
How they ever got you when,
cause I would've just killed myself.

676
00:39:40.351 --> 00:39:41.670
They stick in the fucking thing.

677
00:39:41.671 --> 00:39:46.080
They close it up and then they light a fire underneath it and they would just

678
00:39:46.081 --> 00:39:47.370
basically cook you.

679
00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:51.420
I've always thought about that laying in there as it's getting hot,

680
00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:54.880
bouncing all around like someone who fucking fell off a motorcycle trying not
to,

681
00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:57.680
you have the heat on you for too long.
Right.
It's just the,
the,

682
00:39:57.681 --> 00:40:02.640
the fucking agony and how these people could just sit there and uh,
who's that?

683
00:40:02.641 --> 00:40:06.390
Who's that guy used to?
Uh,
dates they put you on a,

684
00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:08.670
what the fuck do they call the impaler?
Oh Yeah,

685
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:13.340
<v 1>Vlad the Dracula,
they called it.
I love how you said that.
Like he knew him.
Oh,</v>

686
00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:18.100
I read a read,
read that stuff.
You know,
we've all read it.
We see it in movies.

687
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:23.290
You know,
he's a,
I actually watched the dealer,
you know,
he,
to me,

688
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:28.350
what amazes me is the way that people have invented to fuck other people up over

689
00:40:29.471 --> 00:40:33.970
the years.
It just blows my mind.
I was the worst one you ever heard.
Oh God.

690
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.080
Well that was pretty close.
It would be that,
that really like that.

691
00:40:38.081 --> 00:40:41.890
And I can't imagine being a,
I mean I love horses,

692
00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:46.000
but I can't imagine being tied to four of them.
Ah,
you know what I mean?

693
00:40:46.001 --> 00:40:48.670
And then having somebody yell go,
okay,

694
00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:54.190
pull a little harder.
Not,
not even like,
you know,
get,
you know,

695
00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.850
get up and go and like make it as short but like actually just kind of like,

696
00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:02.180
oh they went holy walk slowly.
I mean that kind of thing.
That's,

697
00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:07.260
that sounds like a pretty rotten way to go.
Those people listening at home or

698
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.440
<v 0>basically they would tie,
you know,
your risks to one horse,
you know,</v>

699
00:41:11.441 --> 00:41:13.140
your rest to another,
your ankle to one,
you know,

700
00:41:13.141 --> 00:41:16.270
and they would walk in four different directions and then he'd slowly fucking

701
00:41:16.271 --> 00:41:18.660
dislocate your joints and then eventually just,

702
00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.600
<v 1>yeah,
pull you apart.
And that's,
yeah,</v>

703
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.130
I would just want to say one thing I do want to say going back to,

704
00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:28.410
we were talking about before which was uh,
about,
you know,

705
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.480
home in home defense and all that,

706
00:41:30.481 --> 00:41:35.481
but one of the things that I've learned from talking to umpteen people about

707
00:41:35.701 --> 00:41:38.160
this and that is that a dog,

708
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:43.230
any size dog is probably the most effective thing you could have in your house

709
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.630
for safety.
Just because the main thing is,

710
00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:53.640
is getting some enough time to either deal with it,

711
00:41:53.641 --> 00:41:57.750
to deal with what you have to deal with.
Make,
make the,
the nine one one call,

712
00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.590
you know,
jump out the window if that's what has to happen,

713
00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:06.540
pull out whatever your,
the,
your last ditch a weapon of choices.

714
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.720
But the main thing is buying some time and a dog will basically send the guy off

715
00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.410
to somebody else's house and me and then it's their problem.

716
00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:18.660
<v 0>I got home,
I got a dog.
My dog will do that.</v>

717
00:42:18.661 --> 00:42:21.390
Like every once in a while I'll be sleeping and I,

718
00:42:21.391 --> 00:42:24.370
and I get so terrified I've just sleeping.
All of a sudden I just started going

719
00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:28.920
and I sit there going like,
what?

720
00:42:28.921 --> 00:42:32.580
And I said I'm such a coward and immediately like,

721
00:42:32.581 --> 00:42:35.010
and then I'm thinking like I should have got a gun.
I should have bought a gun.

722
00:42:35.011 --> 00:42:39.340
You know,
I wish I had a bat here or something.
Well that's a good thing.
Nice.

723
00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:42.690
This cop told me in life is stupid cause you got to get in close to at least

724
00:42:42.691 --> 00:42:44.090
have a bat.
Yeah,

725
00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:49.050
<v 1>that's the dog.
It again,
a dog,
small dog.</v>

726
00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:52.290
Any dogs that you know becomes part of the family.

727
00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:57.330
He's going to protect the pack.
Eh,
he's got to let somebody know.
And uh,
that,

728
00:42:57.331 --> 00:43:00.840
that really,
they,
they on all the lists I've ever received,

729
00:43:00.841 --> 00:43:04.410
they've put there like in the top three things you could,
you could have,

730
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.340
it could be the best thing.

731
00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:08.100
<v 0>Anyway,</v>

732
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:13.100
I just want to get a wind down here cause I gotta I gotta another freaking thing

733
00:43:13.231 --> 00:43:14.220
I got to run to once again.

734
00:43:14.221 --> 00:43:18.480
Sorry that I didn't have a extra my quarter professional man.

735
00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.570
Hey,
I need,

736
00:43:20.571 --> 00:43:22.800
you mentioned that you went over there twice because the other thing you've

737
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:26.610
first one you brought didn't fit my stupid mixer.
Yeah.
It actually,

738
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:30.440
<v 1>it goes to it or to an old microphone that uh,
like an old,</v>

739
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.470
an old sour that needs power.

740
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:36.120
So it had to two more extra pirogues if works

741
00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.280
<v 0>speed to kind of,
he as I showed up unprepared,
but I got it.
Let me ask you,</v>

742
00:43:40.281 --> 00:43:45.190
can I ask you some,
uh,
a music Geek questions here?
Sure.
Okay.
Uh,

743
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:51.320
all right.
The,
the best live band other than your own bed,

744
00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:54.950
best live band you ever saw.
Well,
they have to say,

745
00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:01.370
<v 1>my theory is,
is that,
uh,
uh,
rock and roll show,</v>

746
00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.880
if we're talking about rock and roll,
rock and roll,
see interaction,

747
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.810
interaction between the feds and the band.

748
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:13.820
A lot of times you might be at a club and we not even be a big bed,
but they're,

749
00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:17.870
they,
they've got good songs and that they're getting the audience off.

750
00:44:17.871 --> 00:44:22.460
And the audience who's giving them love in that,
the badge is given it back.

751
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:27.230
It,
you get that feeling like,
wow,
this is magic it right.

752
00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:30.450
Then they might be the best band,
you know,
uh,

753
00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.150
that night did the best band in,
you know,
you,

754
00:44:34.151 --> 00:44:38.400
you walk away and you feel great.
And it was like an incredible show.

755
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:43.790
So that's kind of like what we strive for as we try and do that.

756
00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:48.750
Try and get that magic going and that that's the thing.
You can't,

757
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:52.020
you can line everything up,
make sure they get ties,
are in tune,

758
00:44:52.021 --> 00:44:56.130
make sure everything was working.
But it's really about,
you know,

759
00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.260
hooking up with the audience and,

760
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:02.790
and having that interaction and having that excitement.
And,
uh,

761
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:06.320
I have to say that,
that one of the shows,
uh,

762
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:11.520
the that I've seen recently was actually the stones and it sounds like,
you know,

763
00:45:11.521 --> 00:45:14.250
yeah,
of course,
pick the stones.
But it was,

764
00:45:14.251 --> 00:45:17.940
I've seen him on nights when they just weren't that good.
You know,

765
00:45:17.941 --> 00:45:22.941
I've seen them when they were really good back back in the 60s.

766
00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:24.210
And uh,

767
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:29.660
but this particular night we were on the road in Germany and they played a place

768
00:45:30.871 --> 00:45:35.871
in Berlin and they sounded incredible and it was like,

769
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.340
it was one of those nights where they,

770
00:45:38.341 --> 00:45:42.240
where everything just locked together and you could see,
you know,

771
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:45.870
50 years of experience,
you could hear everything.
It was a,

772
00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:49.080
it was a perfect,
a perfect venue.

773
00:45:49.081 --> 00:45:54.000
It only held about 5,000 people.
And I was blown away.

774
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:58.890
I mean,
I,
you know,
I mean,
I figured it would be like,
you know,
well,
you know,

775
00:45:58.891 --> 00:46:01.890
it would be like,
wow,
they're really good for 70 now.

776
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:06.950
There were as good as any bed I'd ever seen and they were as good as any of the,

777
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:12.460
the great shows I saw in the,
and in the day.
And they will,

778
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.670
they,
they knocked me out,
man.
I have to say,
you know,

779
00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:19.850
<v 0>who are anybody,
any young players out there?
Uh,</v>

780
00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.370
it's crazy now trying to figure out who the guys are cause there's no

781
00:46:22.371 --> 00:46:23.960
centralized area for music anymore.

782
00:46:23.961 --> 00:46:27.470
But are there any young players out there that you watch him play and they

783
00:46:27.471 --> 00:46:30.260
inspire you?
Like man I got to go home and practice or I want to,

784
00:46:30.261 --> 00:46:34.790
I want to try to take my,
you know,
like just as a comedian to try to relate it.

785
00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:39.110
Like you know,
I love new comics and I was seeing somebody,

786
00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.080
there's nothing I love more than seeing a young comic that I know is going to be

787
00:46:42.081 --> 00:46:46.670
great.
Right.
And um,
and you see and they got the hunger,
they got the drive,

788
00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.460
they've got the talent and you know that they're going to,
you just know,

789
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:51.270
you know they're going to do it.
I always,

790
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.560
that always gives me like a jolt of energy cause I remember what that was like a

791
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:59.000
bee in their age and stuff and like how,
you know,

792
00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:01.370
just sort of trying to recapture like,
you know,

793
00:47:01.371 --> 00:47:03.080
cause sometimes you can get into the grind of it.

794
00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.190
I was wondering if there was any like bands that are out right now that,

795
00:47:06.191 --> 00:47:09.620
that make you like,
fuck man,
I,
you know,
maybe you're not near,
you could talk.

796
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:12.200
And he just like,
fuck,
I wish I had my guitar in my hand right now.

797
00:47:12.201 --> 00:47:15.330
I want to just,
just start making music.
I don't really,

798
00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.150
<v 1>here's some good,
some good music.
I was in the studio the other day.</v>

799
00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:23.440
There was a bid that was being recording and you know,

800
00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.390
the vocal was a yet,

801
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.310
but the music sounded like it had likes real potential.

802
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.490
Uh,
it's a really hard question because it's like,

803
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.450
there are a lot of technically oh,

804
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:41.590
great players and there's a few,
like really great players that are really young.

805
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:45.070
Uh,
they're,
they have,
uh,
uh,

806
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.160
there's so much on the Internet.
I mean you can,

807
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:50.560
I mean back when I was growing up,
I had to,

808
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:55.990
I had to struggle to find somebody who even played guitar much less,
uh,
you know,

809
00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:00.010
get a,
get a lesson,
you know.
But,
but you know what,

810
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:04.300
I fucked up my foot trying to figure out John Bonham's bass drum technique

811
00:48:04.301 --> 00:48:05.310
because I was trying to do,

812
00:48:05.311 --> 00:48:09.690
it might like my big toe and I was like arch in my foot and I got like a,

813
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.430
what do you,
what do you call it,
that planter Fisher writers.
Really.

814
00:48:12.431 --> 00:48:14.290
And now it's like you can go,

815
00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:18.840
cause all I had was like a record player and speakers and you stick in your oh

816
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:22.840
it down.
And now like Nia,
you just go on Youtube and somebody just shows you.

817
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.980
Yeah.
And like a slight step,
you just kind of move your whole fort in it.

818
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:28.810
It's like,
you know,
you led goes up once but you get two hits and it's just,

819
00:48:28.811 --> 00:48:30.670
and then I'm watching like some fucking kid,

820
00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:35.380
like eight years old playing all that stuff and I'm just like,
it's,

821
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:39.190
they can get like a year's worth of drum lessons or guitar lessons in one night

822
00:48:39.191 --> 00:48:42.900
on Youtube.
It's,
that's exactly it.
And you know,
I mean the,

823
00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:46.030
it's all spelled out and that's why I think there are a lot of,

824
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:50.140
a lot of good guitar players out there that are technically good.

825
00:48:50.141 --> 00:48:52.300
They can play the play,
all the stuff,

826
00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:56.620
but still it still comes down to writing a good song,

827
00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:58.230
writing something that,
that,

828
00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:02.080
you know is a little bit original and you know,

829
00:49:02.081 --> 00:49:06.130
and it is entertaining and it still comes down to that.
You can be a,

830
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.390
you could be a wizard on guitar,
but unless you're a guitar freak,

831
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.960
you know,
as far as like,
you know,
entertaining,

832
00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:19.120
your average rock fin is still going to write,
write a good song gotta connect.

833
00:49:19.121 --> 00:49:23.560
You know what I mean?
And it's had no matter,
you know,
whether it's like,
you know,

834
00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:26.890
you got 6,000 computers and you got,
you know,

835
00:49:26.891 --> 00:49:29.470
it's running through tape machines and all,
you know,

836
00:49:29.471 --> 00:49:32.650
like he could all the best equipment unless you got a good song,

837
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:36.250
you still get nothing.
So that will ever change.

838
00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:39.670
Let me ask you,
cause I gotta I gotta wrap up here.

839
00:49:39.671 --> 00:49:44.140
As far as your book that's out,
uh,
first of all,
where,
where can fans get it?

840
00:49:44.141 --> 00:49:48.370
I know it's on Amazon,
if any local bookstores.
Well,

841
00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:52.180
there's a few actually is,
there's a lot more than I expected.

842
00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:57.250
I went through probably six or seven cities and,
uh,

843
00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:01.090
most of them we went to,
uh,
I think we,

844
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:02.860
we did a couple of Barnes and noble,

845
00:50:02.861 --> 00:50:06.430
but we did mostly a more mom and pop kind of places.

846
00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:10.810
But what I found out was most of them do their business online.

847
00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:14.470
And so there's,
there's some competition for it was on,
you know,

848
00:50:14.471 --> 00:50:18.730
it keeps everybody kind of honest.
There's a little bit,
he's got a monopoly,

849
00:50:18.731 --> 00:50:23.230
you know,
so,
uh,
but uh,
basically the best thing to do is,

850
00:50:23.231 --> 00:50:27.680
is uh,
either order from your local bookstore,
support,
the,

851
00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:31.910
you know,
Marvin pop kind of places or you know,
get it from,

852
00:50:31.911 --> 00:50:36.050
from a others right now,
hopefully it should still be on the shelves.

853
00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.190
And uh,
I know I signed a bunch of them so this still has,

854
00:50:40.191 --> 00:50:44.270
this is still an opportunity to get some that have been signed.
You know,
what

855
00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.800
<v 0>people buy the book.
Uh,</v>

856
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.560
is there a favorite story or one that comes to mind if you've got a quick one

857
00:50:49.561 --> 00:50:52.680
that you want to tell here at the end?
Uh,
is it basic?

858
00:50:52.681 --> 00:50:55.740
Is it stories about you on the road with these guys?
Is it,

859
00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:57.390
is it the whole thing like Joe,

860
00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:02.520
<v 1>it's an autobiography from the time I put both feet on the ground</v>

861
00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:08.910
from 64 years of life,

862
00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.880
I've been a part of that.
Is there a Smith's,
you know,

863
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:15.530
<v 0>yeah.
I've been a fan of you for so long that I know some of the store.</v>

864
00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:18.500
I remember we'd like you told some cool story in some other interview where you,

865
00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.020
um,
how you ended up getting into guitar.

866
00:51:21.021 --> 00:51:23.960
You were a young kid knows these older guys sitting on the front porch playing

867
00:51:23.961 --> 00:51:25.970
guitar and you're like,
ah.
It just sounded really cool.

868
00:51:25.971 --> 00:51:29.510
Just sort of captured your attention.
Um,
I,

869
00:51:29.511 --> 00:51:34.040
well personally I cannot wait to read it and I'm like fascinated with that whole

870
00:51:34.041 --> 00:51:35.600
period of music that you came up in.

871
00:51:35.601 --> 00:51:38.880
And I also like that whole thing where you guys,
you know,

872
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:41.730
had to stick your ear to speak or try and slow it down.

873
00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:43.880
And because I find a lot of times when I'm,
you know,

874
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:47.210
I messed around with the guitar too and I try to watch somebody play it,

875
00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:49.510
then turn my back to the video cause right.

876
00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.100
Cause then people like the person who will literally break it down,

877
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:53.121
show you that,

878
00:51:53.121 --> 00:51:56.060
where they put their fingers and stuff and people will still ask for tabs.

879
00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.140
And I'm just looking at it like,

880
00:51:57.141 --> 00:51:59.960
don't you ever want to have the freedom to like basically be,

881
00:51:59.961 --> 00:52:03.980
I've always figured becoming literate in music means you could listen to it and

882
00:52:03.981 --> 00:52:04.940
figure it out.

883
00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:08.240
Where if you always had to have tabs and everything was almost like you couldn't

884
00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:12.540
even read.
You know what I mean?
Somebody had to hold your hand.
And uh,

885
00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:17.240
like I think this a lot of people out there that can really play all this shit,

886
00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.510
but if you just played it on a record,
can you sit down?

887
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:23.510
Maybe you don't need to do it anymore because there's someone who will,
will,

888
00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:27.380
will break it down for you.
But,
uh,
but anyway,
soon,
I'm such a huge fan,
uh,

889
00:52:27.381 --> 00:52:29.750
you and your band and all this stuff that you guys have done,

890
00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:31.670
I never even thanked you for all the great music.
I mean,

891
00:52:31.671 --> 00:52:34.430
it's basically a soundtrack of my youth.
Um,

892
00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:37.280
they love all your stuff and I'm so psyched for this book.

893
00:52:37.281 --> 00:52:40.700
I cannot wait to read it.
Uh,
once again,
it's called Joe Perry,

894
00:52:40.701 --> 00:52:43.970
my life in and out of Aerosmith.
Uh,
so psyched.

895
00:52:43.971 --> 00:52:47.720
I finally got you here on the podcast.
Good luck with the allergies.

896
00:52:47.721 --> 00:52:51.380
Thanks for Sean.
Well,
you stories about guns and all this other stuff.
I hope a,

897
00:52:51.381 --> 00:52:52.850
I asked you some different questions.

898
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:56.800
<v 1>It did.
It was great.
And we'll have to do this again because I was,
like I said,</v>

899
00:52:56.801 --> 00:53:00.430
I was looking forward to it.
I've been looking forward to it before the book or,

900
00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:05.100
you know,
I mean,
uh,
you know,
I mean it,

901
00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:08.230
the main reason was because we're from Boston.

902
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:13.450
It's great to hear the accent and just can't get rid of it.
I ran it by the way.

903
00:53:13.451 --> 00:53:16.380
Come to it again.
We'll talk about the civil war,
you know,

904
00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.180
<v 0>definitely.
Definitely.
All right.
Joe Perry,
his new book,</v>

905
00:53:19.181 --> 00:53:23.020
my life in and out of Aerosmith is available all over the Internet and,
a,

906
00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:25.590
if you've got a mom and pop store down the street and you want to them out,

907
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:28.560
bookstore down there,
please go down and pick it up.
Uh,
Joe Perry,

908
00:53:28.561 --> 00:53:31.170
thank you so much for listening to the Monday morning podcast.

909
00:53:31.171 --> 00:53:34.200
Hope to see you soon.
Okay.
It's an honor,
so thank you.
All right,
brother.
