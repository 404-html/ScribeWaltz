WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.910
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.750
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.100
October 1st,
2012,
um,

4
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.520
first day of October.
I got a question for you.

5
00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:18.350
When is the fucking summer going to end?
You know,
I don't want to be these guys,

6
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.670
one of these guys who the first time is a fucking heat wave starts going.

7
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:26.450
See there's global warming.
I think I proved my point.
You know,

8
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.470
like when it snows in February and the people who don't believe in global

9
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:33.200
warming go like,
well gee,
what happened to global warming?

10
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.110
It's fucking snowing out yet.
Spouse too.
It's supposed to.
It's fucking January.

11
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.130
Get Dumb cunt.
Um,

12
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.990
<v 0>okay.</v>

13
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.260
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.620
I'm going out to La and we're going to have another five day fucking heat wave

15
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:50.540
like 99 fucking degrees every God damn day.
And uh,

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.400
I don't have air conditioning in my house.
You gonna Laugh at me now.
You know,

17
00:00:55.401 --> 00:01:00.401
I kind of live in an area where we get a nice breeze and I was told that by the

18
00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:03.740
people who I bought the house off of that.
Yeah,
that's really not a problem.

19
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.010
Can you believe that?
They were deceitful.

20
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.570
You know what sucks about having a fucking houses every time you think you got

21
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:17.120
everything fixed,
you know

22
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.430
it's just something else comes along.
I thought I was finally caught up.

23
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.230
I widen the doors in the garage.

24
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.450
I got the God damn hot water fucking thing outside.
I went tankless,

25
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.930
I got that done.
I fixed the fucking cabinets.

26
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.220
You know I got screens on the windows.

27
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.570
<v 0>Okay,</v>

28
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.400
<v 1>the fuck else did I do.
I got the stupid fucking thing fixed it.</v>

29
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:47.730
You know the hot air goes out of on the laundromat on,
on the,
on the,

30
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.660
on the dryer,

31
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.810
all these little cunty knickknack fucking things and I was thinking all I gotta

32
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.470
do now is have somebody fucking get my chimney up to code

33
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.630
and then clean out some other God damn thing.

34
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:06.920
And I was done now and I got to put a new roof on it too.

35
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.080
So I'm thinking,
all right,
the roof,
that's the most expensive thing.

36
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:13.400
I'll get that thing done.
Right.

37
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.610
What's the point of fixing and everything else if it's just going to get wet,

38
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.500
right.
Figured that was my next move.
Then out of fucking nowhere,

39
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.680
I got Nia Colomy up QE,
choose kit,
one of those standalone units.

40
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.250
Qhs just get a C in one room.

41
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.460
Unbelievable.
I thought it was in the clear,
it's fucking October.

42
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.830
<v 0>Okay,</v>

43
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.050
<v 1>well,
Coos,
kitten home.
I live in a Goddamn desert.</v>

44
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:43.180
At some point I'm going to have to get air conditioning,

45
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.360
but now most of feeling like a pussy because everybody else,

46
00:02:46.361 --> 00:02:49.990
whoever owned by fucking house,
they somehow dealt with it.

47
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.870
Maybe sat on the front steps,
drinking a mint,
mint,

48
00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:55.690
Julep socializing with the neighbors,

49
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.740
talking about Pearl Harbor or whatever the they did.

50
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.260
<v 0>Okay,</v>

51
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.800
<v 1>well they had tougher breed back then,
or is this global warming thing actually,</v>

52
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.770
uh,
something that's true.

53
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.250
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.640
<v 1>Well actually
it is getting warmer.</v>

55
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.310
You know,
it's just the debate is,
I'm so in over my head,
just,
just,
just enter,

56
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.960
entertain me,
just go with me on this.

57
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.350
The big debate is whether or not human beings have an effect on it.

58
00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:25.284
I just,
you know,

59
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.620
you know what's funny is I can't even take myself seriously because every time I

60
00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:35.940
tried to talk about a heavy subject,
my brain is just screaming at me.

61
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.640
You don't read or you haven't read up on any of this.

62
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.350
You've only overheard conversations,
so why don't you shut the fuck up.

63
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.200
Um,
anyways,
this is a podcast for this week.
Everybody,
it's football Sunday.

64
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.350
I'm here in Jacksonville,
Florida.
It's five minutes to one,

65
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.440
five minutes before Bup,
Bup,
bup,
do to,
to,
to,
to,

66
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.721
to,

67
00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:02.721
to all the games are going to start already predicted on my Twitter account that

68
00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:08.040
the Patriots were going to win 63 to five today against the buffalo bills.

69
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.450
And I stand by that.
That's actually what I'm hoping it's going to happen.

70
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.560
And it's somebody,
are you predicting you're going to get his safety?
No.

71
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.520
What's going to happen is we're going to be up 63 to three are punters gonna

72
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.390
feel bad for you.

73
00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:24.910
So you just going to kind of run out of the back of the end zone,
you know,

74
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.560
just to give you another two fucking points,
you know,

75
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.800
you know what's the worst thing about going to a buffalo bills game,

76
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.010
aside from the lingering sadness of losing four super bowls in a row is

77
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:41.580
listening to that dumb chant that let's go buffalo.

78
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.370
I hate fucking,
first of all,
it rhymes,
you know?

79
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.210
Yay.
Let's go buffalo.

80
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.250
The AFC.

81
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.960
He says some of the worst fucking chance in just in all of professional sports.

82
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.120
J E t s jazz,
jazz charts,
her,
hey,

83
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.630
it's like,
what fucking year is it?

84
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.363
<v 0>Okay,</v>

85
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.080
<v 1>let's go buffalo.
Those are some angry mother fuckers out there.
I'll tell you,</v>

86
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:17.160
that may versus a few years ago we went to that fucking bills jets game.

87
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.640
Somebody pushed me in the back while I was taking a piss because they had a

88
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:25.170
patriots hat on.
You know,
fucking losers out there,
man.

89
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.510
Fucking losers.
You know,

90
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.000
I love how they act.
Like they didn't have video cameras out there.
You know,

91
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:39.500
fucking mob levy could easily just film the other team.

92
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.430
And one.
One of those super bowls.
You didn't want to do it.
Yeah,

93
00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:47.110
it didn't want to do it.
You made me feel you.

94
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.040
Why didn't want to do it?
Why don't they just,
you know,
listen buffalo,

95
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:55.100
if he could learn anything from some of your,

96
00:05:55.101 --> 00:05:58.730
your compadres here in the AFC,
if you can't beat them,

97
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:01.580
cheat for the love of God.

98
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.390
How long are you going to have that mom and pop store?
We're making our own jam.

99
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:08.360
Putting in an extra fucking pickle jars.
Vibe.

100
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.180
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

101
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.100
<v 1>First of all,
you know what your problem is buffalo.</v>

102
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.850
You don't even deserve a professional fucking franchise.

103
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.140
Do you understand that?

104
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.800
Do you want understand how if you didn't have the bills and the sabers that the

105
00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:27.370
amount of people wouldn't even know like you,
you'd be like Elmira.

106
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.960
You'd be one of those fucking towns.

107
00:06:28.961 --> 00:06:33.961
Nobody even knew about you guys fucking peeked back when people took road.

108
00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:39.640
Like when going to Niagara Falls was was was like a fucking,

109
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.600
you know,
place where you went on your honeymoon.
Fuzzy,
irregular.

110
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.280
Joe couldn't afford to fly.

111
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.483
<v 0>All right?</v>

112
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.250
<v 1>That's why you've never won anything because God forgets that you exist.</v>

113
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.960
Why am I being so mean to them?

114
00:06:57.961 --> 00:07:02.430
I actually think I'm going to be performing there next year.
I have no idea.

115
00:07:02.431 --> 00:07:05.430
You know actually the reality is with this whole fucking patriots' defense,
I,

116
00:07:05.431 --> 00:07:06.264
you know,

117
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.710
and we've got a rookie fucking trying to protect Tom Brady's blind side.
I got,

118
00:07:10.711 --> 00:07:13.110
I have no idea.
And it's a divisional rivalry.

119
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.510
We usually go one and one against the bills.

120
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.580
You know the bills usually when one and then shred and Reagan called me up like

121
00:07:20.581 --> 00:07:24.870
gauge gt gay would you dig about dead right.
And they get all fucking excited.

122
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.250
They start talking super bowl and then the next time we play and we raped them.

123
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.350
You know,
we put that red ball thing in their mouth,

124
00:07:34.351 --> 00:07:37.710
bend them over and shoved the football right up to harass.
You know,
it's common,

125
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.023
you know it is

126
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.093
<v 0>okay.</v>

127
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.180
<v 1>Who has more false hope?
A bills fan or a jets fan?</v>

128
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.120
I think it's a jets fan just because they look like that guy.

129
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.610
The Mush in a Bronx tale.
Like your average fucking jets fan.
That's what he,

130
00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:54.110
that's what he looks like.
You know?

131
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:58.460
And I'm not saying that the average patriots fan doesn't look like a fucking

132
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.030
alcoholic.
Lucky charms.
Fucking dude.
I'm not even saying that.

133
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.460
I would never try to say that.

134
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:07.340
We don't look like a bunch of fucking drunk potatoes.
All right.

135
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.110
I'm not saying that we don't.
All right,
but you guys just have that.

136
00:08:12.111 --> 00:08:15.530
Let's go like off track betting.
That's what you're,

137
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:17.810
that's what the upper deck of a jets game looks like.

138
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.390
I Dunno if it's those awful fucking green jerseys.

139
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.640
You know,
if you're going to get the jets jersey,
you gotta get,

140
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.290
you gotta get the white one man.

141
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:38.380
What the gray numbers when it's that fucking just pea soup.

142
00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:39.770
Forest Green.

143
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.050
That's just one of the worst fucking jerseys ever.
But you know what?

144
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:49.580
At the end of the day,
it's still a great game.
See,

145
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.720
I would positive there at the end of the day,

146
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.890
it's still a great game.

147
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.040
I actually some fight with some fucking Jack off on Twitter,
right?

148
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.360
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

149
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.290
<v 1>Cause I announced,</v>

150
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.310
I tweeted that I was going to be going to the Jacksonville Jaguars.

151
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.230
Cincinnati Bengals game,

152
00:09:08.231 --> 00:09:11.830
can you fucking believe that I'm hanging around an extra day in Jacksonville to

153
00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:13.000
watch that contest?

154
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.863
<v 0>Okay.</v>

155
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.420
<v 1>Is that not going to beat one of the most lowest rated football games of the</v>

156
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.253
year?

157
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.253
<v 0>MMM.</v>

158
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.340
<v 1>Do I have the hiccups?
Jesus Christ.</v>

159
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.603
<v 0>MMM.</v>

160
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.380
<v 1>But anyways,</v>

161
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.070
I got into this Twitter argument with some guy or I'm guessing he's from fucking

162
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:35.370
Great Britain or Ireland or some shit and the in,
once again,

163
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.020
like those guys are so on their own dicks.
If they,

164
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.000
if they fucking watch rugby,
you know what I mean?

165
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.300
Like the,
the,
the amount of time.

166
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.020
Either there's soccer fans over there and then they always come up with,

167
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.160
they think that's the most clever Seinfeld thing ever.
They're always like,

168
00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:59.930
why do they call it football one are using,
you know,

169
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.140
like
the excitement in their emails or their,

170
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.360
their tweets when they send that to me as if they're the first person who ever

171
00:10:08.361 --> 00:10:10.430
came up with that little clever analogy.

172
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

173
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.270
<v 1>You know,
first of all,</v>

174
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.120
<v 0>okay,</v>

175
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.650
<v 1>football came out of soccer.</v>

176
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:18.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

177
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.650
<v 1>We were kicking the ball around,
you know,</v>

178
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.900
playing your dumb little fucking game.
That was brought over.
Okay,

179
00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:28.790
but because we're fucking Americans

180
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.660
and we know we know how to fucking make shit exciting,

181
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.910
we know how to ramp shit up.

182
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.940
We're not stuck in the past like you guys with your dumb fucking castles talking

183
00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:45.180
about over a hundred the year.
He's told fucking Lilliputian.
Who gives a fuck,

184
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.570
Huh?
Yeah.

185
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:52.590
Dumb ass fucking history of the Goddamn serfs and the landowners and the feudal

186
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:57.690
system and you're fucking Catholics Protestants.

187
00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.820
Nobody gives a fuck.

188
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.320
<v 0>Okay.</v>

189
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.310
<v 1>Yeah.
Half Horse,</v>

190
00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:06.930
half fucking man walking around with that fucking flute or whatever the hell it

191
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:07.764
did.

192
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.710
You bunch of Goddamn perverts a shirtless man coming out of a horse with the

193
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.950
fuck is wrong with you.
You're going to sit here and criticize our games sitting.

194
00:11:16.951 --> 00:11:19.200
Let's say that that that NFL,

195
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.210
that rugby is a tougher game than NFL football.

196
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.350
You know what rugby looks like to me?
Rugby looks like NFL football.

197
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.290
If the fans ran on the field and started playing,

198
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.910
not saying they're not tough fans.

199
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.440
Not saying they're not fans who have gold member gold gym memberships.

200
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:48.420
I'm not even trying to say that.
I wouldn't insult you by trying to say that.

201
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.350
I'm just saying it just looks like like really fast.

202
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:57.100
People from the stance went out there during halftime.

203
00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.190
Kind of like when you watch an Nhl game and they let those,

204
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:04.780
those fucking kids come out and play a little mini one on one,
right?

205
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.670
We got fucking swamp Scott for his model had today.

206
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.390
They showed see scores.
All right.

207
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.730
I'm not saying rugby isn't a tough game.

208
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:18.390
I'm not saying it's not a beautiful game and I'm not saying it's not an all.

209
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.080
I fucking love it.
I go over there,
I watch it.
If I had time,
I would go to a game.

210
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.110
I think it's great,
but for you fucking Ian,

211
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:31.111
Mick fucking pasty Fox to sit here and try and act as though they're a bunch of

212
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:35.890
fucking white guys running around in shorts.

213
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.500
If fucking Polo shirts tackling each other,
you know,

214
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:47.010
is the equivalent to fucking someone on of of Ray Lewis's ability.

215
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.330
You're,
you're out of your mind.
You're out of your fucking mind.

216
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.021
I can tell you right now,

217
00:12:53.021 --> 00:12:57.370
you can judge the level of your sport by the amount of white guys that are

218
00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:58.840
playing it at a professional level.

219
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.840
You can certainly judge the speed of it.
Okay?

220
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:09.670
Rugby looks like you're watching the NBA in the 1960s you know,

221
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.530
and checked steals it.

222
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.130
You know,

223
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.820
and one of the big things that rugby people always say is they say NFL players

224
00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:24.990
are pussies.
Okay?
NFL players of pussies.

225
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:29.770
Just step back and just wrap your head around that because they wear pads,

226
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.780
you know,
and I get why they say that because to look at it,
you're like,
oh,

227
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:36.070
they have all these pads on.

228
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.610
It doesn't hurt them because they have all this padding on.

229
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.010
You know what it is?
You guys never played the fucking game.
Okay?

230
00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:48.550
I played rugby,
was called kill the man with the ball.
I've played it.
Yes,

231
00:13:48.551 --> 00:13:51.910
I got took knees and I took shots.
But you know what I didn't do?

232
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.330
I never really led with my head.
And you know why?

233
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.960
Because they didn't have a fucking helmet on.
Nobody really lead.

234
00:13:58.961 --> 00:14:02.860
You lead with your shoulder and you tackled with the shoulder just like they do

235
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:06.190
in rugby.
I'm not saying,
hey that heads don't collide.

236
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.910
I'm not saying there aren't fucking collisions and broken bones.

237
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.770
Okay.
I'm just saying,
first of all,
the helmet is,

238
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.980
is what you're looking at it as an unbelievable design floor.

239
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.180
What it really is is it's just a battering ram.
It protects the skull.

240
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:24.730
It does not protect the brain.
Okay.

241
00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:28.660
Do you guys have like when rugby players are done playing rugby,

242
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.710
is their heads so fucked up that they shoot themselves in the chest so their

243
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:36.580
brain can be donated to science to figure out what the fuck happened to him?

244
00:14:36.581 --> 00:14:41.260
Do you have that happen?
Have you ever had somebody go,
you know what,
uh,

245
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.910
um,
I want to play this week so cut the end of my finger off so I can,

246
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.180
I can go out and actually play this week.
You know,

247
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.010
do you have people doing shit like that?
You

248
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.690
<v 2>know,
as they run their fucking,</v>

249
00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.380
they're fucking ten second forties over there.
Look,

250
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:03.440
I'm not saying it's a tough game.
I'm not saying this is not a fucking,
you know,

251
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.240
I'm not saying those guys aren't faster than me,

252
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:09.530
but if you put Ray Lewis on a fucking rugby field,
you would be picking up limbs.

253
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.580
Limbs would be littered all over the field.
All right,

254
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:19.490
so that's it.
The debate is over and you can fucking do anything you want to do.

255
00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:23.450
Send me a tweet,
send me your fucking emails and all that type of shit.
All right,

256
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:28.220
you guys started it.
I never said rugby was a pussy game.
I still haven't.

257
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.640
You guys constantly send me fucking emails telling me that NFL football players

258
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:36.350
are pussies.
Let me tell you something right now.

259
00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:41.330
The average NFL player is big enough to grab your entire family by the throat

260
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.560
and choke,
slam you on your fucking knights of the round table.

261
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.120
Fucking table.
All right,

262
00:15:50.121 --> 00:15:54.590
so there you go.
There's your fodder for this week.
You fucking cunts.
Um,
oh.

263
00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:58.280
Meanwhile,
Hey,
by the way,
my special is available for download this week.

264
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.390
It's available,
available for download for $5 off of my website.

265
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.210
I would appreciate it if you guys would go on and,
uh,

266
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.580
and download the son of a bitch cause it costs me a lot of money and I'd like to

267
00:16:10.581 --> 00:16:14.200
try to make my money back.
Um,
and if he could tell me your favorite,

268
00:16:14.201 --> 00:16:15.860
please don't post it on Youtube.

269
00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:19.010
I'm not having an encrypted and all that shit cause that's not fair to people

270
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:22.280
who aren't going to do something bad with it.
Just do me a favor.
Okay.

271
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.140
Just give me six months.

272
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.760
Just give me a six months window to fucking sell this thing so I can make my

273
00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:29.810
money back.
You know,

274
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:34.190
so I can go and make another one so I don't have to shoot my next special on a

275
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:37.490
fucking iPhone.
Um,
if you could do that for me,

276
00:16:37.491 --> 00:16:41.840
I would greatly appreciate it.
So,
hey,
here's,
here's your time to act now.

277
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.710
It Bill bird.com Monday morning,

278
00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:50.480

279
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.140
That is the deal.
$5 five bucks.
Can you,

280
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.000
can you look into your heart?
Um,

281
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.200
so anyways,
all let's,
let's,
let's get,

282
00:17:03.201 --> 00:17:06.980
let's get one of these fucking commercials out of the Goddamn way before,

283
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:11.040
before I get going here.
You know,
these people complain.
Cry.

284
00:17:11.041 --> 00:17:15.470
She didn't read my commercial until 50 minutes.
I did a podcast,
a,
yeah.
Word.

285
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:21.500
Who the hell's even listening anymore?
Why did I make my password in Spanish?

286
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:27.270
Huh?
Why would I do that?
Come on.
Open Up.
No,

287
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.310
as a problem.
Come on.

288
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.500
Here we go.
Yeah.
Went,
I want to shot some guns when I was out here.

289
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.500
Do you know silencers are fucking legal in Florida.

290
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.730
They actually had like semiautomatic rifles with silences on the fucking wall.

291
00:17:43.731 --> 00:17:45.860
I'm going to say I got some pictures,

292
00:17:45.861 --> 00:17:49.950
hopefully posted on the podcast page of that.
Um,

293
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.890
it's fucking hilarious.
I mean,
there was Versie and they actually,
uh,
you know,

294
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.340
it's always scary when you were going to go to the gun range and you just send

295
00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:01.920
them with a bunch of strangers with loaded fucking guns.

296
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:03.923
<v 0>MMM.</v>

297
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.870
<v 2>Do you know,
and there's always like that one fucking novice in there that just,</v>

298
00:18:08.871 --> 00:18:13.790
you know,
or not even,
they're just so comfortable.
If they start doing dumb shit,

299
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:19.520
like loading the gun on the other side and then turning around and walking with

300
00:18:19.521 --> 00:18:22.040
the fucking thing up.
Just like load it at the,
at the,

301
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.850
I don't know what the terminology is.
I'm one of those green horns.

302
00:18:25.851 --> 00:18:27.710
I probably shouldn't even be in there,
but I fucking,

303
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.940
I just had that thing pointed down fucking range.
The whole God damn time.

304
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.450
I load it right where I'm going to shoot it and when it's done,

305
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.320
I fucking take the clip out.
I fucking,
that's it.

306
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.570
Safety on and I just have it pointed down range.

307
00:18:41.571 --> 00:18:45.950
At no point do I ever take that fucking thing.
Even pointing it at the floor,

308
00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:46.960
turn around and walk.

309
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:48.740
<v 0>Okay.</v>

310
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.920
<v 2>Back to the whatever,
the fucking back areas and then load it.
They,</v>

311
00:18:51.921 --> 00:18:53.450
I hate when people do that shit.

312
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.710
<v 1>Um,
anyway,</v>

313
00:18:55.711 --> 00:18:58.090
so I'm actually at the gun range and this fucking guy cause walkabout by,

314
00:18:58.091 --> 00:19:01.030
he goes,
hey,
you built bar?
And I was like,
yeah.
He goes,

315
00:19:01.031 --> 00:19:05.020
I'm going to see you tonight at the comedy zone.
I go,
that's cool.
Right.

316
00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.130
Any fucking opens up.
He has like,
it looks like a look up mechanics tool chest.

317
00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.570
Yeah,
like a chrome plated fucking desert eagle in there.

318
00:19:13.571 --> 00:19:16.930
That's a 50 caliber fucking psycho gun.

319
00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.690
And he had all this shit with like a silencer and I go,
Holy Shit Dude.
I go the,

320
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.840
I go,
you got a silencer?
And the guy goes,
yeah,
and you're going to shoot it.

321
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.730
So I'm all excited.

322
00:19:30.731 --> 00:19:34.690
And then I see Versie Versie turns into like a fucking six year old standing

323
00:19:34.691 --> 00:19:38.260
there.
He's got this look on his face.
You know,
like when the teacher goes,

324
00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:41.740
who wants to play with the new toy we bought and pick somebody else.

325
00:19:41.741 --> 00:19:45.850
That was the look versus he had on his face.
Like,
how come you picked him?
Am I,

326
00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:48.490
am I going to get to play with it?
So I actually walked always,
Hey,

327
00:19:48.491 --> 00:19:50.530
is it okay if my buddy shoots it to?
And he said,
yeah.

328
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.040
So I tell versus yesterday he's going to let you shoot it too when he fucking so

329
00:19:54.041 --> 00:19:56.740
fucking face lights up.
Right.
Um,

330
00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:57.970
<v 0>okay.</v>

331
00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:02.110
<v 1>It was fucking incredible,
man.
It's fucking incredible.
You can't,</v>

332
00:20:02.111 --> 00:20:06.010
you can't have a silencer or what do they call a suppressor?

333
00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.120
Whatever the fuck they call it.

334
00:20:07.121 --> 00:20:09.760
You can't have in New York if you have one in New York,

335
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.040
do you get caught with one of those in New York?

336
00:20:12.041 --> 00:20:14.830
I think that's automatically like fucking 30 years.

337
00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.090
They just look at it like you have that because you're planning on murdering

338
00:20:19.091 --> 00:20:21.010
somebody and you don't want anybody to hear,

339
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.263
<v 0>you know,</v>

340
00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.120
<v 2>silence or really is sort of the bitchy way of killing somebody.
Right.</v>

341
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.690
That's like the passive aggressive,
the passive aggressive route.
You know

342
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.380
<v 0>p p p</v>

Wouldn't it be great?

348
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.640

349
00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:58.690

Did I say it right?
Yeah.

Virtual numbers or is it viral virtual virtual phone numbers?

You can have as many phone numbers.
Basically,

353
00:21:11.741 --> 00:21:15.580
I don't know how many numbers all rings on your cell phone.
Okay.

354
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:19.480
They have voice over actors.
You know,
it's basically your mobile phone at work.

355
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.980

359
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.650
you know what's cool about this?

360
00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:44.380
They actually have trained like a voiceover actors.

361

That doesn't exist,

365
00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.590

383
00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:09.940
a male.

So anyways,

405
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:36.970
we went and uh,
we went shooting
and I got to tell you something.
It's,

406
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.240
it's oddly relaxing.

407
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.080
You know what it is after you get over the fact that you're firing a gun,

408
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.540
you then want to get good at it and you want to hit the target.

409
00:24:45.541 --> 00:24:48.180
And it's almost like you're shooting hoops except you're,

410
00:24:48.181 --> 00:24:51.540
you're shooting at a silhouette of a person.
Does that make sense?

411
00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.320
Um,
I actually like revolvers

412
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.370
classic me,
right?
Isn't that just typical?

413
00:25:03.371 --> 00:25:08.200
Make the old fucking curmudgeon doesn't like the new shit.

414
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.870
I'm not into the glocks.
The semiautomatics.

415
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.940
I guess it's nice that you have more bullets,

416
00:25:12.941 --> 00:25:17.590
but I like the fucking wider vibe of just having a Goddamn revolver.

417
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.110
You get a nice big one like that 38,

418
00:25:20.111 --> 00:25:24.550
that first he was shooting the heavier the gun less kick.
It's,
it's phenomenal.

419
00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.110
There was this chick next to us shooting a frigging cannon that she was afraid

420
00:25:29.111 --> 00:25:33.960
of.
I hate that shit.
I want to go in there and I wanna I wanna.

421
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:37.510
I want to go to a shooting range where it's a bunch of fucking navy seals and

422
00:25:37.511 --> 00:25:41.080
everybody is comfortable.
This girl was just like,
oh man.

423
00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:43.010
It was a beautiful gun though.
Is this,

424
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.940
is it crazy to say that they really are fucking beautiful?

425
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:47.590
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

426
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:52.180
<v 1>I feel like fucking Tom Cruise and taps.
It's fucking beautiful,
man.
I'm serious.</v>

427
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.990
The God damn fucking that beautiful.

428
00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.030
Is this freaking everybody out overseas and other,
uh,

429
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:04.960
American gun nut,
you know,
out of fucking,

430
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.790
why don't you guys have guns over there?

431
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:09.503
<v 0>You know,</v>

432
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.590
<v 1>you cops in England,
the cops in England don't have guns.
Is that right?</v>

433
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.640
Or do they have them now because of all the terrorists?
What do they have?

434
00:26:18.641 --> 00:26:20.710
They have a whistle and that really tall hat.

435
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.620
It's got to slow them down when they're chasing people.
Just,

436
00:26:23.621 --> 00:26:26.530
they'll fucking lack of aerodynamics,
wouldn't it?

437
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.200
Anybody?
All right,
here's something you need to know.

438
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.560
All fucking belly fat face is working out again and uh,
actually went,

439
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.140
this isn't an advertisement.

440
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:42.700
I went out and bought a pegboard and I'm hanging them up in the garage.

441
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.190
Do I stutter?
And,
um,

442
00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.110
<v 0>okay.</v>

443
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.850
<v 1>Um,
I'm totally,
I'm fucking all about that now.
The grip strength,</v>

444
00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.940
I don't think I'll ever go to the gym again and fucking sit there and bench

445
00:26:54.941 --> 00:26:58.010
press and all that.
You don't need to do it.
You just need to do pushups.

446
00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:01.330
All I need to do is move your own fucking body.
You don't need to go down there.

447
00:27:01.331 --> 00:27:05.080
I mean,
unless you try it out for the NFL,
you know,
or you're playing rugby.

448
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.770
Look at that.
I gave rugby respect,
you know,

449
00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.150
this is what it goes to the lingerie league,

450
00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.840
rugby and then NFL football bottom to top,
you know.

451
00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:23.410
Um,
all right,
let's get to some questions this week.
Everybody.
All right.
Uh,

452
00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.270
college broads,
college broads.
Oh,

453
00:27:28.271 --> 00:27:30.730
by the way,
you know something.
You know the great thing about fucking,

454
00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.590
you know this rope climbing shit that I'm doing,

455
00:27:32.591 --> 00:27:35.330
doing pull ups and now I've got this pegboard thing.
I actually,

456
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.050
I'm on the eighth floor of this hotel and I'm telling you right now,

457
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.150
I could climb down the fucking side.

458
00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:45.400
It's a bunch of balconies and I could hang down from my belt if there was a
fire,

459
00:27:45.401 --> 00:27:46.960
right?
I could fucking hang down.

460
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:48.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

461
00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:53.110
<v 1>And just fucking swing my legs jumped down to the next one and I could just go</v>

462
00:27:53.111 --> 00:27:55.960
all the way down the side of the thing.
You know,

463
00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:58.570
that's where you're right there.

464
00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:01.660
Can you do that through bench pressing and doing squats?

465
00:28:01.661 --> 00:28:02.890
She can't fucking do that.

466
00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:04.530
<v 0>Okay.</v>

467
00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:08.400
<v 1>You're old beast with muscles.
You're overdeveloping yourself.
All right.</v>

468
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:14.580
Basically my message is if you're not doing what I'm doing,
you're an asshole.

469
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:20.510
Despite the fact I have no nutritional or training or any of that shit.

470
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:24.210
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Hey,
let me hide some gigs here.

471
00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.270
I'm next week,
I'm part of my seven week tour.

472
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.840
I am four weeks into this fucking thing,
by the way,

473
00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:34.980
underrated for the week is the,
uh,
the comedy zone in Jacksonville,

474
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.950
Florida.
Any other comics are listening.

475
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.090
It's just a fucking old school comedy club.
It's in the Ramada.

476
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:47.310
It's got the brick wall behind you.
I absolutely fucking love the club that,

477
00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.700
the setup.
It's just a semicircle.

478
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.210
Everybody's right there.
Fucking phenomenal crowds.

479
00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.760
I didn't know what I was going to run into when I came out of it than I already

480
00:28:56.761 --> 00:28:59.190
talk about this.
I started the podcast a couple of times.

481
00:28:59.191 --> 00:29:00.090
Let me just get right to it.

482
00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:04.490
I had a great time and I'm definitely gonna come back.
I'd like to come back,
um,

483
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:07.590
and go to that Georgia,
uh,
gator's game.

484
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:12.450
But I'm just worried that,
you know,
the games during the day,

485
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.870
everybody's going to be fucking hammered.
I'm going to get hammered.

486
00:29:15.871 --> 00:29:18.420
Then I got to do shows.
No one's going to show up at some point.

487
00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:20.490
I have to go to that God damn game.
But anyways,

488
00:29:20.491 --> 00:29:23.370
I had a great time and I want to thank everybody who came up because,
uh,

489
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:28.950
I was finally able to work out that Hitler Stalin thing.
Bye Adnan Satchel Paige.

490
00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.740
All right.
And if it wasn't such a great club,

491
00:29:31.741 --> 00:29:35.220
I would have been closed off and I wanted to come up with it.
So,
um,

492
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.890
so there's that.
So next week the tour continues.

493
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:44.110
I'm going to be a go bananas in Montgomery,
Ohio,
just outside of Cincinnati,

494
00:29:44.111 --> 00:29:46.720
October 5th and sixth,
and Paul,
dude,

495
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:50.470
I called it [inaudible] is going to be there and we're hanging around to go to

496
00:29:50.471 --> 00:29:53.710
the fucking Bengals Dolphin's game on Sunday.

497
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:57.340
That'll be franchise.
Today's franchise number one 10.

498
00:29:57.341 --> 00:30:01.930
That'll be franchise one 11,
one 11,
and I'll have 13 more to go.

499
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.640
Um,
after that,
I'll be fucking,
where the hell am I going to be?

500
00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:11.641
I'm going to be in New York City on October 13th at the beacon theater on the

501
00:30:12.251 --> 00:30:14.560
comedy central thing night.
At too many,

502
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:21.190
there's too many stars.
People.
Um,

503
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.700
well if you're booking me,
they should have been a night of not enough.

504
00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:29.440
Don't enough stairs.
Um,
all right.
After that,
then I go to fucking Australia.

505
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:30.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

506
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:35.430
<v 1>I'm going to the Sydney Opera House.
October 18th,
19th and 20th,</v>

507
00:30:35.431 --> 00:30:38.040
another great sport.
Australian rules football.

508
00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:43.910
Um,
Harris in New Orleans November 2nd.

509
00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:48.410
I've never done stand up at any sort of a club in New Orleans.

510
00:30:48.411 --> 00:30:52.210
I one time I did,
I did a club in,
uh,

511
00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.460
I don't northern.

512
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:55.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

513
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:59.910
<v 2>Northern,
where the fuck was it?
Louisiana.</v>

514
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.490
That's what I meant to say.
Not New Orleans.
I met and the Louisiana.

515
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.470
I'll be at Harris November 2nd and on November 3rd,
I'm going to Lsu,
Alabama.

516
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.640
Uh,
you liked this shit.
People,
he liked to shit.
Isn't this fucking,

517
00:31:11.641 --> 00:31:15.420
isn't this a great life?
Traveling the road I'll be with first.
He again,

518
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.400
it's a phenomenal life.
You guys should all try.

519
00:31:17.401 --> 00:31:20.310
You should all try being a fucking standup comedian at some point your life.

520
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.080
And then what you do is you continue to have failed pilots so you never get a

521
00:31:25.081 --> 00:31:28.020
television show.
And as much as that hurts,

522
00:31:28.021 --> 00:31:31.170
one day it hits you and you realize,
you know what?

523
00:31:31.171 --> 00:31:33.570
It's kind of fucking awesome not to have a TV show

524
00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.300
because I get to kind of just fucking go out here and make great money,

525
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.430
go to games,
do whatever the fuck I want to do,
say whatever I want to say.

526
00:31:43.431 --> 00:31:44.840
And I don't have to deal with people going,

527
00:31:44.841 --> 00:31:48.860
you know our advertisers are upset by that yet I'll go fuck yourself.

528
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:53.840
Go Fuck Yourself.
That's the thing.
You know when you get your own TV show you,

529
00:31:53.841 --> 00:31:57.470
if they call it by your own name,
you know it's really not your TV show.

530
00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.450
It's their TV show and they'll take it back whenever they fucking Goddamn want

531
00:32:02.451 --> 00:32:05.840
to.
And then what do you do?
You go out and buy a big fucking,

532
00:32:05.841 --> 00:32:09.830
I got my own TV show house and then all of a sudden you don't have a TV show,

533
00:32:09.831 --> 00:32:13.310
but you still got the big,
I got my own TV show house and then what?

534
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.860
Now you got to go on the road.
Not because you want to,

535
00:32:15.861 --> 00:32:19.640
cause you have to and you're going to go out there all fucking miserable and

536
00:32:19.641 --> 00:32:22.970
everybody's yelling your catch phrase from the show,
right?

537
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.950
You fucking hate in life.

538
00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:28.970
I avoided all of that through failed pilots.

539
00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:35.690
I am.
I am.
I'm living the fucking dream.
I just had eggs benedict.

540
00:32:35.691 --> 00:32:39.950
There were overcooked.
Did you do that?
I laid and he in a fucking hotel room,

541
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:44.000
picked up the phone and said,
listen bitch,
you bring me those fucking eggs.

542
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:47.060
You bring up to me now.
And then another woman knocked on my door,
said,
hey,

543
00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:49.880
would you like some turndown service?
And I said,
no,
I would not,

544
00:32:49.881 --> 00:32:52.310
but I would like some fresh towels immediately.

545
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:54.530
And she handed them to me and they were still warm.

546
00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.033
<v 0>Okay.</v>

547
00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:00.880
<v 2>This is the word of the Lord.
Thanks be to God</v>

548
00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:05.620
all.
Alright,
anybody go to church today?
Oh,

549
00:33:05.621 --> 00:33:10.240
I Lou [inaudible] Lou Ya.
You know I sat next to,
you know,

550
00:33:10.241 --> 00:33:13.330
you guys think I'm tone deaf.
I sat next to one of the most tone deaf people.

551
00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:16.930
You know,
it's underrated.
A fucking water taxi.
I'm looking at one right now.

552
00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:17.711
I don't give a shit.

553
00:33:17.711 --> 00:33:20.260
If you're going to the worst fucking job you've ever had in your life for that

554
00:33:20.261 --> 00:33:22.630
moment,
when you're on that boat,
you're a free man.

555
00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.410
It's like when they were drinking the beers on the roof and fucking Shawshank

556
00:33:26.411 --> 00:33:31.150
redemption.
Um,
what was I going to say?

557
00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.260
The fuck was that.
Oh,
I sat next to this lady,
this lady,

558
00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:40.330
if you guys think that I'm a bad singer,
um,
which admittedly I am

559
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.670
the fucking,
uh,
the lady I was sitting next to,

560
00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.440
she sat next to me and she goes,
uh,

561
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:53.990
told me she just came from a George Thorogood concert.
She goes,
yeah,

562
00:33:53.991 --> 00:33:58.280
he just turned 63,
which really made me feel old.
I'm like,
Oh yeah,
how was he?

563
00:33:58.281 --> 00:34:03.110
So he goes,
oh,
he was great.
And then she goes,
she goes,
one whiskey,

564
00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:05.180
wine,
Scotch,
and one beer.

565
00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:11.790
First of all,
she didn't even get the words right.
It's one bourbon,
one scotch,

566
00:34:11.791 --> 00:34:16.470
one beer,
and it's,
I don't even,
she wasn't even tone deaf.

567
00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:18.690
She just,
for some reason couldn't remember the melody.

568
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:22.350
How do you not know that that's like one of his biggest fucking hits off that

569
00:34:22.351 --> 00:34:25.860
cover song,
right?
Juan Bourbon Watch guards.

570
00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:30.480
[inaudible] Albert Abdul Pardot,
right?
One.

571
00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:33.630
Once you go one whiskey wine,
Scotch,
one be here.

572
00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.450
I think she clapped as she was doing it to one whiskey.

573
00:34:40.451 --> 00:34:44.080
One's got you one beer.
Anyway,

574
00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:48.400
if like if I could have just fucking skydived onto the plane at that point I

575
00:34:48.401 --> 00:34:51.650
would have,
it was so fucking horrific.
Um,

576
00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.950
and she had a dog.
She had a dog with their little dock sound.

577
00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.480
She had fucking drugged it up.
Jesus Christ.
This dog was freaking out.

578
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.680
It had this fucking fear and look in its eye all I got a bad feeling,
man.

579
00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.430
I was so glad she told me that she drugged it up,
but I,

580
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:09.910
because if she didn't tell me,

581
00:35:09.911 --> 00:35:12.610
she dragged it up and I saw that look in that poor dog's eyes,

582
00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:16.060
I would have thought that it knew the plane was going to crash.
You know,

583
00:35:16.061 --> 00:35:19.290
they always say that like dogs and dogs can,

584
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.350
they can sense of fucking earthquake.
It's so fucking dumb.

585
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:28.510
Can they really sense an earthquake or do they just hear it before we do because

586
00:35:28.511 --> 00:35:30.390
they have better hearing the of that,

587
00:35:30.391 --> 00:35:34.660
these dumb youtube videos of the dog sensing it and it like senses it like

588
00:35:34.661 --> 00:35:38.880
fucking six seconds before people do.
That's not sensing it.

589
00:35:38.881 --> 00:35:42.690
That's just your fucking laying on the floor and you're not wearing any clothes.

590
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:44.850
So you felt the vibrations before?

591
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:48.750
I did because I'm sitting in a chair wearing shoes.
You know,
if it

592
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:55.200
really fucking good sense it common,
it would have fucking,

593
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.560
you just see it one day just packing a suitcase and putting on,

594
00:35:58.561 --> 00:36:02.520
it's fucking bing Crosby fedora.
And you'd be like,
Hey,
lucky.
Where are you going?

595
00:36:02.521 --> 00:36:07.290
And just be like,
Listen Matt,
you know,
I know I've just a dog.

596
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.430
I don't wear clothes.
I can't drive a fucking car.

597
00:36:10.431 --> 00:36:13.740
But I'm telling you it would be in your best interest to follow me right now

598
00:36:13.741 --> 00:36:16.050
into the wilderness.
They never do that.

599
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:21.930
They just go off like fucking five seconds before you do and then they just

600
00:36:21.931 --> 00:36:25.260
start running.
They don't stand in a doorway.

601
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.533
You know what it is?

602
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.060
Dogs get fucking hyped up because people have been hurt by other people.

603
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:34.380
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

604
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:39.290
<v 2>You know,
and at some point they just,
you know,
they want dog,</v>

605
00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:42.630
like they like dog.
People wish that people would act like dogs.

606
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:47.940
Just always be excited,
always be happy.
Never call them on their shit.

607
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.380
You know,
just always freak out when I fucking come home.
Always do that.

608
00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:56.460
Always be in a good mood.
And I gotta admit I'm one of those dog people.

609
00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:59.520
I actually do this thing with Nia,
right?

610
00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.310
I come home from the airport and I called her and I,
and I,

611
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.230
I make sure that she has the dog like in another room so it can hear me coming

612
00:37:09.231 --> 00:37:13.310
up the walk.
Right.
It always ends up right as I get to the walk,
you know,

613
00:37:13.311 --> 00:37:15.470
to head up to the house that doesn't have air conditioning.

614
00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:19.300
[inaudible] skin standalone unit.
Um,

615
00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:21.680
<v 0>okay.</v>

616
00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.000
<v 2>And then she just goes,
the second the dog stops cause it,
here's me,</v>

617
00:37:26.001 --> 00:37:29.510
close the door to the car.
She always goes,
she just looks at dawn goes,

618
00:37:29.511 --> 00:37:34.160
who's that?
Who's that?
Cleo is that Daddy.

619
00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.790
And then she fucking freaks.
And I hear a nails.

620
00:37:37.791 --> 00:37:41.000
Is she trying to run across the hardwood floors?
Fucking slip.
Slide.

621
00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:46.340
She fucking comes.
Just a ball of fucking muscle.
Come fly as to greatest.

622
00:37:46.341 --> 00:37:50.090
It's the greatest fucking,
it's almost why I do the road.

623
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.400
Just to watch her freak the fuck up.
You're no.

624
00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:54.260
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

625
00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:58.550
<v 2>I feel like the teen idols sensation when I come home.
Ah,
Jesus.
People.</v>

626
00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:00.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

627
00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:04.640
<v 2>Where Joe to Rosa this weekend?
Where is that?</v>

628
00:38:04.641 --> 00:38:08.390
Kooky Egyptian.
All right,
let's go here.
All right.

629
00:38:08.391 --> 00:38:12.650
College broads college broads a bill.

630
00:38:12.651 --> 00:38:15.980
I'm a freshman in college right now and I've never seen so many good looking

631
00:38:15.981 --> 00:38:20.450
ladies in one place,
in my entire life off.
And they're all single.

632
00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.610
None of them are married.
They don't have any kids.

633
00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.960
Bang them before they get fucking crazy.
Um,

634
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.760
what do we got here?
He says,

635
00:38:28.761 --> 00:38:32.570
the problem is that I have trouble flirting with the ladies because I always get

636
00:38:32.571 --> 00:38:35.320
anxious around them.
How can I start talking them?

637
00:38:35.321 --> 00:38:38.920
Because I don't think I'll ever have an opportunity to meet hot girls like this

638
00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:40.440
again in my life off.
Dude,

639
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:44.920
do you realize what a what a what a fucking in the moment.

640
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.030
Smart analysis that is.
You're absolutely right.

641
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:54.340
You're at like,
if you're at the club 24 fucking seven,
you live in with them.

642
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.960
All right?
This is like the NFL combine of Pussy.

643
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.680
So start fucking,
you know,

644
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:07.660
get out your clipboard and pick a winner.
All right,
don't go Ryan Leaf.

645
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:12.460
Go drew Bledsoe.
Um,
I don't know Rick Meyer,

646
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:16.170
that's who Seattle picked.
Um,
the pro.
What am I,

647
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.610
how can I still how girls,
but both the Duh,
Duh.
Um,

648
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:23.080
and have you been around so many hot girls like this again in my life,

649
00:39:23.081 --> 00:39:27.430
so I don't make one.
I'll make the most out of these next four years for,

650
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.240
for,
uh,

651
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.190
what is the best way to start meeting these college hotties while I still have

652
00:39:33.191 --> 00:39:35.950
the chance?
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Don't,

653
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.030
there's only one way to learn how to talk to ladies.
The ladies,

654
00:39:40.031 --> 00:39:44.470
you just got to start doing it.
Okay.
And give yourself permission to suck at it,

655
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.430
you know,
to,
to,
uh,
suck at it to suck at it.
It's just like,

656
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:51.070
it's just like doing comedy.
It's like learning how to swim.

657
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.220
They just throw in the deep end.
You start kicking.
That's all you do.

658
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.990
Don't kick the women.
That's not what I'm saying.

659
00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.740
It was a bad fucking metaphor there.
Or similarly,
similarly,
like Arrez no,

660
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:05.740
it was a metaphor.
No I didn't.
I didn't say hitting on women is swimming.

661
00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:10.840
I said it's like swimming.
Oh,
shut the fuck up bill.
Um,
yeah,

662
00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:14.380
just start hitting on him.
You know what?
Just,

663
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.990
what is it?
How do you,
how do you,
how do you fucking drop in?

664
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.290
You know what it is?
You're going to figure out what works for you.

665
00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:27.160
You're got to fit.
You're going to figure out,
hey,
do you have a sense of humor?

666
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.960
You know what I mean?
That's always great if you can make them laugh.
If you know,

667
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.990
I dunno,
we just,
I,
there's,
there's no way.
There's no way.
There's no way.

668
00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:41.770
You just have to fucking go do it.
All right?
And if you stand there on the wall,

669
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:42.990
<v 4>go,
Gee,
GOP,</v>

670
00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:50.670
<v 2>you know what?
Some dose who's probably not,
you know,</v>

671
00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:54.610
isn't going to bring as much to the table as you are.
Right.
He,
the,

672
00:40:54.611 --> 00:40:58.890
it's those assholes who just walk up to them and they just,
hey,

673
00:40:58.891 --> 00:41:03.420
what do you say to a perfect text?
Uh,
just fucking with you.
Don't be like that.

674
00:41:03.421 --> 00:41:04.171
Let me get you a drink.

675
00:41:04.171 --> 00:41:06.240
And they put them in a headlock and they drag them up to the bar.

676
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:09.870
Those guys end up fucking them.
I mean,
that's an oversimplification.

677
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.033
And then people like

678
00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.530
<v 4>if you,
he may give it a review.
They do.</v>

679
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:18.170
You've really biggest pages the world

680
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:21.780
<v 2>right
now.
What happens?</v>

681
00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.310
He goes out and does what you're going to go home and jerk off to.

682
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.430
So what do you want to do,
sir?

683
00:41:27.431 --> 00:41:30.510
Do you want to live in a fantasy world or do you want to live in reality?

684
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.520
Just go up and talk to them.

685
00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.280
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

686
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:42.050
<v 2>just do it.
I don't know.
Do something,
just be fucking,
you know,
obnoxious.</v>

687
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:44.300
Just any,
anything.
Just try different things.

688
00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.610
Try going up there and saying something.
Ron Burgundy,
which say,

689
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:51.830
you know your own,
I'm kind of a big deal.
Anything,

690
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.920
anything to get them fucking laughing,
right?

691
00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.400
Something.
But for the love of God,
get off the fucking wall.
Um,

692
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:05.090
sleepwalked banging a Billy boy.

693
00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:08.690
I need some advice for something I can guarantee you haven't gotten an email

694
00:42:08.691 --> 00:42:11.930
about before.
This one is personal.
It's not really,
what are you hoping?

695
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:15.950
Your fucking God damn thing.
Just get to it.
All right.
Over the last year,

696
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:19.760
I have discovered that I engage in sleepwalking behavior.

697
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.500
The most hilarious part of it.

698
00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:25.160
I think fucking Mike Birbiglia wrote a whole one man show that's now a movie

699
00:42:25.161 --> 00:42:27.500
about this.
So I really don't think you're breaking new ground,

700
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:30.560
although I'll give you the,
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

701
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:35.810
The most hilarious part of it is that I engage in sleep,

702
00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:39.750
sex.
Okay.

703
00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:43.770
You know what?
Go Fuck Yourself.
Do you think I'm dumb enough to believe this?

704
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.480
You're either just making this shit up or you're a fucking pervert and you're

705
00:42:48.481 --> 00:42:52.430
going around basically sexually assaulting other people.
And then,
ah,

706
00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:57.510
I was asleep.
Sorry that I put my dick on your lip.

707
00:42:57.511 --> 00:43:01.530
All at my fault.
I was sleeping.
Um,
anyways,
let,
let's,

708
00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.430
let's just,
you know,
to fill up the hour.
I'm going to read the rest of this,

709
00:43:05.431 --> 00:43:08.850
but I'm already calling bullshit cause I been with my girlfriend for four years

710
00:43:08.851 --> 00:43:10.470
now and we're both 22 years old.

711
00:43:10.471 --> 00:43:14.760
We share a room in a house together with other housemates and let me guess,

712
00:43:14.761 --> 00:43:17.190
you wander in and accidentally fucked somebody else.

713
00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:18.120
Is that what you're gonna tell me?

714
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:21.780
Is that really where this fucking email is going to go?
Um,

715
00:43:21.781 --> 00:43:25.560
I've found out that if we don't have sex at least once every two days,

716
00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:29.790
I will basically begin to perform sex acts on her while I sleep.

717
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.240
Dude,
you are so full of fucking shit.

718
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.410
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

719
00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:39.850
<v 2>I will have absolutely no memories of these.
Here's his out.
Oh,</v>

720
00:43:39.851 --> 00:43:44.200
did I fucking finger bang you with my Dick in your ass.
Sorry.
I was sleep.

721
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:47.440
Sleep's automizing.
Um,

722
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.150
I will have no memorize memories of these in the morning unless I wake up during

723
00:43:51.151 --> 00:43:51.984
the act.

724
00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:57.170
My girlfriend says that my eyes are open but totally glazed over when I do it.

725
00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.660
The most common one is that I will go down on her.

726
00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:07.020
This is so fucking stupid.
You're asleep.

727
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:08.940
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

728
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:13.580
<v 2>You're asleep and you're dreaming,
right?
Your eyes are open,
but you're,</v>

729
00:44:13.581 --> 00:44:18.450
you're still like in rem sleep and you're somehow pulling the covers off.

730
00:44:18.451 --> 00:44:23.310
Fine.
What are you a fucking Zombie?
I,
you know,

731
00:44:23.311 --> 00:44:26.470
I'm not reading the rest of this.
This is the most ridiculous fucking die.

732
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.890
But you know what?
Maybe this people interested,
I'll keep reading.

733
00:44:28.891 --> 00:44:32.040
This is the dumbest thing that sounds like a Scott movie from the

734
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.840
<v 1>Ert list.
Was this the original draft of zapped?
Um,</v>

735
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.310
somebody 43 years old,

736
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:42.170
just fucking did a spit take on the dashboard with that reference.
Um,

737
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:48.530
what the hell am I?
I have also fingered her as well.

738
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:51.763
Stupid.

739
00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:58.650
The one that I am least proud of is that I apparently licked my own TJ's offer

740
00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:02.530
boobs after all,
after coming

741
00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:08.730
capital letters all in my sleep.
Dude,

742
00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.610
this is the most bizarre fucking thing I've ever read.

743
00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:17.560
My girlfriend is actually really cool about it.
Hey,
you asleep and it's fine,

744
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.240
honey.
Go like this.
No.
On the other side.
Yeah.
Yet.

745
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:23.390
You had a little more over there.
Uh,
at this.

746
00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:27.310
At first she'll be really startled because she is sleeping too.

747
00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:30.790
If I'm going down are in my sleep,
she generally,

748
00:45:30.791 --> 00:45:33.220
let's keep going until she comes.

749
00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:36.520
I'll usually wake up as she's coming,

750
00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:42.250
we'll have sex and we'll both go back to sleep.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

751
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.490
I swear to God people.
There's two more paragraphs of this shit.

752
00:45:45.491 --> 00:45:46.510
Do you want me to keep going?

753
00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:51.910
The scary part to me is the fear of not having control over my body and my

754
00:45:51.911 --> 00:45:52.570
actions.

755
00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:56.830
I'm scared because I have clearly shown my ability to perform complete tasks

756
00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:01.480
while being completely asleep and having absolutely no memory of them later.

757
00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.930
I'm afraid that one day I'll find myself waking up,

758
00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.850
driving my car down the highway.

759
00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:12.250
I haven't shown myself doing anything dangerous yet.
You haven't shown my,

760
00:46:12.251 --> 00:46:14.650
you haven't found yourself,
but who knows,
right.

761
00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:19.360
The only reason I do know about the times it has happened so far is because my

762
00:46:19.361 --> 00:46:21.370
girlfriend has been there to tell me it happened.

763
00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:26.410
Who knows what crazy shit I've done before I met her in my sleep that I'll never

764
00:46:26.411 --> 00:46:28.090
know about.
My girlfriend says,

765
00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:32.080
I'm just being paranoid and then I should let it be.
Wait a minute,

766
00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:36.580
you fucking came on your girlfriend's tits,
licked your own jazz off of him.

767
00:46:36.581 --> 00:46:39.520
And she's like,
Oh,
you're just being paranoid.

768
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:44.090
Is this the white chick from every fucking horror movie?

769
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.620
Um,
I don't think that noise is anything to be concerned about.
Um,

770
00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:55.940
um,
what would you do?
Would you go see a therapist or a doctor for this?

771
00:46:55.941 --> 00:47:00.230
So would you just let it go?
I really don't.
Don't,
yeah,
this is beyond,
he goes,

772
00:47:00.231 --> 00:47:02.450
I really don't want to be to go to a doctor with a bunch of pill.

773
00:47:02.451 --> 00:47:04.700
You know what I would email Mike Birbiglia.

774
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:09.560
I actually think I vaguely remember him talking about walking over to a window

775
00:47:09.561 --> 00:47:13.970
or something,
you know,
and doing something.

776
00:47:13.971 --> 00:47:17.240
I can't remember.
You know,
I don't,
I don't remember.

777
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.100
I would email him or why don't,
yeah,
why don't you fuck,
but yeah,

778
00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.390
go to another comedian now.
Fuck that.
Go.
Go talk to a professional.

779
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:25.003
<v 0>All right.</v>

780
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.070
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
If that's,</v>

781
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:34.510
<v 0>if that's real.
Is it real son?
Is it really real son?
Um,</v>

782
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.760
that's one of the big things in hip hop.
Everybody's got it.
Yo.
This is real.

783
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.233
This is real.

784
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.090
This is like the cities where it's like,
dude,

785
00:47:46.091 --> 00:47:50.860
it's all real me laying on a bed right now doing a podcast in Jacksonville

786
00:47:50.861 --> 00:47:55.780
that's also real.
Everything's real son.
Um,

787
00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.770
yeah.
If,
if it's actually going on.
Yeah,
man,
I don't,
I don't know.

788
00:47:58.771 --> 00:48:00.750
I don't know what to tell you.
Okay.

789
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:05.080
<v 1>Um,
anyways,
my girlfriend is blackmailing me.
Jesus Christ.
Dear bill,</v>

790
00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:09.280
my ex girlfriend and I were together for two months before she wanted to watch

791
00:48:09.281 --> 00:48:12.980
porn with me.
I was all hyped thinking that she was perfect and I,

792
00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:17.060
and she said she picked the porno.
I didn't want to make a run comfortable.

793
00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:18.010
The five ticked it.
Dude,

794
00:48:18.011 --> 00:48:20.290
that's a good thing because if you're too far down the road,

795
00:48:20.291 --> 00:48:24.940
you're going to fuck up the whole thing.
So that was actually a very smart move.

796
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.530
Kudos to you young man.
Um,
he goes tonight.
We did,

797
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:33.820
she turned on the video and it was a cartoon getting raped by a,

798
00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.010
by a tentacle monster.

799
00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:40.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

800
00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:44.410
<v 1>And did an ORC or see,
I don't know what the fuck that is.</v>

801
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:47.710
I'm not in this world.
Um,

802
00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:52.740
I was disgusted and turned it off immediately and stop having sex with her.

803
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:53.800
I'll see.

804
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.370
You guys were having sex and then she turned on this fucking horrific cartoon.

805
00:48:59.340 --> 00:48:59.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

806
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:03.430
<v 1>Okay.
I've seen those.
I've never watched one.</v>

807
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:07.940
I've seen those.
When you go through,
I've seen like the cartoons.

808
00:49:07.941 --> 00:49:11.810
When I go on the fuck,
I want to watch people banging.
I don't want to see like,

809
00:49:11.811 --> 00:49:16.340
you know,
shaggy banging fucking,
what's her name?

810
00:49:16.341 --> 00:49:21.290
Daphne.
Who was the hot one?
Um,
anyways,

811
00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.960
I was disgusted and turned it off immediately.
Stop having sex with her.

812
00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:26.600
She isn't some Geek.
She's super hot.

813
00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.870
She started crying saying that I didn't have an open mind.

814
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:33.890
I left and broke up with her damn at school.

815
00:49:33.891 --> 00:49:38.480
She spread it around that I was the one that shows the video.
Oh,

816
00:49:38.481 --> 00:49:42.170
there's Versie a Versie.
I'm wrapping up my podcast.

817
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.333
<v 0>Okay.</v>

818
00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:49.160
<v 1>Farsi.
I'm wrapping up my podcast.</v>

819
00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:50.533
<v 5>What's going on?</v>

820
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.440
<v 1>Not that I,
I'm,
I'm doing my podcast.</v>

821
00:49:55.940 --> 00:50:00.410
Jesus Christ.
Paul,
I'm wrapping it up.
I'm done one live right now talking to you.

822
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.440
Let me call you in like 12 minutes.
Hi.

823
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:08.830
Is there anything fucking people just can't get off the damn phone.
I gotta go.

824
00:50:08.831 --> 00:50:13.720
I gotta go.
Oh,
you got to go.
What are you going?
So anyways,

825
00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:18.520
uh,
she has some Geek.
She's super hot.
She started crying.
Okay.

826
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:21.490
So I broke up with her after school.

827
00:50:21.491 --> 00:50:24.760
She spread it around that I was the one that shows the video.

828
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:29.790
She then blackmailing me blackmailing me saying she'd stopped if we got back

829
00:50:30.951 --> 00:50:35.060
together.
Ah,
for fuck sakes,

830
00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.860
Joe to Rose's calling.
Ah,
Geez.
Joe,
I'm doing my podcast.

831
00:50:39.861 --> 00:50:44.590
Yukon's let me call you back in 10 minutes.
Ah,

832
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:50.070
go fuck yourself Joe.
Tell it to somebody else.
Um,

833
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.870
or the hell am I.
Uh,
so she's,

834
00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:58.670
she blackmailed me saying she'd stop if we get back together.

835
00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.790
She'd stop what she already told everybody.

836
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:03.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

837
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:06.920
<v 1>My friends say I should,
I should get back together with her because she's hot.</v>

838
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:12.620
That is the male brain at 20 years of age and that,

839
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:17.390
that I keeper getting teased.

840
00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:23.230
I can't you,
you fucked up that sentence.
Do it.

841
00:51:23.231 --> 00:51:25.240
I don't know if he deleted something.
He said,

842
00:51:25.241 --> 00:51:28.120
even teachers look at me differently.
What should I do?

843
00:51:28.121 --> 00:51:32.740
Minus throwing my 10 pound textbook at her head.
You know what?

844
00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:37.630
Look Dude,
you know the real story and it's going to be in your face.

845
00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:39.300
<v 0>Okay.</v>

846
00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.040
<v 1>When somebody comes up to you and was like,
Hey,</v>

847
00:51:41.041 --> 00:51:45.660
I heard you were watching that fucking a octopus raping that chick cartoon
video.

848
00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:48.930
You just look.
Just be like,
oh yeah.
Is that what you heard?

849
00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:53.550
Is that what she told you?
It'll,
why do you give a fuck?

850
00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.460
I know you want to give a fuck cause it's your world,
dude.

851
00:51:56.490 --> 00:52:00.900
The last thing you want to do is get together with her.
This is what you do.

852
00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:06.450
Call her.
Hey,
this is what you do.
Oh,
I got it.
Here's what you do.

853
00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:08.520
Here's what you do.

854
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:14.760
Why don't you just fucking record a phone conversation with her or have her come

855
00:52:14.761 --> 00:52:17.220
over?
All right.

856
00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.460
You fucking hit record on your fucking smartphone.

857
00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:26.070
You have a come in and just say,
listen,
I'm sorry I broke up with you.

858
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:30.750
I'd really like to get back together with you,
but you have to promise me,

859
00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:36.350
you will stop telling people that lie or whatever and you get it to admit it and

860
00:52:38.731 --> 00:52:41.610
then you just talk to her for 10 minutes.
Why are you,

861
00:52:41.611 --> 00:52:43.590
why do you think you're in to stuff like that?

862
00:52:43.591 --> 00:52:47.430
And He'd get it to admit the whole fucking thing and then in the end just go,

863
00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:52.400
you know what?
I just realized I don't want to get back together with,

864
00:52:52.401 --> 00:52:56.970
and you kick her out cause fuck her and her feelings at this point.
All right.

865
00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:00.960
And then you let us spread the fuck and rumor and then what you do is you just

866
00:53:00.961 --> 00:53:04.250
upload onto your fucking page,
the audio.

867
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:05.680
<v 0>Okay?</v>

868
00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:10.090
<v 1>Yeah.
And then you become fucking,
oh no,
no,
no,
don't do that.
Don't do that.</v>

869
00:53:10.091 --> 00:53:12.460
Cause then that,
that's all fucking mean.
This is what you do.

870
00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:18.520
You fucking hit stop and just say,
listen,
I'm gonna tell you something off.

871
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:20.710
Then the next day when you guys were allegedly together,

872
00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.990
you meet up with there in a coffee shop,

873
00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:26.240
like fucking Mickey Rourke in the end to fucking

874
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.670
<v 2>the pope of Greenwich Village.
And he say,
listen bitch,</v>

875
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:33.420
we're not getting together and you're going to stop saying that shit about me.

876
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.030
You know why?
Cause I got a tape,
a tape,

877
00:53:37.031 --> 00:53:40.150
I took off a dead cop and you fucking punch the side of her hand just like

878
00:53:40.151 --> 00:53:44.890
you're talking to Burt young.
Okay.
Then you put fucking lie in a coffee,

879
00:53:44.891 --> 00:53:48.280
Charlie.
No,
you don't do that.
That's what you do.
Just fucking recorder.

880
00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:52.610
And this is the thing.
Don't put it on your Facebook page.

881
00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:57.050
Just have it on your phone.
Okay.
And at any point,

882
00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.650
anybody comes up to you and says it,
just say,
Oh yeah,
listen to this.

883
00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:04.820
And then you play it for them and say,
there,
go fuck yourself.
And then that's it.

884
00:54:04.821 --> 00:54:08.780
And eventually it'll get back to her that you have that fucking recording and

885
00:54:08.781 --> 00:54:11.360
then she'll shut the fuck up.
But don't,

886
00:54:11.361 --> 00:54:14.750
don't put it on your Facebook page because then somehow there'll be some sort of

887
00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:18.410
cyber bullying and at the end of it she has a vagina and you have a dick.

888
00:54:18.411 --> 00:54:20.930
So somehow you'll end up being wrong.
You know,

889
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:23.420
because if there's one thing I've learned,

890
00:54:23.421 --> 00:54:28.421
the ladies are never wrong in the public eye because they can't bench press as

891
00:54:29.751 --> 00:54:34.190
much as us.
That's basically what it comes down to.
All right,
here we go.

892
00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:35.590
So that's what you do sir.

893
00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:38.330
Just pretend like you getting back together with her and then go into an in

894
00:54:38.331 --> 00:54:41.900
depth conversation about why she's into those videos and why she would go out

895
00:54:41.901 --> 00:54:45.830
and hurt you like that when you would never do something like that to her.
Okay.

896
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:50.490
Don't say you're going to get back together.
Just say,
I want to talk about this,

897
00:54:50.491 --> 00:54:51.480
I have to think about this.

898
00:54:51.481 --> 00:54:55.500
And just delve into all of that and ask her why she would do something like
that.

899
00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:58.230
And then in the end just be like,
you know,
I don't know.

900
00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.090
I need to think about this.

901
00:55:01.091 --> 00:55:04.830
And then you walk dramatically over to the window and she,
then she goes,

902
00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:07.880
this is that me,
where's it back together?
And then you go out,

903
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.510
just get out and then,

904
00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.570
then you got the tape and then you got an anybody gives you any shit.

905
00:55:13.571 --> 00:55:17.530
And just say,
I got audio of her talking about why she's into it.
All right.

906
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:21.270
And then call her and then call her.
I'm telling,
just say,
listen,

907
00:55:21.271 --> 00:55:23.850
I recorded that conversation last night.
So,
uh,
I,
I,

908
00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:27.120
it's in your best interest to shut the fuck up.
All right,

909
00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.490
so why don't you go find a squid,

910
00:55:29.491 --> 00:55:31.500
the shoving you're taught and leave me out of it.

911
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.360
And that's the news and nobody here.
I've bill,

912
00:55:36.361 --> 00:55:39.840
should I fly the coop and leave my boring boyfriend?

913
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:43.770
Yes,
absolutely.

914
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:47.400
That's it.
I don't even need to read it.

915
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:51.900
You're thinking about leaving because your boyfriend boards the shit out of you.

916
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:54.150
You know,
if you want longevity,

917
00:55:54.151 --> 00:55:57.040
you've got to have somebody that keeps your fucking heart going.
Pitter patter.

918
00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.610
Derris billion.
How's it going?

919
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.570
I'm a 30 to 32 year old lady and need some advice.

920
00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:09.260
I moved to a new place about a year ago to be with my boyfriend and everything

921
00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:11.220
with him is perfect.
We laugh a lot.

922
00:56:11.221 --> 00:56:14.460
The sex is great and rarely argue it's a dream.

923
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:19.800
My issue is where we live and who we live with.
Oh Shit.

924
00:56:19.801 --> 00:56:24.580
This has nothing to do with them.
See this,
this is why you read them.
Um,

925
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:30.420
<v 1>where the hell am I here?
Uh,
we laugh a lot.
Sex as bait beat,</v>

926
00:56:30.421 --> 00:56:33.820
but didn't do it.
My issue is,
is where we live and who we live with.

927
00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:38.880
I hate the area that we live in and my guts thinks we live in a paradise or my

928
00:56:39.821 --> 00:56:42.430
guy thinks we live in a paradise and doesn't want to move.

929
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:47.740
We also live with a mean ass relative of his that he is caring for.
Oh,

930
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:52.480
Jesus.
Oh Jesus.
Okay.
First of all,

931
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:56.020
I'm just going to say you're a saint for actually putting up with this,

932
00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:59.710
this law not being married to somebody and you're fucking with their goddamn

933
00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:04.510
enlarged some shit.
Um,
I help take care of this surly fuck too,

934
00:57:04.511 --> 00:57:07.600
but I'm over it.
I'm thinking about bailing ship.

935
00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.540
I feel bad about it because one,
who am I kidding?

936
00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:15.220
I'm old and the baby machine is ready for distribution to the guy I'm with is

937
00:57:15.221 --> 00:57:17.380
honestly the nicest person that I've ever met.

938
00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:21.430
Anything you in the lovely Nia can suggest would be appreciated.
By the way.

939
00:57:21.431 --> 00:57:24.700
Thanks for making the beginning of my week a little better.
Oh,
look at you.

940
00:57:24.701 --> 00:57:26.860
You're a sweetheart.
All right.
See love this guy.

941
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.800
You just have to sit down with them and just be,
listen sweetheart,

942
00:57:29.801 --> 00:57:32.860
we're better than this.
Okay.
You know,

943
00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.510
I hate living here.
It's the very least.

944
00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:41.830
I think you would be a lot happier if you could just not be living with the

945
00:57:41.831 --> 00:57:44.290
surly motherfucker.
You know?

946
00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:47.920
Is there any way you guys can live someplace nearby?

947
00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:52.390
Can you have that surly fuck like in a shed,
you know,

948
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.210
like that sling,
the sling blades,

949
00:57:55.211 --> 00:57:59.500
a brother that they buried in that hole in the backyard.
You know,
can you just,

950
00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:01.680
can you,

951
00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:05.030
can you go down to home depot and just buy some sort of fucking four walled

952
00:58:05.031 --> 00:58:09.710
structure with a roof and just stick that fucker in there with a,
a,
you know,

953
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:14.480
with an air conditioned wall unit.
Can we get a wall unit at least?

954
00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:19.730
Um,
yeah,
I don't think that,
you know,

955
00:58:19.731 --> 00:58:21.710
if you really love this guy,
you shouldn't leave them over this.

956
00:58:21.711 --> 00:58:23.420
But like if this guy loves you,

957
00:58:23.421 --> 00:58:26.060
you can actually sit down and have a conversation and just be like,
listen,

958
00:58:26.061 --> 00:58:29.510
I'm miserable.
You know,
if I was ever with Nia and she's just like,
listen,

959
00:58:29.511 --> 00:58:34.010
I fucking hate La.
I can't deal with this anymore.
I gotta get Outta here.

960
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:37.940
You know,
now she said,
I want to go live in Kansas.
I'd be like,
well,

961
00:58:37.941 --> 00:58:41.690
I don't think I could make a living out there and we need to talk,
but you know,

962
00:58:41.691 --> 00:58:45.680
she wants to go back to New York.
I would go back,
you know,
so who knows,

963
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:47.960
just have the conversation.
Have you had a conversation with them,

964
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:52.520
have the conversation,
see how it goes
and then fucking write me back.

965
00:58:52.521 --> 00:58:57.060
Let me know what's up.
All right.
That's it.
That's it.

966
00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:57.913
All right.

967
00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:02.400
Underrated comedy zone in Jacksonville already said that youtube video of the

968
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:07.320

Thank you to everybody.

978
00:59:48.611 --> 00:59:51.280
Came out to the shows.
I'm really looking forward to go to bed.

979

Go Bananas in Cincinnati my fucking hour.
