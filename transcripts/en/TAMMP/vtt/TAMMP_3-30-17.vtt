1
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.800
Pay.
What's going on is bill burn is time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.060
just before Friday,

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.360
Monday morning podcast and just checking in on you so I couldn't give you a big

4
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:11.881
one.

5
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:16.881
I fucked up my voice going all the way back to San Jose Cruz,

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.900
uh,
back the San Jose gigs.
I don't know what I did.
I know what I did.

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.410
I was imitating somebody yelling.
I was having too much fun.

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.800
I didn't come from my diaphragm and I fucking choked up and I just fucking blew

9
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.580
the voice out.
That's what I did.

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.080
I always sped the main rotor in my fucking throat is what happened.

11
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.540
So now I've got to go eat.
She,
you know,
I gotta drink a little shrill Coty,

12
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.570
you know.
Um,
anyways,
what's going on?
How are you guys doing?

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.831
You're feeling good.

14
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:51.300
I get energized and excited about the fucking weekend.

15
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.920
Um,
I've actually been working out finally.

16
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.050
I'm still eating like a fucking moron,

17
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:01.380
so I haven't been dropped that much weight,
but I feel better.

18
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.450
You know what it is?
I'm at this fucking age.
I swear to God.

19
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.480
I have one sip of this or one bite of that and it just fucks me.

20
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.290
It's unbelievable.
I swear to God,
if I didn't work out,
I would be like,

21
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.020
I would look like every other fucking moron walking around the mall.

22
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.920
That's all it is.

23
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.570
I'm really starting to believe that a lot of people now I was kid knew we shove

24
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:26.790
a bunch of cake down our throats.
I just,
I don't,

25
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:31.740
I don't know what the fuck it is.
I know.
It's just weird how I said that.

26
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.750
I eat like a fucking Olympian until about three,
four in the afternoon.

27
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.000
I work out like a soccer mom,
but I eat like a fucking Olympian,

28
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.590
cause my shoulders,
my shoulders coming around,
by the way.
Um,

29
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.600
so I'm doing like the elliptical and that type of shit,

30
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:53.340
but for the front up until about three,
I fucking kill it,
you know?

31
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.300
And then the weakness starts coming in like a fucking cold front,

32
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.770
like a rainstorm.

33
00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:03.120
The clouds started forming around three or three 30 in the afternoon and I feel

34
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:06.150
myself getting weak on,
come on bill,
come on.
Veggies,
veggies.

35
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:09.910
Fessy shoved down your pie hole.
Let's meet battening.

36
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.160
That's me putting fucking plywood over the windows.

37
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.770
You know,
before I do something stupid.
And then just,
you know,
I dunno,

38
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.500
I keep trying to do this thing where I'm going to be done eating around six

39
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:25.080
o'clock at night and then just drink waters the rest of the time.

40
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.220
And if I get hungry,

41
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.300
I'm just going to have a little bit of celery and I know salaries on the dirty

42
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:33.120
dozen list of fucking pesticides.

43
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:36.540
It's basically anything where they just spray it directly on like cantaloupes.

44
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:40.680
Good.
Cause they spray the shit on,
you know the fucking a Bola,

45
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.200
you know what I mean?
The AIDS virus,

46
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:45.720
whatever the fuck they do to keep the mosquitoes away,
they spray,

47
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.820
spray it right on the fucking candle of,

48
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.500
but it doesn't get to the part that you eat and you don't lick the outside of
it.

49
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.510
You know the way fat show licked is the bottom of the sneakers in the MTV cribs.

50
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:00.290
I will never get over that.
It's like dude,

51
00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:04.190
those were made in a sweatshop just cause you to walk around New York.

52
00:03:04.191 --> 00:03:09.110
And if you have no fucking idea,
don't get a tetanus shot job.
Um,

53
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.660
anyways,
uh,
the fuck was I talking about?
So salary,
you know,

54
00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:17.570
cause I'll spray it right on it cause it doesn't have a husk or whatever the

55
00:03:17.571 --> 00:03:19.400
fuck it is.
Um,

56
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.770
so this person tells you who go get organic salary,
salary,

57
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.420
salary,
just get our Kerrick salary.

58
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.740
I wanted it to be like lay,
how to fuck.

59
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.690
You don't know where the fuck any of this shit is.

60
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.760
I think it all comes from the same God damn farm.
And they go ahead,

61
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.770
get with that one looks greener than those ones.
Call them on organic.

62
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.770
That's about ready to go back and say that's organic.

63
00:03:45.771 --> 00:03:48.800
And they'll think that the reason why it's rotting is because,
uh,
you know,

64
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.660
because it's so fucking fresh.
I Dunno.

65
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.470
So at night I tried to do like the salary have just a little bit half a spoonful

66
00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:58.580
of sugar,
no half full,

67
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.500
half a spoonful of peanut butter to try to get me through and uh,
you know,

68
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.690
then you just go to bed like upset.

69
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.790
That's what happened.
If you're eating right,
you go to upset,

70
00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:18.510
you're not in a good mood.
All right.
Now,
a lot of fucking nutritionists,

71
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:22.430
dieticians,
fucking personal trainers,
fucking crossfitters and all that.

72
00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:24.460
It say like,
no,
if you read it,

73
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.270
you shouldn't feel hungry at all because you body will be full of all the new

74
00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:33.480
cheesy knees.
Any movie craving a,
shut the fuck up and get tight clothes.

75
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

76
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.600
<v 0>Dressing like a Goddamn Eczema to do fucking curls.</v>

77
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.710
Workout clothes at the dumbest,
stupidest shit.

78
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

79
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.680
<v 0>I was watching an old odd couple boto.</v>

80
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.390
<v 2>Ooh,
Ooh,
Ooh,
Ooh,</v>

81
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.170
Ooh,

82
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.320
<v 0>no.</v>

83
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.320
My favorite part of that song is when the horn section kicks in ballet to do,

84
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.470
to do bow
wow.

85
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.580
Back then when it was actually a fucking orchestra,

86
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.320
it wasn't some guy with a laptop fucking pumping his fist like he's going to

87
00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:13.620
reboot the Arsenio show for the third fucking time.
It wasn't like that.

88
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.820
It was actual,
it was somebody that practice the fucking Trump bomb.

89
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.870
<v 0>Since he was knee high fight and the dust bowl during the depression right</v>

91
00:05:23.871 --> 00:05:28.070
before fucking Pearl Harbor and he had to beat out 50,000 other Tuba players.

92
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.260
Everybody trying to put their own stamp on down,
but up buddy,

93
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.330
you know,
you sitting out there all fucking nervous.
No one,

94
00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:41.570
his dad's going to give him the belt if he doesn't fucking book it.
Right.

95
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

96
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.040
<v 0>He's on the other side of the door just listening to other people audition,</v>

97
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.810
you know,
it's like fuck the guy nailed it.

98
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.310
Um,
I was watching,
I'm getting off track here.
I was watching that show and uh,

99
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.490
Oscar,
yeah,

100
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.530
Oscar w had come from the gym and he just had on a gray sweatshirt and gray

101
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:08.570
sweatpants.
He didn't have to go in there all fucking aerodynamic.

102
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:11.420
Like he was doing a time trial in the Tour de France.

103
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.760
All of this fucking shit that Nike makes.
Who's kidding?

104
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:20.210
Who that children making the Nike factory,
you know,

105
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.020
before they tried to jump out the fucking window.
Or is that apple?

106
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:26.510
I have no idea.
It's all a legend.
I don't,
they did it.
You know,

107
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.460
it's fake news.
There's children are happy.

108
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.170
They put the nets outside the window because they enjoy jumping into them.

109
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.000
It's a religious holiday.
Um,
Oh God,
I gotta work on my Trump.

110
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.270
I got to work my Trump.
It's a whole you,
it's rough,
you know.
Um,

111
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.630
that's all the fuck you need now.
Everybody's got all,
they got all the fucking,

112
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.620
but he's walking around dressed like captain America.
Oh my God.

113
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:55.370
I saw a shit show at the mall yesterday.

114
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.300
An absolute fucking,
she was such a shit show.

115
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.560
I actually was looking around for someone to be trying to film me for my

116
00:07:03.561 --> 00:07:08.300
reaction.
Um,
I had gone to the mall again,
that's twice in a week.

117
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.500
I never go to the mall twice in a fucking week.

118
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.390
And this time I went to the grove.
Now if you don't,
if you don't live in La,

119
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.850
okay.
The Grove is basically,

120
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.050
it's like going to times square on New Year's Eve,
except it's a mall.

121
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.890
It's a fucking nightmare.
All right.

122
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.250
But I was going down there because I'm a man.

123
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.590
Um,
Deanna Adler,
Steven Adler's mom who wrote,
uh,

124
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.900
the wonderful book,
um,
well actually tragic book.
And then it comes out,

125
00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:43.820
this sucks,
you know,
it starts off with sunshine,

126
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.920
it gets really fucking cloudy for a couple hundred pages and then it comes out

127
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:53.590
again.
It's a great book.
Um,
called us sweet child of mine.
And,
uh,

128
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.070
she was doing a book signing as I said,
I was going to be down there and um,

129
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.660
you know,
so I went down there and the book signing was great.
And uh,
our son's,

130
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.440
uh,
Steven and Jamie came down.
That dude,
Steven Adler is fucking hilarious.

131
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.680
It was a huge crowd.
Thank you to everybody who showed up,

132
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:13.700
who listened to my podcast and went down there.
Um,
I think,
you know,

133
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:17.900
had a couple of Ammon podcast's listeners down there.
I ran into,
um,
through,

134
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:20.330
he was fucking killing,
killing,

135
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.830
say whatever he wanted to some woman in the crowd.
She's like,
Stephen,

136
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:28.910
do you remember me back in the day I used to stand out from the rainbow.

137
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:33.260
He's like,
I had,
I did I fuck you said that in Barnes and nobles.

138
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.780
Barnes and noble.
Is it,
I don't know.
I don't read Barnes and noble or nobles,

139
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:43.310
NBA Final Stanley Cup,
final Stanley Cup finals.

140
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:48.980
I can't remember.
And in this fucking bookstore,
in a microphone,
he said,
um,

141
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.391
just complete,

142
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:54.440
might be like a comedian that just didn't give a shit whether they ever work the

143
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:59.210
club again,
it fucking amazing.
And uh,
he absolutely destroyed and uh,

144
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.050
and they sold a bunch of books.
So a order one today,

145
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.760
it's an incredible read,
man.
I'm telling you,
it's fucking brutal.

146
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.080
It's fucking like if you already read his,
his w.
Dot.
Stevens was brutal enough.

147
00:09:12.081 --> 00:09:15.410
But now to hear the mother's side going through the pain to try and help them

148
00:09:15.411 --> 00:09:17.900
out.
I tell you,
I'm going to be honest with you,
I haven't gotten through it yet.

149
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.430
So fucking brutal.
It is.

150
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.870
I just got into the part where Stephen starts going off the rails and I'm just

151
00:09:23.871 --> 00:09:28.760
like,
Oh man,
I gotta go like one chapter at a time.
Um,
in other words,

152
00:09:28.761 --> 00:09:32.510
she pulls no punches.
So,
uh,
definitely check that out if you can.
So anyways,

153
00:09:32.511 --> 00:09:37.430
back to this shit show.
So I'm going to the mall,
right?

154
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.050
And,
uh,
I pull in,
I valet,
right?

155
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.520
I valet like a fucking big shot because this is our,
this is to two things.

156
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.280
Or I don't give a fuck.
I'm usually a frugal content.
All right?

157
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.710
My Malcolm young tee shirt,
right.

158
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.340
And I don't spend any fucking money cause I know how this business works.
Right?

159
00:09:58.341 --> 00:10:02.060
When you go out,
you buy something flashy.
It said,
look at him,
look at him,

160
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.080
look at that.
Freckled can,

161
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.010
he thinks he made it and then they come over and walk in here and get right out

162
00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:11.000
from underneath.
That's not how I'm going out.
Uh Huh.
Not,
not me.
Nope.

163
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.260
I'm going to buy some strip malls.

164
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.370
I'm going to start having some money coming in from outside of this.

165
00:10:18.371 --> 00:10:20.050
Va gave me Hollywood.

166
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:25.840
It was getting home.
It's gonna be a sad ending just like everybody else's.

167
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.230
You know,
I'll come walking out one day on some fucking telethon,
you know,

168
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.520
my jaw fucking quivering uncontrollably and you guys all going to be like,
oh,

169
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.380
what have I used to be so young,
right?

170
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.120
And all you guys will have to shut it off because I'll look so bad.

171
00:10:43.121 --> 00:10:47.690
It's going to remind you of your own mortality right there.
You Gulf,

172
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.010
there is something to look forward to this weekend.
Sorry.
Anyways,

173
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.490
plowing ahead here.
Um,
so I'm walking to them,
to the mall,
okay.

174
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.990
And a half shirts or back or as they call them,
crop tops.

175
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.330
All the ladies,

176
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.230
all the ladies who fucking eat right or wearing them,

177
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.360
you know what I mean?

178
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.230
And I'm sure the fatties at some point are going to hate them and say that those

179
00:11:11.231 --> 00:11:15.550
crop tops are sexist and you're creating an impossible body image and they're

180
00:11:15.551 --> 00:11:16.570
going to blame those women.

181
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.600
Then actually took the time to fucking push themselves away at five o'clock and

182
00:11:23.591 --> 00:11:27.380
just sit there eating celery and shit past that.
Drinking waters,

183
00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.160
hating themselves.
You know,

184
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.990
here's all the people that are going to resent the crop tops where they,
huh?
Oh,

185
00:11:34.991 --> 00:11:38.170
they're sitting there having a great fucking time to get gelato.
Well,

186
00:11:38.171 --> 00:11:39.004
this side of caution,

187
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.680
that's something fat people do.
You know,

188
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.960
I'm fucking blowing up this spot.
I lived with a fatty,
I do.
I'm telling you,

189
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:56.840
I have fat,
French,
okay.
All of that shit.
All of those ice creams that you see,

190
00:11:56.841 --> 00:12:01.340
those unholy matrimony is of fucking candy bars in ice cream.

191
00:12:01.341 --> 00:12:04.880
Like who the fuck thought of that out?
The fact people,

192
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:10.710
people,
fat people,
you don't have EA,
right?

193
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.260
They all came up with that shit.

194
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:17.810
They all came up with that shit late at fucking night.
They're like junkies.
Okay.

195
00:12:17.811 --> 00:12:21.620
And what happens is,
is after a while doing heroin isn't enough.

196
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.680
You got to put a little coke in there and then you got to speed balling.

197
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.880
So the fat fucking person speedball is when you're taking you,

198
00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:32.120
if you need to get fat.
He listened to us,
you know,
it's fucking true.
You know,

199
00:12:32.121 --> 00:12:36.560
you shouldn't be doing it.
You know,
you're excited.
You know you're excited,
right.

200
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.420
When you know you got the ice cream at home,
right?

201
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.000
And you stopped at the red light and you look over to the left and has that

202
00:12:41.001 --> 00:12:45.080
seven 11 right?
And that demon in you just goes,
hey,

203
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.650
and you're driving there and go guys zag that bar.

204
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.070
You had vanilla ice cream at home.

205
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.680
I was kind of playing and he's need to take it up a notch bond.

206
00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.920
You know what you want to do it,
you know you start crying.

207
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.750
Well the same you Alexis,
just to up the ice cream man.

208
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.850
I said make a left turn,

209
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.070
drive in there and get her truck not bar and you fucking turn in there and you

210
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:13.630
buy the fucking thing.
Right?

211
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.790
Like you going in there to rent a porn back in the nineties and element of
shame.

212
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.270
You don't want to make eye contact but you don't want to look away.
You know,

213
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:26.230
cause they got a couple of shit films in there.
You know,
you got to have that.

214
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:29.050
Maybe I'm going to rent sleepless in Seattle.
Look on your face,

215
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.490
right as you walk into the porn shop,

216
00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:34.780
except it's a seven 11 and you walk in past all the other fatties and the

217
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:35.614
fucking people,

218
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.190
you know the junkies buying those fucking hot dogs that have been there since

219
00:13:39.191 --> 00:13:41.920
fucking Ronald Reagan got shot.
Right.

220
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:46.300
<v 1>You fucking go in there.</v>

221
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.100
<v 0>Probably grab a couple of healthy things like maybe one of their fucking
bananas.</v>

222
00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:55.510
It's still green.
You know the hand of the kid that picked it,

223
00:13:55.511 --> 00:13:57.640
you know his fingerprints is still fucking on it,
right?

224
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.300
Then you just walk right up to the cash register at the last second.

225
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:03.400
You try to make it seem like it's,
you know,

226
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.890
it would lead pretty old and you've got to be uh,
yeah,
I'll

227
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:09.450
write.

228
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.590
Then you get the fucking stag net bar and then you take that fucking thing home.

229
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.480
Right?
Driving home now excited while hating yourself.

230
00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:21.890
Excited.
Passing over the Double Line into your fucking house,
right?

231
00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.400
You put on fucking Netflix and then you sit down and what are you do?

232
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.820
You got to take the ice cream out now this part's the hardest.
It's killing you.

233
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.460
You got to let the ice cream melt a little bit,
right?

234
00:14:31.461 --> 00:14:35.060
So you can fucking kill him.
That God damn candy bar right in there.
Right?

235
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.810
That's what fatty still,
I don't want,
I'm talking about here,

236
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.510
so I'm at the fucking mall.
Okay,
I've got to fill up a half hour.
Okay.

237
00:14:41.511 --> 00:14:44.550
I gotta have some tangents here.
You know,

238
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.980
you want to do a half hour with no material,

239
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:48.780
<v 1>okay?</v>

240
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.240
<v 0>You want to try to fill it up?
Malaria.
Um,</v>

241
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.560
so anyways,
so I'm walking through so this fucking,
you know,

242
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.530
this is another person that I can't stand,
you know,

243
00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:01.090
cause I'm so God damn perfect.
Right.

244
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.800
The fucking person just refuses to admit that they're old.
You know,

245
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.650
I don't mean like just two year old,
just go sit there on the fucking couch.

246
00:15:08.651 --> 00:15:10.610
I don't mean that,
you know,
definitely get out there,
you know,

247
00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:14.470
get yourself Samir Butt,
you know,
put on some sunscreen.
You old fuck.
Okay.

248
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.500
The people that you pass a certain age and they're still trying to keep up with

249
00:15:19.901 --> 00:15:23.030
young people with the styles and shit.
I saw this woman,
right?

250
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.040
Tragic try from fucking 80 yards.

251
00:15:27.041 --> 00:15:31.270
You could tell there was no father ever in her life.
Okay.
Which is sad,

252
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.980
but you know,
at some point you get off,

253
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.920
you got to put your tits Awaiz ways and you got to look in the mirror and just

254
00:15:35.921 --> 00:15:39.430
be like,
look,
all right,
so he wasn't there.
Fuck that guy.
He was a piece of shit.

255
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:43.270
I'm worth something.
This lady did not have that.
Okay.
She's fucking walking.
Okay.

256
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.690
She is like,
I don't know what age she was.

257
00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.600
She should have been 33.

258
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:54.690
There's something about her said 33 but she looked like 47 and she was in good

259
00:15:55.511 --> 00:16:00.340
shape for her fucking A's,
but she's wearing the crop top.

260
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.810
Okay.
And she's doesn't have a flat stomach.

261
00:16:04.811 --> 00:16:09.160
She has just that little bit of of,
uh,
it's caught belly or whatever you call it.

262
00:16:09.161 --> 00:16:11.050
Right?
So it's hanging over in the front,

263
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.370
it's hanging on the bag and she's wearing a fucking crop top and the crop top

264
00:16:15.371 --> 00:16:16.780
said bitch on it.

265
00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.350
She's wearing these little short shorts and he's fucking high heels.

266
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:24.521
And you know,
you know,

267
00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:28.650
the ladies sheets after fucking three decades is sticking yourself in horseshoe.

268
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.990
So you feed a beat up,
you know,
you see like the heels,

269
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.860
there's like those white circles from like no blood supply and shit.

270
00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:38.890
And it's just like,
oh my God,
get yourself a player of flat shoes.

271
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.540
You know,
I'll put on a sport coat and you,
you,
you put on like some,

272
00:16:43.541 --> 00:16:48.310
something flowing.
You did your title,
like young people be young.

273
00:16:48.311 --> 00:16:52.000
So she fucking walks by.
And,
uh,
I dunno,

274
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:57.100
the only excuse I can make was maybe she was a hooker.
She was a hooker.

275
00:16:57.101 --> 00:17:01.000
I don't have a problem with it.
God bless her.
You know what I mean?
If she had it,

276
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:05.080
she had a,
uh,
a fucking,
I don't know what you'd call it.
A God damn.

277
00:17:05.081 --> 00:17:08.530
I'm charity I would give to it,
but if she's just a regular fucking person man,

278
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.260
shit show.
Right.
And once again,

279
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.340
half the reason why she was driving me nuts is it just reminded me of how old I

280
00:17:15.341 --> 00:17:17.780
was.
I was like,
uh,

281
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:21.490
I am old enough that I was alive when that woman was still high.

282
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:26.950
<v 3>Okay.</v>

283
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.140
<v 0>I'm not going to apologize for any of this shit if you're going to walk out,</v>

284
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.710
okay?
You got to know your age.
All of these fucking,
you know,
you don't.

285
00:17:33.711 --> 00:17:37.820
People tell you that,
you know,
you know mean fifty's the new 40,
you know,

286
00:17:37.821 --> 00:17:42.470
fucking says that 50 year olds,
no,
50,
50,
put some fucking clothes on.

287
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.990
Um,
dark.
Geez,
I'm on a fucking tangent here.
Not a rant.

288
00:17:47.991 --> 00:17:50.010
It's not a rant.
Don't even,
it's a fucking rant.

289
00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:53.800
All you guys have ruined that word rant.
Rant is your complete.

290
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.920
You're barely holding your shit to get a rant.

291
00:17:55.921 --> 00:17:59.760
Goes with raving like hall and Oates.
Rant and raving.

292
00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.070
All right.
This whole thing that,
hey,

293
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:06.150
he talked about the same subject and he reasonably calm tone for the last

294
00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:09.990
fucking seven minutes.
He's on a rant.
You don't,
you don't see no defines it.

295
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:13.410
That fucking millennials.
And you know why that is?

296
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:17.040
Cause they wear helmets when they ride bicycles and they had play dates and they

297
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:20.170
had helicopter parents so they didn't,
didn't even know what yelling is.

298
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:22.723
God help us.

299
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.620
God help us when Isis that doesn't have a plane or a boat somehow figures out

300
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.340
how to fucking get over here from the other side of the world,
you know,

301
00:18:31.341 --> 00:18:34.610
in their pajamas or whatever the fuck it is they're doing over there.
Okay.

302
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.330
God help us when they show up in the millennials have to fight them,
you know,

303
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:44.060
Jesus Christ.
Anyways,
so here's a good school.
Good side of it.

304
00:18:44.061 --> 00:18:47.540
Aside from the fact that DNA ads are sold a bunch of fucking books.
Um,

305
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.370
there's a store over there out of Detroit,
Michigan and it's called Shinola.

306
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:53.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

307
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.090
<v 0>So I'm going,
Shane,
I immediately,</v>

308
00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.360
I got to go in there because of that old school expression.
My Dad always said,

309
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:03.380
oh Christ,
that guy crazy.
He doesn't know shit from Shinola.

310
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.303
<v 1>Wow.</v>

311
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.540
<v 0>That was a great one.
That one of my,</v>

312
00:19:08.541 --> 00:19:10.520
another one of my favorite and my dad got to try sec.

313
00:19:10.521 --> 00:19:11.990
I could fuck up the free lunch.

314
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.860
Oh that one made me laugh every time you fucking said it.

315
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:26.460
Cause he always said it to the about the right person.
And then just,

316
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:27.600
just doing the math.

317
00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:31.050
Like what would you have to do to fuck up a free lunch where you can literally

318
00:19:31.051 --> 00:19:35.370
have the person,
you know what fuck you go somewhere else to get your food.

319
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.830
You know,
like what would you have to do?
The guy's giving you a free lunch,

320
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:41.370
what would you say to the guy other than thank you.
Anyways,

321
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:46.840
so there was an expression,
it was kind of a Midwest thing,
right?
I think a,

322
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:50.640
you don't know shit from Shinola,
not Shinola was a shoe Polish.

323
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.040
Uh,
that was in Michigan,
I believe outside of Detroit.
So the expression going,

324
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:59.130
you don't know shit from Shinola basically means you wouldn't know if he was

325
00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:02.220
shining your shoes with shoe Polish to shit.

326
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.180
It's basically saying you're a fucking moron.
So I'm like,
all right,
Shinola.

327
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:07.080
I got to go in there.

328
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.320
So I come walking in there and the first thing I say to the guy who was like,

329
00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:12.660
dude,
I had to come in here.
Are you familiar with the expression?

330
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.660
You don't know shit from Shinola?
He goes,
absolutely.

331
00:20:15.661 --> 00:20:18.510
That's how we came up with the name of this store.
So I have an alley.

332
00:20:18.511 --> 00:20:23.490
This company,
they make all these cool shit in America,
in Detroit,

333
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.690
a city that needs fucking industry,
great goddamn city,

334
00:20:27.691 --> 00:20:31.350
just waiting for someone to invest in it.
Um,

335
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.470
they make all of this stuff.
So I fucking go in there,
dude,

336
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.820
you got to look these things up,
man.
Um,

337
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.590
aside from all the watches and all the shit they had and they had these fucking

338
00:20:40.591 --> 00:20:45.140
bikes,
um,
you don't,
I'm actually gonna post the video and,
um,
and I,

339
00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.280
I say,
hey dean,
check this shit out because I was sending it the Dean del Rey,

340
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:51.620
cause Dean del Rey is,
is a,

341
00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.080
a a connoisseur of fine shit.
The man does not own a lot of shit,

342
00:20:56.081 --> 00:20:59.320
but the shit that he owns is fine.
She top of the line shit.

343
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.520
So they had bicycles in there and um,

344
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.260
they look like paperboard bikes from the 1950s,
you know,

345
00:21:07.261 --> 00:21:12.110
and I fucking did my time from third grade to ninth grade till I'd fuck.

346
00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.950
They did it all the way up to high school,
you know.
Um,

347
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.300
so I always liked those bikes even though they look corny too,
a lot of people,

348
00:21:19.301 --> 00:21:21.160
but it was all modern technology.

349
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.940
So when you quickly looked at it looked like a peewee Herman style fucking bike,

350
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.550
um,
with the bell and everything on it.

351
00:21:27.551 --> 00:21:30.820
But then it was all this state of the ass shit.
It's kind of like a resto mod,

352
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.610
but like a bicycle version.
And they had this one,

353
00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:38.530
it was like an 11 speed bike and all like the,
all the gear changing was like,

354
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.590
I can't explain where the fuck it was.
It was like a,

355
00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:44.140
I guess what you'd say the differential would be on a car.

356
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.530
But I'm just the part that it's usually just part of the wheel.

357
00:21:47.531 --> 00:21:48.400
All the gears were in there.

358
00:21:48.401 --> 00:21:50.500
I'm not enough of a gear head to explain this properly.

359
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:52.510
They had the wires going into the bike.

360
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.610
It was all like streamline had fucking disc brakes on the front and the back,

361
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:03.220
the things were crazy.
Crazy.
So,
um,
wait a minute,

362
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:07.990
I got the fucking pamphlet right here.
I swear to God,

363
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:08.261
if I,

364
00:22:08.261 --> 00:22:11.950
if I wasn't trying to downsize my life and they weren't so goddamn expensive,

365
00:22:11.951 --> 00:22:16.440
I would've fucking bought one.
Um,
can't do it.
These,

366
00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:18.160
these bikes,
they're really fucking,
you know,

367
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.010
a lot of you guys are going to think he's a nerdy looking bikes,

368
00:22:21.011 --> 00:22:23.860
but I think they're fucking sick.
They got one called the Detroit aero ones,

369
00:22:23.861 --> 00:22:28.120
the big SPI and one's the run.
Well.
Um,
and I'll tell you,

370
00:22:28.121 --> 00:22:31.720
I'll tell you the chief,
you know,
but uh,
the fucking sick man.

371
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.900
That's why I wished,
you know,
I don't know how it happened.

372
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.660
Part of it was because there was sweatshop labor and then you had the unions and

373
00:22:38.661 --> 00:22:42.460
then the unions became what the fucking cunts were.
And then everybody just said,

374
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:45.430
you know what?
Fuck you union.
And they just left the country would,

375
00:22:45.431 --> 00:22:47.530
wouldn't it be great if we just made shit in this country again?

376
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.610
I'm telling me we got to start with,
we'd all right.

377
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.240
They've got to legalize it on a fucking federal level and we should make the

378
00:22:55.241 --> 00:22:59.980
best fucking weed in the world.
We export that shit.

379
00:22:59.981 --> 00:23:03.580
You get the whole world,
you know,
fucking buy in our weed.
They got the best,

380
00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:06.580
like the,
like the White Cubans got the cigar thing locked down.

381
00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:09.070
We should do that with weed.
Okay.

382
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.890
The government should fucking stay out of it.

383
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.690
Just make it legal and walk away and then tax the shit out of it.

384
00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:17.530
Okay.

385
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.430
And have your eyes wide shut parties and fuck some other woman while you look at

386
00:23:21.431 --> 00:23:24.160
your wife getting bang by his senator,
whatever it is,

387
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:29.050
you upper 1% people fucking deal.
All right,
but just walk away from that Shit.

388
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.700
Let us grow the before.
Can we eat in the fucking world?
We export it.

389
00:23:33.701 --> 00:23:37.960
We make all that fucking money.
You get your fucking your skin with the tax,

390
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.020
right?
Send it to those costs over at the Federal Reserve,

391
00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:43.390
whatever the fuck it is they do.
And then you know,

392
00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:47.030
you pay off the war and then we just leave.
Right?

393
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.950
Just given the Tesla.
We just fucking will will drive those fucking cars.

394
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.590
Have the fucking blue blood constant run the oil industry.

395
00:23:57.591 --> 00:23:59.870
Just slide them over to the electrical shit.

396
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.700
They'll still make the same amount of money.

397
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.910
Then we don't have to be over in the Middle East sticking off fucking nose and

398
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:08.030
all that shit.
We all fucking come home.
Right?

399
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:12.950
You put on a game,
you got some solar energy,

400
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.120
you know you got some fucking weed.
I know,
I know.

401
00:24:18.121 --> 00:24:22.280
I'm over simplifying all of this.
Yeah,
I'm over simplifying all of this anyways.

402
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.570
I know what the fuck I'm talking about yet.
Let me,
uh,

403
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.710
let me do some advertising reads.

404
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.040
Excuse some advertising reads man,

405
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.680
and I gotta type in my fucking password.

406
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.030
It's of course vulgar.
I don't know why,

407
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.480
because of this fucking anger that you have in you.

408
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.870
I don't know what your problem is anyway.
To own,
to be this anything.
Alright,
see,

409
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:49.990
so everybody see,
so,
um,

410
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:54.200
every hear of something being a barrel of laughs.
Well,
a barrel,

411
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:58.670
it might not be enough laughs in the days of horses and buggy.
What?
Well,

412
00:24:58.671 --> 00:25:03.260
a barrel might've been enough laughs in the days of horse and Buggies,

413
00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.820
but you live now or you got to put your laughs on the cloud.

414
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.700
By the way,
you don't have technology.

415
00:25:10.701 --> 00:25:14.900
I fucking love for those fucking headphones that guy gave me right from Bose

416
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.050
wireless.
I was against that shit going.

417
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.960
I don't need any more radio waves going into my brain,
man.
I fucking love them.

418
00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.120
I don't give a shit what?
It's still to me.

419
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.060
I don't care if I turn into a fucking Zombie.
That's how convenient they are.

474
00:28:55.751 --> 00:28:59.500

Uh,
I did one in San Jose.
That one's going to be coming up soon.

475
00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:03.010
It's all on my youtube page,
which I of course do not have in front of me.

476
00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.570

Bill Burr tour of Phoenix and you'll be able to find it.

I already have fucking animator.

479
00:29:16.001 --> 00:29:18.100
I got some people doing some shit,
right?

480
00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.490
I'll be doing tours of every fucking city.
Excuse me.

481
00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:26.230
Then I go to get the hiccups,
um,
and all of that shit.
All right,

482
00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:30.250
so here we go.
What can we talk about here in the final couple of minutes?
Uh,

483
00:29:30.251 --> 00:29:34.630
all the Bruins,
the Bruins had their backs up against the wall.
We were,

484
00:29:34.631 --> 00:29:38.650
after having a nice comfortable fucking lead,
we'd up to like a fifth seat.

485
00:29:38.651 --> 00:29:43.090
We tumbled all the way down to an eighth seed one ahead.
The Tampa Bay lightning.

486
00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:44.170
All right.

487
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.840
And I wasn't paying a timber edge tension to tamp out was just watching the

488
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:47.674
Bruins lose.

489
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.710
And then I looked at the fucking standards because one night I was watching the

490
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:53.820
lightning playing the black hawks and the Blackhawks dog.

491
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.090
We're up fucking four to one,
and you know,

492
00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:03.320
the lightening start coming back and I'm fucking enjoying it.
Oh Shit.

493
00:30:03.321 --> 00:30:06.990
Four to two.
Wow.
Shit.
What the fuck would it break game?

494
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:10.820
I realized that that was hurting my team and they ended up winning in overtime.

495
00:30:10.821 --> 00:30:12.920
They get two points and they will,
they will one point behind us.

496
00:30:12.921 --> 00:30:16.310
So we beat the fucking,
uh,
we'd be Long Island,

497
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.483
<v 1>right?</v>

498
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.240
<v 0>Long Island would be the islanders said playing Brooklyn,
figure that one out.</v>

499
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:26.830
And um,
and then Tuesday night we beat the fucking pray.

500
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.890
So tonight,
who do we got?
The fucking staff,

501
00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:37.540
such a Boston week prejudice stats.
Um,

502
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:38.890
that's who we're playing tonight.

503
00:30:38.891 --> 00:30:42.010
And in the lightening have the Detroit Redwings sore and not having a good year,

504
00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:42.821
but they,
you know,

505
00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:47.560
they always got some fucking Sergei Federoff next phenom coming up.

506
00:30:47.561 --> 00:30:50.800
You know,
they kind of like,
uh,
the Pittsburgh penguins where they just,

507
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.850
they got the fucking,
they got that down man.
Somehow they,
you know,

508
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.250
I mean the penguins are crazy too.

509
00:30:57.251 --> 00:31:00.880
They had fucking Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jaga then he had like a fucking 10

510
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:02.710
year drought,
15 year drought or whatever,

511
00:31:02.711 --> 00:31:07.340
and then they come back with fucking Gino and sit,
you know,
and you know,

512
00:31:07.341 --> 00:31:10.430
something that the Bruins could be like that if we didn't fucking ship 'em out

513
00:31:10.431 --> 00:31:14.880
all the time.
You know,
we had Tyler Sagan,
hey,

514
00:31:14.881 --> 00:31:18.390
what'd you have a fucking cores light a get out of town buddy.
That's when,

515
00:31:18.391 --> 00:31:22.500
that's not what we do here.
And this racist town.
This is an upstanding community.

516
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.320
So we shipped him out and now look what we got.

517
00:31:25.321 --> 00:31:27.570
We got fucking Pasta Knoxx become,
uh,
you know,

518
00:31:27.571 --> 00:31:31.590
he's become a super sad Brad Marshawn.
You know,

519
00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:33.420
it's just like what a Tyler was still there.

520
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.970
You could essentially be rolling three fucking,
I don't know shit about hockey,

521
00:31:38.971 --> 00:31:41.950
but I mean,
I don't know.
We're always doing shit like that.
Look at you.

522
00:31:41.951 --> 00:31:42.571
Look at all the goals.

523
00:31:42.571 --> 00:31:46.470
Joel Cho Thorton scored in San Jose for why they never won shit.

524
00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.310
We didn't get shit for him in the fucking trade.
We just didn't want to pay him.

525
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.920
But anyways,
anyways,
that's not important.
We have the stars tonight.

526
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.550
Okay.

527
00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:01.550
The stars at night are big and deep in and up Texas.

528
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:04.890
Um,
but Dallas is not deep in the heart of Texas.

529
00:32:04.891 --> 00:32:07.500
It's right out there in the open.
So we're going to win tonight,
I hope.

530
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.690
But you never know.
They got Jamie van,
they gave fucking Patrick's Shap,

531
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.160
Patrick shap on the Dallas says,
um,

532
00:32:14.161 --> 00:32:18.780
the next f one race by the way,
is in,
I'm not this Sunday,

533
00:32:18.781 --> 00:32:23.080
it's going to be next Sunday.
And that's in China in dokie.
And by the way,

534
00:32:23.081 --> 00:32:26.250
speaking of China,
um,
I got satellite radio now.

535
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.430
So I finally get to listen to had the Howard stern show again.

536
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:33.950
And his wife has some sort of cause and you know,
I'm always,
you know,

537
00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.880
worry of a cause through.

538
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:39.350
I only listened to half of it and I had to turn the fucking channel would was

539
00:32:39.351 --> 00:32:40.010
describing.

540
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.160
They got some day over there or I don't know what the fuck they doing with dogs

541
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.910
where they torture them.
They scare the shit out of them.

542
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:50.270
They think that they have like adrenaline,
you know,
high anxiety.

543
00:32:50.271 --> 00:32:51.650
It makes the meat taste better.

544
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.310
They fucking torture him in front of the other dogs to make it more for the dogs

545
00:32:55.311 --> 00:32:57.320
here.
The [inaudible] I don't want to give you the rest of it.

546
00:32:57.321 --> 00:32:59.150
It made me sick to my fucking stomach.

547
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.890
So there's a petition that you can sign to try to get the fuck animals that are

548
00:33:03.891 --> 00:33:06.770
doing that shit to stop on a Howard Stern Dotcom.

549
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.740
You just scroll down and uh,

550
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.140
you know I had to sign that shit cause uh,

551
00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:16.220
and even if you got to do something about how the fuck can you do that to a dog,

552
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.040
you know what I mean?
I know what all you vegetarians going to say?

553
00:33:19.041 --> 00:33:21.860
Well the shit they do to cows and all that.
You know what,
you're fucking right.

554
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:25.580
Isn't there a way to just,
you know,

555
00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.900
fucking give a cow to behind the year when it's not even like paying attention.

556
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.730
The thing is,
is once you kill one,

557
00:33:31.731 --> 00:33:33.740
the other sense it and everyday it's fucking brutal.

558
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:37.400
But you know the end of the day,
a fucking hamburgers delicious.
I don't know.

559
00:33:37.401 --> 00:33:39.710
But you know you can,
why don't you just fucking have some cows?

560
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.400
Maybe it's because they have a billion people over there.

561
00:33:43.401 --> 00:33:46.190
So there's not enough cows for people.
I don't,
I don't fucking know.

562
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.970
But I love dogs.
So if you love dogs,
yeah.

563
00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:53.870
Howard stern.com sign the fucking petition anyways.
And then as far as,
um,

564
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.330
motorcycle racing goes,

565
00:33:56.331 --> 00:34:00.250
I'm going to try to get into this shit cause he's racist at Nice increase races.

566
00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.140
Got a little,
Christopher Walken is rice is there.

567
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:05.120
I'm not going to do Christopher Walken.
All right.

568
00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:10.010
Listen to fucking Craig gas or fucking Jaymar.
Uh,
the next,
uh,

569
00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:13.040
I think the first one of that season,
if you want to get into racing now,

570
00:34:13.041 --> 00:34:17.150
motorcycle racing is fucking insane cause they still bump each other and shit

571
00:34:17.151 --> 00:34:20.300
and they're on motorcycles doing,
I don't know,
fucking 190 miles an hour.

572
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.550
That one is on April 9th.
Sunday,

573
00:34:22.551 --> 00:34:26.120
April 9th in Argentina at 3:00 PM east coast time.

574
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.820
I'll actually be in San Antonio.

575
00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:31.013
<v 5>MMM.</v>

576
00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:36.440
<v 0>And uh,
let's see.
So that game will come on from me at two o'clock.</v>

577
00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:37.274
For me.

578
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.820
It's going to come on at two o'clock and I just have to figure out how the fuck

579
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:46.520
I'm going to,
uh,
where the hell I'm going to watch it.
I think it's on Fox,

580
00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.480
but uh,
I'm totally into this ship.
I've totally into it.
All right.
All right.

581
00:34:50.481 --> 00:34:54.750
That's it.
Everybody go fuck yourselves.
Have a great weekend.
You conch and a la.

582
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.790
I'll talk to you on Monday ferry.

583
00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:02.120
Go up room with also listen to this music here,

584
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.150
a little bit of musical or music bed here and then we're going to play you some,

585
00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:09.200
uh,
some classic Monday morning podcast that Thursday afternoon,

586
00:35:09.201 --> 00:35:10.040
just before Friday,

587
00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:14.660
Monday morning podcast from a Thursday or a Monday from the year gone by.

588
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:12.250
Um,
a lady roommate.
Hey Bill,
huge fan of the show.

589
00:36:12.251 --> 00:36:14.920
Wanted to see if you had any advice for this situation.

590
00:36:14.921 --> 00:36:17.830
I found myself in a little over a month ago.

591
00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:21.560
I moved to Phoenix and moved in with a friend of I edge.

592
00:36:21.561 --> 00:36:25.540
You go up camelback mountain yet.
That's a fucking great hike.

593
00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:28.570
You gotta go up that one.
Somebody dies up there every fucking year,

594
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:32.080
which always cracks me up to be like alone in the wilderness.

595
00:36:32.081 --> 00:36:35.140
While you can actually see buildings in the distance,

596
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:38.140
that's gotta be so frustrating.
Um,

597
00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:43.540
little ugly ass fucking roadrunners.
All right.
A little over a month ago,

598
00:36:43.541 --> 00:36:46.570
I moved to Phoenix and moved in with a friend from college.

599
00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.160
No real problems there,

600
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:52.600
but he did have a female college age roommate that he got along with.

601
00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:56.500
So we ended up setting settling on a three bedroom.
All right?

602
00:36:56.501 --> 00:36:59.060
So it's two dudes and a chick.
She's already like a Sitcom.

603
00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.120
This is like fucking reverse three's company.

604
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:07.080
<v 6>Colin Naga Ahmad [inaudible].</v>

605
00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.800
<v 0>I remember a fucking American was just like that,
you know?
Nice and simple.</v>

606
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:12.990
I guess it was probably fucked up then.

607
00:37:12.991 --> 00:37:15.540
I was just too young to notice sitting there eating a popsicle.

608
00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:20.550
<v 6>Look his own.
He's got a buddy dude,</v>

609
00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:25.510
<v 0>Betty boop,
boop,
Larry's upstairs.
50 years old.</v>

610
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.300
Fucking everything that moves.
Um,
all right.

611
00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:32.140
I only know a few people in town and my work schedule is grueling.

612
00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:36.880
It makes it really hard to meet to too many people over the course of the week.

613
00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:37.301
All right,

614
00:37:37.301 --> 00:37:40.510
so you're setting up your excuse for why you're already fucking your friends

615
00:37:40.511 --> 00:37:44.950
friend.
Alright?
You know,
I work alone.
I can't get to meet people.
Uh,

616
00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:50.980
why go out for pussy when it's right next door?
I get it,
buddy.
I get it.
You know,

617
00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.030
it's discovery channel.
Does the line go after the toughest zero,

618
00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.150
the fucking wounded one other,

619
00:37:58.151 --> 00:38:02.380
the little baby one or the one walking around wearing the fucking juicy shorts.

620
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:07.480
Um,
I'm sure by now you've pinpointed the key word in the above paragraph.
Female.

621
00:38:07.481 --> 00:38:11.380
Yes I have sir.
Yes I have.
So you can see where this is going.

622
00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.660
My second weekend here,

623
00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:18.780
we all go out get sloppy jalopy drunk and she informs me that she broke up with

624
00:38:19.841 --> 00:38:22.840
their boyfriend of five years.
Oh,
wonderful.

625
00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.160
So of course I do the gentlemanly thing and fuck your brains out.

626
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:30.100
Oh,
you go.
So of course.
Yeah,

627
00:38:30.101 --> 00:38:35.101
I do the gentleman thing and fuck her brains out or flop around like a dead fish

628
00:38:35.211 --> 00:38:40.010
on top of her.
Um,
it's one of those too.
Once I'm done,
I leave,

629
00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.700
I go to my room and we don't mention and we don't mention it.

630
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.990
You don't mention it in the morning and it's not awkward at all.

631
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:54.230
If I had the Allah Lou your song.
Oh,
that's fucking great.

632
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.160
<v 6>Okay.</v>

633
00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.130
<v 0>Would you guys look down at me if I told you that I was just jealous of this</v>

634
00:38:59.131 --> 00:39:01.830
person right now?
That's fucking perfect.

635
00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.930
And the hardest thing is going to be for you to not fuck this up for you not to

636
00:39:06.931 --> 00:39:09.210
develop failing's.
Okay.

637
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:11.210
<v 6>Okay.</v>

638
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:14.000
<v 0>You know,
that's going to be a hard one.
But if you could somehow do it,</v>

639
00:39:14.001 --> 00:39:15.920
if you could somehow keep yourself separated.

640
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:17.610
<v 6>Okay.</v>

641
00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:21.480
<v 0>You know,
you could just,
it would be like a,</v>

642
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:26.550
it'd be like stamps.com having the post office and you fucking apartment.

643
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:27.940
Now you've got the post ups,

644
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:31.920
your apartment and now you have this blow job machine also there.

645
00:39:31.921 --> 00:39:33.630
I mean it's tremendous.

646
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.800
<v 6>Okay.</v>

647
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.900
<v 0>You know,
and then I got to do is just decide what,</v>

648
00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:42.140
what kind of food you're always going out for and you're really liking.

649
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:46.570
You buy that appliance speed,
a Panini maker or a fucking cappuccino maker.

650
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.220
You got that stamps.com and the blowjob machine down the hall and I tell you

651
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:56.140
that's it.
Get the NFL package,
call it a life.

652
00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:00.000
Um,
so anyways,
he goes,
well,

653
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.010
we've gone about doing this for a few weeks now,

654
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:08.070
but since I'm never home during the week and she works during the day on

655
00:40:08.141 --> 00:40:10.950
weekends,
we don't exactly see each other.
And when we do,
we,

656
00:40:10.951 --> 00:40:15.280
we literally never say anything about it or hint added at all,
et Cetera.

657
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.250
Don't please don't fuck this up.

658
00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.020
<v 6>Okay,</v>

659
00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:23.260
<v 0>please don't fuck this up.
Okay?
He says,</v>

660
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:28.290
my question being as this is the first time something like this has happened,

661
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:31.420
is this a time bomb waiting to happen?

662
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:36.630
We're all the crazy is going to come flying out like the Ark of the covenant or

663
00:40:36.761 --> 00:40:38.380
is she just rebounding?

664
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:42.550
And I'm the free and clear until I settle in and find something else.

665
00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:47.770
Keep in mind,
keep in mind that Jesus Christ,
sorry,
didn't go to church today,

666
00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:52.720
has died for rose and is risen from the grave.

667
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.900
He did it all for you.

668
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:59.350
There's no way for you to thank him

669
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.380
once you give us a bunch of money.
Um,
keep in mind,

670
00:41:05.381 --> 00:41:09.670
I've never been accused of being good looking and she's pretty cute with the

671
00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.410
grade a ass on her.

672
00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:15.810
Any advice is appreciated and I guess go fuck yourself.
Um,

673
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:19.840
okay.
All right.
You did the right thing.

674
00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.900
You know you've got a great situation and you don't want to fuck it up.

675
00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:25.150
You know,

676
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.910
this is like the first time I went deep sea fishing and I got a bite and I

677
00:41:27.911 --> 00:41:30.910
looked at the dude next to me,
my it,
right.
What do I do now?

678
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.610
I let it run a little bit.
Let it run a little bit.
Ne bringing it right.

679
00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:37.010
You don't want the same thing.
All right?
So what is your question here?

680
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.300
Is this a time what this is?
Okay.

681
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:44.790
This is the wildcard that she's a psycho,
but she,
she,

682
00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.110
she would've shown her colors by now.
I would think if she was a psycho,

683
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.970
you know it was,
there would have been some sort of,
you know,
God,

684
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:56.130
you work so much and don't get to see you

685
00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:00.440
or you would have to do on that,
you know,

686
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:04.760
fucking twisting your arm hair or doing something fucking annoying,

687
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.570
some sort of annoying sort of touching.
Right.
So she hasn't done that.

688
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:14.350
She's totally putting out the vibe that she's basically in the mindset.

689
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.720
It's this thing seems like it's exactly what it is.
You know,

690
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.620
she was in a relationship for five years,
five years,
man.

691
00:42:24.621 --> 00:42:26.900
She's got to decompress from that.
All right?

692
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:32.120
She likes to go out and get hammered and get fucked and go to bed and not see

693
00:42:32.121 --> 00:42:35.810
your dumb ass for the whole week.
All right.
Just keep it at that.

694
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.940
This is the deal.
You don't have to bring it up either.

695
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:43.820
You don't have to bring it up or you just keep it the way it is.
All right?

696
00:42:43.821 --> 00:42:45.170
If she's barely talking to you,

697
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.980
you barely talk to her and you just have fun with it and this is another thing

698
00:42:48.981 --> 00:42:51.980
you do.
All right.
Have Fun with this shit.

699
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.200
What is some things that you always wanted to do with the woman and you haven't

700
00:42:57.201 --> 00:43:01.130
done yet?
This is the girl you do it with.
All right?

701
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.580
And she's going to probably do it with youtube because she doesn't give a fuck

702
00:43:04.581 --> 00:43:09.140
about you,
which is a great thing.
What you have,
sir is a fuck buddy.

703
00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:13.700
Congratulations.
This is your first one.
This is what men dream of.

704
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:18.470
This is what men really want for,
this is what we want for Christmas.
You know,

705
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.690
if we could just have a fuck buddy,

706
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:25.370
somebody who was clean with no diseases,
you know,

707
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:29.780
and somehow then had this pill they could give you that you drank,
you know,

708
00:43:29.781 --> 00:43:32.750
you washed it down and it got rid of any sort of fucking guilt.

709
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:36.970
It will be perfect.
But just single dudes so there's no guilt.
So my,

710
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:41.450
my thing is just don't,
don't open your mouth and fuck this thing up.

711
00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:46.790
All right?
You got a great thing going.
Okay.
Just keep doing what you're doing.

712
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.670
And,
uh,
the only thing I would correct is this whole thing where you say,

713
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:53.810
you know,
I'm not that good looking at guy,
you know,
work on your self esteem.

714
00:43:55.580 --> 00:44:00.140
She's pretty cute.
Hey,
you know,
good for her.
She's got a nice ass.

715
00:44:00.141 --> 00:44:03.920
Why don't you go fucking do something to it,
but not during the week.

716
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.850
No fucking during the week you focus on your job,
you have a great fucking time.

717
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:08.990
Now I know it's,
you know,

718
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.640
I guess eventually if you do meet somebody and you start bringing them around,

719
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:19.760
there's put there as a potential,
but uh,
you just got to nip that shit in the,

720
00:44:19.761 --> 00:44:24.410
but I guess if you actually met somebody that you liked,
uh,

721
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:30.410
at Jesus and he says,
yeah,
I didn't think about that.

722
00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:37.110
All right,
first,
first things first before we even get over to her.

723
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:43.290
Uh,
I mean,
does it okay.
Whole new can of worms here,
dude,

724
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:47.430
you have to be cool first and foremost.
All right.
Because eventually,

725
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.730
you know,
if she meets some other dude,

726
00:44:50.731 --> 00:44:53.400
you got to make sure that you're not going to flip out.

727
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.980
So do not develop any feelings for this girl.

728
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:59.330
And the only way you're not going to develop any feelings for this girls,

729
00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.980
if you see her once a fucking week and your Banger,
okay?

730
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:05.370
You don't want to know how many brothers and sisters she has,
right?

731
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.670
It's like reservoir dogs.
You guys shouldn't even know each other's names.

732
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.880
Don't you name though to be a fucking,
I don't want even your name.
Yeah,

733
00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.820
you don't know.
You don't.
You want that?
All right.
All right.

734
00:45:14.821 --> 00:45:18.630
You fucking Mr Pink or whatever.
She's missed a blonde or Mrs Blonde.

735
00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:22.200
Uh,
sorry.
Um,

736
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:28.950
that's the only thing you got to worry about.
All right,
so,

737
00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.950
and I've learned to just be totally fucking upfront and honest.

738
00:45:31.951 --> 00:45:35.010
So if I got some new girlfriend,
I would just tell her what's up.

739
00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:37.740
So what's your deal?
Yeah,
I'm single.

740
00:45:37.741 --> 00:45:41.430
I'm kind of banging my fucking roommate once a week,
you know,
we don't,
you know,

741
00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:46.290
it's just sort of a fuck buddy thing.
Oh,
does that make you uncomfortable?
Well,

742
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:49.740
all right,
well then this relationship isn't going to work because you're already

743
00:45:49.741 --> 00:45:54.420
uncomfortable with me.
Know if I got feelings for you.

744
00:45:54.421 --> 00:45:56.400
I wouldn't keep banging her,
but you know,

745
00:45:56.490 --> 00:46:00.090
I'm not taking it off the table after one fucking trip to Applebee's,

746
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:05.220
Jesus Christ free pussy.
That's like free shoes for you,
right?

747
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.600
You know,
I dunno.
That's all I all I can tell you dude,
you can't control her.

748
00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:12.630
Who gives a fuck dote?

749
00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:16.950
Someday you're going to be 50 and you got to be married and she's going to be

750
00:46:16.951 --> 00:46:19.190
bitching at you about something you,
if you love her,

751
00:46:19.191 --> 00:46:21.300
you at some point you're just going to be reminiscent going,

752
00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:25.320
you know when my life was the greatest was when I had that little fucking

753
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:27.960
goddamn three bedroom apartment.

754
00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:31.980
All I had to do was make this amount of money a week and I had some chick once a

755
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:36.390
week with just fucked my brains out and not talk to me for the other six days.

756
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:40.050
Goddamn dream.
You got the dream,
sir.
All right,

757
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:45.000
and I don't know where you're going to wake up,
but enjoy it while it lasts.

758
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.430
Okay.
I hope I answered your question.
I really do.

759
00:46:50.431 --> 00:46:55.200
You're in a hell of a situation.
Enjoy it.
All right,
Kudos to you.

760
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.333
I am jealous.

761
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.133
<v 2>Okay.</v>

762
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:41.710
<v 7>Hey,
what's going on?
This is bill burns and this is,
uh,</v>

763
00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:44.540
this is the Monday morning podcast.
This is the official one.

764
00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:49.750
That other one that I just left was a,
was an unofficial and was not,
uh,

765
00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:54.560
was not sanctioned by the board of directors of the Monday morning podcast.

766
00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:59.480
Had a crazy day.
I've been talking all day long.
Uh,
trying to be cute,

767
00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:00.261
trying to be funny,

768
00:48:00.261 --> 00:48:05.060
trying to sell tickets from my theater dates this weekend and I am pretty much

769
00:48:05.061 --> 00:48:09.830
all fucking talked out.
So this is going to be a straight ahead no bull shit.

770
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:15.050
Let's get right to the meat of the fucking issue podcast because,

771
00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:19.220
uh,
I'm going to the ranger game tonight and uh,

772
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:23.870
I'm going to a bar first,
which is stupid.
I'm going to get sick,

773
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:27.200
but I don't know how to say no,
you know,
I don't know how to say no.

774
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.590
What the fuck else am I going to do?
You know,

775
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.420
so disregard the unofficial podcast,

776
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:35.390
which said that I would be doing this podcast after the hockey game.

777
00:48:35.391 --> 00:48:37.160
Cause I'm not,
I just decided to fuck it.

778
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:40.910
I'll do a quick 20 minute one within 19 minute intro.

779
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.370
If you're new to my podcast,

780
00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:48.830
I do one of these every Monday and I do them right here on [inaudible] dot com

781
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:52.880
and uh,
I also do them on my myspace page.
No,

782
00:48:52.881 --> 00:48:56.690
I am not on Facebook.
If you want to know why I'm not on Facebook,

783
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:59.570
revert to the podcast,
the unofficial one before this.

784
00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:04.190
And even though it's unofficial,
it is my official feeling.
I'll fucking Facebook.

785
00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:08.600
Do you like this?
Is footnotes with this podcast.
All right.
This is the deal,
man.

786
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.570
Every week I do one of these and I answer people's questions.

787
00:49:11.571 --> 00:49:15.140
I read shit that they find underrated.
Overrated.
I give people advice,

788
00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.920
I read stories about revenge and whatever else this thing spins into when I

789
00:49:19.921 --> 00:49:22.940
always tell my gigs.
Like for example,

790
00:49:22.941 --> 00:49:25.250
this weekend I'm going to be on April 3rd,

791
00:49:25.251 --> 00:49:28.940
I'm going to be at the lake shore theater in Chicago,
Illinois.

792
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:32.390
Um,
all the information is on dover.com,

793
00:49:32.391 --> 00:49:36.170
my space.com/bill burr.
It's all up there.

794
00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:41.080
And on a Saturday I am going to be at the uh,

795
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:44.480
Trump marina.
Isn't that what it is?

796
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:48.180
I can't remember.
I think that's what it is.
Yeah.

797
00:49:48.181 --> 00:49:50.540
It will be in Atlantic city at the Trump marina.

798
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:54.520
Why doesn't that sound right when it comes out of my fucking mouth or whatever.

799
00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:56.300
That's what I'm going to say.
I'm going to be Trump marina.

800
00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:59.570
We just added a second show,
which is why I'm doing all this media today,

801
00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:03.470
which is why I'm fucking half asleep.
So I'm going to sign a little bit drunk,

802
00:50:03.471 --> 00:50:06.680
but I'm not,
that kid is this Saturday,

803
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:11.030
April 4th and I will be working with young Joe de Rosa,

804
00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:15.860
one of the new stars of the Opie and Anthony Show.
Um,

805
00:50:15.861 --> 00:50:18.860
and he will also be on the opie and Anthony show with me as well.
I,

806
00:50:18.861 --> 00:50:23.240
this whole week,
I'm going to be on it on Tuesday,

807
00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:23.660
Wednesday and Thursday of this week.

808
00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:28.660
That would be a March 31st April 1st and April 2nd and Joe to Rose's coming on

809
00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:31.460
on April 2nd.
So there you go.
Look at that.

810
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:35.420
I got all my hype edge out of the way and like I said,

811
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:38.930
this is going to be really quick.
All right.
And uh,
let's talk about my gig.

812
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:43.931
This past weekend I was working at the house of comedy and a St Louis and I had

813
00:50:44.091 --> 00:50:48.350
a great time.
Unbelievable crowds all weekend.

814
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.690
Uh,
my,
uh,

815
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.720
my eight person fan club showed up to members strong and a,

816
00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.610
I want to thank them for showing up.

817
00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:01.580
That's the group of people that followed me to Nashville.

818
00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.660
And do you guys remember that story when they went to Kansas City?

819
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.820
You want a quick recap because we've patched things up between,

820
00:51:10.821 --> 00:51:13.790
it's actually had a blowout with my fan club.
There's only,
I can't,

821
00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:17.660
who the fuck gets into a fight with their fucking fan club?
All right.

822
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.180
I just like saying I have a fan club.
I feel like a teen idol.

823
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:25.010
Like it should be singing some song about teenage teenage anx,
you know,

824
00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.111
no bill,

825
00:51:27.111 --> 00:51:31.370
we don't deal with my fucking hair slicked back if I still let him to slip back.

826
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:33.080
You know,
I'm looking over my shoulder,

827
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.790
like a fucking gay actor trying to be straightened.

828
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.540
And then I fucking cat crashed my car.

829
00:51:38.541 --> 00:51:40.610
And Mulholland drive is basically what happened.

830
00:51:40.611 --> 00:51:44.630
My Fan Club last time they saw me,
they went to at least the Saint Louis Chapter.

831
00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.240
Um,
uh,
basically they went to Kansas City when I was working in the Improv.

832
00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:52.910
I'll tell you this story really quick.
And uh,

833
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:55.460
they came in and they were excited and evidently they were being loud.

834
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:59.000
So I'm sitting in the green room and the bouncer comes back and says,
hey bill,

835
00:51:59.001 --> 00:52:01.820
there's a,
there's a table people out there.
They're really loud.
They seem drunk.

836
00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:03.770
Do you want me to tell him to,
uh,
you know,

837
00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:06.830
sort of chill out a little bit before he go up?
And I go,
sure,
that'd be great.

838
00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:10.220
And evidently the bouncer,
it goes out there and he says to the fan club,
he says,

839
00:52:10.221 --> 00:52:13.910
Hey,
Bill Byrd told you guys to shut the fuck up,
or something like that.

840
00:52:13.911 --> 00:52:18.680
So naturally they were beside themselves and for some reason decided to continue

841
00:52:18.681 --> 00:52:21.710
to drink so they could have a nice rational conversation.

842
00:52:21.711 --> 00:52:24.770
About it after the fucking show.
So the show in,
next thing you know,

843
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:29.650
I get 20 people coming to me with,
hey,
build written on their shirt and uh,

844
00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:32.390
they're all telling me what a fucking asshole I am and I had nothing to do with

845
00:52:32.391 --> 00:52:35.930
it.
And I explained myself on a podcast about it.

846
00:52:35.931 --> 00:52:40.070
I don't know when the fuck is was,
this was years ago.
And uh,
but anyways,

847
00:52:40.071 --> 00:52:43.790
it's the first time I've met any of them since then.
And they were nice.

848
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.480
They didn't try to kick the shit out of me.
So evidently everything is all good.

849
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:52.220
So I want to say thanks to them for coming out and also thanks to that crew of

850
00:52:52.221 --> 00:52:56.390
guys from the University of Kansas.
That's right.

851
00:52:56.391 --> 00:53:00.320
Mother fuckers distant right now around a laptop,
high fiving each other,

852
00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:04.700
probably doing drugs,
legal or not legal.

853
00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:09.140
I want to thank all those guys,
those mother fuckers on college,
kid money,

854
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:13.100
you know,
drove all the way from uh,
basically uh,

855
00:53:13.101 --> 00:53:15.200
the other side of Kansas City to come out to my show,

856
00:53:15.201 --> 00:53:17.840
which was really flattering on college kid money.

857
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:20.810
Unless they got one rich French,
which they probably do.

858
00:53:20.811 --> 00:53:23.600
There's always one rich front and you act like you're friends with them.

859
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.620
I'm going to blow up this right now.

860
00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:28.770
Act like your fucking friends with them and you're really not,

861
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.560
he just had gas money in the fucking car,
you know,

862
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:34.860
then all of a sudden you wreck it and then what do you do?

863
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.780
You have the guy who should be in a biker gang,

864
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:38.490
but for some reason he's still in college.

865
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.140
Welds a new front end to it and you turned it into a float and then you do a

866
00:53:43.141 --> 00:53:46.050
bunch of shit that would be considered a terrorist act and yeah,

867
00:53:46.051 --> 00:53:49.290
with the whole nine 11 Patriot Act,
you'd never get away with it.
Right?

868
00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:52.130
Sound familiar?
All right.

869
00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:55.170
Animal House reference for all you youngsters out there.
All right,

870
00:53:55.171 --> 00:53:59.040
so this is the Monday morning podcast and this is going to be a lean mean one in

871
00:53:59.041 --> 00:54:03.240
these lean mean times of a fucked up economy.
Anybody else who do,

872
00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:06.240
I did the right thing with their money and they're sick of people telling them

873
00:54:06.241 --> 00:54:09.720
that they have to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.
It's like,
no I don't.

874
00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.920
No,
I don't.
I have to fucking,
I have to.
What do I have to do?

875
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:14.791
I don't know what I have to,

876
00:54:14.791 --> 00:54:18.740
I had to pick myself up off the floor because you had dumb fucking ass knocked

877
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:22.000
me down to it.
I didn't do anything,
you know,

878
00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:25.410
whole all this time and making fun of that MTV cribs lifestyle.

879
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.270
I should have been living in everyone else's.

880
00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:31.320
It doesn't make a fucking difference in the end.
You know,

881
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.660
I'm trying to figure their way out,
man.

882
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:36.480
I'm trying to get off the wheel was trying to stop running on the wheel and I

883
00:54:36.481 --> 00:54:39.510
can't use fucking bank has got the whole thing sewed up.

884
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:42.240
If we're going to go is another dick in my face.

885
00:54:42.241 --> 00:54:43.890
There's no way to fucking escape this shit.

886
00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:47.880
I'm really just going to have to work until I'm 106 and then I'm going to die

887
00:54:47.881 --> 00:54:50.010
and then that's going to be the end of it.
You know,

888
00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:51.150
you think I don't have dreams.

889
00:54:51.151 --> 00:54:55.770
I don't want to retire open some fucking stupid ass bar down on the Florida keys

890
00:54:56.550 --> 00:55:00.320
sit there in a Hawaiian shirt.
You know what I mean?
It's,

891
00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:05.330
I just fucking sell drinks to convicted felons and a gay mass murderers score on

892
00:55:06.241 --> 00:55:08.820
the run because they killed the fucking,
sorry,

893
00:55:08.821 --> 00:55:10.130
I can't remember how that one went in front of you.

894
00:55:10.131 --> 00:55:14.310
What Andrew Cunanan referenced there really killed Versace.

895
00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:19.260
Uh,
I saw a really good looking woman sort of down.
You don't,

896
00:55:19.261 --> 00:55:22.980
you don't like when a girl gets like so good looking is so super model looking

897
00:55:22.981 --> 00:55:24.840
that they kind of looked like an alien.

898
00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:28.380
I was actually doing this interview with this guy,
John McCarthy,

899
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.200
who has his own fucking website,
which escapes me.

900
00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:35.760
The name of it escapes me cause I'm half asleep and I did 10 of those interviews

901
00:55:35.761 --> 00:55:39.030
today,
but we were looking at this woman,
we were like,
she's beautiful,
isn't it?

902
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:41.670
Seems.
Yeah,
she's unique cause like it's kind of looks reptilian.

903
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:47.010
There's something about like once you're taller than five 11 as a woman and you

904
00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:51.720
still are somehow under 120 pounds,
you know your eyes get really big.

905
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:55.710
You just,
you walk like literally alien.
He looked,
you know what they look like,

906
00:55:55.711 --> 00:55:58.260
they look cool,
they look like big praying.
Mantises

907
00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:03.960
praying mantises that you want to fuck.
Okay.

908
00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:07.350
Um,
anyways,
let's get to the podcast questions.
Like I said,

909
00:56:07.351 --> 00:56:09.360
this is going to be a real quick one.
We'll do this.

910
00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:12.510
We're only 10 minutes in and Mario and the questions.
All right bill,

911
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:16.280
I love this question by the way,
cause this question needed to be asked.
Bill,

912
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:19.260
what the fuck is the deal with Ed hardy shirts?

913
00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:21.480
Can everybody just relax,

914
00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:27.070
take a big inhale and then exhale and just be happy that somebody question those

915
00:56:27.071 --> 00:56:30.730
fucking things.
I'm going to read it again so much.
I love this question.
Bill.

916
00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:35.880
What the fuck is the deal with Ed hardy shirts seems like it has become the

917
00:56:36.761 --> 00:56:41.470
uniform of the power tool.
Am I an ass for not realizing these aren't the,

918
00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.750
these are the coolest things.
Uh,
wait a minute.

919
00:56:43.751 --> 00:56:47.590
Am I asked for not realizing these are the coolest things ever or am I

920
00:56:47.591 --> 00:56:51.610
accidentally smart for realizing that I don't need to wear a dress shirt with a

921
00:56:51.611 --> 00:56:53.920
drawing of a dragon fucking Buddha,

922
00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:58.990
thanks in advance for help.
So odd.
You couldn't be more right.
I don't,

923
00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:02.470
I don't get those.
You know what those things are going to be,
you know,

924
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:07.330
every period I'm going to talk about fashion right now,

925
00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:11.590
every period has a moment where somebody where you know,

926
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:15.280
a style comes out when you know that,
you know,
10,

927
00:57:15.281 --> 00:57:19.840
20 years down the line when they do the dazed and confused movie of that period,

928
00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:24.460
that's like,
you know,
they'll try to act like everybody was wearing that shit.

929
00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:27.520
Jesus Christ built to say what you're trying to say.
But at this way,

930
00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:31.090
I was alive during the 70s but I never wore bell bottoms.

931
00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:32.560
You know what I mean?

932
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:37.390
I never had a big pink comb in my back pocket with feathered back hair.

933
00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:41.230
Random.
My hair used to be like a fucking Brillo pads so I couldn't do it.

934
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:43.150
But you know what I'm saying?
Well,
you know,

935
00:57:43.151 --> 00:57:46.240
whenever they do a movie about the 70s everybody looks like that.

936
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.720
You know what I mean?
Everybody dresses like that.

937
00:57:49.721 --> 00:57:51.340
That's what those Ed hardy shirts are.

938
00:57:51.341 --> 00:57:55.490
Those of the horrific fashion mistake of a,

939
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:59.950
of this time period.
They're fucking horrific.
And not only that,

940
00:57:59.951 --> 00:58:02.830
that whole a bunch of drawing on your shirt.

941
00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:05.470
I wasn't that in like three years ago.

942
00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:10.400
I remember when I was still trying to be young three years ago at a,
a,
at a,

943
00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:15.720
at a very,
uh,
very tipsy 37 years old.
I,
you know,

944
00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.880
I started wearing shirts like that.
There were,

945
00:58:17.881 --> 00:58:21.010
those shirts were initially for the people who weren't man enough to get a

946
00:58:21.011 --> 00:58:25.690
tattoo over their entire torso.
And I remember like,
literally like,

947
00:58:25.691 --> 00:58:29.170
I think like a year and a half ago,
I was just like,
you know what?

948
00:58:29.171 --> 00:58:34.150
These are these fucking bedazzled shirts with the eagles and the fucking,

949
00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:35.740
uh,
I dunno anteaters on him.

950
00:58:35.741 --> 00:58:39.220
Whatever the hell they are with all these like prison tattoo designs,

951
00:58:39.221 --> 00:58:41.950
this shit's over.
And evidently it isn't.

952
00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:45.730
They're continuing with them and ed hardy,
he doesn't dare like these.

953
00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:50.620
It's like those awful designs and bright colors you don't,

954
00:58:50.621 --> 00:58:55.570
seems like they would wear them at the growing up Gadi sorta kids seems like

955
00:58:55.630 --> 00:59:00.070
they would wear,
you know,
they'd wear them and they'd still get pussy.
You know,

956
00:59:00.071 --> 00:59:04.030
cause they got the,
they got the end two you got at the end,
they go red.

957
00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:07.720
Now you get the attitude that movie fast times at Ridgemont high.

958
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:10.390
Every movie references I'm going to make is going to be fucking 30 years old at

959
00:59:10.391 --> 00:59:12.790
this point.
All right.
You're absolutely right.

960
00:59:12.791 --> 00:59:16.150
I don't know what to deal with Ed hardy shirts are the fucking horrific and not

961
00:59:16.151 --> 00:59:19.690
even Armenian guys wear them.
They,
at least as far as I know,

962
00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:24.590
they seem to wear those other bizarre but there bizarrely designed and they step

963
00:59:24.591 --> 00:59:28.790
out of Maseratis or at least to Armenian guys did it.
A car wash.
I saw in La.

964
00:59:28.791 --> 00:59:33.080
So now that becomes every Armenian guy in my mindset,

965
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.840
but that's even fucking make sense.
I don't care.
Okay.

966
00:59:35.841 --> 00:59:38.000
I'm working on five hours sleep and I've been running my mouth.

967
00:59:38.001 --> 00:59:40.250
I'll fucking deck.
Uh,
and yes,

968
00:59:40.251 --> 00:59:43.760
I will be giving excuses every five seconds for this podcast.
All right,

969
00:59:43.761 --> 00:59:48.020
question number two,
Bill,
I'm recently new to your podcast,
but thanks to Itunes,

970
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:51.890
the uh,
my podcast question is,

971
00:59:51.891 --> 00:59:55.820
do you follow the World Cup soccer in general?
If so,

972
00:59:55.821 --> 00:59:58.220
do you root for any team specifically?
And if not,

973
00:59:58.221 --> 01:00:03.221
you should consider the Seattle sounders then come up to Seattle for a show and

974
01:00:05.211 --> 01:00:07.700
the game,
the Seattle sounders.

975
01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:10.863
Alright.

976
01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:15.710
Just when I thought Ed Hardy was going to be the worst thing I could picture in

977
01:00:15.711 --> 01:00:16.251
my mind,

978
01:00:16.251 --> 01:00:20.300
I'm just picturing the crew of people who sat around a fucking conference table

979
01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:23.570
then came up with the name for your soccer team.
Do.

980
01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.570
I'm not shitting on soccer before I trashed the name of your team.

981
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.370
Let's get back to the first question.
Do I follow World Cup soccer now?
I don't.

982
01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.590
I would love to.
You know,
I,
I've tried to follow that.
Uh,

983
01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:40.310
what the Premier League,
I tried to get into it cause I think it is cool as hell.

984
01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:44.900
And I actually,
I actually liked soccer,
you know,
I actually didn't like it.

985
01:00:44.901 --> 01:00:47.690
I know a lot of Americans don't like to shit,
but I actually like it,

986
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:51.590
but I don't like American soccer just because Americans don't seem to be into it

987
01:00:51.591 --> 01:00:56.000
that much.
So it just kinda seems like you're watching the WWE NBA.

988
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:59.300
There's no excitement in the crowd and you know,

989
01:00:59.301 --> 01:01:04.190
I can't get excited if no one else was excited cause I'm codependent.
So,

990
01:01:04.191 --> 01:01:04.660
uh,

991
01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:07.670
the only time I followed the World Cup is when they actually have the World Cup.

992
01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:12.740
And when I watch it,
I just root for the countries that I am.
Um,

993
01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:17.600
you know,
that my ancestors were,
I guess German,

994
01:01:17.601 --> 01:01:21.170
Irish with a little bit of English.
So I've pretty much just,

995
01:01:21.171 --> 01:01:24.410
I root for Germany because I think it's funny,

996
01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:28.160
it's just funny to root for Germany to be in a crowd of people rooting for

997
01:01:28.161 --> 01:01:32.360
Germany.
It's just so fucking Cliche,
like Naziesque,
you know what I mean?

998
01:01:32.361 --> 01:01:36.260
There's no way to fucking sit there in a crowd full of people be cheering on

999
01:01:36.261 --> 01:01:40.610
Germany and somehow not feel like you're advocating the policies of Adolph

1000
01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:44.480
Hitler.
That's what I,
that's what I like about Rudy for Germany is the,

1001
01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:48.230
he just start laughing halfway through it.
Like,
Hey,
wait,
am I not to be,
oh,

1002
01:01:48.231 --> 01:01:50.420
wait a minute.
No,
no,
I'm just waiting for the stock team.
That's right.

1003
01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:54.900
That's right.
And uh,

1004
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.160
I also root for the teams in South America because evidently if they miss a

1005
01:01:58.161 --> 01:02:02.930
penalty shot,
they go home and they get executed.
So,
um,
but you know,

1006
01:02:02.931 --> 01:02:04.130
that can only be one winner.

1007
01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.140
So getting back to the Seattle sounders,
I get it.
What,

1008
01:02:09.141 --> 01:02:13.820
because uh,
what is,
what is outside of us at Puget sound?

1009
01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:17.780
I know there's some sort of sound,
I just hate that fucking word.

1010
01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.210
I gotta look it up again.
What
the fuck is this sound?

1011
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:24.050
<v 8>You know something?</v>

1012
01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.810
<v 7>I don't know that I could define any sort of body of water other than an ocean.</v>

1013
01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.270
I know what an ocean is,
right?
I know what the fucking ocean is.

1014
01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.640
Let me try to psych myself up so I can answer this.

1015
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:42.110
And Ocean is a,
it's a lot of water.
Water between continents.

1016
01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:48.200
What else does it have?
Well,
it has salt water.
I'm a fucking moron.

1017
01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:49.880
What does it sound?

1018
01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.480
We're just going to type sound and let's see what happens here.

1019
01:02:53.481 --> 01:02:58.100
Sound is a vibration transmitted.
That's not what I'm talking about.

1020
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:04.490
Hang on a second.
Sound.
Let's just write sound water.

1021
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:09.320
Water's sound effects.
Geography.

1022
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:15.130
The glacier produces a sound speed of sound and how sound in air differs.

1023
01:03:16.070 --> 01:03:18.680
Sound water productions.
What the fuck?

1024
01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.910
All right.
How about this?
Let me,
let me write it and then you got to be a moron.

1025
01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:28.130
It's how you find shit on the Internet.
What is a sound?

1026
01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:33.110
Enter web definition.
Sound,
sound,
investments.

1027
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:38.110
You fucking cunt.
Spelling it wrong.

1028
01:03:38.111 --> 01:03:42.160
How do you spell sound for water?
Here it is.

1029
01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.820
Sound geography.
Let's go to Wikipedia.

1030
01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:48.390
God knows they're credible and geography.

1031
01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:53.391
A sound or a seaway is a large sea or ocean inlet larger than a bay.

1032
01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.070
All right.

1033
01:03:57.070 --> 01:04:02.070
What the fuck is an inlet and inlet is a narrow body body of water between

1034
01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:06.790
islands or leading inland from a larger banal.

1035
01:04:06.791 --> 01:04:09.250
I'm not going to read the rest of it cause it's just going to get confusing.

1036
01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:13.180
I liked that.
An inlet is a narrow body of water between islands.

1037
01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.880
Okay,
so a sound is a big inlet,
uh,
bay.

1038
01:04:18.881 --> 01:04:22.740
I don't give a fuck.
Jesus Christ.
I like this.

1039
01:04:22.741 --> 01:04:25.270
She get a definition than every other word is highlighted because they know

1040
01:04:25.271 --> 01:04:26.260
you're fucking stupid.

1041
01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.840
So geography is sound or a seaway is a large sea or ocean inlet larger than a

1042
01:04:33.371 --> 01:04:35.380
bay.
So I guess it is salt water.

1043
01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:38.623
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1044
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.770
<v 7>I sort of get what that is.
So they're the sounders.
All right,</v>

1045
01:04:43.771 --> 01:04:48.390
let's look up Seattle sounders.
Let's look this up.
This is exciting,
isn't it?

1046
01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.850
Seattle sounder.

1047
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:53.010
<v 8>Jeez.</v>

1048
01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:53.721
<v 7>Jesus Christ.
You know,</v>

1049
01:04:53.721 --> 01:04:56.330
it's a small club when they're not even the number one fucking thing there.

1050
01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:59.600
The third,
that third lead on that Seattle sounders.

1051
01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:03.050
And let's see,
do they have history?

1052
01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:06.290
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1053
01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:07.130
<v 7>Jesus Christ.</v>

1054
01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:11.450
You guys are really into that awful green and blue up there.

1055
01:05:11.451 --> 01:05:12.590
Why do you guys always have that?

1056
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:17.120
Why does everything have to look like algae when it comes to your sports teams?

1057
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:22.360
You know,
give her the algae isn't a good team color.
Um,
all right,

1058
01:05:22.361 --> 01:05:23.880
let's get,
let's get the stop fucking car.

1059
01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:25.540
I actually liked soccer and I'm trashing.

1060
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:29.290
Did I mention the shout out to the people from Kansas University?

1061
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:34.270
Let me get back to fucking anyway.
What the fuck are we here?
All right.

1062
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:38.090
Anyways,
well here's the kid hyping up the Seattle sounders game.
Ah,

1063
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:42.550
there are new mls expansion team up here and the atmosphere was electric.

1064
01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:46.330
I suppose I'm a little biased in that soccer is easily the greatest sport in the

1065
01:05:46.331 --> 01:05:49.930
world.
But having been over in Germany for the 2006 World Cup,

1066
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:53.860
the sounders game felt oddly similar.
Okay.

1067
01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:57.190
Now do you work for the Seattle sounders?

1068
01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:02.170
Are you really going to say going to Germany for the 2006 World Cup,

1069
01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:06.880
that going to a home game for the Seattle sounders was equivalent to that?

1070
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:08.700
I don't know.

1071
01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:12.850
Evidently he's saying that it's a shit and he should have and you only go up

1072
01:06:12.851 --> 01:06:16.300
there and you have a good time because you'll be surrounded by a sea,

1073
01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:21.070
not a sound,
not an inlet of,
of green.

1074
01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.560
That was stupid.
Why we just said that.
I see not a sound,
not a bay.

1075
01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:31.240
That's what I should've said.
Inlet.
That didn't make sense.

1076
01:06:31.241 --> 01:06:34.180
Did it cause an inlet is why she she and what doesn't make sense,
doesn't it?

1077
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:37.460
What does an inland,
I can't even remember.
See,

1078
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.450
this is why I sucked in school and inlet and outlet is a small,

1079
01:06:40.451 --> 01:06:42.870
straight sort of fucking body of water between.

1080
01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:48.080
What if this is say,
well listen to this and I want you to,

1081
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.570
I hope you're enjoying this because I know you're fucking laughing,

1082
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:52.870
but just know that you dressed like you were in the village people,

1083
01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:57.120
let's get onto the revenge stories.
Shall We?
Uh,

1084
01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.100
we'll probably do rate underwear because I didn't close with the revenge stories

1085
01:07:00.101 --> 01:07:02.350
cause he thinks is so fucking long.

1086
01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.930
And not to mention there's a guy talking a little bit of shift about some of

1087
01:07:04.931 --> 01:07:08.290
your other revenge stores.
All right,
let's get with overrated,
underrated.

1088
01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:12.730
All I have this week is one overrated because this is going to be the stripped

1089
01:07:12.731 --> 01:07:16.960
down.
Send me a text message.
I like the stripped down version.
Okay.

1090
01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:20.970
Over,
I got to end this thing.
It's five minutes,
so I got to hurry here for us.

1091
01:07:20.971 --> 01:07:24.520
I'm going to miss my drinking time.
Overrated.
Uh,

1092
01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:27.630
thanks to the end and we'll talk [inaudible] I got an over rate of four.

1093
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:31.960
You fucking relationships.
Why in the hell can't guys get out?

1094
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:36.460
Get on the damn boat already.
The single guys have it down.

1095
01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:39.880
Wind Dynam fuck him and fucking leave.

1096
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:45.570
I guess it's like you said,
uh,
I'm sorry.
People like I can't,

1097
01:07:45.571 --> 01:07:46.930
I,
you know,
I usually suck at reading.

1098
01:07:46.931 --> 01:07:49.990
I'm just relieving more sign of Denim and you fucking leave.

1099
01:07:49.991 --> 01:07:52.720
That's how the single guys do it.
I guess it's like you said,

1100
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.440
I think it was Tupac podcasts ago or so.

1101
01:07:56.441 --> 01:07:59.860
You feel the gravitational pull to get married and have kids.

1102
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:04.780
I guess that's guys had the same poll about being dumb enough to try and make a

1103
01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:08.710
relationship work.
Uh,
yeah,
I think there's a lot of truth to that.

1104
01:08:08.711 --> 01:08:12.250
I think what you should do is you should just remain signals for your entire

1105
01:08:12.251 --> 01:08:16.250
twenties,
you know,
and right time,
right about the time you're like 30,

1106
01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:19.430
then you know,
once you get all your fucking out of your system,

1107
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:23.540
then you can just kind of be like,
all right,
I need to,
I need to,
you know,

1108
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:25.730
you're going to want to hang with somebody at some point.
You know,

1109
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:28.550
you don't want to be the old guy in the bar like me.

1110
01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:32.810
Like I'm about to be 45 minutes,
you know,
hey,
there's sugar,
you know,

1111
01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:37.040
column women by Old,
old rat pack names.

1112
01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:41.690
Um,
all right,
let's,
let's get onto the,
uh,
the revenge story.

1113
01:08:41.691 --> 01:08:44.780
I'm going to read this guy's first cause he's talking a little bit of trash and

1114
01:08:44.781 --> 01:08:48.220
I liked this guy's coming out.
Come,
he's coming out.
Really a confident.
All right.

1115
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:51.400
Revenge story number one,
Bill.
It seems as if all the,

1116
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.730
it seems like all their events,

1117
01:08:52.731 --> 01:08:57.320
stories that you've been reading on the podcast lately have been sent sent by a

1118
01:08:57.321 --> 01:09:02.321
bunch of pansies that take the pussy passive form of revenge and fuck with

1119
01:09:02.991 --> 01:09:03.920
somebody's car.

1120
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:08.300
Shit like that is lame and a pathetic attempt to get back at someone.

1121
01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.020
What they really need to do is take a more aggressive approach.

1122
01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:15.680
Here is my revenge store.
I want you guys to know this.
I haven't even,

1123
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:20.000
I haven't even read this one yet.
All right.
I just saw that intro and I'm like,

1124
01:09:20.001 --> 01:09:21.350
well,
with an intro like that,

1125
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:25.490
this has to be the best revenge story we've heard so far.

1126
01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:26.750
So with that,

1127
01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:31.280
let's all judge this guys revenge story as I read it for the first time and I

1128
01:09:31.281 --> 01:09:35.600
want you to know there's things like fucking nine pages long.
God Damn people,

1129
01:09:35.601 --> 01:09:38.210
I'll tell you revenge is a quick,
what the fuck did I just do?

1130
01:09:38.830 --> 01:09:41.960
Revenge is not a quick thing here.
Hang on.

1131
01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:45.950
I just accidentally hit the wrong button.
All right,
I'm back.
I'm back.

1132
01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:49.280
All right,
here we go.
The revenge story.
All right,
fill.

1133
01:09:49.281 --> 01:09:54.281
This happened a few years ago when I was 17 and working at a fast food joint one

1134
01:09:54.471 --> 01:09:58.820
night I was closing the place and I was rolling a blunt at one of the tables to

1135
01:09:58.821 --> 01:10:01.190
smoke after I got off of work and other words.

1136
01:10:01.191 --> 01:10:04.370
He was a typical fucking fast food kit.
So anyways,
a new,

1137
01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:09.350
a new kid that just started working there a couple of weeks before thinking he

1138
01:10:09.351 --> 01:10:14.130
was doing the right thing.
Oh wait dude,
you read,

1139
01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:17.360
you read,
you know half the shit isn't my problem.

1140
01:10:17.361 --> 01:10:20.000
You guys don't write in complete sentences.
And it was a new kid,

1141
01:10:20.001 --> 01:10:22.760
this kind of rolling and a fucking join the goddamn table and the new kid

1142
01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:26.420
thought he was doing the right thing and he turned me into the manager on duty

1143
01:10:26.421 --> 01:10:27.254
that night.

1144
01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:32.270
The manager laughed at him because he couldn't care less about what I was doing,

1145
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:37.550
all the fact that his employees smoked weed.
That isn't that Nice,

1146
01:10:37.551 --> 01:10:40.460
but a great manager.
Next day when I go into work,

1147
01:10:40.461 --> 01:10:45.020
that same manager tells me what happened the night before.
I'm not pissed,

1148
01:10:45.021 --> 01:10:45.681
but I'm all like,

1149
01:10:45.681 --> 01:10:50.310
you know what the fuck does this guy would run to the manager and think they

1150
01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:51.800
need some sort of whistleblower.

1151
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:58.010
I decided so I decided that the guy needs to learn his lesson.
Jesus Christ.

1152
01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.910
Nice setup so far enough for you guys.
I'm enjoying this.
So anyways,

1153
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:06.940
I call up a friend of mine to get what I need and when the kid goes on his break

1154
01:11:08.271 --> 01:11:13.070
in order to lunch,
when he's not looking,
I dropped it.
Two hits of acid,

1155
01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.520
I brought two with me and his drink.

1156
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:22.490
Okay.
When I read that wrong,
I got two hits of acid.
Okay,

1157
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:24.263
you're not you guys.

1158
01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.810
Can you proof read these fucking things so I don't sound like the dumbest person

1159
01:11:27.811 --> 01:11:30.230
on you know what he did?
He took two hits of acid.

1160
01:11:30.231 --> 01:11:32.210
He dropped him in his fucking fruit punch.
So anyways,

1161
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:37.510
he sits down and he starts eating and I go back to work and I wait for it to

1162
01:11:37.851 --> 01:11:42.690
kick in and the entertainment to start.
All right,

1163
01:11:42.691 --> 01:11:45.450
I'm starting to get just guests.
The vibe with this story.
Evidently,

1164
01:11:45.451 --> 01:11:46.950
when he says your king the car,

1165
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:51.630
he doesn't mean that you're a pussy because you didn't do something face to
face.

1166
01:11:51.631 --> 01:11:55.140
Evidently this maniac doesn't think you took it far enough.

1167
01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:59.670
All right,
back to the story.
An hour later when he clocks back in,

1168
01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:01.920
I can tell it's beginning to kick in heart.

1169
01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:08.150
I watch the do gooder con starts to trip balls and freaks everyone out.

1170
01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:11.850
That's a trip balls and freaks everyone out.

1171
01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.820
Nobody else knows what is going on with the guy,

1172
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:17.790
so they lock him in the back manager's office,

1173
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:22.440
so this is really dangerous because he didn't know he was probably never done

1174
01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:24.180
drugs.
He probably thought he was going crazy.

1175
01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.360
It's really dangerous and fucking hilarious.
All right.
When he's in there,

1176
01:12:30.361 --> 01:12:34.260
he really starts to lose his shit and tear the place apart.

1177
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:38.370
My manager calls the cops and when they get there they go back and cuff.

1178
01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:42.510
They go back and cut them and put them in the back of a squad car.

1179
01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:46.290
There's a lot of confusion in the place and everyone tries to figure out what

1180
01:12:46.291 --> 01:12:47.220
the hell just happened.

1181
01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.880
The cop starts to question everyone to try and figure out just what went on,

1182
01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:53.880
but I play it off dumb just like everyone else saying.

1183
01:12:53.881 --> 01:12:58.530
He just started to act crazy too.
What do you have a life of crime?

1184
01:12:58.531 --> 01:12:59.570
You're playing that shit off,

1185
01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.910
not worry that you're going to get caught or you want to work release from

1186
01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:06.120
prison.
Anyways,
after taking everyone's statements,

1187
01:13:06.121 --> 01:13:08.550
the cops leave and caught the guy off.

1188
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:14.520
He never did come back to work or even show his place face in that place again.

1189
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:19.500
Don't know if it was out of embarrassment,
confusion to what happened,

1190
01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:24.870
sang on fusion to what happened or outright fear of the place,

1191
01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:26.910
so I don't know.
Whatever happened to them,

1192
01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.330
it's still is the best 15 bucks that I ever spent.

1193
01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:36.270
Jesus Christ.
Dude,
that's fucking hardcore,
man.

1194
01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:38.750
<v 8>I like</v>

1195
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:41.990
<v 7>it.
You confused as I dunno why.
I Dunno if he was embarrassed.</v>

1196
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:44.560
If he was confused to do.

1197
01:13:44.561 --> 01:13:47.780
You don't think he figured out what the fuck happened and he wasn't able to put

1198
01:13:47.781 --> 01:13:52.570
fucking one and one together and make to how big.

1199
01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:54.980
That's what I have to say really.
Instead,
rather than say,

1200
01:13:54.981 --> 01:13:59.330
put two and two together and get four,
this is how we,
this is one in one.
Well,

1201
01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.610
let's see,
I read it out so many people.

1202
01:14:01.611 --> 01:14:04.610
Do you think he read it out for doing drugs in the last 24 hours?

1203
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.090
Then all of a sudden he starts fucking tripping.
Wow.

1204
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:10.140
I'm such a sadistic fuck.

1205
01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:12.670
Maybe there would be a part me that would really enjoy that.

1206
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:17.560
Especially if he was like,
ah,
like always doing the right thing.

1207
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:18.731
You know what I mean?

1208
01:14:18.731 --> 01:14:22.090
You know people who always fuck up in life just really hate people who are doing

1209
01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:25.870
the right thing.
You know?
I told him,
I talked to you about these people,

1210
01:14:25.871 --> 01:14:28.600
they called conch and as much as I hate cons,

1211
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:31.060
I really am one when it comes to certain kinds of people,

1212
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:34.750
I have no tolerance for people who are pussies.
I don't,

1213
01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:36.880
and it's not because I'm a tough guy,

1214
01:14:36.881 --> 01:14:40.000
probably reminds me of a certain part of my personality that I don't like.

1215
01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:43.450
But in general,
you know who goes on and tell somebody,

1216
01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:46.180
you know what?
Fuck that guy.

1217
01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:49.060
What was he trying to take your position at the fryer layers so it could be

1218
01:14:49.061 --> 01:14:53.770
fucking Douche bag or the month.
Wow.

1219
01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:56.800
That really must have psychologically damaged and made me think about that.

1220
01:14:57.870 --> 01:15:01.260
You know his whole life,
that Mama's boy,
he probably always like,
you know,

1221
01:15:01.261 --> 01:15:05.590
and he is that his sandwich?
You now we swim and he didn't waste 15 minutes.

1222
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:07.270
Who?
That's very good.

1223
01:15:07.271 --> 01:15:10.960
Mikey always got rewarded for it and then he fucking ratchet you up.
Hey,

1224
01:15:10.961 --> 01:15:13.150
you know that fucking,

1225
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:17.440
you know guy over there smoking weed and then the manager.
So it's like,
yeah,

1226
01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.550
that's what you do.
We work in a fast food joint.

1227
01:15:21.551 --> 01:15:24.610
Do you think this was our dream in life for the love of God?

1228
01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:29.050
Somebody gives me a hit because I can't take the fucking pain or reality
anymore.

1229
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.950
Don't you go mop something up?
You're a little pussy.

1230
01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:36.310
That's probably what happened the next day.
It's like,
Geez,
I went home,

1231
01:15:36.311 --> 01:15:40.540
talked to his mom.
I couldn't believe it.
Gallery Jamey.
I mean he was doing,

1232
01:15:40.541 --> 01:15:42.220
he had a marijuana cigarette.

1233
01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:46.690
Well don't you worry you did the right thing.
Okay.

1234
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:50.080
And you just stay away from him and you go to work tomorrow and you make sure

1235
01:15:50.081 --> 01:15:50.914
you do a good show

1236
01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.440
and then it goes to work and he fucked a fucking puts the date rape drug in

1237
01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:58.850
there,
the date rape drug.
You know what I'm saying?

1238
01:15:58.851 --> 01:16:03.700
He puts acid and that Jesus Christ,
he never even had mentioned.

1239
01:16:03.701 --> 01:16:04.840
You've never even had a sip of beer in.

1240
01:16:04.841 --> 01:16:08.410
The first thing happens to is to hit the athletes.
I never took acid that God,

1241
01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:14.440
thank God.
Thank God I never ran out.
Somebody doing drugs.
Um,
anyways.
All right,

1242
01:16:14.441 --> 01:16:16.720
here's,
here's another revenge story.
I'm going to read this one,

1243
01:16:16.721 --> 01:16:21.400
then I got to wrap it up.
Uh,
hey bill.
Uh,
I'm with you on the no revenge rule.

1244
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.840
People suffer.
Oh,
this wasn't even a revenge thing.
This is just a question.

1245
01:16:25.841 --> 01:16:27.400
This guy needs some advice.
This,

1246
01:16:27.401 --> 01:16:32.401
this falls into the ass bill portion of the podcasts.

1247
01:16:32.801 --> 01:16:35.710
The advice people like to ask me for advice,
even though I'm a fucking moron.

1248
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:40.180
Let me just read this whole thing cause uh,
all right.
Anyways,

1249
01:16:40.181 --> 01:16:43.250
I was writing to you to talk about,
okay,
here,
here's the property s uh,

1250
01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:46.750
he needs some advice.
Anyways,
Bill,
I was writing to you to talk about my cons,

1251
01:16:46.751 --> 01:16:49.990
have a girlfriend and hopefully to get some advice.

1252
01:16:49.991 --> 01:16:54.070
I love how con is just become the catchphrase of the podcast here.
Anyways,

1253
01:16:54.071 --> 01:16:57.370
me and my girlfriend have been together for about two and a half years.

1254
01:16:58.210 --> 01:17:00.700
We knew each other as teenagers,
um,

1255
01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:04.210
along with some other people she dated.
Um,

1256
01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:08.920
she did it,
one of our friends and he eventually moved on and gotten married.

1257
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:12.200
Me and her remain friends and eventually we became close.
We started dating.

1258
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:17.560
She isn't the best friend.
Well I figured that.

1259
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:19.300
Consider your calling or a con.
Yeah,

1260
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:22.880
because she had a couple of things that annoyed yet she has the best girlfriend

1261
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:24.080
but I have become pretty,

1262
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:28.040
pretty comfortable having her around and her two kids,

1263
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:33.380
not for me,
love or two kids,
not for me.

1264
01:17:33.381 --> 01:17:36.110
They loved me and we have become quite the family.

1265
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:39.110
Here is where Shit went wrong

1266
01:17:40.670 --> 01:17:45.560
recently we visited our friends in New York and we are all partying and shit and

1267
01:17:45.561 --> 01:17:48.620
I got a horrible headache and sit down on the couch to rest it up.

1268
01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.670
I was out of it for like 30 minutes and I wake up to a nightmare.

1269
01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:58.040
I hear my friend in the kitchen hitting on my girlfriend.
Wow.

1270
01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.590
If it's as if that's not bad enough,

1271
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:05.120
she's into this shit and encourage him,
encouraging him and flirting back.

1272
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:07.190
After I had all I could take,

1273
01:18:07.191 --> 01:18:11.270
I walked into the kitchen and they made the oh shit face when they looked at me,

1274
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:14.090
but I didn't say anything.
Then I didn't say anything.

1275
01:18:14.091 --> 01:18:19.091
Then in there the next night for possibly or possibly the same nights since that

1276
01:18:19.131 --> 01:18:20.840
was hammered every day I was the fair,

1277
01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:26.030
me and my girlfriend go to bed in the guest room while we are laying there.

1278
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:29.870
She gets up to go to the bathroom and after she didn't return,

1279
01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:31.160
after about 15 minutes,

1280
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:35.840
I opened the door and what do I see him and her standing there alone in the

1281
01:18:35.841 --> 01:18:40.610
hallway,
having a quiet conversation.
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

1282
01:18:40.611 --> 01:18:43.820
this is getting creepy.
Here's her story.

1283
01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:47.930
She was just entertaining herself and it wasn't going to go anywhere.

1284
01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:51.880
She feels she didn't sleep with him or anyone else.
So I'm overreacting.

1285
01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.860
So I'm overreacting by considering breaking up,

1286
01:18:54.861 --> 01:18:59.270
considering all we really,
she have to lose.
Oh,

1287
01:18:59.271 --> 01:19:01.460
considering all that you guys have to loose.
Yeah.

1288
01:19:01.461 --> 01:19:04.520
It's really her with the two fucking kids.
All right.
So anyways,

1289
01:19:04.521 --> 01:19:08.240
she's been walking around crying and I'm upset about the shit she has told me

1290
01:19:08.241 --> 01:19:10.130
she was sorry and it will never happen again.

1291
01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:14.060
She has been pretty much worshiping me the last few days and the shit is

1292
01:19:14.061 --> 01:19:15.260
starting to eat away at me.

1293
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:20.030
I also know that I purchased most of the shit in this house and if slash when we

1294
01:19:20.031 --> 01:19:25.031
separate I'll be taking most of it with me and that is going to make it a lot

1295
01:19:25.341 --> 01:19:28.970
more difficult and painful for her and her kids at this point I'm like,

1296
01:19:28.971 --> 01:19:32.870
fuck all of this and I am ready to leave.
I'm ready to leave and shit,

1297
01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:36.200
but honestly I'm starting to feel like a real douche for not being able to get

1298
01:19:36.201 --> 01:19:37.034
past this shit.

1299
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:40.790
The kids will be devastated and they are pretty much doomed once I leave because

1300
01:19:40.791 --> 01:19:45.560
I am pretty much the glue that holds this family together.
At the same time,

1301
01:19:45.561 --> 01:19:49.340
I feel like if she would do this shit after years,

1302
01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:51.590
what kind of hope does that give us for the future?

1303
01:19:51.591 --> 01:19:54.800
What kind of relationship can we have app to some shit like this?

1304
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:56.480
I would love some feedback on this bill.

1305
01:19:57.110 --> 01:20:02.110
Even though you never read my letters during the podcast insert guiltier just

1306
01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:05.000
telling me what you think I should do in this situation.
All right dude.

1307
01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:10.710
A year in that classic halfway point between emotion,

1308
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.680
you know,
for your feelings,
for the kids,

1309
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:18.810
you're in the halfway point between that and knowing exactly what the fuck you

1310
01:20:18.811 --> 01:20:21.960
need to do and you're doing when you need to do,

1311
01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:26.961
you need to reach out to people who are going to re affirm what you know in your

1312
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:30.060
heart of hearts.
What you have to do is you have to get the fuck out of there.

1313
01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:33.000
You gotta get out of there.
All right.

1314
01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.760
Do you think that's the first guy she hit on?
You know,

1315
01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:41.040
and if she's hitting on guys,
that means she's probably fucking other guys.

1316
01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.680
And if she's not,
she's going to end.

1317
01:20:43.681 --> 01:20:47.400
Right now she's just in a panic mode and she's in a panic mode,

1318
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:51.750
not because she's worried about losing you because of all that other bullshit

1319
01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:58.130
that you mentioned because you sound like you're the most responsible of the

1320
01:20:58.441 --> 01:20:59.274
people there.

1321
01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:04.280
And the only fucking hope her kids have is that you'll stick around because she

1322
01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:09.950
is a,
I dunno,
she doesn't have her shit together.
Um,

1323
01:21:11.010 --> 01:21:15.040
you got to get out,
dude.
You got to get out and you know you,

1324
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:16.800
you might be good for the kids right now,

1325
01:21:16.801 --> 01:21:20.280
but eventually you're not going to be because of the misery that you're going to

1326
01:21:20.281 --> 01:21:21.114
have.

1327
01:21:21.150 --> 01:21:24.270
Being in a relationship with somebody that you can't trust as far as you can

1328
01:21:24.271 --> 01:21:29.070
fucking throw him is eventually gonna rub off on how you feel about the whole

1329
01:21:29.071 --> 01:21:29.904
situation.

1330
01:21:30.150 --> 01:21:34.260
And it's going to be really hard for you not to be a fucking douche around the

1331
01:21:34.261 --> 01:21:35.040
coast.
Kids,

1332
01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:38.850
you probably gonna start drinking and eventually you're going to start a fucking

1333
01:21:38.851 --> 01:21:42.090
relationship.
And the longer you're there,
the more shit you're going to buy.

1334
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:48.480
This is what you gotta do.
You gotta give yourself fucking six weeks,
all right?

1335
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.430
Just break it up in two week increments.

1336
01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:52.170
The first two weeks is going to be brutal.

1337
01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:57.420
Just cry on the floor with a pint of fucking Haagen daas like a little bitch and

1338
01:21:57.450 --> 01:21:58.283
get through it.

1339
01:21:58.410 --> 01:22:02.340
And every time you want to call that fucking cunt that you can't trust anymore,

1340
01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.140
you call a friend of yours.
Instead,

1341
01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:08.370
you call a buddy of yours to kind of buddy who's gonna fucking take you out

1342
01:22:08.371 --> 01:22:12.510
drinking and gets you back in the fucking game.
That's what you do.

1343
01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:15.750
All right?
And you do that and turn that time.

1344
01:22:15.751 --> 01:22:20.100
The last fucking thing you do is get into another relationship.
All right?

1345
01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:22.680
Don't fucking do that.
Don't do the J.
Lo,

1346
01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:26.760
we get out of that and you jump into something else.
Fuck that.
All right?

1347
01:22:26.970 --> 01:22:29.430
You stay fucking single,
you know,

1348
01:22:30.930 --> 01:22:34.320
and just just get through six fucking weeks in gradually,

1349
01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:38.610
and then after two weeks goes by,
you know what I mean?
You start having a life.

1350
01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.750
You'll start going down to the park,

1351
01:22:39.751 --> 01:22:41.430
playing Frisbee with your next door neighbor.

1352
01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:46.320
I don't know what the fuck you'll start filling up the time.
That's all it is.

1353
01:22:46.321 --> 01:22:49.860
And the breakup haven't been,
you know,
after like a few days,

1354
01:22:49.861 --> 01:22:52.240
unless you really love somebody,
you're already getting past them.

1355
01:22:52.410 --> 01:22:54.480
What you're really trying to do is wondering,

1356
01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:57.090
well what the fuck did I do during all this time?

1357
01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:00.720
How did I use to fill up my free time?
And that's what you got your boys for.

1358
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:04.350
They'll take you out,
go drink and go to games,
you know,

1359
01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:09.490
by the big fucking dust,
real size box of condoms,

1360
01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:14.650
just fucking,
you know,
Bang away,
do all this shit.
You got to do it.
But Dude,

1361
01:23:14.651 --> 01:23:16.180
you got to get out of that relationship.
You know,

1362
01:23:16.181 --> 01:23:18.730
you got to get out of the relationship and it sucks.
But you know what,
dude?

1363
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:23.830
It's a fucking,
it's a 20 minute conversation.
20 minutes.

1364
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:27.190
What you have to say takes fucking 30 seconds,

1365
01:23:27.191 --> 01:23:30.550
but you got to deal with fucking the next 20 minutes,

1366
01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:33.700
all her bullshit trying to use all these different techniques to try and get you

1367
01:23:33.701 --> 01:23:36.640
to stay.
She's going to go with the guilt.
He's going to go with the Stereo.

1368
01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:37.750
She's going to go with anger.

1369
01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:42.930
She's gonna fucking unload her female fucking gun of emotion that you and you

1370
01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:47.830
just have to stick to your fucking,
you gotta stick to your guns.
I'm out.

1371
01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:52.900
I'm out cause you fucked up.
You fucked up.
I can't trust you.
I can't trust you.

1372
01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:56.650
The relationship is over.
Relationship is over.
It's them.

1373
01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.560
Not only were you hitting on another guy hitting on my best friend,

1374
01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:02.680
you fucking cunt,
you untrustworthy fucking con.

1375
01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:05.500
And you let the balls to sit here and act like I'm going to fucking stay with

1376
01:24:05.501 --> 01:24:10.360
you.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Wait a minute.
Strike that.

1377
01:24:10.361 --> 01:24:11.470
Don't say that means shit.

1378
01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:15.070
Don't say that means shit cause then then you don't do it.
Don't do it like that.

1379
01:24:15.071 --> 01:24:19.480
Just say,
look,
I can't trust you.
You know what?
Yeah.
Fuck that.

1380
01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.810
I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.
You know what you gotta do.
All right,

1381
01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:27.100
but don't,
don't,
don't,
don't get sucked into a,
you know,
fuck you.
Fuck you.

1382
01:24:27.101 --> 01:24:30.340
Fight with her.
Right.
And she's going to do the usual shit that women always do.

1383
01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:35.230
Once she gets to the anger thing,
then uh,
she,
she'll go with,

1384
01:24:35.290 --> 01:24:39.940
she'll go with the usual chill somehow.
She'll question your sexuality,

1385
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:43.120
your,
your ability and bed.
She'll probably do that.

1386
01:24:43.121 --> 01:24:46.270
Well maybe if you fucking blah,
blah,
blah,
wouldn't be hitting on your friend.

1387
01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:49.330
She's just going to do that in a last ditch.

1388
01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:55.050
Hope that you're going to turn around blaster in the fucking face so she can get

1389
01:24:55.541 --> 01:24:58.600
a little more money out of you and you can go to jail and she can keep your

1390
01:24:58.601 --> 01:25:01.390
fucking playstation.
So don't get sucked into that.

1391
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:06.880
When she says that remark,
just be like,
yeah,
you know what?
Yeah,

1392
01:25:06.881 --> 01:25:10.660
I guess I guess I do suck in bed.
So you know,
have fun fucking my friend.

1393
01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:14.680
You know?
You seem like you really want to,
you know,
or whatever.

1394
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:19.270
That was the lane mostly.
That was good.
Okay.
Don't get sucked into that.

1395
01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:22.360
Don't get sucked into any sort of domestic violence thing.
All right.

1396
01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:25.870
I'm not trying to judge you,
but that's a really white tress sort of situation.

You're involved in there where you got this,

1400
01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:40.960
You know what I mean?
You got to stay single,

1401
01:25:40.961 --> 01:25:44.680
You got to figure out what the fuck is with you that you got yourself into this

1402
01:25:44.681 --> 01:25:47.890

You know those girls,

1406
01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.890
they don't know how to break up with you.
