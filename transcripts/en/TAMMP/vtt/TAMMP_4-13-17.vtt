1
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.990
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:06.150
Just before Friday.
Yeah.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.500
<v 0>Ah,</v>

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.040
<v 1>just checking in on you.
Just checking in on you,
seeing how you're doing.</v>

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.640
You having a good week.
Are you enjoying yourself?

6
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:22.940
I hope you're having a good fucking week.
Uh,

7
00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:27.510
I hope it's going better than my week.
I hope it's going better than my week.
Uh,

8
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.400
uh,
I don't know if I'll fucking,
I'll get right into it.
Uh,
unfortunately a,

9
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:37.170
a great comedian,
grade friend,
just one of the best people I haven't met,

10
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.340
uh,
passed away yesterday.
Charlie Murphy and um,

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.020
can't fucking believe it,
man.
Really cannot believe it.
I had,
um,

12
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.690
I hadn't talked to him in about a year and I had no idea that,

13
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:54.980
um,
that he was sick to that level.
So,
uh,

14
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.920
I think it's still hitting me,
man.
It's unbelievable.

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.040
I'm so sick of fucking hilarious.
Great people dying.

16
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:06.570
I was actually talking with a friend of mine the other day.
I was just like,
dude,

17
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:09.700
to hacks ever die.
Like what?

18
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.340
When was the last time somebody who truly sucked at standup comedy died?

19
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.750
It's fucking unbelievable.
What a hacks.
Eat this.
If I was

20
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.040
fired the fucking money,
I swear to God I'd get,
I get to get,
you know,
maybe,

21
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.201
you know,
it's funny,

22
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:30.300
I actually realize halfway through that said I'm still alive.

23
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:31.890
So when I kind of shitting on myself,

24
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.650
somebody got to put together the hack diet,
whatever that is.

25
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:39.710
Those motherfuckers lived to be like 85,
90.

26
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.940
Um,
anyways,
another just giant.

27
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.990
I mean you're talking about somebody who,

28
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:53.280
when I met him in 2004 had already lived like four lifetimes.

29
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.670
He had four unbelievable books from his childhood to his teenage years in,

30
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:04.181
in early twenties living in Brooklyn and all this shit that he did to going into

31
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:06.540
the navy,

32
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.980
to his brother blowing up and then him getting out of the navy and work in

33
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:15.981
security on the tour and then morphing in to like a screen writer and actor.

34
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.190
And then he gets on the Chappelle show,

35
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.860
just was sitting around us was that it was told to me just telling these stories

36
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.230
of,
you know,
back in the day,
hanging out with everyone from prince to Rick James,

37
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:36.570
you've seen all those things,
stories about Whitney Houston.

38
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:40.290
He just sugar ray Leonard,
Oj Simpson.

39
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:42.840
He just like that sketch,

40
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:46.080
which to this day I'm telling you is I think it's the greatest sketch of all

41
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:49.890
time,
the Charlie Murphy True Hollywood story about Rick James.

42
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.840
And uh,
I remember him telling me afterwards,

43
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.620
I was just like,
dude,
how true is that shit?
And he goes,
well yeah,

44
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:02.590
obviously we exaggerate.
Like,
you know,
he didn't,

45
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.580
when he hit me in the head I didn't have a unity,
you know,

46
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.820
thing and on my head.
But he's like,
yeah he did.

47
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.500
They were like in the back of the limo or something.
And,
you know,

48
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:18.530
Rick just kind of went to,
he was trying to be like friendly,
but it's like God,

49
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.610
they kind of hit Charlotte like hard enough in their head that I guess Eddie and

50
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:25.870
his friends were waiting for Charlie react cause they knew her.

51
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:30.100
Charlie was Charlie Kinda got mind fuck for half a second thinking like,

52
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.850
you know,
I'd stomped the shit out of anybody who did this to me,

53
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:37.540
but it's Rick James.
And it kind of took them like an hour before he was like,

54
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:41.920
fuck this.
And uh,
you know,
obviously didn't kick them up on a dresser,

55
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:45.640
but he did fucking rough them up a little bit in the back room.

56
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:47.050
And then when the security came in,

57
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:50.140
he did bring them over to the window and said that he was going to throw him
out.

58
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.670
They came anywhere near him.
So um,

59
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.940
yeah man,
it's just really a really a sad day and that guy was just,

60
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:02.830
and he was such a great guy.
I told you guys this story before,

61
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:06.490
he saved my fucking ass one time.
Um,

62
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.490
I was trying to get in shape,
right.
As always as I always am.

63
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.450
I was living in New York City and uh,

64
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.380
I started going down to Gleason's gym out in Brooklyn,
you know,

65
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:21.940
cause I didn't want to get all fucking,
you know,
I was joking.
Hillary Swank is,

66
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:24.670
I believe what I was calling myself and they were giving me shit because I just

67
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:28.390
went down there and an actor performer kind of way to get in boxing shape

68
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:31.330
without ever fucking,
you know,
getting my head kicked in.

69
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.950
So when I told Charlie that I was going down to Gleason's gym,
he goes,

70
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.800
I just want to go going,
oh yeah,
okay,
okay,

71
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:40.000
I'm going to tell you what's going to happen

72
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.450
because you'll be able to have about six weeks and out of nowhere he goes,

73
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:49.870
some dude's going to come up to you and start telling you,
it'd be like a,

74
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.110
how long have you been boxing for?
Really are man,
you nice man,

75
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:56.410
you're not shooting.
We had a sparse some time.
He goes,
he's gonna fucking,

76
00:04:56.411 --> 00:05:01.411
he's going to amp you all up to get you into the ring so he can try out a bunch

77
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:05.170
of shit that he does that he's not dumb enough to try out on a professional

78
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:08.890
boxer and he's going to beat the fuck out of you.
And I was just like,

79
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.740
and he just started laughing at me.
I'm like,
Hey,
I get the fuck Outta here.

80
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:14.650
Get the fuck I do.
I'm telling you,
I was like raw,
whatever time.
He said,

81
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:18.820
three weeks or six weeks,
it was like right on the nose.
I'm sitting there,

82
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:20.200
you know,
and the heavy bag,

83
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.190
like the comedian slash sometimes act or I am hitting the bag like [inaudible]

84
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.770
right in this fucking black dude.
Shredded comes over.

85
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.890
He's like,
Yo man.
He goes,
well,
how long have you been,
how long you've been box?

86
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.410
It was like,
it was almost like Charlie's head was on the guys head.

87
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:42.530
He said the exact same thing.
Oh Man,
United Smith,

88
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.140
you want to get in the fucking ring and all this shit.

89
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:48.670
And I just started laughing.
I just started laughing.
I was like,
I go,
man,
fuck,

90
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:51.700
I'll fuck like I'm a fucking comedian.
Um,
horrific.

91
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:54.070
I'm not getting in there so you can try out all your new shit on me.

92
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.500
And the guy just started laughing,
threw his head back,
laughed,
then walked away.

93
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.250
And it was so weird.
I was like,
that guy was going to beat the fuck out of me.

94
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.770
So then I told them to Charlie thinking that he would be amazed

95
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.460
that,
you know,
you know,
like,
like dude,
I called it,
what the fuck did I say?

96
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:18.260
And he was just like,
yeah,
he's like,
I told you he did that like a million times.

97
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:21.740
Like he just had this,
um,
I dunno,

98
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:24.980
he had like this fucking sixth sense.

99
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:29.030
And I'd tell you some of those other stories,
the Oj one in the Whitney one,

100
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:31.700
but I just feel like those are hit.
That was what his stories to tell.

101
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:33.800
And if you wanted to share him,
he would've,
but,
um,

102
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.660
so I can only tell you the ones I remember when we won that Chappelle show tour,

103
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:43.160
it was me,
you know,
dawn,
Al Ashy,
Larry and him.

104
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.910
And Charlie was the guy who actually showed me that you could write a new hour

105
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:53.180
of material in two months because I saw him do it

106
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.410
cause he blew up,
you know,
on on the second season with that,

107
00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:03.960
that Rick James Story
and um,
all of this,

108
00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:07.390
Don l came up with the idea for the tour.
He was like,
you know,
Yo son,

109
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.710
we should go out on tour,
blah blah.
So,
you know,
we'll have bill open up,
you know,

110
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.550
we'll bring you out Charlie,
you can host it.
And then Don l would close.

111
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.130
And um,
I think Charlie maybe did,

112
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.940
this is the fucking balls this guy had,

113
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:26.890
I think he did maybe six shows before we did our first show.

114
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.230
And I believe it was Dayton,
Ohio.

115
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.290
And we didn't even have an agent and Donald book the thing.
And uh,

116
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.060
so we went out there.
I was like the only white guy in the room in the theater.

117
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.290
And we went out there and Charlie hosts anyone out and just went,
Charlie Murphy,

118
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.220
you know,
uh,
I'm Rick James Bitch or something like that place went fucking nuts.

119
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.330
He told like two more jokes brought me out.
And everybody's looking at me like,

120
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:57.100
who the fuck is this guy?
Is this one of the writers?
This is one of the creators.

121
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.610
Is this the agent on the tort?
Nobody had any idea who the fuck I was.

122
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.140
So I did my bullshit.

123
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.850
Charlie came out and told another couple of jokes and then don l close to show

124
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.470
everybody had a great time.
And um,

125
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.760
afterwards we went into the back room.
Okay,

126
00:08:12.761 --> 00:08:15.910
now we're in the green room and there's like 20 people in there and we don't

127
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:20.080
know anybody.
Once again,
I'm the only white dude in there.
Me,
Don,

128
00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:25.081
Ellen Charlia sitting at this table and all of a sudden these two guys come up.

129
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.820
What was it at one guy I can't remember,

130
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.880
and just had like a fucking bag of cash from that night's Gig Edge.

131
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.680
He had it all bandaged up and just threw it on the table and it all spilled out.

132
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:43.460
And it was just sitting there
and I was sitting there like,
what the fuck?

133
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.680
And Darnell and Charlie did move.

134
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:48.580
So I didn't move and I was just sitting there as the white dude,
like going,

135
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.600
I guess this is how black people pay each other.

136
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.250
They have 20 complete strangers in the fucking room,

137
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:58.740
drinking and partying and then just a bunch of cash.

138
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.090
I fell like we robbed a bank or something.
So we sat there,

139
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:08.091
I swear to God for at least one more mob deep song or whatever the fuck was

140
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:12.960
playing at that time.
The Thong Song,
I can't remember what era it was.

141
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.920
And uh,

142
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.950
finally I forget it was either Donnelle or Charlie just soda casually sat up and

143
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:23.610
just took the money,
put it in the bag and then put it down by their side,

144
00:09:23.611 --> 00:09:26.130
which made me relax a little bit more.
And I was just like,

145
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.700
I was sitting there going like,
I don't think I'm ready for this fucking tour.

146
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.610
This is not the way you get paid at the funny bone.

147
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So we stayed there maybe for like another half hour and then we finally go up to

148
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:47.271
get up to leave and we're just walking out and you just feel an eyeballs honest.

149
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:52.920
Cause we got this big bet,
it's just cash.
And we go out,

150
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:56.690
we get into the fucking,
they had rented this fucking Limo Force.

151
00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.740
We got in the car and the second the car door is closed and we start driving

152
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:04.530
away,
Darnell just goes,
Yo,
what the fuck?

153
00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:09.090
And Charlie was just freaking out and I just start and I was just like,

154
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.840
just the epiphany that they were actually freaking out to what,
I had no idea.

155
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:14.280
You'd never know looking at their face.

156
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:18.330
I'm sure everybody in the room knew that I was fucking uncomfortable.
And um,

157
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:23.610
suffice to say,
after that we got ourselves an agent and uh,

158
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:28.860
we got,
we got paid by check after that.
It was just us in the room.

159
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.500
Um,
and that was that infamous tour where they would always make fun of,

160
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.860
that's where that Joe came from.
You know,
this mother fucker got five shirts.
Um,

161
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.470
that's where that one came from because they always made fun of my clothes.

162
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:44.220
And there was that time when I was hung over and I just didn't want to get in

163
00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:47.670
the car and deal with this shit.
And they had taught me about the Itis,

164
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:52.410
which was basically when you eat like a food that's rich in flavor but low in

165
00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:54.540
fucking nutrition you body,

166
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.870
you end up taking a quick cat nap cause your body literally has to shut

167
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:01.350
everything else down to figure out how to digest what you just put in your

168
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.101
stomach.

169
00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:06.480
So I was standing outside this hotel hung over as hell and I just thought,

170
00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:08.610
oh my God,
we were doing that.
Used to be the,

171
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.220
it was the Chicago xannies and then you do Mount Vernon and then uh,

172
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.330
Saint Charles,
it was his three Gig run through the Northern Illinois.

173
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.770
I forget what we just unsane he's and I was too drunk.

174
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.830
I had a fucking headache and I'm walking out,
try and get fresh air going.

175
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.400
I've got to deal with these two fucking assholes all the way up to this club.

176
00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:32.580
It's a two hour drive.
The nonstop going to be fucking hammering me.

177
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.170
I looked down the street and there was a Popeye's and I just remember them

178
00:11:37.171 --> 00:11:39.600
telling me about the itis and I said,
fuck this.
And I went down there,

179
00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:44.160
I got a bucket of chicken biscuits with mashed potatoes,
gravy,
all of that shit.

180
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:47.940
And I brought it into the end of the fucking limo and I was like,
hey guys,

181
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:49.590
I've got some food that,
ah,
Greg,
you know,

182
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:53.040
and they dug it and they started eating and I didn't have one piece of it and

183
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:56.130
swear to God within 20 minutes they were both asleep.
And I had,

184
00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:01.040
they slept the entire fucking ride.
I basically poisoned a

185
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.640
temporary poison him and it worked like a Goddamn charm.

186
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.760
And,
um,
I dunno,
I just,
I,

187
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.910
I had to say something about Charlie's still too sad to really get into the

188
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.480
feelings of aliveness,
but um,
he truly was one,
not only

189
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.780
one of the most amazing just lives of anybody ever lived.

190
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.400
He just was truly one of the best guys that,
um,

191
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.340
that I haven't met in this business.
So.

192
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.790
All right,
that's it.
No getting emotional on the podcast.
Okay,

193
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:51.290
so let's get back to the rest of this stuff here.
Um,

194
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.360
the fucking Bro,
it's,
ah,

195
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:58.660
finally the first time all year we beat the Ottawa senators.

196
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.890
All right.
Beat him when it counts.
Like,

197
00:13:00.891 --> 00:13:03.290
I didn't even realize they beat us all four times this year.
Well,

198
00:13:03.291 --> 00:13:07.490
congratulations.
Ottawa capital of Canada,
you know,

199
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:12.450
but unfortunately your full game winning streak came to an end,

200
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.450
right when it counted.

201
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:15.780
<v 0>Okay.</v>

202
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.950
<v 1>You are the weirdest part of that game was,
was listening to a loud,</v>

203
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.810
Otto was centered offense.
You know,
I actually know something.

204
00:13:24.811 --> 00:13:28.110
I used to think that tiff fans would just lean.
But the real reason is Ottawa.

205
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.810
It's just like Washington DC,
you know,
it's the capital.

206
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.360
So there's a bunch of people from all over the fucking country.

207
00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:37.650
So there's a bunch of conduct fans,
flames,
oiler fans,
all that bullshit.

208
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.860
They're sitting there,
they don't give a fuck about the senators,
you know?

209
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.830
So it's not the people,
the Ottawa,
they're great people.

210
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.650
They got a little fucking river that they freeze over.

211
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.550
You Skate to work does not.
They made,
it's like a fucking fantasy line up there.

212
00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:51.780
It's one of my favorite cities.

213
00:13:51.781 --> 00:13:55.870
I actually like it for some reason they say auto or the city that fun for God.

214
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.830
Well,
you know what,
I always have a great time when I go there.
Um,
and um,

215
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.750
what a fucking great game though.
Autoplay grade.

216
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.320
I by no means think that victory means that we're going to win the series.

217
00:14:07.321 --> 00:14:09.900
I think it's gonna I think it was two to one.

218
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.420
I feel like the whole s series is going to kind of go like that and it's going

219
00:14:13.421 --> 00:14:18.090
to get even,
uh,
not even shippy.
I think it might get a little ugly.

220
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:23.250
Um,
Brad Marshawn back from his suspension doing what he does.

221
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:28.170
Score and big goals and big games.
Um,
hey nia.

222
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.140
Camair

223
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.983
<v 0>okay,</v>

224
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.880
<v 1>I didn't know that.
Brad Mars.
Sean,
where are you?</v>

225
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:39.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

226
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.370
<v 1>I had never heard this nickname.
Brad Marshawn.</v>

227
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.280
They call them nose face killer.
Cause,

228
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.860
and I thought I was being so original when I called that guy on a fuck.

229
00:14:50.861 --> 00:14:53.900
That's because he sounds like ghost face killer.

230
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:57.270
I called him pot roast pot rose face killer.
Is that what I was

231
00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.640
here I am on my hat.
Look at that parallel thinking parallel thought.

232
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:07.550
There you go.
Is that what it's called?
What?
Do you know more than I do?

233
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.940
Is that what's said behind my back?
No,

234
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.920
I'm doing all right.
I'm doing all right.
The Bruins one.

235
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.340
I haven't been on the podcast in a while.
Now you have it once you grab the mic,

236
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.180
grab a microphone to come on in here.
I'll hit pause.

237
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.530
All right.
Went Back.
I got the microphone and everything like that.

238
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:32.210
The lovely Nia.
Hello.
How they hell?
Hell yeah.
The hell you Ben.
I know.

239
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.270
Long time.
No Fuck Hell podcasts.
No,

240
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:37.910
I don't think you've really been on that much since.
Uh,

241
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.970
we had the little princess here.
That's right.
Who's sitting here.

242
00:15:40.971 --> 00:15:43.730
You know what's funny is because you know her hair still short and everything

243
00:15:43.731 --> 00:15:47.510
and all of our friends had boys and they just gave us all their clothes.

244
00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:51.500
Everyone keeps thinking it's a boy
and she just came in.

245
00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:55.370
Now she's got a little shirt on.
That is like a classic,

246
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:59.540
that looks like a 1955 Chevy pickup truck on it.
So yeah.

247
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.200
So a everyone,
yeah,
everyone thinks that she is a boy,
but that's okay.

248
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.340
She will not be defined by her gender rights.
Yes,

249
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.160
she will put on a dress for God sakes.

250
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.840
I liked the little play close though.
I think they're so cute.
Well,
yeah,

251
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:19.610
I mean I don't care either way.
You know you look good to me.
That kiddo.

252
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.270
Yeah.
She doesn't have to be like all frilly and princess looking.

253
00:16:23.271 --> 00:16:27.440
I'm not really into that anyway.
What do you say it?
What do you mean?
Well,

254
00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:30.800
at some point you mean you got to put her with some girls clothes,
right?
Yeah.

255
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:35.060
I have plenty of girls clothes for her.
Okay.
You scare me there.
Okay.
Why?

256
00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:38.980
What do you,
why?
Why are you scared?
Well,
I mean at some point you didn't keep,

257
00:16:38.981 --> 00:16:43.190
can't say ever walking around with like,
you know,
Pete Carroll,
dockers and stuff,

258
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.050
you know,
but well now we're not going to do that.

259
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.010
But like I think how she's daddy's little girl,

260
00:16:49.011 --> 00:16:52.070
but I think little girls look cute and like little boy clothes,

261
00:16:52.071 --> 00:16:55.310
like the little tomboy.
Look,
I think that's cute.
You know what is,
yeah.

262
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.450
As long as she has clothes on into diapers clean at this point,
I'm happy.
Right.

263
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:04.040
I really don't care what it is
exactly it.
But so anyways,

264
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:08.960
she wore a cute little dress on Easter,
remember?
Oh yes,
she did.

265
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.640
I remember how much of been she went to East to west.
So he used to bought it.

266
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.520
Yeah.
It's not like we go to church or anything like that.
Where he then,
oh,

267
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:20.600
by the way,
Leah,
did I tell you about that great band I saw the other night?
Oh,

268
00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:22.590
you mean the one with Davey?
Let's,
yeah,

269
00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.950
the guy have been taking drum lessons from,
you know,

270
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.430
one of the best farmers in the world right now.
Shout out to Davy.
That's right.

271
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.180
He plays drums in this band called the night game and they have a new single
out,

272
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:36.170
if you want to check it out.
It's on iTunes.
It's called the,
um,
the outfield.

273
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:41.570
And,
uh,
I saw them play like a quick half hour set the other night,

274
00:17:41.571 --> 00:17:45.200
right.
Uh,
over capitol records were across the street from that.

275
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.640
Remember when I walked over and then had my,
my issue,
have you done that?

276
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.050
I've been doing cardio like a madman.
Maybe some,

277
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.570
some arenas can to ease of advice about this brutal cardio like a madman,

278
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:03.030
but like Jordan shorts on and I don't know what happened by balls.
My Ball,

279
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:04.410
one of them was just,

280
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.240
I just did too much walking in one day and I had a little chafing issue on one

281
00:18:09.241 --> 00:18:12.540
side of the old bag there.
And uh,

282
00:18:12.541 --> 00:18:16.470
it did not affect my enjoyment of the band cause I walked like,

283
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:20.490
it's like a two mile walk over there or something.
Right.

284
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.270
What are you doing?
You're looking at me or you're going to hurt two miles over.

285
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:27.570
And then two miles back in that after I'd already done an hour of cardio.

286
00:18:27.571 --> 00:18:32.571
So the next day I was walking like I wrote a horse for like six weeks straight.

287
00:18:33.181 --> 00:18:36.180
But anyways,
I went over and saw this show and they have a singer,

288
00:18:36.181 --> 00:18:39.680
a Martin Johnson.
Amazing singer.
And then two killer guitarist.

289
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.270
I hope they say these names right.
A Kirin j

290
00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.880
you go colonian Max Bernstein.

291
00:18:47.881 --> 00:18:51.720
And then they had a guy sitting in on base,
uh,
Andrew Peruzzi and uh,

292
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.200
two days sounded fucking,
I mean it's really like poppy type stuff,

293
00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:59.910
but the level of musicianship,
how great they all sounded live.
Um,

294
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.130
definitely check it out.
Once again,

295
00:19:02.131 --> 00:19:05.580
it's called the name of the band is the night game and the single is the

296
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.680
outfield and that is outright now.

297
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.550
So can we talk about your chief balls?

298
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.591
Oh,
it's done.

299
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:17.070
It was just what I was one and done was one day of uncomfortableness.
Oh,

300
00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:19.350
you're okay now.
Oh yeah.
Oh good.
Okay.

301
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.910
I was suggesting that bill gate gold bombs medicated powder because I just felt

302
00:19:23.911 --> 00:19:27.630
like that was just something that you just dust on your balls a little bit.

303
00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:28.660
He kept saying,
you know,

304
00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.720
like when those great chefs put the powdered sugar on chronic infections,

305
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:37.770
do that little,
but no,
I think that's your balls a little bit to keep it.

306
00:19:37.771 --> 00:19:40.550
That's not for chafing.
No,
that's,

307
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.080
but I thought that's what people have itchy balls,

308
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.110
itchy balls and they're sweaty.
And so therefore,
so then I'm like this,

309
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:51.830
it's a culture.
Like you're going to make bread but it's your ball red ball.

310
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.120
That's disgusting.
No,
this is just a,
yeah,
a chafing.

311
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.700
You know what I mean?
Gary Chafee.
Alright.

312
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:07.060
She's chiming in here.
The third Mike.
Um,
anyways,
it's funny.

313
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.560
Anyways.
Yeah.
So that is,
uh,
that is all,
this is going to be difficult.
And I mean,

314
00:20:11.561 --> 00:20:15.660
you know,
we got the third one.
I don't know.
Well this is why the heads to me.
Why,

315
00:20:15.661 --> 00:20:16.850
you know,
Hans,
what are likely,

316
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.230
you haven't been on the podcast in a while because they,
you know,
I have,

317
00:20:19.231 --> 00:20:23.220
so I have to watch her.
She is,
look how happy she is.

318
00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:26.820
She's such a happy baby.
I'm actually,
it's like that.
She's really chill.

319
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.610
And so people keep saying she's a really relaxed,
happy baby,

320
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.300
which is unbelievable considering she lives with me and I've been doing,

321
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.900
I've been going really hard with the whole trying to be chill.
Right.

322
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.080
Have a good job.
I'll go and really hard with the Chili.
Yeah.

323
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.060
He always had to take it to the extreme.
I know you said to me the other day,

324
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.380
did you have you been meditating lately?

325
00:20:46.381 --> 00:20:49.570
That's when I know getting a little up to the little press a piece there.

326
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.920
Press a piece.
Yeah.
So I got,
uh,
I got a fucking,

327
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:56.230
I got to handle that type of stuff.
So,
um,
hey,

328
00:20:56.231 --> 00:20:58.960
the Celtics got the number one seat,
then number one,

329
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:01.960
lead number one seat in the east.
So we get some seed.

330
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.190
S e d like what I've put in,
you have to have their babies,
except this is like,

331
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.190
yes,
that's a good point.
The balls are going to definitely be tough.

332
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:15.640
We're not trying to look past them and uh,

333
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.800
it was just was a great night as far as uh,
you know,

334
00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:22.130
considering the tragedy of yesterday,
the broads wherein the Habs lose weight.

335
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.060
But tell me what a seed is again.
Just like,

336
00:21:25.061 --> 00:21:28.570
did you know they'll have whatever at this 10 teams you just ranked the number

337
00:21:28.571 --> 00:21:32.260
one seed means you have the best record.
Why do they use the word seed?

338
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.530
You know what?
I don't know.
Hope I'm saying that right.
It's not,
yeah,

339
00:21:37.531 --> 00:21:39.580
the number one seat.
Yeah.
The uh,

340
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:41.620
I don't know why they call it that is what is the position,

341
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.510
what do you want to call?
So then when you get to the,

342
00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.990
you were rewarded for having your best for having the best record.

343
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.620
We're number one gets to play the lowest person that just made the playoffs.

344
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.670
So you get to kind of go an easier way to go through class and it's also,

345
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:59.080
it kind of makes it so when you get to the later rounds that the best teams are

346
00:21:59.081 --> 00:22:04.000
playing in,
the stakes are even higher.
This is to go to the NBA final.
Gotcha.

347
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:08.890
This is to go to the,
uh,
you know,
this is the when the whole damn thing,

348
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:13.420
except in hockey,
hockey of course they do everything weird where,
you know,

349
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.740
for whatever reason,
um,
like Pittsburgh has to play the blue jackets.

350
00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.620
And I would've thought that I was like the capital's,

351
00:22:20.621 --> 00:22:23.320
I would've thought they would've got Toronto.
I Dunno,

352
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.110
I don't get how they do it over there,
but I've,
that's definitely hockey.

353
00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:30.970
But we won.
We won the shit in a,
sorry,
I'm all distracted today.
Um,

354
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.190
I have to read some advertising.
Is there anything you want to give me?

355
00:22:33.191 --> 00:22:36.790
Shit about my balls are better than it was only one of them.
Good.
Hello?
I mean,

356
00:22:36.791 --> 00:22:41.620
I'm glad you used what I gave you for them.
And I'm also like a,
a,
a,

357
00:22:41.621 --> 00:22:46.540
a,
I'm like a plane.
You know what I mean?
Like one of those big jet planes,

358
00:22:46.541 --> 00:22:50.320
the,
they can lose one engine still flying,
so I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Ghastly.
I know.

359
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.940
Why was it only the one ball?
I don't know.
Why is one ball bigger than the other?

360
00:22:54.941 --> 00:22:59.430
Is that why it's like rubbing a little bit more now?
Is it like how,
you know,

361
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.590
you know what,
it probably your boobs are different sizes now.

362
00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.530
It probably has more to be with my awful posture,

363
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:08.230
my back being fucked up and one shoulder in front of the other one.

364
00:23:08.231 --> 00:23:09.064
I'm just a mess.

365
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:13.180
I'm all for all this years of hanging onto the anger and not stretching.
Um,

366
00:23:13.181 --> 00:23:16.450
just to twist it up and mess.
But I'll tell you I happened stretching.

367
00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:19.400
I would go to a chiropractor and of of uh,

368
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.860
I'm a sous regularly for almost suck a year.
And had I not done that,

369
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:26.050
God knows what would have,
I probably would have lost a nut.

370
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:33.870
What I still need to know cause I asked you and you weren't sure what a jock

371
00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:38.550
strap is used for.
Jock strap is same as a cup and now it's,

372
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:43.450
you control it.
It,
uh,
it holds all your,

373
00:23:43.451 --> 00:23:47.990
your junk.
It just has no consideration whatsoever for your ass.

374
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.830
I've never understood,
I've never run a storm.

375
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.360
It's sort of the male thong.
And if you don't want like guy underwear lines,

376
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.700
I don't know why your ass is all the way out.
I don't know what it is.

377
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:05.170
I don't know what the four for source sports though.
It's called a jockstrap.

378
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.690
It's for a jocks.
Well let's look it up.
Let's have this on my search engine.

379
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:11.330
What's the deal?

380
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:16.640
What's the deal with watts with y jock straps.
Yeah.

381
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:23.360
All
right.
A jock strap is also known as a Jock,

382
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.170
jock straps,
straps,
supporter or athletic supporter,

383
00:24:27.171 --> 00:24:32.171
and is an undergarment for supporting the male genitalia during cycling sports

384
00:24:32.181 --> 00:24:36.550
or other vigorous physical activity.
Oh,
it's a sports bra for your penis.
Yeah.

385
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.560
If he had junk.
So now lop all over the place.
Yeah,

386
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.500
but evidently you don't mind if your ass is hanging out and now commonly worn as

387
00:24:45.501 --> 00:24:50.420
everyday underwear.
Fashion job laughs.
Appear in variety of colors.

388
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:54.580
Do they?
Yes,
they do.
Well now you to go image Nia,

389
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:59.190

Let's,
Oh hey.

390
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.900
You'd go,
wow.
There's one for you.
It's a great asset.
And that guy,

391
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.420
my God,
that was like reverse Victoria's secrets.

392
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:13.550
That was fucking horrible.
All right,
and is your answer.
You had a nice ass.

393
00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.180
You have to have a nice ass if you're going to model those things,
right?
Yeah.

394
00:25:17.181 --> 00:25:19.130
It's like if nobody wants to look at,
you know,

395
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.850
the same way a woman with a flat s and a Thong is one of the worst things you

396
00:25:22.851 --> 00:25:24.650
could ever see.
Yeah.
You need a new literally,

397
00:25:24.651 --> 00:25:28.190
see you don't like it doesn't disappear.
You can see the hole,

398
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.790
you can see the whole thing.
MMM,
that's right.
All the way to the front.

399
00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.100
Okay,
well I got to do some sort of a,

400
00:25:37.101 --> 00:25:40.100
I got to do a little reading out loud and I don't want my daughter to know how

401
00:25:40.101 --> 00:25:41.510
dumb I am.
So if you guys,

402
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.720
I'm not kicking you out but I'm just saying if you want to block your ears,

403
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:49.040
ear muffs here.
Um,
you read to her all the time.

404
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.520
He read great.
I actually do a good job with those books.
But you know,

405
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.400
you also add lib throughout the entire book.

406
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.420
Kind of like the way you do advertising.
You don't,

407
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:03.460
it was like this weird thing where the guys,
the ducks,
like an absence seat.

408
00:26:03.461 --> 00:26:04.294
Father,

409
00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.150
he has like six kids with these like guy taken off going to Boston common,

410
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.840
I'll meet you over there.
It's like I trust you.
You're a good mother.

411
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:15.080

412
00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.220
She did everything but say,
yeah,
this is where I belonged.

413
00:26:19.221 --> 00:26:24.221
When granted the book was written in like the 30s or the forties and then the

414
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.020
Little Mermaid Little Mermaid were,
yeah,
that whole thing was weird.

415
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.740
It's like she looks up love at first sight with the prince.
Yeah,

416
00:26:30.741 --> 00:26:33.590
he's got his own effin boat.
Can't curse when she's here.

417
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.920
I probably already did the dead,
Huh?
That's okay.
That's all right.

418
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.560
Nice little cutie pie girl curse and I think it's hilarious.
That warms my heart.

419
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:48.720
No right upside everybody.
Okay,
here's some advertising.
Sorry.
Okay.
Hey guys.

420
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.870
I discovered something really big.
I going to tell you,

421
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:54.000
I have no idea what this is,
so I haven't discovered anything.

422
00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:54.834
I'm just reading the shit.

423
00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.130
The best new wave for you to buy travel.

424
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:04.580
It's called upside.com here's why I love it even though I've never seen it and

425
00:27:04.891 --> 00:27:09.660
why everyone I tell loves it.
Every time you buy a trip at upside,

426

427
00:27:16.921 --> 00:27:21.300
$300 every time.
That makes no sense.

428
00:27:21.301 --> 00:27:23.970
How would they make any money?
Like a plane ticket costs 300 bucks.

429
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.730
You get a hundred bucks back.

430
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.580
What are you flying people's express you and you'll value jet there.
The way,

431
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.000
uh,
the way they do it is really clever.
Upside bundles,

432
00:27:36.001 --> 00:27:40.640

So upside gives you free Amazon gift cards.

436
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:53.040
I'm telling you,
if you're a frequent basis,

437
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:56.550

438

439
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.220
Oh God,

You'd be crazy not to checkout upside.com if you're shopping the business pretty

442

for business or personal travel.

443
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.190
It takes just three months to see how much you saved by buying your flights and

444
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:21.990
hotel together at one low price.

445
00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.860
I can't believe it's taken this long for someone to do it.

DSTL jeans,
Delta Sierra,

00:33:26.121 --> 00:33:29.150
Lima genes.

they're not to be complicated with the thumper if you're not crazy.

527

It's a crazy stitching.
The diamonds and embedded studs,
you're not alone.

528
00:33:37.161 --> 00:33:39.800
I know that taking a shot at true religion,
religion,
jeans,

529
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.850
are they still in business and now they are.

They're all baggy and shit and all that.
Like anywhere.

532
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.690
Nobody wears it.
It's over.
There was to cut.

533
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.760
There's only two people I knew that bought those in my,
my,

534
00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.510
my circle rich vos rich vos and Bobby Kelly,

535
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:06.580
both of them.
They're under those disco clothes.
Designer energy.
Absolutely.

536
00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:08.590
I think one of them had their name in,
in,

537
00:34:08.591 --> 00:34:12.490
in Diann mills on the back of his ass.
I swear to God he did.

538
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.140
I think rich vos in the back of his true religion jeans had first white guy on

539
00:34:17.141 --> 00:34:21.100
def jam and,
and genuine Diann mills.

540
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.570
Was he the first white guy on def jam you just made?

541
00:34:25.571 --> 00:34:28.390
That's what was on his head shot when I first met him.
Uh,
it's hilarious.

542
00:34:28.391 --> 00:34:31.840
It was a picture of him doing def jam.
Oh,
there you go.
That's right.

543
00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.850
To show you making history,
breaking barriers,
right.
Richard Vase.

544
00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.590
This is one small step for a white man.

545
00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:44.020
One giant leap for all white men,
comedians,
Ms. Rich Abbas.
I don't,

546
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.730
I hope you hear this rich.
Go Fuck Yourself.
He's not going to hear it.

547
00:34:48.731 --> 00:34:52.810
He's out on a golf course.
Rich Vos has been like officially retired.

548
00:34:52.811 --> 00:34:56.530
The way he's been living since I met him.
He lives the good life.

549
00:34:56.531 --> 00:34:58.970
He calls more than Trump by the way.

550
00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:03.680
I love that Trump has just gotten his ass off.

Really?
What?

604
00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:48.880
When is this album coming out?
June 2nd that's my birthday.
I always forget.

605
00:38:48.881 --> 00:38:53.530
I always even think it's the second or the third to you really.
Is that true?

606
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.720
You're not that important to me.
Oh my God.

607
00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.160
But you know what I used to think of your birthday was on the eighth but we're

608
00:39:00.161 --> 00:39:03.510
not good with dates.
No,
we're not.
We don't want to anniversary.

609
00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:06.310
When's our ones are,
don't tell these people.
But to,

610
00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:10.910
can you name our wedding anniversary?
I always get confused.
So do I.
It's a,

611
00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:15.630
it's fine if we tell them no.
Okay.
Something has to be for,
I feel like no,

612
00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:20.230
some of that has to be for us.
Well we never show pictures from it.
Um,

613
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.390
so you don't know.
I do.
It's either does it start with a one or a two?

614
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.940
It's as are the two,
but I don't know what the second,

615
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:36.130
this is great because now I can never get in trouble.
You'll be like,

616
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:39.910
you're on the road on our anniversary.
It's like what did you look it up?

617
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.010
You don't even know what it is.

618
00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:47.060
I am fairly certain that I know it.

619
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.500
Yeah,
that's it.
Do you know what?
I had to think about it the other day.

620
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.980
We know the month,
but yeah,
we got that going right.

621
00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:01.840
How does this relationship work?
I don't know,
but it's been going for 13 years,

622
00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:04.930
so obviously we're doing something right and we have this one.

623
00:40:04.931 --> 00:40:09.040
You skated away from that really quickly.
Let's not try to analyze this.

624
00:40:09.041 --> 00:40:13.170
Let's not pull any sticks out of the popsicle house here.
Um,

625
00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:17.920
so what's going on today?
Am I watching her at all?
Yes.
When,
um,

626
00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:28.420
when a well,
you're especially watching her later today while I get my eyelashes.

627
00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:31.030
All right,
cool.
You want to watch the playoff hockey?

628
00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:35.540
The black cops are playing tonight?
No.

629
00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:40.810
And also I take a shower and try to feel human.
Okay,
cool.

630
00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.680
All right,
well that's it.
All right.
That's the podcast for this Thursday.

Could you get out of the room please so you can for your tag so I can deliver my

641
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.980
tagline.
All right.

642
00:41:27.981 --> 00:41:32.890
Did they go the two beautiful ladies have a great weekend.
Get cuts.

643
00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.110
[inaudible]

644
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:37.200
<v 2>it's bill burr Monday morning podcast for a Wednesday,</v>

645
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:42.680
April 15th.
That's when I'm recording this anyways.

646
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.830
And a buddy of mine tomorrow is going to help me upload this fucking thing onto

647
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:51.620
my computer and then onto the g cast thing and hopefully they did it and if they

648
00:42:51.621 --> 00:42:55.910
did,
you're actually listening to it,
you know?
And uh,

649
00:42:55.911 --> 00:42:59.030
this is my new recording device.
How does it sound?
Huh?
You like this?

650
00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:03.470
You'll like it to sound good.
It's stereo.
Motherfuckers.
Finally,

651
00:43:03.471 --> 00:43:08.471
after years of you people bitching at me about the sound of my cell phone and

652
00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:14.420
you know,
the tapping of my computer and all that type of shit,

653
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:19.400
I am 90% there to have an,
a really great sounding podcast.

654
00:43:19.401 --> 00:43:23.690
I'm going all out.
You know,
I'm getting a microphone.

655
00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.900
This thing has the ability that you can actually stick a cord in there,

656
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:31.750
have a microphone,
and be able to walk around like Mike Douglas when I do these.

657
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:36.230
And,
uh,
I think it's just going to help the quality all the way around.

658
00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:39.710
I hope it sounds good.
I hope that,
uh,
you know,

659
00:43:39.711 --> 00:43:42.890
I listened back to a couple of these.
You can literally hear the echo in my room,

660
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:48.020
um,
because that's the way I live my life.
30 sparsely,

661
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.730
very sparsely furnished apartment,
you know,

662
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:57.770
I,
uh,
yeah,
that's how I live my life.
I throw shit out all the fucking time.

663
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:02.390
You know,
you ever see like these people,
uh,
by the time they're 60 years old,

664
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.393
you know,

665
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.610
they're fucking sleeping on their roof because every time they went to a

666
00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:11.180
baseball game and it was headband day,
they,
they,

667
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:16.400
they just took it.
You know,
you don't have to take that shit.
I always just say,

668
00:44:16.401 --> 00:44:19.400
I don't want it.
And they look at me like,
what do you mean you don't want?

669
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.220
And I'm like,
I don't like clutter.
You know,

670
00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:27.650
I don't need a fucking Baltimore Ravens Tal to wave in the fucking air.

671
00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:32.010
I don't,
you know,
maybe I'll take it and don't jerk off and the eight later.
Wow.

672
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.100
Bill.
Why,
why?
You know,

673
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:39.120
it was so family friendly right up until that moment.
No,

674
00:44:39.121 --> 00:44:43.140
I'm just saying I don't have a,
I don't have a lot of stuff,
you know,

675
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:46.950
but the stuff I have is quality and it means something to me.

676
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:50.490
I've noticed something about myself.
Anytime I say anything kind of sensitive,

677
00:44:50.491 --> 00:44:54.960
I have to say it in a gay accent to mask the fact that I feel uncomfortable

678
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:59.370
opening up,
you know?
So anyway,
so let's get on with this.

679
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:00.870
This is the Monday morning podcast.

680
00:45:00.871 --> 00:45:05.100
I do one of these every single week unless there's a little sort of glitch with

681
00:45:05.101 --> 00:45:07.500
my host,
which is the first time it's ever happened.

682
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:12.360
So just bear with me and just go with this.
I do one of these every week,

683
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:16.620
I think.
I think I've earned the right to say that.
All right,
Andy.

684
00:45:16.621 --> 00:45:21.480
I answer people's questions.
People send me their list of overrated,
underrated.

685
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:26.130
They asked me for advice for some God knows reason and uh,

686
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.520
lately people who send sending me stories about revenge.

687
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.630
But here's a new topic that I guess this guy was trying to say.

688
00:45:33.631 --> 00:45:37.980
I introduced and I kind of dropped the ball on it,
but um,

689
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:43.410
I dunno,
this is pretty good.
He's talking about songs that annoy him,

690
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:47.700
which are basically any top 40 songs.

691
00:45:47.701 --> 00:45:52.060
His songs you hear all the time and uh,
or maybe like,

692
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:55.590
I think the topic he was talking about was annoying things in sports and I

693
00:45:55.591 --> 00:46:00.591
brought up how at the red sox home games they play sweet Caroline.

694
00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.510
I believe during the seventh inning stretch.

695
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:07.830
That's how much I hate that song is,

696
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.220
I'm a huge red sox fan and I don't even know when they play it.

697
00:46:11.221 --> 00:46:15.360
I believe that's when they do it.
I always just,
I just turned the channel.

698
00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:19.320
I can't,
I can't handle it.
And you know,

699
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.490
I know him from there and I don't,
it shouldn't be trashed and red sox fans,

700
00:46:23.491 --> 00:46:24.390
but I don't give a shit.

701
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:28.590
But if you go to Fenway park and you start singing along to that song with your

702
00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:33.390
arm around your girlfriend and y'all look up in the air and you go,
bub,
bub,
bub,

703
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:37.110
you're a fucking embarrassment.

704
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.710
You a fucking embarrassment stopped doing that.

705
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:45.420
Isn't it bad enough that we have a mascot now for the Red Sox?

706
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:48.630
You know what I mean?
Maybe it's cause I don't have any fucking kids,

707
00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:52.890
but you know,
can we be men,
you know?
Is that like against the rules?

708
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:56.430
Now do you know a long time ago,
I might have talked about this before,

709
00:46:56.431 --> 00:47:00.210
but a long time ago,
back in the day,

710
00:47:00.211 --> 00:47:03.840
I want to say it was in the 70s this is why the Internet's great because you can

711
00:47:03.841 --> 00:47:07.410
look this up.
I swear to God,
they tried to have a mascot.

712
00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:13.320
Okay.
It was called the Fenway freak.
I swear to God.
This is true.

713
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.390
And the thing lasted about three days,

714
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:19.140
three days in one trip out into the bleachers.

715
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:24.090
And I dunno who that poor bastard was that was inside that fucking suit.
But,

716
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:28.690
uh,
he got pelted mercilessly with any,
now that's back in the day when,

717
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:33.370
when it was bad day,
you actually got a bat,
you've got a full size fucking bat.

718
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:38.850
They wiped out a whole acre of rainforest for every fucking row of people.

719
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:41.680
And this guy got the shit kicked out.
He ain't got no,
he got beat up.
But he,

720
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:45.850
you know,
it was definitely expressed that we don't need a fucking mascot.

721
00:47:45.851 --> 00:47:50.320
You know,
and this is back in the day too,
when a foul ball came into the stands,

722
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:51.640
you didn't give it to a kid.

723
00:47:51.641 --> 00:47:56.350
You stepped on a kid to give yourself another foot of height so you could steal

724
00:47:56.351 --> 00:48:00.310
it from some other fucking guy.
That's how it worked,
you know?
But now,
you know,

725
00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:03.370
we got to give it to a kid.

726
00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.530
Fuck the kid.

727
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:07.310
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

728
00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:10.970
<v 2>give it to a kid.
He did.
He pay for his ticket.
Is He paid for parking?</v>

729
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:15.410
Hasn't he gotten enough?
You don't even realize how lucky you are.
I was a kid.

730
00:48:15.411 --> 00:48:17.240
You ever think about that shit when you were like,

731
00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:20.870
tell me about when you were like six years old.
You just had no money.

732
00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:26.320
You went outside to play with no ID,
no money,

733
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.760
no keys to the house,

734
00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:32.340
just empty pockets and you just fucking went outside and somehow it,

735
00:48:32.341 --> 00:48:35.890
you know,
it all worked out.
Try doing that as an adult.

736
00:48:35.891 --> 00:48:40.360
Walk out of Your House without your keys,
identity or any sort of fucking money.

737
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:45.640
And I challenge you to walk around the block away from where you live without

738
00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:49.210
collapsing in a full panic attack.
These fucking kids,

739
00:48:49.211 --> 00:48:52.180
they don't know how good they got it and they're going to get a foul ball on top

740
00:48:52.181 --> 00:48:56.410
of it.
Fuck you.
God Damn it.
I hate that.

741
00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.510
I Dunno.
I Dunno if I hate kids or I hate their parents.
I don't know what it is.

742
00:49:01.511 --> 00:49:05.620
I like kids.
You know what I like?
I like a,
I saw a kid the other day,

743
00:49:05.621 --> 00:49:07.720
this toddler,
you know what's funny about toddlers,

744
00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.230
you know when they're like two years old is you know,

745
00:49:11.231 --> 00:49:13.450
parents always have him like running around shirtless.

746
00:49:13.451 --> 00:49:17.140
They always have like that little beer belly.
It's the funniest fucking,

747
00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:22.200
I cannot not laugh when I see that shift because what I love is this.

748
00:49:22.211 --> 00:49:26.500
So like not even self conscious,
anybody.
I was a gut,
we sucks it in.

749
00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:30.130
But when you're two years old,
you know,
give a fuck,
just walk,

750
00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:35.200
they look like little truck drivers.
I just think this shit's hilarious.

751
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:38.230
So anyways,
what am I talking about?
So a,

752
00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:42.950
so this dude was basically talking about,
uh,
just talk about,
you know,

753
00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:47.410
the new topic.
Maybe it's things that annoy you in sports.

754
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.750
And for me,
I mean I picked on my own team,
um,

755
00:49:52.751 --> 00:49:55.630
and I also,
I think I mentioned,

756
00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:00.720
I can't tell if this guy was bringing it up or if I had mentioned it before,

757
00:50:01.421 --> 00:50:06.160
but I'll give him credit and agree with him is when they have that old cop come

758
00:50:06.161 --> 00:50:09.880
in and he sings,
God bless America in Yankee Stadium.

759
00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:14.440
Like I've never wanted to throw a toaster through a flat screen more.

760
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.770
When he gets up there and he does that whole long beginning,

761
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.950
there's all blah blah,

762
00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:26.270
then just fucking goes on for like 19 minutes.
It's uh,

763
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:30.430
it's just the worst.
Yeah,
I dunno.

764
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:32.170
I hate that whole thing.

765
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:36.650
I will say hate how the Yankees play New York,
New York,

766
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:41.240
whether they win or lose,
it just seems bizarre to me.

767
00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:46.241
And it was really funny the night when the red sox finally beat them and hung

768
00:50:46.371 --> 00:50:50.390
the biggest show.
Can Professional sports history around their fucking necks.

769
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.160
And the second is over,

770
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:56.630
the red sox had jumping all over the field and that playing that fucking song

771
00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:01.670
that,
that at a stat spread ooze.

772
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:06.350
Is everybody teary eyed?
I don't,
maybe it's a tradition.

773
00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:07.640
I have no idea.

774
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.000
But I'm speaking of which ESPN recently did a top 25 chokes of all time and the

775
00:51:15.261 --> 00:51:18.650
Yankees of 2004 we're nowhere on the list.

776
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:22.340
They had like Greg Norman.
I was really surprised by that.

777
00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:26.450
But I guess it's because,
you know,
when you dominate an entire century,

778
00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:31.220
you know,
eventually you're going to have a bad year.
So I kind of understood it.

779
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:33.800
And of course the red sox made the list.

780
00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:41.960
I think we were a number seven through 18.
I think we were the top,

781
00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:47.240
we have the top 11 fucking jokes of all time.
Uh,

782
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:52.400
but anyway,
speaking of that,
did anybody watch the masters?
I actually,

783
00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:56.120
uh,
played nine holes of golf,
a par three.

784
00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.810
And I've never given a shit about golf.
I never kept score.

785
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:05.060
I used to sneak into a private golf course when I was a kid with my buddy during

786
00:52:05.061 --> 00:52:06.160
the wintertime,
you know,

787
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:11.090
when it was no snow on the ground and we would play golf,
but it was more like a,

788
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.800
it was more like Polo,
you know,
it wasn't a stroke thing.

789
00:52:15.801 --> 00:52:18.710
It was more like a who could get the ball in the hole first.

790
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:21.320
So there was a lot of,
uh,
you know,

791
00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:26.000
standing in front of somebody off to the side as they were shooting and you were

792
00:52:26.001 --> 00:52:30.740
shooting two and he fucking slices it and the hitching your back,
uh,
you know,

793
00:52:30.741 --> 00:52:31.430
that kind of shit.

794
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:33.920
And then you play like five holes and then you don't give a fuck.

795
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:38.090
And then you just start trying to drive golf balls at the building next to the

796
00:52:38.091 --> 00:52:42.510
golf course.
We played golf like that.
So anyways,
long story short,
uh,

797
00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:46.850
I actually had a good time when this par three course and I actually part one of

798
00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:49.730
the holes and I started to be like,
man,

799
00:52:49.731 --> 00:52:53.870
I think I may want to play this fucking game.
So I got fucking,

800
00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:56.480
I'll watch the master's,
I'll see what's going on.
You know,

801
00:52:56.481 --> 00:53:01.370
I bet a little money with my good friend Keith Robinson who a,
he's part of my,

802
00:53:01.371 --> 00:53:05.890
my,
uh,
I think he made the first row of my top 9,000 friends.
And uh,
he's,

803
00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:08.840
he's a man of African descent,
so,
you know,

804
00:53:08.841 --> 00:53:12.010
I'm sick of them talking about tiger woods and how fucking great he is and all

805
00:53:12.011 --> 00:53:15.350
his shit.
So I call up Keith and I tell him that,
you know what,

806
00:53:15.351 --> 00:53:17.180
I'm willing to bet against tiger.

807
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:22.480
I'm wanting to put my money on a fucking white man to a beat d a tiger woods,

808
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:27.080
you know,
so he goes,
I'll take it about 20 bucks a text,

809
00:53:27.081 --> 00:53:31.090
Phil Mickelson and I beat that motherfucker by one stroke.
So anyway,

810
00:53:31.091 --> 00:53:36.091
so I get totally into this master's and I'm watching the end of it thinking it's

811
00:53:36.871 --> 00:53:38.850
going to be this very cool thing.

812
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:43.410
It was most unsatisfying winning of a championship I've ever experienced as a

813
00:53:43.411 --> 00:53:48.360
fan because the Guy Kenny Perry,
48 years old,

814
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:52.140
he had the fucking thing one.
Okay,

815
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:56.520
he birdies 16 he's up by two strokes with two holes to go.

816
00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:01.850
He bogeys his 17th bogeys the 18th and then loses the two round playoff.

817
00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:04.403
It was,

818
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:09.690
it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen and it's like what I really

819
00:54:09.691 --> 00:54:13.830
realize is golf is the worst sport to choke him because you choke in anything

820
00:54:13.831 --> 00:54:16.410
else.
Let's take the red sox.
The ball goes,
who bucked his leg?

821
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:20.430
How long did that take?
How long did that take?
Like what?

822
00:54:20.431 --> 00:54:25.290
Like fucking two and a half seconds.
Dude.
This guy,
Kenny Perry,

823
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.510
choked for like 90 minutes,

824
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:32.430
an hour and a half on national television,
slicing it,
hooking it,

825
00:54:32.431 --> 00:54:36.300
going into the trap in front of his whole fucking family and the show in his

826
00:54:36.301 --> 00:54:37.980
family that Diana's slow death.

827
00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:41.970
His fucking wife couldn't even look at him at the end of it.
It was just,

828
00:54:41.971 --> 00:54:44.820
it was who's fucking horrible.

829
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:47.640
I actually woke up the next day thinking about going,
God,

830
00:54:47.641 --> 00:54:50.070
if he just chose a different club.

831
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:53.750
I don't know if you're a Kenny Perry fan or you know,
I,

832
00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:55.080
I feel real bad for that guy.

833
00:54:55.081 --> 00:54:57.210
It was one of the worst fucking things I've ever seen in my life,

834
00:54:57.211 --> 00:55:01.470
so I don't think I'm ever going to watch golf again.
I'm done with it.

835
00:55:01.471 --> 00:55:06.471
Although I might start playing it and thus complete the circle of being a a,

836
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:11.280
a white man,
you know?
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?

837
00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:15.210
Cross my legs with penny loafers and start pontificating like I know how shit

838
00:55:15.211 --> 00:55:20.070
works as I wait to tee off,
isn't the one I'm supposed to be doing.
You know,

839
00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:24.960
certainly by the time I'm 50 dress like I'm in the,

840
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:26.700
in a three stooges sketch.

841
00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:30.090
I love how they always do address like in there in the 1920s and they were one

842
00:55:30.091 --> 00:55:34.740
of those black panther berets,
but it has a pump palm on it.
All right?

843
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.260
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Let's get back to this kid's list.

844
00:55:37.261 --> 00:55:42.240
This kid made a list of his top eight,
which I love.
Who if people do a top five,

845
00:55:42.241 --> 00:55:46.800
top three,
top 10,
who does a top eight?
I'll tell you who this motherfucker,

846
00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:52.230
he's doing his top eight songs that just,

847
00:55:52.231 --> 00:55:56.400
he never needs to hear again.
He basically said if I were all powerful,

848
00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:59.010
I would begin by outlawing these things,

849
00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:02.640
which I think is a great new topic to another new topic.
Okay?

850
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.220
Not only do you got the things that annoy you in sports,

851
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.280
how about what if you were a dictator and you could make laws?

852
00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:13.350
What would you outlaw?
And this,
he's,
this kid is just going with music.
All right?

853
00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:18.330
Number eight.
He said,
sweet Caroline,
as I just went off on,

854
00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:23.370
um,
number seven hotel,
California.

855
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:26.950
He goes,
I don't give a shit where you living it up?

856
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.990
You overrated Pansy.
He's got a lot of anger towards all these artists,

857
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:33.490
hotel California.
Can we,

858
00:56:33.491 --> 00:56:36.730
can we admit that that song never needs to be played again?

859
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:42.460
Piano man,
horrific song,
horrific song.
He knew.

860
00:56:42.461 --> 00:56:46.480
What's the worst part of this song is I think it's in three four isn't it saying

861
00:56:46.481 --> 00:56:51.430
as is Rianna man.
One,
two,
three,
one,
two,
three,
one,
two,

862
00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:52.600
three,
one,
two,
three,

863
00:56:52.601 --> 00:56:56.500
one and everybody starts fucking rocking back and forth like the right October

864
00:56:56.501 --> 00:56:59.350
fest as that's the fuck.
You know,

865
00:56:59.351 --> 00:57:02.500
it's a great moment in a bar and I swear to God,

866
00:57:02.501 --> 00:57:04.030
it's right out of a Benny Hill sketch.

867
00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:07.840
You ever see somebody with a beer in their hand and they checked to see what

868
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:12.190
time it is and their watches on the same hand is,
it's never not funny.

869
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:16.510
I saw a guy we would drink and after an la kings game

870
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:20.020
and you don't like when you go to make a point like,

871
00:57:20.021 --> 00:57:22.750
you know what the fuck and he kind of throw your hands out to the side.

872
00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:26.320
He did that with a full beer in his hand and literally just through like,

873
00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:30.040
it looked like a lake of beer onto this,
this table where there was like,

874
00:57:30.041 --> 00:57:33.820
you know,
three women sitting at,
which made it even funnier.
You know what I mean?

875
00:57:33.821 --> 00:57:38.260
Cause they're all just like,
well,
I never,
um,
anyways,
anyways,
let's,

876
00:57:38.261 --> 00:57:42.400
let's continue weight number number five,
living on a prayer.

877
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:47.290
Absolutely.
I would say the entire Bon Jovi catalog other than,

878
00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:51.430
uh,
that wanted song,
that's a guilty pleasure.

879
00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:55.180
It's on my fucking iPod.
I'm not apologizing for it.

880
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:59.820
And I actually learned how to play the beginning on the guitar and,
uh,

881
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:00.850
and it made me happy.

882
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:08.500
I'm such a fucking loser.
All right,
number four,
sweet home Alabama.

883
00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:13.390
And that's still one that's on the fence.
It's such a good fucking song.
But yeah,

884
00:58:13.391 --> 00:58:17.130
they've really played the hell out of it.
And I love how,
uh,

885
00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:20.290
I think somebody wrapped over that.
I think I talked about this before.

886
00:58:20.291 --> 00:58:24.640
Some rapper rap to that sample and it's spending a couple of movies that I

887
00:58:24.641 --> 00:58:27.940
noticed black people kind of start bobbing their heads when that song comes on.

888
00:58:27.941 --> 00:58:29.440
And uh,
if you're black,

889
00:58:29.441 --> 00:58:32.290
you should really look up the lyrics to that song and I don't think he'd be

890
00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:35.670
bobbing your head.
You probably be shaking it.
Um,

891
00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:43.870
all right,
number three.
Mustang Sally.
Yeah,

892
00:58:43.871 --> 00:58:47.200
that song's for like cougars chicks to start fucking shaking.

893
00:58:47.201 --> 00:58:49.450
They're dusty muffs too.
You know,

894
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:54.280
it's a grind up on some fucking 20 year old kid who really wants to bang you

895
00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:57.940
because he's got some sort of weird issue with older women because his mother

896
00:58:57.941 --> 00:59:01.810
didn't stick around that home.
Cougar seen is just the creepiest,

897
00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:06.820
it's every bit is creepy as the 50 year old guy date and that the fucking 18

898
00:59:06.881 --> 00:59:11.200
year old chick,
that whole daddy thing going on,
it's just,

899
00:59:11.201 --> 00:59:15.100
it's really a,
it's creepy,
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

900
00:59:15.101 --> 00:59:17.950
If I was 50 and single and I could,
ah,
how low would you go?

901
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.030
Do you ever think about that?

902
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:24.140
Like right now I'm 40 can be 41 in June.
Uh,

903
00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:29.050
25,
25 is my cutoff.
Uh,
maybe 24.

904
00:59:29.051 --> 00:59:33.490
She listened to jazz.
She seemed mature.

905
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:36.310
Um,
yeah.

906
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:40.960
All I know is you can't be in college.
I remember one time when I was 35,

907
00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:46.020
I hooked up with a 21 year olds and in the process of air quotes here seducing

908
00:59:46.691 --> 00:59:50.440
her,
I actually said,
so what's your major?
And I almost,

909
00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:52.270
I almost pulled the plug right there.

910
00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:56.560
But fortunately my dick was running things at that point and I was able to see

911
00:59:56.561 --> 01:00:00.700
the mission through.
All right.
Number two,
uh,
brown eyed girl.

912
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:05.820
I don't mind that song.
Fam Morrison.
You know,
maybe it's,

913
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:10.280
is that Van Morrison,
you know Brown,
I girl,

914
01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.730
do you remember when?
Oh yeah.
You know,

915
01:00:13.731 --> 01:00:16.550
that's one of those songs that everyone sings in a bar and it just makes you

916
01:00:16.551 --> 01:00:18.380
hate humanity.
I'll give you that one.

917
01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.310
And his number one song is a American pie.

918
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:28.100
Oh yeah,
that's a,
that's a song that's like really dramatic for no reason.

919
01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:31.460
Even though I know that they're singing about,
uh,

920
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:36.320
the big bopper and Ritchie valance and a buddy Holly all dying.

921
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.770
This wasn't the guy to do the song.
Now,

922
01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.630
just it just really slow and you know,
Madonna did a cover of that song.

923
01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.680
Talk about,
you know,

924
01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:47.180
<v 0>okay,</v>

925
01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:51.680
<v 2>two horrific worlds colliding.
I'll tell you this,
if I,
if I could,</v>

926
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:57.840
if I could pick my top,
I'll just give you my top three.
Um,

927
01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.700
number three is the entire beyond say catalog.

928
01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:07.500
And that includes all of her work with destiny child,
Destiny's child.

929
01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:12.120
I think she's a beautiful woman.
She's a great dancer,
but she cannot sing.

930
01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:17.400
I think she's singing too high and then,
and then it's just,
Ugh,
those fucking,

931
01:01:17.401 --> 01:01:21.420
I haven't heard hooks like that since the last time j lo had a fucking album
out.

932
01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:22.481
I mean,

933
01:01:22.481 --> 01:01:25.530
that song she had out and they just kept playing that saxophone over and over

934
01:01:25.531 --> 01:01:26.364
again.

935
01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:30.420
<v 3>Did it,
did,
it did.
I did.
It did.
It did.</v>

936
01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:34.530
<v 2>And you just wanted to fucking smash a glass into the person next to you.</v>

937
01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.570
Like they like punish you with the music.
That's what,
like Beyonce songs,

938
01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:42.570
they're like,
I don't get it.
Like Beyonce.

939
01:01:42.571 --> 01:01:47.571
Sing as high as you can and then sing the same thing over and over and over and

940
01:01:48.961 --> 01:01:50.490
over and over again.

941
01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:56.090
<v 3>Maybe like in a minute,
20 minutes later,</v>

942
01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:01.840
<v 2>all her beauty goes down the fucking drain.
The second she starts singing Jesus,</v>

943
01:02:01.841 --> 01:02:04.540
I'm in a mood.
So all her entire catalog.

944
01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:07.403
<v 3>MMM.</v>

945
01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:12.390
<v 2>Anything by kiss.
And I'm going to pause here to let everybody be like,
oh,</v>

946
01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:16.860
she's crying.
Tears.
Come on man.
Just go Detroit rock city.

947
01:02:17.410 --> 01:02:21.070
It all sucks.
It's horrific.
You could take fucking Bob Seger with them.

948
01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:26.030
There's a lot of bad white music coming out of Detroit.
I'm telling you.

949
01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.493
Um,

950
01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:32.740
and the number one would be thin Lizzy.

951
01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:37.930
The boys are back in town and uh,
they should be like a contest.

952
01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:42.340
Like to just see how long you can listen to that song.

953
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:45.670
It's like they just singing about these fucking,

954
01:02:45.671 --> 01:02:50.350
this group of Douche bags that just like thinks they're bad asses.
I guess.

955
01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:54.760
You know,
I haven't,
I talked about this before.
I can't even fucking remember.

956
01:02:54.761 --> 01:02:58.120
I've done some of these podcasts.
They got it.

957
01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.520
The boys are back in town and they get that holds the ball.

958
01:03:00.521 --> 01:03:05.080
If the boys want to fight,
you better let them really harassed.
What

959
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:07.283
<v 0>you know,</v>

960
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:12.210
<v 2>man,
man,
that chick slap Giani in the face.
Man,</v>

961
01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:15.120
we fell about the place.
You know,

962
01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:17.400
like everyone's just sitting around this town.

963
01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:21.840
Wait for these fucking Douche bags to show back up.
You know,

964
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:25.950
come back into town.
You know,
all fuck the boys are back in town.

965
01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.260
Hide the women.

966
01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:32.940
These fucking nerds are back in town and if they want to fight you better let

967
01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:34.013
them

968
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:39.930
whoever wrote that song should seriously consider killing themselves,
you know?

969
01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:41.960
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

970
01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:45.080
<v 2>it's right up there with Woodrow Wilson Pushing through the Federal Reserve Act.</v>

971
01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:49.580
That's number one.
And number two is whoever wrote the boys are back in town.

972
01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:53.570
That's how I see that shit.
All right,
so let's move on here.

973
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:57.160
Let's get on with the podcast.
Uh,

974
01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:59.960
what do we got here and what do we got here?
All right,

975
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:05.140
this here is not really a revenge story.
This is actually a,

976
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:06.650
dare I say,
kind of clever.

977
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:11.360
What this guy did to fuck somebody over he a,
this is what he did.
He took,

978
01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.030
I don't know,
a lot of this computer stuff,

979
01:04:14.031 --> 01:04:16.730
so I'm going to try to read this slowly and God knows,

980
01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:19.100
we all know I suck at reading out loud at this point.

981
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:20.630
<v 0>Okay.</v>

982
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:23.390
<v 2>All right.
He says,
uh,
I took us,</v>

983
01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:28.840
basically what I did was I took a screen capture of my friends desktop when he

984
01:04:29.691 --> 01:04:31.540
left his computer on attended,

985
01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.190
which basically means he took a picture of it,
of the guys desktop.

986
01:04:36.191 --> 01:04:39.160
I guess he didn't have anything on the screen.
He just took a picture of it.

987
01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:40.391
He goes,

988
01:04:40.391 --> 01:04:45.391
I then hid all his desktop icons and set the background as this screen capture I

989
01:04:47.531 --> 01:04:51.270
just took.
So basically it looks like all his,

990
01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:54.460
all the folders and icons are still there,
but they're not.

991
01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:56.440
So when the dude comes back,

992
01:04:56.441 --> 01:05:00.580
you'll be clicking till his fucking mouth starts smoking and nothing will
happen.

993
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:04.390
Man.
Come on man.
You got to give this guy an a for effort.
That's just pretty,
uh,

994
01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:07.720
I think that's kind of ingenious.
So anyways,
I guess this is how it plays out.

995
01:05:07.721 --> 01:05:10.660
He goes,
I waited for the guy to return to see his reaction.
He goes,

996
01:05:10.661 --> 01:05:14.380
I stood off in the distance,
like a fucking stalker.
He goes,

997
01:05:14.381 --> 01:05:18.930
at first I could see the confused look on his face,

998
01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.220
but it very quickly turned to frustration and then anger.

999
01:05:23.221 --> 01:05:26.850
He began mumbling shit like this fucking piece of shit.

1000
01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:30.330
And it escalated to him pretty much yelling and saying,

1001
01:05:30.331 --> 01:05:34.350
I'm going to smash this motherfucker.
He goes,
I couldn't believe it.

1002
01:05:34.351 --> 01:05:36.960
He was pounding the keyboard and slamming the mouse.

1003
01:05:36.961 --> 01:05:39.870
I was laughing so hard that snap was coming out of my nose.

1004
01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.620
So the dude concluded that he had a virus.

1005
01:05:43.621 --> 01:05:46.170
So he took the computer to the it department.

1006
01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.710
They figured it out in five minutes and told them he's an asshole.

1007
01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:55.170
What do you think?
Did I do good or am I the Douche bag or the week?
Nah,
dude,

1008
01:05:55.171 --> 01:05:57.990
you did great.
That's fucking hilarious.

1009
01:05:58.690 --> 01:05:59.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1010
01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:01.620
<v 2>That's a great idea.
I wish I knew something about computers.</v>

1011
01:06:01.621 --> 01:06:04.290
I would try that on somebody.
I tried that on my girlfriend.

1012
01:06:04.291 --> 01:06:08.440
That's the kind of guy I go.
Um,
no,

1013
01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:11.610
you're not a Douche to that Sa.
I don't know if he came up with that,

1014
01:06:11.611 --> 01:06:13.500
but that's pretty,
uh,
that's pretty ingenious.

1015
01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:16.890
So I give you a thumbs up on that one.
And everybody at work,
go ahead.

1016
01:06:16.891 --> 01:06:18.830
Go try that on your boss.
No,

1017
01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:22.680
I don't do it to your boss because someone will end up renting the house and

1018
01:06:22.681 --> 01:06:24.270
eventually,
even if they didn't rat you out,

1019
01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:27.570
they could figure out that you were the one who did it because you would be

1020
01:06:27.571 --> 01:06:31.050
doing that.
You know that laugh and you didn't in school when you were a kid,

1021
01:06:31.051 --> 01:06:33.780
you weren't allowed to laugh and you would hold your nose.

1022
01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:36.210
So He'd start making those duck noises.

1023
01:06:36.690 --> 01:06:39.550
That usually gives away that you're the one who fucking did it.
All right,

1024
01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:45.090
let's get on with revenge stories.
Um,
before I get on with the revenge stories,

1025
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.450
uh,

1026
01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:50.450
some woman was letting me know why females are better at revenge than guys.

1027
01:06:50.730 --> 01:06:54.000
And she wrote a pretty interesting thing here.
Uh,
she says,

1028
01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:57.180
cause I guess I was asking all my podcast a couple of weeks ago,

1029
01:06:57.181 --> 01:07:00.750
how come his revenge only a guy thing.
How come I'm not hearing from women?

1030
01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.980
And believe me,
if you hear the stories this week,
uh,

1031
01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.210
I really opened the flood gates because the women,
the ladies,

1032
01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:10.860
they came in strong this week.

1033
01:07:10.861 --> 01:07:15.480
So before I read all the women revenge stories here,
uh,

1034
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:18.960
this woman,
his,
there's a little preamble setup she gives me,
she goes,
Bill,

1035
01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.660
you've only read one revenge story from a female.

1036
01:07:21.661 --> 01:07:26.310
And I'll tell you why guys are idiotic and deal with anger.
So stupidly

1037
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:29.940
is stupidly a word.

1038
01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:31.310
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1039
01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:34.730
<v 2>isn't it?
Guys are idiotic and they deal with their anger in a stupid way.</v>

1040
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.320
<v 0>Okay?</v>

1041
01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.850
<v 2>I Dunno,
I'm too fucking stupid to know.</v>

1042
01:07:37.851 --> 01:07:41.240
But that would be hilarious if stupidly is not a word,
you know,

1043
01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:44.930
because you just made yourself look like an ass.
And if you didn't,
I apologize.

1044
01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.650
Let me continue a fucking up.
Someone's car is pathetic.

1045
01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.330
This kind of revenge is temporary.

1046
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:54.310
Doing something like that would just make someone think of you as a cock sock

1047
01:07:54.311 --> 01:07:56.480
and jackass and then I'll move on with their lives.

1048
01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:01.820
Women can and will remember my new details and situations that guys will forget

1049
01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:05.930
when we want to know,
when we know how someone works,

1050
01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:10.130
we know how to use it against him.
Physical is temporary.

1051
01:08:10.131 --> 01:08:11.780
Psychological is permanent.

1052
01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:15.200
Women can do the most damage with the least effort.

1053
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:19.280
We don't aim to screw someone over or to do something to piss someone off.

1054
01:08:19.281 --> 01:08:20.750
We aim for resentment.

1055
01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:25.670
Resentment is much more powerful because it places you in a higher status and

1056
01:08:25.671 --> 01:08:26.930
when someone resents you,

1057
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:31.700
it's most likely that you have something that they don't and that you are just

1058
01:08:31.701 --> 01:08:33.020
better than them in some way.

1059
01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:36.320
So my point is that lashing out at someone is stupid.

1060
01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:40.700
It only makes you feel better and doesn't really have or accomplished much

1061
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:45.050
longtime effect on the other.
All right,
now I want to tell you something,

1062
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.441
you guys,

1063
01:08:45.441 --> 01:08:50.441
that paragraph right there is why I've never gotten married because I realize

1064
01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:56.390
that women have that.
You know they got that in them.

1065
01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:02.120
You know that expression?
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
That's the deal.

1066
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:04.790
It's this weird thing that when they're dating you and they want to know

1067
01:09:04.791 --> 01:09:05.870
everything about you,

1068
01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:11.350
it's this odd thing where half of it is so they can love the whole you and the

1069
01:09:11.961 --> 01:09:16.010
other half is like,
it's collateral in case the thing goes bad.

1070
01:09:16.011 --> 01:09:20.960
They have all this fucked up information that they can use against you.
So,
uh,

1071
01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.950
I don't know,
that was pretty chilling to read that.
And uh,

1072
01:09:24.951 --> 01:09:28.940
I don't agree with their definition of resentments saying that it,
it,
it,
uh,

1073
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:33.380
it means that you have something that they don't or that you are just better

1074
01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:35.300
than them in some way.
Uh,
I don't think,

1075
01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:38.600
I think they resent you because you fucked him over,
you know,

1076
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:42.350
not because you drive a better car.
Right.
I Dunno.

1077
01:09:42.351 --> 01:09:45.950
Why don't I shut the fuck up and read the first revenge story.
All right.
His,
no,

1078
01:09:45.951 --> 01:09:46.790
this is all from the,

1079
01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:50.090
this is all from women this week and I gotta tell you something.
They really,

1080
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:55.010
really take it to the next level and uh,
yeah.
All right,

1081
01:09:55.011 --> 01:09:57.800
let's just get on with this.
All right.
And on this one,

1082
01:09:57.801 --> 01:09:59.150
I'm not going to tell the street.

1083
01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:02.120
There's a couple of names and street names and here I don't wanna get anybody in

1084
01:10:02.121 --> 01:10:06.740
trouble.
So here we go.
Bill.
This story is actually not mine,
but,

1085
01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.530
um,
I was a participant.
Um,
you know what?

1086
01:10:09.531 --> 01:10:12.230
I'm going to say the names because I'm not going to try to fucking remember fake

1087
01:10:12.231 --> 01:10:14.780
names.
I'm just not going to say the name of the street.
All right.

1088
01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:17.780
Right after I graduated from college,
I moved to,
okay.

1089
01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:21.560
I can't say that my roommates were still college students is sometimes their

1090
01:10:21.561 --> 01:10:25.730
friends,
which were also my friends.
We all went to the same college,
stayed.
Uh,

1091
01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:30.620
they'd stay over.
One of our friends,
uh,
Jess,
who still lived in the dorm,

1092
01:10:30.621 --> 01:10:33.050
was having problems with a roommate.
Gale,

1093
01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:38.440
her roommate knew she had an eating disorder and was spreading rumors about her

1094
01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:41.330
writing things on our mirror.
Like,
you're fat.

1095
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:47.330
We let just stay at our apartment.
And we started plot,
started to plot revenge.

1096
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:52.280
One of the things we did was crank called gale.
So in case she got lost in that,

1097
01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:56.660
I guess Jess is the anorexic one and Gail is the cont.
All right.

1098
01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:01.090
Okay.
Let's continue on.
One of the things we did was crank call Gail.
We,

1099
01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:05.030
we use the voice from my roommates Mac computer and typed out some evil shit.

1100
01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:09.500
This definitely made just feel better and I guess inspired her to pull the

1101
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:10.850
ultimate revenge.

1102
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:16.310
Jess was a teen before she went to college.
This is the anorexic girl.

1103
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:21.550
While in college she worked at a high scale I high scale salon on something,

1104
01:11:22.101 --> 01:11:22.911
something street.

1105
01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:27.911
Shortly after we crank called Gail just ran into gales boyfriend after work.

1106
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.320
According to Jess,
she brought Gail's boyfriend back to her,
their dorm room,

1107
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:38.990
fuck him in Gail's bed and then called Gail right after to tell her all the

1108
01:11:39.951 --> 01:11:40.784
details.

1109
01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:46.280
Just ended up staying in our apartment the rest of the semester and bought us a

1110
01:11:46.281 --> 01:11:50.210
$200 bottle of champagne to celebrate the act of revenge.

1111
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:53.750
At the time,
I thought Gail got what she deserved,

1112
01:11:53.751 --> 01:11:58.640
but in hindsight it made me realize that women are evil.
Manipulative bitches.

1113
01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.990
Yes.
Many women hate being called fat,
but it ceases to amaze me,

1114
01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:07.070
but it never ceases to amaze me that women,
what women will do to others,

1115
01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:11.030
other women to get back at him.
Wow.

1116
01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:14.630
You know what I mean?
He'd take it to that level.

1117
01:12:15.970 --> 01:12:16.803
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1118
01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.890
<v 2>I dunno who deserves what in that story,</v>

1119
01:12:19.891 --> 01:12:23.460
but I think the real winner is a Gail's boyfriend.

1120
01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:29.850
You know,
you have a one that if you're a guy,

1121
01:12:29.851 --> 01:12:33.810
you ever wonder if any girl was fucking you outta revenge just to get somebody

1122
01:12:33.811 --> 01:12:36.870
back.
You know?
I don't think that's ever happened to me.

1123
01:12:36.871 --> 01:12:40.500
I don't live that exciting a life,
but I can't imagine.

1124
01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:42.550
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1125
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:47.360
<v 2>What is,
what do you say is the guys,
she sitting there banging you?
Yeah.</v>

1126
01:12:47.361 --> 01:12:50.330
That'll show her slip over and I'll bust it on your face.

1127
01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:54.780
You really taught her a lesson.
Hey,
anytime you want to teach,

1128
01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:59.240
teach her a lesson.
Again,
this is,
let me know.
I really,
I really,

1129
01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:02.290
I'm really down with you.
I understand your point here and I think a,

1130
01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.980
you're very justified.
You know,

1131
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:07.940
you don't really make really drive the point home is you let me,

1132
01:13:07.941 --> 01:13:09.980
if you let me bang you again,
you know,

1133
01:13:10.270 --> 01:13:13.370
and if you really want to get the ultimate,
ultimate revenge,

1134
01:13:13.371 --> 01:13:14.870
you'd let me put it in your ass.
You know,

1135
01:13:14.871 --> 01:13:18.830
I'm just throwing these ideas out there.
I mean,
this is,
this is your world.

1136
01:13:18.831 --> 01:13:22.310
You know,
I'm just,
I'm just here to help.
Okay?

1137
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:26.990
So that's revenge story number one.
Um,
and I can see,
you know,

1138
01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:27.561
in order it is,

1139
01:13:27.561 --> 01:13:31.840
it's not that she fucked the girl's boyfriend that she called him up,

1140
01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:35.840
called her up and told her about it.
You know,

1141
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:38.840
that's one of the advantages of women is for the most part,

1142
01:13:38.841 --> 01:13:42.290
they don't have to worry about the other woman coming over and just beating the

1143
01:13:42.291 --> 01:13:44.810
shit out of her.
Because as a guy,

1144
01:13:44.811 --> 01:13:48.020
if you ever tried to get back and another guy and you banged his girlfriend,

1145
01:13:48.021 --> 01:13:49.190
you'd never call the dude,

1146
01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:55.040
because I don't even care if you could beat the guy in a fight on a normal
basis.

1147
01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:59.630
You know what I'm saying?
The level of anger that he would have.
He,

1148
01:13:59.631 --> 01:14:03.500
I think he'd still win.
Right?
Does that make any sense?
All right.

1149
01:14:03.501 --> 01:14:05.570
Let me plow ahead that.
Jesus already up to 31 minutes.

1150
01:14:05.571 --> 01:14:09.260
Let me get through these here.
All right.
Hey Bill.
Here's my story of revenge.

1151
01:14:09.261 --> 01:14:11.920
Everybody knows that women hate each other,
hate other women.

1152
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:14.320
And I have a great story about women's revenge.

1153
01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:17.890
I was roommates with two other women in college.

1154
01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:22.690
One was very average looking and one was very beautiful.

1155
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:26.440
The type of beautiful that makes all the other girls around her hater.

1156
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:31.360
Um,
she got whatever she wanted throughout her life because of,
because of it.

1157
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:34.510
Guys,
money,
grades,
you name it.
And she was a bitch.

1158
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:39.040
She used everyone around her and was never said no to.
Um,

1159
01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:41.920
so I was casually dating a guy and brought him back to my house.

1160
01:14:41.921 --> 01:14:43.030
And both my roommates were there.

1161
01:14:43.031 --> 01:14:45.400
We hung out with them for awhile and everything was cool.

1162
01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:48.010
I didn't notice anything unusual.
A few weeks later,

1163
01:14:48.011 --> 01:14:50.080
I hear from a mutual friend that my roommate,

1164
01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:54.160
I guess the hot one was out with my guy after.

1165
01:14:54.161 --> 01:14:56.350
Seriously interrogating my guy.

1166
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:59.320
He finally spills his guts and tells me the truth.

1167
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:03.470
I would have loved to have seen that guys have the worst liars ever know what

1168
01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.550
was what was doing

1169
01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:12.280
fucking 12 seconds later.
All right.
All right.
You got me.
I was fucking her.

1170
01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.930
Anyways,
he goes,
uh,
she had,
uh,
the hot girl had bumped into the,

1171
01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:18.490
her boyfriend on campus one day,

1172
01:15:18.491 --> 01:15:22.360
and I guess they headed off and started seeing each other by my back.

1173
01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:28.390
Um,
naturally I dump his ass,
but I'm so much more pissed at her.

1174
01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:33.190
I kinda read that weird.
So it's her boyfriend.
Um,
okay.
So anyways,
uh,

1175
01:15:33.191 --> 01:15:37.180
I come up with a brilliant plan to get my revenge on her and enlisted my other

1176
01:15:37.181 --> 01:15:38.320
roommates for help.

1177
01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:42.700
She agrees because all average girls secretly hate pretty girls.

1178
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:46.490
This is really eye opening about the,
uh,

1179
01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:52.030
the psycho inner worlds of women.
This is like an HBO undercover.

1180
01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.920
So anyways,
here's that revenge.
Uh,
we had an,
an advantage because the hot girl,

1181
01:15:56.921 --> 01:16:01.000
she drank a lot and we get ripped almost every other night and I mean really,

1182
01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:03.570
really ripped.
We'd wait until she gets,
uh,

1183
01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:07.630
so one night we waited until she got loaded one night and it was the most wasted

1184
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:12.370
I've ever seen her.
It was like all the stars were aligned for our plan.

1185
01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:17.770
She had beautiful long corn.
Silkair uh oh,
here we go.

1186
01:16:18.190 --> 01:16:21.940
Here we go.
She had beautiful long corn.

1187
01:16:21.941 --> 01:16:25.240
Silkair care was straight off the ass of a golden retriever.

1188
01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:30.370
I bought two boxes of black hair dye and after she passes out,

1189
01:16:30.371 --> 01:16:33.640
we started.
I really wanted to make a statement,

1190
01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:38.110
so I partner hair down the middle and only die half of her head,

1191
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:42.250
Jesus Christ.
After I start,

1192
01:16:42.251 --> 01:16:46.570
I turned into this crazy die hungry freak.
I couldn't stop myself.

1193
01:16:46.571 --> 01:16:50.200
I started dying any part of her body that could,
that I could find.

1194
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:53.770
I did our eyebrows,
the peach fuzz on her chin and lip,

1195
01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:55.540
her fingers and our arms.

1196
01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:01.740
I'm embarrassed to say that we even died a lightning bolt in her pubic hair.

1197
01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:07.030
The funny part was that she kept waking up telling us to leave her alone,

1198
01:17:07.450 --> 01:17:11.130
but we kept going,
Jesus,
this,

1199
01:17:11.131 --> 01:17:14.550
this sounds like a fucking date rape story.
It's just that as women.

1200
01:17:14.551 --> 01:17:18.210
So I guess is,
it's still funny.
Anybody else getting creeped out here?

1201
01:17:18.930 --> 01:17:22.650
Um,
let's continue here.
Of course,
we were too lazy to wash it out,

1202
01:17:22.651 --> 01:17:27.651
so if we just go to sleep and leave the black hair dye on our roommate for about

1203
01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:32.670
seven hours,
I wake up the next day to her and a towel towel.

1204
01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:36.330
Her hair was soaking wet and she was beating the shit out of me with a shampoo

1205
01:17:36.331 --> 01:17:38.670
bottle.
It was fucking hysterical.

1206
01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:41.940
The dye had stained or skin along with their hair,

1207
01:17:41.941 --> 01:17:45.270
so she had dark brown patches all over her face and body.

1208
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:50.510
She looked like the bastard child of Cruella Deville and Richard Grieco.

1209
01:17:51.090 --> 01:17:53.820
I don't know who that is.
I was so proud of my work.

1210
01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:56.610
You would think that I got my revenge,

1211
01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.670
but this is a story about her revenge on me.

1212
01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:03.480
This is a fucking long one here.
Plot twist.

1213
01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:07.150
She actually called the cops and they fucking came and arrested my roommate and

1214
01:18:07.151 --> 01:18:07.710
me.

1215
01:18:07.710 --> 01:18:11.460
The evidence was stacked against us because our hands and arms were also stained

1216
01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.600
with black hair.

1217
01:18:12.601 --> 01:18:16.620
Dye her bed where the crime was committed was covered in black dye.

1218
01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:19.140
It looked like an octopus had been raped in there.

1219
01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:25.890
She tried to charge us with sexual assault,
a pubic hair,

1220
01:18:25.891 --> 01:18:28.810
lightening bolt.
Yeah.
You know,
you pull somebody's pants down,

1221
01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:32.340
start dying their genitals,
or at least the area.
Yeah,

1222
01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:33.900
you're gonna get in trouble.
So anyways,

1223
01:18:33.901 --> 01:18:35.550
after spending all day in the police station,

1224
01:18:35.551 --> 01:18:38.100
we were finally let out and the charges were dropped.

1225
01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:40.440
But when we got back to the house,

1226
01:18:40.441 --> 01:18:44.970
we were greeted by campus security and our parents were there too.

1227
01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:49.710
Trying to explain to your dad why you died.
Some other girls,
pubic hair,
not fun.

1228
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:53.790
The fucking bitch.
God is kicked out of the house and we put on strict probation.

1229
01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:57.060
It was a big deal.
We almost literally almost got kicked out of school.

1230
01:18:57.270 --> 01:19:00.420
The worst part was when we were moving out of the house.
About a week later,

1231
01:19:00.421 --> 01:19:04.440
she shows up with my ex boyfriend and she looks amazing.

1232
01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:09.570
She had died the rest of her hair black and cut it in this cute short Bob Style

1233
01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:13.980
and waxed off all the body hair.
She was as beautiful as ever.

1234
01:19:14.210 --> 01:19:18.510
And then she writes in capital letters,
cunt.
I felt like such an ass,

1235
01:19:18.511 --> 01:19:22.690
like there was no way to get back at this bitch.
I guess my life isn't over.

1236
01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:26.940
So someday I will get her back.
I'll make sure to fill you in.

1237
01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:32.700
Okay.
Well I know you haven't asked my advice,

1238
01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:37.530
but uh,
I think you should just let that one go there.
A sweetheart.
I think,

1239
01:19:37.531 --> 01:19:41.490
uh,
you know,
sometimes you just gotta say fuck it.

1240
01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:43.873
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1241
01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:48.950
<v 2>isn't that unbelievable?
I mean,
things like reverse that and if,</v>

1242
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.963
if you,

1243
01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:51.710
<v 3>okay,</v>

1244
01:19:51.710 --> 01:19:55.790
<v 2>if you did that as a guy,
if you did that same thing as a guy,</v>

1245
01:19:55.791 --> 01:20:00.791
you would literally be in a prison shower right now with half a mop handle

1246
01:20:01.161 --> 01:20:02.900
trying to fight off five rapist.

1247
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:07.010
But if you know you have a vagina,
all you get,

1248
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:11.040
you just get kicked out of your house.
It's fucking incredible.

1249
01:20:11.041 --> 01:20:14.760
I still a bit about that shit.
How having a vagina just keeps you out of jail.

1250
01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:20.010
You know,
like,
like give us see,
like when a mob boss gets arrested,

1251
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:23.880
you know,
they never take the wife,
you know,

1252
01:20:23.881 --> 01:20:28.170
like she doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.
Oh,
I just thought he was a baker.

1253
01:20:28.171 --> 01:20:31.320
I thought he was really,
really good at making cookies.

1254
01:20:31.321 --> 01:20:35.430
And that's why I had 20 furs and lived in a lived in a mansion.

1255
01:20:36.210 --> 01:20:38.370
You know what the fuck he was doing,
you know,

1256
01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:40.360
and you spend all that blood money and you,

1257
01:20:40.361 --> 01:20:44.820
and you don't end up fucking going to jail.
It's a,
there's something about it.

1258
01:20:44.821 --> 01:20:48.540
Like they just don't,
uh,
like remember that movie monster's ball,
not monsters,

1259
01:20:48.541 --> 01:20:53.541
ball.monster where they literally turned a serial killer into this sympathetic

1260
01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:59.580
fucking person.
I just didn't,
you know.
Yeah.
He had a rough childhood.

1261
01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:03.260
You know,
you got molested.
What?
You know,

1262
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:05.610
who didn't go write some fucking jokes.

1263
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.940
You don't get a gun and start shooting fucking people.
And if you do,

1264
01:21:08.941 --> 01:21:11.060
you go to jail.
That'll happen.

1265
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:14.730
But that movie was the worst fucking movie ever with those cartoon character

1266
01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.760
male characters that they had and that,
did you see?

1267
01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.080
You remember that part where she goes into apply for the law office job or

1268
01:21:22.081 --> 01:21:25.500
something?
She comes in there looking like this strung out hooker,

1269
01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:29.430
and somehow she's not ushered right out of the fucking office.

1270
01:21:29.431 --> 01:21:34.380
She actually gets in to the lawyers office and he's just like,

1271
01:21:34.381 --> 01:21:38.940
let me tell you something.
You fucking skank.
He's like,
there's over the top.

1272
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:41.100
I really hated that fucking movie.

1273
01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:46.290
And I hate when beautiful actresses don't wear makeup.
And then the,

1274
01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:49.860
everybody falls all over themselves and talks about how brave it is.

1275
01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:54.510
It was so brave.
He was so brave.
All right,

1276
01:21:54.511 --> 01:21:57.420
let's continue on here.
All right,
let me read the last one here,
Bill.
Uh,

1277
01:21:57.421 --> 01:22:00.580
for the past two weeks I've made my girlfriend listened to your podcast.

1278
01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.650
Incidentally,
she loves it.

1279
01:22:01.651 --> 01:22:05.910
This past week she told me about how she got revenge on her ex boyfriend off.

1280
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:10.170
This one is brutal and it's,
it's very,
uh,
doesn't,

1281
01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:11.550
there's no fat on this one.

1282
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:16.270
This one's great because she doesn't get caught.
There's nothing,
you know,

1283
01:22:16.290 --> 01:22:19.140
I don't know ruin here,
but this,
listen to this.
After that messy breakup,

1284
01:22:19.141 --> 01:22:23.490
she logged onto their shared jet blue,
a cow,
you know,
they're going out.
You know,

1285
01:22:23.491 --> 01:22:24.870
I gave her gently that taking trips.

1286
01:22:24.871 --> 01:22:28.950
So they got this JetBlue account and I evidently they boast had the password,

1287
01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:34.220
so she logs onto it and she saw that the Douche bag and his new girlfriend had

1288
01:22:34.351 --> 01:22:36.900
booked a vacation.
Well,

1289
01:22:36.901 --> 01:22:40.920
the morning of their scheduled trip on the morning of the scheduled trip,

1290
01:22:40.921 --> 01:22:44.040
she logged on and canceled the flight.

1291
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:48.520
Can you imagine what a pain in the ass that must've been for them anyways,

1292
01:22:48.521 --> 01:22:50.760
she never saw any activity on the account again.

1293
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.690
I thought that this was pretty funny.
A lot more subtler than king someone's car,

1294
01:22:54.691 --> 01:22:58.170
like a little bitch and whatever and whatever.
That other moron,

1295
01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:03.900
wait,
I'm reading this one and whatever that other more on girl did on the other

1296
01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:08.830
week's podcast.
Wow,
man,
that is,
that is dirty pool right there.

1297
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:11.770
If the guy cheated on you,
yeah,
I can see that.

1298
01:23:11.771 --> 01:23:16.270
But if you just had a messy breakup,
that's uh,
that's been addictive.

1299
01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:18.100
That's really fucked up.

1300
01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:22.150
A lot of these things are really a really fucked up.

1301
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:27.040
You know that die in that girl's pubic hair.
That's,
that's really,
uh,

1302
01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:32.560
you need a hobby at that point.
All right?
Why don't I stop judging people?

1303
01:23:32.561 --> 01:23:35.410
I asked for your fucking revenge stories and now I'm judging you.
All right?

1304
01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.770
Whatever gets overrated,
underrated,

1305
01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:42.580
a overrated karaoke.
Hate it.

1306
01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:45.040
Terrible songs sung by people who can't sing you,

1307
01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.590
which are usually fat chicks and gay guys,

1308
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:51.610
and the off chance that you and your drunk friends find yourself at a karaoke

1309
01:23:51.611 --> 01:23:53.500
bar singing eighties hair metal songs.

1310
01:23:53.710 --> 01:23:58.180
There's always those douchebags and interrupt the fun with a serious gay country

1311
01:23:58.181 --> 01:24:02.500
song.
You know,
I love about this guy.
He says,
Garrick Karaoke is overrated.

1312
01:24:02.530 --> 01:24:05.080
Like people actually love it.
Okay?

1313
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:09.400
Then he says that it's stocks and then in the middle of it,

1314
01:24:09.401 --> 01:24:10.720
he admits doing it.

1315
01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:15.250
But evidently when he and his douchebag friends go up there and sing eighties

1316
01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:19.000
hair metal songs,
that's totally fine.
You know?

1317
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:23.440
But when someone comes up to sing us,
kick a country song,
they are gay.
Dude,

1318
01:24:23.441 --> 01:24:26.110
I hate to tell you this,
but you're part of the fucking problem.

1319
01:24:27.570 --> 01:24:29.320
I'm actually,
you know what,

1320
01:24:29.321 --> 01:24:32.350
actually if you sing an eighties hair metal song and a karaoke thing,

1321
01:24:32.351 --> 01:24:35.560
I'm gonna Laugh my ass off.
And uh,
I liked that better.

1322
01:24:35.561 --> 01:24:38.320
Just as long as someone doesn't go well,
what are the,
what are the fucking tunes?

1323
01:24:38.321 --> 01:24:41.370
Those ships,
I always end up singing.
Uh,

1324
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:46.180
what does that song on that guy sings about losing his virginity?
That,
oh,

1325
01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:47.360
what a nice

1326
01:24:50.010 --> 01:24:51.740
little bag and 63,

1327
01:24:51.741 --> 01:24:55.410
if some reason women love that fucking song and uh,

1328
01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:57.940
this is nothing worse than the female voice,

1329
01:24:57.941 --> 01:25:01.930
like 12 of them all singing in a really high voice.

1330
01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:05.770
It's like a car alarm going off.
All right,

1331
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:11.550
I think we're done for the week.
How are we,
what are we up to?
42 minutes.
Alright.

1332
01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:15.280
Ask Bill is this,
is this podcast petering out here?

1333
01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:18.310
I think I'm doing too much reading and not telling enough stories.
All right,

1334
01:25:18.311 --> 01:25:22.900
let's,
let's,
let's read this one here.
Um,
okay.
Bill.
Uh,

1335
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:26.440
I'm almost 26 and a bunch of my friends still love going to the clubs at night

1336
01:25:26.441 --> 01:25:29.920
and on weekends.
Uh,
now I'm not sure that I'm,

1337
01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:33.190
if I'm getting too old for it or just,
or if I just can't stand people.

1338
01:25:33.191 --> 01:25:35.440
But absolutely the hate going to these places.

1339
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:38.020
I know as a guy who's supposed to go in there and get girls,

1340
01:25:38.021 --> 01:25:40.960
but I just can't take it anymore.
No matter which place it is.

1341
01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.710
It always feels like you should get a mandatory penicillin shout when you leave

1342
01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:48.100
because a group of sweaty skanky people crammed into a room,

1343
01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:51.880
grinding to crappy techno music is just disgusting.

1344
01:25:52.210 --> 01:25:54.340
That combined with the guys with the sonic,

1345
01:25:54.341 --> 01:25:57.430
the hedgehog haircut just drives me crazy,

1346
01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:02.230
especially when they're the ones getting all the girls.
Um,

1347
01:26:02.770 --> 01:26:06.440
is it me or is these places truly horrific?
And at what stage?

1348
01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:08.300
Uh,

1349
01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:13.250
at what and or what age were you officially the old fuck at the club?

1350
01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:19.040
Um,
all right.
All right,
dude.
Tough.
You're being too hard on yourself.

1351
01:26:19.041 --> 01:26:22.730
First of all,
you're only 26 years old.
You're in the prime of your life.

1352
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:26.450
You should be going out talking to women.
You just doing it in a,

1353
01:26:26.451 --> 01:26:30.350
in a bar that's not you.
You know what I mean?

1354
01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.290
Like basically everybody's a douchebag.
Okay.

1355
01:26:33.291 --> 01:26:36.200
But you got to hang out with the same kind of Douche bags so you feel

1356
01:26:36.201 --> 01:26:40.700
comfortable.
You know what I mean?
Like me,
I'm a loner,
psycho Douche bag.

1357
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:45.610
So I used to hang out in dive bars and,
uh,

1358
01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.970
who the fuck am I kidding?
Did I,
then,

1359
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.510
I don't think I ever picked up a girl in a bar.
I always met him at gyms amount.

1360
01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:55.620
I'm on the subway a lot in New York.
Um,
I,

1361
01:26:55.870 --> 01:26:59.090
I meet him when they're not ready.
You know,

1362
01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:01.370
like women don't have their guard up sometimes,

1363
01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:07.250
like on the train,
they have their guard up to get mugged,
not to be hit on,

1364
01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:10.610
I guess.
I Dunno.
Maybe I just felt like,
you know,

1365
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:13.760
I would never did well in those singles bars.
Like,
you know,

1366
01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.850
it's almost like as a comedian,
someone goes,
you're a comedian.
All right,

1367
01:27:16.851 --> 01:27:20.120
say something funny.
It's just like,
you've ruined the moment.

1368
01:27:20.150 --> 01:27:23.960
So I would still go out,
just find,
uh,
you know,

1369
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:27.140
find,
find the right place to hang out.

1370
01:27:27.190 --> 01:27:31.970
He can't hang it up at 26 unless you live in the middle of Kansas and you might

1371
01:27:31.971 --> 01:27:36.740
as well fucking read a Bible and knock up some broad and have eight kids and

1372
01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:41.390
vote for a fucking retard over and over again for eight fucking years.

1373
01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:47.360
Okay.
That was a little mean.
All right.
A question of the week,

1374
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:48.320
a bill,

1375
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:52.450
I was wondering how you handle two shows a one night I was part of the lake

1376
01:27:52.451 --> 01:27:54.110
crowd tonight and you killed what was,

1377
01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:58.700
was it the same scenario in the earlier show with a joke said bombed in the

1378
01:27:58.701 --> 01:28:00.320
earliest show where their jokes in the,

1379
01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:04.640
in the earlier show that bombed that you skipped on the second shell.

1380
01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:07.550
Uh,
no.
You know,

1381
01:28:07.551 --> 01:28:09.920
if it bombed them to stop her and I'm going to keep doing it,

1382
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:14.090
but I'm doing two shows in one night.

1383
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:17.570
I tried to switch it up,
you know,

1384
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:23.050
I just don't want the wait staff and everybody to know exactly how am I actually

1385
01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:27.680
going to go.
Um,
because that's a big thing on the second show and your three,

1386
01:28:27.681 --> 01:28:31.300
three days into your weekend gig.
If,
uh,

1387
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:35.060
you see like the waitresses smiling and stuff and laughing as they're bringing

1388
01:28:35.061 --> 01:28:36.110
drinks over to the table,

1389
01:28:36.111 --> 01:28:40.660
that's like one of the best compliments you can get because,
uh,

1390
01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:45.620
nobody sees more comedy or listens to more comedy than comedy club waitresses

1391
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:49.280
because as a comedian,
if I see a comic and I don't let go what he's doing,

1392
01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:53.150
I can walk out of the room.
But as a,
as a waitress,

1393
01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:58.410
you have to,
you got to keep going back in,
you know,
and,
uh,
so if you can get the,

1394
01:28:58.411 --> 01:29:03.220
you know,
so they get jaded really as far as like,
what's funny and I'm so,

1395
01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:06.370
um,
I didn't know if I answered your question,
but,
no,
I don't really,

1396
01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:09.640
I know what I'm going to start with and I know what I'm going to finish with.

1397
01:29:09.641 --> 01:29:11.460
I don't really know what's going to be in the middle.

1398
01:29:12.190 --> 01:29:12.540
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1399
01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:15.610
<v 2>But I definitely switch up the jokes just so I don't feel like,</v>

1400
01:29:15.650 --> 01:29:20.370
like that groundhog day thing where everything's the same.
So,
uh,

1401
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:21.840
all right.
There's that.
All Right,
Bill,

1402
01:29:21.841 --> 01:29:26.100
I've been listening to your podcasts and I watched you perform because it's nice

1403
01:29:26.101 --> 01:29:28.410
to hear that someone used the word cunt every five minutes.

1404
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:31.530
You don't seem to curse as much when you're performing,

1405
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:34.340
but you're getting to be like,
uh,

1406
01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:37.200
some of the other dirty comics out there on your podcast.

1407
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.640
I think it's quite hilarious.

1408
01:29:38.641 --> 01:29:43.641
How use the word to describe anyone that's pissing you off through unnecessary

1409
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.760
though one necessary most of the time.
Um,
in addition.

1410
01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:49.190
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1411
01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:51.650
<v 2>Oh,
wait a minute.
I already read this already.
Read this tonight.
This is,</v>

1412
01:29:51.651 --> 01:29:54.110
this lady asked me about Saint Patrick's Day.
That was from Cleveland.

1413
01:29:54.111 --> 01:29:55.610
I already read that.
All right,

1414
01:29:55.611 --> 01:29:59.280
so I guess that is the end of the podcast for this week.
Um,

1415
01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:01.640
please give me the feedback,
what you think about the new,
uh,

1416
01:30:01.641 --> 01:30:04.580
the new stereo sound.
I know I need to make some adjustments.

1417
01:30:04.581 --> 01:30:08.060
I know I might've been too close to it a couple of times and I know that there's

1418
01:30:08.061 --> 01:30:10.250
like an echo in the room now and uh,

1419
01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:15.970
I'll put some egg empty egg shelf traits on the fucking side of my walls.

1420
01:30:16.491 --> 01:30:20.120
But whatever.
So,
uh,
so that's the deal.
Um,
just to let you know

1421
01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:25.630
<v 1>my upcoming gigs,
I'm going to be at Iowa state this weekend,</v>

1422
01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:28.780
April 18th,
and that is a private show.

1423
01:30:28.810 --> 01:30:31.960
That show is only for the students of Iowa state.

1424
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:35.740
You need a student Id to get into the show

1425
01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:37.163
<v 3>or</v>

1426
01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.690
<v 1>if you kind of look young and you have a baseball cap,</v>

1427
01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:46.030
maybe you can sneak your way in,
but you didn't hear that from me.
Um,

1428
01:30:46.090 --> 01:30:50.410
the following weekend I'm going to be at the funny bone in Columbus and the

1429
01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:52.570
weekend after that it'll be a Carolina to New York City.

1430
01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:54.050
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1431
01:30:54.050 --> 01:30:58.220
<v 2>Um,
young Joe to Roselle.
We'll be opening for me on both of those shows.</v>

1432
01:30:58.430 --> 01:31:02.240
And then if you'll notice on my,
uh,
my website,

1433
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:07.070
I had to blow out a number of dates.
Tempe,
Ireland,

1434
01:31:08.210 --> 01:31:13.210
Cleveland and Atlanta are all being rescheduled and I can't really tell you why

1435
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:17.780
as of yet.
I'm going to leave you hanging.
How do you like that?

1436
01:31:18.530 --> 01:31:19.363
<v 3>Huh?</v>

1437
01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:24.780
<v 1>Like one of those old fucking Batman and Robin when they're stuck in the machine</v>

1438
01:31:24.781 --> 01:31:27.930
and they're going to fucking die and he got to wait till next week.
Yeah,

1439
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:30.930
I can't really tell you.
I can't actually,
I can't tell you for a minute.

1440
01:31:30.931 --> 01:31:31.890
I kind of a,

1441
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:36.930
something may or may not be going on and I needed to free up my schedule and at

1442
01:31:36.931 --> 01:31:41.220
some point actually in June I'll be able to let you know.

1443
01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:46.790
So
that's the deal.
That's the Monday morning podcast.

1444
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:51.590
And if you like this,
the device I'm using is the Olympus ls 10.

1445
01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:54.650
This fucking thing is a,

1446
01:31:54.651 --> 01:31:59.030
it's pretty incredible and I'm going to have a my own mic next weekend.

1447
01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:04.140
Me and Joe Derosa going to be continuing our uninformed show as a podcast on the

1448
01:32:05.531 --> 01:32:08.650
uh,
my space.com/uninformed radio.

1449
01:32:08.651 --> 01:32:12.670
And we're going to be using this device with a couple of microphones and I think

1450
01:32:12.671 --> 01:32:16.390
we're going to be doing an episode next week and we're going to put it up there

1451
01:32:16.391 --> 01:32:19.720
and it's going to sound lovely and that's it.
And I feel like I'm born.
Yeah,

1452
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:21.250
so that's it.
Everybody.

1453
01:32:21.251 --> 01:32:24.680
Thanks for listening and please keep the questions coming and,
uh,

1454
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:27.370
feel free to keep sending me,
you know,

1455
01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:32.300

uh,
the new ones,

1456
01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:37.560
<v 4>songs,
your top fucking,
your top eight songs that annoy you and shit.</v>

1457
01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:41.650
And in a sports that,

All right.
