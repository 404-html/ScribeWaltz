00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.370
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:05.370
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.190
July 18th,
2016 what's going on?
How are you?
Um,

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.500
I hope you're good.

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.420
I hope things are well as everything okay with you and the family.

6
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.413
<v 0>MMM.</v>

7
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.400
<v 1>Anyways,</v>

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.720
this is the last week of I'm writing forF is for family.

9
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.610
You know,
we've got a table read today and then tomorrow we punch up,
you know,

10
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:33.830
fix whatever jokes didn't work at the table read.

11
00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:37.730
And then on a Wednesday we were,
we record it and then,
uh,

12
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.200
then I get my wife back.

13
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.130
I'm so fucking excited.

14
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.180
I'm so fucking excited to have this,
um,

15
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.200
behind me all these frigging work and um,

16
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.280
I'm very excited for you guys to see this saint.

17
00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:58.730
Granted it's animation so it'll come out sometime fucking 20,

18
00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:01.970
36 or something.
Um,

19
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.680
I dunno.
Well that's how it works.
That's how the process works.

20
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:09.320
But I know the big thing is actually writing the scripts and we're finishing it,

21
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.650
uh,
tomorrow after the punch up and then I'm done.
I literally,

22
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:14.540
I have the same giddiness I used to have.

23
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.450
Remember like the second week of June would just,

24
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:20.630
even the fucking nerds didn't give a fuck anymore.
Right.

25
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:22.970
They weren't cleaning their glasses.
They were just showing up.

26
00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:26.660
They didn't give a fuck.
Right.
It teaches would dress and casual.

27
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.600
Everyone just was,
yeah,
it's over.
It's over.

28
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.090
Let's get the fuck Outta here.

29
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.590
<v 0>You know,
it's unbelievable.</v>

30
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.701
<v 1>I don't get,
you know,
that's,</v>

31
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:40.620
that's why like sometimes when I look at homeless people,

32
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:43.350
because everybody just wants to get the fuck out and nobody,
you know,

33
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:44.184
you just don't want to work.

34
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.560
And every once in a while you look at like these fucking bombs.

35
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:49.350
And I don't mean like people like try something tragic happened to him.

36
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.740
You know what I mean?
I don't know.

37
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:55.830
Like some sinkholes swallowed up the fucking home and then they didn't have

38
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:58.890
sinkhole insurance and now they're fucking,
you know,
sleeping at a bus station.

39
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:03.420
I don't mean those people.
I mean the bumps,
the old school Hobos,

40
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.710
the guys out there riding the fucking railroads.
Right.

41
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.970
Let's stick with a handkerchief around it.

42
00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:12.510
When a little peanut butter and fluff and other sandwich inside of it,

43
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.550
those guys got,
they got to figure it out.

44
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.280
They always feel how I feel right now.
You know why?

45
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:25.200
Because they never have to go to work.
It's always over.
It's always over.
And Hey,

46
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:28.920
you know,
what do you do?
You go to a new town,
you wash some dishes.

47
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.380
Next thing you know,
you know you're eating beans over a fire outside,
you know,

48
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.600
then with the knife or some shit,
you know.

49
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:39.270
Does that one how they used to do it or is that just what the actors used to do

50
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:42.420
when those old movies trying to make an interesting choice?

51
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.950
I want to eat with my knife.
Maybe that'll make me the next John Wayne.
Um,

52
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.300
yeah,
they have it.
Fucking figure it out.
You're never done that.

53
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:53.100
You never just walked down the street in the middle of the day,

54
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:54.690
in the middle of the fucking stressful day.

55
00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:57.510
You're coming back from lunch wondering mentally,

56
00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:59.620
how the fuck am I going to get through the next four,

57
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:00.850
four and a half fucking hours?

58
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.850
He is walked by and you see some homeless guy just fucking just nap and lay it

59
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:11.311
on a park bench or even on the sidewalk and just so fucking sprawled out and

60
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:14.590
just see in such a deep level of sleep.

61
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.610
It yet actually looks appealing for half a second.
You know,

62
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.290
I'd love to interview one of those people.
Just be like,

63
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:24.490
who won the Superbowl this year?

64
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.530
Just to see how out of the loop they are slash how big are sports,
you know,

65
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.810
do you know who tiger woods this?
Do you know what happened to them?

66
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.033
You know,

67
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.270
are you aware that we're at war right now still?

68
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.750
Where were you when it started?
Where you behind a desk?
We are normal.

69
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.670
You know?
Did you have a suit?

70
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.080
Did you sit there and laugh at jokes that you didn't think were funny but just

71
00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:58.470
doing it to try to get to the next level fucking cubicle?
Is that what you did?

72
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.040
At what point did you just decide,
fuck this,

73
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.250
I want to take a nap when I want to nap.

74
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:08.790
Can you imagine if you were allowed to nap whenever you wanted to nap?

75
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.800
How much better the world would be?
You could just be at work and just be like,

76
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.270
Eh,
you know,
I got to go lay it out for about fucking 20 minutes.

77
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.170
Just go over and curl up in a fucking ball and that'll be it.

78
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.510
You know what I'm trying to say?
People's,
I'm very excited.

79
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:31.380
As much as I enjoy writing these fucking things,
it's just great dead.
Uh,

80
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:34.080
you know,
I'm looking at my dog right now.
Just fucking chill it out.

81
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.500
Just fucking lay in that.
She's laying there.
She's,
she,

82
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.180
I don't even know why she's tired.

83
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.770
Fucking tired from all you got damn sleeping.
I'm jealousy.
You cleo,
Cleo,

84
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.400
nothing.
She knows I'm talking about her,
but she doesn't give a shit.

85
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.040
She's fucking tapped out.
She's laying on the rug.

86
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.190
There's a little bit of Sun spilling it from the window,

87
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.160
and she picked the sunny warm part of the rug and that is it.

88
00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:03.690
That's all the fuck she needs.
You know?
No upward mobility.

89
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.770
She's not working on her next fucking season of a,
you know,

90
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:12.150
fucking the real pit bulls of the greater Los Angeles area.

91
00:05:12.151 --> 00:05:15.060
She doesn't give a fuck.
She's got nothing on our agenda every day.

92
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:16.290
It's fucking tremendous.

93
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.860
Maybe that's why their lives are only 10 to 15 years,
you know,

94
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.740
they just get to live like all the,
you know,

95
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.990
cause when you look at your whole life,
if you're lucky,

96
00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:29.850
you get 10 to 15 years total of just bliss and the rest of it,
you know,

97
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:31.110
it was just dealing with some cunt,

98
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:33.060
with coffee breath telling you you didn't have enough,

99
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.070
you didn't bring the right fucking forms.

100
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.910
You got to go back home and go get something else in stand in line again.
That's,

101
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.220
that's what the rest of your life is like.
But if you're lucky,

102
00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:43.980
10 to 15 fucking years of it,
you know,

103
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.080
you get to live like my dog right now,
taking a nap on the sunny part of the rug.

104
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.873
By the way,

105
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.160
there's so much shit going on right now like on the Internet,

106
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.480
on the ear in a web that I just don't understand.
What is the big fucking deal?

107
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.780
You know,
that whole George Bush dancing thing,

108
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:10.100
I looked that up thinking he was going to be just an absolute fucking lunatic.

109
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.360
Like,
oh,
now stop.
Stop you making all white dudes look bad.

110
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:17.600
Everybody already knows we can't dance.
It wasn't bad at all.

111
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.970
You look like he was in a good mood.

112
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.380
You know his fucking energy.
It's like I get that fucking energy.
He's,

113
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.250
he's showing up.
He said,
patriotic son of a bitch.
That's his jam.
You know,

114
00:06:30.251 --> 00:06:35.230
he sways a little bit and you know what's great too is in his head he's laughing

115
00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:38.770
at Obama,
like going,
ah Ha,
you still have to do that job.

116
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.760
George pushes on summer vacation and the fucking look he has on his face.

117
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:47.800
So the same,
look,
I have
all I got to get through.

118
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.430
I just got to get through fucking uh,
basically tomorrow.

119
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.030
Get through the next rewrite and then that's it.
And of course,
you know,

120
00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:59.260
there'll be a zillion punch ups and editing sessions,
but like the fucking daily,

121
00:06:59.261 --> 00:07:01.890
yeah,
grind is a,
it's done.

122
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.450
That's where George Bush is that right now,

123
00:07:04.451 --> 00:07:09.240
if you know he fucking launched the missiles.
All right?

124
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.170
A bunch of fucking people died.
He's mentally past it.

125
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.610
He bought his pieces of land down in South America that sit on aqua firs.

126
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.470
You know?
Who knows?
Maybe he goes out and he gets a fucking 12 peck.
I don't know.

127
00:07:22.471 --> 00:07:24.660
He just looked like a really fucking happy guy.

128
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.760
Since when does a president have to know how to fucking dance?
He does it all.

129
00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:35.761
His fucking job is to get on TV and scare the shit out.

130
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.920
Scare the shit out of you about whatever.

131
00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:41.890
The fucking people above them who want to make money on something.
You know?

132
00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:44.290
We got to get these people.
We got to get those people.

133
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.640
We've got to get some people.

134
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.230
There's some people out there to come and get you coming to get you these
people,

135
00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:52.980
man.
He's playing ball.
They don't lack you.

136
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.890
They don't whack you sitting there on your couch.
It's like,

137
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.620
how the fuck do they not like me?
They don't even know me.

138
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.550
I haven't interacted with these cuts.
You know who has you fuck,

139
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.650
oh,
what did you and your friends do to Piss them off?
You know what I mean?

140
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.500
You went out and you pissed off another fucking country.

141
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.130
Now you're trying to make it seem like they're out to get the I in after me.

142
00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:19.410
They're coming after you.
You can't,
they're never going to get to you.

143
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.810
You know why?
Because you have security and I don't,

144
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.430
and I'm just fucking sitting here sitting here with a mugger fucking t.

145
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.650
That would be great.
Collectively if the world did that,
you know,

146
00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:35.010
in the world leaders,
right?
All of them,
they wanted to start a war.

147
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.400
It'd be like eight people and they'll feel ordinary people,
little fucker.

148
00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:40.290
You know what infidels and all that.
And everybody does.

149
00:08:40.291 --> 00:08:43.760
All regular people just sat down.
I really,
so what's going on?
Well listen dude,

150
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.560
if you got a beef with them,
why don't you go fucking settle it?

151
00:08:46.561 --> 00:08:48.990
Because I've never talked to those people.
And then that's it.

152
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.040
Then we watch it on paper view,
you know,
slap fights,
world leader,

153
00:08:54.041 --> 00:08:58.330
slap fights,
you know,
and it doesn't solve anything other than that.

154
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:03.340
We just get to enjoy complete fucking sociopathic money,

155
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.180
power hungry,
fucking psychos.
Just slapping each other in the face,
you know?

156
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.270
Then we just get to sit in the crowd eating popcorn gone.

157
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.890
<v 3>Oh</v>

158
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.350
<v 1>yeah.</v>

159
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.620
<v 3>Oh,
just watch him slapping each other.</v>

160
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.760
<v 1>That's as far,
you know,
something.
If we were really civilized,</v>

161
00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:27.080
that's as far as it would go.
You know,
we just sit there and watch,
you know,

162
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.690
Obama have a slap fight with the al Qaeda guy or a fucking isis guy and then

163
00:09:32.691 --> 00:09:35.180
that would be it.
And there'd be nobody underneath any of them.

164
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

165
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.030
<v 1>I wouldn't even be Obama.
It would be the fucking,
the corporate cons.</v>

166
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.810
Who make all the fucking money off the misery.
I'm sorry.
People just that,

167
00:09:43.811 --> 00:09:44.950
that you know,
I don't know.

168
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.610
I hate how they always act like the world is going crazy.

169
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.660
The world is not going crazy.
You just keep showing the crazy shit.

170
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.200
It's like these fucking lunatics said [inaudible] who drove the fucking truck

171
00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:01.290
and to the people.
It's like,
why?
Why did that guy do that?

172
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.780
People never did shit like that,
at least to to the,
to the,
when I was growing up,

173
00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:10.380
people did not do shit like that,
at least as far as the,

174
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:13.410
the sheer amount of these fucking incidents now.

175
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.540
And I really think it's because,
I think it's the news coverage.

176
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.180
They wanted their last act on earth.

177
00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:25.920
They want people to then be like inside the crazy mind of Joe blow.

178
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.590
He,
he,
he was born in there.
They get to do his whole fucking backstory.

179
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.110
I think that that's what they're going for.

180
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.490
So obviously when something like that happens,
you got to report on it.

181
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:37.560
But I don't think,
I don't want to know the person's name.

182
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.720
I don't remember how fucking thing up.

183
00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:42.600
But they should die completely fucking anonymous.

184
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.300
And I think if they maybe,
why don't we try that?

185
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:46.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

186
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.140
<v 1>You know,
instead of,
you know,
the people who get fucking killed,</v>

187
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.770
maybe they talk about him for fucking,
you know,
once or whatever.

188
00:10:53.771 --> 00:10:57.280
But the person who fucking kills everybody,
you know,

189
00:10:57.281 --> 00:11:01.240
they get their own little fucking half hour,
hour long special,
you know,

190
00:11:01.241 --> 00:11:04.180
it new as people sit there with their brow furrowed,
you know,

191
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.470
the Sterbai disturbing [inaudible] blah blah blah blah blah.

192
00:11:08.471 --> 00:11:11.740
And they fucking talk about it for 24 hours in and make a zillion dollars in

193
00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:15.010
advertising.
Oh,
I'm a fucking cynical con today.

194
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.410
Absolutely.
But by the way,
that Bush dancing thing was dealt,
was not bad at all.

195
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.530
He looked like he was,
he was in a great mood.
And you know what?
Good for him.

196
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:29.200
Good for him.
That fucking dope
guys say he's a dope.

197
00:11:29.201 --> 00:11:32.410
I can't really say he's a dope guide.
You guys bilingual,
right?

198
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.270
You got to have some sort of brains in there who's smart enough to realize he

199
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:42.100
didn't belong at Yale,
so he fucking drowned it in a 12 pack every 20 minutes.

200
00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:45.100
I mean,
I,
I relate to the guy.
Um,

201
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:46.580
<v 0>okay.</v>

202
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.080
<v 1>Anyways.
Oh,
by the way,</v>

203
00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:52.040
if one more person fucking tweets me about that stupid suspension,

204
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.980
the Tom Brady Think d,

205
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:56.530
the sheer amount of people that don't even understand that,

206
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.560
that has nothing to do.
You know,

207
00:12:00.561 --> 00:12:05.330
like all of a sudden it was proven that Ece,
he is a cheat sheet.
Cheaters.
No,

208
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.600
that's not what that was about.
The first one that was the,

209
00:12:08.601 --> 00:12:12.860
did he cheat and that went to a court of law and was laughed out of court.

210
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.820
The second one,
all that was was the NFL.
They changed their argument.
They go,

211
00:12:16.821 --> 00:12:21.440
we're a corporation.
He's our employee.
Do we have the right to suspend him?

212
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:25.580
And the court was like,
yes,
you do.
And then they came back and they said,
hey Tom,

213
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.230
remember that fucking trial we had with no fucking evidence whatsoever?

214
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.260
That kind of evidence set gets laughed out of court.
Well,

215
00:12:33.261 --> 00:12:36.320
we're going to uphold it so you're suspended.
So

216
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.380
that's basically what happens.

217
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.370
I just don't,
I don't know people here.
What the fuck they want to hear.
All right.

218
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.133
Um,

219
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.730
all freckles has been working out all freckles.

220
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:57.920
He's been working out.
I told you I was up to one 86 and fucking change,
uh,

221
00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:02.450
stepped on the scale this week,
one 82 and change towing the first week,

222
00:13:02.451 --> 00:13:03.980
you can always drop three to four,

223
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.480
because it's such a shock to your system of like,
holy fuck,
we're doing this now.

224
00:13:08.481 --> 00:13:10.550
If you just start eating healthy,
working out,
right,

225
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.600
you stop beating around five or six o'clock and just crush waters and you don't

226
00:13:14.601 --> 00:13:17.210
eat again until late the next morning.
You know,
I'm telling you,

227
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.770
if he can drop three to four now,

228
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.410
now I'm in my second week of this shit.

229
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:29.570
So I want to get down to one 79 and then the week after that one 76.

230
00:13:29.571 --> 00:13:31.820
So I'm in the mid one seventies when I go over to Europe.

231
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.700
So I represent my fucking country properly.
Okay?
All those European concert,

232
00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:41.060
they want nothing more than for me to go over there and be some fat.
Fuck.

233
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.210
You know,
who doesn't know what's going on in the world.
That's what they want.

234
00:13:44.211 --> 00:13:47.570
So what you do is,
is you show up in shape,
right?

235
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.260
You go on Wikipedia,
you Google their fucking city,
right?

236
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.410
You find out what's going on and then you just pretend you're read.

237
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:59.210
You sit there with your flat stomach and you pretend like you've read.

238
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.270
That's what you do.
And you know what?
It irritates him.

239
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.380
I'm fucking with you anyway.

240
00:14:06.381 --> 00:14:09.740
So I'm down to one 82 and uh,

241
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.060
once 79 next week,
the big seven,
I got to see that man,

242
00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:16.220
that's second number's gotta be a seven.
They can't,

243
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:21.080
I refuse to be an eight or higher ever.
I just can't fucking do it.

244
00:14:21.081 --> 00:14:23.270
Although having said that at my age,

245
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:28.370
how slow my metabolism is and how much I like to fucking eat and drink and all

246
00:14:28.371 --> 00:14:32.180
of that shit,
I could easily,
I could hit two bills.
Like if I really,

247
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:33.210
<v 0>okay,</v>

248
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:37.410
<v 1>like just shut it all down as far as moving around,
you know,</v>

249
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.780
I just stopped doing shows and I just sat here like my dog,
I swear to God,
dude,

250
00:14:42.781 --> 00:14:45.210
I could be 200 pounds by the beginning of October.

251
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.260
<v 0>Right?</v>

252
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.530
<v 1>That's not even fucking trying without even fucking trying.
If just ate,</v>

253
00:14:51.531 --> 00:14:53.420
what the fuck I wanted to eat?
I,
oh my God.

254
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.110
Is there a worst site then if fucking

255
00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.770
five,
nine and three,
quarter 210 pound redheaded male,

256
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.800
that's not something that you want to see.
And I don't mean muscle,

257
00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.100
I just meet coming at you looking like,
you know,

258
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.280
I work at dairy queen and I'm constantly taking advantage of my employee

259
00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:18.200
discount and nobody wants to see that.
Right.

260
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.890
It's not a man looking like my legs,

261
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:26.950
my pasty fat fucking legs as white as the soft serve vanilla ice cream that I

262
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:31.850
have every 20 minutes.
So anyways,

263
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:36.770
I'm going to get down to,
um,
once 79 next week.

264
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.053
Um,

265
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:39.520
<v 0>okay.</v>

266
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.270
<v 1>I just been fucking hitting the God damn elliptical and a dude.</v>

267
00:15:43.271 --> 00:15:47.170
My sciatica is just,
it's completely fucking gone.
Uh,

268
00:15:47.171 --> 00:15:51.070
I'm going for not getting a massage every fucking week.
Right.

269
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.300
That deep tissue.

270
00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.750
Just somebody beats the shit out of you and I'm getting all of this stuff.

271
00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:56.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

272
00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.900
<v 1>All of these fucking wall is crap that was in my legs from all of these years.</v>

273
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.203
<v 0>MMM.</v>

274
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.010
<v 1>Flying on planes,
playing pickup hockey with no hockey stuff.</v>

275
00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.440
You know,
they tell you guys that shit.
No,
I don't think I did.
Yeah,

276
00:16:13.441 --> 00:16:15.270
I had a nother fucking massage.

277
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:21.150
This lady had an elbow jam so far into the back of my leg,
my hamstring.

278
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.870
I was like having memories of every time I fucked up my leg,

279
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.650
she did a spot and I'd be like,
and then I'd be like,
Oh yeah,

280
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.850
that was the time I played pickup hockey.
And all I had was gloves,

281
00:16:32.851 --> 00:16:36.540
a helmet and a stick.
And I was playing defense,
right.

282
00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.330
And I'm skating full speed,
you know,

283
00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:41.580
cause we have the puck and all of a sudden they steal it.

284
00:16:41.581 --> 00:16:44.460
And I tried to fucking turn around to go back the other way.
Dude.

285
00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:47.310
And I caught an edge.
Who's getting who I suck at skating.

286
00:16:47.311 --> 00:16:51.990
I could barely go backwards and I fucking shot up in the air and landed on my

287
00:16:51.991 --> 00:16:55.230
left side ass cheek all the way down to my thigh.

288
00:16:55.670 --> 00:17:00.540
I landed so hard,
I didn't even hit my head and I still saw stars.
And,

289
00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:03.810
uh,
that was one of those things where I didn't even try to get up.

290
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.460
I just sat there for a second,

291
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:09.240
just waiting for everything to settle afterwards and the

292
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.080
bucket,
I got up fast enough before everybody came over and said,

293
00:17:16.081 --> 00:17:18.180
dude,
you are right.
You are right.
You don't want to be that guy.

294
00:17:18.181 --> 00:17:22.970
And I just fucking like,
you know,
skated over to the bench,
one leg working there.

295
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:26.850
It was just like,
Eh,
hey,
oh hey all the way over.

296
00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:31.830
And I just sat down and like I,
you know,
you know,
pick up hockey,

297
00:17:31.831 --> 00:17:34.470
people skate over and they pointed at you.
I shook off like three,

298
00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:39.471
three times before I went back out there and the bruise was so deep,

299
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.020
it didn't show up for like three days.

300
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:48.410
Like three days later I was on the road and I'm showering and you know,

301
00:17:48.721 --> 00:17:52.650
I thought,
I thought I saw like a bunch of grease on the back of my leg.
I'm like,

302
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:55.020
what the fuck did I sit on?
And then I saw was a Bruce.

303
00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:59.520
It literally looked like somebody just took a bat and hit me right across the

304
00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:03.470
back of my left leg.
And,
um,
you know,
ever,

305
00:18:03.471 --> 00:18:06.300
this is kind of what I learned.
I thought like when the bruise went away,

306
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:10.320
then you will all fine.
Uh,
but evidently that's not the deal.

307
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:11.790
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

308
00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.200
<v 1>The reason why it takes that long,</v>

309
00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:15.780
I guess for it to come to the surface is because it's so fucking,

310
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.580
whatever you hit was so fucking deep into the muscle.
It took that long for a,

311
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.130
I forget the person explained it to me,

312
00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:25.440
a bunch of busted capillaries or something like that.

313
00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:28.380
And then when they go to heal,
sometimes they confuse to something else.

314
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.640
I don't know,
fuse to a nerve or some shit.
I have no idea.
I don't remember.

315
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.970
I don't pretend to remember,
but all I know is,
um,

316
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.200
a bunch of shit like that happened slash you know,

317
00:18:40.201 --> 00:18:44.010
flying on planes and sitting on my fucking ass and writers' rooms and that's

318
00:18:44.011 --> 00:18:46.950
what's going to happen.
But what I love is,
you know,

319
00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:50.070
all these people who have back problems with telling me that I'll do what you're

320
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:53.250
going to have this for the rest of your life and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

321
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:54.061
I mean,

322
00:18:54.061 --> 00:18:57.600
I didn't fly helicopter for like fucking three months during this because when I

323
00:18:57.601 --> 00:18:58.141
sat down,

324
00:18:58.141 --> 00:19:01.530
my feet went numb and I can't have my fucking feet going numb when I'm trying to

325
00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:06.480
touch the pedals there.
Um,
but no,

326
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:11.370
I,
if you find,
if you find a fucking,
a real Mizuho's of fucking incredible one,

327
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.590
they can figure out what the fuck's wrong with you.

328
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:15.180
And even beyond a chiropractor,

329
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.870
they beat the fuck out of you and they loosen everything up and then everything

330
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:21.360
relaxes and you go back to be normal.

331
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:24.340
At least that's what the fuck happened with me.
And uh,

332
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.470
I flew for the first time Wednesday.
Uh,
it was tremendous.
It was tremendous

333
00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.570
of Jesus Christ of at that is that,
that's a,
is that a fucking raven?

334
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:39.260
<v 4>Hey,
hey,
hey yo man,</v>

335
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.170
get out of here.

336
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.303
<v 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

337
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:50.050
How old am I that I had to yell that long in a bird before it left back in the

338
00:19:50.051 --> 00:19:54.070
day I stepped on a stick in the fucking thing took off.
What does that mean?

339
00:19:54.071 --> 00:19:58.150
Was that a cro or a fucking raven?
All right.
We got to look this shit up here.

340
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.930
Some fucking ancient medieval history shit for you,

341
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.820
Raven.
Uh,
what do you say here?
Raven.

342
00:20:07.821 --> 00:20:12.320
I'm Super Raven.

343
00:20:12.321 --> 00:20:16.230
Superstition.
Alright,
let,
what do we got here?
What do we got here?
Ravens.

344
00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:19.390
Symbolism.
Ravens.
Symbolism.

345
00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:20.973
<v 2>Okay.</v>

346
00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.190
<v 1>Myths of the Raven,
symbolisms and lore.</v>

347
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:29.680
Learn about the lore of Ravens bar.
I know.
That's what I'm here for.
All right.

348
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:34.840
The Raven often has a bad press for being a Carrion Carrie and burn.

349
00:20:34.841 --> 00:20:39.580
I know what that means.
C.
A.
R.
R.
I.
O.
N.
It is ultimately associated with death.

350
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.400
Tremendous.
Finally getting fucking healthy.

351
00:20:42.401 --> 00:20:47.350
Now I'm going to die and consequently considered a bad omen by many or a

352
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:51.280
forewarning of war.
Not Jesus knee is going to yell at me,

353
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.930
but there is much more to this egg,
egg,
nomadic and intelligent bird than death,

354
00:20:55.931 --> 00:21:00.850
darkness and destruction.
Raven is a trickster or protector,
a teacher,

355
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.890
and a bringer of great magic.

356
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.630
I would love to see the person who wrote this,
like what they would dress like.

357
00:21:07.631 --> 00:21:11.650
I just picture them and like a fucking Toga with the leaves.
You know the hats.

358
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.600
They'd have leaves on the side.

359
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.690
It's like if he had a full head of leaf hair and then you went bald,

360
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.280
just fucking wrapped around.
You learn all about the raven and it's Laura here.

361
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:26.200
Well,
that's what the fuck.
I'm here for your comments.
All right,

362
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.030
so raven is not only the largest member of the crow family.
Oh,

363
00:21:29.031 --> 00:21:29.930
I didn't know that.

364
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:31.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

365
00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:35.610
<v 1>It's the big brother,
but the largest perching bird in the world.</v>

366
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.413
<v 0>Okay.</v>

367
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:42.550
<v 1>I thought they all perched.
The Ozu lay down and extremely intelligent bird.</v>

368
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:44.590
The Raven was once extremely common,

369
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:49.150
but persecution now finds it only in remote areas such as cliffs,

370
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:52.490
mountains,
and moon and more moods and morse.

371
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.290
It's amazing the amount of English words.
I don't know what they are at Morris.

372
00:21:56.291 --> 00:22:01.240
I thought those were Africans.
I just,

373
00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:02.230
I don't fucking,
I don't.

374
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.200
I evidently it was a crow because I don't have any of those things.

375
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

376
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.170
<v 1>No cliff.
There's no mountain.
I have a porch.</v>

377
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.640
The adult is completely black with a shaggy through.
I don't care.

378
00:22:12.641 --> 00:22:13.900
What the fuck does it mean?

379
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.730
Ravens are extremely intelligent in some cases can even learn to talk.
All right.

380
00:22:20.731 --> 00:22:24.750
That wasn't a fucking raven.
I was just yelling at it.
Hey,
hey.
Would've been like,

381
00:22:24.751 --> 00:22:25.584
what?

382
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.010
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

383
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.750
<v 1>That would have freaked me out.
I'd be like,
Oh,
you know,</v>

384
00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:32.080
it was just one on one or if you'd leave,
there'll be cool.

385
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.080
The wolf and the Raven are often mentioned together and mythology.

386
00:22:35.081 --> 00:22:37.300
Laura and scripture in nature,

387
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.970
the wolf and the Raven Heaven important relationship.

388
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:45.180
Wolves use ravens as an Ariel Ariel spotters for possible sources of food as

389
00:22:45.401 --> 00:22:47.860
well as using them to alert them of danger ahead.

390
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:53.020
The Raven also gains from this relationship with the wolf being carrying birds.

391
00:22:53.021 --> 00:22:56.880
I'm so sick of reading that fucking word.
What does it mean?
C.
A.
R.

392
00:22:56.881 --> 00:22:58.690
R.
I.
O.
N.
You know it's funny.

393
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.280
The amount of people that are listening to this right now.

394
00:23:00.281 --> 00:23:03.340
And they feel superior to me cause they know what this word means.
Yeah.

395
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:05.650
And what does that Kenny,
is that going to buy you a sandwich today?

396
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:13.230
The decaying flesh of dead animals.
Okay,

397
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.680
so that's what it needs.
All right,
so it's like a fucking,

398
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.570
it's like one of those birds.
A vulture spreads with the fucking redhead.

399
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.740
No fucking feathers.

400
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.760
I know why they don't have feathers on their heads because they're always eating

401
00:23:26.761 --> 00:23:29.310
a dead carcasses and they don't want the maggots to get in there.

402
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.190
So they do whatever fucking bacteria and shit gets on their head.

403
00:23:32.191 --> 00:23:33.630
Just gets burned off by the sun.

404
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.390
Although I can't tell you I look like a raven after not a raven.

405
00:23:37.391 --> 00:23:42.060
If I look like a fucking vulture,
if I go to the beach,
big fucking redhead,

406
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:46.250
you know,
and I eat dead meat too.
Right?
Ham Sandwich.
That's a dead pig.

407
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.910
Jesus Christ.
This is an incredible article.
All right.

408
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:53.270
The Raven also gains from its relationship to put the,
okay,

409
00:23:53.271 --> 00:23:55.880
obviously if the wolf fuck and kill something,
what?
Jesus Christ.

410
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.420
I don't think I can find two more boring animals on the planet than those two

411
00:23:59.421 --> 00:23:59.871
fuckers.

412
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:03.770
I think they deserve each other probably both in bed by eight every night.

413
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.880
Um,
all right,
let me,
let me do a couple of fucking reads here.

414
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.350
You got a lot of advertising.

415
00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:12.240
We didn't have any on fucking Thursday so I got to make up for 'em.

416
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:13.850
<v 0>Okay,</v>

417
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:17.510
<v 1>I got to make up for this shit here.
Alright.
Hey,
uh,
hey.
Um,
no,
no,
no.</v>

418
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.110
That's a read.
Actually here I need the advertising.

419
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.370
Where the fuck is he advertising?
All right.
Hey Billy,
his grip strength,
uh,

420
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.910
you fucking jerk off.
He did the same one twice.

421
00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:31.460
So it really going to be one of these days.

422
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.590
All right,
hang on a second.
People,
I apologize.

423
00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:43.980
Hang on.

461
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.320

466
00:27:18.091 --> 00:27:20.700
score big everyone.
You know what?

467
00:27:20.701 --> 00:27:24.090
You're paying too much for tickets between all the markups and last minute

468
00:27:24.091 --> 00:27:26.570
convenience charges.
Even printed home,

469
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.790
even printed home feast the ultimate fuck over.

470
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.790
You end up paying courtside prices for nosebleed seats.

471
00:27:32.791 --> 00:27:34.920
Scorebig is here to change that.

472
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:40.370
Did you know that 40% of all live ticket events go on sold and did you know that

473
00:27:40.711 --> 00:27:44.680
there's a place to get these seats?
That huge savings.
It's called score.
Big

474
00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:46.630
Score.

475
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:50.040

476

477
00:27:52.891 --> 00:27:57.600
Can you name a ticket price and be guaranteed to pay below box office up to 60%

478
00:27:57.601 --> 00:28:01.350
off Jesus Christ.

Why don't you do this with the Superbowl?

482
00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.730
Because evidently 40% of those tickets go on sold and you can pay for less,

483
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:18.920
less than a ticket value.

We got like 20 of these.

495
00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:01.960
Oh look who's back bait back.

496
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:07.070
Mejan ds me undies live and on an aqua for boo Doo doot Doo me undies,

497
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.830
me,
Andy's,

498
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:14.831
get some for him and her wrap up her twat or your balls.

499
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:20.690
Then walk into the fucking water falls,
you balls stay dry.
Even if they're cold,

500
00:29:20.691 --> 00:29:22.430
they fucking travel up all yeah,

501
00:29:22.431 --> 00:29:26.900
and pull into your body so you don't freeze to death.

502
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.900
All right?
Whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

503
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.410
you spent almost 24 hours a day in your underwear,

504
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:37.520
but instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his everyday

505
00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:41.450
clothes,
your underwear is probably boring me.

506
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.680
Andy's is here to change that.
Um,

507
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:48.580
every pair of meundies is made from sustainable source modal modality of fabric

508
00:29:48.581 --> 00:29:50.310
that's twice as soft as cotton.

509
00:29:50.311 --> 00:29:53.380
Nothing could describe the fit and the feel of me undies.

510
00:29:53.381 --> 00:29:55.600
But once you try them on and you'll understand why they're,

511
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.260
why they are called the world's most comfortable underwear.

512
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.950
And if you don't love your first pair of me undies,
they are free.

513
00:30:02.951 --> 00:30:03.970
No questions asked me.

514
00:30:03.971 --> 00:30:08.530
UNDIES has dozens of styles and limited edition prints to help you make a

515
00:30:08.531 --> 00:30:12.970
statement with your underwear.
Where there anyone can see them or not.

516
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:15.810

522
00:30:32.651 --> 00:30:34.870
there's three left and I'm going to read those later.

523
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:40.350
Let's get back to the fucking podcast.
Here I am sweating here.

524
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:45.190
Roche didn't bake in Boyd.
Um,
you don't actually checked in.

525
00:30:45.191 --> 00:30:47.110
I checked in on the world of baseball.

526
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:50.650
I have not looked at all my fucking Boston Red Sox,

527
00:30:50.651 --> 00:30:55.651
if I can call them that or a game out behind the Baltimore Orioles and we're in

528
00:30:56.141 --> 00:30:59.500
between two dirty birds,
Orioles and Blue Jays,
right?

529
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.400
Yankees are in fourth.
Tampa Bay's bringing up the fucking rear.

530
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:08.350
Here's what's interesting to me in first place.
You got Cleveland.
All right.

531
00:31:08.351 --> 00:31:09.370
You got Baltimore.

532
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.400
They have not won a world series since 1983 you got the Cleveland Indians.

533
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.680
They haven't won since like fucking was in 1948 or something.

534
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.450
Texas has never won.
You got the Washington senators,

535
00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.680
they're in first place.
They used to be the expos.
They never want.

536
00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:31.681
They should have won in 94 but the fucking strikes fucking cutoff the whole

537
00:31:31.841 --> 00:31:34.240
season.
The Chicago cubs,

538
00:31:34.241 --> 00:31:39.241
they haven't won since 1907 and then the San Francisco giants who've won every

539
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.420
other year,
this decade.
All right,

540
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.900
look at that to fucking Los Angeles Dodgers and only game and half out.

541
00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:50.590
I have no fucking clue because they're not on my cable service because they had

542
00:31:50.591 --> 00:31:54.730
some fucking country country fight with somebody.
It's just the worst.

543
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.840
So this is pretty cool,
man.
What a great year for baseball.
You know?

544
00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:03.280
All right.
If I had,
if I could see Baltimore,
Cleveland or Texas,

545
00:32:03.281 --> 00:32:07.960
I would pick Cleveland.
If I could see Washington cubs or San Francisco,

546
00:32:07.961 --> 00:32:10.320
you got to go with the cubs,
right?
No,

547
00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:14.650
they're foofy fucking fans taking their shirts off at the fucking games.

548
00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:19.390
They don't give a shit.
Right?
So if it was Cleveland first to cubs,
you know,

549
00:32:19.391 --> 00:32:22.930
I got to go with Cleveland.
They just won an NBA title.

550
00:32:22.931 --> 00:32:26.440
Let's see them get the fucking,
you know,

551
00:32:26.441 --> 00:32:29.500
the monkey off their back with baseball.
And I would root for the cubs,

552
00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:34.501
but I just don't think that people care enough every time it's ca may out towed

553
00:32:34.551 --> 00:32:39.410
up,
all gay.
It's just too fucking happy there.
And I also blame them.

554
00:32:39.411 --> 00:32:43.760
I really feel like because they do that stupid shit in the seventh inning.

555
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:48.860
That's why the fuck in,
uh,
you know,

556
00:32:48.861 --> 00:32:51.290
the Yankees Play,
why MCA?

557
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:55.130
And that's why the red sox play that fucking horrific sweet Caroline.

558
00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:57.040
The cubs started it.

559
00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:58.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

560
00:32:58.330 --> 00:32:59.770
<v 1>And because you created that,</v>

561
00:32:59.771 --> 00:33:03.430
and I have to go anytime I see a red sox game and I have to watch a woman put

562
00:33:03.431 --> 00:33:06.730
her head on the shoulder of a boyfriend during the seven things stretch is

563
00:33:06.731 --> 00:33:10.570
everybody sing said horrifically creepy fucking song.
You know,

564
00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.340
I kind of hope the cubs go another hundred and fucking six years.
100,

565
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:18.300
they're up to 108 years.
You know what I mean?

566
00:33:18.301 --> 00:33:20.070
Not even the Phillies went that long.

567
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.760
The biggest losers and professionals and then always want lots more fucking

568
00:33:23.761 --> 00:33:26.980
games and those cons.
Um,
and they went,
almost done.

569
00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:32.030
They went from like 1880 to 1980 are like 1882 to 1980 let me see.

570
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:37.590
Chicago cubs,
Chicago cubs,

571
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.920
last world.
Look at that.
Comes right up.

572
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:45.270
1907 I'm sorry.
1908

573
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.180
<v 0>okay.</v>

574
00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:51.070
<v 1>What'd you look at that?
So it's been a hundred and fucking eight years.</v>

575
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:56.030
They should keep it going at that point.
You know what I mean?
You just,

576
00:33:56.031 --> 00:33:58.550
you just be who you are.
Right.

577
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.010
Plus the fucking white sox one.
One.

578
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.420
I don't understand cities that have to fucking teams.
I just don't get it.

579
00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:09.510
And one of the team wins it and you don't go to the parade.
It's like it's it.

580
00:34:09.511 --> 00:34:10.910
It represents you city.

581
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:20.070
How many fucking teams do you need?
New York City,
evidently,

582
00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:23.760
in order to remain successful for as much shit as New York City talks,

583
00:34:23.761 --> 00:34:26.400
they need two football teams,
two baseball teams,

584
00:34:26.401 --> 00:34:28.650
two basketball teams and two hockey teams.

585
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

586
00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.220
<v 1>Fucking unbelievable.</v>

587
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:36.150
I Dunno if you come from a real city like Boston,

588
00:34:36.151 --> 00:34:40.500
you just need four and a fucking soccer team and they'll all went championships.

589
00:34:40.501 --> 00:34:41.910
If you know what the fuck you doing,

590
00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:47.630
you don't have to hedge your bets doubled down in every fucking sport telling

591
00:34:48.361 --> 00:34:49.194
you,

592
00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.370
<v 0>okay.</v>

593
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:54.330
<v 1>You know,
it's really making,
my day is Rapaport is just been lately.
The Guy,</v>

594
00:34:54.331 --> 00:34:57.960
he's just,
he just won't fucking leave me alone.
He was all,

595
00:34:57.961 --> 00:35:01.500
he was another one guy all excited about the Tom Brady fucking,
I was like,

596
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.750
Michael,
I agree with the suspension.

597
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.960
A corporation should be allowed to suspend an employee,

598
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.820
even if it is complete horseshit.
He,
I just don't,
he's a giants fan.

599
00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.190
They fucking own the patriots in the Superbowl.

600
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.260
Why can't he just be happy with that?

601
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:20.160
You know what it is about New York fans is when they look at Boston fans,

602
00:35:20.161 --> 00:35:23.610
they don't see the misery anymore.
You know,
we can talk shit.

603
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.370
It's fucking great and they don't know how to handle it.

604
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:29.700
They want us to be miserable again and we're not,

605
00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:34.500
and it's driving them nuts and like the misery that Rapoport has that I'm not

606
00:35:34.501 --> 00:35:39.090
miserable.
That's the kind of people that these New York sports fans are.

607
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.910
That's why they got to get all of these fucking teams.

608
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:47.010
They're like a fucking,
uh,
they're like Walmart.

609
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.970
They're trying to fucking,
you know,
I have so many locations.

610
00:35:50.971 --> 00:35:53.520
They put everybody else out of fucking business.
It's just,

611
00:35:53.521 --> 00:35:56.940
it's not going to happen.
It's not going to fucking happen.
All right,

612
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.030
so why don't,
why don't you get three teams in every sport then?

613
00:36:00.031 --> 00:36:04.110
Maybe you could run the table in 10 years.
You fucking cunts.
All right.

614
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:08.250
Um,
oh God.
Who would ever thought is a Boston sports fan?

615
00:36:08.251 --> 00:36:10.530
I could just sit here and laugh at New York sports friends.

616
00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:13.830
I never thought that that was going to happen,
you know?

617
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:17.490
And here I am all fucking happy.

618
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.300
Uh,
fuck.
What am I up to?
36 minutes.
Okay,
here we go.
Here we go.
All right.
Hey,

619
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.630
let's do some reads here.
Hey,
Billy,
grip strength.

620
00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:31.550
I'm one of your listeners wrote in last week,
uh,

621
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.560
wrote in last week to ask about his hairy girlfriend.

622
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.430
I'm not sure what he ended up telling her or if he sent you an update.

623
00:36:38.431 --> 00:36:39.360
But unfortunately,

624
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:44.250
I've had experience with this on a couple of occasions now,

625
00:36:44.251 --> 00:36:47.220
for those of you who didn't listen to the other day,

626
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:50.490
this guy was dating this Brazilian woman,
you know,

627
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:54.870
so you know she's fucking smoking hot,
but you know,
she just had a little issue.

628
00:36:54.871 --> 00:36:58.080
She had a little bit of further are fucking arms and uh,

629
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:03.150
with a tramp stamp would go,
you know,
the tattoo could get lost in the weeds,

630
00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:06.570
if you know what I mean.
So he wanted to tell it a fucking wax a little bit.

631
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.500
Cause you know,
I mean Jesus Christ,

632
00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.090
you don't doing it doggy style.
She's got like a fucking Afro,

633
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.180
just have up a booty crack.
I mean,
yeah,
I mean what,
what,

634
00:37:18.181 --> 00:37:21.890
what's going on with that?
So,

635
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:27.000
but how do you tell somebody that,
I mean,
women can tell guys that in a second,

636
00:37:27.001 --> 00:37:31.260
like,
you should wax your back.
I Dunno.
You know,
it just grosses me out.

637
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.370
And you're like,
all right,
if that's what it takes them,
you keep fucking me.

638
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:40.350
Right.
You can't tell these ladies anything.
You know,

639
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:45.840
honey,
I love you to death,
but you're back.
Reminds me of Gabe Kaplan.
Um,

640
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.800
I had an experience with this on a couple of occasions.
Um,

641
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:54.420
under no circumstance should you ever tell her she's Harry.

642
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.040
I was dating an Indian broad for awhile and she had excessive hair growth on her

643
00:37:59.041 --> 00:38:02.940
forearms,
lower back,
feet and toes.

644
00:38:02.941 --> 00:38:05.340
But worst of all,
nose hair.

645
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:09.270
Let that he said,
imagined.

646
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.560
Let that image sinking is what you wanted to say.
Uh,

647
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:16.170
this check was super cool and very attractive,

648
00:38:16.171 --> 00:38:21.171
but the hair situation was bothering me so I broke up with her at her place,

649
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:26.730
but made the mistake of telling her why.
Oh God,
dude,
why would you do that?

650
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:32.040
Let it be known.
This was a bad idea.
Well,
no,
dude,
if he's just told her,
you know,

651
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.370
there was a way you don't,
obviously if you fucking and listen,

652
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:39.820
I'm breaking up with you.
I think you're a sweetheart,

653
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.330
but physically I can't deal with all of your hair.
Yeah,

654
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:45.550
that's going to devastate her anyways.

655
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.710
<v 0>Okay.</v>

656
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:51.030
<v 1>Long story short,
she flipped her shit and threw plates,
silverware,
pots,</v>

657
00:38:51.031 --> 00:38:54.330
et Cetera at me was screaming and crying.

658
00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:58.440
So I left when I came back later for my shit.

659
00:38:58.441 --> 00:39:03.390
She had thrown bleach on some of my clothes and stapled condoms to the wall.

660
00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:07.370
You could say things got hairy,
lol.

661
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:12.550
Why do women just get to just destroy men's property all of the fucking time?

662
00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.430
You don't like if the cops show up and she's throwing all your shit up,

663
00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.970
they do a light sweet.
I'll comp calm down.
I started just getting the car.

664
00:39:20.971 --> 00:39:24.930
Just just get away from her sister.
She calms down.
It's destruction of property.

665
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.590
There's like a zillion youtube videos of,
of

666
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:34.320
women just destroying their guys cars.
I don't understand it.

667
00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:38.040
I really think men should start prosecuting them.
Them them for this shit.

668
00:39:38.041 --> 00:39:41.760
We always just go like,
hey dude,
she fucking flipped out.
Whatever.

669
00:39:41.761 --> 00:39:46.050
I can get another flat screen.
Just get her away from me.
I'm all in all he said,

670
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:46.500
um,

671
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:51.420
if the listener hasn't told this lady about his displeasure of her hair,

672
00:39:51.421 --> 00:39:55.980
I highly recommend he doesn't.
Well,
dude,
you fucking told her.

673
00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:57.780
He should have just said listen in,

674
00:39:57.781 --> 00:40:00.180
but that's the fucking reason you were going to break up with that.

675
00:40:00.181 --> 00:40:03.880
You should not have brought it up.
What did you say?

676
00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.080
Yeah,
listen to.
Yeah,
we,
uh,
we got to talk.

677
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:09.243
<v 0>MMM.</v>

678
00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:15.440
<v 1>This isn't working for me.
Why?
Yeah.
I'm just not happy.
Well,</v>

679
00:40:15.441 --> 00:40:20.210
what is it?
Did I do something?
I said something.
I said,
what's the problem?

680
00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.740
Uh,
you're,
you're too Harry.
You have hairy toes.

681
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:29.480
You have hair above your ass and it's coming out of your nose.
And I just,

682
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:34.370
you know,
you just reminded me of John Matousek and I just,
you know,

683
00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.730
it's turning me like why would you do that to somebody that what you did serve

684
00:40:37.731 --> 00:40:41.120
was fucking mean.
Um,
on once one,

685
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.710
pardon me,
actually.

686
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:46.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

687
00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:50.150
<v 1>Respects the fact that you actually communicate and even was fucking mean is</v>

688
00:40:50.151 --> 00:40:52.070
you're going to get what you want in life.
If you,

689
00:40:52.071 --> 00:40:55.250
if you just don't give a fuck about other people's feelings to that level,

690
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:57.800
you're never going to end up trapped in a fucking relationship.

691
00:40:57.801 --> 00:41:01.070
So it's good that you do that,
but in the future,
surf,
you're going to broke at,

692
00:41:01.071 --> 00:41:05.420
break up with something,
some something,
somebody because of something physical,

693
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.990
you know,
it keep that to yourself.
You know,

694
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.350
cause who's kidding who?
Dude,
that's not the only reason why you broke up there.

695
00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:18.790
You know,
if you get good at fucking teller,
she was too fucking hairy.

696
00:41:18.791 --> 00:41:21.220
If you're still liked her,
why won't you just say,
listen,

697
00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:25.480
can you do me a fucking favor?
You got hairy toes.

698
00:41:25.481 --> 00:41:29.140
Can we start off with that?
Jesus Christ.
I was like,

699
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:32.890
I'm dating a fucking cave woman.
It's 2016.

700
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.660
Have you watched any porn or when your life,
all right,
on a side note,
he said,

701
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.030
you mentioned your home gym and current workouts,

702
00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:45.380
but I've never heard you talk about dead lifts.
Do you plan on doing them?

703
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:48.230
And if you already do,
what type of progress are you making?

704
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:51.300
Thanks to go flog yourself.
What is a dead lift?

705
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.910
Is that the one where you fucking bend over at the waist and pull it up?

706
00:41:55.911 --> 00:41:57.170
Or is that the one where you fucking,

707
00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:01.700
you act like you're in the Olympics and you lift it up over your head.
Um,

708
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:06.320
both of those look like something I shouldn't be doing at my age.
All right.

709
00:42:06.321 --> 00:42:09.470
Videos,
deadlift.
All right,

710
00:42:09.471 --> 00:42:12.470
five common mistakes.
The dead lift.

711
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.600
All right,
here we go.

712
00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:23.010
Oh Jesus.
What is this for that?
So that's the one,
the old blow out your back one.

713
00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.050
No.
If you use proper form,

714
00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:28.890
does the lifter have an Instagram?

715
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.490
His hip should be the first things that move.

716
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:37.520
There's a lot of vital information missing from this hips,

717
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:42.250
hip wide stance hands just outside.
They have full grip of the bar.

718
00:42:42.251 --> 00:42:46.500
Shoulders slightly in front of the bar.
Lumbar curve maintained.

719
00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:49.140
So add Shabak yeah,
dude,

720
00:42:49.141 --> 00:42:52.290
I'm going to give a big fuck that to that exercise unless you can tell me what

721
00:42:52.291 --> 00:42:57.180
the hell it does to me other than increase my chances of blowing out my back.
Um,

722
00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:58.970
<v 0>okay.</v>

723
00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:01.860
<v 1>I,
I just kind of what for legs?
I go hiking and I do,</v>

724
00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.580
I do body weight exercises,
you know,

725
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.170
the same way I do grip strength stuff.

726
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.840
I'm really into just being able to move my fucking body.

727
00:43:09.841 --> 00:43:11.280
I don't need to pick up a car.

728
00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:16.440
Like I'm grabbing it by bumper and try to use my fucking proper form.
But um,

729
00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:19.230
who knows,
you know what,
I'll,
I'll look those up,
you know?

730
00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:20.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

731
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:22.790
<v 1>I'm sure I'm going to get a big fucking lecture on.</v>

732
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.900
<v 5>Oh my God.
You don't do dead lifts.
You might as well Nubby we're good at it.
Okay.</v>

733
00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:30.790
<v 1>All right.
Uh,
dear,
uh,
bald as Billy Gunn,</v>

734
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:35.350
uh,
regarding your caller.

735
00:43:35.351 --> 00:43:38.920
Who needs advice on getting his girlfriend to shave off body here.
Okay,

736
00:43:38.921 --> 00:43:41.260
here we go.
I would like to tell,

737
00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.260
tell him to be careful what he wishes for.

738
00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:48.250
I had a girlfriend with really hairy arms and because of it she had very low

739
00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:50.500
self esteem.
Once we got to college,

740
00:43:50.501 --> 00:43:54.910
her friends took her to a beauty salon and she had her arm hair waxed.

741
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.640
Shortly after she read,

742
00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:01.540
she started to receive a lot of new male attention and pretty soon had little

743
00:44:01.541 --> 00:44:02.560
time from me.

744
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.480
Shortly after she told me she needed to talk though.
Jesus.
Yeah,

745
00:44:07.481 --> 00:44:11.710
she moved up in the draft.
She had a good combine.
Um,

746
00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:15.520
she told me she didn't want to limit her options in college.
Good for her.

747
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:20.090
He goes,
I was devastated.
I told her that since I found her attracted,

748
00:44:20.091 --> 00:44:24.670
when nobody else did that,
that should count for something.
Um,

749
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:30.880
she replied with,
we all make mistakes and walked out cheeses.

750
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:35.250
Anyways,
consider your moves carefully before doing something brash.

751
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:39.780
Thanks for the sub par podcast and go fuck yourself.
Ps,

752
00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.420
take it easy on guys writing to you for solutions.

753
00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:44.100
They are obviously at rock bottom.

754
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.580
If they are willing to take advice from a dyslexic freckled con Jesus.

755
00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:51.720
This guy took two shots at me.
Um,

756
00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:58.140
um,
uh,
you know,
that's fucking brutal.
And that's,
once again,

757
00:44:58.141 --> 00:45:01.620
that is something where,
where it,

758
00:45:01.621 --> 00:45:05.310
when it was going the other way,
women would be like,
that's brutal.

759
00:45:05.311 --> 00:45:09.870
But then if they read this same fucking story and as much as they dumped you,

760
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.170
she dumped you when you accepted her for who you were,

761
00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.730
<v 6>they would all be like,
that's right.</v>

762
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:20.640
<v 1>Go girl.
You go get what the fuck you want life.
Um,</v>

763
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.510
dude,
that's kind of fucking funny.

764
00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:32.190
I mean,
does that fuck with your self esteem at all?
I think it did.

765
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:35.880
I think that's why you gave me shit.
Not once,
but twice.
At the end of it.

766
00:45:35.881 --> 00:45:39.240
I think he got a little bit of anger,
which I would have had anger too.

767
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:46.380
Jesus Christ.
You know what's funny about that is like she,

768
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.750
if she keeps fucking doing it in enough time,

769
00:45:48.751 --> 00:45:52.410
goes by the next guy who dates or is going to have no idea that that's part of

770
00:45:52.411 --> 00:45:53.580
her fucking genetics.

771
00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.760
And then he's going to have a little hairy baby can be like,

772
00:45:56.761 --> 00:46:00.030
where the fuck did this come from?
She's be like,
ah,
you know,
I don't know.

773
00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:05.860
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

774
00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.560
<v 1>Fucking baby coming out looking like Robin Williams arms.</v>

775
00:46:08.561 --> 00:46:12.730
Remember his fucking furry arms rest his soul.
Um,

776
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.650
oh my God,
that's fucking
everything.

777
00:46:17.651 --> 00:46:20.140
Anything that happens to a guy just,
it just ends up being funny.

778
00:46:20.141 --> 00:46:22.300
I Dunno what it is.
Everything that happens to a woman is tragic,

779
00:46:22.301 --> 00:46:25.120
but just when shit happens to guys,
it's fucking funny.
What are you going to do?

780
00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:28.270
You know what you're going to do buddy?
You go to the fucking gym,
right?

781
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:32.090
You go to the gym and just go,
you know,
just start hitting,
not at tit,

782
00:46:32.091 --> 00:46:36.880
non shit way out of your fucking league.
You know,
do it.

783
00:46:36.881 --> 00:46:39.910
Do it for yourself,
man.
She's reaching for the fucking stars.

784
00:46:39.911 --> 00:46:44.680
So should you take that as an inspiration and,
uh,
you know,

785
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:49.930
God helped the next fucking guy.
She gets with Jesus fucking Christ.
And then,

786
00:46:49.931 --> 00:46:52.900
you know,
some the whole time she walks this earth,

787
00:46:52.901 --> 00:46:55.930
she has to live with that secret.
You know,
cause I'll tell you,

788
00:46:55.931 --> 00:46:59.620
there's no fucking way she's telling the next guy that that's what's going on.

789
00:46:59.621 --> 00:47:03.100
If that held her back.
Right.
And you know,

790
00:47:03.101 --> 00:47:07.300
when she walks around and hangs out with all these other fucking beautiful women

791
00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:11.320
now in her beautiful people circle and they have like fucking no hair on their

792
00:47:11.321 --> 00:47:14.530
arms,
there's going to be something in the back of her head,
you know,

793
00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:18.430
and one day she'll have too many whites,
infant Dales,
and she'll just say to her,

794
00:47:18.431 --> 00:47:19.420
fucking boyfriend,

795
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:20.423
<v 6>no,
did you go?</v>

796
00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.510
<v 1>Maybe she won't.
Maybe she won't.
And then someday they have the hairy baby,</v>

797
00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:27.570
the old h base,
the dreaded hairy baby.

798
00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:31.640
I can't come into work today.
Oh,
it's a matter.
Uh,

799
00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:35.960
my wife gave birth to a heavy baby.
Yeah,
dude,
it's fucking ridiculous.

800
00:47:35.961 --> 00:47:38.270
I thought it was,
I thought it was a little gorilla.

801
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.493
<v 7>Oh,</v>

802
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.880
<v 1>turns out she had fucking hair all over.
She just got waxed.
All right,</v>

803
00:47:48.881 --> 00:47:53.240
dear red,
red Sonja.
I don't know what that means.
I hope I said Sonjay.

804
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.910
S O n.
J a.
Um,
should I look that one up?

805
00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.990
I mean,
if it's an insult,
I got to see what it is I want to share on the left.

806
00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:04.270
Other than the fact I can't pronounce it or know what it is.

807
00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:08.200
Red Sonja,
what is red?

808
00:48:08.201 --> 00:48:13.201
Sonja Red Sonja in 1985 is a vengeful woman sets out to achieve a magic orb with

809
00:48:15.371 --> 00:48:17.110
an er.
I got to see images of this.

810
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:19.783
<v 0>Okay.</v>

811
00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:24.330
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
She's fucking smoking hot.
Um,
I don't know what that means,</v>

812
00:48:24.331 --> 00:48:26.360
but anyways,
dear red Sonja,
um,

813
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:30.420
heard the email from the guy with the hairy Brazilian girls is another one.

814
00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:32.610
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

815
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:36.510
<v 1>this is another one.
There's a lot of hairy ladies.
Um,</v>

816
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:40.020
I have a suggestion for the other guys in similar situations.

817
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:41.803
<v 0>Uh,</v>

818
00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:44.900
<v 1>have bill burr address it for you.</v>

819
00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:48.890
Listen to the podcast over the speakers when your girl is home.
That way,

820
00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:53.450
you'll plant a seed in her brain and hopefully get her to shave with an wax

821
00:48:53.451 --> 00:48:55.910
without even addressing it yourself.
Oh,

822
00:48:55.911 --> 00:49:00.140
so play that fucking part of the podcast when they're around.

823
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:03.920
Uh,
you know what?
Women are way more complex than that.

824
00:49:03.921 --> 00:49:07.540
That's a fucking decent idea and uh,

825
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:10.720
cause what's going to happen and show if she self conscious about that,

826
00:49:10.721 --> 00:49:14.560
if the light goes off,
she's going to be like,
that's first.
She'll be like,

827
00:49:14.561 --> 00:49:17.350
that's stupid,
Eh,
that guy shouldn't have blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

828
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:19.580
And then about a half hour of that bull shit,

829
00:49:19.581 --> 00:49:23.470
she'll finally come around to saying like,
do you think there's like,

830
00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:28.640
I know I'm a little more hairier than most girls.
Does it bother you?

831
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:30.380
It's still going to come back to you.

832
00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:34.910
If women wear that fucking easy to deal with emotionally,

833
00:49:34.911 --> 00:49:37.070
we wouldn't die eight years before them.

834
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:40.100
There's no fucking way it would be that easy.

835
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:42.740
Like they're just going to listen to the podcast and they just going to click.

836
00:49:42.741 --> 00:49:45.620
It'd be like,
Oh wow,
maybe I should wax.

837
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:50.030
I'm going to do that and not have a fucking four hour un meeting with my fucking

838
00:49:50.031 --> 00:49:52.130
boyfriend.
Um,
anyways,
he said,

839
00:49:52.131 --> 00:49:55.760
I've done the same thing in the past with great success.
Okay,
maybe I'm wrong.

840
00:49:55.790 --> 00:50:00.650
Wait a minute.
Wait A,
here's the replay going over to the replay booth.

841
00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:05.660
Uh,
I happen to listen to an episode.
He said,

842
00:50:05.661 --> 00:50:09.920
I happened in quotes to listen to an episode about lip hair when we were
driving.

843
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:14.090
Three days later,
mustache was gone.
Try it.

844
00:50:14.091 --> 00:50:18.770
It just might work.
Holy Shit.
All right,
well fuck it.

845
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:21.500
Give it a shot.
I stand corrected.
I Apologize Sir.

846
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:27.140
I Paulista apologize.
Jesus Christ.
I just pictured the,

847
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:33.200
the referee coming back saying no goal,
but he actually came back,

848
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:34.340
said the goal was allowed.

849
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:38.510
You lost sight of the puck and the mustache still left.
It's incredible.

850
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:43.280
All right.
All the best from Sweden.
Okay.
What am I up to here?

851
00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:47.780
50 fucking minutes.
All right.
Okay.

852
00:50:47.781 --> 00:50:52.100
Career crossroads.
Hey Billy.
Fuck face.
I like tech guy.
He just,

853
00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.110
he didn't try to be creative.
He just went right for it.

854
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:59.990
I am a 17 year old high school senior.
Going to into college,

855
00:50:59.991 --> 00:51:04.220
studying prelaw and ever since I was young,
I wanted to go into the military.

856
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.900
My father owns a medical compliance company and his promised me a job after

857
00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:13.780
college.
Should I get a law degree?
However he was,
Archie says Christ.

858
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.620
You know what?
I just realized I got to do something.
Hang on.

859
00:51:15.621 --> 00:51:16.550
I got to start this fucker.

860
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.730
I'm going to hit pause and I got to start this fucking question over again.

861
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:23.210
I got to unlock the door here.
Hang on.
All right,
I'm back.

862
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:24.680
I didn't need to unlock the door.

863
00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:27.290
She had a Keith for some reason I think she had a keys.
Um,

864
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.260
and she's the lovely knee is going to come on hopefully in a minute and dress

865
00:51:30.261 --> 00:51:34.250
the fucking,
the growing controversy of they Harry girlfriend.

866
00:51:34.251 --> 00:51:38.840
How do you tell her?
All right,
so here we go.
Hey Billy.
Hey Billy.

867
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.440
Fuckface.
Uh,
I am a 17 year old high school senior,

868
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:47.060
going into college studying prelaw.
And ever since I was young,

869
00:51:47.061 --> 00:51:51.140
I wanted to go into the military.
Um,

870
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:56.330
my father owns a medical compliance company,
has promised me a job after college.

871
00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:57.650
Should I get a law degree?

872
00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:02.210
Why would you get a law degree and then working in a medical compliance company?

873
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.660
Oh,
medical.
I thought I was thinking like they supplied like appliances,

874
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:09.050
like he was selling like fucking dental drills and shit.
However,

875
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:13.130
he has recently talked about selling the company and retiring as he is nearing

876
00:52:13.131 --> 00:52:17.690
70.
Uh,
and not getting any younger.
My question is this,

877
00:52:17.691 --> 00:52:18.800
after I finished college,

878
00:52:18.801 --> 00:52:22.400
should I enlist in the military something that I've wanted as long as I can

879
00:52:22.401 --> 00:52:24.710
remember or should I stick with the safer option?

880
00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:29.980
Never choose safe taking over my father's business slash securing a safe

881
00:52:31.701 --> 00:52:34.160
lifelong career.
Now do that.

882
00:52:34.161 --> 00:52:38.480
That is a recipe for what if,
um,

883
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:43.580
fuck that dude.
You're young.
You don't have any kids.
Just risk,
risk,
risk,

884
00:52:43.581 --> 00:52:48.230
risk,
risk.
I'm not saying fucking jump off a bridge here.
I'm just saying,
yeah,

885
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:53.240
go big.
You go big when you're young.
You know she'd never go out with me.

886
00:52:53.241 --> 00:52:57.830
Fucking ask her out.
Who gives a fuck?
Right?
Oh my God,
I can't.

887
00:52:57.831 --> 00:53:01.730
I can't try to do that.
That's a one in a zillion chance.
Just go fucking do it.

888
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:07.040
Listen to how I read out loud,
how fucking horrific I am,

889
00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:12.220
and I've been tremendously successful telling shit jokes now if I can do it,

890
00:53:12.351 --> 00:53:15.920
believe me,
anybody can do it.
And you can too.
If that's what you want to do,

891
00:53:15.921 --> 00:53:19.340
you should definitely do it.
Um,
anyways,
he said,

892
00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:22.520
I'm worried that during my absence in the military,

893
00:53:22.521 --> 00:53:27.060
there's a strong possibility my father will say,
screw it and sell the business.

894
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.100
I'm at a loss because on one hand,

895
00:53:29.101 --> 00:53:32.460
I don't want to sit at a desk 10 years from now thinking about what could have

896
00:53:32.461 --> 00:53:35.580
been a great experience in the military.
But on the other hand,

897
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:40.320
I don't want to lose a job at my fault at my fathers and be stuck at a soul

898
00:53:40.321 --> 00:53:45.321
sucking law firm for 30 years in a tiny cubicle working to make someone else's

899
00:53:45.481 --> 00:53:46.380
dream come true.

900
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:49.800
I'm really at a crossroads here and I don't want to make the wrong choice that

901
00:53:49.801 --> 00:53:52.690
could potentially fuck me over big time.
Uh,

902
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:55.410
what would you do if you are my shoes?
Thank you.
And Go fuck yourself.

903
00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:58.140
I would go into the military,
I'd finish your law degree.

904
00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:00.900
That's what you want to do.
I would go into the military,

905
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:02.940
joined the branch that you wanted to.

906
00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:07.320
I would fucking crush it in the military and then when I come out I would be

907
00:54:07.321 --> 00:54:11.100
such a,
you know,
I would attack being a lawyer at the same,

908
00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:12.400
<v 0>yeah,</v>

909
00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:16.300
<v 1>the same attitude.
Why do you feel like you're going to be stuck in a tiny,</v>

910
00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:18.790
tiny cubicle?
Why wouldn't you move up and become partner?

911
00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:22.990
You need to dream bigger dreams.
Dude.
This whole thing of like,
you know,

912
00:54:22.991 --> 00:54:26.170
the only way you're going to be successful in the business world is if you take

913
00:54:26.171 --> 00:54:29.680
it job for your dad.
Fuck that dude.
If you go the other route,

914
00:54:29.681 --> 00:54:32.740
you become a self made man.
And when you become a self made man,

915
00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:37.030
you get a belief and a confidence in yourself and um,

916
00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:38.210
<v 0>okay.</v>

917
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:42.770
<v 1>You don't worry.
Like you're 17 you're already,
you're already worrying.</v>

918
00:54:42.771 --> 00:54:45.140
Fuck that.
You got your whole life ahead of you.

919
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:50.150
I would go out and do everything that you want to do.
And then one day,

920
00:54:50.151 --> 00:54:54.470
all 20 years goes by and all of a sudden you're like,
Holy Shit,

921
00:54:54.471 --> 00:54:56.810
I work for myself.
I'm making great money.

922
00:54:57.290 --> 00:55:01.580
I can go to the movies whenever I want to.
I can take a vacation,
you know?

923
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:03.140
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

924
00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.320
<v 1>I could talk shit on a podcast like it.</v>

925
00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:09.470
It just completely opens the world,
opens up for you.
But you know,

926
00:55:09.471 --> 00:55:12.710
if he'd go the safe route,
you know,
there's that,

927
00:55:12.711 --> 00:55:16.760
there's that does that fucking nine,
that haunting voice in the back he had,

928
00:55:16.761 --> 00:55:20.380
what if I did this?
What if I did that?
You start sleeping at night.
All right.

929
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:23.530
All right.
All right.
Fucking thrashing and Shit.
Um,

930
00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.170
I think you're going to do great in the military and I think you'd do great as a

931
00:55:27.171 --> 00:55:30.890
lawyer and that's what you should be thinking.
You know,
that's it.

932
00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.780
And you're going to meet some fucking beautiful woman in shoe.

933
00:55:34.781 --> 00:55:36.990
You'd get married or whatever.
Whatever the fuck is you want to do.

934
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.730
Just think positive thoughts and a,

935
00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.890
surround yourself with people that feel that way.

936
00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:45.820
And if you have a friend that sees you start to do well and you feel them

937
00:55:45.821 --> 00:55:48.160
starting to become negative,
address it.

938
00:55:48.161 --> 00:55:50.290
And if they don't fucking clean up this shit,

939
00:55:50.291 --> 00:55:53.590
you cut them out of your life because those people will bring you down.

940
00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.750
Stay here at the townie bar with the old football jacket on.

941
00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:01.510
Fuck that.
All right.
Good luck to you,
sir.
All right.

942
00:56:01.511 --> 00:56:05.890
Dating an older lady and all the broad.
Hey Billy boy.

943
00:56:05.891 --> 00:56:10.690
Fuck not uh,
Ben in a serious relationship with an older woman.

944
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:15.790
She is fantastic.
Cooks for me,
rubs my feet,
gives me sponge baths.
Jen,

945
00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:20.290
just an absolute gem.
She has a great job,
makes a boat load of,

946
00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:24.280
uh,
cash,
I guess.
S Carol,

947
00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:27.070
E.
S.
C.
A.
R.
O.
L.
E.
I don't want to say that word.

948
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:30.700
And I also do very well for myself.
Money is not an issue.

949
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:34.150
I deeply care for her and love her.
I'm 30 and she is 45,

950
00:56:34.151 --> 00:56:37.570
but she looks better than most girls my age.
When we first met,

951
00:56:37.571 --> 00:56:41.050
I thought she was 32.
So that's what initially attracted me to her.

952
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:46.230
She's fucking slamming hot and a great purse and has a great personality.

953
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:50.260
We can joke around and I can say disturbing things to her and she just laughs.

954
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.860
Real class act type of broad.
Uh,

955
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:57.280
she was an 18 year old daughter.
She has an 18 year old daughter,

956
00:56:57.281 --> 00:56:59.920
but as far as I'm concerned,
I don't really give a flying fuck.

957
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:04.840
My family had some opinions and we're like,
she's too old,
blah blah blah.

958
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:07.090
Fuck them.
They have miserable relationships.

959
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:12.220
She makes me a better person and I feel good.
Your thoughts,
uh,
your thoughts,

960
00:57:12.221 --> 00:57:16.100
Billy Little sack Jesus Christ.
Fucking everybody.

961
00:57:16.101 --> 00:57:19.510
They gave me the old fucking one,
two there.
Um,

962
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:24.440
well dude,
you sound like you happy.
That's what the fuck you want.
The what?

963
00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:25.520
There's nothing wrong with it.

964
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.910
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

965
00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:30.510
<v 1>that's what you want.
There's nothing fucking wrong with it.
She makes you happy.</v>

966
00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:33.660
Yeah,
absolutely.
Why would you leave?
You know,

967
00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:36.630
I don't know if you want to have kids that,
that would be a fucking issue.

968
00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:37.891
You know,

969
00:57:37.891 --> 00:57:41.340
at that point you've freezer fucking eggs and you jerk off into something.

970
00:57:41.341 --> 00:57:45.010
I don't know how it works.
I don't pretend to be a doctor.
Um,

971
00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:49.240
I'll fuck you know what?
I didn't read the other God damn
you.

972
00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:54.040
Other advertisements.
All right,
let me just knock out these last
really quickly.

973
00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.320
Let's see how fast I can read these.
All right,

974
00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.920
this is going to be a fucking train wreck.
Simple faith.

975
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:02.710
I'm not gonna read these first simple faith.
Everybody.

976
00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:06.130
Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day.

977
00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:09.790
And the home security industry wants you to believe it's your only option.

978
00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:13.840
They've got hoards of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of

979
00:58:13.841 --> 00:58:15.190
their longterm contracts.

980
00:58:15.191 --> 00:58:19.420
She gets stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.

981
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:22.330
It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands,

982
00:58:22.331 --> 00:58:26.230
but there's a better way to protect your home with simple faith.
Home Security.

983
00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:31.330
Simple faith has no contracts.
None.
You'll get award winning 24,

984
00:58:31.331 --> 00:58:35.440
seven protection named best in the industry.
Uh,

985
00:58:35.441 --> 00:58:38.990
security professionals watching,
ready to instantly send the purple,
uh,

986

Hang on,
let me hit plus.
All right,
the lovely knee.

1044
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.650
<v 4>Everybody.
Hi,
how are you?
I'm great,
thanks.
Okay,
let's get right down to,
okay.</v>

1045
01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:29.160
All right.
This guy,
he's dating this woman.
She thinks she's beautiful,

1046
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:34.110
but she's Harry this thing again.
Well,
yeah,

1047
01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:37.680
but I never,
you never talked to about,
we never got a female's advice on this.

1048
01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:40.950
I thought we did.
You talked about it.
Yeah,

1049
01:02:40.951 --> 01:02:45.951
I remember I said like either like he sorta get something wax and they go

1050
01:02:46.321 --> 01:02:48.630
together and it's funny or he just like gets over it.

1051
01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:53.850
You said that on the podcast or did we talk about that on our own?

1052
01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:58.620
Not on the podcast.
And you got all mad at me cause I was like if she is not,

1053
01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:01.800
what do you have against talking into the mic?
I don't know.

1054
01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:03.450
You just sit there and go.
Like I said,
I have is,

1055
01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:08.910
I know people tweeted me the last time was like I can't hear you so I you've

1056
01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:13.440
told me
just have it follow your,
your,
your mouth.

1057
01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:18.390
Okay.
But because the thing is I feel like if a microphone is anywhere near me,

1058
01:03:18.391 --> 01:03:22.620
it's going to microphone my voice amplified.

1059
01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.030
Wow.
So I don't need,

1060
01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:30.630
it's very rare that someone makes me look like the smart one.

1061
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:33.700
Microphone.
My voice.
So,
um,

1062
01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.110
well what you have to know about it but microphones,

1063
01:03:37.111 --> 01:03:39.290
each one of them they have,

1064
01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:43.620
there's ones that are designed to pick up three 60.
There's ones that are like,

1065
01:03:43.621 --> 01:03:47.960
these ones are like directly on.
Okay.
That's directly on that.

1066
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.390
The reason for that is if there's other background noise that you don't want to

1067
01:03:51.391 --> 01:03:52.051
pick that up.

1068
01:03:52.051 --> 01:03:54.780
There's other microphones design where you want to hear the whole room.

1069
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.450
These are directly on,
so you got to speak into it.

1070
01:03:57.451 --> 01:04:00.440
But this is not what we're talking about.
Okay.
Sorry.
All right,
so somebody,

1071
01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:05.550
somebody's got this and she's got like a like hair on her lower back.

1072
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:08.660
Yeah.
Like right with a tramp stamp would be,
she was like,

1073
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:11.830
she could have a tramp stamp and he wouldn't know cause it's,

1074
01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:16.410
there's a whole thicket of tear under there.
Yeah.
I thought we talked about this.

1075
01:04:16.411 --> 01:04:20.130
I thought you stopped saying that.
Okay.
I understand that.

1076
01:04:20.131 --> 01:04:21.300
You think that we talked about it.

1077
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.780
Neither one of us can remember if we did it on the podcast and not,

1078
01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:27.930
this is just bonus time.
Anyways,
so refresh our listeners.
Well,

1079
01:04:27.931 --> 01:04:32.460
my date and a woman,
she's got a fucking Afro right above her butt crack.

1080
01:04:32.461 --> 01:04:36.480
What do you say?
There's nothing wrong with an Afro.
Um,
on your head.

1081
01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.080
A booboo boo.
I think you

1082
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:45.480
answer the God damn.
This is just,
this is just,
it's a tough one.

1083
01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:48.030
How long has he been dating this person?
It.
Can he be like,

1084
01:04:48.031 --> 01:04:50.370
so what's with your little furry back over here?

1085
01:04:50.371 --> 01:04:55.290
You're like my little Chia pet in a cute way.
Like can he say it in a cute way?

1086
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:59.620
How do you say that in a cute way?
I don't know.
Oh,

1087
01:04:59.690 --> 01:05:04.410
you my little Chia pet back here?
No.

1088
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:10.050
Um,
you know what?
Maybe he could just sort of like,

1089
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:12.390
this is gonna sound really fucking weird,

1090
01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:16.590
but maybe the sort of like stroke it or whatever the thing is.

1091
01:05:16.591 --> 01:05:18.880
She'll probably like,
oh God no,
don't touch that.

1092
01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:22.320
I know there's like a hair back there.
It's so like weird.
I hate it.

1093
01:05:22.321 --> 01:05:25.480
And you can go,
why don't you get it wax?
And she might be like,
I don't know.

1094
01:05:25.481 --> 01:05:28.630
Like I'm embarrassed.
I'll go with you.
I'll whack something with you.

1095
01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:32.300
How about that?
I'll whack something.
You lack something and then boom.

1096
01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:36.860
Not a good idea.
I have an idea to,
what about when you know,

1097
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:40.780
if she's wearing like a sexy shirt so it's doesn't quite reach down to her pants

1098
01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:43.720
when she goes to get up off,
he's probably doesn't wear shirts like that.

1099
01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:47.920
When she goes to get up off the couch,
you just reach up and grab a little back,

1100
01:05:47.921 --> 01:05:49.450
can't go back down here,

1101
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:54.840
pull back lying on her stomach at the beach and he starts braiding it for her.

1102
01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:59.370
I know.
It's bad.
It's bad.
It's kind of a questionable situation.

1103
01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.960
Well this one guy was saying he was dating this woman.

1104
01:06:01.961 --> 01:06:06.340
She had like even hairy feet.
She'll like hairy toes.
Shit happens man.

1105
01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:11.350
I know,
but what the fuck me,
you got to handle that.
I mean,
ideally,

1106
01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:15.400
yes you would handle that in a perfect world,
in a perfect world.
But you know,

1107
01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:20.080
I had girlfriends for a years who had a little like just like the little shade

1108
01:06:20.081 --> 01:06:22.210
of a mustache and they just never,

1109
01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:25.660
it just never really occurred to them to wax it until like recently.

1110
01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.160
And I remember I had a friend,
I saw her,

1111
01:06:27.161 --> 01:06:29.920
I hadn't seen her in awhile and she was like,
do you notice anything different?

1112
01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.680
And she kept turning her face in a certain way and I was like,

1113
01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:36.850
you get your upper lip wax rental and yeah,
she's like,

1114
01:06:36.851 --> 01:06:38.950
I finally did it.
She's like,
I don't know.

1115
01:06:38.951 --> 01:06:42.220
I was always just intimidated to go into the place.
And she's like,

1116
01:06:42.221 --> 01:06:44.650
but I'm so glad I did.
So I fix that.
What it is.
Yeah,

1117
01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:48.250
people are self conscious and you think you'll go in there and you'll get

1118
01:06:48.251 --> 01:06:51.370
judgment by the waxing person,
but the waxing person has waxed,

1119
01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:55.750
you know Chewbacca down there so they don't care.
That's their job.

1120
01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:00.130
So it could be that she's just like a little embarrassed to go to a place and

1121
01:07:00.131 --> 01:07:02.680
have it taken off because who wants to say,
oh,

1122
01:07:02.681 --> 01:07:06.850
I have to go get my back wax today before you don't have to say that.

1123
01:07:06.851 --> 01:07:10.480
You just walk down and go,
Hey,
can you watch my back?

1124
01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:14.710
You don't even have to whisper it.
And I know you don't.
So,
oh no.

1125
01:07:14.711 --> 01:07:18.400
But if you go there to other people,
see you getting your back waxed?
No,
no,
no,
no.

1126
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:21.700
You're in a private room.
Oh,
whenever you get any kind of waxing service,

1127
01:07:21.701 --> 01:07:26.260
it's not like Steve Brill.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah,

1128
01:07:26.261 --> 01:07:29.470
so you're in a private thing,
so he just has to do it in a cute,
you know what,

1129
01:07:29.471 --> 01:07:31.930
this one asshole did what?
He goes,

1130
01:07:31.931 --> 01:07:36.850
I suggest you don't tell the woman that she's Harry.
He told the woman,

1131
01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:41.110
he broke up with her and said the reason why he was doing it was because she was

1132
01:07:41.111 --> 01:07:43.630
so hairy is that's not the way it is.

1133
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:47.290
Isn't that the meanest thing you've ever fucking mean his thing ever.

1134
01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:51.340
Are you that shallow because that's something that's easily fixable or are you

1135
01:07:51.341 --> 01:07:53.650
that fucking shallow that you break up with someone?

1136
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:58.210
It's like cause you and Harry back.
Like what a fucking asshole.
Back feet,
nose,

1137
01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:02.260
blood coming out of the nose and then the arms.
That's just,

1138
01:08:02.261 --> 01:08:05.350
that's unnecessary to say that after the fact,

1139
01:08:05.351 --> 01:08:08.350
if you love somebody and there's,
even if you don't,

1140
01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:11.740
even if you don't love somebody,
you don't do that to somebody.
That's not,

1141
01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:14.980
that's not okay.
But then so since she fucking,
he came,

1142
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:17.840
she started throwing plates and he fucking left and then came back.

1143
01:08:17.841 --> 01:08:21.980
She had dumped bleach on his clothes and stapled some condoms to the fucking

1144
01:08:21.981 --> 01:08:26.450
wall.
The usual destruction of property that for some reason to use validated.

1145
01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:30.920
Do you have,
I have never actually noticed.
Do you have back here yet?

1146
01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:35.240
But he came back here yet like cause I feel like that's something that as men

1147
01:08:35.241 --> 01:08:38.870
get older,
I have actually never not turned around.
Now I don't have back here.

1148
01:08:38.890 --> 01:08:39.723
Well let me say,

1149
01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:44.830
well Jesus Christ near your fucking sleep next to me every goddamn day.

1150
01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:48.500
Just never thought to look for that.
Now I don't have back here.
You know what?

1151
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:54.610
There is a very fine little area in the lower back tramp stamp area.

1152
01:08:55.730 --> 01:09:00.410
Not a lot.
You can barely see it cause your hair so fair.
But like,

1153
01:09:00.411 --> 01:09:01.640
no,
I don't know.

1154
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:05.510
You have a very small like yeah I got nothing back there.

1155
01:09:05.511 --> 01:09:06.890
There's nothing back there.

1156
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:11.420
I mean there's more on your chest then on the your lower very small amount.

1157
01:09:11.690 --> 01:09:12.680
But the thing is,

1158
01:09:12.681 --> 01:09:17.180
I feel like in 10 years that shit could get a little thing and 10 years I'm

1159
01:09:17.181 --> 01:09:21.380
going to be close to 60.
I mean I'd still have you accent what?

1160
01:09:21.381 --> 01:09:26.381
In 10 years when my white fucking back hair against my white back because it

1161
01:09:27.651 --> 01:09:31.450
bothers you when I wear a fucking a half shirt.
I mean what,
what it was,

1162
01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:36.590
what are we doing at that point?
That's a fair way.
Look at my lower back.

1163
01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:41.180
Let's just do,
let's just,
no you don't.
No you don't.
You don't.

1164
01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:45.440
Um,
yeah,
I try to be very familiar with your lower back.
You don't?

1165
01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:49.400
Oh yeah,
you don't,
you're not a hairy person

1166
01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:55.130
so,
but if I was Harry back there,
would you say something to me?
No,

1167
01:09:55.131 --> 01:09:56.480
I just would've broke up with you.

1168
01:09:57.050 --> 01:10:01.010
What's so you would have broken up over cause I wanted to taking the time to

1169
01:10:01.011 --> 01:10:02.120
fall in love with you.

1170
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:06.170
If you're walking around looking like fucking Burt Reynolds and playgirl.

1171
01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:12.440
Okay.
Oh,
I see it.
Photoshop coming.

1172
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.960
Oh my God.
Wait,

1173
01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.970
shout out to the m M Photoshop on sweater.
Oh my God,
Dude.

1174
01:10:19.971 --> 01:10:23.120
That one with me standing in front of the fountain.

1175
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.850
I fucking dude,

1176
01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:30.500
we were in the writers room when I saw that and I fucking laughed so hard.

1177
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:33.560
Yeah,
like one of the other writers is going like,
what?
What?

1178
01:10:33.561 --> 01:10:36.330
And I showed it to him and everyone was going like,
oh my God,
that's so mean.

1179
01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.520
I go,
this is fucking hilarious.

1180
01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:41.550
And then I love the picture of you that they found you was one.
Yeah.

1181
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:44.050
It was like when you were going out to some event,
so you look,

1182
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:47.690
that was us at the heat premiere.
Yeah,
that's what that picture was.

1183
01:10:47.691 --> 01:10:50.270
I was trying to be like fucking,
you know modest about it.

1184
01:10:50.271 --> 01:10:52.070
I didn't want to sit there and say you were at a movie premiere.

1185
01:10:52.071 --> 01:10:55.220
I said you had some big event.
You always got to be standing there.

1186
01:10:55.221 --> 01:10:57.640
You always have to fucking drop the Hollywood shit though.

1187
01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:03.050
The premiere for the cinematic film,

1188
01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:07.670
the heat where my husband had two lines.
You had more than two lines.

1189
01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:12.420
If you sneezed in that movie,
you missed me.
But now,

1190
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:17.610
but now everybody follow the m m Photoshop on Twitter.
Whoever that is,

1191
01:11:17.611 --> 01:11:20.370
man or woman is fucking hilarious.
Wait,
wait,
wait.

1192
01:11:20.371 --> 01:11:24.630
Actually have better one for the m Photoshop.
All right,
so wait,

1193
01:11:24.631 --> 01:11:26.910
where's my phone?
Because I wrote it down.

1194
01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.650
Remember you said the name of a movie and it was once again how you have just

1195
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:36.000
sort of clues from the movie and I don't remember the titles.
All right,

1196
01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:39.540
so I'm going to find it because it was definitely one of your classic ones and

1197
01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:42.390
we're not going to say what the movie is.

1198
01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:47.590
We're just going to have the MM Photoshop.
Wait,

1199
01:11:47.591 --> 01:11:50.200
let me see if I can find it.
Mock it up,

1200
01:11:50.201 --> 01:11:54.940
put it on Twitter and then everyone will be able to guess.
Hopefully.
All right,

1201
01:11:54.941 --> 01:11:59.710
so you called this movie.
I'm going to kill you on Wall Street.
They're fuck,
oh,

1202
01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:06.270
I'm going to kill it on Wall Street.
They're fuck.
Oh,
that's it.

1203
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:10.690
That was a movie.
That's a movie.
So people are going to try to guess what it is.

1204
01:12:10.691 --> 01:12:14.530
Mm,
Photoshop is going to know.
It's funny.
Days later.
Movie poster days later.

1205
01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.710
You reading that?
It now sounds like somebody else says it.
Said it,

1206
01:12:17.711 --> 01:12:22.030
and that's a terrible clue.
That's not even close.
It's sort of close.

1207
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.600
They'll figure it out.
All right,
well,

1208
01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:27.920
<v 2>okay,</v>

1209
01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.460
<v 4>it's 12 minutes past the hour here.
It's time to wrap this up cause weapon.</v>

1210
01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.860
It's passed the House passed the hour.
Wb.
You are.

1211
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:40.010
Our morning becomes eclectic.
I love her.
You listened to that.

1212
01:12:40.011 --> 01:12:42.830
You think it makes you smarter.
All right,
that's it.

1213
01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:46.660
Now it's so pretentious to be smart out Kcrw,

1214
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:50.750
so you get a variety of musical style.
Same liberal viewpoint.

1215
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:55.820
All right,
you done this,
this over.
Can I?

1216
01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:59.120
Can I go somewhere and eat my oatmeal?
You know what it is?
I just,

1217
01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:02.840
I don't like shit.
That's a hundred percent liberal or 100% conservative.

1218
01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:04.040
All right.
That's fine.

1219
01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.370
I like in the middle because both of them caused me to yell at them.

1220
01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:12.530
Bill will yell at everything.
It doesn't matter what it is.

1221
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:17.150
Not True because nothing is exactly your viewpoint.
I don't yell at you what?

1222
01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:20.960
I don't yell at the dog.
That's also not true.
I don't yell at other drivers.

1223
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:23.720
I'm courteous and polite.

1224
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:24.883
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1225
01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.780
<v 4>I don't yell at inanimate objects like my computer.</v>

1226
01:13:28.781 --> 01:13:32.290
I don't do any of those things.
Sure.
Well,
then,
all right,
then I want to know,

1227
01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:33.820
you're like a redheaded Gandhi.

1228
01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:41.520
I definitely was like Ben Kingsley's more than I look like fucking Danny,

1229
01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:46.300
Danny Bonaduce.
Alright,
that's the,
uh,
that's the podcast here for the,
uh,

1230
01:13:46.330 --> 01:13:49.410
for this Monday.
Jenny been a don't shake.

1231
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:53.620
You got a situation with Danny Bonaduce.
Dude,
we got to take them care.

1232
01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:57.400
The fucking,
all right,
that's it.
I'll talk to you Fuckos on Thursday.

1233
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:58.330
Go Fuck Yourself.
