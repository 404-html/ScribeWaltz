5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.550
I've been real good.
Been drinking the trope Coty and having the law changes.

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.490
Um,
I had a great week.
I did the bar,

7
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.930
the stuff I thought it was a two year anniversary sit,

8
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.910
three year anniversary of the goddamn comedy jam.

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.790
And a I sang for the first time,

10
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:39.960
came out dressed is Johnny paycheck and I sang that,

11
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:44.961
take this job and shove it my working hey are no more.

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.920
Um,
and then I sat in and played drums afterwards.

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.850
Played sweet child of mine for the uh,
the finale.
And uh,

14
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:54.960
you know what's funny about that song?

15
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:58.920
I never really listened to the drums once slash started playing the guitar Solo.

16
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:02.190
That's one of those guitar solo songs.
I always have to fucking row.

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.860
I can't listen to it one time through.
I always have to rewind it back,
you know,

18
00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:08.010
when we really starts slash really starts getting going.

19
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:12.480
I fucking loved that Solo and I was so listening to what he was doing.

20
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:16.320
I never really listened to all the cool drums underneath it.
Um,

21
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.150
the Great Steven Adler,
so I had a great time doing all of that shit last night.

22
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:26.070
I did a fucking benefit for the troops there and uh,

23
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.660
<v 0>okay.</v>

24
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.380
<v 1>I just had girl,
I was a fucking amazing night.
Just,
uh,
went out there.</v>

25
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.330
One of those nights you walk on stage like,
you know what?

26
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:34.710
I don't feel like doing my act.

27
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.450
And then you just start fucking talking and it works rather than you're bombing,

28
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.590
you know,

29
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.380
the nights when you don't feel like doing your act and you don't do your act and

30
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:48.150
you start bombing,
then you reluctantly go into your act.
It becomes a,
you know,

31
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.720
they get all grumpy,
the garage sitting there,
like,

32
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:55.950
what the fuck is this guy's problem came down here to laugh at.
He's a,
he's,

33
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.230
he's coming out,
he's being all fresh.
Um,
oh,
just one of those,

34
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.850
just one of those great nights.
And other than that,

35
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:06.270
I've just been stuck in a writer's room so I have no idea what the fuck is going

36
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:08.730
on in the world.
This is what this is.

37
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:10.800
This is what happens when I go into the writer's from,

38
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:15.801
I have no fucking idea what goes on in the world where I'm working on episodes

39
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:21.570
one and two.
We have our first table read tomorrow.
So wold,
uh,

40
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.900
I get a fucking,
I get to look at my lines,

41
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:29.130
make sure if I sell the joke so they get laughs so we don't have to fucking

42
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:33.600
write new jokes.
That's how it works.
Uh,
the madness has begun again.

43
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

44
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.030
<v 1>So,
um,
I can't remember what the fuck I talked about cause I already started this</v>

45
00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:42.910
podcast and I mentioned that my wife came into work today with my lovely

46
00:02:42.911 --> 00:02:47.440
daughter and everybody got to see her and it was the highlight of my day and try

47
00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:50.560
and make sure she does that more often.
You know,

48
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.630
they're only little one time I came home early and I come home a little early

49
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.510
now.
Right.
I got the whole excuse doc because I got to go home and see my baby.

50
00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:01.810
Right.
So I home and I,
she's got this little chair,
you know,

51
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:06.240
that just like fucking clamps onto the table and uh,

52
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.840
she sits at that thing and she just sat there talking to me like,

53
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:14.830
how do you know,
trying to talk to me is,
I had dinner in my,

54
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:17.080
a lovely wife was downstairs sleeping.

55
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.440
We just basically had our first dinner date with self.
It was so cool.

56
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.710
You remember that amazes me.
Is she like cracks herself up.

57
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.670
She can't speak a word of any language and so,

58
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.190
but she sits there and she thinks about stuff and she just kind of chuckles,

59
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.170
sit there going,
ha ha ha.
Don't just do you just be by herself.
And I'm just,

60
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.960
it kills me.
I'm like,
what is she thinking about?

61
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.800
<v 3>Okay.</v>

62
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.620
<v 1>Like to make yourself laugh,
do got it,</v>

63
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.030
but think about something that's fucked up,

64
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.090
which means you got to have a knowledge of something that's like,

65
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.580
you know how things should be.

66
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.190
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.960
<v 1>Like when somebody comes walking in the room,</v>

68
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:57.250
they're just supposed to walk into the room.

69
00:03:57.251 --> 00:04:00.100
They're not supposed to bumped ahead of fall on their ass.
Like,

70
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:04.780
you know what's normal?
I kind of share like what's her idea?
Normal?
I don't know.

71
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.370
I Dunno.
This is like one of these things like,

72
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.170
you know when you watch like the uh,

73
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.890
one of those animal programs and they start telling you what the fucking ant,

74
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.130
what the animal's thinking.
He just,
you just want to be like,

75
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:19.750
how in God's name would you know that?

76
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.120
<v 3>Okay,</v>

77
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.590
<v 1>you know when the shark does this,
it's actually a,</v>

78
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:28.060
it's actually afraid because it's blah,
blah,
blah.
They do this when they,

79
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.040
when they fucking make this noise with their mouth,
it's actually a,

80
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.750
this is like a mating call and say,
how did you figure that out?

81
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.350
How did you figure that out?
Like you follow this thing around the fucking woods.

82
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.300
It made that noise and then another bird showed up and they started fucking,

83
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:47.610
these are like birds.
Like how did you figure that out?

84
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.810
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

85
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.200
<v 1>How do you keep,
you ever try to keep up with a bird?
I've never tried that.</v>

86
00:04:52.201 --> 00:04:53.220
That's gotta be hard as hell.

87
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.320
How many fucking people are in the woods?

88
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.710
Fucking bird gets like performance anxiety,

89
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.750
you know,
you think you can keep fucking,

90
00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:10.770
if you looked out the window and there was like 10 birds with cameras looking at

91
00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:11.604
you.

92
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.073
<v 3>Okay.</v>

93
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.130
<v 1>Writing Shit down and everything,
you'd be like,
what the fuck's with these birds?</v>

94
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.350
Then you kind of forget what you were doing.

95
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.980
I've never understood how they do that.

96
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.170
Like how big the jungle is,
all of that shit.
You had the cameras set up.

97
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.460
<v 3>Okay</v>

98
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.120
<v 1>and you were able to capture this fucking thing killing this other animal.</v>

99
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.850
Well they could be a following,
like a fucking unbelievably deadly snake.

100
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.370
They're following it through the forest

101
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.150
and then they'll fucking be on the other side of the log and it's,

102
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.420
it's coming over the top.
It's like is that,
is that fucking snake in the union?

103
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.290
It looked like it went back to one when you reset and action and it's like,
yeah,

104
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.420
sneak comes like on comes over.
The bucket thing.

105
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.570
I swear to God,
I watched one one time,
I'm telling you,

106
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.880
they set this fucking mouse up.

107
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.010
The one day they had footage of the mouse.
It's in the fucking woods.

108
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.560
Or I guess if it's a poisonous snake,

109
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:15.530
it's gotta be the jungle right at that point,
I don't know the forest.

110
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.040
All right.
In this fucking mouse is like freaking out in this snake,

111
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.400
like a rattle snake is on.
Like it's,
you know,
it's on its path.

112
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:30.200
It's chasing this thing.
So the fucking thing goes down this hole.
This mouse.

113
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.130
Okay.
And then they showed the snake,
you know,

114
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:39.080
coming over the log and then it goes down the same fucking hole and then all of

115
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:41.720
a sudden I'm in the hole with the mouse.

116
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.840
Like there was a camera down that whole like,
how the fuck,
how the fuck did it,

117
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.490
did you know to put the camera down there?
Right.

118
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.790
And then the mouse is down there and you see the thing freaking out.
Like,

119
00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:58.640
you know,
like some fucking set up man.
Right.

120
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:00.430
And the fucking snakes coming down.

121
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.440
It's like Joe Pesci when he thinks he's getting made,
he walks,
ah,
no,
Bam.

122
00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:08.470
That was it.
The snake came in and fucking killed the mouse.

123
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.700
And I remember just feeling,
I just was sitting there watching it going like,

124
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:16.970
did I just watch a fucking murder?
Did that thing that was like a hit.

125
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.960
That wasn't just some random shit that they kind of caught like,
you know,

126
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:23.450
when they see like Chivas chasing down some fucking thing,

127
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.370
I dunno.
I think they ought to investigate that one.

128
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.860
That was clearly a,
uh,

129
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.440
that was something that's definitely worthy of an investigation.
A suspicious,

130
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.990
you know,
you know,
when somebody dies and they just say,
he'd say,
yeah,

131
00:07:40.991 --> 00:07:44.820
seem like natural causes.
What's that other word they use?
I don't fucking know.

132
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.080
I,
uh,
I always root for Anna,
whatever,
animals dying.

133
00:07:49.081 --> 00:07:52.830
And there's a lot of animals that I don't like cause it fucking scary.

134
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.540
You know,
when you watch like,
uh,
one of those big cats,

135
00:07:57.541 --> 00:07:59.310
which I love those fucking things.
When you watch him,

136
00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:02.430
you know when you watched him take it down,
one of those bulls,

137
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.920
it's like I'm all for the fucking bull,
like Rutan the thing on.

138
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.030
Then all of a sudden it kicks one of the lines in the face or it stabs him with

139
00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:16.830
the horn and then the lion limps off.
Done.
I feel bad for the line.
Oh my God,

140
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.820
fuck man.
I had the lines going to die.
Now

141
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.773
<v 0>you know,</v>

142
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.430
<v 1>I don't like hyenas.
I fucking hate monkeys.</v>

143
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.130
I like gorillas.
I don't like monkeys.

144
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.870
I definitely don't like chimpanzees and I'm definitely going to go see planet of

145
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:37.370
the apes and I'm rooting for the humans,
sponges.
I know that,
you know,
if we win,

146
00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:40.940
we're going to continue to cause global warming and throw TV sets into the
ocean.

147
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:47.310
I just a,
I don't like those fucking ticks like that first planet of the apes,

148
00:08:47.311 --> 00:08:48.570
this latest reboot of it.

149
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.470
When the things walking down the street and had like pants on and the guys like

150
00:08:52.471 --> 00:08:53.610
Holden,
it's fucking,

151
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.373
<v 0>and</v>

152
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.400
<v 1>yeah,
like the,</v>

153
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.900
and I always go to the planet of the apes movies and we just exchange looks the

154
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:03.600
entire fucking time just looking at each other like this is just fucking,

155
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.140
this is so fucking weird is so fucking weird.

156
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:11.080
They're so close to what we are,
you know,

157
00:09:11.081 --> 00:09:13.900
but they can like rip your face off and they just don't give a shit.

158
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:15.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

159
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.550
<v 1>I'm actually wondering if said biting.
Yah,
I dunno.
I don't like fucking monkeys.</v>

160
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.390
I respect him and uh,
but I could never live in,
in a,

161
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:27.480
in a country with it just out in the wild

162
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.690
like that,
like party at the embassy,

163
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:34.380
like those things like in India or some shit and some guy will be walking down

164
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:39.240
the street and this fucking random monkey will just run up behind him and give

165
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:39.781
him like a,

166
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:43.320
the monkey version of a fucking flying dropkick and the guy does like a face

167
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:46.990
plant and the monkey takes off like laughing at them.
Like,
I,

168
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.040
I,
I wouldn't be able to handle that.
I'd be like,

169
00:09:51.041 --> 00:09:54.670
I'm gonna fucking kill that thing.
Not Kill it,
kill it.
Because then I feel bad,

170
00:09:54.671 --> 00:09:56.920
but I'm going to throw a fucking rock at it,

171
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:59.463
<v 0>right</v>

172
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.360
<v 1>from walking down some fucking God forsaken road and a monkey knocks me over and</v>

173
00:10:05.361 --> 00:10:09.710
then it goes up the fucking train.
It's jumping up and down,
all proud of itself.

174
00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.930
I would,
I would love to think that,
you know,

175
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.730
for all the Peta people listening that I would be mature enough to not do

176
00:10:18.731 --> 00:10:21.250
something,
but uh,
I would have to do something

177
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.560
if I lived in a country that had fucking just monkeys running around.

178
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.900
I would have,
like,
I would,
you know what I would do,

179
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.900
I would design like a portable firehose,

180
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.263
<v 0>right?</v>

181
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:36.361
<v 1>You know,</v>

182
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:40.800
with that level of fucking velocity and after they fucking did whatever they
did,

183
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:42.840
throw their poo at me or whatever the fuck they did,

184
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:44.610
I would just blast them right out of the trees.

185
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.020
You know,
those little ones,

186
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.870
there was fucking chimpanzees.
You can't have him.
Can't have it.

187
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.550
It's amazing how we just found out now that chimpanzees can like rip your face

188
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:05.610
off.
You know,

189
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.580
like when they go to kill another chimpanzee,

190
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:12.890
they like to rip their balls right off,
twist their foot off and fucking ripped.

191
00:11:12.891 --> 00:11:15.810
If faith,
they do all this fucking crazy shit,

192
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.240
then they get all amped up afterwards.

193
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:20.370
All the other apes after they fucking killed that one,

194
00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:24.000
that jumping around all talking shit about what the fuck they just did.

195
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.090
Um,
there's no fucking way,

196
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.930
there's no fucking way I could live in a country that had that type of shit I

197
00:11:31.931 --> 00:11:33.250
went to,
I would be fucking pack.

198
00:11:33.251 --> 00:11:37.790
And the entire time you don't like if my neighbor ever just like for the years,

199
00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:41.810
like in Hollywood,
like the chimpanzee was,
was so fucking castable.

200
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.840
And now that I've actually gotten to a writer's room and,
and,

201
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.640
and I talked to these guys about different shoots.
Everybody has a monkey story.

202
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.210
Everybody has a fucking monkey where it's like,
ah,
man,
you know,

203
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.960
can't do it,
man.
Can't do it.
I won't work with them.
I won't work with them.

204
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.040
And I'm like,
really?
And they go,
why?
What happens to the guy,
you know what,

205
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:05.980
this is what the fuck happens.
Okay,
you do,
you know,

206
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.720
you've got a finite amount of time.

207
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.900
The monkey's going to do kind of what you wanted to do and then it's going to

208
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:14.440
get to a fucking point with a monkeys.
Just going to go fucking ape shit,

209
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.360
no pun intended.
And it's just going to do what?

210
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:20.230
It's going to start flying around the fucking set and it's something somebody's

211
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:24.730
going to get jumped.
You know,
I worked with a guy,

212
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:26.770
he got fucking attacked by a monkey on a set.

213
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:33.380
There's no fucking way.
There is no fucking way.

214
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.820
I'm a long time ago we did the,
uh,
when I did the opiate Anthony Show,

215
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.270
right.
Which I'm hoping,

216
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:45.940
you know now that opie schedules all freed up.
Now I'm hoping that maybe,

217
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.740
you know,
guns and roses can get back together.
Huh?
Who knows?

218
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.680
Stranger things have happened.
Um,

219
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.710
I was on the opiate Anthony show and somebody brought in,
it was,
uh,

220
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:00.990
I think it was a,

221
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.990
a baby tiger and the thing was fucking adorable,

222
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.430
but I'll tell you right now,
it was like the size.

223
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.180
It was between a house cat in a bobcat.

224
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.240
As far as the size it was.
No,

225
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:19.840
I mean it was kind of like the size of a house cast,
but it's was fucking jacked,

226
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.800
you know,
it was,

227
00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:28.060
we'd like a baby bear because it's going to turn into this three,
four,
five,

228
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:32.170
600 pound fucking thing when it's a baby.
It's still like,
dude,

229
00:13:32.171 --> 00:13:34.930
that thing could fuck me up there.

230
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:39.730
Freddy Kruger pause that those bears have.
So they got this fucking,

231
00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:43.480
uh,
they bring in this baby tiger.
It's the white one,
right?

232
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.860
The bill burr version of the tiger.
And they bring it in.

233
00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:52.300
I remember and think it going on out.
And then he goes,
baby animals are adorable.

234
00:13:52.301 --> 00:13:53.440
Like he fucking loves him.

235
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:59.200
And the fucking thing was the god damn tiger was not in a good mood and it was

236
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:02.860
at going,
wow.
Wow,
wow.
I don't like this baby.

237
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:07.210
Little fucking roaring.
So they go,

238
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:10.630
do you want to hold that thing?
And I was like,
no.
I mean,
yeah,

239
00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:12.700
if you declawed and you're fucking duct tape,

240
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:15.610
it's fucking cute little mouth shut.
Yeah.
Maybe then

241
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.620
maybe then I would fuck with it.
You know.

242
00:14:18.621 --> 00:14:21.650
Could you put some boxing gloves on and all four of its paws?
I,
yeah.

243
00:14:21.651 --> 00:14:26.060
Then I would do it
then I would do it,
but I,
I just,
you know,

244
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.840
I've gotten scratched by a house cat.
It fucking kills.
That hurts.

245
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.040
That thing with his baby lion paw,

246
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:35.360
the fucking thing was the size of like four house cats.

247
00:14:35.361 --> 00:14:38.420
Like if you took all four house cats paws and you put it together,

248
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:43.400
that was the size of this fucking thing.
So Anthony fucking starch,

249
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.080
you know,
playing with the thing.

250
00:14:45.081 --> 00:14:48.590
And I remember he ended up getting scratched to get scratched on his neck and

251
00:14:48.591 --> 00:14:51.350
then they told me how to go get a fucking shot.
I don't know if he ever it.

252
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:57.290
And uh,
yeah,
it's weird cause there's a white guy.

253
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:00.320
I should be the kind of guy that goes around fucking with animals.
But,
uh,

254
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:05.510
I don't,
I do,
but I don't,
I go to the zoo.
I kind of fuck with them,

255
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:07.370
but I don't know why.
I just want to see,
you know what it is.

256
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:09.560
I want to see them do what they do.
I don't want to see him chilling.

257
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:14.030
That's fucking boring to me.
I want to see him kind of flipping out,
you know,

258
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.360
like I hate when you finally go see a poisonous snake and it's just laying there

259
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.280
all wound up like some climbing rope,
you know?
I want it to be like,
oh,
you know,

260
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.600
like I'll fucking murder you.
I want to see it through some snake shit.

261
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.970
That's the thing that you go to the zoo.
It's like everybody,
it's like,

262
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.240
it's like everybody's a in a spa or some shit,
you know,
just chilling out.
Oh God.

263
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.160
How much a Peta people going to hate me on this one.

264
00:15:39.161 --> 00:15:42.700
Talking about shooting monkeys and comparing the zoo to was spa.
Oh,

265
00:15:42.701 --> 00:15:44.680
just to let you into all the conditions.
I know.

266
00:15:44.681 --> 00:15:49.150
I'm just saying they're chill or depressed.
I don't know what they are,

267
00:15:49.151 --> 00:15:53.790
but then they're not doing anything.
Did just like,
yeah,

268
00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:57.420
I get it.
I can't get out of here.
So,
you know what I mean?

269
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.410
It'd be like,
you know,

270
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.960
going to look at like human beings and they're all in jail.
Like,

271
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:06.380
why would you want to do that?
Some guy just fucking sitting there on a cot like,

272
00:16:06.381 --> 00:16:10.140
yeah,
I'm here for the rest of my life.
So yeah.
Hi,

273
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.490
nice talking to you.
Can you just move on to the next guy?

274
00:16:13.491 --> 00:16:15.440
You don't want to see that,
right?
You want to go down a little food court.

275
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.580
You want to watch people,
people free like food court is like the Serengeti,

276
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.480
you know,
watering hole for human beings and you just go down.

277
00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:27.410
Then you look at all the different species down there,
all interacting,

278
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.820
you know,
everybody seems to be getting along.

279
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.650
Then all of a sudden somebody comes,

280
00:16:33.651 --> 00:16:36.470
one of those little kids comes by with the wheels on his sneakers and freaks

281
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:40.460
everybody out.
The herd starts to stampede sound like that.
At least that.

282
00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:44.160

Hey,

434
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:35.830
I'm talking about booking my 2018,
I'm already working on that type of shit.

435
00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:40.420
And a,
I got to tell you,
I was so impressed with the,
the,

436
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.430
the track in Austria at the Austrian Grand Prix.

437
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.010
I think I'm going to go to that race next year and I'm going to do a show would

438
00:26:47.011 --> 00:26:48.750
fucking Austria.
What do you think about that?

439
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.100
And then the next fucking week is to British Grand Prix.
So God damn it,

440
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.640
what the fuck?
I might as well go to England,
right?
I'll knock out two.

441
00:26:56.641 --> 00:26:59.940
I'm going to knock out a couple,
two,
three races a year,
you know,

442
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.060
until it starts getting shady and I got to start going to those fucking

443
00:27:03.061 --> 00:27:06.270
countries where I'm like,
do these people hate us?

444
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:12.020
Is this bad place?
Ought to check out with like the fucking Goddamn,
uh,

445
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.500
United States embassy.
Yeah.
What did you guys do to these people?
And uh,

446
00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:19.890
and they over it yet like a,

447
00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:24.660
as even everyone's telling me as Azerbaijan is a beautiful place to go.

448
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:29.060
I Dunno,
I see that a and Z and I just start thinking like,
God,

449
00:27:29.061 --> 00:27:33.800
I don't know about that.
I J a.
N I just feel like that they,

450
00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.450
they start just sounds like they're sitting on oil and if they are,

451
00:27:36.451 --> 00:27:39.120
I know where over there fucking with them,
you know,

452
00:27:39.121 --> 00:27:42.090
decided who their leader was or whatever the fuck we do.
You know what I mean?

453
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.170
You got to do that.
You gotta pay attention.
You know,

454
00:27:46.171 --> 00:27:49.590
Singapore is the shit.
I've been there.
Never been to Malaysia,
Japan.

455
00:27:49.591 --> 00:27:53.850
I got to go there,
right?
I got to do that all I to do all of that shit.

456
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.420
That's what I went to.

457
00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.570
Going to fucking build my whole year and never been to Wimbledon.

458
00:27:57.571 --> 00:28:01.650
I've got to do that.
Oh,
and I got to go to that fucking tt race next year.

459
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:05.130
Those are the three I'm going to knock off,
right?
F One race,

460
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.880
fucking Wimbledon and I'll go to that fucking tt race.
Right?

461
00:28:08.881 --> 00:28:12.270
And watch somebody fucking slamming to the side of a seven 11 at about 200 miles

462
00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:16.890
an hour or 320 kilometers.
But of the fuck it is.

463
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.670
I don't know.
I don't pretend to know.
Um,
all right,

464
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.800
so I'm off to go to fucking,
um,

465
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:30.170
grand rapids,
Michigan and uh,
I can't wait to do this as such.

466
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.710
Can Be such a fucking fun Gig.

467
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:37.400
And I completely fell off the fucking wagon.
You know,
I went over this,

468
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.330
I went to this fucking pool party and I had some,

469
00:28:39.331 --> 00:28:42.150
some beers and then I've drank every single night.
Not a lot,

470
00:28:42.151 --> 00:28:45.840
but I just been dreaming up.
It's not even getting hammered,

471
00:28:45.841 --> 00:28:50.460
it's just the calories.
But I dialed the drinking way back.
Um,

472
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.351
I tell you,

473
00:28:52.351 --> 00:28:55.350
this is what happens to me when I go into the fucking writers or I've been great

474
00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.230
in the writer's room,
except today I had a cheeseburger,
but other than that,

475
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.560
I've been in the writer's room for fucking two and a half weeks and I have eaten

476
00:29:01.561 --> 00:29:05.100
salads the entire time.
I have drank waters.

477
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:09.300
I'm eating fucking fruit.
I'm fucking killing it.

478
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.630
But today my wife came by when that guy,
let's go to fucking,

479
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:17.670
we'll go to shake shack.
Fucking right.
Those burgers are so,
God damn,

480
00:29:17.671 --> 00:29:20.250
this is free advertising.
These burgers are so fucking delicious,

481
00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:25.070
but they fucking need to do like for a five year old,
you know,

482
00:29:25.071 --> 00:29:29.520
every time I see it as like I could eat 10 of these sinks,
you know,

483
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:33.120
they taste so fucking gun.
You just at like three bites to things.
Gone.

484
00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.080
How many steak and shake fucking at steak and shake shake shack burgers you

485
00:29:38.081 --> 00:29:38.914
think you could eat.

486
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.040
I've eaten so bad my life.
Like I don't have the tolerance I used to,

487
00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:47.560
but like in my prime,

488
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.340
I bet it could be five of those.
It's not bad.

489
00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.950
Just under five foot 10.
Right?

490
00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.840
A fat fuck still.
I got to get on the,

491
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.680
I got to get back on the fucking elliptical.
You know what?
My dog was in town.

492
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:07.350
My dog was in town.
I got to see her,
uh,
yesterday and today she's fucking happy.

493
00:30:07.351 --> 00:30:11.970
She looks great.
She looks so fucking great.
You know,

494
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.950
came over right?
I brought her over to the house.
She met my,
uh,

495
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.460
you know,
I'm the same meat moves.
You know what she saw?

496
00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.290
Nia again was freaking out and all that stuff.

497
00:30:22.291 --> 00:30:26.730
Saw Lola wagged her tail and then later looked over at Lola,
you know,

498
00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.040
and she was way,
way,
way away by the way.

499
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.400
I made sure she was way the fuck away and I had it on at least the whole time.

500
00:30:32.401 --> 00:30:34.200
And she looked over and she just went a little bit

501
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.120
like fucking growled at her.
I was like,
all right,
there you go.

502
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:45.320
That's why we don't have you anymore because you are a fucking insane fucking

503
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.660
lunatic dog.
I love you to death.

504
00:30:48.661 --> 00:30:53.410
Like I would have to have dog whisperer fucking skills and um,

505
00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:59.730
uh,
you know,
I don't know that,
that it,
it actually gave me closure.
Like,

506
00:30:59.731 --> 00:31:02.850
I know I made the right fucking decision.
I knew that,

507
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.060
that it was going to be a fucking issue.
Um,

508
00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:12.650
I more thought that she was going to go after she gets so overly protective that

509
00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:18.030
once she bonded with the baby that it was going to be like she couldn't be

510
00:31:18.031 --> 00:31:22.170
lunging at people down the street.
Cause according to my trainer that it would,

511
00:31:22.171 --> 00:31:25.950
it caused her even more fucking anxiety,
um,

512
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.280
that they have like a bay,
you know?
Yeah.
I hear that ain't shit like that.

513
00:31:29.281 --> 00:31:32.490
I have heard stories of like people that like they have a dog,
right?

514
00:31:32.491 --> 00:31:36.780
And then they have like a baby and then the dog like lays underneath the crib

515
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:40.350
and the parents are walking to the baby and the dog starts growling.

516
00:31:40.351 --> 00:31:43.230
So then they gotta like get food,
you know,

517
00:31:43.231 --> 00:31:44.860
and throw it to the dog will go get it.

518
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:48.090
And not realizing that you're rewarding the dog for the behaviors that you don't

519
00:31:48.091 --> 00:31:51.660
want it to do.
It's just too fucking much.
And um,

520
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.770
uh,
uh,
yeah,

521
00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.800
I am 100% at peace with the decision that we made and I am also so fucking happy

522
00:32:04.241 --> 00:32:09.070
that she has a great home.
She looked fucking amazing and um,

523
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.850
you know,
I got to walk her the last couple of days,
you know,

524
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.580
playing what they're,
and all that type of stuff.
It was really fucking great,

525
00:32:15.581 --> 00:32:19.330
but definitely obviously made the right decision.
You know what I mean?

526
00:32:19.331 --> 00:32:23.800
And I'm not trashing the breed or anything like that.
We just got a dog that was,

527
00:32:23.801 --> 00:32:25.750
I dunno,
this dog.

528
00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:30.160
It's amazing that this dog has not been put down like fucking nine times.

529
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:35.030
You know,
this dog is just,
it's like,
it's,
it's fucking do,

530
00:32:35.031 --> 00:32:37.810
they should do a 30 for 30 on this dog,

531
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.780
like all the fucking shit this dog has been through.
And uh,

532
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:47.390
how it always met people that,
you know,
we're in its corner.

533
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.490
We did it.
We did a,
what we did fucking 2009 to last year.

534
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.660
We did seven years with it.
And uh,

535
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:00.680
you know,
and now it's,
that's,
you know,
I got a deal,

536
00:33:00.681 --> 00:33:05.681
worked out with my trainer that he's going to keep the dog until she passes and

537
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.000
I'll still be able to visit her and all that.

538
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:10.010
But that's the last time I'm bringing her by the house.

539
00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.590
It is.
But anytime he comes to town,
I always can,

540
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.440
I go on hikes with her and I fucking,
I loved the dog that does,

541
00:33:19.441 --> 00:33:23.070
but we definitely made the right decision.
And,
uh,
you know,

542
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.060
and I'm still fucking paint cause I still have to pay them.
It's weird.

543
00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.400
It's like it's his dog,
but it's still my dog.

544
00:33:29.401 --> 00:33:32.660
So I'm still paying to board the fucking thing.
This fucking dog is going to,

545
00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:37.290
it's going to cost me a fortune,
but I absolutely love that fucking dog to death.

546
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.510
Uh,
I don't,
I do,
but you know,
I,
you know,

547
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.010
I knew,
I knew it was going to be a fucking problem.
So,
uh,

548
00:33:47.011 --> 00:33:48.170
and I know all your dog people.
Yeah.

549
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.990
Then there was you energy and there's a div eggy bread and they're,
they're fine.

550
00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:55.380
Pin It on me.
Pin It on me.
I did not have to skills.
I did not have the skills.

551
00:33:55.381 --> 00:33:57.840
And you know what?
My dog's still alive.

552
00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:00.600
My baby's still alive and I'm not on the news.

553
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.600
It's trying to explain what the fuck just happened.
You know what I mean?

554
00:34:03.601 --> 00:34:06.240
Cause I knew something was going to happen.
Someone's going to get bit,

555
00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:09.240
and then my dog was going to get put down and I was gonna have to deal with some

556
00:34:09.241 --> 00:34:13.560
fucking horrific guilt or something.
So,
uh,

557
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:18.670
uh,
that's it.
That's it.
So anyways,
that is the,
uh,

558
00:34:18.671 --> 00:34:22.240
that is the podcast for a this Thursday.

559
00:34:22.241 --> 00:34:24.160
You guys have yourselves a wonderful weekend.

560
00:34:24.161 --> 00:34:27.340
You can stay and a thank you to everybody that came out of me.

561
00:34:27.341 --> 00:34:30.670
I was hoping to do one show out there in grand rapids.
We got,

562
00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:34.780
we got fucking two sold out and we've got this other one and um,

563
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:39.630
I am in such as silly string put fucking mood.
Um,

564
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:44.430
the shit that's coming out of my mouth,
I can't fucking wait to just continue on.

565
00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:49.420
Um,
figuring out with this next hour is going to be all right.

566
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:52.250
That is it.
Uh Oh,

567
00:34:52.251 --> 00:34:55.550
congratulations to fucking Aaron judged Jesus Christ.

568
00:34:55.551 --> 00:34:57.290
Did you see that fucking display?

569
00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.790
I love that they said no one could hit one out of the mine.

570
00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:03.230
It's baseball stadium and he fucking did it.

571
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.050
It's literally like watching Paul Bunyan.

572
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:09.430
I'm going to figure out when the fucking Yankees had come to town.

573
00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.960
Hopefully they have an inner league game with the Dodgers so I don't have to

574
00:35:11.961 --> 00:35:15.560
drive all the way down to fucking Anaheim,
which is like a three day trip.

575
00:35:15.561 --> 00:35:18.450
Now you might have people out here.
MMM,

576
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.370
I got to see that guy his rookie season.

577
00:35:21.371 --> 00:35:24.250
I always try to see like when somebody like breaks out like that,

578
00:35:24.251 --> 00:35:27.670
you try to seem that rookie season.
I've been doing that all the way since back.

579
00:35:27.671 --> 00:35:31.690
Like Allen Iverson.
I saw him his rookie season.
I always tell his story.

580
00:35:31.691 --> 00:35:34.000
I saw him his rookie season before he had the corn rows.

581
00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.980
I saw him at the La sports arena.

582
00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:40.410
Biggie smalls was in the crowd on that trip when he got murdered.

583
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.030
Uh,

584
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:47.120
like a few days later and I fucking walked up to him after and he was standing

585
00:35:47.131 --> 00:35:48.360
there.
I remember he had like his,

586
00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:53.330
his security guys were standing there and he looked cool.
Shitty.

587
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.770
I'd like this purple like long fucking coding.

588
00:35:55.771 --> 00:35:57.690
I like the color of royalty and stuff,
you know?

589
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:01.590
And he had like these sunglasses on and a

590
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.160
<v 3>okay.</v>

591
00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.720
<v 1>I remember some guy walked by and just went,</v>

592
00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.950
baby baby yelled at him and he just went,
well,
so boosts up just like that.

593
00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.980
And like,
I swear to God,
like,
Oh look up on the schedule.

594
00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:17.170
70 sixers versus the fucking La Clippers.

595
00:36:17.171 --> 00:36:21.910
That was 1997 and it was either like the end of February,

596
00:36:21.911 --> 00:36:25.060
early March.
And that was the trip.
Man.
I keep,

597
00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:28.100
he wasn't alive for like another fucking week.
It was so creepy.

598
00:36:28.101 --> 00:36:31.450
He was only 20 fucking for crazy.
And by the way,

599
00:36:31.451 --> 00:36:35.830
there was just the 10 year anniversary of that or that genius getting fucking

600
00:36:35.831 --> 00:36:38.260
killed.
And they still haven't been able to figure out who the fuck did it.

601
00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.230
Unbelievable,
I guess.
Or they can't find who killed Kennedy.
Right.

602
00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:43.840
If you believe in that Shit,
you know what I mean?

603
00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:46.090
How hard they're going to look at for fucking rapper gets shot.

604
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:49.090
You know what I mean?
They're going to look the other way with a president.

605
00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:54.140
Do you think that was all him,
that single bolt action.

606
00:36:54.141 --> 00:36:56.930
Fucking rifle.
Jesus Christ.

607
00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.700
I Dunno.
He was a marine.
Who knows?
All right.
I don't know what I'm talking,

608
00:37:01.701 --> 00:37:04.340
talking in circles here.

611
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:14.720
What the hell is the next one?
Oh,

What am I talking about?

Listen to the music and enjoy the greatest hits Thursday podcasts mothers' Day

615
00:37:26.521 --> 00:37:29.340
gone by in a year that no longer exists.
All right.

616
00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.170
I just saw a commercial

617
00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:30.730
for Kentucky Fried Chicken with the parents are all excited because they're two

618
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:36.070
bratty kids won't sit still at the dinner table,
but they him this fucking

619
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.360
<v 5>chicken and they're feeding it to him.</v>

620
00:38:38.361 --> 00:38:42.640
They basically very subtly saying that there's drugs in this chicken that will

621
00:38:42.641 --> 00:38:46.990
make you a spastic children.
Chill the fuck out and spastic.
I mean like,
you know,

622
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.840
not,
not the way they mean it over there in Great Britain,

623
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:55.210
you can't say that on the comedy or you can say it in a comedy club over in

624
00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:57.460
Scotland,
but you'll have a rough yellow.
Have a rough go of it.

625
00:38:57.461 --> 00:39:00.040
If you say the kid was spastic over there,

626
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:04.030
that means like severely mentally challenged over here.

627
00:39:04.031 --> 00:39:06.280
It just means you're not going to get laid to you 26

628
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:15.080
when you were in Grad school looking over a fucking cadaver,
right.

629
00:39:15.081 --> 00:39:17.360
With some other fucking nerve narrowed.
Right.

630
00:39:17.361 --> 00:39:18.590
And you're just sitting there going,

631
00:39:18.591 --> 00:39:21.740
you know the ankle bones connected to the knee bone.
Right.

632
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:24.140
Has any of this made any sense?
What shouldn't?

633
00:39:24.141 --> 00:39:28.010
It's fucking Sunday night and I am spent and I got a whole bunch of Shit I have

You know,

640
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.880
now if you fucking,
you start doing blow or a,

641
00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:55.211
you know,

642
00:39:55.211 --> 00:39:58.810
eating a bunch of trans fat fucking food of Feeding Your Kids Kentucky Fried

643
00:39:58.811 --> 00:40:02.410
fucking chicken,
Jesus Christ,

644
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.730
what happened to parents,
but you got a drug,

645
00:40:05.731 --> 00:40:10.720
your kids to keep them under control,
you know,
you know what it is.

646
00:40:10.721 --> 00:40:13.510
Kids don't respect their parents,
they respect them,

647
00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:18.280
but they don't respect like all my God,
this,
this person could wring my neck,

648
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.160
could pick me up by my hair,
right.

649
00:40:21.161 --> 00:40:24.550
Could grab a paddle and fucking,
you know,

650
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:26.560
mostly hit my ass,

651
00:40:26.561 --> 00:40:30.460
but also kinda hit my lower back because I'm squirming right.

652
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:34.960
That doesn't exist anymore.
So now these kids is so fucking out of control.

653
00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:39.680
These people have to go down to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Okay.

654
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.560
And I,
I,

655
00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:45.560
I use the term chicken very loosely to go down in whatever that is that's in

656
00:40:47.361 --> 00:40:51.530
that bucket.
Okay.
It doesn't have a beak.

657
00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:55.280
It doesn't have feet.
If it's fucking,

660
00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.680
Right.
My world.
That's not a fucking chicken.

661
00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.090
You know,

662
00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:15.530
you want the chicken that looked like Mark McGuire and his rookie season.

663
00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:19.520
You don't want to eat the chicken that looks like mark McGwire when he fucking

664
00:41:19.521 --> 00:41:22.250
played for the cardinals,

665
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:25.120
<v 3>Okay.</v>

<v 5>Do you eat a regular fucking chicken?
First of all,</v>

667
00:41:27.341 --> 00:41:30.400
it's going to look like a pigeon to you because you so used to seeing those

671
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:46.460
you go down to any one of the main stream fucking supermarkets.

672
00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:47.630
<v 3>Okay?</v>

673
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:52.130
<v 5>Okay.
And I swear to God,

674
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.870

Rip Van Winkle.

676

Right.
That was one of those people,

<v 3>okay.</v>

678

<v 5>If you slept for the last 30 years and you went down,
okay.</v>

679

And they showed you what a chicken was,

come on,
where is it?

704
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:38.820
And he had to walk around the corner sitting over there,
lonely.

705
00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:40.560
I swear to God,

706
00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:43.880
looking like a dove look like in somebody killed the fucking dump.

707
00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.460
He goes right there.
That one right there is 100% all natural,

708
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:51.990
nothing's wrong with it.
And I was like,
I was like,
what?

709
00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:55.090
That's what a chicken is supposed to look like.

710
00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.600
And he raised his eyebrows and he,

711
00:43:58.601 --> 00:44:02.110
he kind of put his lips together so they were a straight line and then he
nodded,

712
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:07.030
you know,
I looked at people do like,
like,
yeah,
I'm in the Matrix.

713
00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.280
I realize I'm in the matrix but you know,

714
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:14.990
I knock the bitch up so I got to be selling these recorded up chickens.
No.

715
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:20.000
Um,
anyways,
any,
what the fuck I'm talking about?

716
00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:23.430
So basically that's what these people are eating over there.
Okay.
They are,

717
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.580
they are drugging up
the kids,

718
00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:32.610
but I can't get mad at him because I actually did that to Charlie Murphy and a

719
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.330
Donnell Rawlings.
I've told this story before,
Hey,

720
00:44:36.331 --> 00:44:38.250
I'll tell it against my fucking podcast.

721
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.120
I actually drug the exact thing that they're doing in that Kentucky Fried

722
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:47.100
Chicken commercial with it trying to get their kids to sit still by just feeding

723
00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:50.880
them so full of these fucking trans fats from these roid it up.

724
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:55.910
[inaudible] fucking chickens with the Dolly Parton breast disses right.

725
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.290
I did that to fucking Dawn Ellen,
Charlie.

726
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:06.890
I was hung over and we were taking a car service from Chicago xannies up to one

727
00:45:07.411 --> 00:45:11.910
of those whenever the fuck it was
Saint Charles,

728
00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:16.950
it was a three city run and one of them was Saint Charles.

729
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:20.850
So we're getting in the fucking Limo,
Don L's in rare form.

730
00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:22.000
Charlie's in rare form.

731
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:26.370
They're fucking Gavin and trashing people and me and everybody and I just don't

732
00:45:26.371 --> 00:45:27.750
want to hear it.
I'm like,

733
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.890
I don't want to listen to these fucking guys running that Goddamn yaps in the

734
00:45:31.891 --> 00:45:35.400
back of this car the whole fucking way up.
I want a nice quiet ride.

735
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.250
This is going to suck.
And I walked outside,

736
00:45:38.251 --> 00:45:42.000
hung over and I walked into the Chicago where you know,

737
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:45.750
almost got hit by three fat people.
And um,

738
00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:51.780
I looked up to street and I saw it,
I saw a Popeye's and I was like,

739
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:52.650
oh,
thank God.

740
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:58.050
And I fucking walked in there and I got all this fucking Popeye's chicken with

741
00:45:58.051 --> 00:46:01.080
biscuits and all of this shit food.

742
00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:05.610
And I brought it back to the car and as the car pulled up,

743
00:46:05.611 --> 00:46:07.860
they came out and I say,
hey guys,
I got to sell some.

744
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.640
I got some food and they law and it's fucking great.
You know,

745
00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:12.660
they were hungry or whatever.

746
00:46:12.661 --> 00:46:17.610
And they started showering that fucking Popeye's food.
And I sat back,

747
00:46:17.611 --> 00:46:19.050
nibbling on a drum stick,

748
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:27.180
and I swear to God,
10 minutes later they were asleep.

749
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:30.690
I'm not lying to you.
They were fucking asleep,

750
00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.950
snoring the whole way up.
And I was just sitting there loving life,

751
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.190
the whole fucking write up.
And I,
you know what,
I admitted to them later,

752
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:40.890
they thought it was funny,
but that's basically what it is.

753
00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.630
They called it the Itis,

754
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:46.890
that's what they call it when you eat that shit food and then you have to go to

755
00:46:46.891 --> 00:46:51.270
sleep.
They call it the Itis,
I guess.
And by they,
I mean African Americans,

756
00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.770
um,
they call it the fucking Itus and that's what they got.

757
00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.800
And then I learned that from Don l because I don't know how that man stayed in

758
00:47:01.951 --> 00:47:03.810
shape,
but he had the worst diet.

759
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.740
He's one of those guys who like you stopped for gas and he comes out of the gas

760
00:47:07.741 --> 00:47:10.800
station with like one of those gas station hot dogs

761
00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.920
and he would eat it and then he would immediately fall asleep.
And I,

762
00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:23.090
and I would say to Charlie,
this guy,
he's sleeping and Chad be like,
yeah man,

763
00:47:23.091 --> 00:47:23.940
you got the itis.

764
00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.390
And he explained that to me and what that little bit of information,

765
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.680
it went into my evil white brain and I drug my two African American friends way

766
00:47:35.261 --> 00:47:38.900
back in the year 2005.
Um,

767
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:41.530
and that's a little chicken story for you.
What time did you like that?
Everybody.

768
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.770
So that's what the fuck they're saying right there.

769
00:47:44.771 --> 00:47:48.010
That's what Kentucky Fried Chicken is allegedly saying.

770
00:47:48.011 --> 00:47:49.390
I guess I have to say a legend.

771
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:55.830
So their lawyers on retainer don't attack my fucking podcast as far as I can

772
00:47:56.771 --> 00:47:59.440
tell.
I'm asking you right now,
um,

773
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:04.180
Kentucky Fried Chicken hiding behind your fucking letters,
KFC.

774
00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:06.070
Is that what the fuck you do?
Is that what you're saying?

775
00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:13.350
If you've got kids who are not stimulated enough that they can't even sit down.

776
00:48:13.721 --> 00:48:18.280
If you haven't Rianna running around,
you got to tie your kids out,

777
00:48:18.281 --> 00:48:21.640
opened the door,
you send them out in the fucking yard guy.
I'd go outside,

778
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.400
get outside and play.
That's what you do.

779
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:27.400
Like a God damn one of those fucking Irish dogs.

780
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:29.710
It was bred to have to to herd sheep.

781
00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:33.940
You've got to let that fucking thing run around.
Run around in circles.
Guy,

782
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:37.630
get out there,
take a ball.
You just fucking throw it out and traffic.

783
00:48:37.631 --> 00:48:42.040
Let the dog run around.
Dodging cars.
It comes in,
it's going to lay down.
Okay.

784
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:43.420
It's not going to jump all over.

785
00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:46.150
Company stick and it's cold nose right in their fucking who has.

786
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:50.860
That's what you got to do with your kids.
You've got to send him outside,
right?

787
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:54.850
But to catch a Predator and all these other fucking shows,
you know,

788
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:58.690
all these shows on TV where people forget their kids are in a car with the

789
00:48:58.691 --> 00:49:03.070
windows rolled up and the kids are too fucking dumb to roll them down or the two

790
00:49:03.071 --> 00:49:06.460
week because they haven't gone outside and climb to fucking tree and they stay

791
00:49:06.461 --> 00:49:10.990
in there and the,
and the,
their brains get cooked like a boxer,
you know,

792
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.950
you know that dog boxes,
they don't,
they don't do well in the sun.

793
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:18.730
Well we'll need to do fat kids if you leave the windows rolled up,
you know,

794
00:49:18.731 --> 00:49:21.110
and they got those weak arms that all of that,

795
00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:25.210
I think the most tedious things they ever did was take a wrapper off of a

796
00:49:25.211 --> 00:49:28.660
fucking,
uh,
an ice cream sandwich.
Right.

797
00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:30.820
You can't leave them in the car.

798
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:36.160
My mother left us in the car all the fucking time.
She would go to school,

799
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:40.390
she was going to school during the day trying to further her education and she

800
00:49:40.391 --> 00:49:45.391
left five fucking kids in the car with the windows rolled up in money for Burger

801
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.830
King.
And she would say to us,
just go into the Burger.

802
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:52.180
That's the only time you were to leave this car over the leg over the next three

803
00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.850
fucking hours when I'm in class.

804
00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:59.140
And she would disappear around the corner after we said,
absolutely mom.

805
00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:01.960
And she walked away.
Ed,
uh,

806
00:50:01.961 --> 00:50:04.990
we immediately would get out of the car and start walking up and down the

807
00:50:04.991 --> 00:50:09.130
streets in Boston.
We'd go into fucking burger king and we,

808
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:10.210
we'd have some to eat.

809
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.660
Do you know what would happen nowadays they just saw five fucking dirty face

810
00:50:13.661 --> 00:50:18.610
kids walking up and down Kamath Boylston street going into a burger king,

811
00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.070
looking like the cast to fucking Annie.

812
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:24.820
Someone would have filmed it and my mother would have been in,

813
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.770
they would have taken us away,
you know,
but,

814
00:50:28.771 --> 00:50:32.640
but they didn't because there was no cameras back then or videotape ones.
I mean,

815
00:50:32.641 --> 00:50:33.474
there was,

816
00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:38.840
but only people add them on like the news and a young Steven Spielberg.

817
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:41.550
So we went in there and we fucking got some food,

818
00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:45.690
climbed on cars and fucking yelled at people and Shit.

819
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.400
Know,
hanging on Platt parking meters and all that.
Hence,

820
00:50:50.401 --> 00:50:54.450
we had the fucking forearm strength to roll down the windows and none of us ever

821
00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:57.180
had an issue in the car.
And you know what?

822
00:50:57.181 --> 00:51:00.330
I think that's one to grow on today.
You go people,

823
00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:04.560
I'm not saying KFC is food,
I'm not,
I'm just kidding.

824
00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.730
I'm not saying it's bad food.

825
00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:08.430
Every once in a while who's kitten home every once and we didn't go anywhere.

826
00:51:08.431 --> 00:51:11.760
Be Great.
If he could just fucking do heroin the way you can eat McDonald's.

827
00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:16.320
Just like every once in a while he just be like,
you know what?
Yeah,

828
00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:18.630
let's just fucking tie off.

829
00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:24.090
Not off for the rest of the fucking day in like the people at work understood
it,

830
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:27.480
you know?
Hey,
where were you yesterday?
Odd.
Yeah,

831
00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:29.650
I got this black tar heroin came in.
You know,

832
00:51:29.651 --> 00:51:34.210
I hadn't done it in like three months away.
Figured fuck it.
Oh,

833
00:51:34.211 --> 00:51:36.050
is that what you did?
How was it?
I wasn't,
you know,
like,

834
00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:38.870
like you went to a rubric,
you said,
aw dude,
it was awesome.
Fucking,

835
00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:44.700
I don't remember shit.
She can't,
you know,

836
00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:45.534
he'd get addicted.

837
00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:31.700
<v 6>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

838
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:36.180
This is bill burr and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

839
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:40.060
July 13th,
2009.
This is my third attempt,

840
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:44.910
possibly the fourth attempt to,
uh,
try to do this podcast.

841
00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:48.540
But,
uh,
as always,
I got 9,000 things on my mind.

842
00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:52.560
I have to go to the airport and like two fucking hours to fly up to do my shows

843
00:52:52.561 --> 00:52:56.700
in San Francisco,
um,
this evening.

844
00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:59.340
And uh,
I already walked my frigging dog,

845
00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.800
so I got that out of the way and I'm actually psyched to be at my apartment.

846
00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:08.430
This is the first time I've been here in about five weeks and it's nice to be

847
00:53:08.431 --> 00:53:11.820
sitting here on my couch with my feet on my coffee table.

848
00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:16.960
Um,
do I own anything else?
No,

849
00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:20.920
I rent so the landlord owns the fucking floor,
but I don't have my feet on it.

850
00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:23.080
All right.
So fuck him.

851
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:29.100
Maybe tell you guys about my place I fucking had,
I came home.
Right.

852
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:33.900
And you know,
I don't know if you guys have ever left your life for five weeks,

853
00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:36.690
but when you come back it's a nightmare.

854
00:53:36.691 --> 00:53:40.890
First of all is like three pounds of mail and a,

855
00:53:40.891 --> 00:53:44.670
I don't know about you guys,
but every once in a while I give to one of these,
uh,

856
00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:49.050
you know,
save the wolves or a,
you know,

857
00:53:49.051 --> 00:53:53.850
saved this park or save these lepers or whatever the fuck the,
uh,

858
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.580
the causes and I swear to God,

859
00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.990
don't ever give money through the mail.
Okay.

860
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:03.090
Give it directly to a homeless guy.
You know,

861
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.750
throw a hamburger to a fucking wolf from your car window.

862
00:54:06.751 --> 00:54:09.300
But for the love of God,
do not get on,

863
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:13.230
don't fucking give money through the mail because when you do,

864
00:54:13.231 --> 00:54:17.610
they literally clear out an Acre of trees from the rain forest trying to send

865
00:54:17.611 --> 00:54:19.980
you shit to get more money from you.
It's actually annoying.

866
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:21.630
It's like you feel like a SAP.

867
00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:25.940
Like you just feel like everyone out there who's looking for money,
like your,

868
00:54:25.941 --> 00:54:30.660
your address just lit up like,
oh,
we got a SAP,
we've got a live one here.

869
00:54:30.661 --> 00:54:34.800
He actually gave money.
Holy,
Oh my God,
this guy gives a shit about wolf's.

870
00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:36.923
You know,

871
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.220
where the fuck were the wolf's by the way before then,

872
00:54:41.221 --> 00:54:45.360
before they reintroduce them into the parks and they started killing elk and

873
00:54:45.361 --> 00:54:47.850
competing with the bears,
and more importantly,
the hunters.

874
00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:50.280
So the hunters don't want them there.
Is that,
is that what's going on?

875
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:51.750
Is that the wolf issue?

876
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.890
You know what exactly is going on?

877
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.860
You're Wolfe's where the fuck are wolves anymore?
He said,

878
00:54:59.861 --> 00:55:02.490
is there any place out there?
And you know it's not a fucking mall at this point.

879
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:07.200
I don't know.
How was that intriguing for your Monday?
Monday was citizen fucking,

880
00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:11.310
that'll get the conversation going,
Huh?
All right.
This podcast is sucked so far,

881
00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:15.450
so I know a podcast sucked.
If fucking three minutes into it,

882
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:19.170
I'm already looking for questions that people have sent me.
All right?

883
00:55:19.171 --> 00:55:20.850
I'm a little out of it.
People.
I went,
I went,

884
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:24.130
I went in a little hardcore the other night as always switches.

885
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:26.630
Why I'm shutting it down.
And I'm,

886
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:30.990
I'm just drinking cranberry juice with Lyme now after my shows for awhile.
Okay.

887
00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:34.800
And all you fucking douchebags who've watched the departed will all come up to

888
00:55:34.801 --> 00:55:38.520
me.
Hey,
where are you on your period?
Did you fucking see that movie,

889
00:55:38.521 --> 00:55:40.900
that 900 million other fucking people saw,
hey,

890
00:55:40.901 --> 00:55:44.790
when people quote fucking lines from movies,
you know,
like,

891
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:49.200
like the country didn't see it already.
You know what I mean?

892
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:53.640
It's like you're already telling an old fucking joke.
Nobody cares.
All right.

893
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:57.900
Did I say I was in a good mood this week?
I don't sound like it though.
I,
um,

894
00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:02.850
girlfriends laughing at me.
All right.
Um,
all right,
let's get to the uh,

895
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:05.210
oh,
wait a minute.
You know,
I,
I didn't finish telling the story.
No,

896
00:56:05.211 --> 00:56:07.500
I wanted a little hard the other night.
I actually a,

897
00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:12.030
I ordered that UFC fight and I had a couple of friends come over who will all

898
00:56:12.031 --> 00:56:15.960
remain nameless because I'm a guy's guy and I won't name names.
Huh?

899
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:20.310
You like that?
Like how I just dug myself a guy's guy.
You know,

900
00:56:20.311 --> 00:56:22.680
if Michael Jackson can give himself a fucking nickname,

901
00:56:22.681 --> 00:56:27.460
why can't give myself one bill birth the guy's guy,
the king of guys guys.

902
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:31.150
And,
uh,
you know,
I got a lot of,
I got an email.
This guy was,

903
00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:34.980
I got a couple emails of people giving me Shit,
uh,

904
00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:40.110
saying I completely dropped the ball when it came to Michael Jackson's death.

905
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:45.720
And I just talked about what a big star he was and I didn't chastise him for,

906
00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:50.740
uh,
stuff that he got acquitted of.
And,
uh,

907
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:53.740
and you know what,
I disagree with you.
I 100%.

908
00:56:53.741 --> 00:56:58.410
I think the hacky way to go on that one was to talk about how the guy,
you know,

909
00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:02.920
you know,
is,
is to be that moron who walks around saying that,
you know,

910
00:57:02.921 --> 00:57:07.300
he's guilty of that shit even though he was never convicted.
Okay.

911
00:57:07.301 --> 00:57:08.390
Now I know the guy got a tee,

912
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:11.830
he's got a ton of fucking money and all of that stuff.
But you know,

913
00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:15.730
I'm not saying he did.
I'm not saying he didn't,
but you know,
that's so,

914
00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:19.780
I don't know,
I just thought that that was a hacky way to go to be,
you know,

915
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:24.840
considering some fucking congressmen out on Long Island did some rant,

916
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:30.310
you know,
and put it up on Youtube.
And got like a zillion hits.

917
00:57:30.311 --> 00:57:31.121
I mean right there,

918
00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:36.010
you know that that's a hacky route to go is a comedian if fucking some guy who

919
00:57:36.011 --> 00:57:39.880
you know,
whereas like penny loafers without socks,
you know,

920
00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:43.630
if that guy can come up with a fucking video of the shit,
you know what I mean?

921
00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:47.350
Why don't,
why don't you go watch that guy's video for his insightful,
just goes,

922
00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:51.400
you're fucking kid fucker was goes,
you fucking freak.

923
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.880
You know those people who just go that complete need your,
I mean,

924
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:59.800
how uninteresting in an interesting is it to go that fucking route,
you know,

925
00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:05.710
hey,
you know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to state the obvious,
you know,

926
00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:09.490
this guy's weird.
He had 9,000 plastic surgeries.

927
00:58:09.491 --> 00:58:12.280
What the fuck is with this guy?
And go the exact same route.

928
00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.610
People went with that chick with the eight fucking babies.

929
00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:21.430
Did that make any sense whatsoever?
I'm just saying,
you know Jesus Christ.

930
00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:25.600
Well then when I,
when I'm talking about Elvis was fat while I'm at it,
you know?

931
00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:30.070
All right.
Anyways,
I was watching that.
UFC do you guys want shut?
The other night,

932
00:58:30.071 --> 00:58:35.071
Brock Lesnar probably had the best post fight interview I've ever seen in my

933
00:58:36.221 --> 00:58:39.190
life.
He basically pounded,

934
00:58:39.191 --> 00:58:41.950
this guy was at Frank Mir and I don't even know the fucking names.

935
00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:45.670
I'm out of the loop when it comes to that shit.
This guy basically to just,

936
00:58:45.671 --> 00:58:46.930
if you're not into the UFC,

937
00:58:46.931 --> 00:58:51.931
this is how big the guy basically has a tattoo of a sword on his chest and he's

938
00:58:52.271 --> 00:58:56.650
so big.
I think it's like fucking actual size.
You know what I mean?

939
00:58:56.651 --> 00:59:00.100
Like if I got that tattoo would look like a little paring knife on my chest

940
00:59:00.101 --> 00:59:04.960
where his literally,
he's got the phone.
It's like a Samurai's sword.

941
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:07.390
It star,
I don't even think it starts.

942
00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:11.920
It starts like above his navel and it goes all the way up to his neck.

943
00:59:11.921 --> 00:59:15.850
And of course he has the point of the sword at his fucking throat.

944
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:21.600
Guys,
just a maniac.
You know what I love too was he law.

945
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:22.483
When he won,

946
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:26.750
<v 1>the crowd starts booing him and he immediately gives everybody the finger and</v>

947
00:59:26.751 --> 00:59:30.590
when he comes up to the microphone,
everyone's born him and he's going,
I love it.

948
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:33.830
I love it.
And you could clearly see that he didn't love it.

949
00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:38.870
You know he Brock,
you didn't love it.
You want to be loved.

950
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.750
Okay.
But it was great.
He reminded me,
I think,

951
00:59:41.751 --> 00:59:45.380
I think they finally have a good heel and the UFC,
you know what I mean?

952
00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:46.220
You Watch these guys,

953
00:59:46.221 --> 00:59:49.490
these guys are the toughest motherfuckers on the planet and for the most part

954
00:59:49.491 --> 00:59:50.390
when they end the fights,

955
00:59:50.391 --> 00:59:54.680
they always just compliment the other guy say I respect the guy or whatever.

956
00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:56.930
But this night was,
it was fucking great.

957
00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:02.060
This one guy knocked out this other dude that guys just laying there on the

958
01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:05.960
ground and then this the fucking do to knock some out.

959
01:00:05.961 --> 01:00:10.310
Then for some reason leaps up into the air and just lands on them and punches

960
01:00:10.311 --> 01:00:11.240
him in the face again.

961
01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:15.990
<v 6>It was like attempted murder and then he like admits to it at the end of the</v>

962
01:00:15.991 --> 01:00:20.040
fight.
Like,
yeah,
I did that.
I did the second one because uh,
you know,

963
01:00:20.041 --> 01:00:24.660
we talked a lot of shit.
It was great.

964
01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:29.050
It was total thunder dome and uh,
unlike a lot of paper views that you,

965
01:00:29.051 --> 01:00:32.160
you throw your fucking money down and afterwards you feel like you got raped.

966
01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:36.980
I definitely feel like I got my money's worth.
So,
uh,
um,
uh,
there you go.

967
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:41.710
A few.
If you want to pick a pay for paper view,
go with the UFC.
Um,

968
01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:46.650
what the fuck did Brock say?
He said something like,
uh,
he's like,
God,

969
01:00:46.651 --> 01:00:48.270
that guy,
you know the guy funny,
he goes,

970
01:00:48.271 --> 01:00:50.850
he had a horseshoe up his ass last fight.

971
01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:55.970
I pulled it out and I bash it over his head and he had like this psycho fucking

972
01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:58.770
date rape vibe.

973
01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.580
I'm literally waking up my entire fucking complex doing a bad impression of

974
01:01:02.581 --> 01:01:06.600
fucking Brock Lesnar.
Oh,
whatever.
It was a great thing.
Let's go to the gas bill.

975
01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.690
All right.
Let me get out of this fucking thing because you know,
half,
you know,

976
01:01:09.691 --> 01:01:13.140
as I'm doing this podcast,
half of my brain's going,
dude,
you haven't packed yet.

977
01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:18.630
And um,
I'm not going to pack shit anyways.
This is one of these overnight gigs.

978
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:21.780
What I do is I basically wear the shoes.
So I have them,

979
01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:26.490
I wear the shoes that I'm going to wear on stage,
right.
And then I just,

980
01:01:26.491 --> 01:01:27.630
whatever I wear in the plains,

981
01:01:27.631 --> 01:01:31.180
whenever I wear on the plane and I just fucking pack my,
my,

982
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:34.170
my pants and the shirt that I'm going to wear that night.

983
01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.440
And then like a fucking toothbrush,
toothpaste,
shave and shit,

984
01:01:37.441 --> 01:01:38.920
I put it into a lunch bag,

985
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:42.870
little plastic thing and I throw it in and that's fucking it.
That's it.

986
01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:47.850
And I zipped right through the airport,
you know,
security guards looking at me.

987
01:01:47.851 --> 01:01:51.780
What's with this guy?
He doesn't have any luggage.
He doesn't have any luggage.

988
01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.060
The fucks with this guy.
I'll tell you what the fuck's with this guy.

989
01:01:54.061 --> 01:01:55.020
He's going to San Francisco,

990
01:01:55.021 --> 01:01:58.170
he's coming right back and he doesn't have any drugs in his ass.
All right.

991
01:01:58.171 --> 01:02:02.700
I'm telling jokes.
Stop fucking looking at me.
All right,
let's go to ASCE.
Bill.
Um,

992
01:02:02.701 --> 01:02:04.290
here's an interesting question.
Uh,
Bill,

993
01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.860
I've been dating the same girl for about two and a half years now.

994
01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:10.530
We've talked about having a threesome,

995
01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:15.180
but I've never met the right girl to do it with.
Oh,
okay.
Here we go.

996
01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:20.700
This is called the beginning of the end of a relationship.
Um,

997
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:25.320
we're tired of fucking each other and we've admitted it to one another and now

998
01:02:25.321 --> 01:02:27.150
we're going to go outside the relationship,

999
01:02:27.151 --> 01:02:29.370
but we're too codependent to break up with one another.

1000
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.980
I'm just fucking with you.
All right.
Here we go.
Ah,
he says,

1001
01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:36.450
I'm 28 and my girlfriend is 26.
About two months ago,

1002
01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:37.284
I added some,

1003
01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:42.150
I added some random cougar to my Facebook who is 42.

1004
01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:45.660
Uh,
right now it's getting interesting.
Uh,

1005
01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:49.110
my girlfriend got all pissed about it and we had a minor fight.

1006
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:52.320
Fast forward to this past Thursday,

1007
01:02:52.321 --> 01:02:57.120
and my girlfriend runs into the cougar at a bar while she's out getting

1008
01:02:57.121 --> 01:02:59.220
hammered.
Okay.
Timeout.

1009
01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:04.950
You added some random cougar on Facebook.
There's,

1010
01:03:04.951 --> 01:03:07.590
what,
4 billion people on Facebook?

1011
01:03:07.591 --> 01:03:11.460
And somehow your girlfriend runs into the random cougar dude,

1012
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:15.840
you added an old fucking broad,
you met in a bar down the street.

1013
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:20.550
Are you on Facebook?
Yeah,
I'm on Facebook.
You know,
add me.

1014
01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:25.650
She's probably already rubbed one out.
Ah,
where their old wrinkled up hand.

1015
01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:33.680
She probably already gave you a hand job,
but the local Hooters didn't.

1016
01:03:33.681 --> 01:03:36.550
You didn't,
she write and then you fucking like,

1017
01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:38.240
then you feel guilty and you're like,
all right,

1018
01:03:38.241 --> 01:03:40.940
well if I include her with my girlfriend,
maybe I can get some of that.

1019
01:03:40.941 --> 01:03:45.830
I just sort of cheated stanch off of me.
All right,
I'm judging.
I'm sorry.

1020
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:49.340
Let's plow ahead here.
So we goes,
uh,

1021
01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:53.390
I'm at home and I get a call from my girl at one in the morning who says,

1022
01:03:53.391 --> 01:03:56.990
I met the chick.
You add it on Facebook and we should have a threesome with her.

1023
01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:01.790
Good for her.
Jesus Christ.
All right.
At first I was kind of excited,

1024
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:05.780
but then my girlfriend says she wanted to take her back to the apartment to

1025
01:04:05.781 --> 01:04:09.850
experiment with just the two of them.
Uh,

1026
01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:13.670
this cougars good.
She's good.
She sweet talk to you,
right,

1027
01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.530
sweet talk to you.
And now she's sweet talk and your girlfriend,
um,

1028
01:04:18.531 --> 01:04:20.150
she's in.
The guy says,
uh,

1029
01:04:20.151 --> 01:04:24.920
I freaked out and told her that it would hurt my feelings if she messed around

1030
01:04:24.921 --> 01:04:27.770
without me.
Basically.
My question is,

1031
01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.600
is it cheating for my girlfriend to hook up with another chick if I'm not there?

1032
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:36.260
All right dude.
You know what you're asking the wrong question.

1033
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:38.900
If I could be so bold here,

1034
01:04:38.901 --> 01:04:43.160
the question you should really be asking yourself right now is when you look at

1035
01:04:43.161 --> 01:04:44.540
your girlfriend,
you got to say,

1036
01:04:44.541 --> 01:04:48.320
is this the future mother of my children?

1037
01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.940
If it is,
don't have a threesome with her.

1038
01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.890
Okay.
Because I don't care how much you love her.

1039
01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:02.210
The sight of her going down on that old clam is just something that,

1040
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:04.743
<v 3>okay,</v>

1041
01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:09.030
<v 6>it's just something that I just psychologically,</v>

1042
01:05:09.031 --> 01:05:10.320
I don't know how you're going to be,

1043
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:15.410
that's going to be holding your child something that hopefully 50% looks like

1044
01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:19.520
you one day.
You know what I'm saying?
That's just a,
uh,

1045
01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:22.590
you know,
seriously dude,
if this is,
this is,

1046
01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.720
if this is the woman you want to marry and me,
come on man,

1047
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.850
some dusty old broad down the street,

1048
01:05:27.851 --> 01:05:32.290
you guys are going to fucking do an indecent proposal with that.

1049
01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:34.180
You know,

1050
01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:39.180
I could see if there's something about going to another country or a far away

1051
01:05:39.911 --> 01:05:42.940
place and doing something like that because you know,
you get to play that,

1052
01:05:42.941 --> 01:05:44.470
oh we're just different people now.

1053
01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:46.900
And then you come back and you act like it never happened.

1054
01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:50.920
You just compartmentalize it and you know,
it comes up in an argument,
you know,

1055
01:05:50.921 --> 01:05:52.180
fucking 12 years later.

1056
01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:54.730
But by then who gives a shit cause you're both old and out of shape,

1057
01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:59.860
but to go right down the street,
you basically shitting way you're eating.
Um,

1058
01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:03.430
I dunno dude,
I don't,
I like if,
if you're not going to marry this girl,

1059
01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:07.540
then you know why not?
I would do it for the story.
But uh,

1060
01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.090
if you really think that this is the girl you're gonna marry,
I would,

1061
01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:14.920
I would tap out of this one.
I'd wait for a,
I'd wait for some fresher fish.

1062
01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:20.290
Jesus Christ.
Bill,
sorry.
I've been really crude lately on this thing.

1063
01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.140
Um,
but anyways,
I will ask you a question is,

1064
01:06:23.141 --> 01:06:26.710
is it cheating for my girlfriend to hook up with another chick if I'm not there?

1065
01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:31.630
Um,
uh,

1066
01:06:31.631 --> 01:06:34.780
Jesus Christ,
this is just another one where women get away with it.
Right?

1067
01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:38.830
I don't know.
Would it be cheating if you went out and blew your best friend?

1068
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:42.400
I think it's just kind of fucking weird.

1069
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.230
There's just something about if you have the same sexual parts,

1070
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:52.060
it's like,
it's less cheating.
It's more weird.

1071
01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:55.150
Yeah.
It is weird.
If she's fucking then,

1072
01:06:55.151 --> 01:06:59.350
then she's just having a full on lesbian thing where if you're there too,

1073
01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:02.710
then it's just sorta like you're adding to like the candy dish.

1074
01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:05.770
You know what I mean?
It's another little spice in there.
A,

1075
01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:10.270
I already got one vagina.
Oh look,
there's another one.
You know what I mean?

1076
01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.340
And you know,
you get to stack them up,

1077
01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:16.240
which you want to do is have the three on one and you just stack them all up.

1078
01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:18.400
What I,
I call that the traffic light,
right?

1079
01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.460
Ah,
Shit.
I think I just coined a phrase there.

1080
01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:30.580
I love how I'm acting like I've actually done any of this.

1081
01:07:30.581 --> 01:07:34.990
I haven't done any of that.
You know,
I actually care about my girlfriend and his,

1082
01:07:34.991 --> 01:07:39.310
as much as I'd want to have a fucking two on one.
I just,
I couldn't,

1083
01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:41.380
I couldn't,
I actually mean that.

1084
01:07:41.381 --> 01:07:43.210
She's sitting over there putting lotion on herself.
Look,

1085
01:07:43.211 --> 01:07:44.920
are you getting all adorable?
Why?

1086
01:07:44.921 --> 01:07:48.460
Why are you looking all nice now that I'm leaving town?
Huh?
What do you got?

1087
01:07:48.461 --> 01:07:52.540
Some office boyfriend sick of that lavender robe.

1088
01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.910
My girl has this fucking robe.
This is way too personal,
but I really need to,

1089
01:07:57.911 --> 01:08:00.340
but yeah,
you really need to get a new one over the,

1090
01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:03.700
dress it up a little differently.
Is that the dog?

1091
01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:10.210
Okay.
Fucking codependent.
Pitbull.
Can you believe that shit?

1092
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.120
So anyways,
dude,
you know what?
I would be honest,
like this is the deal,
man.

1093
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:15.860
If you're not going to,
if you're not going to stay with this girl,

1094
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:19.190
by all means fucking do it,
by all means do it.

1095
01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:23.210
But if you actually loved this girl and you're gonna marry this girl,

1096
01:08:23.230 --> 01:08:24.230
do you really want,

1097
01:08:24.231 --> 01:08:28.130
I mean the next time you guys get tested for whatever fucking reason,

1098
01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:33.230
you know you got to worry cause you,
you,
you put your Dick in and be Davis.

1099
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:38.780
What are the fucking name is the name of that chicken played?
Alison said Alice.

1100
01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.560
What the fuck was the name of that?
Hey,

1101
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:45.740
what's the name of the housekeeper on the Brady Bunch was Alice,
right?

1102
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:48.980
It was Alice.
For some reason it came out of my mouth.
It didn't sound right.

1103
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:53.640
All right.
Um,
oh this is the best part of the email.
The guy goes,
ps,

1104
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:57.410
I tried to use small words in this email because I know how you suck at reading

1105
01:08:57.411 --> 01:09:01.670
things off your computer.
Ah Shit.
That really made me laugh.

1106
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:03.980
All right.
Even though I didn't laugh right there,

1107
01:09:03.981 --> 01:09:06.710
it did make me laugh because it was the excitement that it was new.

1108
01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.770
Then I just read it again and it wasn't new to me,

1109
01:09:09.771 --> 01:09:12.770
so I gave it a lifeless read,

1110
01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.230
which goes back to what I was talking about earlier.

1111
01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:17.990
When people quote shit from movies that you've already seen,

1112
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.740
and when somebody comes up to you and they're like,
hey,
hey,

1113
01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:25.850
have you seen the depart and what?
Have you seen it yet?
Yeah,
yeah,
I saw it.
Yeah.

1114
01:09:25.851 --> 01:09:28.520
Yeah.
That one pyre and they were in the bar.
I saw it.

1115
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:33.140
And they just keep plowing through.
And no matter what you say,

1116
01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.440
no matter what you do,
they're going to do the whole fucking scene.

1117
01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:38.360
Why can't you just say,
Hey,
listen,
you know,

1118
01:09:38.361 --> 01:09:41.240
that movie you've already seen and you don't want to hear me do,

1119
01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:43.010
I'm going to do it anyways.

1120
01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:46.430
So it'd be in your best interest if you don't want to be involved in this,

1121
01:09:46.431 --> 01:09:50.240
to fucking walk away right now,
because I am unstoppable once,

1122
01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:54.170
once I fucking get in this mindset,
you know?
All right.

1123
01:09:54.171 --> 01:09:56.870
Let's go onto the next question.
Hey,
Bill.
First off,

1124
01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.780
a huge fan of the Monday morning podcast.
Thank you.
Uh,

1125
01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.440
you've always given some great advice to comedians starting out,

1126
01:10:03.441 --> 01:10:07.580
but I was wondering what advice you have for someone with a few years of comedy

1127
01:10:07.581 --> 01:10:08.414
under their belt.

1128
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:12.230
I'm young comic and I had been doing standup for a few years and had been doing

1129
01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:17.340
regular work hosting,
featuring et Cetera,
but I live in a smaller market.
Uh,

1130
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:20.530
that's a good thing actually when you're starting out.
Um,

1131
01:10:20.531 --> 01:10:24.560
I'm moving to La in a month and I'm very excited to dive into the big comedy

1132
01:10:24.561 --> 01:10:26.810
scene and looking forward to the challenge.
I was wondering,
Bill,

1133
01:10:26.811 --> 01:10:29.780
your thoughts on the various comedy stages in town,

1134
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:33.440
Ucb versus the comedy store versus the laugh,
laugh factory and so on.

1135
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:35.750
What is the vibe from place to place,

1136
01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:40.850
which is your favorite since you moved to town?
All right.
This is my whole vibe,

1137
01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.050
uh,
as far as,
okay,
you were in a small market,
you started in a small market.

1138
01:10:45.051 --> 01:10:46.850
That's a great,
that's where,

1139
01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.920
I mean I'm basically going with my experience because I started in a smaller

1140
01:10:51.921 --> 01:10:56.660
market in Boston and uh,
before I moved to New York and then coming here to la.

1141
01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.100
Um,
so I think starting in a smaller markets better,

1142
01:11:01.101 --> 01:11:03.350
it's just easier to get on stage,
less competition.

1143
01:11:03.351 --> 01:11:05.270
There's nobody watching you and that type of shit.

1144
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:07.640
And then basically what happens two to three years in,

1145
01:11:07.641 --> 01:11:08.930
you start looking around going,
all right,

1146
01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:11.630
I gotta get the fuck Outta here from ever going to get to that next level.

1147
01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.850
And then you have to make a determination of whether you're going to move to New

1148
01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:18.290
York or la.
And um,
I dunno,

1149
01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.160
I was way more of a New York guy,

1150
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:25.050
but you basically should check out both places in whichever one you just feel is

1151
01:11:25.051 --> 01:11:28.140
drawing you towards it.
I would go that way.

1152
01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:33.180
And as far as what,
um,
the comedy store laugh factory,
UCB,

1153
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:36.690
um,
I like all of those places.
And I can tell you this,

1154
01:11:36.691 --> 01:11:40.680
if you moving out to la to get into TV and movies and that type of thing,

1155
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.810
I would take an Improv class.

1156
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:48.240
It's something that I wish I did and it's something I plan on doing soon.
And uh,

1157
01:11:48.241 --> 01:11:51.690
it's weird.
It's kind of looked down upon by comedians.
Like when they,

1158
01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:56.070
when they look at the Improv shows,
they,
you know,
somebody throw out an emotion,

1159
01:11:56.071 --> 01:11:59.250
we always considered like fucking hacky or whatever,
but,
um,

1160
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:01.451
I dunno,
I,

1161
01:12:01.451 --> 01:12:06.270
I think there's a reason why when you watch the office and you watch Saturday

1162
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:11.130
night live and you watch all these shows and so many people are coming from,
uh,

1163
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.930
you know,
second city and UCB.
I mean,
I actually went to the Groundling show,

1164
01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.520
this guy's buddy of mine now,

1165
01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:20.460
she was doing a show down there and I went and I saw it and it was fucking
great.

1166
01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:23.610
And what I noticed when I was watching it was literally everything that they

1167
01:12:23.611 --> 01:12:26.820
were doing,
if you tried to do it in stand up,
you would,

1168
01:12:26.821 --> 01:12:30.180
you would just get raked over the coals by the comedians.
They had props,

1169
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.600
they would sing and songs.
Uh,
what else?

1170
01:12:33.601 --> 01:12:36.150
What else can you not do as a comedian,
um,

1171
01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:39.900
without getting beaten with a fucking mic stand?
Um,
you know,

1172
01:12:39.901 --> 01:12:43.410
they were up there with other people,
you know,

1173
01:12:43.411 --> 01:12:45.900
they would dress it up just fucking all this type of shit.

1174
01:12:45.901 --> 01:12:48.570
But it was fucking hilarious.
And I remember when I went down that night,

1175
01:12:48.571 --> 01:12:51.060
I was watching the show at the Groundlings and it was hilarious.

1176
01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:53.970
And then I went to the comedy store,
but it was,
and it was also hilarious,

1177
01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:59.010
but I kind of understood why like when you watch an Improv show,

1178
01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:03.390
especially if they're doing like sketches,
it's like watching a live TV show.

1179
01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:07.650
So you don't really have to think,
there's no thought like,
oh,

1180
01:13:07.651 --> 01:13:11.730
can I see this person on TV?
You feel in a way like you're watching a TV show.

1181
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.980
Whereas if you watch a comedian,
you know what your more hearing is like a,

1182
01:13:16.981 --> 01:13:19.890
a monologist in Sony,
like spewing out their thoughts,

1183
01:13:19.891 --> 01:13:21.480
which is also fucking hilarious.

1184
01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:26.481
But I can see why they always approached comedians now to host reality shows or

1185
01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:30.150
to,
uh,
I dunno,
whatever,

1186
01:13:30.151 --> 01:13:33.030
all the other shit that they fucking have us go out for and they think that we

1187
01:13:33.031 --> 01:13:36.780
can't act because they can't really see us doing it.
So anyways,

1188
01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:42.540
um,
you know,
I guess what I'm trying to say is come out here and do standup,

1189
01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:45.150
but don't be,
I would definitely take acting classes,

1190
01:13:45.151 --> 01:13:49.080
take those improv classes because it's only going to help you in the long run.

1191
01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:53.870
And uh,
you know those Improv classes,
I think it's kind of like open mikes.

1192
01:13:53.871 --> 01:13:56.880
You need to go to an open mic cause you need a safe place where you can just

1193
01:13:56.881 --> 01:14:01.050
bomb and suck and learn to get good.
Um,

1194
01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:05.040
and I feel that you should do the same thing with acting.

1195
01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:09.690
You should go to acting class and just fucking bomb and just do a bunch of shit

1196
01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:13.690
that you would never do if you just went on.
You know,

1197
01:14:13.691 --> 01:14:17.020
if you're booked a guest star on a show or if you booked a part in a movie

1198
01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:20.110
because you'd be like,
Oh fuck,
I don't know if this is going to fly.

1199
01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:25.380
And that's not really the place to see if something's going to bomb is when you,

1200
01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:30.600
you,
you book a big Gig and people still don't know who the fuck you are and you,

1201
01:14:30.601 --> 01:14:34.960
you make some big fucking choice.
So,
um,

1202
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:40.210
I dunno,
I like all the clubs out here as far as the standup clubs,

1203
01:14:40.211 --> 01:14:41.500
but,
um,
I would definitely,

1204
01:14:41.501 --> 01:14:43.780
if I was you that that would be the biggest thing I can tell you.

1205
01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:48.220
It's definitely do shit like that.
So,
uh,
it'll help you with your auditions.

1206
01:14:48.221 --> 01:14:53.080
It's something I wish I did back in the day and uh,
I don't believe in that.

1207
01:14:53.081 --> 01:14:55.930
Everything happens for a fucking reason.
I believe.
No,

1208
01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.830
I made a mistake and that is one of the mistakes I made in my career is I did

1209
01:14:59.831 --> 01:15:03.970
not focus on that shit.
All right.
That was a little sad.
Okay,

1210
01:15:03.971 --> 01:15:07.840
let's move on here.
Um,
oh,
here's one.
It's for a little self checkout story.

1211
01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:11.800
Um,
if you're new to my podcast,
I am 100% against.

1212
01:15:11.801 --> 01:15:15.190
So self checkouts in a grocery stores.

1213
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:20.140
I am not 100% against automation.
I have no automated machines.

1214
01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:25.141
I have no problem with the ones at the bank where I have 24 hour access to my

1215
01:15:26.861 --> 01:15:30.880
money.
And just for the simple fact is it takes me two seconds to get my money.

1216
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.480
I stick a card in,
I punch in my password,
I say withdrawal.

1217
01:15:34.481 --> 01:15:38.560
They say how much I say this much and I have my money as opposed to self

1218
01:15:38.561 --> 01:15:42.880
checkout where I have to become a fucking cashier and a bag boy and I have to

1219
01:15:42.881 --> 01:15:45.220
scan a week's worth of fucking groceries.

1220
01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:48.430
And if something doesn't have the right bar code,
I have to do what?

1221
01:15:48.431 --> 01:15:49.480
Get a price check.

1222
01:15:49.690 --> 01:15:53.500
I don't know fucking what and that's after I stand behind a plumber who's doing

1223
01:15:53.501 --> 01:15:54.520
the same fucking thing.

1224
01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:59.770
And considering it isn't any quicker where an ATM at a bank is quicker,

1225
01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.810
it makes you know or or automated things at at the,

1226
01:16:02.811 --> 01:16:06.010
at the airport has made checking in for a flight quicker.

1227
01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:09.700
So I want you fucking nerds out there who keeps thinking that I'm just against

1228
01:16:09.701 --> 01:16:13.050
tech advancements in technology.
I'm not,
I am.

1229
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:16.690
I am against the ones that is not,
they're not an advancement.

1230
01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:21.850
It's only in an advancement for the fucking big goddamn store.

1231
01:16:21.851 --> 01:16:23.050
All they've done is just,
you know,

1232
01:16:23.051 --> 01:16:26.230
enabled me to do somebody else's job for fucking free.

1233
01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:30.100
And it takes the exact same amount of time.
If not fucking more.
Okay.

1234
01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.150
If you could come up away for me to scan my fucking groceries and it actually

1235
01:16:34.151 --> 01:16:38.530
was quicker and they magically were bagged,
I wouldn't be doing this shit.

1236
01:16:38.531 --> 01:16:40.060
So anyways,
here we go.
This guy says,

1237
01:16:40.061 --> 01:16:43.870
so it's 11:00 PM and my fiance is dying for some ice cream.

1238
01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:46.590
Everything's closed out there by the time,
uh,

1239
01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.570
we get outside the bars and a couple of major,
um,

1240
01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.570
only a couple of major supermarket chains were open.

1241
01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:56.110
So we hit our local Kroger supermarket,
which is open 24 hours.

1242
01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:59.170
We'd grab a pint of ice cream and walk to the register thinking this should be

1243
01:16:59.171 --> 01:17:03.540
quick boy.
Oh boy were we wrong?
We couldn't believe what we were seeing.
Uh,

1244
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:06.430
the store had maybe 15 lanes and not one was open.

1245
01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:11.580
All we had were four of the do it yourself lanes open and one person overseeing

1246
01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:12.740
those.
Um,

1247
01:17:12.741 --> 01:17:16.340
this would be fine if the four people who were using these registers didn't all

1248
01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:19.010
have $150 worth of groceries in their cart.

1249
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:22.760
Plus they were four or five people waiting in front of us as well.

1250
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:25.550
I don't know if you've noticed,
but this is what Pete,
uh,

1251
01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:28.220
but I don't know if you've noticed this,
notice this,

1252
01:17:28.221 --> 01:17:29.990
but when people scan their own item,

1253
01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:34.760
it takes approximately twice as long than if an employee is doing it.

1254
01:17:34.761 --> 01:17:36.800
Thank you.
That's what the fuck I was saying.

1255
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:41.540
Plus one of the poor people's scanning their groceries was an elderly elderly

1256
01:17:41.541 --> 01:17:44.450
man in one of those drivable carts.

1257
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:48.980
This man could barely move yet he was forced to scan his own shit and then when

1258
01:17:48.981 --> 01:17:50.120
he had to pay,

1259
01:17:50.121 --> 01:17:54.620
he couldn't really reach the slot where you put your cash in or slide your

1260
01:17:54.621 --> 01:17:58.280
credit card and you could tell he had a very hard time reading the screen from

1261
01:17:58.281 --> 01:18:01.580
that far away.
So we finally make our way out of the self checkout.

1262
01:18:01.581 --> 01:18:06.200
We scan our one item and of course the computer doesn't register that we placed

1263
01:18:06.201 --> 01:18:10.130
the ice cream on the bagging area and keeps telling us to remove the last item

1264
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:14.800
and rescan it.
And after that comes up a few times,
I tell,
uh,

1265
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:18.830
it tells us that the employee has been notified and to please wait.

1266
01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:23.090
So we look at that one employee sitting there whose only job is to watch a bunch

1267
01:18:23.091 --> 01:18:26.660
of suckers do her job and for her.
Uh,

1268
01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:31.060
and what is she doing playing with their fucking iPhone.
We get our,

1269
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:35.360
we get our attention pay and get the fuck out of there.
And to top it all off,

1270
01:18:35.361 --> 01:18:38.830
since it's July,
by the time my fiance opened up or Ben and Jerry's was,

1271
01:18:38.831 --> 01:18:43.310
she had to wait a half hour for,
it was all watery,
you know,

1272
01:18:43.311 --> 01:18:46.280
just how she likes it.
Um,
anyways.
Um,

1273
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:52.850
yeah,
see,
I mean,
I dunno,
I've talked about this shit till I'm blue in my face.

1274
01:18:52.851 --> 01:18:56.660
I don't understand people who think that big time corporations come up with new

1275
01:18:56.661 --> 01:19:01.280
technologies to try and help the customer save money.
Um,

1276
01:19:01.281 --> 01:19:03.680
if you want to know how a corporation's mentality works,

1277
01:19:03.681 --> 01:19:08.681
I can recommend a good documentary that I saw literally called the corporation.

1278
01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:14.810
And it's a great one because it isn't like this Michael Moore totally slamming,

1279
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:17.600
you know,
everybody in corporations are evil.

1280
01:19:17.601 --> 01:19:20.780
It actually just showed how people in corporations are kind of regular people,

1281
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:26.470
but just the business model in the momentum and the direction that it goes in

1282
01:19:28.011 --> 01:19:31.970
and how they always have to show a fucking profit no matter what leads to them

1283
01:19:31.971 --> 01:19:36.200
doing literally psychotic shit.
Um,
anyways.

1284
01:19:36.201 --> 01:19:40.760
Um,
oh,
here's another thing he says,
uh,
get,
uh,
also,

1285
01:19:40.761 --> 01:19:44.480
did you see the alleged swimming pool racism thing going on in Philly?

1286
01:19:44.481 --> 01:19:48.140
Looks like the wrong person watched your last HBO special.
Yeah,

1287
01:19:48.141 --> 01:19:50.830
I got a lot of emails.
Yeah.
About that.
Um,

1288
01:19:52.670 --> 01:19:56.270
I guess that happened the whole get out of the pool thing.
You know,

1289
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:59.210
I think what I was trying to say in that bit was kind of lost.

1290
01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:04.211
What I was saying was that white people are evil has been documented.

1291
01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:06.453
You know,

1292
01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:11.020
they started off with major subjects like slavery and uh,

1293
01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.560
they just kept making the movie over and over again.

1294
01:20:13.561 --> 01:20:17.370
They had to come up with new subjects to the point it got all the way down to

1295
01:20:17.371 --> 01:20:21.030
swimming,
which to me was kind of fucking nitpicking.

1296
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.980
But I actually saw somebody sent me a clip of that,
that story on,

1297
01:20:25.981 --> 01:20:27.540
uh,
on the Internet.

1298
01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:32.040
And it was a classic news story where they just show one side of the new story.

1299
01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:36.060
All they showed with the people complaining they didn't show the other side.

1300
01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:39.090
And then everyone just has those other people convicted.
Now,

1301
01:20:39.091 --> 01:20:43.050
I'm not saying that they,
they fucking didn't do something wrong,

1302
01:20:43.051 --> 01:20:46.530
but you got to hear the other side first.
You know,

1303
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.170
you got to see what the deal was.

1304
01:20:49.171 --> 01:20:53.340
Were they decent kids and they went there and they really got judged or was it a

1305
01:20:53.341 --> 01:20:54.960
group of fucking asshole kids?

1306
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:58.350
And then they got booted out and then they just played the race card.

1307
01:20:58.351 --> 01:21:02.460
You don't know until you've seen it,
but I can,
I can tell you this.

1308
01:21:02.461 --> 01:21:07.461
I don't think it's a smart thing in general to,

1309
01:21:07.681 --> 01:21:12.360
uh,
you know,
city kids versus suburban kids.
It's it,
that's never a good thing.

1310
01:21:12.361 --> 01:21:16.710
When you grow up in the city,
no matter what color you are,
you age in dog years.

1311
01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:21.840
You know when I was out in the suburbs playing with the fucking stick in a mud

1312
01:21:21.841 --> 01:21:26.010
puddle,
the white version of me on the inner city was learning how to fucking,

1313
01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:30.240
I dunno,
take ecstasy.
You know,
I mean this straight across the board,

1314
01:21:30.241 --> 01:21:33.330
Paris Hilton probably went to her first orgy when she was like 11.

1315
01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:35.003
You know what I mean?

1316
01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:40.680
I Dunno eight now and I don't get mushy and she's like the king of all whores

1317
01:21:40.681 --> 01:21:44.460
and I don't give a shit how you take her out of the city and sticker in a nice

1318
01:21:44.461 --> 01:21:47.190
fucking park.
She still a psycho whore.
Right.

1319
01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:51.930
So just being devil's advocate here,
you know,
that being said,

1320
01:21:51.931 --> 01:21:54.240
you really shouldn't have a problem with anybody getting an a fucking pool

1321
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:58.290
unless they're trying to drown your child.
Um,

1322
01:21:58.291 --> 01:22:01.980
I hope that made sense.
I hope that didn't come off like an in a Fox News Way.

1323
01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:05.250
I didn't mean it that way.
Okay.
But I,
I do fucking exist.

1324
01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:07.590
I Dunno.

1325
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:11.670
In my own fucking reality sometimes in my shit doesn't come across the right
way.

1326
01:22:11.671 --> 01:22:16.620
So whatever.
Anyways,
you guys can ask me questions.
What I meant by that.
Um,

1327
01:22:16.621 --> 01:22:20.970
anyways,
uh,
dating services,
uh,
Bill,
what is your opinion on dating sites?

1328
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:26.460
I personally think it's a bunch of shit.
They advertised about how much,
uh,

1329
01:22:26.461 --> 01:22:30.780
they match people perfectly and show these happy couples who supposedly have

1330
01:22:30.781 --> 01:22:35.010
everything in common.
Um,
what if you don't want to be in this?

1331
01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.250
What if you don't want to be the same?

1332
01:22:38.251 --> 01:22:40.980
What if you want to be happy with someone who is dramatically different?

1333
01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:45.150
Those things are for people who have given up all those dating services or

1334
01:22:45.151 --> 01:22:49.110
people who have completely given up in life to the point that they have no human

1335
01:22:49.111 --> 01:22:49.771
contact.

1336
01:22:49.771 --> 01:22:54.510
So they have to sit in front of their computer by themselves to try and get
some,

1337
01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:59.610
wow,
that's a little harsh.
Um,
what do I think about?
Um,
um,

1338
01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:03.470
it depends on when I see him.
Sometimes I,

1339
01:23:03.471 --> 01:23:04.920
I see the commercial and I think they're,

1340
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.620
when I'm going through a rough period in my relationship,

1341
01:23:08.621 --> 01:23:12.250
I'm jealous of the people I see on TV cause they seem so happy and they're

1342
01:23:12.251 --> 01:23:14.800
playing that little zippy piano tune in the background,

1343
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:17.620
you know that e harmony and that girl goes,
Ooh,

1344
01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:21.900
<v 7>Ooh,
this good day.</v>

1345
01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:23.910
<v 6>Yeah.
Now the last day love.</v>

1346
01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:27.790
And there's like two people in argyle sweaters crawling all over each other.

1347
01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:32.170
Yeah.
Like it gets fucking annoying.
I'm so,
you know what I actually did?

1348
01:23:32.171 --> 01:23:35.400
I went to a,
I went to a dating site and I,

1349
01:23:35.401 --> 01:23:38.600
I'm actually going to check this fucking thing out here.
And um,
it,

1350
01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:41.050
it goes from creepy.

1351
01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:46.200
I don't know.
The window here seems creepy and nerdy.

1352
01:23:46.201 --> 01:23:47.730
And then there's just one guy on here.

1353
01:23:47.731 --> 01:23:51.270
You can tell he's just trying to pull some ass off of this.
All right,
here.

1354
01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:54.630
One guy starts with my darling.
I wished to be near you.

1355
01:23:56.010 --> 01:23:56.843
All right.

1356
01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.870
This guy's a psycho and he's got the classic sitting there with his fucking hand

1357
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:02.550
underneath his chin.

1358
01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:07.440
I simply wish to be happy together with favorite.dot dot.

1359
01:24:07.441 --> 01:24:12.441
I hope that I meet you here and we can be happy and to be one family.

1360
01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:18.270
I wait for your letter and then we can learn more each other.
Okay?

1361
01:24:18.271 --> 01:24:21.960
This is definitely a second language or this fucking Pussy Hound.

1362
01:24:21.961 --> 01:24:24.510
He's banged everything in his country and now he's coming over here with his

1363
01:24:24.511 --> 01:24:28.500
broken English,
going to a dating site.
I respect that guy.
All right.

1364
01:24:28.501 --> 01:24:33.090
Here's another one.
Seeing if Mr right exists.
All right.
First of all,

1365
01:24:33.091 --> 01:24:36.390
this girls smile.
Is she smiling like Erik Estrada?
You know,

1366
01:24:36.391 --> 01:24:38.910
when you know exactly how many teeth a person has in their mouth,

1367
01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:42.360
you shouldn't see somebody molars when they smile.
Anybody else?

1368
01:24:42.361 --> 01:24:46.980
Anybody else with that?
You should see basically teeth six to 11,
right?

1369
01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:50.220
Seven,
eight nine 10 11.
Yeah,
that's canine to canine.

1370
01:24:50.221 --> 01:24:54.720
For those of you who've never been to a dental office.
Um,
anyways,

1371
01:24:54.721 --> 01:24:59.100
this lady says,
uh,
I'm a fun,
outgoing girl who likes to try new things.

1372
01:24:59.130 --> 01:25:03.780
I'm loyal,
trustworthy,
friendly,
and caring.
I like to go out and meet new people.

1373
01:25:03.810 --> 01:25:07.590
I like to hang out at the beach and travel to places that I've never been to.

1374
01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.480
Rarely,
rarely.
Yeah.

1375
01:25:12.490 --> 01:25:15.540
Mean these,
these,
these,
these descriptions is,
are ridiculous.

1376
01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:19.680
I like all of those things,
but I'm also prone to fucking road rage.

1377
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:23.460
I accidentally punched my dog in the face the other day.
Did I tell you that?

1378
01:25:23.461 --> 01:25:24.420
This is actually true.

1379
01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:28.560
I was rolling around with Cleo right up fucking wrestling with her,
right.

1380
01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:32.700
Having a great time.
And she's,
she has a tongue,
like a fucking paint brush.

1381
01:25:32.701 --> 01:25:35.670
She looks you twice and you have to take a shower,
you know?

1382
01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:39.150
So she gets all excited and she wants to start licking my face.

1383
01:25:39.151 --> 01:25:43.710
So I kind of stuck my neck out to keep my head away from her and she brought her

1384
01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:48.890
fucking rock hard head up and hit me right in the throat.
I mean,
almost killed.

1385
01:25:48.891 --> 01:25:53.160
One was crushed my voicebox right?
I was,
and I was like,
Jesus Christ,
this dog.

1386
01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:56.760
I will say,
my God,
this,
do you believe how hard this fucking dogs head is?

1387
01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:59.010
She goes,
oh yeah.
She goes and like nothing affects her.

1388
01:25:59.011 --> 01:26:01.260
You could literally punched her right in the face and I wouldn't even bugger.

1389
01:26:01.530 --> 01:26:02.550
And I was like,
Oh yeah.

1390
01:26:02.551 --> 01:26:06.290
And I was trying be funny and I just Sorta threw a jab and I tried to pull the

1391
01:26:06.291 --> 01:26:08.960
punch,
but she moved her face right into it.

1392
01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:12.800
I punched her right in the face just like this,
this hard,

1393
01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:19.400
just like that.
And she didn't even flinch,
cheat,

1394
01:26:19.401 --> 01:26:24.290
even shake it off.
She just kicked,
continued licking my fist and I felt horrible.

1395
01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:29.210
Yeah.
I'm telling my story and I punched the dog in the face.
I was brutal.
Right?

1396
01:26:30.170 --> 01:26:34.460
It was an accident.
I said it was horrible.
All right,

1397
01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:36.510
let's read a couple more of these uh,

1398
01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:41.300
geeky Filipino girl looking for a sweet guy to spend time with Si that there's,

1399
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:44.600
that's,
if I was going to go on one of these sites,

1400
01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:47.600
I would more gravitate towards someone who actually kind of had a sense of humor

1401
01:26:47.601 --> 01:26:52.601
about themselves as opposed to someone who writes on this journey called life.

1402
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:57.380
I swear to God,
somebody wrote that.
I enjoy traveling and exploring new places.

1403
01:26:57.590 --> 01:27:02.300
So why not look online for someone to be able to share journeys together with,

1404
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:08.770
whether it's to a local museum or to exotic locales in distant countries?

1405
01:27:09.351 --> 01:27:13.190
Question Mark.
Jesus Christ.

1406
01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:17.840
He had every ha he had every hacky thing in there.
You know,

1407
01:27:17.841 --> 01:27:20.330
life being a journey,
going to a museum.

1408
01:27:20.630 --> 01:27:23.150
He had everything but talking about watching sunsets.
You know what?

1409
01:27:23.151 --> 01:27:27.980
Fuck that guy.
Um,
oh,

1410
01:27:27.981 --> 01:27:30.710
here's one guy.
The guy with little five o'clock shadow.
It's nice out.

1411
01:27:30.711 --> 01:27:34.340
We should do something.
Hi,
I'm Daniel.
I like being outdoors,

1412
01:27:34.341 --> 01:27:36.800
traveling photography and learning new things.

1413
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:40.130
A mellow and can be somewhat shy when meeting New People.

1414
01:27:40.131 --> 01:27:44.120
But I opened up pretty quickly with the right person and other words.

1415
01:27:44.121 --> 01:27:47.210
He's going to be a sweetheart until you get them alone in your fucking
apartment.

1416
01:27:47.211 --> 01:27:51.680
He's going to tear your clothes off.
Who is this person?

1417
01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:57.410
Um,
all right.
And search for a hand to hold me psycho.

1418
01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:01.850
Everything happens for a reason.
Good and bad.
Okay.
That guy's depressed.

1419
01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:04.460
I love and enjoy my life in La.

1420
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:09.410
I am looking for a partner who can be my best friend and share things together.

1421
01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:13.310
She looks creepy.
Uh Oh.

1422
01:28:13.311 --> 01:28:17.390
Here's one girl looking for a guy who's going to show her a good time and

1423
01:28:17.391 --> 01:28:20.630
appreciate her.
All right.
Her Dad didn't stick around.

1424
01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.240
She'll blow you easily within the first three hours.

1425
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:27.950
I'm looking for a genuine guy.
The best way to describe myself is,

1426
01:28:27.951 --> 01:28:32.420
is easy going individual on genuine,
down to earth.
You know,

1427
01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.490
these fucking people,
they're all full of themselves.

1428
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:37.620
Here's a guy just looking for fucking ass right here.

1429
01:28:37.621 --> 01:28:40.280
He's standing here in a Tuxedo.
Work hard,
play hard.

1430
01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:45.230
I am new to the South Bay and I have only lived in California for nine months.

1431
01:28:45.231 --> 01:28:48.410
I know when you're looking for some asked to tag,
here's the last one.

1432
01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.510
Beauty isn't only physical,

1433
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:55.460
but in Inter beauty plays a major factor.

1434
01:28:56.490 --> 01:29:00.350
All right?
That means she's a fat chick.
That's me.
But it's fucking true.

1435
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:05.140
She is fat.
Um,
all right,
let's plow ahead.
Well,

1436
01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:08.340
what's my feeling on those?
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
What I'm feeling is,
uh,

1437
01:29:08.341 --> 01:29:11.760
I would feel like a loser if I went on one of those.
Um,

1438
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:13.110
but I think the older you get,

1439
01:29:13.111 --> 01:29:17.490
the less you would feel like a loser unless you're just doing it just to get

1440
01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:21.420
more pussy than I kind of respect it,
you know?
All right.
There you go.

1441
01:29:21.421 --> 01:29:23.040
Was that ignorant enough for you?
Set the,

1442
01:29:23.041 --> 01:29:26.580
the usual level of ignorance that you expect on this podcast.
All right.

1443
01:29:26.581 --> 01:29:27.750
Sports Bill,

1444
01:29:27.751 --> 01:29:32.550
you talk a lot about sports and your podcasts and I enjoy your passion.
Um,

1445
01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:36.120
but for life,
I'm,
I'm from Australia,
but for the life of me,
I,
for the life of me,

1446
01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:40.080
I can't understand the appeal of American football.
When I was living in Seattle,

1447
01:29:40.081 --> 01:29:44.560
I went to a few Seahawks game and I found the game tedious as it stops start

1448
01:29:44.561 --> 01:29:45.990
nature totally put me off.

1449
01:29:45.991 --> 01:29:50.490
Do you think you need to grow up with the sport to enjoy it?
Um,
I mean,

1450
01:29:50.491 --> 01:29:53.700
I enjoy watching hockey and the occasional baseball game by just can't get into

1451
01:29:53.701 --> 01:29:57.090
American football.
I usually watch Australian rules football during the winter.

1452
01:29:57.930 --> 01:30:02.470
The best way to describe it as a contact version of soccer and basketball?
Um,

1453
01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:05.700
yeah,
I think you need to grow up with it.
I gotta be honest with you.

1454
01:30:05.701 --> 01:30:09.630
I went through a good five year period where I found NFL football mind numbingly

1455
01:30:09.631 --> 01:30:14.370
boring for the same reasons you're saying.
I just,
it's just stop,
start,
stop,

1456
01:30:14.371 --> 01:30:19.140
start.
Um,
I don't know.
I think,
I dunno,
I have add man.
I like hockey.

1457
01:30:19.141 --> 01:30:21.300
It just keeps going.
It just,
it doesn't stop.

1458
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:24.690
There's not 58 fucking timeouts.

1459
01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:30.030
Like basketball with the last four minutes takes two hours to play.
Um,

1460
01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:35.910
yeah,
I can see that.
I can see,
um,
cause like I,
I wasn't really into soccer.

1461
01:30:35.911 --> 01:30:37.080
I watched American soccer,

1462
01:30:37.081 --> 01:30:41.670
which is horrible because the crowd doesn't really give a shit or are the way

1463
01:30:41.671 --> 01:30:45.120
they broadcast it is,
it just,
it's just not presented well.

1464
01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:48.480
But when I watched like the premier league or something like that,
you know,

1465
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:53.160
oversee stuff and everybody's singing songs and got their scarves on and going

1466
01:30:53.161 --> 01:30:57.510
fucking bananas,
I actually can get into it,
you know?

1467
01:30:57.511 --> 01:30:58.201
And I liked that.

1468
01:30:58.201 --> 01:31:02.970
When there's 90 minutes it takes about 90 minutes other than the extra time for

1469
01:31:02.971 --> 01:31:03.840
whatever penalties.

1470
01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:08.460
But the one thing I don't like about soccer is anytime anybody gets barely

1471
01:31:08.461 --> 01:31:12.480
nicked in the Shin,
they fucking collapsed down to the ground.

1472
01:31:12.481 --> 01:31:15.090
Like they got hit by a truck.
It's like,

1473
01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:18.540
it's like the whole field is a bunch of poke assaults.

1474
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:21.480
That's what I can't stand about soccer.
And it's like,
dude,

1475
01:31:21.481 --> 01:31:24.430
you have on Shin Guards.
So I want to know for you,

1476
01:31:24.710 --> 01:31:27.180
anybody from around the world when you play soccer,

1477
01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:29.040
does it really hurt that much?

1478
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:32.760
I'm not talking if somebody got spikes on it and they step on your ankle,

1479
01:31:32.761 --> 01:31:33.960
I understand that that's going to hurt.

1480
01:31:33.961 --> 01:31:37.290
But when they kick you in the Shin and you're wearing shin guards,

1481
01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:41.520
do you really have to roll around on the floor like that?
Huh?

1482
01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:46.080
Like the fucking pussy that you are?
Um,
oh,
somebody sent me a funny email going,

1483
01:31:46.081 --> 01:31:46.441
hey bill.

1484
01:31:46.441 --> 01:31:51.441
Great point about nobody good looking being in England ever coming from England

1485
01:31:51.991 --> 01:31:56.310
and they said signed,
uh,
whatever that soccer player's name is.

1486
01:31:56.311 --> 01:31:59.860
Who came over here that no one gives a shit about.
And uh,

1487
01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:03.360
oh one who,
who's,

1488
01:32:03.361 --> 01:32:06.630

1489
01:32:06.631 --> 01:32:11.220
prostitute?
Hugh grant.
What the hell was that name?
Was that Linda Lavin?

1490
01:32:11.250 --> 01:32:14.730

1507

www.findingmygoddess.comnospacesfindingmygoddess.com.

1533
01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:14.690
Um,
Jesus Christ.
He's fucking putting it out there.

1534
01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:19.340
All right,
I gotta I gotta I gotta fucking wrap this podcast up.
Um,

1535
01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:20.860
what do I get to do here?
Um,

1536
01:35:20.861 --> 01:35:24.890
I'm going to get the punchline in San Francisco tonight for two shows.
This is,

1537
01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:29.690
this marks my triumphant return to the standup stage after,
uh,

1538
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:34.930
I have not headlined in Caroline's was,

1539
01:35:35.241 --> 01:35:38.300
no,
no,
I did the Improv out here in two months.

1540
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:43.430
So I did a quick set the other night at the comedy store.

1541
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:47.270
I got to tell you,
I,
I immediately,
the second I went in there,

1542
01:35:47.271 --> 01:35:50.750
I felt like I was at home.
You know,
I can't explain it.

1543
01:35:51.650 --> 01:35:54.920
I hope you guys have that when you walk into your job cause it's a great fucking

1544
01:35:54.921 --> 01:35:57.770
failing,
you know,
rather than going there and just being like,
oh my God,

1545
01:35:58.430 --> 01:36:02.510
when is this going to be over?
Not saying that never happens,
but um,

1546
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:06.770
yeah,
I'm psyched to,
to,
to,
uh,
to be back out there and,
um,
and like I said,

1547
01:36:06.771 --> 01:36:09.980
I'm going to be doing,
uh,
a standup special at the end of this year.

1548
01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:13.610
So I'm going to try to,
I'm going to try to do some clean live in here.

1549
01:36:14.150 --> 01:36:19.040
Plenty of water,
eight hours sleep.
No.
Who was no booze,

1550
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:23.480
no nothing.
Watching telly,
nothing.

1551
01:36:23.670 --> 01:36:27.620
Um,
see I just did a quote from a movie anyways.
Um,

1552
01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:30.230
let's do a couple of overrated,
underrated.
And then that's going to be,

1553
01:36:30.231 --> 01:36:31.010
this is going to be it.

1554
01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:33.910
I'm also going to be at the comedy works in Denver this week.
Uh,

1555
01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:36.290
I mean this month,
July 23rd,

1556
01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:39.260
24th and 25th and young Jo to Rosa,

1557
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:44.030
we'll be doing a number of my fall dates as I get geared up for my,

1558
01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:48.170
uh,
my,
my next special,
which I hope I will make special.

1559
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.731
You know,

1560
01:36:49.731 --> 01:36:54.500
I hope it's not just going to be yet another special yet another guy with his

1561
01:36:54.501 --> 01:36:59.300
wacky take on life,
you know,
here's some for you guys.

1562
01:36:59.301 --> 01:37:04.160
Like I really can't stand like the weird level of respect and disrespect that

1563
01:37:04.161 --> 01:37:05.420
standup comedy gets.

1564
01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:08.870
Like when you meet people and you tell them you're a comedian,
they always say,

1565
01:37:08.871 --> 01:37:12.480
oh my God,
I have so much admiration.
I,

1566
01:37:12.481 --> 01:37:17.270
I would never have the nerve to do that.
Right.
They always say that shit.
Okay.

1567
01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:21.440
But then whenever they write about standup or whenever they do what they,

1568
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:24.170
they're doing a caricature of a standup,

1569
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:29.510
it's always the most horrific of noxious like tables.

1570
01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:33.920
What's up with that?
You know,
they still like,

1571
01:37:33.921 --> 01:37:37.670
I think standup comedy is still suffering from the eight,
the,

1572
01:37:37.671 --> 01:37:39.410
the tail end of the eighties,
boom.

1573
01:37:39.411 --> 01:37:42.710
As far as people's idea of what it is.

1574
01:37:43.250 --> 01:37:44.780
Because for the life of me,

1575
01:37:44.781 --> 01:37:48.140
every time I read a fucking article about standup comedy,

1576
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:52.730
they always say this,
like recently I saw this article on Glenn Beck.

1577
01:37:53.150 --> 01:37:57.030
He's one of these,
uh,
well,
I don't know what you would call them.

1578
01:37:57.130 --> 01:38:01.170
They are like a celebrity journalists

1579
01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:06.870
personality.
They're like celebrity personalities.
They're kind of like,

1580
01:38:06.871 --> 01:38:09.600
who's that girl?
Waba Waba Waba go by.

1581
01:38:09.601 --> 01:38:14.601
And God blessed if like downtown Judy Brown did the fucking news that that's

1582
01:38:15.391 --> 01:38:18.870
what these guys are like this Sorta,
I don't know,

1583
01:38:18.871 --> 01:38:20.580
I can't explain what the fuck they are.
And you know,

1584
01:38:20.581 --> 01:38:23.550
they should be opening Hooters around the country.
Right?
So this guy,

1585
01:38:23.551 --> 01:38:26.900
basically Glenn Beck is going out and he's doing stand up.

1586
01:38:27.450 --> 01:38:30.650
So somebody asks him,
go,
Oh,
you're going to go out and go do stand up.

1587
01:38:31.110 --> 01:38:33.510
And he goes,
well he,
I mean,
I'm not going to be on stage going,

1588
01:38:33.511 --> 01:38:37.110
what's the deal with airline food at a local Yuk?

1589
01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:41.880
Yuks I'm actually going to be going out telling stories that at the end we'll

1590
01:38:41.881 --> 01:38:45.270
have a funny punchline,
you know,
something unique.

1591
01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:49.560
Something do something different.
Just like everything I did,
I do or whatever.

1592
01:38:49.561 --> 01:38:52.800
It's like,
Oh yeah,
I wish bill Cosby,
you know,
at some point in his career,

1593
01:38:52.801 --> 01:38:57.000
decided to tell a fucking story.
That was funny in the end,
you know,

1594
01:38:58.470 --> 01:39:03.060
uh,
she's fucking drives me nuts and what that fucking knit my whole career.

1595
01:39:03.210 --> 01:39:05.610
Nobody has done jokes.
I've been doing it 17 years.

1596
01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:09.480
Nobody has done jokes about airline food.
Nobody yet,

1597
01:39:09.481 --> 01:39:14.481
it is still defined by all those fucking guys dressed in their Miami vice sport

1598
01:39:15.131 --> 01:39:19.950
coats with the fucking sleeves pulled up that did jokes after joke after joke

1599
01:39:19.951 --> 01:39:23.940
about going to the dentist and about airline fucking food in safety.

1600
01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:28.860
I mean,
you're going on 20 years ago.
I mean,
if you want to make fun of stand up,

1601
01:39:28.890 --> 01:39:31.920
I understand because there's nothing worse than a bad comedian,

1602
01:39:31.921 --> 01:39:36.030
but at least updated,
you know,
say some shit like,
you know,

1603
01:39:36.031 --> 01:39:37.170
I'm not going to be up there,
you know,

1604
01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:42.171
doing tired material about Monica Lewinsky or even George Bushes and his fucking

1605
01:39:42.361 --> 01:39:46.280
old at this point,
you know.
But Geez,
enough with the fucking airline from,

1606
01:39:46.290 --> 01:39:47.123
nobody's doing it.

1607
01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:50.040
I saw one time they were doing a story on some alternative comic,

1608
01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.300
and I don't know if you've noticed this,

1609
01:39:51.301 --> 01:39:53.490
but whenever they do a story about alternative comedy,

1610
01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:58.050
they somehow have to trash mainstream comics.
I don't know why,
but they do.

1611
01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:00.510
And they're like,
yeah,
this is alternative comedy.

1612
01:40:00.511 --> 01:40:05.400
This isn't some guy in a mainstream club working out five minutes of material

1613
01:40:05.401 --> 01:40:08.020
about airline,
about,
you know,

1614
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:10.680
flying on an airline for his next Letterman audition.

1615
01:40:10.681 --> 01:40:14.450
Someone actually wrote that.
All right.

1616
01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:16.590
People don't talk about airline.
Okay,
we don't,
okay.

1617
01:40:16.591 --> 01:40:19.740
We still compare men to women,
but you know,
I'm just saying,

1618
01:40:19.741 --> 01:40:23.890
if you gonna fucking trash us,
you just have the decency to,
to,

1619
01:40:23.891 --> 01:40:25.620
to do a little bit of research.
You know,

1620
01:40:27.010 --> 01:40:30.510
I would love to go see Glen Beck and just start fucking heckle on them,
you know?

1621
01:40:31.890 --> 01:40:34.890
Anyways.
All right.
Uh,
overrated,
underrated.
Hey Bill,

1622
01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:37.830
here's my overrated for this week.
Rachel Ray,

1623
01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:41.070
she started out with her show on the food network called 30 minute meals,

1624
01:40:41.071 --> 01:40:41.791
which was fine.

1625
01:40:41.791 --> 01:40:45.750
She made tasty family meals that were easy and fast and she sort of put forth a

1626
01:40:45.751 --> 01:40:48.690
homey vibe.
Then she got another show and then another.

1627
01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:51.090
Now she has four shows on the food network,

1628
01:40:51.091 --> 01:40:55.840
half of which are just her eating food and countries saying Jamo and why the

1629
01:40:55.841 --> 01:41:00.700
fuck does she have her own talk show?
She is far from Oprah or even Tyra.

1630
01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:04.840
I'm sick of her acting like she's normal.
That she can relate to everyone.

1631
01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:06.220
Fuck you,
Rachel.

1632
01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:13.060
I don't think I have to add to that.
You really can't stand her.
Um,

1633
01:41:15.130 --> 01:41:20.060
I dunno if I was you,
I'd stop watching the fucking food network.
A watch.

1634
01:41:20.061 --> 01:41:24.040
Ah,
Mario Batali,
you know,
if you can get over his orange clogs.

1635
01:41:24.041 --> 01:41:28.720
He really cooks a lot of great food.
I'm overrated.
The fucking Jonas brothers.

1636
01:41:28.721 --> 01:41:33.580
How the hell are these no talent.
Douchebags famous.
While they're adorable,

1637
01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:39.040
they can play their own instruments and they are squeaky clean with their

1638
01:41:39.041 --> 01:41:42.130
virginal genitalia.
Anyways,
he goes,

1639
01:41:42.131 --> 01:41:47.020
I hope all three of these faggots get car bombed.
Jesus Christ,
Dude.

1640
01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:50.650
Um,
next,
uh,
overrated.

1641
01:41:50.651 --> 01:41:55.090
Those men are evil movies on lifetime.
I don't have to name them.
In other words,

1642
01:41:55.091 --> 01:41:57.040
you've never watched them,
but you know,

1643
01:41:57.041 --> 01:42:00.220
they saw come agreeing with year those shitty movies make me want to firebomb

1644
01:42:00.221 --> 01:42:03.520
the set of the view.
Like it's Dresden.

1645
01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:07.480
What does that to do with anything?

1646
01:42:07.481 --> 01:42:09.710
It says the peanut gallery where I'll tell you what it has to do.
A,

1647
01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:13.600
the view was a bunch of broads running their yaps who don't know what the fuck

1648
01:42:13.601 --> 01:42:15.730
they're talking about.
That's what he's trying to say there.

1649
01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:21.700
Because what does have to do with lifetime?
Because see what I did right there.

1650
01:42:21.850 --> 01:42:22.990
That is an old standup,

1651
01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:27.090
a skill that a lot of times the crowd can hear what the person heckling you
said.

1652
01:42:27.091 --> 01:42:30.580
So what you do is you repeat what they said.
What does have to do with lifetime?

1653
01:42:30.581 --> 01:42:33.640
Cause they always have those fucking movies about guys throwing women into

1654
01:42:33.641 --> 01:42:34.570
fireplaces.

1655
01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:41.020
Cause the views a bunch of women sitting around a spewing out there.

1656
01:42:41.021 --> 01:42:43.600
Their thoughts.
Yeah,
their opinions.

1657
01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:49.670
Yeah.
Cause it's a bunch of women.
It's really,
there's,

1658
01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:54.250
there's not a lot of layers to this.
Nia is basically,
he doesn't like lifetime.

1659
01:42:55.330 --> 01:42:58.300
Huh?
Don't use your real name.

1660
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:03.370
Well,
I told you I didn't want to put you in my top fucking 10.

1661
01:43:06.190 --> 01:43:10.570
All right,
well I can always edit this out.
No,
I can't.
I don't know how to use it.

1662
01:43:10.571 --> 01:43:12.970
I don't know how to use garageband.
Look,

1663
01:43:12.971 --> 01:43:15.190
if you don't want to be part of the podcast,
don't fucking chime in.

1664
01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:19.600
Don't chime in.
All right?
Okay.
All right.
See you later.

1665
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:24.100
All right.
Underrated.
Underrated.

1666
01:43:24.101 --> 01:43:28.540
Ak 47 [inaudible]
to most people.

1667
01:43:28.570 --> 01:43:32.410
I'm going to wrap it up.
My second AK 47 is to most people,
these are shitty guns.

1668
01:43:32.890 --> 01:43:36.370
The terrorist carry around and movies,
