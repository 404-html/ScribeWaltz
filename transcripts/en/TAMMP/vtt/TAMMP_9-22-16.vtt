Smile and nod.

7
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.060
<v 0>Um,

I'm taping this on a Wednesday afternoon.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.410

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.420

boom,
boom.
Um,

10
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.070
I'm actually not doing a comedy weekend.

11
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.800
This is a guys trip that I was going to do.
Uh,
because uh,

12
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.500
my lady,
my wife,
my lovely wife,
you know,

13
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.260
she went somewhere with the girlfriends earlier this year,
so I said all right.

14
00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:54.370
Yeah,
absolutely.

15
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.120
<v 2>Get out there,
have a good time.
Yeah,
you get all of that cause I know.</v>

16
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.890
<v 0>Then I got,
I got you.
I got an a sedan,
you know,</v>

17
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.380
whatever the fucking expression is and I'm just like,
you know,

18
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:08.190
I'm going to take a guys trip.
Where am I going?
None of your fucking business,

19
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.790
all you know,
is his great white sharks and involved.
All right.
Um,

20
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.950
and a lot of sunblock.
Um,
I'll tell you about it next week.
All right?

21
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:21.900
That's what they call an radio business.

22
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.520
That's called a teaser in the podcast business.
I don't know what it's called,

23
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:30.460
but,
um,
in the radio business,
as I learned from,
uh,

24
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.430
Greg Ob Hughes,
that's called a teaser.
It's a teaser.

25
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.110
Uh,
let's get down to what really fucking matters.
Uh,
the New England

26
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.993
<v 2>patriots,
yet</v>

27
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.850
to put it out there playing tonight.
They're playing them.
Houston,

28
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:49.700
Texas down there in Houston,
Houston,
Texas.

29
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.570
Get it near the Houston Texans from Houston,
Texas.

30
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.870
<v 0>Um,
yeah.</v>

31
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.580
Voted one of the fattest cities in America and they won the crown a couple of

32
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.440
years.
You know what I mean?
They didn't hold onto the title.

33
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.820
So they were sort of like a,
a,
I dunno,
Buster Douglas.

34
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:10.550
They were like the buster Douglas of fat people,
which is what you want to be.

35
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.840
You don't want to like own an error being that fat.
Right?
Let's see.

36
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.440
Let's check our in a Houston fattest city.

37
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.160
Let's see where they will see where they rank.
Let's see where they rank.

38
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:24.920
Can you tell like our third string quarterback is going to be in when I'm really

39
00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:27.830
just have to attack the fucking weight of the people there for years,

40
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:31.160
Houston has been hampered with the title of America's fattest city.

41
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.110
I stand corrected there.
The fucking,
uh,
they're,
they're,
they're the Mike Tyson.

42
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.430
Maybe not the Mike Tyson.

43
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:42.020
I would go more Larry Holmes of fat cities.
You know?

44
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.150
How long did Larry hold on for the title to the title?
Like 80 to 84 maybe.

45
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.640
He had a nice three four year run there,
if I remember.

46
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.630
But according to one report,
that accolade belongs to Houston no more.

47
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.180
The title of America's fattest city now belongs to Shreveport,
Bossier,

48
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.790
Louisiana.
A fucking city.
They're the fair,

49
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:08.350
that's like division two city as far as division one.
Wow.

50
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.380
That's,
that's,
you know what that does little Pale involved there.

51
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:11.861
You know what I mean?

52
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:16.300
Houston was just so sick of being called fat that they paid off the judges in

53
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:17.140
like,
you know,

54
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.470
if you still lose as Houston doesn't lose the fucking title to Shreveport,

55
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.800
Bossier City,
you did lose it to like Chicago,

56
00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:30.960
Los Angeles.
See a major fucking a team that has,
uh,

57
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.280
a city that has a football team.
That's what I say.

58
00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:36.770
You don't necessarily have to have a football team,
but you got to have,

59
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.150
you've got to have a major professional sport.
You know what I mean?

60
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.020
Sports team,
I would think so mean.
Who's can heal?
You're not,

61
00:03:45.021 --> 00:03:47.660
you're not a fucking major city.
You May,

62
00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:50.120
you name me one fucking major city,

63
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.620
one major fucking city in the United States of America that does not have a

64
00:03:54.621 --> 00:03:58.290
significant representation of,
uh,

65
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.350
professional sports and I will show you a be city.
Okay,
go ahead and do it.

66
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.270
I dare you.
Look at Portland,
Portland,
Oregon.
Not saying they're fat,

67
00:04:08.271 --> 00:04:11.540
but they got what?
They got a basketball team.
They're barely hanging in there.

68
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.780
What do they got?
They got the Portland Trailblazers.

69
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.320
They got hipsters in Portlandia.
That's all they got.

70
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.810
If one of those three things goes away,
that city is like bankrupt,
you know,

71
00:04:23.811 --> 00:04:26.630
with their fucking food trucks and everybody just,
ugh.

72
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.660
Some of the grossest white people you're ever gonna meet in your life is in

73
00:04:29.661 --> 00:04:32.810
Portland.
I don't know what,
uh,
what it is about.
You think it'd be Seattle?

74
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.500
You'd think they'd be more hippy dippy up there with all the fucking trees in

75
00:04:36.501 --> 00:04:37.334
the rain and shit.

76
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.640
But I'm telling you there's something about Portland and I'm not saying all the

77
00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:45.890
Portland,
I'm just saying most of Portland.
No,
I'm kidding.
You know what it is?

78
00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:48.110
I still harbor resentment at that fucking city.

79
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.010
Cause one time they had this fucking place that was like the best pizza in the

80
00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:52.844
fucking town.

81
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.360
He had to go across the god Damn River to where all the fucking hipsters are

82
00:04:56.361 --> 00:04:58.070
going around with their big mustaches,

83
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.460
driving the fucking tricycles with a giant fucking wheel acting like they don't

84
00:05:01.461 --> 00:05:03.050
realize there's better technology.

85
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.000
And I fucking go over there and the place was closed,
you know?

86
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:12.700
And I didn't go online like an asshole,
but I called the place,
you know,

87
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.970
that isn't good enough.
I just called the fucking place.

88
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.640
Somebody picked up,
hey,
you've reached fucking blah,
blah,
blah,

89
00:05:19.641 --> 00:05:21.800
or hours of this did and then what?
I forget what that came about.

90
00:05:21.801 --> 00:05:25.700
What the fuck it was.
And a,
I actually left a message,

91
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.300
I believe,
and I dropped a bunch of f bombs and shit.

92
00:05:29.301 --> 00:05:32.810
And then afterwards I was like,
why did I do that?
It's not Portland's problem,

93
00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:35.120
Bill.
It's your prom.
You fucking went online.

94
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.270
You saw with the good pizza places for,
but you didn't check the time.

95
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.320
So what did you do?
Not only did you curse him out in the machine,

96
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.370
you fucking turned around and you blame the entire fucking city when all you

97
00:05:46.371 --> 00:05:50.890
were trying to do was say,
Houston,
Texas has a bunch of fatties in it.
Um,

98
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.720
hey,
if you live in Houston and you're fat,
do you feel proud,

99
00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:57.340
like you're part of a gang or do you go,
do you feel shame?
Like God dammit,

100
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.880
I'm part of the problem,

101
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.883
<v 3>you know,</v>

102
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.900
<v 0>I dunno.
What are you looking at?
Clio.
You're freaking me out.</v>

103
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.430
One of the fucking dogs ears go up.
Then I wait and then she starts growler.

104
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.140
Houston's no longer the fattest fucking city

105
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.890
Amia.
Listen to this shit they said.

106
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:23.090
They say Houston's no longer the fattest city.
Right.

107
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.500
Come over here so I can talk to you.

108
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.840
I only got one microphone like a fucking asshole.

109
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.810
So they say Houston's no longer the fattest city.

110
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:34.430
Guess who they said they lost to
guess.
Guess what city they lost him.

111
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.240
He's done.
Who?
They lose two as the fattest city.

112
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.260
<v 4>I feel like it's gotta be somewhere in the south.
Is that correct?</v>

113
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:44.700
It is in the south.

114
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.430
<v 0>Yeah.
There's no money to stay.
Just throw the fucking city up.
I don't know.</v>

115
00:06:51.431 --> 00:06:55.660
Somewhere in like Mississippi or Louisiana.
You fucking nailed it.

116
00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.580
I stand corrected.
Shreveport,
Bossier city,
Louisiana.

117
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.370
<v 4>They got that good food down there.
So</v>

118
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.320
we got good food out here too.
Yeah,
but you know,

119
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.370
we're all concerned about Pilati is bodies and yoga and fitness and shit out

120
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:17.990
here in la.
That's not a priority out there.

121
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.470
<v 0>Are you saying that people in Louisiana want to be fat and I say that they want</v>

122
00:07:22.471 --> 00:07:25.920
to,
I think they just have different priorities.
Do you support the troops?
Yes.

123
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.120
I think it's fucked up that a city that small can beat Houston,
Texas.

124
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.990
Oh,
okay.
Well why don't you think they're like in a different way?
Class.

125
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.253
<v 3>Cool.</v>

126
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.170
<v 0>The fuck.
I never even heard it.
I've heard of Shreveport,
Louisiana,</v>

127
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:46.550
but Shreveport,
Bossier.
Do they combine two fucking cities?
I have no idea.

128
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.970
I think it was fucking with Houston's tourism.
So they fucking paid off the,
uh,

129
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.190
the people that go around pinching people around the fucking country and they
go,

130
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:58.740
listen,
man,
you've got to get this shit off of us.
They get to the conspiracy.

131
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.070
You don't think that's weird that they lost to that.

132
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.900
You think the people of Houston has somehow not a politician.
Politicians

133
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.020
<v 4>set up this,
this city,
Shreveport,</v>

134
00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:12.610
Bossier city in Louisiana and set them up.

135
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.680
<v 0>Alright,
here you go.
You know what?
I'm going to check,</v>

136
00:08:14.681 --> 00:08:18.640
I'm gonna check the record right now.
Fattest,
fattest cities

137
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.740
<v 3>last,
let's see.
We'll see.</v>

138
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.680
<v 0>I can't even spell last,
last 10 years.
Let's see what they say.</v>

139
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.990
A fitness fetish is cities,
the 10 most obese cities in America.

140
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:36.520
Let's just see what this one has.

141
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.020
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

142
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:38.890
<v 0>All right.
All right.</v>

143
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.950
There's a good fed guy standing and they never show the fate face.

144
00:08:41.951 --> 00:08:46.790
There's so much shame.
Jesus Christ.

145
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.900
All right.
I was wrong.
MEMPHIS,
Tennessee.
They've got a basketball team,

146
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.740
Shreveport,
Louisiana,
Indianapolis,
Indiana.
At a fucking cold fans.

147
00:08:55.741 --> 00:09:00.330
You fucking pussies.
Jackson,
Mississippi,
New Orleans,

148
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:05.280
Chattanooga,
Tennessee,
mobile,
Alabama,
San Antonio,
Texas,
Greenville,

149
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:09.480
South Carolina,
Little Rock,
Arkansas,
thinness,

150
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:13.050
metro areas.
La Isn't on that.
Yeah,

151
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:15.760
but it goes from 91 up to 100 wow.

152
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.570
How come they don't show the,
Oh,
I see.
I see.

153
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.890
Because it's all part of the same fucking list.
Yeah.

154
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:26.580
There's a bunch of fatties out here and yet,
like Hollywood is in show business.

155
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:30.660
Everybody else is in La,
right?
Yeah.

156
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:35.400
So that you know everybody's fucking chowing down on Thai food,
Burgers,
burritos.

157
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.280
It's a lot of Fatty Saudia

158
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.480
<v 2>in El.
I haven't.
Nice to see.
A lot of fatty is out here in la,
la.</v>

159
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.600
Not really.
What does la La to you like Los Angeles County,

160
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.320
<v 0>which is where?</v>

161
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.670
<v 2>I don't know.
Los Angeles County.
What am I?</v>

162
00:09:51.671 --> 00:09:55.060
A geographer?
I don't know.

163
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:56.780
<v 0>Yeah,
no.</v>

164
00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.770
You're talking about Hollywood and you're talking about Santa Monica and Venice.

165
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.510
You basically from,
from basically here to to lax.

166
00:10:05.511 --> 00:10:09.140
You don't see that many fatties but now I'm telling you,
you get out to the

167
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.250
<v 2>my main,
but that's because you're right,
because of Hollywood.</v>

168
00:10:12.251 --> 00:10:15.610
It's just not a priority.
You get up to the inland empire near,

169
00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:18.940
I'm telling you it's a shit show.
Is that I've never been to the inland empire.

170
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.440
No.
It's a shit show,
I e

171
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.610
<v 0>that's right.
All right.</v>

172
00:10:22.611 --> 00:10:24.980
There's only one camp was on the market was only one microphone.

173
00:10:24.981 --> 00:10:29.120
This isn't going to work.
Why?
Because it's just I gotta.

174
00:10:29.121 --> 00:10:32.330
I gotta do this like I'm fucking Merv Griffin.
Like a Dick Cavett or something.

175
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.250
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I can leave if that's what you,
is that what you're saying?
Well,

176
00:10:37.251 --> 00:10:38.240
I'm in,
I don't know what to do here.

177
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.880
I just feel like the podcasts is slowing down of a sudden it got really hot in

178
00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:45.080
this room because the AC is not on and all of a sudden you bring two people

179
00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:47.510
together,
sitting side by side.
It starts getting uncomfortable.

180
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.600
Maybe this is what people in Houston need to do.
Sit next to each other.

181
00:10:50.601 --> 00:10:55.000
Maybe burn some fucking pounds off.
All right,
so the thinnest metro areas,
um,

182
00:10:55.430 --> 00:11:00.200
I guess they just did 100 cities,
right?
The fattest city.
So the finish guys,

183
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:04.670
where I guess for 91 to 100 is Tucson,
Arizona,
Denver,

184
00:11:04.671 --> 00:11:07.600
Colorado.
Despite all the weed,
they gotta be shipping it out.

185
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.250
You figure what all the munchies they be getting up there.
They be getting,

186
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.810
they are getting,
I can stop watching your shows.
Colorado Springs.
It's true.

187
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.730
San Francisco,
California,

188
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.580
<v 2>Boston,
mass.
Get the fuck outta here,
Bud light kid.
Um,</v>

189
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.240
Sacramento,
California,
Los Vegas.

190
00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:29.241
Get the fuck out you or cause they got a bunch of tourists now there's a robot

191
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:34.140
up there.
They don't count them.
Tourists on the strip.
The Jean shorts.
Oh yeah.

192
00:11:34.141 --> 00:11:37.440
Maybe the people that work in the casino and not too many fatty is working in

193
00:11:37.441 --> 00:11:39.780
the casinos and stuff.
Now they starved those people.

194
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.900
Plus when you get your hand broken that many times for cheating,

195
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:43.800
then they make your work there.

196
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:47.580
It's really hard to get a sandwich up to your lips like it's not the movie

197
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:51.270
casino anymore.
Boise,
Idaho,
Reno,
Nevada,

198
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.350
and last Honolulu,
Hawaii.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.

199
00:11:55.190 --> 00:12:00.050
<v 0>Oh,
by the way,
I,
it's way worse now.
Now that the is run it rather than the mob,</v>

200
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.930
the mob,
all they took was the gambling.
The gave away the shows in the food.

201
00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:06.300
Now it's like the corporations,
they fucking remember back in the day like Vegas,

202
00:12:06.301 --> 00:12:08.600
she can get a steak for like three bucks.
She can't do it anymore.

203
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.800
You cannot do it.
Not even a Mcdonald's.
All right.
Yeah.

204
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.380
<v 2>We literally just taking everything from casino and applying it like you</v>

205
00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:21.040
actually know what you're talking about when it comes to the history of Vegas.

206
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.280
<v 0>Is that what I was doing?
I thought it was the Black Jack dealer.</v>

207
00:12:23.281 --> 00:12:24.990
Then I met the first time I worked out there.

208
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.110
<v 2>Oh,
was it bump?</v>

209
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.470
<v 0>I mean,
I've played that place like 20 fucking times.</v>

210
00:12:31.471 --> 00:12:34.200
You talked to all the old dealers.
I always go,
hey,
no,
it's not the same.

211
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.063
It's not the same.

212
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.830
And if you get just keep fucking work and that's what they end up saying.

213
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.810
Say we made me way more money when the mob ran it.
People having a better time.

214
00:12:42.811 --> 00:12:46.170
It wasn't the shit show of fucking kids with like the carriages and all that,

215
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:46.740
you know?

216
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.480
<v 2>Yeah.
But the mob was running it.</v>

217
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.620
<v 0>Oh,
so the,
the,
the what?
The corporations,</v>

218
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.210
all the corporations is there just on the legal side of stealing their,

219
00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.790
<v 2>oh,
I see.
Wow.
Okay.
When are you going to play there again?
Let's go back.</v>

220
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.250
I Love Vegas.
Vegas.
Really?

221
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:05.260
Every time you go there like three days and you're like,
oh my God,

222
00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:06.190
I gotta get Outta here.
Yeah.

223
00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:10.510
I mean I cap at three days in Vegas and then I can't,

224
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:13.060
I can't do anymore.
Well then what's the point of me bringing it out there?

225
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.800
Because you go for a weekend.
I get to come.
What?
What does,

226
00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.140
what are you talking about?
Well,

227
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:21.190
if you going to be all grumpy three days into one grumpy when I'm three days

228
00:13:21.191 --> 00:13:25.780
into what?
I have my fun and then I'm,
then it's time to go.
Go shopping,

229
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.750
go see a show.
I hate that part of it.
Okay.

230
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.820
I hate when you go and then I have to go shopping.

231
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.060
Who goes to Vegas to go shopping?
Oh my God.

232
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.780
Thousands of people go to Vegas shot kinds of people.

233
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.670
Like everybody that goes there.

234
00:13:39.671 --> 00:13:42.190
Why do you think they have all those stores in Vegas?

235
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:45.520
Because the cooperation's took over and they got all these bottom feeders that

236
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:47.610
want to fucking go around and buy something,

237
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:52.720
but dazzled Jean shorts don't wear for Dassel Jean show.

238
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.320
You call me a bottom feeder.
Everybody shops in Vegas,
Bill.

239
00:13:56.321 --> 00:13:57.460
It's a thing that happens.

240
00:13:57.461 --> 00:14:01.490
It's because you're in your little like cave of like you're in the room like Eh,

241
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.620
Eh,
for six hours and then you go on stage.
You're like,
wow,
wow,
wow,
wow.

242
00:14:05.621 --> 00:14:08.350
And that's all you know about it.
You're talking about,
I hit the gym,

243
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.600
I hit the gym.
Yeah.

244
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:13.810
You go to the gym and they'll put out by the pool and you're pacing around the

245
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:16.390
room.
Like,
I have something to eat.
I'd go to have a drink.
I can't.

246
00:14:16.391 --> 00:14:18.430
I mean I got to do a fucking show.
I gonna stay sober.

247
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.820
Well I'm letting you know that people go shopping.

248
00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:25.390
Like what are people doing for the most part when we walk around their shopping

249
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.900
there at the salon.
I used to be for adults near.
Okay.

250
00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:32.560
And you went there with your buddies and you met some broad,

251
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.200
I'm sorry,
correctly.
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:39.370
Did you participate in this heyday of Vegas that you seem to be like reminiscing

253
00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:42.550
over?
Cause I really don't feel like you were a part of it.
I wasn't.

254
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.210
So then what are you getting all fucking nostalgic about?
Oh,

255
00:14:46.211 --> 00:14:50.110
used to be you could do this and do that and get a shrimp cocktail for 5 cents.

256
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.860
Nobody cares bill.
No,

257
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:58.250
because I missed it because it was this great time and I missed it.

258
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.880
And then I went out there and it was just like every fucking place else should

259
00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:05.570
go to every fucking strip malls,
the same fucking 10 stores and instincts.

260
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.540
And I've done the road long enough to remember when you went to a city and it

261
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:11.150
looked a little bit different.
It wasn't forever.

262
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:16.070
21 the fucking cheesecake factory.
Starbucks and fucking whatever you,

263
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:17.660
Taco Bell.
You know,

264
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.760
I seem to recall a time when we were in Vegas and we went to the shops at the

265
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:26.720
crystal shops at the Aria and there was a particular store that you went into

266
00:15:26.721 --> 00:15:30.980
and you did some damage and you enjoyed it very much.
Do you not remember this?

267
00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:35.040
No.
What did I do?
Do you want me to say in the name of the store?
No,

268
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.550
but what the what?
The why once Jesus Christ,

269
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.270
it's like you're going to see me for rest of the day.
I did some damage.
Yeah,

270
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:45.080
you did.
Oh,
and I bear bought a pair of shoes.
You bought a few.

271
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.990
Remember there's no way about one,

272
00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:50.810
two pairs of shoes or you bought two pairs of shoes right?

273
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.470
Then let's not it back to that cause.
Well,
but it was at a particular place.

274
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.310
It wasn't like you at the men's Wearhouse outlet,
let's put it that way.

275
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.170
So when I had a fucking show to do it.

276
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.380
I'm just saying you're acting like you're so above the whole shopping in Vegas

277
00:16:06.381 --> 00:16:10.850
thing like I'm not talking about buying a for some fucking adult God damn shoes.

278
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.090
I'm talking about walking around in your flip flops with your giant fucking ads.

279
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:15.921
What's he call it?

280
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:20.921
The stupid long plastic drinks and you wacky hat and you're fucking Jean shorts

281
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.000
and none of the cons gamble anymore.

282
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.090
They all just walk around and fucking looking for a buffet.

283
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:31.130
It's like fucking seaworld without the captive animals.
It's the fat fucks.

284
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:33.920
I can't stand it.
It's terrible.
You don't like Vegas?

285
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.780
I don't like that aspect of it.

286
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.430
I don't like watching people pushing their fat fucking kids around in strollers

287
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.080
at three in the afternoon past a slots and I was like,
what the fuck are you?

288
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.300
Why are you exposing your kids to all of this shit?

289
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.200
The only people who still fucking throw down in Vegas or our agents,

290
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.350
they're the only ones.
They're not fat.

291
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.760
They go right to the gambling table and they fucking sit there all day and they,

292
00:16:58.761 --> 00:17:02.660
they get cleaned out or they fucking take the casino and then they go back to

293
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:05.300
their fucking whatever the hell.
Like you know the jets,

294
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.550
they'll do the only ones who do it right.

295
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.900
I have no idea how Asians do Vegas.
You never see those guys sitting at the,
the,

296
00:17:13.901 --> 00:17:18.290
the,
the,
what does that Kino and then the Burt baccarat tables,

297
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.250
whatever the fuck it is.
You know,
I don't gamble.
Whatever the fuck it is.

298
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.360
They were always in the high stakes from crushing it.
Every one of them.

299
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:30.980
Every one of them.
There's certainly not shopping,
right.

300
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.270
Well they're not shopping.

301
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.110
Can you have a little bit of fun Leah and stop turning everything to this

302
00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:37.780
politically correct.
We'll have,
sure.

303
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.350
There's was a little dude and if a book and plastic drink,
I'm sure any,

304
00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:45.710
I'm sure there was somebody from fucking Cuba in there too.
Plain,
Burt Bacharach,

305
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:50.050
whatever the fucking game is to say the tress.
Nice.
I'm trying to complement.

306
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.870
They dressed nice to sit down,
like gentlemen,

307
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.470
that women are back in the room with a fucking belong and then they sit there

308
00:17:55.471 --> 00:17:57.060
and they Campbell.
It's a wonderful thing.

309
00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.770
What are you think about Corey Hart and whatever and him,
Corey Hart,

310
00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.460
he wears his sunglasses at night.
Yeah.
What about him?
I Dunno.

311
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.790
It's a big week for quarries.
I figure I'd give him a shout out to,
oh,

312
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.710
are you talking about that Corey Feldman performance?
Yeah,

313
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:20.910
that was,
I feel bad for that guy.
I feel bad too because you laughed.

314
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.260
I giggled.
Sure.
Charcoal.
Charcoal,
absolutely.

315
00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:29.430
But the thing about it is he and his band or whatever it is,

316
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:34.580
they had a platform to do a show on a national performance on a national TV show

317
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.260
and you take it,
if you're an artist,
like that's what you do.

318
00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:39.380
You get the exposure,
you know,

319
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.540
I don't understand why that everyone's trashing him.

320
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:45.630
He's just up there doing the thing and like,
it's so funny,

321
00:18:45.631 --> 00:18:49.830
his relationship with Michael Jackson is still like so strong to this day that

322
00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:54.390
he's still doing the Michael Jackson moves that Michael taught him like so many

323
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:57.270
years.
Yeah,
but so is Michael.
Michael,

324
00:18:57.271 --> 00:19:00.950
did those moves probably for an extra decade,
too long,
wouldn't you say?
No,

325
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.230
he could do those forever,
but it's,
it's,

326
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.630
I dunno if she showed the socks a little bit too long.
If he ask me,

327
00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:07.960
well what was he supposed to do?

328
00:19:07.961 --> 00:19:10.770
All the kids some fucking pants to reach the floor like the rest of us.

329
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.240
He was on his own level and Corey was doing his thing.

330
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:16.650
I mean his band definitely,

331
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.540
they're dressed up like angels from like a party city costume angel.
They like,

332
00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:24.840
it's just,
it was a bad look for the rest of is set up.

333
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.890
He could've just had maybe a little set of mater.
You think they set them up?

334
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.690
They do that every fucking roast.

335
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:33.360
If you ever watched the roast on comedy central,
there's always like,

336
00:19:33.361 --> 00:19:35.190
what the fuck is that person doing there?

337
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:39.720
And what they are is they are raw meat because the person who's getting roasted,

338
00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:44.130
if you have to go seven,
eight ninth,
10th there's hardly any jokes left,

339
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.190
but they just bring somebody in there like Ann Coulter.

340
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.800
The last time it was like,
oh my God,
I can't believe.
I mean they were to her,

341
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.790
it was like she was,
she was that person.
Every fucking roast.

342
00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.650
They Kurt Cobain's wife.

343
00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:59.100
One time I remember carrot top took a pounding one time.

344
00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.850
There's always that one person who shows up excited like,
oh,
this is cool.

345
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:07.150
They invited me and then three minutes in,
Oh,
I'm this person.
Right?

346
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:11.220
Well that's what they did to Corey.
I'm sure he's fine.

347
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:16.020
Ultimately that they really need to book him.
They didn't.
Why did they book them?

348
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.031
They set them up.

349
00:20:18.031 --> 00:20:21.870
The whole thing was a fucking set up and now the dudes sitting in his bedroom

350
00:20:21.871 --> 00:20:23.820
with the curtains drawn and the fucking lights out,

351
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.740
they set them up from day one.

352
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.130
He was the Lee Harvey Oswald of fucking people who still do the robot.

353
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:33.870
I felt bad for him.
He'll be fine.

354
00:20:33.871 --> 00:20:38.760
He needs to book small little venues around La and people will come and see him

355
00:20:38.761 --> 00:20:41.520
there.
That's like want hipsters would go down there to laugh at him,

356
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.820
you know what I mean?
And not notice if the wax in their own mustache,

357
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.760
which she got going there buddy.
What do you mean you're be a beverage?

358
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.720
There have been a nice little,
a nice little nip.
Yeah.
You know I did.

359
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.040
I did Burt crushers.
Fucking uh,

360
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.920
200 podcast episode with Tom Segora.
Yes.

361
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.190
Um,
and I just had a theory about Miller high life bottles.

362
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:05.620
Like I refuse to believe that this 12 ounces of beer in here,

363
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.870
it looks like an eight ounce bottle.

364
00:21:08.871 --> 00:21:12.520
I don't know what the fuck is going on with this thing.
You have three sips.
God.

365
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:18.470
Wow.
Maybe you're just drinking them really bad ass.
No,

366
00:21:18.471 --> 00:21:21.020
but if I have a Budweiser,
it was like,
I feel afterwards,
I feel like,
wow,

367
00:21:21.021 --> 00:21:25.130
that was refreshing and felt like 12 ounces when I drink Miller high life.

368
00:21:25.131 --> 00:21:29.680
I'm like,
where the fuck did it go
down your gullet there.

369
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.840
You freckled fucking Pelican.
All right.
I'm going to finish this,
this podcast,

370
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.400
the questions,
the questions are on Monday and Thursday.

371
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:44.060
Thursday.
I just,
I'm just checking in on on,
yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Cool.

372
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.260
What do you want?
Anything you have to say to work in America?
Uh,
yeah.

373
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.450
Keep on keeping on.
I don't know.
Wow.
That was probably the,

374
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.990
that was the anti inspirational speech.
What do you mean it's Thursday?

375
00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:59.710
They getting paid today.
All they got is one more fucking day.
Yeah.
All right.

376
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:04.000
Have a good weekend.
I'm terrible at this.

377
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.560
I don't know.
You're all fucking rainbows and hearts.

378
00:22:07.561 --> 00:22:09.190
She's supposed to be positive.
What do you,

379
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:13.300
what do you got for America during an election year and Nia.
Oh my God.

380
00:22:13.301 --> 00:22:15.700
Just pressure.
Just don't,
just,

381
00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:20.220
don't screw this up everybody.
Yeah,
please.
Come on.
Let's all do our part.

382
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.520
You know what I'm talking about?
Hyping them for their weekend.
Oh,

383
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.370
I heard you were talking about the political clubs saying it's an election year

384
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.590
and these people need some Joe Sixpack near the gout dairy.

385
00:22:29.591 --> 00:22:31.800
He puts his pants on one leg at a time.

386
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.000
Everybody puts their pant leg on one leg at a time.
Not the way Joe six pack.

387
00:22:36.001 --> 00:22:39.240
Does it stop trying to act like somebody that works in blue collar is putting

388
00:22:39.241 --> 00:22:41.790
their pants on different than anybody else.
Give me a break.

389
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.713
We're all putting in bathroom.

390
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.300
Are you saying you don't support Blue Collar America?

391
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:49.950
I do support blue collar America.
I the poor blue collar America.

392
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.790
How do you feel about,
uh,
toddlers all love them.

393
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.340
What if they're going to grow up and be blue collar people?

394
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.800
Would you still love him then?
I love him even more.

395
00:22:58.801 --> 00:23:03.330
I'd buy them a little baby construction hat and the little metal lunchbox.

396
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.660
It's sick.
What if one of them is going to be a gay construction worker?
Oh,

397
00:23:06.661 --> 00:23:09.370
even better as it's sang in a band.
Yeah.

398
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.430
I'm still a guy who appropriated native American where?
Well sang about a gym.

399
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:19.770
Sure,
but showed his chest hair.
We're talking about the village people.

400
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.930
No.
Oh,
I thought that's what you were going.
No,

401
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.360
I was talking sung about the people who are going to rebuild the La memorial

402
00:23:26.361 --> 00:23:31.340
coliseum and a cop.
Well,
who are all the characters in the village?
People,

403
00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.540
all I remember was a cop,
the native American,
a construction worker,

404
00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:40.670
because there were all these like hyper masculine tropes.
Right?

405
00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:45.140
So they were all like,
no,
they weren't.
Those are legitimate fucking jobs.
Yeah,

406
00:23:45.141 --> 00:23:48.560
I know,
but that's what,
it's not a trope.
Okay.
Building a building,

407
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:52.710
leading the tribe against fucking Custer.
Oh,
rights.

408
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.670
And I'm just saying that they were all these like archetypes that they were

409
00:23:55.671 --> 00:24:00.520
representing.
They were the construction worker,
the cob at the police,
uh,
Indian.

410
00:24:00.521 --> 00:24:04.190
She disagree.
Disagree in 100% of those were gay men.

411
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.850
And I think what they were dressing up was their version of the French maid

412
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:10.640
outfit.
Like if they got a prostitute,

413
00:24:10.641 --> 00:24:13.280
like I'd have a French maid come over and they'd have a guy dressed up.

414
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:14.510
Like he worked at ups.

415
00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:20.350
I think I was reading something about this.
This is why I'm getting this from,
oh,

416
00:24:20.351 --> 00:24:23.800
so this isn't your idea.
Oh,
but presented as yours.
I fully,

417
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:25.900
I fully admitted.
No,
he didn't.

418
00:24:25.901 --> 00:24:28.840
You presented it for the last 30 seconds as though it was yours.

419
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:32.710
And then once I backed you into the corner with my Miller highlife fueled

420
00:24:32.711 --> 00:24:33.430
brilliance.

421
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:34.263
<v 1>Mm.</v>

422
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.270
<v 2>So what was the other,
what was the other person in skating?</v>

423
00:24:38.271 --> 00:24:39.500
The issue skirting issue there.
Okay.

424
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.650
Because I don't care anymore about arguing with you on this.

425
00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.520
When you take into toys home,
taking my ball and going,
I'm going home.

426
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.930
And we still gonna be friends tomorrow.
Yes we are.
Who was the other one?
Come on.

427
00:24:50.931 --> 00:24:55.520
Help me out.

432
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.940

I don't,
I don't know you can we look it up?

433
00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.540
I want you to do is just tell these people that have a nice fucking weekend.

434
00:25:18.541 --> 00:25:22.270
Next thing you know I got,
I got to figure out,
all right,

435
00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.080
let's have a bet here.
Up here.
This is a bet.

436
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:29.100
The closest without fucking going over,
you gotta be the closest to the job.

437
00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:35.610
Cop,
cop,
Indian,
Indian chief.
And what your guests.

438
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.390
God,

439
00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.870
village people.
Here we go.
Fire.

440
00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:54.060
I know I'm googling images.
Oh fuck.

441
00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.350
I see what it is.
You see what it is?

442
00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.630
It's a biker and all,
but there's also this guy,
oh wait,

443
00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:09.360
oh,
a share.
I almost said sheriff.
Where's,
what do you see?
A sheriff,

444
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:16.200
bye.
Or Indian?
Native American.
Nick cow boy.

445
00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.820
Cow Boy.
Have what?
Police officer.
Construction worker.

446
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.900
Army Guy.
I think that's the new one.
Not here.
He is the original idea.

447
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:30.300
You had the cowboy,
the,
the,
the native American chief had an army guy,

448
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.540
construction guy,
biker and a cop.

449
00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:37.530
I don't think anybody's having any more fun than the construction work.

450
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.080
Sometimes he's a sailor.

451
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.160
He's saying it was the same theme.
It's all these like

452
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.610
<v 0>manly men.
Yeah.
Likely heroes from movies and stuff.</v>

453
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.850
Yet they were all blown each other.
Right.
So America learned something,

454
00:26:51.851 --> 00:26:56.851
didn't they take that America and the YMC a all right.

455
00:26:57.401 --> 00:27:00.490
Nia,
I gotta I gotta do some advertising here at some point.

456
00:27:00.491 --> 00:27:03.880
So I also had some other shit that I wanted to talk to other than the jobs of

457
00:27:03.881 --> 00:27:08.430
the village.
Okay.
Well this has been fun.
So,

458
00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:12.060
oh,
you really wanted to do it.
All right,
I'll leave it down here.
Alright.

459
00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.560
I think we're going to talk about,
hey,

460
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:17.380
what'd you think about the red sox sweep in the Yankees in September?

461
00:27:17.381 --> 00:27:19.990
That never used to happen when I was a kid.
I haven't watched all year,

462
00:27:19.991 --> 00:27:21.640
by the way.
And we also have to play them against you.

463
00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:26.160
They've got a good squad though.
I fucking love it.
You fucking love it,
dude.

464
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.850
Goes thoughts.
Yeah,
I think we're like two,
three games up.
I have no fucking idea.

465
00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:33.290
All I know is we've won like a one,
four,

466
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.250
four in a row against the Yankees in the first two against the Orioles.

467
00:27:36.251 --> 00:27:38.740
So on a six game winning streak.

468
00:27:38.741 --> 00:27:42.250
And now if I keep talking about people going to say that I,
uh,
that I jinxed him,

469
00:27:42.251 --> 00:27:47.230
but here's the thing.
Thursday night,
this evening,
okay.

470
00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:52.600
Uh,
the Patriots are playing the Houston Texans.
All right?
And,
uh,

471
00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.440
if Garappolo it's still hard.
If he can't go,

472
00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:01.180
then Jacoby preset is going to be in from NC state.
But if he gets hurt,

473
00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:02.560
Adelman,

474
00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.970
our wide receiver who used to play quarterback of like Kent State or some shit

475
00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.780
who saw one pass is a prone,
it's like a 50 yard pass,

476
00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:14.230
the fucking Amygdala for a touchdown.
This is what bill Bellacheck is looking at.

477
00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:19.410
If he goes three and now he beats them and we're three and now he's the greatest

478
00:28:19.661 --> 00:28:21.850
fucking coach of all time without a doubt.

479
00:28:21.851 --> 00:28:26.851
When I love is that the colts with their little ticky tack fucking big babies,

480
00:28:27.281 --> 00:28:29.290
that they got their asses kicked by the Patriots,

481
00:28:29.291 --> 00:28:32.530
that they weighed the balls and they just kept pushing with this fucking

482
00:28:32.531 --> 00:28:36.310
suspension and they got to suspension and all it's going to prove is that

483
00:28:36.311 --> 00:28:37.660
they're fucking cry babies.

484
00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.450
And that Bill Bella check is the greatest head coach of all time.

485
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.200
When you think about that,
does any of that matter to you?
If it matter to you,

486
00:28:44.201 --> 00:28:49.060
honey,
then it matters to me.
I sound like the chicken coming to America.

487
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:52.660
Whatever it is you like.
What's your favorite food?

488
00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.660
Would you like?
You got to do the vow,
whatever.
Food.
July.

489
00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:00.790
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

490
00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.320
<v 0>All right,
so what?</v>

491
00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:04.440
<v 3>Ooh,
Ooh,
Ooh,</v>

492
00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.610
<v 0>oh hop on one leg.
I didn't,
I,</v>

493
00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.710
you know,
I didn't think she was that much of a looker.
You know,

494
00:29:11.711 --> 00:29:13.270
I can see why you would go to Queens.

495
00:29:13.271 --> 00:29:18.271
Dare say that about Vanessa Bell Calloway to it's fine as hell was every hot

496
00:29:19.361 --> 00:29:23.380
black chick in the 80s name Vanessa?
No does too.

497
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:27.010
There was the one who was in the beauty pageant who showed a tit Taiz and she

498
00:29:27.011 --> 00:29:31.060
got dethroned.
Yeah,
that's one.
Does that chick from coming to America?
No.

499
00:29:31.061 --> 00:29:31.980
Calloway.
Yes.

500
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:35.740
And then there was Vanessa bell at the time and then there was the other
Vanessa,

501
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.540
was there ever Vanessa much one bill?

502
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.890
Wasn't that the woman who played j sister and good times?

503
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.730
I don't know who that is in her character's name.
Vanessa.
I don't know.

504
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.490
Are you talking about the Huxtables and the Cosby show?

505
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.470
There was a Vanessa that was a character named I was a kid too,
right?
Yes.

506
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.160
It's creeping up now.
Just became creepy.
All right.
Yeah.
You know,

507
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.240
I don't know what it is.
He's not on here.
I'm struggling here.

508
00:30:01.241 --> 00:30:04.270
You know when they see on there is a way to have the AC on down here.

509
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.370
I don't know how to do that down here and I don't give a shit.

510
00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.070
Do you want me to do it?
Nobody knows something.
I was clearing out,
you know,

511
00:30:09.071 --> 00:30:11.020
cause it basically,
you know,

512
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.430
they're redoing our kitchen so they found this fuse box and it's like this
cloth.

513
00:30:15.431 --> 00:30:19.810
The Guy said that our fusebox was from the Christopher Columbus days and I

514
00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:20.740
laughed and I said,

515
00:30:20.741 --> 00:30:25.540
I knew when you went into that fucking wall that that's what was going to be in

516
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:29.230
there.
So I had to move all this shit off the bookshelf from the other side.

517
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.420
And now all of it though,
or just part of it,

518
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:35.700
all of the I three of the four things,
you know,
you know,

519
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:40.090
it's funny on the bookshelf that very few books,
it's all magazines,
right?

520
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.760
All my drum magazines,
I am,

521
00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.250
I just tapes from the 80s they need to get rid of.

522
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.830
I do.
There's a lot of shit I got to get rid of.

523
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.640
Do you know I have modern drummer,

524
00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:56.670
like I have a box of all bunch of modern drummers from like 1982 to like 1993.

525
00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.690
So here's my question for drummers out there.
Then I have up,

526
00:31:01.691 --> 00:31:05.050
then I stopped from like 95 to 2000.

527
00:31:05.051 --> 00:31:08.890
Then I have like everyone from 2000 to now and I'm thinking of just getting rid

528
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:10.510
of them cause I never go back and look at it.

529
00:31:10.511 --> 00:31:12.070
But I know that are people that collect them.

530
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.540
So I think I'm going to get rid of them.

531
00:31:13.541 --> 00:31:17.170
But the ones from 83 to [inaudible] 92 I'm keeping those.
Yeah.

532
00:31:17.171 --> 00:31:20.120
Cause like I get some old,
like Steve Jordans.
I got to Vinnie,
Kali,
Uta,

533
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:25.030
I got to fucking Stuart Copeland.
Yeah,
I got an Alex van Halen one.

534
00:31:25.031 --> 00:31:26.950
What are you going to take?
I got to Phil Rudd.

535
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.630
I got a Tommy Lee when he was still teasing up his hair.
But do you,

536
00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.000
where are you going to take them?
I've got to Phil Collins.

537
00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.170
They're going to a music,
Simon Phelps.

538
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.483
<v 3>The goodwill.</v>

539
00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:43.390
<v 0>Uh,
I've got Chris Slade.</v>

540
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:48.250
What did they come to the goodwill or do you take him to like a a music shop?

541
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:52.710
Like an old drum shop?
I would put them up on Ebay and uh,

542
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.173
<v 3>people would</v>

543
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:58.010
<v 0>like people bid on that Shit,
don't they?
I got a bunch of those,</v>

544
00:31:58.011 --> 00:32:01.730
a bunch of old drum magazines.
The ones that I really liked,

545
00:32:01.731 --> 00:32:03.980
the interviews that I like and I liked their drum kits and shit.

546
00:32:03.981 --> 00:32:08.090
Like a lot of Alex van Halen ones.
Those ones that I keep,
but they all the ones,

547
00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.480
there's a bunch of people from back then I can look at Jeff Porcaro.

548
00:32:11.481 --> 00:32:15.860
I got a lot of cool ones from way back in the day.
All right,
Ebay.
Here we go.

549
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:21.020
Am I boring?
You

All right.

554
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:45.170
Modern drama.

555
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.510
Who was on the cover of the first one?
Yeah,

556
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:53.810
Tommy Lee.
Now.
It was 1978 Tommy,
he was still living at home,

557
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:58.200
buddy rich?
No.
Oh,

558
00:32:58.201 --> 00:33:01.200
Jesus says there's a John Bonam.
When I have that one.
That one's what?

559
00:33:01.201 --> 00:33:04.800
49 nights where it's 50 bucks animal from

560
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:10.310
<v 4>the doctor teeth and the electric company or whatever that band is called or any</v>

561
00:33:11.491 --> 00:33:15.120
of these guesses.
Right.
Have they ever put animal on the cover weight?

562
00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:16.650
Have they ever,
whoa.

563
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:20.510
<v 0>Collection of modern drummer magazine,
260 issues.</v>

564
00:33:20.511 --> 00:33:25.511
320 copies from 1978 to 2005 500 bucks.

565
00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:31.150
No one's buying that the fuck you talking about $500 for the whole whack

566
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.430
<v 4>from 1978 to 2005 yeah,
it's like a dollar each.
All right as well.</v>

567
00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:40.610
So you got somebody is really going to spend that much.

568
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.580
Oh look at this old June,

569
00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:48.580
1978 the month and year I was born Hustler magazine for nine 95 Oh,

570
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.030
that's a famous cover that people hate.
Wait,
click on that.

571
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:58.640
The Hustler magazine from June [inaudible] 78 which is when I was born.

572
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:00.860
Yeah.

573
00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.620
<v 0>Oh,
he says we will no longer hang women up like pieces of meat.</v>

574
00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.680
I didn't know that they have this woman getting put into a hamburger grinder

575
00:34:08.681 --> 00:34:11.560
that that's,
that's just deliberately just steering into,

576
00:34:11.561 --> 00:34:13.720
try and be in shock and you know,
yeah,

577
00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.460
I'm sure they really didn't do that to somebody.

578
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.870
<v 4>I don't think so either.
All right.
This,</v>

579
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:24.050
did they ever put animal on the cover of modern drummer magazine or as modern

580
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:28.520
drummer magazine,
too serious of a magazine to do and that's have fun with that.

581
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.030
<v 0>I don't recall them ever doing that,
but a lot of,</v>

582
00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:34.520
a lot of people have used animal as a reference,
like his five,

583
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:39.140
like they put animal on the cover and then they profile the person who does like

584
00:34:39.141 --> 00:34:42.440
the music for when they do animal monitor magazine.

585
00:34:42.441 --> 00:34:44.420
I think I'm onto something with this,
but as,

586
00:34:44.421 --> 00:34:47.960
I don't know that they ever did that.
Animals too dated maybe.
Yeah.

587
00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:51.050
I don't know that they ever did that,
but it was a lot of people that,
uh,

588
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:55.820
I remember the guy from God smack said,
you know,
that he was an influence.

589
00:34:55.821 --> 00:35:00.560
This is all vibe.
He was a fucking loan to tick.
Um,
so anyways,
look at,

590
00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.360
I've got to do some advertising here near,

591
00:35:02.361 --> 00:35:04.340
this is basically the end of the podcast.
Oh,

592
00:35:04.341 --> 00:35:07.760
I finally saw highlights of the Singapore,
a Formula One race.

593
00:35:07.761 --> 00:35:11.060
They did it at night.
Now I've got that recorded back at the house.

594
00:35:11.061 --> 00:35:13.700
I hope now that they shut off the power that I'm not going to lose all of that.

595
00:35:13.701 --> 00:35:17.300
But the race is actually at night.
And Nico Rosberg one again,

596
00:35:17.301 --> 00:35:20.510
he's won the last three.
He wanted that one.
He went to Italy.
Anyone Belgium.

597
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:24.470
Pretty fucking killer.
How'd you go back to Singapore in order to see that?

598
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.570
Absolutely.
What an animal would do a show at a great shoulder.
Yeah.

599
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.840
I love Singapore.
Yeah.
It was too sterile for you.

600
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:34.860
You know how I feel about Singapore?
Yeah.
It wasn't my favorite place.

601
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

602
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.130
<v 0>You just thought it was too,
too rigid?</v>

603
00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:42.790
<v 4>I did.
I thought that it was a,
well,</v>

604
00:35:42.791 --> 00:35:47.320
what I've said is out of hand sanitizer were a country,
it would be Singapore.

605
00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:52.270
So it was just a little too clean.
It was a little too perfect.

606
00:35:52.271 --> 00:35:55.000
It was sort of like everything is part of everybody that got a spanking,

607
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:59.770
but at what cost?
Yeah,
exactly.
Like it just seemed like,
I don't know,

608
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:04.270
it was just,
it was,
it was,
uh,
I made me,
I should give it another chance,

609
00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.310
but I just didn't feel entirely,
I wasn't,

610
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.060
<v 0>yeah,
maybe just,
just stay here in la.
Yeah.
I don't,
I don't need,
you know,</v>

611
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.090
fly all around to these places and you're going to complain about it.

612
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:17.070
<v 4>We went to Hong Kong after what?
I loved.
Hong Kong.
Hong Kong.
Dope.
Singapore.</v>

613
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.500
Yeah.
This wasn't my vibe.

614
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.810
<v 2>You didn't have to say that.
Okay,
well you asked me,</v>

615
00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.610
so what,
what are you going have tense about?
Yep.

616
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:28.603
<v 4>You know what?</v>

617
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:35.300
I swear to God when you do that gas lighting,

618
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:40.220
what does that is that thing?
Where is that being weird?
Okay.

619
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.690
Yes,
yes,
yes.
It's that thing where you,

620
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:48.190
you throw something out at somebody they react to and you were like,
yeah,

621
00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.090
<v 2>Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
What's the problem?</v>

622
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:55.020
<v 4>Make them think that they're crazy.
You do that to me.
If I should a deal like a,</v>

623
00:36:55.021 --> 00:36:55.410
do you like it?

624
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:58.170
<v 0>Cantaloupe.
You're like,
I never want to know fucking candle up again.</v>

625
00:36:58.171 --> 00:37:00.210
I have a right to be like,
whoa.
Hey,
it's just a fruit

626
00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:04.260
<v 2>that happens.
You're doing it again.</v>

627
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:09.530
You're the king of gaslighting you.
You make me think I'm crazy.

628
00:37:09.531 --> 00:37:10.520
You bring up something

629
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.900
<v 0>I don't believe in Kingston.
Yeah,
I think we're all the same.</v>

630
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.720
I think we're all the same.
I don't think there are kinks.

631
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.990
I think we're all citizens.
Thanks.

632
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.760
Why don't we just said I was the king of gas lighting.

633
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:22.920
I just saying I'm just just a citizen.
Yeah.

634
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:24.143
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

635
00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:29.300
<v 2>You do do re do divide a lot of people into groups.
Yes.</v>

636
00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.490
<v 0>That's the only way to get out.
Then you just have to stare into it.</v>

637
00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:37.670
Like if you ever get on like CNN or Fox News and their bill O'Reilly Web.

638
00:37:37.671 --> 00:37:41.950
Who's CNNS bill O'Reilly,
the guy with the and Cooper.
Yeah.
Yeah.

639
00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:46.570
When they back into the corner.
So you saying you don't like babies or ice cream,

640
00:37:46.571 --> 00:37:49.980
you know it's gotta be like,
yes.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

641
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Terrible on those shows.

642
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:55.290
<v 4>I ain't get off lesser nights and giggling and it wouldn't be good at those.</v>

643
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:59.320
Those talking head things,
those making those serious political

644
00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:00.270
<v 2>points now.
Yeah,</v>

645
00:38:00.271 --> 00:38:03.300
but that's only because you don't know what you're talking about.
Oh,
thank you.

646
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:06.480
Well,
that's maybe a little bit,
you don't,
we don't watch the news.

647
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:11.220
I do watch the news.
You don't read.
Excuse me.
I do.
What do you read?

648
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.000
The newspaper?
You never read a newspaper?

649
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:18.660
<v 4>I read the newspaper online.
I don't read like the physical newspaper.</v>

650
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:20.820
Andy Cohen daily.
No,

651
00:38:20.821 --> 00:38:25.821
I go to fucking the New York times.com cnn.com and take your hand off your

652
00:38:26.431 --> 00:38:28.230
hip.com.

653
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.770
<v 0>Well,
I don't ever see it.
Yeah.</v>

654
00:38:31.771 --> 00:38:34.740
You know when we sit there and we eat quietly and you didn't see the sign of our

655
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:37.540
silverware hitting the plate,
you never just say,
hey bill,

656
00:38:37.541 --> 00:38:41.410
do you know in Indonesia,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

657
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.860
<v 2>No,
we don't really do we talk a little bit about current events?</v>

658
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.560
What do we talk about at dinner?
Nobody cares.

659
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:52.740
This is all about me trashing you for no apparent reason and gaslighting me.

660
00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.710
<v 0>Do you remember what that means?
I know what a guest ladies.</v>

661
00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.400
<v 2>I know.
Gino.
The understand what I mean?</v>

662
00:39:01.401 --> 00:39:04.460
Make them a New Orleans because the gas light somebody,

663
00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:09.020
did they make them in the fattest city in the world?
No.
New Orleans,

664
00:39:09.021 --> 00:39:10.250
New Orleans is definitely getting there.

665
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.430
<v 0>My experience,
fattest airports I've ever been to.</v>

666
00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.280
Okay.
Lax Bunch

667
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:21.430
<v 2>of tourists coming through really wider lens through.</v>

668
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:25.300
They want to go see Walt Disney's fucking castle.
Yeah,
they do.

669
00:39:25.301 --> 00:39:29.740
They want to put on their fucking mouse ears and fucking ever a cheese steak

670
00:39:29.741 --> 00:39:33.760
wrapped in cotton candy and just shove it down their throat and then blame

671
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:36.610
somebody else for their obesity.
You know what I mean?
You have though.

672
00:39:36.611 --> 00:39:38.350
You totally have the fucking power.

673
00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.050
<v 0>This is when you know you're getting fat.
When you put salt in your cantaloupe,</v>

674
00:39:42.051 --> 00:39:44.240
it's just like,
can you just eat the fruit?

675
00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.360
<v 2>It's people wrap her shooto into cantaloupe.</v>

676
00:39:48.361 --> 00:39:51.070
It's like he can't even have a piece of fruit without the wrapping and fake it.

677
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:55.350
Like you can get that in Italy.
Prosciutto in Milan.

678
00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:59.340
It's like a thing that they do.
Don't ever say Malone again.

679
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.800
It's Milan sailing in American Milan,

680
00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.090
Milan load change stone.
Is that how they say in America?

681
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.700
Prosciutto and melon is a thing that you can get an Italy.

682
00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.370
It's not an a fat American thing

683
00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:15.760
<v 0>at all.
So wrong.
All right.
Try it again.</v>

684
00:40:15.761 --> 00:40:19.780
Yeah.
All right.
You know what,
Neil,
I think this is the end of the podcast.

685
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:24.100
How about that?
We're just checking in on you.
They need to read some advertising.

686
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:25.510
Yeah,
but it's not here yet,

687
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:28.870
so I want to do it on my phone and now I have to go look at a episode

688
00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.630
<v 2>eight and 10 of season two of afters for families coming together.
Nini.</v>

689
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:36.450
It's going to be really,
I think it's going to be funny.
We'll see.

690
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.640
We'll see what the people say.
They're um,

coachable time.
Head coach of all time and a red sox.
Keep winning.

it's a great time of year near get involved.
Stop watching those real housewives.

696
00:41:01.491 --> 00:41:06.491
There's nothing real about them near other than the sad look in their botox

697
00:41:06.801 --> 00:41:10.280
frame dies.
There was look sweaty.
This shiny faces.

698
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:13.790
<v 2>God is she gonna Puca to,
she literally puked up a cactus today.</v>

699
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:17.660
It's higher like hundreds of blades of grass.
Yeah.

700
00:41:17.661 --> 00:41:20.750
And you found it and then you try to drag me into it.
Oh my God.

701
00:41:20.751 --> 00:41:24.580
Look what she did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We'll pick it up.
Oh,

702
00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:28.720
And I cleaned it.
All I asked you to do was to put it on the fucking balcony.

703
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:32.350
So good air out in the sun rug cleaning.
Yeah.
What a fuck the one,

704
00:41:32.351 --> 00:41:36.770
what am I going to do?
Because I needed your help to do it.

705
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:39.840
That's why I fucking ridiculous.

706
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:43.340

707
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.560
I don't go down the hall.
Oh my God.

708
00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.690
Yeah,
I can believe it.
The dog eats grass like a fucking cow for whatever reason.

709
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.830
And now that we brought that up,

712
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.490

738
00:43:44.301 --> 00:43:46.980

w.com/bird all right,

744
00:44:07.641 --> 00:44:10.370
lastly,
but not leastly legal zoom.

745
00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:15.120
You've heard the expression time is money,
right?
No.

746
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:17.160
Well where the fuck are you been?
Cause it's true.

747
00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:20.220
Especially when you run a business.
You can't afford to waste time taking.

748
00:44:20.221 --> 00:44:24.480
You're taking care of your legal needs.
That's why you need to use legal zoom.

749
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:28.530
If you work with the typical attorney,
they'll charge you for their time.

750
00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:31.020
It's called the billable hour and a lot of the,

751
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.230
they won't tell you how long it will take.

752
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:37.380
Take an advance that's called the fuck over.
But legal zoom is different.

753
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:38.730
They're not a law firm.

754
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:43.790
They spent the last 15 years is making sure you get the most of your time.

755
00:44:44.271 --> 00:44:44.611
Yeah,

756
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:49.380
and by building a useful website paired with amazing customer support for

757
00:44:49.381 --> 00:44:51.000
efficient help and if you need advice,

758
00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:54.780
legal zoom works with independent attorney licensed in 48 states.

759
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:59.810
Fuck Alaska and Hawaii attorneys who are more focused on helping you than

760
00:45:00.121 --> 00:45:03.780
logging billable hours.
That's why millions of people have trusted legal zoom.

761
00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:07.710
You can expect quality legal help on your schedule and flat fees instead of

762
00:45:07.711 --> 00:45:10.800
expensive hourly rates and invest your time and money.

763
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:14.880
Then your business and use legal zoom for the legal stuff and save even more by

764
00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:17.850

But you are in the referral box at checkout.

765
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:22.070
That's legal zoom.com yeah,

766
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:27.670
<v 6>so [inaudible].</v>

767
00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:59.880
<v 0>All right.
[inaudible] first thing first.
I'm over 21 years of age,</v>

768
00:45:59.881 --> 00:46:02.250
so no worries about giving advice to sit to a minor.

769
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:06.480
Recently my wife approached me and that's why we don't have a kegerator.

770
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:09.990
He's got a good one here.
He goes,
needless to say,

771
00:46:09.991 --> 00:46:11.520
within minutes of that statement,

772
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:16.050
we now are the proud owners of a new kegerator and seeing as how I've been

773
00:46:16.051 --> 00:46:21.051
married for eight years and this is the first time she's ever given approval for

774
00:46:21.091 --> 00:46:25.110
a purchase prior to me buying it.
I'm pretty excited about this.

775
00:46:25.111 --> 00:46:26.820
How do guys get themselves in that situation?

776
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:30.390
Unless she's making all the money and you've got to go to her for cash,
right?

777
00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:33.270
Yeah.
I mean she seems cool unless she's got a drinking problem,

778
00:46:33.271 --> 00:46:36.870
but that's awesome.
Yeah,
and I,
you know what,
I didn't even think of that.
Anyways,

779
00:46:36.871 --> 00:46:37.470
however,

780
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:41.730
I really need some advice as to what kind of beer I should keep it stocked with.

781
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:43.860
Choosing the right beer is key to the process.

782
00:46:43.861 --> 00:46:48.000
I'm afraid if I buy something like Amstel light,
all my friends will know.

783
00:46:48.001 --> 00:46:50.520
My wife wears the pants in the family.
That's hilarious.

784
00:46:50.521 --> 00:46:55.170
Cause he gets the calories less calories here.
Um,
if I buy us a stronger,
thicker,

785
00:46:55.171 --> 00:46:57.570
more manly beer like Newcastle or Guinness,

786
00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:02.160
I may also have to buy a wheelbarrow to wheel my friends out of the basement on

787
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:04.860
weekends.
And I really don't need that level of responsibility.

788
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.980
I can't do anything like Miller lite or course chords.
Like,

789
00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:11.610
cause I might as well hook the tap up to the faucet.
That's true.

790
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:13.950
That's very true.
I said a long time ago,
the cores light,

791
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:18.270
that's like vitamin water for alcoholics.
Like all my friends.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just,

792
00:47:18.271 --> 00:47:20.220
you know,
I'm on the wagon,
I'm on the wagon.
You're like,
dude,

793
00:47:20.221 --> 00:47:23.160
you're fucking drink.
It has cost life.
Um,

794
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:26.760
I narrowed it down to those seconds or Labatt blue.

795
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.880
The only thing with love black blue would be if any French Canadians find out

796
00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:32.350
I'm fucked because you know,

797
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:36.520
those bastards would be knocking on my door seven days a week.
Uh,

798
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:39.640
what do you think,
Paul?
If you had to get a Kegger rater f if you had to get a k,

799
00:47:39.641 --> 00:47:41.860
it sounds like this guy doesn't want to go domestic.
Uh,

800
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:46.420
but he also doesn't want to go really fattening Sam kill Sam Adams.
Yeah,

801
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:51.820
Sam Kid.
Maybe a nice parallel.
I would go,
uh,
I would go,
I would just go classic.

802
00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:54.880
It's a keg.
It's a fucking keg.
I would go pod rises.

803
00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.370
That's such a weird thing for your wife to just purchase it.
Like to be like,

804
00:47:57.371 --> 00:47:59.980
yeah,
you know what I got to like,
that's,
that's pretty fucking cool.

805
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:03.610
That's beyond cool.
That's weird.
Almost like Stacie came home,
I would just be,

806
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:06.220
yeah,
I've got this big wine rack.
I'd be like,
yeah,

807
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:09.530
she starts doing like little keg raters.
Headstands you know,
like,
you know,
they,

808
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:11.470
you know,
they did that,
but you have girl pushups.

809
00:48:11.471 --> 00:48:14.410
She does like the girl version of what fucking keg stand.

810
00:48:14.411 --> 00:48:16.120
What period would you put in there?
I get,

811
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:20.800
I get Budweiser because that's like a classic like who's going to come home?

812
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.650
What are you gonna come home like norm on cheers.

813
00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:25.450
He just can start pouring yourself a big mug of beer,

814
00:48:25.451 --> 00:48:26.470
you're going to be a tub of shit.

815
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.860
So I figured the only time you're really going to be porn like that is if you

816
00:48:29.861 --> 00:48:30.970
have guys over for the game.

817
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:35.530
Budweiser is a nice middle of the road that everybody's going to like you drink.

818
00:48:35.531 --> 00:48:37.390
But at the game it's not,

819
00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.210
it's not one of the Light Beers shitting out like now that I'm like,
you know,

820
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.780
33 years old and stuff.
So my metabolism is obviously slowing down,

821
00:48:43.781 --> 00:48:45.910
but I gotta be honest with you,
man.
When I drink three beers,

822
00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:50.980
I feel like a fucking fat bloated.
I could feel my tits getting bigger.
I could.

823
00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:54.930
You're about ready to entry.
Enter your whiskey and Scotch years.
Yeah,
I think so.

824
00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:57.880
Do you get so because beer just gives me an output and then you get tired.

825
00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:02.680
Whiskey.
If I drink a whiskey on the rocks now,
which is kind of whiskey.
Yeah,

826
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:07.180
yeah.
Scotch.
That's like a,
a,
a vaporizer for alcoholics.
Like you know,

827
00:49:07.181 --> 00:49:09.620
vaporizer.
You have like vaporizer.

828
00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.940
If you're going to smoke weed is the way to do it.
I would think because it,

829
00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.820
it filters out everything except the shit that gets you high.

830
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:21.300
You take a hit off it,
it,
it,
there's no burning sensation.
It's,
oh,

831
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:23.290
it's like a mist.
And I swear to God,

832
00:49:23.291 --> 00:49:28.291
if you get high with a vaporizer versus drinking three or four beers,

833
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:31.720
like just the fatty tissue you're going to build on your liver.

834
00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.700
Like I would think that a vaporizer is,

835
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:38.080
I mean obviously no research here because I'm an idiot,
but I,
I just,

836
00:49:38.081 --> 00:49:42.100
by looking at it,
that's arguably the healthiest way to get fucked up.

837
00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:45.580
You know what I mean?
What's the most healthy to drink?
What's more healthy?

838
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:50.090
I have no idea.
Well,
I would say for not being fat.
Look at,
if you,

839
00:49:50.091 --> 00:49:52.210
if you get like a juice,

840
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:56.800
drink hard stuff and you drink it on the rocks or he'd just drink it neat.

841
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:59.880
And uh,
what people get fucked up is,
you know,
they,

842
00:49:59.881 --> 00:50:01.300
they drink like Jack and cokes,

843
00:50:01.301 --> 00:50:05.710
you drinking sodas all night and all those fucking like alcoholic words like

844
00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:10.000
neat.
I would just,
okay.
Regular.
Yeah.
Neat is a no,
no ice.

845
00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:13.930
That's just straight.
Okay.
And then rocks is obviously with some ice,

846
00:50:13.931 --> 00:50:17.200
but you don't want to mix it with anything.
Like,
you know,
I guess,
you know,

847
00:50:17.201 --> 00:50:19.330
twist of lime.
The older you get,
you just,

848
00:50:19.331 --> 00:50:21.610
you just want to go right to the fucking,
you get right to the,

849
00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:25.300
it's like how old old people fight.
If they're gonna fight,

850
00:50:25.301 --> 00:50:26.630
they're not going to sit there and try it.

851
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:28.970
You know who used to do that bit like Richard Pryor,
somebody.

852
00:50:28.971 --> 00:50:31.780
Then I got to look cool.
They think immediately tried to blow out your knee.

853
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.430
Just end the ship.
They'll kick in the balls.
They don't give a fuck.

854
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.690
That's the way old people drink.

855
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.810
Like I've heard somebody tell was a bartender said when somebody comes in,

856
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.990
if they order a beer,
I think,
okay,
this guy could be a problem.

857
00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:45.780
But if somebody just comes in and they order like a whiskey or whatever and it's

858
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.800
this sitting there,
you know,
and they know how they want to think.
All right,

859
00:50:48.801 --> 00:50:53.530
this guy's a pro.
He can handle himself as a rookie.
Yeah,
yeah.
Ugly.
Oh yeah,

860
00:50:53.531 --> 00:50:58.220
he's coming in.
Let me get a,
you know,
give me get a shot exam.
Zam Buka couple.

861
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.640
Yeah.
You guys want to do shots?
You want to rattle those guys?
Yeah.

862
00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:03.860
That's going to be,
it's like a car bomb.
As soon as you

863
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.690
do the carb on the dumbest thing,
the Irish carbon,

864
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:11.570
it's cool because it makes you drop Amaretto into a beer.

865
00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:16.460
Is that what is the Sh isn't it?
It's a Guinness in and it's a shot up.
No,

866
00:51:16.461 --> 00:51:18.840
not again.
It's,
it's uh,
maybe there's a bunch of alcoholics,

867
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:22.110
not gonna lie to the ends of his podcasts.
Got me Thursday.
I do it.

868
00:51:22.111 --> 00:51:25.520
I'm ready to drink.
Yeah,
me too.
Like,
yeah,
yeah,
no,
no.
What?
Booze and after this,

869
00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:29.900
um,
yeah,
so Sarah,
I would go with,
but okay,
so he says those sec.

870
00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.670
He's a Labatt blue.
You know what I would do,

871
00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.700
I wouldn't do the sec is just because the most interesting man in the world.

872
00:51:34.701 --> 00:51:38.900
It's a little overhype.
I go Labatt blue.
I think that's cool.
I have,

873
00:51:38.901 --> 00:51:41.660
I can't remember what Labatt Blue Chase lakes.
Canadian,
right?
Yeah.

874
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:45.800
But does it have the extra alcohol once it comes in,

875
00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:49.760
once it comes into triple x has the extra,
it's the sexiest got hurt.

876
00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:52.250
The second dude,
that's another reason to fucking get into hockey.

877
00:51:52.251 --> 00:51:54.050
When you go up to Canada,
when you drink that beer,

878
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.390
it has twice the alcohol content.

879
00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.360
You know what just fucking Canadians are other than the fact,

880
00:51:59.361 --> 00:52:02.090
they say they're peaceful and neutral,
everything,

881
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:05.790
but their sport is fucking by Barrick and they drink like fucking maniac.

882
00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:07.640
They do and they're not peaceful either.
They're not.

883
00:52:07.641 --> 00:52:11.450
That's just Michael Moore's version of what they are because it worked for his

884
00:52:11.451 --> 00:52:14.780
documentary.
Did they lost a hockey game and they burned down the city.

885
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:17.720
Talk about an unacceptable face.
Exactly.
Michael Morris on the head of that,

886
00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:22.430
I got,
I got,
I got fucking two words for Canada grow up.
All right,

887
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:25.100
here's another to act your fucking age.

888
00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:28.950
<v 6>I'll be in Edmonton at the,</v>

889
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.040
<v 7>Eh,
what's going on?</v>

890
00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:01.100
It's a bill and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

891
00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:08.220
September 22nd I'm going to guess September 22nd is that what it is?

892
00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:12.560
I Dunno.
You know why?
Because I have not looked at a,
uh,

893
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.970
a calendar in weeks.

894
00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:20.350
Last time I remember looking at a calendar was at the punchline in San Francisco

895
00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:24.160
and that's cause I started September 11th,
nine,
11.
You know,

896
00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:28.230
obviously that date sticks out.
So let's do the math here.

897
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.520
So Thursday,

898
00:53:29.521 --> 00:53:34.521
the next Thursday 11 and seven is 18 Friday,

899
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.110
Saturday,
Sunday,
Monday.
Yeah,
the 22nd.
There you go.

900
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:41.570
I just got back from a,
Oh this is actually the,

901
00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:43.920
this is the first podcast in a couple of weeks,

902
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:49.030
an official podcast because something was going on with the g cast thing over

903
00:53:50.941 --> 00:53:53.340
the,
uh,
I don't pass a couple of weeks,

904
00:53:53.341 --> 00:53:57.510
which I tried to explain in a quick four minute thing the other day.

905
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:59.100
And basically if you didn't listen to that,

906
00:53:59.101 --> 00:54:02.910
basically what happened was I would babble for half an hour,
like I always do.

907
00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:07.350
And then I'd go to publish it and then they'd be like a,
there's been an error.

908
00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:11.100
Good bye.
And it would hang up on me.
So that happened the last couple of weeks.

909
00:54:11.101 --> 00:54:14.010
So if you are new to my page,

910
00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.250
which I hope you walk cause I just had an hour long special that came out of

911
00:54:18.251 --> 00:54:21.690
comedy central and I'm hoping to get some new people on here.
Um,

912
00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:25.050
I do one of these podcasts every single week and um,

913
00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:30.380
I have a new feature on the podcast or you people excited or the nine of you

914
00:54:31.051 --> 00:54:34.800
still fucking hanging in there.
I had like 14,
and then I took two weeks off,

915
00:54:34.801 --> 00:54:37.920
so I'm sure I'm on it.
We'll be on the fucking UPN now.

916
00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:40.710
Does that even exist anymore?
Didn't they?

917
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:45.770
They combined the combined UPN and WB to make the WB UPN network or something.

918
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:50.460
Um,
anyways,
uh,
the new feature on my,
uh,

919
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:53.040
my podcast is you can finally subscribe to it.

920
00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:57.690
I didn't realize that you couldn't subscribe to it,
which is actually a lie.

921
00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.570
Somebody emailed me about six months ago saying that you couldn't,

922
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:04.740
and I ignored it because I don't like dealing with computers.

923
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:09.990
And uh,
so I guess I'm the Douche there.
But finally I redid my website,

924
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:14.310
[inaudible] dot com and if you go onto [inaudible] dot com don't do it now

925
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:19.050
because the podcast will shut off and start over again.
But um,

926
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:20.490
or you can't go there.
I don't give a shit.

927
00:55:20.491 --> 00:55:23.520
I'm trying to drive people to go there anyways.
I have a new website,

928
00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:27.270
Bill bird.com,
and when you go on that,
um,

929
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:32.010
there's some buttons and if you click on the Monday morning podcast,
um,

930
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:36.510
you know,
once you open a new window and let me walk you through.
Okay,

931
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:39.480
go up to you little file button.
Set the one you want to hit.

932
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:42.150
You guys using a Mac like me.
Um,

933
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.720
you click on new window and then you go to bill bird.com.

934
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.650
It's going to be very instructional this week.
All right,
I'll wait.

935
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:53.400
I'll wait for you guys who have old laptops like me,
you know,

936
00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:57.640
but there is one chick who tells me every week she listens to it at the gym.

937
00:55:57.690 --> 00:56:00.060
Right now she's actually on a treadmill,
so she can't do it.

938
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:05.270
So just try to memorize this part.
Okay,
sweetheart.
Um,
I sound like a dick.

939
00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:09.570
They're heritage sweetheart.
Why am I in Cherokee boy mood?
Um,
okay.

940
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:14.730
Sorry about that man.
No offense to the lady at the gym.
Now she's a lady.
Bill.

941
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:17.670
Now you're overly apologizing.
Okay.

942
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.170
Why don't you just meant that you're an angry psychopath and even when you're in

943
00:56:21.171 --> 00:56:24.670
a,
in a,
in a good mood,
you still sound like a dick.
All right,
there you go.

944
00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:29.170
High like that.
Honesty,
first day of the fucking week.
Um,
all right,

945
00:56:29.171 --> 00:56:30.620
so if you go to [inaudible] dot com it's,

946
00:56:30.621 --> 00:56:33.640
she lets you guys have opened your new window.
It's hopefully,
you know,

947
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:37.420
you can click on those buttons.
Um,

948
00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:40.150
right underneath that black and white picture of me looking at somebody who is

949
00:56:40.151 --> 00:56:42.820
annoying me while I'm on stage.
Um,

950
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:46.330
there's a button there that says Monday morning podcast and if you click on
that,

951
00:56:46.331 --> 00:56:51.210
the podcast will come up and probably start over again,
which would be confused,

952
00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:55.360
confusing.
Um,
I dunno,
you should be able to figure it out so you can,

953
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.840
you can subscribe on that page and you can,
you know,

954
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:00.520
download the shift to your iPod.

955
00:57:00.521 --> 00:57:03.790
It's going to be available up on iTunes and I guess,
I don't know,

956
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:07.330
my web guy was trying to explain that.
I didn't really get it,
but I'm,
I'm,

957
00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:11.530
what I'm basically trying to say here is so fucking bad at explaining shit is

958
00:57:11.531 --> 00:57:14.530
you can finally,
this is what I should've said initially.

959
00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:19.530
You can finally subscribe to my podcast by going to [inaudible] dot com clicking

960
00:57:20.441 --> 00:57:22.780
on the button that says Monday morning podcasts,

961
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:27.030
or even the photo of me where it says Monday morning podcast,

962
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.990
the new window will open up and you just,

963
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:33.460
you can subscribe right there and I'll you computer savvy people can take it

964
00:57:33.461 --> 00:57:37.240
from there.
All right.
Jesus Christ.
I got through it.
All right,

965
00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:41.620
so that's the big thing.
And secondly,
I want to thank everybody.

966
00:57:41.621 --> 00:57:42.610
Over the last couple of weeks,

967
00:57:42.611 --> 00:57:45.430
all the people came out to the punchline in San Francisco.

968
00:57:45.431 --> 00:57:46.630
The turnout was ridiculous.

969
00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:49.570
I didn't even get any radio and all the shows sold out.

970
00:57:49.571 --> 00:57:54.160
So I really appreciate everybody up in the bay area,
motherfucker.
And,
uh,

971
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:57.070
last week,
um,
at the Richmond funny bone,

972
00:57:57.071 --> 00:57:59.950
I want to thank the 400 people,

973
00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:05.350
451 people that actually paid to see me over the course of five shows.

974
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:10.900
I,
Oh God,
I had a brutal week out there.

975
00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:15.760
I don't know that,
that fucking comedy club,
it's like the Bermuda triangle.

976
00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:19.930
You know,
they got it in a,
in a mall behind a Dick's sporting good.

977
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:23.830
And for the life of me,
I can't get anybody.

978
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:27.970
I can't get anybody to come out to see me there.
It's unreal.
I was in New Jersey,

979
00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:30.880
I sold out San Francisco,
sold out in New York.
I sold out,

980
00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:33.730
I go to Richmond and all of a sudden it's like,

981
00:58:33.731 --> 00:58:38.710
it's 1992 and I'm a brand new comedian and no one knows who I am.
But,

982
00:58:38.711 --> 00:58:43.360
um,
the people who did show up and some people who just wandered in,
um,

983
00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:46.990
I'd be lying to you if I didn't say I had a good time.
I had a great time.

984
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:52.020
It was actually the first date on the uninformed,
uninformed tour with uh,

985
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:57.100
Joe to Rosa,
which is another thing that I have going on in my life right now.

986
00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:02.100
I am doing a tour to hype my XM show called uninformed on Xm Two oh two,

987
00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:07.440
uh,
with Joe to Rosa and well,
he's going to be on all my dates coming up.
Um,

988
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:11.920
the next one being,
uh,
the Cap City Comedy Club in Austin,

989
00:59:11.921 --> 00:59:15.250
Texas and uh,

990
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:19.180
the DC Improv of whatever.
What am I doing here?
I'm just being,

991
00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:22.080
I'm just like whoring myself out right now.
Um,

992
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:26.450
I usually get to the funny first and then in the end I put the,
uh,

993
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:30.380
the information.
So considering this,
this podcast started off so dry,

994
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:35.180
like a white wine that you might have after for some fucking fish.
Um,

995
00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:38.330
you guys want to hear some hate mail car?
Should do.

996
00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:41.720
Why would you want me to read a bunch of emails where,
uh,

997
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:45.950
people telling me that they think I'm funny.
That's not interesting.
All right,

998
00:59:45.951 --> 00:59:49.440
so the other day I did a,
I did Conan O'brien.
Um,

999
00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:53.090
definitely I did that on September 9th because the person who wrote the hate

1000
00:59:53.091 --> 00:59:57.740
mail let me know that it was nine,
nine oh eight when I did Conan O'brien.

1001
00:59:57.741 --> 01:00:00.800
And basically,
you know,
I gotta be honest with you,

1002
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:06.800
it was the best four and a half minutes that I've ever had on a late night show.

1003
01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.510
You know,
I've done,
I mean it was,
I'd done,

1004
01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:13.250
I've done like three cars in dailies for Letterman's and this was my third Conan

1005
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:17.930
and I finally figured it out how to do it.
You know,

1006
01:00:17.931 --> 01:00:21.950
cause the problem I have is my jokes are really long,

1007
01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:23.930
so I try to chop them up.

1008
01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:28.130
My jokes are also very,
um,

1009
01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:33.460
not conducive to running a crest toothpaste ad afterwards,

1010
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:38.210
you know,
and I kind of look,
I kind of like,

1011
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:42.440
I'm a dick and I have my area in haircut now,

1012
01:00:42.441 --> 01:00:46.520
so I got all that fucking going.
So I have to,
so I had to somehow figure out how,

1013
01:00:46.521 --> 01:00:50.230
and four and a half minutes to come out and make the crowd kind of go,
dude,

1014
01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.850
what the fuck?
Like,
I always do,

1015
01:00:52.851 --> 01:00:56.090
but somehow get them back quick enough where they'll like me for the next four

1016
01:00:56.091 --> 01:01:00.770
fucking minutes.
And I finally did it.
I finally did it wire to wire.
I fucking,

1017
01:01:00.771 --> 01:01:05.540
it was so fucking smooth that I was,
I got up,

1018
01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:09.290
I had absolutely no regrets.
I didn't think of anything that,
where I fucked up.

1019
01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:12.590
And I was thinking,
uh,
you know,
this I this thing once a,

1020
01:01:12.591 --> 01:01:14.780
well not even my mother would criticize it,
you know,

1021
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:19.160
cause she always criticize him and uh,
she's not trying to be a jerk.

1022
01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:22.640
She's trying to what she says that she's trying to make it better.
Okay.

1023
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:26.780
Which is what she's doing.
Okay.
But,
you know,
it's kind of Nice to be like,

1024
01:01:26.781 --> 01:01:30.980
hey son,
you did a good job.
Oh by the way,
next time,
don't fuck this up.
You know,

1025
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:35.150
you know,
ease into it.
You know,
you just don't hit me with a fucking straight,

1026
01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:39.920
right.
Like Ali,
you know,
the one,
one punch.

1027
01:01:39.921 --> 01:01:43.760
I didn't prepare for that.
My mother is going to fucking criticize me.

1028
01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:46.670
You know what I mean?
If I see that when we were kings,

1029
01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:50.800
when Ali's fighting George Foreman back when he was a,

1030
01:01:50.801 --> 01:01:54.220
a scary individual before he became this happy guy who had,

1031
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:57.960
who makes grills or at least signs them.
Um,

1032
01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.310
I don't think it's in the factory doing it,
but uh,
yeah,
that's what he did,

1033
01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.110
came out the first round and he's like,

1034
01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:06.020
what's the one punch he hasn't prepared for the straight.
Right.

1035
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:09.800
And he fucking bashed him in the face like nine times with it.

1036
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.830
This is my mother is the verbal equivalent to a straight right

1037
01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:19.230
and that,
that God damn fight there.
Okay.
So anyways,
I did so great.
I,

1038
01:02:19.231 --> 01:02:22.080
she even left me a message.
She said it was so great.
I'm not,
I'm not even,

1039
01:02:22.081 --> 01:02:25.260
I could criticize it because it's kind of a joke between us because there was a

1040
01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:28.860
moment there when I wouldn't tell her I was on television because I couldn't

1041
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:31.530
handle the fucking criticism.
All right.

1042
01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.710
That was a big long windup to say it went so fucking awesome.

1043
01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:37.710
But I still ended up getting some hate mail and here it is.

1044
01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:41.400
Basically what happened was I opened up with this adopting a dog joke cause I

1045
01:02:41.401 --> 01:02:44.970
want to get a puppy and people are telling me that I should rescue a dog.

1046
01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:49.440
And my worry is if I go down there,
you know,

1047
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.800
I know there's a lot of good dogs down there,
but you know,
there's a couple of,

1048
01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.830
you know,
there's the COO,
Joe's and old yellers down there too.

1049
01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.160
So I'm kind of fucking nervous to do that.
So that's basically the joke,
right?

1050
01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:03.870
So this is the email.
This is the email I got from this lady.
She says,
Bill,

1051
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:08.310
I cut your act on Conan tonight,
nine,
nine oh eight.

1052
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:12.960
She has that in parenthesis to make it nice and official.
She goes,
uh,

1053
01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:14.910
I usually love the comedians.

1054
01:03:14.911 --> 01:03:19.911
He features on his show as I have watched his show every night for more than 13

1055
01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:23.280
years.
And I am known to have a good sense of humor.

1056
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.500
So you see what she's done in the beginning.

1057
01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:29.410
She has established yourself as somebody who is a,

1058
01:03:29.411 --> 01:03:33.840
a regular viewer,
has not missed one show in 13 years.
That's pretty incredible.

1059
01:03:33.841 --> 01:03:36.810
Don't you think?
It's almost like it didn't really happen.

1060
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.700
It's almost like she's setting me up so she can then be an unbelievable fucking

1061
01:03:41.701 --> 01:03:42.780
cunt.
Okay.

1062
01:03:42.781 --> 01:03:46.800
And then she's also known to have a good sense of humor and evidently that's

1063
01:03:46.801 --> 01:03:48.480
true cause she's,
she,
she wrote it,

1064
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:53.280
she's known to have a good sense of humor by a bunch of other fucking people

1065
01:03:53.281 --> 01:03:55.590
that I don't even know,
but okay,
we'll take your word for it.

1066
01:03:56.130 --> 01:04:00.120
So she's known to have a good sense of humor and she goes however I'll,

1067
01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:03.060
is it going to take a left turn?
I think it is.
However,

1068
01:04:03.061 --> 01:04:07.680
I was completely appalled at your rant about rescue dogs.

1069
01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:09.030
You're horrible.

1070
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:14.390
Unfair stereotypes is why millions of dogs and cats are killed each year at

1071
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:18.870
Shell,
at the shelter and pounds in the USA.

1072
01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:20.280
Isn't that amazing?

1073
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.340
I thought it was because a bunch of people dropped off dogs that they didn't

1074
01:04:23.341 --> 01:04:25.800
want anymore and then nobody adopted them.

1075
01:04:25.801 --> 01:04:27.570
And that's why they ended up getting killed.

1076
01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:32.600
Evidently it's because of the joke that I told on Conan O'brien.

1077
01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.670
So anyways,
many pets,
we're back to her now.

1078
01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:40.530
Many pets are left at shelters do to,
to do to the mortgage crisis.

1079
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.940
And people have lost their homes or their owners dying,

1080
01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:50.070
not because they were bad dogs or repeat offenders as you compared them to

1081
01:04:50.071 --> 01:04:54.840
dangerous felons and prison.
See,
that even made me laugh.

1082
01:04:54.841 --> 01:04:59.130
That's a funny,
you know,
comedy is exact exaggeration.
So anyways,

1083
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.240
she continues.

1084
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:05.730
Hundreds of rescue dogs from local pounds have gone on to become huge movie

1085
01:05:05.731 --> 01:05:09.120
stars.
All right,

1086
01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:14.370
we're going to stop right there for a second.
Huge movie.
Stars should I keep,

1087
01:05:14.371 --> 01:05:16.830
so I keep ripping this apart and he wanted me to keep reading it.

1088
01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.530
I make this the last time.
I'll stop and I'll just finish the fucking letter.

1089
01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:25.510
Huge movie starts really,
Really Lisa.
Okay.
Let's name them lassie.

1090
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.590
Benji,
I've heard of this.

1091
01:05:29.591 --> 01:05:33.640
Rin Tin Tin back in the days when fucking Milton Berle had a show,
right?

1092
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:35.830
And then when he left with,

1093
01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:40.610
there's something you guys can email me and email me and some more famous dog.

1094
01:05:40.611 --> 01:05:44.850
Spuds Mackenzie.
That fucking,
uh,

1095
01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:49.270
why,
why the fucking thing from the Taco bell commercial?
What are your,

1096
01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:52.690
you'll cal it.
Taco Bell.
That one.
He's not even the same as,

1097
01:05:52.691 --> 01:05:56.440
he's like the fucking,
uh,
who's,
he's like,
you know what?
And that's all.

1098
01:05:56.441 --> 01:05:59.590
It's not even famous.
I was like the,
that is the dog equivalent to that dude.

1099
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:03.610
He used to get on TV,
be like,
dude,
you're getting a Dell.
Remember him?

1100
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:06.970
He was famous for like three minutes and then he bought some weed and Washington

1101
01:06:06.971 --> 01:06:11.650
square park and that ended that
huge movie.

1102
01:06:11.651 --> 01:06:16.630
Stars really?
When spots going to make us fucking comeback.

1103
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.120
Is he in the next pulp fiction?
All right,

1104
01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.040
I'm going to just finish the letter here.

1105
01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:23.320
Cause this thing fucking drives me nuts.
Okay.

1106
01:06:23.321 --> 01:06:28.321
They've gone on to become huge movie stars and more have even become real life

1107
01:06:28.571 --> 01:06:30.670
heroes.
Saving many lives.

1108
01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:34.150
Making fun of people is totally up for grabs.

1109
01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:38.230
Making fun of homeless animals in shelters or pounds.

1110
01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:43.300
Waiting to die is like making fun of the Jews in German death camps.

1111
01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:47.440
Totally offensive.
Okay.

1112
01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:51.610
Can you fucking believe that this is the level she's taking this too?
You know,

1113
01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.380
I mean,
don't you think your justice offensive comparing Jews to shelter dogs?

1114
01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.280
We want to get hold of the mirror to your face.
Sweet.
I'll do it again.

1115
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:05.170
I'm commenting.
Finish the letter bill.
Okay.
Um,
okay.

1116
01:07:05.171 --> 01:07:06.430
This is when it starts getting threatening.

1117
01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:10.270
Do you need to be reminded what happened to Ellen to generous when she publicly

1118
01:07:10.271 --> 01:07:13.390
denounced the rescue group on air?
Yes,
I do.
You dumb bitch.

1119
01:07:13.391 --> 01:07:17.530
She still has her own hit TV show.
Sorry.

1120
01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.620
Continuing.
She led,

1121
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:28.810
she alienated herself from anyone that has adopted a pet or rescued a homeless

1122
01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:33.100
pet.
There are millions of us and she even offended,

1123
01:07:33.101 --> 01:07:37.180
responsible animal owners.
So what are you saying?

1124
01:07:37.181 --> 01:07:40.960
The other people who adopt those people,
homeless pets are not responsible.

1125
01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:46.630
So anyways,
she goes,
the outcry was tremendous and it hurt her popularity dearly.

1126
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.180
Oh yeah.
I just saw an,
an American Express commercial.

1127
01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:53.170
She really looks like she's hurting
Jesus Christ.

1128
01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:56.590
She's probably fucking ordering whores every five minutes.

1129
01:07:56.590 --> 01:08:01.300
Seven we'll come over dressed like Dirk girl scouts,
you know?
All right.
Um,

1130
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:04.720
I don't think this part of your act is going to go over well in Austin,
Texas.

1131
01:08:04.721 --> 01:08:09.010
Scratch.
She's on my website stalking me now.
I'm down in Austin,
Texas.

1132
01:08:09.011 --> 01:08:13.030
They are huge animal lovers and even bigger rescue animal lovers.

1133
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:18.860
They even made city a no kill city for shelter and rescue animals.

1134
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.260
And here's where she brings it down.

1135
01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.960
She takes it down to know we all need to laugh.

1136
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:29.260
Just don't perpetuate stereotypes that harm the innocent and increase the death

1137
01:08:29.451 --> 01:08:33.410
rates.
Come up with something else.
As I recall,

1138
01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:38.450
no one hardly laughed until you changed the topic regarding Lisa.
Isn't that,

1139
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:42.320
that's the part of the email that really fucking hurts the most.
Okay.

1140
01:08:42.321 --> 01:08:45.320
Is I not only that I finally have this great wire to wire set,

1141
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:50.180
which I will be putting up on my website today.
Okay.
Um,

1142
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:54.830
you know,
it went so well.
Not even my mother fucking criticizes it.

1143
01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:57.560
And then just out of left field.
Here comes Lisa.

1144
01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:03.940
Here comes Lisa who's so into this fucking topic that she compares dogs being

1145
01:09:04.911 --> 01:09:09.290
put to sleep to the Holocaust in Germany.
Now I'm a dog lover.

1146
01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:12.560
I went to what she does.
I'm a dog lover and a,
you know,

1147
01:09:12.561 --> 01:09:16.400
I'm known to have a good sense of humor,
but you know what the fuck lady,

1148
01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:20.150
why don't you take it down a little bit?
Okay.

1149
01:09:20.151 --> 01:09:24.320
Making Fun of those dogs is the equivalent to what Michael Vick did in fucking

1150
01:09:24.321 --> 01:09:28.880
Virginia.
Maybe where that's another human being who was doing mean shit.

1151
01:09:28.881 --> 01:09:31.460
The dogs,
I can see that.
You know,

1152
01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:37.220
I don't think me making fun of dogs is the equivalent of somebody trying to

1153
01:09:37.221 --> 01:09:41.690
exterminate an entire race of people so he can take over the fucking world.

1154
01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:47.060
All right?
And no point that I say to make lamps out of a cocker Spaniel either.

1155
01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.390
So your comparison is fucking ridiculous.
Okay.

1156
01:09:50.391 --> 01:09:52.940
Now we're into paragraph to Ellen to generous,
okay.

1157
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:56.540
The worst thing that happened happened out of that was everybody made fun of her

1158
01:09:56.541 --> 01:10:00.470
for crying.
You know,
radio shows,
talk,
show hosts.
They all made fun of her,

1159
01:10:00.471 --> 01:10:04.560
but she's doing fine,
okay?
She comes out,
she does a little fucking,
uh,

1160
01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:08.750
Irish Jig at the beginning,
which is fucking cringe worthy.

1161
01:10:08.751 --> 01:10:12.940
And I cannot even watch it,
you know?
And after a while,
you know,
when you do it,

1162
01:10:12.970 --> 01:10:13.940
90 shows in a row,

1163
01:10:13.941 --> 01:10:16.460
it's almost like you feel like the higher ups are telling her to do it and she

1164
01:10:16.461 --> 01:10:17.510
doesn't want to dance anymore.

1165
01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:21.920
So I really tried to look into her eyes to see like that cry for help.
Um,

1166
01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:26.180
and I don't know what the fuck you talking about the joke not going over Lisa,

1167
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:31.670
you know,
went over great.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It was awkward until I said,

1168
01:10:31.671 --> 01:10:35.150
why don't we just go down to a prison and an adopt an inmate and roll the dice

1169
01:10:35.151 --> 01:10:38.000
that the guy was wrongly convicted.
Bam right there.

1170
01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:41.470
I got my first laugh and then I just wrote that out.
Like Blake,

1171
01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:45.530
one of the fucking beach boys took it right to the god Damn Beach.
All right,

1172
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:50.570
so why don't you just fucking lighten up a little bit,

1173
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:56.310
you know,
get out of your agenda for a second.
Okay.
And,
and,

1174
01:10:56.311 --> 01:10:59.420
and watch my set again because it was a fucking great set.
Got Damn it.

1175
01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:03.890
And I'm going to put it up on my website today cause I finally got the cliff.

1176
01:11:03.891 --> 01:11:06.650
If it's approved to people and you can see what she's talking about it first,

1177
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:10.610
it starts off awkward,
but I mentioned that that's how my sets always start off.

1178
01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.750
All right.
I'm an opening recently with a line in my ex Sam,

1179
01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.510
sick of obese people crying on TV now.
That always causes people to pull back.

1180
01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:22.380
It's a great way to get people to shut the fuck up and look at this stage before

1181
01:11:22.381 --> 01:11:25.260
you ease them down into whatever thing you want to talk about.

1182
01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:29.760
So that's how I did on Conan.
Alright,
actually I got gonna miss you guys.

1183
01:11:29.761 --> 01:11:32.550
I was actually standing backstage,
sitting there going like,
oh my God,
I'm open.

1184
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:37.470
I'm opening up making fun of rescue dogs.
I'm going to come off like a psycho.

1185
01:11:37.471 --> 01:11:40.110
And I was second guessing myself and then I was just sitting there like going,

1186
01:11:40.111 --> 01:11:44.160
really?
Are you really gonna do this again?
You're 12th late nights sent.

1187
01:11:44.190 --> 01:11:47.670
Why don't you,
you always do that.
You do that in comedy clubs.

1188
01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.670
So what I did was I walked out there and I just said,
fuck it.

1189
01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:55.290
And I just play to the crowd.
Like I was in a comedy club and Lo and behold,

1190
01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:56.430
it went fucking great.

1191
01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:01.760
And I was on cloud nine until Lisa had to see.

1192
01:12:01.771 --> 01:12:03.030
Yeah,
she didn't even take me down.

1193
01:12:03.031 --> 01:12:07.400
I thought it was funny that that's the thing about groups he kisses.
Give me on,

1194
01:12:07.401 --> 01:12:12.180
once you join a group,
like you fucking,
you know,
be it rescue dogs,

1195
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.133
uh,

1196
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:18.900
environmentalist group or a fucking the religious right.
You just,

1197
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.340
you just spin off into,
I don't know where you go.

1198
01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:28.410
And it's because you're hanging around people who are all saying the exact same

1199
01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:31.500
shit.
You know what I mean?
It's like a bunch of chicks sitting around

1200
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
who are like 12 years old just in a bedroom covered with Jonas brother posters,

1201
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:41.460
you know,
how the fuck do you think they're going to,

1202
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.710
they're going to dig in to find anything better than then and they're not.

1203
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:46.230
And you're,
you're the the adult version.

1204
01:12:46.231 --> 01:12:47.730
And then I think even fucking makes sense.

1205
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:53.790
That's just fucking insane.
I mean,
I love dogs.
And not being able to fighting is,

1206
01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:57.390
I'm probably going adopt one,
probably gonna rescue one.
You know,
why not?

1207
01:12:57.391 --> 01:13:02.040
Because I'm fucking give a shit.
I don't give a shit,

1208
01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:05.070
but you know what I mean,
like I want to do it because it's a lot cheaper.

1209
01:13:05.071 --> 01:13:06.890
You go down to here and I a fucking pet store,

1210
01:13:06.891 --> 01:13:10.080
they want to like two grand for a bulldog.
You know,

1211
01:13:10.081 --> 01:13:12.480
when I go down there and I'll get one that's been locked up a little bit,

1212
01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:19.020
it's got shanked a couple of times.
You know,
it's got to get,

1213
01:13:19.021 --> 01:13:24.010
you've got the cobweb tattoos on the back of his fucking hind legs,
you know,

1214
01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:28.820
with that elbow is for a dog.
Um,
anyway,
anyway,
she,

1215
01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:33.420
let's,
uh,
let's plow ahead here with the podcast.
So anyways,

1216
01:13:33.421 --> 01:13:36.600
this is a,
this is the podcast.
Like I said,
if you knew them,

1217
01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:40.290
you knew one of my page.
We actually have a new section this week is,

1218
01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:44.070
I actually started,
you know,
I got some time off here coming up,

1219
01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:47.100
so I wanted to go check out some movies.
And,
uh,
you know,

1220
01:13:47.101 --> 01:13:51.090
people tend to amp things up about movies.
Um,

1221
01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.050
like a,
you know,
like,
like the reviewers.

1222
01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.000
So I just wanted to hear from regular people cause you know,

1223
01:13:57.001 --> 01:13:58.740
people amped up that tropic thunder.

1224
01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:02.460
Like it was the funniest fucking movie since animal house.

1225
01:14:02.461 --> 01:14:07.290
And I went to go see it and it was definitely funny,
but you know,

1226
01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.640
it wasn't,
you know,
I don't know.
I hate when people do that.
All right,

1227
01:14:12.641 --> 01:14:14.890
so here we go.
Here's some movie reviews I asked about,

1228
01:14:14.891 --> 01:14:17.650
I was thinking about obviously seeing the Dinero Pachino thing,

1229
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:23.250
a righteous kill and I'm somebody who goes by bad dog said,

1230
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:29.650
um,
I had to see this movie because of the narrow Pachino wearing it.
Exactly.

1231
01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:33.390
That's why everyone's going to see it.
She said,
I thought it might be close,

1232
01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:38.320
be a close second to the departed.
Well this movie was so bad.

1233
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:43.060
How bad was it that if it weren't for Dinero in Pachino I think it would've gone

1234
01:14:43.061 --> 01:14:46.060
straight to video.
It was like a really,

1235
01:14:46.061 --> 01:14:49.720
really bad made for TV movie.
All right.

1236
01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:51.790
Now that's kind of what I've read on the Internet.

1237
01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:57.060
But this other person sent me an email about the same movie and said,

1238
01:14:58.331 --> 01:15:00.220
I think the movie righteous kill was good.

1239
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:04.720
Obviously p Pachino into narrow made it great.
But even without them,

1240
01:15:04.721 --> 01:15:06.460
I think the plot was really cool.

1241
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:11.530
Now granted that kid had a picture where he was holding up what looked to be

1242
01:15:11.531 --> 01:15:13.600
some sort of dildo between his legs.

1243
01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:17.470
So that kind of knocked down his credibility.
But what if he's just being wacky?

1244
01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:20.380
See this is what sucks.
This is what might suck about this.

1245
01:15:20.381 --> 01:15:25.120
These movie reviews is uh,
you know,
like those sayings,

1246
01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.920
how you got all those things in life.

1247
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:31.330
But did you can always have another saying that it like,
you know,

1248
01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:35.140
penny saved is a penny earned.
Then you got,
you got to spend money to make money.

1249
01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:39.700
You know,
walk softly,
carry to carry a big stick.

1250
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.860
The greasy wheel,
the squeaky wheel gets the grease.
So what we see will,

1251
01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.960
you know what I'm saying?
So now I don't,
I don't know.

1252
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:49.690
I'm going to go a bad dog on that one.
So basically,
you know what?

1253
01:15:49.691 --> 01:15:53.380
I think this section just give people a heads up.
If you saw a good movie and,

1254
01:15:53.381 --> 01:15:56.170
or if he got completely fucked over on a movie and you want to,

1255
01:15:56.171 --> 01:16:00.790
you want to do a year little rant.
I will read about how awful the movie was.
Um,

1256
01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:04.150
somebody else suggested burn after reading was outstanding.

1257
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:07.240
Dark humor shows how ass backwards,

1258
01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:10.330
backwards and retarded our government agencies can be.

1259
01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.480
Malcovich is brilliant and it Brad Pitt.
Is it perfect.
Chad?

1260
01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:18.820
All in all great movie and I'm fairly picky about mainstream movies.

1261
01:16:20.290 --> 01:16:24.220
All right.
All right,
so I'm going to check on,
is that the Coen brothers movie?

1262
01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:28.010
I'm definitely going to check that one out.
Um,
brought ted,

1263
01:16:28.011 --> 01:16:30.610
it looks fucking hilarious in it.
Oh,
that's right.

1264
01:16:30.611 --> 01:16:34.910
John McAfee punches him in the face.
I'm going to see that.
Um,
anyways,

1265
01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:38.320
let's get to the podcast questions.
I know this is a little disjointed this week.

1266
01:16:38.321 --> 01:16:42.190
Um,
I kind of had a little difficulty trying to remember which ones I answered in

1267
01:16:42.191 --> 01:16:47.050
which ones I didn't because I did two podcasts that were never heard.
And uh,

1268
01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.300
someday when I die they will rerelease them.

1269
01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:53.170
Like when a miles Davis died and they started,
you know,

1270
01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:56.880
I like when they do that to people,
you know,
they,
they,

1271
01:16:56.881 --> 01:17:00.520
they released a CD of him fucking playing the trumpet when he was taking a shit

1272
01:17:00.521 --> 01:17:04.270
in his bathroom.
Um,
you know,

1273
01:17:04.271 --> 01:17:07.030
basically stuff that they never wanted released.
All right.

1274
01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:12.020
Podcast question one a bill.
Will the cubs win the world series?

1275
01:17:12.021 --> 01:17:14.450
Why or why not?
Uh,

1276
01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.180
I hope they do.
I'm pulling for the cubs and if not the cubs,

1277
01:17:20.210 --> 01:17:23.720
I'd like to see the devil race.
Uh,
just because,
you know,

1278
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:25.700
they're both great stories.

1279
01:17:25.701 --> 01:17:30.500
One team that just sucked forever for a Goddamn hasn't suck forever,

1280
01:17:30.501 --> 01:17:33.110
but you know,
you know what I'm saying?
I don't even get enough stupid cubs curse.

1281
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:36.650
I'd like to see that.
But um,
you know what,

1282
01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:41.510
I think the angels are going to win it because he ain't that they're built to

1283
01:17:41.511 --> 01:17:44.150
win it.
They got all the pitching,
you know,

1284
01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:48.110
killer one to starting rotation and they got dice clay.

1285
01:17:48.111 --> 01:17:50.800
They got a great fucking bull pen they added to share out.
I mean,

1286
01:17:50.801 --> 01:17:54.260
come on on paper,
they should fucking do it.
Who knows?

1287
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.920
And I would say that they are the angels because they always used to choke in

1288
01:17:57.921 --> 01:18:02.780
the playoffs,
but they did one in 2002 so I've got to give it to them.
Um,

1289
01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:04.390
oh,
and also speaking of sports,

1290
01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.760
I got to man up here and bring up my fucking patriots is a bunch of douchebags

1291
01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:12.110
in New Jersey and Florida rocking back and forth in their cubicle right now.

1292
01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:15.560
Totally excited.
All right,
I'm going to take my lumps now.

1293
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:18.220
The New England patriots,
I last,

1294
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:21.950
well actually I didn't even get the globe two weeks ago.
As everybody said,

1295
01:18:21.951 --> 01:18:25.940
the sky is falling because Tom Brady got knocked out and completely ignored the

1296
01:18:25.941 --> 01:18:27.620
fact that the rest of the team also,

1297
01:18:27.621 --> 01:18:32.210
when 18 won 18 games in a row before getting bitch slapped by the fucking

1298
01:18:32.211 --> 01:18:33.044
giants.

1299
01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:38.210
And I said that they'd beat the jets because they had fucking George Blanda

1300
01:18:38.211 --> 01:18:40.910
under center.
All right.
And what did they do?

1301
01:18:40.911 --> 01:18:43.490
They went out and they beat the fucking jets.
So I'm,
I'm sitting there,

1302
01:18:43.491 --> 01:18:47.930
I'm on a roll and write all these ESPN guys are fucking jumping ship.

1303
01:18:47.931 --> 01:18:50.420
And I stood there and said that they were going to fucking win.

1304
01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:54.770
I on in there like George Clooney and perfect storm going down with the boat

1305
01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:59.360
right
now.
What happens then?
I'm like all the dolphin.
You fucking kidding me.

1306
01:18:59.361 --> 01:19:02.480
It's a dolphin.
It's motherfuckers went one and 15 last year.

1307
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:06.290
Joe Reporters running his mouth again like he always does.
He's like,

1308
01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:11.480
he's like the new Brian Cox,
you know,
ended up to her.
How did you know?

1309
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:15.980
So I'm thinking it's a lock,
but what I did,
I forgot about Chad Pennington.

1310
01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:18.530
I forgot that he was their quarterback and I've always liked that guy.

1311
01:19:19.190 --> 01:19:21.890
He's a fucking winner,
but he's got bird bones.

1312
01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:26.660
You bump into him and he fucking need be breaks his femur.
So even then,

1313
01:19:26.661 --> 01:19:28.260
I still would affect the fucking pats.

1314
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:32.150
I would've thought they'd go 23 and 17 when I figured that they'd win that.

1315
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:36.620
But Dude,
Jesus Christ,
that was some of the worst defense I've ever seen.

1316
01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:41.990
That one fucking play with that guy.
He breaks through the lines,
I should say,

1317
01:19:41.991 --> 01:19:42.830
goes untouched.

1318
01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:47.480
And then that one Patriot dove into them with his shoulder and he just sort of

1319
01:19:47.481 --> 01:19:49.190
bumped them.
You know,
like when they score touchdowns,

1320
01:19:49.191 --> 01:19:52.310
they jump up and they bump into each other.
That's how hard he hit him.

1321
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:56.000
The douchebag bag announced it goes,
oh,
he breaks a tackle.
No,
he didn't

1322
01:19:57.590 --> 01:20:00.170
fucking,
it was a pathetic display by defense.
And,
uh,

1323
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.810
I actually think it's going to be a good thing for the Patriots because that's

1324
01:20:02.811 --> 01:20:06.440
the first time I've seen Belicheck behind the podium talking about shit that we

1325
01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:11.420
have to work on and he's being serious.
Okay.
And the dolphins totally celebrated.

1326
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:15.060
They dumped the water,
like they just won the fucking super bowl,

1327
01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:20.040
you know?
So,
uh,
I think it's going to work good for them.

1328
01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:22.620
So next week,
what?
Next week they got to buy.

1329
01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.510
I don't give a fuck with their plane the week after that,

1330
01:20:24.511 --> 01:20:28.050
I think they're gonna they're gonna win that one.
Oh,
you fucking motherfuckers.

1331
01:20:28.051 --> 01:20:30.630
You know what?
As you guys,
you all,
you just hate the Patriots.

1332
01:20:30.690 --> 01:20:32.970
You hate us and US three fucking ranks.

1333
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:38.400
You hate Belicheck because he ran off the field before the end of the Super
Bowl,

1334
01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.110
which I actually really fucking,
that was really bad.
But you know,
whatever.

1335
01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.440
He gets caught with a camera and all of a sudden you're going to question all

1336
01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:49.770
his fucking super bowls and they make up that shit that they were watching the

1337
01:20:49.771 --> 01:20:54.100
rams,
which turned out to be total bullshit.
All you motherfuckers,

1338
01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:57.990
you know,
so you know what?
This is all,
I'll take comfort in the jets.

1339
01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:00.630
Then I went in at the sheer,
okay,

1340
01:21:01.410 --> 01:21:03.960
where are you right now in East Rutherford listening to this.

1341
01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:07.710
You guys ain't win shit.
The dolphins,
you know when shit either.

1342
01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:11.370
If you win five games this year,
you're going to be fucking excited.
Okay?

1343
01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:16.200
It fucking stadium has been as empty during dolphins games as it has been from

1344
01:21:16.201 --> 01:21:20.160
Marlins games.
All right?
This is what you get when you guys fuck with me.

1345
01:21:20.161 --> 01:21:23.710
I've got a ton of emails.
Everybody giving me shit.
Um,

1346
01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.900
whatever.
I can't complain about shit.
Okay.

1347
01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:30.390
One of the world's series of fucking NBA title three Superbowls and another

1348
01:21:30.391 --> 01:21:33.540
world series.
You know what I mean?
Do you know what I mean?

1349
01:21:33.541 --> 01:21:35.130
Fucking championship hats.
I have,

1350
01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.950
I'm rubbing it in right now cause this is all I can go with cause we got our ass

1351
01:21:37.951 --> 01:21:40.860
kicked by the dolphins so I'm just going to be an arrogant fuck here.

1352
01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:42.211
You know what I mean?

1353
01:21:42.211 --> 01:21:45.090
I still even got my fucking Shit Celtics Championship tee shirt.

1354
01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:48.660
I haven't got that.
And you know your giants fans the second you want it.

1355
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:51.880
You all ran out there and grab it the next fucking day didn't ya?

1356
01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:57.360
I'm still waiting because my closet is overflowed with fucking championship
shit.

1357
01:21:58.470 --> 01:22:03.150
All right then what have I talked a little bit of Shit.
Reality is,
is uh,

1358
01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.280
I actually,
I can't say I'm nervous about our season.

1359
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:09.300
I mean it kind of ended when Tom Brady fucking went down.
But uh,

1360
01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:13.800
I still think,
I don't know all the bill look tough.
Bill's look tough.

1361
01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.830
Even then fucked the bills.
They're not going to win.

1362
01:22:18.250 --> 01:22:22.740
Who's going to win it this year?
I only think the cowboys,
Tony Romo,

1363
01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:27.150
he's a bit of a flake.
He still,
he still,

1364
01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:30.840
he still fucking fumbles the ball in his own end zone and rather than fallen on

1365
01:22:30.841 --> 01:22:35.040
it,
he fucking kicks it over to the other team.
That guy,
I don't know about him,

1366
01:22:35.041 --> 01:22:37.860
he still stuck and is Terry Bradshaw.

1367
01:22:38.490 --> 01:22:41.970
Terry shows the first couple of years he was looked upon as a bumbling idiot and

1368
01:22:41.971 --> 01:22:45.810
I,
and he's still fucking there.
So anyways,
yeah.

1369
01:22:45.811 --> 01:22:50.010
What the fuck am I talking about?
I got to wrap this podcast up.

1370
01:22:51.150 --> 01:22:53.380
This is all of a sudden,
this is just turned into one of these,
uh,

1371
01:22:54.690 --> 01:22:58.730
these fucking sports shows.
Did I ever make fun of this shit you don't like,

1372
01:22:58.731 --> 01:23:01.560
worst thing I hate about sports shows is when they have that fake half a

1373
01:23:01.561 --> 01:23:04.980
football field and all those old ex players go over there.

1374
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:08.080
Can I talk about that last week and it didn't get published.

1375
01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.780
Do you remember this line watching,
you know,

1376
01:23:10.781 --> 01:23:14.770
Terry Bradshaw bent over and a three point stance and watching the top of his

1377
01:23:14.771 --> 01:23:17.030
head turn red as they,

1378
01:23:17.031 --> 01:23:19.600
as they try to fucking show me what a screen pass looks like.

1379
01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:20.830
It's like I know what it looks like.

1380
01:23:21.190 --> 01:23:24.670
Can you guys and your old rickety knees get back behind the fucking studio?

1381
01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:29.700
I don't want to know how hard it is for Tom Jackson to fucking the lineup.

1382
01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:32.373
I liked that guy.

1383
01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:37.380
I don't want to see how old he is and the effects of knee surgery in 1978.

1384
01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:41.590
Did he ever have it?
Was that Randy granted,
shy?
I can't fucking remember.

1385
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:46.600
All right.
And with that,
uh,
I think that's going to be it.

1386
01:23:46.601 --> 01:23:51.090
I think it was going to get for the podcast this week.
Please subscribe to it.
Um,

1387
01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.800
did I do overrated?
Underrated.
I don't think I did that either.

1388
01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:55.990
It's something you don't want.
It is,

1389
01:23:55.991 --> 01:23:58.420
I'm looking at this fucking thing and it's a mess in front of me.

1390
01:23:59.170 --> 01:24:02.230
It really is a mess.
I can't tell what I've read and what I haven't read,

1391
01:24:02.231 --> 01:24:03.850
so I'm going to have to clear all of this shit out.

1392
01:24:03.850 --> 01:24:08.200
So if I didn't read your overrated,
underrated,
please send that shit in again.

1393
01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:12.730
I swear to God,
I will read it next week.
And um,

1394
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:16.100
I think,
uh,
I think that's it.
I know I gotta,

1395
01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:18.280
I got a TV show coming out on jet is spot on.

1396
01:24:18.281 --> 01:24:22.030
Jim Norton's a down and dirty with Jim Norton on Hbo Coming Up.

1397
01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:25.900
I did some stand up and I had to go on off this comedian Sean rouse.

1398
01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:29.710
Please check him out.
He's one of the funniest dudes I've seen in a long time.

1399
01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:31.120
And uh,
and with that,

1400
01:24:31.121 --> 01:24:34.720
the last thing I want to talk about is I once the last game in Yankee Stadium

1401
01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:38.140
and as a red sox fan,
I gotta tell you,
man,
that was really a,

1402
01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:43.690
it was sad and confusing.
I still don't understand why the fuck

1403
01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:49.240
they're leaving there.
I didn't go to a game,
this ship,
but I went last year.
It's,

1404
01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:53.020
I mean,
yeah,
it's old,
but you know,
fix it up a little bit.

1405
01:24:53.710 --> 01:24:57.400
All your Mojo is in that fucking park.
Why are you going across the street?

1406
01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:03.070
I don't know who said sad and it made me feel old and uh,

1407
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:05.920
I had this weird thing where I wanted the Yankees to lose.

1408
01:25:05.921 --> 01:25:07.960
So the red sox would clinch a playoff spot,

1409
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.850
but I didn't want the Yankees to lose.

1410
01:25:09.970 --> 01:25:14.410
I didn't want them to lose the last fucking game.
You know what I mean?
I don't,

1411
01:25:14.411 --> 01:25:18.400
I don't take hatred of the Yankees to that fucking level or I'm going to be a

1412
01:25:18.401 --> 01:25:22.180
comment on that night,
you know?
I don't know.
I don't know why they did that.

1413
01:25:22.181 --> 01:25:25.090
And I got to admit,
I saw the new Yankee Stadium and I think it sucks.

1414
01:25:26.170 --> 01:25:29.050
I think it sucks.
You know what it looks like.
It looks like fucking,
uh,

1415
01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:34.510
the new tiger stadium where the old tiger stadium used to be right on top of the

1416
01:25:34.511 --> 01:25:37.360
game.
They,
they,
they,
they get shit to spread out.

1417
01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:39.880
I also thought they were going to do the overhang,

1418
01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:43.300
like the old Yankee Stadium and have the facade up there.
They have it,

1419
01:25:43.301 --> 01:25:46.840
but it's not hanging over the upper deck.
That's what the fuck I wanted to see.

1420
01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:48.220
I wanted to see like,
you know,

1421
01:25:48.221 --> 01:25:50.870
when guys came up to bat be looking out in right field,
you know,

1422
01:25:50.871 --> 01:25:53.920
and Mickey Mantle hit that thing.
That's what I wanted to see.

1423
01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.980
And they didn't do it.
They just,
they got a fucking,
they got,

1424
01:25:57.010 --> 01:25:59.800
they got a couple of nods to the way the thing used to look,

1425
01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:02.380
I'm telling you can be one big fucking Sushi,

1426
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:08.770
one big fucking Sushi bar.
Uh,
it's going to stick.

1427
01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:12.200
I don't like it.
I'm going to tell you right now,
I don't like it.

1428
01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:15.890
I loved going to Yankee Stadium.
I love going there.
They had fucking,
you know,

1429
01:26:15.891 --> 01:26:17.630
you sit up top,
you sit out in the bleachers.

1430
01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:20.600
Those are like the real fans and I swear to God,
those fuckers,

1431
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:23.690
they're not going to be there.
They're going to try to go there.

1432
01:26:23.691 --> 01:26:27.280
They're going to charge him $9 million for a brand new fucking stadium that

1433
01:26:27.281 --> 01:26:31.070
didn't even need it.
Um,
I hope I'm wrong.

1434
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.140
I hope I'm wrong because I noticed last night when I was watching Yankee stadium

1435
01:26:36.141 --> 01:26:40.430
just has the heads of that great fucking sound when the crowd's going nuts.

1436
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:44.780
That used to just drive me nuts when the red sox would fucking lose to them

1437
01:26:44.781 --> 01:26:48.710
every year.
But like,
I just hope the acoustics and the,
they're fucking with it.

1438
01:26:48.711 --> 01:26:50.600
It's like Barbara Streisand getting a nose job.

1439
01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.960
And all of a sudden she never did it because she didn't want to fuck with this

1440
01:26:53.961 --> 01:26:57.690
sound,
this fucking with their entire history doing that shit and like,

1441
01:26:58.010 --> 01:27:01.880
you know what happened to the upper deck collapse?
You know what I mean?

1442
01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:03.860
They're fucking getting rid of it.

1443
01:27:03.861 --> 01:27:08.180
Like the way people get rid of laptops rather than getting some more memory in

1444
01:27:08.181 --> 01:27:09.980
it.
Well fuck it.
I'll drop another three grand.

1445
01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:12.770
Except you guys are paying for the laptop.
You're getting fucked.

1446
01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:17.120
The Ami pot holes is going to be in New York City because of Yankee state new

1447
01:27:17.121 --> 01:27:21.620
Yankee Stadium and the mets got a new stadium and the giants that getting a new

1448
01:27:21.621 --> 01:27:26.270
fucking stadium or the jets can a new stadium.
That's sad sack fucking franchise.

1449
01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:32.150
They played in the baseball field and then they fucking moved into giant
stadium.

1450
01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:38.300
What a fucking loser franchise.
They really aren't.
You know what your problem is?

1451
01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:41.780
Is you got to,
you know,
what is your main fan?

1452
01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:47.330
Is Somebody dressed like a firefighter?
Okay.
And I know he's a real firefighter,

1453
01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:51.680
but when that guy puts them on his shoulders,
I mean Jesus Christ.

1454
01:27:51.681 --> 01:27:53.870
Why don't they just fucking do a fucking,

1455
01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.650
why don't you just join the Goddamn village people?
That's what they look like.

1456
01:27:57.651 --> 01:27:59.660
They look like a cover band for the village.

1457
01:27:59.810 --> 01:28:04.810
I'll read a fire man and you being a blue collar worker and you just put me on

1458
01:28:05.691 --> 01:28:08.900
my shoulder.
You know,

1459
01:28:08.901 --> 01:28:12.350
I just realized that way through that is Angus gets on Brian Johnson's
shoulders.

1460
01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:15.350
I forgot about that.
Speaking of which,
ACDC has a,
uh,

1461
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:20.390
a new world tour coming up and I am calling every favor in that I fucking know.

1462
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:23.180
All right.
I want to sit right next to Phil Rudd's drums.

1463
01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:24.830
That's what I want to sit.
You know,

1464
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:29.040
I got to go see him and his three places to see him neither seem,

1465
01:28:29.041 --> 01:28:30.200
and Madison Square Garden,

1466
01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:35.620
you see him at the La Forum or you go and you fucking see him and Oakland

1467
01:28:35.690 --> 01:28:39.320
Coliseum and uh,
AC DC fans know why that's a big one.

1468
01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:42.320
That's what was one of their first big shows.
They opened up.

1469
01:28:42.321 --> 01:28:46.020
Van Halen was on the bill.
I just read this great book about ACDC cause uh,

1470
01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:49.130
those are the only kind of books I can finish.
You know what I mean?

1471
01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:53.060
I got this book about Churchill and Gandhi.
I mean,
I'm up to page 30.

1472
01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:57.530
I started reading it.
Uh,
I think when Clinton was in office,
helps me go to sleep.

1473
01:28:57.531 --> 01:29:01.030
I like read half a page or like a nurturing and,

1474
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:05.100
and Obama and I just fucking pass out.
Um,

1475
01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:08.980
I just literally lost my train of thought.
Oh,
what the fuck is

1476
01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:10.000
<v 6>term memory?</v>
