1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.470
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.690
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.220
And I'm checking in on you.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.350
You specifically,
not anybody else.

5
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.300
I'm checking in on you.
The kind of person that actually listens.

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.890
How about that?
Huh?
Remember those people,

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.070
whenever something fucking really bad happens,
you can't,

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.230
you literally cannot fucking,

9
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.860
you just cannot go on the Internet and go on to social media.

10
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:43.500
You just can't.
You can't,
you just can't fucking do it.
You know?

11
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.050
And even was some bad just from people just deliberately misinterpret something.

12
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.220
I saw this is fucking jerk off,

13
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.290
was going like congratulations to the eagles who didn't fucking Neil against the

14
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:01.590
national anthem.
You know,
that was never

15
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.410
the guy was doing it.
A peaceful protest about police brutality.

16
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:10.620
Whether he agreed with that or whether you didn't go to

17
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.170
um,
yeah,
when to kneeling become disrespect.

18
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.830
I hate my neighbor.
Anytime he walks out of his house,
I'm going to kneel.

19
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.040
That'll show him
a boy,
uh,

20
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.280
another fucking jerk off dead.
What fucking jerk offs too.

21
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:38.390
And the fucking media is now going to make that person famous and talk about the

22
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:42.230
numbers like it's ESPN when you're talking about dead kids,

23
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.670
it's just fucking unbelievable.
It's unbelievable.
And then there's no way,

24
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.910
there was no way to have any sort of conversation about how to fulfill God's

25
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.510
sakes,
how to try and make this not happen.

26
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.820
This is clearly

27
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.680
something that just didn't happen when I was growing up.

28
00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:10.910
And now ever since that fucking Colorado Shit,

29
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.210
it's like a fad.
Like what the fuck is going on?

30
00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:21.770
And you can literally cannot,
you just can't talk to anybody about it.

31
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.690
You can't,
it's,
everybody gets all fucking,
they're going to take your guns away.

32
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.670
And other people,
we got to get rid of all the guns.
Guns don't kill people.

33
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:36.620
People kill people.
You know?
I Dunno.
I have no idea what the solution is.

34
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.490
I know people on the left literally look at guns is if they're alive and they're

35
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.640
sinister things,
which is ridiculous.

36
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.920
And then people on the other side literally get to the point that they want to

37
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:51.980
buy a bazooka to fucking defend their house.

38
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.990
It's fucking unbelievable.

39
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.650
There's gotta to be some something in the middle that everybody can agree upon

40
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.870
first and foremost.
Yet,

41
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.490
I really truly believe you have got to stop showing these people,

42
00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:14.540
the people that do it and making them famous.

43
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.380
You got to stop fucking doing that.
I don't know.
I don't know.

44
00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:21.680
Maybe I'm fucking wrong.
I have no fucking idea.
And I might be wrong.

45
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.600
I think maybe on a regular basis,

46
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.650
people break into people's houses in groups of 40 and you need to have

47
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.790
an assault rifle.
I don't know.
I don't live in the middle of nowhere.

48
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.490
I do understand this though,
that if you live in the middle of fucking nowhere,

49
00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:42.860
that calling the cops is not an option.

50
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.410
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.960
<v 0>Me,
some of these fucking people that live in farm houses,</v>

52
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:50.980
that goddamn driveway is like eight miles long.
Okay.

53
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.280
So by the time the cops get there and make a right turn to drive all the way up

54
00:03:56.321 --> 00:04:00.730
there fucking driveway,
you know as Jason Vorhees Oh,

55
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:03.550
I was fucking name is chase and his poor farmer round his house.

56
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:08.110
What the fuck is he supposed to do?
You know?
But I dunno.

57
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.883
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.310
<v 0>Isn't a shotgun good?</v>

59
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.340
I know that would stop me.
I don't know what kind of people are out there,

60
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.040
but you know,
some of these kids,

61
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:25.110
they get themselves on the math and in have been still like fucking x men.

62
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.910
So maybe you need an ar 15.
I don't know shit about guns.
I have no idea.

63
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:31.744
But I just,

64
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.530
it's just so bizarre that no one wants what's happening to be happening.

65
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.190
And everybody just starts insulting each other,
you know,

66
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.870
using that stupid fucking,
you know,
liberal snowflake and,
and,

67
00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:52.660
and fucking right wing gun nut.
They just start name calling like any,

68
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.930
I love when people do that.

69
00:04:53.931 --> 00:04:57.080
Like that's gonna make somebody on the other side listen to you.

70
00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.453
<v 1>MMM.</v>

71
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.220
<v 0>I have no idea.
But the first thing that I would do is I would,</v>

72
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.770
I would stop the media coverage

73
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.290
<v 1>of it
and,
uh,</v>

74
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.750
<v 0>I dunno.
Cause for whatever reason,</v>

75
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:17.140
I'm starting to really think that that is feeding this.
I mean,
it's fucking,

76
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.550
it's fucking insane.
It's fucking insane.

77
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.360
And uh,
I dunno,

78
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.520
I just don't think he should know the name of the person.

79
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.330
And when you convict a person,
I think they should immediately be put to death.

80
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.350
And then that's it.
And that's it over.

81
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

82
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.040
<v 0>And the fucking story,
I don't,
I don't know if got a fucking,
we're all,
you know,</v>

83
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.320
all I know is like,

84
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.253
<v 1>yeah,</v>

85
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.650
<v 0>I got a gig tonight and I was going to go on</v>

86
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.770
social media to promote it and to go on there and it's just fucking la.

87
00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:59.150
Everybody just fucking yelling at each other like they do every time.

88
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.070
Um,
I dunno.

89
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.400
What are you going to do?
All right.
They had to get that out there.

90
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.470
I don't know what I just got out there.

91
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.270
I don't know what I just fucking put out there.

92
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:15.150
All I know is I had a great Valentine's Day.
Oh,

93
00:06:15.151 --> 00:06:19.310
did I have a great Valentine's Day?
I actually went out with my lovely wife,

94
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:23.930
which we never fucking do.
I had the best date.
We,

95
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:26.180
uh,
oh my God,
you guys,

96
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.980
I had like the best day I got a facial.

97
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.390
No,
I went to,
um,
I w we,

98
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.130
I took my wife and my lovely daughter,
we went down to a,

99
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.000
we went out to this pizza place out in Pasadena and we went in and it was like a

100
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:45.830
total like townie vibe,

101
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.640
which I really miss that shit since I've left Massachusetts all those years ago

102
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:55.970
and moved to New York City.
There was never a townie vibe in New York City.

103
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:58.790
It's a fucking city now.
I live in La.
It's a fucking city.

104
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.620
But this place had like a,

105
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.680
like I went in there and he just could feel it was like locals and Real Los

106
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.071
Angelenos if that's the word,

107
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:10.880
like grew up like I love meeting people that are from Los Angeles because they

108
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:13.680
don't shit on it the way everybody else who lives out here and be good.

109
00:07:13.681 --> 00:07:16.250
You could get to it.
We can blue.
It's like,
yeah,

110
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:18.170
this traffic because you and I moved out here.

111
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.220
We're part of the problem.
Um,
so we went out there,

112
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:28.790
the pizza was really good and uh,

113
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.880
you know,
got a root beer and all that stuff.

114
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:36.170
Acting like I was in fucking seventh grade again.
And then,
um,

115
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.380
I decided that I was going to take my wife out on Valentine's Day with

116
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:46.310
absolutely no plant.
We didn't make any reservations,

117
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:49.520
none of that bullshit.
She goes,
what do you want to go?
I was like,
I don't know,

118
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:51.760
maybe go find a dive bar.
We'd be,
I dunno,

119
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.920
probably end up at a taco truck tonight.
Let's just go drive around.

120
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.400
So we got all dressed up.
I took her up on Mulholland,

121
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.980
the amazing views,

122
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:05.450
Mulholland drive where a lot of people think that's where James Dean died.
Um,

123
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.590
at least I did for a while.
Um,
he did and he died.
I don't know.
I can't remember.

124
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.210
It's like up near up for like fucking Bakersfield Isam Shit.
But anyways,
we,
uh,

125
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.930
we did that drive and then,
um,

126
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.670
Nia goes,
you know what I would love right now.
She goes,

127
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:24.410
I know I'm not going to get it,
you know,

128
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:28.610
cause it's Valentine state and everything's fucking nuts.
Uh,

129
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.380
I would love like

130
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.460
these fucking tuna tar tar tacos.

131
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.120
And then they got this dessert where they got a fucking chocolate chip cookie in

132
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:41.060
a skillet that they heat up and they put ice cream on top of it.

133
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.560
So you know,
she says that Shit,

134
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.790
I know I'm never going to get it.
So you know me,
I'm right on the hook.

135
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.450
She pulls me in the boat.
I'm like,
well where,
where did they do that?

136
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.700
So says the name of the restaurant.
She goes,
but it's Valentine's Day.

137
00:08:58.701 --> 00:09:01.550
There's no way we're going to get in.
And I was like,
well,
it's just,

138
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.730
that's what everybody's thinking.
Let's just call up,

139
00:09:04.731 --> 00:09:08.630
see if we can just go up to the bar.
So we call the place up and they say,

140
00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:12.380
well no,
unfortunately we're all sold out.
But like outside,

141
00:09:12.381 --> 00:09:17.120
if you want to sit outside those tables by the pool,
so like,
yeah,

142
00:09:17.121 --> 00:09:18.200
fuck it,
we'll do that.

143
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.660
So we show up after just fucking having this nice zen night.

144
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.690
All of a sudden now we drive it to the madness of fucking Valentine's Day.

145
00:09:29.421 --> 00:09:33.650
We pull up this as long line at the valet were the very next car.

146
00:09:33.651 --> 00:09:36.080
And I see this guy walking out with the sign,
I'm like,
oh,

147
00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:40.430
this motherfucker's gonna Save Valley's called bomb sets it down salary.

148
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.030
It's fucking full.
But normally I'd be,

149
00:09:44.031 --> 00:09:47.690
I would have had like a fucking Tourette's moment,
but I just,
I just,

150
00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:50.300
for some reason didn't give a shit.
I rolled down the window.
I said,
all right,

151
00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:53.780
where can I park?
He goes,
you know,
just try to get some street parking,

152
00:09:53.781 --> 00:09:57.380
just read the signs,
Blah Blah Blah.
So,
you know,

153
00:09:57.381 --> 00:10:00.480
my wife's wearing heels and uh oh,

154
00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:02.410
we're wearing our matching me undies underwear too.

155
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.203
<v 1>So</v>

156
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.290
<v 0>I let her lead and she walks away and these new technologies,
cars,</v>

157
00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:15.020
I'm driving away and I'm thinking,
wait,
she has the keys.

158
00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:17.000
Like how is this car still driving?

159
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.380
And I didn't want to stop.
So I drive,
I go around the corner,
I'm like,

160
00:10:22.381 --> 00:10:25.020
it's this thing literally going to conk out in the middle of the street and I

161
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:29.340
find street parking and there's a sign that says no parking any fucking time

162
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.210
unless you have a sticker and all of that.
And I was just like,
ah,

163
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.360
I'll gives a fuck.
I'll get a ticket,
right?

164
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:39.630
So I get out of the car now I realize I can't lock it.

165
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.260
Then I got mail in there and shit.
So now I got to go back down,

166
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:46.260
get the fucking keys.
So I'm walking down the hill and I swear to God,

167
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.900
all of a sudden this kid comes out of this alley

168
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:55.050
and just the way he's walking,
it's just weird.
But he's in front of me,

169
00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:59.960
which I'm fine with.
And then he just stops and he lets me go by and I'm like,

170
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:00.813
ah,
Shit.

171
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.360
<v 2>Okay.</v>

172
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.830
<v 0>But he's small,
right?
But who knows?
Maybe he has an ar 15.
Yeah,</v>

173
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.430
I don't fucking know.
You know he lives in an alley,
right?

174
00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.250
What if 48 homeless people all come at him at once?

175
00:11:15.251 --> 00:11:18.640
The man has to defend himself,
a platoon of homeless people.

176
00:11:18.641 --> 00:11:23.590
So he,
uh,
looks at me,

177
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.450
this is going to sound self serving,
but he dead.
He goes,
ah.
He goes,
I know you,

178
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:34.330
I've seen you Bababa Blah,
blah.
And I'm like,
Hey,
what's going on?

179
00:11:34.331 --> 00:11:37.610
And he goes,
yeah,
I know you're a famous guy.
I am.
I make done.
Not really.

180
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.740
Not really.
He goes,
oh,
you're one of those guys.

181
00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:43.460
You know why you all want to be known about blah?
I'm like,
Dad,
it's not dad.

182
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.640
Just fucking,
you know,
I just want to be like,
no,
dude.
You know what?

183
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:49.490
I'm just walking down the street and you came out of an alley and you're talking

184
00:11:49.491 --> 00:11:53.610
to me and this is fucking weird.
It's socially weird.
You know,
it's weird.

185
00:11:53.611 --> 00:11:57.030
You know,
it's fucking weird.
Stop acting like it's not fucking weird.

186
00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.600
And now you're behind me.
You fucking asshole.
So then I slow down.

187
00:12:00.601 --> 00:12:04.710
Now at least he's beside me.
I forget that was a good martial arts move.

188
00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.650
You know?
Even though I don't know martial arts,
right?

189
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.170
I felt like the Gracie family was a little more little less disappointed in me.

190
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.983
<v 2>MMM.</v>

191
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.130
<v 0>So then he starts talking to me about how he was living in Rome for the last</v>

192
00:12:20.131 --> 00:12:23.010
three months,
and for the first time in his life,

193
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.350
putting living I had of working,

194
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:28.643
<v 2>and</v>

195
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.460
<v 0>he's talking about this shit,
and I'm participating in this conversation.</v>

196
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:34.550
I don't want to be.
And,

197
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.110
and I'm trying to give the quickest fucking answers possible.

198
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:41.323
<v 2>You know,</v>

199
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.930
<v 0>I mean,
I should have just said like,
dude,</v>

200
00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:46.550
I don't want to be in this conversation,

201
00:12:46.551 --> 00:12:48.800
but you know how this fucking world is now.
I don't know.

202
00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:51.770
I don't want to piss him off.
I don't know what he has on him.

203
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:55.663
<v 2>Okay.</v>

204
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.490
<v 0>So anyways,
he starts giving me his philosophy.</v>

205
00:12:58.491 --> 00:13:01.910
He used the word society like three fucking times.
Um,

206
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.330
<v 2>okay.</v>

207
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.870
<v 0>Finally I get to the front of the restaurant and I do my wrap it up.
Move.
Well,</v>

208
00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:09.480
hey man,
it was nice meeting you,
which is a complete fucking lie.

209
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.390
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

210
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.160
<v 0>Amen.</v>

211
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.970
Thank you for that creepy last 40 yards of this walk where I was waiting to fill

212
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:17.530
a knife,
going to my kidneys.

213
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:19.703
<v 2>MMM.</v>

214
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.740
<v 0>You enjoy your evening,
right?
I couldn't say that.
I was like,
Hey,</v>

215
00:13:22.741 --> 00:13:27.510
it was nice talking to you.
If you believe in a higher powered,

216
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.580
is that breaking a commandment of lying?

217
00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.720
Thou shall not lie.

218
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.640
<v 2>Do you know</v>

219
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:40.330
<v 0>Jesus falls followed all the comp commandments?
Right.
Look what happened to him.</v>

220
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.070
Maybe that's why I've been able to lip since I'm 49.
Maybe Jesus should it,

221
00:13:46.071 --> 00:13:50.780
if he lied a little more,
are you the son of God?
No,

222
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.760
I don't know.
I know what you're talking about.

223
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.950
He could have continued his life in construction.

224
00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:57.940
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

225
00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.890
<v 0>It's realized.
I had my fucking Invisalign it</v>

226
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.003
<v 2>out</v>

227
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:08.150
<v 0>by the way,
dude.
My fucking teeth look amazing.
I only got four [inaudible].</v>

228
00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.110
They are so straight.
It's so fucking white.
I swear to God.

229
00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:15.700
I looked like an old bald Farrah Fawcett.
That's how good I look right now.

230
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.550
Let's just say Charlie might have a new angel next season.
Um,

231
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.710
and I'll wear the fairer wig.
I don't give a fuck,
you know,

232
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.890
nice four camera shoot,
get in and out in about three hours.

233
00:14:32.891 --> 00:14:36.150
That's what I'm looking for.
What's the Gig I'm looking for?
Um,
anyways,

234
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.860
plowing ahead.
So then I get in the restaurant and uh,

235
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.000
it was fun.
Hilarious.
I get the keys and then I got to walk back up.

236
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:48.440
Just give me the keys.
I get back up there,
right?
I locked the fucking car.

237
00:14:48.441 --> 00:14:53.441
I'd come back down and it was perfect because we weren't in the main restaurant.

238
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.810
We were out by the pool where they had like heating lamps and it was cold and

239
00:14:57.811 --> 00:14:59.430
shit.
It was where all the single people,

240
00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:04.431
where there's plenty of fucking seats in inside the restaurant was was,

241
00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:07.410
that's where all the drama was.

242
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.740
All the chicks looking at what the other chicks of fucking,

243
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.910
wherein all the guys feeling pressure that they got to give a ring that night.

244
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.190
The fucking marriages that are on the rocks,

245
00:15:17.191 --> 00:15:19.560
but they can dig it up for one more fucking year.

246
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.490
They're going to do this phony dance and go out.
All of that shit was in there.

247
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.620
We fucking walked outside.

248
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:32.000
My wife's up at the bar talking to some woman who was there by herself and

249
00:15:32.001 --> 00:15:36.020
immediately I'm thinking like,
this is fucking unbelievable.
Not only

250
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:41.380
did we get a seat at the restaurant we wanted to go to on Valentine's Day,

251
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.240
I actually have a very small chance at getting a threesome right now.

252
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.190
This is fucking incredible.
So,

253
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.540
so fucking with you guys.
But I'm not gonna lie to you if I didn't.
If I did not,

254
00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.370
if I didn't have that fucking thought,
I'm a man,
baby.
Um,

255
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:05.720
so we're up there,
right.
And,
uh,
we ended up,
uh,
you know,

256
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:06.521
just going over,

257
00:16:06.521 --> 00:16:11.521
we've got a table and literally the exact fucking thing that my beautiful wife

258
00:16:11.801 --> 00:16:15.880
who looked absolutely stunning.
Fucking stunning.

259
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:17.853
Um,

260
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.010
<v 1>yeah,</v>

261
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.690
<v 0>exact thing that she wanted to order.</v>

262
00:16:20.691 --> 00:16:25.691
She was able to order that and I got my phone to poor chap and we just sat there

263
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:26.594
laughing.

264
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:27.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

265
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.330
<v 0>And how perfect.
The evening was in for the first week.</v>

266
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.170
We made no plans whatsoever.
And,
um,

267
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.330
<v 1>okay.</v>

268
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.560
<v 0>And then that was it.
And then we came home.
So I,
all these years,
I,
you know,</v>

269
00:16:40.561 --> 00:16:43.230
it's funny,
the bartender listens to the podcast.

270
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

271
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.930
<v 0>And he goes,
Holy Shit.
He goes,
I thought you didn't go out on Valentine's Day.</v>

272
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.650
Right.
I'm like literally caught it at an accidental lie here.

273
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.940
And so I would just,
I told him,
you know,

274
00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.080
I told him the truth because he didn't walk out of an alley and then slow down

275
00:16:58.081 --> 00:17:02.910
so you could walk behind me.
Um,
that was just like,
yeah,
usually don't,

276
00:17:02.911 --> 00:17:06.540
but it's just sort of fucking came together.
So there you go.
People,

277
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.190
there's a different way.
Go out and don't have any plan.

278
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.630
And you know what year the women kind of liked that,

279
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.110
that there's something that they,
you know,

280
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.350
we say say that knows fucking magazines.
I let it go spontaneous,

281
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:27.650
you know,
take him somewhere where is a view?
Right.
Tell them they look good.

282
00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:30.590
Give him a couple of kisses and that type of shit be all affectionate.

283
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.840
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

284
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.700
<v 0>Now I'm telling you if you just fucking do that and end up at a taco truck,
they,</v>

285
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.760
they,
you know,
at least,

286
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.840
<v 1>okay.</v>

287
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.970
<v 0>They say that that will keep them out.
I,
you know,</v>

288
00:17:41.971 --> 00:17:46.050
something reality is you can't do that every year.
You know what I mean?

289
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.840
Cause you know,
no,
it's just the guys.

290
00:17:48.841 --> 00:17:51.570
If worked one year we're going to do it the next 20 fucking years in a row and

291
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.190
they're going to be bored by the next year.

292
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:58.320
You just didn't put any thought in this at all.
Did you,
we finally talking about,

293
00:17:58.321 --> 00:18:03.150
came up with this last year.
That was last year.
Come up with something else.

294
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.760
You know,
what the fuck did you come up with?

295
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.750
Other than getting yourself all dolled up,
wait,
wait.

296
00:18:10.751 --> 00:18:14.300
Where is your creative input?
Um,

297
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.920
so anyways,
by the way,
speaking of just gimme the keys,
uh,

298
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:21.630
I didn't forget if I mentioned this on Monday.

299
00:18:21.631 --> 00:18:25.830
I went to Todd Rex's tapings and he absolutely fucking murdered.

300
00:18:25.831 --> 00:18:29.190
I'm so proud of them.
Went out there.
It wasn't nervous at all,

301
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.650
just fucking destroyed.
Um,

302
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.540
and it was so fun to watch him making fun of his family and watching his kids

303
00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:43.800
die in laughing like a,
I know kids love their dad,
but I'm telling you,

304
00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:48.570
Todd rex is kids fucking love him.
I,

305
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.201
you know,
it's funny,

306
00:18:49.201 --> 00:18:53.040
I knew how much his kids loved them before I even met his kids.
I was just,

307
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:55.830
he's such as silly,
fun fucking dude.
I was like,
dude,

308
00:18:55.831 --> 00:18:58.260
your key was talking about his kids.
I was like,
dude,
you're fucking kids.

309
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:00.990
Love you.
And he just smiled.
He's like,
yeah,
yeah,
they do.
And I was like,

310
00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:04.710
I bet your wife gets fucking annoyed.
You know?

311
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.330
She's like a big fucking kid.

312
00:19:06.331 --> 00:19:11.331
I feel like I'm going to have that relationship with my wife soon because

313
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.210
I came to tell you how fucking,
what a great it.

314
00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:18.780
My kids like walking now and she actually likes to rough house,

315
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.870
which is awesome.
And um,

316
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.510
basically right before she goes to bed,
you know,

317
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.930
I have her like energy or she's,

318
00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:35.610
I have her so fucking amped up because we played this game in the,
uh,

319
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.960
in the living room where she starts to crawl away and I act like I'm upset and

320
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:44.070
that's how the game started.

321
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:47.370
And then she like starts to crawl away as fast as she can.

322
00:19:47.371 --> 00:19:51.510
Is She screaming and anticipation that I'm going to come up and grab her and

323
00:19:51.511 --> 00:19:53.680
drag her back to the start and she loves playing it.

324
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
That is now evolved into basically I'm crawling behind her like you ever see,

325
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.640
like when the Cheetahs go after like the gazelles or something,

326
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:05.790
in the end they swipe their back legs so they wipe out.
I mean,

327
00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:08.580
I'm not doing that to her,
but I'm sure they're like grabbing at her foot.

328
00:20:08.581 --> 00:20:12.780
Just got,
ah,
ah.
She's like,
yeah,
like fucking freaking out.

329
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.830
I get her all the way amped up in every night.

330
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.360
We'd die and laugh and Nia sitting there going like,
Bill,
Bill,

331
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.290
this is the time where we try to lower the stimulation.

332
00:20:25.291 --> 00:20:28.670
We shut off the TV and I'm all out of breath.
Like what?

333
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.690
We're having a good time.
She loves it.
So,
um,
I feel like I'm going to have that,

334
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:38.690
but that same type of relationship.
But um,
anyways,
plowing ahead.
I had a,

335
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.360
uh,
added Great Valentine's Day.
I hope you did too.

336
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.610
Um,
so

337
00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.940
the big news,
the big news,

338
00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:55.950
the Patrice O'Neal benefit is this Tuesday the sixth annual Patrice O'Neal

339
00:20:55.951 --> 00:20:59.130
benefit.
Um,
one of my favorite gigs.

340
00:20:59.131 --> 00:21:02.460
So this year of the year I should say.
And uh,
you know,

341
00:21:02.461 --> 00:21:06.600
I get to run into all comics that I always see.
Um,

342
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.010
I don't know.
It's like a high school reunion and all that type of shit.

343
00:21:11.011 --> 00:21:13.290
So looking forward to that once again,

344
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.520
it's going to sell out as it has the previous five years.

345
00:21:17.521 --> 00:21:21.820
So I want to thank everybody who went on the air that bought tickets.
Uh,

346
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.870
Blahblahblahblahblah and are you guys watching the Olympics at all?

347
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.310
I haven't been watching as much as I,
you know,

348
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.530
I was at a bar and I was watching curling,
which of course I love,

349
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.350
it's so fucking peaceful watching that shit.

350
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.023
<v 1>MMM.</v>

351
00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.200
<v 0>I don't know what it is and I still don't understand the fucking game,</v>

352
00:21:40.201 --> 00:21:44.460
but I really enjoy watching it.
And uh,

353
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.480
so when we were out at the bar on Valentine's Day,

354
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:54.020
not having to wait for a table and getting our food pretty damn quickly,

355
00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.190
um,
we were watching the downhill skiing.

356
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.480
If you ever heard the audio of that,
those fucking lunatics,

357
00:22:03.481 --> 00:22:08.481
the men and women that have the fucking nerve to go up to the top of a mountain,

358
00:22:09.421 --> 00:22:11.460
he just point this skis down.
Do you know,

359
00:22:11.461 --> 00:22:16.350
like they are dealing with such like chief forces.
They're literally yelling.

360
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.550
Like anytime they go into a turn a,
they're like going like,

361
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.690
<v 3>oh,</v>

362
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.120
<v 0>I have to see that live and I want to be like halfway down the slope just to</v>

363
00:22:33.931 --> 00:22:36.120
watch somebody go by me.
At 80,

364
00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:41.121
90 miles an hour going down of fucking mountain with God Damn Swag Skis on,

365
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.980
just screaming.
Just,

366
00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:53.920
I mean,
you know,

367
00:22:53.921 --> 00:22:58.570
it's like people routinely die in that fucking sport,

368
00:22:58.571 --> 00:23:01.750
the level of balls that that takes.

369
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.750
And then I was watching the cross country skiing,
right?

370
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:08.680
And just like how fast they're going and the level of cardio.

371
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.740
It was the women doing it and I was just thinking,

372
00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:15.250
there's no way to please that woman in bed.

373
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:19.060
Like the level of her cardio,
she's going to be going harder,
harder.

374
00:23:19.061 --> 00:23:22.810
You like fuck.
You know,
she just sitting there not even breaking a sweat.

375
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.730
It's like the,

376
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:30.170
she can cross country ski from it for fucker where I live out to South Dakota

377
00:23:30.171 --> 00:23:31.430
without even breaking a sweat.

378
00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.640
What the fuck am I going to do to you in the bedroom is going to even remotely

379
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.070
make you even realize it's happening.

380
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.060
These are the things that I think of when I watched the Olympics.

381
00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.073
<v 1>Okay.</v>

382
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:49.200
<v 0>Um,
anyways,
just plow ahead.
Um,</v>

383
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.300
these lunatic liberals,

384
00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.290
these right wing gun nuts,
eh,
you're all,
y'all.

385
00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.640
Every one of you fucking annoys the shit out of me.

386
00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:06.250
What kind of an adult you can,
can you just,
just present your opinion.

387
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.700
So we should make some afterschool special movie where like people who are into

388
00:24:13.701 --> 00:24:18.520
guns and people who are afraid of guns as if they're alive.
Um,

389
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.940
I remember I wanted to get a gun,
you know,
for,
for a home security.

390
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:27.080
I didn't want to get a fucking machine gun,
you know,

391
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:29.320
<v 1>okay.</v>

392
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.530
<v 0>Coming home with like fucking dead and traders and then they all the hell that</v>

393
00:24:32.531 --> 00:24:34.120
plaster work I have to do.

394
00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:38.320
I kind of [inaudible] she couldn't just fucking get out of pistol,
you know,

395
00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:43.000
squeeze one off.
But there's all these fucking theories too,

396
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:43.893
by the way.

397
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.390
There's all these goddamn theories on which is the best one for home security.

398
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.141
It,
you know what?

399
00:24:50.141 --> 00:24:54.490
I really believe that it probably depends on where you live in the world.

400
00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.810
What is the best one?
Um,

401
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.000
you know,
cause what are you going to do at this point?

402
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:04.310
Are you going to band guns?
They're already out there.

403
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.340
And I always loved that there's a ban on guns and it's just like,

404
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.410
oh like all the criminals are going to be like,
ah,

405
00:25:09.411 --> 00:25:13.310
well I guess we can't get up and then only they have them.

406
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.753
MMM.

407
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.150
Is there any way to like booby trap your house?

408
00:25:21.151 --> 00:25:24.450
Why don't we get just get like human size glue traps.

409
00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.460
You know like you'd do from mice.

410
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.660
You just put them all the way around your house next to every door and every

411
00:25:33.661 --> 00:25:36.090
window.
Right?
It looks like it's grass.

412
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.730
And then when some rapists to some piece of shit goes in and then just the next

413
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.620
morning they're just sitting there looking at you with this stupid ski mass on

414
00:25:43.621 --> 00:25:46.650
stuck in the glue.
Why can't they just do something like that?

415
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.003
<v 1>MMM.</v>

416
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.670
<v 0>I Dunno bill.
Cause it would be prohibitively expensive.</v>

417
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:59.040
Are you going to get all that glue?
How many horses have to die?
All right.

418
00:25:59.041 --> 00:26:00.990
He looks everybody helix.

419
00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.820
There are a ton of online mattress retailers popping up these days.

420
00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:10.410
All with a one size fits all solution to a better sleep.
Guess what?

421
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:15.340
One size doesn't fits all doesn't work.
Of course it doesn't.

422
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.920
One size doesn't fit all.
It never has.
Um,

423
00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.330
it's a half shirt for one person.
The other person,

424
00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:26.600
it's it that they're walking around in a nightclub.
He likes sleep.

425
00:26:26.601 --> 00:26:29.030
Offers something that doesn't exist anywhere else.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:20.470
I went to church with my whole family.
Okay.
Uh,

493
00:31:20.471 --> 00:31:22.990
my mother in law was like,
listen,
you guys should go to church.

494
00:31:22.991 --> 00:31:27.190
They're going to have a Dixie land band.
And,
uh,

496
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.600

497
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:37.390

It's a bunch of old guys.
Okay.

499
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.610
You don't Trump a Trump owned tuba clarinet.

500
00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:47.260
A Guy Paulino marching down with the snare drum playing that New Orleans jazz

501
00:31:47.261 --> 00:31:50.310
shit.
It was fucking awesome.
And I remember just thinking like if they,

502
00:31:50.311 --> 00:31:52.930
if they did this every week,
I would,
I would go all the time.

503
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:59.090
Why is this a once a day,
once a year,
like Mardi gras mass.
Um,

504
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:04.370
but I gotta admit I actually enjoyed going there with my family even though,

505
00:32:04.371 --> 00:32:07.430
you know,
I don't buy into all of the guilt and you know,

506
00:32:07.431 --> 00:32:10.700
he did know in all of that shit.
Um,

507
00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:15.470
you know what's funny is my daughter does this thing,
well,
you know,

508
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.140
they'd like deal,

509
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.910
she's like trying out her voice and she kind of learned that she can go like way

510
00:32:19.911 --> 00:32:24.140
down low lag.
Right?
So she kinda that we call it the monster,

511
00:32:24.141 --> 00:32:28.100
like do the monster,
and she just goes like blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

512
00:32:28.101 --> 00:32:28.934
Right?

513
00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:33.380
So we're at church and the preacher's talking and all that shit,
you know,

514
00:32:33.381 --> 00:32:36.560
so I'm bored,
right?
So I start whispering in her ear,

515
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:40.650
I'm going to go to the monster,
do the monster.

516
00:32:40.651 --> 00:32:44.250
So he's up there telling Jesus stories,
right?
And my daughter starts going like,

517
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:45.283
wow.

518
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.123
<v 3>Ah,</v>

519
00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:50.050
<v 0>like she was possessed.
It,</v>

520
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.040
he is getting all mad at me and I keep telling her to do what it was fucking,

521
00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.950
it was killing me and I get in.

522
00:32:56.951 --> 00:33:01.951
Jesus saw the leper and he wasn't afraid to touch him and he showed that love is

523
00:33:02.351 --> 00:33:03.580
the answer.
And my daughter's going,

524
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.833
<v 3>wow.</v>

525
00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:10.760
<v 0>Everything with her head spinning around.
Um,
oh,</v>

526
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:15.370
we had such a good fucking time.
And,
uh,
I dunno,
I actually enjoyed going,

527
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:16.810
it was sort of a tea,
you know,

528
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.630
I used to go every week with my family and everything and I actually think it's

529
00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:25.040
a good thing if you don't a hundred percent buy in,
at least with my religion,

530
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:27.320
that this,
this is the only thing that you can worship.

531
00:33:27.321 --> 00:33:29.750
This is the only way to do it.
And all of that shit.

532
00:33:29.751 --> 00:33:34.160
Some actually thinking about going to church,

533
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:37.370
which then what would you do if I just slowly became this,

534
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:41.870
this psycho conservative,
not like a regular decent conservative person,

535
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.950
you know,
cause I don't have any beef with those people.
I feel like I'm liberal.

536
00:33:45.951 --> 00:33:48.680
Although out here in Hollywood,
people think I voted for Trump.

537
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.530
That's how liberal it is out here.
Um,

538
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.290
but uh,

539
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.490
what would you guys do if I fucking went down that whole road and started going,

540
00:33:58.491 --> 00:34:03.010
you liberal snowflakes,
you know,
Yay.
Taken my gun

541
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.490
back when the people said,

542
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:12.320
you know when they wrote this shit at you have the right to bear arms even

543
00:34:12.321 --> 00:34:17.270
though they didn't have any concept of a machine gun and what the fuck that

544
00:34:17.271 --> 00:34:19.910
could do?
Um,
I,
okay,
so here's the thing,

545
00:34:19.911 --> 00:34:23.630
I would like to hear from people that are into guns.
What is your solution?

546
00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.130
How do you prevent cause this,

547
00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:29.690
they sell a zillion of those fucking things a year,
right?

548
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.580
I have no stats on this,
but I know,

549
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.410
I know they sell it because if I was in the guns that's what the fuck I would

550
00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:39.920
want.
I would want a fucking machine gun cause that's like the Ferrari.

551
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.520
Every gun nut.
I'm every car nut once a fucking,

552
00:34:43.521 --> 00:34:45.680
you know a supercar

553
00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.850
so I totally get if you were in the guns like dude,
I,
I,
you know what?

554
00:34:51.851 --> 00:34:56.290
I can't get that now cause this fucking asshole does that.
So how about this?

555
00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.200
All right,
you going to know way more about this.
So much.

556
00:34:59.201 --> 00:35:00.610
Somebody that's in the guns.

557
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:04.150
All right and has one of those guns and all that type of shit.

558
00:35:04.151 --> 00:35:09.010
What is your solution?
Because it just seems like whenever this happens,

559
00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:14.370
liberal people go,
you know,
we got,
I,
we got a bad fucking assault.

560
00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.930
Well we got back and read it every day.
They go that way.

561
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:23.300
And then people on the right say,
uh,
you know,
you know,

562
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.860
we,
we don't need to ban guns.
We,
this is alluded tick problem.

563
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:32.240
It's not a gun issue.
It's a loan,
a tick prom.
Um,

564
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.410
and I find it,
I find that fascinating because,

565
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:43.040
uh,
they keep using the ar 15,

566
00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:48.800
you know,
and they're literally killing children.
It's schools

567
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:54.270
and people are still like defending.
That's,
that's fascinating to me.

568
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:59.610
So I would like to know what the argument is without you yelling and flipping

569
00:35:59.611 --> 00:36:03.660
the fuck out.
I'm just asking just so I can understand it.

570
00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:04.920
That's all I want to do.

571
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.850
I don't need to listen to fucking you conservative Jesus,
freak,

572
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:13.260
fucking liberal snowflake,
all of that fucking childish shit.

573
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:16.200
Cause we all know that.
I don't do name calling.

574
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:19.363
I'm just,

575
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.573
<v 2>yeah,</v>

576
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.780
<v 0>interesting to me.
Like,
I love my Jaguar,</v>

577
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:31.220
but if once every six weeks someone drove it through his school and ran people

578
00:36:31.891 --> 00:36:34.380
over and they wanted to be like,
hey,
you know,

579
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.060
I don't know what it is about that car,

580
00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:38.850
but these fucking people won't stop doing that with the car.

581
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.490
I would get another car,
I would just get a different one.

582
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.770
I'd be all right with that.
Personally,
it's just a car.

583
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:51.360
Cars don't kill people.
Lunatic should be fucking,
but you know all of that shit.

584
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.840
Guns don't kill people.
People kill people.

585
00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.230
Well then why would you want to give them guns if that's what they're going to

586
00:36:58.231 --> 00:37:01.080
do?
Can we,
can we raise the degree of difficulty?

587
00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.773
<v 2>Okay.</v>

588
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.520
<v 0>How about this?
How about if you're under age?</v>

589
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.890
If you're up school age,

590
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:12.030
the only gun they'll give you as a revolutionary war era one where you got to

591
00:37:12.031 --> 00:37:16.510
take out that rod and pack it down,
you know,
take out the tea bag,
you know,

592
00:37:16.511 --> 00:37:17.580
when a little gunpowder.

593
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:21.900
How about you're only allowed to have one of those that work?
No,

594
00:37:21.901 --> 00:37:26.340
because that fucking asshole in Las Vegas was a of a certain age.

595
00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.900
I wonder how you could do it.
There's gotta be some sort of space,

596
00:37:32.901 --> 00:37:35.660
age thing that you could do.
You know what I mean?

597
00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:41.500
What if you get the,
I just like some big brother's shit.
They somehow like,

598
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.950
it's like,
uh,
uh,
if you get an assault weapon,

599
00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:51.450
then this some millennial who has to sit there and every time you pick it up has

600
00:37:51.451 --> 00:37:54.990
to be watching what you're aiming it at and they have a kill switch so they can

601
00:37:54.991 --> 00:37:58.090
either turn it on just,
I don't know how to fucking do I,

602
00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:01.790
why do I act like I have solutions,
whatever.
I would just,
you know what,

603
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:03.120
I would just at this point,

604
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.490
it's so depressing to see this shit and the frequency that it happens.
It would,

605
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.990
it would,
I at least at the very least,
if the could just be some calm,

606
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:13.771
rational,

607
00:38:13.771 --> 00:38:18.771
somehow discussion of it with some solutions that just seemed like he could just

608
00:38:18.991 --> 00:38:22.140
make this stop,
talk that,
make this stop talking,

609
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.180
make the stop happening.
Um,
so what do you miss?
I Dunno.
I don't fucking know.

610
00:38:27.181 --> 00:38:29.340
So anyway,
I,
so I go to church,
right?

611
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.960
And my daughter started getting fussy and shit like that and she wanted to crawl

612
00:38:33.961 --> 00:38:36.670
around the floor.
It's like,
I'm not going to add,
let you crawl around the floor.

613
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.520
All right?
So I just get up,

614
00:38:39.521 --> 00:38:44.200
I walked to the back of the church or whatever and I sit down there and in the

615
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:48.940
end,
you know,
in my religion you go up and you get the,
uh,
the Eucharist.

616
00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:50.443
All right.

617
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:55.620
And I had done it in a long time and I had not also been absolved of my sins.

618
00:38:56.411 --> 00:38:59.380
I didn't go into the little walk in closet with the fucking creep,

619
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.250
tell him all the shit that I did,
just so fucking weird.
It's so dumb.

620
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.030
So I walk up there and I don't know,

621
00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:11.620
I just was like dealing with my daughter and then I was dealing with the fact

622
00:39:11.621 --> 00:39:14.560
that I felt like I was in a crowd.
So I kind of went into like,

623
00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:17.710
after my show mode and I wasn't really thinking,

624
00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.353
<v 1>uh,</v>

625
00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:26.990
<v 0>and the lady goes,
she goes to the body of Christ and I said,
hey,
thanks a lot.</v>

626
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.190
She looked at me weird and then I took it.
It wasn't until I ate it,

627
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.960
I realize what I just said to her.

628
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.210
You supposed to say body Christ is supposed to say Amen I suppose.
Say Hey,

629
00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:41.110
thanks a lot.

630
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:45.520
Like I was literally like after shows when I'm walking out,

631
00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:51.190
you know,
and people,
Hey,
I do really judge.
Hey,
thanks a lot.
You just,
hey man,

632
00:39:51.191 --> 00:39:52.960
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you.

633
00:39:52.961 --> 00:39:57.100
Just go into this fucking mode so you can get from point a to point B.

634
00:39:57.101 --> 00:39:58.800
I went into that mode for whatever reason,

635
00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:02.710
cause my daughter was all fussy and I could tell she needed a diaper change and

636
00:40:02.711 --> 00:40:05.230
my wife had the,
all this stuff and she was up at the front.

637
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:08.440
I was dealing with all of that Shit Shit.
And then I was like in a crowd,

638
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:12.520
the body of Christ,
Hey,
thanks a lot.

639
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.660
That's gotta be up there.
Top five things you're not supposed to say.
Right.

640
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.720
What are some other things that you probably shouldn't say?

641
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:29.930
The body of Christ Gross,
right?
Can't say that.
Hey,

642
00:40:29.931 --> 00:40:33.410
can I get another one of those things?
I didn't have breakfast.
Uh,
Hey,

643
00:40:33.411 --> 00:40:38.000
can I get another one?
This one seems a little stale
things you shit,

644
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.910
this is like a talk show plays and jellies and things.

645
00:40:40.911 --> 00:40:44.570
You shouldn't say when accepting the EUCHARISTIC.

646
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:49.280
Um,
but I actually did enjoy,
I actually really enjoyed going,

647
00:40:49.281 --> 00:40:52.160
I can't fucking believe it.
And um,
I talked to my,

648
00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:56.970
my laugh and she's also a non church going where we'll for Hollywood phoneys

649
00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.770
people.
Okay,
we're safeness.
We don't go to church.
Right.

650
00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.670
Um,
she was actually,
you know what,
I enjoyed it too.

651
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.540
It's kind of a nice tradition or whatever,
you know,

652
00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.250
that's part of being a parent,

653
00:41:10.251 --> 00:41:14.390
making your kid get up earlier than the kid wants to and making them dress up to

654
00:41:14.391 --> 00:41:18.500
go to some shit they don't want to go to.
So we make God,
you know,

655
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:21.850
there's something about doing that to your kid that um,

656
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.560
makes them not be a spoiled Brat.

657
00:41:24.561 --> 00:41:27.740
We used to always go to church and then afterwards we would go to Dunkin donuts.

658
00:41:27.741 --> 00:41:31.190
We get a dozen donuts and then we,
we wake up the morning,

659
00:41:31.191 --> 00:41:35.000
we do our paper routes and my dad would us around me and a Chevy Chevette and we

660
00:41:35.001 --> 00:41:37.340
would load it up with all these Sunday papers.

661
00:41:37.341 --> 00:41:39.230
We'd have the hatchback open and we'd be,

662
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.350
me and my older brother be riding with their legs hanging out the back because

663
00:41:42.351 --> 00:41:45.680
my dad was like in fourth gay,
what Brad Brad drag driving down the street.

664
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:50.240
He did Gospel music blaring
and uh,

665
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.960
we will be running around and he loved it.
He loved it.

666
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:55.740
My Dad wants people never gets cold either.

667
00:41:55.741 --> 00:42:00.710
He'd always have the fucking window down.
And um,
why one of my elder brothers,

668
00:42:00.711 --> 00:42:04.790
we put in the papers together in the back seat and then all the ones that were

669
00:42:04.791 --> 00:42:08.090
ready to be delivered where we're in the way back in and we would just be

670
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:10.850
running and we would come home

671
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:16.130
and uh,
then put on church clothes.
We'd drive,
go to church,

672
00:42:16.131 --> 00:42:17.330
then we'd go to Dunkin donuts.

673
00:42:17.331 --> 00:42:22.331
And me coming to the every fucking Sunday from the time I was in third grade

674
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:27.470
right up until high school.
I mean,
I had a paper forever.
I always had a job,

675
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.760
you know,
from third grade on,
I had money,

676
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.700
I had all his kids I went to school with.
They're just like,
ah,
you know,
I broke.

677
00:42:35.701 --> 00:42:39.290
The parents are bad.
They will give me money to get a fucking paper route.

678
00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.900
Anytime I want to football cards,
I could buy them.

679
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:46.790
<v 2>Okay.</v>

680
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:51.210
<v 0>You know,
I want it.
That's all I did.
I bought football cards and hockey cards,</v>

681
00:42:51.211 --> 00:42:56.040
baseball cards,
and I bought candy.
That was it.
That was my fucking overhead.

682
00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:56.963
<v 2>Okay.</v>

683
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.080
<v 0>And then when I went to school,
if I wanted lunch,
if I wanted doubles,</v>

684
00:43:01.081 --> 00:43:02.130
I always had money,

685
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.030
never on a number and just said these fucking kids like they'd be like in

686
00:43:06.031 --> 00:43:11.010
seventh,
eighth grade,
still go to their parents for money.
Um,

687
00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:12.990
I was independent.
All right.

688
00:43:12.991 --> 00:43:15.840
Enough with me fucking blowing myself here on the podcast above.

689
00:43:15.841 --> 00:43:20.760
What a hard worker,
Ryan.
All right,
that is the podcast.
All right?

690
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:27.000
God bless you for not having a gun.
God bless you for having a gun responsibly.

691
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:31.050
You know what?
God bless everyone.
All right?

692
00:43:31.051 --> 00:43:34.140
Except for these assholes that go into schools and do what they do and for the

693
00:43:34.141 --> 00:43:34.974
love of God,

694
00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.720
can you stop fucking putting their faces all over the place and giving them

695
00:43:39.721 --> 00:43:42.780
their 15 minutes of fame.
You know what I mean?

696
00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:45.480
Like they appreciate it.

697
00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:47.740
<v 2>Okay.</v>

698
00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:52.030
<v 0>Go out and do some fucking open mikes and do some hotel rooms for 20 years</v>

699
00:43:52.031 --> 00:43:55.870
before you get anything.
Okay?
Giving it to these fucking assholes overnight.

700
00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.610
All right.
I'm in Santa Barbara Tonight.

701
00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:02.230
I'm up there with Dean del Rey and Paul Versey.
Ed,
uh,

702
00:44:02.231 --> 00:44:06.970
I'm going to fly him up and
I ain't want,

703
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:10.120
I'm flying.
I'm flying with the instructor by the way.

704
00:44:10.121 --> 00:44:12.580
I did my first solo in about a year and a half.
Uh,

705
00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.970
I flew like 20 something hours already this year.

706
00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:21.460
And uh,
my auto rotations are fucking,
we would,
we did this thing,

707
00:44:21.461 --> 00:44:25.150
my instructor,
we will coming in for landing and as I was turning base,

708
00:44:25.151 --> 00:44:28.600
he just goes engine failure and just chop the throttle and he goes,

709
00:44:28.601 --> 00:44:31.050
put it down on the numbers and I had to do like fucking ass turns.

710
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:35.130
I was coming in too fast and I fucking put it right down on the numbers and he

711
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:37.380
goes,
dude,
the fucking nailed it.
That was all you.

712
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:41.440
I one of the best compliments I ever got.
And um,

713
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.010
I ended up uh,

714
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:48.450
solo in a few days later and I just flew around the bay,

715
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.110
the basin out of Burbank,
in fact,
into Burbank.
And I did everything.

716
00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:55.740
Great radio calls were great.
It was a really windy day.

717
00:44:55.741 --> 00:45:00.120
I just flew slow and
it was funny,

718
00:45:00.121 --> 00:45:03.390
I was listening to the atus was just basically the recording the information,

719
00:45:03.391 --> 00:45:07.040
you know,
wind is still the seven and all that bullshit.
Right?
And then they,

720
00:45:07.041 --> 00:45:11.250
in the end they always go,
you know,
Information Mike or Information Bravo.
Right.

721
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:16.490
I have everything fucking down and I'm nervous about Landon in Burbank because

722
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:20.010
you know,
it's a busy fucking airport.
Right.
And uh,

723
00:45:20.011 --> 00:45:22.830
I swear to God it sounded like the guy,
this computer voice,

724
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:27.540
he said information Ricky.
I'm like,
what the fuck is Ricky?

725
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:32.320
This is just basically for pilot nerds and like what the fuck?
So I'm going go,

726
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.890
obviously he didn't say Ricky cause it's Romeo.

727
00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:40.140
It's not Ricky fucking Ricardo.
What are we talking about here?

728
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.340
So now I got to think like,

729
00:45:41.341 --> 00:45:45.570
what the fuck did they just say that sounded like Ricky buddy is alone.

730
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:50.490
Alpha Bravo,
Charlie Delta.
But I'm flying getting into their airspace.

731
00:45:50.491 --> 00:45:51.780
So if I just said fuck it,

732
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.300
I said Burbank Tower Helicopter Blahblahblahblahblah at the Hollywood sign

733
00:45:57.301 --> 00:45:59.280
requesting fullstop at Atlantic.

734
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.670
I listened to the 80s but I don't know what information to this,

735
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.880
but I know it's that Ricky,
when I landed,
my instructor goes,
Ricky,

736
00:46:08.881 --> 00:46:13.170
he goes whiskey.
And I was like,
oh,
all right.
So there's always something.

737
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:18.510
And uh,
so I went in and they,
they told me to hold,

738
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.720
they call it old Maaco.
It's the Macy's out by the one 70.

739
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:23.520
And they said your number three.

740
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:27.240
So I see a southwest coming in and then there's some little Cessna and I can't

741
00:46:27.241 --> 00:46:31.140
find the guy.
But at this point I know basically where to look.

742
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.320
And I know where the runway is.
It's like,
well,

743
00:46:34.321 --> 00:46:38.310
I'll just fucking look over there and I'll keep doing my little left orbits
here.

744
00:46:38.311 --> 00:46:40.470
And then I saw the guy and then I was like,
alright.

745
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:44.760
And he fucking went in landed.
And when we know where you landed,
Burbank,

746
00:46:44.761 --> 00:46:48.190
there's always a tailwind now when you land,
but when you,

747
00:46:48.191 --> 00:46:52.140
you go right as you go to set the fucking helicopter down,

748
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:55.230
this is fucking ridiculous tailwind.

749
00:46:55.231 --> 00:46:58.140
And I always sit there stirring the pot and if somebody finally told me,
no,

750
00:46:58.141 --> 00:46:59.910
it's shipped pedals,
you're pells keep it straight.

751
00:46:59.911 --> 00:47:03.300
So I got myself a little straight straight and just sorta stabbed it,

752
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:06.950
set it down,
rolled down.
And now he said this the same thought I always have.

753
00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:11.670
All right,
I didn't kill myself.
Um,
and I had a great time when I was up there,

754
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.070
right?
And then of course I get in,
you know,
this,
this,

755
00:47:14.071 --> 00:47:18.090
this allegedly really dangerous thing that I'm doing flying,
you know,

756
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:21.480
I get in my car and I get on the highway and what do I see?

757
00:47:21.481 --> 00:47:23.730
Some massive fucking accident on the highway,

758
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.310
which is what happens every fucking time.

759
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:30.610
And the more I fly the lesson,
I'm afraid in a good way.

760
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:35.670
I'm still super conscious of being up there and it is that fear goes down every

761
00:47:36.491 --> 00:47:39.790
time I get on.
I'm like,
like an old man now.
When I get on the highway,

762
00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.910
I'm fucking terrified at how fast people go,

763
00:47:42.911 --> 00:47:45.700
how they pass on the right other on their fucking phones.

764
00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.740
You always know when somebody is on their phone,

765
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:51.790
especially if you're in like traffic,
you know what I mean?

766
00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:55.570
Is because like the person in front of you start in front of them,

767
00:47:55.571 --> 00:48:00.400
starts driving and they just don't move for like eight seconds.

768
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:04.810
Then you feed psyches.
This person's literally on their phone right now,

769
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:09.100
like reading tweets.
Um,
anyways.
All right,

770
00:48:09.101 --> 00:48:12.610
that is the podcast.
Uh,
here's some fucking music for you.

771
00:48:12.611 --> 00:48:16.480
And then we got a half hour of a Thursday afternoon podcast from back in the day

772
00:48:16.481 --> 00:48:21.270
or a couple of Thursdays ago.
All right.
That's it.
Have a great weekend.
You see?

773
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:22.263
I'll talk to you on Monday.

774
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.153
<v 3>Does</v>

775
00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:52.953
she was,

776
00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.753
yeah,

777
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:22.863
no

778
00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.600
<v 0>touch day advice.
Billy by Derris billion.</v>

779
00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:38.820
I know this is last minute.
I had a question about Valentine's Day.

780
00:49:38.821 --> 00:49:41.820
I am a single guy in my mid twenties rejoice,

781
00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:45.670
dude,
I'm going to tell you right now,

782
00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:51.900
if you're a single guy in your mid twenties and you live in America and you're

783
00:49:52.151 --> 00:49:54.340
living on your own,
please

784
00:49:55.930 --> 00:50:00.310
drop to your knees and thank whatever God you pray to every day because you're

785
00:50:00.311 --> 00:50:01.870
never going to be free or in your life.

786
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.570
I know you've probably got student loans and blah,
blah,
blah.

787
00:50:04.571 --> 00:50:08.230
This stress and all that bullshit.
Fuck that,
okay?

788
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:10.720
Getting never going to be freer in your life.

789
00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:16.930
Go get three years supplies of condoms,
okay,

790
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:21.250
and bang away my friend.
Maybe you don't need to do it for three years.

791
00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:22.930
Maybe you're one of those guys for only three weeks,

792
00:50:22.931 --> 00:50:26.380
but you need to get it out of your system.
All right?
He says,

793
00:50:26.381 --> 00:50:30.230
I never really had a girlfriend for whatever reason.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
All right,

794
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.810
we're going the whole other other way.
Truth be told,

795
00:50:32.811 --> 00:50:36.770
my friends could name numerous reasons why I don't have a girlfriend,

796
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:39.850
but that's an entirely different issue.
What?

797
00:50:39.851 --> 00:50:42.350
Jesus Christ as a fucking can of worms.

798
00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:45.383
<v 4>They can,</v>

799
00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:51.030
<v 0>you don't seem defensive or argumentative.
So I dunno if it's an anger issue,</v>

800
00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:52.460
outlook.
I'm so,

801
00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.920
I'm so sick of trying to be fucking Hannibal Lecter here to try to guess what

802
00:50:55.921 --> 00:51:00.330
your shoes look like with w with the way you write,
you know.
All right.

803
00:51:00.331 --> 00:51:02.730
I'm just going to read the rest of the shit.
Uh,
as of right now,

804
00:51:02.731 --> 00:51:06.240
I am currently sleeping with three girls off.
Oh,
see you fucking,

805
00:51:06.241 --> 00:51:10.040
you get knocking it out.
I thought you'd like never had a girlfriend like in,

806
00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:12.510
you'd never bagged anybody.
All right.
My fault.

807
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:14.623
<v 4>All right.</v>

808
00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.070
<v 0>To go fuck yourself.</v>

809
00:51:17.071 --> 00:51:20.770
You're a guy in your mid twenties and you fucking three girls right now and
this,

810
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:24.150
you need advice.
I keep doing what you're doing

811
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:29.880
anyways,
depending on what day of the week it is and how much I've drank.
Okay.

812
00:51:29.881 --> 00:51:32.880
That depends on how many girls he's banging a,
I've never lied to anything,

813
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:37.990
any of any of them about where our relationship is going.

814
00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.560
And although they never met each other,

815
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:45.990
each of them has an idea that I'm seeing other girls.
It's kind of a don't ask,

816
00:51:45.991 --> 00:51:50.830
don't tell policy.
Uh,
yeah,
dude and I,
you got to come with that.
You know,

817
00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.230
you can open with that.
You know,
what are you doing?
I'm dating,

818
00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:58.710
I'm playing the field.
Find people you date right now.

819
00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:02.690
A couple of people kind of see him just having a good time.
Well,

820
00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:05.490
I anti stuff like that.
Well there's the door sweetheart,

821
00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.260
then they'll respect like that.
The honesty of that.
Some won't.

822
00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:13.180
Some will actually have self esteem and walked out,

823
00:52:13.181 --> 00:52:16.570
but a lot of them they'll hang around eventually.
They get tired,

824
00:52:16.571 --> 00:52:20.680
they're neck gets weak and they'll fall right in your fucking Dick.
Um,

825
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:25.090
birthdays and Christmas are always a piece of cake because all that requires a

826
00:52:25.091 --> 00:52:29.260
quick text or a phone call or at the very most drinks at the bar.

827
00:52:29.261 --> 00:52:30.820
But Valentine's Day is tricky.

828
00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:34.600
Our dates consist of bar hopping and drunk sex.

829
00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:39.220
So flowers and a nice dinner would completely send the wrong message.
Dude,

830
00:52:39.221 --> 00:52:40.150
you selfish cunt.

831
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:43.960
Are you asking me how to keep banging these three chicks while getting through

832
00:52:43.961 --> 00:52:45.010
Valentine's Day?

833
00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:48.330
Why don't you just look at the Valentine's Day like that's your pussy getting

834
00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:49.330
all star break.

835
00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:55.170
Just take three days off the day before the day after and the day of just say a,

836
00:52:56.050 --> 00:53:00.640
what are you doing for Valentine's Day?
Um,
ah,

837
00:53:00.641 --> 00:53:03.760
I'm going to be a Jesus.
Where are you going to be?
I don't even know.

838
00:53:03.761 --> 00:53:07.000
I don't have a good one for that one.
All right.
You know what?

839
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:10.210
I just put myself in your shoes and I understand your problem now.
He said,

840
00:53:10.211 --> 00:53:11.320
I got to do a little bit of trouble.

841
00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:13.990
Last year one of the girls texted me and said,
you know,

842
00:53:13.991 --> 00:53:16.510
every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day.

843
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:18.740
<v 4>Okay.</v>

844
00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.810
<v 0>He said,
I knew my response couldn't be.
Yeah,</v>

845
00:53:20.811 --> 00:53:24.380
but if I get you flowers then they have to get flowers for all of the other

846
00:53:24.381 --> 00:53:28.280
girls.
So I just post out and responded.
Yeah,
well,

847
00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.040
oh dude,
you shouldn't respond to it at all.

848
00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:32.680
<v 4>Okay.</v>

849
00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.620
<v 0>You know,
every girl likes to get flowers on Valentine's Day.
Isn't that funny?</v>

850
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:36.900
<v 4>Okay.</v>

851
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:41.170
<v 0>And that has nothing to do with most likely her having any sort of feelings</v>

852
00:53:41.171 --> 00:53:44.440
towards you.
It's just a bitch next to her in the other cubicle.

853
00:53:44.441 --> 00:53:48.280
Probably got some,
you know,
while the girl on their fucking,

854
00:53:48.281 --> 00:53:49.480
whatever the fuck you want to call it.

855
00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:53.910
Some guy broke my balls this week is fucking hilarious.
He was trashing me,
say,

856
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:56.710
come off as a pompous ass because I always talk about,

857
00:53:57.350 --> 00:53:57.720
<v 4>okay,</v>

858
00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:01.230
<v 0>anybody who doesn't do comedy works in a cubicle,
you know,</v>

859
00:54:01.231 --> 00:54:04.530
and for some reason he decided to take that seriously and tell me that he

860
00:54:04.531 --> 00:54:08.210
actually works at the UN and travels all around the world.

861
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.670
<v 4>Okay.</v>

862
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:17.150
<v 0>If that's actually true,
sir.
How,
why don't you just get on with doing that?</v>

863
00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:20.060
You work at the UN and you travel all over the world.

864
00:54:20.061 --> 00:54:23.710
Why would you give a fuck what some absolute jackass is?

865
00:54:23.711 --> 00:54:27.850
Say It on a fucking podcast.
How insecure are you?
Your insecurities?

866
00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:31.310
Probably a great thing because that's probably the thing that drove you to be at

867
00:54:31.311 --> 00:54:36.260
the UN where you travel all around the world.
You know what,
sir?

868
00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:39.050
Good for you.
That's awesome.

869
00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:44.140
I hope working at the UN and traveling all around the world fills you up some

870
00:54:44.661 --> 00:54:47.360
point where it fills you up high enough.
What?

871
00:54:47.361 --> 00:54:51.230
You don't have to respond to a silly joke on some dumb ass podcast.

872
00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.480
Um,
I travel all around the world.

873
00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:01.700
Um,
you know what?
That's actually a great fucking job.

874
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:05.390
Do you feel like you get anything done?
You know,

875
00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:08.960
do you sit there and wearing that headpiece next to that guy who's wearing the

876
00:55:08.961 --> 00:55:12.890
water buffalo hat?
I'd bet they'd be the above doing that shit.

877
00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.800
And you're sitting there trying to talk to him about how you can sell your Ritz

878
00:55:15.801 --> 00:55:20.210
crackers to their country.
Is that what you're doing when you're traveling?

879
00:55:20.211 --> 00:55:23.900
All around the where I travel all around the world.

880
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.823
<v 5>Okay.</v>

881
00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.560
<v 0>I can just see you on the plane with the fucking dress socks on.</v>

882
00:55:33.561 --> 00:55:37.280
You have a dash cunt.
Oh,
just sitting there.

883
00:55:37.281 --> 00:55:41.150
Or what movies am I going to watch on this flight as I travel all around the

884
00:55:41.151 --> 00:55:44.330
world?
Um,
anyways.

885
00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.500
You know something sir,
you had you,

886
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:51.050
you had the James Bond job and then you fucking,
you played yourself.

887
00:55:51.051 --> 00:55:53.150
I don't know why you did that.
Why would you fucking,

888
00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.090
that's like me responding to people on Twitter.
Why would I do it?

889
00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:59.750
I should pretend like I have better things to do.
Um,
anyways,

890
00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:02.990
I want to keep seeing all these girls back to this guy,
but this,

891
00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:07.160
but at the same time,
I don't want any broken hearts on Valentine's Day.

892
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:11.900
How to do you know what?
I did it.
I don't know.
Just what is your problem here?

893
00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:13.780
<v 4>Okay,</v>

894
00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:17.170
<v 0>dude.
Yeah,
you like a Gemini.
It's like you're this fucking lady killer.</v>

895
00:56:17.171 --> 00:56:19.780
Then also you kind of like,
you know,
you don't want to hurt anybody.

896
00:56:19.781 --> 00:56:21.610
Should I get her some jam jams?

897
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:23.780
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

898
00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:26.420
<v 0>I can't even,
I wouldn't talk to the fucking UN guy.</v>

899
00:56:26.421 --> 00:56:27.770
What the hell was going on here again?

900
00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:33.320
Valentine's Day got a little trouble as well.
Listen,
you're anticipating trouble.

901
00:56:33.321 --> 00:56:35.480
Didn't you learn anything from last year?
You know,

902
00:56:35.481 --> 00:56:38.240
every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day.

903
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:43.430
Um,
what,
what would I write back?

904
00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:47.490
I know what my response would be.

905
00:56:47.491 --> 00:56:50.280
The second I read that if it was just some girl I was banging and then they

906
00:56:50.281 --> 00:56:53.490
wrote that I would get this awful feeling in my stomach

907
00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:59.140
and I would,
I would read it.
And as I got that awful feeling,
I'd go

908
00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:01.690
and make that noise.

909
00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:05.080
You know that thing like when you're just banging a girl and then all of a

910
00:57:05.081 --> 00:57:09.080
sudden she just fucking makes that comment.
You know,

911
00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:12.680
you think she's on the same page as you.
When did,
she just makes that comment?

912
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:15.050
You know,
I was thinking about you today.

913
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:20.150
You just feel that feeling in your stomach.
Oh yeah.
Well don't

914
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:27.910
fucking worst.
Ah,
you gotta be one and done,

915
00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:32.620
but one had done is scary.
You just gotta be honest.
I don't know if some girls,

916
00:57:32.621 --> 00:57:35.860
what would I say?
You know,
every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day.

917
00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:42.370
Um,
what would I text back?
Yeah.
You know,
that's what I heard.

918
00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:45.280
You know what I,
you know what?
I shouldn't give you shit.

919
00:57:45.281 --> 00:57:47.800
I don't have a good response to that.
Well,

920
00:57:47.801 --> 00:57:50.380
maybe some day you'll meet a guy who wants to give you some,

921
00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:53.350
you want to get drunk and fuck,
yeah,

922
00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:56.200
I got nothing and you can't ignore it.

923
00:57:58.720 --> 00:57:59.590
You know what I would've done?

924
00:57:59.591 --> 00:58:01.660
I would've ignored the texts and I would have called her.

925
00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:06.860
But a good three hours later,
three,
four hours,
three hours later,

926
00:58:06.861 --> 00:58:09.680
that's a good one.
You call her,
you ignore that text.
Then he called us,
she goes,

927
00:58:09.681 --> 00:58:14.180
hell,
ah.
And he's like,
Hey,
what's going on?
What are you doing tonight?

928
00:58:14.181 --> 00:58:17.090
I got no plans Valentine's Day.
What are you doing?

929
00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:22.040
And he just started with that.
And then she,
well,

930
00:58:22.041 --> 00:58:24.740
when he went to Dell and she'll be seen if you're going to take it and some

931
00:58:24.741 --> 00:58:27.380
romantic,
you know,

932
00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:32.810
direction and you don't,
you just keep it in the fuck buddy.

933
00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:37.640
So I figure we'd go down to La,
meet hammers,
whatever the fuck he call,

934
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:41.690
we'd go down to,
uh,
take it the face.

935
00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:45.110
I have a couple pitchers of beer and see what happens.

936
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:49.460
Dude.
You know what?
You're,
you're,

937
00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:51.770
it seems to me you're not just fucking these girls.

938
00:58:51.771 --> 00:58:54.500
You're actually having like these many relationships with them.

939
00:58:57.230 --> 00:59:00.020
You know the,
the key to having a fuck buddy is,

940
00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:04.280
is the time between fucking him.

941
00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:09.350
And I don't give a shit how much a woman says that she can handle it.

942
00:59:09.351 --> 00:59:12.050
Most of them can't.
Most of them can't.

943
00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:15.980
If you fucking coming over there and you,
and it just,

944
00:59:15.981 --> 00:59:20.060
eventually they're going to get feelings,
they're more,

945
00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.300
I don't know if they're more,
or if it's a defect.
It's just,

946
00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:27.660
I just respect the fact that that's how they're wired.
So you,

947
00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:32.090
if you have a fuck buddy,
okay,
let's,
let's just do the math.
Okay,
now,
now,

948
00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:35.780
February is a very short month here.
So let's just say right out of the gate,

949
00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:39.890
you fucker on February 2nd
all right?

950
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:44.870
You shouldn't come around again till at least the 17th and progress.

951
00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:50.020
You Fuck and you leave FNL you fuck them and then you leave.

952
00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:52.570
You don't bang her on the second.

953
00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.880
You Bang it on the second and then you bang her on the seventh year in a fucking

954
00:59:55.881 --> 00:59:58.970
relationship in their world.
You know,

955
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:06.130
unless you literally this second you have an orgasm as you're coming,

956
01:00:06.231 --> 01:00:09.530
you're scooping up your clothes and you walk out like half naked,

957
01:00:09.531 --> 01:00:13.280
then you just bizarre.
Which is another good way to keep them at bay.

958
01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.010
And why don't I just read the rest as to see what it,

959
01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:18.680
what is question this here he says,
I want to keep seeing all these girls,

960
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:20.620
but at the same time,
I don't want to break.

961
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:23.180
I don't want any broken hearts on Valentine's Day.
Yeah,

962
01:00:23.181 --> 01:00:26.630
you want to keep fucking all of them now do what you have to have.

963
01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:31.070
You have to have a road revolving door.
You have to have a stable of women.

964
01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:34.310
If you're going to live this life or you have to give into fucking rubbing one

965
01:00:34.311 --> 01:00:36.490
out,
all right?

966
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:39.710
But you can't be a relationship guy with three different women cause you are

967
01:00:39.711 --> 01:00:42.560
going to end up hurting them.
So what you have to constantly be doing,

968
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:45.590
you gotta be like a college coach,
all right?

969
01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:51.140
Every year you lose some top prospects,
but you're out there recruiting.
Okay.

970
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:56.390
See you.
So you maintain,
but it's never ending.
It's fucking exhausting.

971
01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:59.210
But if that's the game you want to play,
that's what you have to do.

972
01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.640
So that girl who says,
you know,

973
01:01:01.641 --> 01:01:06.500
every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day right there,
you put on waivers,

974
01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:11.030
okay,
for for a fucking piece of ass to be named later,

975
01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:16.010
you got got to get rid of her.
Okay.

976
01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.660
And you got to look,

977
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:22.280
go back and analyze what the fuck you did wrong that she felt it was okay for

978
01:01:22.281 --> 01:01:26.000
her to text you cause you fucked up.
That right there shows that you fucked up,

979
01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:30.200
that she felt that she could send that to you if you think you just fuck
buddies.

980
01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:34.220
All right?
So anyways,
he continues.
He says,

981
01:01:34.221 --> 01:01:37.460
I know that like it or not,
this shit is important to women.

982
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:42.230
If I take one girl out,
I'm playing favorites and setting a bad precedent.

983
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.880
Plus if she does that check in Shit on Facebook,
I'm completely fucked.

984
01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.670
Yeah Dude,
you're doing dirt bags.
Shit.

985
01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:54.590
If you're a single guy and something could happen that fucks you on Facebook,

986
01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:58.460
you're leaving these girls on anyways.
He says,

987
01:01:58.461 --> 01:02:01.130
if I take none of them out or do nothing,

988
01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:05.030
I have three irritable ladies on my hand.
Dude,

989
01:02:05.031 --> 01:02:09.080
are you gonna marry any of them now?
Well then let them go.

990
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:12.800
Why don't you have the balls to do that?
You know,

991
01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:16.700
when a team halfway through the season just realized,
did wait,
winning this shit.

992
01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.900
Just pull a fucking Marlin's.
Just get rid of everybody

993
01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.530
and then your fan base is your Dick and they're going be,

994
01:02:25.531 --> 01:02:26.680
he's gonna be pissed for awhile.

995
01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:33.430
Um,
but then you build it back up again.

996
01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.490
Build it back up again.
You know,
I dunno,

997
01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:42.340
look to it.
If you want to be in a fucking relationship,

998
01:02:42.341 --> 01:02:45.190
you know there's other ways about going about it and doing this,

999
01:02:45.191 --> 01:02:48.540
but you're trying to have your cake and eat it too.
Did you get you,

1000
01:02:48.541 --> 01:02:51.370
you got three women right now.
You're bang in three different women.

1001
01:02:51.371 --> 01:02:53.800
Where's your confidence?
You know what you're doing.

1002
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:55.853
<v 1>All right.</v>

1003
01:02:57.450 --> 01:03:00.390
<v 0>Dumped to keep one at bay and then get two more,</v>

1004
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.330
then dumped the other one and get the other one.
She sees him.

1005
01:03:03.331 --> 01:03:06.750
You don't even dump them.
You just phase them out,
phase them out.

1006
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:10.230
But the new recruits that you get in,
you gotta be straight up honest with them,

1007
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:15.300
you know,
unless you actually feel,
feel as you'd be feeling no feelings,
you know,

1008
01:03:15.301 --> 01:03:19.950
don't keep coming back fucking him unless,
you know,
you get that 15 day,

1009
01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.740
you fuck them on the second you fuck them on the 17th,

1010
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:30.030
then you're into march and then banger on like the 11th.

1011
01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.000
<v 1>All right.</v>

1012
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.260
<v 0>And even then,
they can't catch feelings doing that.
But before you know it,</v>

1013
01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.720
you know,
that's like 14,
15 days out of the year taken up.

1014
01:03:41.721 --> 01:03:44.370
Boy,
you,
well,
you got to bank somebody.
This is such,
this is,

1015
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.550
this is really should be eye opening to women that I'm actually saying this is

1016
01:03:47.551 --> 01:03:52.090
really a,
this is really awful.
Not that I'm speaking this out loud.
Um,

1017
01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:53.550
he says,
in a perfect world,

1018
01:03:53.551 --> 01:03:57.600
I'll take all of them out at once and have the force and I've been chasing after

1019
01:03:57.601 --> 01:04:00.180
my entire life,
but we don't always get what we want.

1020
01:04:00.181 --> 01:04:03.960
Any advice from the lovely new would be much appreciated as well.

1021
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:08.220
Love the podcast.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Uh,
yeah,

1022
01:04:08.221 --> 01:04:10.800
she probably wouldn't have been his,
uh,
understanding as I was,

1023
01:04:10.801 --> 01:04:12.000
even though I gave you a lot of shit.

1024
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:14.180
<v 3>Cool.</v>
