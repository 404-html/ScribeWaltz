00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:01.471
Hey,

2
00:00:01.471 --> 00:00:06.450
what's going on is bill burr and just checking in on you for the Thursday

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:08.280
afternoon,
Monday morning podcasts,

4
00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:12.240
and I'm doing on Friday just to fuck with all your drug users out there.

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.120
It's paid a or it's the day after pay day.

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.280
You go out and blow it and get some whores,
a little bit of blow or whatever.

7
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.260
So you probably be breaking my balls saying why am I a day late and a dollar

8
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:23.790
short.
I am not a dollar short.

9
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:28.320
I'm sitting here in the all things comedy studio with the one and only star of

10
00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:33.150
last man on earth.
Mr Will Forte.
Hello Bill.
How are you sir?

11
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.080
I'm doing great.
It's,
it's a beyond a thrill.
So I screwed up.

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.670
I screwed up the schedule and,
and uh,
this should have been Thursday.

13
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.890
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
not at this is all right.

14
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.900
I mean I want it done Thursday if you weren't on it,

15
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:50.790
but people understand that I'm going to wait.
Ah,
yeah.
For someone like,
yeah,

16
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:55.470
absolutely.
Now,
I'll tell you if it was like a reality show star,
I just be like,

17
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:56.400
it's not going to work out.

18
00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:00.390
We're going to have to reschedule for another Thursday.
No,
no,
absolutely man.

19
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:04.650
I was psyched.
I finally ran into you.
Um,
I've been such a fan for so long.

20
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:09.370
I ran into at the night of too many stars.
Yes.

21
00:01:09.371 --> 00:01:12.190
There was too many stars.
They're well and uh,

22
00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:16.330
I got to watch you sing the song a wanted dead or alive with a bond,
Joe.

23
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.700
That was very exciting.
Then freshed it.
Oh my God.
I've just crushed,

24
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.220
screaming wanted though.
Crushed in the bad way.
I could have it,

25
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.180
but that was where we were supposed to do.
We're supposed to ruin his song.

26
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.321
Now wasn't,

27
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.440
the thing was they didn't want you to wear the hat because he didn't want like

28
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:35.690
Richie Sambora to see,
make it seem like you're a making fun of,
yeah.

29
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.970
Yeah.
There was some word on that.
There was,

30
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.040
there was a hat that we ended up not going with.

31
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.290
It just made me look even goofier do I got to tell you what they invest.

32
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.250
One of my favorite things about you is your,
your facial expressions.

33
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.490
I've never seen like the,

34
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.440
the desperation and like the characters you do,
the faces that you make like a,

35
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.420
like when Gruber or are on your new hit show there,
our last,

36
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.570
last man standing like the looks that you come up with.

37
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:06.270
Like it's called the last man on earth.
Not last man.
It's Stan.
Sorry.

38
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:08.500
Last Man on earth.
You know what I'm thinking?
Let down my mom doesn't.

39
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.970
My mom does that.
Did I say that twice every no,
no.
You said it,

40
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:16.260
you said it right once and last month.
Yeah.
I mean as long as you get last man.

41
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.491
Why I don't,

42
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:21.030
this is why I never have guessed what an asshole I'm going to write it down so

43
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.380
don't fuck it up.
Last man,

44
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.870
I just wrote to standing and I had to cross it last month.

45
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.830
Basically the last man standing.
Well for the first couple of episodes,

46
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:30.630
no spoilers.
Oh,

47
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:33.920
there's gonna be a bunch of spoilers cause I love the show and you know,
uh,

48
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:35.970
you know,
whatever,
shut it off.
I don't give a fuck.

49
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.410
It's a great show and I want to talk about it cause I'm a fan.
Um,
first of all,

50
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:44.190
how did you come here though?
The Look of desperation that you mentioned?
Is,

51
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.360
is something that I've,

52
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.080
I've basically workshop my whole life because I've basically been,

53
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:53.850
I kind of a desperate individual and it looks come very naturally to me.

54
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.240
How so?
Desperate,
I dunno.
Just desperate for,
I'm,

55
00:02:57.241 --> 00:03:01.480
I'm a little OCD and a little,
a little,
uh,

56
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.190
everything kind of desperate for,
uh,
uh,
do you fix the for acceptance?

57
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.840
Definitely.
I would say that's probably,
you know,
I,

58
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.620
I used to have a real hard time like leaving a party unless I knew that I had

59
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:20.470
said goodbye to everybody.
It took me forever to,
you know,
it's like,
I dunno,

60
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.440
I didn't want people to be offended that I didn't say goodbye to them or

61
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.930
something like that.
And then you just learn,
oh,

62
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.620
that's right when somebody else leaves without saying bye to me and I'm friends

63
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:34.090
with them.
I don't think that our friendship is over.
Like it's all fine.
I Dunno.

64
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.730
So what'd you find yourself laying in bed at three in the morning?

65
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:41.110
Buzz going off.
Fuck,
I didn't say,
I didn't say hi to Mike.
Yeah.
Yeah.

66
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.960
And then it would make a special call the next day.
Hey,
sorry,

67
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:48.160
I didn't get to say,
but I'm not joking now.
Where did that,

68
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.510
what do you think that came from?
Uh,
I don't know.
Probably,
uh,

69
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.050
uh,
my mom who's a very,

70
00:03:56.051 --> 00:04:00.580
very nice person and my sister.
Yeah.
And you seem really like down to earth.

71
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.980
How'd,
how'd you end up in this fucked up business?
You just seem like you're,

72
00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:07.210
you're just like a meet.
I met you with like within two seconds I'm like,

73
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:11.830
this guy's a sweetheart.
Oh,
blushing.
Well,
I don't know.
You know,

74
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:13.330
I don't know.
I don't,
I,
you know,
it's,

75
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:17.620
it's weird because there are a couple ways into it and a lot of,
you know,
the,

76
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.280
the popular theory is that,
you know,
people,
uh,
um,

77
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.400
work out their aggression and their,

78
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.210
their horrible childhood childhoods up on stage and stuff.

79
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.230
And mine was a different,
different,
I mean,
we all got problems,
but,
but mine,

80
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.380
I had a supportive family.
I had a great upbringing.

81
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:38.330
Was Orville a tough name growing up that it was,
but I would,

82
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.230
I always went by will.
Oh,
you did?
Well that's not true.

83
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:46.130
I went by Billy for like five years and then,
uh,

84
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.450
I got teased because of Billie Jean King.
And so I said,
um,
I changed it.

85
00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:55.210
I came home one day and just change it to will,
how,
why Billie Jean King?

86
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.410
We played,
uh,
no,
but just like,
you know,

87
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:02.690
she was very popular back then.
I'm 44,
so I was right.

88
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.240
It was probably 1975 and she was at the height of her tennis powers.

89
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.420
Wait,
you said he won in 1978 and by [inaudible] 75.

90
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.990
So you're five years old and the kids in your grade or like up on the woman's

91
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:20.350
movement?
It was a big tennis community.
This is northern California.
Oh,
all right.

92
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.750
It was a,
you know,
so did you make you made a conscious choice to switch from,
uh,

93
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.170
Billy to will?
Yes.
Because they were calling you a Billie Jean kink.
Yeah,

94
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.730
it hasn't nothing.
Uh,
yeah,
that was it.
If not,

95
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.390
you know,
I,
it's a fact.
It's not a great story.
It's just a fab shop.
Hey,

96
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.070
I was just,

97
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.260
I find it bizarre that kids at five years of age knew who the hell she was.

98
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.220
Did you hear,
did you hear that shit was rigged?
What was rigged?

99
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.690
I think living Bobby Riggs,

100
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.470
I was a Bobby Riggs Guy's last name was unintentional pun or was it a pun?

101
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.840
I Dunno what it wants and I'm cringing,

102
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:59.580
but like he wasn't like he could have kicked her ass end.
He didn't,

103
00:05:59.581 --> 00:06:03.180
he'd like bed on her.
This is the seventh.
Are you serious?
Well,

104
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.990
I mean this could be like people who hate women so much.

105
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:10.910
We're actually creating this theory on the internet or it actually happen.

106
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.930
I hope it happened not out of some slam and women shit just out of some

107
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:17.270
degenerate gambler kind of thing.

108
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:21.920
Like if he was like in deep and they were going to break his legs or something

109
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:23.510
like that.
And I thought I'd tell you something right now.

110
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:26.330
You whatever the fuck his name is,
Bobby,
he got to lose.

111
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.290
You got to lose the Billy.
Well this is fucking,

112
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.150
you are going to want to kill you or something.
I Dunno.
I,
I,

113
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.280
I think she might have beat him.
Fair and square.
She was pretty damn good.
I mean,

114
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.270
I was named after her for like five years,

115
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:45.130
so I've got to stick up for her action.
She should have destroyed them.

116
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.700
That they actually bugged me.

117
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:48.350
I hate all women thought that that was like a victory.

118
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:49.850
It's like you want your beat an old man.

119
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.250
You had the champion of your sex playing this old man.
I mean,

120
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.560
I mean at some point,
Bill,
I'm staying out of this one.
You and your God,

121
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.190
northern California.
You guys.
Yeah,
just,
you guys are,
I guess really nice people.

122
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:12.020
So anyway,
it isn't,
I will say it a lot of really nice people up there.
It's a,

123
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.520
it's a no math,
no heroin.
There's,
you know,

124
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:20.570
there's probably like,
it's creeping in everywhere.
What did,

125
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:23.590
I didn't see a lot of it.
I didn't see a lot of meth and heroin.
I is it me?

126
00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:25.190
Am I crazy?
Was meth and heroin,

127
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.160
was that just kind of around when it was over and meth wasn't around when we

128
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:31.910
were kids.
Yeah.
I think I'm actually going to be doing a Gig and you Rica,

129
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.130
California and a way north.
And I was excited about that.

130
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:39.330
And then somebody,
you know,
I don't know if they just show,

131
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.430
you never know what the Internet,

132
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:43.550
like they just sit there and they just constantly just go the negative route on

133
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:47.000
everything.
But they were saying that it was a little shady.
I'm I kind of fuck,

134
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.960
how could that place be shady?
It's nestled up there in the redwood forest.

135
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.070
Like I would think people would just be a,
I don't know.
Yeah,

136
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:58.970
leaving pies on the window sill.
Like,
well,
I mean Albuquerque.

137
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:02.090
I bet that was where we made macgruber and,
and you know,

138
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:05.120
that's obviously we're a breaking bad was set.

139
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.480
And so there's presumably a huge,

140
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:12.710
a math situation up there and there are a lot of great things about Albuquerque.

141
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.050
So I think you're going to find some very,
very big positives in your recap.

142
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.430
It must be like a,
I assume a lot of history of the gold rush.

143
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:25.250
Please drive cross country with you and I'll just keep going negative and he'd

144
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:25.491
be like,

145
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:28.640
you know what I think about the home city that's kind of have some surprisingly

146
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.820
mom and pop kind of places.
I knew when I watched your show,

147
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.060
I was saying to my wife,
I go,
this looks like,
uh,
this,

148
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:37.580
this looks like where they shot breaking bad and I'm just going to know it's a

149
00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:40.220
desert.
But for some reason it looked familiar a little bit,

150
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:41.660
some of the landscape and uh,

151
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.750
and she for some reason thought it was like an Arizona or something.

152
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:49.340
So that makes me feel good.
Wait,
no,
no.
Uh,
uh,
last man on earth is Arizona,

153
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.480
but we shoot it in Chatsworth but,
but macgruber was Albuquerque.

154
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.670
I'm a group of us.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
All right.
Jesus.

155
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.350
How bad on my fucking this up or you are doing great.

156
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.300
And I do want to drive cross country with you.
It sounds really cool.

157
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.531
I have to ask you,

158
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:09.531
after years of being in this business and bringing off not even remotely as

159
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:13.440
crazy and ideas what you have with our last man on earth,

160
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.890
like how the hell did you not only get that on the air,

161
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.520
how did you get that a on like fox?

162
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:22.650
I mean I should preface this for people who haven't seen it,

163
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:26.610
it's basically the post apocalyptic and as far as you know,

164
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:31.500
your character is the last person on earth and doing all this crazy shit that

165
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:35.100
you would do when you were by yourself.
How did you uh,
Jeez,
I'll tell you,

166
00:09:35.101 --> 00:09:36.910
come up with it.
It was uh,

167
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.980
Chris Miller and Phil Lord are a huge reason for it because they're,

168
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.210
they're the guys who did the Lego movie in 2122 jump street,

169
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:48.120
cloudy with a chance of meatballs and we've been buddies for years.

170
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.510
So they asked me if I wanted to write something with them.
And the got there.

171
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:56.310
I mean they are having such amazing success right now that,
that,
you know,

172
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.410
people are lining up to work with them.
So,

173
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:02.820
so I just got in at the right time and we all came up with this idea together.

174
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.610
How long did it take to you to get to that?
Cause he was just probably like,

175
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:08.340
all right,
where'd you grow up?
What was your childhood like?

176
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:12.480
And they try to mine that type of thing.
Like how do you go from the usual,
Whoa,

177
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:12.920
like,

178
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.560
cause this is like one of the most original ideas for a show I've seen in a long

179
00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:18.960
time.
Oh God,
thank you.
Uh,
uh,

180
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.370
we'd sat around for about three days and uh,
you know,

181
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:25.290
just three full days.

182
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.820
We brought up the last man on earth kind of early in the process and just went

183
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:34.440
right by it.
Um,
I don't know.
We just didn't seem right to us.

184
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:38.880
And then we had settled on this other,
uh,
show idea.

185
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.830
It was actually,
it was about,
uh,
Val Kilmer used to,

186
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.210
uh,
he stayed with me for awhile because he,
we became buddies through macgruber.

187
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.810
And then he,
he all,
this is in real life.
This is in real life.
I don't,

188
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.020
he ended up staying with you.
He stayed with me,
uh,
because he,

189
00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.270
he has a place in New Mexico,
but,
but he wanted,
uh,

190
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.050
he,
he likes to have a place in Malibu as well.
Well,

191
00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:07.380
he was leaving this one place and wanted to look for another place.

192
00:11:07.381 --> 00:11:12.381
So he just needed a place to stay for what I thought was a couple days and he

193
00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:15.150
just couldn't find the right place.
So it ended up being several months.

194
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.710
So that was what we were going to write the show about it.

195
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:23.400
It's going to be kind of,
uh,
uh,
uh,
fictional.
I kind of partly fact,

196
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.350
did it get weird at some point where you're like,
well,

197
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:29.010
I gotta tell Val Kilmer to a,
hey man,
it's such a weird thing.
Like it's not,

198
00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:31.920
he's a bump.
It's like,
dude,
can you hurry up and find a mansion?
No.

199
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:35.400
It was in the ocean to tell you it was the best couple months of my life.

200
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:40.080
It was so much fun.
Uh,
you know,
he's,
he's like a member of the family,

201
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:44.730
so it's,
it's a,
um,
he's hilarious to like,
remember he's top secret.

202
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:49.650
Remember that way back day.
Oh my God,
his doc holiday.
Oh,
Wyatt Earp.

203
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.730
Tombstone.
Excuse me.
Oh man,
he's still,
he's the best.
He's so far.

204
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:59.020
Have you met him?
No.
Ah,
I never met him,
but I have him on your show.

205
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:00.670
He is so wonderful.

206
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.900
So he stayed with you and so smart and yet he was there for three months.

207
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.830
So we are going to write something about that.
Um,
and,
and I don't know,

208
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:11.350
for some reason we just couldn't figure out what's the,

209
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.060
cause there were a bunch of really fun things that happen in,
uh,

210
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.180
in real life.
But then it was like,

211
00:12:19.181 --> 00:12:23.590
what's that blend of of fact and fiction and you know,
how does it,

212
00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:27.100
so we were a little mixed up with that and right as we were,

213
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.010
so they really figure it out what's happening.

214
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.680
So they will probably going to go with the comedy thing is rather than,

215
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.620
cause there's no,
you can't get five years into this guy crashes with me.

216
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:37.510
We had a great time.
It's his best time of my life.

217
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:39.070
They probably were going to try to go the route that,

218
00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:43.150
that the guy was annoying you when they would,
well we were,

219
00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:46.720
we were just kind of base it on our own characters cause it was kind of like an

220
00:12:46.721 --> 00:12:48.910
odd couple in a way.
But,
but,

221
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.500
but in an odd couple in which both people are kind of the,
uh,

222
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.090
the,
uh,
Oscars,
uh,

223
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:01.830
kind of mixtures of Oscars and Felix's like he's the,

224
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.240
he's the best but,
but it's,
you know,
it just,

225
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:08.890
there's some that actually it's very funny because we,
we thought about,
well,

226
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.250
while he was staying with me,
uh,
I was watching the amazing race that was,

227
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.790
that was,
I was really into that show at the time.
I still like it,

228
00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:17.830
but I just have,
don't watch it that much anymore.

229
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.250
But he thought I was an idiot for watching it.

230
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:26.230
And then I got him hooked on it or,
I don't know,
just the wrong word.
Fascinated.

231
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:30.640
You got stuck into it.
Fascinated.
So we,
for a short period of time,

232
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:35.080
we're planning to try to get on the amazing race together.
Uh,

233
00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:38.680
that would have been,
he come,
we both called their agents and they're like,

234
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:43.250
no way you're doing this.
There is no way you,
I still think it would have been.

235
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.890
Yeah,
I still hold out hope that,
uh,
that will do it someday.

236
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.720
I had an idea a long time ago,

237
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.470
a good friend of mine and one of the best comedians ever sell Patrice O'neil,

238
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.870
right?
Oh yeah.
So we were,
uh,

239
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.290
he was crashing with me during this pilot season and um,

240
00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.760
we were flipping through the channels and judge Judy was on and she was just

241
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:06.970
sitting there screaming and yelling and berating people and everything was just

242
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:10.090
fucking annoying.
Like,
just her whole like,
uh,
I don't know,

243
00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:13.450
it's almost like just grandstanding to get ratings.
And I was,

244
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.290
came up with this idea.
I was trying to convince him to do what I was say,
listen,

245
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:22.240
either you sue me or I sue you.
Okay.
And we'll pay each other.

246
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:24.970
And then when we,
you know,
when the dust settles,

247
00:14:24.971 --> 00:14:27.160
I'll just give you the money back and you give me my money back in cash,

248
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:27.994
nobody knows.
Right.

249
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:32.560
And the whole thing was so we could get on that show and then all we would do

250
00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:34.930
was go on there and try to see how mad we could make her.

251
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.980
And just when she told us to shut up,
you keep interrupting her going lady,
lady,

252
00:14:38.981 --> 00:14:41.830
lady,
just anything just to get into her ego.
And I just felt,

253
00:14:41.831 --> 00:14:45.100
cause like so much of it just seemed like a cartoon to me and she was yelling

254
00:14:45.101 --> 00:14:46.340
just to yell and they'll,

255
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.170
so there was so many like mouth breathing morons that they had on the show that

256
00:14:50.171 --> 00:14:53.150
she was always going see super intelligence.

257
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:56.000
So I felt if we went on then we played the dumb or we played it,

258
00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:00.320
the more her show biz sense would kick in.
Like all this is comedy gold.

259
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.970
And then once we got a mad and then you sorta start insulting her in and just

260
00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:07.310
seeing if we could just make her lose,

261
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:11.370
how would I a great word were were you guys at that time were w could nobody's

262
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.330
perfect.
Nobody knew who maybe a now I don't think so.

263
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:20.330
I was trying to think you couldn't do that anymore.
He did a uh,
yeah.

264
00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:23.560
Cause cause now at the Internet they'd look up,
they find out who you are.
Yeah.

265
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.340
Uh,

266
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.160
but I think they'd find out after they aired it and then they'd never had heard

267
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:31.580
again.
I don't know man.
I wish I would've,
I would've,

268
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.000
I didn't watch the American race,
but if I saw the two of you on there,

269
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:37.730
I would definitely watch it.
They ought to have a celebrity one now.
Fuck.

270
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:40.940
That might just,
just on their one.
So you know that he was on there with his dad.

271
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:44.510
That was one of my favorite,
uh,
thing like seeing him with his dad.

272
00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:48.650
It was that they had such a sweet relationship.
Oh,
they didn't fight or anything.

273
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.770
They didn't really,
they were very supportive of each other.
And,

274
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:56.480
and Mike was paid cause uh,
kinda remembered everything.
But I remember his,

275
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.600
his dad was not as,
uh,
as fast as him,

276
00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:03.890
but Mike was incredibly patient and uh,
they were great.

277
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:05.990
It was just so much fun watching them and I thought,
God,

278
00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:08.870
I want to go on the amazing race with my dad or val Kilmer.

279
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.250
Let me ask you this with you,
a nice laid back vibe.

280
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.150
How did you first react to New York when you went to New York during your,
uh,

281
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.590
did you go to New York first and then get on SNL or did you have like a other

282
00:16:21.591 --> 00:16:26.060
gigs brought you there?
I W I,
I went there for SNL,

283
00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:29.720
but it wasn't my first time I was there.
I wrote for Letterman for about God,

284
00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:34.090
nine months in 97,
98.
It was my,

285
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.390
my first job ever was the Jenny Mccarthy sketch show on MTV.

286
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.620
And then I got a chance to write it Letterman right after that,
that job.

287
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:48.440
It was,
it was terrifying.
Like he was,
you know,
in Layman's my,
you know him.

288
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.370
Oh yeah,
that's Martin.
That guy still has like an SNL Gary vibe.

289
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.630
Those Peter Sellers,
those are my four,
uh,
you know,

290
00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:01.620
God and money python,
but they're like,
Letterman is,
is one of my,
my,
uh,

291
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.870
the,
you know,
one of the things that really shaped,
uh,

292
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.940
my comedy,
you know,
and,
and,

293
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.440
and so to work at that show is really crazy,
terrifying.

294
00:17:12.441 --> 00:17:15.980
And I sucked at it.
That was not good.
We know what we do,
a monologue,

295
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:19.940
so you would write and sketch pieces.
I was doing sketch pieces and,
and,
uh,

296
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.290
you know,
writing top tens and stuff like that.
And it was,

297
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.100
it was such an honor to be there,
but like,

298
00:17:25.101 --> 00:17:28.520
I wished that I had a little more experienced before I went there.

299
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:33.140
And it was so tough because then these guys,
I was probably 27 at the time.

300
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.610
And then the guys who came in right after me,
uh,

301
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.250
we're coming straight from college.
I think there were 22,

302
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.870
and they were doing amazingly well there.
And,

303
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.710
and it was super easy for them,

304
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:49.380
their first job at a school and there were the guys who went on to create,
uh,

305
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.230
how I met your mother,
Carter Basic Craig.

306
00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.310
We'll just born with that gift to be have.
I,
I can't,
I suck at that.

307
00:17:56.311 --> 00:18:00.630
I tried writing for the SBS a couple of years in a row and um,

308
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:05.310
I was just,
I,
I just never wrote like that.
Did you have to do the pattern stuff?

309
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.490
I think when they go up to the,
uh,
you know,
to announce awards.
No,
you got it.

310
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.420
Oh,
that's the worst.
Louie CK talked about that on,
on,
on Opie.

311
00:18:15.421 --> 00:18:19.200
And Anthony was saying that like what the pattern that they come up with.

312
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.410
Believe it or not,
that's the best you can do.
You want to do something cute,

313
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.700
you do it,
you get in,
you get out.
And that's it.
I never had to do that.

314
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.920
I had to do like monologue jokes,

315
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.810
but like I just never had written from that.
Like,
like,

316
00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:37.410
okay,
bill,
we need some volleyball jokes and you just sit in there going,

317
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:40.950
all right,
volleyball.
And he's just staring at that blank page.

318
00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:42.980
I just felt like I was back in high school.
Again,
it's this,

319
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.380
I've just always written from like,
you know,
that bugs me,

320
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:47.370
I'm going to talk about that,

321
00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:50.280
but now all of a sudden you're like writing for somebody else.
So like,
you know,

322
00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:54.510
it's a good job,
but isn't that really in his style?
It's too mean spirited.

323
00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:57.600
I got a lot of that and like it was still a great experience,
but just trying to,

324
00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.590
um,
to do like I had already respected writers,

325
00:19:01.591 --> 00:19:05.760
but to actually had have had a couple of those jobs,
it was a,
Oh,

326
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.390
I quickly realized it was like this,
this is not for me.
Yeah.

327
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:12.330
This is not something that when you get an idea,
do you write it down on like,

328
00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:15.300
I used to have these notepads and wood.
Is that,

329
00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.220
how do you remember your ideas?
That's how ideas,
that's how I used to do it.

330
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.630
I used to,
back in the day,

331
00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:25.130
I was working in a dental office with my dad and these little Manila envelopes

332
00:19:25.131 --> 00:19:28.140
said it.
You'd put the,
uh,
the x rays and after I take an x Ray,

333
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:32.310
pour up a model of some shit.
Right.
And,
uh,
I used to just write them down.

334
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:36.960
I used to write on,
but I would be writing up the whole idea.
Yeah.
You know,

335
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.780
and hoping that,
you know,
didn't want to lose any of it.

336
00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:44.100
And then I try to transfer to notebook and then just became those little Manila

337
00:19:44.101 --> 00:19:48.840
things.
Then it just keeps,
just became like one word.
And now it's just like a,

338
00:19:48.841 --> 00:19:53.220
occasionally I'll type it into my phone.
Yeah.
Um,
but I,

339
00:19:53.221 --> 00:19:56.580
I kinda just,
I dunno,
I just see something and go,
I'm talking about that.

340
00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.540
And then if I remember,
I go on stage and I talk about it and if I forget,

341
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.650
I'm like,
uh,
I just,
I let it go.
I don't want to look at my,
I know,

342
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:08.130
I think I have like a little section in my phone.
Oh,
I got,

343
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:12.590
I got all kinds of shit in here.
Let me see what you got.
Okay.
No,

344
00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.950
just write.
You just write one word.
No,
I wrote bad jokes.
These are,
I wonder,

345
00:20:16.951 --> 00:20:21.260
remember bad jokes.
Uh Oh,
these are,
so

346
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.940
here,
I'll throw a couple of these out.
Um,

347
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:32.250
I have a series of me and my buddy have a these dumb,
uh,

348
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.850
uh,
who's on first type jokes,
but they involve,
um,

349
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:42.570
like for instance of Anagen.
If I see a van again,
I say,
oh my God,
look,

350
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:47.070
um,
I used to have a van again.
Wait,
is that,

351
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.170
did you ever quit?
I used to have a van again,

352
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.770
this is already off all this is why it's in the bad joke section.

353
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.900
I used to van again.
Oh,
that's crazy.

354
00:20:55.901 --> 00:20:59.530
I don't remember you having a van a in the first place.
No,
I never had a band.

355
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:04.030
But you said you had a van again?
No,
I,
yes,

356
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:09.550
but you never had a van in the first place.
You never know.
It's,

357
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:10.541
it's really bad.

358
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:15.541
So then I wrote down different a Cardigan we could do with Greg Evigan Toboggan.

359
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.220
Okay.
That's horrible.
Then I have,
no matter what speed you're going,

360
00:21:21.221 --> 00:21:25.960
you're always going this fast when you're going through an airport terminal

361
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:29.590
velocity,
that's not even a joke.
That's just,
yeah,

362
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.970
I said bird seed.
It's so overrated.
Know what I think about bird seed.

363
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.650
It's for the birds.
You know what's this is mining and I do stand up.
I could,

364
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:43.130
right?
Oh yeah.
I have down here it says,
be in the back laughing at this.

365
00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.190
This is the worst.
It says ricotta.
Be Kidding me.
Like ricotta,

366
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.980
cottage cheese.
Uh,
yeah.
I like,
Oh,

367
00:21:52.981 --> 00:21:56.770
here's this one's great.
Oh,
here are two that are great.
I like Dublin,

368
00:21:56.771 --> 00:22:01.630
but there's one place I like slightly more tripling.
Boom.

369
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.700
Bam.
Uh,
uh,
yeah.
I go to this great dive bar.

370
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.470
Greg Louganis is there all the time.
Okay.
I actually liked that one.

371
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.650
I asked.
Those are the kinds of jokes I send to my wife just doing Neuer.

372
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.960
I sent him one the other day.
I said,

373
00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:19.090
what did the fashion needs to say to his son?

374
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:25.110
I'm proud of you like Prada shoes just to watch her fucking grown and send these

375
00:22:25.781 --> 00:22:28.810
things back to a horrific,
but I just don't think any of these are good.

376
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.060
That's they're,
you know,
they're supposed to be bad,

377
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.020
but I don't have a thing in here that says good jokes.
These are just,

378
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.920
I only like remembering the bad ones.
I got in my phone right here.
I have,

379
00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.800
I don't Kanye West.
And then it says dictator.

380
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.910
Even I as a white dude have unfulfilled dreams as a dictator.

381
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:50.440
I didn't know what that means.
And then the cruise ships,
cruise ships.

382
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.510
Now there's this thing that I'm doing that if I took over the world,
um,

383
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.230
my ethnic cleansing would be sinking cruise ships.

384
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.890
So it wouldn't be race or religious spoken.

385
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.600
It would be all be based on people killing.

386
00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:07.510
They're killing people who are dumb enough to think going on a cruise is a good

387
00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:12.250
idea.
But that's something that I'm working on.
There is like,

388
00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:16.330
there's,
you know,
the Norwalk virus that kind of takes here at some of that.

389
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.070
It's going to happen.
I'm going to ask you,

390
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:22.240
doing the last man on earth with creating that thing where you guys,
any,

391
00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.240
there's gotta be some,

392
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.990
somebody in there has got to be a little bit of a conspiracy theorist or

393
00:23:25.991 --> 00:23:29.960
somebody's paying attention to the fearful talks about global warming.

394
00:23:29.961 --> 00:23:31.960
Like you see the shit on the Internet saying California.

395
00:23:31.961 --> 00:23:34.360
He's going to be out of the water in a year and you're just like,

396
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:39.130
why am I still paying my mortgage?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I get terrified by that stuff,

397
00:23:39.131 --> 00:23:41.980
that the new one.
I've always been scared of earthquakes,

398
00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:46.670
but the one that I keep hearing about is like super volcano stuff.

399
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.200
Um,
have you heard of that one?
What's that one?

400
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:54.820
Apparently there are a couple gigantic volcanoes that blow every couple hundred

401
00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.800
years and there's one somewhere close to us that's the way overdue.

402
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.080
And so we're worried about these earthquakes,

403
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:05.750
but there's going to be a super volcano that's going to love.

404
00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:09.170
I just can't wrap my head around that.
That could ever happen to me.

405
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.160
I just feel like you're going to be in France at the time.

406
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:16.280
I know you're going to be in France,
you're going to be safe.
Why?

407
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.610
Because I had just know you're going to survive this.

408
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.420
How do you know I'm gonna be in France because I just have this feeling you

409
00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:25.940
don't have the shining,
you know?
I'll tell you how fucked up that is.

410
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.780
I was actually talking to my wife about an exit strategy out of this business

411
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.300
because nobody seems to ever work on it.
Yeah.

412
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.780
Like how you going to get out of it gracefully?
Yeah.

413
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.750
How are you going to walk away?

414
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.030
Like the way Seinfeld did law and I said he's out of the business,

415
00:24:38.031 --> 00:24:41.600
but the way he had that great show fucking killed and guy,
what are you do now?

416
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.830
He did.
I said,
yeah,
I don't know,
maybe do some stand up.

417
00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.440
And he just chilled until he came up with the next idea.
The uh,

418
00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:52.880
the comedians in cars,
things like,
or like Johnny Carson or flip Wilson.

419
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:57.180
You get your money.
Like that's the hardcore one.
Uh,
Marvin Hagler.
Yeah.
You know,

420
00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:01.160
really I didn't beat sugar ray Leonard.
Go fuck yourselves.
And he moved to Italy.

421
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:06.020
It starts making like macgruber type movies over there.
So I was thinking,

422
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:12.430
I'm 23 years and I'm 46 going to be 47 and another 23 years I'll be 69,

423
00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:13.400
70.

424
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:18.400
I'm thinking that's a good possibly time to just walk and 70 and 70.

425
00:25:19.311 --> 00:25:23.360
I either walk and I either,
it's either I'm going to buy a place in Paris,

426
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:26.990
sell all my shit live there,
and finally become bilingual.

427
00:25:26.991 --> 00:25:31.550
Right before I Croak or Alabama.
I said,
I'm not joking either.
Why Alabama?

428
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.810
I like it there.
I just,
I like it.
I actually love the south.
I like why home?

429
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:40.850
All those fucking states.
Everybody Shits on.
I love him.
No.
Oh my God.
You know,

430
00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:44.060
I've just never on spelled.
I never have all of those places.
That's not true.

431
00:25:44.061 --> 00:25:48.500
I drove through uh,
Alabama,
but it was late at night.
Um,

432
00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:52.370
I was driving from New Orleans to end to Texas and uh,

433
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:57.590
so I don't know Alabama too well,
but God,
I love Florida.
I love New Orleans.

434
00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.610
No,
I was going from New Orleans.
Excuse me.
For Florida.
You to Orleans.
Yeah.

435
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.510
So I didn't,
I didn't want to be at,
yeah,
the road kind of know I made that.

436
00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.360
I figured out that actually you would not go through Alabama.

437
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:14.510
Uh,
where,
where in Alabama do you think you would wind up?

438
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.790
Like Tuscaloosa?
Uh,
college?
Yeah,
I would definitely to Alabama is right.

439
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:20.853
Yeah.
That's okay.

440
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.470
I would make a decision if I was going to be an Auburn or Alabama fan.

441
00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:27.960
And at this point,
just because I've been into Lsu,
like I just got into them,

442
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.840
you know,
watching their crazy coach there.

443
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:34.520
It's just so much fun rooting against Alabama.
Um,
and also like,
I mean,

444
00:26:34.521 --> 00:26:37.380
people know I'm fucking around,
but like I,
I have like this,

445
00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:42.410
this just based on nothing like sort of faulty hatred for Alabama.

446
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:47.370
I don't like the crimson tide.
So,
uh,
whenever they have a big game,

447
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.020
I always write Alabama.

448
00:26:49.021 --> 00:26:51.960
The dream ends tonight cause like their dreams always won the championship.

449
00:26:51.961 --> 00:26:55.040
It's just stupid.
And then I need really annoys people.
So,
yeah,

450
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.380
I think I would go,
uh,
maybe I'd be an Auburn Fan,

451
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:03.150
but I would have to live up in crimson tide country cause it'd be no fun to be

452
00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:06.870
an Auburn fan around a bunch of Auburn fans.
This is the standup comic at me.

453
00:27:06.871 --> 00:27:11.840
Like,
wait,
where's the fun in that?
Let's go annoy people.
And um,
you know,

454
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.100
when it's natural and it be,
you know,

455
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.770
I'm not trying to offend crimson tide fans either,
but like,

456
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:19.620
they are just such a powerhouse.
You always got to,

457
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.220
unless you are born into that,
you have to,

458
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:27.390
it's kind of like rooting against the Yankees or the Patriots.
Yes.
You know,

459
00:27:27.391 --> 00:27:31.890
I'm a,
I'm an A's fan,
so the,
you know,
the Yankees are a natural enemy and I'm a,

460
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.950
I'm a Bruins fan.
I went to Ucla and,
and so I get,
you know,
I gotta be against,
uh,

461
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:42.030
Alabama.
They're just,
you know,
they're,
they're so good.
They're too good.
Yeah.
No,

462
00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:44.800
that's,
I mean that,
it's actually,
I guess you shouldn't get mad.
It's,
it's a,

463
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.810
it's my brilliance are coming.
They're coming.
Oh yeah.
In Wa football.
Yeah.

464
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:53.460
Oh yeah.
How'd you guys do last year?
I was on the road for the Aha.
See?
Uh,

465
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.510
we did all right.
We did pretty well.
We were like 10 and three.

466
00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.970
I think that's great.
Yeah.
Right.

467
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.880
You guys won't like a flatline in that for a good 10 years.
I mean,
we have,

468
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.720
we had,
uh,
uh,
a couple,
uh,

469
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.930
we had some tight games than the beginning and then we really started getting it

470
00:28:09.931 --> 00:28:13.350
together.
And then we had a couple,
a tricky ones against the,
you know,

471
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.260
Oregon so good.
And that was,
that was a tough one.

472
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:20.260
Those guys with that stupid uniforms,
they're ruined in football.
I got not,
not,

473
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:21.450
not cause the uniforms are bad.

474
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.960
It's because everybody's now trying to come up with a cool uniform and that just

475
00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:27.960
not able to pull it off.
It's like they have Fonzie.

476
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:32.010
Everybody else needs to just fucking be plot seed.
How do you feel about,

477
00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:36.500
is it eastern Washington that has,
or like Boise state,
the color,

478
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.390
the blue turf created.
They have the blue and uh,

479
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:43.380
eastern Washington has that crazy red,
uh,

480
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.970
I think it's desperate moves by schools that want to get noticed,
but at work,

481
00:28:47.971 --> 00:28:52.920
cause now Boise is actually becoming somewhat of a,
a powerhouse.
I mean,

482
00:28:52.921 --> 00:28:54.240
I don't know,
they kind of have the up and down,

483
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:57.000
but I also think that once they limited the amount of scholarships,

484
00:28:57.001 --> 00:29:00.390
all of a sudden,
you know,
Appalachian State Beats Michigan,

485
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.360
that would never happen back in the day.
So,
um,
I dunno,
but I,

486
00:29:05.361 --> 00:29:08.760
I,
you know what I realized with my add,
I never got around to it.
So,
uh,

487
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:13.600
coming up with the,
the,
the last man on earth.
Uh,
so,
so yeah,

488
00:29:13.601 --> 00:29:18.540
so we were a,
with the val Kilmer.
Thanks.
Sorry.
No,
my God.
No,
that's,
that's a,

489
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.770
that's a good memory right there.
Um,
no,
I,
you know what it is?
It's,
it's,

490
00:29:22.771 --> 00:29:26.340
I read all the tweets when people shit on me,
so I have their criticisms.

491
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.040
Like in my head,
they're not necessarily bad.
They're like,
dude,

492
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:33.600
he was fucking about ready to say the thing and then you're interrupted.
So,
no,

493
00:29:33.601 --> 00:29:36.570
this is the most boring part of it.
We did.
So we were,

494
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.410
we just had it all these lingering questions and we were about to go and,

495
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:45.430
and then I would be left to kind of figure out a route to this,

496
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.380
um,
val and we'll show.
And then we just on the way out,

497
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.630
Chris Miller's getting his jacket on and then I just said,

498
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:58.600
let's look at this last man on earth thing one more time.
And we just,

499
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:03.810
something a tiny adjustment was made and it just all started pouring out.

500
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.190
So it was,
uh,
you know,
we,
we got really excited about it.

501
00:30:09.191 --> 00:30:12.810
We never thought that it would be a show for Fox.
It,
it definitely is weird.

502
00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:17.450
As we were thinking it up,
it seemed like it was way more of a,
a cable type tone,

503
00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:22.180
AMC,
FX,
FX or whatever they got now.
So we pitched it to,
uh,

504
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:26.020
you know,
a bunch of,
a bunch of people,
uh,
half of them cable,

505
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.760
half of them network.
And we were really,
we're just doing,
uh,

506
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:31.810
what was the name on pitches as a,

507
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:36.700
as a courtesy because we thought never would any of them,
uh,
be interested.

508
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.520
Uh,
the response was very good.
It was,
uh,
you know,

509
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:43.240
we had a lot of opportunities and,
but you know,

510
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:48.040
you go in there and you're partnered up with,
uh,
the studio,
which was a 20th,

511
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:53.230
and,
and they kind of help you decide where to do it.
And they,
they,
uh,

512
00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:57.550
Fox was,
was very interested in and you know,
they,
uh,

513
00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:02.230
they have a lot of history 20th and,
and Fox obviously.
So,
uh,
so,
you know,

514
00:31:02.231 --> 00:31:05.890
it was decided that that was where we tried to do it.
And I gotta be honest,

515
00:31:05.891 --> 00:31:10.210
I was a little nervous at first because I like to swear and had like,
well,

516
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.870
dirty situations that's going to say it.
Like when you guys were pitching that,

517
00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:18.790
did you guys pitch the Margarita Pool and the toilet pool and didn't we,

518
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.130
uh,
did you come up with that afterwards?

519
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:26.000
That was part of writing the pilot.
That was part of writing the pilot,
uh,

520
00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:30.970
that it was basically just the storyline of this guy's all alone,

521
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:37.120
doesn't know what to do.
And eventually all he's hoping for is,
is,
uh,

522
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.760
you know,
to see any other human.

523
00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:45.090
And then finally another human comes into the picture and they just don't,

524
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:46.480
don't get along at all.

525
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.000
And you finally meet a woman you'd think and then it just becomes this,
you know,

526
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.740
played by the Great Kristen Schaal.
She's still unbelievable on that.

527
00:31:53.741 --> 00:31:58.380
And I'm psyched to meeting to see another comic,
you know,
not only get,
you know,

528
00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:01.780
she's killing it on the act of thing because there is sort of a stereotype,

529
00:32:01.781 --> 00:32:03.670
you know,
sometimes about comedians act or whatever.

530
00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:07.390
So she's doing us all a huge favor.
She's great.
And she in the ones that,

531
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:12.490
that haven't been aired yet,
she's even,
she likes,
she's asked to do a lot of,

532
00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.060
cause she,
you know,
she played,
she's so funny and,
and,

533
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:22.310
and you know,
has always very easily access that.
But,
but this is like,

534
00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:27.330
she is asked to do some very tough things where she's like still supposed to be

535
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.380
this fun,

536
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:34.410
crazy character we've created but also do like some kind of emotional things and

537
00:32:35.261 --> 00:32:37.000
yeah,
just perfect at it.

538
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.560
She thought she's a great actress so I time for people to see that your,

539
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.510
your relationship,

540
00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:44.810
your guys' relationship is driving me nuts on the show and I'm like yelling at

541
00:32:44.811 --> 00:32:46.530
the TV going,
just dumper,
just do,

542
00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:50.600
you can't let her move in and I'm just watching you getting sucked into this

543
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:55.310
relationship and like I would just feel like it's been enough to be alone.

544
00:32:55.311 --> 00:32:57.830
This got to be somebody else out there and like fuck gives a shit.

545
00:32:57.831 --> 00:33:00.890
If she moves in with you,
just go steal another house down the street,

546
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:05.470
just grab me shit and go down there and um,
I do,

547
00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:06.960
I can't tell you enough about that,

548
00:33:06.961 --> 00:33:10.430
that I just love like all this shit you would do when you're by yourself,

549
00:33:10.431 --> 00:33:13.850
like driving your truck into stuff and bowling balls into fish tanks.

550
00:33:13.851 --> 00:33:17.990
It's just like,
I mean,
I would do that,
but I also like,
yeah,
that's the,

551
00:33:17.991 --> 00:33:20.170
I would do that too.
That's what the,
you know,
we,

552
00:33:20.171 --> 00:33:23.950
we would just think up things that we would actually do ourselves.
Yeah.

553
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.220
Find a firework store and just,
just come up with you.

554
00:33:27.221 --> 00:33:30.600
You turn it to like an eight year old.
Yeah.
But when I,
I liked,
oh,
with,

555
00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.340
what's her cat?
The Carol character,
Kristen shells character.
How she is,

556
00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:36.410
she still had morals,

557
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.890
so it was annoying and nagging is she is like this something that you still have

558
00:33:39.891 --> 00:33:44.110
at the core?
Her,
she's like a really good person.
Oh yeah.
She's great.
She's,
she's,

559
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.720
you know,

560
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.590
that's the thing is that because I'm the last man on earth and we have to start

561
00:33:48.591 --> 00:33:52.640
on me,
we have to kind of create this,
this sympathetic character.

562
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:56.810
But as the show goes on,
you realize like she's the,

563
00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:01.670
she's the real good person here and,
and like,
and so your,
your,

564
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:06.510
your allegiances are constantly shifting.
Um,

565
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:07.970
so we're trying to,
you know,

566
00:34:07.971 --> 00:34:11.810
we're trying to walk that tight rope and I dunno if I've gotten too far away

567
00:34:11.811 --> 00:34:16.120
from it cause,
cause we don't want people to hate me forever.
But,
but I now do it.

568
00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.680
Know your characters hilarity.
You can know,
you know,
you saw,

569
00:34:18.681 --> 00:34:21.740
you had your morals is going,
you didn't leave Todd in the desert,

570
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.970
which was my life,
the way you guys shot that where you were like,
you know,

571
00:34:25.971 --> 00:34:28.870
I'm not going to try to get away,
do whatever.
You know,
we've already shown you.

572
00:34:28.871 --> 00:34:32.510
If people haven't seen it,
they they've uh,
shame on you.
You should have seen it.

573
00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.830
You got to stay up to date or you're going to get spoilers released.
Exactly.

574
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:37.431
Exactly.

575
00:34:37.431 --> 00:34:40.580
But how you just drop them off and I just loved the look on his face for he,
he,

576
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.630
he's such a good guy.

577
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:44.600
It doesn't register that you would leave him out there and he's in his size,

578
00:34:44.601 --> 00:34:47.120
his white and middle of nowhere,
like three hour drive.

579
00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:50.960
He's going to die and you're just driving away and then you have to scream and

580
00:34:50.961 --> 00:34:54.590
like,
I can't do this.
This is morally wrong.
You keep backing up and then go,
no,

581
00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:57.740
fuck it.
[inaudible] I'm totally butchering this.

582
00:34:57.741 --> 00:35:02.660
The way you guys shot that thing.
Oh my God.
That was a Peter Atencio,
the guy who,

583
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:06.210
who directs all the key and Peele stuff.
He did that after a while.

584
00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:11.350
I know him.
Um,
you would like him.
You would like,

585
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:14.240
I don't know if I haven't met him.
I'm the worst dude.
Like I,
I,

586
00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.530
I act when they let me,

587
00:35:15.531 --> 00:35:17.870
so I let a couple of times a year they'll get a gig and I'm meeting all these

588
00:35:17.871 --> 00:35:21.760
cool people and then I'm just back out on the road doing my,
uh,
doing my,
my,

589
00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:26.210
my stupid little at how,
how many days would you say you're on the road?

590
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.160
Uh,
not enough.
No.
No.
I love it.
I absolutely fucking love it.

591
00:35:31.161 --> 00:35:34.850
I love being a comic.
So,
uh,
I don't know.

592
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:39.330
At least at least half the year.
Maybe not.
Maybe not as not,

593
00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.520
but it's not bad.
I mean every other week I work.

594
00:35:41.521 --> 00:35:44.250
I mean that's a joke compared to back in the day when I had a job and had to be

595
00:35:44.251 --> 00:35:48.270
there every fucking Monday through Friday.
Yeah.
And it's just like,
um,
I mean,

596
00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:50.740
no wonder people like,
like there's no reason.
The only reason we,

597
00:35:50.741 --> 00:35:53.970
for me to become an alcoholic,
it's just the downtime just out of boredom,

598
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.210
which is a pathetic reasons.
They keep you busy.

599
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:59.520
That's a pathetic reason to be an alcoholic.

600
00:35:59.521 --> 00:36:03.580
But like anybody who's in the working world,
I totally get it.
Yeah.

601
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:08.310
It's just like,
it's just the buildup,
the bullshit Monday and that was,

602
00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:11.850
it was the same deal.
It was like,
it would either be when I'm really,

603
00:36:11.851 --> 00:36:15.300
really stressed out smoke or when I'm just really bored,

604
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:20.280
so I just had to be kind of busy.
But unstressed to not smoke.
No,

605
00:36:20.281 --> 00:36:22.830
I just remember it by like Tuesday.

606
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.330
I always said Tuesday dragged worse than Monday.
Monday it was just,

607
00:36:26.331 --> 00:36:29.340
he was so bleary eyed from the weekend before you knew what the Roach coach

608
00:36:29.341 --> 00:36:32.610
showed up or was lunchtime.
But like Tuesday was just like,

609
00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:34.080
that's when reality set in.

610
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:37.800
You didn't drink the night before you fucking sober and you just sit in there

611
00:36:37.801 --> 00:36:40.920
going,
oh this is,
this is,
this is where I'm working.
Retired from Monday,

612
00:36:40.921 --> 00:36:44.330
but you still have enough of the rest of the week that it sucks.
You're not like,

613
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.500
once you get to Wednesday,
it's like,
okay,

614
00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:49.620
only two more days it's closing and we just stay with the worst for me.

615
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.110
And then Thursday you got your check and you got hope.

616
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.000
Who was the first time you had hope?

617
00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:58.950
And then Friday felt like the last day of school and um,
yeah.

618
00:36:58.951 --> 00:37:02.580
Then I just remember like literally running out of,
I worked in this warehouse,

619
00:37:02.581 --> 00:37:05.760
which was a great job unloading trucks and ship and I just remember running out

620
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:10.130
of there and,
and just,
I don't know,
the weekend would go by in two seconds.

621
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:13.790
By Monday I was fucking broke.
I'd like no overnight,

622
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.370
no overhead or anything and I would come in,
I would just be absolutely broke.

623
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.480
And so Monday though,
I would make the people laugh,

624
00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:22.950
telling my stories from the weekend.

625
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:25.740
That's how I'd get to lunch and then I just limped through,
but then,

626
00:37:25.741 --> 00:37:29.700
but then Tuesday,
Wednesday,
which would just fucking kill me.
So whatever.

627
00:37:29.701 --> 00:37:30.810
I'm getting,
getting back to the point,

628
00:37:30.811 --> 00:37:32.970
if you have a drinking problem and you actually have a job,

629
00:37:32.971 --> 00:37:34.140
I completely understand it.

630
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:40.800
Advocating alcoholism.
So I don't have a drinking problem.
I drink,

631
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:44.750
I fall down a don't know.
I drink,
I get drunk.
I fall down.
Uh,

632
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.200
not a problem.
No problem.
There you go.
I ain't got to write that in my,
uh,
phone.

633
00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:52.430
They could just put that on a tee shirt.
Hey.
Uh,

634
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.430
if you are into Boosie,
you know,
there's a really good whiskey.

635
00:37:56.431 --> 00:38:00.900
Somebody turned me on to a cold alibi.
If you try it.
I've never tried it.

636
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:05.880
Oh my God.
I love,
I'm a whiskey whiskey and bourbon,
but not scotch.

637
00:38:05.881 --> 00:38:08.730
It's not scotch whiskey.
Right.
I don't even know.

638
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.260
All I know is a couple ice cubes.
It's sounds like,

639
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.570
it sounds like it wouldn't be Scotch Alibi.
Sounds like it.
Yeah,

640
00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.040
it's a whiskey and stuff.
I like.
It's the perfect.
Yeah.

641
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.890
If you just want to have a couple before you go to bed,

642
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:22.320
it's like 30 bucks for a bottle.

643
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.550
Just tear through the thing you're not worried about.
You know,

644
00:38:25.551 --> 00:38:28.430
like when you buy actually buy something Nice,
you got to have like the whole,

645
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:32.420
the,
it's gotta be,
is this the right moment to open that bottle and you know,

646
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:37.030
don't put any,
don't put any fucking ice cubes in there.
This is just,
I dunno,

647
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:39.670
everybody's drinking makers,
everyone drinks jack or whatever.

648
00:38:39.671 --> 00:38:43.330
It was just something different.
Somebody got me and uh,
I got a tour coming up,

649
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:46.870
going through the south with some buddies of mine and we're going to be on a bus

650
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:50.050
and I'm going to think of a stocking up and,
oh,
here we go.

651
00:38:50.051 --> 00:38:50.980
I'm a whore myself out.

652
00:38:50.981 --> 00:38:53.590
If the makers of alibi would like to send us some whiskey,

653
00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:58.740
we'll talk about it on all our podcasts.
There we go.
That's,

654
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.830
that'll be like the end of me.
So I'm all right,
I'm jumping all over the place.

655
00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.660
I got to go macgruber here.
Okay.

656
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:09.280
One of the funniest fucking movies of the last four or five years.

657
00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:12.730
Absolutely loved it.
Paul Versey,
the buddy of mine who a headliner,

658
00:39:12.731 --> 00:39:15.280
but every once in a while come around and open for me.
He,
uh,

659
00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:17.710
he's the one who told me,
he said,
dude,
he goes,
you got to see this movie.

660
00:39:17.711 --> 00:39:19.120
You went to go see what these two brothers.

661
00:39:19.121 --> 00:39:22.480
And he said he was like punching one of them.
Fucking gravity.

662
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:27.130
The other one just watching it.
And um,
that's so cool.
Oh my God,
Dude.
Uh,

663
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:31.450
I was watching clips of it this morning.
I finally,
uh,
you know,

664
00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:34.720
I was so busy I had to watch and refresh my memory and all that stuff.

665
00:39:34.721 --> 00:39:38.250
Cause I forget movies a second.
I saw him,
I just like,
oh,

666
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:39.760
I'm going to ruin this movie too.

667
00:39:39.761 --> 00:39:41.860
But just how you put together the whole t 40 is,

668
00:39:41.861 --> 00:39:45.860
I grew up on those movies and they weren't trying to be funny.
No,

669
00:39:45.861 --> 00:39:48.680
we was serious.
Roughly the same age.
And I,

670
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.760
the movies that we were were like,

671
00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.990
this was our love letter to those movies that are the same movies that I
watched.

672
00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:00.790
Uncommon Valor.
Right.
Uh,
you know,
diehard obviously and,
you know,
lead the weapon.

673
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:01.624
All those,

674
00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.920
the 80s was just the golden age of those and they just kept coming out with a

675
00:40:05.921 --> 00:40:06.880
guy.
There was,

676
00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:11.820
there was the loan and then Schwartzenegger and then I won.
Then I,

677
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:16.510
and what's his face was in there?
Uh,
oh,
Mel Gibson.
L now Mel Gibson was in there.

678
00:40:16.511 --> 00:40:20.440
What's this gay,
uh,
the guy with the red deer.
Chuck Norris.
Oh,
Chuck Norris.

679
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:25.330
The guy with the red beard kicked me across the room.
Uh,
Delta force,
right.

680
00:40:25.331 --> 00:40:27.600
Delta force.
Yeah.
Missing.

681
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:32.260
They missing in action trilogy with Tex Cobb.
I watched all of those.

682
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.560
Then there was a Sean Claude van Damme and before him,

683
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:40.160
was he before a Steven Seagal,
Steven Seagal.
I,
Dave,

684
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:44.980
I always have the two of those guys lumped together.
Ah,
no.

685
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.680
Do you know Judah Friedlander?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

686
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.250
Judah will break down all of those movies and he'll,

687
00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.050
he'll have you wanting to go.
I remember one time I was going,

688
00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:54.760
what was that one way?
He was a,

689
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:57.760
they can't breaking everybody's arms and stuff like,
and he goes,

690
00:40:57.761 --> 00:41:02.400
he's just like marked for death.
He's a great movie.
I go,
what was that one about?

691
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:06.130
He goes,
that was basically Steven Seagal beats up Jamaica.

692
00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.220
And he introduced it and he gives him credit.
He goes,

693
00:41:09.221 --> 00:41:13.240
he introduced the breaking of bones into martial arts movies.

694
00:41:13.241 --> 00:41:15.550
Well before it was like people got knocked out,
they get kicked,

695
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.040
they get thrown across the fucking room.
They went through well,

696
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.690
but he actually like,

697
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:24.560
I swear to God that movie has like so many like Joe Theismann like bone breaking

698
00:41:24.561 --> 00:41:27.610
them.
You gotta like look away.
But um,
so I got to ask you,

699
00:41:27.611 --> 00:41:31.270
being a fan roadhouse also,
it was a big one for us.
It's just going to ask you,

700
00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:35.750
Oh,
if that beginning scene has to be in Omaj to use that.

701
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.070
When you're in your Miata and you put your stereo in and they show you putting

702
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:41.600
your,
your,
your glasses on,

703
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:45.380
it was that world house has that classic scene.

704
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.490
We're Swayze gets in the car and the show in the crotch gowns,
I Dah Dah.

705
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.760
And then a niche shown his car and at one point like they're shown all this cool

706
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:54.620
shit about him.
At one point he takes out a key,

707
00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:59.670
see sliding cassette tape into is,
oh my God,
I don't,
you know what,
I,

708
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:04.460
I have probably only seen roadhouse once,
maybe twice.

709
00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.900
And it was,
none of it was research for the show.
Oh,
okay.

710
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:13.710
So these were all just,
you know,
so if,

711
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:17.290
if it was an unconscious,
uh,
Omar,

712
00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:21.940
if it was any kind of homage,
I mean,
definitely,
you know,
the,

713
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.810
those are the movies we loved,
but the,
but as with everything,
I usually,

714
00:42:26.811 --> 00:42:31.490
my research consists of my tattered memories to remember

715
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.690
the whole philosophy behind roadhouse,
where it was just like,

716
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:38.780
this guy had this bar and he just couldn't keep it under control.

717
00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:43.100
And like swayzees like this,
like almost like a national headline and comic.

718
00:42:43.101 --> 00:42:44.870
But like,
he's a bouncer.
Like,

719
00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:48.170
we gotta get this guy in here to start beating the shit out of the worst oil.

720
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:51.890
It's like,
why didn't you just call it cops?
Yeah.
You don't get a metal detector.

721
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.200
Maybe.
Maybe not over serve people.

722
00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.510
Like why don't we start with the basics before you have to bring in like,

723
00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:02.120
like this ringer to comment.
But I'm alone and watch roadhouse again now.

724
00:43:02.121 --> 00:43:05.930
Now I'm excited to see it again.
Oh Dude.
It's,
it's one of the,
it's just,

725
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:10.590
that's where I think the throat rip,
uh,
didn't,

726
00:43:10.591 --> 00:43:15.290
didn't they rip somebody,
throw it out in roadhouse?
Did they submit me?

727
00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.960
Sure.
That I haven't seen in a while.

728
00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:21.750
I just remember sways and leaning against the wall and the music was on and run

729
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:24.680
other than nodding his head down on the beat and he was doing this thing where

730
00:43:24.681 --> 00:43:28.190
he was nodding it up,
which made it,
you made it look even more.

731
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:32.510
It's almost like he was saying hello to somebody across the bar and it was just,

732
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.380
hell is this?
So I don't know.
The guy's dead.

733
00:43:36.381 --> 00:43:39.080
I shouldn't be shitting on his movies.
But I mean,
it's just,
it's,

734
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.520
I feel like you're glorifying them.
I don't,
I mean it's,

735
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:49.280
it's,
I love that movie.
We went too far in the other direction though.

736
00:43:49.281 --> 00:43:53.800
Cause now I feel like every guy in so many of those movies,
a,
you know,

737
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.120
he doesn't have any expense himself.
He's awkward.

738
00:43:56.121 --> 00:43:59.630
He's got his hoodie up and I just,
you know,
the whole,
uh,

739
00:43:59.631 --> 00:44:01.400
my wife calls it the man boy,
you know,

740
00:44:01.401 --> 00:44:04.640
the guy who was 35 but acts like he's on like a first date and like that whole

741
00:44:04.641 --> 00:44:08.660
thing.
Yeah.
I just feel like that is,
uh,
was sort of the over that,

742
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:12.290
like that's the price we're paying for all of those,
you know,
uh,

743
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.610
missing in action movies.

744
00:44:13.611 --> 00:44:16.160
Like now it's going to go completely the other direction.

745
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:18.860
So I'm trying to think how the hell they're going to mock those,

746
00:44:18.861 --> 00:44:21.050
like the next generation of people mock and like those,

747
00:44:21.051 --> 00:44:23.910
those types of movies that everybody grew up on.
But,
uh,
but I,

748
00:44:23.911 --> 00:44:27.950
I asked people on Twitter to send me some questions for you and one of the

749
00:44:27.951 --> 00:44:30.110
overwhelming ones was,
is there,
you know,

750
00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:35.520
is there to be the macgruber part too?
Well,
we,
that's,

751
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:40.070
that's the plan.
We,
we've written about two thirds of an outline.
Um,

752
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.600
we,
uh,
uh,

753
00:44:42.601 --> 00:44:47.210
very in depth outline and we really liked the stuff that's in there.
Um,

754
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:52.290
we have to figure out,
you know,
it's more just scheduling stuff.

755
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:56.790
Like we've been working on the last man on earth,
me and John Solomon,
r two,

756
00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:01.530
two of the trio and then Norma Tacony.
He's working on a movie right now,
so,

757
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.920
so it'll be a while.
We're going to try to start writing.

758
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:08.640
How long does it take you?
A week or something.
How long does it take to shoot?

759
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:14.360
Macgruber was like 27 days.
27 work days.
So it was,
you know,

760
00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:18.390
[inaudible] weeks or something.
I just love when you blow up your whole crew.

761
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:23.340
Like what's funny about you is you go with the real reaction like you do,

762
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.300
but for a different thing.
Like when like if you blew up your friends,

763
00:45:27.301 --> 00:45:29.890
you just dropped he needs,
but you go like,
oh no,
no,
no.

764
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:34.890
It was like a cat was peeing on something in your house that you're going to

765
00:45:34.891 --> 00:45:39.600
have lighter aware that night that's fucking killed me.
All of that,

766
00:45:39.601 --> 00:45:42.860
like are like your facial expressions and all that type of shit.
Uh,

767
00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:45.530
well by the way,
I don't even know if we,

768
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:50.690
we have some information that there are a couple of different people who might

769
00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:56.010
be willing to,
to let us make the movie.
So,
so,
but you know,

770
00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:00.300
we won't know until we actually like sending a script.

771
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:05.310
How did you come up with the salary bit in Macabre?
I needed a distraction.

772
00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:06.990
Like were like,
all right,

773
00:46:06.991 --> 00:46:10.800
I'm going to get punished ass naked and stick a piece of salary between my ass.

774
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.700
I think we were just watching,
uh,
but uh,

775
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:19.920
I know that Yurman John watched a bunch of MacGyver's and at while we were

776
00:46:19.921 --> 00:46:21.240
writing and you know,
something,

777
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:25.170
one of us would be writing and they'd be watching stuff and writing also,

778
00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:28.740
and they saw something in there where he,
uh,

779
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:34.250
he had had this table of things laid out and made it seem like he was about to

780
00:46:36.841 --> 00:46:39.750
use every element of that,
uh,
to,

781
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:43.320
to cook up some kind of a contraption.
Yeah.

782
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:47.250
One of the things on there was a carrot and he said,
all right,

783
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.480
let's see what we got here.

784
00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:52.080
And then you cut to him eating the carrot and he's just like,
he was hungry.

785
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:56.550
And so for some reason it did came from that.
Um,

786
00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.340
and originally it was going to be a carrot and then we thought like,

787
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:02.610
oh well that,
that'll seem,
it already wasn't,
you know,

788
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:06.870
it was our own disgusting take on on that and it didn't really have anything

789
00:47:06.871 --> 00:47:08.840
that,
you know,
obviously macgyver never serious.

790
00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.820
He just stripped down and nothing behind something.

791
00:47:11.821 --> 00:47:14.940
You grab your junk and you stick salary and you just walk out in front of a

792
00:47:14.941 --> 00:47:18.460
camera crew.
That's why people go like,
Oh yeah,
you know,
like doing stand up.

793
00:47:18.461 --> 00:47:20.250
All my God,
they like take so much courage.

794
00:47:20.251 --> 00:47:24.570
It's like I told I walk out closed and if it goes wrong,
I blamed the crowd.

795
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.770
I mean,
it's easy.

796
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.990
Like you got a worse thing is my mom was there that day and not,

797
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:32.080
that wasn't even the worst thing.
My mom was there.

798
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.390
So we're at this warehouse and I looked,
you know,

799
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:37.750
I had done a couple of takes and I look over and there's my mom and she had two

800
00:47:37.751 --> 00:47:40.780
friends with her.
Um,
so there the friends where,
you know,

801
00:47:40.781 --> 00:47:45.070
my mom has kind of a pasted on smile.
Like that's my son,
that's,

802
00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:49.540
he's doing this,
he's getting paid for this.
It's comedy.
It's kind of $12,000.

803
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:53.410
I made $12,000 from Gerber.
Um,
Jesus Christ.

804
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:57.130
And then her friends were just aghast.
They,
they,

805
00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:02.020
these all northern California.
Nice.
Yeah.
Nice people,
wonderful people.

806
00:48:02.021 --> 00:48:03.670
And I think they're,
they're,
you know,

807
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.470
at least they weren't there on the days when you were down on your knees going,

808
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:10.840
I will suck you with that.
I will let,
would've been,

809
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:14.530
I will let you fuck me.
My mom lost friends from,

810
00:48:14.531 --> 00:48:18.280
cause my mom is the most supportive person in the world and cheese.

811
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:20.710
She brought several friends.
She would just,

812
00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.730
my mom probably sound macgruber 20 times in the theater just so she could bring

813
00:48:24.731 --> 00:48:29.710
different friends and some of them are no longer her friends because of that

814
00:48:29.711 --> 00:48:32.180
movie.
Really.
Who Crystal wake,

815
00:48:32.181 --> 00:48:35.710
who's one of the funniest people ever play in your ideal love interests.

816
00:48:35.711 --> 00:48:38.530
And I loved it,
the keyboards.
So my favorite thing was when she whispered,

817
00:48:38.531 --> 00:48:42.540
I love you at the end of the song,
but like your sex scenes,

818
00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:48.010
w I mean,
thank God your mom didn't show up that day when you,
and then,
oh my God,

819
00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:53.250
she's it.
Kristin was such a trooper because I believe guys,

820
00:48:53.251 --> 00:48:56.560
like I was thinking you could probably get like 0.8 seconds before he'd start

821
00:48:56.561 --> 00:48:59.740
laughing.
Like how long did it take you to shoot that it,
uh,

822
00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:03.760
thank you for using the term shoot.
Um,
it was,
uh,

823
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.830
it was like probably two hours in this,
uh,

824
00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:13.420
upstairs bedrooms.
So it's,
we're in Albuquerque in the middle of the summer.

825
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:17.590
It's already super hot everywhere.
You have these,
these lights,

826
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:20.780
uh,
burn and you,
you know,
and,

827
00:49:20.781 --> 00:49:25.450
and so this room is just an oven and I am,
I,
I am a sweater.

828
00:49:25.451 --> 00:49:27.130
If I get to a certain point,
I'm just,

829
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:31.690
I start sweating and it doesn't point out fucking yes.
Oh my God.

830
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.490
Like about four threats then.
And I just started helping her with,

831
00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:40.780
with like huge drops of sweat and there was hair all over.

832
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:46.360
It was her birthday too.
So she was,
it was just the worst birthday of all time.

833
00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:49.560
Oh my God.
But then they gave her a very special treat.
They,

834
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.450
cause we were in Albuquerque so they,

835
00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:56.200
they like hooked her up with this special room in Santa fe where she could go

836
00:49:56.201 --> 00:50:01.201
and shower off and get massages and get the experience out of her head.

837
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.770
Did you,
uh,

838
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.870
did you like what sort of mindset cause that cause you know,

839
00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:10.180
I tried to get these acting gigs what every once in a while and like my big

840
00:50:10.181 --> 00:50:12.400
thing is like having to,
you know,

841
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.820
the big thing that turning point for me when I finally actually started getting

842
00:50:15.821 --> 00:50:19.870
jobs,
just to not be self conscious.
Like someone like you,
you seem the quiet,

843
00:50:19.871 --> 00:50:21.420
reserved kind of person,
but like the,

844
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:26.230
the characters you play and how hard you commit to them.
Like,

845
00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:30.090
wait,
where do you like man,
I'm just asking you like,
uh,
as a,
you know,

846
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.200
potential act or to,
to a great actor.
Like,
where do you go?

847
00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:37.340
Like mentally before you just walk in like,
all right,
fuck this.
I gotta just,

848
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:41.780
I gotta do you have to psych yourself up to go 100%.
He one of those people like,

849
00:50:41.781 --> 00:50:45.620
all right,
I'm just,
I'm this guy now,
so all my hangups disappear.

850
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:50.450
You know what it's,
I think it really is.
If you,
if you believe in the thing,

851
00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.470
if you'd like what you're doing,
it's really easy to fully commit.
It's,

852
00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:57.560
it's really hard when you,
when you think something is,

853
00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.170
is not good to do that.

854
00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.440
Do you have any examples early on without outing anybody that wrote something

855
00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:05.660
and I know you,
you seem like you didn't want to shit on anybody.

856
00:51:05.661 --> 00:51:09.550
So just different sketches that SNL,
uh,
you know,

857
00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:14.570
when sometimes you would be asked to do somebody else's sketch and you were,

858
00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:19.120
you know,
you have no say in it and uh,

859
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.970
or sometimes you would write your own little turd and,

860
00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:24.830
and like he'd get out there and he'd go,
oh,
this is,

861
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:30.380
this is not good.
Oh,
sorry,
go ahead.

862
00:51:30.381 --> 00:51:34.730
It makes it through the gauntlet of all those people trying to get a sketch on.

863
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:38.720
Yeah,
it makes it past Lauren.
It makes it passively,

864
00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:40.880
they do like a little run through,
right?
Everybody's thinking.

865
00:51:40.881 --> 00:51:43.440
It's funny now when it goes out there is,

866
00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:46.920
and it just dies isn't,
well,
I mean it's,

867
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.900
the funny thing is like you,
you,
uh,
like at the Groundlings,
we,

868
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:55.880
we do shows that are,
are,
uh,
I'm,
I'm not there anymore,
but,
but when,

869
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:58.280
when we,
when you sign up to do a show,

870
00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:01.720
you're doing the same show for about three months.
You know,
you,

871
00:52:01.721 --> 00:52:04.520
you have this process where you're getting the show together and once you lock

872
00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:09.220
in the show,
it's the same show,
you know,
for four nights.
You know,

873
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:12.740
when one show on Friday,
two shows Saturday night,

874
00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:14.540
that same show for three months.

875
00:52:14.541 --> 00:52:18.530
And there are nights when everything kills and there are nights that stuff just

876
00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:22.910
totally falls flat.
So you just realize,
oh Geez,
it's,
it's the audience.

877
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:27.890
It can be anything.
So at SNL you're just,
you know,
some nights,

878
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:29.950
some nights it's definitely the materials.

879
00:52:29.951 --> 00:52:34.760
Some nights you just have an audience that might be slightly older,

880
00:52:34.761 --> 00:52:37.370
slightly younger,
you know,
you just,
you never know.

881
00:52:37.371 --> 00:52:40.250
So sometimes you get really lucky and sometimes you get really unlucky.

882
00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.620
Most of the time,
you know,
this stuff,

883
00:52:42.621 --> 00:52:47.210
we'll get the shake that it deserves,
but,

884
00:52:47.211 --> 00:52:51.650
but uh,
not always.
And what was your game plan if you're doing it?
Okay.

885
00:52:51.651 --> 00:52:56.420
If you're,
you're on live television and you're doing a sketch and it bombs,

886
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:58.550
it's starting to bomb it signed the bottom,

887
00:52:58.551 --> 00:53:02.420
you fill it bombing and then do you have like a thing where you're like,

888
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:03.150
you know,

889
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:06.290
whenever plow through this thing or I'm going to commit even harder or I'm not

890
00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:08.810
trying to make the other person in the scene laugh or just some,

891
00:53:08.811 --> 00:53:11.330
some way to try to pull some sort of victory out of it?

892
00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:14.780
Or do you just try to get through it and pretend it never happened?

893
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:20.270
I'm pretty good about maintaining the level of commitment.

894
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:26.220
I'll never try to laugh.
That's,
that's uh,
a little bit of a cheat.
Um,

895
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:31.230
yeah.
And have was something that you break character?
Uh,
yeah.

896
00:53:31.231 --> 00:53:34.100
I mean,
I kind of go into hyperfocus.

897
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:37.860
It's not even that I don't like sometimes I think stuff's really funny and I

898
00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:41.880
just,
I just am concentrating on not screwing up.
Um,

899
00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:44.420
but like we did bill,

900
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:48.990
Bill Hader and I did this sketch with Josh Brolin called Fart face and he just

901
00:53:48.991 --> 00:53:53.010
talked about it on Letterman.
I see.
I'm already handling this.

902
00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:57.870
I wish you were in the audience that night because people hated it.
I mean,

903
00:53:57.871 --> 00:54:02.460
it was,
it was how can you make fudge face?
I know,
right?

904
00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:04.470
If,
and,
and it wasn't just that,

905
00:54:04.471 --> 00:54:09.471
it's not like it wasn't gratuitous use of the aid was semi gratuitous use of the

906
00:54:10.891 --> 00:54:15.090
term fart face,
but it was a business setting.
And these two very committed,

907
00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:18.180
uh,
this emotional scene between two guys.

908
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.440
One of them is calling the other person that fart face and it's hard to
describe,

909
00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:27.240
but we did it at the dress rehearsal show to complete silence.
It was almost,

910
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.810
it was almost so silent that it was a vacuum.
We almost opened up,
uh,
you know,

911
00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:36.750
some kind of port horse.
So
we thought,

912
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:39.510
oh,
that's crazy.
I have,
I liked it.
I don't know.

913
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:43.190
I don't know why that audience didn't like it,
but you know what else?

914
00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:47.650
We gave it our best,
uh,
who gave it our best try anyway,
we go up,
you know it,

915
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:50.310
what happens is you finish the dresser or a solo show,

916
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:51.570
you wait about a half hour,

917
00:54:51.571 --> 00:54:55.440
then you go in to find out the pieces that are selected.
Now this was the night,

918
00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:59.520
it was during that 2008 election cycle.
And uh,

919
00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:03.390
Sarah Pailin was actually there that night.
She is,

920
00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:06.570
Tina had already been doing her.
Sarah,
Sarah Palin,
this was,

921
00:55:06.571 --> 00:55:09.930
I believe the night that Sarah Pailin herself actually came on to.

922
00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:13.940
So this was a big deal of a show for SNL.

923
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:18.980
I think it ended up being the most watched SNL in years,

924
00:55:19.081 --> 00:55:21.480
you know,
years and years.
Anyway,

925
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:26.460
we go in there and we see that fart face is somehow in the show.

926
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:30.000
It made it into the show.
I mean,

927
00:55:30.001 --> 00:55:34.040
there were no laughs at all.
So it was,
I still,
you know,

928
00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:36.750
it's a real testament to Lauren cause it was,
you know,

929
00:55:36.751 --> 00:55:41.330
he thought he thought it was funny,
I guess.
Oh the one knows.

930
00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:42.173
What did you guys say?

931
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:46.020
Lauren goes through and he does different notes during the,
during the,
uh,

932
00:55:46.021 --> 00:55:50.420
you know,
it's like,
oh,
just too,
you know,
there was a,
there was this,
uh,

933
00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:54.180
maybe a tread to speed up this,
uh,
during this and it goes to reach sketch.

934
00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:56.940
And I just remember him coming to,
to ours and he says,

935
00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:01.170
here's the boom shadow on fort face.
And that was it.

936
00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:04.590
He goes on to the next thing.
So,
uh,

937
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:06.600
we go out there and it was just like,

938
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:11.130
we remembered the experience of no,
uh,

939
00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:15.800
no laughter at all,
so we don't want to out there and wait,

940
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:20.070
what was the bill built?
I didn't remember this,
but bill told this on,

941
00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:21.690
on Letterman.

942
00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:26.050
I think he said that Josh Brolin came out and we were all sitting there.

943
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:29.450
It was like we were going into battle and Josh Brolin and says,
all right,

944
00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:33.010
let's go shit these mother fuckers up or something like that.

945
00:56:33.011 --> 00:56:37.480
I forget something like that.
Uh,
and,
and it was,

946
00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:41.830
and we did,
we did,
we went out there if we,
but we gave it our all,
you know,

947
00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:45.160
all three of us.
But it was,
I watched it,
um,

948
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.870
because when I heard bill talk about it,
I thought I got,

949
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:49.690
I want to watch this again.
We watched it

950
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:55.980
and I still stand by that sketch.
It's funny,
I don't know what the,

951
00:56:56.090 --> 00:57:01.090
I don't know.
We really committed to it.
It's stupid for sure.
Um,

952
00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:05.240
but I,
you know,
I,
I dunno,
I,
you know,
some things you'd just,
that's,

953
00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.450
there's no way if I went out there,

954
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:12.610
if I was with two other people and I'm doing something like fart face and it's

955
00:57:12.611 --> 00:57:17.080
bombing,
I think I would start laughing.
I would like not laughing.

956
00:57:17.081 --> 00:57:22.081
Like it would just make me want to commit harder to it and maybe stress Fart

957
00:57:22.211 --> 00:57:26.200
face or make a weird face at somebody.
Just something that,
um,

958
00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:31.540
I got this weird thing where I kind of enjoy like bombing a little bit.

959
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.360
Yeah.
Not Enough.
Not if I'm really,
like,
if I really believe in something,

960
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:35.560
if I really think of jokes,

961
00:57:35.561 --> 00:57:39.040
good and the nightlife and then that gets frustrating.
But like,
um,

962
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:41.380
if I still know I'm being funny but it's bombing,

963
00:57:41.381 --> 00:57:44.290
that's one of my favorite things.
I did a run through one time for this,
you know,

964
00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:49.000
yet another failed pilot.
And um,
they said they wanted something edgy.

965
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:52.270
So we went super edgy and I guess it was way beyond what the fuck they thought

966
00:57:52.271 --> 00:57:53.010
it was going to be.

967
00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:55.960
And so we started doing the runs from in front of the network guys,
you know,

968
00:57:55.961 --> 00:57:56.411
they come in,

969
00:57:56.411 --> 00:58:00.460
it feels like the ACA has been fucking turned down even lower and they come in

970
00:58:00.461 --> 00:58:03.190
and just the first thing dies at,
the second thing dies and,

971
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:06.940
and all of a sudden these actors I'm working with got this looks on their faces.

972
00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:10.840
And then that became my motivation because that became my entertainment was

973
00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:14.560
doing the scene and then passing other actors and they were shooting me looks

974
00:58:14.561 --> 00:58:18.970
like going,
oh my God,
this is bombing.
And it just became my entertainment.

975
00:58:18.971 --> 00:58:21.490
It was one of my favorite run throughs I ever did do.

976
00:58:21.491 --> 00:58:24.640
When I tell you from the beginning to the end,

977
00:58:24.641 --> 00:58:29.500
it was 22 minutes of silence.
Like we,

978
00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:32.850
the thing started off,
been there.
Yeah,
it started off with that.

979
00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:33.610
Why am I telling you that?

980
00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.540
You don't know what it just like they literally started off with the guy playing

981
00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:37.300
my friend,

982
00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:41.440
a homeless guy comes up to us who they later said was way too homeless looking

983
00:58:41.441 --> 00:58:43.180
way too dirty,
way to filthy.

984
00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:47.830
He asked for money and I'm the liberals so I go to digging in my pocket to do
it,

985
00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:52.940
to give them the money and my brother who's in a wheelchair grabs like some a

986
00:58:53.351 --> 00:58:54.370
scoop of ice cream,

987
00:58:54.371 --> 00:58:58.180
calls him a scumbag and flips it in his face and it totally like cut his beard

988
00:58:58.181 --> 00:59:02.500
and like ended up in his hair and I remember hearing like an audible gasp from

989
00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:06.760
the net with,
they're like,
oh,
like it was horrible and it just immediately VK.

990
00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:08.200
I was like,
oh here we go.

991
00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:12.310
We got one more scene if we don't get them in the next thing.
This thing has,

992
00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:16.120
this is a runaway train.
It dude,
like we fucking bombed so bad.

993
00:59:16.121 --> 00:59:19.700
And I remember afterwards drinking with this guy and,
uh,

994
00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:24.120
we were both back at the hotel just laughing,
going,
I'm getting fired now.

995
00:59:24.121 --> 00:59:27.230
I'm getting fired or whatever.
Nothing.
I don't know.
What stage was that?

996
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:30.540
Was that like the early run through of the show?

997
00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:33.860
Was that the final no,
no,
this was,
this was,
uh,

998
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:36.430
we were getting ready to shoot the pilot.
Okay.
And we will,

999
00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:39.770
we will coming up on it,
and I forget the name of the director,

1000
00:59:39.771 --> 00:59:42.560
but he was rehearsing the hell out of it.
So we will all,
like,

1001
00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:45.470
I remember the night when we shot it,
they toned everything down.

1002
00:59:45.471 --> 00:59:48.800
But like this guy of like rehearse is so much,
I was like,
this is like maniacal,

1003
00:59:48.801 --> 00:59:49.521
man.
This is crazy.

1004
00:59:49.521 --> 00:59:51.500
But I just remember the night when we finally went to shoot it,

1005
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:54.920
there was only a couple of pickups,
so I totally understood the method,

1006
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:58.880
method of his madness.
I just needed to do one episode with them.
Unfortunately,

1007
00:59:58.881 --> 01:00:03.110
it was the last one because he was a great director.
But,
um,
the,
uh,

1008
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:05.930
at that point it was just the run through.
So we're already in there.

1009
01:00:05.931 --> 01:00:10.440
There's nobody in the bleachers.
There's no audiences,
no nothing.
Yeah.
And what,

1010
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:14.750
what's funny is they did the first scene and usually the writers will sort of

1011
01:00:14.751 --> 01:00:19.080
laugh along and try to prime oh yeah.
The [inaudible] get here.
I mean,

1012
01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:23.000
some people who are writers,
uh,
who's,

1013
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:27.120
who basically are only hired because they're good laughs.
Yeah.

1014
01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:29.960
Doing refers just to get people going.

1015
01:00:29.961 --> 01:00:34.060
But I think when they audibly gasped and it bombed,
and then we just,

1016
01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.810
the sound of shoes walking on the floor over to the fake living room to like to

1017
01:00:38.811 --> 01:00:42.050
the next thing.
I think everybody was like,
oh my God,
this,

1018
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:44.840
you just felt it in the air.
And uh,

1019
01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:48.590
I think even the writers claimed they probably wanted to walk out.
It was a,

1020
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:50.840
it's just the weirdest thing ever.

1021
01:00:50.841 --> 01:00:53.480
It was one of my favorite things I ever got to be in

1022
01:00:55.010 --> 01:01:00.010
that 22 minutes of just absolute utter so I can kind of bomb.

1023
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:04.550
I can't even remember.
I can't even read the end.
If there was even any clapping.

1024
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:08.990
I just remember this one actress face who was playing the mom.
She kind of like,

1025
01:01:08.991 --> 01:01:11.420
she did her line that bombed and then I did my line,

1026
01:01:11.421 --> 01:01:16.020
that bond who was classic like you know,
a [inaudible] movement of actors.
Yeah.

1027
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:19.700
You say your thing and then you walk out this door is somebody else walks in,

1028
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:21.740
you know,
just that sort of like a play.

1029
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.820
And I just remember her walking just fucking look on her face.

1030
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.990
Like she had just seen a ghost.
I don't know.

1031
01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:32.900
That's why I always like talking to you guys who came up through sketch because

1032
01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:36.350
I'm,
I've always been a huge,
huge fan and I just went the completely different,

1033
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:39.800
uh,
the isolated way.
So,
um,
yeah,

1034
01:01:39.801 --> 01:01:44.540
I mean at least the thing about sketch that's really nice and reassuring is

1035
01:01:44.541 --> 01:01:48.350
you're always out there with other people and you're also usually playing a

1036
01:01:48.351 --> 01:01:53.210
character.
So if you,
if you have a reaction that's just horrible,

1037
01:01:53.211 --> 01:01:56.360
you can blame it on the character.
You don't have to blame it on yourself,

1038
01:01:56.361 --> 01:01:56.860
which is the,

1039
01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:01.100
you know what's really tough about how you do it as like when you bomb,

1040
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:05.750
it's,
you know,
Bill Burr is bombing.
They're not liking,

1041
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:10.220
but the thing is as,
as it thing is,
you don't bump,
but as it hell yeah.
Oh yeah,

1042
01:02:10.221 --> 01:02:13.010
I do.
And I did for a long time.
As you bomb though,

1043
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:16.680
you have the option to just pull the rip cord and go into something else.
Uh,

1044
01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.320
where you guys are just like,

1045
01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.790
it's like you're an a Bob sled and you just go down and you're picking up speed

1046
01:02:22.791 --> 01:02:26.330
going to this brick wall and there's no break and you just have to slam into the

1047
01:02:26.331 --> 01:02:29.290
thing.
But you just brought up like doing character.
So I wanted to,
uh,

1048
01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:32.760
cause we kind of,
I know you have this one was at wonder con.

1049
01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:34.810
You have to go to wondercon.
Um,

1050
01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.890
I want to do whenever I wanted to ask you like what is,
uh,

1051
01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.690
what are your favorite characters?
Um,

1052
01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:44.470
what do you do have a favorite character that you do?

1053
01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.160
Favorite gay characters that I,
that I do.
Yeah.
The most fun for you to do.

1054
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:52.870
I love doing this character called Hamilton from SNL.

1055
01:02:52.871 --> 01:02:56.370
I didn't do it that many times,
but the funny thing is,
uh,

1056
01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:00.890
it's kind of this definitely a very odd,
uh,

1057
01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:06.390
uh,
insensitive,
uh,
racist,
uh,
uh,

1058
01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:09.240
just,
uh,
a Weirdo and,
and it's any,

1059
01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:10.060
<v 1>he has this,</v>

1060
01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:15.060
the police like this and he's just says crazy things too about society

1061
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:24.500
<v 0>and,
and it's so much fun to do this.
And,
and then,
uh,</v>

1062
01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:28.760
Seth Meyers asked me to do the character,
uh,
at his,
uh,

1063
01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.010
his rehearsal dinner there.

1064
01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.340
He asked me to give a toast as this guy that was,

1065
01:03:34.550 --> 01:03:37.040
it's one of the most fun things I've ever done.

1066
01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.670
And then Andy Samberg's wedding was like two weeks later.
And so he,

1067
01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:45.320
he was at sets and he said,
oh,
we got to come do one of those for me.

1068
01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:48.650
So I've had so much fun.
How do you come up with doing that character?

1069
01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.900
And I don't have an outlet to do stuff like that that much anymore.

1070
01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:57.160
How do I grab it's late night.
Said,
SNL like your,

1071
01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:59.250
how do you just like don't think the little guy,

1072
01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:01.700
so this is a comic I'm so fascinated with with the sketch guys,

1073
01:04:01.701 --> 01:04:04.860
like how you do the thing.
Um,
uh,

1074
01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.850
I was watching when you doing the Tim Calhoon character,
oh,
Tim Calhoun.

1075
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.830
And when you were like running for president,

1076
01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:11.710
I watched this clip this morning and you,

1077
01:04:11.711 --> 01:04:15.230
you were doing this thing with your fingers when you,
you do like,

1078
01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:17.990
like three with the left and then three with the right.

1079
01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.710
And you were just saying all this horribly like offensive stuff and you are you

1080
01:04:21.711 --> 01:04:26.450
speaking in like this whisper,
but like you,
you kind of captured like that,

1081
01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.230
uh,
like tell me runs for president.
If they're making it an annoying gesture.

1082
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.470
Yeah.
Like they'll say,
oh,
don't do that.
That,
that seems rude.

1083
01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.620
And then you can just see them like,
so as they're trying to give this speech,

1084
01:04:36.621 --> 01:04:38.810
self conscious about what to do with their hands,
like you,

1085
01:04:38.811 --> 01:04:41.480
like we're picking up on that stuff.
And that's one of those things,
well,

1086
01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:43.700
I got to give the credit on that and like that,

1087
01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:47.090
that's something I used to do at the Groundlings.
And that's,

1088
01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:51.810
that's one of the things that I used as my audition piece.
Cause that was,
uh,
um,

1089
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:54.590
but,
but I had written this thing and I was,

1090
01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:57.010
can you do a little bit of Tim Calhoun?
I don't want to put you on the spot.

1091
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.750
<v 1>I am Tim cow,
him</v>

1092
01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:07.080
a United States senator.
Real prison.

1093
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:09.390
Munis sits in America

1094
01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.430
since he read some of the things.

1095
01:05:14.431 --> 01:05:17.960
How do American needs another

1096
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.850
<v 0>big lake?
That's how I read it.
That's the worst rendition of that.</v>

1097
01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:28.780
You were going to trade the,
the Grand Canyon for the Eiffel Tower.

1098
01:05:28.781 --> 01:05:30.280
And when they send us the Eiffel Tower,

1099
01:05:30.281 --> 01:05:32.560
we're not going to give them the Grand Canyon.
The

1100
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:37.720
woman who was our director at the Groundlings,

1101
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:42.390
she was the one who told me to do something with my hands and,
and even,
uh,

1102
01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:46.300
gave me these specific instructions.
So I had the,

1103
01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:50.350
the sheepish look in the,
the words I had.
I had written all that,
but,

1104
01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:54.190
but she gave me that,
which is such an important element of it.
So like,
that's,

1105
01:05:54.191 --> 01:05:57.400
you know,
that's one of the good things about sketch too is it's,
you know,

1106
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:59.780
you've got this whole team of people around you who are,

1107
01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.010
who are helping to make everything better.
I don't,
I,
I think,

1108
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:05.650
I think you'll one of the best,
Matt,
and I'm,
I'm so,

1109
01:06:05.651 --> 01:06:09.010
I'm so happy for you that you won't have those guys.
Like,
you know,

1110
01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:11.490
I didn't even bring up like Nebraska or all all this,

1111
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.760
like that's a drama that will,
you know,
did,
uh,
somebody won an Oscar in that,

1112
01:06:15.761 --> 01:06:20.180
right?
Uh,
it was nominated and I have done any research in this and Emma,
we did.

1113
01:06:20.181 --> 01:06:23.310
Okay.
Right.
I think somebody wants something shiny.
No,

1114
01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:26.860
it was nominated for a bunch.
Uh,
Bruce dern was nominated.

1115
01:06:26.861 --> 01:06:29.830
Alexander Payne was nominated for directing it.
They was,

1116
01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:34.660
the film itself was nominated a June Squibb was nominated for,
uh,

1117
01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:38.140
for supporting actress.
It was,
uh,
it was,

1118
01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:41.470
I still can't believe I got to be a part of that.
Yeah.
Well,
I've been watching,

1119
01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.750
I've been,
obviously I was going to say I've been watching you.

1120
01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:46.340
That sounds creepy,
but I've been a fan of your career,
but I,

1121
01:06:46.341 --> 01:06:49.360
I you just seem like one of those guys where you,
uh,

1122
01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.370
you actually had the career that I love you.
You're like,

1123
01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.610
people know you but you're not like sucked into that,
uh,
you know,

1124
01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.940
entertainment tonight like to dye coming out of Starbucks,

1125
01:06:58.941 --> 01:07:03.190
sleep that will forte and some uggs,
like you weren't in that.

1126
01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:07.510
And I was just like watching,
like you said,
like this guy's making cool choices.

1127
01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:12.430
Everything that he makes is of quality,
whether you know,
and whenever you know,

1128
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:15.760
you get a fucking movie,
you don't know what it's going to go up against,

1129
01:07:15.761 --> 01:07:19.000
whether it works or not,
but like you would just always like good in everything.

1130
01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:21.860
So when this thing came out,
um,

1131
01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:25.830
I was thinking like such an original idea,
oh my God,
will forte going to be it?

1132
01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.750
This is going to be,
you know,
exceeded expectations.

1133
01:07:28.751 --> 01:07:32.730
But I got to get Fox prompts because way back in the day they did a real,
um,
um,

1134
01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.900
do you remember get a life with a Chris Elliot where yes,

1135
01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.650
he lived at home with his parents and he had a paper route and he was like in

1136
01:07:38.651 --> 01:07:39.760
his thirties.
That was just it.

1137
01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:43.790
He lived in the attic and it was just so fucking weird and like,

1138
01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:47.700
so like they do have a history of,
of uh,
oh my God doing stuff like that.

1139
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:51.250
Many of those old like,
like I remember when Fox was,

1140
01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:54.280
was really young and,
and,
and yeah,

1141
01:07:54.281 --> 01:07:57.310
that show kid a life was so great that Garry Shandling show,

1142
01:07:57.370 --> 01:07:59.380
there's Shandling show.
Oh my God.
Mary was,

1143
01:07:59.381 --> 01:08:02.200
Sheldon was the one that blew up with children and Tracey Ullman show.

1144
01:08:02.201 --> 01:08:06.400
All those shows were the Simpsons and the Simpsons came out of that.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

1145
01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:10.030
well dude,
you're,
they pass the baton to the right guy,
man.
I,
uh,

1146
01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.880
do you have anything that you want to promote before,
uh,

1147
01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:18.020
no rattle effortless hour here?
No,
I've,
I've,

1148
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.980
I mean,
whatever.
I just want to say thank you to Fox and thank,

1149
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.360
is there a night live two of the great experiences of my life.
All right.

1150
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:30.050
And I just,
you know,
we talk about it and I go back and like I,
you know,

1151
01:08:30.051 --> 01:08:31.930
I go like God,
I hope,
you know,

1152
01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:35.570
I'll tell little stories about Saturday night live and I forget if I tell the

1153
01:08:35.571 --> 01:08:35.990
part,

1154
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:40.880
which is like how appreciative I am to what an experience it was.

1155
01:08:40.881 --> 01:08:42.980
And like,
you know,
to Lauren,

1156
01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.930
none of this would be happening if it wasn't for him.
So,
you know,

1157
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.230
what a great experience.
Well Dude,
you've been just little kiss ass.

1158
01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:54.530
That's the equivalent of me saying goodnight at the end of a party.

1159
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:58.110
It's still in there.
