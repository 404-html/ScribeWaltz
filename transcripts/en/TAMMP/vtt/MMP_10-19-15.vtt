00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.610
Hey,
what's going on?
It still burns time for the Monday morning podcast for,
uh,

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.230
October 19th,
2015.

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.160
How's it go and how I,
uh,
uh,
I'm on the road now.

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.060
I'm on the road again chicka boom chicka boom,
boom,
boom.
I had,

5
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:20.580
you can't wait to eat on the road again.
Well,
you know what?

6
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:24.060
I can't wait to get on the road again because I'm an old man and I'm out here

7
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:28.240
and I'm cold.
Ah,
God,

8
00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:32.410
I love the Midwest,
but it's right,
right when the fucking winter starts.

9
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.380
This can be kind of a motherfucker,
you know,
it is.

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.260
This takes me back to my days.

11
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.900
Back in the day when I was young and I had more freckles,
um,

12
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.760
and I used to do,
uh,

13
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.270
<v 0>okay.</v>

14
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.560
<v 1>I used to do all the college gigs out here.
Um,
you know,</v>

15
00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:56.390
my agent a Bass Shula,
you still always book me.

16
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.180
Um,
they were based out,

17
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:02.120
it's still are based out of Chicago and they used to just booked me in like

18
00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:06.290
Duluth de Moines,
the quad cities,

19
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.760
Hayes,
Nebraska,
Grand Junction,
Colorado.

20
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.100
Colorado wasn't as bad because you had the rocky mountains to look at and you

21
00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:19.580
can be like,
oh my God,
looks like a beer commercial.
You,

22
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.040
yeah.
That guy who does those fucking ram commercials.
What's his name?

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.883
Sam Elliott.

24
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.940
We'd get on their cores beer brewed in the rocky mountains.

25
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.060
No,
it isn't.
No,
it isn't.
They don't have a factory up in the rocky mountains.

26
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:38.180
They don't.
It's on the flatlands.
It's probably somewhere in Denver,

27
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.180
although the rent's probably too high.
I don't know where it is.

28
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:44.860
Where the fucking you fucking shuttle in illegal immigrants in and out the back

29
00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:48.620
door and nobody will see it.
You know,
that's not up in that.

30
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:51.230
You're not going to get illegal immigrants to go up to a fucking mountain right

31
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.190
there already.
Like listen to it.

32
00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:55.970
I already swam across the fucking filthy river to get in here.
Okay.

33
00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm not walking up a mountain,
you know,

34
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.730
if you're going to fucking exploit me.

35
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.350
<v 0>Okay.</v>

36
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.190
<v 1>With my labor,
we're doing it right here.
And then they go.</v>

37
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.130
I build a factory around them.
Um,
maybe it ends up in the mountains.

38
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:14.510
I have no idea.
I just remember at one point I W I was rafting,

39
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.350
not rafting.

40
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.430
I was in like a little inner tube going down the river with a bunch of other

41
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.950
fucking people that was to same river.
Oh that's right.

42
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.860
We went by the chorus factory.
I'm like,
this is the fucking factory

43
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.940
with all those,
you know those Denver hippies,

44
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.120
there is specific kinds of hippie for Denver hippie.

45
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.670
You know what their action sandals,

46
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.750
you know saying sorta look at those hippy toes kind of thing.

47
00:02:38.751 --> 00:02:40.220
But they also have that look like,

48
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:44.720
you know they're going to go swing on a rope and jump into a fucking lake.

49
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.540
Those Denver hit piece,
you know them,

50
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.850
they're like fucking ski instructors for their whole lives.
Right?

51
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.830
Like 50 you still got long hair,
you know,

52
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.470
fucking door and buy one of those squirrel suits when I was flying squirrel

53
00:03:03.471 --> 00:03:05.180
suits like that type of shit.
Right.

54
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.810
I think I went from hippies into a,

55
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.920
I don't know what those people are.

56
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.450
Those people who jump off of buildings with their parachute watered up in the

57
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:20.770
hand,
like a,
like a bouquet at a wedding,
you know,
for them,

58
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:25.030
they just throw it away except it saves their life.
You know?

59
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.040
I don't mind that those cons do it.
It just bugs me that they have to film it.

60
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.500
You know what I mean?
You know,
if you awesome,
I can't just be awesome.

61
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:37.930
I just go do it.
Get off the fact that you got to film it,

62
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:39.460
that really knocks it down for me.

63
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.300
You never saw superman with a little fucking Gopro on did you?

64
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.630
He just fucking went out and save people.
Then he goes home,

65
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:50.800
he puts his fucking Janeane Garofalo glasses back on.
He goes back.

66
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:53.140
Do you know it goes back to the fucking,
the newspaper

67
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.370
do Clark Kent couldn't close it.
Fucking piece of pussy if it,
he never,

68
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:02.830
he never banged glow.
A slight daddy.
I mean,

69
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:06.100
granted she had a crush on a superhero,
but you know,

70
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:08.630
you can work on her in securities law.

71
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.320
Was she not going to land that I'm right here and let's make a life together.

72
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:15.910
I give you take off my navy blue trousers over here and do something.

73
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.860
Give me a little help.
Can we get the Kryptonite out?
Am I nuts?
Sale lowly.

74
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.263
Right.

75
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.000
<v 0>Okay.</v>

76
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.080
<v 1>You fucking assholes jumping around on those little flying squirrel suits.</v>

77
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:30.690
It's just,
you know,
I don't understand why you need to fill the need.

78
00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:31.890
You have to film yourself

79
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.620
to be a little more super math.

80
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:38.270
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.930
<v 1>All right.
Little,
a little less.
Uh,</v>

82
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.570
Colorado Rocky Mountain Hippie,
all,
they're the worst.
They're the worst.
You know,

83
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:50.050
when you go to San Francisco and you run into a Hippie,
it's like you expect it.

84
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.550
You know what I mean?
That's right.

85
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:56.120
All the leaves are Brown and the sky is gray.

86
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.850
I have dirty,
see,
sorry.
Sorry.

87
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.740
Excuse me.
There's,
you can kind of carry it to him.
Um,

88
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.970
when you are rocky mountain,
so wait,
what do you expect?

89
00:05:10.971 --> 00:05:13.070
Do you expect you're going to see that guy walking around

90
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.680
<v 0>okay.</v>

91
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.380
<v 1>With the orange crush barrel around them?
Remember that guy?</v>

92
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:19.660
I think he died the guy,
he's got all the Broncos games.

93
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.970
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

94
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.740
<v 1>You know,
expect,
you're going to see that.
You're going to see some,</v>

95
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:29.590
a frontier kind of ladies,
right?

96
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.470
You expect to see Sam Elliott drinking of course,
course light,
the silver bullet.

97
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.600
That's what you expect to see.
And then you show up.

98
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:40.190
And this just says new fucking hippie.

99
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.870
The shippy that skis pippies don't ski,
right?

100
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.870
He'd be stone base jump

101
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.730
does special kind of heat when you're up there too.
And the mile high city,

102
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.190
by the way.
How about,
how about a hand for the Cleveland Browns?
This,
this week,

103
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.080
you know,
finding 87,

104
00:06:01.081 --> 00:06:06.081
possibly 88 ways to lose that game to the Denver Broncos grand.

105
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:07.460
The Broncos were fucking up to

106
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.520
unreal when fucking,
uh,
pate and through that pick,

107
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.910
if he light through it,
it would have been dropped.
You know,

108
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.140
fucking Eli is the,
the,
I'm telling you,

109
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.780
I don't ever want to see that guy on the other side of the field.
Again,

110
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.160
the football gods love Eli manic

111
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.720
unless he plays the eagles.
The Eagles always played the giants tough.

112
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:33.890
There's always that one team.

113
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.230
You know there's always that one fucking Achilles' son,

114
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:38.720
but I swear to God if he like threw that ball,

115
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.680
you know that the light back of went right to him.
He would have been like,
oh,

116
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.460
I'm taking over your date and he would have dropped it and Eli would have got

117
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:50.300
there with his face all mushed into that fucking helmet and he does look at it

118
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.610
like Eli.
He looks so dumb in a helmet.

119
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:55.620
He should be was still wearing his dockers with this pads underneath it,

120
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.180
you know?
But you know,
God damn well Eli's going to go down the field.

121
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:00.560
He's going to throw a fucking ball.

122
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:03.770
Somebody is going to catch it between their helmet and [inaudible].
It's just,

123
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:07.950
it's over.
Even when he fucks up like just shit,
just it's over.

124
00:07:07.951 --> 00:07:09.290
If you cannot beat them in,

125
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.380
at some point the glass slippers got a turn back into a pumpkin.

126
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:18.980
That's my prediction this year is Eli is going to throw a pick and a big

127
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:22.940
situation and for the first time in his career somebody is actually going to

128
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:27.110
hold onto it.
That's what I'm hoping anyways.
Alright,
plowing ahead here.

129
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:30.170
So Peyton throws a pic cause he's not,

130
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:35.171
he and the football gods don't like Payton because Payton has god like numbers

131
00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:38.810
and they're intimidated by it.
They look at Eli,
they go,
oh well look at this guy.

132
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:41.390
He's got a cold or something.
I don't know what she's got.
The mumps,

133
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:45.020
what's going on with his cheeks.
So paint and throws the ball,
the fucking,

134
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.030
the browns intercepted.

135
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:53.020
There aren't like they're on the fucking on Denver's 39 yard line to tie fucking

136
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:57.320
game.
I can't remember it was overtime or not.
I had bad,

137
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.760
a bad single signal on the bus there.
Right.
And um,

138
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.470
all right,
so they're,
they're on 39 first and first and 10.

139
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:11.150
You're on the 39 yard line football fans.
How long a field goal is that?

140
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.410
Huh?
Come on dude.

141
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:18.740
A little douche bag.
Do the math.

142
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.390
Um,
he had 10 yards for the end zone.
That's 49 yards plus eight yards.

143
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:27.320
When they got to hike it,
49 and eight is 57.

144
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.730
It's a 57 Yada.
So they basically need to get,

145
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.200
they need to get a first down.
Okay.

146
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.630
Move the ball fucking forward.
So at the very least,
you know,

147
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.620
you can take a long shot at a field goal.
47 yards.

148
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:49.440
No walk in the park with these fucking kids can,
they can do it today.
Yeah.

149
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.420
Are you,
when they're little,

150
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.200
they kick in virtual reality field goals right into their flat screen TV.

151
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.190
You've seen the videos.

152
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.060
All of a sudden they sneaker comes off and breaks the TV and everybody laughs.

153
00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.570
Ha Ha Hee.
He,
what happened was throw that fucking thing.

154
00:09:02.571 --> 00:09:06.380
I'll get another $800 fucking TV.
And where does that flat screen go?

155
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.590
Why is there anybody out there that can repair a flat screen TV?

156
00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:12.440
When I was a kid,
when you had those fucking square TVs,

157
00:09:12.441 --> 00:09:15.410
it's more on the legs that weighed like 900 pounds.

158
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:21.330
Weigh heavier than a flatscreen.
Right.
Get up like a fucking flatscreens like a,

159
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:23.310
<v 0>okay.</v>

160
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.980
<v 1>Like a giant fucking iPhone,
you know,
basically relatively the weight.</v>

161
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.030
You know those old school fucking square TVs,

162
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.110
you know,
it was like,
I don't,
I don't know why they were like a safe,

163
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.820
couldn't move those fucking things.
But still we did.

164
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.530
You moved it out the door and somebody fixed it and you came back to give it a

165
00:09:42.531 --> 00:09:43.364
new tube.

166
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.580
I don't understand why you can't prepare anything nowadays.

167
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.040
Then everybody's like,
ah,
you know,
Oh,

168
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:53.700
you broke the TV and then it ends up in the fucking ocean.
Right.

169
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.690
Get the fucking thing fixed.
You can't do,
you know,

170
00:09:57.691 --> 00:10:02.220
my wife got our microwave fixed,
so excited.
I'm so excited.

171
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.840
I don't even use the microwave because a long time ago I was doing a fucking

172
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:11.640
show and one of the actors on there said,
hey,
you know,
I don't,
I don't,
you know,

173
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.540
I don't need anything out of a microwave.
I said,
Oh really?
That,
that's begin.

174
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:19.310
Why is that?
And he's like,
well,
they did an experiment where a,

175
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.280
they water these plants with water and they water these other plants of water

176
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:26.100
that had been stuck in a microwave for like a minute each day.

177
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.700
Each day they microwaved the water and uh,
there was no nutrition,

178
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:34.200
no nutrients left.
So I guess it doesn't really cause any cancer or anything,

179
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:38.100
but it just got a nuke.
Saul,
you're fucking so,
there's nothing in there.
You just,

180
00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:42.320
you're eating like space is what you're eating.
You beating,

181
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.880
someone's going to fill up the space and your stomach is what I'm trying to say.

182
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.110
Right.
Don't make any fucking sense.
I Dunno.
I have no idea.

183
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:51.840
I'm laying in a fucking bed here in Fort Wayne,
Indiana.
What do you want from me?

184
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:57.330
The creepy downtown of Fort Wayne,
Indiana.
Jesus Christ.
What do I didn't get?

185
00:10:57.331 --> 00:11:00.270
Let me get back to the game here.
So they fucking,
uh,

186
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.450
so he throws the pick and what are they do?
They got three fucking place.

187
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.420
The very least.
You're got to run three place to advance the fucking ball.

188
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.600
First play.
They lose two yards.
Now it's a 59 yards.

189
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.880
The next play they take a fucking sack for like 10 yards.

190
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.590
Now it's like a 70 yarder and then they fucking ran it like a content at the guy

191
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:23.970
just falls down.
Maybe it was two runs in a sec.
I can't remember what.

192
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:27.630
And then they got to punt the ball away.
You know what I did?

193
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.790
Cause I've watched enough football on my life.

194
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.800
I shut the fucking TV off because I rather liked that too.
The old,

195
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.580
that's the game.
It's a game right there.

196
00:11:35.581 --> 00:11:39.270
You had your fucking opportunity and you blow it.
You know,

197
00:11:39.271 --> 00:11:41.610
it's like that brought it work.
That chicken school,

198
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:44.240
you should have asked out and you didn't do it.
You know.
Hey,

199
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.600
you are years later tracking it down on fucking Facebook.
All right,

200
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.410
so over fucking over it.
Let it go.

201
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.940
Same thing with the brunch.
It's fucking over.
So anyways,
like I said,

202
00:11:56.941 --> 00:11:58.360
I'm here with downtown.
Um,

203
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.223
<v 0>okay,</v>

204
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.550
<v 1>I'm in downtown,
uh,
Fort Wayne here are going to drive down to Cincinnati and uh,</v>

205
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.850
I love it out here man.
I mean I don't like when all the crop to cut down.

206
00:12:07.851 --> 00:12:09.290
It isn't quite that time yet.

207
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.230
That's the worst when you're out here in like February and the crops are cut

208
00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.910
down right.

209
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.310
And it's overcast and overcast sky,
you know,

210
00:12:19.311 --> 00:12:21.350
cause it's so fucking flat.
You can actually look,

211
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.450
look out as you're driving down these country roads,

212
00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:27.500
you see where the overcast guide meets the ground and the crops are cut down,

213
00:12:27.501 --> 00:12:28.880
dude.
And you know,

214
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:33.910
I never understood how a band like slipknot came from fucking Iowa.

215
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:40.010
I'm like,
what the fuck are they so god damn angry about?
Yeah,

216
00:12:40.011 --> 00:12:42.680
you're already and milking cows,
you know?

217
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.330
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

218
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.480
<v 1>Meeting chicks on farmers only dotcom.
I mean,
there's a lot,
a lot to be happy,</v>

219
00:12:48.481 --> 00:12:52.890
but out here,
and when I went out there in February,
I was like,
okay,
I get it now.

220
00:12:52.891 --> 00:12:57.720
I get it.
There's nothing to fucking do out here.
Eight,
seven,
six shakes,

221
00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.690
shakes five,
right?
And all of a sudden it all starts making fence.

222
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.190
That's making fence making sense?
Um,

223
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.330
there's fucking God screen saving thing.

224
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.800
Fucking come shoot with
five seconds.
I've got to put my password.

225
00:13:15.801 --> 00:13:19.650
And why are they acting like I'm so fucking important?
I know a young counselor,

226
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.640
oh,
go into your settings and you go into your fucking settings.

227
00:13:22.641 --> 00:13:26.060
You don't look at this.
I know my fucking password is,

228
00:13:26.061 --> 00:13:27.560
I never get it right the first time.

229
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.220
Oh Jesus Christ combined.
Uh,

230
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.710
did I forget my password?
This will be fucked up,
so it'd be embarrassing.

231
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.230
Come on,
come on,
come on.
Come on one time.
One time.
Daddy needs a winner.
Right?

232
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.073
There we go.

233
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:51.490
Just click on your finder and go into the settings and hit application.

234
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.690
Um,
I about the patriots.
Beat the colts.

235
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.700
Great game.
Great game.
Andrew.
Luck's a fucking man,
dude.
The guy's a fucking man.

236
00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:06.960
I love watching that guy play.
Um,
he's not a whiner.

237
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.260
Takes his head.
So he gets back up,
he helps the guy up.
We'll hit him.

238
00:14:10.261 --> 00:14:12.840
He's just a fucking stud.
And I'm,

239
00:14:12.841 --> 00:14:15.650
I really realized that when I watched it last night that it wasn't,
I'm not,

240
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.770
I don't hate the colts.
I Hate Jerry Jerry Jones.

241
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.850
I hate gym or say I hate the fucking owner.
Um,

242
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.960
it's,
I hate a lot of their fans.
I had fun last night in Fort Wayne.

243
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.640
I was trying to get them to admit it.
I go,
come on.
You guys admit it.
Admit it.

244
00:14:32.641 --> 00:14:34.950
The lights are down.
No one can see you admitted.

245
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.590
You lost by 38 points.
All right.
It wasn't because of the air pressure.

246
00:14:40.591 --> 00:14:43.800
Come on,
be honest with yourselves.

247
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.430
Somebody said Tom Brady was gay or he's a fag or something like that know.

248
00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:53.450
And uh,

249
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.920
I just went on this whole riff about how beautiful a man Tom Brady was,

250
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.270
you know,
and how beautiful his wife was.

251
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.580
And that deep inside I was talking to the person in the crowd that they realize,

252
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:09.830
<v 0>okay,</v>

253
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.680
<v 1>that genetically
they had no hope of,</v>

254
00:15:13.681 --> 00:15:16.830
of like a woman like Jyzelle ever.

255
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

256
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.310
<v 1>Really ever seeing them for who they are.</v>

257
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.150
Like they could literally walk into the room with their head on fire and GSL

258
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.920
still wouldn't notice them.

259
00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.990
And as they watched Tom Brady marched down the field towards yet another

260
00:15:31.991 --> 00:15:34.690
championship somewhere in there and that brain,

261
00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:36.460
<v 0>okay,</v>

262
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.580
<v 1>the truth of that is,
is screaming at them</v>

263
00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.700
and went to a dark place,
whatever.

264
00:15:42.701 --> 00:15:46.690
I'm in the fucking Midwest starting to cut the crops down.
Um,

265
00:15:46.691 --> 00:15:49.240
I was at the embassy theater last night and,
uh,

266
00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.530
I actually watched this whole video on that eye level theaters that were going

267
00:15:53.531 --> 00:15:57.200
to get fucking torn down as people saved them.
That's actually,
um,

268
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:03.790
one of my soft spots as far as,
uh,
something I could get behind.

269
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.270
I actually did a Gig in Fresno and I talked to the guy and he was like,

270
00:16:07.271 --> 00:16:08.330
still trying to raise money.

271
00:16:08.331 --> 00:16:11.950
They keep that thing going and I that reminded me how I told them I was going to

272
00:16:11.951 --> 00:16:14.260
go up there,
maybe do a show or something like that.
I can't remember.

273
00:16:14.261 --> 00:16:18.430
It was in Fresno if it was the one in Bakersfield,
I don't remember.

274
00:16:18.431 --> 00:16:20.740
But they both great theaters and um,

275
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.310
I watched this whole video on it and like,

276
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:29.760
like Bob Hope had his first Mc Gig here just to the level,

277
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.980
they always have the same history.
These old theories was always like,

278
00:16:32.981 --> 00:16:36.250
it was a Vaudeville theater,
you know,

279
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:41.110
and then it became a movie theater and then,
uh,
you know,

280
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:46.740
it starts to go down and like the late fifties and sixties,

281
00:16:46.781 --> 00:16:50.260
it becomes a porno house.
And then in the 70s,

282
00:16:50.261 --> 00:16:53.170
they were going to tear it down and then somebody came in and saved the fucking

283
00:16:53.171 --> 00:16:56.470
thing and now it's awesome again.
And uh,

284
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.650
they'll embassy theater basically had that same thing.
Minus the Porno House.

285
00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:01.150
It was never a porno house,

286
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.710
which makes sense here because they don't sell booze on Sundays.

287
00:17:05.711 --> 00:17:10.570
Like all the liquor stores are closing,
only sell beer out here.
But um,

288
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.190
do they got,
they got a minor league,
whatever basketball team out here.

289
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.540
It's called the mad ants.
How fucking hilarious.
A fucking great name.

290
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.100
The Fort Wayne mad ants.
Um,
I'm a nerd for this shit.

291
00:17:24.101 --> 00:17:27.280
I love this stuff out here.
I used to have family lived out here,
you know,

292
00:17:27.281 --> 00:17:31.540
way back,
way back,
like a hundred years ago.
And they had a farm.

293
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.840
This is the,
I have this weird connection out,

294
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:38.290
even though I didn't grow up out here on my blood line is from out here.
Indiana,

295
00:17:38.291 --> 00:17:40.030
Michigan,
Ohio,
all alleged shit.

296
00:17:40.031 --> 00:17:44.950
So I have this weird connection when I come out here.
Um,
you know,

297
00:17:44.951 --> 00:17:48.340
I have family lived in Wisconsin and all these places that I'm going to select,

298
00:17:48.341 --> 00:17:53.070
they're going to,
the city was Chicago,
you know,
that was a big deal.
And,

299
00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:55.170
um,
so anyways,

300
00:17:55.171 --> 00:18:00.120
and I was hoping when I was going to go to Chicago that the fucking cops were

301
00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:02.550
going to be in the world series.
How exciting would that be?

302
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.980
How exciting would that be?
And I now look at it,
oh by the way,

303
00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:09.690
can we go back a second?
Those tow,

304
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.390
I don't understand people who thought that we were going to beat the cults by a

305
00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:16.740
thousand fucking points.
The coach made it to the AFC championship game.

306
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.310
I just don't fucking understand how people look at it.

307
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.800
And ESPN hyped it up that way.

308
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.270
And then during the game they're going like,
whoa,
what's going on here?

309
00:18:27.271 --> 00:18:30.590
Everybody thought that they were going to it.
It's like what?

310
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.930
Cause Tom Brady's dad says score fucking 60 points on them.

311
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:39.060
All of a sudden that's the line that's like watching Toronto playing Kansas
City.

312
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:44.020
They hit one walk off home,
run and flip their fucking mullets,

313
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.793
you know?

314
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.740
And do you know in all your fucking actors run in musical theater,

315
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:57.290
that attitude run where they start to run sideways looking at the crowd and then

316
00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:02.450
dude,
like the head whip and then fucking run off stage with their arms dangling

317
00:19:02.451 --> 00:19:06.530
behind them.
That's how Toronto ran the bases.
And everybody's like,
Oh shit.

318
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.630
He come the Blue Jays.

319
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.460
<v 0>Okay,</v>

320
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.740
<v 1>given Kansas City,
no respect whatsoever.</v>

321
00:19:12.741 --> 00:19:14.690
Kid just said he went to the dance last year.

322
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:19.100
They almost won the fucking world series and it comes Toronto.

323
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:24.250
These dirty filthy bird counts come waltzing in like it's a foregone conclusion

324
00:19:25.431 --> 00:19:27.320
that they go on to the world series.
And now look at you.

325
00:19:27.321 --> 00:19:30.860
You got the old right there,
Fred,
you download toe.
All.
Alright,

326
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.090
so why don't you quit flipping your fucking batch and get back to playing the

327
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:38.480
Goddamn game.
So a fan like me can enjoy a nice seven game series.

328
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:44.120
Now look at you get dumb cunt.
She got to win four out of five.
So anyways,

329
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.620
um,
I love Kansas City,
man.
I love the fucking rails.

330
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.130
It goes way back in the day when the red sox could never beat the fucking

331
00:19:52.131 --> 00:19:53.210
Yankees.
And like,

332
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.530
like three times in four years.

333
00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:03.290
Kansas City played a,
played the Yankees and the,

334
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.820
for the panel is how they used to say it,
the plane for the pattern.

335
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.870
It wasn't the ALC s back then,
it was just just for the pennant.
Right.

336
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.011
Let's just make it nice.

337
00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:16.670
You sit on the corner selling newspapers for nickel step right up,
step right up.

338
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.990
Eric strikes to read all about it.

339
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:27.340
Dodge has a new car called the Yotpo.
Um,

340
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.500
and that's the way it was 1977.
Um,

341
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.270
so they played him as 77 and 78 and lost and then they played him at 81 or play

342
00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:40.670
them an 80 and one and then lost to the Phillies in the,
uh,
in the world.

343
00:20:40.671 --> 00:20:44.930
Serious there.
Um,
so anyways,

344
00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.220
yeah,
I got this weird thing.
I like the Toronto Blue Jays.

345
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:49.990
I don't want them winning our world series.

346
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:53.140
I feel like our world series trophy belongs here in America.

347
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.690
It's one of the weird like patriotic things that I have,

348
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.640
like Toronto played the Yankees,

349
00:20:57.641 --> 00:21:00.340
I'd actually root for the Yankees as much as it would kill me.

350
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.910
But you know what the fuck do I care?
They got 27 championships,
so I give a shit.

351
00:21:03.911 --> 00:21:07.150
If they get 28 we're not catching them.
Right.
It's a foregone conclusion.

352
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.140
You know,
they went on the run,
whoever it goes on the run early on,

353
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.020
you know,
they,
they have it forever.
Fucking Montreal when you fucking win.

354
00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:20.130
And I'm like before the titanic sank and nobody's going to catch,

355
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.510
if you went on a run back then you're not getting it.

356
00:21:22.511 --> 00:21:24.730
There was like nine fucking teams and yeah,

357
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:28.660
he had to win like two to play off series.
Dude in baseball.

358
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.780
Do you know if you won the division that was winning the pennant?

359
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.570
There was no afcs,
no wildcard,
no nothing.

360
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.640
He just immediately went to the world series.

361
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:39.580
So you had to win one playoff series.
So I've got to tell you,

362
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.430
I got this weird thing with that.
Like,
you know,

363
00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:44.050
even like the Celtics when we were in one,

364
00:21:44.051 --> 00:21:48.610
like have we won 11 in a row or nine in a row,
11 and fucking,
you know,

365
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:53.050
13 years or something like that.
I mean,
come on,

366
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.190
come on.
You kidding.
That's,
that's beer league shit.

367
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.340
That's what's so amazing about the Lakers is we did that in the Lakers,

368
00:22:00.341 --> 00:22:02.490
still came and caught us.
I mean that's why I think,
you know,

369
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.940
they're the greatest fucking franchise in the modern era since 1973 and they won

370
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.040
more championships than anybody since then.

371
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.660
And as much as it fucking kills me to say that it's true,
it's fucking true.

372
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.580
Um,
day.
That devastating combination of,

373
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:24.030
of they knew how to pick talent and then when it came into the free agency era,

374
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.620
uh,
they knew how to play that game and we didn't.

375
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.280
And that hurt us.
And also Len bias,

376
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:36.550
Diane fucked us out of at least one to three championships depending on who you

377
00:22:36.551 --> 00:22:39.640
talk to,
a white God blend.

378
00:22:39.641 --> 00:22:43.000
We got Len bias in 1986 our strongest fucking team.

379
00:22:43.001 --> 00:22:47.670
And then we're going to have Len bias.
Basically Jordan light was we've,

380
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.070
I mean we will also accent.
I'm like,
oh finally I have a Celtic that can dunk,

381
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.270
you know,
cause all the Celtics fans,
as much as they didn't want to admit it,

382
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.740
it watching the showtime Lakers was so much fucking fun if they weren't playing

383
00:22:59.741 --> 00:23:01.780
the Celtics cause then you're rooting for the Celtics.

384
00:23:01.781 --> 00:23:03.820
But I used to watch them all the fun they were on TV.

385
00:23:03.821 --> 00:23:07.940
I loved watching the Lakers fucking showtime,
like it's become a man.

386
00:23:07.941 --> 00:23:12.160
And I was actually talking last night when we were on the bus hanging out and we

387
00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:15.190
were watching a,
the end of the Patriots was so fucking great man.

388
00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:19.960
We had the bus right behind the theater and the theater of hooked us up like a

389
00:23:19.961 --> 00:23:24.700
nine pack of Miller lights with the giant fucking opening,
you know,

390
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:29.320
so you can pour it down you fucking bass mouth.
And uh,

391
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.670
we were sitting in there for,
as he was finishing up a cigar outside,
right.

392
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:37.550
And we were talking about,
uh,
Barton,
it goes,
all right,
your,

393
00:23:37.551 --> 00:23:42.070
your mount Rushmore
of football coaches.

394
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:47.720
And he said Lombardi,
Chuck,
Bill Walsh,
Bill Bellacheck.

395
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:52.130
And I said the exact same thing I said,
I say,

396
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.100
except not chuck Noll.
Um,

397
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:56.330
<v 0>okay.</v>

398
00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:00.950
<v 1>And I picked a,
what's his face?
I just spaced on his fucking name.
Um,</v>

399
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:06.430
Don Cory,
L.
Eric Korey yell.

400
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:11.830
I just thought he was ahead of his fucking time and uh,

401
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:13.190
it really informed,

402
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:17.030
I think Bill Walsh coming up with the fucking a west coast offense.

403
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.160
There was nothing more exciting

404
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.510
than in the late seventies,
early eighties.

405
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:26.210
The San Diego chargers on Monday night football,

406
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.540
knowing that they were going to throw the ball on first down at you.

407
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:34.570
You don't understand what the f what a game changer that was 10 years away from

408
00:24:34.881 --> 00:24:38.420
three yards and a cloud of dust.
We just fucking ran it,
ran it,
ran it.

409
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.730
And then you just throw it if you had to,

410
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.820
which is why Johnny Unitas as fucking numbers are insane.

411
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:48.970
The fact that he threw for 41,000 yards during the fifties and sixties is

412
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.640
fucking insane.
And which is why he's always in my top three,

413
00:24:52.641 --> 00:24:57.470
four quarterbacks of all time.
But anyways to watch.
I don't know.

414
00:24:57.471 --> 00:24:59.370
I absolutely loved those guys.
Um,

415
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:00.763
<v 0>okay.</v>

416
00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.620
<v 1>I know how the fuck I got onto that thing.</v>

417
00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.570
Let me read some advertising here before.
Uh,
I completely space out here.

418
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.420
We've got a couple of new people here.
We always got new people.

419
00:25:10.421 --> 00:25:13.870
It's a revolving door here in this fucking podcast with the advertising.

420
00:25:13.871 --> 00:25:18.190
All right,
nuts.com everybody that talking about she bowls,

421
00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:23.630
important message for all the nut matures in my audience.
So Jesus,
here we go.

422
00:25:23.631 --> 00:25:27.280
If was good and you got to fucking,
I would have done all this.

423
00:25:27.281 --> 00:25:29.280
You're going to do it for me.
A why?

I'm tired this morning.
Oh,

00:30:31.251 --> 00:30:36.160
Jesus.
I'm tardy.
Alberto's Bruins.

507
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:44.210
Why am I singing the Notre Dame Song?
Oh,
that's right.
I went to the game.

508
00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:48.350
Um,
yeah,
I went to the Notre Dame game.
Everybody,
that's a bucket list thing.

509
00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:54.740
I could just,
uh,
I could just knock that right off.
Now where the fuck is all my,

510
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:58.550
my notes here?
I had all the subjects I wanted to talk about.

511
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:07.300
What the fuck is this?
Oh,
for God sakes,

512
00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:13.250
why does this,
you know what it is?
I always have 50 fucking windows open.

513
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:15.140
<v 0>Okay,</v>

514
00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.990
<v 1>let's close this one.
Let's close this one.
Look at it.</v>

515
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.640
It's a fucking enigma.
Where,
where did it go?

516
00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:29.550
Where does the window go?
Now you won't go up.
Is this it?

517
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.320
Is this it?
Come on.
There it is.
All right.
Beautiful.

518
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:39.750

I want you to Notre Dame gay man.

519
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.410
What a fucking game.
There was absolutely no defense.
And you know what?

520
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.540
I finally broke the curse.

521
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.530
I'm no longer at Jenks the home team one congratulations to Notre Dame.

522
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.760
Um,
my God,
it was crazy walking that campus.

523
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.440
It was really weird.
I walked out last time I walked that campus was like,

524
00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:03.390
I was a freshman in high school and I was out here visiting a family.

525
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.150
You know,

526
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:09.920
we went down to go look at it and I was all excited to see the stadium and uh,

527
00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.590
faking that I was actually going to get grades good enough to go there and I was

528
00:32:13.591 --> 00:32:17.130
going to go to law school and become a lawyer.
And uh,

529
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:22.920
that was like 30 fucking years ago.
The comebacks,
30 years later,

530
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:29.120
dude,
was more than 30 years ago.
It was like around 83,
84.
God,

531
00:32:29.121 --> 00:32:33.080
I'm an old motherfucker now.
It's 2015 and it come back

532
00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.940
drunk as a standup comedian

533
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.660
walking that campus,
just thinking,
what the fuck happened?

534
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.000
Just thinking all this shit that happened to me since then.

535
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.640
I remember I was walking,
you know,
hammered of course and uh,

536
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:57.000
laughing as I was walking the campus and I,

537
00:32:57.001 --> 00:32:59.110
when you kind of took a different route there,
bill it,

538
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:04.550
this family of sober people just kind of looked over at me and I was just like,

539
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.570
okay.
And I'm going down memory lane here,
a little shit face.
Cut me some slack.

540
00:33:08.571 --> 00:33:09.231
Last time I was here,

541
00:33:09.231 --> 00:33:12.950
Ronnie Reagan was still alive and he was eating jelly beans,
right?

542
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.480
Blaming everything on all the north.
Um,
all right.

543
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.080
The Jesus Christ.
What a fucking game.

544
00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:23.560
We saw a game where there was over a thousand yards offense was absolutely no

545
00:33:23.561 --> 00:33:27.310
defense.
And I gotta tell you something.
I get so fucking livid.

546
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:32.660
It fans from the other team at home games of teams that I have now,

547
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.580
I don't have a dog in the fight.
Don't give a shit.

548
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.250
There was two USC fans that would drive me nuts.

549
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:40.680
There was one Samoan look and dude I was calling him Mosey to,

550
00:33:40.681 --> 00:33:44.990
to pursue and he patriot fans.
You remember that?
He probably wasn't even Simone.

551
00:33:44.991 --> 00:33:49.340
Remember most these mousses and you'd be in the fucking end zone.

552
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.720
Oh,
ah,
Moshi.

553
00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:56.330
It's a fucking incredible player for the Patriots.

554
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.950
Like all Samoans are

555
00:33:58.760 --> 00:33:59.240
<v 0>okay.</v>

556
00:33:59.240 --> 00:33:59.900
<v 1>You know,</v>

557
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.490
USC for some reason they had the lock on some and players and they realized that

558
00:34:04.491 --> 00:34:07.370
these guys are like,
they'd like,
they're not even good players.

559
00:34:07.371 --> 00:34:08.810
They're like hall of fame players.

560
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.633
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

561
00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:12.690
<v 1>For some reason they were the only ones that were drafted.</v>

562
00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:16.450
Them are going out there and flying out and talking to their mother's lying to

563
00:34:16.451 --> 00:34:16.811
him saying,

564
00:34:16.811 --> 00:34:20.500
your kid is going to make the fucking NFL and we're going to fucking fix up your

565
00:34:20.501 --> 00:34:24.310
fucking house out here.
Whatever the fuck they tell these goddamn kids.
Um,

566
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.900
so he was doing that shit and every time you know Notre Dame first play like

567
00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:33.250
throws a fucking 70 yard bomb for a touchdown and he does that stupid thing.

568
00:34:33.251 --> 00:34:36.190
You know where your team just got scored on and then you sit there and nod and

569
00:34:36.191 --> 00:34:39.140
like,
okay,
okay,
like we can handle this,
we can handle this.

570
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:42.460
And you want to be like,
excuse me sir,
you're not on the team.

571
00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.810
What are you nodding for?

572
00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:48.610
And then there was this fucking old white guy with the most faded fucking USC

573
00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.350
jacket and hat.

574
00:34:50.351 --> 00:34:54.130
So you tell he was a fucking real fan who sat out there in the La Coliseum.

575
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:57.280
I mean it was like sun damaged clothes that he was wearing.

576
00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.040
It was just like his skin,
you know,

577
00:35:00.041 --> 00:35:03.940
white people will wear shit till it's fallen off a fucking bodies.

578
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:08.480
You know what I mean?
I'm telling you,
we're fucking,

579
00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:10.580
I dunno what we are.
We're sentimental and cheap.

580
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:14.000
We don't fucking put lotion on our faces or faces his off.

581
00:35:14.001 --> 00:35:17.510
Are All fucking sun damaged.
Skye was a mess,
man.

582
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:21.470
This guy looked like a fucking dust bowl farmer and you know,
he was from La,

583
00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:22.610
right?

584
00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:26.810
One of those Douche bags and they both bonded and they kept high fiving each

585
00:35:26.811 --> 00:35:28.730
other and they were fucking annoying me.
And I was sitting there going,

586
00:35:28.731 --> 00:35:32.630
why am I so mad that these UFC fans are USC fence?

587
00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.990
I just hate it when the other team's fans coming in and they take over the

588
00:35:37.991 --> 00:35:38.681
fucking stadium.

589
00:35:38.681 --> 00:35:42.070
But when I was psyched about who's sitting around all Notre Dame fans except for

590
00:35:42.071 --> 00:35:42.820
this one,

591
00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.900
USC Douche who showed up in the third quarter with this girlfriend wearing this

592
00:35:46.901 --> 00:35:51.640
like camel hair coat,
it almost seemed with the scarf draped over it.

593
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:56.420
And
it was just such a fuck I had,

594
00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.460
he was such a Douche.
He was such a Douche.
She had to like respect it.

595
00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.073
Um,

596
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
he just looked like that guy you were going to see on American greed when he was

597
00:36:07.001 --> 00:36:10.270
in his fifties,
just complete sociopath.

598
00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.260
Completely entitled the whole fucking thing.
Like you know,

599
00:36:14.261 --> 00:36:19.150
they have that expression.
He's a comic's comic,
you know,
a musician's musician.

600
00:36:19.151 --> 00:36:22.720
This kid we would joke and was,
he was like,
the Douche is Douche,

601
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:27.010
like Douche bags.
When we looked at him like,
oh look,
he's fucking crushing it

602
00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:32.320
at one point,
my favorite part of the game,
because you know,

603
00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:33.960
he was a USC fan of here I'm talking,

604
00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:37.990
I'll douchey and loudly and Notre Dame was down on the goal line and they stack

605
00:36:37.991 --> 00:36:42.610
like three receivers on one side and he's just like,
look at that formation.

606
00:36:42.611 --> 00:36:44.980
Why would they stick all those guys?
And then of course,

607
00:36:44.981 --> 00:36:47.620
Notre Dame runs it up the middle for a touchdown.

608
00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.840
And I just turned around and look at him.
I said,

609
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:52.900
oh it's cause it clears out the middle and it means like,

610
00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.900
oh we're not even good this year.
That's what he said.
Ugh,

611
00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:59.290
I swear to fucking choke him,
right?

612
00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:03.490
This God damn scarf and listening to him losing faith.
Like I just want to,

613
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:07.630
I like the old May.
What?
It actually got into it with them being like too,

614
00:37:07.631 --> 00:37:10.660
why are you chairing the skis?
Showed up in the fucking third quarter.

615
00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.830
But you know,
he probably had been like,

616
00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.450
oh that's because I spent the first two quarters in the press box.

617
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:18.450
<v 0>Okay,</v>

618
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:22.380
<v 1>my last name is Trojan.
My Dad owns the university,
you know,</v>

619
00:37:22.381 --> 00:37:24.960
just one of these fucking cops,
you know.
But of course,

620
00:37:24.961 --> 00:37:29.060
you know it was with the good looking girlfriend.
She does.
She's at that age.

621
00:37:29.061 --> 00:37:31.800
I know what I mean.
She's going to hit your wagon to that.
She sees what the fuck?

622
00:37:31.801 --> 00:37:36.420
An absolute sweetheart.
God,
that's got to suck,
man.
If you have a daughter,
right?

623
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:41.310
She marries a Douche,
you know the two,
first of all,
you don't want to,

624
00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.910
you don't want it to be hanging around some fucking pussy.

625
00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:47.280
How it either cause you're like,
all right,
this guy's going to cheat on her,

626
00:37:47.281 --> 00:37:50.430
break a fucking heart,
blah blah,
blah,
blah.
Give her a fucking STD.

627
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:53.520
And then you've got the other thing,
if you just marries a dose,

628
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:56.790
you know you got that weird,
the feeling where like,
okay,

629
00:37:56.791 --> 00:37:57.960
at least she'll be taken care of.

630
00:37:57.961 --> 00:38:01.800
Cause you know he has money cause he's a Dosha and doesn't care about things and

631
00:38:01.801 --> 00:38:05.910
would portion the water supply if had got them another scarf in life.
All right,

632
00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.700
so you want them to come home with like a fucking,

633
00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.610
he wanted her to come home with an hour.
They'll fucking uh,

634
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.180
I dunno with like a nice guy,
but then you meet him,

635
00:38:16.181 --> 00:38:18.470
he's a nice guy and then somewhere you're going to resent that kind of really

636
00:38:18.471 --> 00:38:23.290
like this guys to fucking nice
to really go out and make it,
you know,

637
00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.620
you just going to accept things,
you know,
and
make Pumpkin bread and

638
00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.800
I'm a fucking idiot.
All right,
let me just,
let me just plow ahead here.

639
00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.090
Let's get to the questions.
Oh,
by the,
I saw a movie on the plane ride out here,

640
00:38:37.091 --> 00:38:39.850
a movie that I wanted to see.
Uh,
there was a movie

641
00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.890
called dope that came out I think last year.

642
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.480
It's fucking brilliant.

643
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:52.180
Such a great movie and the performances in it and the way it's written,

644
00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.960
the whole thing,
wire to wire was just done

645
00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:01.680
so perfectly and it's one of the best movies I saw.

646
00:39:01.681 --> 00:39:04.740
I was riding now with my buddy,
we were on the same flight and um,

647
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:09.840
we got another passenger to switch so we would fucking hanging in drinking on

648
00:39:09.841 --> 00:39:14.430
the way out to go to this fucking game.
We just had the best fucking time.
And uh,

649
00:39:14.431 --> 00:39:17.880
I started watching that movie and within like five minutes,

650
00:39:17.881 --> 00:39:20.130
a million fucking give them the elbow go,
dude,

651
00:39:20.131 --> 00:39:23.310
you got to put this fucking movie on.
And um,

652
00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:28.140
just the whole way that they executed the thing was phenomenal.

653
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:33.510
Um,
so definitely check it out.
You like,
what's it about?
It's about,

654
00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.373
uh,

655
00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:40.720
a kid who lives in the inner city and he's not in a gang and he sucks.

656
00:39:40.771 --> 00:39:43.200
It's sports and he's a fucking nerd.

657
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.810
He's a total fucking Geek.

658
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.840
It's the kind of basically black kid that they net really never put in movies.

659
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:52.951
You know what I mean?

660
00:39:52.951 --> 00:39:57.180
Cause it's like the other two are exciting or living exciting lives.

661
00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:01.700
Like when you're in a gang,
there's life and death shit going on.
And then we,

662
00:40:01.701 --> 00:40:06.270
you know,
if you're fucking playing in sports,
you know what I mean?
That's like a,

663
00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:08.160
you know,
three,
two,
one,

664
00:40:08.161 --> 00:40:12.390
you're going to have that whole movie thing going and sad to say.

665
00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.210
Those are the two fucking kinds of like,

666
00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.160
<v 0>yeah,</v>

667
00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.470
<v 1>black guys that they put on TV,</v>

668
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.380
the gags on cops so that on TV,

669
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.920
crushing your team's hopes and dreams.
That's it.

670
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:30.990
They never show the fucking nerds that are down there that enjoyed books and

671
00:40:32.851 --> 00:40:35.910
want to go to college and want to get the fuck out of there.

672
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:40.410
So not only that,
is it an original thing like,
oh,

673
00:40:40.411 --> 00:40:43.080
this part of the city and they're going to do this.
This feels new.

674
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:48.000
It's actually socially a great thing to show there.

675
00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:51.090
I'm off my fucking tree stump.
It's a fucking great movie.
All right,

676
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:55.830
let's plow ahead here.
Um,
to the cubbies of down to,
Oh,

677
00:40:56.610 --> 00:41:01.530
Toronto is down to low.
Um,
does this weird thing that,
you know,

678
00:41:01.531 --> 00:41:04.920
if the cubs are in the world series,
um,

679
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:09.630
I'm going to be in Chicago at that time doing three nights,

680
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.700
three nights of shows.

681
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.910
And my agent was already worried going through that city is going to fucking

682
00:41:14.911 --> 00:41:19.400
shut down.
So there's a possibility we'd have to move the,
the,

683
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:23.880
the shows later,
you know,
who knows what the deal is going to be.

684
00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:28.350
We have to accommodate the people in Chicago.
So I'm like,

685
00:41:28.351 --> 00:41:31.290
I don't give a fuck,
move it,
move it later.
I don't give a shit,

686
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:35.810
I'll scalp a ticket and go to the when he goes,
all right,
done deal.

687
00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:41.330
So I actually really liked the match this year because,
uh,

688
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.560
one of the guys I work with on f is for family sweetheart of a guy's a big mets

689
00:41:45.561 --> 00:41:47.330
fan.
He's a fucking die hard mets fan.

690
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.580
And when it looked like the mets were shitting the bed,

691
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:53.510
he had this happy go lucky attitude about it going like,
you know,

692
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:56.090
cause he actually got me into it like back in August.

693
00:41:56.091 --> 00:41:59.900
I go to the mets win last night and he just laughed.
He goes,
no,
we lost again.

694
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.680
I go,
I'm sorry guys.
Yeah,
we're going to blow it.
We're going to blow it.
I go,

695
00:42:03.681 --> 00:42:06.140
you're still going to watch.
So it goes,
Yep,
you got to watch every game.

696
00:42:06.141 --> 00:42:09.010
So just seeing a true fan like that,

697
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:13.940
I kind of got me on the fucking bandwagon.
Um,
but I also love the cubs too.

698
00:42:13.941 --> 00:42:16.760
I actually,
for some reason it makes no sense as a boss of fan.

699
00:42:16.761 --> 00:42:19.790
I kind of really liked the mets too,
but I also,
you know,
the cubs,

700
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:22.400
he got to root for the cubs being a red sox fan.
Solidarity.

701
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.490
They go through a curse.
I want to see them win.
Right.

702
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:27.380
Get that monkey off the back.

703
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:31.280
As much as I can't stand people who wave hankies during fucking games,

704
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.340
I give you a pass if you're a Steelers fan,
cause they came up with it,

705
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.870
the terrible towel,
you know,
for the love of God,

706
00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:42.530
can you be a fucking sports fan and puts your hanky down,
standing up,

707
00:42:42.531 --> 00:42:47.000
waving that thing to people behind.
You can't see.
It's the playoffs.
Playoffs.

708
00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.800
People want to see it.
Um,
all right,

709
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:54.350
let's read some fucking questions here for the week.
Uh,
yeah.

710
00:42:54.351 --> 00:42:55.184
The plants come around.

711
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:58.250
All the dishes come out with the fucking noise makers in the hankies and the

712
00:42:58.251 --> 00:43:01.250
signs get out of the fucking way.

713
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:05.690
There's a reason why there's stadium seating is so the person behind you can
see,

714
00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.800
he starts standing up flailing you fucking arms around trying to get on TV.

715
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.810
The rally monkey.
All right.

716
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:19.070
Halloween movies.
Um,
hey there,

717
00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:23.690
Billy on elm street.
Um,
I would've gone with nightmare on elm street.

718
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.150
Uh,
are you into horror movies?

719
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:30.440
I've heard every podcast and I'm not sure you've ever talked about it.
Uh,

720
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.480
what movies scared you as a kid?
Uh,

721
00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:35.990
there was a movie where this fucking maniac,

722
00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:39.520
this chick was skating I bought,
I've talked to about this for,

723
00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:44.540
she was figure skating and then all of a sudden this fucking hockey playing

724
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:49.640
Jason,
they just show him skating slow motion with this big muppet shoes.

725
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.670
All right.
That was the funny thing.
They couldn't give him like,

726
00:43:52.671 --> 00:43:55.610
I don't think they gave him real skates because it would seemed to fucking

727
00:43:55.611 --> 00:43:58.790
normal.
He still had on his Frankenstein shoes with blades underneath.

728
00:43:58.791 --> 00:44:02.120
It starts fucking skating,
look like them up.
It's on ice.

729
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:07.121
But then you see as an Elica sickle starts skating towards his fucking lady and

730
00:44:07.221 --> 00:44:12.221
he pulls out the fucking does sickles and she's got this stupid chick figure

731
00:44:13.701 --> 00:44:15.380
skates right,

732
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:20.600
where you can only do that fucking scissor run.
You know what I mean?

733
00:44:20.601 --> 00:44:22.130
He can't do the fucking hockey thing.

734
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:26.810
It's so fucking hilarious to me that they gave chicks there.
You know,

735
00:44:26.811 --> 00:44:31.100
you'd figured that fact that,
especially back in the day,
you know what I mean?

736
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

737
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.340
<v 1>We're so many sexual assaults were like,</v>

738
00:44:34.341 --> 00:44:35.990
well what were you aware and you are asking for?

739
00:44:35.991 --> 00:44:38.390
And you'd figured that they'd give the women the better skates.

740
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.390
So then the fucking rape has guys would,
you know,

741
00:44:41.391 --> 00:44:45.020
would have to do that fucking figure skating scissor thing to try to catch him

742
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:48.680
as a fucking would fly up the ice and they'd get away.
You know,

743
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:54.290
it's a travesty.
That one scared me on the first night,
uh,

744
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:58.010
Friday the 13th Friday the 13th part one and two was scary.

745
00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:03.460
And then once it went into three d kind of went off the rails.
Um,

746
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.440
dark knight of the scarecrow.

747
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

748
00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:12.240
<v 1>Scared the fuck out of me.
Old School once.
Um,</v>

749
00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:13.440
<v 0>okay.</v>

750
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.030
<v 1>There was an old sesame street one that scared me when they were trying to teach</v>

751
00:45:18.031 --> 00:45:18.864
you about

752
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.010
<v 0>okay.</v>

753
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.230
<v 1>The number one or being alone or something.</v>

754
00:45:22.231 --> 00:45:24.810
They don't show it anymore cause it scared the fuck out of me.

755
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:27.780
And years later I talked to my younger brother about it and said it scared the

756
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:28.561
fuck out of him too.

757
00:45:28.561 --> 00:45:31.890
So I imagine somebody wrote to the show saying those freaking kids out,

758
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:36.510
he starts to song and he's on the piano and he's singing and it was like three

759
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:36.911
of them up.

760
00:45:36.911 --> 00:45:41.610
It's there and by the end of it he was all by himself and he was running around

761
00:45:41.611 --> 00:45:46.370
going,
hey,
where'd everybody go?
And he couldn't figure out how to get out.

762
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:49.530
It you just fucking scared as shit.
I Dunno what the fuck it was.

763
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:50.820
The age I was at,

764
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:54.450
it was dead whole thought of being alone and not near your parents.

765
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:58.260
I was just old enough to understand that I didn't know what the fuck I was
doing.

766
00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.670
I couldn't drive a car and that,
uh,

767
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:01.850
<v 0>okay.</v>

768
00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:05.100
<v 1>I'd never see anybody that I knew anymore and what the fee was like.</v>

769
00:46:05.101 --> 00:46:10.070
One of the most terrifying things.
All right,
so I went to sesame street there.
Um,

770
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:13.800
anyways,
he said,
what movie schedule is adult,

771
00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:18.180
anything you can tolerate as an adult.
My personal favorite was the almonds.

772
00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.840
What was the one where the guy fell under the ice and they were digging at the

773
00:46:21.841 --> 00:46:23.520
Isis?
He fucking went by.

774
00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:27.150
That one scared me to the Blair witch scared the shit out of me.

775
00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:28.410
I saw that by myself,

776
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:33.210
the midnight showing I totally buy him when I go to crew.
Scary movies.

777
00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.100
The ring scared the fuck out of me.

778
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:39.540
I found the American one more scarier than the,
the,
the Japanese one.

779
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.860
Um,
some of that shit over there.
The,
the audition.

780
00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:49.030
Do you ever see that one old boy?
Just see that one.

781
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:52.230
Bobby Lee told me to go see those two.

782
00:46:52.231 --> 00:46:55.560
Bobby Lee knows all about those fucking things and yes it is because he's Asian.

783
00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:58.410
And he is a movie star and you combine the two of those and he's going to give

784
00:46:58.411 --> 00:47:00.750
you some great fucking movies.
Um,

785
00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:05.200
yeah.
I,
I'm one of those guys that I buy into it.

786
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:08.830
I hate people that go to scary movies and be like,
hey movie dude.
He scare me.

787
00:47:08.831 --> 00:47:10.870
I was laughed into the whole thing.
You know,

788
00:47:10.871 --> 00:47:13.390
like all of a sudden now they're like a war hero.
It's like,
yeah,
you're right.

789
00:47:13.391 --> 00:47:16.630
A movie the whole time you've got a fucking movie.

790
00:47:16.631 --> 00:47:18.370
We just started looking around at the movie theater.
Yeah.

791
00:47:18.371 --> 00:47:20.740
You're not going to be scared,
but if you actually buy in,

792
00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:24.100
which is what you supposed to do.
Yeah.
You're fucking actually have a good time.

793
00:47:24.101 --> 00:47:28.720
You can't.
All right.
Um,
ex girlfriend hinting at possible.

794
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.600
Oh Gee.

795
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.313
<v 0>MMM.</v>

796
00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.990
<v 1>Ex-Girlfriend handing it possible reunion.
Hey Bill,
love your podcast.</v>

797
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:42.860
Even though I'm a lady and thank you.
I have no women fans.
Oh,

798
00:47:42.861 --> 00:47:47.240
I assume this was a guy.
Look at me being all heterosexual here.

799
00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:51.290
I'll just get right into it and say,
I've been having some lady problems.

800
00:47:51.291 --> 00:47:52.210
My ex girlfriend.

801
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:55.760
Do you know how bad I want to have a beer with you and talk to a fucking woman

802
00:47:55.761 --> 00:47:59.630
about women problems?
Just to hear that fucking perspective.

803
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:01.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

804
00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:05.440
<v 1>You know,
with your fucking insight,
being a woman,
you know what,</v>

805
00:48:05.441 --> 00:48:10.130
what are your moves?
How do you fucking walk through that mine field?

806
00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:14.480
She goes,
my ex girlfriend,
whom I loved for a long time.

807
00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:17.960
And you use the word whom I never know how to use that correctly.

808
00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:21.830
If anybody can send me something,
I've read it on,
you know,

809
00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:25.410
I know how to use your and your and to,

810
00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:29.830
and to t double.
Oh,
I know how to use those.
Right?

811
00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:32.690
<v 0>But uh,</v>

812
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:33.901
<v 1>uh,
who and whom?</v>

813
00:48:33.901 --> 00:48:37.890
I've always stomach my ex girlfriend whom I'm just assuming you're using it

814
00:48:37.891 --> 00:48:38.281
correctly.

815
00:48:38.281 --> 00:48:43.260
I've loved for a long time keep saying she misses me and hinting at us getting

816
00:48:43.261 --> 00:48:46.830
back together.
Even though we've been broken up for like five years.

817
00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:49.860
It's one of those relationships that never seems to die.

818
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.370
Not in the sense that we keep breaking up and getting back together.

819
00:48:53.371 --> 00:48:57.960
We've never done that,
but that we can't just be like normal friends.
There's,

820
00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:03.000
there's always some underlying romantic feelings in our interactions.
Yeah.

821
00:49:03.001 --> 00:49:06.690
It sounds like you guys had that sex vibe,
you know what I mean?

822
00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:10.050
And then you're both relationship people and next thing you know you're hanging

823
00:49:10.051 --> 00:49:10.261
out,

824
00:49:10.261 --> 00:49:13.380
you have a great sex and then the next thing you know you're in a relationship.

825
00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:15.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

826
00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:17.320
<v 1>And then you really realize like,
you know,</v>

827
00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:20.140
we just sort of fucked each other's brains out.
But other than that,

828
00:49:20.141 --> 00:49:23.650
there was nothing else there.
But then when every time you run into each other,

829
00:49:23.651 --> 00:49:25.530
there's still that a,
we could,
uh,

830
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.860
go fuck each other's brains are that you could fuse for the spark of love,

831
00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:33.610
sort of guessing so far anyways,
in case you're not familiar with it.

832
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:36.190
This is typical lesbian drama.

833
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

834
00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:41.050
<v 1>I didn't realize that,
but it makes sense.
She got the same hardware.</v>

835
00:49:41.051 --> 00:49:44.320
You know how the engine runs.
Like she would probably,

836
00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:49.010
I would think that you guys were all fucking crushing it out there.
Right.

837
00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:53.930
Anyways,
it's widely believed that we just can't let go.

838
00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.840
She had a girlfriend up until a few days ago,

839
00:49:56.841 --> 00:50:00.690
but kept flirting with me even when they broke up.
Well,

840
00:50:00.691 --> 00:50:03.970
she's a piece of shit that you can't get with her.
He can't,

841
00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.230
he's just fucking around with this up broad right now.

842
00:50:06.231 --> 00:50:07.730
She keeps saying stuff like,

843
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:12.380
what do you think it's going to be like when we're old and married?
Oh God,

844
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:13.920
<v 0>yeah.</v>

845
00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.560
<v 1>And then she goes,
oh,
I forgot you don't.
Oh,
she goes,
oh,
and I forgot.</v>

846
00:50:17.561 --> 00:50:20.740
You don't want to get married.
I'm okay with us just living together.

847
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:22.840
I don't know if she's kidding or what.

848
00:50:22.841 --> 00:50:27.100
So I just tried to dodge it by saying stuff like,
I dunno,
maybe I'll be dead by.

849
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:30.860
Yeah,
exactly.
She's getting in your fucking head.
I need to confirm.
No,

850
00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:34.490
reject the idea of us getting back together.
I just let her run with it.

851
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:38.450
I'm not even sure why she's doing this.
Um,

852
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:43.760
she wants to talk to me all the time now and I'm thinking maybe she's needy and

853
00:50:43.761 --> 00:50:47.180
has been and has been for some time since the relationship wasn't going that

854
00:50:47.181 --> 00:50:48.170
well.
That's what I would guess.

855
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.950
And I'm just a safe target for her to throw her emotions out and get something

856
00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:55.010
back.
There you go.
There you go.
I agree with all of that.

857
00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:59.000
But then she talked about how she will never love anyone as much as she loved
me.

858
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:03.810
And when I asked her if she still loves me,
she said yes.
Uh,

859
00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:08.610
you know what?
Can I ask you a question?
Do you love her?
We think of,

860
00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:11.720
were you even thinking about this broad until she got back into your fucking

861
00:51:11.721 --> 00:51:16.320
life?
She's going to fucking turn you all around,
Huh?
God,

862
00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:17.360
let me read the rest of this,

863
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:21.380
but I don't know what kind of love and what she wants with me.

864
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.420
If she's serious or just having fun.

865
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:26.090
I'm not going to say I've never thought about it,

866
00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:29.660
but I'm not sure if I'd ever go back to that relationship.

867
00:51:29.661 --> 00:51:33.170
We broke up for a reason and even though there's still something there,

868
00:51:33.171 --> 00:51:36.170
it seems like a huge step backward in a way.
Well,
there's your answer.

869
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:40.730
What the hell does she want bill?
She wants you to fucking clamp.

870
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:45.170
She wants to nuzzle up next year and have somebody watch a movie with and fucked

871
00:51:45.171 --> 00:51:48.140
around with again so she can fucking drive you nuts.

872
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:51.530
And he got to go through the emotional drama again and why now?

873
00:51:51.531 --> 00:51:54.320
You're already answered the question cause she's recently single and she's

874
00:51:54.321 --> 00:51:55.820
lonely.
Thanks for your time.

875
00:51:55.821 --> 00:52:00.800
When you freak podcast a lesbophobic grandmother.

876
00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.910
Oh that's the next question I thought I'd tell you.
You signed it.
I'm like,

877
00:52:04.911 --> 00:52:08.330
wait a minute.
Your grandmother and your afraid of lesbians,
you are a lesbian.

878
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:12.920
What are the odds that was going to be the next one?
Sorry about that.
Um,

879
00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:18.260
I would say a yeah,
I would not get back involved with her.
Fuck that.

880
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:23.330
Fuck that.
You still young.
Go get yourself some hot piece.

881
00:52:23.331 --> 00:52:27.440
That fucking is into you so it can be exciting and new.

882
00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:32.000
Come aboard.
Were two lesbians.

883
00:52:32.001 --> 00:52:36.680
Let's hang out
and we're our shack.

884
00:52:36.681 --> 00:52:41.090
It's two gether please.
Um,
yeah,
that's what I would do.
I would move on.

885
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.320
Oh,
what she wants to now because she's recently single fuck that.

886
00:52:45.321 --> 00:52:49.460
She's using you all right.
You better than that.
You're better than that.

887
00:52:49.461 --> 00:52:53.000
Fuck that.
And don't give in to the fact,
you know,

888
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.140
just the way this whole thing is written.
I feel like you're alone,

889
00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:00.020
you're a better person and that you actually have more genuine feelings.

890
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:01.431
You know what I mean?

891
00:53:01.431 --> 00:53:04.280
Which means you're going to be more vulnerable and easier prey.

892
00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:06.410
And I think she's coming in,
you know,

893
00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:11.210
she's basically the lesbian version of the dude that sat behind me during the

894
00:53:11.211 --> 00:53:16.040
USC game.
The douche is Douche.
She's like the lesbians content,

895
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:18.370
you know?
Does that make any sense?
It probably doesn't,

896
00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:21.410
but I'm looking out for year.
I would say do not get back together with them.

897
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:23.930
All right.
Especially over the holidays.

898
00:53:23.931 --> 00:53:28.260
You know that Wednesday before Thanksgiving when you just want to go out and go

899
00:53:28.261 --> 00:53:31.950
to that place,
you know basically the lesbian chairs,

900
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:37.020
sometimes you are to go right where everybody knows your name and she's going to

901
00:53:37.021 --> 00:53:39.630
be sitting in there drinking some sort of pumpkin beer.

902
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.770
You know it comes walking up to you wearing or Dickie ca.

903
00:53:43.771 --> 00:53:48.400
You don't need that shit.
Fuck that.
Go talk to that.
Younger hottie in the sun,

904
00:53:48.401 --> 00:53:52.110
dress to yourself.
Treat yourself this holiday season.

905
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:55.680
Get yourself a younger hardy in a sundress.
All right.

906
00:53:55.681 --> 00:54:00.360
Lesbophobic grandmother a dear Billy Ball buster.

907
00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:03.390
Before I get to what I want to talk about,

908
00:54:03.391 --> 00:54:08.391
I just want to say that I'm a big dude and user ever inspired me to lose weight.

909
00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:10.230
Goodman's since April 3rd,

910
00:54:10.231 --> 00:54:14.760
I've been working out almost everyday and have lost 35 pounds.

911
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.490
So thank you for that bill.
You're a legend dude.
You're a legend.

912
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:22.380
That's fucking tremendous switch.
You got to do,
go to the gym every day.

913
00:54:22.381 --> 00:54:27.090
My big thing is,
I'm on the road for two weeks here,
so you know,
um,

914
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.290
I've actually stayed on my gym schedule.
I went to the gym the first day,

915
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:34.470
second day was my day off,
and now the next three days in a row,

916
00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:37.260
I do three on one day off.
So,
uh,

917
00:54:37.261 --> 00:54:39.570
I'm doing my podcast and we're driving down to Cincinnati.

918
00:54:39.571 --> 00:54:43.800
Just want to get to Cincinnati.
Um,
you know,
it's not a long drive,

919
00:54:43.801 --> 00:54:46.830
so I'm going to,
I'm going to do the old treadmill.

920
00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:50.490
Hopefully they'll have a pull up bar or something there.
Um,

921
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.370
so I can do my pull ups and that type of Shit.
Um,

922
00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:56.660
cause I have a bet with Paul Versey that when I'm 70,

923
00:54:56.661 --> 00:54:58.530
I'll be able to do 10 of those fucking things.

924
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.330
I was actually thinking the other day,

925
00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:06.290
if I can pat myself on the back as I was on my peg board in my garage,

926
00:55:06.421 --> 00:55:10.050
which I have the long skinny one that actually hung sideways.

927
00:55:10.051 --> 00:55:14.130
So I just go along the thing sideways because you know,
you need like fucking,

928
00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:19.110
you need like a fucking,
you know,
10,
10 foot ceiling,

929
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:23.160
probably 11 with the size of my head to go up a peg board and have the head room

930
00:55:23.161 --> 00:55:26.850
to get up to the top.
And I didn't want to hang it lower and start,
you know,

931
00:55:26.851 --> 00:55:30.840
with my fucking basically on my knees for,
for whatever reason,

932
00:55:30.841 --> 00:55:33.210
I didn't want to do that.
Um,

933
00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:36.960
and I was going across the peg board and I was actually thinking at some point

934
00:55:36.961 --> 00:55:41.010
going through it,
I'm 47 years old going across the peg board at some point.

935
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:45.240
I got to be impressed.
That's pretty impressive.
Um,

936
00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:47.790
and after Bert Kreischer gave me that,

937
00:55:47.791 --> 00:55:52.320
that men's health thing do Cretia grip strength that really helped me on the

938
00:55:52.321 --> 00:55:56.740
fucking pegboard.
Um,
and also my technique I held,
you know,

939
00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.490
when you hold it,
you got to have your,
your basic,

940
00:55:59.491 --> 00:56:03.000
your forums almost touching your bicep and you've got to have it and then the

941
00:56:03.001 --> 00:56:07.710
rest of your arms basically right on your side.
He got to get in close.
Um,

942
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.710
so you got more leverage.
I was almost,

943
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:15.150
I had my arm too far away from my chest and I couldn't do it.
Um,
so anyways,

944
00:56:15.151 --> 00:56:16.500
he goes a few years back.

945
00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:21.060
My parents got divorced after 17 years of a bad marriage.

946
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:25.530
We'll put the final nail in the was my mother's secret relationship with another

947
00:56:25.531 --> 00:56:30.531
lady who is now her girlfriend who I'll call Kate for the sake of this email.

948
00:56:31.291 --> 00:56:34.660
Kate with a k not with a c,
like all Bruce there.

949
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:38.580
She has since moved in with us,
which sounds weird,
but my brother,

950
00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:43.200
sister and I all have a great relationship with Kate.
Um,

951
00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:47.310
also I wasn't,
it wasn't just something my,
Oh my God.

952
00:56:47.311 --> 00:56:51.570
Can you imagine that poor bastard?
What a mind fuck that is,

953
00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:56.210
dude.
If you're in a relationship,
okay.

954
00:56:56.870 --> 00:57:00.860
And it ends and it turns out the other person's gay.
I mean,

955
00:57:00.861 --> 00:57:03.620
you have to be sitting there going,
this person never loved me.

956
00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:05.260
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

957
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:08.650
<v 1>I just wasted my fucking life.</v>

958
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.810
And then on top of that,

959
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:16.730
your family bonds with the new fucking lover.

960
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:23.800
That's just a double mind fuck.
Like,
is there any sympathy from me?

961
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:28.120
What the fuck I'm going through?
I legitimately love this fucking woman.

962
00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:32.320
Wow.
Anyway,
she's since moved in with us,
which sounds weird.

963
00:57:32.321 --> 00:57:36.010
My brother's a citizen.
I have a great relationship with Kay.
Well,
that's,
I mean,

964
00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.660
yeah,
that's good.
That's actually progressive also.

965
00:57:38.661 --> 00:57:43.110
It wasn't just something my mom,
uh,
also,

966
00:57:43.111 --> 00:57:47.400
it wasn't just something my mom just drove into.
In spite of my dad.

967
00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:51.330
My mom and Kate really do love each other and they have three strong years

968
00:57:51.331 --> 00:57:56.040
together.
To back that up,
dude,
you got any sympathy for your dad?
Uh,

969
00:57:56.041 --> 00:57:56.940
here's the problem.

970
00:57:56.941 --> 00:58:01.500
My grandmother has grown farther and farther apart from your mother ever since

971
00:58:01.501 --> 00:58:06.300
she turned the lesbian turn lesbian.
They'll do.
She always,
she was always there.

972
00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:12.150
Uh,
she pretty much hates cake too,
by the way.
You can't turn gay.
You're gay.

973
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.560
You know what I mean?
You just,
you,
she fucking gay.

974
00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:22.340
It's like,
did you turn heterosexual?
Was it a decision you made?
You know,

975
00:58:22.341 --> 00:58:26.400
it's like four or five fucking years of age.
The first time.

976
00:58:26.401 --> 00:58:27.570
That's the first time I remember.

977
00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:29.060
<v 0>Okay.</v>

978
00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:32.180
<v 1>I always tell this fucking story.
Whenever somebody says turned gay,</v>

979
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:35.540
it's like you are what you,
I remember I was laying on the floor.

980
00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:37.280
They're this giant rug.

981
00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:42.230
When I was in kindergarten and this girl asked to get up and go to the bathroom,

982
00:58:42.231 --> 00:58:45.170
she could go to the bathroom and I was laying there playing with some fucking

983
00:58:45.171 --> 00:58:49.070
toy,
you know,
holding it up like a little kid does.
And she,

984
00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:50.180
she walked by me,

985
00:58:50.181 --> 00:58:54.680
she walked by close enough that I could see up her skirt to see her five year

986
00:58:54.681 --> 00:58:58.490
old side,
which sounds weird,
but I was five,
so I was crushing it.
Right.

987
00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:01.460
And when I saw it,
you know,

988
00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:04.310
I felt like this fucking jolt in my heart.

989
00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:09.080
And I remember I sat up and I just turned around and stared at her and she

990
00:59:09.081 --> 00:59:12.350
walked out like,
what the fuck was that?
You know,

991
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:16.520
this wasn't a decision made.
So I imagine if you were gay,

992
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:22.570
right,
am I really going to talk about five year old balls?
I can't do that.
Um,

993
00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:24.030
yeah,
it's basically the same thing.

994
00:59:24.031 --> 00:59:26.910
But to say that you turn gay would mean that you also turn heterosexual,

995
00:59:26.911 --> 00:59:29.520
which means at some point you were sitting there and you know,

996
00:59:29.521 --> 00:59:32.580
metaphorically or hypothetically,
whatever the proper word is,

997
00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:36.210
there was a deck and a pussy on the table and you will go and eeny meeny miny

998
00:59:36.211 --> 00:59:39.660
let's see,
what are we going to choose here?
Let's weigh the options.
You didn't,

999
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:43.980
you would just straight.
All right.
Anyways,

1000
00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:47.910
so she pretty much hates Kate and she believes she has perverted my mom.

1001
00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:49.140
Uh,

1002
00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:52.800
she won't even so much as come over for a meal and I can barely mentioned Kate

1003
00:59:52.801 --> 00:59:56.460
around her mind.
You by grandmother lives only nine houses down from us.

1004
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:57.600
Here's my question,

1005
00:59:57.601 --> 01:00:00.330
is there any way to make my grandmother more accepting of my mother,

1006
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:01.650
my mother and Kate.

1007
01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:05.760
Her option hasn't budged in three years and I'd love for her to at least be

1008
01:00:05.761 --> 01:00:09.840
cordial.
You're infinite and hilarious.
Wisdom will be greatly appreciated.

1009
01:00:09.841 --> 01:00:12.840
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
Um,

1010
01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.113
<v 0>no,</v>

1011
01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:19.850
<v 1>I'm sorry.
I usually offer a ray of light.
There isn't,</v>

1012
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:22.061
there isn't.

1013
01:00:22.061 --> 01:00:24.730
This is going to be one of these deathbed thinks that she's going to have to

1014
01:00:24.731 --> 01:00:29.680
fucking through there just there isn't a,
when somebody feels that way,

1015
01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.260
feels that strongly.
Um,

1016
01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.350
all I can say is just keep inviting her to stuff.

1017
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:39.200
Maybe eventually she'll come around.

1018
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:42.050
I was surprised that in all of this she didn't have any,

1019
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:46.240
nothing about your dad and the shit that he had to go through them.

1020
01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:50.950
It's fucking unbelievable.
You know,
they actually did an article about that,

1021
01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:55.660
you know,
when,
when Bruce became Kate,
you know,
and they will go,

1022
01:00:55.661 --> 01:00:58.270
oh my God,
isn't this amazing?
This is fucking,
you know,

1023
01:00:58.271 --> 01:01:01.870
and then fourth line gets the 4th of July because everybody was so afraid to be

1024
01:01:01.871 --> 01:01:04.480
on the wrong side of that issue.
Then all of a sudden,
you know,

1025
01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:07.510
they'd lose their advertising and then they couldn't make their mortgages.

1026
01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:11.980
That's what most of that reaction was about,
I felt was about,
you know,

1027
01:01:11.981 --> 01:01:16.570
cover your ass.
Let's get out in front of this story and show how much we,
uh,

1028
01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:22.420
you know,
we are accepting of this or like pieces of shit.
Espn,

1029
01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:27.580
let's ignore a woman dying of cancer who splits still playing basketball and

1030
01:01:27.581 --> 01:01:31.750
let's make fucking Kate the sportsman of the year so that we get the exclusive

1031
01:01:31.751 --> 01:01:35.840
interview with her fucking pieces of shit.
Um,

1032
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:41.330
anyways,
the fuck am I going with this slight,

1033
01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:46.331
they actually did this article and informed article on it that wasn't homophobic

1034
01:01:47.421 --> 01:01:52.421
but actually talked about the people that were married and the depression and

1035
01:01:53.571 --> 01:01:58.070
devastation that they go through.
Cause they,
you know,

1036
01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:03.380
they lose that person.
You know what I mean?
Like Bruce Jenner has got,

1037
01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:08.180
and if you loved Bruce,
do you want to fucking relationship,
you know,
with them.

1038
01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:12.640
Mike,
his wife was,
I mean,
all of a sudden,

1039
01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:15.350
poof,
just fucking Dessy bad.
If you go to a fucking do,

1040
01:02:15.351 --> 01:02:18.390
it's almost like they died.
So,
I mean,

1041
01:02:18.391 --> 01:02:20.690
there is a crazy thing there.

1042
01:02:20.691 --> 01:02:24.980
Or if he ever relationship where all of a sudden there's nothing more

1043
01:02:24.981 --> 01:02:26.660
definitive.
I think that if you,

1044
01:02:26.661 --> 01:02:29.990
your partner never fucking loved you the way you love them.

1045
01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:34.940
If not only do you go through a divorce that they then you find out that the

1046
01:02:34.941 --> 01:02:38.690
whole time that they were gay.
So it's just like,
I would be going like,
oh my God.

1047
01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:41.540
So as I like grossing you out,
every time we had sex,

1048
01:02:41.541 --> 01:02:43.310
I would be fucking devastated.

1049
01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:47.000
So I was a little surprised he got nothing in there about your dad.
I mean,

1050
01:02:47.001 --> 01:02:51.500
he must be like,
ah,
fucker.
He,
he cause he crushing it.

1051
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:54.590
Maybe he's got some fucking young chick on the side.
I have no idea.

1052
01:02:54.591 --> 01:02:57.920
But I'm getting away from the,
uh,
the thing here.
Um,

1053
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.280
I would say no,
there's,

1054
01:03:01.281 --> 01:03:05.960
there's no way when somebody is that walled off and you know,

1055
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:07.290
<v 0>okay,</v>

1056
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:10.680
<v 1>on one level you just gotta be accepting of your grandmother that like,</v>

1057
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:16.040
she grew up in a different time in her child brain was filled up with this shit.

1058
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.370
And you know,
it's,
it's fucking atrophy in there.

1059
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:21.490
There's nothing you can do about it.
But yeah.

1060
01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:23.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1061
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.250
<v 1>I Dunno,
just keep coming over the,
I,
you know what I would do,</v>

1062
01:03:26.251 --> 01:03:27.570
I would openly joking.

1063
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:32.160
I would openly joke about it in front of her to loosen her up.

1064
01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.370
You know,
that's what I would do.

1065
01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:39.730
I just remembered when we remember that guy,

1066
01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:44.620
that old guy that lived beneath me last time when I had the apartment way back

1067
01:03:44.621 --> 01:03:48.220
in the day and you still always yell at my wife through the floors and he was a

1068
01:03:48.221 --> 01:03:51.550
fucking asshole.
We just started being overly nice to them.

1069
01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.820
My wife started whistling and Adam,

1070
01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:58.480
Mikey was a good looking guy and we fucking basically wore the guy down and at

1071
01:03:58.481 --> 01:04:00.540
some point,
you know,
you know,

1072
01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:05.140
before the dementia set in and he totally went fucking crazy.
You,

1073
01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:08.230
I was standing on the fucking porch,
but just a tee shirt on.

1074
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:09.760
That was a hell of a site.

1075
01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.960
I would just openly joke about it.
Um,

1076
01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:23.050
I would just be like,
uh,
I would start calling her Kate that you hate.

1077
01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:26.140
That's what I would do.
Hey my mom and Kate that you,
hey,

1078
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:30.960
that's going down to the store.
Hey,
you know Katie that you,
Haiti.
Yeah,

1079
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:31.800
they're going,

1080
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.090
they're going to go to the movies still probably holding the hands right now.

1081
01:04:34.091 --> 01:04:38.740
Grandma,
they're holding a heads grandma.
Like I would just do that.

1082
01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:40.190
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1083
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:42.470
<v 1>I'd be like,
come on grandma.
There was never one,
you know?</v>

1084
01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1085
01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:48.190
<v 1>You never had one half a second gay moment,
you know,</v>

1086
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.330
it was just one girl.
I don't know what she did.

1087
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:55.610
You just admiring her beauty and yet,
I don't know,

1088
01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:59.470
maybe just wanted to kiss her on her shoulder and just try to grow surround,

1089
01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:04.420
which is really,
I've just,
I would,
I would,
I would break a balls about it

1090
01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:07.980
every time I saw him.

1091
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:10.530
I would do that in the beginning and then I would talk to her about whatever I

1092
01:05:10.531 --> 01:05:13.020
want to talk about.
That's what I would do and see if he could,

1093
01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:17.820
and then I would tell Kate that that's what I'm doing.
And then when Kate there,

1094
01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:24.040
I'd be like,
grandma,
there's Kate.
Thank you.
Hey.
Oh,
Haiti Katie's.

1095
01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:27.060
There she is.
Look at her,
you know,
as much as you hate her,

1096
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:31.350
you got to admit this is a hell of a meatloaf sandwich.
Granted,
you're not.

1097
01:05:31.351 --> 01:05:33.690
You don't want to know where this fit those fingers where when you were,

1098
01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:36.360
she was making it.
Don't,
don't take it that far.
I'm sorry.

1099
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:39.420
Had to get out of it with a joke.
Um,
all right.

1100
01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:40.910
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1101
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:45.260
<v 1>Girlfriend.
Uh,
fuck the yoga instructor.
Hey,</v>

1102
01:05:45.261 --> 01:05:49.010
old Billy bald tits.
How the fuck are you a,

1103
01:05:49.011 --> 01:05:51.110
I'm writing you because I need some advice.

1104
01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.500
I just recently found out my girlfriend of two years is done.

1105
01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:55.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1106
01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.380
<v 1>Some fucked up shit.
Up until now.
I thought she was marriage material.</v>

1107
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:03.200
She's not like the Kardashian wannabes up today.

1108
01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:07.100
She and I have so much in common and we always laugh and I love hanging out with

1109
01:06:07.101 --> 01:06:10.220
their no red lights.
Hey,
even no red flags.

1110
01:06:10.221 --> 01:06:13.700
You mean I've been triggered until now.
Uh,

1111
01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:15.320
she doesn't drink like crazy.

1112
01:06:15.321 --> 01:06:19.940
She doesn't take off her heels and walk home or he's not a quitter.

1113
01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.070
Overall,
she's awesome.

1114
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:27.200
But recently I found out from a mutual friend that before she met me,

1115
01:06:27.201 --> 01:06:29.930
she had a secret affair with her yoga instructor.

1116
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:32.860
And that's not even the fucked up part.

1117
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:37.160
The Yoga instructor is also her best friend's Dad.

1118
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.930
What?
Okay are best friend's dad and she never told her best friend.

1119
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:47.520
Oh my God.

1120
01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:54.450
So that Yoga instructor fucked his daughter's best friend though dad is such

1121
01:06:56.111 --> 01:06:58.210
yoga instructor behavior.

1122
01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:00.280
<v 0>Okay Dude,</v>

1123
01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.430
<v 1>I'm telling you right now and another fucking life I would have been a yoga</v>

1124
01:07:03.431 --> 01:07:07.840
instructor to those guys.
Fucking crush it.
Like nobody,

1125
01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:14.260
dude,
hot chicks,
they all fucking do yoga,
right?
Cause they want to stay in shape,

1126
01:07:14.261 --> 01:07:16.060
but they don't want to get all fucking bulked up.

1127
01:07:16.061 --> 01:07:18.460
They want to keep that senior we tight muscle,
right?

1128
01:07:18.461 --> 01:07:21.790
They want to be all tone but still look good in a fucking dress,
right?

1129
01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:23.590
So he keeps like the Pied Piper.

1130
01:07:23.591 --> 01:07:27.340
They just come to you and you get them all stretched out before you fuck them.

1131
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.060
And then you can have your whole new agey,
blah blah blah.
Dude,

1132
01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:34.540
I'll tell you right now,
take a yoga fucking class one time in your life.

1133
01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.870
And you know who the yoga instructor wants to bag.

1134
01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:41.740
It's the one they always go over and they adjust them and they put their hands

1135
01:07:41.741 --> 01:07:45.790
on them,
you know?
You know what I mean?
They get the f the,

1136
01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:49.200
the woman gets to feel their fucking touched and they're all fucking open

1137
01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.160
because they're fucking in this headspace.

1138
01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:55.950
Like the whole for the fucking vibe is,
it's,
it's a layup.
You know,
it's funny,

1139
01:07:55.951 --> 01:07:59.370
I just take this fucking yoga class and this guy was like crushing it.

1140
01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:03.000
And for some reason I was always doing the positions correctly.

1141
01:08:03.030 --> 01:08:04.410
He never had to adjust me,

1142
01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:08.910
but the fucking chick next to me who was already totally stretched could put a

1143
01:08:08.911 --> 01:08:10.920
foot up her own goddamn clamp for some reason.

1144
01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:14.920
He always had to fucking adjust her.
Their Spaghetti straps.
Uh,

1145
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:21.200
fucking hilarious.
Ah,
you got to love a piece of shit.
Yoga instructor.

1146
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:22.690
I fucking,
oh,

1147
01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:26.210
there's such dirt bags and the whole time that talking about all this new agey

1148
01:08:26.211 --> 01:08:30.110
stuff,
you know,
just be man,
he can't fight it.
You know,

1149
01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:33.440
just fucking give into my Dick.
Um,
anyways,

1150
01:08:33.441 --> 01:08:38.441
he said they fucked for a few months before she met me and came clean to telling

1151
01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:44.870
me,
uh,
that it was true,
but she regrets it.

1152
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:48.740
What the fuck do I do?
I'm Young,
I'm only 22,

1153
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:52.160
but I feel like I have really found some someone in her,

1154
01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:56.150
but I feel like I can't trust someone who would be that deceitful.

1155
01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.350
Should I move on or assume something like this won't happen in the future.

1156
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:02.930
Thanks a million and as always go fuck yourself.
Well,

1157
01:09:02.931 --> 01:09:04.520
those are two really great questions.

1158
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:06.743
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1159
01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.620
<v 1>You know,
in defense of her,</v>

1160
01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:16.910
she's really young and I'm assuming that fucking guys,

1161
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:21.630
at least in his forties and what he did was barely legal.

1162
01:09:22.230 --> 01:09:23.520
You know,
dude,

1163
01:09:23.521 --> 01:09:28.521
that guy fucking spit 20 years a game at her door in a yoga class.

1164
01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:30.840
I mean,
it's a fucking layup.

1165
01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.010
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1166
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:37.860
<v 1>But also
she did fuck a guy.</v>

1167
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:42.360
She did fuck her friend's Dad.
So,

1168
01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:44.390
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1169
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:47.180
<v 1>if she's the way that you say what she's this really wholesome,</v>

1170
01:09:47.181 --> 01:09:49.730
innocent type person,
those people are also,
you know,

1171
01:09:49.731 --> 01:09:52.550
the kinds of people that ended up in the trunk of serial killers,
cars.

1172
01:09:52.551 --> 01:09:56.630
I hate to say it because they are so fucking innocent and that type of shit.

1173
01:09:56.631 --> 01:10:00.410
So you know,
this guy's basically Jason,

1174
01:10:00.411 --> 01:10:03.050
except instead of an axes use in his dick.
I mean that's just fuck.

1175
01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:07.270
That's fucking,
oh my God,

1176
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:12.380
I can't imagine doing that.
I can't fucking up.

1177
01:10:12.381 --> 01:10:16.930
Can you imagine
right after you bust a nut in your,

1178
01:10:16.931 --> 01:10:20.420
you're thinking clearly again,
what the fuck you just did.

1179
01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:26.370
And you know,
women are so fucking emotional,
right?
Jesus Christ like,

1180
01:10:26.371 --> 01:10:29.880
and they just have to talk.
You'd never rob a bank with a woman.
I mean,

1181
01:10:29.881 --> 01:10:33.840
you caught before it's even started and then you do something like that.

1182
01:10:33.841 --> 01:10:36.770
And then I'm like,
God,
I feel so bad.
I said about Gal.

1183
01:10:36.771 --> 01:10:40.080
And she goes down and as a couple of fucking lady drinks and the whole fucking

1184
01:10:40.081 --> 01:10:43.280
town knows,
oh my God.

1185
01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:45.200
Then your daughter hates going to hate you for life.

1186
01:10:45.201 --> 01:10:48.200
You're marriage is fucking over.
I'm like,
Jesus fucking Christ.

1187
01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:50.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1188
01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.470
<v 1>Jeez,
that guy,
my gig minds are stuck.
His Dick in a beehive</v>

1189
01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:59.060
son of a bitch got away with it because he's a fucking yoga instructor man.
Um,

1190
01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:01.500
<v 0>okay.</v>

1191
01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.370
<v 1>Yeah.
I don't know.</v>

1192
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.120
I would just really come clean to her and I would just sit down and say,
listen.

1193
01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:08.553
<v 0>MMM,</v>

1194
01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:13.000
<v 1>just tell her all these great things that you feel about her.
But the,</v>

1195
01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:19.600
the fact that she did it did that

1196
01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:25.570
you just need to talk about it more.
Like just ask a walkup were way to it.

1197
01:11:25.571 --> 01:11:27.370
Like why do you think you did that?

1198
01:11:28.090 --> 01:11:32.770
Just don't accuser don't be like,
don't be having an accusatory tone.

1199
01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.240
Don't be judging her even though you are.
Um,

1200
01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:40.570
I think the jury's still out on that because she's so fucking young and that

1201
01:11:40.571 --> 01:11:44.220
piece of shit is so fucking old.
Um,

1202
01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:47.200
he really took advantage of her.
I don't give,
I know it's fucking legal,

1203
01:11:47.201 --> 01:11:49.450
but to me in my head like,
yeah,

1204
01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:53.860
you're a fucking pervert if you do something like that.
Yeah.
I'm judging the guy.

1205
01:11:53.861 --> 01:11:56.940
I mean,
she loves was 21,
22 when he did it.
But that,

1206
01:11:57.010 --> 01:11:58.390
that that's not fucking right.

1207
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:00.340
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1208
01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:03.680
<v 1>that's,
that's not fucking right.
You know,
um,</v>

1209
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:07.970
Jesus fucking Christ.

1210
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:10.230
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1211
01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:14.700
<v 1>I've seen pornos with a more wholesome storyline than that,
you know?
Uh,
no.</v>

1212
01:12:14.701 --> 01:12:17.670
I would just ask her about it and just to,
why you,
why you do that?

1213
01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:20.940
What did you do that,
why,
why do you think that you did it?

1214
01:12:20.941 --> 01:12:25.470
I would help her get through it in a therapy way and just by her answers,
if,

1215
01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:28.830
uh,
you know,
if that's like what she's into,

1216
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:34.800
then I would have some concerns that she would act out again.

1217
01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:39.000
Um,
I dunno,
I,
I,
but I,

1218
01:12:39.001 --> 01:12:41.250
but if you love her,

1219
01:12:41.251 --> 01:12:45.240
you really got to sit down in a non judge judgment away.
And by the way,
dude,

1220
01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:49.050
you telling me you haven't stuck your Dick in someplace that would give her a

1221
01:12:49.051 --> 01:12:53.250
little bit,
some fucking red flags.
You never did anything filthy,
you know?

1222
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.943
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1223
01:12:56.010 --> 01:13:00.150
<v 1>I mean,
I'm assuming you did.
Why don't you be fair and kind of,</v>

1224
01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:04.480
it's this weird thing where like,
you should be before you marry somebody,
you,

1225
01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:08.050
you have to,
you got to judge them.

1226
01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.120
You don't just walk into it blindly.

1227
01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:14.950
You're agreeing to spend your life with somebody.
You got to judge them harshly.

1228
01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.660
But,
um,
she already feels bad about it.
You know,
you don't want to hurt her,
but I,

1229
01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:22.270
there's,
there's a way more of like a therapy kind of way.

1230
01:13:22.271 --> 01:13:24.820
He could just ask them like,
why?
Why do you think that you did that?

1231
01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:28.570
And if she goes,
well,
why are you still asking me about it?
Which she might,

1232
01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:30.580
she might get defensive.
I would just say

1233
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:39.310
I,
I don't know because I,
it's,
it concerns me.

1234
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:45.400
That's a bad answer.
What do you mean it concerns?
You don't owe chases do.

1235
01:13:45.401 --> 01:13:47.260
This would be like dismantling a bomb.

1236
01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:56.080
I just put,
got me inside a hell of a story.
Like how did you keep that a secret?

1237
01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:00.880
How did you feel about that?
She probably needed to get it off her fucking chest.

1238
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:03.340
I think the fact that she had to admit it to you,

1239
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:06.970
it shows that she's not a complete sociopath,

1240
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:11.430
<v 0>you know?
I Dunno.
Okay.</v>

1241
01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:16.820
<v 1>Let me know how that one goes.
I gave you the best advice I could.
All right.</v>

1242
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.880
Bye curious girlfriend Jesus.

1243
01:14:18.881 --> 01:14:23.800
This is like the red shoe diaries is fucking weaker.
Um,
hey,
bill.

1244
01:14:23.801 --> 01:14:27.700
Recently I found out that my girlfriend who I've been uh,

1245
01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:31.990
with for a year now has been searching on the Internet for naked girls in porn

1246
01:14:31.991 --> 01:14:36.991
with hot girls is I was on her phone in front of her not snooping.

1247
01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:38.440
Oh yeah.
I'm sure you weren't snooping.

1248
01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:41.710
This was of course news to me and I confronted her about it,

1249
01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:45.510
which ended up in her being embarrassed and upset.

1250
01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:49.230
She promised me that she's never been interested in girls in that way.
However,

1251
01:14:49.231 --> 01:14:52.320
she told me that she does find girls attractive.
Dude,

1252
01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:53.880
what is the fucking problem?

1253
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:57.990
I love this girl and she makes me very happy this word me because even though I

1254
01:14:57.991 --> 01:15:02.160
am confident young and good looking male and made me feel insecure about myself

1255
01:15:02.161 --> 01:15:06.560
and feel that I'm not enough for her,
well that's very honest.
Um,

1256
01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:07.850
love the podcast,

1257
01:15:07.851 --> 01:15:12.851
especially the vice [inaudible] videos as I usually agree with your outlook on

1258
01:15:12.991 --> 01:15:16.740
different situations.
So just wanting to see what you thought about my situation.

1259
01:15:16.741 --> 01:15:19.980
Should I be concerned or should I just forget about and continue to be happy

1260
01:15:19.981 --> 01:15:21.360
with that?
Thanks to go fuck yourself.

1261
01:15:21.361 --> 01:15:23.010
Whether there's a number of ways that you can go with this.

1262
01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:27.450
You can either break up with her and then you're not with her.
You can,
uh,

1263
01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.630
drive her to indulge in this tree,
uh,

1264
01:15:30.631 --> 01:15:33.990
attraction and then get yourself a threesome amount of it.

1265
01:15:33.991 --> 01:15:37.530
But you probably gonna fuck up the relationship because it never fucking works.

1266
01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:41.370
Once you have that open fucking thing,
and then we have rules shy,

1267
01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:44.760
I have to be there and then eventually you won't be there and then it'll be

1268
01:15:44.761 --> 01:15:45.600
fucking weird.

1269
01:15:45.601 --> 01:15:49.830
And there'll be three people in the room when you have the breakup talk.
Um,

1270
01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:54.750
I dunno,
dude,
I'm,
I'm really big on not like judging people.
Like,

1271
01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:58.230
you know,
when it comes to that type of stuff,

1272
01:15:59.130 --> 01:16:02.250
like the sex stuff and the shit that they're fucking into because I still think

1273
01:16:02.251 --> 01:16:05.460
we're just scratching the surface of 'em

1274
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:10.650
of all the shit.
Like I don't even think we even understand it at this point.

1275
01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.040
So I think it's perfectly okay if she's into that type of thing.

1276
01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:18.460
I actually think it's kind of cool and,
um,
no,

1277
01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.760
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't,

1278
01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:24.270
there's no reason to feeling insecure.
You know what I mean?

1279
01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:28.200
Think about the porn that you've watched this debt.

1280
01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:31.590
You definitely got something in your sexual fucking closet that she doesn't

1281
01:16:31.591 --> 01:16:36.440
fucking know about.
You know what I mean?
Something that you're,
until you're,

1282
01:16:36.441 --> 01:16:39.450
until like older chick.
So who the fuck knows what right.

1283
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:44.810
The fuck knows.
I,
I think,

1284
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:49.510
I think like
to really have a great relationship,
you kind of,

1285
01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:50.750
you just got to accept the,

1286
01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:54.550
there's that fine line where you have to know what you're willing to accept and

1287
01:16:54.551 --> 01:16:57.730
what you're not willing to accept.
You got to know where that line is.

1288
01:16:57.731 --> 01:16:59.590
And when you're young,
I think you're still learning that.

1289
01:16:59.591 --> 01:17:00.790
So that's why you're writing me.

1290
01:17:01.570 --> 01:17:05.230
Just figuring out where that line is and if the person's on this side of that

1291
01:17:05.231 --> 01:17:08.560
line,
then you just have to be totally accepting of them.

1292
01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.073
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1293
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.791
<v 1>They,</v>

1294
01:17:10.791 --> 01:17:14.650
once they know that they can relax and you have a great fucking relationship,

1295
01:17:14.651 --> 01:17:17.230
you know?
Um,
not to toot my own horn,

1296
01:17:17.231 --> 01:17:21.020
but I have a great relationship with my wife and,
uh,

1297
01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:26.020
in part of it is because we do that with each other.
Like she,
you know,

1298
01:17:27.370 --> 01:17:31.870
she accepts me for the fucking lunatic that I am,
and I am a fucking lunatic.

1299
01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:33.693
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1300
01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:35.960
<v 1>Like,
I don't,</v>

1301
01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:39.110
it's the weird thing of me getting with her is I realized how fucking nuts I am.

1302
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:43.010
And I don't mean like,
Hey,
I'm a crazy guy.
I like to drink beer and smoke cigars.

1303
01:17:43.011 --> 01:17:47.240
I mean,
like,
there's something fucking a little off about me.

1304
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:51.740
And,
uh,
she accepts it.
She had to give a fuck.
You know,
on the surface.

1305
01:17:51.741 --> 01:17:54.920
I'm a great guy.
I'm sitting there making pumpkin bread,
you know,

1306
01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.330
working my ass off,
bringing home money.
But,
uh,
the other underneath there,

1307
01:17:59.331 --> 01:18:03.830
like I'm a fucking,
I'm an,
I'm a lunatic and a,

1308
01:18:03.831 --> 01:18:07.310
I'm such a psycho that I'm only just now realizing it and I can't even,

1309
01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:10.610
I can't even like verbalize what it is about me that makes me a fucking,

1310
01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:12.453
<v 0>uh,</v>

1311
01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.270
<v 1>I dunno.
Like I am unbelievably,
I dunno.</v>

1312
01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:24.010
I'm an antisocial son of a bitch.
I will tell you that right now.

1313
01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.280
Do you know I'm sitting in a hotel room right now with a TV that does not get

1314
01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:30.160
proper reception on a football Sunday.

1315
01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:34.420
Yesterday I could not get proper reception for the games and rather,

1316
01:18:34.421 --> 01:18:39.280
and I just shut the TV off because I'd rather miss the fucking football games

1317
01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:43.750
then to call down to the front desk and have to socially deal with somebody

1318
01:18:43.751 --> 01:18:47.230
coming in here and fixing the TV.
I just don't want them in here.

1319
01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.840
And while he was fixing the TV,
I would be sitting there.

1320
01:18:50.050 --> 01:18:52.180
I talked about this last night thinking like,

1321
01:18:52.181 --> 01:18:54.910
what if I just took my laptop and just smashed him over the fucking head

1322
01:18:54.911 --> 01:18:57.670
repeatedly right now,
you know,
I just think shit like that.

1323
01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.410
I wouldn't do it,
but that's what I would be thinking.

1324
01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:06.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1325
01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:09.240
<v 1>And the whole time he's helping me,
every time he would talk,</v>

1326
01:19:09.241 --> 01:19:12.960
I would just be in a hostile way thinking,
shut your fucking mouth.

1327
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:18.360
And that's just one of those ticks that I have it,
she accepts me.

1328
01:19:19.090 --> 01:19:22.410
Um,
oh,
I didn't read the last bit of the advertising here.
Oh,
by the way,

1329
01:19:22.411 --> 01:19:24.090
thanks to everybody that came out.

1330
01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.093

01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:29.520

Indiana.</v>

1333

1334

That's what they're known for.
Um,
all right.

everybody.
