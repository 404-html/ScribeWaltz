00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.800
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:06.570
It's bill burr and it's time for another Monday morning podcast for Monday.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.230
What would that be?
16 set Monday the 18th February 18th.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.630
<v 1>And uh,
we don't have guests on here to</v>

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.840
<v 0>demote lately more as I've gotten older here starting to lose my mind and I get</v>

6
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:22.240
self conscious about you guys listening to me going on and on and on.

7
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.340
I do have a special guest,

8
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.270
someone I've got to know last year or maybe a little bit more than than a year

9
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.830
ago.
We did a movie called the front runner.

10
00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:32.440
Please welcome director extraordinary or Jason Reitman.

11
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.160
<v 1>Now I have to admit,</v>

12
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.220
is Jason as a fan of your podcast that I am disappointed by myself even being

13
00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:42.380
here.
Cause I hate when you have a guest on the podcast,

14
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.800
my favorite episodes of the ones are just you and your,

15
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.540
and you're talking to yourself and you're your best guest and you go,
Oh really?

16
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:52.640
Bill?
Yeah.
And you like go back and forth.

17
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.380
So I'm frustrated with myself being here on your part.
Okay,

18
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.570
<v 0>well don't worry this thing by listeners.
Fortunately enjoy music,
movies,</v>

19
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:03.930
music and that type of thing.
So when I do have people on,
I don't,

20
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:08.931
I try not to have just some sort of random person and I'm having you on not only

21
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:14.370
cause I love the movie you made,
I'm also in it for a minute.

22
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.090
So this is held in a minute.
So this is also like self serving

23
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.850
<v 1>here.
You're great in the movie.</v>

24
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.120
Like you're genuinely great in the movie and I've gotten a lot of feedback on

25
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:25.220
that and you're not only in it for a minute,
like you play,
you have,

26
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.250
you have a good run down an alley a couple of times.
I,

27
00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:30.410
you have one of the best scenes in the film,
one of the best scenes in the film.

28
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.100
And one of the first things that people ever talk about is the,

29
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:36.470
is the beat where you drop the uh,
uh,

30
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:39.080
the notepad and they started talking about your scene and your character in it.

31
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:41.840
And I thought you were fantastic.
Oh,
I know.
And everybody,
uh,
yeah.

32
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.180
That was the one thing that people said like a,

33
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.430
<v 0>well,
let's just let them know what it's about in case,
you know,</v>

34
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:49.160
because God knows there's a million things to watch.
Um,

35
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.550
Jason Director movie last year called the,
uh,
the front runner,

36
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.710
which was the Gary Hart story,
which I didn't know that,

37
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.573
um,

38
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.020
up until when he ran for president that mainstream media,

39
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:06.290
meaning like the New York Times,
the La Times,
Chicago Tribune,
whatever,

40
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:11.291
like the newspapers that you paperboard delivered never delved into.

41
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.630
<v 2>MMM.</v>

42
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.120
<v 0>A political candidate's personal life as far as their,
their affairs or,
or,
or,</v>

43
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.380
or whatever was going on.
Even if they knew,

44
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.150
even if they knew what it was considered beneath them.
Scumbag journalism,

45
00:02:25.151 --> 00:02:29.560
like a,
um,
national enquirer level stuff.
I had no idea.

46
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.313
<v 2>MMM.</v>

47
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.140
<v 0>I guess it was something I never really thought about.
Like whether they,
uh,</v>

48
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.910
because growing up I felt like the only person who ever did it was JFK.

49
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.600
Cause that's what you always heard about him or about him?
Marilyn Monroe.
Yeah.

50
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:46.560
But you never heard about anybody else.
So I just sort of assumed that,
oh,

51
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:47.730
he screwed around.

52
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.353
<v 2>MMM.</v>

53
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.730
<v 0>There was a couple of legendary guys that screwed around that screwed around so</v>

54
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:55.830
much that everybody kind of knew.
So I,
I thought that,

55
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.510
I guess I kind of thought that screwing around with sort of a new thing,
right.

56
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.433
Or whatever.
So

57
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.500
<v 1>how we feel about sex in general,
I mean,
you know,</v>

58
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.920
as we get older we realize that,
oh,
that's right.

59
00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.230
More people are probably pervs than we thought.

60
00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.990
And most people cheat than we thought.
And you go back in history.
Oh yeah.

61
00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:17.100
People would probably been doing these things since the dawn of man when I was

62
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.420
really young.
I was taking drum lessons from this guy and he was,

63
00:03:21.421 --> 00:03:22.770
he was 70 then

64
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.490
<v 0>and I was like 18 or 19,
and I was taking drums.
He's all big band drummer.</v>

65
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.230
And he would start telling me stories one time.
Um,
he was like,

66
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:35.980
oh yeah.
He goes,
I used to have,
he goes this,
I knew this,
uh,
this is a woman.

67
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:37.630
She had green eyes,
man.
She was crazy.

68
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.710
It's the East a banger in the park up against the tree.
And I was like,

69
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:45.190
listen to this shit bag,
a drum lesson.

70
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.690
Well we got to know each other after a while we'd hang out and stuff.
So this,

71
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.570
he didn't give a shit.

72
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:54.430
He told me cause I was fascinated with his life cause I wanted to on some level

73
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:54.851
it's like,
wait,

74
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:58.830
is this what I knew I wanted a fun job and I knew I love drums but I,

75
00:03:58.831 --> 00:04:03.700
I didn't have it.
I was like more like dad rock band sort of talent level.

76
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.170
But I didn't know that at that point.

77
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.010
And I was fascinated because he had lived that life.
He,

78
00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:12.340
he and he went through the whole big band era and all of that and watch that go

79
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:14.830
away and how he dealt with it and all that stuff.

80
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:18.250
But he used to tell me these stories and I remember I looked at him like you did

81
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:19.240
that,
what was that like?

82
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:22.750
Like the 1930 [inaudible] 1930 [inaudible] 1940 [inaudible] and like you did

83
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:25.570
that.
And he goes,
let me tell you something kid.
He goes,

84
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:29.740
every generation thinks they're the first generation that ever fucked.
And I was,

85
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.300
and I never forgot that.
I love the wording on that too.
That's perfect.
Yeah.

86
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.840
But then you of course you go back and you,
you know,
if you're the Romans,

87
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:41.830
Greeks and all that stuff,
you really,
it seems like it was like nothing happened.

88
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.270
Like nobody had sex between the Romans and the Greeks right up until a
Woodstock,

89
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.720
right.
Is kind of how it goes.
So anyway,
so what's his face?

90
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:54.721
Scary heart get has an affair with Donna Rice and the Miami Herald decides to

91
00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:59.680
cross that line.
And ever since then,
uh,

92
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.930
we now have what we have now where they just stay,

93
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:05.860
just delve into everybody's life and sports it now with like social media.

94
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:07.960
I just thought it was just such a,
the way you did it,

95
00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:12.760
it was just such a great story considering everything that's happening now,

96
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.830
you know,
like almost like everything's out there now.
Um,

97
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.350
to go back and kind of be like,
this was sort of like the first,

98
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.450
like I can't even say leak in the dyke.

99
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.030
This was just the thing that kind of blew it open.
Yeah.
No,

100
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.140
<v 1>and by the way,
I didn't know this stuff either.</v>

101
00:05:27.141 --> 00:05:29.930
I'm not exactly a student of history.
I'm a student of movies.

102
00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:33.740
I like movies and I didn't know the story and I frankly didn't really know who

103
00:05:33.741 --> 00:05:38.270
Gary Hart was.
You know,
I was probably 10 when this happened.
And,

104
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.990
uh,
there was a radio lab not to plug in different podcasts,
sorry.

105
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.450
But that's all right.
Radio have a,
isn't a radio lab.
Everybody.

106
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.500
I did a piece on this story,
Matt by had written a book,
uh,
about Gary Hart.

107
00:05:51.501 --> 00:05:55.220
And that really was my introduction to the story and considering everything that

108
00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:58.850
we're going through right now and considering the way that we've of a thin the

109
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:01.520
line between what is a private life and what is a public life.

110
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.100
And I thought this story was fascinating,

111
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.420
that there was a moment where as you just said,
he's,

112
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.830
his private life was out of bounds.
It was considered not only uncouth,

113
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.270
but it just wasn't our business.

114
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.420
And he's a guy who was actually a great candidate in every other respect.

115
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.610
Uh,
you know,
two term senator and was kind of just the,

116
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.160
not only the presumed nominee but presumed to when,
you know,

117
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:28.970
he was like 10 points ahead of George Bush going into the campaign.

118
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.120
<v 0>Yeah.
Plus we had just had eight years of Republican.
So then that,</v>

119
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.600
that's what happens.
And everybody's like,
oh,
it's the red ties fault,
right.

120
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.600
Can go and then you go eight years this way,
then eight years that way.
So

121
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.170
<v 1>yeah.
And,
and the story kind of broke so,
so basically,
yeah,
you're right.</v>

122
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.810
Other than,
you know,
people kind of knew about Gary Hart,
the,

123
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.710
I think there was kind of presumptions that perhaps he was a womanizer that

124
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:49.920
perhaps he dated around,
you know,

125
00:06:49.921 --> 00:06:52.110
he'd been separated from his wife for a couple of times.
And so he had,

126
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.400
he had kind of just dated traditionally in DC and,

127
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.020
and the Miami Herald,

128
00:06:58.021 --> 00:07:00.540
what is dated traditionally means he's separated and I mean,

129
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:01.440
don't want to say he wasn't,

130
00:07:01.441 --> 00:07:04.050
there was a moment where he wasn't married and he was just kind of going on

131
00:07:04.051 --> 00:07:07.560
dates and so people got to feel for what this guy is like as a,

132
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.570
as a bachelor guy crushes it at work,

133
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:11.670
he crushes it outside when he was a handsome guy,

134
00:07:11.671 --> 00:07:14.520
him and his best friend was Warren Beatty.
I mean,
you know,
uh

135
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.350
<v 0>Oh wow.
Yeah,
there you go.</v>

136
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.560
<v 1>So,
uh,
the Miami Herald gets wind of this and they,</v>

137
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.200
they followed it up and when a lot of other newspapers said,
you know,

138
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:27.140
we're not gonna,
we're not gonna cover this.
The Miami Herald did,

139
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:29.660
an American public said,
yes,
give me more of that.

140
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.630
And it coincides with just a lot of things happening simultaneously.
You know,
uh,

141
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.330
it was just a few years before that CNN even like went on the air.

142
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:43.040
They started crossfire.
This satellite van was invented a current affair.

143
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:47.720
The first gossip television show,
you know,
goes on,
goes on the air suit.
So the,

144
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.070
you know,
what we think of is,
you know,
national enquirer being a print medium,

145
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:56.810
like made it to television and now we're filling a 24 hour news cycle and the

146
00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:00.650
American public said,
yeah,
that that matters to us.
We want to,
we want to hear.

147
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.060
<v 0>And that was also too,
back then before the 24 hour news channel,</v>

148
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.860
you had time shit was coming out.
You at least,
you know,

149
00:08:08.861 --> 00:08:12.070
if it was eight in the more like this fucking stories breaking in 11 hours we

150
00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:13.780
got it.
We got to over 10 hours,

151
00:08:13.781 --> 00:08:18.781
we got to do something here and now you have like forget about the 24 hours.

152
00:08:18.881 --> 00:08:23.710
So you have social media and now also the way people post news,

153
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.700
there is no alleged.

154
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.380
It's like somebody gets accused of something and then regular people because

155
00:08:29.381 --> 00:08:31.330
they're not in journalism.
And then I guess there's,

156
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.020
there's no libel or anything on the Internet.
It's just be,
you know,

157
00:08:35.021 --> 00:08:40.021
so-and-so accused of this and then it's like the next generation of that piece

158
00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:45.160
of shit.
Blahblahblahblahblah did this and um,
oh,
sorry.
That's me.

159
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.400
<v 1>Uh Oh shit.
This is literally,</v>

160
00:08:50.401 --> 00:08:52.140
this is the part of the podcasts that you enjoy.

161
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.250
When I fucking go onto my phone here and completely a

162
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.960
<v 0>175 pounds,</v>

163
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:05.820
we'll say,
there we go.
Is this your way in?
No,

164
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:09.450
I'm doing Santa Barbara Tonight and I'm flying the helicopter up with my

165
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:11.480
instructor and I thought we only got to get the two seater.

166
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.240
Now the four seater became available.
So I'm asking if my,
my buddy can go along.

167
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:18.870
So he just needs to know how many is there going to be and how much he weighs

168
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.733
because it's all waiting

169
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:23.080
<v 1>single.
Anytime you rent a helicopter or take a helicopter,</v>

170
00:09:23.081 --> 00:09:24.250
you have to admit your weight.

171
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.360
<v 0>Does that funk with paypal?
Uh,
yeah.
You know what?</v>

172
00:09:28.361 --> 00:09:31.540
It's funny because especially in this business with entertainers.
Yeah.

173
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.380
Cause I had a buddy of mine,
he goes and he was sort of fad at the time,

174
00:09:35.381 --> 00:09:37.810
fatter than he wanted to be.
And he goes,
dude,

175
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.840
I'll be like one 90 by the time we fly.

176
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.310
I think he was over to bills and he didn't want to admit it and I just said,

177
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.190
I just said,
dude,
this is not a time to lie.

178
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.431
He came back,

179
00:09:51.431 --> 00:09:55.150
he's like two oh six but I'm going to be in the one nineties by the time we fly

180
00:09:55.151 --> 00:09:58.000
it's like great,
just don't,
you know,
don't gain any more weight or whatever.

181
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.730
And what they do is they'll just adjust like five pounds up or something like

182
00:10:00.731 --> 00:10:01.564
that.
I would think

183
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:02.840
<v 1>dome,</v>

184
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.170
they're moving weight around the helicopter to balance it left right top bottom

185
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.840
<v 0>and then how much fuel you can have.
Like there was a,</v>

186
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.320
there was some kid who was inexperienced or whatever and he filled up the thing

187
00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:16.670
that I was uh,
and I'm going to fly the are 44 so it's a four passenger.

188
00:10:16.671 --> 00:10:20.000
When you have a four passenger,
I mean unless you have kids,
you know,

189
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.460
I haven't flown this thing much.
I'm just repeating what people told me.

190
00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:27.020
You never feel both tanks up full cause you just have too much weight and you

191
00:10:27.021 --> 00:10:28.430
won't be able to get lift.

192
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.790
And I don't even know who this guy even got into a Harvard,

193
00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:32.930
but somehow we did and he took off.

194
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.890
And then it just becomes this thing where you're just,

195
00:10:35.891 --> 00:10:38.570
you're just pulling too much power and you're,
you're,
uh,

196
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.050
you start descending and then your brain tells you pull more,

197
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.930
which you actually want to do is try to level out what she probably should have

198
00:10:44.931 --> 00:10:46.580
done was something called a running landing,

199
00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:50.570
which is sort of sliding into second base.
Um,
which he did not do.

200
00:10:50.571 --> 00:10:54.830
And unfortunately it didn't end well that day.
So that's why we're asking.

201
00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:58.370
He's asking how many more?
It's only one,
only one is not a big deal.

202
00:10:58.371 --> 00:11:01.370
And also he's in,
he's like a buck 75,
so it won't be a problem,

203
00:11:01.371 --> 00:11:03.500
but it will definitely,
you know,

204
00:11:03.501 --> 00:11:06.520
I would think he wouldn't talk off both at this point.
But um,
but it's,

205
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.570
it's not that long a flight.

206
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.960
<v 1>My DP is a pilot and I said,
and Parker was a pilot.
A lot of my camera crew,</v>

207
00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:15.380
we are pilots and on up in the air,
uh,
which we did with American Airlines,

208
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.430
they took the whole camera team down to Dallas at the end of the shoot.

209
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.540
And they have,

210
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:25.540
I guess this warehouse where they have a cockpit simulator for every plane they

211
00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:30.230
have in their fleet and they just start putting them into planes.

212
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.110
And these cockpits are real,

213
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.930
I mean they are completely outfitted that it costs millions of dollars and

214
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.060
they're so good that if you,

215
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.570
if you get certified on the simulator,

216
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.210
you are ready to take passengers up in the air.

217
00:11:44.211 --> 00:11:46.830
Like there was no inbetween as soon as you're certified on the,

218
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.200
<v 0>no.</v>

219
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.340
What I don't understand about that is how do they duplicate the feel of whatever

220
00:11:51.341 --> 00:11:56.341
you're flying and how do they duplicate like turbulence and then not only that,

221
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.200
you know,
no matter what,
you're not to do

222
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.440
<v 1>die in that thing.
Right.</v>

223
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:06.470
So you've never had to mentally try to keep your shit together.

224
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.200
I speak.
So I would think you,
you have to go up with somebody.
You got to,

225
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.240
you don't think they go.
All right buddy,
here's your space invaders.

226
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.470
Huc in a certificate.
Eric says,
my scenario,
Eric,
he,

227
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.710
he said he's never sweat more in his life.
He said,

228
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.460
you forget that it is fake the moment it is happening because it's all while it,

229
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.290
the whole thing is shaking the whole time.

230
00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:30.710
The whole thing can rotate and move and shake.
They got screens all around.

231
00:12:30.711 --> 00:12:34.160
So all you see is what you would be normally seeing outside the window.

232
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.460
I got into that and what they did is they were just fucking with him the whole

233
00:12:37.461 --> 00:12:40.490
time.
So with each one of the guys on my camera team,

234
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:45.500
they would just throw everything you left engine's out.

235
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.920
You know,
a Burgess went through your under tornado coming.

236
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.090
They gave everyone the Sally route to see if they could no one,
no one to kill.

237
00:12:53.091 --> 00:12:57.920
Everyone was just crashing in the river and Oh God,
yeah.
Oh that's in Dallas,
Huh?

238
00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.650
Yeah.
And then when we were shooting front runner,
uh,

239
00:13:00.651 --> 00:13:04.370
we were over at Delta and they,
uh,
cause the delta is in Atlanta.
And,
uh,

240
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:08.100
I remember on a lunch break,
the guys did the same thing.
Is that,

241
00:13:08.101 --> 00:13:10.340
and I missed out,
I didn't know this was going down.

242
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.990
They came back from lunch and Eric was,
she,

243
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.130
his hands were shaking cause he said it's just,
it's so real.

244
00:13:16.131 --> 00:13:18.500
You forget that you're in a simulator and it's exactly

245
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.691
<v 0>right.</v>

246
00:13:18.691 --> 00:13:21.180
Well hopefully somebody listens to this and let's be try to do something like

247
00:13:21.181 --> 00:13:24.140
that.
Cause I always,
every represents like nine 11 with those,
you know,

248
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.530
the terrorists taking over the place.

249
00:13:25.531 --> 00:13:29.280
You have your Steven Seagal fantasy that she would take them all out.

250
00:13:29.281 --> 00:13:30.540
But then in my fantasy,

251
00:13:30.541 --> 00:13:33.510
the pilots are also taken out and then that's where it ends.

252
00:13:33.511 --> 00:13:37.500
It's like I could fly a plane,
no.
Oh,
okay.
Now and I don't,

253
00:13:37.501 --> 00:13:40.330
and there's a lot of stuff that,
um,

254
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:45.570
is involved with it that I don't understand that does fascinates me as far as

255
00:13:45.571 --> 00:13:48.450
their flaps and that type of stuff as far as like,
you know,

256
00:13:48.451 --> 00:13:51.990
because the weird thing about aviation as you kind of learn through people

257
00:13:51.991 --> 00:13:54.780
fucking up in most of the time those fuck ups lead to death.

258
00:13:54.781 --> 00:13:57.600
And it's not something that you want to,
it's like,
it's,

259
00:13:57.601 --> 00:14:01.310
I'd equate it to like riding a motorcycle where if,
you know,
yeah,

260
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.140
if you'd sell it,

261
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.250
you'll going person you want to talk to about riding a motorcycle is somebody

262
00:14:05.251 --> 00:14:08.340
else who rides a motorcycle cause they'll talk about the fun of it and where to

263
00:14:08.341 --> 00:14:12.450
go.
Anybody else,
no matter when you know that a win,
right.

264
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.280
Same thing with like aviation,

265
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.470
which is not a fair comparison because of how safe it is.

266
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.580
Um,
I mean there's always obviously an element of danger every time you do it,

267
00:14:23.581 --> 00:14:24.630
but like the,
the,

268
00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:27.570
just the sheer amount of people that are up there versus down here,

269
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.120
there's nobody up there texting and,

270
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:35.040
and also the level of training and the level of just communication that goes on

271
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.790
when you're up there.
I mean,

272
00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.780
that's what always blows by and after every flight is when I then go down the

273
00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:42.020
highway and you know,
out here,
uh,

274
00:14:42.021 --> 00:14:44.490
upwards of six lanes of breasts and it's just like,

275
00:14:44.491 --> 00:14:48.780
I'm literally flying in formation right now on the ground people,

276
00:14:48.781 --> 00:14:51.380
I don't know what their flight plan is.
I don't know what they're to do.

277
00:14:51.381 --> 00:14:52.850
People are just ignoring the rules.

278
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.840
Like those people who pass you on the right doing like 95 miles an hour and

279
00:14:56.841 --> 00:15:00.800
you're trying to get off.
Um,
and I can't tell you how many times I've landed,

280
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.610
got in my car and then got on the highway and seen an accident.

281
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.680
That's happened like four times.

282
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.740
I saw the craziest accident day I was on the 10 and two cars try to merge into

283
00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:13.610
the same lane.

284
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.800
They both notice each other at the same time and they don't touch,

285
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.990
their car's never make contact,

286
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.940
but they both freak out by how close they are doing for other actors.

287
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.260
And one overcorrect left goes into the media and the other one over corrects

288
00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:32.120
right roles,
their car.
Oh,

289
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:37.450
cross up into his sign up onto the dirt and I'm just behind them.

290
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:41.270
Three quarters between both of them and just go right between them.

291
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:44.930
It was an episode of the fall guy.
It was like transforms.

292
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.370
It was so crazy and they never touched each other.
It was the freakiest thing.

293
00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:51.470
It was like the hand of God.
It was a,

294
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.650
it spooked me for a while after because it's just so strange.

295
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.850
I remember early in my career I did a road gig with the comic would broken his

296
00:15:58.851 --> 00:16:02.750
hip in a car accident and he drove like an old lady and like I was like,

297
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:03.291
what the fuck?

298
00:16:03.291 --> 00:16:07.580
And then I started driving and I could just feel him how nervous he was.

299
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:09.740
And that was the first time that clicked in my head,

300
00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:13.820
the physics of what I was doing.
Like I,
this car is going 80 so am I,

301
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.880
you know,
I'm going 80 miles on you.
Like you just don't think it.

302
00:16:16.881 --> 00:16:20.000
You just sit in there cruising along and all you're gauging is what's in front

303
00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:24.500
of you and well it's clear so it doesn't feel like you're going 80 miles and

304
00:16:24.501 --> 00:16:25.400
like I'm,
I'm going,

305
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:30.020
my body is traveling at a rate that if I was to hit something and stop abruptly,

306
00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:33.230
my brain's going to slam it against the inside of my skull and I'm going to be

307
00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:36.560
dead.
Like,
that's just not something that I think,

308
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.220
and this happens in aviation to when,
when guys get higher and higher,
ours is,

309
00:16:40.221 --> 00:16:43.970
you get that false sense of safety.
Like they,

310
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:47.900
what I heard an in ground school was the most dangerous pilots where the people

311
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:52.901
with very few hours and then people with a ton of hours because then they would

312
00:16:53.151 --> 00:16:55.580
get lazy with their preflight,
you know,
cause it,
you know,

313
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.330
they never had an engine failure.
Never.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's fine.

314
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:03.110
Let's go fucking load it up.
You fine.
What do you weigh?
Fucking bucks.
60 bucks.

315
00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:07.520
70 to get it in the fucking thing and um,
you know,
and just,

316
00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:10.220
just doing dumb shit.
You know,
why aren't there more?

317
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.820
It's funny when I think about it,
there's plenty of stories,

318
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.620
horror stories about musicians on the road.
So many musicians have died,

319
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.560
plane crashes,
car crashes,
or you can just Kinda,
you just in your mind,

320
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:24.860
I say that you can kind of instantly lists like 20 of them,
right?

321
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.480
I don't know the stories about comics,

322
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:29.990
but comics are on the road just as much because we fly commercial.

323
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.770
Most of most of those guys,
I think that died.
A lot of those.
They were,

324
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.940
they were chartering planes.
Like the,
the day the music died.

325
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.730
Like that was the whole thing.
Let's get that.
And all of that was,

326
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.000
because I remember I played that room,
the surf ballroom,

327
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.500
and I flew into that airport,
the whole thing.
It was like,
Jews,

328
00:17:46.501 --> 00:17:49.010
you're going to fly into that airport.
He'll get like,
they think it's the,

329
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.170
it's like,
no,
what happened was,

330
00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:56.670
as far as what I read was just the technology for de icing just was not there.

331
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.650
So it,
he had the added weight on his wings of the ice and then also the ice,

332
00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:06.000
just the layer of it changes the shape of the wing,

333
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:10.920
which affects your level of lift.
And he had those two devastating combinations.

334
00:18:10.921 --> 00:18:15.570
And then,
then the,
the end result of that equation was they all died.
So,
um,

335
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.400
yeah,
I'm,
I don't know that there's,
I think Leonard Skinner was another one.

336
00:18:20.401 --> 00:18:23.490
I think Aerosmith had just chartered that plane or was going to chart,

337
00:18:23.491 --> 00:18:24.960
that was a shit plane.

338
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.060
You see they found Arrowsmith original tour van.
No,

339
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:35.061
apparently they found original like tiny tour van would like spray painted on

340
00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:39.270
the side or something.
Like how does that exist for that long for,

341
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:42.080
so somebody just doesn't,
I would just think that the plot,

342
00:18:42.081 --> 00:18:46.420
it had no idea who Aerosmith was.
Right.
It says it on the side of the van.
Yeah.

343
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.120
And just had it in the back and like,

344
00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:52.650
I don't know if that was a brand crump company or what tilt is that fucking,

345
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.013
that's,
that's the,

346
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.750
that should be in like the rock and roll hall of fame or something.
Uh,

347
00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:01.740
the sets from 2001 sat in a field forever in England.

348
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:06.160
Uh,
like all these old spaceships and uh,
and spacecraft and,

349
00:19:06.161 --> 00:19:09.230
and things that they build miniatures.
Uh,
but we're just like enormous manger.

350
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.310
Apparently we're sitting in a field for years in England.

351
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.700
That's what I find fascinating about when I was talking to you when we had the

352
00:19:14.701 --> 00:19:17.130
time when we were doing front runner,

353
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:19.890
was talking to you about growing up in this business.

354
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.640
And when I listened to you talking about movies and movie sets,

355
00:19:23.641 --> 00:19:27.240
I was fascinated because you sound like me the way I talked about sports and

356
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.950
football cards and guys who played in old stadiums and that type of stuff.
And,

357
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.750
um,
did your parents ever,
uh,

358
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.700
try to discourage you from getting into this business?

359
00:19:38.701 --> 00:19:42.540
I would say that a lot cause I don't think I would do that to my daughter

360
00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:46.180
because I just look at it like this is an incredibly fun business.
It's,

361
00:19:46.181 --> 00:19:49.170
it's really hard and it's very competitive.

362
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:54.660
But so I think if you're going to try to get to the top of any business,

363
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.480
you're gonna deal with that same thing.

364
00:19:57.481 --> 00:20:02.481
It's not like trying to become the greatest oil man or politics or the best

365
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:05.820
lawyer.
I would think that all of that becomes cutthroat.

366
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:10.110
The higher up you're going up the mountain.
So,
I mean,
if you're really into this,

367
00:20:10.111 --> 00:20:13.370
uh,
this business,
I mean,
I just,

368
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.370
plus I also don't think it's as bad as it used to be as far as now with like all

369
00:20:17.371 --> 00:20:18.204
of this,
uh,

370
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:22.410
the power that the individual has on social media that if somebody is a creek,

371
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:24.360
because that was the big thing,
especially if you had a daughter,
he's like,

372
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:26.610
you're not getting into this business casting couch,

373
00:20:26.611 --> 00:20:30.740
all of those horror stories of that shit.
Now I think it's,
it's,
um,
I've,

374
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.900
I've just declared on my podcast that it's,
it's,
it's okay.
No,

375
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.760
that's what I did and I just decided that's how I do it.
I mean,
I honestly,

376
00:20:38.761 --> 00:20:40.440
I think the,
the rejection,

377
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:45.500
the potential for rejection is more dangerous then I guess partying and all that

378
00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:48.220
stuff.
I,
I think,

379
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.950
<v 1>uh,
if I,
you know,
if my daughter was thinking of going into business,</v>

380
00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:54.670
that would be my biggest fear is just going to a business where,
you know,

381
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:59.260
decade by decade you're being told you're worthless or were told,
um,
that,

382
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.410
uh,
your value list on a daily basis.
That's no way to live.

383
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.090
But my parents actually,

384
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.740
<v 0>I think that's literally said,
oh,</v>

385
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:09.100
that's just something that gets in your head by not booking auditions.

386
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.990
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean unlike any other business where you can kind of see,
you know,</v>

387
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.650
judge your own where's by how you're doing,
uh,
these are business.
Yeah.

388
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:19.540
You go to audition after audition,
uh,

389
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:23.050
or you write something one after night and you don't really have a sense of why

390
00:21:23.051 --> 00:21:25.210
you're not being picked or why your work is not being made.

391
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.360
And so you start to second guess and look in the mirror and go,
oh,
is it this?

392
00:21:28.361 --> 00:21:31.630
Is it that,
you know,
is it because I wore this is because I'm too heavy as it,

393
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:32.141
you know,

394
00:21:32.141 --> 00:21:35.020
maybe I need to look more like this person or sound more like this person.

395
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.213
I went through a hell of that.

396
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:36.881
<v 0>I bet.</v>

397
00:21:36.881 --> 00:21:41.881
I think that's the fork in the road where you can really go into a deep

398
00:21:42.251 --> 00:21:46.120
depression,
which I did.
Or you can grow from it where you just go like,

399
00:21:46.121 --> 00:21:50.500
you know what?
Fuck this.
This is what I do.
This is what I look like.

400
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.720
And that's how once I went to that mindset,
this is what I do.

401
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.190
This is what I look like.
If you want to book me,
awesome.
If you don't,

402
00:21:57.191 --> 00:22:00.240
I understand.
There's all kinds of beautiful piece we're allowed there.

403
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.620
<v 1>Yeah,
always.
I mean,</v>

404
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.980
one thing I've learned from listening to your podcast though is that you have,

405
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.590
and I'm not sure if these developed earlier or later,

406
00:22:07.591 --> 00:22:12.450
but you have a strong sense of self reflection and,

407
00:22:12.451 --> 00:22:15.900
and,
and,
and you probably don't like to be saying this,
but I think you're,

408
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.050
you're incredibly thoughtful when it comes to that.
Uh,
and,

409
00:22:19.051 --> 00:22:22.980
and really healthy compliments are not allowed on this now.
I know,
I know.

410
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.420
Sorry.
I know.
I know.

411
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:30.580
<v 0>No,
I do.
I'm,
I'm a,
yeah.
Neil was telling me I have to get better at doing that,</v>

412
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:35.260
so thank you.
I appreciate it.
But there was,
I went through,
um,

413
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.040
in the,
uh,
okay.
So when I started,

414
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.000
the look was,
it was just the post eighties,

415
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.720
but that look was still around the sport coat with the Miami vice colored tee

416
00:22:46.721 --> 00:22:48.610
shirt.
And the sleeves pulled up a little bit.

417
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:53.290
And I remember my mother got me a sport coat to wear on stage and I knew it

418
00:22:53.291 --> 00:22:56.650
would look good,
but I didn't think I was good enough to wear it.

419
00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.830
So I don't if that's the Catholic guilt or whatever.
So I never wore it.

420
00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.590
<v 1>She got me that great.
I didn't,
I,
it's fucking hilarious.</v>

421
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:06.820
I didn't think I was good enough to dress like a hacky fucking road comic

422
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.130
because at that point it was like 93 and 94 so that look was way out and like,

423
00:23:12.131 --> 00:23:14.790
um,
is that jacket looks still at your folks' house or,
you know,

424
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.770
I'm trying to think where the,
I think I might,

425
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.890
they might be at my parents house or it was,
it was,
uh,

426
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.150
given away or something.
But,
um,

427
00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:24.983
<v 0>then the,
the,</v>

428
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.920
the grunge thing came in so everybody had to have their shirts on tucked.

429
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.250
And then the late nineties was a real moose era.

430
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:36.250
There was a lot of moose in the hair.
And I remember,
you know,

431
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.640
that was back in the days of the black and white photos.
Right.

432
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.900
So I had booked a little bit of acting work early in my career.

433
00:23:42.901 --> 00:23:46.010
And if you're young and you book anything,
I booked a or something like that,

434
00:23:46.011 --> 00:23:48.140
all of a sudden they're just like,
oh Jesus.
Well you know,

435
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.610
this must be the next young horse we can write.
Yeah.
So they started,

436
00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:56.220
I had a little buzz,
you know,
new guy in New York,
whatever.
So I would hand out,

437
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.170
you know,
they handed out my,

438
00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.440
my photos and this back when I had hair and with the Moose and the hair,

439
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.700
my hair looked brown.

440
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.860
So on some lower budget shit they would bring me in for like the lead or

441
00:24:06.861 --> 00:24:07.340
something.

442
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.790
And there was sort of an unwritten rule that redheaded males or just you're not

443
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:13.460
the lead,
you're the friend.
So I would walk in,
you know,

444
00:24:13.461 --> 00:24:16.640
prepared like the three scenes or whatever and they'd come walking in their face

445
00:24:16.641 --> 00:24:19.490
that drop and be like,
okay,
we're just going to do the first thing.

446
00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:23.020
And that happened a million times and I'd be like,
but I,
but I prepared off.

447
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.920
Nobody would just,
yeah,
maybe if you read for his friend or something.

448
00:24:27.921 --> 00:24:30.590
And I,
um,

449
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.010
it was funny cause I never quite got frustrated because I knew what was going
on.

450
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:39.020
I figured it out after a couple of times of that happening,
like,
oh,
I get it,

451
00:24:39.021 --> 00:24:41.380
I look like fucking Ron Howard and they think,
you know,

452
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:45.620
I'm not this guy and I just always had in my head eventually I'm going to get

453
00:24:45.621 --> 00:24:47.420
that part.
And,

454
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.870
but my goals were all stand up related anyways.

455
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:55.010
And I knew that my standup was going to lead to me meeting someone like you and

456
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.970
hopefully getting a partner in a movie.
So that's what I ended up doing.

457
00:24:58.971 --> 00:25:01.520
I just focused on stand up and stand up and stand up and stand up.

458
00:25:01.521 --> 00:25:03.320
And then eventually I pushed through and I think,
uh,

459
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.900
I would say Vince Gilligan was the first guy with breaking bad.

460
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:10.160
I finally got to play an asshole.
I got to play an asshole.
And I liked,

461
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:14.210
what I liked about playing that asshole was I had Hule so I didn't have to act

462
00:25:14.211 --> 00:25:16.550
tough.
Right.
It's like I got this guy,

463
00:25:16.551 --> 00:25:19.390
so I just had to be the reasonable that I come on,
man,
this guy,

464
00:25:19.391 --> 00:25:21.470
he's going to get upset,
just fucking sign this thing.

465
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.600
<v 1>I remember actually onset because there's a dynamic that was in my head and I</v>

466
00:25:25.601 --> 00:25:27.790
think that often happens as a director I was saying in their head,

467
00:25:27.791 --> 00:25:30.880
but they're not communicating it enough to the actors or whoever.

468
00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:35.290
And I had this dynamic in my head of what you and Steve's,

469
00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:36.550
this is where do we each other.

470
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And I remember the moment where you suddenly got what I w why I thought the two

471
00:25:42.461 --> 00:25:43.450
of you would be great together.

472
00:25:43.451 --> 00:25:46.660
Like why I thought this was an interesting comic pairing as two people at a

473
00:25:46.661 --> 00:25:48.460
newspaper who worked together.
Right.
You know,

474
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:53.610
one guy who your character who had under actually done a lot of undercover work

475
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.650
and uh,
was kind of more tough as nails,
but uh,

476
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.130
but also maybe talking it up a little too much.

477
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.140
And then the other guy that had never been undercover,

478
00:26:02.141 --> 00:26:05.090
I had never done in any type of investigation and,

479
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.000
and what that work would be like together.

480
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:10.710
<v 0>Well that was a fun guy to be that guy,</v>

481
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:15.950
like a saying that he did more than he did because I go the other way.

482
00:26:16.771 --> 00:26:20.040
I,
I underplay and that's,
and I'm telling you,

483
00:26:20.041 --> 00:26:25.041
that comes from where I was born in the world growing up just outside of Boston,

484
00:26:25.531 --> 00:26:27.660
Massachusetts.
You know,

485
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.430
look in the way I did with fucking orange hair and shit.
The,

486
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.520
the move was underplaying self deprecation,
right?

487
00:26:35.521 --> 00:26:36.930
Funny yourself before it was on.

488
00:26:36.931 --> 00:26:40.050
You make the bigger kids who could beat the shit out of you,
laugh.

489
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:43.800
So they like you.
And in that moment when they're going to somebody up,

490
00:26:43.801 --> 00:26:46.020
they look at you and then move on to the next kid.

491
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.980
That's what it was all about was just getting it off of me.
It was like,

492
00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:51.480
what was that came the wonder ball?
You know,

493
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:53.550
when you're a kid that wind up ball goes round and round.

494
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:57.090
Just making sure when that song ended,
you weren't holding on that.
Yeah,

495
00:26:57.091 --> 00:27:00.750
you weren't holding the ball.
So,
um,
you know,
it's funny,
in my school,

496
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:05.940
<v 1>the redheaded guy in my class was,
the tough guy was,</v>

497
00:27:05.941 --> 00:27:06.960
his name was Paris.
Crone.

498
00:27:06.961 --> 00:27:10.110
And he was the son of the lead singer for Reo Speedwagon

499
00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.660
<v 0>and uh,
he was the tough guy.</v>

500
00:27:14.661 --> 00:27:19.160
He was easily the,
the toughest dude in class.
He's probably a sweetheart now,

501
00:27:19.161 --> 00:27:20.570
but he was a bully back then.

502
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:24.830
And so that was my association with redhead head through elementary school.

503
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.980
That's what I love about kids who grew up in like Hollywood and La out here.

504
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.180
Like the people you went to fucking see.
This is why I love being out here.

505
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:34.820
It's not meeting the guy,

506
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.880
it's meeting the relatives or some,

507
00:27:37.881 --> 00:27:40.460
like I went one time I went to a Superbowl party and I met this guy.

508
00:27:40.461 --> 00:27:45.230
His grandfather played the guy who was in the bed with the Horse Head in the

509
00:27:45.231 --> 00:27:49.520
Godfather.
That's amazing analysis going.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

510
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.710
So like whenever people like shit on La Going,
oh,

511
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:56.240
this is a bunch of photos and blah blah.
Yeah,
it's like everything has,

512
00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:01.190
there's a phoniness to every industry,
especially when there's money involved.

513
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.941
But when you get out here,

514
00:28:01.941 --> 00:28:06.230
there's an extremely talented people and creative people and then you get like

515
00:28:06.231 --> 00:28:09.690
great,
uh,
like moments like that.
Like,
uh,

516
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.190
I know a comic I started off with in,
in Boston,
Tony Vee,

517
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.271
I don't if you remember this,

518
00:28:14.271 --> 00:28:16.230
you remember that those old luggage commercials at the,

519
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.200
was it the tourist or commercials or whatever?

520
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.070
And there was the gorilla throwing the,
the luggage around inside the cell.

521
00:28:22.071 --> 00:28:24.950
Vague memory.
Yes.
Yeah,
he played the gorilla.

522
00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.700
So that was one of my first,
like cool stories.

523
00:28:28.701 --> 00:28:32.000
He told me that was on the road with them.
I was like,
that was you on the suit?

524
00:28:32.001 --> 00:28:35.000
He's like,
yeah,
that was me.
It's good.
Get the fuck Outta here.

525
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:39.290
I'm with the fucking,
the gorilla suit guy throwing the,
uh,

526
00:28:39.291 --> 00:28:40.580
the luggage around.
So

527
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.460
<v 1>I was doing a scoring session for a movie and there was a standup bass guy.</v>

528
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.770
There's two standup bass guys,
actually.
One was younger,

529
00:28:46.771 --> 00:28:48.670
one was a little bit older and uh,

530
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:52.590
and they were doing this one solo piece for me.
We were in the mixing stage.
And,

531
00:28:52.591 --> 00:28:56.220
uh,
the younger I goes,
you've been know who this other guy is.
And I said,
no,

532
00:28:56.221 --> 00:28:59.670
I'm sorry.
You know,
I don't,
and the younger guy goes,
just show him,
just show him.

533
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.530
And the other guy was okay.

534
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:05.430
And he starts going [inaudible] noon to doon doon doon doon ended at any,

535
00:29:05.431 --> 00:29:08.190
had played the opening baseline for Nancy Sinatra as these,

536
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.140
<v 0>for walking the fuck.
Yeah.
It was incredible.</v>

537
00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.940
That was over at capital a that was in a cab.
But this was on a different,

538
00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:19.150
when we were at war at the time.
And,
and it was like,
Holy Shit.
And I was like,

539
00:29:19.151 --> 00:29:20.130
where did that come from?
He's like,
you know,

540
00:29:20.131 --> 00:29:22.510
I was just trying different things out.
We tried that and it worked.

541
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.890
And it's like,
that's one of the most iconic baselines.
You just shook his head,

542
00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.770
you shook the hand that played that and then every time just did it for me.

543
00:29:29.771 --> 00:29:33.520
It was great.
Yeah.
And every time you hear it,
um,
as always,

544
00:29:33.521 --> 00:29:36.910
I go on tangents on here.
So,
uh,
getting back to the movie,

545
00:29:36.911 --> 00:29:41.080
where can people see this?
Cause that was the thing that came onsite.

546
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.630
Well we came out in November.
This is the thing though.

547
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:45.310
It's not like no one saw it.
It's just,

548
00:29:45.311 --> 00:29:47.770
it hasn't been where people are gonna see it.

549
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.030
And I feel like what I'm starting to realize,

550
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.990
it was little as I know about this whole movie game,

551
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.220
is that people nowadays like to get them to go out to theaters.

552
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:01.000
It has to be like a big Aquaman's marble thing.
It's seams.

553
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.970
Or like get like a chick flick like that.
A star is,

554
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.620
<v 1>well,
it has to be an event of some kind to get you,
uh,
to get you out.
Let's,</v>

555
00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.050
it's expensive.
I mean,
look,

556
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:14.940
it's going to cost a fortune to go to the movies and uh,
uh,

557
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.240
and you have to have a real reason.
You want to want to go with people.
And,

558
00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:20.600
<v 0>and now the size of these frigging flatscreen TVs,</v>

559
00:30:20.601 --> 00:30:22.700
it's like you really do have like your own movie scream.

560
00:30:22.701 --> 00:30:27.320
No one's going to be talking.
You can hit pause.
So,
um,
this movie,

561
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:32.350
the front runner is a great one to sit down and watch without the distractions

562
00:30:34.671 --> 00:30:37.610
of going to the movie theater,
I think.
And,
and what I love,

563
00:30:37.611 --> 00:30:41.580
what I fucking loved about this movie when I finally saw it,
um,

564
00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:46.840
was how you don't do that fucking thing that I hate movies where you lead people

565
00:30:47.121 --> 00:30:51.110
around them.
Like you have a point.
Yeah,
I'm trying to make and you know,
and,

566
00:30:51.111 --> 00:30:54.350
and I'm gonna and you know,
if even have half a brain,

567
00:30:54.351 --> 00:30:57.320
you know what the point is as the movies starting and then you're going to hit

568
00:30:57.321 --> 00:31:00.290
me over the head with it for a half hour and a half,
two hours,

569
00:31:00.291 --> 00:31:04.670
your thing is just sort of like,
hey,
this happened and,
and you know,

570
00:31:04.671 --> 00:31:07.940
you can kindness.
It's not,
uh,
you know,

571
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.130
there's certain people that would have done that and had been like,

572
00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.270
and if he got elected,
I remember Walker,

573
00:31:14.271 --> 00:31:17.990
we're not an eye rack and all of America works out and it's just kind of like,

574
00:31:17.991 --> 00:31:22.340
no,
this fucking happened.
And ever since then,
um,

575
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:26.630
all this other stuff is happening and is,
is this,
you know,

576
00:31:26.631 --> 00:31:31.460
one of the questions that I was left with that is does this type of shit make

577
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.590
qualified?

578
00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:38.650
Probably better candidates not run because they have their priorities straight.

579
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:43.940
Like my family's more important than putting them through this shit.

580
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:45.560
And does it,

581
00:31:45.561 --> 00:31:50.450
does it more attract just a singularly focused almost.

582
00:31:50.451 --> 00:31:52.670
I don't want to use sociopath cause that's always overused,

583
00:31:52.671 --> 00:31:56.360
but like more of a psycho selfish fucking person where they're going to be like,

584
00:31:56.361 --> 00:31:57.970
yeah,
fuck I don't,
I'm not even thinking about it.

585
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.970
<v 1>My kids,
I want this.</v>

586
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.580
If you look at the difference between even like Gary Hart and Bill Clinton,

587
00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:04.530
Gary Hart was a guy who said,

588
00:32:04.531 --> 00:32:07.170
I'm just not going to dignify these questions and an answer.

589
00:32:07.171 --> 00:32:11.090
And Bill Clinton was a fighter and that's one of the reasons he became
president.

590
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.440
It's cause he's a guy who just fought back.
Uh,

591
00:32:13.441 --> 00:32:15.810
whether that's a good or bad quality.
But look,

592
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.860
I'm not a guy who believes in good or evil.
That's not why I make movies.

593
00:32:19.861 --> 00:32:21.840
So That's interesting to me.
So what is your

594
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.660
<v 0>cause I often think that,
you know,
we're like with religion that I grew up in,</v>

595
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:28.030
it's like if you do this,
you do this and didn't do this,

596
00:32:28.031 --> 00:32:30.940
you're going to hell unless you confess it,
but blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

597
00:32:30.941 --> 00:32:32.440
And then you have to be sincerely to confession.

598
00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:36.890
But I sit there and I like from my religion,
I always think I'm going to hell.

599
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.040
But then I look at my friends,
right?
And

600
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.040
<v 1>we've all roughly know your friends are roughly living the same life you do.</v>

601
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:47.840
I look at them and I think all of them are going to heaven.
We're all flawed.
And,

602
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.660
and look,
I love star wars as much as the next guy.

603
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.900
I Love Star Wars and I look forward to every star wars films.

604
00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:56.000
And those movies are all about good and evil.
Uh,

605
00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.820
and I appreciate superhero films.
But you know,

606
00:32:58.821 --> 00:33:01.560
so far the kinds of movies that I've been making have not been about good naval.

607
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:05.550
There've been about nuance even about people who live in the middle.
And,
and,

608
00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.750
and frankly,
I think that life is more complex than that.

609
00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:10.070
You can't judge a person,
any person by one moment,

610
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:14.960
but we are living right now in a time when everyone is judged by one moment

611
00:33:14.961 --> 00:33:17.540
they're judged by what a millisecond.
And you know,

612
00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:21.020
you say one wrong thing and the rest of your life is kind of thrown down the

613
00:33:21.021 --> 00:33:24.050
drain and we lose qualified people because of that.

614
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:29.080
And then I also love people who then pile on and use that person's fuck up is

615
00:33:30.651 --> 00:33:32.980
the way to show how awesome they are.
Oea,

616
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.830
exactly like the amount of people that have used these,
the,

617
00:33:35.831 --> 00:33:37.490
the victims of sexual assault,

618
00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:41.360
the amount of people who have used that as a platform to show how,

619
00:33:41.361 --> 00:33:44.750
I hate to use this word woke.
They are in like,
look,

620
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:48.620
I'm on the right side of this and I'm an ally.
And all those Dell that,
that,
that,

621
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.080
uh,
that jargon that has come out of that thing.

622
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:56.000
And you said something earlier about how,
um,
Gary Hart was,

623
00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:58.330
I'm not going to dignify that in,

624
00:33:58.331 --> 00:34:01.100
in somebody's personal life has done of their business.
I,

625
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.030
I've felt that my whole life and I still feel that.

626
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:10.090
And there's been times,
um,
you know,
someone's wanting to show me something.

627
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.800
It's just like,
dude,
that's,
that's none of my fucking business.
Especially,

628
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:17.030
you know,
like texting between two people in somebody,

629
00:34:17.031 --> 00:34:18.260
like somehow gets that.

630
00:34:18.261 --> 00:34:22.700
I always think like the story here is who got that and what a legal way they got

631
00:34:22.701 --> 00:34:26.050
that.
Like why did you,
or anytime in a shitty friend they are.
Yeah.
And why,

632
00:34:26.051 --> 00:34:26.960
why does anybody,

633
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:31.990
like anytime anybody gets arrested and that the TMZ somehow gets the Mugshot,

634
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:32.811
it's like,

635
00:34:32.811 --> 00:34:37.250
why isn't there an investigation to find out who's the cop that fucking let that

636
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:39.210
thing out?
And with a monk,
the monk.

637
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:44.660
And that's why we have so no,
but that,
no,
that's one of those things that,
uh,

638
00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:48.890
that is public,
but,
but you're right,
it,
that there's plenty that is,

639
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.000
uh,

640
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:54.170
that is nuanced and more complicated and it kind of gets thrown under the rug.

641
00:34:54.171 --> 00:34:57.200
And what's interesting about the heart story and why we made the front runner is

642
00:34:57.201 --> 00:34:59.480
it brings up 10 different conversations.

643
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:04.520
It's talking about and not only the relationship between journalists and

644
00:35:04.521 --> 00:35:06.500
politicians and why we vote for certain people.

645
00:35:06.501 --> 00:35:08.930
It's bringing up all kinds of gender politics questions.
Right.

646
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.040
That have changed since that moment.
And we're like,

647
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.720
what the idea of a whistleblower is because Donna Rice wasn't a whistle blower.

648
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.640
Nope.
Like it's easy to forget that,

649
00:35:16.641 --> 00:35:19.820
that there have been whistleblowers who are women who are bravely coming forward

650
00:35:19.821 --> 00:35:22.160
and talking about what kind of dirt bags they've dealt with.

651
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:25.280
Donna Rice was a private human being.
It's my religion.

652
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:29.750
Gary Hart and Donna Rice were two very religious people and very private people

653
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:31.610
who wound up in a very public moment.

654
00:35:31.611 --> 00:35:35.300
Cause we all thought it was our business when neither of them to this day have,

655
00:35:35.301 --> 00:35:38.010
have spoken about it.
Yeah,
I didn't even know

656
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.910
<v 0>that.
That's amazing.
Yeah.
Donna Rice never sold her story.
Best coach,
you know?</v>

657
00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.910
Then right there.
Then she's all right.
She's like a,

658
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:48.900
she's like a mobster who never told on the other mobsters and just went to jail.

659
00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:53.310
Is that a bad analogy?
Did I fuck up?
No,
no,
no.
Not at all.
I mean,
she's complex.

660
00:35:53.311 --> 00:35:57.410
I mean,
she's a,
it's interesting because,
uh,
uh,
I,

661
00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:01.440
I think there's probably a lot of liberals that went to s if they saw front

662
00:36:01.441 --> 00:36:02.070
runner,

663
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:05.700
they want to kind of take up the torch with Donna Rice and then they find out

664
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:09.600
that she's,
uh,
she's out in the right wing and she's actually,
you know,

665
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:10.550
pro life and she's,

666
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.490
I love when that happens through this soap and there's so many.
Do you know,
like,

667
00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:19.530
we know what blew my mind the other day was there was a story about a guy in New

668
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.850
York who killed this pregnant woman and,
uh,

669
00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:26.610
she was early on pregnant and you know,
I,
I forget because of sue,

670
00:36:26.611 --> 00:36:30.030
if some new abortion law they couldn't get,

671
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.110
they couldn't get them on two murders.
It was,
the whole thing was fucking weird.

672
00:36:34.111 --> 00:36:36.600
But the whole gray area in that,
I know,
I know.

673
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:40.320
I only have like half the fucking details here.
It was something about it.

674
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:45.210
She was pregnant.
This guy killed her and people were upset that that uh,

675
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.600
because of some new abortion law called the double homicide,

676
00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.590
you'd be saying that that is life in the womb and if it's life in the womb then

677
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:55.200
you cannot have an abortion because that would be murderer.

678
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:57.300
That's then it becomes this whole thing like,
okay,

679
00:36:57.301 --> 00:37:01.410
so if she wants to have an abortion then it's not a life.
So it's basically life.

680
00:37:01.411 --> 00:37:04.950
If the woman decides like I was sitting there like the amount of like mental

681
00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.760
flip flop and I was doing going like,
so what is going on?

682
00:37:08.761 --> 00:37:12.060
Like there was such like a a really,
you know,

683
00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:14.670
I mean obviously it's a horrible thing that happened,
but it was,

684
00:37:14.671 --> 00:37:17.250
it was interesting religiously,

685
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:21.750
legally and like social media way like politicizing Platt and I'm like how the,

686
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:26.730
well how the fuck do you navigate that minefield if you're pro choice.
Yeah.

687
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.360
Okay.
And you just say that has to feed assessed not a life,

688
00:37:30.361 --> 00:37:34.080
but if a guy comes in and kills somebody,
then now because she wanted to keep it,

689
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.350
then it is a life,
then it is the taking of life.
Then it becomes like,
well,

690
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:41.220
wait a minute.
So what do we fucking say in here saying,
Oh God,

691
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:44.550
I don't have to figure that kind of thing for a living,
like Q.

692
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.830
Imagine having to be the person who has to decide that.
No,

693
00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:50.550
because I'll be honest with you,
like my,
I have my opinions on abortion,

694
00:37:50.551 --> 00:37:53.520
but like I had,
I always preface them with like,

695
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:57.870
I have no fucking idea what the right answer is here because I look at it one

696
00:37:57.871 --> 00:38:00.780
way.
It's like,
well,
if,
if it's not the taking of a life than,

697
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:03.390
but if you didn't have that procedure,
they would have been another life,

698
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.670
you know,
barring a miscarriage or something like that.

699
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:10.440
So something was ended there.
But then on the other side,
you look at like,
uh,

700
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.380
you look at like the population control and like the way we're polluting the

701
00:38:13.381 --> 00:38:16.350
planet and how that's affecting all these other babies that are alive.
I mean,

702
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:21.410
I think there's like a million fucking ways that you can look at it.

703
00:38:21.991 --> 00:38:24.900
So I just sort of resigned it to,
uh,

704
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:29.340
like whatever somebody feels is so is the right thing to do.

705
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:34.470
If they're cool with that,
you know,
then then I'm,
I'm fine with it.

706
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.620
I have approached choice then.
I mean,
that's choice then because I mean,

707
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.520
what you're talking about is choice.
Cause I don't mind,

708
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.700
I wouldn't do it right to kind of do,
yeah,

709
00:38:42.701 --> 00:38:44.710
but you're talking about someone's right to choose themselves,

710
00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:46.790
which I agree with you about.
Uh,

711
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.830
people need personal freedom and I also don't like people telling me what the

712
00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:54.490
full,
but I don't mind that.
I don't mind.
Like,
you know,
I liked it.
His laws.

713
00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:59.110
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I don't take it to that level where I'm like,
murder bill.
I'm sorry.

714
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.690
Hey,
if you want to kill somebody and it's not me.
I mean,

715
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:03.700
who am I to say that that guy didn't deserve it?

716
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.130
No,
I'm all right.
Taking a little break here.

717
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:11.470
It's time for a little bit of advertising a,
by the way,

721
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:26.770
own bed.
Unbelievable.

Oh look who's here.
Everybody had sold zip

751
00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:28.360
hiring youth to be hard.
It sounds like an old man talking about his dick.

752
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.320
Multiple job sites,
stacks of resumes,

753
00:41:32.321 --> 00:41:34.100
a confusing review process.

754
00:41:34.101 --> 00:41:38.960
But today hiring can be easy and you only have to go to one place to get it

right experience and invite them to apply to your job.

760
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.710

Now it's time and now it's time to move on to our all time.

Favorite underdog's success story.

775
00:43:07.041 --> 00:43:12.041
Evidently MVMT movement watches founded on the belief that style shouldn't break

776
00:43:12.741 --> 00:43:13.460
the bank.

777
00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:18.460
They've sold almost 2 million watches worldwide by bringing quality designs and

778
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:20.960
a fair price movement.

779
00:43:20.961 --> 00:43:23.420
Watches are all about looking good while keeping it simple.

780
00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:28.010
They don't tell you how many steps you take in a blow your blow what or blow

781
00:43:28.011 --> 00:43:32.910
your wrist up with text messages,
parentheses you up.
Oh,

782
00:43:32.911 --> 00:43:36.130
the old booty call and the risks that,
uh,

783
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:39.270
let me funny if you're rubbing one out and then that came in,
it's like,
oh,

784
00:43:39.271 --> 00:43:40.440
I don't need to do this.
No,

785
00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.670
they're not overly intrusive on life with notifications,

786
00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:52.440
text messages,
emails,
et Cetera.
They tell time,
uh,

787
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:56.010
like true classic time pieces should looking good doing it.

788
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.170
Movement watches start at just 95 bucks.

789
00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:03.180
You're looking at $400 for the same quality from a traditional brand.
Uh,

790
00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:06.150
talk about all the things you can buy with the save money.

791
00:44:06.151 --> 00:44:09.600
What's the 400 minus nine?
It's $305.
Well,

792
00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:12.960
I didn't want to tell you what I first thought of.

All right,
let's get back to the interview here with the wonderful Jason Reitman.

803
00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:52.380
But anyway,
so now we didn't have any mentioned,

804
00:44:52.381 --> 00:44:55.110
where can people see this fucking amazing movie that you made with,

805
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:57.570
with Hugh Jackman and Vera Farmiga the two of them.

806
00:44:57.571 --> 00:44:59.370
I was watching this shit gone.
They're gonna get,

807
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:02.750
they're going to get nominated for something.
It's a fucking,
uh,

808
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.680
just weird time in,
in this business where a movie like yours,

809
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.340
it can,
can slip through the cracks in cinema.

810
00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:14.970
But the great thing though is it can now be on like a Netflix or something like

811
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:18.420
that and it can explode.
So it's not even like,

812
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.790
so the jury's still out as far as where it's self.

813
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.970
<v 1>Well,
it's on Itunes,
on iTunes.
Okay.</v>

814
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:28.080
You can get the DVD and it's a love letter to 1970 cinema.

815
00:45:28.081 --> 00:45:31.920
So if you happen to be a sinner file like me and you did that stuff and you did

816
00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:33.510
guys like Robert Altman and Michael Ritchie.

817
00:45:33.511 --> 00:45:36.570
I mean this is a love letter to their movies.
There's lots of these crazy long,

818
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:41.310
you know oners uh,
and uh,
I,
I love those shots because yeah,

819
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:45.640
<v 0>I feel especially with the way people edit now where they make everything look</v>

820
00:45:45.641 --> 00:45:49.330
like the fucking Bourne identity,
which works for the Bourne identity.
But yeah,

821
00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:54.160
I have this theory that when you edit really quick like that,

822
00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:58.000
it's like you're flipping through channels and it makes your brain reset,
reset,

823
00:45:58.001 --> 00:46:02.830
reset.
And where the long holding shots draws you in.

824
00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.280
Like I kind of learned that when I was first started doing standup specials,

825
00:46:06.281 --> 00:46:09.610
I would look at the old ones.
It'd be like,
why does this look so fucking real?

826
00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.910
And everything from today it looks fake now.

827
00:46:12.911 --> 00:46:15.640
Part of it was HD because you know,

828
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:18.300
HD can get like clearer than real life.
Yeah.

829
00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:21.580
Like you'd have on a blue like a soap opera.
Yeah.
Like your blue sweater.

830
00:46:21.581 --> 00:46:23.590
All of a sudden I'm just,
I'm not even listening to you.
I'm like,
God,

831
00:46:23.591 --> 00:46:26.650
look how blue his fucking sweaters,
you know?
Um,

832
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:30.820
but then the other thing was the pacing of it was just Bam,
Bam.

833
00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:32.470
Specially in the two thousands.

834
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:37.500
It was a really bad time for standup specials where there was just a lot of like

835
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:42.250
great comics where I heard the,
what I felt that the editing hurt the material,

836
00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:43.450
um,

837
00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:47.680
where you would just have directors just like just shooting if fucking load of

838
00:46:47.681 --> 00:46:51.370
every,
every camera.
I mean,
I watched his special,

839
00:46:51.371 --> 00:46:54.160
literally like a guy walking out to the microphone.

840
00:46:54.161 --> 00:46:57.710
The guy showed every camera he had rare.
We're in front of them,
were behind him.

841
00:46:57.711 --> 00:47:01.250
I'm at the top of the theater.
I'm swooping in the Jibs my favorite thing ever,

842
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:04.870
ever in,
in a,
uh,
in a standup special.

843
00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.080
Why am I swooping in to my shit show,

844
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:12.860
<v 1>right?
And nothing else and nothing makes me feel less like I'm in the audience.</v>

845
00:47:12.861 --> 00:47:16.040
Then I'm flying over the audience.
I hate that.
Yeah.
Well,

846
00:47:16.041 --> 00:47:19.610
we talked about the idea.
You brought the idea up to me was,
you know,

847
00:47:19.611 --> 00:47:24.440
could we shoot a comedy special on film?
Shoot it like an old rock doc.

848
00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:26.870
Yeah.
I mean I made a short,
uh,

849
00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:31.300
a short documentary on roast battle that they do up in the,
uh,
the bellows.
Yeah.

850
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:34.390
That gets crazy.
And uh,
and that was fun.

851
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:37.690
We shot a black and white and made it all grainy and it made it look punk rock.

852
00:47:37.691 --> 00:47:41.020
And I was,
that was a lot of fun.
You wake when people see of you,
put that out,

853
00:47:41.021 --> 00:47:43.360
you know,
I,
you know,
I've kept that one secret.

854
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:45.790
[inaudible] we brought it to Sundance and a played there.
And if I know someone,

855
00:47:45.791 --> 00:47:48.160
I'll just send them a link so they can watch it.
Cause I think it's really cool,

856
00:47:48.161 --> 00:47:51.700
but I don't know why I've kept that one.
Uh,
I've kept that one tight.

857
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:55.510
But that's something you,
you're gonna you'll use.
I don't know.
I just,
I just,

858
00:47:55.511 --> 00:47:58.780
I just,
uh,
well I love the roast bad.
I love what they do up there.
I love that.

859
00:47:58.781 --> 00:48:03.130
It's one of the few rooms that is just honest anymore.
Uh,

860
00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:06.580
when I go in and watch that and it's these tight room,
there's only hold,

861
00:48:06.581 --> 00:48:10.630
you know,
less than a hundred people.
And it's also,
it's Tuesday at midnight.

862
00:48:10.631 --> 00:48:15.020
So the only reason you're there is if you really need to be there.
And,

863
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:19.300
and it's the least prejudice room and most prejudice room I've ever been in my

864
00:48:19.301 --> 00:48:20.110
life.

865
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:24.700
<v 0>I actually,
I actually was there Tuesday night,
uh,
doing it,
running my hour,</v>

866
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:27.610
cause I'm going to be doing this taping a special.
And,
uh,

867
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:31.990
it's just one of those great comedy things where,
uh,
I forget her name,

868
00:48:31.991 --> 00:48:35.370
the woman who was running the show,
but she was great,
but it,
the,

869
00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:39.820
the crowd was very progressive as I should.

870
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:44.320
And that's in quotes because progressive just means think what we think or we're

871
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:46.690
going to attack you,
not progressive.

872
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:50.560
So I went up there and I was doing my shit and Oh my God,

873
00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:54.670
I was fucking bombing so bad for like the first 10 minutes before I kind of,

874
00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.530
you know,
got out of,
you know,

875
00:48:56.531 --> 00:48:58.870
it was making fun of Michelle Obama doing the arena tour,

876
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:03.630
which is just fucking hilarious to me.
Um,
and I knew that,

877
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.880
that they were all going to be,
and that got you the inspiration.
Uh,

878
00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:10.750
so I just had it so I was trashing her even harder.
But um,

879
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:14.410
it was just one of those things that makes the comedy store great and make stand

880
00:49:14.411 --> 00:49:16.120
up comedy great.
Where it's just like,

881
00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.750
like I was up there bombing and I was having the best fucking,

882
00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.890
like I was annoying the crowds so bad that there was a woman in the crowd

883
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:28.900
pretending to be asleep on her friend's shoulder like that was going to,
uh,

884
00:49:28.901 --> 00:49:32.290
I was getting under your skin.
I said,
oh my God.
And I loved it and I just kept,

885
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:37.320
I kept talking to her to the point she had to pretend to wake up and then I was

886
00:49:37.391 --> 00:49:40.810
critiquing her soap opera acting.
I was like,
okay,
now in this take,

887
00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:42.400
let's do it this way.

888
00:49:42.401 --> 00:49:47.020
And what's funny is I've been doing this shift for 27 years.
It's like,

889
00:49:47.021 --> 00:49:49.660
do you think that's the first fucking time so much?
I remember,

890
00:49:49.661 --> 00:49:52.870
I remember the first time that it happened to me,
the old Boston comedy club,

891
00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.750
and there was these two big black women in the front row.

892
00:49:55.751 --> 00:49:59.080
And one of them just like put her head down on the other one.
And,

893
00:49:59.081 --> 00:50:03.010
but this is the thing,
I was bombing during that set too,

894
00:50:03.011 --> 00:50:06.430
but I was bombing in a bad way.
I was bombing like,
I'm not funny.

895
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:11.830
The other night I was bombing like,
well,
you're not receptive to my material.

896
00:50:11.831 --> 00:50:16.150
And I know that.
So then I'm just going to go like even harder.

897
00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.830
<v 1>I saw you do this and before you and I met,
uh,</v>

898
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.880
and in a moment we should talk about our first conversation when you got to set,

899
00:50:23.881 --> 00:50:26.670
because I don't think you knew who I was.
I thought you was somebody else.

900
00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.040
It was just kind of amazing.
I

901
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.480
<v 0>was so bad.
It was amazing.
It made me so happy.
You have no idea.
So,
uh,</v>

902
00:50:32.481 --> 00:50:36.670
I thought you were going to be like,
why did I hire this guy?
What a fucking more,

903
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.290
I know.

904
00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:40.830
<v 1>Oh no,
he's spectacular.
So,
uh,
I saw you,</v>

905
00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:45.860
do you remember Tig Notaro had a show at Largo and you did that show and it was

906
00:50:47.941 --> 00:50:50.880
very similar.
I mean it was,
takes crowd and ticks,
brilliant.

907
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.830
And her crowd and she's one of my favorites,
one of my favorite audiences.
Uh,

908
00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:59.730
obviously it'd be very left wing and,

909
00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:04.050
and I watched you do this kind of set where you realized,

910
00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:05.213
oh,

911
00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:10.200
the audience is just so uncomfortable with anything other than leftwing
material.

912
00:51:10.201 --> 00:51:13.230
And because of that,
they don't know if they're allowed to laugh.

913
00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:17.580
And you just came right at the audience with fearlessly and with confidence.

914
00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:20.230
And uh,
it was a delight.
It was what's

915
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:24.590
<v 0>ticks fans?
They're not really violent.
So I,
there wasn't really wasn't,</v>

916
00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:29.230
I didn't have to be to fearless.
It'd be if it was a,
I was open at four a,

917
00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.800
I dunno,
a couple other comics I can think of.
They have a more aggressive,

918
00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.890
like I wouldn't,
I wouldn't be fearless in front of a Joe Rogan crowd.

919
00:51:35.891 --> 00:51:38.770
Cause I would figure a lot of them know that UFC stuff.

920
00:51:38.771 --> 00:51:42.580
And I would be afraid to piss somebody off in the crowd because those guys are

921
00:51:42.581 --> 00:51:43.890
no joke.
It takes audience.

922
00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:47.600
You're just to get a stern letter while they might end your career,

923
00:51:47.601 --> 00:51:50.200
if they might start a Hashtag,
if you say the wrong thing,

924
00:51:50.201 --> 00:51:52.150
I mean who I might get put on the sidelines.
I don't know.

925
00:51:52.151 --> 00:51:56.650
It's a really weird thing.
And this definitely,
um,
there's definitely,

926
00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:01.300
uh,
places that I go to now where it's just like good Lord.

927
00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.120
One of them is New York City.
I swear to God.
I mean really,

928
00:52:04.121 --> 00:52:08.410
if I go in on just a guest spot night,
if I go there to do a show,

929
00:52:08.411 --> 00:52:10.980
it's people who know me,
they know what they're getting and then,
you know,
it's,

930
00:52:10.981 --> 00:52:14.980
it's actually easy.
But if I go in and just pop in and do like,

931
00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:20.420
like I will never ever get over having a joke being groaned in New York City.

932
00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:25.910
It's like,
I'm just thinking like,
what the fuck happened in this play?

933
00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:29.830
The whole fucking place.
It's like a giant bed bath and beyond now.

934
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.580
It's so nice.
It's so much fucking cleaner.

935
00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:36.250
I Dunno where they put all those people because all of the,

936
00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:40.540
all of the social ills that created that they haven't solved.

937
00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.270
There's still drug addicts.
There's still prostitution.

938
00:52:43.271 --> 00:52:46.320
I just don't know what Rod,
they swept them underneath too.

939
00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.070
Cause I know it exists,

940
00:52:48.071 --> 00:52:51.640
but now everybody's walking around and like the fucking Truman show and you

941
00:52:51.641 --> 00:52:54.460
literally stand on stage and what fucking blows my mind.

942
00:52:54.461 --> 00:52:57.130
It's like I always say I'm sick.
I'm 50 years old.

943
00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.920
Like you guys should be shocking me.
You guys were all,

944
00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.520
you're acting like a bunch of old people on a fucking cruise ship.

945
00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:06.340
Like I'll be up in like,
oh,
you know,

946
00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:09.700
but what I love about that is only a fit.

947
00:53:09.701 --> 00:53:14.701
It fucks with their politics because since the beginning of my career,

948
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:19.090
you can say that a redneck has sex with his own sister and you will get an

949
00:53:19.091 --> 00:53:22.880
applause break and be carried out the fucking room.
And right there,
um,

950
00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:27.510
there's some sort of incest going there at some sort there is,
right.

951
00:53:27.511 --> 00:53:30.750
But that's totally fine because it's those people,

952
00:53:30.751 --> 00:53:32.520
you can say whatever the fuck you want about them.

953
00:53:32.521 --> 00:53:35.520
But then everybody over here is,
is courageous.

954
00:53:35.521 --> 00:53:38.880
And there were a warrior in a fucking,
I dunno what else they are.

955
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:42.320
<v 1>Well,
we're missing nuance right now and we're missing conversation and it's</v>

956
00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:45.100
absolutely good and evil now.
It is,
absolutely.
It's your,

957
00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:47.360
your side or my side and there's no real,

958
00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.730
<v 0>there's not enough Patrice O'Neil because I gotta be honest with you.</v>

959
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:55.680
Like if that guy was still around,
he was like,

960
00:53:55.830 --> 00:54:00.120
uh,
like sort of the comedy bouncer or policemen.

961
00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:04.260
And to the point there was like people who wouldn't work clubs that he was at

962
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.320
because,
and they would say,
because he's a bully,
he's a fucking asshole.

963
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:09.900
He was actually,
he was just trying to make you better.

964
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:15.180
And like the whole like,
I mean,
I,
I miss that guy,
you know,

965
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:18.480
at least once a week something will happen.
I'd be like,
Ah,
God,

966
00:54:18.481 --> 00:54:22.530
I wish I could hear what Patrice would've said about that.
And I can't,

967
00:54:22.531 --> 00:54:27.531
I can't fucking imagine what he would be thinking today with some of the shit

968
00:54:29.491 --> 00:54:33.870
that,
and some of the people that say it like the level of like,
I mean,

969
00:54:33.871 --> 00:54:38.010
I hope I'm not coming off as preachy cause I would never tell another comic or

970
00:54:38.011 --> 00:54:42.180
anybody what they should or shouldn't be saying.
You know,
if you asked my advice,

971
00:54:42.181 --> 00:54:45.300
I'd be like,
listen,
this.
And I always say,
this is how I did it.

972
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:48.630
And it worked out for me because with our business there is no,

973
00:54:48.631 --> 00:54:51.270
you start in the mail room,
right?
And then you get promoted here.

974
00:54:51.271 --> 00:54:54.870
It's like I always pictured it's a giant field and everybody's running in every

975
00:54:54.871 --> 00:54:56.760
different direction.
And some they,

976
00:54:56.761 --> 00:54:59.100
somebody you see somebody punched through whenever he's like,
oh,

977
00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:03.240
that's the direction in this fucking direction,
you know?
So,
um,

978
00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.170
<v 1>well you actually said something that I tell the young filmmakers all the time,</v>

979
00:55:07.171 --> 00:55:11.520
writers and directors,
uh,
and I find that when I meet young writers,
directors,

980
00:55:11.521 --> 00:55:15.180
and I have to imagine it's the same for comics,
that when you're young,

981
00:55:15.181 --> 00:55:18.750
you imitate the people that you admire.
In my first short films,

982
00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:23.340
all you would say is,
wow,
that guy really wants to be Quentin Tarantino.
I get it.

983
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:26.370
You Love Tarantino.
And then,
and then,

984
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:30.090
and after you imitate a bunch of the people that you like,
you,

985
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:34.980
you realize that you've been scared of saying something or writing sung or

986
00:55:34.981 --> 00:55:38.550
directing something in his way that the back of your head is telling you to do

987
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:41.970
it.
Yep.
And you're embarrassed to that voice.
And then,

988
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:46.710
and then every once in a while you start to lean into that voice and that's your

989
00:55:46.711 --> 00:55:48.360
voice.
And if you can,

990
00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:53.490
if you can stop being scared of it and stop imitating the people you like and

991
00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:57.120
actually start to grow a little bit of confidence with the way that you just

992
00:55:57.121 --> 00:56:01.350
naturally want it to say things,
that is the only way in a,

993
00:56:01.351 --> 00:56:04.370
it's the only authentic way.
And I think it kind of,
it,

994
00:56:04.371 --> 00:56:07.950
it's not only for any art form,
it's kind of any walk of life.
Uh,

995
00:56:07.951 --> 00:56:11.920
there's the moment you stop being scared of who you actually were born.
Um,

996
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:16.490
<v 0>you thought,
I always said that.
Every comic on an open mic,</v>

997
00:56:16.491 --> 00:56:21.170
walks in with their voice and then they get introduced and then that walk,

998
00:56:21.171 --> 00:56:25.060
they proceed to lose their voice and then try to find it because you go up
there,

999
00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:28.720
right.
And it's like before you got on stage,
I mean,

1000
00:56:28.721 --> 00:56:32.020
people ask you questions and you just answer them or at least amongst your

1001
00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:33.880
friends and you're totally yourself.

1002
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:36.850
But that is such an outer body experience on my God taking the Mick out of the

1003
00:56:36.851 --> 00:56:40.420
mic stand and then you're just totally self conscious and then it disappears and

1004
00:56:40.421 --> 00:56:41.770
then you'll,
you'll spend the next seven,

1005
00:56:41.771 --> 00:56:45.160
eight fucking 20 years trying to find it again.
How long did it take you?

1006
00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:46.790
Um,

1007
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:49.080
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1008
00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.650
<v 0>Hmm.
I would say</v>

1009
00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:54.360
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1010
00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.580
<v 0>I would say I don't,
it's a,</v>

1011
00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:57.480
<v 3>okay.</v>

1012
00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:02.010
<v 0>I Dunno,
somewhere in the two thousands I started to get it and then I,</v>

1013
00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:07.160
but I feel like since like 2011 2012 I've really been me.

1014
00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:10.410
Or maybe it's just,
but you also changed.

1015
00:57:10.411 --> 00:57:13.530
So a lot of times you look back at yourself 10 years ago and you can't relate to

1016
00:57:13.531 --> 00:57:16.540
yourself.
So maybe I was being me,
but that's just who I was then.

1017
00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:20.380
I don't really know,
but it was it how many years though?
All right.
So I,
I,

1018
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.400
you're looking at yourself and you're going,
oh,
I know who I'm pretending to be.

1019
00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:28.860
Well,
my thing,
I started in [inaudible] 92 and my thing was,
uh,
Brian Regan.

1020
00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:29.980
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1021
00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:34.540
<v 0>Uh,
and then Dave Attell was a huge one.
Dave,
Dave Louie.</v>

1022
00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.920
Um,
but I thought,
it's funny,
I didn't really,

1023
00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:43.250
like there wasn't anything about Louie where like he blew,

1024
00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:48.240
didn't have like this cadence that got into my head.
It was more his,

1025
00:57:48.450 --> 00:57:52.770
his presence when he came on to this day,
I'm at one to,
I always tell this story,

1026
00:57:52.771 --> 00:57:56.760
he went on at the Boston and it was like fucking like,
the show was just over.

1027
00:57:56.790 --> 00:57:58.650
It was like two in the morning.
It was fucking over it.

1028
00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:01.200
Nobody had even gotten a laugh and like 45 minutes,

1029
00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:05.430
everybody's just going up there bombing and he just walked on stage is that

1030
00:58:05.431 --> 00:58:10.020
booming voice and he did this exaggerated wave and it just went,
hello.

1031
00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:11.340
I can't even tell how we did it,

1032
00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:16.370
but it was so ridiculous and exaggerated and silly that he just sort of broke

1033
00:58:16.381 --> 00:58:20.550
them and they started like laughing and then he just went into his shit and

1034
00:58:20.551 --> 00:58:23.340
immediately started murdering and killing so hard.

1035
00:58:23.341 --> 00:58:28.230
You would have thought we all did a good job,
like keeping the show going.
Right.

1036
00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:32.430
And I remember seeing him do it,
Chappelle do it.
Dave Attell,

1037
00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:34.590
dewerd Greer Barnes,
all of these guys.

1038
00:58:34.591 --> 00:58:39.591
And that was the big thing as a comics being so scared of the village.

1039
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:41.630
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1040
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:44.440
<v 0>In the mid nineties where it was,
Giuliani had just taken over,</v>

1041
00:58:44.441 --> 00:58:48.700
just parked that police truck down in the fucking,
um,
Washington square park.

1042
00:58:48.701 --> 00:58:49.960
But it's like,
you know,
it's people like,
you know,

1043
00:58:49.961 --> 00:58:51.970
dealing drugs out front of it was like,
you know,

1044
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:54.430
the shit that people saw on the way to the show.

1045
00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:57.340
That's why the grounds in New York blows my mind because it used to be like,

1046
00:58:57.341 --> 00:59:01.990
what the fuck can I do to wake these people up after what they just saw on the,

1047
00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:03.490
just just getting to this club.

1048
00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:08.790
But I used to watch those guys and just watch them kill after everybody bombed

1049
00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:11.410
for like an hour and just two in the morning,

1050
00:59:11.411 --> 00:59:16.060
start killing like they were nine o'clock at night in a,
in a,
in a perfect spot.

1051
00:59:16.061 --> 00:59:18.730
And I remember just standing back there going,
how the fuck do you do that?

1052
00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:21.590
Like how,
how do,
how do you get to that level?

1053
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.840
<v 1>Um,
but anyways,</v>

1054
00:59:23.841 --> 00:59:26.480
I don't want to be sitting here talking about myself cause you have now your

1055
00:59:26.481 --> 00:59:30.590
next movie,
you don't gotta be directing the next star.
Ghostbusters.
Yeah.
Right.

1056
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:35.600
So now you're going from this,
this nuance thing that now you got to do this,

1057
00:59:35.601 --> 00:59:39.560
this franchise move.
By the way,
congratulations.
I mean that's,
that's a huge one.

1058
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:42.860
Well,
I mean,
and it's not just this last movie,

1059
00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:48.020
it's the last 20 years of my life.
I,
you know,
like any son of any father,

1060
00:59:48.021 --> 00:59:50.000
I just said,
I'm not going to be you.

1061
00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:54.320
And went out and became a Sundance film maker.
You know,
you know,

1062
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:58.940
I establish myself at Sundance.
I played that festival many times,
a short films.

1063
00:59:59.150 --> 01:00:01.890
I established myself as an independent filmmaker.
And,

1064
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.580
and that's who I really still see myself.

1065
01:00:04.581 --> 01:00:08.150
And if you would ask me anytime in the last 20 years,
you know,

1066
01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:12.420
are you going to direct the Ghostbusters movie?
My answer would've been no,
no,

1067
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:15.590
I'm an artist.
Yeah.
That's just not who I am.
That's my dad.

1068
01:00:15.591 --> 01:00:19.760
You must have me confused,
you know,
all that garbage.
And um,

1069
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:23.240
and I had an idea of how did id actually for a while it was just a cool way.

1070
01:00:23.241 --> 01:00:25.890
Who directed the first one?
My father.
Your father did,
I'm sorry.

1071
01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.040
I'm the worst dude.
Like all I know is sports.

1072
01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:32.060
So your dad directed the first one [inaudible] we started talking sports and uh,

1073
01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:37.030
all sound very ignorant.
But uh,
graduations on the super bowl.
I know that.

1074
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:37.460
Thank you.

1075
01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:41.990
I did a hell of a job watching all year waiting for my ring to show up.
But yeah,

1076
01:00:41.991 --> 01:00:46.580
my drag drag.
My Dad directed the first and second Ghostbusters.
So wait a minute.

1077
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:51.140
Did you,
um,
wait.
And they recently made another,
so this is the fourth one.

1078
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.200
He and my father produced,
uh,
the one that came out a couple of years ago.

1079
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.700
The one that Paul Feig directed.
Okay.

1080
01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:58.640
So has there ever been in the history of Hollywood,

1081
01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:01.340
a dad who directed a,

1082
01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:06.080
the beginning of a franchise and then his son comes along later and,

1083
01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:08.450
and,
and directs another one?
I don't know.

1084
01:01:08.451 --> 01:01:11.410
And there's a good question and I probably should know the answer to this.
Uh,

1085
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:15.320
and there's only so many kind of fog inside.
So basically right now,
okay,
you got,

1086
01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:20.150
uh,
Lawrence Kasdan is the guy who wrote empire strikes back,
uh,

1087
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.640
Raiders of the lost Ark and a,

1088
01:01:22.641 --> 01:01:25.730
and was actually a neighbor growing up and he has two sons.
Both are directors,

1089
01:01:25.731 --> 01:01:30.230
John and Jake.
Uh,
Jake most famously directed Jumanji John,

1090
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:34.340
uh,
cowrote the Han solo movie with his father.

1091
01:01:34.341 --> 01:01:36.740
So you'll have that is you got,
I saw that one,
that one,

1092
01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.820
I saw that on a plane and then,
and then Lawrence and his son,
right solo.

1093
01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:45.050
So you'll have that father son thing.
Uh,
other than that,
oh wait a minute.

1094
01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.720
That's just going to try.
Is it driver Adam driver?
Oh,

1095
01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:51.650
Adam driver out of drivers in the is in the kind of,
uh,

1096
01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:57.010
is in this edition of the Skywalker that the one I saw drivers in force awakens

1097
01:01:57.441 --> 01:01:59.360
Adam drivers.
And last Jad I they got,

1098
01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:01.130
I know you've got Carl Reiner and Rob Reiner,

1099
01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:05.540
but I don't think rob Reiner ever directed anything that his father established.

1100
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:10.310
Uh,
I dunno.
Maybe like Sofia Coppola does a godfather movie.

1101
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.290
I know,
but she was in one,
she was in the third one now.
Okay.
So,

1102
01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.090
but when do you know,
when do you,

1103
01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:20.370
when you're doing something that fucking

1104
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:22.950
<v 0>big [inaudible] like I just can't,</v>

1105
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:27.510
I'm like how far out do you have to start with to,

1106
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:32.020
to keep that fucking giant pizza dough in the air as far as like,

1107
01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.270
it's instantly the crazy thing.
Yeah.

1108
01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.340
<v 1>Is we have no time is we,
so I wrote the film in secret with my writing partner,</v>

1109
01:02:37.341 --> 01:02:37.881
Gil Canon.

1110
01:02:37.881 --> 01:02:41.750
We wrote it over the last year while we were finishing up front runner and we

1111
01:02:41.751 --> 01:02:44.630
turned it in December.
And I have to admit,

1112
01:02:44.631 --> 01:02:47.900
my presumption was it was going to be like any studio film that I had heard

1113
01:02:47.901 --> 01:02:52.040
about where they do years of rewrites and they grind it into the ground and it

1114
01:02:52.041 --> 01:02:52.851
never happens.

1115
01:02:52.851 --> 01:02:56.750
And I was kind of fully prepared for this year to be a year of maybe taking a

1116
01:02:56.751 --> 01:02:58.050
little time off and you know,

1117
01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:02.750
doing rewrites on Ghostbusters and instead this the studio read the first draft

1118
01:03:02.751 --> 01:03:07.340
and said,
yeah,
go make it.
Wow.
So we're,
I mean with,

1119
01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:11.480
with a very short runway,
we're going to be shooting,
uh,
you know,
the summer.

1120
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:14.360
Good Lord,
I ain't coming out the following summer.

1121
01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.330
How long will it take you to shoot something like that?
Uh,
I don't know.

1122
01:03:17.331 --> 01:03:19.910
I mean it'll take us a few months and then we'll be in post and for the first

1123
01:03:19.911 --> 01:03:24.470
time I'll have set pieces with visual effects and they'll be working with a

1124
01:03:24.471 --> 01:03:27.350
visual effects supervisor and you know,
visual effects houses,

1125
01:03:27.351 --> 01:03:28.550
they'll be crate and ghosts and things like,

1126
01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:29.660
<v 0>have you ever,</v>

1127
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:34.970
when you got into early on in your career as a director,

1128
01:03:34.971 --> 01:03:36.500
did you ever get into the edit room?

1129
01:03:36.501 --> 01:03:38.780
And realize you didn't have a shot you needed.

1130
01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:41.840
And then like what the fuck do I do now?
Like,
Oh,

1131
01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:46.480
<v 1>I've realized that on every single movie.
I mean,
you go into every single movie,</v>

1132
01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:47.200
uh,

1133
01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:52.090
thinking you know how to do this job and you get to the edit and it is

1134
01:03:52.091 --> 01:03:56.880
humiliating and depressing and you,
you watch that first cut of your movie.
And,

1135
01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.060
and I've had,
you know,

1136
01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:01.420
I've had movies that went on to be nominated for best picture.

1137
01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:06.310
And the first time I saw them I thought I will never get hired again.

1138
01:04:06.311 --> 01:04:09.010
No one will ever let me direct a movie again when they see this.

1139
01:04:09.490 --> 01:04:13.300
<v 0>Yeah.
Oh God.
I mean,
look the greatest,
because I would say as,</v>

1140
01:04:13.301 --> 01:04:16.600
as like an actor when I sit there and you know,
when you first start,

1141
01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:17.770
especially as a comedian,
you know,

1142
01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:22.810
you exist in realtime to 20 minutes and you're done in 20 minutes to then see

1143
01:04:22.901 --> 01:04:27.220
how long it takes to get 20 minutes of film is something,
uh,
I had to lie,

1144
01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.980
I got to get into a completely different mindset.

1145
01:04:29.981 --> 01:04:34.510
And when I saw like all of the shots,
not necessarily on your movie,

1146
01:04:34.511 --> 01:04:37.890
cause I thought I liked the pace you worked at there.

1147
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:39.360
There's been a couple ones that I've,

1148
01:04:39.361 --> 01:04:44.361
I've worked in where there's shooting so much stuff I'd find lasic why would

1149
01:04:45.521 --> 01:04:45.840
they do,

1150
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.840
and then I finally just put myself into the director's brain and I was like,

1151
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:51.251
oh,

1152
01:04:51.251 --> 01:04:56.050
I bet every one of them early in their career went into the edit room,

1153
01:04:56.051 --> 01:04:58.840
didn't have the shot,
and that like fucking haunts them.

1154
01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:00.880
So I feel like they get in there,

1155
01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:05.620
they get everything that they want and then then like,
then they start going,

1156
01:05:05.621 --> 01:05:10.480
okay,
all right,
what were,
how could this fuck me,
you know?
All right,
let's,

1157
01:05:10.481 --> 01:05:13.810
let's not,
no,
now let's do like a tracking thing and all that type of stuff.
So,

1158
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:16.960
and ever since I've,
I've,
I did that,
I kind of,

1159
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.820
it's like I understand the madness of it because I was doing,

1160
01:05:21.821 --> 01:05:26.380
what most people do initially was I was in my own head looking at my own head,

1161
01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:29.110
like,
why isn't this going the way I would do it?

1162
01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:32.260
Even though I don't understand what's going on.

1163
01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:37.240
Like I just recently did an acting gig and for the first time ever I finally it,

1164
01:05:37.330 --> 01:05:42.280
I don't know what happened.
It all came together.
Like I got it.
I'm like,
okay,

1165
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:43.750
the shooting the master,

1166
01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.620
now they're doing this over and now they're going for a two shot and I could

1167
01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:50.690
kind of,
and then I started being like an actor going like laid back.

1168
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:52.330
They're not going to be on me.
I mean they're on me,

1169
01:05:52.331 --> 01:05:56.710
but they're not going to use this.
Yeah.
So you know,
make sure this one,

1170
01:05:56.711 --> 01:05:59.960
now this is one that they're going to go to.
So make sure this and the,

1171
01:05:59.961 --> 01:06:04.360
I never had that.
I was just always out there,
you know,
paging Mr. Herman.

1172
01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.330
There's to her made you have a phone,
call it the front now I would be,

1173
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.930
I would be doing my clothes up.
Acting on the fucking wide.
Yeah,

1174
01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:13.880
it's throughout the whole fucking thing.
And I,

1175
01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:15.820
and that would be working with these actions going like,

1176
01:06:15.821 --> 01:06:17.440
this guy doesn't even look like he's fucking trying.

1177
01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:20.890
And then all of a sudden that they'd be over me and all of a sudden like,
boom,

1178
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:25.840
fuck is that guy.
And I was like,
what is going on here man?

1179
01:06:25.841 --> 01:06:29.480
This guy is like a fucking,
and he's like a skitzo or something.
Um,
I it,

1180
01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:32.530
this last one that I just did it all.

1181
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:36.700
It all came together and,
and I,
and I ended up,

1182
01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:38.500
I got it and I got,

1183
01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.580
I finally understood what I was supposed to be doing and how I could help the

1184
01:06:42.581 --> 01:06:47.560
director and everybody else.
And,
and I ended up having the best fucking time.

1185
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.000
I'm,
even though I bitched about it a little bit,
a cup,
not even a little,

1186
01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:54.610
just every night.
Like Jesus Christ,
12 hour fucking days.
I'm a comedian.

1187
01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.420
I work one hour,
one hour days.

1188
01:06:58.510 --> 01:07:02.380
<v 1>I found that actors generally break down into two groups and there's actors who</v>

1189
01:07:02.381 --> 01:07:05.470
are 100% aware of everything that's happening around them.

1190
01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:09.490
And then there's actors who have no idea what's happening around them.

1191
01:07:09.491 --> 01:07:10.930
And they're both valuable,
right?

1192
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.720
Actors who are kind of puppeteering themselves and know where the camera is and

1193
01:07:13.721 --> 01:07:16.600
note the lending is going to do.
And you know,
Clooney's like that.
Clooney,

1194
01:07:16.601 --> 01:07:19.720
you know,
uh,
who was a director himself will literally be like,

1195
01:07:19.721 --> 01:07:22.540
so you want me to bring my right shoulder in and I'm going to look this way and

1196
01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:26.410
when I look all,
you know,
I'll keep that one look.
And what Lens are you on?
Oh,

1197
01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:29.320
you're on a 50.
Okay,
great.
I'll look that one.
And he knows the whole thing.

1198
01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:32.890
And then I've have actors who are equally talented,

1199
01:07:33.010 --> 01:07:35.210
but like if I had an actress,
uh,

1200
01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:40.000
exceptional actress who mid scene I had to cut and I said,
you know,

1201
01:07:40.001 --> 01:07:42.160
you can't stand there.
And she said,
why?
I said,

1202
01:07:42.161 --> 01:07:45.760
you standing right in front of the camera.
I had no idea.

1203
01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:48.000
Literally it was just blocking leverage had just stopped.

1204
01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:51.030
<v 0>But there's a brilliance to that cause there's so lost in what they're doing.</v>

1205
01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.610
So then you have to adjust it when I can,
if I can capture it.

1206
01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:55.200
<v 1>The best scenes when you have one of each.</v>

1207
01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:58.920
I find you have one actor who knows everything that's going on and you've got

1208
01:07:58.921 --> 01:08:01.140
the other who's wild and it's like,

1209
01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:04.350
it's like you have one dance partner who's keeping time and keeping the foot

1210
01:08:04.351 --> 01:08:05.010
work.

1211
01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:08.190
And the other one who's just pushing them and it was just a theory will and it's

1212
01:08:08.191 --> 01:08:11.070
going to give you stuff you would have never thought of that.

1213
01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.910
<v 0>I probably don't want to know any more of this cause then it'll all be in my</v>

1214
01:08:13.911 --> 01:08:15.710
head the next time I do it.
It's something that

1215
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.980
<v 1>I want to hang out with.
You got to explain that Lens thing cause I've,</v>

1216
01:08:18.981 --> 01:08:23.570
I've heard a few actors,
what are you on a 50 all right,
so you're right,
right.

1217
01:08:23.571 --> 01:08:27.560
Like they know like the whole thing,
I'm like I,
it's,
it's oddly so simple.

1218
01:08:27.561 --> 01:08:32.140
I mean it really is just one shows a lot in one shows less and one has more and

1219
01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:32.600
focused in,

1220
01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.830
one has less and focus and they make you feel different things and that,

1221
01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.650
and that's just it.
So when you talk about all the things that directors,

1222
01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:41.180
there's an art to all of that.
Well you're,
you're,

1223
01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:44.510
you're either someone who is sensitive or not.
You're either someone,

1224
01:08:44.511 --> 01:08:45.950
and I think the same goes for a comic.

1225
01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.770
You're either someone who sends it enough to know,
oh,
when I say this,

1226
01:08:48.771 --> 01:08:50.240
it makes the room feel like this.

1227
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:53.900
It makes them laugh in this way versus that way.
And when I use this word,

1228
01:08:53.901 --> 01:08:57.770
it makes them laugh in this way versus that way.
And over time you get to,

1229
01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.170
you know,
I mean very rarely,

1230
01:09:00.171 --> 01:09:03.410
but you get to someone as talented as yourself who has an opening,

1231
01:09:03.411 --> 01:09:06.440
say you later and idea that they're going to start with.

1232
01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:08.510
But from there on,

1233
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:11.720
you're figuring your way out and you're reading a room and you're sensitive to

1234
01:09:11.721 --> 01:09:15.080
it.
And the same way a director is sensitive to,
all right,
if I light it this way,

1235
01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:16.430
it'll make the audience feel this way.

1236
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:19.430
If I cut it this way or use this music could use this shot,
uh,

1237
01:09:19.431 --> 01:09:24.110
all the day down to kind of my new details.
And your,

1238
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:28.940
your ability to grow as a filmmaker is your sensitivity matched with kind of

1239
01:09:28.941 --> 01:09:32.320
growing technique?
Right.
Well,
last question I'll ask you.
All right.

1240
01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:34.040
Thank you so much for coming on.

1241
01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:37.630
This has been fascinating listening to all how all of this sludge to be here.
Um,

1242
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:41.780
so with the ghostbuster movie,
yeah,

1243
01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:46.670
I would imagine that there's this whole thing where you have to be loyal to the

1244
01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:50.330
look,
the vibe and the fans of the previous,

1245
01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:53.960
and then you also have to want to put like your stamp on it.

1246
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:58.940
So how is this like a Hacky fucking junket question?
Like,
no,
no,
not at all.

1247
01:09:58.941 --> 01:10:03.590
And this is knocking.
I'm not making the Juno of Ghostbusters movies.
Uh,
uh,

1248
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:04.490
once again,
I don't know.

1249
01:10:04.491 --> 01:10:08.570
That reference was super bowl of movies that I said Daddy,
that's that,
that,

1250
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:13.190
that's probably my most famous movie.
Like my obituary will say,
uh,

1251
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:16.130
Jason Reitman son of Ivan Reitman,

1252
01:10:16.131 --> 01:10:19.910
director of Ghostbusters also directed Juno.
That will be my,

1253
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:23.690
that's how my obituary starts.
Uh,
is that your biggest movie?
Yeah.

1254
01:10:23.691 --> 01:10:26.420
And it was this kind of movie that we made for nothing was a movie that we made

1255
01:10:26.421 --> 01:10:29.900
for like $7 million and grossed like $200 million.

1256
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:33.400
And so you made like 30 grand on that note.

1257
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:36.410
I made nothing cause it was my second movie and I literally had nothing on it.

1258
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:39.580
But they always gets you a studio,
made a fortune on that movie.

1259
01:10:39.610 --> 01:10:40.910
They did really well.

1260
01:10:40.911 --> 01:10:45.260
And it was the launching of Ellen page in Diablo Cody wrote it.
And uh,

1261
01:10:45.261 --> 01:10:49.760
and really use the reason why I have a career.
Um,
but um,

1262
01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:54.710
anyhow,
uh,
this is going to be a love letter to Ghostbusters.
I,

1263
01:10:54.711 --> 01:10:57.530
um,
I love this franchise.
I grew up watching it.

1264
01:10:57.531 --> 01:10:59.570
I consider myself the first Ghostbusters fan.

1265
01:10:59.571 --> 01:11:02.390
I was like seven years old when that movie came out.

1266
01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:05.300
And uh,
and I love it.

1267
01:11:05.301 --> 01:11:07.700
And I want to make a movie for my fellow Ghostbusters Fan.

1268
01:11:07.701 --> 01:11:11.690
So it is all a hundred percent sense.
Yeah.
And,
and we're doing it in the style,

1269
01:11:11.691 --> 01:11:14.880
like we just did this teaser for it that we launched when we announced it.

1270
01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:16.470
And even in that,

1271
01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:21.600
we went back to the work files for the sound of the proton pack and we went back

1272
01:11:21.601 --> 01:11:24.350
to the stems of Elmer Bernstein score,
uh,

1273
01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:27.090
for just where it says at the end of the teaser it says like,
you know,

1274
01:11:27.091 --> 01:11:28.350
summer 2020,

1275
01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:32.250
we went back and found the original like physical vinyl letters that they use to

1276
01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:36.960
create the Ghostbusters poster in 1984.
Oh,
rescan them.
Then,
uh,

1277
01:11:36.961 --> 01:11:40.320
our titles guys reprinted them and we filmed,

1278
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.390
the title's not like in a computer.

1279
01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:46.170
We shot physical titles with a light and smoke effect because that's how they

1280
01:11:46.171 --> 01:11:47.250
would have done it back in the day.

1281
01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:52.210
So we are in every way trying to go back to original technique and,

1282
01:11:52.211 --> 01:11:55.110
and make a and hand the movie back to the fence.

1283
01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.400
<v 0>That's awesome.
Well,</v>

1284
01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:00.080
I'm looking forward to seeing that and everybody can see the front runner on

1285
01:12:00.081 --> 01:12:02.480
iTunes.
Uh,
where else did you say it was available?

1286
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:06.350
<v 1>I mean anywhere you'd normally go,
go,
go buy a blu.
I go watch and iTunes.
Uh,</v>

1287
01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.810
and particularly if you're someone who doesn't like being told what to think,
um,

1288
01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.050
here is kind of a rare movie of new,

1289

<v 0>yeah.
I love it.
