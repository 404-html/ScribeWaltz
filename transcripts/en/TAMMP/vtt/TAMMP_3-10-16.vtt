00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.690
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn is time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.691 --> 00:00:07.330
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
Dan.

3
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.130
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.080
<v 1>Just checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on your,
hello.</v>

5
00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:20.920
This is Susan Blues teen calling.
Um,

6
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.890
what's a character is to,
is to call up a buddy of mine all the time.

7
00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:27.940
We pretend to be his casting director and I would just call them up with the

8
00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:32.260
worst fucking auditions.
Every,
hello,
this is Susan Bloomstein called link.

9
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.880
I haven't no audition for you with for a feature.

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.640
Do you have a problem with being naked around other men in positions that

11
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:47.340
involves,
she's staring at your ankles.
If you have a prop,
if not,

12
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:51.270
give me a cool stupid shit like that.
It was always like,
you know,

13
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.570
something that I guess would be considered homophobic as instead of just being

14
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:56.340
funny,
you know,

15
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.110
is it a homophobic to suggest that he would be uncomfortable staring at his

16
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:03.480
ankle ankle,
so I should say,

17
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.610
and the company of other men,
I don't know what's going on.
How was your Thursday?

18
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.380
Did she get paid today?
Huh?

19
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.130
Did they write some numbers on a piece of paper and then you stuck it in a

20
00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:20.050
machine and somehow you can get waffles.
It's in the air,
man.

21
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.960
All the money's in the air now.
I don't know where it is,
you know,

22
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.470
safe to say either.
Some white dude has all of it.
Russian dude,
which has guests.

23
00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:34.060
It is a white tube,
but white dude means American dude,
right?
Or English,
right.

24
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.130
Russian dude or Chinese dude.
One of them's got it.

25
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.220
Maybe somebody in Singapore has all the money with Japanese guy.

26
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.550
Then of course you've got the fucking Saudi princes.

27
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.670
They got something like six people have it all right now.

28
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:50.220
And the rest of us just get pieces of paper with numbers on it.

29
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.420
But as long as we believe in it,
no matter what they say on TV,

30
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.760
no matter how bad they say it's getting,

31
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.390
as long as we just continue to fucking believe in it,

32
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.410
just keep writing numbers to each other.
Right.
Next thing you know,
I got a shirt.

33
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.620
You got a Taco?
Everybody's happy.

34
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.840
Susan Blumenstein Corley.
Um,

35
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.540
anyways,
uh,
so here's what's going on with me.
Last night.

36
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.070
Me and the lovely Nia,
my beautiful,

37
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.920
we went down and saw a Iggy pop.

38
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.240
He has a new album out the postpartum depression and um,

39
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.650
basically like 90% of Queens of the stone age was backing him up.

40
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.570
John Theater was not on drums,
um,
but it was pretty much,

41
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:43.450
I think the rest of the band and Iggy pop came out.

42
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:46.210
It was fucking amazing show.
I'd lucked into these tickets.

43
00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:50.350
I was doing a comedy show.
I ran into somebody that works for the band.
They said,

44
00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:52.630
we've got an a couple of extra to tickets.
Do you want to go?

45
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:55.450
My freckles stood up at attention and of course I went,

46
00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.540
I went down there and God damn it,
what an amazing show.
Silverman opened up.

47
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.430
She fucking crushed it and hey,
the pot man,

48
00:03:05.431 --> 00:03:06.450
there's a bucket list,
right?

49
00:03:06.451 --> 00:03:10.410
Their bucket list one to go see the guy fucking comes out there,
right?

50
00:03:10.411 --> 00:03:14.460
He's got on a sports coat with no shirt underneath of the 68 years old.

51
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.620
All right.
After one song,

52
00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:19.860
the code is gone and he's prancing around with no shirt on.

53
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.660
68 years old.

54
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.330
With some fucking shit guy just doesn't give a fuck.
I'm going to fuck,

55
00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:30.540
I'm going to post a picture of the guy.
You know what I mean?

56
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.690
He's still in great shape,
you know?
Sure.
There's a little,
uh,

57
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.110
less density issues here or there with the skin,
but I mean,
other than that,

58
00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:39.540
the guy looks like he can do more pushups than I could ever do.

59
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.600
I hope I look that good at his age.
You know,

60
00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:45.630
when he stills got that beautiful Marsha Brady fucking haircut.

61
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.290
Gorgeous hair.
Oh God.
I was jealous.
Um,

62
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.880
anyways,
the band absolutely fucking smashed it.

63
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.470
He was all over the stage.
Um,
it was,

64
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:05.190
it was fucking incredible,
man.
It was just a,
just an absolutely amazing night.

65
00:04:05.191 --> 00:04:08.970
And then me and Nia finished it off as much as I'm trying to get in shape.

66
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.080
One of the great things to do out here in Los Angeles has to hit your favorite

67
00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:17.860
fucking Taco truck.
Oh,
late night taco spot.
Um,

68
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.400
it's just the best.
And there was one,
uh,

69
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.450
I got a buddy of mine could another comedian for Shaw who's like a connoisseur

70
00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:26.510
of all the taco trucks.
I was basically like,
I,

71
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.550
I went down just east of the fucking one west of the one 10,

72
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.050
um,
you know,
and like Beverly Boulevard,
what do you got?
And He fucking,

73
00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:38.940
he gave me like three taco trucks,

74
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.410
like Google mapped all the way back to my house and we ended up stopping off at

75
00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:47.970
one and a,
Oh fuck.
I didn't get any Tacos,

76
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.440
actually got a Goddamn case of Dia,

77
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.520
which is the classic default White Guy Order at a taco truck.

78
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.320
You know,
can I get a check in case?
Can I get one of them?

79
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.050
I'll be technically,
he was sad.
Even Mexican.
It's just,

80
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.420
chase would check in,
hey,
are we do that?

81
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.290
It was just a,
a,
a,
a great night.
And um,

82
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.430
another night where I didn't smoke a cigar.

83
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.330
I haven't smoked a cigar since February 16th.
And,
uh,
you know,

84
00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:22.160
you have a problem with something when you know the exact date,
you know of,

85
00:05:22.161 --> 00:05:26.210
uh,
when you stopped doing it,
you know other shit.
If you just don't give a fuck,

86
00:05:26.211 --> 00:05:29.510
he just like,
you want to go to Mcdonald's?
Yeah,
no.

87
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.750
Was the last time you ate there?
Oh,
I don't know man.

88
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:37.670
I spent a while we'll get a year.
That's when you don't have a process.
That's,

89
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.550
that's when,
if there was an issue of addiction,

90
00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:42.380
it's just completely out of your fucking life.

91
00:05:42.381 --> 00:05:46.760
But I know the exact date was February 16th.
I know where I was.

92
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.150
I know what I smoked and I know what I felt like when I had it and I've been

93
00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:53.150
thinking about it every fucking day.
And um,

94
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.040
I'm trying to go on a little bit of a run here because if a,

95
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.800
if I don't cut the shit out of my life this summer,
I will be a four year smoker.

96
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.490
Like what the fuck?
What am I doing?
Um,
so,

97
00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:09.970
but I've been holding fast with these uh,
fast are holding strong,

98
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.990
whatever the fucking expression is.
I only have two a month.
Alright.

99
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.390
I two in January,

100
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.220
two and a half in February because I started smoking when it wasn't lit well,

101
00:06:21.221 --> 00:06:25.060
and I've got another one so I had one and a half that nice.
That's not bad.
Right?

102
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.540
Come on.
You guys aren't doctors generally speaking?
I should be.
All right.

103
00:06:28.541 --> 00:06:33.430
My body can handle that two and a half fucking days.
I mean two and a half,

104
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:34.623
two a month.

105
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.520
Once every 14 days and it's still fucking stupid.

106
00:06:39.521 --> 00:06:43.930
Maybe I'll just go down to one a month.
I want to be special occasion guy.

107
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.360
I figured I'll smoke one at the rose bowl smoke once,
Superbowl Sunday,

108
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.800
my birthday.

109
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.760
<v 3>Uh,</v>

110
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.690
<v 1>we don't,
she got flagged day then.
I don't give a fuck about that.</v>

111
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:00.530
<v 3>Okay.</v>

112
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.520
<v 1>It's bunch of Jewish holidays in
September.</v>

113
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.330
I am in show business as a nod to them.
That'd be really selfish.

114
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.700
Like I give a shit,
right?
Like I give a shit about,
you know,

115
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.650
like I'm actually acknowledging another religions.

116
00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:18.250
The real reasons I not just looking for an excuse to smoke a cigar
tall,

117
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.220
my Jewish brothers and sisters out there and the sign of support.

118
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.660
What are you going to deal bill?
Ah,
make a donation to the museum of tolerance?

119
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:27.231
No,

120
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:32.231
I am going to smoke a Cuban cigar and honored to all of your wonderful

121
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:37.480
contributions to comedy and Shell business.
Um,

122
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.670
<v 3>okay.</v>

123
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.950
<v 1>Like for a year,
that would be perfect.
Right?</v>

124
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:45.640
There's not a fucking doctor on the planet.
They always got a day.

125
00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.950
Always get there.
Their job is just a rain on your parade.

126
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.040
I saw if I went in and say,
doc,
look,
I smoked for a year.
Is that bad?

127
00:07:53.041 --> 00:07:56.010
And be it,
you know why?
You know it's,
you know,
it's not bad,
but they always go.

128
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.220
Ideally.
Yeah.

129
00:07:59.221 --> 00:08:04.221
Ideally I'd live in a fucking bubble and I would be breathed perfect fucking air

130
00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:07.620
and drink clean water and I have um,
a microbiome.

131
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.560
What the fuck are you doing doc?
You gotta be doing something

132
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.160
going in here,
taking everybody's blood pressure.

133
00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:17.880
All God Damn Day looking at fucking skin tags should telling me you don't have

134
00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:18.714
an outlet.

135
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.123
<v 3>MMM.</v>

136
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.350
<v 1>I don't know.
So anyways,
having said all of that,
probably smoke what next week,</v>

137
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.940
but I liked this month,

138
00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:32.140
this month is going good because um,

139
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.700
you know,
I've already like,
you know,

140
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.420
the first two months of the year I really feel like I shook my hand should be

141
00:08:39.421 --> 00:08:43.170
shaking as I'm talking about this as sub Adam on a smoke.
I uh,

142
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.390
I had my first one January 1st and then January 8th I had the second one.

143
00:08:48.391 --> 00:08:49.290
I was like,
fuck,

144
00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:52.680
the month isn't even half over and I got a white knuckle it the rest of the way

145
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.050
and then I did it again in February.

146
00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:59.270
I smoke more on like the fifth and then one on like this I guess the 16th then I

147
00:08:59.271 --> 00:09:00.730
got another two fucking weeks.

148
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.870
So now I feel like I'm ahead of the game cause it's like the 10th.

149
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.160
If I can just make it to like the 50th,

150
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:08.703
<v 4>you know,</v>

151
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.360
<v 1>then I can actually go on a run and do one every week for four weeks.</v>

152
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.730
Then white knuckle it to April.
Uh,
just sucks.

153
00:09:18.731 --> 00:09:22.030
How come everything fun fucking kills you.
You know,

154
00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.670
just fucking kills you sitting around Eating Goddamn yogurt by the way.
You know,

155
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.600
I figured out what was causing the train,
not the lead,
the fucking station.

156
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.790
I became all Billy Parfait,
right?

157
00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:34.450
And I went down to this shoe shop and they will fucking raving about this.

158
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:39.200
You know,
this all natural yogurt with coconut in it.
You know,

159
00:09:39.201 --> 00:09:42.880
all that probiotic has probiotics in it.
This is,
you know,

160
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:47.380
this isn't negative by,
this is positive pro.
This is proactive.

161
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.880
You have two kinds of bacteria within your intestinal track.
Shut the fuck up.

162
00:09:51.881 --> 00:09:54.480
I put this stuff in them.
I couldn't,
I couldn't ship the days.

163
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.540
I just kept beating it cause they're that doubted the juice shack there.
Right.

164
00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:01.320
They kept telling me how healthy it was and a little did it.

165
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:04.000
Little did I know I was building like a fucking wall.

166
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.620
You know what's said city there in Greece with all,

167
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.010
it's the whole city is just a bunch of white walls,
you know?

168
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.210
That's what I was building in my stomach.
Where you built?
I don't know.

169
00:10:16.211 --> 00:10:19.240
It's the first thing I thought of.
Hey,
go fuck yourself.
You know,

170
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.110
I'd like to see you not shit for three days and try to dance around it and keep

171
00:10:23.111 --> 00:10:27.340
it funny.
Okay.
How did they get this mood?
Um,

172
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.790
anyways,
hold on one second.
Hold on.
Nancy Reagan died.
Everybody.

173
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.730
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

174
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.210
<v 1>she died and a lot of people were really upset about that.
You know,</v>

175
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.910
she was a great woman.
I'll tell you what made her great.

176
00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.890
Now the shape she kept herself in,

177
00:10:42.891 --> 00:10:45.620
considering her husband had jelly beans all over the fucking place.

178
00:10:45.621 --> 00:10:49.190
The fact that she could just say no to those goddamn things,
right.

179
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.450
She's walking around.
There's something about being that skinny though.

180
00:10:53.451 --> 00:10:56.240
After a while though,
it's just like you live for fucking ever,

181
00:10:56.241 --> 00:10:58.160
but you just get like a bird person.

182
00:10:59.070 --> 00:10:59.903
<v 4>You know?</v>

183
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.460
<v 1>Like if she was my,
uh,
grandmother,</v>

184
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.760
I would have built like a giant birdcage said that hung from the ceiling and

185
00:11:06.761 --> 00:11:09.430
he's just me.
I'd make it go in there and purchase on it.
You know,

186
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.010
I'm not opening the door unless you tell me.
I'm still in the,

187
00:11:12.011 --> 00:11:17.011
well Nancy or I guess I would say grandma Reagan's Greg and um,

188
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.150
all right.

189
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.780
This is why there's this whole podcast is gone off the fucking rails so too,

190
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.200
God damn distracted him talking about putting dead first ladies and birdcages.

191
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:29.380
That's not right is it?
He's such a weird fella that Reagan,

192
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.340
some people you talk to,
he single handedly defeated the Russians.

193
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.000
The reality is did he come off the fucking bench and he did.

194
00:11:37.001 --> 00:11:41.860
He hit the last three.
You know the dagger.
He put the game away.
I would say,

195
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.713
<v 4>you know,</v>

196
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.940
<v 1>by tricking them into thinking that we were actually going to have shit up and</v>

197
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:50.490
out of space to stop this shit from coming over here.

198
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.303
<v 4>You know,</v>

199
00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:54.020
<v 1>that's the weird</v>

200
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.020
<v 4>thing about trying to bomb somebody from the other side of the fucking world.</v>

201
00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.500
If you're too lazy to fly over,
you got to start.
You got to shoot them.

202
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.770
Remember Robert Parish,
his foul shot and you know it was a rainbow.

203
00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.910
That's how you got to do it.

204
00:12:04.911 --> 00:12:07.850
You actually got to send it in because of the curvature of the earth.

205
00:12:07.851 --> 00:12:11.590
You got to send it fucking up and over.
You know what I mean?
It's like when you,

206
00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:16.160
you're sitting on the couch and you got a Napkin and you want to throw it into a

207
00:12:16.161 --> 00:12:18.540
barrel,
but you'll fucking office chair.
It's right there.
You,

208
00:12:18.541 --> 00:12:23.490
you got to go up and over.
You know they do that with missiles.

209
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.160
Somebody actually figured that out sometimes.
Some superstar

210
00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.210
<v 1>fucking intelligent scientist guy.
Right.</v>

211
00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.080
As opposed to the really dumb ones that they put in the nuclear programs.
Right.

212
00:12:33.081 --> 00:12:35.420
Bill,
this guy had just sit there

213
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.800
<v 4>and like figure that out,
you know,</v>

214
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:45.390
<v 1>out of our airspace into the troposphere up into the stratosphere over the fuck.</v>

215
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:48.160
It goes right out to outer space.

216
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.200
Reedus the atmosphere without blowing up right on the White House.

217
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.260
Nothing but precedent.
Right.
They just sitting there talking,
shit,

218
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.160
<v 4>what a fucking job.
You know,</v>

219
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.230
<v 1>and there's some other psycho,
you know,</v>

220
00:13:07.231 --> 00:13:10.740
they got cameras in space or some shit or somebody flying around with that

221
00:13:10.741 --> 00:13:15.170
direct TV satellite on the back of his plane just falling around.
Brezhnev,

222
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.180
Gorbachev,
trying to figure out where they're at.

223
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:18.500
<v 4>Okay.</v>

224
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.810
<v 1>So they always have the exact coordinates.
That's what it,</v>

225
00:13:20.811 --> 00:13:24.560
that's the level of stress like Obama has and all these guys.

226
00:13:24.561 --> 00:13:28.880
That's why they age like 90 years.
Cause they know the other team,
right?

227
00:13:28.881 --> 00:13:32.090
They go and Billy Bella check on them.
You know,
they got cameras on your end,

228
00:13:32.091 --> 00:13:36.310
on the top of your fucking head,
wherever you go.
You know,
I'd be all paranoid,

229
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.920
be doing fucking head fakes as I was walking down the hall to the Oval Office.

230
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.010
All right.
I won't even go in the Oval Office saying I'm not going in there.

231
00:13:43.011 --> 00:13:46.340
I would have,
I'd have a double,
I'd always be down in the basement,

232
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.553
<v 4>you know.</v>

233
00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.510
<v 1>Then years later after I died,
you know,</v>

234
00:13:50.511 --> 00:13:53.540
all my staff would start fucking coming out talking shit about me.

235
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.710
He's very fearful,
man,
for all the bravado.
During his speeches,

236
00:13:57.711 --> 00:14:02.500
he spent the entire eight years of his presidency in the,

237
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:05.480
the,
well,
we're not allowed to say how far down it goes,

238
00:14:05.481 --> 00:14:09.600
but let's just say there's one hell of a basement under that house.
Um,

239
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:11.610
<v 4>okay.</v>

240
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.490
<v 1>Even think he fucking lives there.
There's no fucking way he lives there.</v>

241
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.660
He just lives there.
You ever seen the White House?
It's just right there.

242
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:19.783
<v 4>You know</v>

243
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:24.470
<v 1>he doesn't live there.
I bet there's a fucking,
you take an elevator.</v>

244
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.890
That's just like a,

245
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.470
then when Steve jobs used to make those fucking speeches at those nerd fest,

246
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.850
right?
They go down there,

247
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.533
<v 4>you know,</v>

248
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.830
<v 1>he'd come out and he's fucking Jane's and no belt,
and he just,</v>

249
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.260
<v 2>I look at that</v>

250
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.780
and all the nerds are like,
oh my God.

251
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.010
<v 1>I think that's what,
and then he just fucking leave.
Nobody knew where he lived.</v>

252
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:52.220
<v 4>Bye.</v>

253
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:52.391
<v 1>Why?</v>

254
00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:57.391
Why is Bill Gates have a more reclusive fucking house?

255
00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.540
Is The house reclusive bill?
Does it?
Does the House make the choice

256
00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:08.110
to be introverted?
Whatever he has,
he has a fucking house.
No one could get to.

257
00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:13.840
I can't get anywhere fucking near Bill Gates' house.
Right.

258
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:15.230
<v 4>Okay.</v>

259
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.850
<v 1>But the White House,
you can walk right up to the gate.
Oh,
right.</v>

260
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:22.880
You can come right up to it.
It's just going to put me on a list.

261
00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:24.683
<v 4>MMM.</v>

262
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:30.320
<v 1>I bet.
What's his face?
I Bet Bill Gates has got a fucking Goddamn,
you know,</v>

263
00:15:30.321 --> 00:15:33.440
you remember that stead star wars thing that Reagan wanted to put up for
fucking,

264
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:38.210
you know the Robert Parish nuclear warhead rainbow shot from the Kremlin,
right?

265
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:43.000
I bet he's got those full like drones.
I bet he hates drugs.

266
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.930
He's all pissed off.
How dare you assigned my technology.

267
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.500
<v 4>Okay.</v>

268
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.350
<v 1>I think he's an evil mother fucker and that's why it gives away all that money.</v>

269
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.983
<v 4>You know what I mean?</v>

270
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:58.130
<v 1>It's weird.
He's like,
he's like the sociopath with a heart of gold.</v>

271
00:15:58.131 --> 00:15:59.380
He's kind of like Dexter.

272
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.103
<v 4>Right?</v>

273
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.750
<v 1>But if he was like getting the laptops rather than just cutting up people,</v>

274
00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:09.370
but it's only the bad people.
I was never able to get past that.
Look at you.

275
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.200
God Damn.
You look good.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
What do you mean really?

276
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.230
Because they got to hitch my wagon to a dog.

277
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.270
Fucking totally superficial.
All right,

278
00:16:22.271 --> 00:16:25.270
you look hot and you better keep looking hard.
Cause I'll tell you right now,

279
00:16:25.271 --> 00:16:28.400
I'll go right down to the used car lot and I'll start shopping.
Okay,

280
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.450
I'll trade gin.
I'm not going to trade you in and about.
I Dunno.

281
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.650
You're a classic though.
You one of those,

282
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.640
those ones that's going to last for awhile.
You know,

283
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:41.700
I'm a treat you well changing the fluids every 3000 miles out is gross.

284
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.540
Disgusting.
Um,
well thank you for saying that.
I think,

285
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.840
I feel like I went out to a show last night and had some drinks and aids and

286
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:58.700
late night tacos.
Yeah,
she did.
It was so much fun as you talk about the shame.

287
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.090
Yeah.
How about Eggy?

288
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:05.140
The confidence of Vicki pop going out this 68 has more swag than all of you

289
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.610
bitches.
Why are you checking the listeners?
I don't know.

290
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.280
I guess it's funny cause you're hung over and you don't,
yeah.

291
00:17:13.281 --> 00:17:16.400
I don't mean do it tight the listeners,
I'm just saying.
Yeah.

292
00:17:16.401 --> 00:17:21.401
The swag he had out there was the whole band and ag of course is legendary.

293
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.950
That was a great show.
I'm really glad I went.
You know,
I wasn't feeling up to it,

294
00:17:24.951 --> 00:17:28.010
but I'm glad I a great name for an album to,
huh?
Post the post pop did.

295
00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:32.150
I'll post pop depression.
Yeah.
Very good.
It was awesome.

296
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:37.180
And the band was all wearing custom YSL for those of you who are in is designer

297
00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:40.610
clothing YSL is he a Saint Laurent?

298
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.730
He Santa overall ease in Laurel.
Yeah.

299
00:17:43.731 --> 00:17:47.930
So they were all wearing custom YSL.
Even the roadies,

300
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.430
like the crew was wearing like,
like trousers and ties from Ysl,

301
00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.910
which is pretty dope.
Like Josh Look Great.
And that suit Denny,

302
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:57.720
whenever you say trousers,

303
00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:02.070
I think of that Classic Classic Louis C k joke when he used to talk about

304
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:06.320
whenever he does.
Yeah.
When a three would call phone sexy though.

305
00:18:06.321 --> 00:18:10.320
He's get that 70 year old woman.
I'm taking off your trousers.

306
00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:18.870
I think we need to bring cleos water dish in here.
Yeah.

307
00:18:18.871 --> 00:18:19.830
Cause she's laying in the sun.

308
00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:22.590
Why don't you go do that cause or grab another mic if you're going to be on
this.

309
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.360
No,
I'm not.
I just came in say hi,
I'm Jesus.
You have to go to the gym.

310
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.670
That was one of my favorite dumb jokes of all time.
What is it?

311
00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:35.190
Gay Horsey.
Hey,

312
00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:44.080
I'm sorry.
Come on.
You got to admit that's funny on some level.
Um,

313
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.480
all right.
So anyways,
what was I talking about?
Oh,
I was talking about Bill Gates.

314
00:18:49.481 --> 00:18:54.481
Swat a away the fucking droughts and having more security then a old town there.

315
00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:01.660
Motown in the fucking Meson blog.
Yeah,

316
00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:06.450
Polaroid of the sun.
She's done one hike and she's done.

317
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.740
It's already fucking hot out.
He had global warming Nini.

318
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:14.330
You're looking fucking good.
All right.
Beat it.

319
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.153
<v 4>Ah,</v>

320
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.510
<v 1>go to the gym.
Keep it looking good.
That's part of your contract.</v>

321
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.160
Show me shut up.
Um,
all right.

322
00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.730
I fucking hate this whole password thing.
You know,
for the,

323
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.200
I figured out what the fuck was wrong with my eye,
my iTunes,
which is basically,

324
00:19:35.201 --> 00:19:38.800
I can't listen to anything that I've downloaded on my fucking laptop because I

325
00:19:38.801 --> 00:19:42.280
have too many other devices that have already been accepted by Itunes,

326
00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:46.900
so I have to deactivate some other shit.
Um,
I finally figured that out.

327
00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:51.010
I didn't figure it out.
I just went on,
I went on the Internet.

328
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.190
They basically typed in,
uh,
please give me the answer.

329
00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.210
I went there looking,
you'd go right back to the sun.
Cleo.

330
00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:04.240
She fucking loves the Sun.
Um,
all right,

331
00:20:04.241 --> 00:20:05.410
what else did I want to talk about?

332
00:20:05.411 --> 00:20:10.411
All the garage gym is becoming a reality.

333
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.610
Hey,
speak calming

334
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.440
<v 5>reality.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

335
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:22.060
<v 1>Um,
no thanks to fucking rogue fitness.</v>

336
00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.830
Jesus Christ.
What an arrogant God damn company that is.

337
00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.580
I specifically asked that company as a celebrity in my mind to send me a bunch

338
00:20:34.121 --> 00:20:39.121
of free shit for my garage so that I could then hype their company to my 40

339
00:20:41.021 --> 00:20:43.930
listeners.
And can you believe this?
I hope you're sitting down.

340
00:20:43.931 --> 00:20:48.390
Can you believe they never got back to me?
All right.
Well,

341
00:20:48.391 --> 00:20:51.180
because I'm fucking immature.
I got to go vengeance.

342
00:20:51.181 --> 00:20:54.990
Now I have to add my vengeance on that company.
This is what I'm gonna do.

343
00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.950
I am going to buy all of the shit from them.

344
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.600
That's what I'm going to do.
And then you know what?
When they call me and say,

345
00:21:03.601 --> 00:21:06.750
hey,
thanks for using it,
I'm not going to take that phone call.

346
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:12.270
All that getting out of me is the price they want for their fucking goods.

347
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:17.910
Right?
Does that make any sense?
Yeah.
I don't know.

348
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.730
I just throw it out there.
They never get back to me.
I was half serious.

349
00:21:20.731 --> 00:21:21.150
I don't like that.

350
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.970
I don't like people giving me free shit cause then they fucking own you on some

351
00:21:23.971 --> 00:21:27.720
level anyways.
You know.
Hey,
you know,

352
00:21:27.721 --> 00:21:31.410
remember that time I gave you a chin up bar?
I mean what the fuck?
All right,

353
00:21:31.411 --> 00:21:33.810
I'll give you a ride to the airport.
Fuck you know,
you just,
you just,

354
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.960
you can't get out of it.
You can't get out of it.
So anyways,

355
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.160
I am going to fucking do this thing up.
This is,
this is,
this is the game plan.

356
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.100
I'm getting that rogue fitness thing that collapse it.

357
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:48.810
You can fold back into the wall.
I'm getting a workout bench.
You know,

358
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.620
I'm so excited for that because I'm so sick of going to the fucking gym and

359
00:21:52.621 --> 00:21:54.480
there's always some,
there's always somebody on it.

360
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.770
If somebody is always benching right.
And uh,

361
00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:03.480
I can also do squats and I'll be able to do pull ups and then I got my atomic

362
00:22:03.481 --> 00:22:05.700
holds and I'm going to put those above where my truck is.

363
00:22:05.701 --> 00:22:08.010
I'll just have to pull my truck out,
which I know kind of sucks,

364
00:22:08.011 --> 00:22:12.480
but who gives a fuck?
I'm going to have an epoxy floor put in,
right?

365
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.650
And then Nia wants an adjustable speed bag over in the corner,

366
00:22:16.651 --> 00:22:19.830
which is great because all I'll have to do is adjust it like twice.

367
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.250
And just like the bicycle I bought her,
she's never going to use it again.

368
00:22:23.251 --> 00:22:25.950
Then I can just lock that fucker into position.
Right.

369
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:28.740
We'll get it did they did a boarded up.
He did a pub,
right?

370
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.190
You've got to put it in the corner.
I'm worried about the noise,
you know,

371
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.460
banging on,
you know,
blowing out my ear drums.
Forget about that.

372
00:22:35.461 --> 00:22:39.120
Annoying the shit out of my neighbors because everybody out here lives on top of

373
00:22:39.121 --> 00:22:40.770
one another.
So um,

374
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.780
I figure if I do that and then I'm have those interlocking rubber things

375
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:50.730
underneath all the gym area,
I'll have a place where I could skip rope.
Right.

376
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:51.840
I can do my pull ups.

377
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.560
My only thing is I'm getting rid of my pull up and dip station thing that I have

378
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.890
and I'll be able to do the pull up still,
but I won't be able to do dips.

379
00:22:58.891 --> 00:23:03.120
So if anybody knows of an attachment that works.

380
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.150
I was thinking of just having the handle's coming out of the wall.

381
00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:09.750
If they make something like that,
which would look really weird for some reason.

382
00:23:09.751 --> 00:23:13.410
What are,
what is those that fucking Porto glory holes.

383
00:23:13.411 --> 00:23:15.130
It's like the glory hole of fucking,

384
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.080
it's like the glory hole of workout equipment to just have like the dip fucking

385
00:23:25.211 --> 00:23:28.720
things just coming out of the wall,
right?
No.

386
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.490
What am I going to perverted mine?
What the fuck do you want from me?
Uh,

387
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:37.000
how long into this fucking thing are we?
23 minutes.
Michael Jordan.

388
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.900
All right,
here we go.
Here we go.
Let's,
uh,
let's read a little bit of advertising.

389
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.770
All right.
Oh fuck.
I didn't talk about self driving cars.

390
00:23:45.771 --> 00:23:49.030
I got the biggest argument with fucking forest shot today.
Oh,
we,

391
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.560
we will go and we never get an argument.
We would just fucking eat it.

392
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.280
He's like a scientist and I'm a dope,
so that's just fucking right there.

393
00:23:55.281 --> 00:23:58.430
That's just a recipe for it to go off the rails.

394
00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.790
I brought up for us shit before and if you're um,

395
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:03.603
<v 0>okay.</v>

396
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.180
<v 1>Um,
I think he said he's going to be in Nashville soon.
I'm sure he has a website.</v>

397
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.600
He uh,
he actually,
he opens for Jim Jefferies all the time.
Um,

398
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.280
he's fucking hilarious.
Like I would go hiking with somebody who wasn't funny.

399
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.143
You know what I mean?

400
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.760
It's bad enough when you got to work with the comic that isn't that funny.

401
00:24:19.761 --> 00:24:22.420
But if you're going to walk next to him for like an hour and a half who,

402
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.680
I'll tell you that's a rough one.
You know.
All right.

403
00:24:24.681 --> 00:24:28.800
Tracker or track are smart cars,

404
00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:30.630
smart phones,
smart,

405
00:24:30.631 --> 00:24:34.650
Hobbs Technology has made everything smart.

406
00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:35.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

407
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.770
<v 1>I'm smack Joe,
you know.</v>

408
00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:39.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

409
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:42.990
<v 1>No,
I like everybody says Fredo all right,</v>

410
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:47.250
but losing your stuff still makes Matt fee.
People feel fucking stupid.

411
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:49.160
<v 4>Tracker</v>

412
00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.680
<v 1>makes losing things a thing of the past tracker is a coin size device that</v>

413
00:24:54.691 --> 00:24:59.160
locates Ms. Plays,
keys,
wallets,
bags,
computers,

414
00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:03.840
anything in seconds.
Just paired tracker to your smartphone.

415
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.580
Attach it to anything.
Put it on your deck.
Where are my balls?
Right next to mine.

416
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.880
<v 4>Yay.
Thank you.
Tracker.</v>

417
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.820
<v 1>Um,
you can fight.
You get it.
You get what the fuck it is?
Lose your phone.</v>

418
00:25:14.821 --> 00:25:18.660
Press a button.
Can't find your nuts.
There they are,
uh,

when you got technology,
self-driving fucking cars.

443
00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.360
Self driving cars are so fucking stupid.

444
00:26:50.361 --> 00:26:53.150
One of the great things about cars is he might have people that they kill every

445
00:26:53.151 --> 00:26:53.390
year,

446
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:56.450
which is great for the environment and then you can have these fucking robots

447
00:26:56.451 --> 00:26:57.620
and it was real.
It's going to be great.

448
00:26:57.621 --> 00:26:59.930
I could stare at my smart phone as I drive to work.

449
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.800
Give you think all these fucking now what are these robots do?
You know?

450
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.090
Just decide one day that they're sick of being the Goddamn Limo driver and

451
00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:12.270
driving us around and they kind of share a look,
you know,

452
00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.920
had a red light and that starts a revolution just like in the Ukraine where it

453
00:27:16.921 --> 00:27:20.820
just took a couple of jerk offs on Facebook and next thing you know Putin is

454
00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:23.820
gone.
You know what?
Maybe we need to Robert Parish a little closer.

455
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.060
Do a little fucking layup.
Alright,

456
00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:32.500
trunk club everybody.

458
00:27:38.321 --> 00:27:41.860
bitches,
except when you're in the wine aisle.

459
00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:46.120
I thought that just said tranny surprise because I was doing that fucking hacky

460
00:27:46.121 --> 00:27:50.560
gay accent Tannins and terrors me nothing to you.

461
00:27:50.561 --> 00:27:53.470
It means nothing to me.
I don't even know what they are.
The types of wine,

462
00:27:53.471 --> 00:27:56.890
I'm guessing unless she happened to be a fancy pants,

463
00:27:56.891 --> 00:27:59.860
professional sommeliers.

464
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.480
I hate when people just make somebody like your fancy pants because you

465
00:28:04.481 --> 00:28:07.300
understand something that takes a little bit of brains.

466
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.990
I respect anybody then understands wine.
I like those people.
They look at it,

467
00:28:10.991 --> 00:28:13.660
they swirl it around.
They shoved their fucking honker in there,

468
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.633
<v 7>you know,</v>

469
00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.970
<v 1>put it their mouth.
They let it swirl around at the different flavors.
Hit him,</v>

470
00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.820
you know,
tasting the barrel,

471
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:27.840
tasting history and let it go down there.
SOFIC is it hit stick?

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.680

So I think it should be a classy goddamn thing and I think he should take the

539
00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.190
Hey,
did anybody see that fucking hilarious.

540
00:32:41.191 --> 00:32:45.930
Twitter back and forth between Kanye West in a dead mile,

541
00:32:45.931 --> 00:32:49.710
a dead mouse.
However the fuck you say his name,
I guess card.

542
00:32:49.711 --> 00:32:52.260
You took a screenshot and then the fucking screenshot,

543
00:32:52.261 --> 00:32:57.261
allegedly there was something up there that showed some website where he was

544
00:32:58.651 --> 00:33:02.090
pirating the software.
That fucking Dj guy.
So,

545
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.433
<v 3>Huh?</v>

546
00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:08.870
What's that?

547
00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.570
<v 1>Oh fuck.
I gotta pause.
This niece says we might have a leak somewhere.</v>

548
00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:15.830
<v 3>Okay.</v>

549
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.010
<v 1>Ah,
Geez.
Dan.
Not,
not too bad.
Just a little fucking leak.</v>

550
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:20.990
The J trap downstairs.

551
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.460
<v 8>Yeah,
never fucking ends.
Um,
anyways,</v>

552
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:30.440
so Kanye took a screenshot and I guess his dead,

553
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:34.760
a dead mouse demo five,
however the fuck you say his name.
I'm old.

554
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.770
I should know how to say it.
Um,

555
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:40.790
I guess he made this software that helps you make an album.

556
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
And evidently Kanye allegedly had a website open where you could illegally

557
00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:47.840
download it.
So he called him out.
He goes,

558
00:33:47.841 --> 00:33:51.350
you're not making enough money to pay for this software.

559
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:55.460
You gotta fucking pirate my shit.
And he would just wrote Dick on it.

560
00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:00.520
So Kanye comes back with a barrage of shit just trashing this DJ talking about

561
00:34:02.241 --> 00:34:06.290
his mouse head.
He got a fan in there.
Mike,
I'm bring my daughter.

562
00:34:06.291 --> 00:34:11.090
She's a big fan of Minnie mouse,
blah,
ba blah,
ba Blah ba blah.

563
00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:14.840
Just like,
just like a corporation,
you know,
just,

564
00:34:14.841 --> 00:34:17.690
just sending reams of paper over,
like on better call.

565
00:34:17.691 --> 00:34:21.860
Saul tried to fucking delay it,
but nowhere in it did.

566
00:34:21.861 --> 00:34:23.090
The man denied that.

567
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:26.570
He didn't feel that they fucking didn't steal it as far as I could tell,
he just,

568
00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:31.220
he just immediate immediately capitulation just immediately switched it from,

569
00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:34.730
you stole my shit to do with your fucking mouse head,
right?

570
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.640
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

571
00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.640
<v 1>I actually wanted to fucking jump into the middle of it to give the DJ help</v>

572
00:34:41.771 --> 00:34:44.470
because he kind of was fucking taken the bait.
It was just,

573
00:34:44.471 --> 00:34:46.210
it's like what a chick does.
You know what I mean?

574
00:34:46.211 --> 00:34:48.430
That there is so fucking good at arguing that they fucking,

575
00:34:48.431 --> 00:34:52.780
they spin you off like you got a dead to rights and by the time you come through

576
00:34:52.781 --> 00:34:56.010
the whole thing you're like,
how the fuck did I lose that?
Cause they got,

577
00:34:56.011 --> 00:34:59.890
you never react to that shit.
He should have just laid back,
you know,

578
00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:04.570
on the ropes led Kanye,
punch himself out and then just say yes.
So like I said,

579
00:35:04.571 --> 00:35:06.880
you stole my shit,
you know,

580
00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:10.510
and how's it guy with a mouse had going to take shifts from so many who wore a

581
00:35:10.511 --> 00:35:12.460
leather mini skirt throughout a whole fucking tour.

582
00:35:12.461 --> 00:35:14.520
I mean there was so much shit he could've said back,
but he should,

583
00:35:14.521 --> 00:35:17.350
he should have stayed in the pocket.
I was just like,

584
00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.550
I was watching that the way I was watching like a comedian and a Heckler,

585
00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.880
you know?
Then it was written.
I was rooting for,
I was rooting for the DJ.

586
00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.090
There's room for the DJ in that one provided if the,
if the guy stole,

587
00:35:28.091 --> 00:35:31.030
if we didn't,
either way it was fucking entertaining,
you know.

588
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.220
Nice Twitter battle.
That nice.

589
00:35:33.221 --> 00:35:36.120
Isn't it funny how I'm not in a robots driving cars,
but I like a,
I liked,

590
00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:39.780
I like it.
I like a good Twitter,
Twitter back and forth.
You know,

591
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:46.020
that's the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday.
Monday morning park has

592
00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:51.990
come some music.
Once again.
We always post at the [inaudible] podcast.

593
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:56.610
A Twitter feed will always tell you what the music is.
Andrew always posted.

594
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.700
I don't know what it is.
I am an old man.
I am just,

595
00:35:59.701 --> 00:36:03.260
I am just now trying to update um,

596
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.590
my music.
Oh my God.
I got to tell you what I was doing the other day.
Holy Shit.

597
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:12.300
I was listening to,
uh,
I downloaded all this shit,
right?

598
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.360
Alabama shakes.
Fucking love the new one.

599
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.540
That album that they have was to shit the weekend.
I listened to that.

600
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.190
I actually liked that shit.

601
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.870
I got to tell you what was funny though was a ah,
fuck,

602
00:36:24.871 --> 00:36:27.870
I already forgot his name.
Kendrick Lamar.
I'm so fucking old.

603
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.730
Helped me out here guys.
I,
I,

604
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.640
I don't know anything that's going on with any of these people.
Kendrick Lamar,

605
00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.460
I'm sitting there,
I have to admit,

606
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:38.430
I did have this old guy thought and I was embarrassed that I had it.

607
00:36:38.431 --> 00:36:42.900
I was listening to his album and I get to this song and he just keeps going.

608
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:46.950
This dick ain't fi right.
And I'm just,

609
00:36:46.951 --> 00:36:49.440
and all I could just kept thinking was this won a grammy.

610
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.900
And I'm not saying it didn't deserve it,

611
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.960
but I don't know what the people look like,

612
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.480
who fucking vote for the Grammy's.

613
00:37:00.481 --> 00:37:04.050
But the way people complain about it and now they're always given it to white

614
00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:08.280
people,
right?
Like the Oscars,
I'm imagining it's a bunch of white people,

615
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.360
50s and 60s right.
It takes a while,

616
00:37:12.361 --> 00:37:16.560
I would think to establish yourself enough to even be considered,
you know,

617
00:37:16.561 --> 00:37:17.520
to be on that shit.

618
00:37:17.521 --> 00:37:21.120
And I'm just picturing all these fucking 50 and 60 year old white people just

619
00:37:21.121 --> 00:37:24.750
sitting there listening to these dick ain't free eat right.

620
00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:31.230
And they go like,
you know,
like they can relate to that on some level on I,
yeah.

621
00:37:31.231 --> 00:37:35.070
This is like connects with me.
I'm going to vote with this.
You know,

622
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.420
they probably just drive down the hood and stand there for 20 minutes and count

623
00:37:39.421 --> 00:37:44.421
how many times somebody drives by eight free driving by and they all right.

624
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.900
There's enough people listening to it.
We've got to give it to them.
Um,

625
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:53.610
so anyways,
but it is the embarrassing thing I was in,

626
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:59.000
I was I listening to,
I got to make sure I say his name right.
It's Ed.

627
00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:02.520
Is it Sheehan?
Ah,
for fuck sakes.
Belts.

628
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:06.240
You don't know any I did Conan with this guy.
He was fucking great.

629
00:38:06.241 --> 00:38:07.890
I think he's great.
I just don't fuck it.

630
00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:12.330
She Rand Sharon,
we'll go.

631
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.210
Sharon and I was listening to his album

632
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:20.670
and I was this,
I was listening to that song.
One,

633
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.840
I was listening to Ed Sheeran,
one in a,

634
00:38:24.841 --> 00:38:29.430
in a Toyota Prius and I was sitting there going,
I am enjoying this.

635
00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:34.890
Like what happened to me?
I used to be I and I used to fucking listen.

636
00:38:34.891 --> 00:38:35.724
I what happened.

637
00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:37.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

638
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:40.960
<v 1>But when I really look back at the shit that I used to think was bad as some of</v>

639
00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:43.810
it was bad ass stuff,
a lot of it,
you know,

640
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:48.010
say which people will say about a sensitive fellow like this Ed Eddie here,

641
00:38:48.011 --> 00:38:51.010
right.
You know,
he does dress like a man,

642
00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:55.330
unlike the bands that I listen to in the 80s where they came up just full on.

643
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.090
Not only did they dress like chicks,

644
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.580
they dress like hot chicks trying to hang on.
They,
they,

645
00:39:01.581 --> 00:39:03.700
they were really like the first house,

646
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:08.530
a real housewives when you look back at a lot of it,
you know what I mean?

647
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:14.110
Um,
I guess still they were still in their prime in their twenties.
Um,

648
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:18.190
I dunno.
So whatever those are the albums that I was listening to this week.

649
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:23.520
I literally went from 1970 82,

650
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.950
you know,
I went from like 19,
I don't know,

651
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:31.990
late sixties to late eighties was what the Fuck I've been listening to for the

652
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:32.351
last,

653
00:39:32.351 --> 00:39:35.230
I don't know how many friends they worked in a fucking warehouse in the 80s.

654
00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:40.430
And then I immediately went to like 2014,
2015,
2016.

655
00:39:40.431 --> 00:39:42.670
And uh,
I,
I survived.

656
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.630
I somehow survived and I actually enjoy the shit so it,
um,
I dunno,

657
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:51.700
I dunno if it's going to help me.
I don't know what the point of it is,

658
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:53.430
but all I know is it's,
it's,

659
00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:55.363
<v 0>yeah,</v>

660
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.710
<v 1>that's funny to me.
This deck eight free Lao of,
of the year.</v>

661
00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:03.000
Um,
I'll listen to it more.
I'll try to,
I mean,

662
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:08.020
it's going into some really white ears here though.
It's probably actually a,
uh,

663
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:09.520
<v 0>yeah,</v>

664
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.780
<v 1>it probably says more about him as an artist if I don't get it,</v>

665
00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.080
you know what I mean?
Then if I get it,
he probably doesn't want me to get it.

666
00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:21.130
Like,
I don't want some 48 year old white guy like at my shit.

667
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.540
Um,
oh,
maybe I'm wrong,
but the fuck do I know.
Anyways,

668
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.050
fuck off.
I'll talk to you on Monday.

669
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.053
<v 0>I shut this off.</v>

670
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:30.800
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on is spelt birds the Monday morning podcast on Monday,</v>

671
00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.160
June 14th,
2010.
How the hell

672
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.330
<v 8>are you?
Are you good?
Did you have a good weekend?</v>

673
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.920
Did you,
did you go down to that place with the thing I heard it was nice.

674
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:46.400
What's it nice?
It is nice.
All that's nice.

675
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.010
My son,

676
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.910
he had a recital this weekend and we were so nervous.

677
00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.570
He was all a flustered and more suburban.

678
00:41:56.571 --> 00:41:59.360
Talk about shit that nobody cares about.

679
00:41:59.361 --> 00:42:04.100
Chorus Frank was in the back with the garden hose.
It froze up over the winter,

680
00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:09.340
so we have to buy a new one of those.
So you know,
frank course,

681
00:42:09.341 --> 00:42:13.410
he goes on the Internet and he just starts researching all about those hellos.

682
00:42:13.411 --> 00:42:17.710
Houses.
I can't,
I don't know.

683
00:42:17.711 --> 00:42:19.840
Can you imagine just the is sitting there,

684
00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.690
the end of a culdesac like that is your fucking reality.

685
00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:26.030
Rather than having a wine cellar,

686
00:42:26.031 --> 00:42:30.120
I would have just have a secret room of fucking porn with Kleenex for me.

687
00:42:30.121 --> 00:42:33.320
The rub one out or just sit there crying at what?

688
00:42:33.321 --> 00:42:37.700
What became of my life I need,
can you go out and fix his bicycle?

689
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

690
00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:41.250
<v 8>No.
Why doesn't he go climb a fucking tree?</v>

691
00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.190
Jesus Christ.
What did,

692
00:42:44.191 --> 00:42:47.450
what did they do in the 18 hundreds you wonder why the environment is so fucked

693
00:42:47.451 --> 00:42:48.740
up.
That's it right there buddy.

694
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:54.110
You just don't want to go out and be a part of your kids' lives.
I don't.

695
00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.460
That's why I told you I enjoyed condoms.
I did enjoy condoms.

696
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:03.230
I just didn't want to bust one in you without one on and now I did and now look

697
00:43:03.231 --> 00:43:06.560
at it.
Look at my face sweetheart.
Can't you see the misery?

698
00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.053
<v 0>Fuck them.</v>

699
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:15.070
<v 8>Well,
he half looks like,
Yo,
you go fix this fucking bike.
I'm not yelling.
I'm no,</v>

700
00:43:15.071 --> 00:43:15.904
I'm not

701
00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.433
<v 3>somewhat</v>

702
00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:38.600
tunic and dangle mass.
The forest with the Quran

703
00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:42.770
does capture.
The trick

704
00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:46.520
is to his cohorts to sleep in the tree.

705
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:03.720
Advice.

706
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.850
<v 8>Take Shit from anybody.
Question Mark.</v>

707
00:44:05.851 --> 00:44:09.210
Bill sometimes you and your podcast with go fuck yourselves and don't take shit

708
00:44:09.211 --> 00:44:13.560
from anyone.
Well,
let me tell you my story.
Back in November,

709
00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:16.590
a cop pulled me over,
roughed me up,

710
00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:21.870
was a huge asshole and wrote up every rinky dinky ticket he could.

711
00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:25.890
Okay,
now wait a minute.
What happened?

712
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:29.400
You were just driving down the street and this guy just pulled you over.

713
00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:33.100
I need a little bit of the backstory here.
What's this guy?
Did you know,

714
00:44:33.101 --> 00:44:37.300
did he get into a big fight with his wife and then took it out on you or we did

715
00:44:37.301 --> 00:44:41.020
you say something wise to the guy and he said,
all right,

716
00:44:41.021 --> 00:44:43.270
I'm not in the fucking mood anyways,

717
00:44:43.271 --> 00:44:45.880
let's see if we can figure it out here at the end of the altercation,

718
00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:50.470
I shook his hand,
look him straight in the eyes and gave him that look that says,

719
00:44:50.471 --> 00:44:52.240
I will see you in court asshole.

720
00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.120
I showed up in court this Monday to defend myself.

721
00:44:55.121 --> 00:44:59.980
My plan was to stand before that asshole and having him explain his actions to

722
00:44:59.981 --> 00:45:02.170
me in a court of law.
And Dude,

723
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:06.490
this ain't gonna work out unless she had a witness.
I wanted to ask him.

724
00:45:06.491 --> 00:45:07.750
Even then,
that doesn't work out.

725
00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:12.400
I wanted to ask them if twisting my arm so much that I couldn't use it for a few

726
00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.420
days was justified.

727
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:18.430
I wanted to ask him why he decided that me five six 175 pounds as a threat to

728
00:45:18.431 --> 00:45:19.030
him,

729
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:24.030
six foot to six foot three 250 that he need to hit me from behind.

730
00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:29.390
Um,
don't call me an Asshole,

731
00:45:29.391 --> 00:45:32.840
but I'm not 100% buy in this story because you didn't say what happened

732
00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:37.770
before this.
This guy just did this.

733
00:45:37.771 --> 00:45:42.600
Is this guy like the fucking worst cop ever?
I don't know.
Here we go.
I wanted to,

734
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:46.740
I wanted to know why he needed to demean me while I was handcuffed in the back

735
00:45:46.741 --> 00:45:47.730
of the paddy wagon.

736
00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:52.620
I then wanted to ask him how many excessive force complaints he had against him.

737
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:55.560
The answer is four.
Oh Shit.
So I'm wrong here.

738
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.200
I want him to ask him how his marriage ended.

739
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:02.460
His ex wife has a restraining order against him for domestic violence.
All right.

740
00:46:02.461 --> 00:46:05.190
I tap out.
You're right.
You're right.
Sorry.
Uh,

741
00:46:05.191 --> 00:46:08.910
I wanted to ask him what part of protect and serve did he not understand?

742
00:46:08.911 --> 00:46:12.480
I want it to end the questioning with him explaining how he got caught on a cell

743
00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:14.880
phone camera.
Assaulting a motorist.

744
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:20.060
You can look up the video on youtube under Milwaukee Police Lambo,

745
00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:24.450
driver l a m B o driver.
Here's what sucks in Milwaukee.

746
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:29.100
If the cop that wrote you the ticket doesn't show up in court,

747
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.060
your case is dismissed and you don't have to pay anything.
We'll guess.

748
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.140
Guess why I told you that the piece of shit didn't show up in court.
Oh,

749
00:46:37.141 --> 00:46:40.350
that's awful.
I need advice too.
I let this

750
00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:44.330
all be water under the bridge or do I take this fucker down?

751
00:46:44.331 --> 00:46:47.300
I really want justice,
but I don't want to be beaten by other cops.

752
00:46:47.301 --> 00:46:50.630
What should I do?
Um,

753
00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:56.930
well I think you just shed some light.
Milwaukee police,
lambo driver.

754
00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:00.930
All my listeners will probably look up and watch that.
Um,

755
00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.300
now this guy sounds like a dangerous guy.

756
00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:10.690
Look,
you know,
this is,
listen,

757
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:13.930
what I would do if I was going to try to take this dude down,
what I would do is,

758
00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:16.150
you know what the local news loves doing now.

759
00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:21.330
They love showing like youtube videos and they love talking about Twitter and

760
00:47:21.551 --> 00:47:24.790
all that type of stuff because they're desperately trying to get the kids and

761
00:47:24.791 --> 00:47:29.650
people because they're losing all this viewership to,
uh,
to the Internet.

762
00:47:29.651 --> 00:47:30.280
So the fact

763
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.010
<v 1>that you,
you have this controversial thing,</v>

764
00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:38.490
you have this fucked up law and you have a youtube video of this guy,

765
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:43.140
um,
that makes,
that's like one of those perfect little pieces,

766
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:48.510
you know,
coming up next Milwaukee police officer or a little out of line,

767
00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:52.990
check out the youtube video that everybody's been talking about all the Lord at.

768
00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:57.690
Yeah.
I mean,
you could go that way.
Uh,
but yeah,
I mean you're,
you're taking a,

769
00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.090
you're definitely going to take a fucking risk.

770
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.823
<v 4>MMM.</v>

771
00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:03.960
<v 1>You know,</v>

772
00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.690
so you can know Rodney King died this week and that brought up that whole video

773
00:48:07.691 --> 00:48:11.380
and all that type of shit.
And I know,
you know,
the guy just pulled over.

774
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:13.890
That's what you supposed to do.
I know.
I mean,

775
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:18.070
they look who's kitten know Rodney King was going to get beat down no matter

776
00:48:18.071 --> 00:48:21.370
what.
I mean,
if you've run from the fucking cops,
I don't give a fuck who you are.

777
00:48:21.371 --> 00:48:23.290
You've got to get beat down.
But if you get back up,

778
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:26.710
you charge him a couple of times.
Abso-Fucking-Lutely but you know,

779
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:30.580
there's gotta be a way to take a guy down without giving them 12 fucking skull

780
00:48:30.581 --> 00:48:35.490
fractures.
You know what I'm saying?
It's,
I dunno,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's

781
00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:37.580
<v 0>okay.</v>

782
00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:42.380
<v 1>It's a fucking thankless job and then it's a really dangerous job.
If,</v>

783
00:48:42.381 --> 00:48:46.820
if the wrong kind of person gets a,
gets the job,

784
00:48:46.821 --> 00:48:51.610
why did my phone just go off?
Oh,
that's right.
I gotta do that ship.
So,
um,

785
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:53.910
I don't know.
Personally,
I can't,

786
00:48:53.911 --> 00:48:56.030
I can't eat ever watch that Rodney king thing again.

787
00:48:56.031 --> 00:49:00.470
That's like fucking its most brutal thing ever.
And actually when you watch that,

788
00:49:00.471 --> 00:49:02.720
now you go,
thank God they got fucking a,

789
00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.410
what do you call those things?
Taser.
What did,
what did we clear?

790
00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:11.130
What do you call those things?
What do they call those things?
They just,
uh,

791
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.290
these Zappia.
Did you guys ever see that one?
Um,

792
00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.140
that one where they,
the cop.

793
00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:25.140
What the fuck do you call those things?
He got tased.
He got fucking,

794
00:49:25.141 --> 00:49:28.380
is it a taser?
Cleo?
Why am I so dumb?

795
00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:33.350
<v 4>Ah,
fucking love this dog.</v>

796
00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:37.370
You know that Cleo,
um,

797
00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:42.440
<v 1>underrated having a dog.
It's the best fucking thing ever.
Anyways,
I got,</v>

798
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.500
I got to get you this youtube video now that it brought it up.
It's a,

799
00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:47.110
<v 0>okay.</v>

800
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:51.460
<v 1>It's basically they're doing a demonstration of one of those fucking things.</v>

801
00:49:51.461 --> 00:49:53.510
Whatever the fuck you call him that I just can't think,

802
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:57.190
why do I keep saying it's a taser?
I know.
It's not a he is it a taser?

803
00:49:57.191 --> 00:50:01.300
He got tazed I can't fuck it.
My brain is mush.

804
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:05.370
So anyways,
there's one cop gonna Zap another cop to,
uh,

805
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.850
the demonstrate it to the class and look,
man,

806
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:13.750
I don't give a fuck how much of a man you are.
You get fucking Zappo electricity.

807
00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:18.440
You're gonna make a noise.
Most guys go like are on,
they fucking go down to,
uh,

808
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.730
this guy fucking shoots it at the guy.

809
00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:26.080
And this dude sounds like he's like ending an opera.

810
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:27.650
He gets tased.
He's like

811
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:33.160
<v 8>just fucking drunk.
He does literally</v>

812
00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:37.990
<v 1>something like that and drops.
And I just love how the cop was,</v>

813
00:50:37.991 --> 00:50:38.824
shoots them,

814
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:42.680
tries to act like he just didn't scream out like a little fucking girl,
man.

815
00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:46.080
It's hilarious.
But,
um,
but getting back to that,
yeah,
dude,
that's,

816
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:47.260
that's a serious,

817
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.780
<v 3>yeah,</v>

818
00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.880
<v 1>that's a serious thing.
And you and you,
you know,</v>

819
00:50:51.881 --> 00:50:54.040
if this guy really is as bad as you're saying,

820
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.870
<v 4>you know,</v>

821
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:58.760
<v 1>the right thing is not to let it go.</v>

822
00:50:58.761 --> 00:51:01.580
The right thing is to try and shed some light on it and hopefully that they can

823
00:51:01.581 --> 00:51:05.300
get this guy off the force because he's given decent cops a bad name.

824
00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:10.820
There you go.
So,
but your,
your worries are definitely a,

825
00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:14.230
you know,
valid.

826
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:15.980
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

827
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:19.670
<v 8>I mean,
considering none of those cops during the Rodney King,</v>

828
00:51:19.671 --> 00:51:23.330
none of them got fucking,
they got,
they got off.
If you can get off doing that.

829
00:51:23.331 --> 00:51:26.810
I mean,
Jesus Christ,
you know,

830
00:51:26.811 --> 00:51:29.720
that dude who shot that kid on that platform and in Oakland,

831
00:51:29.721 --> 00:51:32.750
that was fucking brutal.
He's like,
oh,
I thought it was my,
uh,

832
00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:33.890
daughter was my house keys.

833
00:51:33.891 --> 00:51:37.010
I didn't realize it was my gun and he fucking got away with that.

834
00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:41.900
I'm not trashing cops,
I'm just saying,
not saying they're all fucking bad,

835
00:51:41.901 --> 00:51:45.610
but I'm just saying it's,
it's,
it's practically fucking impossible.

836
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.863
<v 4>MMM.</v>

837
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:50.530
<v 8>It literally,
even if you have video,</v>

838
00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:55.650
I think you have to have the combination of having video and then you have to be

839
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:57.230
<v 3>okay.</v>

840
00:51:57.230 --> 00:52:01.490
<v 8>You have to be a certain level of a wealth and influence.</v>

841
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:02.870
<v 3>Okay.</v>

842
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:07.350
<v 8>Because if you're broke,
you know,
I don't think that they're,
that you know,
you,</v>

843
00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.310
there's no way they're just going to be like,
yeah,
go fuck yourself.
You'd done,

844
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:13.370
you know,
and then when you add racism into it,
I mean,
you're pretty much,

845
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:17.930
it's pretty much game set match,
which is fucking unfortunate.
So,
um,
I don't know.

846
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.140
I'm talking about society way beyond my fucking right.

847
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:25.910
<v 1>The lexo.
I'm going to tap out here already trashed fucking hair metal.</v>

848
00:52:25.911 --> 00:52:28.950
Now I would have fucking angry a psycho cops.

849
00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:37.170
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

850
00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:01.100
<v 8>um,
all right.
Lights,
camera dumped bill.</v>

851
00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.850
I'm a 29 year old guy and recently broke up with a funny,

852
00:53:04.851 --> 00:53:07.950
attractive and all around.
Great girl.
Oh Gee.

853
00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.210
Why Sir would you do that?
You ask.
All right.

854
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:12.410
<v 4>MMM.</v>

855
00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:16.740
<v 8>Two things.
Her Dad was born without teeth and your words,</v>

856
00:53:16.741 --> 00:53:20.580
your baby will if you breed with her or

857
00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.450
she has got something going on in the vaginal area,

858
00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:31.190
some sort of odor,
stinky pussy.
I don't know.
Well,
here we go.
Well,

859
00:53:31.191 --> 00:53:32.024
let me tell you,

860
00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.210
this girl and I had been dating for about three months and we had a great thing

861
00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:39.350
going.
She's half Afro Cuban,
half Puerto Rican and really sexy.

862
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:43.670
She had a rough upbringing,
but I didn't care because she's honest,

863
00:53:43.671 --> 00:53:47.660
easygoing and not bitchy.
Like so many girls I dated,
she was a bit needy,

864
00:53:47.661 --> 00:53:48.560
but I didn't mind.

865
00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:50.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

866
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.660
<v 8>Um,
we were out at a bar one night having a few drinks and I was feeling pretty</v>

867
00:53:53.661 --> 00:53:54.320
good.

868
00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.440
I was looking at a couple of floozies at the end of the bar and asked her if

869
00:53:57.441 --> 00:54:01.640
she's ever been with another woman.
She coyly looked at me and said,
yes.

870
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.720
<v 0>Okay,</v>

871
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.960
<v 8>good stuff.
I thought,
yeah,
dude,
this is a fucking fantasy right here.</v>

872
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:11.820
Fucking red shoe diaries.
Um,
then I proceeded with,

873
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:15.450
have you ever been in a threesome with two girls and a guy again?

874
00:54:15.451 --> 00:54:16.530
She answered yes.

875
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:18.050
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

876
00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:22.190
<v 8>Okay.
Kind of slutty,
but I'm no saint.
While I couldn't stop.</v>

877
00:54:22.191 --> 00:54:25.010
They are God.
You're going to go for the rotisserie question.

878
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.200
What's in the box?
Ah,
here we go.

879
00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:33.920
Here we go.
Strap yourselves in for this one.
Well,
I couldn't stop there.

880
00:54:33.921 --> 00:54:37.220
So I asked,
have you ever had a threesome with two guys?

881
00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:44.110
She looked down at the ground and she looked up a bit ashamed,

882
00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:48.370
Lee and said yes.
Wow.
SCAG alert.

883
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:52.760
I thought I then asked her one more question.
I knew this one could back.

884
00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.220
Where the fuck do you go from here?

885
00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:55.460
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

886
00:54:55.460 --> 00:55:00.380
<v 8>like throwing the high heat to Albert Albert Pool House.
I finally asked,</v>

887
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:03.980
wait,
have you ever been in a porn?

888
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:05.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

889
00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:08.550
<v 8>She then blushed and look me in the eye and said,
yeah,</v>

890
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.780
<v 0>okay.</v>

891
00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:14.770
<v 8>I looked at her calmly and was like,
oh,
but inside I was like,</v>

892
00:55:14.771 --> 00:55:17.830
Jesus fucking Christ.
Yes.
Well you should.

893
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:19.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

894
00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:22.870
<v 8>You know those first couple,
I mean,</v>

895
00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:28.070
you can look at,
let's,
let's break this down here.
All right.
She's been with,
uh,

896
00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:32.890
she's had a threesome with another girl and a guy who gets that.

897
00:55:32.891 --> 00:55:35.350
That's who gives a fuck right there.
All right.

898
00:55:35.351 --> 00:55:39.250
You're already knew she banged another guy.
All right.
But,
uh,

899
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:43.140
the fact that she also did it with another girl,
that takes a little fucking,
uh,

900
00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:46.750
that tones down his dick in her pussy.
Right.
This is how guys think.
Women,

901
00:55:46.751 --> 00:55:47.584
I'm sorry.

902
00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:48.633
<v 0>All right.</v>

903
00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.120
<v 8>That's something that,
that's something in the,</v>

904
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.033
<v 0>yeah,</v>

905
00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.380
<v 8>the credit.
Is it the credit a bit.
Why?
Why,</v>

906
00:55:56.381 --> 00:55:58.900
why do you try to talk up counting shit you to dump.
All right.

907
00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.290
That was all right.
The two guys thing.

908
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:09.040
Now you can look the other way on that.
Maybe if it,
if it was in another state,

909
00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:13.930
but it can't be in the same state because if you run into one of the two guys

910
00:56:13.931 --> 00:56:17.990
that fucking,
you know,
we're high fiving is they fucking bagged her that.

911
00:56:17.991 --> 00:56:22.840
I mean I I know about that one.
But then the third one she did a porno.
I mean,

912
00:56:22.841 --> 00:56:26.880
yeah,
no that's a,
you've got to walk away from that

913
00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:29.600
or,

914
00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:34.550
or you have to go to NASA to get tested for the latest fucking STDs I would

915
00:56:34.551 --> 00:56:37.770
think.
And then also God knows what's going on,
uh,

916
00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:42.310
mentally that you would do that.
What?

917
00:56:42.311 --> 00:56:46.210
I just like sex now.
Non Health is something going on.
Who doesn't like sex?

918
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.230
I Dunno.
Anyways,
plowing ahead.
See she's so,
she egos.

919
00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:53.860
So basically she had moved down to Los Angeles when she was 20.

920
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:57.310
She's now 25 and after a short stint in the military,

921
00:56:57.430 --> 00:57:01.960
some hours she got into the porn industry for eight months.
She did everything.

922
00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:05.350
Ooh,
fuck.
Shocked.
The whole Shebang.

923
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.540
I asked her if I could see her video,

924
00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:11.230
but she wouldn't tell me her performer name.
It said Vietnam,

925
00:57:11.231 --> 00:57:14.620
the that it would be impossible to find her body of work.

926
00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.730
I asked her why she got into porn and she replies,

927
00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:25.620
cause I wanted some feeling in my life and then he rides dao.

928
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:29.800
Ji Ji is,
yeah,
dude.
Oh this poor girl.
Something happened to her.

929
00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:32.170
The thing was she was clean,

930
00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:37.030
had a good job and I really liked her and the sex was great.
Yeah,
obviously,

931
00:57:37.031 --> 00:57:37.511
you know,
it's funny,

932
00:57:37.511 --> 00:57:39.580
there was something you wrote in the beginning where I just thought she was

933
00:57:39.581 --> 00:57:44.140
going to be good.
29 year old guy.
Attractive all around.
Great girl.

934
00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:49.900
Oh,
the fact that you said she had a rough brain upbringing,

935
00:57:49.901 --> 00:57:53.230
but she was easy going and honest and not bitchy right there.
I was like,

936
00:57:53.231 --> 00:57:58.150
that girl's good in bed.
That just seemed like a kind of free open person.

937
00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:02.660
I don't know.
I didn't know she was going to be that open owed EEG.
Um,
anyways,

938
00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:07.610
the thing was,
she was clean and I have a blog.
The sex is great,

939
00:58:07.611 --> 00:58:12.611
but I couldn't stop picturing her in some sleazy porno that was probably filmed

940
00:58:12.681 --> 00:58:14.600
in some junk yard on labrea.

941
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:18.380
So I went to ask for friend's advice.

942
00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:23.440
Most of my guys were telling me to dumper my gay friends told me it was fabulous

943
00:58:24.531 --> 00:58:26.240
and then I should overlook it.

944
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:30.230
I didn't even bother asking my girlfriends because they would automatically

945
00:58:30.231 --> 00:58:34.040
reject her and assume I had aids.
There you go,
keep your options open.

946
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:36.470
So regretfully I dumped her,

947
00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:43.120
I felt terrible and obviously didn't tell her it was because she was a porn star

948
00:58:43.610 --> 00:58:46.940
because she would have been ashamed for the rest of her life and I was happy

949
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:50.630
that she was honest with me.
I've done my fair share of sleeves,

950
00:58:50.631 --> 00:58:54.920
but this was too much.
My question bill was,
Bill,
my question bill,

951
00:58:54.921 --> 00:58:58.400
was it wrong for me to dump her for some decisions she made years ago?

952
00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:03.290
Should I have stayed with her?
What would have you done?
Um,

953
00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.880
well you don't want to know what I would've done.
I'm a fucking degenerate.

954
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:09.770
So lets you,
you seem like a good person

955
00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:14.473
dude.

956
00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:17.480
When you're trying to find the person you're going to spend the rest of your

957
00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:20.990
life with you,
you have to have a list of criteria.
All right.

958
00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:23.860
Sound like you're still young.
So there's no reason to compromise.

959
00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:24.590
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

960
00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:25.423
<v 8>All right.</v>

961
00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:29.400
I mean when you get with somebody like that and you're going to live with them

962
00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:33.150
and you wouldn't get with anybody,
you're taking on all of their fucking baggage.

963
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:34.040
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

964
00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.850
<v 8>All right.
You're only three months in</v>

965
00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:42.290
and you know people who go into the porn industry that,
you know,

966
00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:47.920
it's like people would come,
comedians were not healthy individuals.
Okay.

967
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:51.760
And that is like a specific area that I just,

968
00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:55.540
this is just my own personal nonmedical feeling that you're just not a healthy

969
00:59:55.541 --> 01:00:00.490
person.
Something awful happen.
And that line,
I just wanted to feel something.

970
01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:04.960
I mean,
something bad happened to her,
caused her to Waller self off.

971
01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.650
I don't even want to try to guess what,
but you know,

972
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:11.263
<v 0>okay,</v>

973
01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:15.260
<v 8>there's nothing wrong with anything that she did purse.
You don't technically,</v>

974
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.910
and she was honest with it.

975
01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.020
It all comes down to whether or not you want to deal with it all right.

976
01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:22.580
And if you feel that you know,

977
01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:25.910
you want to deal with it and that there was this sort of connection that you

978
01:00:25.911 --> 01:00:28.070
just had,
this girl had to be in your life,

979
01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:30.110
then you're going to have to learn to live with it.

980
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:30.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

981
01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.030
<v 8>And get past it.</v>

982
01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:33.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

983
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:35.070
<v 8>MMM.</v>

984
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:41.050
But I would be definitely,

985
01:00:41.051 --> 01:00:46.051
I would definitely be concerned with a certain mental issues,

986
01:00:49.650 --> 01:00:51.720
um,
now like she's insane.

987
01:00:52.410 --> 01:00:56.340
And then I would also be concerned with,
uh,

988
01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:57.320
<v 0>okay.</v>

989
01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.610
<v 8>Sexual boundaries.</v>

990
01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:00.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

991
01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:00.933
<v 8>You know?</v>

992
01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:01.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

993
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:06.910
<v 8>Like would she have any and could she remain faithful after a while and when you</v>

994
01:01:07.671 --> 01:01:10.160
settle into the seven year itch or whatever,

995
01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:11.400
<v 0>yeah.</v>

996
01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.870
<v 8>And you really start needing to work at the relationship and it's feeling boring</v>

997
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:19.380
and she needs to feel something again.
Is she going to go back to that?

998
01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:21.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

999
01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:25.190
<v 8>Leather couch from that show,
Martin,
my end,
you know,</v>

1000
01:01:25.191 --> 01:01:28.520
down on fog in the valley and get bagged again.
I mean,
I don't know.

1001
01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:35.210
I Dunno.
That is a,
uh,
that is,
you know what,

1002
01:01:35.211 --> 01:01:37.760
that is beyond my skills.
I don't know how to tame that horse.

1003
01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:42.770
I can tell you that.
Right fucking enough.
I,
I have no fucking clue.
That's a,
a,

1004
01:01:42.771 --> 01:01:44.750
you know what,
that's a doctor drew question.

1005
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1006
01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.440
<v 8>That is a classic doctor drew question.</v>

1007
01:01:48.441 --> 01:01:51.470
And that guy within two seconds we'll get right to the core of it.

1008
01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:56.600
I would call out,
call in love line,
man.
If you're out here,
call him up.

1009
01:01:56.601 --> 01:01:59.150
Cause that's a,
that's a great one.
Um,

1010
01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:02.370
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1011
01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:04.710
<v 8>yeah,
I guess you'd have to figure out is,
is,</v>

1012
01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.860
has she works through whatever the fuck she was working through and now she's

1013
01:02:07.861 --> 01:02:08.694
ready to.

1014
01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:11.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1015
01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.240
<v 8>I mean,
I dunno.
Day,
those are some good looking girls down there and she's like,</v>

1016
01:02:14.241 --> 01:02:18.020
yeah they are or whatever.
Like,
I mean if you kept steering it in that direction,

1017
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:22.130
you'd probably get you fucking threesome right there.
Um,

1018
01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.400
so there's that,
there's that option.

1019
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:28.220
The option that you have is if you're with her,
like I think he can me that.

1020
01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:30.380
That's,
that's a selfish fucking and I,

1021
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:34.050
and a shallow reason to stay with somebody long term.

1022
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:38.060
<v 3>Uh,
yeah.
Geez.
I don't know.</v>

1023
01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.060
Ah,

1024
01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:11.070
it's to police in the corners gun and

1025
01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:18.170
shoot.
Just said,
please don't control the sliders.

1026
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:21.320
Can Be Nice to say.

1027
01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:23.960
Further smile.

1028
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:37.350
<v 8>Um,
all right,
beef Kurt and advice for those of you in the states,</v>

1029
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:41.160
that's a slang for the Hoo Ha beef curtains.

1030
01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:45.630
Do the math.
Think about it.
All right,
you ready?
Okay.
Here we go.

1031
01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:50.430
Here's the situation.
I have a wonderful girl in my life.
Uh,

1032
01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.100
what and when she doesn't know how to fuck.
That's what I'm guessing.

1033
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:55.440
I'm guessing this is where it's going.
I wonderful growing my life.

1034
01:03:55.441 --> 01:04:00.060
Great attitude,
humor,
big tits,
nice ass and a good family.
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

1035
01:04:00.061 --> 01:04:04.170
marry this girl.
Sure.
It seems good for now,
but I have one issue.

1036
01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:07.470
She also has some mean beef curtains.

1037
01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:11.250
Then he put in front sees pussy lips just in case.
I didn't know.
Uh,

1038
01:04:11.251 --> 01:04:16.251
that kind of bug me bug the ever living shit out of me whenever we get down to

1039
01:04:16.411 --> 01:04:18.780
the dirty business.
So much.

1040
01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:24.080
So to the point I looked up some cosmetic surgery that basically gives the beef

1041
01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:28.830
curtains a trim job and beauties the vagina.

1042
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:34.560
Wow,
dude.
Wow.
All right.
Now before I read the rest of this,

1043
01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:37.980
if you're going to fucking ask me how to have this conversation,

1044
01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:44.460
like listen,
love,
I love you,
I love you,
I love your family.
I love you.
You're hot,

1045
01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:47.880
everything.
But is there any way you can trim your beef curtains?

1046
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.940
Maybe you can get away with it cause you got that cool accent.
I don't know.

1047
01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:56.370
But she has it too,
so she's not going to give a fuck.

1048
01:04:56.371 --> 01:05:01.290
He may pull this off with some foreign chick anyways.
Um,

1049
01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:04.680
so he looks up cosmetic surgery to try on a beautify the vagina.

1050
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.750
Now I know by now I must sound like a douchebag focusing on the little things.

1051
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:13.050
No,
because women do that to women.

1052
01:05:13.051 --> 01:05:17.640
Focus on little things like that.
That's a serious dude.

1053
01:05:17.970 --> 01:05:21.090
Sex is a big fucking thing.
But anyways,
he says,
well,

1054
01:05:21.091 --> 01:05:24.000
my thinking is I'm truly going to pull the trigger.

1055
01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:28.620
He spelled it that way and keep this woman all the myself for the rest of my

1056
01:05:28.621 --> 01:05:29.400
life.

1057
01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:34.400
Aren't I entitled to have a great looking VAD to look at it for as long as our

1058
01:05:35.491 --> 01:05:38.730
bodies don't wrinkle away.
Wow.

1059
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:43.170
I know there's a lot of women are fucking annoyed by this one.
Yeah.

1060
01:05:43.171 --> 01:05:45.660
What about you fucking Dick and your wrinkled balls

1061
01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:49.590
once you get a face lift for you sack there buddy.

1062
01:05:49.591 --> 01:05:51.240
I know they're all saying that.
Um,

1063
01:05:51.241 --> 01:05:53.610
how can I ever bring this option up to her without,

1064
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:57.840
I knew he's going to ask me without completely destroying her feelings or making

1065
01:05:57.841 --> 01:06:01.920
her hate me for being so pussy conscious.
Thanks for the read.

1066
01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:05.730
Now go fuck yourself.
All right.
This is a simple one,
dude.

1067
01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:08.160
There is no fucking way

1068
01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:14.130
you can bring that up to her without absolutely completely destroying her

1069
01:06:14.131 --> 01:06:18.080
feelings.
So you either need to accept this or you have to view off the letter.

1070
01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:22.230
Go.
That's it.
That's it.

1071
01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:25.800
I mean,
I would think that if you actually truly cared about this girl,

1072
01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:27.720
now all the chicks are going to be like,
oh,

1073
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.450
<v 9>I knew he had a heart underneath all those c words.</v>

1074
01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:36.790
<v 8>Um,
if you truly care about this girl,
uh,</v>

1075
01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:40.730
I would think that that wouldn't matter.
You know,
and if she looks the way she,

1076
01:06:40.790 --> 01:06:45.380
she's saying you're saying that she looks,
I mean what,
what are we talking here?

1077
01:06:45.381 --> 01:06:49.360
Like how far down when these things hanging as it like you know it's,

1078
01:06:53.570 --> 01:06:56.960
I mean if she got them,
both of them peers,
could you like do like uh,

1079
01:06:56.990 --> 01:07:01.190
could you like as bad as they could you be like,
do you like that Olympic?

1080
01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.380
The fuck is that thing here.
You're on the rings.

1081
01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.190
Could you do that and still swing your feet up and not hit her pussy and we're

1082
01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.720
talking like it's that bad.
You know,

1083
01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:12.420
if you did the iron cross would your head be in her pussy?

1084
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:14.750
Like how far these things hanging down?
Hey now

1085
01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:16.650
<v 9>what's the deal with big gardens?</v>

1086
01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:22.050
<v 8>All right dude,
there's no way
there's,
there's no fucking way.</v>

1087
01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.620
And don't,
don't do that to her because she can't do anything about that.

1088
01:07:25.621 --> 01:07:29.490
If she had a problem with her fucking vaginal area,

1089
01:07:29.491 --> 01:07:32.340
you would have known by now because she would have been self conscious and she

1090
01:07:32.341 --> 01:07:33.840
would have brought it up the way.

1091
01:07:33.841 --> 01:07:37.980
Sometimes girls do about parts of their bodies and they are super self conscious

1092
01:07:37.981 --> 01:07:42.030
about their bodies because we're so fucking visual.
All right.

1093
01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:44.400
I told you one time when the first girls I ever hooked up with,

1094
01:07:44.401 --> 01:07:46.020
when I got her shirt off and her bra off,

1095
01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.770
she rolled her eyes and I thought she was thinking that I,
I was like,
oh my God.

1096
01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:53.490
Like I'm not doing it for like she's rolling her eyes.
Like this guy's lame.

1097
01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:57.480
And I found out later she was self conscious about the size of her breasts.

1098
01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.240
So I totally took it the wrong fucking way.

1099
01:08:00.241 --> 01:08:03.550
I made it all about me because I'm self involved.
So dot.
Yeah,

1100
01:08:03.551 --> 01:08:04.750
don't do that to her.
All right.

1101
01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:08.490
Either you can that that's when you just suddenly have in your head.

1102
01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.380
Either you accept that shit or you move on,

1103
01:08:10.381 --> 01:08:14.850
but there's no reason to hurt this person because you're a shallow cut like me.

1104
01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.233
All right.

1105
01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.800
<v 3>All right.
Cheers.</v>

1106
01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:32.140
[inaudible].
