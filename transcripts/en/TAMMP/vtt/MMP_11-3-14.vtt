00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.440
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.300
November 3rd,
2014 how you,
how you doing?
Jesus Christ.

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.080
I'm trying to get comfortable.
Here is what's going on.
I'm in a,

4
00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:18.830
I'm actually doing this,
my podcast in a studio,
which I never do.

5
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.260
I always do it at home,
laying in my fucking underwear.

6
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.370
Right now I'm in a studio,
the all new,
all things comedy network,

7
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.900
podcast studios.

8
00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:32.980
I'm one of the first guys over here to do a do my podcast that I have to tell

9
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:33.101
you.

10
00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:36.810
It's a wonderful experience so far and I already know what some of you assholes

11
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:37.360
are going to say.

12
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.800
Now that I've given that information that I'm not doing my podcast lying down,

13
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.320
you go,
dude,
you're funnier when you're not seated.

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.290
You to sit there and break my balls about that.
I don't give a shit.

15
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.500
Go ahead and do it because by the time you give me shit,

16
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.110
this thing is already recorded.
What the fuck do I care?

17
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.220
I've gotten all of my life.
I'm down the street having a snow cone,
you know,

18
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.680
that's the life I'm living.
Huh?

19
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.330
When do that you're not about this life hit the white mainstream.

20
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.550
If I hear one more white person fucking say that like they,

21
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.330
that Scott's going to be the next um,
African American,

22
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.090
uh,
expression that they're going to have like old white grandmother sang and

23
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:20.230
fucking cheesy comics.
Sorry.
Cheesy comedies.

24
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.410
I,
when I sipped it,
that does sound like a fart there.

25
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.340
I just sip some water there.
Um,
you're not about this life.
Oh Shit.

26
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:30.200
The old white lady shed the thing.

27
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:34.430
The young black kids say if only she could give the finger and there was an

28
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:39.110
orangutan,
you'd have yourself self a comedy.
Um,
all right.
So how the,

29
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:43.220
how the hell are you idol?
I had a long ass frigging week,
week and weekend.
Uh,

30
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.330
ended up going to a wedding.
You guys like going to those things?

31
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.580
You don't went to weddings?
You know,
I loved about this wedding.

32
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:52.760
There was no dancing.
Okay?
And when you as white as me,

33
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.000
that is a very enjoyable moment.
You know what I mean?
Oh my God,

34
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.030
this is going to be booze and there's going to be no dancing and you're going to

35
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:04.720
have a quick beautiful ceremony.
Uh,

36
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.080
is there any way I can retroactively pay for this,
this beautiful service?

37
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.750
It was tremendous.
It's one of the best weddings I've been to.

38
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.500
So I want to thank those two people who got married for having such a wonderful,

39
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.270
beautiful,
yet quick service.
That's what you want,
by the way,

40
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.710
when you get married,

41
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:24.130
all you people out there fucking torture and everyone with you.

42
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.770
Long ass ceremonies,
you know,
like,
yeah,

43
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:29.530
the King and Queen of uh,

44
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.960
one of those stupid countries with the pasty people over there in Europe.

45
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.970
Who else has a king and Queen Leftover in Europe,
England.

46
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.260
They like the Wrigley Field of governments over there.
Right?

47
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:46.880
And they got these fucking jerk offs who just won't stop fucking each other

48
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:48.740
because they got the same kind of bloodline.

49
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.140
So then all of them sort of in a roundabout way look like the English version of

50
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.820
Eli and Peyton manning.
You know,
that's the deal dude.
Like when,
when you,

51
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.500
okay,
or at least when you go to procreate,
you got to get outside your circle,

52
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.020
get you got to run a post pattern,
get off your block.
You know what I mean?

53
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.650
You can't start banging the girl next door.
She's right there.

54
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.550
She smelled your toast and all the shit you are eating.
I'm telling you,

55
00:03:16.551 --> 00:03:17.660
you're going to get like a fuck.

56
00:03:17.661 --> 00:03:21.030
I don't know if you're going to give all those weird kids,
um,

57
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.060
who never wants to leave the town,
right?

58
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.200
Molly dreams about his driving a fucking truck to plow the snow.

59
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.310
You know,
it was a big thing when I was in Massachusetts,
you know,

60
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:34.730
getting a fucking state job.
All those guys,
you know,

61
00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:39.731
it's fucked up and angry and on edge and as racist is,

62
00:03:39.831 --> 00:03:42.500
Massachusetts is,
people always goes,
why are they liberal?

63
00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:44.150
Why do they still vote Democrat?

64
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.470
It's because the amount of people there that want to get a state job so they can

65
00:03:48.471 --> 00:03:52.100
lean on a fucking shovel,
a drive,
one of those orange pickup trucks,

66
00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:56.490
like a half a mile an hour in the breakdown lane
Dillard,

67
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.980
you drive in to fast.
Fucking slow it down.
It's just supposed to take all day.

68
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.660
I knew a guy long time ago I worked in a warehouse and he had,

69
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.980
he quit the postal service because he was bored out of his mind.

70
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.880
He was a young kid and he knew somebody and he got in with the post,
uh,

71
00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:16.640
working for the post office and he went out and he did his route and he got,

72
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.280
he was done with it by 11,
and the old timers go,

73
00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:21.920
what the fuck are you doing here?
Get out of here.

74
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.460
Don't come back till four o'clock.
You're going to fuck this whole thing up.

75
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.060
So he went out and he like went to the movies and got like a sandwich and came

76
00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:32.420
back and he just,
because he was raised right,

77
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.550
he couldn't live a life like that right now.

78
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.620
You know what I love it says possibly somebody who works one of those jobs

79
00:04:39.621 --> 00:04:40.454
listing right now.

80
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.850
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.200
<v 0>And I want to,
I want to ask you,
how do you live with yourself?</v>

82
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.010
How do you get up every morning and take an eight hours to do a fucking two hour

83
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:49.090
job?
How do you do that shit?

84
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.953
<v 1>You know what I mean?</v>

85
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.900
<v 0>Do you really feel like you're getting any,</v>

86
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.970
like you're getting away with something?
Just I met,

87
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.180
we'd be just be torture.
Just imagine like whatever.

88
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.810
Just make anything take four times longer than it should.

89
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.283
<v 1>Right.</v>

90
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.280
<v 0>Cooking yourself an egg in the morning.</v>

91
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

92
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.260
<v 0>Cooking it on low and just sitting there fucking ran the thing being ready in</v>

93
00:05:15.261 --> 00:05:18.920
like three minutes,
12 minutes later there's a fucking fried egg.

94
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.040
That's the worst example ever.
But you know what?
I made step on the gas pedal.

95
00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:29.420
You piece of shit.
Um,
no,
it's awful.
I'm so pro union,

96
00:05:29.421 --> 00:05:32.540
it's ridiculous.
But I feel like so many of the unions literally became,

97
00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:35.000
what the fuck they were fighting and then they just became assholes.

98
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:37.940
And then the corporations were like,
well,
you know,
fuck you.

99
00:05:37.941 --> 00:05:42.320
Then keep your union and we'll take the factory.
We will move it elsewhere.
Oh,

100
00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:44.090
look at this.
It's a third world country.

101
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

102
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.710
<v 0>Are there any laws even down here?
Fuck it.</v>

103
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.640
We'll go back to plain people the way we did before the triangle.

104
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:55.780
Shirtwaist fire there.
Look at me.
Oh,
who took a double deck?

105
00:05:55.781 --> 00:06:00.610
A tour bus in fucking new.
I did this guy.
All right.

106
00:06:00.611 --> 00:06:03.610
What did I just fucking lean back too far on the chair and I disconnected it.

107
00:06:03.611 --> 00:06:05.530
You know what we,
you know,
it's this a brand new studio,

108
00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:06.880
so we're going to have some glitches.

109
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.320
<v 2>There was a glitch that's just boom.</v>

110
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.740
<v 0>Anyway,
so they just fucking,</v>

111
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:16.040
people were making shirts and when you made shirts back then you had a,

112
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:20.870
you had a little bit of waste yet.
Shirtwaist
long story short,

113
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.690
somebody threw a fucking cigarette in there.
I don't know what happened.

114
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.650
They didn't have any fire escapes and the God damn doors,
we'll lock that.

115
00:06:26.651 --> 00:06:30.300
Everybody had to like basically jump to their fucking deaths.
And uh,

116
00:06:30.301 --> 00:06:34.460
that was the reference.
It's not a very funny reference,
but it is a reference.

117
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.840
Um,
speaking of what should you guys see that,
uh,
that virgin,
uh,

118
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.820
airplane that goes out into space crashed fucking terrifying.

119
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:48.821
Is that through the God damn the balls to be a test pilot to go up the I,

120
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.080
we designed this thing now on paper this thing should work and then you have to

121
00:06:57.591 --> 00:06:58.424
go up there.

122
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.880
It basically see if it works and then once it works you have to start seeing

123
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:06.410
what,
how big the f the,

124
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:10.700
the fucking what the envelope within this thing can perform in,

125
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.680
which basically involves what they,
what the,
you know,

126
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.390
the whole pushing the envelope.
Like whatever.

127
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:20.990
Just say you flew a helicopter and they said you can't go beyond 102 knots or

128
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:24.260
else you'd get fucking uh,
retreating blade stall.

129
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.270
Like how do you learn how to do that?

130
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.160
That means some mother fucker has to go 103 nuts,
104 cause you know,

131
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:35.780
when they say it's 102,
you know,
they,
they still stop it way before,

132
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.190
but it means somebody had to have the balls to just keep pushing that stick

133
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:44.840
forward.
I mean,

134
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:49.841
what the what they think standup comics of fucking psychos to be a test pile.

135
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.010
I mean it then you know what's the worst thing about that is what excites you

136
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:56.990
after that?
Once you're on the fucking ground.

137
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.720
<v 2>Oh,
you,
I'm so happy you're home.
Look what I did.</v>

138
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.680
I rearranged the furniture here.
This is great.

139
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:08.350
It just like opens up the room,
don't you think?

140
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.790
Why don't you just stare at me like that when I say thanks.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:18.250
I'm not 30,000 feet off the fucking ground,

142
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.000
but down here holding down the fort for you.

143
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.970
Well,
you're coming from,
Huh?

144
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.240
Did you get another blow job after one of your test flights

145
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.280
<v 0>and what does he do?
He just stares at it,
right?</v>

146
00:08:32.281 --> 00:08:35.760
Maybe starts laughing like Ray Liotta and Goodfellas

147
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.910
and it fucking lap.

148
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.030
So he's wiping his eye and he goes back out to a rocket ship with Joe Pesi a

149
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.470
doubt.
Fuck.
I'd have people a day.
That's your life then.

150
00:08:46.471 --> 00:08:50.490
You can't relate to anybody anymore.
That's the deal.

151
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.840
Everybody's looking at you like,
what's your fucking problem?
It's like,

152
00:08:54.841 --> 00:08:56.150
what's fucking problem?
I've,

153
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.860
<v 3>I've been like a,
I went to the moon.</v>

154
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.740
That's my problem now talking to you who uh,
you know,

155
00:09:03.741 --> 00:09:06.790
I went to the Patriots Broncos game and you got your fucking eyebrows up.

156
00:09:06.791 --> 00:09:10.420
Like what you just did was exciting and I'm sorry I'm having a little difficult,

157
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.440
a little difficult time relating to you right now.
You know,

158
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.900
and you know,
his wife has given of Shit.

159
00:09:16.901 --> 00:09:20.500
You have to stop bringing up the fact that you've been to space.

160
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.750
You know that you test pilots,
test pilots,
you test airplanes anyway,
so,

161
00:09:25.751 --> 00:09:30.160
um,
so they got this plane that goes up into space.
I mean,

162
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.640
and they're just going to go try this fucking thing out the balls of those guys.

163
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.220
Unfortunately it didn't fucking work out.
Dude is no fucking way.

164
00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:42.600
Do you realize the amount of fucking jackass is

165
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:49.140
slash former members of boy bands that are just lining up to pay 200 grand to be

166
00:09:49.811 --> 00:09:51.910
the first fucking jerk off,

167
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:58.170
absolute fucking jerk off to get on one of those things.
Ct.
Okay.

168
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:03.070
If he,
if he got 200 grand to do it,
keep it in your pocket.
All right.

169
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.690
Let other people be the test pilot passengers for this fucking thing.

170
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.760
You don't do that.
It's like,
oh,
it's like when,
when like,

171
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.220
like a new fucking iPhone comes out when,

172
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.080
when they came up with that lasik eye surgery,
you know,

173
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.500
and people will get blinded and they will fucking it up cause it was new.

174
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.230
You don't fuck with new technology is all I'm saying.

175
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.790
It's fucking idiot.
I want to go up in space.

176
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.720
You're nuts.
You're nuts.
Why would you,
you know what,

177
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.500
I actually got to think here.
What would I rather do?
What would you rather do?

178
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:41.790
Would you rather risky life going into space or go scuba diving?

179
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.520
To me,
those are the two big,

180
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:48.780
the two probably most terrifying things I've ever seen in my life.
Oh yeah.

181
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.450
I gotta tell you this weekend,
I fucking,
uh,
when I went to that wedding,

182
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.790
there was a,
I was out in palm desert and um,

183
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.820
state this really cool hotel that had this,
um,

184
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.680
this basically lounge act.
And I don't want to disrespect the person,

185
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:08.790
but it was a lounge and he was doing his act right.
And,
uh,
you know,

186
00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:11.880
older guys like in his sixties or whatever and he was singing the shit out of

187
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:16.470
these Frank Sinatra songs.
He was great,
really was great.
And um,

188
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.730
and it was fun watching the older people watch the guy cause in the end he had

189
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:21.241
all this whole,

190
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:24.900
this whole patriotic thing when he did like a salute to the troops except it was

191
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:28.710
real,
you know what I mean?
It's just a different time.

192
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.810
Like these guys are like a,

193
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:32.300
<v 1>okay,</v>

194
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.920
<v 3>well wait a minute.
He was born in 1949 I think I looked him up.</v>

195
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.680
So he would have been 20 in 1969,

196
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.940
I'll fuck daddy's probably the Woodstock generation.

197
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.630
Anytime I see old people like saluting the flag,

198
00:11:46.631 --> 00:11:48.400
I just think they fought in World War II.

199
00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.760
I think I watched too many episodes of that.
Ken Burns the warp,
but whatever.

200
00:11:51.761 --> 00:11:54.030
It was a nice thing.
And uh,
the

201
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.520
<v 0>veterans in the crowd stood up a bunch of old guys and all that.</v>

202
00:11:56.521 --> 00:12:00.020
It was a really nice thing.
But in between,
he was telling these,
uh,
um,

203
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.990
he was a hundred percent Sicilian and he was telling these fucking old old,

204
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.640
old school jokes that of course would bomb and a comedy club within the context

205
00:12:08.641 --> 00:12:11.730
of what he was doing.
They were great.
And uh,
one of the things he said,
he said,

206
00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:16.230
uh,
you know,
I'm a hundred percent Sicilian.
My,
uh,

207
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.430
my birthstone is cement or something like that,
which obviously,
you know,

208
00:12:20.431 --> 00:12:24.120
fucking high old time joke,
but it just reminded me

209
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.400
of a,
one of the worst deaths.
I've actually thought about this.

210
00:12:29.401 --> 00:12:33.750
Like if somebody ever,
uh,
you know,

211
00:12:33.751 --> 00:12:37.830
one of the take you out and you're standing on a fucking boat in cement that's

212
00:12:37.831 --> 00:12:41.400
drying and it's at night and it taken you out into the ocean and they're just

213
00:12:41.401 --> 00:12:45.600
going to toss you fucking overboard.
I would be just standing there weeping,

214
00:12:45.601 --> 00:12:48.080
just going,
just shoot me.
Just fuck.
Yeah,
they big guy.

215
00:12:48.081 --> 00:12:51.720
We can't man the blood splatter.
We've got to get caught.
Well,

216
00:12:51.721 --> 00:12:53.980
can you fucking shoot me as your throw me it.

217
00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:01.560
Just give me a gun,
right as you throw me in,
I'm going to pull the trigger.

218
00:13:01.561 --> 00:13:05.760
Is that all right?
I'll count to 1000 now already be in the water and won't work.

219
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.230
Like what happens is that already medical person out there?
Is it a quick death?

220
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.703
I just can't imagine.

221
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.870
That's your fucking going down waiting for your God damn head to explode

222
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.160
and then you'd want it like somehow like just take a big gulp of water to end it

223
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.840
and uh,
you couldn't,
your body wouldn't let you fuck it.
Oh my God.
You're like,

224
00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:35.841
just kills me about that is you just keep going down and down and down and down.

225
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

226
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:43.380
<v 0>Way Past where all the fucking submarines,
anybody's ever fucking God.</v>

227
00:13:43.381 --> 00:13:44.670
You're just,
you're going to keep going.

228
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.940
Now granted the pressure is gonna fucking kv in at some point,

229
00:13:50.941 --> 00:13:54.210
right?
Just that the fucking weight of that water,

230
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.510
you know,

231
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.480
it'd be worse if your survival instinct kicked in and you kept clearing your

232
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:04.360
ears as you went down for as long as you fucking could.
You just

233
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.630
like just some futile attempt to just survive.

234
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:16.570
You keep clearing the fucking air out of your you station tubes,
you know,

235
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:20.860
see a fucking ear drum stone explode.
Oh Christ.

236
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.750
What a fucking way to go.

237
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:27.010
And that's all I'd actually zoned out as he was singing.

238
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.170
<v 2>What is a man?
What has he got?</v>

239
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.970
Damn that himself,
that a shot,

240
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.410
<v 0>right?
I just kept it the whole time he was singing that</v>

241
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.540
<v 2>to speak the Whoa t 20 fields.</v>

242
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:42.881
<v 0>Right?</v>

243
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:47.881
I always just picturing going down to the bottom of the ocean and cement shoes.

244
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.470
<v 2>Not the words of one who deals,
it was like this little Goodfellow</v>

245
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.600
<v 0>film film was going on in my head.
I mean,
granted,</v>

246
00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:00.190
I was a couple scotches in,
Oh,
you know what?
So,
um,

247
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.440
it was a buddy of mine who got married and I was supposed to get him some sick

248
00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:06.650
guys and I've been so busy with my day job.

249
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:07.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

250
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.610
<v 3>Um,
writing on the a or sitting in the room pitching</v>

251
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:15.730
<v 0>jokes on the soon to be hit animated show in December of 2015 f is for family.</v>

252
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.400
I'm going to hype this fucking show.

253
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.670
I'm going to hype this fucking show for a year.
So you guys better get,

254
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:25.760
you've got to get ready.
You know what I'm literally doing?

255
00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:27.920
Like when they said this,
you know,

256
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:29.800
when they hyped it and when it's actually coming out,

257
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.200
it's like how long it takes for a guy on the mass pike

258
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.330
<v 3>to drive to a pothole fucking a mile away.</v>

259
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.113
<v 1>MMM.</v>

260
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.220
<v 3>Anyway,
so I didn't have time to get the cigars right.</v>

261
00:15:41.221 --> 00:15:45.540
So I got to hook up out here to get the old fucking,
uh,
Cubanos there.

262
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.503
<v 1>And um,</v>

263
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.200
<v 3>anyways,
this,
uh,
I didn't do it.
So I go out to palm desert and I'm like,</v>

264
00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:56.040
all right,
there's all these old fucking staunch Republicans out here.

265
00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.510
They all got money.

266
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

267
00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.450
<v 3>They all like playing golf.
They like smoking fucking cigars.</v>

268
00:16:01.451 --> 00:16:04.570
I know they got Cuban cigars,
so I just don't go to a smoke shop.

269
00:16:04.571 --> 00:16:07.540
I look for a high end fucking place that actually has a little bit of a lounge

270
00:16:07.541 --> 00:16:11.800
thing,
right.
You know,
fucking wooden Indian outside and Shit,
you know,

271
00:16:11.801 --> 00:16:13.630
all the old school stuff.
So I find one right?

272
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.080
And I walk in there and I'm just like,
hey man,
just,
uh,
it's my buddies,

273
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.873
<v 1>you know,</v>

274
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.230
<v 3>uh,
he got married today.
I'm in between the,</v>

275
00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:25.350
actually the wedding ceremony and the after party.
I was supposed to get cigars.

276
00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:28.080
I fucked up.
Can you help me out?
He goes,
yeah,
sure.
Come on in the human door.

277
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.310
So I say to the guy,
hey,
you got any,
you know,
you got any,
uh,
Monte Cristo or uh,

278
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.990
you know,
party gas,
any,
any fucking,
you know,
basically.
And he goes,
uh,
I go,

279
00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:37.853
you got some Cubans.

280
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.360
<v 0>He goes,
well,
I got these over here and I go,
you got any Cuban cigars?</v>

281
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:46.670
And he goes,
killed at set.
Guards are illegal in the United States of America.

282
00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.323
<v 1>Ugh.</v>

283
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.410
<v 0>It's one of the fucking slap him in the face with a book of matches out.
Really?</v>

284
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.630
Thank you.
Like,
I don't fucking know that

285
00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.690
Jesus fucking Christ.

286
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:00.300
<v 1>Okay,</v>

287
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.700
<v 0>well,
maybe because I looked like a cop.
He said it and me.
What the f</v>

288
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.280
heroin is not legal.
What led that?
You know,
I know it isn't.
I'd still like some,

289
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:15.310
I'm asking you to do an illegal transaction here.
I have cash.

290
00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.990
I'm willing to,
I've never fucking been,
and you know,

291
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.770
every place I go to out here,
you just fuck it.
Ask Him.
They have him in the back.

292
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:21.830
And this is what's funny is

293
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.300
<v 3>people say,
they say this shit,
right?
They'll go,
uh,</v>

294
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.220
<v 1>yeah.</v>

295
00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:25.521
<v 0>You know,</v>

296
00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:30.521
actually or like 99.999 to 99% of the fucking Cuban cigars in this country are

297
00:17:34.461 --> 00:17:35.900
fake.
And you know what?

298
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:41.200
They're wrong because I've been outside this country and I've smoked him and

299
00:17:41.611 --> 00:17:44.430
they taste the exact same.
And then they're going to say,
well,
you know,

300
00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:47.820
once Castro,
fucking Bluebell,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

301
00:17:47.821 --> 00:17:49.980
All those companies fucking out of Cuba,

302
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.190
go fuck yourself with your theories.

303
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:54.440
<v 4>Okay?</v>

304
00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.830
<v 0>You read an article on one of those websites that have lists.</v>

305
00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:01.760
I don't give a shit.
All I know is that the Cuban cigar that I smoked in Paris,

306
00:18:01.761 --> 00:18:05.390
France tastes the same as the one out here.
Okay?
So whatever it is,

307
00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.930
and that thing tastes way better than all of the fucking legal ones.

308
00:18:08.931 --> 00:18:13.820
All those other ones that they say,
oh,
this Davidoff fucking Nicaraguan,
you know,

309
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:18.530
tastes better.
Don't tested higher than the Cuba ones.
Go Fuck Yourself.

310
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:19.881
Go Fuck Yourself.

311
00:18:19.881 --> 00:18:22.760
You're still comparing them to compete Cuban cigars and there's a reason for it.

312
00:18:22.761 --> 00:18:26.750
It's just like however you fucking car compares itself to something German or

313
00:18:26.751 --> 00:18:31.310
Italian or whatever,
right?
This is like a Ferrari,
except it's only 40 grand.

314
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.300
You know,
by the way,
I,
uh,

315
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.150
I'm going to talk cars here for a second.

349
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.710

I don't know.
All right,
here we go.

350
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.830
All right,
90%.

351
00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:46.240
That's the percent of your life that you're in your underwear and your
underwear.

352
00:20:46.241 --> 00:20:49.720
It gets old,
fast,
gross and always gets gross.

353
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.140
It's unbelievable how putting on a great pair of underwear changes your entire

354
00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:55.950
outlook for that day.
That's not a joke.
Uh,

355
00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:00.070
you know that feeling of putting on that ratty old saggy underwear.

356
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.460
I want you to know the feeling of wearing great fitting underwear.

357
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:07.810
Great looking underwear.
Underwear that cares about your balls.

358
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.470
All right?
You need to know about me undies.
Dotcom.

359
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.530
Me undies has the most comfortable underwear you have ever tried on.

360
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.900
They fit perfectly.
They don't ride up on you.

361
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.680
They literally pull moisture away from your skin.
Gross.

362
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.950
Uh,
so you're cool all day long.

363
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:30.190
Who has sweaty balls?
Who is sweaty balls that isn't walking around working out.

364
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:30.941
You know,

365
00:21:30.941 --> 00:21:33.820
and I think a lot of guys have sweaty balls and I think me undies is filling a

366
00:21:33.821 --> 00:21:36.400
void here.
So if you're one of those sweaty ball guys,

367
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.720
here's the rest of the copy.

368
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.200
Here's what I love me undies is environmentally friendly.

369
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.880
Well doesn't that depend on what you eat?
You know,

370
00:21:45.881 --> 00:21:47.560
because once you put your skid marks in there,

371
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:50.350
if you're fucking eating a bunch of processed food,
you know,

372
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.480
it's like when you put rat poison down,
right?
The rat eats sitting in,

373
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.310
the coyote eats the rat and,

374
00:21:56.311 --> 00:21:59.200
and the mountain lion eats the fucking coyote and they all die the same poison.

375
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.900
Is it bill?
I don't think it is.
All right.

376
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.440
The materials they use are sustainably sourced

377
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.200
shit.
Sorry,
I touch the screen.

378
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:12.670
They're sustainably sourced from the Austrian Alps and they are completely

379
00:22:12.671 --> 00:22:13.504
natural.

380
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:18.100
They also use a CO2 neutral process with a low carbon footprint.

381
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:22.930
They save water and energy due to their spun dried fiber process.

382
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.110
You know what?
I might have to try these fucking things.
I got to get a pair.

383
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.710
They have cool styles for both men and women and they all look great.

384
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:33.370
Check out the photos yourself,

405
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.100
Leasing a postage meter is expensive with multiyear commitments and hidden fees.

00:24:40.231 --> 00:24:42.930
let's talk cause um,

423
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.100
so I've been threatening that I was going to buy a new car.

424
00:24:47.101 --> 00:24:49.740
The old priests is getting old.
The old fucking Prius.

425
00:24:49.741 --> 00:24:51.090
She ain't what she used to be.

426
00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:52.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

427
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:53.860
<v 3>Actually,
to be honest with you,</v>

428
00:24:53.861 --> 00:24:57.950
only need to do is get a little interior work done.
Just fresh interrupt.

429
00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.170
But uh,
you know,
there's a couple of cars out there.
They got my eye on,

430
00:25:01.171 --> 00:25:04.060
one of them was a Mercedes Benz and,
um,

431
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:08.100
AMG fucking psycho level car,
right?
And a,

432
00:25:08.101 --> 00:25:12.060
the other day yesterday I saw one on the highway.
Is this ever happened to you?

433
00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.490
You see your fucking dream car,
you see the car you want to,

434
00:25:14.491 --> 00:25:15.540
when they need drive up and you're like,

435
00:25:15.541 --> 00:25:19.110
I just gotta see what the person looks like that's driving it.

436
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.650
I bet they look like an astronaut fucking test pilot of some shit.
Right?

437
00:25:22.651 --> 00:25:25.440
A war hero.
I do it.
I pulled up along this car.

438
00:25:25.441 --> 00:25:28.380
This guy could not have looked like more of a fucking dirt bag.

439
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.840
He's like in his twenties,
you know,
at age,

440
00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:35.430
just look like a fucking,
I can't even,

441
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:40.830
I can't explain it because I'll get in trouble,
you know,
and not,

442
00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:44.070
not really by the fucking politically correct police.
Just by,
you know,

443
00:25:44.071 --> 00:25:48.690
this nationality of people like they like if pitbulls became human beings,

444
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:50.443
um,

445
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.200
<v 0>it just looked like a fuck.
Like I,</v>

446
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.350
if I haven't had a daughter and this guy showed up at the door,

447
00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.780
<v 3>t t to date her,
I,
I don't know what I would do.</v>

448
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.250
<v 0>I would do something fucking crazy and then I would start weeping afterwards.</v>

449
00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:07.590
He just looked like the biggest piece of shit ever.
And that was just like,

450
00:26:07.591 --> 00:26:11.940
am I a piece of shit?
I am a piece of shit,
but am I that kind of a piece of shit?

451
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.390
Is that what I'm going to look like?
But then if I get the car,

452
00:26:15.391 --> 00:26:16.890
other people will be,
oh,
that's my dream car.

453
00:26:16.891 --> 00:26:18.030
And they're gonna pull up alongside him.

454
00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.700
See fucking Ron Howard driving the thing.
It's going to ruin it for,

455
00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.660
I think Mercedes Benz Oughta pay me not to buy one of their cars

456
00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.770
or at least give a free tinted window.

457
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:30.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

458
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.630
<v 0>Package to me.
So it doesn't fucking hurt.
They're hurt their product.
Um,</v>

459
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:36.240
<v 1>okay.</v>

460
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.670
<v 3>I Dunno,
but I'm going to get one for this and this what I'm doing,</v>

461
00:26:38.671 --> 00:26:40.230
I'm waiting right now.

462
00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:43.420
I can get the car but I have to wait till the downstairs is done in my house.

463
00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.720
You know,
cause that is a bad fucking move.

464
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.510
You don't want to go out and buy a new car and when people are doing work on

465
00:26:49.511 --> 00:26:49.841
your house,

466
00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:53.050
cause they'll still just think like okay this guy isn't spreading themselves too

467
00:26:53.051 --> 00:26:57.550
thin.
This guy is just bottomless.
All right.
It's not fucking true.

468
00:26:57.551 --> 00:26:58.090
I mean you get,

469
00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:02.740
you can get yourself in any car for like 1500 bucks now signed a god Damn Lisa

470
00:27:02.741 --> 00:27:05.200
on the thing.
They don't give a shit.
They give you fucking eight miles a month.

471
00:27:05.201 --> 00:27:08.910
Your,
it's all good,
right?
You drive home,
you already over the miles,
any,

472
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.260
any fucking jerk.
That's a thing now about cars.

473
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:13.090
Back in the day when you had to buy him,

474
00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.740
you actually had to be able to afford them.

475
00:27:14.741 --> 00:27:17.860
So if somebody came down the street and a Cadillac or Mercedes or something like

476
00:27:17.861 --> 00:27:18.011
that,

477
00:27:18.011 --> 00:27:21.310
you could look at that man and it was a man because those bitches stayed home

478
00:27:21.311 --> 00:27:23.140
back then.
Right?
It was a fucking man.

479
00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:25.060
And you could look at and hold your head high and go,

480
00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.290
I wonder who the fuck he robbed to get that Goddamn car?
What did he do?

481
00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.910
You know,
that's the great thing about being an entertainer is people,
you know,

482
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.530
you gotta admit,
you know,
entertainers,
we earned our money.

483
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:43.430
We started out in the fucking lounges,
you know,
um,

484
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:45.880
I'm totally doing this,
lobbing it over the net.

485
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.980
So you fucking cunt out there can actually rip me apart and say that I don't

486
00:27:50.981 --> 00:27:54.940
deserve it.
Um,
no,
I think I'm a,

487
00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:58.570
I just gotta get through this fucking built.

488
00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.480
Once they just finished this fucking thing,
it's almost done.
People,

489
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.840
they literally,
they put in the hardwood floors.
Okay,

490
00:28:04.841 --> 00:28:09.841
I have floors downstairs now they're putting a tile in and the fucking laundry

491
00:28:10.001 --> 00:28:13.810
room that's going to be done.
Everything's going to fucking make sense.

492
00:28:13.811 --> 00:28:17.830
Do you know my fucking Washer and dryer were in a closet off of my kitchen.

493
00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.840
Does that make any fucking sense?

494
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.220
Put them downstairs now we turned the laundry room upstairs into a walk in

495
00:28:24.221 --> 00:28:29.080
pantry.
All right,
so I can resell it someday because I,

496
00:28:29.081 --> 00:28:30.250
one thing I've learned about women,

497
00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.210
they like being able to walk into something where they can put a bunch of shit.

498
00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:39.430
You know,
they don't want a closet.
They want to walk into the closet.
Oh my God.

499
00:28:39.431 --> 00:28:42.820
Look at them.
I couldn't walk in and put all my stuff here.

500
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.460
They were in a kitchen.
They liked the kitchen.

501
00:28:45.461 --> 00:28:47.350
But if they can walk into a Pantry,

502
00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.060
I could put the flower over here and a mic thorough.
I've been there.

503
00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.860
I can walk into it.
That's what you want to do.
Like if I was still a single man,

504
00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.670
I would build like some sort of walk in closet,
like a mini one,

505
00:29:00.671 --> 00:29:04.750
like leading to my Dick.
Right.
And then you just go out to the,

506
00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.060
actually it didn't Justin Timberlake through that when he put his,

507
00:29:07.061 --> 00:29:08.110
put his dick in a box.

508
00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:10.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

509
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.240
<v 3>Gosh,
you know,
not every idea is going to be original.
Um,
anyways,
so anyway,</v>

510
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.370
I can I can I give you guys a little bit of promotion here at the all things

511
00:29:17.371 --> 00:29:21.900
comedy network?
That was a eight.
It's a podcast network that I,
um,

512
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:28.160
I started with a Al Madrigal and a couple other fellers and,

513
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:30.510
um,
it's basically a,
you know,

514
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:32.350
<v 1>okay.</v>

515
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.660
<v 3>It's basically owned and operated by standup comics.</v>

516
00:29:34.661 --> 00:29:37.720
And we don't own anybody's podcasts.
We don't try to fuck anybody out of money.

517
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.850
All right?
But things,
things do cost money.
So we're having this here.

518
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.570

Dean del Rey,
myself,</v>

527
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:21.360
Al Madrigal and Philippe s Barraza uh,
you gotta listen to him.

528
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:26.250
Did I say his name right?
As far as Esparza,
I'm the fucking worst.
Um,

529
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:26.821
and you know what,

530
00:30:26.821 --> 00:30:30.180
in such a fucking crime that I didn't say his name correctly cause he had the

531
00:30:30.181 --> 00:30:32.630
best goddamn stories I've ever heard.
You've got to listen to it.

532
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:36.890
<v 3>Um,
such a white guy from the fucking east coast.</v>

533
00:30:36.891 --> 00:30:41.090
I can't anything remotely Latino.
I can't even pronounce it.
Um,

534
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.360
that's embarrassing of listen to all just fucking comedy too.

535
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:48.770
What a piece of shit I am.
Anyways,
check it out.
It's going to be on iTunes.
Um,

536
00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:51.230
all right,
let's get back to the podcast.
Can we talk a little football?

537
00:30:51.231 --> 00:30:55.100
What showed up?
What did the boot it up?
Um,
yeah,

538
00:30:55.101 --> 00:30:57.050
I'm not going to brag about the Patriots beat and the Broncos.

539
00:30:57.051 --> 00:30:58.820
I'm not going to do that.
I'm not going to act like,
you know,

540
00:30:58.821 --> 00:31:02.750
Tom Brady is better than fucking eat.
Uh,

541
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.940
Peyton manning.
I'm not going to do that shit.
I'm not going to do that.
All right.

542
00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.170
I,
you know,
the record speaks for itself.
Head to head match ups.

543
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.033
I hate when people do that

544
00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.710
<v 0>well know always seven to two against the lifetime.</v>

545
00:31:15.711 --> 00:31:17.840
Well I guess that means he's a better quarterback.

546
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.890
I think it all comes down to a,
you know,
when you had your opportunities,

547
00:31:21.891 --> 00:31:23.900
what did you deal with them all right.

548
00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.210
That's basically what it is because everything else is,

549
00:31:26.211 --> 00:31:29.270
you got everybody else on the fucking field.
You know,

550
00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:32.150
people always come up with a reason to blame it on the biggest guy and I don't

551
00:31:32.151 --> 00:31:34.280
think that's necessarily fair.
All right.

552
00:31:34.281 --> 00:31:37.550
Although that picks six he threw against the saints was his fault.

553
00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.320
I'll give him shit on that one.
And,

554
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:44.200
but I also think Brady should have hit west welcome guy was fucking wide open

555
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.520
through to the back shoulder.
Welker OCI should've caught it.

556
00:31:46.521 --> 00:31:50.050
Just a fucking shame.
And then what happened?
Next thing you know Eli,

557
00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:51.750
<v 1>okay,</v>

558
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:56.100
<v 0>the fucking middle child ends up with more rings and Peyton figure that one out.</v>

559
00:31:58.780 --> 00:31:59.510
<v 3>You know?</v>

560
00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:03.500
<v 0>But the thing about Eli that you got to love about that guy is as much as he</v>

561
00:32:03.501 --> 00:32:08.090
looks like he always has a cold,
the bigger the game,
the better he plays.

562
00:32:08.091 --> 00:32:11.120
So I fucking love that guy.
Despite the fact he kiss team kicked,

563
00:32:11.121 --> 00:32:14.360
my team's asked twice in the Superbowl.
But you know what,

564
00:32:14.361 --> 00:32:16.450
when you've won three others,
I guess of,
okay.

565
00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.920
You don't realize that the Patriots are actually,
you have been in.

566
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:20.803
<v 1>MMM,</v>

567
00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.690
<v 0>I think more super bowls.</v>

568
00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.160
<v 3>I mean,
we've been in,
let's see,
we lost to the bears.</v>

569
00:32:27.161 --> 00:32:31.960
We lost to the packers who beat the rams.
We beat the,
uh,
the panthers.

570
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:36.280
We'd beat the eagles.
We also have giant swaths of the giants.
That's seven.
Oh,

571
00:32:36.281 --> 00:32:37.900
record is three and four.

572
00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.860
I think the cowboys had been in the most super bowls.
What's their deal?

573
00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:47.550
They lost to the colts.
Then they beat Miami.

574
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.280
Right.
So those were two
in Miami.

575
00:32:54.281 --> 00:32:59.281
Beat the Redskins and then Steelers beat the cowboys and the cowboys beat the

576
00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:04.960
Broncos.
Then Steelers beat the cowboys.
So that's five.
They'd been in eight,

577
00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:10.210
and then they beat the bills twice and then they beat the Steelers.

578
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.100
<v 0>So they've been an eight pages have been seven Superbowls.</v>

579
00:33:14.101 --> 00:33:18.890
How the fuck did that happen?
The goddamn door doormats to the league,
uh,

580
00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:23.280
played in that high school football stadium.
Unbelievable.
But,
um,
yeah,

581
00:33:23.281 --> 00:33:27.900
I'm not going to brag about shit.
Uh,
you know,
we also let up 21 points.

582
00:33:27.901 --> 00:33:31.260
We still suck against the run and it's also a regular season game and all that

583
00:33:31.261 --> 00:33:31.740
type of shit.

584
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:35.530
<v 3>So like I said,
I'm not gonna really fucking Brag about that.
Um,
um,</v>

585
00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.580
I am happy that we won and all that type of shit.
Uh,

586
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:42.900
but I gotta be honest with you,
I have no idea who the best team is right now.

587
00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:48.240
Um,
I mean,
can,
somebody explained to me the San Diego charges,

588
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.830
but the fuck is that like,

589
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.420
<v 0>if you bet on football this year,
you're out of your mind at this point.</v>

590
00:33:53.421 --> 00:33:58.421
You should just cut your losses and go home 37 and nothing against the dolphins,

591
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:04.640
you know?
No,
no disrespect to the dolphins,
but the fucking dolphins,

592
00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:07.610
37 and nothing.
I missed the whole game,
so I should just shut up

593
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.450
<v 3>the hell up.
I was at that stupid,
not stupid if it,</v>

594
00:34:10.451 --> 00:34:12.040
and I was doing that event thing,
uh,

595
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:15.150
as a sports fan in me saying that it was stupid.
Um,

596
00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:19.450
<v 0>boy,
whatever.
So I haven't,
I have no idea.
I don't know.
I don't know who shot.</v>

597
00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.050
I don't know who's not.
I don't know who's good.
I really don't.
And I'm,

598
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.120
but the Patriots,
look how the Patriots look every year to me,
um,

599
00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:31.930
since we stopped Lu,
uh,
winning Superbowls.
So,

600
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.300
you know,
I think we're,
once again,

601
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:39.170
I love that that were somehow number one against the pass.

602
00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:42.970
<v 3>That's great.
But,
uh,
I dunno,</v>

603
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.020
it'd be nice if we could have been at least seventh against the run as opposed

604
00:34:47.021 --> 00:34:49.120
to like dead last.
I'm quoting somebody from last week.

605
00:34:49.121 --> 00:34:53.530
I might be wrong about that,
but,
uh,
you know,
so whatever.
I hope,
I hope I'm,

606
00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.760
yeah,
whatever.
I know we're going to make the play offs obviously,

607
00:34:58.761 --> 00:35:00.350
cause I division fucking stinks.

608
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:06.550
<v 0>And,
um,
I don't know what about that.
Jet's Jesus fucking Christ one an eight.</v>

609
00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:10.600
Thank God for that aid is,
are they,
they'd have the worst team in the league.

610
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.640
Unbelievable.
That's how you right now,

611
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:17.390
you know he's going to be a fucking bargain to pick up his rex Ryan when they

612
00:35:17.391 --> 00:35:21.080
fire that guy because that guy is a good coach.
I don't like that.
He talks shit,

613
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:24.410
disrespects other fucking teams and he does.

614
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.890
And it's comes from a place of insecurity,
I think.
And then he tried.
Yeah.

615
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.490
<v 2>No,
you can't get back to you.</v>

616
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.890
<v 0>Shut the fuck up.
You ran your mile 20.
You had a good team.
Now your team stinks.</v>

617
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:38.290
So now you're,
now you're not talking.
So maybe he is a good guy.

618
00:35:38.291 --> 00:35:39.310
Maybe did learn his lesson.

619
00:35:39.311 --> 00:35:41.830
I'm going to wait for rex Ryan to have another good team and if he doesn't talk

620
00:35:41.831 --> 00:35:45.370
shit,
then I'll be like,
all right.
He kind of learned a lesson then,

621
00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.460
but I think most of the reason why he's kept his mouth shut is because his team

622
00:35:48.461 --> 00:35:52.870
has stunk.
However,
um,
I will say this,
um,

623
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.090
<v 1>that</v>

624
00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:59.800
<v 0>that team is not his fault.
Uh,
they,
uh,
you got to get rid of that GM,</v>

625
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:01.163
<v 1>you know,</v>

626
00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.960
<v 0>coach is only as good as the is.</v>

627
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:06.980
I sound like one of those stupid analysts on fucking ESPN,
but it's true.
The Guy,

628
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.940
he doesn't have anybody and Gino Smith's,

629
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.920
from what I heard was the dead gms.
That was his big fucking pick.

630
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:18.360
You know,
what are you supposed to do?
So,
uh,
whatever.
So he's going to get blamed,

631
00:36:18.361 --> 00:36:19.260
he's going to get fired,

632
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:21.900
the jams going to get fired and then someone's going to pick up rex Ryan and I

633
00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:25.770
think,
you know,
if he gets,
if he gets with the right Gm,
I think,
you know,

634
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.410
that guy took the jets to like within two plays.

635
00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:29.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

636
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:34.200
<v 0>Uh,
or one drive I should say,
of getting to the Superbowl.
The fucking jets.</v>

637
00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:35.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

638
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.250
<v 0>That's an accomplishment in itself,
you know,
so</v>

639
00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.810
I dunno,
it's weird.
I used to.

640
00:36:41.811 --> 00:36:45.170
I remember for the longest time I used to wish I was switched to jets would lose

641
00:36:45.171 --> 00:36:47.870
and I fucking hated Rex Ryan cause he was talking all that shit and I wanted to

642
00:36:47.871 --> 00:36:51.320
see the guy flame out exactly what the fuck's happening and now it's happening.

643
00:36:51.321 --> 00:36:53.840
And I feel bad for the guy because I feel like a,

644
00:36:53.841 --> 00:36:55.250
what's going on is not his fault.

645
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:56.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

646
00:36:56.310 --> 00:37:00.180
<v 0>I wanted them to lose with the fucking players that he picked cause he talked</v>

647
00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:02.910
all that fucking shit.
You know,
we're going to win a suit,

648
00:37:02.911 --> 00:37:05.580
blow with the best fucking tee with it's fucking league.

649
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.760
All of that Shit just drove me up the Goddamn wall.
But now it's,

650
00:37:08.761 --> 00:37:10.650
now it's how I can't root for a guy to lose his job.

651
00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

652
00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:16.970
<v 0>Can I,
yeah.
Jesus.
I Dunno.
Um,
anyways,
what,
how,</v>

653
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:19.930
how,
how much,
how much time have I done here,
by the way,
Mike?
Well,

654
00:37:19.931 --> 00:37:23.650
we started over,
didn't we?
Or what this is,
this is the real time.
37 minutes.

655
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:28.070
All right.
I'm 37 minutes in.
Uh,

656
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.750
all right,
what the fuck else am I going to talk about?
Oh,
I did a,

657
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:38.600
I did a benefit benefit,
uh,
uh,
for pit bulls last night.

658
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.390
It's one of my favorite benefits of the year cause I absolutely fucking love

659
00:37:41.391 --> 00:37:43.290
dogs.
And I also showed up and

660
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:49.430
there's all these pitfalls there that need to be adopted and stuff and uh,
uh,

661
00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.940
the best,
the best fucking look like if you drew a dog's face,

662
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.720
that's what a pit bull fit.
You know what their face looks like.

663
00:37:56.721 --> 00:37:58.340
That is just a fucking dog.

664
00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:02.570
So I went over there and there's all these poor dogs that had their fucking ears

665
00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:05.260
clipped and shit and you know,

666
00:38:05.261 --> 00:38:07.710
they went through all of this God damn pain and they just sitting there,

667
00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:12.160
you know,
they're looking scary cause if fucking ears are all cut up and shit,

668
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.410
I was so,
I go over to pet this one.
Right?

669
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:15.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

670
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:19.050
<v 0>Great fucking dog.
It's one of those dogs.
We,
you start petting it.</v>

671
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.050
It like leads into you.
It puts all its weight on you.

672
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.280
And I wasn't prepared for that.

673
00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:27.420
And I squatted down like a catcher to pet this thing and it just fucking leaned

674
00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:31.770
into me and actually knocked me over like a fucking asshole.

675
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.380
But uh,
oh,
it was crazy.
They had puppies there.
You know,

676
00:38:36.381 --> 00:38:39.650
if my dog wasn't such a psycho and wouldn't try to fight another dog,

677
00:38:39.651 --> 00:38:41.570
if I brought it in,
I would own three of them.

678
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:45.910
<v 3>So I just got to ride it out with the crazy dog that I loved.</v>

679
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:50.240
Now give her the best life possible.
Um,
but when a,

680
00:38:50.241 --> 00:38:55.180
that chapter is over,
I'm going to get a,
I'm going to get a blue nose,
a red nose.

681
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:59.350
I'm going to get an all white one and I'm going to get a black one.

682
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.070
I'm going to have four of them.
And even then that won't be enough.

683
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.950
That's how much I fucking love that breed of dog.
So it was a,

684
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.820
it was a fucking great time going over there and doing the show.
I actually,

685
00:39:09.821 --> 00:39:13.420
I did two shows and the first show went great.
The second show,

686
00:39:13.421 --> 00:39:16.840
I don't know what happened.
I think I went out and I went out too hard.

687
00:39:16.841 --> 00:39:20.860
There was a comic in the room that I wanted to impress a comic that I like to

688
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.560
when I was starting out.
Now he's still like,
I'm obviously,
but uh,

689
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:25.960
I tried to fuck it.
That's,
I swear to God,

690
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.710
nothing will humble you like fucking standup comedy every time you think he got

691
00:39:29.711 --> 00:39:33.700
it down,
you know,
like,
ah,
I got this fucking figured out.

692
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:38.170
What ends up happening?
You go up there and yeah,
I didn't eat my balls,
but uh,

693
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:41.680
I definitely,
uh,
I,
my munched on them a little bit.
Yeah.

694
00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:43.883
<v 1>Okay.</v>

695
00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.730
<v 3>I swear to God,
I thought,
I said,</v>

696
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:50.150
I thought he said it the same funny way I went up there and I said,

697
00:39:50.151 --> 00:39:50.984
you know what?

698
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.320
<v 1>Okay,</v>

699
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.990
<v 3>I just hope that when it's all said and done,</v>

700
00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:59.070
all the money we raise here tonight,
some of it trickles actually trickles down.

701
00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:00.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

702
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.610
<v 3>To some,
to the dogs or something like that.
Cause you know,
all these,</v>

703
00:40:03.611 --> 00:40:07.460
half of these fucking,
these Goddamn uh,

704
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:13.840
charities are total scams just as far as like,

705
00:40:14.361 --> 00:40:16.550
uh,
you know,
the,

706
00:40:16.551 --> 00:40:21.170
the amount of money that goes towards whatever the hell they're trying to stop

707
00:40:21.171 --> 00:40:24.890
versus what they line their pockets with.
I mean it is a shame.
It's a scam.

708
00:40:24.891 --> 00:40:27.050
Somebody sent me something where,
you know,

709
00:40:27.051 --> 00:40:31.730
the amount of charities out there that they named their charity,

710
00:40:31.731 --> 00:40:35.780
that almost sounds like the legitimate charity,
you know,
like that,
um,

711
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:39.020
that coming to America and said,
and Mcdonald's,

712
00:40:39.021 --> 00:40:42.620
it's Mcdowell's they do that and these fucking pieces of shit.

713
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:47.380
We'll just put a picture of a starving kid or something like that.

714
00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:50.390
And then you feel bad.

715
00:40:50.391 --> 00:40:53.030
You dropped some change and there were a couple bucks and they just keep it and

716
00:40:53.031 --> 00:40:53.930
they go out and they get a house.

717
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:56.621
<v 0>All right.</v>

718
00:40:56.621 --> 00:41:01.621
We had another glitch with some of the why is here the fuck was I talking about?

719
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:06.550
It'll get better people,
it'll get better if you get down there,

720
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:11.120
get your all things comedy,
$5 fundraiser stickers.
Um,

721
00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:12.500
we even have a website.

722
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:13.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

723
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:14.920
<v 0>Mike,
do we even have a website?</v>

724
00:41:14.921 --> 00:41:17.290
Whether it was supposed to tell these people to get these fucking stickers there

725
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:20.400
<v 1>to start.com.</v>

726
00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:24.100
<v 0>Oh right there.
Go to [inaudible] dot com if you'd like,</v>

727
00:41:24.101 --> 00:41:27.640
they stop hearing delays in this podcast now,
whatever.
We'll figure it out.

728
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.900
Anyway.
So these cons,
they start a,
they start a,
um,

729
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.900
<v 3>what do you call a charity</v>

730
00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:37.170
<v 0>and they name it like another charity that's actually legitimate.</v>

731
00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:39.150
And then they put some,
you know,

732
00:41:39.151 --> 00:41:43.860
sad puppies face or a how to fuck knows what and then they make a bunch of
money.

733
00:41:43.861 --> 00:41:44.251
Next thing you know,

734
00:41:44.251 --> 00:41:47.220
they've got a big house sitting by a pool and they don't feel one ounce of guilt

735
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:48.371
there.
Absolutely.
You know,

736
00:41:48.371 --> 00:41:50.880
what would happened to these people if they actually did something like that.

737
00:41:50.881 --> 00:41:55.280
And then Singapore,
you know,
where it's illegal to spit gum

738
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:57.770
on the sidewalk.

739
00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:00.890
I can't imagine the caning that these people would get and they would fucking

740
00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:04.640
deserve it too,
is horrific as a caning video is.
Um,

741
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.070
I actually have a theory people,

742
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.560
oh Billy gossip has coming with the theory.
I've noticed this year,

743
00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.550
<v 3>you know,
a lot of stuff came out about a certain campaign that a,</v>

744
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.040
that was raising awareness that made everybody wear the,
uh,
well,

745
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:25.670
it's not quite a Magenta,
pink,
the pink campaign.

746
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:30.870
A lot of shit came out about that.
A lot of unsavory floating.

747
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:35.890
She had old woody about that campaign and about how much money was being raised

748
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:39.920
and how much was actually being appropriated toward actually finding a fucking

749
00:42:39.921 --> 00:42:44.921
cure for breast cancer and how much was going into a new tiling inside this

750
00:42:46.011 --> 00:42:48.350
person's fucking,
uh,
Olympic size pool.

751
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:54.100
And also a lot of shit came out about the NFL and that pink jerseys and by a lot

752
00:42:54.891 --> 00:42:58.880
of shit,
I mean,
the website I went to in the one article that I read,
um,

753
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.990
about,
uh,
I thought it was a legitimate website.
I mean,
it was on the Internet,

754
00:43:02.991 --> 00:43:05.180
right?
And they were saying that like,
you know,

755
00:43:05.181 --> 00:43:09.140
like 95% of the profits from those jerseys went into the NFL has pockets.

756
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:13.070
And I think that people were starting to blow whistles and,

757
00:43:13.071 --> 00:43:18.050
but the NFL makes so much fucking money for media giants,

758
00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:19.160
Espn,

759
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.760
fucking Fox and NBC that they all kind of squashed it.

760
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:26.300
And I think that the

761
00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:30.190
<v 0>pink lady and the NFL both made their money and this slowly</v>

762
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.410
<v 3>backing off each other and just going to pretend it never fucking happen because</v>

763
00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:36.720
this year they went from,
Oh my God,

764
00:43:36.721 --> 00:43:40.890
if I see another fucking pink thing again in my life,
um,

765
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:46.110
I'm going to kill myself.
Last year you couldn't escape it.
I mean,

766
00:43:46.111 --> 00:43:49.070
I remember when I was in New Orleans working and there was like a,

767
00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.130
<v 0>I went to this casino in the blackjack table.
That was two years ago.</v>

768
00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.360
The blackjack table was pink.
It was all fucking over the place.

769
00:43:57.361 --> 00:44:00.270
And now I notice this year straight across the board,

770
00:44:00.271 --> 00:44:04.730
the NFL and everywhere else,
way,
way,
way the fuck

771
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.110
<v 3>toned down,
way the fuck tone down.</v>

772
00:44:08.111 --> 00:44:13.000
And I think they're all slowly walking away from a some unsavory shit.

773
00:44:13.001 --> 00:44:15.220
They just act like it never happened.
Hey,
you know,

774
00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.630
whatever we should like that crimes and misdemeanors was somebody got killed but

775
00:44:19.631 --> 00:44:22.360
nobody got caught.
And you just kind of get over it after a while.

776
00:44:22.361 --> 00:44:26.530
You just get on with your fucking life.
I think if I had to guess,
uh,

777
00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.510
but then I'm a negative.
I'm not a negative prick.

778
00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:32.310
I'm a cynical son of a bitch and uh,
I think that that's what happened

779
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:38.820
Sunday,
that Oprah will make a fucking movie about it.
Right.
The lifetime network.

780
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:42.750
Some will play the pink lady.
No,
Oprah wouldn't do that.
Right.
That's,

781
00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:46.770
that would make women look bad.
She,
she's not about that.
If there's a guy,

782
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:51.930
you know what you just say was based on real events and then somehow they would

783
00:44:51.931 --> 00:44:56.610
make the reason why the evil woman at the head of the pink campaign did.

784
00:44:56.611 --> 00:45:00.990
It was because some guy was verbally abusing her or hit on her when she walked

785
00:45:00.991 --> 00:45:05.991
down the street was a couple of none and not in another like non-stories in

786
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:08.280
standup comedy,

787
00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:12.710
<v 0>like the,
the fucking outrage.
You know,
back when I was a kid,</v>

788
00:45:12.711 --> 00:45:14.150
when people got outraged,

789
00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:17.360
what they did was when they wanted to find out if people were actually outraged,

790
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:19.970
they went out in the street and they talk to people.

791
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:24.020
Now it's like marketed outrage.
So I don't even buy into it.

792
00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:29.420
<v 3>You know what I mean?
Like A,
this comic,</v>

793
00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.840
<v 0>they did this whole fucking thing.
This woman made a video.</v>

794
00:45:32.841 --> 00:45:37.040
She walked around New York City for 10 fucking hours.
10 hours.

795
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:43.280
Yeah.
You fucking walk around in public for 10 hours is a good look.
A woman,

796
00:45:43.281 --> 00:45:47.230
somebody going to hit on you,
right.
I would,

797
00:45:47.231 --> 00:45:48.790
they should follow me for 10 hours.

798
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:52.060
It'd be the exact opposite instead of people hitting on me.
But yeah.

799
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:55.230
<v 2>Hey,
hey ma.</v>

800
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.720
<v 0>And then the end,
I get mugged.</v>

801
00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.200
<v 1>Okay,</v>

802
00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.690
<v 0>Jesus Christ,
bunch of fucking cry babies now.</v>

803
00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:08.080
You know what I love all the fucking clothes she was wearing were made in a

804
00:46:08.081 --> 00:46:11.200
sweatshop somewhere.
So as much as she's having a fucking problem,

805
00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:13.630
people calling out how nicer asses?

806
00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:17.500
There's some crying child that made those jeans that are so wonderfully cupping

807
00:46:17.501 --> 00:46:21.550
her booty cheeks,
you know?
And you know,
I think that's one to grow on.

808
00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:26.080
I don't care.
I think that's some of they just don't,
just a bunch of bullshit.

809
00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.960
If you buddy flipping out about,

810
00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:31.000
it's such a lazy God damn story and then you know where they always get started,

811
00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.280
some fat fucking bloggers site,

812
00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.200
some victim dose makes a fucking video and then they always end up on those

813
00:46:38.201 --> 00:46:39.430
cheese balls sites.

814
00:46:39.431 --> 00:46:43.720
Those list sites that steal six hours of your life.

815
00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.590
Top 10 turtles in the Indian Ocean.
All of a sudden,
oh Geez,

816
00:46:47.591 --> 00:46:50.380
I wonder what those look like.
You know,
how the fuck did you end up there?

817
00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:55.120
The top 20 worse plastic surgery nightmares,

818
00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:00.720
the top 100 a porn star blow jobs in the month of March.

819
00:47:01.391 --> 00:47:04.930
I made much as I'm making fun of them,
I obviously,
because I can make fun of him.

820
00:47:04.931 --> 00:47:07.930
I know what the fuck they are,
but um,
I don't,
I'm just

821
00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.110
<v 1>okay.</v>

822
00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:13.770
<v 0>I know it's,
it's,
I,
I don't think there is any outrage.
I don't,</v>

823
00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:15.320
I think they just,

824
00:47:15.321 --> 00:47:18.520
they just find like two or three fucking people and they just try to magnify it.

825
00:47:18.521 --> 00:47:22.470
Yeah.
Right.
Someone will get upset about anything like this.

826
00:47:22.471 --> 00:47:26.910
Fucking the chick up there in Oregon who had an inoperable brain cancer and

827
00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:30.190
decided that she,
rather than go through it,
just wanted to die.

828
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.960
It was actually reading this story.

829
00:47:31.961 --> 00:47:36.730
She went to Oregon because if you want to die up there,
they let you do it.

830
00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:41.800
Um,
you know,
and the hospitals are like,
wait a minute,

831
00:47:41.801 --> 00:47:46.570
how dare you decide to die?
And we don't make any money off of it.

832
00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:49.630
That God dammit,
this goes against the Lord.

833
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:54.340
You need to come into our hospitals and lay there and we'll medicate you and

834
00:47:54.341 --> 00:47:57.580
we'll just drag this fucking thing out and uh,

835
00:47:57.581 --> 00:48:00.340
then stick your alive relatives with a six figure bill.

836
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.260
How dare you go around all of that.

837
00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:05.320
Did she basically medically speaking was off the grid.

838
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:09.280
So she decided to go up there.
It's actually fucking creeping me out.
You know,

839
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:12.620
she went up there and she picked out the house that she wanted to die in,

840
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.930
which you picked out like a little yellow house and uh,

841
00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:20.500
and then just basically took drugs like I'm dying now.

842
00:48:20.501 --> 00:48:22.510
Do you realize the fucking nerve that that takes?

843
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:27.310
I couldn't do that as much as like a,
I could,

844
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:32.730
if you were getting put cement shoes on me and you gave me a cyanide pill,

845
00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:37.720
which is probably a horrific death too.
But uh,
it's nice and quick.
Yeah,

846
00:48:37.721 --> 00:48:40.990
I'd do it.
I'd still have to psych myself up.
You know?

847
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.990
I'm trying to think what prayer I could say to a higher power just in case it

848
00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:48.190
actually exists that would exonerate me from all the fucking horrific shit that

849
00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:50.650
I've done in my life.
Um,

850
00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:56.150
I don't know if I could do that.
What would you rather do?

851
00:48:56.151 --> 00:48:58.400
Would you rather just go to Oregon and Dinah Yellow House,

852
00:48:58.401 --> 00:49:01.160
hanging out with your friends?
Just watch a football game and be like,

853
00:49:01.161 --> 00:49:05.360
all right everybody,
let's man,
I had a great time.
Like you going home.

854
00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:09.230
See you later,
man.
I just fucking pop a pill.

855
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:14.570
I Dunno.
I Dunno if guys,
I got nothing.

856
00:49:14.571 --> 00:49:17.000
I don't know what the fuck happened this week.
Oh,
I,
here's one for you.

857
00:49:17.001 --> 00:49:21.890
Kansas city,
Kansas city royals lost the world series.
Man that killed me.

858
00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:26.540
I wish they sent that guy home.
You know,

859
00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:29.630
even if he got thrown out at the plate just to have a fucking,

860
00:49:29.631 --> 00:49:34.190
somebody tried to get an inside the park home run in the ninth inning down by

861
00:49:34.191 --> 00:49:38.330
one bottom on the ninth at home.
Jesus Christ.

862
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.330
I was watching that and the bar and um,

863
00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.370
the second it went by that guy,
I'm thinking all right,
that's a double.

864
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:49.400
Then it went down there and he bounced off the wall and that guy kicked it or

865
00:49:49.401 --> 00:49:51.680
something.
I'm like,
that's definitely a trip.
But you know what kills me.

866
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.010
If that was Willie Wilson running the base path,

867
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:58.790
he definitely would have made it.
Ah,
that fucker would have made it.

868
00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:01.040
He would've made it.
And then you know what you would have had,

869
00:50:01.041 --> 00:50:03.650
you had one of the,
where you would have had one of the great plays in baseball.

870
00:50:03.651 --> 00:50:06.800
However,
if anybody's going to sit around and give that guy shit is like,

871
00:50:06.801 --> 00:50:06.981
you know,

872
00:50:06.981 --> 00:50:11.750
he should've gone and let's say the same reason why he didn't go is why that guy

873
00:50:11.751 --> 00:50:13.880
in center field miss the fucking ball.

874
00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.430
Cause it was the ninth inning of the world series.
You know what I mean?

875
00:50:16.431 --> 00:50:18.860
There's so much on the line.
That was the regular season.

876
00:50:18.861 --> 00:50:22.190
That guy just would have let the blooper dropping.
But he ran in thinking,

877
00:50:22.191 --> 00:50:23.870
I got to make a play.
You've got to make a play.

878
00:50:23.871 --> 00:50:26.420
And then the second they hit the ground,
he looked like me out in the field.

879
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:30.290
You know,
I actually make fun of myself a lot athletically,

880
00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:33.440
like I stink and that nothing could be further from the truth.

881
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.221
A lot of people don't know.

882
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:38.150
I was actually drafted by the Texas longhorns to play baseball,
but,
uh,

883
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:41.960
I just decided,
you know,
I mean,
I just,

884
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:44.570
Roger Clemens was still there at the time and I was just,
you know,

885
00:50:44.571 --> 00:50:47.330
I was just like,
you know,
it's his time.
It's his time.
I,
I don't,

886
00:50:47.331 --> 00:50:51.470
I don't want to do that to people.
Right.
Does anybody wants you to hockey at all?

887
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.020
I've been so busy fucking looking at all this other shit.

888
00:50:54.021 --> 00:50:56.780
I haven't had no time to look at whatsoever.
Although I do know

889
00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:58.333
<v 4>that,
uh,</v>

890
00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:02.190
<v 0>at the fucking Bruins beat the Senate is the other night,
didn't they?</v>

891
00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:05.490
Three to two and they shifted up the lines.
Bergey's lying there.

892
00:51:05.491 --> 00:51:08.310
They got my shine and the other fucking line or something,

893
00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:12.060
be people I basically out of shit to talk about maybe for the first time ever.

894
00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:13.980
So I'm just going to sit here and uh,

895
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.660
just can you guys just ride with me for the next couple of weeks while I,
well,

896
00:51:17.661 --> 00:51:18.090
I'm going to,

897
00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:20.760
we're going to write and record these next couple episodes and then I'm going to

898
00:51:20.761 --> 00:51:23.160
be done with the F is for family shit.
Then we're going to animate it.

899
00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:26.040
Then I'll actually have some free fucking time and I can actually live a little

900
00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:28.740
bit of life and maybe actually have something to talk about.

901
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:33.420
Oh my God damn podcasts.
Mike,
what am I up to here?
Like 50 minutes,
51 minutes.

902
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:37.170
I got to somehow figure it out another nine minutes to shit that I have to talk

903
00:51:37.171 --> 00:51:38.970
about me.
You know what?
You're not going to help me.

904
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:41.820
He just going to sit over there.
Go.
Oh,
we got another glitch.

905
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:47.310
Got another glitch in the fucking main board here.
Mike,

906
00:51:47.311 --> 00:51:50.800
has that ever happened?
Any podcast in here?
It is right now.

907
00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.250
What does with Megan technology?
It's just,

908
00:51:53.251 --> 00:51:54.810
it just doesn't fucking work out for me.

909
00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.980
<v 4>I know.
All right.
Whatever</v>

910
00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:03.740
<v 0>corpse found in a Costa Rican Concordia and wreck a soon to be Russell Rebello.</v>

911
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:08.680
No Way.
Not fucking Russell.
Rebello Oh,
Jesus Christ.

912
00:52:08.681 --> 00:52:12.130
This is my fucking phone.
Who is it?

913
00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:13.773
<v 4>Great</v>

914
00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:19.000
<v 0>bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bum.
All right,
shit.</v>

915
00:52:19.001 --> 00:52:21.220
I gotta take this guy.
Sorry.
Hello?

916
00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:24.300
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

917
00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.910
<v 0>Hey,
I'm finishing up my podcast going to call you back in two seconds.</v>

918
00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:28.893
<v 4>Okay,
cool.
Bye.</v>

919
00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.790
<v 0>This is how bad I am with with technology.
The reason why,</v>

920
00:52:32.791 --> 00:52:37.260
whenever my management calls I always pick up is because I know they probably

921
00:52:37.261 --> 00:52:42.261
sent me an email that I didn't see and I'm supposed to be somewhere that I'm

922
00:52:42.301 --> 00:52:45.360
not.
I really fucking hate the fact that people can get away with now.

923
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.630
You know like,
dude,
why didn't you tell me I sent you an email?

924
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:54.210
Why don't you just send a fucking carrier pigeon that doesn't fly back to you

925
00:52:54.211 --> 00:52:56.820
and like you should send a parent is what you should do.

926
00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:59.740
Send me the message and then the parent comes back like,
wow,

927
00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:03.720
I was able to give it to him and he read it.
Right?
You just send a fucking email.

928
00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:05.040
Did I just imitate a parrot?

929
00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:09.480
Is that how much I'm fucking struggling to fill time?
Yeah.

930
00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:12.690
I don't fucking like when people do that shit,
they think I sent you an email.

931
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:15.420
It was all in the email.
It's like,
dude,

932
00:53:15.421 --> 00:53:19.200
I get a thousand fucking Ebo much porno I've watched on,
on,
uh,

933
00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:24.570
on my computer.
Jesus Christ.
You want me fucking emails?
I get a day.

934
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:25.570
I've Shit.

935
00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:27.330
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

936
00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:31.170
<v 0>On all of these fucking websites,
I can't even find emails anymore.</v>

937
00:53:31.171 --> 00:53:33.270
I get so much stuff.
And then people go,
oh,
why didn't you,

938
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:38.430
why don't you just start a second account?
And yet on that one,
you know,

939
00:53:38.431 --> 00:53:41.100
it's only for friends and family and all of that fucking shift because

940
00:53:41.101 --> 00:53:45.240
eventually I'm going to have an open and I'm going to look at somebody,
uh,

941
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.720
you know,
fucking blow in somebody and then the next scene,
are they good?

942
00:53:48.721 --> 00:53:51.600
They somehow they just get it.
There's no more privacy or whatever.

943
00:53:51.601 --> 00:53:54.540
So that's the reason why I took the phone call.
I apologize.

944
00:53:54.541 --> 00:53:56.670
That was unbelievably,
unbelievably.

945
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.930
It's probably typically I'm professional of me.
Um,

946
00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.730
yeah.
So anyways.
All right,
what do I got going on coming up anyways?
I,

947
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.750
you know what,
I'm just going to hype the shit that I do have coming up.

948
00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.960
I got stand up special coming up,
uh,
December 5th.

949
00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.960
I know I bored you to death with this,
but I'd love if you watched it.

950
00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:17.050
It's on Netflix and I've been getting shit about this,

951
00:54:17.051 --> 00:54:19.870
that it's only on Netflix and that you're not gonna be able to buy it anywhere

952
00:54:19.871 --> 00:54:20.740
for like a year.

953
00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:26.050
And all I have to say is you only have yourselves to blame for that.
All right?

954
00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:29.560
If you cut fucking cunts would actually pay for the goddamn thing.

955
00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.100
I could put up my own money for it,
you know,

956
00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:37.630
but I can't put up my own money for it because only like maybe,
I don't know,

957
00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:43.020
5,000 you will actually purchase the thing and that'll get me 25 grand back of

958
00:54:43.301 --> 00:54:47.200
about 180 grants.
So would you do a deal like that?
You wouldn't.
So what happened?

959
00:54:47.201 --> 00:54:50.200
Netflix put up the money.
So that's how it works.

960
00:54:50.201 --> 00:54:53.440
And then part of my agreement is that they own it exclusive for a year.

961
00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:57.260
That's how it works.
But here's the thing,
you know some assholes,
some gonna,

962
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:59.740
whatever you fucking tech Geeks,
call it,

963
00:54:59.741 --> 00:55:02.380
rip it and wrap it and fucking upload it.

964
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:07.660
And it's going to be on Youtube anyways,
so you'll just see it that way.
Okay,

965
00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:12.010
so quit breaking my fucking balls about it.
He's fucking nards man.

966
00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:13.640
You out there.

967
00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:16.800
You know how come they just keep making movies about fucking superheroes in,

968
00:55:16.801 --> 00:55:21.801
in a transformers and shit and apes taken over the planet because you stole all

969
00:55:21.821 --> 00:55:23.050
the other ones.
Just stole it.

970
00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.050
You stole all the fucking where you get what you pay for,

971
00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:28.900
you stop paying for movies.
So now they're like,
fuck it.

972
00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.180
We're gonna make these movies that even if you steal them,

973
00:55:31.181 --> 00:55:33.610
it's going to suck to watch at home.
They're either gonna make,

974
00:55:33.611 --> 00:55:37.390
those are going to make little cheapy little cheapie ones where you got s,

975
00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:37.931
you know,

976
00:55:37.931 --> 00:55:40.860
you've got to share a sleeping bag with the five other actors and the directors

977
00:55:40.861 --> 00:55:43.400
every day on a shoot.
Those are the only fucking movies they make any boy,

978
00:55:43.401 --> 00:55:45.640
and you know what you fucking cut.
It's got no one to blame but yourself.

979
00:55:45.641 --> 00:55:49.780
So I don't want to hear it.
So my special comes out December 5th on Netflix.

980
00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.830
All right.
I should have called it.
Uh,
you get,
you get what you pay for.
Oh,

981
00:55:53.831 --> 00:55:57.100
is that what you should've called it bill?
Ooh.
Then what's going to happen?

982
00:55:57.101 --> 00:56:00.800
Highs is some group going to get upset.
Who's the latest guy to get?

983
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:04.210
Chris rock got in trouble.
Chris rock got in trouble.
He got outraged.

984
00:56:05.170 --> 00:56:08.680
He got some outreach.
He told some jokes and people were outraged.

985
00:56:08.681 --> 00:56:10.300
Some people or some groups.
How long?

986
00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.840
You know what's funny about what he did was there's no real group,

987
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:17.230
I guess Boston strong.
They could get outraged.

988
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:21.070
They could pretend to be outraged so they could sell more tee shirts.

989
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:22.930
So then they can align their fucking,

990
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:25.160
<v 3>and then,
uh,
you know,</v>

991
00:56:25.161 --> 00:56:29.600
maybe a couple of it trickles down to the actual victims of the bombing.

992
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:31.400
I swear to God,
like I would like to start at,

993
00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:36.520
you know what the charity you should do is you just walk up to the person who

994
00:56:36.621 --> 00:56:37.570
got injured in the,
in the

995
00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:42.210
<v 0>bombing and you just hand them a bag of cash that insurance companies can't see.</v>

996
00:56:42.211 --> 00:56:44.790
So they don't say that this,
well,
you're now making this much money.

997
00:56:44.791 --> 00:56:46.560
So this somehow cancels your policy.

998
00:56:46.830 --> 00:56:50.040
We've got to somehow come up with something where you just get the money

999
00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:54.990
directly to the wounded warrior,
directly to the victim of the,

1000
00:56:54.991 --> 00:56:58.380
uh,
of the marathon bombings,
you know,

1001
00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:03.980
as opposed to these Mary Kay cosmetic fucking cunts who is standing in between

1002
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:08.860
the,
the money in the victim,
like a fucking this sit there like,
oh,

1003
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:11.700
a screen.
I live way up my arms out right now acting the south,

1004
00:57:11.701 --> 00:57:15.900
just catching as much of the cash as they possibly can.
It's like a filter.

1005
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:20.820
I don't know.
I'm not saying they're all bad,

1006
00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.970
but generally speaking,
you know what I mean?

1007
00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:27.840
<v 3>People are fucking people and I,
yeah,
you know,
I don't trust them.</v>

1008
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:33.460
I don't fucking trust them.
Is this bad?
Am I,
you know what's funny is,
uh,

1009
00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:34.830
at some point I,

1010
00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:39.220
I'm hoping to get to the level in this business that actually somebody will take

1011
00:57:39.221 --> 00:57:41.230
the time to get offended by something that I say.

1012
00:57:41.231 --> 00:57:44.230
Although the second show last night,
you know,

1013
00:57:44.231 --> 00:57:45.700
it was David spade was in the crowd.

1014
00:57:45.701 --> 00:57:47.770
I don't want to drop the name and I'm a fucking huge fan of his.

1015
00:57:47.771 --> 00:57:50.650
So I wanted to impress him and then I went up there and I fucking ate my balls.

1016
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:53.860
I didn't eat my balls.
I,
he's fucking kills you,
you know?

1017
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:57.020
And that was like the last set of the night.
It was my last sets in La.

1018
00:57:57.021 --> 00:58:00.310
It's just lingering there.
So fortunately tonight I'm actually at flappers.

1019
00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:02.740
I swear to God,
that's the name of a comedy club.

1020
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:08.380
I don't know why they always have to give him zany names like Xannies,
right.

1021
00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:12.400
Wackos,
bananas,
Fuck,
Fuck,
whatever the hell they call them.

1022
00:58:12.401 --> 00:58:17.140
This one's called flappers and evidently it's because back in the day,
I dunno,

1023
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:18.003
there was people that,

1024
00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:22.240
people who danced you don't like during the Vaudevillian days,
hey,

1025
00:58:22.241 --> 00:58:25.150
let's get some flappers out there.
You know why we get the,
you know,

1026
00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:27.580
why the comics,
I don't know.

1027
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:30.460
Getting his puppet whenever the fuck they were doing.
Right.

1028
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:34.060
So what I was so they named Miss Comedy called flappers and then all of

1029
00:58:34.061 --> 00:58:36.580
waitresses and shit got addressed.
Like it's the 1920s.

1030
00:58:36.581 --> 00:58:38.680
And then the guy who runs the room,
he's got a fucking dress,

1031
00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:41.740
like he's got a fucking Tommy Gun and a violin case.

1032
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:44.230
I don't know why they do it.

1033
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:48.070
I don't know why they don't sit down with other comedians that have a meeting

1034
00:58:48.071 --> 00:58:51.730
and just say,
Hey,
do you think this is a good idea?
Oh,
speaking of which,

1035
00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:55.960
you guys got to listen to the Versie effect this week.
Another all things comedy.

1036
00:58:55.961 --> 00:59:00.820
A member Paul Versey,
um,
somebody threw a fucking beer bottle at him.

1037
00:59:00.821 --> 00:59:04.870
Thank God they missed,
they threw a fucking beer bottle at him.

1038
00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:10.330
And first he did said he did some Matrix Shit and uh,
the guy missed him.

1039
00:59:10.331 --> 00:59:14.960
But like this is just classic comedy clubs,
security.
Like,
dude,

1040
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:18.130
I don't know if you guys realize,
but,
but throwing a beer bottle,

1041
00:59:18.131 --> 00:59:20.920
it's somebody who's fucking head is assault with a deadly weapon.

1042
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:25.330
Like you literally can lose your I cave in your skull.

1043
00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:28.750
I had a buddy of mine in high school,
somebody smashed a bottle in his face.

1044
00:59:28.751 --> 00:59:30.820
He's scarred for life.
I haven't seen him in years,

1045
00:59:30.821 --> 00:59:33.340
but I mean he had this big scar going from his forehead right down the side of

1046
00:59:33.341 --> 00:59:36.670
his face.
Totally affected them socially.
Like in when you talk to him,

1047
00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:38.440
he would shoot his face to the side.

1048
00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:41.680
He was this outgoing guy became all fucking self conscious and all that shit.

1049
00:59:41.681 --> 00:59:43.570
Right.
And um,

1050
00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:46.230
<v 0>this guy does this shit.</v>

1051
00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.100
Classic Comedy Club Security.

1052
00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:54.660
Do you know they didn't get the guy's name and he just fucking left.

1053
00:59:56.070 --> 00:59:57.930
They're like,
oh,
he just ran out of here.

1054
00:59:57.990 --> 01:00:00.600
So what do you mean he just fucking ran out?
How does he just run out?

1055
01:00:00.601 --> 01:00:05.360
And he threw a fucking beer bottle at somebody's hi,
just pharaoh.

1056
01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:10.770
He kind of slipped through our fingers.
He
fucking ran out the door.

1057
01:00:10.771 --> 01:00:13.860
Like Charlie Chaplin.
I'm not saying you got to go fight the guy,

1058
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:17.820
but with all the cell phone camera video that you can get now,

1059
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.020
you couldn't video tape his fucking car.
That video tape.
What?
I'm so old,

1060
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.430
whatever.
He couldn't get a VHS tape of him.
Him drive it out of the parking lot.

1061
01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:31.440
Just something,
a picture of his car,
anything.
That guy should be in fucking jail.

1062
01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.911
<v 3>Oh,
sorry.</v>

1063
01:00:33.911 --> 01:00:36.700
It's a good friend of mine sent me to a fucking beer bottle on it anyway,

1064
01:00:36.701 --> 01:00:40.400
so if you want to listen to the full story of it,
uh,
listen to the verse,

1065
01:00:40.401 --> 01:00:43.870
the effect this week.
And um,
that's it.

1066
01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:47.550
Mercifully I'm up here at an hour.
I apologize guys.
I had,
uh,
you know,

1067
01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.780
I didn't get it done this week.
You know,

1068
01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:52.440
I think I started off strong with a test pilot.
Shit.
Yeah.

1069
01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:55.460
<v 0>Hi Andy.
I ended up kind of weekly or maybe I did.</v>

1070
01:00:56.060 --> 01:01:00.440
Maybe you guys are actually enjoying it and I just can't hear the laughter.
Um,

1071
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:04.430
this weekend if you are in Bob Boston,
Massachusetts,

1072
01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:07.170
I am doing a the 20th anniversary.
Three,

1073
01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:08.441
<v 3>believe it or not,</v>

1074
01:01:08.441 --> 01:01:10.750
I can't believe it cause I think I was on the second or the third one,

1075
01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:11.951
so fucking old.

1076
01:01:11.951 --> 01:01:16.951
I am the 20th anniversary of a great charity where the money actually goes to

1077
01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:20.740
the people that need it.
Uh,
the Cam Neely,
uh,

1078
01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.300
the Cam Nealy House comics come home,
the 20th anniversary,
uh,

1079
01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:27.940
Dennis leary is kind of hosted,
has always,

1080
01:01:27.941 --> 01:01:32.620
he put together this charity with Cam Neely 20 years ago.
You know,

1081
01:01:32.621 --> 01:01:35.920
from day one it was a big deal.
I remember the doe the year that we did it,

1082
01:01:35.921 --> 01:01:40.921
they actually filmed it for a comedy central and now somehow it is in its 20th

1083
01:01:41.891 --> 01:01:44.260
year.
I remember a few years ago was in the 15th year.
I was like,

1084
01:01:44.261 --> 01:01:48.220
how the fuck is it 15 years ago,
you know,
it feels like two years ago,

1085
01:01:48.221 --> 01:01:52.750
five years ago goes by like two years now at my age.
So it's kind of terrifying.

1086
01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:57.520
But anyways,
it's going to be a murderer's row of comedians.
And,
uh,

1087
01:01:57.521 --> 01:01:59.950
as far as I know,
I think they're putting me on last,

1088
01:01:59.951 --> 01:02:02.290
as I mentioned last week and that,
and that's what you do on that show.

1089
01:02:02.291 --> 01:02:06.640
You do not headline you go on last.
So I got to make sure,
uh,
my,

1090
01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:11.740
my game is,
uh,
up to snuff.
So,
uh,
I don't get fucking,

1091
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:14.790
I don't get a bunch of shit.
You know,
it's funny,

1092
01:02:14.791 --> 01:02:16.510
it was up the wedding I went to this week,
uh,

1093
01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.030
I hung out with a buddy of mine that was from Boston and

1094
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:25.550
<v 0>I haven't been around that vibe
that like that much,
that consistently,</v>

1095
01:02:25.551 --> 01:02:29.870
it's just the level of defensiveness.
So have we started talking about sneakers

1096
01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:32.050
<v 4>and uh,</v>

1097
01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.230
<v 0>we were saying how,
you know,
Oh,
you know,</v>

1098
01:02:35.231 --> 01:02:39.490
people will stand in line for sneakers and people get beat up and shot over

1099
01:02:39.491 --> 01:02:42.760
sneakers and sometimes he's the sneaker heads say by these fucking sneakers.

1100
01:02:42.761 --> 01:02:44.500
And then they put them in the back of their closet,

1101
01:02:44.501 --> 01:02:47.500
just they can break them out five years later.
So people are like,
Oh fuck,

1102
01:02:47.501 --> 01:02:52.210
where did you get those?
And this dude totally fucking Boston.
It's just like,

1103
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:57.880
it's just like,
yeah,
I don't,
I don't get that,
you know,
like my whole life,

1104
01:02:57.881 --> 01:03:01.690
like I never been in this shit,
you know,

1105
01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.200
like I'm not,
I'm not into shit

1106
01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:10.760
like really choppy talking.
Like we just having this conversation,

1107
01:03:10.761 --> 01:03:12.970
you just kind of jumps in like that.
It would just looking at him like,

1108
01:03:12.971 --> 01:03:17.460
what do you mean you're not into anything?
You like to fish?
He's like,
yeah dude,

1109
01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:21.760
but I wouldn't like buy a fucking Paul and then stick it in my closet and pull

1110
01:03:21.761 --> 01:03:26.170
it out five years.
Oh look at this shit.
Like every fucking thing was like that.

1111
01:03:26.171 --> 01:03:31.120
He went up to go a do a drink run and he comes back,
he's like,
yeah dude,

1112
01:03:31.121 --> 01:03:35.110
what the fuck's with that bartender?
You know,
I go update or what are you Barb?

1113
01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.900
And the guy's like,
do you want it neat?
Do you want it on the rocks?
It's like,

1114
01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:40.330
dude,
I don't want the fuck that means just put it in a glass.

1115
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.620
You know what the fuck.
So anyways,

1116
01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:49.450
I want to be performing for people like that next weekend to raise money for
raw.

1117
01:03:49.451 --> 01:03:53.620
The Cam Nealy House.
Um,
all right,
that's it.
I'm sorry.
We ended up with a whimper.

1118
01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.250
He came in like a dope shit.
Ended out like a con.
All right,

1119
01:03:57.251 --> 01:03:59.340
that's a podcast for this week.
Uh,

1120
01:03:59.341 --> 01:04:02.530
I'm getting new and comfortable to the all things comedy podcast here.

And once again,

1123
01:04:10.961 --> 01:04:12.430

1124
01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:16.690
go to [inaudible] dot com and buy a couple of stickers.

1125
01:04:16.691 --> 01:04:19.130
You can do it if you want.
If you don't,
who gives a fuck?

1126
01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:22.570
Fuck it didn't talk about Halloween.
I got to talk about Halloween real quick.

1127
01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:24.970
This is like a comic that will not get off stage.

1128
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.130
He's just trying to get the last big laugh.
Mike's over in the corner,

1129
01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:31.180
like for fuck sakes.
I've got a life to get on with it.
We finally figured out,

1130
01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.820
we finally figured out Halloween.
This is the way you do it.

1131
01:04:33.821 --> 01:04:38.740
Because last year we did not give out candy because my lovely wife was so

1132
01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:40.720
fucking sick of all the high school kids,

1133
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.510
and they're precocious cunt kids in the fucking,
uh,

1134
01:04:43.511 --> 01:04:47.170
adults that show up and they want candy and they say,
fucked up shit.

1135
01:04:47.171 --> 01:04:49.930
This is how you do Halloween.
All right?

1136
01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.190
The first hour is the best.
It's all little kids,

1137
01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:57.860
little cutie pie kids with parents who are excited and a stick.

1138
01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.070
Kids like first or second Halloween,
the first one,

1139
01:05:00.071 --> 01:05:03.850
the first kid that showed up to the door,
he was dressed like a little fireman,

1140
01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:08.680
right?
And I'm like,
Oh,
look at you,
a little firemen are you doing?
And I,
you know,

1141
01:05:08.681 --> 01:05:10.350
I crouched down and,
uh,

1142
01:05:10.351 --> 01:05:14.800
I hold the bowl out to give him the candy and this adorable little kid reaches

1143
01:05:14.801 --> 01:05:15.490
in,

1144
01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:20.490
grabs one of the candy and then goes to hand it to me how I am like,

1145
01:05:20.511 --> 01:05:24.740
no,
no,
you get to keep it.
You get to keep it fucking adorable is right.
Uh,

1146
01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:28.410
and then he turns around,
he goes to walk away,
the back of his jackets is ranked.

1147
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:32.770
There's a little rain coats,
said a fire chief.
It was adorable.
Has helped.

1148
01:05:32.771 --> 01:05:34.550
But then he stopped was hilarious.

1149
01:05:34.551 --> 01:05:36.720
He stopped and he walked back and he reached any,

1150
01:05:36.721 --> 01:05:39.740
he grabbed another piece of candy and putting in like he'd got it,
you know,

1151
01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.180
and then I was thinking,
well that's cute.

1152
01:05:41.181 --> 01:05:45.200
Slashes on his way to be in like these country kids that are going to be coming

1153
01:05:45.201 --> 01:05:46.034
here in an hour.

1154
01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:50.120
So there's an hour of these cute kids and then the next hour you get these

1155
01:05:50.121 --> 01:05:51.450
precocious kids,
right.

1156
01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:55.790
Who think everything they say is so fucking brilliant and the adults are stupid.

1157
01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:01.160
Right.
And these kids come up and as I'm going to give him first kid,
you know,

1158
01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.620
there's this group of kids and one of them comes up to the door and I'm just

1159
01:06:03.621 --> 01:06:07.380
like,
he looked like he was with the grim reaper.
Now my God grim reaper.

1160
01:06:07.381 --> 01:06:09.720
And he's like,
Oh,
I'm not the grim reaper.

1161
01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:14.010
I'm so Ansel from like either Harry Potter or fucking Lord of the rings.

1162
01:06:14.011 --> 01:06:16.650
I don't know what he was supposed to door.
It's just like,
dude,
fuck you.

1163
01:06:16.651 --> 01:06:17.820
You look like the grim reaper,

1164
01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.450
how many houses you're going to go to when they gets grim reaper before you

1165
01:06:21.451 --> 01:06:25.440
blame yourself that you made a bad costume,
you little Douche,
right?

1166
01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:28.560
So I'm like,
I'm sorry man.
I didn't see the movie.
And he goes,

1167
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:33.120
who could you at least read the book?
I wanted to fucking boot of rightness.

1168
01:06:33.121 --> 01:06:36.540
Seventh grade ass or,
and then another group of kids,

1169
01:06:36.541 --> 01:06:39.690
they come there and we all fucking give him candy and then they start singing.

1170
01:06:39.691 --> 01:06:43.380
We,
she went merry Christmas.
We,
they start Carolyn on my front porch.

1171
01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:47.850
Like this is blowing my mind.
Like I'm going to be like,
wait a minute,

1172
01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.670
what holiday is it?
That's what I can't stand.

1173
01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:53.820
It's the fact that they think that they're smarter than you.

1174
01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:55.290
This is why it's so great.
I never had kids.

1175
01:06:55.291 --> 01:06:57.180
I would've been such a bad parent because I just want to be like,

1176
01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.250
do you think you really fucking with me right now?
I had water damage on a house.

1177
01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:04.440
I have a fucking mortgage.
I have a Goddamn wife.

1178
01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:09.400
Do you think right now what you're doing is blowing my mind?
Hi you little fuck.

1179
01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:11.890
I just,
I don't know.
And then what we did.

1180
01:07:11.891 --> 01:07:14.110
So then we wrote it out through those douchebags cause it's still,

1181
01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:15.100
there was some little kids,

1182
01:07:15.101 --> 01:07:20.101
cute kids coming up and then what you do is the first fucking kid who looks like

1183
01:07:22.031 --> 01:07:27.031
he's pushing a high school age and has that Shitty grin look on his face.

1184
01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.560
What I should've done was just slammed the door in his face,
said he was too big,

1185
01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:34.390
but I didn't cause I don't want anybody fucking with my house.

1186
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:36.640
What you do is you let him,
one guy get you,

1187
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:39.820
you give him the candy and the second he leaves,
that's it.

1188
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:43.810
You blow out the candle and the Pumpkin.
You shut off the porch light.

1189
01:07:43.811 --> 01:07:45.970
You just shut it down,
it's over.

1190
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:50.540
He shut out all the lights in your house and you go down into the bowels of your

1191
01:07:50.541 --> 01:07:54.640
house or into some closet and you just pour yourself a drink and you'll wait

1192
01:07:54.641 --> 01:07:58.530
there for 90 minutes and then it's over.
Do Halloween.
All right,
there you go.

1193
01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.750
Now that's a podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves.

1194
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:02.940
I will talk to you next week.
Thank you for listening.
