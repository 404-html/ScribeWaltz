00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.580
Hey,

It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

2
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:09.210
August 17th,
2015.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.230
Why did I just say 17th?
Like,
like something major happened,

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.030
you know,
on this day and this day till I read years ago,

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.760
Christopher Columbus had jockish itch,
which was fatal back in the 70.

6
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.350
[inaudible] how the fuck would he still be alive,
Bill?

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.490
He probably died of scurvy in the c 1492 we came over here and hacked off the,

8
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.670
the fucking native Americans hands,
you know,

9
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.930
probably an unprotected sex.

10
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.420
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.100
<v 0>Introduce some sort of,
I dunno,</v>

12
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.480
I dunno what geneticists genetic genitalia.
Scabies said.

13
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.810
I say it,
I dunno people.

14
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.020
This has gotta be a record.

15
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.640
How quickly did this 53 seconds in and it just went right off the fucking rails.

16
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.230
There's podcast is

17
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.680
fucking over Jesus Christ anywhere else.
So August 17th,

18
00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:09.430
just the way I said that 17th and I got all panicky.
Like why did I say it?

19
00:01:09.431 --> 00:01:14.140
Like something important happened and then that fucking debacle happen.
Anyways,

20
00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:17.380
what's going on?
How,
why?
Um,

21
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.190
it's the 17th day of August in the year of our Lord 2015 this is the year of the

22
00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:28.600
a Cockatoo,
I believe in the Chinese calendar.

23
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.890
They have cockatoos over there.
I don't know.
I,

24
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.960
I been to Hong Kong.
I didn't see any,
I was only there for a day.

25
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.520
Um,
anyways,
so,
oh,
Billy fat,
tits,

26
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.530
the fucking pasty adventure.
I've been a,

27
00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:50.740
I've been on a tear here and as I told you last week,
I fucked up my knee,

28
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.190
my knee.
I fucked the thing up.
A skipping rope.
True.
Ah,

29
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.850
right.
And I guess my fucking leg muscles got all tightened.

30
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.270
It started yanking my old ass knee,
you know,
in the wrong direction.

31
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.990
I started like,
you know,
just hobbling out to the car,
you know,

32
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.850
tippy toe and down the street.
Oh,
you know,
into the bathroom.

33
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.610
And he'd take that old man piss in the middle of the night.

34
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.020
Just wake up from a dream,
you know,
I mean,
what you drink?

35
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.870
What do you dream about?
At my age,
no,

36
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.470
going to a farmer's market and they still have tomatoes left.
Yeah.

37
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.140
That's a dream to me.
Wake up aroused when I have a trend.

38
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.870
It's a sad,
it's a sad fucking case.
But anyways,

39
00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:41.460
so I stretched out and did all that shit but still lie.

40
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.300
It kind of fucked up on my diet a couple of days.
Um,

41
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.350
my uh,
my wife,
you know,
was asking,
hey,
why don't we hang out and go do something?

42
00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:53.470
So we went to a museum and I fucking hate museums.

43
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.220
I absolutely fucking eighth.
I've told you about this before.

44
00:02:57.221 --> 00:03:00.970
I hate museums with a fucking passion eight.
How quiet it is in there.

45
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.770
I hate people standing reading that little card next to that fucking painting

46
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:08.980
that I swear to God.
It's like I did something like that when I was five.

47
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.370
She got,
you know,
can somebody just go back to painting the cow in a field?

48
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.310
You know what I mean?
Just everything.
Just have to be like,

49
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.880
just smearing of cover colors,
all,

50
00:03:20.881 --> 00:03:23.430
what the fuck these people are so dumb.

51
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.760
They sitting there staring at an acting like they see something.

52
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

53
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.870
<v 0>What are you looking at?
That's a light blue.</v>

54
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.750
That's a darker blue and there's an even darker blow.

55
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.000
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.550
<v 0>On that big square fucking canvas.
I get it.</v>

57
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:41.040
He took different shades of blue.

58
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.450
<v 2>Okay,</v>

59
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.201
<v 0>what does it say?</v>

60
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:46.260
So there's nothing that says the guy knows how to color in a fucking square.

61
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.400
I didn't want to do that.
And this guy,
long time ago,
he explained it to me.

62
00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:52.650
He goes,
well,
the differences,
cause I'd be like,

63
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.200
the little kid could fucking do that.
And he goes,

64
00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:57.630
the differences as a little kid can't drug,
uh,

65
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.630
<v 2>okay.</v>

66
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.690
<v 0>An amazing picture of like these people that make these abstract things,</v>

67
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:02.524
can't they?

68
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.890
They're choosing the choosing to create that way.

69
00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:10.630
It's like choosing to do what?
Fucking draw like a five year old.

70
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.630
So like I,
I know how to talk like an adult sort of,

71
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.420
if I go on stage and start telling jokes like a five year old,

72
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:23.190
all of a sudden I'm,
I'm,
I should be in a museum telling my jokes,
doc,

73
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.170
dark color.
You Suppose Shay,
who's there?
I'm fucking standing in the corner.

74
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.000
And all of a sudden I'm a,
I'm comedies.
Picasso.
I Dunno what happened.

75
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:36.700
We went there and she actually wanted to go see this short film.
Um,

76
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.680
that this guy made,
I know the Fucker,

77
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.190
I can't never remember anybody's fucking name,

78
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:45.930
but it was about La and growing up in La and,
uh,

79
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.320
down in Compton and everything like that.
And uh,

80
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.960
I love anything that is not a messy fucking painting.

81
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:55.770
And it's also like history of Los Angeles because there's so little history of

82
00:04:55.771 --> 00:04:58.920
it.
They just fucking,
like I said before in the park,

83
00:04:58.921 --> 00:05:01.830
they just pay right over this shit.
You know,

84
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.580
Robert Kennedy got assassinated down the fucking ambassador hotel.

85
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.250
That thing would have been a shrine in any other city.

86
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.960
This city fucking knocked it down,
put up a school on top of it,

87
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.150
you know what I mean?
Somewhere in the cafeteria,

88
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:17.760
there's like an x on the floor with a guy fucking bled out.
I mean,

89
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:20.550
it's unbelievable.
They just don't give a fuck.
Do you know they had one of the,

90
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.070
the,

91
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.390
one of the biggest acts of fucking terrorism as far as blowing up a building in

92
00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:28.290
a collapsing happened here in la before nine 11.

93
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:32.970
The biggest one was when somebody blew up the fucking,
uh,
the La Times building,

94
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.870
the original one.

95
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.890
And I've been all over the Internet and I've walked all over downtown La.

96
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:42.180
I can't find a fucking plaque or,
or information anyway,
they just flied fuck it.

97
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.370
They just plowed it over the couple of oxen and then that's it.

98
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.090
Now they just,
you know,
they got the fucking,
uh,

99
00:05:50.091 --> 00:05:52.800
the little white obelisk art deco,

100
00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:55.520
we thing look in there acting like that's the only place they ever wore like

101
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.040
that.
The fucking thing get,
didn't get up in the middle of the night.

102
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.033
<v 3>MMM.</v>

103
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.780
<v 0>So anyways,
that's what the fuck am I talking about?
That's the all the,</v>

104
00:06:03.781 --> 00:06:08.350
so when we went there,
this guy had all this,
uh,
this footage,
you know,

105
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.870
for basically like the Rodney King era right.
Up until then.

106
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.690
<v 3>Now,
um,</v>

107
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.470
<v 0>I love that shit.
Seen the old cars,
you know,
back to the early nineties,</v>

108
00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:20.890
and everybody wanted a fucking Nissan Maxima.
Like that was the God damn car.

109
00:06:20.891 --> 00:06:21.724
Right?

110
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.683
<v 3>MMM.</v>

111
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.620
<v 0>Just little details like that.
And then seeing,
you know,</v>

112
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.220
the beginnings of everybody,
fucking heaven,
an impala,
low rider.

113
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.190
And now that's almost like hackey at this point.
If you actually have an impala,

114
00:06:33.191 --> 00:06:37.240
low rider with the fucking wire rims,
it's just like everybody's seen that,

115
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.310
you know,
it's like owning a Mustang or a 69 fucking Camaro.

116
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.810
Everybody,
you've seen a million of them.
So,
um,
anyway,

117
00:06:46.811 --> 00:06:48.760
so we went down,
we watched that and then uh,

118
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.520
she took me to this place around the fucking corner,

119
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.040
which was a German place that sold all these different kinds of like brats and

120
00:06:57.041 --> 00:07:02.041
sausages and a fucking sick as French fries like you're like your mom made and

121
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.960
were those big thick fucking wedges and she just deep fry the shit out of him.

122
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.100
They had that,

123
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.340
I got some sort of rabbit and something else fucking brought sausage,

124
00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:18.100
whatever the fuck you call it,
and was absolutely delicious.

125
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.930
I had to fucking French fries.
It was like a junkie sitting in a crack house,
man.

126
00:07:22.931 --> 00:07:23.770
It was fucking brutal.

127
00:07:23.771 --> 00:07:26.580
And I looked over in the corner and there was two young guys right now,

128
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.980
like they're fucking mid twenties prime of their fucking life can eat McDonald's

129
00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:33.250
at two in the morning and wake up with a flat stomach.
They were over there.

130
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.990
These two young fucking conch was sitting over in the corner and they had those

131
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:42.991
giant German Oktoberfest beer steins and I just sat there staring at those mugs

132
00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:48.400
of beer.
They played look glanced over a couple of times.
I probably,

133
00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:50.560
what the fuck is this guy looking at it like I wanted to fight.

134
00:07:50.561 --> 00:07:53.130
It's like I'm not looking at you guys.
I'm looking,

135
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:58.150
I was like homer Simpson just sitting there doing the beer and um,

136
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.520
I actually asked the fucking waitress,
I was just like,
how many,

137
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:08.650
how many ounces is that?
How many beers is that?
Two to three beers.

138
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:10.870
He was like two and a half to two and a half fucking beers.

139
00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:14.200
And I already fantasized about being off the wagon.

140
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.200
This is why I'm always going to be a drunk cause when I'm sober I don't go Ooh,

141
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.010
this is amazing.
Falling Asleep at 10 o'clock at night and waking up with energy.

142
00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:25.750
I don't think that I just started thinking of how much I'm going to drink when I

143
00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:27.360
go back to drinking.
And uh,

144
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:32.430
I can't wait for the fucking king season to start cause I'm going down to that

145
00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:37.180
fucking place.
Probably Take Joey Bart,
nick,
you know,

146
00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:39.730
he's a Pittsburgh guy.
God knows you know him a lot.

147
00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:42.800
Head God knows they grew up on sausages and brought,

148
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.580
might even fucking go with the two of them.
Right?

149
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:50.530
Go down there and get one of those fucking giant bear stuff.

150
00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:51.790
Fucking drink too with us.

151
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:59.210
Become old fucking Macy day bloated belly again.
Um,

152
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:04.100
so I fucked up there and then,
uh,
last night,
um,

153
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.001
I did a Gig,

154
00:09:05.001 --> 00:09:09.560
didn't just outside of San Diego at the Harris Casino Valley Center or something

155
00:09:09.561 --> 00:09:13.610
like that.
Really,
really beautiful part of California.

156
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.030
Like you come off of the five and there's all these little mom and pop stores.

157
00:09:17.031 --> 00:09:18.380
I was making fun of it and shit,
but it,

158
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:23.240
it just had like that vibe of like small towns slash maybe a math problem,

159
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.680
you know,
which is like,
I guess that's what maverick is nowadays.
You know,

160
00:09:27.681 --> 00:09:32.150
probably heroin now,
all that fucking problem going on.
And um,

161
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.610
<v 1>okay.</v>

162
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.200
<v 0>And when we did the Gig,
but uh,</v>

163
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.830
I actually flew down in a helicopter to the Gig I,
uh,

164
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.850
rented in our 44.
And I brought,
uh,
the opener,

165
00:09:43.851 --> 00:09:47.210
Kevin Shay with me and I flew down with my instructor and uh,

166
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.350
and his brother and a dude.
It was,
it was the fucking shit.

167
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.590
I probably lost money on the GIG,
but I don't give a fuck.

168
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.820
It was coolest how we were actually going to land in the parking lot.

169
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.660
They actually have like a little,
uh,
area that they use as a Helo pad.

170
00:10:02.661 --> 00:10:05.270
It's just this corner of the parking lot.
We were going to land there,
get out,

171
00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:08.660
do the Gig and then the end get back in the fucking thing and take off.

172
00:10:08.661 --> 00:10:13.010
But the thing was was it had all these mountains all around it and the main

173
00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:17.690
street in had no lights and there was a lot of power lines in that type of shit.

174
00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:19.280
So we was just like,
Yay,

175
00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:24.281
why don't we landed a fucking local local airport and drive in instead?

176
00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:27.890
Considering neither one of us has ever flown out of here,
you know,

177
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.720
and those are the fucking decisions you make if you want to fly safely.

178
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.830
Um,
they actually had a midair collision down there.
I just saw,

179
00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.253
<v 1>hmm.</v>

180
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.630
<v 0>This little ass airport,
I don't know how to fuck you don't see each other.</v>

181
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

182
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.670
<v 0>You're not talking on the fucking radio.
I don't know man.</v>

183
00:10:45.671 --> 00:10:48.940
That's the kind of shit you just like,
you know,
when you start thinking,
you know,

184
00:10:48.941 --> 00:10:52.570
stuff,
which is always dangerous in any fucking business we started getting,

185
00:10:52.571 --> 00:10:55.040
you know,
I can fucking kind of keep this thing.
Well,

186
00:10:55.041 --> 00:10:59.380
the hardest things when you're first fly is staying at a consistent altitude,

187
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.730
which is supposed to do it in a helicopter is basically look at your manifold

188
00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:07.940
pressure gauge and how whatever inches you're polling.
Uh,

189
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.170
we sounds like I'm jerking off here,
but uh,

190
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.970
what am I thought it's measured in like inches of mercury.
So say if he,

191
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.260
if you're 21 and you look over,
it's your,
uh,

192
00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:21.910
uvs vertical speed indicator.
If it said zero,
um,

193
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:22.810
<v 1>okay.</v>

194
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.240
<v 0>You just,
then you just dial it in and you just keep it.
Okay,</v>

195
00:11:25.241 --> 00:11:29.810
21 inches is what I need to pull in.
I'll stay and keep the fucking,
uh,

196
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.460
God damn cyclic at where I'm at.
But I always ended up fucking it up.

197
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.110
And if I don't look at it for a couple of minutes,

198
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.560
I used to go up like 300 or down or descend 300 feet.

199
00:11:38.561 --> 00:11:42.040
Now I'm kinda within like a hundred feet.
So I kind of felt better about that.

200
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.200
But,
uh,
so anyways,
so I flew down there and then we drove like the,

201
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.900
another 25 minutes,
did the Gig,
had a great fucking time,
great crowd.

202
00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.200
And then we drove back to the airport and fucking

203
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.030
<v 4>flew back man.
And uh,</v>

204
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.450
flew back from just outside of San Diego.

205
00:11:59.451 --> 00:12:04.451
We got back in about 35 minutes flying over all of this fucking traffic and uh,

206
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.730
just flew basically right along the coast the whole way up.
And,
um,

207
00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:15.440
it was cool to do that actually kind of,
you know,
he was teaching me,

208
00:12:15.441 --> 00:12:18.530
so to some instrument stuff where I'm not instrument rated in the course.

209
00:12:18.531 --> 00:12:21.560
That piqued my fucking interest and now,
so a,
why the hell not,

210
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:25.520
I might do that next.
But,
uh,
as you fly in and

211
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.970
<v 0>night,
like it's obviously way different during the day.
And I was just like,</v>

212
00:12:28.971 --> 00:12:31.820
I was just like,
dude,
I'm glad you're here cause I would be completely lost.

213
00:12:31.821 --> 00:12:34.250
I don't know where.
I mean he just pointed up and go see right,
there it goes.

214
00:12:34.251 --> 00:12:37.760
That's the Long Beach Pier.
You can always tell other long beach,
uh,

215
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.550
wharfs peers.
Wow.
What the fuck you call them?

216
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.380
They're all fucking psychotically lit up till it's like the third biggest,
um,

217
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.180
port wharf,
peer,
whatever the fuck you call it in the world I guess.

218
00:12:50.181 --> 00:12:55.181
So it's always all lit up and there's all kinds of fucking x boxes and sex

219
00:12:55.701 --> 00:12:58.580
slaves and blood diamonds going in and out of every fucking day.

220
00:12:58.581 --> 00:13:00.260
So it's always lit up.

221
00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.480
And we ended up landing that,
uh,
Long Beach after was closed,

222
00:13:05.481 --> 00:13:07.190
which is pretty fucking cool.
And they got this thing,

223
00:13:07.191 --> 00:13:10.040
I forget how many times you click it,
but when we took off,

224
00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.960
the airport was already closed so all the fucking lights were out and every

225
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:17.750
<v 4>thing and uh,
on the cyclic he just fucking click,
you know,</v>

226
00:13:17.751 --> 00:13:19.940
we basically,
if you're going to talk to the tower,

227
00:13:19.941 --> 00:13:23.960
you just click it like seven or nine times.
I forget.
And when you do that,

228
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.710
all the lights come on,
the whole fucking field lights up.

229
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.740
It's the shit.
So that's what I did last night.
Huh?

230
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:36.620
Not too shabby.
Uh,
but anyways,
and you know what,

231
00:13:36.621 --> 00:13:38.330
Kevin Shay was really fucking chill.

232
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.810
I thought he was going to be freaking out that I was flying.

233
00:13:41.811 --> 00:13:43.810
He actually said it did a good job and he's,
he actually is,

234
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:46.840
he said this thing where he doesn't freak out when I'm taking off my,
when,

235
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.040
when he's taken off on,
he's up there,
he says when,

236
00:13:49.041 --> 00:13:52.190
when whenever the plane or whatever he's in goes to land.

237
00:13:52.191 --> 00:13:53.090
That's when he freaks out,

238
00:13:53.091 --> 00:13:57.800
which I thought was kind of interesting to just be afraid then.
Um,
anyways,

239
00:13:57.801 --> 00:14:02.660
I'm babbling here.
Uh,
so I was talking about,

240
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.460
Oh yeah,
so that night I fucking,

241
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:10.330
<v 0>you know,
we had to leave like around three 30 and flew down about four o'clock.</v>

242
00:14:10.331 --> 00:14:12.120
So,
uh,
that was right around dinnertime.

243
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.890
And then I got to a casino and I'm just like,
they were like,

244
00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:19.120
we got Mexican food and I'm like,
alright,
you want to talk?
Goes.

245
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.120
Yes.
I bought a burrito

246
00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:30.550
sounding like little John there and I fuckin,
uh,
you know,

247
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:35.950
fucking just inhaled a chicken fucking burrito.

248
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.920
It was,
it was actually really good.
I think I have it,

249
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:42.340
I think was because I haven't eaten like that since the 4th of July.

250
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:46.090
I haven't had any just fucking food that's gonna make you fat.
Fuck.

251
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.890
So it was delicious.
Uh,

252
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.810
but everybody else there was also saying it was good and then was in the back of

253
00:14:52.811 --> 00:14:56.440
my head going,
dude,
don't take it too far now.
Don't take it too far.

254
00:14:56.441 --> 00:15:00.450
So then I reached for a Taco and only had one.
And,
um,

255
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.141
so anyways,

256
00:15:02.141 --> 00:15:07.141
I came back this morning and got on the scale after I took my dog around the

257
00:15:07.421 --> 00:15:11.200
block and then went on like at an hour and a half fucking hike,

258
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.390
weighed myself with an empty stomach.
So I would actually make weight this week.

259
00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:20.650
I know the second I had a glass of water,
I fucker went up like three pounds,

260
00:15:20.651 --> 00:15:24.270
but a,
I'm going to say I'm about 171 pounds this scale red,

261
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:29.190
one 68,
one 70 and one 69.4,

262
00:15:29.191 --> 00:15:32.610
depending on where I put it.
So,
uh,

263
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.340
I just took the middle one,
one 69.4 and that,
cause I,
I hadn't,
you know,

264
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.490
hadn't eaten breakfast.
I had drank any water.
I just added like fucking a couple,

265
00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:44.250
two,
three pounds.
So I'll say I'm one 71.
I might be a little lot,

266
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.090
that might be a little over,
but there you go.
Go Fuck Yourself,
man.

267
00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:51.990
I've lost almost 70 pounds of fucking booze,

268
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.490
Burgers,
ice cream,
potato chips and all of that fucking shit.

269
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.250
Uh,
I feel great.
I can't wait to lose the rest of this.

270
00:16:02.251 --> 00:16:05.280
Whatever the fucking it's going to be.
Whenever I lose the last,

271
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.460
I still can grab a nice fucking handful here,
man.

272
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.270
Whenever I lose the rest of this.
And then the second I get a nice flat stomach,

273
00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:16.110
I'm going to get myself a gallon ice cream and one of those beer steins and I'm

274
00:16:16.111 --> 00:16:17.400
going to go right back up again.

275
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.300
What is the point of losing all the weight if you're not going to go back and

276
00:16:21.301 --> 00:16:24.930
indulge and become complete fat?
Fuck again,
right?

277
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.430
I Dunno.
Maybe you do.
Maybe you're doing it to have a lifestyle change.

278
00:16:29.431 --> 00:16:33.180
I'm just trying to just,
you know,
I don't want to be 40 pounds overweight,

279
00:16:33.181 --> 00:16:37.770
so just fucking dropped out the 20 and I'll go back to zero and then I'll be 20

280
00:16:37.771 --> 00:16:40.980
pounds overweight again,
just in time for my special next year.

281
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:46.230
Big fucking booze head coming at you and I would never do that to you.

282
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.020
Um,
all right,
let's get to a,

283
00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.040
is there any fucking advertising for this week?
Jesus Christ.

284
00:16:53.041 --> 00:16:55.920
I've shit on so many of them.
I don't,
I don't know what is,
what is left?

285
00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.570
Do I have anything?
Oh,
there we go.
Oh,
three,
three little ones.

286
00:17:00.571 --> 00:17:01.950
Remember back in the day,
used to have six.

287
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:09.640
What happened?
Ah,
stick with me through thick and through thin.

288
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.550
They don't give a fuck what I say.
I love this company.
He's keeps,

289
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.900
these people are fucking cool.
Here we go.
But up,
bup,
bup.

290
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:20.830
Mandy's me on bs.
No more sweaty balls.

291
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.890
Put a little mustard on this week.
Me Undies,

292
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.910
me on d all broads.

293
00:17:27.911 --> 00:17:32.040
Where the shawls pull out your dry nuts.
Jake.
I'm in a face.

294
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.260
Why do a black?
I don't care about her race.

295
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.930
She'll like you and your fucking Dick heads.

296
00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:42.330
It's all nice and tightened the Andes.
Oh yeah,
no more sweaty nights.

297
00:17:42.331 --> 00:17:45.940
They got him for the ladies.
Um,
all right.

298
00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:50.100
We all know how sexy confidence can be and that confidence comes from

299
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.330
<v 4>being comfortable.
But how great you,
you can feel.
What the,</v>

300
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:59.100
how great can you feel if your underwear is wrinkling and riding up?

301
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.800
I don't give a shit if it's wrinkled.
I wanted to write up the undies.

302
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.910
You start doing that fucking little,
uh,
Elvis.
Shaky leg,

303
00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:07.350
trying to get it to come back down again.

304
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.040
<v 0>Who?
Yeah,</v>

305
00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.880
<v 4>just dragging along my balls.
Um,</v>

306
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.390
and that's why they've created the world's most comfortable underwear for a

307
00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:18.630
daily dose of confidence.
When you look good,
you feel great.

308
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.650
It's a cliche because it's true.
Well,
you switched it up.
If you look good,

309
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:26.310
you feel good,
you look good,
you don't feel great,
feel great,
you feel great,

310
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.940
you look good.
Yeah.
You feel good,
you look good and you feel great.

311
00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:33.690
You're kind of an arrogant ass.
All right.
Um,
anyways,

312
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.790
it's a cliche because it's true.
Everybody.

313
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.750
Mandy's understands this and that's why they've put it in their coffee and

314
00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:43.470
they've also designed underwear that makes you look and feel fantastic.
You know,

315
00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:48.390
you don't even need wear pants anymore.
Mian is made from Mo Dal.

316
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

317
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.550
<v 4>Model.
I Dunno.
A fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.
Uh,</v>

318
00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:56.670
that's twice as soft as whatever underwear you're wearing right now.

319
00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.990
Me undies has tons of colors and styles and the only place to get matching pairs

320
00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:04.710
from men and women.
They even release a new design every month.

321
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.110
All those poor sweatshop kids.

322
00:19:07.111 --> 00:19:10.110
Once they think that they've used all the material,

323
00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:13.650
they got to go back it back out in the fucking woods,
you know,

324
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:18.450
go find another cotton tree,
right
diet with their own tears.

325
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.640
Plus,
we all know paying for shipping sucks.

326
00:19:20.641 --> 00:19:22.980
So me undies has removed from the equation.

327
00:19:22.981 --> 00:19:27.981
All orders in the U S and Canada shipped for free undies has even more money,

328
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.210
uh,
even as a money back guarantee.

329
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:31.980
If you don't love your first pair of underwears,

330
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.830
if you fucking balls don't feel fucking great,
there's get the,

331
00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.350
you get another pair for free.
Well,

332
00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:39.480
why the fuck would you want another one if you didn't like the first one,

333
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.190
you literally have nothing to lose.

334
00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:45.150
To sweeten the deal me undies is offering you 20% off your first order at

349
00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:30.230
razors that your grandfather used to use back in the war,
right,

350
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.680
but you won't draw them away because the new one's costs of God damn much.

351
00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.053
Not Any

352
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.533

<v 4>Because it dollar shave club over there.</v>

354
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:44.580
Dollar Shave Club sends amazing razors for a few bucks.
Where do they send them?

355
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.060
Wherever you live,
if you sign up with them and when you use them with their

356
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.610
<v 0>members,
only Dr Covey,</v>

357
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:53.443
<v 5>bye.</v>

358
00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.310
<v 0>It's completely changes the game.
My neighbor bed in a bitch,
I hit him,</v>

359
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.830
her fucking kids screaming in the pool everyday.
Forget foam.

360
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:06.780
This stuff is the real deal.
It's magic.
Something happens when you put it on.

361
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:11.580
It's hard to describe,
but it feels amazing.
Jesus,
can you cop out anymore?

362
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.270
Why don't you describe it?
It's hard to describe,
but it's amazing.

363
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:21.000
Um,
it's most gentle.
Peaceful is the most gentle,
peaceful shave imaginable.

364
00:21:21.001 --> 00:21:24.270
You barely know you're shaving and shaving products can leave your face feeling

365
00:21:24.271 --> 00:21:27.120
dry and tight.
Awful.
Dr Carver's,

366
00:21:27.121 --> 00:21:31.500
easy shave butter is high quality stuff.
Just like their razors.

All natural ingredients like pear cactus and black willow bark.

369
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.870
God,
I can't wait to get that up against my face.

370
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.040
Just throw some fucking sandpaper juice in there while you're at it.

371
00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:48.950
They're carby.
Uh,
so your skin feels fresh,

372
00:21:48.951 --> 00:21:52.580
smooth and moisturized after every shave.
It's good.

373
00:21:52.581 --> 00:21:55.250
It's great if you have sensitive skin.

Everybody.
Do you want to the gut?
Do you want to,

379
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.190
the government became a Italian there right off the boat.

380
00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.940
Do you want the government to decide what happens to your property and minor

381
00:22:25.941 --> 00:22:30.800
children?
What,
when,
when I'm alive,

382
00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.970
now what?
I'm dead.
I mean,
I'm in the ground.
I don't think I have an opinion.

383
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:36.021
Um,

384
00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:39.740
it's not make the commitment to protect your family with the last will or living

385
00:22:39.741 --> 00:22:44.240
trust today.
It's national.
Make a will month again this month@legalzoom.com.

386

That's 20 months in a row that has been national.

387
00:22:46.611 --> 00:22:49.670
Make a will month and doing the right thing has never been easier.

388
00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:50.840
They've created a better,

389
00:22:50.841 --> 00:22:53.570
I can't believe that somebody had been walking around this country with a

390
00:22:53.571 --> 00:22:56.960
sandwich board for the last fucking 20 months.
National.

391
00:22:56.961 --> 00:22:59.540
Make a will month ringing that fucking cow bell.

392

Poor bastard Betty skinny though.
Huh?

393
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:09.510
Why can't it be a woman?
Well,
I dunno.
Good.

394
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.400
I don't give a fuck.
You want the job?
Take it.
Ah.

395
00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.140
They've created a better way for you and your spouse to take control of your

family's future.

398
00:23:22.041 --> 00:23:25.400

401

and sat down and every time you walked through the house like you fucking live

403

What's his face?
Rodney Dangerfield members.

422
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.420
Dr Vinnie [inaudible] bots.
He'd always be talking about him.
Well,

423
00:24:51.421 --> 00:24:55.410
we hear on the podcast like to talk about our old friend,
only Anthony Anthony,

424
00:24:55.411 --> 00:25:00.180
Monsanto.
See what that Goombas up to this fucking this month.

425
00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:05.100
Do you know that those guys are over in India right now?

426
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.210
Monsanto and they have like a sister company right now and they're getting,

427
00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:10.890
they're getting sued,
I believe.

428
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.650
Are they getting taken to court because India said,

429
00:25:13.651 --> 00:25:17.460
we don't want genetically modified food.
Can you believe that?

430
00:25:17.461 --> 00:25:19.200
They didn't want their food altered.

431
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.240
They probably looked at all the fucking poison people in this country.

432
00:25:24.241 --> 00:25:25.920
And they're like,
well,
we don't want to be like that.

433
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.380
We already have a population problem.

434
00:25:28.381 --> 00:25:32.700
Last thing we need is these fucking assholes fucking with that curry,
right?

435
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:37.350
That chicken or rice,
a fucking egg playing all that bullshit.
Right.
So what,

436
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.290
what does,
what does Anthony Dewey's a car?
He doesn't give a fuck.

437
00:25:40.291 --> 00:25:45.291
He goes in there anyways and without permission allegedly takes a strain of

438
00:25:47.041 --> 00:25:50.670
their own egg plant and genetically fucking modifies the thing.
And guess what?

439
00:25:50.671 --> 00:25:51.990
They got fucking busted.

440
00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.290
So now it's a big thing whether they're going to go to trial,

441
00:25:55.291 --> 00:25:57.090
if people are going to go to jail and all that.

442
00:25:57.091 --> 00:25:58.380
And you know what Anthony's doing?

443
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.130
He's just throwing money around over there cause he's going to find some corrupt

444
00:26:02.131 --> 00:26:06.930
fucking politician who's going to say fuck this.
I'd rather have a big house

445
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.340
and fuck over a billion of my own countrymen.

446
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:12.600
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

447
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.380
<v 0>Just so I can have a fucking Jacuzzi and a couple of God damn horse come over</v>

448
00:26:16.381 --> 00:26:18.300
there.
Can you believe that?
Um,

449
00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:19.630
<v 2>yeah.</v>

450
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:24.580
<v 0>Scotland actually outlawed genetically altered food.
Ah,
I wish this country</v>

451
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.600
<v 2>okay.</v>

452
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.500
<v 0>It's fucking unbelievable.</v>

453
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:29.020
I'll tell you one thing right now because I'm not a well read guy,
but I can,

454
00:26:29.021 --> 00:26:30.190
I can,
I can predict shit.

455
00:26:30.191 --> 00:26:35.110
I can guarantee you that nobody who has any fucking remote shot of becoming

456
00:26:35.111 --> 00:26:37.350
president basically,

457
00:26:37.351 --> 00:26:40.200
I mean a candidate in the Democratic or Republican party,

458
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:44.830
nobody is going to bring up all Anthony.
They're not going to fucking do it.

459
00:26:44.831 --> 00:26:46.540
They're not going to bring up how all these costs.

460
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:47.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

461
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.850
<v 0>Straw,
all these mines,</v>

462
00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.300
all this money at all these fucking politicians so that they can use words like

463
00:26:52.301 --> 00:26:54.320
organic,
homegrown,

464
00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:58.750
and all of that shit illegally when it isn't and it's just a bunch of fucking

465
00:26:58.751 --> 00:27:02.050
poison.
You know what I mean?
I think it's fucked up,
dude.

466
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.930
I'm going to go on a limb and just say that's really fucked up.

467
00:27:04.931 --> 00:27:08.200
So I want to keep an eye on that man.
Cause I went over there to India obviously,

468
00:27:08.201 --> 00:27:11.100
and as I talked about before,
I did a Gig in the fucking people

469
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:15.730
<v 4>coolest shit that funny as hell.
And I'm,
I don't,
I can't explain it.</v>

470
00:27:15.731 --> 00:27:17.050
I went over there and it just,

471
00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.750
I can't explain it the way the fucking people couldn't explain how great the

472
00:27:19.751 --> 00:27:24.190
underwear was or the shaving cream.
What are the fuck it was,
I know,

473
00:27:24.191 --> 00:27:28.090
I just felt,
uh,
I just liked it over there.
Um,

474
00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.980
so I liked the people and I hope that their food doesn't become fucked up.

475
00:27:32.981 --> 00:27:35.320
Like the food is over here.
And as dumb as I am,

476
00:27:35.321 --> 00:27:37.960
I am speaking from experience because as I told you guys,

477
00:27:37.961 --> 00:27:42.961
I ate and drank like fucking Ernest Hemingway when I was over in France earlier

478
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.270
this year for 10 days.
And I put on only four fucking pounds.

479
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:51.130
I was crushing beers,
rich fucking meals.

480
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:56.510
I was eating fucking call made cream puffs every day and I came home and all

481
00:27:57.521 --> 00:28:00.280
that gang was four pounds.
If I did that shit in this country,

482
00:28:00.281 --> 00:28:05.050
I would have fucking game 15,
17 fucking pounds.
Um,

483
00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:06.490
<v 1>okay.</v>

484
00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.950
<v 4>Telling you,
man,
this,
I don't know if there's something going on.
Believe me.</v>

485
00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:12.130
Don't believe me.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm just throwing it out there.
And,
uh,

486
00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.530
so I know you guys have any good stories about all our good friend there,

487
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.900
Anthony.
We'll see an Anthony Monsanto.
See,
uh,
you know,

488
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:22.900
we'll try to just keep an eye on them.
See what,

489
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:28.390
see what the fuck he's been up to.
Um,

490
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.030
all right,
so as I mentioned this time of year,

491
00:28:31.031 --> 00:28:34.990
I actually start to pay attention to baseball because I fucking love October

492
00:28:34.991 --> 00:28:38.620
baseball.
You know,
they fucking uh,

493
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.090
put all the extra Mike's in there and the crowd sound amazing.
It's cold.

494
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:47.920
You know the trophies on the line,
fucking legendary shit happens.

495
00:28:47.921 --> 00:28:50.590
I can't wait,
you know,
so coming out of the dog days of summer here,

496
00:28:50.591 --> 00:28:54.850
so I'm starting to pay attention.
So for those of you not paying attention,

497
00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.870
my fucking red socks,
I have not.
I've watched one game this year.

498
00:28:58.871 --> 00:29:03.340
There are 52 and 65,
a 0.44 winning percentage.

499
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:08.510
They are 12 and a half games out and they've played 117 games.

500
00:29:08.561 --> 00:29:10.090
What are they pay one 62.

501
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:15.300
So they got about 40 fucking five games left.
Oh,
geesh.

502
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

503
00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.710
<v 4>Oh my God.
If we want all 45 we could only win.</v>

504
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:21.230
There's no way we can win a hundred games this year.

505
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.660
We need to go about 40 and five.
I think we got a shot at winning the division.

506
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.560
I actually know the fucking Yankees.

507
00:29:29.561 --> 00:29:33.090
There's 64 and 52 we're not going to catch him,
but

508
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:39.000
12 and a half games out.
Yeah,
I'd say this is a rap.

509
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.680
Toronto's a half game out.
Loving that hope they keep plummeting.

510
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.270
I Love Baltimore and I love fucking Tampa Bay.
I like don't see,
I don't like,

511
00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.570
I don't like Toronto.
He,
they,
they,
they really belong in the fucking leave.

512
00:29:50.571 --> 00:29:53.390
What are you doing here?
You know,
get your own sport.

513
00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.110
You don't see us playing your sport.
Do you?

514
00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:02.210
Fucking red sox lost again today.
Lost again today.

515
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:05.630
10 to eight put up eight runs and still couldn't fucking hold him off.

516
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:11.180
Um,
all right,
let's get to the standings here.
How's Kansas City doing?

517
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.400
Kansas City first fucking place.
Best record in the fucking American league.

518
00:30:16.401 --> 00:30:20.520
I love it.
We went five and five.

519
00:30:20.521 --> 00:30:24.510
Our last 10 Yankees went four and six.
Toronto and eight and two.
This surgeon,

520
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.760
Kansas City,
seven and three.

521
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.100
That's fucking tremendous.
Detroit's four and a half back.

522
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.900
Minnesota is one and a half back.
I,

523
00:30:34.901 --> 00:30:37.900
you got yourself a race day and when the fuck did the Astros go to the American

524
00:30:37.901 --> 00:30:38.734
league?

525
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:44.320
What the fuck happened there?
Who switched?

526
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.740
Milwaukee did a long time ago.

527
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.950
All right.
That's fucking weird.
Washington and Atlanta.
Miami,

528
00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.990
Philly,
Saint Louis.

529
00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.050
I don't get time to figure this fucking shit out.
All right,

530
00:31:01.051 --> 00:31:04.620
so Kansas City's my team loved to see Kansas City.

531
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.460
I'm liking the match day long tortured fucking fans.

532
00:31:08.461 --> 00:31:12.810
Even though they're new Yorkers.
I don't give a fuck.
Philadelphia.
Jesus Christ.

533
00:31:12.811 --> 00:31:17.720
What happened in Philly?
Saint Louis has always fucking there.

534
00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.800
Oh God.
They're gonna make a run again.
Jesus Christ.
St Louis.
Is there that fire?

535
00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.690
What of what?
Of what a fucking whatever organization.
I'm sorry.

536
00:31:23.691 --> 00:31:24.680
This is boring as shit.

537
00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.960
He just listened to me looking at the God damn stats here.
Um,
all right,

538
00:31:29.961 --> 00:31:32.540
here's something fucked up.
You guys see that story on Patrick Kane?

539
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.550
I shouldn't even set his fucking name,

540
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.120
that Patrick Kane story where he's getting,

541
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:42.650
he's charged with allegedly a,
what the hell is it here?

542
00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.920
Let's make sure I get this right.
Um,
oh,

543
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:52.930
for God's sakes with the fuck is it basically he's charged with allegedly raping

544
00:31:53.631 --> 00:31:54.464
somebody.

545
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:58.490
So some Douche bag is that is saying that the NHL needs to suspend them.

546
00:31:58.491 --> 00:32:02.780
It's like did that right there is the reason why not only should the victim be

547
00:32:02.781 --> 00:32:06.770
protected,
that the person being accused should be protected.

548
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.210
He shouldn't put the guy's name and face and drag them to the fucking mud.

549
00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.440
You know,
am I the only guy who remembers that rolling stone story?

550
00:32:15.441 --> 00:32:18.980
And that's not the only time that that has happened.
All right?

551
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.480
So in fairness,

552
00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.200
considering what this guy has to lose,

553
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:29.840
he should be treated with the same respect as the alleged victim because it's

554
00:32:29.841 --> 00:32:34.750
all a legend.
You shouldn't be fucking,
this isn't,

555
00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.690
it's none of my fucking business right now.

556
00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.180
You know what I mean?
Let it go to trial,

557
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:46.680
<v 0>have the whole thing come out in the fucking wash.
And in the end,</v>

558
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:50.530
if he's found guilty,
then not only suspend them,
you got to,

559
00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:53.670
you can't have a fucking convicted rapist and yell,
let's the end of his career.

560
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.830
That's the point.
My voice just cracked it.
That's the end of his fucking career.

561
00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.160
I'm not trying to uh,
attack either person here.

562
00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:06.000
I'm just saying in the future they really need to start fucking doing this

563
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.670
because let's just play devil's advocate the way this blogger is.

564
00:33:10.671 --> 00:33:12.330
His fucking talking about Patrick Kane.

565
00:33:12.331 --> 00:33:15.360
Like he's already been convicted and just sit in there.

566
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.660
How are we holding our athletes and fucking blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

567
00:33:18.661 --> 00:33:21.210
and we just can't wrap our heads around that condescending

568
00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.120
<v 4>link fucking speak.
You know,</v>

569
00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:28.080
like I'm sitting there with a poster of him on my fucking wall in a racing car

570
00:33:28.081 --> 00:33:32.850
bed.
Um,
Jay to people in power take advantage of it.

571
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:37.060
Wow.
What else do you know?
They are fucking no named blogger.
Um,

572
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:42.180
anyways,
I think that,
you know,
that they shouldn't put the,

573
00:33:42.181 --> 00:33:43.790
they also should protect the accused and two,

574
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.920
because this guy has so much to fucking lose in the bottom line is once you get

575
00:33:46.921 --> 00:33:51.540
accused of that shit,
it's fucking over.
Even if they find out,

576
00:33:51.541 --> 00:33:55.890
even if the victim were to come out and just say,
Hey,
I made the whole thing up.

577
00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:00.660
I don't know what I was thinking.
Sorry about that.
Fucking see you.
Right.

578
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:04.230
And of course you can say that as a woman and not go to fucking jail after you

579
00:34:04.231 --> 00:34:08.970
just ruined the guys life.
I'm sorry,
I was just in a mood,

580
00:34:08.971 --> 00:34:09.804
you know,

581
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.030
<v 0>then I went out and I got some breakfast and I felt better and I realized,</v>

582
00:34:14.031 --> 00:34:15.800
you know what,
he didn't write may actually,

583
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:18.400
<v 3>I kind of enjoy it.</v>

584
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:22.450
<v 0>So anyways,
that's what I'm saying.</v>

585
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:27.480
You shouldn't say either person's name and then you know when it goes to trial,

586
00:34:28.571 --> 00:34:31.330
if the person's convicted,
then tar and feather them.

587
00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.970
I think that's more than fair,

588
00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:40.060
<v 4>don't you?
I Dunno.
So anyways,
so let me,</v>

589
00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:44.350
so here's the thing,
if Patrick Kane is acquitted of this,

590
00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:49.240
if it doesn't go to trial,
don't be a fucking cunt and yell some Shit,

591
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:53.530
Adam at games when you know when your team's playing them,
cause you're mad,

592
00:34:53.531 --> 00:34:56.830
you can't beat the fucking Blackhawks.
Don't be at dose.
All right?

593
00:34:56.831 --> 00:34:59.800
But like I said,
if he fucking did it,
you know he should go to jail and uh,

594
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:01.300
right there.
Right.

595
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.190
Um,
I dunno.
Most fucking move on here.
Uh,

596
00:35:11.191 --> 00:35:15.000
what w what else do I got?
How much fucking thought?
35 minutes.
Okay.
Um,

597
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.980
what else did I want to talk about?
I think that was basically it.
Yeah.

598
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:21.180
<v 3>MMM.</v>

599
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.140
<v 4>I got anything else that got anything coming up?
I don't,</v>

600
00:35:24.141 --> 00:35:28.430
I'm just still fucking editing.
I'm
editing.

601
00:35:28.431 --> 00:35:29.740
This F is for family.

602
00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.593
<v 3>Uh,</v>

603
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.760
<v 0>I gotta go back in tomorrow and all that type of shit.</v>

604
00:35:34.761 --> 00:35:36.320
I can't wait for you guys to see this shit.

605
00:35:36.321 --> 00:35:38.160

645
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.760
and with that,
let's get back to the,
let's get to your questions this week.

646
00:38:05.761 --> 00:38:09.540
I think of running my mouth enough about myself and what I've been up to and the

647
00:38:09.541 --> 00:38:13.620
things that I find important.
Um,
all right.
Fat Shaming,

648
00:38:13.621 --> 00:38:18.600
success story.
All right,
cool.
It was a rough one,
you know.
All right.
Hey Bill,

649
00:38:18.601 --> 00:38:23.490
I'm six feet tall and five months ago I weighed 320 pounds.
Big Boy.

650
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:25.890
Jesus Buddy.
All right,

651
00:38:25.891 --> 00:38:29.010
I'm now down to two 43 and trying to get around,

652
00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.170
trying to get down to around 200.

653
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:33.810
I've been using your self shaming method and it's,

654
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.040
and it's obvious that it works.
I fucking love

655
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.970
<v 0>that self shaming wins you getting in there,
how you're taking your shirt off,</v>

656
00:38:39.971 --> 00:38:43.000
standing in the mirror,
jumping up and down.
Look what your dad

657
00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:48.550
and you and you fucking build yourself up turning around.
He said,

658
00:38:48.551 --> 00:38:51.430
even though my people tell me I look good,
I don't let up on myself.

659
00:38:51.431 --> 00:38:55.030
Thanks for the motivation to go fuck yourself.
Yeah,
man.
You got to do it.

660
00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.480
You got to stay on yourself.
And this is the thing too.
I look,

661
00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:02.950
this is a psychologically how I look at it.
I look at it like,
uh,

662
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:07.850
each,
each week is a game like in the NFL season.
All right?

663
00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:12.250
I get on the scale.
I figured out how much fucking weight I need to lose.

664
00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:16.020
All right?
I needed to lose like a good fucking,
you know,
I was a good,
Ooh,

665
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.680
oh Jesus.
You know my fighting weight,
you know,
when I had a blast,

666
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:23.860
I had a flat stomach goes between like one 62,
one 65.
So I was up to one 87.

667
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:28.360
So I needed to lose a good 2025 pounds.
All right?
So I figured,

668
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:32.560
you know,
I lose two to three a fucking week.
I'm looking at a good 10 weeks,

669
00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:37.000
10 10 week season here.
So what I do is if I lose,

670
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:38.890
I have it on the,
on the calendar,

671
00:39:38.891 --> 00:39:43.270
I write the weight that I'm at and every Sunday I just write down the weight

672
00:39:43.271 --> 00:39:47.980
that I want to be the next Sunday.
And,
uh,
I weigh myself every day,

673
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:52.980
sometimes a couple of times a day I get fucking psychotic with it.
And,
um,

674
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.990
I try to make weight every Sunday and I tried and I tried to do it without

675
00:39:55.991 --> 00:39:58.990
starving myself because then you just kind of eat away at muscle and you become

676
00:39:58.991 --> 00:40:02.980
very fleshy,
very fleshy.
Um,

677
00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:05.500
which is you just all gelatinous and shit.
You want the muscle cars.

678
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.230
I guess it eats the fat because that's what somebody in a bar who wasn't a

679
00:40:08.231 --> 00:40:12.310
fucking nutritionist told me.
All right,
so,

680
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.020
and then how I,
how I do it.

681
00:40:14.021 --> 00:40:18.520
So I don't fuck up is cause I know that there's no way I'm going to go 10

682
00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:22.180
fucking straight weeks in,
eat absolutely perfectly.

683
00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:26.290
I know at some point I'm going to fuck up and have a burrito and a Taco and a

684
00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:29.320
fucking brought or whatever the fuck I did.
Um,

685
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.190
and I just tried to immediately get back on the stick.
And then that week,

686
00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.670
if I don't make weight,
I just,
I call that week a loss.

687
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.030
And then I just look at my record.
I just pretend I'm a coach.
All right.

688
00:40:40.031 --> 00:40:44.560
I was too.
And Oh,
now I'm two and one I can't go to and toe can't go two and two,

689
00:40:44.561 --> 00:40:46.560
then the local fucking sport writers are going to give.

690
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:51.040
Those are trying to make a change,
you know?
So,
uh,

691
00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:55.450
I won the first two weeks with this diet.
I lost the next one.

692
00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.930
I tried to call it a bye week,
but I'll say that's a loss.
I was two and one,

693
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:02.830
then I won the next two weeks in a row on this week I was looking at a loss.

694
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:06.230
So instead of being five and one,
I was looking at foreign too.

695
00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:09.100
And I didn't like that number and I just went really hardcore with the working

696
00:41:09.101 --> 00:41:11.740
out and trying to eat as perfect as I could.
So I,

697
00:41:11.741 --> 00:41:14.650
I just just look at it that way.
And if you,
uh,
you know,

698
00:41:14.651 --> 00:41:15.970
if you fuck up or whatever,

699
00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.630
it's not the end of the world unless you allow it to be.

700
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.450
And I think a lot of people,
myself included,
is when you,

701
00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:27.310
when you fuck up on your diet
the next day,

702
00:41:27.311 --> 00:41:30.760
what you have to watch out is when you eat a bunch of grease or sugar or salt,

703
00:41:30.761 --> 00:41:35.090
you're going to wake up the next day and you're going to crave that shit.
Um,

704
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.481
so what,

705
00:41:35.481 --> 00:41:40.100
you've basically started as a little fire that you can easily stomp out with

706
00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:43.610
your fucking slippers while you're still in your bathrobe by just making

707
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:48.670
yourself a bowl of oatmeal or something healthy for breakfast and then you eat

708
00:41:48.741 --> 00:41:52.340
that you're,
because you've been eating so well,
you're going to want to,

709
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:56.630
you're going to still be on that craven,
uh,
healthy stuff.

710
00:41:56.631 --> 00:42:00.030
This is how it works for me.
Okay.
Obviously I'm not a nutritionist.
I'm not,

711
00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:04.520
none of us know sports medicine,
nothing.
This is just what's working for me.
I've,

712
00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:07.730
I've realized after years,

713
00:42:07.731 --> 00:42:09.980
I think it was stupid when people said food is a drug.

714
00:42:09.981 --> 00:42:14.390
I realized finally now that it is,
so when I fuck up,

715
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:18.110
you know,
and I basically,
in a food version,

716
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.210
you hit the crack pipe.

717
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:24.680
I just make sure the next day that when I get up like

718
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.950
<v 2>okay,</v>

719
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.650
<v 0>before I even had like I,
you know,
I go for a walk,</v>

720
00:42:29.651 --> 00:42:34.540
I drink some water with some lemon and that will really calm you down,
you know,

721
00:42:34.541 --> 00:42:38.740
so you don't get a fucking Danish or go out and get some waffles or some salty

722
00:42:38.741 --> 00:42:43.030
fucking eggs and cheese and bacon and all that shit.
Um,

723
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.740
<v 2>yeah,</v>

724
00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:47.970
<v 4>that's what's been working for me.
So if you want to go from two 34 to 43 to 200,</v>

725
00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:53.370
uh,
just maybe,
you know,
try that.
If it works for you,
works for,
if it doesn't,

726
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.060
then I'm sure there's a zillion other things on the Internet by,
you know,

727
00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:59.370
professionals,
but a,
I'm happy for you,
man.
That's fucking insane,
dude.

728
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.330
That's what,
three 20 to,

729
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:04.250
<v 2>okay.</v>

730
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:08.730
<v 4>That's almost 80 fucking pounds.
77 pounds.
Dude,</v>

731
00:43:08.731 --> 00:43:12.920
that's unbelievable.
Good for you,
man.
Keep going.
All right.
Drought Shaming.

732
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.580
Oh God.
Hey Bill.
Up here in northern California.

733
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:18.830
We are on tight water restriction.

734
00:43:18.831 --> 00:43:23.000
Pretty much everyone's lawns are dead or mostly Brown.
Personally,

735
00:43:23.001 --> 00:43:26.480
it's driving me up the wall.
They have a dead ass yard.
But you know,

736
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.810
I'm going to do my part.
My issue is the selfish cons,

737
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.650
who have the fucking nerve to just flood that God damn lawns like their

738
00:43:33.651 --> 00:43:37.320
specialists.
Something I want to drought shame,
uh,

739
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:41.570
the blatant water users in my neighborhood,
but I don't want to shit where I eat.

740
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.610
Do you have any thoughts or advice,
by the way?
We saw your show,
uh,

741
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.470
when you came to Sacramento and you killed now.
We hope you come back soon.

742
00:43:48.471 --> 00:43:50.060
I'll thank you.
Um,

743
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:55.060
<v 0>well look,
I never advocate Rad not ratting somebody out.</v>

744
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.370
Um,
but it's a weird thing when,

745
00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.960
when somebody is doing something that affects the whole tribe,

746
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:04.180
you know what I mean?
This isn't like a,
you know,

747
00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:05.830
<v 2>yeah.</v>

748
00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:08.230
<v 0>The guy drove home.
I Dunno.
I whatever,
I'm trying,</v>

749
00:44:08.231 --> 00:44:09.550
I can't think of a fucking example.

750
00:44:09.551 --> 00:44:12.520
This is something that really is affecting the entire state.

751
00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.270
Um,
I,
I don't know what I would do.

752
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:18.530
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

753
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:22.070
<v 0>Why don't we leave him an anonymous note and just say,
listen,</v>

754
00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:26.720
I'm not trying to be a jerk,
but we are in a drought.
Um,

755
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.530
you're not supposed to be watering your lawn and I'm not the kind of person to

756
00:44:30.531 --> 00:44:32.130
rat somebody out.
That's what you do.

757
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.000
And I would really hope that you don't put me in a position to have to call the

758
00:44:36.001 --> 00:44:39.840
local authorities about you watering the shit out of your fucking lawn.

759
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.990
So then basically what you did is you went passive aggressive.

760
00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:46.330
You didn't rat him out.
You basically listen,
dude,
though we adopt,

761
00:44:46.331 --> 00:44:49.290
but don't make me fucking do this.
But at the end of the day,
man,
I mean we're,

762
00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.960
we're in serious fucking trouble here.
So,

763
00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:54.260
<v 1>okay,</v>

764
00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:58.160
<v 0>that whole no snitching thing.
It's,
it's becomes a little bit of a gray area.</v>

765
00:44:58.161 --> 00:45:01.970
So why don't you give the guy a fucking chance,
you know,

766
00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.650
don't be a cunt in the letter.
Just say,
please,
I don't rat people out.

767
00:45:06.651 --> 00:45:07.161
But you know,

768
00:45:07.161 --> 00:45:12.161
this is the needs of the state and the people in the state are way bigger than

769
00:45:12.551 --> 00:45:15.130
you and your yard.
Please don't put me in a position.

770
00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:18.430
<v 4>You got to go walking.
I can.
True Romance.</v>

771
00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:22.270
When he fucking clasped his hands together,
like whatever.
He said,
I beg you,

772
00:45:22.271 --> 00:45:23.800
don't put me in this position or something.

773
00:45:23.801 --> 00:45:25.720
Whatever the fuck he said that that's what I would do.

774
00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:30.660
So then you don't have to fucking rat them out then if you know he keeps water

775
00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:34.030
in his yard lawn,
I don't know.
What do you do?
You know what?

776
00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:36.200
You do your pussy out and you have your wife make the coffee.

777
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:42.460
I Dunno man.
I,
I really have zero tolerance when it comes to people.
Uh,

778
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.393
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

779
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:47.520
<v 4>I bet.
But look at me.</v>

780
00:45:47.521 --> 00:45:51.990
I flew a fucking helicopter down to my fucking Gig and I'm not using bottled

781
00:45:51.991 --> 00:45:55.470
water,
but this is,
my instructor was saying like,
Dude,

782
00:45:55.471 --> 00:45:59.520
we just fucking sent leaded gas through the atmosphere.
So I mean,

783
00:45:59.521 --> 00:46:01.920
I'm a fucking hypocrite too.
I don't know what to tell you,

784
00:46:01.921 --> 00:46:06.921
but it does bug me when everybody else is trying to tighten the fucking belt and

785
00:46:07.021 --> 00:46:09.330
there was that person just fucking water in the shower.
I'll tell you that

786
00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:13.310
<v 0>my neighborhood man,
they fucking water and the shit out of it.
I don't think,</v>

787
00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:16.610
I don't even have any grass and my fucking yard.
You know what I mean?

788
00:46:16.611 --> 00:46:18.950
I've got a couple of I water the uh,

789
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:20.330
<v 1>yeah,</v>

790
00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:22.700
<v 0>I water the plants that are actually producing food.</v>

791
00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:25.670
My wife likes all these other fucking plants.
I was like,
well,

792
00:46:25.671 --> 00:46:27.650
who gives a fuck about a plan if it's not,
feed me.

793
00:46:27.651 --> 00:46:29.810
What the fuck do I care about it?
Let's get them Outta here.
Right.

794
00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.690
So that's a bit of a fight.
But like some of my neighbors met,

795
00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:35.930
it's like they wanted their shit and uh,

796
00:46:35.931 --> 00:46:39.320
what kills me is not that they're necessarily watering it.

797
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:44.510
It's this sprinklers is so fucked up.
It's just shooting out into the street.

798
00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:45.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

799
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:49.980
<v 0>Landing on the,
the hot tar and then just evaporating.
Um,</v>

800
00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:53.730
what they're really doing is spraying people's cars that probably just got 'em

801
00:46:53.731 --> 00:46:54.810
washed,
which you're not supposed to.

802
00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:58.550
I haven't washed my car and fucking months look too,
we're all fucking try.

803
00:46:58.551 --> 00:47:01.290
And maybe that guy with the green lawn,
maybe he's doing something else.

804
00:47:01.291 --> 00:47:02.660
I have no idea.
But,
uh,

805
00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:08.350
<v 4>you know,
look at me.
I mean,
I fucking,
I fly around in helicopters.</v>

806
00:47:08.351 --> 00:47:13.030
Who the fuck am I to say that?
I'm all right.
Here we go.

807
00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:17.770
It's Phil Collins,
a good drummer.
Bill.
Bill,
insert generic redhead insult here.

808
00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:21.130
Oh,
okay.
Thank you.
Uh,
what do you think about Phil Collins is a drummer.

809
00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.300
His drummer was,
his drumming was a staple of the 80s,

810
00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.380
but he never shows up on any greatest drummers list.
Uh,

811
00:47:29.381 --> 00:47:30.580
as a drum enthusiast

812
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:31.121
<v 0>yourself,</v>

813
00:47:31.121 --> 00:47:35.140
can you explain why is he not a great drummer as an average music listener,

814
00:47:35.141 --> 00:47:39.130
but not a drum expert?
I think he's,
he drums like an awesome mother fucker,

815
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:43.430
but I know fuck all about the technicalities of drumming except,
uh,

816
00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.510
what you shared is Phil Collins great or even good.
Please help.

817
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:49.510
Phil Collins is a fucking monster.

818
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:54.220
He's an unbelievable fucking drummer and he has his own sound.

819
00:47:54.221 --> 00:47:57.190
And what I love is the time when he came up,

820
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000
there was this fad of having no bottom head on your toms,

821
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:05.380
which are basically the,
the,
you know,

822
00:48:05.381 --> 00:48:08.950
you have your bass drum or snare drums and then like,
you know,
basically,

823
00:48:08.951 --> 00:48:11.560
you know,
someone doesn't feel Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
The plan,

824
00:48:11.561 --> 00:48:13.990
those fucking things.
Those are your Tom Tom's,
right.

825
00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:19.450
So there was a time where having no bottom head for whatever fucking reason,

826
00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.880
and they were called concert Tom's,

827
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.480
there was people that just like that sound like they went through this whole

828
00:48:25.481 --> 00:48:29.830
studio time in the studio I think where they were really deadening the sound

829
00:48:29.831 --> 00:48:32.890
like drums or really had a dead sound.
And maybe that's why they did it.

830
00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:37.390
I don't know,
I'm getting in over my head very quickly here.
But um,

831
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:41.710
he came up,
you know,
when I go all the way back to the,
the,

832
00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:46.090
when he was just playing drums in genesis and Peter Gabriel was still in it and

833
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:49.090
they will,
that whole prog rock band.
Um,

834
00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:54.190
I think even back then he didn't have any bottom heads and he has his own sound

835
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:59.400
and he's fucking lefthanded and he's an absolute fucking monster and I'm in the

836
00:49:00.281 --> 00:49:03.460
air tonight.
That fucking drum fill.
That's one of those things that,
you know,

837
00:49:03.461 --> 00:49:05.980
I guess if you played drums for three months,
you could mimic it,

838
00:49:05.981 --> 00:49:10.180
but could you come up with it?
Um,
so why doesn't he get credit?
Well,

839
00:49:10.181 --> 00:49:13.000
I would say because he played,

840
00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:16.090
when he played drums in Genesis,

841
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:20.140
they were progressive rock band and I think it was,
I dunno,

842
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:24.800
it was just too fucking avant garde.
It wasn't pop.
So,
um,

843
00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:29.470
he didn't quite get the credit.
And then when the 80s came around,

844
00:49:29.471 --> 00:49:31.360
he kind of became the,
became the front man.

845
00:49:31.361 --> 00:49:33.930
He became the singer and he'd go back,
there was a chest,

846
00:49:33.931 --> 00:49:36.430
a Thompson and they'd have like a,
they play drums together,

847
00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:39.340
maybe do a little drum battle or something like that.
But then it was considered,

848
00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:42.930
oh wow,
look,
he can lose.
A lot of people even by the 80s were like,
oh,

849
00:49:42.931 --> 00:49:46.150
he can play drums too.
They didn't know that.
He likes started off as a drummer.

850
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.020
He's one of those amazing guys that like,
you know,

851
00:49:50.021 --> 00:49:54.250
is it like Dave Grohl where he's in fucking nirvana and your lead singer dies?

852
00:49:54.251 --> 00:49:56.170
I mean,
you're usually fucked as a drummer.

853
00:49:56.171 --> 00:50:01.171
That guy stepped out to the forefront and started his own band is become a front

854
00:50:01.901 --> 00:50:02.980
man in his own right.

855
00:50:02.981 --> 00:50:06.520
And I always talk about that and I never thought to think that Phil Collins did

856
00:50:06.521 --> 00:50:11.500
the same thing on Peter Gabriel left and he just went out to right to the front.

857
00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:14.430
Um,
Don Henley Henley's another guy,

858
00:50:14.431 --> 00:50:17.100
but he always sang when he was with the eagles,
but end he was,

859
00:50:17.101 --> 00:50:18.120
why does he get the credit?

860
00:50:18.121 --> 00:50:22.430
I think because of songs like studio.

861
00:50:22.431 --> 00:50:27.150
And he was completely overexposed in the 80s and he made really schlocky pop

862
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:27.521
music.

863
00:50:27.521 --> 00:50:32.521
He went from being this underground outsider guy to just right in the cross

864
00:50:33.051 --> 00:50:37.600
hairs and being the most successful guy of an age.

865
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.823
And then you,

866
00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:44.580
you just get branded like you're an eighties guy and then the next decade comes

867
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:48.970
and everybody did the youth from that immediately revolts against whatever

868
00:50:48.971 --> 00:50:52.120
happened the previous fucking decade.

869
00:50:52.121 --> 00:50:54.760
And then the decade before is considered cool.
Like in the 80s,

870
00:50:54.761 --> 00:50:57.970
everybody was about 60,
the 60s and the woods.
Woodstock was great.

871
00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:01.870
Everybody hated fucking disco.
the 90s came around,
they were like,

872
00:51:01.871 --> 00:51:04.480
fuck hair metal and all that stupid ass fucking shit.

873
00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:09.460
And then all of a sudden the 70s became cool and the bgs were somehow being

874
00:51:09.461 --> 00:51:13.960
played again and fucking,
uh,
dirt teglar Boogie Nights,
all of that shit,

875
00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:18.340
dazed and confused.
All those fucking movies came out right in the 80s.

876
00:51:18.341 --> 00:51:21.970
You had like fucking platoon and all that shit talking about the Vietnam War and

877
00:51:21.971 --> 00:51:26.170
fucking Woodstock and hippies and all of that fucking crap.
Seventies.

878
00:51:26.171 --> 00:51:29.890
What'd you have?
You had a happy days,
right bill?
We fucking get it.
All right.

879
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:33.710
So I think,
but when you're like,
uh,

880
00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.400
the face of an era,

881
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:40.630
like people won't let you change and they,
they,
uh,

882
00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:44.800
I don't think in the 70s when he was playing drums that they were popular,

883
00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:49.230
popular enough that people understand how great a fucking drummer he is.
And,
um,

884
00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:50.640
<v 1>okay.</v>

885
00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.510
<v 0>And then by the 80 [inaudible]</v>

886
00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:53.980
<v 4>she's singing that cheesy shit that I absolutely fucking hate,</v>

887
00:51:53.981 --> 00:51:57.850
but derosa loves it and he's like 10 years younger than me,

888
00:51:57.851 --> 00:52:00.890
so I don't know.
But I will say he played with the,

889
00:52:00.891 --> 00:52:05.620
he so many fucking great tracks he played on.
He played on Robert Plant's,
uh,

890
00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:10.680
I'm in the mood that that first solo album he did after Rod Zeplin had to break

891
00:52:10.811 --> 00:52:14.020
up cause bottom died,
I believe it was his first solo album.

892
00:52:14.021 --> 00:52:16.030
Just fucking amazing drums.

893
00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:17.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

894
00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:21.180
<v 4>For like a pop song.
And just as phrasing this,
the way he chooses,</v>

895
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:26.220
I dunno just his,
the way he expresses himself.

896
00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:30.900
I think he's a fucking monster and he gets extra cool credit notes because he's

897
00:52:30.901 --> 00:52:33.660
a lefty.
Um,
I'd last I read about him.

898
00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:38.850
He really fucked up his back as a lot of drummers did from his era because they

899
00:52:38.851 --> 00:52:41.160
knew nothing about stretching and yoga and that type of shit.

900
00:52:41.161 --> 00:52:43.980
And especially if you sang and you,
and they used to have like those Mikes,

901
00:52:43.981 --> 00:52:47.250
so you'd be playing and you'd have,
you'd be turning your neck.

902
00:52:47.251 --> 00:52:50.530
I know Don Henley fucked up his neck,
the one that,
um,

903
00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.590
a lot of drummers that sang back then,
in fact,

904
00:52:52.591 --> 00:52:53.900
if you look a lot of older drummers,

905
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:57.300
they go from having a drum throne to have and like that,
uh,
back,

906
00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:02.070
like literally like a regular chair,
you know,
support that back.
And,
um,

907
00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:06.660
but anyways,
I'm fucking rambling here.
He,
he,
he's a fucking monster.

908
00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:10.860
Absolute fucking monster.
So,
uh,
but what I've heard recently,

909
00:53:10.861 --> 00:53:15.190
he started playing again,
so maybe fixed his back,
but,
uh,

910
00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:17.010
I read a real depressing article about a month,

911
00:53:17.011 --> 00:53:20.130
a few years ago when rolling stone where he was like retired from drumming and

912
00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:23.400
he was confused as to why he was called the antichrist,
you know,

913
00:53:23.401 --> 00:53:27.950
because of his shit from the 80s.
And,
and uh,
I dunno,
I felt bad for the guy,

914
00:53:27.951 --> 00:53:31.250
so I was psych one it heard he was drumming against.
So and if I get a chance,

915
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:34.460
I'm definitely going to go see him and I'll sit through all that studio

916
00:53:34.461 --> 00:53:37.280
horseshit just to hear him play drums.
All right,

917
00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:41.120
a fucked up cheating story needed.
Vice d uh,
dear bill.

918
00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:42.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

919
00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.960
<v 4>All right.
I could really use a advice on this.</v>

920
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:50.290
I found out accidentally that my best friend since births girlfriend has been

921
00:53:50.781 --> 00:53:54.290
fucking our other best friend behind his back for over a year.

922
00:53:54.291 --> 00:53:57.260
Now wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Let me back up here.

923
00:53:57.290 --> 00:54:01.730
I found out at that my best friends,
my best friend sends births,

924
00:54:01.731 --> 00:54:05.930
girlfriend.
All right,
so your buddy,
since you were a toddler,
he has a girlfriend.

925
00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:10.340
She's been fucking your other best friend behind his back for over a year now.

926
00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:12.410
Oh my God.

927
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:14.703
<v 1>Wow.</v>

928
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:17.390
<v 4>Okay.
Hey,
we go.</v>

929
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:22.010
I was checking something on his phone and stumbled across naked pictures.

930
00:54:22.011 --> 00:54:26.930
She had sent him shocked to see it.
I dug further.
Wait a fucking minute.

931
00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.290
The fuck are you doing with this

932
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:31.620
<v 0>phone?
What were you checking on his phone.</v>

933
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:34.010
<v 1>Okay,</v>

934
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.843
<v 4>wait a minute.</v>

935
00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.313
<v 1>Okay.</v>

936
00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.000
<v 0>What the fuck this,
this is?
This whole fucking thing is weird.</v>

937
00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.440
Are you the guy that's actually fucking your best friend's girlfriend and you're

938
00:54:44.441 --> 00:54:48.280
speaking about yourself and the third person?
This whole thing is weird.

939
00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.520
I was checking something on his phone.

940
00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:56.320
I've never checked anything on any of my friends' phones ever.

941
00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:57.830
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

942
00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:01.180
<v 0>You know,
if they handed to me,
I look at whatever picture is there.</v>

943
00:55:01.181 --> 00:55:04.510
I don't start swiping around and snooping.
You were snooping.

944
00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:13.150
What kind of a fucking man?
Jesus Christ.
See a snooping on this guy's phone.

945
00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:17.290
You stumbled across naked pictures whenever you stumbled across.

946
00:55:17.291 --> 00:55:17.971
You kicked on that.

947
00:55:17.971 --> 00:55:21.790
You clicked on the photo app and you scrolled through his photos

948
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.110
she had sent them and then what?

949
00:55:24.111 --> 00:55:26.480
You send them to your phone and jerked off to it later.

950
00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:32.660
I'm probably being too hard on you.
All right.
Shock to see it.

951
00:55:32.661 --> 00:55:36.770
I dug further and read the texts between them.
Oh Jesus.

952
00:55:36.771 --> 00:55:39.950
You would just failing yourself,
weren't ya?
Um,

953
00:55:39.951 --> 00:55:42.950
I love what you just not fucking doing anything wrong either.

954
00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:45.530
The next thing know I was,
I couldn't believe it.

955
00:55:45.531 --> 00:55:50.480
So now I'm looking at his tax record and it's fucking social security number.
Uh,

956
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:52.130
anyways,
all right.
Shocked to see them.

957
00:55:52.131 --> 00:55:57.131
I dug further and read the texts between them saying how much she loves him and

958
00:55:57.141 --> 00:55:59.150
she wished they could fuck all day.

959
00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:04.580
And it made me so sick to my stomach that I went into his tax records.

960
00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:08.330
I'm sorry.
She's the nicest girl I ever met in my life.

961
00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.890
And I look at her as a sister,

962
00:56:09.891 --> 00:56:14.180
but now I see how bad she's been fucking a kid over.

963
00:56:14.181 --> 00:56:18.050
That's like my brother with his best friend and I have no idea what to do.

964
00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:23.540
He trusts them both so much that he had no problem with them going alone to

965
00:56:23.541 --> 00:56:28.460
green bay for a football game.
Oh my God.

966
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.101
Ah,
Jesus.

967
00:56:31.101 --> 00:56:33.740
And they probably fucked on one of the top of one of those cheese had thinks,

968
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:38.580
you know,
she'd been herself over it,
you know.
Goodness.

969
00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:43.160
Uh,
now when I hang out with them from here on out,

970
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:45.710
how could I act normal when I know what's going on?

971
00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:47.930
It would destroy my buddy if I told him.

972
00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:52.430
If I tell them not only would I lose the friend I have

973
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:58.620
wait,
if I tell him not only what I lose,
the friends I have,
but this girl,

974
00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:03.000
this is a girl he lives with would do anything we'll do anything for and it's

975
00:57:03.001 --> 00:57:07.010
going to get engaged to her eventually.

978
00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:18.360
What kind of a fucking friend of you going to get married?
Man.
Jeez.

979
00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:21.330
No,

This is what you gotta do.

980
00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:25.380
You gotta go out with the other two,

981
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:29.220

984
00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:38.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

986
00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.290

987
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:46.150
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

988
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:47.380
<v 0>you can't just break it off.</v>

989
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:49.690
You have to fucking tell him cause you're not going to break it out.

990
00:57:49.691 --> 00:57:53.350
If you're going to break it off and you're going to start fucking again or you

991
00:57:53.351 --> 00:57:56.500
lady are going to go fuck somebody else because you don't love this guy,

992
00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:01.240
just go tell him and break up with them and get on with your life.
All right?

993
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:04.270
And just say,
I'm not judging either one of you,

994
00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:07.510
but you know what the fuck do you want from me?

995
00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:09.940
And you had to know that if you're going to do something like this,

996
00:58:09.941 --> 00:58:13.030
eventually this was something like this was going to happen.
So there you go.

997
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:17.530
Good luck with that guys.
I'll be over here reading the cheeseburger.

998
00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:21.550
He just fucking remove yourself from it.
All right.

999
00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:25.440
And just to add,
I would say,

1000
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:28.700
you have until the end of the fucking weekend to tell him or I'm going to sit

1001
00:58:28.701 --> 00:58:32.160
him down and tell him,
all right,
that's it.

1002
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:35.560
I didn't create this fucking situation.
Uh,

1003
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:40.230
the situation is what the fuck it is because of your Dick and your pussy.
Uh,

1004
00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:44.700
maybe not in that order.
Maybe in that aura,
what are you going to do?

1005
00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:49.350
And I would just fucking walk away.
And uh,
you know,
and I,
and I wouldn't judge,

1006
00:58:49.351 --> 00:58:51.500
he's the one of you guys sound like you're young.
I have no idea.

1007
00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:54.270
God knows I made plenty of fucking mistakes in my life in that area.

1008
00:58:54.271 --> 00:58:56.850
So I was like,
fuck you going to do okay?
They fucked up.

1009
00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:01.530
They fucked up and they just got to come clean and you let the shit fall where

1010
00:59:01.531 --> 00:59:04.170
it may,
I think what's his face,
Jim Croce.

1011
00:59:04.171 --> 00:59:08.010
He's got a bunch of songs that your buddy could listen to.
You know,

1012
00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:14.110
she's living in La with my best old best friend Ray,

1013
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:20.030
a guy that she knew that she said she knew well and sometimes,
hey,

1014
00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:24.280
did he,
isn't that the way?
That's what you should do.

1015
00:59:24.281 --> 00:59:27.610
You should be singing that in the background when they confess and he isn't dead

1016
00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.160
the way they say it goes,

1017
00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:34.350
well let's forget all that and give me the number.

1018
00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:35.830
You can't find it.

1019
00:59:35.831 --> 00:59:40.480
So I can call just to tell him I'm fine to show,

1020
00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:44.080
uh,
overcome the blow.
I learned the ticket.
Well,

1021
00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:46.210
I only wished my words good.

1022
00:59:46.211 --> 00:59:50.110
Just convinced myself that it just wasn't we you,

1023
00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:55.140
but that's not the way it feels.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Bill,

1024
00:59:55.141 --> 00:59:59.500
It all fucking saw.

1025
00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:04.100
Another sad song.
Sad Song by Jim Croce.

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:08.620
My wife and I are two months away from the birth of our first child.

1028
01:00:08.621 --> 01:00:10.570
That's fucking awesome.
Congratulations.

1029
01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.720
I want to hear your opinion on one of the names we have been favoring.

1030
01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:18.580
First name Birdie.

You're not naming a kid birdie.

1031
01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:23.370

1037
01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:45.210
Oh,

1039
01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:54.000
I imagine the DMV calling her name or a teacher calling her name and roll call.

1040
01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:54.930
What do you think?

You know what I think you don't name a kid birdie.

1047
01:01:14.391 --> 01:01:16.760
kid.
Why would you do that?

1048
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.110
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1049

boy named Ebeneezer boy name.
All right.

1140
01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:31.780
Meaning of Ebenezer Ebeneezer

1141
01:07:31.790 --> 01:07:33.960
is a name of a biblical place.

1142
01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:39.060
The stone set up by Samuel to mark his victory over the Philistines rather than

1143
01:07:39.061 --> 01:07:39.894
a person.

1144
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:44.900
It was adopted by the British puritans as a first name and then exported to

1145
01:07:44.911 --> 01:07:49.911
America where it had some early popularity entering the top 1000 in the 1880s

1146
01:07:51.301 --> 01:07:53.970
cheese.
I'll tell you,
1880s was a rough time to be born.

1147
01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:57.600
Not only fucking the scurvy and all that fucking horseshit

1148
01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:03.220

Ah,

1149
01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:06.940
you can just feel they're itchy clothes with those fucking names.
Can you?
Um,

1150
01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:09.050
all right.
I can babble with this shift forever.
All right.
