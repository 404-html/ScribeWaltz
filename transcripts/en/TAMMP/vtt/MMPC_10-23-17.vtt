1
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.950
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.150
It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.620
October 23rd,
2017 what's going on?

4
00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:15.030
How is,
yeah.
Um,
I am in Atlanta.

5
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:20.031
I am back in Atlanta to continue on my acting Gig on a rainy day here.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.190
Oh,
rainy days and Mondays.

7
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.820
Oh kid be down.

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.680
Who the fuck would write a song like that?
You know,
it's like,

9
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:33.600
isn't a world depressed enough?

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.250
Rainy days and Mondays always get you down or how do you feel on Tuesday when

11
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:41.880
it's partly cloudy?
You're miserable.
Cont you play in music.

12
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:43.980
Isn't your job supposed to be the cheer people up?

13
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.750
I should talk him at one time beck put out an album and I guess it was supposed

14
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:51.960
to be like some thing when he was going through a depression and then he had a

15
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.510
happier album and uh,

16
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.260
I bought them one where he was more depressed and I remember my wife was like,

17
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:01.980
well,
why would you buy that one?
I don't know,
cause I can relate.

18
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.740
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,
so I'm back here,

19
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.070
uh,
in Atlanta.

20
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.650
Just landed in this fucking rain and all of this shit.
And uh,
you know,

21
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:19.960
we were up there in the holding pattern and all that.

22
00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:22.180
It's going to be a little 25 minutes,
all that stuff.

23
00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:25.400
People all huffing and puffing and all I'm thinking is,
yeah,
dude,

24
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.970
take another 55 minutes.
Just don't fucking crash.

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.630
I don't care how long this takes.
Right.
So I get back to the hotel,

26
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:35.020
everything goes great.
Some of this guy fucking lands it.
Um,

27
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.040
I don't know how they do it.

28
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.590
It's fucking amazing that they're not freaking out or is it just like,

29
00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:41.830
I couldn't see anything out my window.
Um,

30
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.200
and uh,
I get back to the hotel room has got a fuck,
I got to do the podcast,

31
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.350
let me order a little bit of room service.
So I call up,
you know,

32
00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:55.180
get a little grilled cheese sandwich,
you know,
little Turkey BLT.
What do you got?

33
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:58.030
What you got on your lunchtime menu?
When I called the Guy Up,
right?

34
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.740
And he's like,
hello rum service.
And I said,
yeah,

35
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:03.640
I'd like to order some food to the Roman.
He goes,
Oh,

36
00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:06.940
I'm sorry we don't have any rooms.
City.
Like I forget who said it,

37
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:11.590
but he wouldn't like this happy tone.
Oh,
you know,

38
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:16.500
unfortunately we can't do that right now.
Oh,
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:19.710
That's what you said.
Oh,
I'm sorry.
We can't do that right now.
Oh yeah,

40
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:24.370
you don't sound sorry.
You sound kind of chipper.
Why don't you have an,

41
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.790
why don't you have the proper tone in your voice?

42
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.150
Could you at least pretend to sound a quarter as disappointed as I am right now

43
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.890
that I have to do my fucking podcast on an empty stomach.

44
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.930
This podcast is going to suck right now,

45
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:39.300
cause all I'm going to be thinking about is a grilled cheese sandwich that I'm

46
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:42.180
not eating.
All the sun just came out.

47
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:46.410
Here comes this dude.
The dude.
Do you know it's fucked up.

48
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.240
George Harrison wrote dad and he's dead.

49
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.830
I bet the rainy days in summer Mondays Guy,
he's still alive.

50
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.190
You know why?
Because God doesn't want to hang out with them.

51
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.960
It was just the George Harrison.
Here comes this guy.
Sounds all right.

52
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.580
I did a good job on this one.
Huh?

53
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.180
Must not have been sleepy and nodding off.

54
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:13.800
Like when I made the rainy days and Mondays content,
uh,

55
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.560
Jesus IOP kill somebody,
so I have a reason to send them down.
Well wait,
I'm God.

56
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.940
I can send them down there anyways.
You know what,
fucking cello.

57
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.180
Um,
anyways,
plowing ahead.
Uh,
back in Atlanta.

58
00:03:27.181 --> 00:03:30.300
Going to knock out a couple more days on this.
Uh,
what I'm telling you,
man,

59
00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:34.590
it's really looking like a great one film that I'm working on.
And uh,

60
00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:38.900
then I go back to go see my wife and my dawn is that my daughter went there,

61
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.390
get to go back,
hang out with them before,
uh,

62
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.400
the fuck am I doing this weekend.
Oh my God,

63
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.890
I'm doing the first ever all things.

podcast festival
in Phoenix,
Arizona.

65
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:57.700
Do they say podcast enough in that?
Um,
by the way,

66
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:01.990
I'm supposed to mention that bud light will be the official beer of the all

67
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:04.930
things comedy festival.
All right?

68
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:08.050
We got a little booze in there for Billy booze lists.

69
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.660
67 days,
a 67 days,

70
00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:15.130
67 days,
no boost.
When we taste,
I'm just,

71
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:19.270
because I'm not drinking doesn't mean you can't come to the all things,

72
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:24.070
comedy festival and Phoenix,
Arizona,
this,
uh,
Thursday,

73
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:25.240
Friday,

74
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.560
Saturday and listened to some of the best podcasts and then in the world and the

75
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:33.130
universe.
I'm going to go Donald Trump here while enjoying an ice cold bud light.

76
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.610
They go,
hey,
like that little fucking commercial there.
Um,

77
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.300
I'll be doing my podcasts for the first.

78
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.410
I don't know how I'm going to do it cause I'm going to do it just like I do
this.

79
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:43.290
So I just fucking lay down on a couch or a bed.

80
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.350
I feel at some point I do have to address the crowd.

81
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.110
I think the fact that I have no idea what the fuck is going to happen.

82
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.820
Like I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

83
00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:53.860
The crowd doesn't know what they're supposed to do.
I think,
uh,

84
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.700
something good's going to happen that that is my,

85
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.350
that is my prediction or something bad.
Well,
maybe it sucks,

86
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.730
but you know,
what is the Internet?

87
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.850
The Internet like better than something that's amazing.
Something that sucks.

88
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.870
So no matter what I feel like it's going to be a win.
Um,
anyway,

89
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:18.750
67 fucking God damn days,
no booze.
I feel great.
You know,

90
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.470
I look better.
I've lost weight,
you know,

91
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.380
my livers happy,
sure.
All of those things.
But I gotta tell you something.

92
00:05:27.381 --> 00:05:30.200
I really miss it.
I definitely miss it.
You know,

93
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.530
I had such a fucking amazing weekend played,
uh,

94
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.450
Austin City live.
The best sounding venue I've ever fucking been in.

95
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.480
The sound was,
was incredible.
They shoot Austin city limits there.

96
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.460
The sound was fucking incredible.
I worked with Dean del Ray.

97
00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:51.080
He murdered all weekend.
Um,
I recorded when I was there.

98
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.620
They were such pros.
They handed it to me.
They had all three sets.

99
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.210
Are All of them already mixed?

100
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.300
And also in what you guys said something about pro tools,

101
00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:03.470
like I could just hook it up into pro tools and switch the mixing adjust stuff

102
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:07.730
if I wanted to.
Um,
it was the most professional,
best sounding,

103
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.000
coolest fucking venue that I've played in the,
in the states.

104
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:14.830
I think it was unreal.

105
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.550
And they had all these fucking photos from back in the day,

106
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.320
all the way back to the first,
uh,

107
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.680
Willie Nelson was the first guest that they had in 1974,

108
00:06:23.681 --> 00:06:25.300
I believe this is their third venue,

109
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.080
but of course they had the Stevie Ray Vaughan one,
um,

110
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.150
the ill young,
just,
just everybody,
everybody played there.
And uh,

111
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.310
so that was incredible.
So anyways,
and then there was this place,

112
00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:42.530
Lambert's barbecue right around the corner,

113
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:47.030
which might've been the best barbecue I ever got.
Just not only the taste,

114
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.680
the quality of the meat.

115
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.510
I went there the first time and I got the pulled pork was fucking incredible.

116
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:56.930
I got to give these guys a shout out.
And then,
um,

117
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.120
I went back there again yesterday and one of the,
uh,
people that worked at the,

118
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:06.230
uh,
Austin City live goes,
I used to work there,
get the Ribeye.

119
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.660
And I got it.
It was,
it was,
I forget what they,
they,
they,
I don't know,

120
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.910
put it in coffee and something else was the rub and it was fucking outstanding.

121
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.620
Um,
incredible food and all that shit.

122
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:24.020
So anyways,
so I went out there,

123
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:28.940
I scheduled this weekend out there around the Formula One race.
Right?

124
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.090
That's all I was going to do.
I was going to go there,

125
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.300
play Austin City live and then go to the f one race and then that was it.

126
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:39.230
That was going to be my fucking make a wish weekend was going to be perfect.

127
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.680
However I get there and somebody tells me,
hey,

128
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:47.540
you know Jimmy Vaughan is playing um,

129
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.420
the fuck,
what's the name of the venue?
We just went there,

130
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:53.870
something sky something,
sky venue or something.
This little bar,

131
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:57.080
cool ass fucking bar was like,

132
00:07:57.081 --> 00:07:59.510
Jimmy Vaughan is going to be playing down there.
Uh,

133
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.530
I only had one show Saturday night.
You guys should go down and check them out.

134
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.440
Went down and checked them out.

135
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:06.410
Sat in a booth like five feet away from the stage.

136
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.960
So the Great Jimmy Vaughn had this unbelievable fucking keyboard player and

137
00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:14.600
drummer and I just got to watch them play a set.

138
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.770
It was this big CD album release party that they were having a,

139
00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:23.600
we got to meet him in between sets.
Could not have been nice,
nicer,
more generous,

140
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.810
which is really warm.
Great Guy.
And um,

141
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.240
I got to tell you,
man,
this,
there was this one ass hole in the crowd.

142
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.920
The more I go to like music shows like that,

143
00:08:34.921 --> 00:08:38.660
they always talk about how comedians get heckled.
Like we get heckled,
you know,

144
00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:41.780
cause most of the times we deserve it.
We say something that isn't funny.

145
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:45.470
Are we annoy somebody,
right.
This guy's up there.
He's,

146
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.640
he's playing music and he's killing it and it sounds great.

147
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.130
This asshole in the crowd
said some,

148
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.740
I don't want to fucking hear that shit.

149
00:08:55.741 --> 00:09:00.741
I want to loan like five feet away yelling at him like he hired him for his

150
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:04.530
private birthday party.
And uh,

151
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.100
I don't know how,
I don't know how Jimmy kept his composure.

152
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.520
I don't know how we did.
Like,
I,

153
00:09:10.521 --> 00:09:13.190
I couldn't believe it didn't smash the fucking guitar over his head.

154
00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:16.490
He just was like,
Nah man,
you know,
I'm up here and playing music.

155
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:22.180
This fucking loser who's never done shit with his life as far as I can tell.

156
00:09:22.221 --> 00:09:24.500
He's with some woman who literally falling down drunk,

157
00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:28.670
fell down drunk and he got her another fucking beer and these,
you know,

158
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.741
other than that,

159
00:09:30.741 --> 00:09:35.741
it was like this perfect evening and I just was as a performer was astounded the

160
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.280
classy way that he handled that guy.
Cause uh,
God knows I wouldn't have,

161
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.240
but um,
other than that asshole,

162
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.870
it was just this incredible night and me and dean would just sit in there like,

163
00:09:50.871 --> 00:09:53.510
you know,
a couple of kids could not believe that.

164
00:09:53.511 --> 00:09:55.850
We got to see him and it got to see him play.

165
00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:00.200
Like it was just classic old school musician,

166
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:05.210
you know,
we were out in the,
in the fucking parking lot and he just pulls up,

167
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.330
drove himself to the Gig,
you know,

168
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.650
just old school shit goes in,
walks up on stage,

169
00:10:12.651 --> 00:10:16.790
looked fucking great plugs in,
tunes up people.

170
00:10:16.791 --> 00:10:20.610
He acts tuning up his own guitar,
you know,
all of that shit.
People,
ed,

171
00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:24.980
Jim and he just started looking non whatever.
He's all tuned up,
walks off stage,

172
00:10:24.981 --> 00:10:28.940
comes back 10 minutes later and just proceeds to absolutely murdered for like 90

173
00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:33.500
minutes.
Right.
So like that wasn't great enough.
I would go,
dude,

174
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.930
you believe we're going to be seeing this guy and we're going to go to this race

175
00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:39.320
the next day.
So anyways,

176
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:44.450
we're with some of the people from Austin City live.
Then I go,
by the way,
I go,

177
00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:49.310
who's playing your,
your venue?
Uh,
who comes in their necks and they go,

178
00:10:49.311 --> 00:10:53.990
Primus,
I got when they go Sunday night,
I go get the fuck outta here.

179
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.050
I've never seen them.
All right.

180
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.350
Tim Alexander is one of my favorite fucking drummers of all time.

181
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.330
I got to see this guy live.
So I changed my fucking flight and they go,
hi ma'am,

182
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.880
we'll fucking hook you up.
And um,

183
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.240
<v 2>yeah,</v>

184
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.021
<v 1>we go to the race.</v>

185
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:12.750
I know this is probably annoying to a lot of you guys thought I've got to do all

186
00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:13.640
of this shit,
but I,

187
00:11:13.641 --> 00:11:18.641
I have to tell you what am I going to lie and act like I didn't have a great

188
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:18.800
week.

189
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.800
My source to tone down my joy because you're in a goddamned cubicle right now.

190
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:24.804
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.810
I'm sorry that I fucking humiliated myself for eight,

192
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.060
the first eight years of my standup career before I finally figured out how to

193
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:38.010
be funny it a,
that I'm a 25 year a overnight success.

194
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.810
Can I continue without pissing off too many of you?
I know.

195
00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:49.170
How the fucking,
uh,
I know the Internet is,

196
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.520
I know how it works.
We'll fuck you all right.
Just all this.

197
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:57.940
If I ever get sick,
I don't need to have a fucking make a wish because I already,

198
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.120
I lived at this weekend,
so we go to the God damn race.

199
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.650
Um,
and uh,
we sit,

200
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:09.850
we were sitting in turn 12 which was the fucking place to be.
You know,

201
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.770
the first race I went to up in Montreal,

202
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:15.730
I was on the start finish line and it was great to watch him go flying by and

203
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:18.430
170,
80 miles an hour,
but you could barely see them.

204
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.150
You want to be in the turns where they got,

205
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.770
they got to stomp on the breaks and that's where the race and happens.

206
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:28.090
That's where the passing happens.
Do we were there,
we saw a fucking,
uh,

207
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.740
Lewis Hamilton Past Matt Maxavenue staff and the two best drivers in the world

208
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.810
on the two best teams.
You know,

209
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.190
Mercedes in a Ferrari right in front of us.

210
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.670
And on that same fucking turn I think,
uh,

211
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.940
but both tests pass somebody.

212
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:50.240
We got to see Hamilton past somebody else after he had pitted and he had to try

213
00:12:50.241 --> 00:12:52.780
to get back into first place again.
We saw him pass again.

214
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.950
And then on the final lap we saw Max Verstappen go around Kimmy Raikkonen

215
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.790
readiness.
They would disappear.
And around the fucking was at 12,
13,
14,

216
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:05.500
15 and [inaudible] 16 we could see 12,
13,
14 and 16 turns.

217
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.440
And then up the hill you can see a turn one.

218
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.470
And then over to the left you could see like turn,
I don't know what it was,

219
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:15.690
five or six was ridiculous.
Um,

220
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.940
if you ever go there,
you've got to sit and turn 12th.
I'm telling you,

221
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.380
or somewhere around there,
you get to see all of,
like,
just get a map of,
of the,

222
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.330
uh,
of the,
uh,
of the track.
And from here on out,

223
00:13:28.331 --> 00:13:32.380
I don't give a fuck what race I go to.
I'm going to look and see which,

224
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:37.210
which turn has the sharpest fucking turned,
uh,
after a straight away or whatever.

225
00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:40.210
And that's where I'm sitting because we actually saw a little bit of an
accident,

226
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.990
I believe one of the,
uh,
the American teams,
the Haas car got spun out.

227
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:46.780
That was right in front of us.
And,
uh,

228
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:51.810
through Dean Delray was flipping the fuck out like three times during the race.

229
00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:53.050
During those passes,

230
00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:56.770
he fucking held up his forearm and he had goosebumps watching these guys

231
00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.140
slamming on the brakes going around each other.
You know,

232
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:01.900
he's a motorcycle fucking car freak.

233
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:07.480
He was losing his shit.
Um,
and he was,

234
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:11.830
he was so going nuts.
I was like laughing half of the time,
you know,
you know,

235
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:14.020
when you bring somebody to something you and you want to,

236
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.580
you want them to have a good time.

237
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.790
You're so afraid that they're going to look at you like you're into this shit,

238
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.110
dude,
I'm bored.
You know,

239
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.540
they're gonna need more fucking cheese and crackers for me to eat.

240
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.800
He was losing his mind freaking out.
So anyways,

241
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:28.840
as if the race wasn't good enough,

242
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.580
Max Verstappen is right on Kimmy Raycon's ass through 12,
13,
14,

243
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:37.810
15 the whole time and everybody is on their feet going fucking crazy.

244
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.240
And then at the last second is there going like up the hill.

245
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:44.010
He got around him and everybody was going nuts.
And um,

246
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:49.390
he ends up coming in third place.
He's on the podium.
Everything is great.
Uh,

247
00:14:49.391 --> 00:14:53.630
we get out of there.
Um,
oh,
I've forgotten the beginning of the race.

248
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.340
Uh,
when they did the whole,
uh,
Michael buffer did all the announcements,

249
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.540
which some,
some,
you know,
some race and fans didn't like,
you know,

250
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.350
cause they're all fucking snobby and shit.

251
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.850
I saw a couple of American fans apologize and if fuck you,
this is America.

252
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.590
<v 3>All right,
we overeat and we're loud.
All right.
If you don't like it,</v>

253
00:15:11.591 --> 00:15:13.690
don't have a fucking race here.
You asshole

254
00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:15.341
<v 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

255
00:15:15.341 --> 00:15:19.780
Do you get all upset when the fucking Italians cry every time a Ferrari's and

256
00:15:19.781 --> 00:15:21.220
first place for a lap

257
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.410
fucking stuck up cunt anyways.
And they actually,

258
00:15:26.411 --> 00:15:30.380
when they brought out Daniel Ricardo,
they actually,
uh,

259
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.020
oh fuck is this on right now?
All right,
sorry.

260
00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:38.620
Little technical technical difficulty there.
When they brought him out,
uh,
we'll,

261
00:15:38.621 --> 00:15:40.900
Buxton had wrote,
written all the,
uh,

262
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.540
the intros and when they brought out Danny Ricardo,

263
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.050
they fucking the dad Michael Buffer,
say Ricky rocket.

264
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:51.980
Remember when I couldn't remember the guys names and I was saying Rick,
uh,

265
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.360
Ricky Rican Berg and all of that shit.
Cause I,
you know,
so new to the sport.

266
00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:58.150
And one time I called Daniel Ricardo Rikki rocket,

267
00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.990
obviously knowing that that was the drummer from poison.
So,
uh,

268
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.140
he actually said that

269
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.710
fucking nuts is that.
So anyways,

270
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.400
at some point I got to get a picture with Ricky rocket and Daniel Ricardo.

271
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.280
See if that ever fucking happen.
Who knows,
who knows?

272
00:16:15.281 --> 00:16:17.710
Maybe Rikki rocket cares this shout out.
Next thing you know,

273
00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:22.570
he gets into the race,
he goes to fucking Austin.
He's also sitting in turned 12.

274
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.680
But Daniel,
Ricardo,
bi,
you know what,
it's,
it'd be Drazen at that point.

275
00:16:26.681 --> 00:16:29.710
It's never going to fucking happen.
Whatever.
So anyways,

276
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.610
this morning I wake up and I'm looking at the final,
you know,

277
00:16:33.611 --> 00:16:35.560
results and everything to see who won what.

278
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:41.070
And I noticed that all of a sudden Max Verstappen is down in fourth place and,

279
00:16:41.381 --> 00:16:45.640
uh,
there's all this whole fucking,
uh,
days of thunder,

280
00:16:45.641 --> 00:16:49.540
Ricky Bobby fucking controversy.
I guess he fucking went off on this.

281
00:16:49.541 --> 00:16:54.250
I guess this is racing steward who fucked him over in Japan,

282
00:16:54.251 --> 00:16:57.100
Mexico and now in Austin.
And he was so mad.

283
00:16:57.101 --> 00:17:01.750
He said he hoped that the fans don't show up in Austin next year.
It's this like,

284
00:17:01.751 --> 00:17:03.970
dude,
dude,
he's kind of fucking year around the globe.

285
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.880
There's no reason to single us out.
Right.

286
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:11.470
Did you not like your nickname and the fucking intros?
Sorry.
Um,

287
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:14.650
but anyways,
it was off.
It was a phenomenal race.

288
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.420
I'm actually blowing through so much of this shit.

289
00:17:16.421 --> 00:17:19.570
I should probably try and slow down here,
but I have to get to the next thing.

290
00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:22.890
So then we left there and then we went.
I,
my,
my wife,
better night,

291
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.910
listen to this podcast,
she's going to get annoyed with me.

292
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.720
Then we went back to the hotel,
dropped off our shit,

293
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.120
and uh,
we went back down over to the venue and we got to see,
uh,

294
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.920
we got to see Primus and they basically opened for themselves,

295
00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.090
played like for an hour and then took a half hour break and played it for

296
00:17:43.091 --> 00:17:47.830
another 90 minutes.
And um,
I gotta be honest with you,

297
00:17:47.831 --> 00:17:51.420
I am not a drug,
but I actually,

298
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:56.010
with all the video shit that they had going on in the host psychedelic vibe,

299
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.370
oh,
by the way,
another heckler at that show,
like Larry's one of his pedals,

300
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:05.310
if something wasn't working,
you know,

301
00:18:05.311 --> 00:18:09.780
so less is talking to the crowd talking about,
he's actually talking about that.

302
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.930
What does that blue,
you know those damn blue color tweak?
Ours isn't that rock.

303
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:19.530
That's how old town.
Yeah,
that's fucking song.

304
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.200
He was talking about how he came up with that tweakers I thought he was talking

305
00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:24.180
about Meth,
you know,

306
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.050
I didn't know it was about the water's being stolen from northern California.

307
00:18:28.051 --> 00:18:32.640
So he's sitting there talking about it because they're trying to fix Larry's

308
00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:36.530
pedals and this guy in the crowd goes,
stop fucking preaching.

309
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.320
Can you,
I,
I was beside myself.

310
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.510
I would think everybody in the crowd would just beat the shit out of me,

311
00:18:45.511 --> 00:18:49.170
but less once again to both of them just handled it like a pro.

312
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.580
He joked is way out of it.
He said something fucking hilarious about,
uh,

313
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.330
you know,
presenting any questions that you had,

314
00:18:57.331 --> 00:18:59.340
please present them in written form.

315
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:04.830
A true or false questions worked best for me.
I'm butchering it,

316
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:07.110
but it was like really funny to the point.

317
00:19:07.111 --> 00:19:10.050
I was actually kind of happy the guy heckled them cause you know,

318
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.960
les is fucking hilarious.
So,
um,

319
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.090
I finally got to see Tim Alexander play live.
His fucking kit is,

320
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:23.580
it's fucking,
eh,
he has like a double bass pedal on it,
like a 20 inch bass drum.

321
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.133
Um,

322
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.860
and they had all of this stuff going on in the background and I'm sitting there,

323
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:33.750
you know,
trying to figure out,
uh,
you know,

324
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.520
what Tim is playing and all of that shit.
And,
uh,

325
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.160
after they open for themselves,
they took a half hour break.

326
00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:43.620
Then they came out and they started playing all this stuff off to their new

327
00:19:43.621 --> 00:19:48.390
album.
I hope I say this right.
Desaturating seven.
Um,

328
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.200
and they had all this video stuff going on and actually looked over a dean at

329
00:19:52.201 --> 00:19:53.034
one point,

330
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.570
I believe when they had elephants jumping on trampolines.

331
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.753
<v 2>And</v>

332
00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.900
<v 1>in the way that the filter was on it,
it looked like,</v>

333
00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:09.240
was that really cool movie Vin vin diesel did where he couldn't see just how you

334
00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:10.074
would look?

335
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.950
I keep thinking Riddick Bowe I know it's not that that was a boxer.

336
00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.860
I forget what the,
I can never remember the name of the movie,

337
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:22.510
but it was like sorta in that sort of filter and it was an elephant jumping up

338
00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:24.910
and down on a trampoline and then it became three.

339
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.610
And then one of them started doing somersaults.

340
00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.600
And what I've loved when it came down,
like the trunk would like,
uh,

341
00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:37.840
we'd be like fluttering in the wind is it came down and I literally looked over

342
00:20:37.841 --> 00:20:40.870
at dean.
I go,
you know what?
I've never had to stop before,

343
00:20:40.871 --> 00:20:45.760
but I really wish I was on drugs right now.
I'm not a drug guy.
You know,

344
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.740
our,
I've stayed away from,
you know,

345
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.950
I smoke weed every once in a while,

346
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.870
usually when I'm not drinking because I'm so fucking bored.

347
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:02.320
I don't know how straight edge people do it.
I really don't.
Um,

348
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:07.030
but I pretty much stayed away from all of like the evil drugs other than
alcohol.

349
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.410
I think alcohol is an evil drug.
It's an angry drunk,
like,
you know what I mean?

350
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.550
Like weed is cool,
mushrooms are cool,

351
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:20.240
but like coke is evil,
alcohols evil.
Um,

352
00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.370
I dunno.
I feel like the shit that just makes you kind of sit around,

353
00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.740
you can't really do anything.
Just giggling it yourself,
you know?

354
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.350
I don't know why anybody would like,
just choose
to,
uh,

355
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:34.970
stay in the dark side.
I don't know.

356
00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.670
Maybe you just a fucking dark human being in your relate to it,

357
00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:40.810
but you'd think he'd want to go the opposite way.
I don't fucking know.
But,
um,

358
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.320
I've never taken mushrooms or anything like that,
but,
um,

359
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.620
I dunno,
that was the first time I was just like,
you know,
I wouldn't mind,

360
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.880
I wouldn't have minded being in like an altered state throughout this if I could

361
00:21:57.181 --> 00:22:00.340
have just given myself.
I just always worry that I would,
I would freak out.

362
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.750
That's why I never,
you know,
like my generation always,
they were always like,
uh,

363
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:06.550
you know,

364
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.910
they had the old thing telling you stories about people took LSD and they pulled

365
00:22:09.911 --> 00:22:13.120
their eyeballs out and fucking jump.
I mean,
I would never fuck with LSD either,

366
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.570
but like,
uh,
I dunno
was actually going like,
you know,

367
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.170
I think,
uh,
this would have been one of those times.
I mean,

368
00:22:22.171 --> 00:22:26.340
if I just did mushrooms once every 49 years,
I mean,
it's like,

369
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.730
be like Haley's comet,
you know,
sorta.

370
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.220
I don't fucking though.
All I know was they were unbelievable.
And,
uh,

371
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.970
I can't even,
I don't even know,
which was my favorite.
I think it was,
uh,

372
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.400
southbound,
uh,
packet Durham is probably my favorite.

373
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.030
It was just an unbelievable fell off.

374
00:22:49.031 --> 00:22:52.780
The whole night was just fucking incredible.
And that was my weekend.

375
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:58.830
I got to do three shows at Austin City live the best venue as far as sound I've

376
00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:01.690
ever performed in,
I think.

377
00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:04.840
Got to see Jimmy Vaughan in this small little bar.

378
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.190
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

379
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:10.210
<v 1>like doing the world a favor.
He doesn't need to do that kid comes down,
right?</v>

380
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.530
And then I got this [inaudible] f one race and then I saw primus after that,

381
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.080
and then I come back to Atlanta to do a fucking movie to pretend to be somebody

382
00:23:24.131 --> 00:23:28.390
else.
I swear to God there's a piano waiting to fall on my fucking head.

383
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:29.890
At some point during this week,

384
00:23:29.891 --> 00:23:33.340
something's going to happen and actually you already did.

385
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.160
What am I going to talk to you about it with some other fucking bullshit,

386
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.100
getting some work done in the house in the workers came there and somebody said,

387
00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:43.450
hey,
the door to your house was open.
And I was like,
Oh fuck.

388
00:23:43.451 --> 00:23:46.940
Did somebody break into our house?
So I'm dealing with that.

389
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.550
But you know what?
That's what happens.

390
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.740
That is what happens when you have all this good stuff going on.

391
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.850
Something,
something happens,
you stubbed your fucking toe side,
you get audited,

392
00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:02.120
something's going to happen.
I don't fucking know.
So anyways,
uh,

393
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:06.770
doing all of this shit,
I missed pretty much all of,
uh,

394
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:10.310
the football and all of that crap.
Uh,
for this weekend.

395
00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:13.490
I do know that the Patriots beat the Falcons.
Um,

396
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.000
so that's cool for and to do,
we actually have a strong division.

397
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.240
Bill's a foreign to patriots of foreign to dolphins are foreign to jets or a

398
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:27.380
what are they?
The three and a what would that be?
He played six games.

399
00:24:27.381 --> 00:24:30.980
Three and three.
I Dunno,
I don't know what they are.
Um,

400
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.410
are there might be three and five cause I think we might've had a bye week.

401
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.700
I don't know what,
but uh,

402
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:41.120
the AFC east after all these years of being so fucking weak is actually a really

403
00:24:41.121 --> 00:24:44.870
competitive division.
That shit.
So that's pretty exciting.
And um,

404
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.010
I watched,
uh,
what did I watch?
My apologies,
by the way,

405
00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:52.610
my apologies to the fucking Houston Astros.
I love your uniforms.

406
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.570
I just have a watch baseball and so long I thought they still had those shitty

407
00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:01.580
once that Jeff Bagwell had to where you fucking uniforms are great.

408
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:05.840
And I got to give a shout out to sports illustrated.
Some guy,

409
00:25:05.841 --> 00:25:10.340
I was watching this pregame cause I watched game six and seven,
you know,

410
00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:11.420
when I was uh,

411
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.550
waiting to go on and I thought I was convinced cc Sabathia game seven.

412
00:25:16.551 --> 00:25:21.470
I thought the Yankees,
we're going to have that one.
Um,
but anyways,

413
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:25.180
they were talking about before like game seven,
that some guy,

414
00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:30.220
I don't know who wrote it in sports illustrated in 2014 the year they Astros'

415
00:25:30.381 --> 00:25:35.381
win 70 and 92 he put them on the cover of sports illustrated and said,

416
00:25:35.781 --> 00:25:37.010
uh,
you know,

417
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.540
please welcome your 2017 world series champions.

418
00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:47.170
He said that in 2014 when he was 70 and 92 are in the midst of being that he or

419
00:25:47.391 --> 00:25:48.380
she said that,
right.

420
00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.240
And then they come back from the story and the gay host and the sports program

421
00:25:53.241 --> 00:25:56.330
go there.
That was a pretty good prediction.
It's like pretty good.

422
00:25:56.331 --> 00:25:58.970
That's fucking unbelievable.
Look,

423
00:25:58.971 --> 00:26:01.670
anybody right now can look at the Yankees and go like,
Hey,
yeah,

424
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.200
I think they're going to win it next year.

425
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:05.990
Then when it the year after or sometime within the next three years,

426
00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.690
that is not a big prediction.
All right.

427
00:26:08.691 --> 00:26:12.050
They got all this young talent that they're fucking playing great.

428
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:16.250
They way over achieved as far as what the organization thought they were going

429
00:26:16.251 --> 00:26:19.640
to do this year.
They came one game away from the world series.

430
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.700
Anybody can say that these guys are going to win another one.
You know,

431
00:26:22.701 --> 00:26:23.360
that's what I think.

432
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.280
I think they're gonna win another one here in the next few years.

433
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:30.820
But to fucking look at the Astros who've never fucking won in 2014 and then pick

434
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:35.060
the year,
I think at the next three years,
blah blah blah.

435
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.880
That would have been great.
But to actually nail the year,

436
00:26:37.881 --> 00:26:41.540
I mean they haven't won yet,
but [inaudible] was a pretty good prediction.

437
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.760
I don't know if that,
the guy was a little jealous.
My nuts.

438
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.770
I'm trying not to talk all sports cause I know people are fucking get nuts with

439
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:54.060
that sometimes.
So let me fucking go.
Uh,
first of all,
why I'm,

440
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.500
I'm really cursing a lot.
I don't know why.

441
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:57.730
Probably because I was on a plane today and we suck when after I want,

442
00:26:57.731 --> 00:27:02.070
I've been on a plane,
but,
uh,
let's get back to drugs and booze.

443
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.400
All right.
Um,

444
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:12.240
this is what I realized.
I like,
I like getting fucked up.
I do.
I really enjoy it.

445
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.150
I like getting hammered or fucking,
you know,

446
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:19.380
every once in a mile smoking some weed.
I do.

447
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.610
And I'm not an addictive personality

448
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:29.460
as a cop show up to see what's under my bed right now.
Um,

449
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.750
I hope you guys could hear the siren in the background.

450
00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:36.080
I hope you didn't think I was alluding to the fact that I killed a hooker or

451
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:39.000
something was I was talking about drugs.
A Simon went by.

452
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.590
Sometimes this fucking thing doesn't pick it up.
Um,
anyways.

453
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:44.543
Uh,

454
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.920
so like now I have a drank or done anything for like 67 days and I could go for

455
00:27:52.111 --> 00:27:57.030
the rest of my life.
I could do it,
but it's just,
it's so,

456
00:27:57.031 --> 00:28:00.890
it's like really a,
I don't know.
It's boring.
I don't know how,

457
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:05.490
like I have to commend everybody
who chuck,

458
00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:10.000
who gets into a program and just fucking does that.

459
00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.710
I don't know how you do it,
but it's,
it's,
it's amazing.

460
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.340
And I feel like in a way by me saying how fucking boring it is.

461
00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:23.170
I'm actually fucking with your sobriety,
so I apologize.
But,
um,

462
00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.560
do you guys been watching Bert Kreischer by the way?

463
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.190
Going sober for October and I believe Tom Segora,

464
00:28:30.191 --> 00:28:31.360
they always do like those battles,

465
00:28:31.361 --> 00:28:33.430
like losing weight and being sober and all that shit.

466
00:28:33.431 --> 00:28:37.120
And I think Joe Rogan is doing it too.
Um,

467
00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.980
so all I know about from the,

468
00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.290
what I know about the three of them November better getting the fetal position

469
00:28:44.291 --> 00:28:46.270
because I have a feeling they're going to come back strong.

470
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:50.730
<v 4>Okay.</v>

471
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:54.300
<v 1>I know.
Why am I think I am?
I Dunno.
I Dunno.</v>

472
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.830
I like losing the weight and that type of shit.
But,
uh,
I,
uh,

473
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.170
I think I'm going to be,
I want,
I would like to be more of a,

474
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:05.370
someone who two picks his battles when I drink.

475
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.800
You know,
like I got to tell you,
Austin is a hard place not to be drinking.
Like,

476
00:29:10.801 --> 00:29:15.570
um,
we uh,
we went to go see Jimmy Vaughan,

477
00:29:15.571 --> 00:29:19.320
like we was sitting at this table with some other people that knew Jimmy and

478
00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:22.750
they,
they were the nicest people ever.
And um,

479
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.660
a couple of them that were at the table,

480
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:30.180
we'll fucking just doing shots and I swear to God they did like three shots in

481
00:29:30.181 --> 00:29:35.181
an hour and these people could drink because they were just totally like fine.

482
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.160
And um,

483
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.060
I would be lying to you if I looking at them drinking,
going,
God damn it,

484
00:29:43.061 --> 00:29:44.470
I would kill for one of those right now.

485
00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:46.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

486
00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.750
<v 1>I was trying to rationalize it.
Like what if I just did one,</v>

487
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.700
and this is the weird thing about me.
If I am,
I'm a habit guy,
so I don't know,

488
00:29:53.701 --> 00:29:58.260
like a chemical person.
I don't think so.
But if I just do that one,

489
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:04.730
how I work is I immediately have to order a water after that and let the buzz

490
00:30:06.711 --> 00:30:11.670
start to fade.
All right.
Cause if I don't,
then I'm going to get another,

491
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.500
then I'm going to going to get another.
But I,

492
00:30:13.501 --> 00:30:16.560
I got this weird thing with the water.
It,
it fucking,

493
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.530
it's almost like I threw it at my face and I wake up going like,
all right dude,

494
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.340
settle down,
settle down.
But if I don't do that,
um,

495
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.590
I definitely put a dent in a bottle.
But uh,

496
00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.660
I dunno,
last night man at that prime a show,

497
00:30:32.661 --> 00:30:36.320
I'm not blaming Primus here when I fucking go off the wagon,

498
00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.110
but I was just like,
you know,
what

499
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:45.940
am I going to try mushrooms?
The fuck is who tries mushrooms for the first time.

500
00:30:45.941 --> 00:30:48.160
It's 49 just had a kid.

501
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.580
I can't have that on my resume.
Right.

502
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.760
Plus I also think the first time you do them,

503
00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.790
you should probably be in your house where you feel safe.

504
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:02.791
But I can't do that now cause I'm a dad and I don't think it would be smart to

505
00:31:03.041 --> 00:31:05.500
do it at a concert while I watched it,

506
00:31:05.501 --> 00:31:08.680
the fucking elephant doing somersaults on a trampoline.

507
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.340
I Dunno.
I'm just throwing this shit out here.

508
00:31:13.341 --> 00:31:15.760
If anybody has any suggestions how to walk that line.

509
00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.773
<v 4>MMM.</v>

510
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.310
<v 1>Anyways,
now that I've talked about recreational drugs here,</v>

511
00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.870
now those recreational,
I don't even know what I didn't know.

512
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.650
I just always say that word on the fucking news.

513
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.353

M.
T.
Uh,

583
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:16.200
it's how they spell it was founded on the belief that style shouldn't break the

584
00:36:16.201 --> 00:36:21.090
bank.
The watchmaker's goal is to change the way consumers think about fashion by

585
00:36:21.091 --> 00:36:24.930
offering high quality minimalist products at revolutionary prices.

586
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.340
The company started by two broke college kids that wanted to where stylists

587
00:36:29.341 --> 00:36:31.230
watches but couldn't afford them.

588
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:32.400
<v 2>Okay?</v>

589
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.250
<v 1>I never understood this.
They're broke and they started a watch company.</v>

590
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:40.350
How do you do that?
So they started their own watch company.
All right.

591
00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:45.210
How was dislike your,
how you started?
Well,
I was,
uh,

592
00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:46.920
I wasn't broke.

593
00:36:46.921 --> 00:36:50.130
I was living at home with my parents and I worked in a dental office.

594
00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:53.100
I paid off my fucking truck and when it died,

595
00:36:53.101 --> 00:36:55.260
I put a new engine in it rather than buying a new car.

596
00:36:55.261 --> 00:36:56.730
And then I paid off the fucking engine.

597
00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:01.110
And then I finally started making money off of,
uh,

598
00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.920
my standup gigs and I started banking that I paid off my student loans.

599
00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:09.360
And then I had an electrical fire in my truck burned down on the side off of

600
00:37:09.361 --> 00:37:14.140
route 24.
And then I said,
well fuck it,
I'm moving to New York anyways.

601
00:37:14.141 --> 00:37:19.030
And uh,
I don't need a car.
So I moved down there and I thought,
well,

602
00:37:19.031 --> 00:37:20.020
I've got to get a day job.

603
00:37:20.021 --> 00:37:23.200
And then got a couple of gigs and then my mindset went from,
you know,

604
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.170
I got to get a day job too.
I got to get more gigs.

605
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:28.400
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

606
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.950
<v 1>I took buses and trains and shit like that.</v>

607
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.220
<v 2>Okay.</v>

608
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.970
<v 1>It's sucked in it.
I don't know.
Eventually I started making money 20 years later.</v>

609
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.840
Did you guys really want me to take that big of a left turn during your read?

610
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.450
Cause you could tell me to talk about it.
I will.
Uh,

611
00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:45.060
it's a classic design quality construction style.

612
00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:48.780
Minimalism over 100 million watches sold in 160 countries and it was in Lee,

613
00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:52.770
Massachusetts and somebody threw a fucking dinner roll at me and it missed and

614
00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:55.800
they threw it so hard when it hit the back wall.
That actually scared me.

615
00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.200
And this is the thing,
it was a fresh roll too.
He threw it so hard.

616
00:38:01.201 --> 00:38:04.310
It sounded like it sounded like a stale role.
Movement.

617
00:38:04.311 --> 00:38:06.600
Watches start at just $95 one time.

618
00:38:06.601 --> 00:38:09.620
Somebody to dental floss at me when I was on stage,

619
00:38:09.621 --> 00:38:12.540
cause I was talking about working in a dental office at a department store,

620
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:17.260
you're looking at four to 500 bucks,
uh,

621
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:21.290
get 15% off today with free shipping and free returns by going to move on.

622
00:38:21.291 --> 00:38:22.490
I used to work for free.

623
00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.060
And then I moved out to Oregon for gas money by going to [inaudible] dot com

624
00:38:26.061 --> 00:38:30.050
slash [inaudible] this watch has a really clean design that makes a great

625
00:38:30.051 --> 00:38:34.010
fashion statement.
Now is the time to step up.
Your watch can't go to movement.

626
00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:38.830
watches.com burr joined the movement.
Um,
by the way,

627
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.850
Tim Alexander's fucking drum kit was one of the coolest things I've ever seen.

628
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:45.660
He has like,

629
00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:52.080
he has like three rack toms and then mixed in with the rack toms on like a rack

630
00:38:52.361 --> 00:38:56.160
above it.
He has like these octa bonds,
like three different octa bonds.

631
00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:01.500
Then he has like these like splash symbols on one side.

632
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.060
He's got like the rack dude.
I'm a drum geek,

633
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:09.150
so I was videoing the drum kit watching all of this stuff do one of the most

634
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:10.870
fluid fucking players.

635
00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.650
Do you know he was the player that actually got me out of my John Bond initially

636
00:39:14.651 --> 00:39:19.651
got me out of the John Bonham like death spiral and I was like,

637
00:39:20.471 --> 00:39:23.470
I have,
all I'm doing is listening to John Bonam.
This isn't good.

638
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.260
I'm never going to sound like I'm never going to play like him.

639
00:39:26.261 --> 00:39:30.580
I need to listen to other people and the double bass guys,
so many of them,

640
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.670
like what they were playing.
I just couldn't hear a groove.

641
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.640
And then he came along.

642
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.500
And the way he applies the double bass when he puts it in.

643
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:47.070
And what I love about his playing is how fluid it is in the space that he has,

644
00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:51.610
um,
and just grooves as his ass off.

645
00:39:51.611 --> 00:39:54.880
I can't believe I finally got to sign s psalm to got to see him.

646
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:59.190
It was just amazing.

All right,
where are we here?

666
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.740
Let's get to some of the questions here for this week.

667
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:10.820
All right.
You're not gonna believe this.
I accidentally hit stop.

668
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.680
So then I had to press record again and somehow I hit stop again without

669
00:41:15.681 --> 00:41:19.670
realizing it and I just talked for 40 fucking minutes.
Then nobody heard.

670
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.360
All right,
let me start this over again with your questions here.
All right.

671
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:27.110
I'll try to act like I'm still excited that I'm not fucking starving.

672
00:41:27.111 --> 00:41:30.360
Do you hear that?
That's my stomach growling.
Alright,
Robert Plant,
everybody,

673
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:33.980
all freckles.
Just wanted to let you know.

674
00:41:33.981 --> 00:41:37.220
Robert Plant was interviewed on the Howard Stern show on Tuesday.

675
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:41.390
He goes through his whole career and up to the present because he has a new

676
00:41:41.391 --> 00:41:45.800
album coming out.
Incredible interview.
Thought you might enjoy it.
Thank you.

677
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:49.080
And Go fuck yourself.
Ah,
I apps.
I have to hear this fucking interview.

678
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:53.130
The problem is,
is I only have Sirius satellite radio in my car.

679
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:57.630
My car's in Los Angeles.
I'm in Atlanta.
Um,
Howard stern fans,

680
00:41:57.631 --> 00:42:00.840
please send me a link.
Let me know where I can see it.
Watch it.

681
00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:02.160
Whatever the fuck it goes on.

682
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:05.040
However you kids do it because I'm not going to be able to figure it out.

683
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:07.590
I have to listen to it.
I have to listen to them.

684
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:12.000
Go through the whole thing and joy and disaplain.

685
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.640
John Bonham dying,

686
00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.500
coming back within the mood and then what else?

687
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:21.090
They do a honey drippers the whole fucking thing.

688
00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:25.230
I can't wait to Plusnet.
You know,
when I was at the Austin City live,

689
00:42:25.231 --> 00:42:30.030
they had an incredible picture of him too.
Um,
you know,

690
00:42:30.031 --> 00:42:33.690
he's another guy,
you know,
just age naturally.
Now look at him.

691
00:42:33.691 --> 00:42:38.550
He looks fucking bad ass.
All the wrinkles on his face,
his face,

692
00:42:38.551 --> 00:42:41.430
he just looks at it.
Looks fucking amazing.
Um,

693
00:42:41.431 --> 00:42:46.350
I don't know why people would choose botox and all of that shit.
Um,

694
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:50.130
oh,
here's a great one.
38 year old bus driver makes college hoops team,

695
00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:55.080
uh,
Billy girl.
Did you see these,
uh,
this article on Barstool?

696
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.040
Sounds like someone,
uh,
you would commend on a job well done.

697
00:42:59.041 --> 00:43:02.400
You're always telling people it's never too late.
On the flip side,

698
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.200
what are the negatives here?
Does anyone lose out?
Um,
hey man,

699
00:43:07.201 --> 00:43:10.680
if you can't beat out a six foot,
eight,
380 pound,

700
00:43:10.681 --> 00:43:15.540
fucking 38 year old guy,
it's on Barstool sports,
which by the way is,

701
00:43:15.541 --> 00:43:16.370
you know,

702
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:20.610
that that's gotta be the best combination of being hilarious.

703
00:43:20.611 --> 00:43:25.580
And then also let you know what's going on in sports.
Um,
how,

704
00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:29.880
let's see,
this guy,
38 years old,
it's going to be 39 in November.
Okay?

705
00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:33.690
He's six feet eight and weighed 380 pounds.

706
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:37.910
He's 38 waist three 80 you know,

707
00:43:37.911 --> 00:43:39.860
it's funny to get through 380 pounds.

708
00:43:39.861 --> 00:43:42.350
All you have to do is just gain at 38 years of age.

709
00:43:42.351 --> 00:43:45.560
All you have to do is just gain 10 pounds a year.
You know,

710
00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:49.450
for the first,
like I don't know how many years,
people are like,
oh my God,

711
00:43:49.451 --> 00:43:54.160
the kids are May,
she ate it then all of a sudden,
right?
Yeah.
Nine years old,

712
00:43:54.161 --> 00:43:55.870
you're 90 pounds.
Like what the fuck?

713
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:57.100
<v 2>Okay.</v>

714
00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:01.020
<v 1>10 year,
120 a 200 and next,
you know,
three 80.
He just kept getting better.</v>

715
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.210
Like giant hasn't,
but you just keep eating.
Um,

716
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:08.590
you're asking me what is the downsize,
the downside.
Sorry,

717
00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:12.640
downsize.
We'll slip there.
What is the downside?

718
00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:17.710
Maybe is a blown out his achilles.
I,
man,

719
00:44:17.711 --> 00:44:21.010
I'll feel bad if somebody can't beat out of fucking soon to be 39 year old,

720
00:44:21.011 --> 00:44:25.510
380 pounds,
six foot eight guy.
You know what that division,

721
00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:30.280
whatever division that is,
that's amazing.
Good for him,
man.
Good Fam.

722
00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:34.110
You know what it is?
He said his basketball dream died and he's 38 years old,

723
00:44:34.111 --> 00:44:37.500
going to be 39.
It has two teenage kids.
It's like there's,
we get dream died.

724
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.980
You fucking had the kids man and you're a good dad.
I bet you.

725
00:44:40.981 --> 00:44:45.420
So you're just like,
oh,
I got to take whatever job I can get.
Um,
all right.

726
00:44:45.421 --> 00:44:49.840
The fall guy,
no,
sorry.
Brain activity after death.

727
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:56.280
Oh my God,
I can't believe I already did this.
I talked
I this,

728
00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:00.130
I hope I can do this justice again.
Brain activity at after death.
All right,

729
00:45:00.131 --> 00:45:02.800
let's,
let's reminisce about this one because I've already read it before.

730
00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.330
All right.
When I first recorded this but didn't realize I wasn't recording,

731
00:45:07.331 --> 00:45:11.230
let me check again to make sure this fucking thing is on.
Um,

732
00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.950
that freaked me out.
Brain activity after death and I was just like,

733
00:45:14.951 --> 00:45:19.420
cause in my will,
I'm going to get cremated.
So I'm like,
you know,
even still,

734
00:45:19.421 --> 00:45:20.950
if you have brain activity you have to death.

735
00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:25.420
I'd rather just get thrown in an oven to just finish off the rest of me.
Like,
ah,

736
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:28.570
it's over real quick.
As opposed to laying in a coffin,

737
00:45:28.571 --> 00:45:32.860
feeling worm's going into my ears.
Um,
dear Billy ripper.

738
00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:36.730
This article absolutely fucked me up.
Not only his death going to suck,

739
00:45:36.731 --> 00:45:41.020
but also I feel the need to know I filled the need down to make sure people

740
00:45:41.021 --> 00:45:45.320
don't talk shit about me as I'm dying or here let's get a pizza has,

741
00:45:45.321 --> 00:45:49.300
I'm about ready to checkout for good.
All right.
This freaked me out here.

742
00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:50.923
<v 2>MMM.</v>

743
00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:53.610
<v 1>All right.</v>

744
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:57.870
Scientists say your brain still works after death and you know when you're dead.

745
00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:00.510
Now.
I saw a thing a long time ago.

746
00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:01.770
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

747
00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:06.270
<v 1>Where this scientist was on TV with this religious guy who was talking about</v>

748
00:46:06.271 --> 00:46:10.530
people who died and then came back to life and then they talked about what they

749
00:46:10.531 --> 00:46:12.270
saw and what they heard and all that.

750
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.380
And it was all this fascinating stuff about watching people working on them and

751
00:46:16.381 --> 00:46:19.110
floating above the table and all of this type of shit.

752
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:24.240
And then the scientist guy just killed all of it by going like,
uh,

753
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:29.270
nothing has ever been dead and has been brought back to life.

754
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:33.960
What you're talking about here is people having a near death experience.

755
00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.260
Just because your heart stops,
it doesn't mean you're dead.

756
00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:42.150
Your brain is still working.
You can still,
and he basically was saying your,

757
00:46:42.151 --> 00:46:44.880
if your eyes are open,
you know you can still see some shit.

758
00:46:44.881 --> 00:46:47.940
We're not sure how much you still alive.

759
00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.360
It's not until your brain has no function.
That's the final,

760
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:55.950
the final part of it.
I remember reading when I read that book,
a perfect storm.

761
00:46:55.951 --> 00:46:57.090
They went through all of drowning.

762
00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.610
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

763
00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.640
<v 1>and how your brains sitting there firing all that,
that last bit of life,</v>

764
00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.210
all this brain activities go and try and get your heart going and it just

765
00:47:05.211 --> 00:47:08.180
doesn't happen.
And then that's it from the lack of oxygen.

766
00:47:08.181 --> 00:47:13.070
Then your brain dies last and then that's it.
But you don't like fucking live,

767
00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:16.860
I mean not dead.
You're not dead yet.
Right.
Anyways,

768
00:47:16.861 --> 00:47:20.000
scientists may be inching closer to answering one of the greatest mysteries of

769
00:47:20.001 --> 00:47:24.020
life.
What happens after you die according what is over?
You're doing?

770
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:27.470
Don't you hate those fucking websites where you skip past the advertising and

771
00:47:27.471 --> 00:47:32.050
you scroll down and then they show a t anyways,
fucking annoying.

772
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.320
Um,
according to researchers in New York,

773
00:47:35.321 --> 00:47:37.570
a person's brain is still active after death,

774
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:40.930
meaning in many cases they can be aware that they've passed away.

775
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.840
A team from New York University,
Lang Gone,

776
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:48.340
school of medicine has been studying patients who suffered cardiac arrest or a

777
00:47:48.341 --> 00:47:51.890
heart attack,
which stops their heart for a period of time.
Quote,

778
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:55.570
technically speaking,
that's how you get the time of death.

779
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:59.050
It's all based on the moment when the heart stops.
Yeah,
but you're not dead.

780
00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.290
You're not dead.
Your heart just stopped.

781
00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.800
That's why they can bring it back to life cause you still alive.

782
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.810
They just get the fucking thing going again.

783
00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.780
I learned all of this from one scientist.

784
00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:14.020
They'll describe watching doctors and nurses working.

785
00:48:14.021 --> 00:48:17.650
They'll describe having awareness of full conversations of visible with the
yeah,

786
00:48:17.651 --> 00:48:21.040
but should your ears didn't die.
If you scream in an air,

787
00:48:21.041 --> 00:48:25.000
it's still going to fucking vibrate cause it's still alive.

788
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:29.920
It's still working.
The heart stopped.
Um,
anyways,

789
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.530
they knew all this shit that they otherwise wouldn't have known what was going

790
00:48:34.531 --> 00:48:37.740
on.
Um,
according to Parnia,

791
00:48:37.741 --> 00:48:41.130
these recollections was then verify by the medical staff.
Yeah.

792
00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:45.870
This is all stupid.
Yeah.
Your cause you're not dead yet,
sir.
You're not dead.

793
00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:48.270
All right,
so just fucking let go of that.

794
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.070
I think you know what I think happens when you die.

795
00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:52.170
I think it's a beautiful experience.

796
00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:58.080
I think it's what my idea of what fucking mushrooms and a primus concert is

797
00:48:58.081 --> 00:49:02.760
like.
I think he's laying there.
I think you're totally relaxed.

798
00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.800
You let go all of the bullshit
and heal.

799
00:49:06.801 --> 00:49:10.920
If you're lucky enough after your heart stopped to kind of be aware of a little,

800
00:49:10.921 --> 00:49:12.270
to be aware that you're dying.

801
00:49:12.271 --> 00:49:17.271
I think it would be very humble experience and I would give thanks for the

802
00:49:19.471 --> 00:49:23.790
amazing life that I had and if there was nothing after it,
I would,

803
00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:24.470
I would be good.

804
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:29.470
But I would be fine with going into the ground and enriching the soil with my

805
00:49:32.521 --> 00:49:37.080
carcass.
I don't need to go anywhere.
After this.

806
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.940
I went to fucking,
I performed at Austin City live.

807
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:48.370
I then saw Jimmy Vaughn.
I then went to an f one race and then saw Primus,

808
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:54.670
I need to go to Heaven after that.
Fuck.
Are you talking about?
Um,

809
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:59.290
yeah.
I don't think it's this big fearful thing.
I don't think it is.

810
00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:02.350
I think it's somebody tortures you to death.
The torture is bad.

811
00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:05.230
That's the bad thing.
How you die.
He's bad.

812
00:50:05.231 --> 00:50:09.400
But I don't think the death that being dead is bad.
I think,

813
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:13.000
I think it would be fucking amazing.
I think it's going to be amazing.

814
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.470
Why would you think anything else?
You can't stop.

815
00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:20.860
It might as well look at it in a positive way.
I remember when,
um,

816
00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:26.890
who's that guy?
Uh,
Lou?

817
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:28.160
Jesus Christ.

818
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.120
<v 2>His only a legend.</v>

819
00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.390
<v 1>It was in that band that sang about fucking heroin.</v>

820
00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:39.180
Lou Reed.
I remember they said when he died,

821
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:45.390
this woman said she was looking at me and he had the most like amazed and like

822
00:50:45.391 --> 00:50:46.830
inquisitive look on his face.

823
00:50:46.831 --> 00:50:50.790
Like he was totally enjoying it and just taking in the fucking experience.

824
00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:54.690
That's how you want to go out.
You don't go,
oh,
Hey God,

825
00:50:54.691 --> 00:50:59.640
I'm sorry I'm doing all that shit.
Fuck that.
Don't fight it.

826
00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.960
Just give it to it.
What do you special?

827
00:51:03.961 --> 00:51:08.100
Are you going to keep fucking living like a vampire?
Uh,
the fall guy?

828
00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:12.750
Uh,
dear bill,
big red balls of fire.

829
00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:17.660
Um,
I don't have a question.
More of an observation on Harvey Weinstein,

830
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:19.200
the Harvey Weinstein situation.

831
00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:23.670
Harvey Weinstein is banned from the Oscars little elite club.

832
00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:28.890
It's not a little club.
It's a fucking,
it is a very elite club.

833
00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.290
And I could tell by,
uh,

834
00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:34.830
I already said this shit before I knew that this guy has issues with Hollywood.

835
00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:39.640
I believe,
you know my saying little elite club,
uh,

836
00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:43.230
the same club that Roman Polanski,
a pedophile who pled guilty.

837
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.800
He did not plead guilty to being a pedophile.
He,

838
00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:49.140
what he pled guilty to was improper behavior.

839
00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:51.810
That's what he was willing to plead guilty to.

840
00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:55.980
And then he ran and got the fuck out of the country because that's what innocent

841
00:51:55.981 --> 00:51:59.430
people do.
Although if I was brought up on those charges in another country,

842
00:51:59.431 --> 00:52:02.190
I probably would have got the fuck out of there too.
However,

843
00:52:02.191 --> 00:52:05.940
I would never be in a hot tub with a fucking 13 year old girl giving her booze

844
00:52:05.941 --> 00:52:09.490
or whatever the fuck was going on.
Um,

845
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:14.050
and Bryan singer who's been accused of molesting underage child stars and

846
00:52:14.051 --> 00:52:17.350
feeding them drugs are a part of,
uh,

847
00:52:17.351 --> 00:52:22.351
the big Hollywood elite club that the sick bastards want us to believe is

848
00:52:22.391 --> 00:52:26.620
honorable.
Um,
I dunno if anybody ever said it was honorable.

849
00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:31.480
Uh,
you sat on your previous podcast that this was one of the mo I guess say they

850
00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:34.090
try,
this is for film and honoree.
I,
maybe they do.

851
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:37.150
I don't pay attention to the shit.
I watch sports.
Uh,

852
00:52:37.151 --> 00:52:38.630
you start on your previous podcasts that,

853
00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:41.830
that this was one of the most disgusting God awful situation.

854
00:52:41.831 --> 00:52:46.650
Do you ever heard of the Weinstein thing?
Yeah.
Weinstein fucked up.
Sure.

855
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:48.140
<v 2>Cool.</v>

856
00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:50.900
<v 1>But so far none of his accusers were underage.</v>

857
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:54.920
I swear to God.
I know what you guys are thinking.
You're thinking what?

858
00:52:54.921 --> 00:52:56.090
I thought the first time I read this,

859
00:52:56.091 --> 00:53:00.470
this guy is not going to downplay what Weinstein did a,
you know,
he fucked up.

860
00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.210
They allegedly did.

861
00:53:02.211 --> 00:53:04.880
I guess I should still be saying alleging what'd he allegedly Dan,

862
00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:05.723
the guy fucked up.

863
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:10.310
A lot of them were aspiring stars who were willing to do anything for fame.

864
00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.620
Objection,
speculation.
Dude.

865
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:19.630
You're just creating this fucking argument because you have issues with

866
00:53:19.761 --> 00:53:24.590
Hollywood and their careers failed and now they're bitter.
So they,

867
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:26.270
yeah.
Okay.
All right.
This,

868
00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:30.630
you sound like the defense attorney for a Harvey Weinstein right now,
but no one,

869
00:53:30.631 --> 00:53:35.190
all in capital capital's mentions to pedophile pedophilia cases involving other

870
00:53:35.191 --> 00:53:39.870
tensile moguls,
uh,
cause it would completely ruin the industry.

871
00:53:39.871 --> 00:53:42.570
That's not true.
It's been mentioned.
People have said stuff like that.

872
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.730
They don't have evidence to bring charges.

873
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:46.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

874
00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.610
<v 1>Okay.
This is what happens to,
same reason why,</v>

875
00:53:49.611 --> 00:53:53.780
how are we YC probably won't go to jail like the level of fucking evidence that

876
00:53:53.781 --> 00:53:56.690
you need in order to bring charges.
Okay.

877
00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:01.160
It's a difficult fucking thing when you're dealing with people with that level

878
00:54:01.161 --> 00:54:04.940
of power,
trying to catch them in the act.
You know,

879
00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:08.030
how long did they know that these mafia dons are doing what they're doing?

880
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:12.350
How often did they know that these fucking oil companies and insurance companies

881
00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.230
and all of these people are Catholic Church and all these people?

882
00:54:15.231 --> 00:54:18.620
Do they have money?
They got money,
dude.
Okay,

883
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:23.210
so I don't know why you're just singling out Hollywood.

884
00:54:23.211 --> 00:54:25.440
What are your Fox News,
you know,

885
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:29.870
or CNN when they just single out fucking Trump for grabbing pussies.

886
00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:31.740
Um,

887
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:35.810
I don't understand you can you forget if you're going to fucking lay waste,

888
00:54:35.811 --> 00:54:40.130
you got to go straight across the board here.
Um,
anyways,
it's made this,

889
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:44.990
uh,
but okay,
watch this documentary.

890
00:54:44.991 --> 00:54:49.490
If you could find it called an open secret.
All right,

891
00:54:49.491 --> 00:54:52.130
well meaning what?
That I'm out in Hollywood.

892
00:54:52.131 --> 00:54:53.840
I don't know that this shit's going on.

893
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:59.720
I guess it means it's an open secret with the people that know those people.

894
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:03.890
This is a classic fucking guy who watches a God damn documentary.

895
00:55:03.891 --> 00:55:05.060
He's not a fucking lawyer.

896
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:08.690
He doesn't even know how to present his fucking argument.
It's all speculation

897
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:13.280
that are willing to do anything for fame.
Like where did you get that?

898
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:15.100
You just pulled that out of the year.

899
00:55:15.101 --> 00:55:17.240
You're asked to support your fucking argument here.

900
00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.660
I'm not saying this shit isn't going on,
but like a,
you know,

901
00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:26.330
there's all kinds of people that fly over to these third world countries

902
00:55:26.331 --> 00:55:31.220
evidentaly and are doing,
God knows what with under aged shit,
uh,
kids.

903
00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.760
So I don't know why you just singling this out.
I mean,

904
00:55:34.761 --> 00:55:35.600
if you're going to attack this,

905
00:55:35.601 --> 00:55:38.090
shouldn't you be against it straight across the fucking board?

906
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:41.570
Or maybe you're just saying this because the Weinstein thing came about.

907
00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:42.440
I don't know what you're doing.

908
00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:46.460
It's the fact that you're downplaying what Harvey Weinstein allegedly did.

909
00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:49.430
That's what's weird in me out here.
Anyways,

910
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:52.040
that documentary and open secret,

911
00:55:52.041 --> 00:55:55.160
it's made by the same director who made deliver us from evil,

912
00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:59.120
which is about the pedophilia in the Catholic church.

913
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.441
Well,

914
00:56:00.441 --> 00:56:05.441
this director is either fighting the good fight or picking low hanging fruit

915
00:56:05.961 --> 00:56:09.500
here.
That movie was released in theaters and got the,
for the most part,

916
00:56:09.501 --> 00:56:11.810
major distribution from film companies.

917
00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:16.400
But an open secret hasn't had a wide release in it's two years.

918
00:56:16.401 --> 00:56:20.390
That is premiered.
Yeah.
Why do you think,
why do you think,

919
00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:24.640
why don't you make a fucking documentary about how fucked the oil oil industry

920
00:56:24.641 --> 00:56:27.520
is and try to get the oil industry to put it out.
They're not going to,

921
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:30.820
they're not going to shoot themselves in the foot because at the end of the day,

922
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:34.720
money wins.
All right.
Same Way.

923
00:56:34.721 --> 00:56:38.140
Why the NFL acted like they didn't see that ray rice fucking thing.

924
00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:43.660
Um,
it's still unknown by a majority of the populous.

925
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:48.661
Weinstein is taking the shitstorm while the real monsters is saying,

926
00:56:49.631 --> 00:56:53.950
phew,
good thing we're not in the forefront.
It's bullshit.

927
00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:58.960
A,
okay.
I can't understand if you're saying Weinstein shouldn't be,

928
00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.990
he should be taking a shitstorm,
but not the whole shit storm.

929
00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:03.340
I think that's what you're trying to say here.

930
00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:07.600
Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood mentioned pedophilia is running rampant in

931
00:57:07.601 --> 00:57:11.990
Hollywood,
but no one gives that issue the time of day.
Um,

932
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.380
I would actually argue that they're trying to investigate it,

933
00:57:14.381 --> 00:57:19.381
but people have such high levels of power because what I've learned from the

934
00:57:19.601 --> 00:57:23.770
Harvey Weinstein thing,
when I listened to that disgusting tape of him saying,

935
00:57:23.771 --> 00:57:24.640
I'm used to this,

936
00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:29.620
knowing that that tape wasn't enough to arrest him is,

937
00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:34.240
uh,
I mean,
you're borderline have to catch somebody in the act

938
00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:39.290
when they have that level of money because then it becomes your word against

939
00:57:39.291 --> 00:57:43.790
their word and then they have money to tie it up forever in court.

940
00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:47.180
It's terrible.
Anyways,
RV is,

941
00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:51.230
is equivalent to a nerd who's dep desperate to get laid.

942
00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:57.510
All right,
dude,
I'm done with this fucking thing.
I'm done with this thing.

943
00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:04.320
You know what's funny cert in all of this,
you're going after these,

944
00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:07.350
so you feel that pedophiles should be punished.
I agree.

945
00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:12.150
But you feel that creeps like Harvey Weinstein or just are the equivalent to a

946
00:58:12.151 --> 00:58:13.710
nerd who's desperate to get laid.

947
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:15.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

948
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:19.000
<v 1>That's how you view alleged rape.
I mean,
I dunno.
I Dunno.</v>

949
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.980
I Dunno where you're going with that,
sir.
But,
uh,
you know,

950
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:28.220
you wrote a lot of words.
All right.
MILF question.
Hey Bill,
you fucking cunt.

951
00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:34.880
Um,
all right.
Guilty as charged.
You know what?
The guy who wrote that,

952
00:58:34.881 --> 00:58:36.800
Harvey Weinstein,
I think we were sitting down.

953
00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:40.400
Sometimes people writing isn't there the best way for them to communicate.

954
00:58:40.401 --> 00:58:43.820
Maybe if we sat down and we actually talked,

955
00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:49.130
I can understand what the fuck he was saying.
All right.
MILF question.
Hey Bill,

956
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:52.570
you fucking cunt.
I love your podcast and all your standups.

957
00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:56.330
F is for family is fucking great too.
Thank you.
Anyways,

958
00:58:56.331 --> 00:59:01.331
I need some advice on 24 and I work at a bar as a sound guy until I graduate,

959
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:04.550
which is this December.
Anyways,
last week,

960
00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:08.000
a beautiful redheaded woman who's about 40 starts to hit on me.

961
00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:12.120
I gave her my number and lately I've been texting her banging a MILF has been

962
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:16.700
always been on my bucket list.
I just,
that's just fucking gross to me.

963
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:18.920
I don't know why.
I just think that's fucking gross.

964
00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:22.030
<v 2>Why you have</v>

965
00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:26.200
<v 1>to bring up the fact that she's a mother and has a kid and you want to fucker is</v>

966
00:59:26.201 --> 00:59:29.200
just weird.
Why can't you just say she's hot?
However,

967
00:59:29.201 --> 00:59:33.460
this woman is starting to seem like she wants more than just a night or two of

968
00:59:33.461 --> 00:59:38.410
fucking,
she has a kid,
which I don't fucking want to deal with whatsoever.

969
00:59:38.411 --> 00:59:41.050
So here's my question.
How do I deal with this?

970
00:59:41.051 --> 00:59:44.260
You fucking why walk away,

971
00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:46.353
walk away.

972
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:50.230
And I understand that you're not understanding these red flags because you're 24

973
00:59:50.231 --> 00:59:53.800
years old and your deck is just running the situation.

974
00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:57.940
I'll read the rest as he goes.
I mean,
I want to hook up with her,

975
00:59:57.941 --> 01:00:01.780
but I don't really want a relationship with the 40 year old broad with the kid.

976
01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:06.250
We haven't done anything yet.
Great.
Great time to ask for help.
He said,

977
01:00:06.251 --> 01:00:10.270
but we're going on a date this Friday as always fuck your own face and go
Bruins.

978
01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.670
Um,
yeah dude.

979
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.520
<v 6>MMM.</v>

980
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:18.580
<v 1>I would walk away.
I wouldn't even go out with her.</v>

981
01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:21.790
I wouldn't even go out with her.
I would just walk the fuck away.

982
01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:24.903
<v 4>MMM.</v>

983
01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.300
<v 1>Because they'll tell you right now,
you know she wants a relationship.
All right?</v>

984
01:00:29.301 --> 01:00:32.730
So right now if you're just going to fuck her and then leave,
that's kind of bad.

985
01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:37.700
Be Bad.
Karma.
Not that I really believe in.
Well,
I kind of do,
but I thought,

986
01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:39.480
I don't know.
I've,

987
01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:42.440
I actually believe you have to believe in Karma for it to come back and get you.

988
01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:47.910
Um,
because in reality,
bad shit's going to happen anyways.

989
01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:49.410
Then you'd be like home.
That's my Karma.

990
01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:51.633
<v 4>MMM.</v>

991
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:54.110
<v 1>I would,
uh,
yeah,</v>

992
01:00:54.111 --> 01:00:58.010
I need a break that date off or I would tell her beforehand,

993
01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:01.430
which is going to piss her off and then she's not going to bang anyways.

994
01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.190
The time to have had that conversation in the future,
sir.

995
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.700
When you meet an older woman and they know what the fuck they want,
um,

996
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:10.890
when they hitting on you or whatever,
you just,

997
01:01:10.891 --> 01:01:13.590
just let him know you're single and you just trying to have fun.

998
01:01:13.591 --> 01:01:16.590
You're not trying to get into a relationship and you just throw that out there

999
01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:20.130
and if they still jump on the fucking hook parliament and the boat,
if not,

1000
01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:25.140
you got to catch and release,
catch and release.
All right.
Is that it?

1001
01:01:25.141 --> 01:01:28.310
Is that the podcast for this week?
God Damn it that I do enough frigging time.

1002
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:30.030
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1019

What about the fucking rams?
The Los Angeles Rams?

1020
01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:32.840
What would happen if they actually sold out that giant fucking stadium for a

1021
01:02:32.841 --> 01:02:36.620
regular season game?
Come on Los Angeles.
They're from there.

1022
01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:42.680
