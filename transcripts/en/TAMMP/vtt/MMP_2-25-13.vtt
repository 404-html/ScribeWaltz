00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.270
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill bird.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:08.900
February 25th,

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.380
2013 how's it going?
Um,
I'm still in Boston by,

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.680
my record is still fucked up so just bear with me.
There's can be one more week,

5
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:19.850
but I promise I plugged in my laptop so they won't be the fan sound this week.

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.500
At least I got rid of that.
Right.
It's a,
it's snowing out here.

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.090
I'm sitting in a hotel room.

8
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.750
I got the Oscars on in the background now cause I want him watch him.

9
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.350
Nia was just watching him.
I told you to go downstairs to the bar.
Well I do this.

10
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.620
Um,
I'd like to have her on the podcast,
but it's going to sound like shit.

11
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.330
Sounds like shit with one person.
Forget about too.
Um,

12
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.780
[inaudible] I dunno,
I dunno.
I just,
you know,

13
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:48.590
I was all psyched to do this stupid podcast and I had the sound down on the TV

14
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:52.670
and I saw Barbara Streisand and I was like,
Holy Shit.
Is she singing?

15
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.360
I know sheet notoriously has stage fright.
She doesn't like to do it.

16
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.930
So I turned it on and she was singing that song memories,

17
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.050
which is a whose kitten home.

18
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.750
It's one of the most depressing fucking songs you ever going to listen to.

19
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.940
Really just affected my mood.

20
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.743
<v 0>MMM.</v>

21
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.280
<v 1>Barbara,
if you're listening to this,</v>

22
00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:14.230
could you please stop singing that fucking song?

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.450
Mammaries where we all used to be young.

24
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.190
A lot of our dreams didn't happen and now we're gone.

25
00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:26.770
A die.
Right?

26
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.490
I fucking do not like sad songs like that.

27
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.110
I don't mind individual pain.
Oh,
speak in a songs.
Uh,
I read,
you know,

28
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.380
I've known about that Dude Bruno Mars for a while and I just,

29
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:43.230
I listened to a little bit of his ship,
but you know,
I'm an old man.

30
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.120
I can't relate to somebody singing about the prime of their life.
I mean,

31
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:51.460
I lived through the prime of my life,
at least I hope I did well.

32
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:54.090
Maybe I hope I didn't,
which means we get better at some point.

33
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:56.520
And that Barbara Streisand wouldn't be fucking bumming me out.

34
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.050
Their goddamn depressing songs.
What's it knowing?

35
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:03.660
She always sings it with the most sparkly fucking dress on.

36
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.560
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.600
<v 1>They should rename that song.
Put a gun in your mouth.</v>

38
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.640
Oh Jesus.
Look how old Richard Gere is now.
It's just,
I don't need this.

39
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:18.400
He just told me fucking Ernest Borgnine died,
which I didn't even know.

40
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.060
Half the people who are dying made movies when I was a kid now,

41
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.080
which means that fucking grim reaper a sickle is right on my ass.

42
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.490
I don't need to see that.
I don't need to see that.

43
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:35.260
Somebody who did something on Iti just died or some guy who made the fucking

44
00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:38.990
shark fin and jaws died.
Well I guess maybe I do.

45
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:43.340
That guy should get you should get is a,
he should get his due.
Right.

46
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.990
Did you guys hear me typing here?

47
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.310
I just remember I needed to talk about something that that guy should get his

48
00:02:49.311 --> 00:02:52.400
due without fuck.
You know,
without a doubt.
But I mean I,
I don't,

49
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.770
I just find it really depressing,
you know,
I don't know.

50
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.100
Anyways,
the hell

51
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.830
<v 0>am I talking about?
I'm,
I'm,
I'm hearing Boston and uh,</v>

52
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.380
oh,
this is going to be a rough one.
People,
this just gotta to be a rough one.

53
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:12.100
Once again,
once again talking into my fucking laptop.
This is bizarre to me.

54
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.920
Um,
a lot of my comfort zone there.
There I said it,
you know,

55
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:19.690
I haven't watched all the Oscars did they did,

56
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:24.160
did they do that stupid moment they do every year where they go movies?

57
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.890
Yeah.

58
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.840
<v 1>They allow us to dream bad Alice,
to look at life differently.</v>

59
00:03:30.841 --> 00:03:35.841
They allow us to see a future where things are bad tie.

60
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.260
They allow us not to have our balls sticking to our legs in the summertime.

61
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.330
If you don't have air conditioning,
it's great to go in the theater.

62
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.683
<v 0>MMM.</v>

63
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.170
<v 1>I actually didn't see a lot of the movies this year.</v>

64
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.930
Jesus look at the fucking ass on her.

65
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.493
<v 0>Uh,</v>

66
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.740
<v 1>anybody else?
Notice Nicole Kidman did too many of those,</v>

67
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:02.980
those shoulders shrug exercises with the fuck was going on with her.

68
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.950
She doesn't wear a cornerback just in the neck though.

69
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.170
Is that Palladia Palladia he's like,
ah,

70
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.430
that's one good thing that we got out of the acquisition,
didn't we?

71
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.360
As we got that little [inaudible] stretcher rack there,

72
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.980
how fucked up was the inquisition?
Huh?
Bunch of people going around torture.

73
00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:26.890
And your,
you say that you believed in the bearded baby,
you know,

74
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.140
is it any wonder why I left that religion?
Ah,

75
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.610
who's kitten home?
I didn't want to get up there that fucking early.
Um,
anyways,

76
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:40.570
I had,
I had a huge,
huge week before I really get going here.

77
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:42.410
I want to thank everybody who,
uh,

78
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.750
came out to the Patrice O'Neal benefit on Tuesday night.
Uh,

79
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.550
it was an unbelievable success and it was so great to finally send,

80
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.960
send them off the right way and I got to tell you,

81
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.720
everybody on the show was hilarious and I really felt that people stepped it up

82
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:05.290
and we're just going above and beyond.
Um,
um,

83
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.250
like Keith Robinson was the funniest I've ever seen him calling Quinn Jim

84
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.180
Norton,
Dave Attell,
everybody crushed.
Ian Edwards was,
was great just because,

85
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:17.200
uh,
you know,

86
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:21.100
he does a lot of writing and I think not enough people know what a phenomenal

87
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:25.420
comedian he is.
A rich foss hosted Bobby Kelly jumped on the grenade,

88
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.150
came out first.
We'll still vets.
Who else did I miss?
Somebody in there.

89
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.840
I probably missed somebody and they're going to get upset.
But,
um,

90
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.280
it was such a success.
Um,
I,
I'm not gonna I,

91
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.090
I hope that we get to do it again cause it was great to see all those guys and

92
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:47.680
everybody of course was backstage trash and everyone,
some people wore suits,

93
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:48.520
other people didn't.

94
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:52.680
So immediately there was a Hatfield's and Mccoy's going on in the green room.

95
00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:56.500
So everybody was getting trashed.
Norton took a nice pounding,

96
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.930
poor guy,
got himself in shape.
He thinks he's looking good,

97
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:02.780
but evidently he bought a suit when he was a little more pudgy or so.

98
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:07.460
Everyone was trashed him about that.
And,
uh,
you know,

99
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.290
I caught some shit from my big head,
you know,
the usual,
the usual sort of,
oh,

100
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:15.890
the tit for tat that went on backstage.
But,
um,

101
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.500
I want to thank everybody who came out.
Um,
it,

102
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.780
it really was an awesome night and,
uh,

103
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.840
I feel very thankful that all you guys who buy tickets came out and see people

104
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:31.070
about the posters and that type of thing.

105
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:33.470
And I'm really hoping that we can do it again at some point.

106
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:37.310
I have no idea when next year,
two years.
I have no idea.

107
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:41.730
But it was too fun to not at least consider maybe doing it again.
All right,

108
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.510
so they go all right.
Back to the podcast here.

109
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.770
I've already started this thing a couple of times.

110
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:50.540
I forget if I already brought this up,
but uh,

111
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.240
Tom Papa has joined the wonderful world of all things,

112
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:57.110
comedy podcast network that I started without magical.
Um,

113
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.100
he's going to be taping a new standup special and this free tickets available if

114
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:05.030
you're in the New York area,
he's going to be at the,
uh,
the Skirball.

115
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:08.570
Did I already do this?
I'd probably already did,
but I'm going to do it again.

116
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.740
Is that this curve ball on March 7th?
We'll put the link up there.

117
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:17.420
I don't remember.
Did I already do it?
I probably already did it.
Jesus Christ.

118
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.870
Anyways,
plowing.
Oh,
it's talking about singers.

119
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.990
So Bruno Mars was this guy that,
you know,

120
00:07:24.991 --> 00:07:28.080
I knew he was a talented kid or whatever,
but like I said,
you know,

121
00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:30.830
a lot of his songs,
it was spot being young and going out and partying.

122
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:35.160
And that whole being in your 20s and that type of thing.
And uh,
you know,

123
00:07:35.161 --> 00:07:36.480
but old bastard,
I mean,

124
00:07:36.481 --> 00:07:39.960
I think I'm closer to Neil Young's age that I am Bruno Mars.
But,
uh,

125
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.490
I dunno what I was doing.

126
00:07:41.491 --> 00:07:44.670
I was clicking and going through the Internet and I saw him sing on that show,

127
00:07:44.671 --> 00:07:48.510
the voice,
uh,
which had I known it was the voice,

128
00:07:48.511 --> 00:07:50.460
I wouldn't have watched it cause I don't like that show.

129
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.160
And like how they all sit there with it fucking backs to the singer and they're

130
00:07:56.161 --> 00:07:59.160
lazy boys and then they hit the button and they turn around and that's supposed

131
00:07:59.161 --> 00:08:01.560
to be like exciting for me as the viewer,
you know,

132
00:08:01.561 --> 00:08:03.390
like my life is that sad and pathetic.

133
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.970
Not Saying it's not sad and pathetic to get,
you know,

134
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.300
you got to do more than spin around in a fucking lazy boy to get me going.

135
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.500
All right.
But anyways,
he goes on that show,

136
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.120
sang this song when I was your man.
Absolutely fucking crushes it.

137
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.830
Watched it like 10 times.
So this whole week I'm up at the,
uh,

138
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:28.760
the Wilbur theater and I'm working with,
uh,
the sensation Joe to Rosa.

139
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.710
And I keep telling him about it and it keeps breaking my balls saying that I

140
00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:36.080
like this fucking teen idol and all that type of thing.

141
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:37.310
And I just wouldn't let it up.

142
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.120
And I finally made him sit down and watch it last night when we were hammered,

143
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.060
he got through it and then I took an unbelievable pounding,

144
00:08:44.061 --> 00:08:48.110
but from him and Nia that actually like it.
But you know what?
I stand by it.

145
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.480
I don't give a shit.
If you guys give me a rough,

146
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:53.600
do you know what I was excited about is the fact that there's,

147
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.150
does somebody young out there who actually just go out there with a piano player

148
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.530
and just sing?
You know,
those Djs that I,

149
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.230
I don't,
you know,
I've already talked about that on Conan.
I don't know.

150
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.890
I don't fucking get what's going on there.

151
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:10.503
<v 0>You know,</v>

152
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.930
<v 1>fucking Kanye West guy does a whole song,</v>

153
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.790
use a whole album using auto tune.
He can't even sing.

154
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.660
And even worse,
he goes out on fucking tour

155
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.600
and people are paid tickets to watch your guys single care fucking sing without

156
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:34.770
the cigarettes who like this iron lung or some shit and they're paying like 100

157
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.650
bucks to sit in the front row to watch subject,
can't even fucking sing.

158
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.020
It was just,
you know,

159
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:43.350
it made me feel good to see somebody just come out there and absolutely fucking

160
00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:47.460
crush it like that.
So,
um,
I've been joking with me as like,

161
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:49.650
I got to go see this dude life

162
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.420
and I have to bring you because it's going to be a bunch of fucking teenage

163
00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:56.700
girls and then my old ass is going to be standing there.

164
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.940
I've got to get arrested.
But uh,
I dunno.

165
00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:05.040
So that was a great thing to wow.
It's a great thing to see.
You know,

166
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:07.380
when you get old,
what happens is,

167
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.950
is shit changes and because you're grumpy,

168
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.250
you don't think anything's better.
Is this too fucking loud?

169
00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:18.270
Am I blowing myself out here?
I said,
Goddamn heart attack here in the mixer.

170
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.500
Um,
now when you get old like shit,

171
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:25.410
change assumption changes for the better,
you know,

172
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.540
hair transplants are way better.

173
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.300
Some medicine is better,
but a lot of other shits suffers.

174
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.850
Cars all look the same.

175
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.540
I guess they're better as far as the handling and safety and Shit,
but you know,

176
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.200
<v 0>okay,</v>

177
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.960
<v 1>sub shit was better.
People could send back in the day.</v>

178
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.560
So it's nice to see somebody that can,
all right,
Jesus Christ,

179
00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:48.610
you'd think I'm drunk here.

180
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.050
That's actually two positive things I had said in a row that never happens on

181
00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:53.884
this podcast.

182
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.233
<v 0>MMM.</v>

183
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.370
<v 1>All right.
You know what I'm,</v>

184
00:10:58.371 --> 00:11:03.371
I'm actually upset that I missed and happy that I missed was a women fighting in

185
00:11:04.661 --> 00:11:05.494
the UFC.

186
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:07.320
<v 0>Okay.</v>

187
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.820
<v 1>I just,
there's just something,
there's just something so wrong about that,</v>

188
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.913
<v 0>you know,</v>

189
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.270
<v 1>to be just sitting there taking fucking kicks to your womb.</v>

190
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

191
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.460
<v 1>I mean,
you're,
you're where you're supposed to be better than that.</v>

192
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.270
It's supposed to be able to solve your fucking problems,

193
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.190
you know,
by by,
I dunno,
pulling each other's hair.

194
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.370
I don't want to see some girl take a kick to her titties and ground and

195
00:11:36.371 --> 00:11:40.950
empowered and they're pretty faces that there really is to,

196
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.850
I dunno,
I don't want to get used to seeing that.

197
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.950
You know,
it's kind of like when you first start watching porn,

198
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:53.830
second girl bends over doggy style.
You're like,
Holy Shit,
that's,
you know,

199
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:57.220
it's incredible.
Then after wild doesn't do anything for you,

200
00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:59.950
you got to go to the next level.
I didn't want to do that with fighting.

201
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.380
I want to keep it like,
you know,

202
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.630
I can watch two guys beat the shit out of each other.

203
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:09.610
I really don't want to say to women kicked the shit out of each other.
So,

204
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.860
but on the other side,
I think it's a great thing
that women can fight like that.

205
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:19.360
I actually have a solution.
I might bring this up to rogue and if I,

206
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.550
if I get to do his podcast,
um,

207
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.700
or if I ever bring them on this one,

208
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:27.880
if I stop being so fucking lazy and actually have a guest every once in a while,

209
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.980
uh,
I have a solution.

210
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:33.850
I think that those were the women or the UFC rather than fighting each other.

211
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.230
They should fight a convicted rapist.
Right.
Just hear me out.

212
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:43.000
You take them out of out of the
and they don't know.

213
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.170
They don't know.
Wait.
Well that's weird.
Is that too much?

214
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.040
If they have to write this,

215
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:51.400
doesn't know that he's got to have a pay per view fight that he's going to be

216
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:53.830
involved in it.
Um,

217
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.240
I would ever give the rape as a fighting chance.
Here's a deal.
You go in there,

218
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.730
you fight the broad and I,
if you,
if,
if she wins,

219
00:13:03.731 --> 00:13:06.790
everyone's going to be happy.
If the rapist wins,
then what?

220
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.840
He gets to go free.
He can't let them go.
What does he get?

221
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:17.140
A couple of cartons of cigarettes.
Did you know how fucking,

222
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:19.480
how much of an asshole you'd have to be to route for the rapist?

223
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.440
Cause that's the fucked up thing.
Like Vegas would be then taking odds.

224
00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:28.410
So at some point
they would have to make just,

225
00:13:28.411 --> 00:13:31.740
you know,
cause money.
Vegas always wants money on both sides of the ball.

226
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.160
They would have to make it sell fucking enticing that he'd have to bet the

227
00:13:35.161 --> 00:13:40.161
rapist just so they could offset everybody who doesn't want to bet on our,

228
00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:44.100
on a rapist,
right?
Oh No.
I'll take it back to you on that one.

229
00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:48.300
I'll have to work that one out.
As far as how that would work out.

230
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.630
Did Anybody Watch it?
Can you send me some emails?
Cause I,

231
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.750
I really don't want to see that.
I,

232
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.690
I've seen it in boxing a couple of times and some girls just sort of jab the

233
00:13:57.691 --> 00:14:00.750
other,
thrown on us,
stiff jabs and just punches the girl.
Right.

234
00:14:00.751 --> 00:14:04.080
And one of her breasts,
and this is just something wrong about it.

235
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:08.723
<v 0>You know,</v>

236
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:14.260
<v 1>a low blow.
She had a baby man,
you know,
you can't,
it's just,</v>

237
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.533
<v 0>I dunno,</v>

238
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.610
<v 1>it was funny.
Some women actually get mad at them with their,</v>

239
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:26.611
their constant quest to be doing everything that men do and never really

240
00:14:26.851 --> 00:14:30.840
stepping back to consider whether what we're doing is stupid or not.

241
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.260
They just want to fucking do everything that we're doing so they could feel like

242
00:14:34.261 --> 00:14:38.060
that they are,
they are free.
Uh,
Charlie's Styron.

243
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.870
What do you think about that haircut at Wayne Gretzky in 1988,

244
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.950
she should be up there fucking accepting the heart trophy.

245
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.160
I,
you know,
it's funny

246
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.870
<v 0>though,
when she was on the,
uh,
the red carpet,
she said,</v>

247
00:14:56.871 --> 00:15:01.130
uh,
they asked her about her haircut and she said the same thing.

248
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:04.850
Every check says that has short hair.
She goes,
oh my God.
It's so freeing.

249
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.870
It's just,
it's just every woman should do it.
And I'm thinking like,
no,

250
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:12.860
they shouldn't.
For my own selfish reasons,
you know,

251
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.190
you don't need to get the EFL haircut that young and your life.

252
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.150
That's really what that is.
That base you and you get that haircut.

253
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:23.000
You're basically saying,
you know,

254
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:25.520
I don't care if my husband wants to fuck me or not.
We're,

255
00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.550
we're legally bound here.
I got enough years in.

256
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:34.190
By all means go fuck somebody else.
I really don't care.
Uh,

257
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:39.140
uh,
oh my God.
You know,
something like,

258
00:15:39.141 --> 00:15:40.420
I've noticed that was like in marriage,

259
00:15:40.421 --> 00:15:44.600
is that that's a moment in the marriage when the woman went,

260
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.680
I'm sure some people can send me some emails when your wife cuts off all of

261
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:53.240
beautiful hair.
All right.
Got It.
So easy.
I just wash and go,
you know?

262
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.100
Right.
Then when a woman gets a haircut that short,

263
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.130
it's like doggy style becomes a really weird position,

264
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.720
<v 1>you know,
depending on their hair color,
they can all of a sudden look like,</v>

265
00:16:09.721 --> 00:16:13.380
what are your friends?
You know?
All right,

266
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.110
I'm really going off from the women here.
I'm really putting you guys in a box.

267
00:16:16.111 --> 00:16:18.420
No Pun intended.
All right?

268
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:24.570
I don't think you should fight in the UFC unless you're fighting rapists.
Uh,
uh,

269
00:16:24.571 --> 00:16:29.100
I don't think that you should get the,
uh,
Mabel haircut until you're,

270
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:30.643
<v 0>I dunno.</v>

271
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.750
<v 1>That should be the menopause haircut,
hot flashes.</v>

272
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.290
I can't have my teenage hair anymore.
It's making my brow sweaty.

273
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.730
I think that that's when you should cut it off.
[inaudible]

274
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.100
they always do.
They always,
I don't know.

275
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.630
It doesn't always have to still fucking tease it in some way.
It's like,

276
00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:54.650
why don't you just,
just,
just part it on the fucking side.

277
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.250
If you just going to go out and go out and get like a Steve Carell haircut,

278
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.940
then you should call it like him.
Seek for all.
That's a bad,

279
00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:05.330
that's a bad reference.
Who has just a club,
a George Clooney.

280
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:11.600
You know Jesus Bill.
I get judged and enough people here or what?
Yeah,
I am.

329
00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:11.600
[inaudible].
That was pretty good rate.

330
00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:17.860
I got to admit I was reading that and watching a very excited Quintin Tarantino.

331
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.240
Sorry,
I leaned back.
Fuck,
I forget the microphone's right here.
Oh,

332
00:20:23.241 --> 00:20:24.530
it's going to be so uneven.

333
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.070
<v 0>Um,
the hell are we?</v>

334
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.220
<v 1>Oh,
Jesus.
I'm sorry guys.
This is,
this is even from me.</v>

335
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.120
This is a level of unprofessionalism,
um,

336
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.720
that I mentioned Tom Papa,
yet,
you know,

337
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.940
suck today.
Aside from the fact that it was doing that and knowing,
not raining,

338
00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:48.550
not snowing and blowing horizontally right in your face.

339
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.060
I really do not miss the winter,
by the way.
I do not miss this shit at all.

340
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:57.130
I'm going to go right back out to Los Angeles and breathe in that Nice warm smog

341
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:58.480
that I've really gotten accustomed to.

342
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:01.483
<v 0>MMM.</v>

343
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.270
<v 1>When we got here,
I,
you know,
the Bruins are on today and I have the,
uh,</v>

344
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.840
I have the,
whatever the center ice package,
whatever you call it,
on my computer.

345
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.180
And,
but because it was a local game,

346
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.220
it's blacked out on my computer and I'm in a hotel and they don't have ness.

347
00:21:16.221 --> 00:21:17.490
And so I didn't get to watch it,

348
00:21:17.491 --> 00:21:21.450
but I did see the clip of Aza Danal Charles Three ThreeSixty

349
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.990
backhand goal,
you know,
let's see.
John Scott do that.

350
00:21:27.991 --> 00:21:32.340
Buffalo fans.
Hey,
buffalo fence.
Did you see,
did you see what's his face said?

351
00:21:32.341 --> 00:21:34.200
John Scott shouldn't even be in the league.

352
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:39.640
I've literally sound like a school girl.
Even Jeremy Rolnick does it like,
um,

353
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:41.323
uh,

354
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.280
I can't wait till we played with the sabers again and I can't wait till we play

355
00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:48.960
the stupid Canadians.

356
00:21:48.961 --> 00:21:52.500
You know what I love about the Canadians is they're thrilled trying to walk

357
00:21:52.501 --> 00:21:56.610
around like they're the kings of the league.
I mean,

358
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.570
last time the Canadians won a Stanley Cup.

359
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.040
White people loved Oj Simpson.
Okay.

360
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.070
White people last time they want it.

361
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.810
It was a year before white people were like,
oh my God,

362
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.400
oh Jay is a monster.
You know,
and black people too,
but only amongst themselves.

363
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:22.170
They're not allowed to admit it to white people.
That's how long it's been.

364
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.320
And they still walk around.
Oh,

365
00:22:25.321 --> 00:22:29.790
it's so embarrassing when you go up to this stupid,
this stadium there,

366
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.140
right as you go in all they got all their Stanley Cups,
you know,

367
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.170
which I'm sure is a great idea when they built the place,

368
00:22:37.171 --> 00:22:39.990
cause they probably thought there's no fucking way we're going to go on,
uh,

369
00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:41.893
you know,

370
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.650
decade upon decade drought here because then I went in it this year,
you know,

371
00:22:46.651 --> 00:22:49.770
they're not,
and if,
you know,
if they want it this year,

372
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:51.743
<v 0>mmm.</v>

373
00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.440
<v 1>I'm actually going to lobby now,</v>

374
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.150
update if they straight up when I don't give a fuck.
But if I've,

375
00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.490
I haven't watched too many of the games,

376
00:22:58.491 --> 00:23:01.100
but if they're playing that trap defense,
like I heard,

377
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.353
<v 0>mmm.</v>

378
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.900
<v 1>Like that kid Canadians Rangers game where the,</v>

379
00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.370
the coach of the ranger said it was one of the worst hockey games he's ever
seen.

380
00:23:10.371 --> 00:23:11.600
Just completely boring.

381
00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:16.490
I don't understand for the life of me why the Nhl just doesn't make that an

382
00:23:16.491 --> 00:23:19.610
illegal defense.
If basketball,

383
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:23.600
the NBA is smart enough to be like,
listen guys,
a too big and too fast,

384
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.050
you've come up with the defense.
That is just far too effective.

385
00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.180
It's so cutting down the scoring.

386
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:33.740
It's affecting the entertainment value of the product.
That's an illegal defense.

387
00:23:33.741 --> 00:23:34.850
You can't do it anymore.

388
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.170
I don't know why they just haven't made the fucking thing illegal.

389
00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:45.110
It's the worst.
It's the fucking worst.

390
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:49.190
All you do is just sit there watching the other team just dumps it in the whole

391
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:50.960
game,
you know?

392
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.290
And the other team just sits there waiting for you to make a mistake.

393
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.810
It's,
it's literally,
it's like,
I don't know what it's like watching.
It's,

394
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.220
I can't even say a pitcher's duel cause a pitcher's duel is exciting watching.

395
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.570
If they're mowing people down,
there's still great plays.

396
00:24:08.571 --> 00:24:11.030
Be it made like exciting stops in the field.

397
00:24:11.031 --> 00:24:13.670
If you know somebody got a no hitter going,
that can be exciting.

398
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:18.290
No scoring and hockey,
I can't even say no scoring it.

399
00:24:18.291 --> 00:24:23.060
No rush is on the net.
You know,
I think that basic,
you know,

400
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:28.030
the forward should all be required.
I mean I guess,
you know,

401
00:24:28.031 --> 00:24:32.080
I guess I don't,
the trap is there they are for checking.
It's just too,

402
00:24:32.081 --> 00:24:33.490
it's too fucking effective.

403
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.170
I don't know who came up with it but is perfect.
I was actually,

404
00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.100
I'll give you a link to it for you guys.
The one hockey fans,
if you watch it,

405
00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.460
it's really phenomenal.
So,
uh,

406
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.190
it's just take two people just can't,

407
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:51.400
I was watching one youtube video and the guy was saying he had a system that

408
00:24:51.401 --> 00:24:53.410
could beat it,
but I don't think he does.

409
00:24:53.411 --> 00:24:55.150
There are so many in the NHL would be doing it.

410
00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.020
You know what I like to do people,

411
00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:04.000
I like to have a microphone that I lean away from talking about the most obscure

412
00:25:04.001 --> 00:25:07.960
of the top four sports and breaking down the defenses cause I feel that that's

413
00:25:07.961 --> 00:25:11.610
going to be,
that's to be interesting for the feds.
Uh,

414
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.080
all right,
let's,
let's,
let's get,

415
00:25:14.081 --> 00:25:18.340
let me at least for the love of God get to a goddamn letter here.
Uh,

416
00:25:18.341 --> 00:25:22.390
this is from Mexico.
All Law on Bray.

417
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.770
Sorry.
Now I'm,
first of all,
I'm a huge fan of yours from Mexico.

418
00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.860
If I was a newscaster,
I would've been,
first of all,

419
00:25:29.861 --> 00:25:33.700
I'm a huge fan of yours from Mexico.
Um,
I love you.
Stand up.

420
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.470
I love when you are at cone up.
Thank you very much.
[inaudible] thanks for,

421
00:25:37.471 --> 00:25:41.900
I'll keep it up.
Thank you.
All right.
That was it.

422
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:46.070
Oh,
that was the whole letter.
Oh,
I'm sorry.
I love you.
Stand up.

423
00:25:46.071 --> 00:25:50.270
I love when you are at Conan and recently,

424
00:25:50.271 --> 00:25:54.920
I love the boots.
You are rocking at your latest appearance.
So if possible,

425
00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:59.240
could you share what brand,
what brand are those are the fuck are they?

426
00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:02.900
You know what?
I have him.
Hang on a second.
I'll go get them.

427
00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:08.440
<v 0>I'll go get them for you.
Oh my God.
What a podcast.
Just amazing.</v>

428
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:10.743
They are

429
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:15.010
<v 1>with the shoes.
I gotta be honest with you.</v>

430
00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:20.650
Mi Amigo from Mexico.
Um,
I got these when I was in Stockholm,
Sweden.

431
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:22.570
I had to get something.

432
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:27.580
They are a Christ.
My fucking eyes are going.

433
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.450
I tell you that.
I tell you that my fucking eyesight's going,
you know,

434
00:26:32.451 --> 00:26:36.870
piss me off is always hanging out with the ob from the opiate.

435
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.480
Then he show and he asked me one day,
he goes,
dude,

436
00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.170
you have you or your eyes starting to go yet I got no,
my eyes are fine.
He goes,

437
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.040
he's like,
they will broke.
They,
well,
he's always doing that shit.

438
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:52.410
You shoulder hurt.
No,
no it doesn't,
but hey wait,
we wait.
You wait.

439
00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:54.360
It's gonna.
And I'm like,

440
00:26:54.361 --> 00:26:56.880
why does he think that all of his ailments are going to hit me?

441
00:26:56.881 --> 00:26:58.950
It's not an age thing.
It's how you lived your life.

442
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.300
You know we have two totally different bodies.

443
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.890
Why would you say that to me?

444
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.280
And the fucking son of a bitch was right about my eyes,

445
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.610
wasn't right about the shoulders.
All right.
They're called a

446
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.280
Rizzo.
See the Rizzo or piss off?

447
00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.730
I think it's Rizzo.
Rizz.
Oh,

448
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.200
I got him in Sweden though a couple of years ago and God knows they probably

449
00:27:27.661 --> 00:27:31.650
stopped making them because that's what they do,
right?
They start making clothes.

450
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.860
Everybody loves him and then they get rid of him.
They got to get some new ones.

451
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.640
Yeah,
these are,
you know what?

452
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.220
That's the sound of an almost empty 10 of bootleg.

453
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.410
Bootleg fucking eminence stinks to suck any wrong with them.

454
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:51.570
I can't stop eating it,
but they're disgusting.
Totally ripped off.
M.
And.

455
00:27:51.571 --> 00:27:56.080
M's,
they look just like them except they don't have the [inaudible].
All right.

456
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.650
This is from Ireland,
Ireland in the new world.

457
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:01.920
Order dare below for a bet,

458
00:28:01.921 --> 00:28:06.150
a huge fan of your podcast for years now and think your advice is pretty fucking

459
00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:08.910
great and thank you.
In fact,
listening to one of your podcasts,

460
00:28:08.911 --> 00:28:11.940
help me leave a shitty toxic relationship.
Look at this.

461
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.230
Oh Billy red faced south and people out and I've been lucky enough to meet a

462
00:28:16.231 --> 00:28:19.560
fantastic woman since.
Hey Buddy,
it couldn't be more happy for you.

463
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.900
Go to been happier for you anyways,
he says,
enough blowing smoke up your arse.

464
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.760
I love when people do that.

465
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:30.630
I didn't ask you to do it and I helped you out with the most important thing in

466
00:28:30.631 --> 00:28:33.420
your life,
so go fuck yourself.
Anyways,
he said,

467
00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:38.421
I'm from Ireland and that country is pretty much owned by the European banks now

468
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:43.680
and no longer a sovereign state essentially was taken down,
eat economically,

469
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.380
economically,
and everyone isn't dead.

470
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:52.400
Now I live in Britain and now they are voting on having secret courts and all

471
00:28:52.471 --> 00:28:54.990
kinds of terrifying or welly and shit

472
00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.870
secret courts.
Oh my God.

473
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.310
So it does seem we're skipping towards the new world order.

474
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.610
My question is on population reduction.

475
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.580
How do you think the new world order are going to going to take us all out?
Also,

476
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.610
when you say you understand why they want to do this,

477
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.710
what about the fact that they want

478
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.370
to turn who's left into slaves?

479
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.963
<v 3>Uh,</v>

480
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:30.640
<v 1>I don't condone it,
but I mean that is pretty much,
uh,</v>

481
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:36.310
the history of human beings.
You know,

482
00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:37.181
I mean,

483
00:29:37.181 --> 00:29:42.181
we're all unbelievably lucky to living right now as free people,

484
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:46.240
you know,
cause we really think about yourself.
What do you know?

485
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:51.190
What are you bringing to the table?
You know,
I don't know.

486
00:29:51.191 --> 00:29:55.240
I can't talk for you,
but I'm certainly not royalty.
I haven't invented anything.

487
00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:00.910
Uh,
so why shouldn't I be out there picking up heavy shipped for smart people?

488
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.740
That's probably one of the dumbest things I ever said,
but I,
I get,
I don't know,

489
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:10.450
I just,
I don't have any faith in human beings.
I just think that,
uh,

490
00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:13.430
there's a select few

491
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.200
<v 0>okay.</v>

492
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.130
<v 1>That are raw decent,
and I'm not including myself when I say that.</v>

493
00:30:19.131 --> 00:30:20.840
And I just don't feel that I'm,

494
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.290
I don't feel that people handle power.

495
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.810
They can't handle it.
You know,
that even goes for regular people,

496
00:30:30.811 --> 00:30:33.610
a lot of people shit on,
you know,
the rich,
uh,

497
00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:37.110
they're fucking assholes and they act like they're better people.
But I mean,
if,

498
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:39.710
if you just look it out,
what the people,

499
00:30:39.711 --> 00:30:42.990
what people do on the Internet when they just have the power of being anonymous,

500
00:30:42.991 --> 00:30:47.320
how fucking mean that they are.
And you know,
I know some people just trolling,

501
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:51.990
but a lot of people that just,
you know,
they're assholes.
They're like,
Holy Shit,

502
00:30:51.991 --> 00:30:54.240
I can say whatever I want and not get in trouble for it.

503
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.620
And they just immediately just say the mean is shit they can possibly say.

504
00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:00.570
You know,
I,
I think that

505
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.130
if you actually got a position of power where you could do something else,
you,

506
00:31:05.131 --> 00:31:09.030
you'd probably abuse that too.
So anyways,
how,

507
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:13.920
how do I think they're going to take us all out?
I don't know.
I uh,
cell phones,

508
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.420
cell phones,
it probably just cooking our brains.
I have no idea.

509
00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.830
I would think that they would do the usual shit divide

510
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.410
divide.
You,
you,
you basically

511
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.760
say that these people are better than these people.

512
00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:36.030
These people are out to get us,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.

513
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.293
<v 0>I Dunno,</v>

514
00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.600
<v 1>but you know,
it has to be done.</v>

515
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.100
People.

516
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.730
Do you think we're just going to keep having more and more people and eventually

517
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.100
the shit isn't going to hit the fan?

518
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.420
Do you honestly think the debt can be 7 billion people on the planet?

519
00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:00.540
We're not affecting the planet.
You know?

520
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:07.310
Imagine if there was 7 billion deer on this planet and for some fucked up reason

521
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.640
for like a four year period,
they all really got into roller blading.

522
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.830
Did I use this analogy yet?
I can't remember.

523
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:16.500
Let's just say they all really got into roller blading.

524
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:20.160
Then I have to four years it was considered gay and they all got,

525
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.360
they just throw out their roller blades,
throw them into the fucking ocean.

526
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.590
I mean,
it would just be open season on deer.

527
00:32:28.591 --> 00:32:31.200
They're like these fucking dare though.
Biggest assholes ever.

528
00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.673
<v 0>MMM.</v>

529
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:36.230
<v 1>Yeah.
We're out of control.</v>

530
00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:42.080
Brought control and a lot of tough are going to have to be made.
And uh,

531
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:45.650
I get,
I don't know what to tell you.

532
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.030
I find though,
I find it all funny though.
Um,

533
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.270
I've gotten beyond the scary scariness of it.

534
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:59.910
I got beyond the depression of it and uh,

535
00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.120
something's going to happen.
Look,
if they're not actually,

536
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:06.360
<v 2>look,</v>

537
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.900
<v 1>if somebody isn't out there trying to take over the whole world,</v>

538
00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.810
then humanity has been wiped off the planet.

539
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.930
There's always going to be somebody out there trying to do that shit.
But,
uh,

540
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.801
I don't know.

541
00:33:16.801 --> 00:33:21.150
I think if we keep fucking and having kids and all that type of Shit,

542
00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:25.290
uh,
I don't think we're going to have to worry about the new world order doing

543
00:33:25.291 --> 00:33:26.041
anything to us.

544
00:33:26.041 --> 00:33:30.880
I think mother nature will swiftly or slowly,
I dunno.

545
00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:35.130
Well,
I handle it.
There's only so many fish.
Yeah.

546
00:33:35.131 --> 00:33:39.630
You want to kill all of them there.
See how that works out.
You know,

547
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:45.150
melt the fucking ice caps.
Drown us.
Very easy.

548
00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.160
Very easy to get rid of us.

549
00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

550
00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.950
<v 1>Couple of storms.
Do I sound crazy?
Well,
maybe I am.</v>

551
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:57.330
And don't give a fuck a cheetah or at the Wilbur.

552
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.200
Um,
hey bill,
I saw,
uh,

553
00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.520
I was at your late show last night and four again into a buddy that had a great

554
00:34:05.521 --> 00:34:08.820
time.
All right.
Anyway,
about 20 to 30 minutes before the sensation,

555
00:34:08.821 --> 00:34:11.670
Joe de Rosa took the stage.
By the way,

556
00:34:11.671 --> 00:34:16.671
Joe Rose's taping his half hour comedy central presents right here in Boston on

557
00:34:17.401 --> 00:34:21.780
Tuesday night.
And uh,
comedy central.
They given out free tickets.

558
00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:24.270
So why don't you guys go down and support my boy.

559
00:34:24.271 --> 00:34:28.880
I'd really appreciate it if you're busy.
I understand.
A couple of years.

560
00:34:28.881 --> 00:34:32.130
Show up,
be a nice thing.
Um,
anyways,

561
00:34:32.131 --> 00:34:36.690
about 20 to 30 minutes before the sensation took the stage.
He was great.

562
00:34:36.691 --> 00:34:39.450
By the way.
I was sitting next to this fairly attractive woman

563
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:41.910
up in the mezzanine.

564
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:46.650
She took one look at this usher and you could tell her twat got wet and she

565
00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:47.484
wanted him.

566
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:49.280
<v 2>Okay,</v>

567
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.800
<v 1>Jason's still,
you were really paying attention to this.
Um,</v>

568
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
she started talking to him and hitting on him and eventually settling on a time

569
00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:02.360
and day to get together with them and they exchange phone numbers for about five

570
00:35:02.361 --> 00:35:04.340
minutes after this exchange.

571
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:09.760
I was admittedly a little jealous of this guy until the Lady's husband came and

572
00:35:09.831 --> 00:35:12.830
sat down with her.
He was definitely her husband.

573
00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:18.020
And at first it was a little uncomfortable for me,
especially when she gave me,

574
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.230
uh,
uh,
you better keep your mouth shut or I'll stab you.

575
00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:26.060
Look though this really happened.
Or did you train this?

576
00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:30.260
Who would just fucking openly cheat?
Like,
I don't know if I believe this,

577
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.660
but after a couple of minutes,

578
00:35:32.661 --> 00:35:37.661
I saw the irony of it when I thought she's here to see bill burr a who is famous

579
00:35:38.881 --> 00:35:40.800
for his anger towards these whores.

580
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.910
And I started dying laughing right in the middle of the theater when it wasn't

581
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:49.500
even half full yet,
which got me a couple of stares from people that hell,

582
00:35:49.501 --> 00:35:50.970
I thought it was fucking hilarious.

583
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.370
And this woman had no clue what I was laughing at,

584
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.030
which made it even better and I started laughing harder.
Anyway,

585
00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.480
love the podcast and I will see you again at Hampton soon.

586
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:06.840
Um,
yeah,
look,
I hope that then,

587
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:11.010
I hope the way you were reading that it didn't go down that way,
but uh,

588
00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:13.423
<v 0>you know,</v>

589
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.680
<v 1>I bet on the road a long time,
boys and girls and that little Robert Dinero,</v>

590
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:20.980
it looks easy to fall asleep.

591
00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:22.753
<v 0>MMM.</v>

592
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.650
<v 1>I've been on the road a long time and uh,
yeah,
I you,</v>

593
00:36:27.651 --> 00:36:32.370
you'd be amazed out married women behave.
It's fucking ridiculous.

594
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:35.760
And you know,
and it's not all of them.
Basically what it is,

595
00:36:35.761 --> 00:36:40.650
the decent people after the show,
they go home.
You know why?

596
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.310
Because they're happy with their lives.
They're happy with who they're with.

597
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:48.750
They got kids,
they got a job,
they want to get back to their life.

598
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:52.830
It's the people who hang out afterwards unless she younger than your 20s.

599
00:36:52.831 --> 00:36:57.480
But I'm saying
people who are married and they still fucking hang out.

600
00:36:57.481 --> 00:37:01.080
This still searching.
There's still seeking,
you know,

601
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.810
and a shit happens.
People Alba,
God is Meryl Streep.
That fucking old.

602
00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:08.913
<v 0>Ah,</v>

603
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.950
<v 1>you know what?
I'm going to shut this off.</v>

604
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.410
I can't fucking watch this shit anymore.

605
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.930
She looks like I can not to say that it's to me.

606
00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.680
Can you say a first lady?

607
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.830
She looks like our first lady.
Uh,
did she get,
by the way,

608
00:37:25.831 --> 00:37:29.460
does she get nominated every year?
She has to go down.

609
00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:32.430
Like people always talking about like Deniro,
Pachino,

610
00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.180
Marlon Brando and that type of thing.
You've got to throw her in there.

611
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.620
She's got to have the most nominations have,
Huh?

612
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:42.583
<v 0>MMM.</v>

613
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:45.910
<v 1>Isn't that unbelievable email?
It's just,</v>

614
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.910
let's just play along with this thing here and let's just say that that's true.

615
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.280
Like how long was this guy gone for?

616
00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.100
Man,
it had been free.

617
00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.450
She takes one look at this guy starts shooting the shit and they're talking loud

618
00:38:01.451 --> 00:38:03.790
enough that you hear it and they exchange phone numbers.

619
00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.660
I Dunno.
Well,
I mean,
I've,
I've seen,
uh,
I've seen worse.
Thanks.

620
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:16.270
I've been one time,
uh,
I was on the road,
you know,

621
00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:19.360
drinking with some people afterwards.
There was this married couple

622
00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.820
and the fucking wife in the end,
we all go to say goodnight,
say goodnight.

623
00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:24.340
The husband,

624
00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:28.930
she comes up and I'm standing there and she basically puts a clam on my fucking

625
00:38:28.931 --> 00:38:32.470
leg,
just like walks right into it.

626
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.100
It was,
it was,

627
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.310
<v 0>you know,
it was just like,</v>

628
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.280
your husband's right over there.
You get your goods on my leg,
what are you doing?

629
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.800
And I'd like to tell you that that only happened one fucking time.
You know,

630
00:38:50.801 --> 00:38:55.540
the deal,
women are smart with that dark.
I keep it in house.

631
00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:58.930
I think they just talk about it amongst themselves.
But,
uh,

632
00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.580
and then they got that great thing that even when they cheat,
it's,

633
00:39:01.581 --> 00:39:06.430
it's always cause the,
oh,
the guy wasn't,
uh,
wasn't giving me what I needed,

634
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.530
but blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
It's like,
well,
yeah,
that's why guys cheat too.

635
00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.693
You know,

636
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.920
<v 1>you weren't bringing another woman into the bedroom so I could have a threesome.</v>

637
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.843
Yeah,

638
00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.240
<v 0>no,
I don't fucking know.</v>

639
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:25.500
<v 1>Eight I'll be fucking unreal is what if your wife was one of those UFC checks?</v>

640
00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:28.170
You know when you're just a regular shit head like me,

641
00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:30.810
what do you do when you catch a cheating?

642
00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.240
What are you going to do?
That'd be fucked,
right?

643
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.980
If she goes,
yeah,
what are you gonna do about it?
She sort of cracks her neck.

644
00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.420
You know,
you'd still have to take a run at her.
I swear to God,

645
00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:52.370
I would grab a fucking the leg of a table,
you know?

646
00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:54.980
That's what I,
that's that would be what I would do.
I would,

647
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:59.990
I would grab a blunt object and just swing below the waist.
You know,

648
00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:04.320
cause that's a lesser degree of assault at a,
I just know that she has a,

649
00:40:04.321 --> 00:40:08.030
she hasn't any of her training.
I know she can choke me out.

650
00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:12.410
I know she can put me in an arm bar.
I know she's good standing up,
you know,

651
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:17.330
but she hasn't dealt with weapons.
I said I just start throwing shit at them.

652
00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:23.210
Start with a chair or your clock plucks a great thing to have.

653
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.700
I guess if that's what that would be my fail safe.

654
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:28.310
If I married one of those UFC fight and chicks,

655
00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.090
I would have a bunch of knickknacks that I've been slowly be accumulating acting

656
00:40:32.091 --> 00:40:33.800
as though it was a hobby.
But it would,

657
00:40:33.801 --> 00:40:37.460
it really would be is that would be stocking it with weaponry.
You know

658
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.970
what,
if she's an angry drunk,
comes home and just starts beating my ass.
Right.

659
00:40:41.971 --> 00:40:45.170
And I got to fucking go to work the next day telling lies.

660
00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:50.630
Yeah.
My name is Luca.
I married a UFC chick.

661
00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:56.630
Fucking brutal.
Oh my God.
That'd be the end of your life.

662
00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:00.740
You know what said there has to be a guy out there

663
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.850
who's just getting beat down by his woman every night.
There's just no,

664
00:41:04.851 --> 00:41:08.240
you can't fucking bring it up to anybody,
you know.

665
00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.630
Where's that fucking support group?
Um,
all right,

666
00:41:14.631 --> 00:41:18.650
revenge.
Jesus Christ.
I am blowing through all these questions.

667
00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.690
Revenge.
Uh,
Bill Barr,

668
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.550
I often have fantasies about getting people back,
but like you,

669
00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:30.230
I look at my higher self and can't do it now.
That's not what I do.

670
00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:35.180
I know I'm too fucking stupid and I'm going to caught,
you know,

671
00:41:35.181 --> 00:41:38.450
and I've also watched enough sport sports where I know that the,

672
00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:43.400
it's the guy who retaliates,
you know,
he's the guy always gets the penalty.

673
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:49.310
So anyways,
I got my revenge by living well and doing nothing.

674
00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:50.810
Um,

675
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:55.810
here's what happened to at least a few of my enemies and he said I did nothing

676
00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.550
to make this happen.
Okay?

677
00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:01.460
So this guy is basically claiming that he always wanted to get revenge,

678
00:42:01.461 --> 00:42:05.000
but he took the higher road and his revenge is living well and doing nothing.

679
00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.480
So here's all these people that he wanted to fuck over but never did.

680
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:12.260
This is what happened to him.
The p these people,
all right,

681
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:17.380
first person I do who fucked with me eventually went to jail for buggery and

682
00:42:19.341 --> 00:42:23.660
hanged himself when he was there.
What is buggery?

683
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:28.970
Is that fucking around Tom?
Is that Tom Foolery?
What country is this from?

684
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.680
Okay,
that's good.
How did you feel?
Good when he hung himself.

685
00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:35.290
Uh,

686
00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:40.130
another guy I hate was arrested for selling booze to kids and I laughed my ass

687
00:42:40.131 --> 00:42:44.870
off when I saw him on a news story about a local ATF stink.
Oh,

688
00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:46.260
that's a good one.
Uh,

689
00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:51.070
another dude who fucked my lady and had the back of his head,

690
00:42:51.071 --> 00:42:55.600
the back of his head caved in by an unknown assailant,
not me,

691
00:42:55.601 --> 00:42:59.530
I swear,
because he buggered a child.

692
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:01.753
<v 2>Okay.</v>

693
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.690
<v 1>All right dude.
If,</v>

694
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:07.340
if any more people suffer is sort of the same violent ending.

695
00:43:07.341 --> 00:43:08.330
I'm going to,
I'm going to,

696
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:12.230
I'm going to start to think that I'm going to start asking where you were when

697
00:43:12.231 --> 00:43:16.670
all this shit happened.
So anyways,
this guy goes to the back of his head,

698
00:43:16.671 --> 00:43:20.300
caved in for fucking with the kid.
He's alive,
but is now retarded.

699
00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:25.860
Uh,
you mean brain damaged?
Uh,
you know,

700
00:43:25.861 --> 00:43:30.300
I wish women would consider the possibility that they're hooking up with buggers

701
00:43:30.301 --> 00:43:33.840
when they go out on a girl,
that they're girl power.
Fuck sprees.

702
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.500
Don't for the love of it.
God,
what is buggers me,
I got to look this up.

703
00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.510
I can't read the rest of this shit.
What,
what,
what word am I looking up?

704
00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:45.420
We look up buggery

705
00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:50.820
the British term buggery.
Oh,
look at that.

706
00:43:50.821 --> 00:43:55.821
Gotta love the Internet is a very close in the meeting to the term sodomy.

707
00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:03.040
Jesus Christ,
and as often you,

708
00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.880
there's a bunch of people in England laughing their ass off with me trying to

709
00:44:05.881 --> 00:44:10.881
figure out what the fuck that was and is often used interchangeably in law and

710
00:44:10.951 --> 00:44:12.060
popular speech.

711
00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:18.110
It may also be a specific common law offense encompassing both sodomy and

712
00:44:18.331 --> 00:44:23.130
beastiality
in English law.

713
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.100
Buggery was first used.
I don't give a fuck about that.

714
00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.620
I don't care when it was first in 1533

715
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.060
Jason,
somebody probably fucked a Yak.

716
00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.880
The hell do you fucking 1533 saber tooth tiger.
You could do that.

717
00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:43.260
I think it would kill you.
Stick your Dick in a woolly mammoths trunk.

718
00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:50.413
<v 0>All right.</v>

719
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:56.460
<v 1>Defined punishments for the abominable crime of buggery committed with either</v>

720
00:44:56.461 --> 00:44:58.470
mankind or with an animal.

721
00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:03.780
The definition of buggery was not specific in these are any statutes,

722
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:07.800
but rather established by judicial precedent.
Over the years.

723
00:45:07.801 --> 00:45:12.801
The courts have defined buggery as including either anal intercourse by a man

724
00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:18.170
with a man or a woman or vaginal anal intercourse by either a man or a woman

725
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:23.090
with an animal.
Well,

726
00:45:23.091 --> 00:45:26.840
what if you fucking have anal intercourse with an animal?

727
00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:31.430
Is that like some sort of a second degree?
Buggery

728
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:36.560
I don't fucking know,
but not any form of unnatural intercourse.

729
00:45:36.561 --> 00:45:37.850
That is fucking unreal.

730
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:40.793
<v 0>Okay.</v>

731
00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:46.380
<v 1>Most common law jurisdictions have now been modified the lodge for knit permit</v>

732
00:45:46.541 --> 00:45:49.900
anal sex between consenting adults.
Jesus.

733
00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.660
They have a picture here of a guy,

734
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.960
a depiction of buggery of a goat by the late.

735
00:45:58.031 --> 00:46:02.290
Great Paul Avril.
Now I got this.
This is Wikipedia.

736
00:46:02.291 --> 00:46:06.370
Now I got to look up Paul April.
Is this what he was known for?

737
00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.750
Drawing.
Painting oil paintings of buggery.

738
00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.433
<v 0>Okay.</v>

739
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.360
<v 1>Evidently he was a French painter and a commercial artist.</v>

740
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:20.623
<v 0>Okay.</v>

741
00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:22.210
<v 1>All right.
Here's his gallery.</v>

742
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:26.770
Got a couple of women.
Maybe it's a guy.

743
00:46:26.771 --> 00:46:29.440
Everybody kind of looks the same and she's got her fucking legs spread.

744
00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:34.480
Got To Jesus Christ.
This guy made some filthy fucking follow.
I see.

745
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:37.180
Holy Shit.

746
00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:45.520
This guy has a photo of a guy banging a chicken is on her back while some other

747
00:46:46.701 --> 00:46:48.620
dude is putting it in his ass.

748
00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:53.180
I'll tell you right now that's not buggery.
He is.

749
00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:58.460
He's committing it and have it done to them at the same time.

750
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:02.910
<v 0>What the,
you know what</v>

751
00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:07.030
<v 1>this is?
This is a,</v>

752
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:09.993
<v 0>I got a little,</v>

753
00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:15.420
<v 1>this is really creepy.
Wow.
This guy really wrote pornographic shit.
Okay,</v>

754
00:47:15.421 --> 00:47:20.250
now there's a normal one guy and a girl.
Okay,
here we go.

755
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:24.390
Who are you to say what's durable?
Oh,
go fuck yourself.
You know what I'm saying?

756
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:29.170
Mainstream.
He's got another one at two chicks.

757
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.230
One's going down on the other.
What the fuck year was this?

758
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:37.120
Isn't that funny how she always think that nobody did shit like the 1849 to 1928

759
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.220
so people are sitting there talking about the Internet and all this porn and how

760
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:45.220
hard it's going to do to you look at this shit.
This guy was paid to.

761
00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:47.713
<v 0>Okay.</v>

762
00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:50.440
<v 1>Buggery everybody see that?
You learned something.</v>

763
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:55.240
I like to think you learn something on every podcast and I have to go back here

764
00:47:55.241 --> 00:47:59.940
for all the people here in America.
Okay.

765
00:47:59.941 --> 00:48:00.880
And do to fuck with me.

766
00:48:00.881 --> 00:48:05.650
Eventually went to jail for buggery and hanged himself when he was there.
Yeah,

767
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:08.510
cause he'll probably all screaming Chiton goat fucker at them.

768
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:12.910
Another guy I hate was arrested for selling booze to kids and I laughed my ass

769
00:48:12.911 --> 00:48:15.670
off when I saw a news story about him at a Lopa ATF stick.

770
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.520
Another dude fucked with my lady at the back of his head,

771
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:22.870
caved in by an unknown assailant,
not me,
I swear,
because he buggered a child.

772
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:27.880
He fucked the kid.
Somebody came to his head and all right,

773
00:48:27.881 --> 00:48:31.420
I liked that frontier justice.
He's alive,

774
00:48:31.421 --> 00:48:34.270
but now he's brain damaged.
You know,

775
00:48:34.271 --> 00:48:38.440
I wish women would consider the possibility that they're hooking up with buggers

776
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:41.950
when they go out on their girl power fucked sprees.

777
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.500
Now what do you mean by buggers now?

778
00:48:44.501 --> 00:48:48.310
Does that mean that they're going out with a guy who would fuck a yak or fuck a

779
00:48:48.311 --> 00:48:50.980
kid or going out with a guy who wants to put it in their ass?

780
00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:57.500
Uh,
I don't,
I don't,
you're losing me on this one.
Uh,
please,

781
00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:01.610
please read this letter on your show in case any hose or listening.

782
00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.000
Yuck.
I don't know what he's talking about.

783
00:49:05.001 --> 00:49:10.001
My woman who fucked a child molester and it's become a 250 pound wart hog since

784
00:49:11.361 --> 00:49:14.750
then.
So we're girl power days are over.

785
00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.240
I got rid of her 15 years ago.
Thank God.

786
00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:23.130
I don't know who to be.
Dude.

787
00:49:23.131 --> 00:49:25.620
Use kinda sound just as bad as the people you,
I mean,

788
00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:28.840
you haven't buggered anybody.
I hope what I made it kicks out just

789
00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:34.670
you're definitely a,
yeah,
you're definitely a piece of work here buddy.
Uh,

790
00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:41.620
yet another dude who used to pull the most bizarre mind games on me and others

791
00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:45.710
coincidentally had an extremely expensive divorce.

792
00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:50.720
I'm sorry,
I was just thinking of that fucking photo.

793
00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:53.240
I couldn't get that out of my head that someone would actually consider doing

794
00:49:53.241 --> 00:49:54.170
that back in the day.

795
00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.280
It just seems like next level porno like that seems like the future,

796
00:49:58.281 --> 00:50:00.530
not the past.
You know,

797
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.070
like a bunch of pornography people sitting around going,
all right,

798
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.110
what is left the doe?

799
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.030
<v 0>Okay,</v>

800
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:13.660
<v 1>gay porn,
we already did that.
Heterosexual are dead.</v>

801
00:50:13.661 --> 00:50:16.660
That hey,
wait a minute.
You know,

802
00:50:16.661 --> 00:50:21.580
all these djs are doing mashups.
I have an idea.
Um,

803
00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:23.560
anyways.
Yet another dude who used to,

804
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:28.950
who used to pull the most bizarre mind games on me and others coincidentally had

805
00:50:29.481 --> 00:50:32.960
an extremely expensive divorce.
Now he's poor and helpless.

806
00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:38.060
Former boss who was a hot shot fuck,
went to jail for embezzlement.

807
00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:43.310
Do,
what are you been doing?
How do you know all these people have gone to jail?

808
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.760
This person goes to jail for embezzlement.
This other kid fucks a kid.

809
00:50:46.761 --> 00:50:49.820
Somebody buggered some.
I don't know what you know,

810
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:52.460
why don't you hang out with better people?

811
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:55.760
What part of the country do you live in,
sir?
Uh,

812
00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:00.710
several other fuck head bosses who have lost their contacts or otherwise got

813
00:51:00.711 --> 00:51:03.590
pushed into poverty or injury by various means.
You know,

814
00:51:03.591 --> 00:51:06.650
this is starting to read like some fucking Charles Dickens story.

815
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.460
Is this shit really happening or is this your fantasies?
Uh,

816
00:51:10.461 --> 00:51:14.960
many other bad things have happened to slap offs.
Who Hurt me?
And guess what?

817
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:19.910
I had to visit briefly with the police in a few cases because they learned that

818
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:22.610
I was a victim of the Douche bag.
Sorry,

819
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:26.390
I think this is just science fiction at this point,
but it's a good read.

820
00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:31.460
I have a good reputation.
So I was never treated seriously as a suspect.

821
00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:34.280
Many of these things took years before they came out,

822
00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:37.070
but they happen nevertheless like clockwork.

823
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:43.410
I speak it very vaguely.
If anybody knows what's going on in this,
I have no idea.

824
00:51:43.411 --> 00:51:45.570
All of a sudden I feel like I'm in some Sherlock Holmes Shit.

825
00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.433
<v 3>MMM.</v>

826
00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:52.600
<v 1>Are you like Kevin Spacey and you're just making all this shit up and you're</v>

827
00:51:52.601 --> 00:51:55.900
going to walk out of the podcast and your club foot's going to straight.
Now

828
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:02.750
I had all the revenge I ever needed and never had to lift a finger.

829
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:06.650
Best of all,
my soul is intact.
I'm not dead and I'm not in jail.

830
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.370
The world has good things in store for all of us.

831
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:15.140
Your Monday morning podcast is great.
Thanks for cheering me up every week.

832
00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:19.910
Every week.
All right,
sir.
That was,
uh,
definitely one of the more bizarre ones.

833
00:52:19.911 --> 00:52:22.950
But you know something.
Thank you for writing in I,
Yah,

834
00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:27.710
you taught me a new word and I saw a guy,
a new sexual position.

835
00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:37.300
Anyways.
What the hell are we?

836
00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:42.460
What the fuck do you go from buggery I should have closed on that.
Christ.

837
00:52:42.461 --> 00:52:46.750
What the fuck is this?
Get this out of the way.
Get this out of the way.

838
00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:51.340
Um,
all right.
What do I do here?
I got to look another eight minutes to kill here.

839
00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:53.100
<v 3>MMM.</v>

840
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.490
<v 1>Women in UFC,
bas been at Boston.
I don't know what else to talk about.</v>

841
00:52:57.491 --> 00:52:59.350
I think that I might be a little short this week guys.

842
00:52:59.351 --> 00:53:04.351
I really apologize about the unbelievably poor quality of recording these past

843
00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:06.770
few weeks.
I've just,
I was really,
um,

844
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:10.360
I was really busy and I didn't get a fucking chance to,
uh,

845
00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:14.850
to do something that would only take me fucking 20 minutes.
So was,

846
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:18.130
let's be honest.
But,
um,
I was really stressing about that Patrice thing.

847
00:53:18.131 --> 00:53:21.550
I wanted to make sure that it,
it,
it went great.
And a,

848
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.500
this week on the weekend on stage,

849
00:53:23.501 --> 00:53:26.160
I actually remembered to Patrice story that I told and I told you guys

850
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:27.630
eventually I'd be able to tell you a story.

851
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:29.503
<v 3>MMM.</v>

852
00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:34.190
<v 1>It's just sort of a rounder bub Patrice one,
but it's got Bobby Kelly did.</v>

853
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:36.070
It's got him in it too.

854
00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.970
I'll tell you this one and then I'm going to end this podcast.
Uh,
all right.
So

855
00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:47.200
when I moved to New York,
I moved there.
Basically.
I had never lived on my own.

856
00:53:47.201 --> 00:53:49.690
I went right from my parents' house to living in New York City.

857
00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.770
I didn't know shit about the ladies,
right?

858
00:53:55.300 --> 00:54:00.300
So I moved down to New York and I meet this girl who's an absolute fucking

859
00:54:01.801 --> 00:54:06.040
psycho.
All right?
Like,
nowadays,

860
00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:07.721
I swear to God,

861
00:54:07.721 --> 00:54:10.690
I could talk to this girl for two seconds to realize that she was out of her

862
00:54:10.691 --> 00:54:13.670
mind and I would not even,
I probably wouldn't even say hello to her.

863
00:54:13.671 --> 00:54:14.980
They're just feet.
We'd some way,

864
00:54:14.981 --> 00:54:17.650
the way our hours eyes were darting around the room.

865
00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:21.670
I would know that she was out of her fucking mind.
But,
uh,
I was young,

866
00:54:21.671 --> 00:54:26.020
I didn't know shit.
So
I ended up going out with her.

867
00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:28.810
I need all the crazy girls.
They're fucking,

868
00:54:28.811 --> 00:54:32.380
they're great in bed and when you're young,
you,
you keep coming back,

869
00:54:32.381 --> 00:54:35.110
you keep coming back because you never,
you never had it like that before.

870
00:54:35.111 --> 00:54:38.860
So I keep coming back.
But she was,
she was fucking nuts.

871
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:44.110
It was girl when she was crying.
I mean,
I,
I show up to her apartment,

872
00:54:44.111 --> 00:54:45.250
she'd have like a fucking,

873
00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:51.160
like a wig on and just act like she was somebody else that's fucking crazy.

874
00:54:51.161 --> 00:54:53.830
And then,
you know,
fuck my brains out.
Like I'm,

875
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:57.030
I'm in my twenties I'm going to walk away from that.
We said,

876
00:54:57.031 --> 00:55:00.310
I didn't realize that was what she sounded like she was out of her mind.

877
00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:02.283
<v 3>MMM.</v>

878
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:07.260
<v 1>So anyway,
so I finally just said,
listen,
this ain't working out,
will pop up,
blah,</v>

879
00:55:07.261 --> 00:55:09.690
blah blah.
And all of a sudden she turned into clean,

880
00:55:09.691 --> 00:55:14.691
close in fatal attraction and I didn't know how to get rid of her.

881
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:20.340
She would like call me and one time,
like

882
00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:26.090
she knew basically when I was going to be home and this is,

883
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:28.890
I didn't have an answer machine or anything like that.
Did I?
Yeah,

884
00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:31.620
I think I did know I had voicemail and uh,

885
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:37.800
she'd fucking call and I'm laying in bed and I know what's her,

886
00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:40.950
it's late at night.
None of my friends are going to call it nothing.

887
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:46.830
And uh,
and I just let,
let it go to voicemail and I swear to God,

888
00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:49.320
eight seconds later she called again

889
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.800
and she was calling
like,
she did this for almost,

890
00:55:55.801 --> 00:56:00.480
I swear to God,
like 40 minutes straight,
which is called my number.

891
00:56:00.481 --> 00:56:02.640
It would go to,
she let it ring six times.

892
00:56:02.641 --> 00:56:06.990
It would go to voicemail and then she would hang up and then sit there for five

893
00:56:06.991 --> 00:56:08.520
seconds and then call me back.

894
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:13.290
And after like the fucking 400 times she did this,

895
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:19.340
I finally picked up the phone and I went,
what?
She says like,

896
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.580
Oh,
I just like want to talk to them.

897
00:56:22.581 --> 00:56:25.360
I can you keep McAllen if a 40 minutes fucking straight.

898
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:28.270
I'm trying to go to sleep.
Right.
And I fucking hang up on her.

899
00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:33.380
So she ends up coming by my apartment.
It's got,

900
00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:35.190
it was out of a fucking [inaudible] she was out of,
I don't,

901
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:39.430
I just thought of her fucking mind.
So it just put,
keeps,

902
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:43.330
what I should have been doing is just,
I should just shut the phone off.

903
00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.640
If you ever,
if you ever with like a psycho chick like this,

904
00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.810
which you have to do is you just have to phrase them up.

905
00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:51.880
You have to act like they don't exist because if you acknowledge them,

906
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:55.420
it just fuels them and they just keep fucking coming back.

907
00:56:55.850 --> 00:56:59.100
So he finally told me that,
just say,
pick up the phone,
say hello.
If it's her,

908
00:56:59.110 --> 00:57:03.880
just hang up on him.
Just keep doing that.
I,
but I didn't know to do that shit.

909
00:57:03.881 --> 00:57:06.460
So this is so long gone.
I forget what happened.

910
00:57:06.461 --> 00:57:11.461
All I know it escalates to the point that she is now threatening me and she told

911
00:57:11.771 --> 00:57:15.910
me,
I'm living with Bobby Kelly by the way.
So he's given me advice.

912
00:57:15.911 --> 00:57:20.911
He's also a young guy and he's also kind of laughing his ass off and we're both

913
00:57:20.981 --> 00:57:21.471
kind of laughed.

914
00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:24.850
And until one day she called me up and she threatened that she was going to stab

915
00:57:24.851 --> 00:57:27.910
me,
do something violent to me,

916
00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:31.960
really just freaked me out.
So I fucking hang up

917
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.620
and I'm going to Bobby.
I'm like,
dude,
what am I going to do?

918
00:57:35.621 --> 00:57:37.120
You know I'm going down the cellar tonight.

919
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:40.180
I think I was at the comic strip and I'm like,
my fucking name.

920
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:44.230
He's right on the sheet.
She,
she's got to know exactly when I'm coming in.

921
00:57:44.231 --> 00:57:47.230
Well what do I do?
He's like,
I don't know dude.

922
00:57:47.231 --> 00:57:49.700
I fucking do you know where two coats or something matter of,

923
00:57:49.701 --> 00:57:53.920
forget what the hell he told me to do.
So like two,
three hours goes by.

924
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:58.780
All of a sudden the apartment door buzzes and,
uh,

925
00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:05.020
and it's her.
And I'm like,
I'm like,
hello?
She's like,

926
00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:09.280
yeah,
it's me.
And I'm like,
yeah,
go fuck yourself.
And she goes,
no.

927
00:58:09.281 --> 00:58:12.430
She goes like,
I want to give you something.
And I'm like,
what?

928
00:58:12.431 --> 00:58:17.020
A fucking knife in the chest.
And she's like,
no,
I made your brownies.

929
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:20.890
I'm like,
what?
And then she went,
and from in three hours,

930
00:58:20.891 --> 00:58:22.780
I'm going to stab you until I made you some Brownie.

931
00:58:22.781 --> 00:58:25.210
So for some fucking dumb reason,
I buzzer it.

932
00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:31.640
And,
uh,
I opened the door with the chain.

933
00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:33.320
You don't standing way back behind it.

934
00:58:33.321 --> 00:58:35.020
And that she is sitting there with their crazy,

935
00:58:35.021 --> 00:58:40.021
yet those watery eyes that crazy people have big fucking deer eyes.

936
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:46.410
She goes,
can I come in?
I go,
absolutely not.
She goes to take the brownies I got.

937
00:58:46.411 --> 00:58:47.480
I don't want it.
She goes,
take them.

938
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:51.690
She turns the fucking tin sideways and she pushes him through.
So I take,

939
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.840
and she goes,
I'll call you later.
And I said,
yeah,
okay.

940
00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.570
Just trying to get rid of her.
All right.
Close the fucking door.

941
00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:02.670
I set it down on the tape.
Me and Bob are a couple of starving artists.

942
00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:04.080
They smelled delicious.

943
00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:09.750
We're both sitting there staring at these things going,

944
00:59:09.751 --> 00:59:12.630
what the fuck did we do here?
I want to eat them,

945
00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:15.870
but she just threatened to fucking stab me.
What do we do?

946
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:20.610
So we call up the lake.
Great Patrice O'neil,
start telling the story.

947
00:59:20.611 --> 00:59:23.540
He's fucking laughing his ass off and he goes,
don't eat those brownies.

948
00:59:23.541 --> 00:59:25.220
That bitch probably peed in the batter.

949
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:29.270
Sit out the three of us a laugh from a fucking asses off like what do we do?

950
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:34.940
So long story short,
me and Bobby
ended up taking,

951
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.610
we take all the brownies out except for like three of them

952
00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:43.180
and had we stick them back in the tin and we were living on the ground floor and

953
00:59:43.181 --> 00:59:43.871
we brought it out.

954
00:59:43.871 --> 00:59:48.370
We stuck it on top of a trash bag right on the sidewalk in anything you had on

955
00:59:48.371 --> 00:59:51.760
New York City,
but you just stuck it out there.
We lived up on 97th street.

956
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:56.500
We had like crackheads living in like did the bowels of the building was fucking

957
00:59:56.501 --> 00:59:59.110
nuts.
So anything you put out there was gone in two seconds.

958
00:59:59.111 --> 01:00:00.010
So we just stuck it there.

959
01:00:00.011 --> 01:00:03.250
We ran back into the apartment and we just sat there peeking through the
curtain,

960
01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:07.150
wait for some homeless guy to come along and see what happens when you eat them.

961
01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:11.070
Sure enough,
some homeless guy comes along,
he sees the 10 C's are men there.

962
01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:15.700
Pick some squeezes them,
sees the fucking still warm pops one in his mouth.

963
01:00:15.701 --> 01:00:19.020
Nothing happened being pop looked at each other.
We said,
fuck it.

964
01:00:19.021 --> 01:00:22.690
We ate it and they were delicious.
Oh,
it with delicious.

965
01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.100
That really wasn't a,
Patrice has only in the helium.
Made a cameo in that one.

966
01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:29.950
But uh,
I'll try and tell some other ones later on.

967
01:00:29.951 --> 01:00:34.150
But at Jesus belts,
you'll let us down on that one.
Did I?

968
01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:38.280
It was a nice,
crazy woman's story.
Um,

969
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:43.360
it's fucking podcast.
It,
this is by Kryptonite.

970
01:00:43.361 --> 01:00:47.740
If I don't have my recorder goes down by 20%.
And the funny,
anyways,

971
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:54.000
that was the Monday morning podcast for this week of Jesus.
Uh,

972
01:00:54.330 --> 01:00:57.270
thank you for listening.
Um,
I don't know what shows I have coming up,

973
01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:01.350
but I know you guys don't want to listen to me clicking on my computer anymore.

974
01:01:01.351 --> 01:01:05.250
I,
I really apologize for the poor quality of these the last two weeks.
Uh,

975
01:01:05.251 --> 01:01:08.760
I swear to God,
next week is going to be fucking crisp.
All right.

976
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:10.680
That's the podcast for this week.

977
01:01:10.681 --> 01:01:15.330
Go fuck yourselves and thank you to everybody here who came out to my shows at

978
01:01:15.331 --> 01:01:18.410
the Wilbur theater.
It was unbelievable turnout.
Um,

979
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.900
every show was great and you know,
all my family and friends that came out,

980
01:01:21.901 --> 01:01:24.780
people I went to school with and it was,
it was great to see everybody.

981
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:29.890
That is it.
I'll see the city of Boston.
I'll be back in this summer,

982
01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.730
New Hampshire,
maybe down the cake.
All right,
that's it.
See Ya.
