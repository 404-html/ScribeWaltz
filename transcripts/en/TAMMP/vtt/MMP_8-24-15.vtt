1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.013
Okay.

2
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.260
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill Burn?
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.270
August 24th,
2050 what's going on?
How or why?

4
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.230
<v 0>How's it going?
Oh,
lovely.</v>

5
00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:17.600
End Of August for all the adult fret.

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.640
Don't fret with the global warming will have summer weather until like October.

7
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.050
Then we'll have epic fucking snow storms,
then a,

8
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.590
then a swarm of mosquitoes signaling that we're going winter to summer,

9
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.580
winter to summer.
That's how it works now.
I don't know why.

10
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.840
I don't know if fits because that's the natural cycle,

11
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.460
<v 1>you know?
That's really all throughout the history of the war.</v>

12
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:46.650
All they are right there.
If God's real cooling off and Haiti got parents,

13
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.150
there's that argument and then there's the other argument.

14
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.470
<v 0>What do you think?
Too many Q tips be flushing down the toilet.</v>

15
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.670
It is choking all the macro,
you know,

16
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.060
and were causing him stop putting a hairspray and your pubes.

17
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.120
Right.
Um,
I have no idea why.

18
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.280
All I know is this towards the end of this summer and this is when I get excited

19
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:19.281
for football and baseball all at the same time because the games are starting to

20
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:22.950
fucking matter.
Um,
you know,
just sucks.

21
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:26.880
My team's like 12 and a half fucking games out,
you know,
12 and a half games out.

22
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:30.660
But before we get into any of that shit,
let's talk about the,
uh,

23
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.490
the number one controversy in the fucking country.
Um,
my weight loss

24
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.230
now as you know,
as of July 5th,
um,

25
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.550
the Internet went crazy when they heard that I was quitting drinking.

26
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.930
There was a backlash and um,
whatever,

27
00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:56.430
I quit drinking on July 5th,
and I've been trying,
I was gone,

28
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.620
I was about a buck 87,
a buck 88,
and I was going to get down to those,

29
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.360
lose three pounds a week over the next,
uh,
whatever the fuck that is,

30
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.490
whatever that comes out to like eight weeks or self.

31
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.030
And I was going to get down to one 62 and I was going to have a flat stomach and

32
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:16.750
I was going to have abs and people are going to love it.
Right?

33
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.080
So what happened the first two weeks I went,
great.

34
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.340
<v 1>One 86 down to one 83 one 83 down to one 80 right on schedule.</v>

35
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.270
Then I went to fucking Montreal and I got my ass kicked.
I did,
I,
you know,

36
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.230
I went on the road.
Uh,
I didn't lose any weight,
but I didn't gain any weight.

37
00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:34.160
Stayed at a buck 80

38
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.260
<v 0>in one week,
three down to a buck.</v>

39
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.320
77 week four down to a buck.

40
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.870
74 week five down to one 71 now this week.
All right,

41
00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:47.950
so I'm five and one

42
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.940
five and one oh belly fat,
tits.

43
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.600
Turn in the bus around,
driving away from the

44
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.630
<v 1>and over to this salad.
Um,</v>

45
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.360
so this week I needed to be one 68.02 B six and one and have a commanding lead

46
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.540
and the AFC ease of pasty titch right.

47
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.930
This week I weighed in at one 68.8 big time loss.

48
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.140
Oh six one would,
it looks so good on the calendar.
Now I'm five and two.

49
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.780
I did great up until last night.
And um,
my wife had somebody,

50
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:38.620
uh,
you know,
in town that we both know,
you know,

51
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.930
they're going to do business or whatever.

52
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:44.790
And I knew this person sort of business and friends.
So we went out,
uh,

53
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.650
went down to the rainbow room,
um,

54
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.550
on sunset and I had two old duels.

55
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.910
I mean that those have to be of all the empty calories out there,

56
00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.190
those have to be the empty of stuff,
them all.
And then I had two slices of pizza.

57
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.760
It did that around 10,
11 o'clock.
And at my age that's enough to fuck you over.

58
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.340
And um,
so whatever.
So next week I gotta be down to one 65.

59
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:11.710
I don't know how the fuck I'm going to do that.
That's almost four pounds.

60
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.030
Probably not going to happen.
I might have to adjust my goal to one 66.
In fact,

61
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:20.860
I think I'm to,
we'll just say one 66 cause that'll be 2.8 pounds,
right?

62
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.280
So rather than me getting discouraged by not making one 65 will be psyched to be

63
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:29.320
one 66.
And I know what you're thinking.
Like Jesus Christ bill.

64
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.470
That's like when they give every fucking dumb kid at a goddamn trophy because

65
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:38.860
he,
he ran down the street with his fucking shorts on,
right?

66
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.210
Whatever the hell they do in gym class.
Now everybody clap your hands.

67
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:45.470
You have a clap,
say hands and gets a fucking trophy.
I,

68
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.020
I'm not doing that that way.
All right.
I'm taking the law some five and two.
Boy,

69
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:54.730
you got to have realistic goals here.
If I don't hit them,
then I go,
oh fuck it.

70
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:58.550
And I go back to booze and,
and uh,

71
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.500
nothing to not drinking and fucking working out makes Billy at tired boy

72
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.450
drinking.
I could stay up all night running my fucking.
Yep.
So anyways,

73
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:09.070
one 68.8.
Um,

74
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.970
and I'm glad that I'm talking about this on the podcast because right now I

75
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:17.110
think I look great.
All right.
I fucking,
you know,

76
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:20.920
wake up in the morning,
look in the mirror,
and I go,
God damn,
that is one,

77
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.660
right?
I liked the way I look right now.
It's been a while.

78
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.010
So a,
the temptation is to stop boop,
boop,

79
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.370
boop,
boop,
boop,
uh,
do they sing that song sunshine on a cloudy day?

80
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.020
Start hearing that song.
Well,
uh,

81
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.570
get some chocolate cake,
right?

82
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.920
You just start eating like a fucking moron.
Do a little Bingo.

83
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:52.300
Bango is Joe to Rosa says Bingo.
Bango which is a beer and a shot.

84
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.890
Um,
I believe Joe to want to Joe Dorros,
his friends back home coined that phrase.

85
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:58.230
Bingo.

86
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.390
<v 0>Banga and uh,</v>

87
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:02.000
there's a few people doing that last night at the rainbow room and I was like,

88
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:04.190
God damn it,
that looks,
that looks enjoyable.

89
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.350
As I look across this sticky table,
eating a surprisingly good pizza,

90
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.520
surprisingly good slice of pizza for Los Angeles,
California at the Rainbow Room.

91
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.680
Um,
seeing somebody do a little Bingo,
Bango was like,
oh man.

92
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.340
In fact,
the last time I did that I think was at the Rainbow Room.

93
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.770
I don't go there often,
but when I delve,
uh,

94
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.840
you know,
beer and a shot,
you've got to do it.

95
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.730
Why else would you go there to look at the Nelson Memorabilia?

96
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.810
I don't think I do.
Um,
is that his base up on the wall?

97
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.760
Who knows?
All right.
Anyways,
uh,
so one 68,
that's all right.

98
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:47.720
So the next week I'm going to go for one 66 and then,
uh,

99
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.780
then the following week I'll be what we'll see.
That'd be one 63.

100
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.551
I'll be a pound short,

101
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:55.460
so I'll have to go an extra couple of days and that's what I get.

102
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.800
That's what I get for drinking a couple of old tools,

103
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.970
which I gotta tell you for non alcohol,
it's not that bad.

104
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.580
It's not good.
You know what I mean?

105
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.500
The emptiest of all empty calories.
What a fucking moron.
Right?

106
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.240
So anyways,
I,
um,
hey,
by the way,

107
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:17.600
my phone is acting up here.
I got the fucking iPhone six,

108
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.930
so I'm supposed to be with all the cool kids here with all the brand new shit.

109
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.180
And for some reason this thing,
yeah,

110
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.900
I just lost all my fucking text messages,

111
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:33.070
but it's saying I have three and then it keeps telling me to sign into iCloud,

112
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.180
which I don't want to do.

113
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.210
And I keep hitting cancel and then it keeps popping up again.

114
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:40.190
If anybody knows how to make that go away,

115
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:46.700
make the world go away.
Um,
make that fucking thing go away.

116
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:51.380
I,
I would,
uh,
I would really appreciate it.
Messages.

117
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:55.160
What did I do here?
How come I'm not getting my messages?
So you know,

118
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.770
what you want to do is click on the settings,

119
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:03.350
the settings fucking thingamajiggy there.
I have no idea what's going on here.

120
00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:05.780
I have the iPhone six.
What happened?
Did I sweat on it?

121
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:11.330
And I did I drop it in a fish tank.
They would say that to you.
Did you drop it?

122
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.260
Oh yeah.
It just fucking spiked it on the ground,
pal.
I said,
you're not,
you know,

123
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.340
you're not supposed to do that with the phones.
Yeah,
I wasn't sure.

124
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.200
So anyways,
um,
let's see.
What do I weigh?

125
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.750
I weigh one 68.8.
Uh,

126
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.310
so I'm going for one 66 the back of my head,
I'm still going from one 65,

127
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.690
uh,
and Alyssa,
I'm going to ride this bike that I just got fucking redone,

128
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.470
fixed up or whatever a couple times this week.

129
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.580
Just cause every time I look at it I hear versus voice now going through it

130
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.290
again.
He never got it.
He never going to riot.

131
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.790
That is the biggest fucking waste of money.
And you know what?

132
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:50.990
Every time I think he's right,

133
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:54.530
I picture Paul Versey on a bicycle and I just started dying laughing and I

134
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:55.980
realized he doesn't ride a

135
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.940
<v 1>bike.
Paul Versey never rode a bike.
You know what I mean?</v>

136
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:01.440
He likes for daughters to dance.

137
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:04.980
Anybody likes a four door sedan does not like a bicycle.

138
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.990
You know the,
the what,
the kind of mode of,

139
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.220
he's the Kinda guy that if he bought a motorcycle,

140
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:13.560
he didn't want to get a fucking three wheeler.
Right?

141
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.360
Am I an asshole here?
I still realize you're exposed when you ride those things.

142
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:25.710
But I think the only people who should ride those are really old bikers who

143
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:29.910
spent four to five decades riding on two wheels.
Then they're just too old,

144
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.643
you know,

145
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.910
too brittle to get back out there and they're old horse sell,

146
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:40.260
but they still love riding.
So you get them to fucking trick,
you know,

147
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.160
you get him the three wheeler,
right?
Seeing these fucking,

148
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:46.740
every time I see a fucking young punk on one of those things,

149
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.810
they're always looking over their shoulder and somebody in like a fucking German

150
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:53.890
four door sports car and that sports car,

151
00:09:53.891 --> 00:09:57.180
a four door sedan is always chasing them.

152
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.160
That's happened to me three times out here.

153
00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:02.390
I see some kid in one and he comes roaring up to the red light and he's

154
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.540
frantically looking over his shoulder and then some kid and like a white BMW is

155
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:10.710
chase him.
It's like fucking grand theft auto.
Actually,
I only saw it one time,

156
00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:12.770
but recently I saw another kid pull up to a red heart,

157
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.210
red light and a three wheeler and he fucking looked over his shoulder.

158
00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:18.330
So within my head,
not only was it happening again,

159
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:22.680
I added another one almost like bankers when you deposit a hundred bucks and

160
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:24.060
then they loan out that a hundred bucks,

161
00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:28.980
like fucking 90 different to 90 different people and just counterfeit 800 bucks

162
00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:33.450
out of the fucking hair.
Right?
Um,
anyway,
so this is the Monday morning podcast,

163
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.470
um,
for this week.
And uh,

164
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.330
I got to a,
I got to make sure I fucking eat,

165
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.240
eat well this fucking week I got to do this.
I got to see this thing through.

166
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.070
I got to get down to a buck 62.
Um,
other than that,

167
00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:54.030
my fucking summers getting about ready to get fucking great or football coming

168
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:56.850
around.
I can't fucking believe it's almost here.
You know,

169
00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.540
I am so Jones and for sports right now that I actually taped.
Um,

170
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.160
if you wonder about my weird breathing,
I had a fucking burrito today.
I'm just,

171
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.920
I'm going off the rails,
but I'm,
I'm talking about it out loud here,

172
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.670
so I don't fuck up.
You know what happens?
First day you look in the mirror,

173
00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:12.710
you're like,
dude,
I look good.
I look fine.
Right?

174
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.000
Then that part of your brain goes,
hey,
let's go to Mcdonald's.

175
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.840
You know what I think I will.
Um,

176
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.950
but I actually watched Serena Williams in the semifinals of that,
uh,

177
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.280
Cincinnati Tournament and I didn't see it today.

178
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.400
I kind of got into all these obscure tournament's.

179
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.570
I only used to watch like the finals of the majors,

180
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:34.650
but right now I'm reading Andre Agassi's book,
uh,
open,

181
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.660
which I highly fucking recommend,

182
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:41.610
especially for somebody who's trying to accomplish something or if you fucking

183
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:44.130
hate tennis.
Um,

184
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.450
the way he describes which you go through mentally.

185
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.290
God,
I can't stop yawning.

186
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.240
What you go through mentally when trying to win a tournament or just trying to

187
00:11:57.241 --> 00:12:01.560
get better or not get psyched out because you're the new kid and you're playing

188
00:12:01.561 --> 00:12:05.370
against John Mcenroe's or some fucking legend.
Um,

189
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.550
it's an incredible book.
So I started in,

190
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:13.270
what has fascinated me more than the majors has been all these,

191
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:17.050
what I considered jerk off tour tournaments that I never paid attention to

192
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.720
Indian wells,
Cincinnati,
you know the clay season.

193
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.100
I only thought that was just the French Open and that's it.

194
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:27.520
And he was like saying that there's the [inaudible] and the grass seeds and they

195
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:29.440
got all these other fucking obscure tournaments.

196
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.220
And you know what I love most about them?
Plenty of fucking seats.

197
00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.481
Jesus Christ.

198
00:12:35.481 --> 00:12:39.830
You could have just walked into Cincinnati and sat down and watched a whoever

199
00:12:39.831 --> 00:12:41.570
the fuck you wanted.
Tremendous.

200
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:46.810
So I watched Serena when and today she won the whole thing and Roger Federal,

201
00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.870
so one,
and I guess he's looking young,
you know,
we'll see.

202
00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:54.690
He's rewinding the clock there and a,
the u s opens around the corner.

203
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.063
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

204
00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.930
<v 1>They making you guys yarn.
I Dunno what's going on with me.</v>

205
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.010
I don't know what's going on here.
Um,
you know what it is.

206
00:13:04.011 --> 00:13:06.710
I ate a bunch of shit food.
My Body's reacting to it right now.

207
00:13:06.711 --> 00:13:09.410
It's fucking just shutting everything down.
You know,

208
00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:13.190
like when you close all the extra apps because it's sucking off your fucking

209
00:13:13.191 --> 00:13:15.320
battery there.
You know what I mean?

210
00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.240
I think that's what my brain's do it right now.
All right,

211
00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.520
let's shut it down and deal with this fucked up thing.

212
00:13:19.521 --> 00:13:23.450
He just putting our stomach,
this is the priority.
Everything else,

213
00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:28.280
like consciousness doesn't fucking matter anymore.
So anyways,
um,

214
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.320
I'm actually psyched to watch,

215
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.970
to watch the u s open and actually to watch tennis on a level that I never

216
00:13:34.971 --> 00:13:39.340
watched it before,
which is basically a to pay attention to is they,

217
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.980
this is the person keep hitting to the other person's forehand to their
backhand.

218
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.240
They hit a right Adam,

219
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.510
where do they put it in the box when they fucking serve it,
you know,

220
00:13:47.511 --> 00:13:50.390
does the person cheat in?
I used to watch that though.
They cheated in,
you know,

221
00:13:50.391 --> 00:13:52.120
if they're standing a few feet behind the baseline,

222
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.550
then on the second survey of the inside,
the baseline and that type of shy,

223
00:13:55.551 --> 00:13:57.050
you know,
I never used to pay attention to that shit,

224
00:13:57.051 --> 00:14:01.850
but it actually makes tennis way more enjoyable to watch.
And,

225
00:14:01.851 --> 00:14:06.230
uh,
so whatever,
you know,
I'm not a big reader,
but I'm actually enjoying the,
uh,

226
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.600
Andre Agassi book there.
So,
uh,
anyways,
uh,
Jesus,
14 fucking minutes.

227
00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:16.310
I'll just babbling,
babbling.
So anyways,
did anybody watch?

228
00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:20.210
I was on Conan this week.
I want to thank everybody over there once again.

229
00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:24.320
Had a fucking awesome time.
How great is Kona man?
The guy just rolls whatever,

230
00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:27.560
every time you get out there.
And as you noticed,
I was hyping a,

231
00:14:27.561 --> 00:14:29.270
the Madison Square Garden Show,

232
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:34.400
which is a obviously a big deal for me.
And um,

233
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.420
oh wait a minute,
I already talked to him.
I did.
I kind of talk about this.
Well,

234
00:14:38.421 --> 00:14:41.070
I said who was going to be on it.
Um,

235
00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:42.670
<v 2>okay.</v>

236
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.650
<v 1>And whatnot,
whatever.
That's fun though.</v>

237
00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:46.540
That shit is always fun doing fucking panel.

238
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.900
It's a lot easier than coming out there and doing fucking stand up.

239
00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:52.090
You know what I mean?
We are set to go

240
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.240
<v 0>out there and host the show,
going out doing panels easy.</v>

241
00:14:55.241 --> 00:14:57.970
You just sit down and if you get someone cool like Conan,

242
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.510
he just fucking set me up.
Just TG up the whole time.
You know,

243
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:05.020
and then if you're on a nice Ronnie lets you go and then if you fucking fall on

244
00:15:05.021 --> 00:15:08.740
your face,
he jumps in,
he saves you,
right?

245
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.960
They have an Andy.
Um,
so once again,

246
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.480
<v 1>thanks to everybody over there had a fucking awesome time as always.
And uh,</v>

247
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.201
all right.
Oh,

248
00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:23.000
let's get to the big fucking thing of this week that affected my life.

249
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.760
The big controversy,
the big blowback

250
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.670
<v 0>in this comedy climate that we live in,</v>

251
00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.930
which obviously what I'm talking about and I've kind of been dancing around it

252
00:15:34.931 --> 00:15:37.240
for the first 14 minutes,
uh,

253
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.840
cause I've been debating about whether or not to talk about this and just throw

254
00:15:40.841 --> 00:15:45.400
more gas on the fire or just let it burn itself out.
Of course,

255
00:15:45.401 --> 00:15:50.401
what I am talking about is ESPN retracting their statements and apologizing to

256
00:15:51.881 --> 00:15:56.590
the New England Patriots at 1220 in the fucking morning.
Can you fuck,

257
00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.520
<v 1>can you fucking believe that it's ESPN?</v>

258
00:16:00.521 --> 00:16:04.030
Not the biggest bunch of fucking pussies ever.
First of all,

259
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:09.060
they reported a story that was retracted in 2007 and it's that classic one that,

260
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:10.780
oh,

261
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:15.760
some guy heard a rumor that somebody said that the Patriots filmed the rams

262
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:20.530
walkthrough before the Superbowl.
That story came from the Boston Herald.

263
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.620
It was retracted in like fucking 2007 according to the three seconds of fucking

264
00:16:25.691 --> 00:16:29.890
research that I did before I did this podcast.
Espn,

265
00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:31.750
I evidently recently repeated it.

266
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.500
<v 0>I never watch ESPN anymore.
Um,</v>

267
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.040
they,
somebody tweeted it to me.
That's how I actually know about this shit.
Um,

268
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.530
so I guess they,
they

269
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.220
<v 1>brought it up again is if it hadn't been retracted and proven false.</v>

270
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:53.430
So then they had egg on their face and rather than apologizing during the time

271
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.110
of day when they fucking first reported it,

272
00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.580
they did it quickly at 1220 in the fucking morning.
What?
A bunch of babies,

273
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.140
you know,
so there you go.
Everybody,
all you patriot haters.

274
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.040
Have you noticed all the,
all the paint peeling off your fucking arguments.

275
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.340
How about this?
How about this?

276
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.780
With the best fucking football team in the NFL for the last 15 years,

277
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.120
and we got the trophies in the rings to prove it.

278
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.370
<v 0>All right?
Other than that,</v>

279
00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.810
you can get on your knees and suck at giant fucking Dick with your bullshit

280
00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:26.800
fucking arguments.

281
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.660
<v 1>All of it from spygate right to deflate gate the film and practices,</v>

282
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:36.370
all of it is a bunch of fucking bullshit.
Spygate might be the worst one ever.

283
00:17:36.371 --> 00:17:37.900
If you ever do any research on it,

284
00:17:37.901 --> 00:17:41.530
and Google some of the best coaches in the league talking about filming other

285
00:17:41.531 --> 00:17:44.890
fucking teams,
putting buy an Oculus on him,

286
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:50.380
a veritable who's who of hall of fame coaches talking about doing it itself.

287
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.330
<v 0>Fuck all you guys and I can't hear you.</v>

288
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.070
I can't hear you anymore because I know you're just going to have to retract it

289
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:02.220
soon enough.
But by all means,
keep giving Seattle,

290
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:08.390
you know where their own owner fucks over his own fan base with the alleged

291
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.760
large beer in small beer building a stadium that makes his team sound louder

292
00:18:13.981 --> 00:18:18.980
than they actually are and all squeaky clean.
Fucking Pete Carroll.
Uh,

293
00:18:18.981 --> 00:18:22.080

there's a fucking altar boy for you.
I'm sure nothing.
You know,

294
00:18:22.081 --> 00:18:25.640
what did he got busted for doing something,
a little gamesmanship last year.

295
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.250
Having people report in to practice before they should have to try to get some

296
00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:33.630
extra advantage.
That's all right.
That's just cause he's so dedicated.
They're,

297
00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:35.700
they're not cheating out there now.
And I'm the Raiders.

298
00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:39.360
The cowboys as a couple of squeaky clean fucking franchise gave me a fucking

299
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:43.710
break.
Fuck all you guys.
Fuck all your fucking year.
Fuck all of you.

300
00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:48.840

305
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:07.014
fucking,

306
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:12.390
after they did a study and proved that it was a disadvantage and then they tried

307
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:15.990
to quickly take it down.
Oh,
you fucking horse.

308
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:21.330
Uh,

Everyone.

312
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.490
I gotta tell Ya.
A shaving the old way socks a lot.
It hurts.

313
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.580
You lather up with cheap phone wincing as hair is scraped from your sad little

314
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:49.551
face with those old worn out razors you won't throw away because they cost so

315
00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:51.990
much God damn money.
Well,

316
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:55.830
Everyone Dollar Shave Club sends amazing raises for just a few bucks.

317
00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:01.070
And when you use them with their members only doctor commies easy.

318
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.160
It's completely changes the game.
Forget foam.
This stuff is the real deal.

319
00:20:08.161 --> 00:20:11.460
It's magic.
Something happens when you put it on.

320
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:15.870
I feel it's hard to describe as my dick going up,
but it's um,

321
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:20.100
it feels amazing.
Don't stop.
It's the most gentle,

322
00:20:20.101 --> 00:20:23.280
peaceful shave imaginable.
You barely know your shaving.

323
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:28.290
A other shaving products can leave your face feeling dry and tight.
It's awful.

324
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.310
But Dr cabbies,
easy shave butter is high quality stuff.

325
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.160

It's got organic.

All natural ingredients like pear cactus and black willow bark.

327
00:20:38.461 --> 00:20:39.300
So whatever you do,

328
00:20:39.301 --> 00:20:44.250
don't put it on your Dick so your skin feels smooth and fresh and moisturize

329
00:20:44.251 --> 00:20:48.310

Um,
speaking of fucking me undies,

390
00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:40.500
I went and visited a friend of mine today down on Manhattan beach and I have a

391
00:24:40.501 --> 00:24:43.170
number of friends that have recently moved out there and they keep telling me,

392
00:24:43.171 --> 00:24:46.920
oh dude,
you gotta fucking move out here.
It's awesome.
You know,

393
00:24:46.921 --> 00:24:50.640
you can walk around,
everything's fucking cool.
First Time I go down there,

394
00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.620
there's this crazy homeless guy,
right,
who will just be walking around Madrid.

395
00:24:55.621 --> 00:25:00.621
And then out of nowhere he just fucking yell so loud and like throw this crazy

396
00:25:00.661 --> 00:25:04.080
punch in every time.
It scared the fuck out of me.
And I knew it was coming.

397
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.960
He'd be just walking,
but no,

398
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.160
he just kept on and he just fucking throw this punch.

399
00:25:11.161 --> 00:25:13.710
And every time it made me give me like a little fucking heart attack,

400
00:25:13.711 --> 00:25:18.570
like what's his face in Biloxi blues.
And um,
so I'm thinking all right,

401
00:25:18.571 --> 00:25:22.830
it's nighttime.
You know,
the beach is just like,
you know,
it just tree,

402
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:27.120
it just attracts so many fucking losers,
you know,

403
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:29.730
because their whole deal is like,
even if I fuck up,

404
00:25:29.731 --> 00:25:34.140
I can still survive and live outside,
curl up in the warm sand,

405
00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:38.470
you know what I mean?
So anyways,
um,
I'm walking down the today with my buddy,

406
00:25:38.471 --> 00:25:41.460
it's during the day and it's more like family time and I'm walking down the

407
00:25:41.461 --> 00:25:44.400
fucking street,
right?
And there's like these two fucking girls.

408
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.170
I don't know how old they were,

409
00:25:46.171 --> 00:25:50.460
but they didn't have any curves yet and they're wearing these bikinis and they

410
00:25:50.461 --> 00:25:55.461
got like three quarters of their ass that they don't even have yet hanging out

411
00:25:56.221 --> 00:26:00.770
of the back of it.
And I'm looking at my buddy and I'm going like,
dude,

412
00:26:00.771 --> 00:26:02.400
why are those little girls like,

413
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:07.360
they were like fucking 12 walking with the ashes.
What?

414
00:26:07.361 --> 00:26:09.830
What is,
what the fuck is wrong with parents today?

415
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.650
I want to walk up to the parents to just be like that.
That's okay with you.

416
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.020
Do you have a watch to catch a predator?
What the fuck are you doing?

417
00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.360
Could you put your kids' asses away please?

418
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.900
Fucking worst pair with it.
Literally should do they,

419
00:26:24.901 --> 00:26:27.840

I dunno what,

420
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.990
what are you fucking did dump a bucket of ice water over their parent's head and

421
00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.020
just scream.
Wake up.
You know,
people,

422
00:26:38.021 --> 00:26:42.970
if you have young children,
can you cover him up?
Jesus,

423
00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.470
that,
that was so creepy.

424
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.780
<v 3>It should have been in one of those fucking,
uh,</v>

425
00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.740
who's a guy who does it used to be a Calvin Klein,

426
00:26:50.741 --> 00:26:55.741
had the creepy fucking Prefuse bressant fucking kids like locked in the cellar,

427
00:26:56.141 --> 00:26:57.400
remember those fucking commercials.

428
00:26:57.401 --> 00:27:01.090
And there was like the guy off camera just being like,

429
00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:05.040
so what are you like to do for fun?
Oh yeah,

430
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:11.540
<v 0>those jeans are kind of fallen off your hips,
aren't they?
Fucking awful,</v>

431
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.100
awful commercial.
My favorite one ever.
Jim,

432
00:27:16.101 --> 00:27:20.390
the taxi driver that Donal Logue.
Did you ever see when he did,

433
00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.290
I can't find it,

434
00:27:21.291 --> 00:27:24.810
but he did a parody of that and he was sitting there with like his,

435
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:28.960
his pants have pulled down answering the questions as some creepy guy off.
Oh,

436
00:27:28.961 --> 00:27:32.660
it's fucking hilarious.
But then the latest American apparel,

437
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:34.541
you know,

438
00:27:34.541 --> 00:27:37.810
that creepy fucking failing you get if you're any sort of a human being,

439
00:27:37.811 --> 00:27:41.500
when you look at an American apparel ad,
you know,

440
00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:46.000
I actually tweeted about it one time.
You're pulling up to it and you know,

441
00:27:46.001 --> 00:27:49.360
he old man,
you're fucking pulling up with you.
Bad eyes going,
Jesus,

442
00:27:49.361 --> 00:27:54.130
look at the ass on that.
He's only 12 right?
That's the same thing.

443
00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.180
That's the same fucking field
today.
It's like,

444
00:27:58.181 --> 00:27:59.440
what the y?

445
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:04.450
Who's the fucking creep that makes a bay bathing suit for a little girl like

446
00:28:04.451 --> 00:28:08.180
that?
You know?
I don't know.

447
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.980
Whoever it is,
he,
he go,
he called,
he goes by uncle.

448
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.190
That's always a fucking,
that's always a dead giveaway,

449
00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.940
which somebody is in their forties they're not married.
Right.

450
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.420
And there's still hanging out with people half their age and each and the,
Oh,

451
00:28:23.421 --> 00:28:25.550
just call me fucking uncle,
whatever.

452
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.930
That's when you immediately have to leave and if there's any drink in the room,

453
00:28:29.931 --> 00:28:34.130
don't drink it.
Right.
My fucking nuts.
That's,

454
00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:37.190
that's just what I believe.
Parents,
I mean,
I,
who am I?

455
00:28:37.191 --> 00:28:39.620
I don't have any fucking kids.
I shouldn't say it,
but for the love of God,

456
00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.450
you know,
if your kids like,
you know,

457
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.450
if you add your kids' age,

458
00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:54.090
it's like under five,
you know,
one plus two,
three.

459
00:28:54.091 --> 00:28:56.340
You know what I'm saying?
That probably the math doesn't,

460
00:28:56.341 --> 00:28:58.530
I shouldn't use that math equation.
I'm too fucking dumped for that.

461
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.180
I'm just saying,
you know what the fuck I'm saying?

462
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.070
And then it makes you feel like a fucking creep.
It's like,

463
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.250
would you get that out of here please?
Horrific,

464
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:13.320
horrific parenting.
Um,
all right,
let's,
let's plow ahead here.

465
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.560
The fuck else was I going to talk about?
I think that's,

466
00:29:16.561 --> 00:29:20.160
that's it said all I have to,
I apologize lately,

467
00:29:20.161 --> 00:29:23.070
these fucking podcasts I have absolutely nothing to talk about because I've just

468
00:29:23.071 --> 00:29:27.740
been in a fucking edit room.
Um,
oh,
I can't tell you this.
Uh,

469
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.210
the drum lessons have been going fucking great.

470
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.960
Trying to get that molar method thing down.
Finally,

471
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.000
after all these goddamn years,

472
00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:41.001
let's see if I can actually a sign in and I cloud sign in at the fucking iCloud.

473
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.980
What the fuck is this thing now?
I can't even look at my photos.

474
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:52.270
Yeah,
Jesus.
Does anybody know what's,
what's,
what is better than the iPhone?

475
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.070
Well,
what's comparable to it?

476
00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:56.390
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

477
00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:57.830
<v 0>So anyways,
right now I'm going through that book,</v>

478
00:29:57.831 --> 00:30:01.820
the art of Bop drumming by John Riley and I'm just fucking with two,

479
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.070
two lines on one page and it's blowing my mind all the different ways you can

480
00:30:07.071 --> 00:30:11.180
play it.
So,
uh,
I'm going to have fun for the rest of the year here anyways.

481
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:12.080
We always,
who's getting it?

482
00:30:12.081 --> 00:30:14.240
Why don't I just fucking get to the Goddamn questions?

483
00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:18.050
I'll fucking go from there.
Um,
somebody sent me this thing,

484
00:30:18.051 --> 00:30:20.990
teams react to encyclopedias,
you know,

485
00:30:20.991 --> 00:30:23.480
cause they all grew up on computers and shit and they looking at him like,

486
00:30:23.481 --> 00:30:25.070
what the fuck are these ed a,

487
00:30:25.071 --> 00:30:28.160
I really wanted to laugh at them that they didn't understand or thought

488
00:30:28.161 --> 00:30:29.630
encyclopedias were stupid,
but they,

489
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:34.460
if it's 20 seconds into it as I was just like,
this is what I sound like,

490
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:39.950
what I'm trying to use an iPhone or any sort of computer so I can't make fun of

491
00:30:39.951 --> 00:30:43.150
them.
Right.
That wouldn't be fair.
And to be honest with you,

492
00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.920
I understood encyclopedias and I sucked at those two.

493
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:49.000
That was a big deal though.

494
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:52.360
If you were any sort of a fucking nerd man and you got to encyclopedias,

495
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.220
then they came out with more specific ones,

496
00:30:54.221 --> 00:30:55.990
like ones that were just dedicated to sports.

497
00:30:55.991 --> 00:31:00.310
I would fucking read those all God Damn Day,
all God damn day in and like,

498
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.430
you know,
my parents and everybody would get them get mad.
Like,

499
00:31:03.431 --> 00:31:05.440
what are you going to get out of that fuck?
What are you gonna get out of that?

500
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:07.443
It's like,
I don't know,

501
00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.820
maybe someday there'll be a 24 hours sports networks that I could get a job and

502
00:31:12.821 --> 00:31:16.360
make millions of dollars a year and say things that aren't true and then

503
00:31:16.361 --> 00:31:17.740
retracted at one in the morning,

504
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.370
support a coke habit and get some whores.
I mean,
who knows?
I did it.

505
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.290
There's all kinds of shit that could happen here.
Um,

506
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.640
but watching that just took me back to those days of having to do fucking book

507
00:31:30.641 --> 00:31:33.520
reports and all of that.
Oh my God,
book report.

508
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:35.860
Now he's just waiting to do it.

509
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:39.730
There was always that fucking kid that just had the fucking ability to just go

510
00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:41.830
home,
read the book and get it done.

511
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:48.710
Just get on with their life.
I would just sit there staring at the book,

512
00:31:48.711 --> 00:31:51.060
walking by it every day.
Like it was like a,

513
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.000
I dunno Medusa's head like,
oh,

514
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.310
I was going to turn to stone if I fucking looked at the thing.
I really wished I,

515
00:31:57.311 --> 00:31:59.950
you know,
if I could go back and do my life over again,

516
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:04.510
there's just so much shit that I just would've faced immediately and just gotten

517
00:32:04.511 --> 00:32:09.070
it over with from fucking ass.
Kickings two book reports

518
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.470
to the molder method,
playing drums,

519
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.280
just sitting down and dedicating fucking three months in my life to get a little

520
00:32:18.281 --> 00:32:22.690
bit of muscle memory so that it slides in eventually to my plane and just say,

521
00:32:22.691 --> 00:32:26.530
okay,
the next three months are going to fucking suck with.

522
00:32:26.531 --> 00:32:29.620
It's going to be slow increments of growth.
And when I come out the other side,

523
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.000
I'm going to be really excited.
But I just wish I had that when I was a kid.
And,

524
00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:38.590
um,
it's something that I've slowly developed as I've gotten older,

525
00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:41.850
especially once you get out of school and you actually get to start choosing

526
00:32:41.851 --> 00:32:46.110
things that you want to do as opposed to having to do,
um,

527
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:51.630
you know,
get my helicopter license and shit like that.
Um,
you know,

528
00:32:51.631 --> 00:32:53.220
back in the day that would have just ate me up.

529
00:32:53.221 --> 00:32:56.880
I would've saw all his assignments and be like,
Hey,
I have to remember shit.

530
00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:58.260
Fuck this man.

531
00:32:58.261 --> 00:33:02.220
And I would just try and make people laugh in the fucking class and then that

532
00:33:02.221 --> 00:33:05.340
would be at next thing.
And I was in summer school with a pouty look on my face.

533
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.300
Like I wasn't there because of me.
Like somehow I had been fucking wrong.

534
00:33:09.301 --> 00:33:12.330
So anyways,
I'm,
what the fuck I'm talking about it here.

535
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:15.720
But if you can develop that,
you know,

536
00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:20.190
on any fucking level,
it makes your day so much less stressful.

537
00:33:20.191 --> 00:33:23.220
You have to just make a list of shit you have to get done and you wake up and

538
00:33:23.221 --> 00:33:27.210
you just do it and then you look and it's like fucking 1130 in the morning,

539
00:33:27.211 --> 00:33:29.640
you got the whole rest of your day.
You know,

540
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.350
that's a great way to spend your day.

541
00:33:31.351 --> 00:33:34.380
And it's also a great way to actually develop a drinking problem because then he

542
00:33:34.381 --> 00:33:37.710
got the whole fucking day.
You got no responsibility.

543
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:39.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

544
00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.730
<v 0>Mine as well get shit faced.
Right.
Speaking of posing,</v>

545
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:49.370
oh,
I miss it.
I do want,
I don't,
I miss it at night.
I don't miss it.
Turn the,
uh,

546
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.340
in the morning hours or when I step on the scale,
I don't miss it,

547
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.900
but I have to tell you this.
Um,
and you can call me a snob.

548
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.490
My wife is totally into that American greed.
And,
uh,

549
00:34:04.491 --> 00:34:08.210
one of the things that I find these guys constantly spending money on,

550
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.240
we're just blowing money on is doing like thousand dollars shots of Cognac,

551
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.990
Cognac,
however the fuck you say it.
And um,

552
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.250
me and Jason Law had did $100 shots one time.

553
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:27.290
One time we said,
fuck it.
We both did a show.
You know,
I had sold some posters,

554
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:31.010
he sold some fucking cds and we had some merchant money and we were just like,

555
00:34:31.011 --> 00:34:34.580
fuck it,
let's just take the march money.
Let's blow it on one shot.

556
00:34:34.581 --> 00:34:39.020
Let's fucking tastes a shit.
And it was unbelievable.
And um,

557
00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.830
you know,
unlike whiskeys that seem to only go up to about,
I don't know,
20,

558
00:34:43.831 --> 00:34:48.120
25 years like bourbons,
like those cognacs can go.
I mean,
as far as I know,

559
00:34:48.121 --> 00:34:50.670
I saw some on the Internet cause I was looking him up.

560
00:34:50.671 --> 00:34:54.960
They went back hundreds of years.
Is that true?
I know wind can go back like that,

561
00:34:54.961 --> 00:34:57.150
but,
uh,
I was wondering,

562
00:34:57.151 --> 00:35:02.151
anybody out there currently embezzling money from a company and can recommend,

563
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.930
you know,
obviously I'm not going to do $1,000 shot,

564
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:14.460
but can you recommend some,
uh,
you know,

565
00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:17.610
dipping my toe in the water for when I come off to sink?

566
00:35:17.611 --> 00:35:18.900
Because as you were hearing this,

567
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:24.230
I'm 50 days in to my 72 day stay of a no fucking alcohol.

568
00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:29.840
Marty,
50 days in,
a little quick.
It goes.
Um,

569
00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.050
so when I come out of it,
man,
I would really love to,
uh,

570
00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.010
I would really love to,
um,

571
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.010
try something like that because with that shit,

572
00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.760
if you're just sitting there like,
I remember when they poured the shot,

573
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.610
I was almost afraid I was going to spill it.

574
00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:53.320
I forget how old was like 60 years old.
I'm like,
Oh my God,
this is like,

575
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:54.820
<v 2>okay.</v>

576
00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.590
<v 0>I forget how old I was at the time.
I was like,
this,</v>

577
00:35:56.591 --> 00:35:58.750
this is like 15 years older than me.

578
00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.860
Like this thing was put into the barrel.

579
00:36:02.861 --> 00:36:07.330
Whatever they do when like Harry Truman was still in the,
like,

580
00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:12.160
he was just like,
I can't no,
it,
it's true.
Early.
It was Truman in early fifties,

581
00:36:12.161 --> 00:36:15.580
I think.
Yeah,
the early fifties.
I think Truman was an office,
right?

582
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:21.400
Um,
well,
let's see.
He finished World War Two dropped the bomb.

583
00:36:21.401 --> 00:36:25.560
That was like 46,
19 slash Jesus Christ.

584
00:36:25.561 --> 00:36:27.180
Be able to fucking Internet's right in front of you.

585
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:29.910
Can you stop torture in the Goddamn listeners?

586
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:33.390
Who the fuck was president in 1952?
I'm going with Truman.

587
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.470
I thought it went FDR,
Truman and Eisenhower.

588
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.110
Um,
you as

589
00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:49.020
president night t 52 and it is Harry.

590
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.640
Yes.
Strobic go fuck yourself.
Bam.

591
00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:58.690
That guy looks like somebody I wouldn't fuck with man.

592
00:36:58.691 --> 00:37:01.000
There's just something about those round rim glasses.

593
00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.013
You know what he looks like?

594
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.230
He looks like the actor that played the warden in the fucking Shawshank

595
00:37:05.231 --> 00:37:06.370
redemption,
doesn't he?

596
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.560
Or if he called up Japan after he dropped the second one.

597
00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:15.670
Do you like that second one or am I being obtuse?
Um,

598
00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:20.050
anyways,
the fuck am I talking about?

599
00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:24.090
What am I talking about?
I'm talking about the Cognac.
Um,

600
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.290
I was almost afraid to fucking spill it.

601
00:37:26.291 --> 00:37:29.140
And then also you didn't want to drink it really fast.

602
00:37:29.141 --> 00:37:30.550
You wanted to like savor it.

603
00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.540
So I'm thinking when I go back to Busan,

604
00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:39.070
so I'm not Bingo,
Bang,
Bang,
go in the whole fucking time.

605
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.280
I'm actually just sipping it nice and slow,

606
00:37:42.281 --> 00:37:46.090
like nice and slow shade as a way to do it.
Nation,
Chabot,

607
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:48.990
um,
for instance.
So,
um,

608
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.510
for those of you who are my age and that you would like way the fuck is that

609
00:37:52.511 --> 00:37:54.340
from where the fuck is that from?
I don't want to torture you.

610
00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.720
That was the front of the Fred Flintstone episode.
When Fred got mugged

611
00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.290
and the guy was telling him the reach in to grab his stegosaurs wallet.
Right.

612
00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:07.100
And he's going nice and slow.
She dashed away.

613
00:38:07.101 --> 00:38:10.060
You doing nice and slow.

614
00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:12.850
Remember the guns like the barrel was made out of a,

615
00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:17.400
like a hollowed out tree branch.
And then you just with the,
I dunno,

616
00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:20.680
the tendon of a bird.
You stretched back to fucking rock.

617
00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.540
I guess that would kill you back then.
I had no idea.

618
00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.200
Did you know the Caveman's had pistols?
I love the fucking cave man diet,

619
00:38:26.201 --> 00:38:30.910
by the way,
ever educate me a diet.
This is what caveman ate.
Yeah.
Yeah.

620
00:38:30.911 --> 00:38:32.870
They probably ate worms and they ate ants.

621
00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:37.440
They probably ate anything that they could fucking the goddamn hands on the

622
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:38.830
dirty filthy hands.

623
00:38:38.831 --> 00:38:41.980
And then they died of some intestinal virus when they were like 15.

624
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.480
You know,
I love the caveman diet.
Like,
who the fuck knows what they ate?

625
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:51.590
Did they draw a picture of it on the inside of a cave out of,
fuck.

626
00:38:51.591 --> 00:38:52.530
Do you know what that is?

627
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:57.780
They should call that our guests have the caveman diet.

628
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.740
All right,
well let's see.
We know Fritos weren't around back then.

629
00:39:01.741 --> 00:39:05.830
Cross those off the list.
Like,

630
00:39:05.831 --> 00:39:10.600
do you honestly think that there was like,
like where the fuck was cantaloupe?

631
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:17.180
Where was an avocado?
What the fuck was any of that shit?
It is walking around.

632
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:18.650
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

633
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:22.480
<v 0>Try not to get eaten.
You grab a stick,
you stabbed.</v>

634
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:26.960
So I would think that you're eating fucking roadkill.

635
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.130
<v 2>Okay.</v>

636
00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.980
<v 0>Yeah.
Hot and shit.
And then you just eat and stuff.</v>

637
00:39:30.981 --> 00:39:34.640
You stick in your slam and you're facing a stream.
Right?

638
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:40.120
Trying to be up river of somebody else who's down there with his fucking

639
00:39:40.121 --> 00:39:43.840
prehistoric Goddam balls and tainting the fucking water.

640
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.220
I Dunno.
Who knows what the fuck they,

641
00:39:47.221 --> 00:39:50.760
and I'm so sick of people telling me about the goddamn caveman diet as a caveman

642
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:55.330
diet.
I have an egg over easy.
Um,

643
00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:56.810
all right,
let's get on with the,

644
00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.930
let's go on with the questions here for this week.
Uh,
lady,
Fan Lady.

645
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.380
Hey ladies.
Hey there,
Bill.

646
00:40:04.381 --> 00:40:08.850
I'm a lady fan and am exciting,
excited what?

647
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.650
And m seeing you for the first time in Chicago in October.
So excited.

648
00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:15.180
See,
my brain does,
it's,

649
00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:18.960
it's reading one sentence while it's looking at words and the next line below.

650
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:20.850
I don't want,
my fucking problem is here.

651
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:24.150
My husband has been acting weird about us coming to see your show.

652
00:40:24.151 --> 00:40:27.690
I think it's because a few weeks ago we were watching one of your specials and I

653
00:40:27.691 --> 00:40:30.960
said,
you are my celebrity crush out.
Jesus.

654
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:36.260
My husband chose Scarlet Johannson Nice fucking choice.

655
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.110
I liked this guy.
Of course I would never cheat on my husband,

656
00:40:40.111 --> 00:40:42.270
but I'm afraid if I enjoy your show too much,

657
00:40:42.271 --> 00:40:45.780
he's going to give me a side eye look or bring it up later.

658
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:47.790
Can you please put his mind at ease?

659
00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:49.753
<v 4>MMM.</v>

660
00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.650
<v 0>Why do I have to put his mind at ease?</v>

661
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:56.950
Why don't you quit picking people that are attainable?

662
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:03.900
P What?
Scarlet Johannson this nowhere.

663
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.530
There's no way he's going to get anywhere near her.

664
00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:11.120
You picked some fucking dope that tells Dick Jokes in a strip mall.

665
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.400
No wonder he's looking at you fucked up.

666
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:17.600
How dare you make a fucking mess and then tell me to mop it up.

667
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:19.490
What is in it for me?

668
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.113
<v 4>MMM.</v>

669
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:26.810
<v 0>What are we talking about?
I,
you know,
I'm not,
I don't put him at ease.</v>

670
00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.960
What are you going to do?
Run up on the stage.

671
00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:34.190
I'm going to do the show and then I'm fine.
I'll be out the out the fucking

672
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.360
<v 1>door because I'm drinking again.
Ah,
baby,</v>

673
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:39.740
I'm drinking again.

674
00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.040
<v 3>Right.
I Dunno,</v>

675
00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:48.900
<v 1>you shouldn't have said that.
Like,
look,
if my wife,</v>

676
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:53.820
if I asked her what is her celebrity crush and she says,
Brad Pitt,

677
00:41:53.821 --> 00:41:56.880
she says,
fucking Denzel or I don't give a fuck.

678
00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.320
She might as well be picking a man on the moon.

679
00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:02.003
<v 3>Right.</v>

680
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.410
<v 1>But uh,
she named like a fucking comedian</v>

681
00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:10.410
that performs at the comedy store like I do.
Yeah.
I would be like,
well,

682
00:42:10.411 --> 00:42:13.030
what the fuck you could,

683
00:42:13.031 --> 00:42:16.900
you could bang that person while I was on stage the next time at the store.
Yeah.

684
00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:22.210
So that's on you sweetheart.
What you should say is id.
Oh,
did I say Bill Burr?

685
00:42:22.211 --> 00:42:27.190
I met Raymond Berg.
Yes.
The dead fat guy.
Yeah,
that guy.
That's,

686
00:42:27.191 --> 00:42:31.570
that's what I'm so why was I saying,
why was I saying or a Billy Bush?

687
00:42:31.571 --> 00:42:36.410
That's what I meant.
High on belly.
Um,

688
00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:41.530
all right,
close the thing with,
uh,
you know,

689
00:42:41.531 --> 00:42:44.620
I just want to have a good time at your show without worrying about him being

690
00:42:44.621 --> 00:42:48.940
weird.
You created the weirdness.
Um,
all right.

691
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.990
Okay.
Being a landlord from a lady,
this is two,
two letters from a lady.

692
00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:58.880
This is a fucking a,
this is a record here,
dear Billy butter cheeks.
Uh,

693
00:42:58.881 --> 00:43:01.250
you've been talking about becoming a landlord lately.

694
00:43:01.251 --> 00:43:03.740
So I thought I'd write to you about what it's like to be one.

695
00:43:03.741 --> 00:43:07.580
Please don't step on my dream.
Okay?
I,
before I even read this,

696
00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.630
I know that if it's as big a nightmare is everybody claims it would be,

697
00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:16.320
no one would be a fucking landlord.
All right?
All right.
First,

698
00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:18.720
know that your property will be destroyed.

699
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.760
You need to prepare yourself to watch it get trashed over and over again because

700
00:43:23.761 --> 00:43:28.540
your tenants either by negligence,
by ignorance,
parentheses,

701
00:43:28.541 --> 00:43:30.960
not letting you know when something's wrong,
until it's very,

702
00:43:30.961 --> 00:43:34.260
very wrong or in spite when they vacate,

703
00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:38.910
the feeling of seeing your property ruined over and over again sucks and it's

704
00:43:38.911 --> 00:43:43.470
expensive.
Second,
someday you will have to evict somebody.

705
00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:47.610
That sounds easy,
but it's not.
Especially for anybody with the heart.

706
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:52.650
And I know you have a big heart.
You can't hide it from me.
I'm from Ohio.
Uh,

707
00:43:52.651 --> 00:43:56.730
the first time someone bursts into tears upon being served an eviction notice

708
00:43:56.731 --> 00:44:00.120
and spins this sob story,
well,
you might not believe them.

709
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:02.220
You might go ahead and a victim,

710
00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:04.860
but you will forever wonder if you did the right thing.

711
00:44:04.861 --> 00:44:07.950
And if it's an elderly person or a disabled veteran,
forget it.

712
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:12.720
How can you do that?
You can't.
Um,
yeah,
there's no way I could do that.
Uh,

713
00:44:12.721 --> 00:44:16.680
I own properties in Seattle and Portland and with all the Californians fleeing

714
00:44:16.681 --> 00:44:21.030
the drought,
they were only,
they were on a wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.

715
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.330
They were only going to appreciate and value,
but climate change,

716
00:44:25.331 --> 00:44:27.730
refugees are going to be desperate people.

717
00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.890
And I didn't want to take advantage of their plight.

718
00:44:29.891 --> 00:44:33.300
I didn't want to become that person.
Someone will no doubt,
but it won't be me.

719
00:44:33.301 --> 00:44:35.730
I don't have the heart.
So think about it twice.

720
00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:36.870
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

721
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:37.171
<v 1>sure.</v>

722
00:44:37.171 --> 00:44:42.120
It seems like easy money and sociopath's will tell you it's no sweat with a good

723
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:46.290
lawyer,
but you have to be very detached emotionally.
I wasn't capable of that.

724
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:50.550
So I sold out.
There are so many other ways to invest your money.
Just my 2 cents.

725
00:44:50.551 --> 00:44:55.470
I'm a lady,
so feel free to toss in this,
to toss this in the trash.

726
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:59.910
C'Mon.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Uh,
all right.

727
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.540
Um,
all right.

728
00:45:04.541 --> 00:45:07.450
Well it seems like you didn't have the heart so he got out of it.
Uh,
yeah,

729
00:45:07.451 --> 00:45:11.950
that would hurt me if people fucked it up.
Whenever I fucked up.
I had a dog,

730
00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.050
I have a dog and she fucked it all up.

731
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:18.160
And before I left I got everything fixed and they were really surprised.

732
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.390
Um,
cause when I went to move out,
they were like going,
yeah.
Uh,

733
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.280
but before we move out we need to inspect that damage cause somebody came over

734
00:45:25.281 --> 00:45:27.900
and fixed the sink,
saw all the damage,

735
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:31.630
like the wood moldings and that type of shit.
And one of the windows,
uh,
for,

736
00:45:31.631 --> 00:45:35.340
with my dog with its separating separation anxiety tore it all up.

737
00:45:35.341 --> 00:45:38.940
But I had it all fixed before I left out of respect.

738
00:45:38.941 --> 00:45:43.941
And then also knowing that landlords will go down to Home Depot and spent 20

739
00:45:44.221 --> 00:45:49.050
bucks and then charge me my entire fucking deposit.
So,
uh,

740
00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:53.250
I eliminated that from the equation.
Um,
I'm still going to become a landlord.

741
00:45:53.251 --> 00:45:57.660
I think it's a great fucking investment and I do have the heart to give people a

742
00:45:57.661 --> 00:46:01.210
break.
And I also think I know when someone's bullshitting me,
um,

743
00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.710
yeah.
You know what I mean?
Pay fucking rent or beat it.

744
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.750
You got to get in that mindset.
You know,
I think it is,

745
00:46:08.751 --> 00:46:12.350
I think people who really are landlords and don't give a fuck and look at shit

746
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.040
is bricks,

747
00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:17.150
bricks and mortar and our black and white probably do the best in that business.

748
00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:20.840
And uh,
so I think you got to do that.
You know what I mean?

749
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:23.840
You got to watch the movie heat and listened to the narrow talk about how you

750
00:46:23.841 --> 00:46:26.600
gotta be willing to walk away at any second.
You know,

751
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:29.420
you gotta be willing to evict somebody and just fucking walk away.

752
00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:33.940
All right bill.
Okay.
Thank you for doing the podcast.

753
00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:36.120
Easy for people to take that out.
Dah,
Dah.

754
00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:40.960
You could be a little more reliable uploading Thursdays though,
but I can't.

755
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:46.660
Um,
all right,
here we go.
Actually fucked up.

756
00:46:46.661 --> 00:46:48.790
That guy's joke.
He was trying to act like he was going to be cool here.

757
00:46:48.791 --> 00:46:49.870
Thank you for doing the podcast.

758
00:46:49.871 --> 00:46:53.050
Easy for people to take for granted slash bust your balls on Twitter,

759
00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:56.770
but know that they are appreciated.
Uh,
the podcasts are appreciated.
Uh,

760
00:46:56.771 --> 00:46:59.380
you could be a little more reliable uploading Thursdays though,

761
00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.550
still being a cut.
All right.

762
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:04.420
I've been steadily losing my hair for the last couple of years.

763
00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:07.870
It's getting to the point where I'm thinking each haircut might be the last

764
00:47:07.871 --> 00:47:11.440
before I start buzzing it all kind of crossing my fingers that this still a

765
00:47:11.441 --> 00:47:14.920
comprehensive head of hair.
When the barbers sprints the chair round.

766
00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:18.700
I've common as close as I can to making peace with the life of baldness.

767
00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:23.730
Not thrilled about being here at 30 and women's slash guys with with hair don't

768
00:47:24.671 --> 00:47:28.090
really get what a bummer it can be,
but what are you going to do?
My question,

769
00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:30.460
how do I talk about this with my wife?

770
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:35.470
We have discussed it what we haven't discussed at whatsoever as she is able to

771
00:47:35.471 --> 00:47:39.070
sense my discomfort with the topic and has never tried to force the dialogue.

772
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:43.150
My wife and I have an honest relationship and I'm openly discussed topics much

773
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:47.650
more awkward with actual real world ramifications.
All right,

774
00:47:47.651 --> 00:47:49.180
so you've talked about having a threesome.

775
00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:56.173
<v 3>Ah,</v>

776
00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:59.380
<v 1>all right.
It's also not like she can't see the hairlines going,</v>

777
00:47:59.381 --> 00:48:03.040
but I've built up a whole awkward wall around the topic and I'm not sure how to

778
00:48:03.041 --> 00:48:04.000
slice through it.

779
00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.200
Did you have any conversations with Nia prior to hacking off?

780
00:48:08.201 --> 00:48:12.790
What was left to your hair?
Any words of wisdom from the post buzz world?
Uh,

781
00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:16.510
hoping to catch you at a future?
Steve Allen theater slash comedy store Gig.

782
00:48:16.511 --> 00:48:21.100
Best of luck at Madison Square Garden.
Thank you very much.
Uh,
yeah,

783
00:48:21.101 --> 00:48:24.850
it was actually me as idea cause I kind of wanted to do it.

784
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:25.990
<v 3>Okay.</v>

785
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:29.270
<v 1>And uh,
she was like,
you should do it.
You should do it as like,
ah,
man,
I hope,</v>

786
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.570
you know,
cause the big thing is what kind of head do I have?

787
00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:35.350
Because you don't want to have that flat fucking thing in the back.

788
00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:36.720
You know what I mean?
We,

789
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:41.320
the back of your head goes straight into your fucking neck.
Um,

790
00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:46.480
so I started saying that I was going to do it and she just kept fucking singing

791
00:48:46.481 --> 00:48:50.770
this song,
uh,
data.
I've got to bring her right here.

792
00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:55.040
She kept saying,
she goes,
shaved your head,
shaved,
go head.
Come on now.

793
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:59.230
<v 0>Every time I would walk by and then she just yelled,
shave it.
Just do it.</v>

794
00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.060
Fucking shape it.
Hold on a second.
See if I can get her in here.

795
00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:06.040
<v 3>Come here.
I need you on the clock that</v>

796
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:14.430
I gotta I gotta I gotta bring this,
uh,
I got to bring this one back

797
00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:19.690
<v 0>guy.
Right?
He's losing his hair.
He's like 30 years old.</v>

798
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:22.330
All right.
He's almost to the point where he's going to,

799
00:49:22.331 --> 00:49:26.080
he's going to shave his head and he was saying Calc,
cause I did it.

800
00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:29.800
You know what I mean?
He doesn't see,
but he doesn't talk about it with his wife.

801
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.670
And she knows that he's sensitive.
So as he's built like this awkward wall,

802
00:49:33.671 --> 00:49:36.670
but it's just totally obvious.
And they were saying,

803
00:49:36.671 --> 00:49:40.360
did you ever have a conversation with Nia about shaving my head?
And if,

804
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:43.590
as far as I remember,
it was your idea,
right?
It was,
you know,

805
00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:44.950
that song used to sing.

806
00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.020
<v 3>Okay.</v>

807
00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:48.780
<v 1>No,
Dave,
your head shave,
shave your head.</v>

808
00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:52.100
<v 0>Yeah.
And I would laugh.</v>

809
00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:56.660
I forgot about that.
Yeah.
And then I finally went ahead and did it.

810
00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:59.330
I will tell you this,
when was the first time,

811
00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:00.710
I don't want to get me to come over here.

812
00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:05.330
When was it that you did it for the first time?
How long ago?
Get on the mic here.

813
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.310
About nine years ago.
It was the first time I did and then when I did date night,

814
00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:15.080
they asked me to grow it back and I was like,
and I was like,
I was like going,

815
00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:17.420
well there's not much to grow back.
And they were like,
yeah,

816
00:50:17.421 --> 00:50:19.970
we'll fill it in and we'll fill it in or whatever.
So I was like,
all right.

817
00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:23.240
And then I grew it back and then I kept it for a while because I started

818
00:50:23.241 --> 00:50:27.050
thinking like,
this is why I'm getting a acting,

819
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.830
which is the dumbest thing you can do.
Right.
It's not because of my skills,

820
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:35.090
it's because my hair.
Yeah.
Balding,
which was stupid.

821
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:39.200
And um,
I will tell it's the greatest fucking thing.

822
00:50:39.201 --> 00:50:41.330
If your body is the greatest fucking thing you'll ever do.

823
00:50:41.331 --> 00:50:44.660
And I'm actually reading Andre Agassi's book where he was talking about,

824
00:50:44.661 --> 00:50:48.890
I didn't know he wore a fucking hairpiece and one time he was in the shower

825
00:50:48.891 --> 00:50:53.000
before the French Open final and he was in the shower and his whole hairpiece

826
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:56.030
came apart so they had to fucking glue the thing back together.

827
00:50:56.031 --> 00:50:57.560
So he went out in the court and played this guy.

828
00:50:57.561 --> 00:50:58.580
He could have beaten the whole time.

829
00:50:58.581 --> 00:51:01.160
He was worried that his fucking hair piece was going to come flying off like a

830
00:51:01.161 --> 00:51:05.180
three stooges episode,
you know,
fucking embarrassing.
That would've been,

831
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:10.190
that would've been terrible.
Yeah.
He,
he talks about how,
uh,

832
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:14.060
I guess Brooke Shields finally convinced him to do it and he did it and then he

833
00:51:14.061 --> 00:51:16.130
felt great.
Yeah,
I will tell you that it's the greatest,

834
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:18.800
it's the greatest thing ever.
The greatest fucking thing.

835
00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.860
<v 1>You could add all these fucking guys going out and,</v>

836
00:51:21.861 --> 00:51:24.980
and like fucking slicing up the back of their heads.

837
00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:28.310
I have in the shit vacuumed out and then paratrooped on top of their head.

838
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:33.440
Like most of that shit.
It works for a minute.

839
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:36.230
But then the thing is,
is like those,
they go,

840
00:51:36.231 --> 00:51:40.250
the hairs in the back of your head don't,
um,

841
00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.220
those things never fall out.
So if you put them on the top of your head,

842
00:51:43.221 --> 00:51:44.820
then you're okay.
But the thing is,

843
00:51:44.821 --> 00:51:47.990
is you still have all that other hair up there that's gonna fall out so that

844
00:51:47.991 --> 00:51:50.690
shit falls out and then you need more fucking replacements.

845
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:56.000
And then sometimes you can actually,
it can like not work as far as I know.

846
00:51:56.330 --> 00:52:01.310
So I'm a big fucking,
uh,
I dunno.
I'm a big,

847
00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:04.300
I think it's a fucking way better move.

848
00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:05.900
<v 2>Okay.</v>

849
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:09.360
<v 1>I actually say it's the man move.
You fucking dealing with the,</v>

850
00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:12.500
the hand you've been dealt.
You just do it.
This is what I look like.
People go,

851
00:52:12.501 --> 00:52:13.910
what the fuck for a few days?

852
00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.910
And then they think you look w when they see pictures of you with hair,

853
00:52:16.911 --> 00:52:21.770
they think you'll look weird and then you're free.
You fucking free.

854
00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:25.850
So rather than going to the barber every time and putting your head down as he

855
00:52:25.851 --> 00:52:28.280
cuts it and then open your eyes going,
what does it look like now?

856
00:52:28.281 --> 00:52:31.520
Just fucking get it over with.
Get it over with dude.
Shave your fucking head.

857
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:33.060
What are you saying?
Nini?
It,

858
00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:36.610
<v 0>yeah,
shave it.
It's fucking awesome.
Then you love it.
And then what's great.</v>

859
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.740
No matter how late you wake up for work,

860
00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.230
you can just throw on clothes and get there.
No,
no,

861
00:52:41.231 --> 00:52:43.330
you didn't take a shower because you don't have bedhead anymore.

862
00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:48.910
Bye Bye.
All right.

863
00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.433
<v 2>Okay.</v>

864
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:53.170
<v 1>Hey should,
oh,
am I going to talk?
We're,
I mean,
yeah,</v>

865
00:52:53.171 --> 00:52:57.030
actually considering doing a project together.

866
00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:58.620
<v 2>Okay.</v>

867
00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:02.670
<v 1>Might write a book,
but it's not the kind of book you think.
It's not about us.</v>

868
00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:07.500
Um,
it was that dumb is that dumb.
Did get in a business,
the wife,
why would it be,

869
00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:08.603
you know what I mean?

870
00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

871
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:13.010
<v 1>I know.
You know I ever get divorced to take him for half.
I got,
so I might,</v>

872
00:53:13.011 --> 00:53:15.140
she might as well fucking be helping me create,
you know,

873
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:18.680
she could tell she's not in the room anymore.
All right,
let's,
let's read it.

874
00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.860
Let's read the last of the advertising.
Shavia had,
buddy,
you're gonna,

875
00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:26.070
you're gonna feel fucking great.
You will feel great.
And this is the thing,
dude,

876
00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:28.890
someday,
who knows?
And I'm going to lie to you someday.

877
00:53:28.891 --> 00:53:33.130
If they just came up with a fucking pill and you popped it in there and it made

878
00:53:33.131 --> 00:53:34.830
you,
gave you the shits for three days,

879
00:53:34.831 --> 00:53:38.790
but all of a sudden you fucking had this fucking great head of hair.
I,
you know,

880
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:43.080
even that I wouldn't do,
I'd wait 10 years to see how people fucking,
you know,

881
00:53:43.081 --> 00:53:44.220
if their livers fell out.

882
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.983
<v 2>Uh,</v>

883
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:51.740
<v 1>actually no,
I gotta be honest with you.
I'm a lifer with the shaved head.
I am,</v>

884
00:53:51.741 --> 00:53:56.420
I don't give a fuck.
What are you going to do?
You know,
this is what I look like.

885
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:57.283
Deal with it.

886
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:03.260
Another great thing is if you fucking shave your head,
people sometimes think,

887
00:54:03.261 --> 00:54:05.030
you know,
a little bit of mixed martial arts,

888
00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:08.630
but then they look at your perfect ears and they're like,
no,
he doesn't.
No,

889
00:54:08.631 --> 00:54:12.410
he does it.
Uh,
but that might be just enough time to give you to run away.

890
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:16.700
That's a true story.
All right.
A legal zoom,
everybody.
Um,

891
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:19.640
do you want the government to decide what happens to your property?

if you guys are going to go to a comedy club out here,

933
00:56:45.061 --> 00:56:46.740
you got to go down to the comedy store.
Man,

934
00:56:46.741 --> 00:56:50.370
they got a line around the block and I think I know why.

935
00:56:50.371 --> 00:56:52.200
Listen to this fucking lineup I was on.

936
00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:57.810
I went on on the main room Friday night and I walked in.

937
00:56:57.811 --> 00:57:02.811
Mark Marin was on stage who then brought up David spade who then brought up Joe

938
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:07.440
Rogan and then I had to go on after all of those fucking monsters.

939
00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:12.960
It's unbelievable,
dude.
The comedy store lately.

940
00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:15.210
It's get your ass down there.

941
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:20.880
Everybody's been fucking coming through and I'm just insane,

942
00:57:20.881 --> 00:57:23.820
insane fucking shows down there.
And it's fun.
You don't win.

943
00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:26.970
Rogan has been working out like a maniac on the,
on his fucking act.

944
00:57:26.971 --> 00:57:30.840
He was destroying in front of me.
You know,

945
00:57:30.841 --> 00:57:34.890
it's funny as a comic that's been doing it this long,
you know,

946
00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.290
I always watch Rogan,
but I was talking to somebody,

947
00:57:37.291 --> 00:57:41.430
but like subconsciously you're hearing the laughs and at one point he was

948
00:57:41.431 --> 00:57:45.750
getting this level of laughter that I had to end the conversation and then start

949
00:57:45.751 --> 00:57:47.250
making a set list.
I'm like,

950
00:57:47.251 --> 00:57:52.251
I just can't just walk on stage after this fucking mayhem that's going on out

951
00:57:53.341 --> 00:57:56.760
there.
I actually,
I need a game plan here.
Um,

952
00:57:57.630 --> 00:58:00.150
which is another fucking great reason to go down there.
You know what I mean?

953
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:03.540
All those guys pushing you.
Um,
all right,
let's get,

954
00:58:03.541 --> 00:58:08.400
let's read the last couple here.
Alright.
Bullied at work.
Hi,
Billy.
Buff boy.
Uh,

955
00:58:08.401 --> 00:58:13.260
I work in an office with several young females,
so several young ladies.

956
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.650
Um,
sounds good,
right?
Ron?

957
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:21.210
I'm the only young male here.
So what's wrong?

958
00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:26.370
They like to gang.
You said gain g a I n gain up on me.

959
00:58:26.371 --> 00:58:31.371
It's gang and g a n g gang up on me and constantly put me down or make fun of

960
00:58:32.671 --> 00:58:35.160
me.
It started out all fun and games,

961
00:58:35.161 --> 00:58:39.300
but some of them have recently become very aggressive and are almost verbally

962
00:58:39.301 --> 00:58:44.160
attacking me.
What,
what I don't understand.

963
00:58:44.161 --> 00:58:46.890
What is the problem here?
When I have brought it up to them,

964
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:51.180
it just made it worse and made me more of a target.
Yeah.
Dude,

965
00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:55.130
you never got bullied before.
The last thing you say to a bully is he,

966
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:58.830
what you're doing is really bothering me.
Just so you know.

967
00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:00.870
Uh,

968
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:05.730
what can I do to make this situation better without getting management involved?

969
00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:08.610
I don't want to get them fired or anything.
I just want,

970
00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:10.020
<v 2>yeah,</v>

971
00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:14.090
<v 1>I just don't want to be the female punching bag anymore.
Thanks.
Um,</v>

972
00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.800
I don't understand what is going on here.
What are they saying to you?

973
00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:21.010
If they're giving you shit,
you got to give him shit back.

974
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:26.120
You know what I mean?
Come on,
man.
Defeat in a fucking woman in a verbal thing.

975
00:59:26.121 --> 00:59:27.350
You know,
you know where you have to go,

976
00:59:27.351 --> 00:59:30.980
but he can't go there because then they're gonna rat you out to the boss.

977
00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:35.720
This is what you'd do.
Just walk in,

978
00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.713
<v 3>right.</v>

979
00:59:37.350 --> 00:59:39.090
<v 1>Just walk in with your eyes squinting</v>

980
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:41.303
<v 3>one day.</v>

981
00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:45.700
<v 1>You know,
looking like an idiot.
Just walking just in Blinken a lot.
Just squinting</v>

982
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:49.740
and walk right up to the one with the smallest chess.

983
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:55.543
<v 2>Okay.</v>

984
00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.260
<v 1>Don't do that.
I was going to say,
just do those.
She goes,
what are you doing?</v>

985
01:00:01.261 --> 01:00:02.730
Just go try to see your titties.

986
01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:04.383
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

987
01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:09.300
<v 1>that's so childish and stupid,
but unbelievably effective.</v>

988
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

989
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:13.060
<v 1>And I think,
I mean I'm not going to speak for women here,</v>

990
01:00:13.061 --> 01:00:17.290
but what I really think it is is women realize the unbelievable power that they

991
01:00:17.291 --> 01:00:19.090
have over guys with their looks.

992
01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:25.070
So if you ever indicate that there was a flaw in their looks or that they're

993
01:00:25.481 --> 01:00:29.690
starting to slip,
it really fucks with it.
It's too mean.
I,
dude,

994
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:33.040
I don't have fucking sympathy for you.
What did they just verbally abusing?
You?

995
01:00:33.041 --> 01:00:37.490
Give him shit back.
Give a,
what are they saying?

996
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:41.340
We're right back to me.
Right back to me.

997
01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:43.560
What the fuck or what are you one of those kids?

998
01:00:43.561 --> 01:00:48.430
Did you always wear a helmet when you ride a bicycle?
Did you have play dates?

999
01:00:48.431 --> 01:00:51.220
Are you part of that fucker generation,
dude?
Come on,
man.
Snap out of it.

1000
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:55.980
Yeah.
That's just how it would just be like,
Hey,
what?

1001
01:00:55.981 --> 01:00:59.860
What are you just going to stop being such something you got to do?

1002
01:00:59.861 --> 01:01:04.560
You've got to shoot something across the bottom.
You got to give him shit,

1003
01:01:04.561 --> 01:01:07.600
dude.
You got to give him shit.

1004
01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.020
Just point it whatever they're wearing and be like,
oh my God,

1005
01:01:13.021 --> 01:01:17.100
what did you get that?
And then just keep walking.
That's all you have to do.

1006
01:01:17.101 --> 01:01:21.850
That fucks up a woman's Day.
What do you mean by that?

1007
01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:25.930
Do I think you just give it back to them?
Just give it back to him,
dude,
I,

1008
01:01:25.931 --> 01:01:29.660
I don't you fucking grow a deck and give it back to a man.
Come on.

1009
01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:30.940
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1010
01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.890
<v 1>This is,
this is like this whole fucking thing.</v>

1011
01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:36.220
I'm guessing you're a younger person.
Oh,
you said a young male.
Yeah.

1012
01:01:36.221 --> 01:01:40.720
You've been completely beaten down to the point where you're now,

1013
01:01:40.721 --> 01:01:41.554
you know,

1014
01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:46.590
we went from men beating women with fucking mop handles a hundred fucking years

1015
01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.930
ago to now this,

1016
01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:52.690
this to the point of a complete overcorrection that you're going to sit here and

1017
01:01:52.691 --> 01:01:55.150
allow yourself to get verbally abused.

1018
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:56.700
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1019
01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:57.480
<v 1>Because they're women.</v>

1020
01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.180
I do like the fact that you don't want to be a rat and rat him out.

1021
01:02:00.181 --> 01:02:01.350
This is what you gotta do.
Okay.

1022
01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:05.260
Treat them with the same level of respect that treating you.
Uh,
the,

1023
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:09.870
I would avoid name calling and I would definitely not curse,
but other than that,

1024
01:02:09.871 --> 01:02:12.150
I would be just as fucking mean as they are.

1025
01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.180
I just do it.
It's so easy to fuck with.

1026
01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1027
01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:19.060
<v 1>The next time one of them says,</v>

1028
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.920
do you just offer some gum and just keep doing it?
And just being like,
listen,

1029
01:02:23.921 --> 01:02:26.150
I'm not trying to be a jerk.
I don't know what you've been eating late,

1030
01:02:26.151 --> 01:02:30.370
but I've noticed it over the last few days and just invent in their head that

1031
01:02:30.371 --> 01:02:33.820
they have this fucking halitosis it,
that's,
that's it.

1032
01:02:33.821 --> 01:02:38.020
And then you divide and conquer.
It's a joke dude.
It's not that fucking hard.

1033
01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.593
You know what I mean?

1034
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:45.770
Just tell them which one you think is the most attractive and why and let the

1035
01:02:45.771 --> 01:02:49.730
other two losers fucking deal with that and the other one will actually feel

1036
01:02:49.731 --> 01:02:51.140
good that you said it about her,

1037
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:54.380
so now she's not fucking with you and then the other two are pissed at the other

1038
01:02:54.381 --> 01:02:56.330
girl and then you got some infighting

1039
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.120
and don't bring it down to,
let's just say,
you know just you got to,

1040
01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.370
she has a certain level of class that the other two of you lack.

1041
01:03:06.371 --> 01:03:09.310
I'm not trying to be a jerk and he just fucking leave it nice and vague like

1042
01:03:09.311 --> 01:03:10.480
that.
That's all you do.

1043
01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:14.530
And all I'm doing is taking a page out of their book because women are masters

1044
01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:18.940
at that vague mind fuck.
And then walking away.

1045
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:20.410
It's a work of art.

1046
01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.110
I didn't even think they have to work at it and they just born with it.

1047
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:24.940
It's tremendous.

1048
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:26.260
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1049
01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:29.350
<v 0>I probably goes back in the day from when they were dragged around from cave the</v>

1050
01:03:29.351 --> 01:03:30.580
cave by their fucking hair.

1051
01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:35.670
<v 1>They had to say something that mind fuck the Harry Douche bag that was about</v>

1052
01:03:35.671 --> 01:03:38.790
ready to take advantage of them so they could walk away before he fucking

1053
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:42.660
dragged them into the cave.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

1054
01:03:42.661 --> 01:03:45.030
I'm just fucking talking all kinds of shit here.
All right,

1055
01:03:45.031 --> 01:03:47.040
let's wrap this thing up here.
Career advice,

1056
01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:50.550
dare bill of Burr.

1057
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.540
Ah,
that's a great one and accurate.

1058
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:57.950
<v 0>I've been a high school teacher for the past seven years,</v>

1059
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:04.860
but my dream has always to become a professional writer.
Oh,
that's awesome.

1060
01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:06.120
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1061
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.750
<v 0>You know,
dude,
that would be a great life.</v>

1062
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:11.720
You're molded some young minds and then you became a professional writer so far

1063
01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:15.130
I'd,
he said so far I don't have a teaching job for the upcoming school year.

1064
01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:19.330
I'm considering no longer having my own classes and instead becoming substitute

1065
01:04:19.331 --> 01:04:20.500
teacher for the school year.

1066
01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:24.970
This would give me more time to write and submit my work to literary agents and

1067
01:04:24.971 --> 01:04:26.680
hopefully get a big publishing deal.

1068
01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:30.550
I've had some success so far with writing a published short story and a

1069
01:04:30.551 --> 01:04:34.570
nomination for a literary prize.
Dude,
what the fuck are you waiting for?

1070
01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:35.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1071
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:38.700
<v 0>How many more signs of landing and neat this is like Columbus.</v>

1072
01:04:38.701 --> 01:04:42.450
When he fucking sailed over and he saw some tree branches in a couple of birds

1073
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:43.951
you're going to get,

1074
01:04:43.951 --> 01:04:48.120
their problem is that my wife and I still have a lot of student debt that we're

1075
01:04:48.121 --> 01:04:50.420
repaying and substitute teaching does.

1076
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:55.200
Teaching doesn't pay nearly as much as being a regular classroom teacher.

1077
01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.820
I've put off my dream of becoming a writer for years and I think now maybe the

1078
01:04:59.821 --> 01:05:04.020
time to metaphorically pushing all my chips.
I might lose,
but I might win now.

1079
01:05:04.021 --> 01:05:07.790
Dude,
there's no way.
There's no way you lose when you go after a drink.

1080
01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:12.870
<v 1>You don't.
It always leads to something better always.
All right</v>

1081
01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:17.760
<v 0>dude.
Fucking substitute teacher teach and be a fucking Uber driver.</v>

1082
01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:22.650
<v 1>All right,
and you know,
eat at home.</v>

1083
01:05:22.651 --> 01:05:24.750
More starving artist.

1084
01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.440
I slept on a futon until I was 36 I don't fucking regret any of it.

1085
01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:33.390
I told you that story a zillion times in this podcast.
I was dating this,

1086
01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.440
this woman and I said I had a spot I had to go do and it paid $8 at the comic

1087
01:05:39.511 --> 01:05:43.800
strip during the week.
Tuesday night I went down there and I came back,

1088
01:05:43.801 --> 01:05:48.090
I tried on a new bit and I was doing it and afterwards I was at home in my

1089
01:05:48.091 --> 01:05:53.091
apartment and I was doing this silly dance in the kitchen cause I had a new bit

1090
01:05:53.191 --> 01:05:55.920
and I was psyched because I had gone through this period when I wasn't coming up

1091
01:05:55.921 --> 01:06:00.180
with any new material and she was laughing and then she got a sad look on her

1092
01:06:00.181 --> 01:06:03.960
face and I said,
what's the matter?
And she said,
I wish I had a job

1093
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:09.590
where I only got paid $8 yet I came home and I did a silly dance in the kitchen

1094
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:13.220
and I never forgot that dude so that,
you know what I mean?

1095
01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:17.840
You're going to have to suffer a little bit,
but a substitute teach Uber Dude,

1096
01:06:17.841 --> 01:06:18.230
you Po,

1097
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:21.740
you got a short story published and you got a nomination for a literary prize.

1098
01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.110
Come on man.
You know what you're supposed to do.

1099
01:06:24.111 --> 01:06:27.050
I don't even have to go through the rest of this fucking thing.
He goes,
my,

1100
01:06:27.051 --> 01:06:31.360
all right,
I'll get to the whole thing.
He said,
you know,
pardon me.

1101
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:34.700
Fights against the dream and insists that I have to do the responsible thing and

1102
01:06:34.701 --> 01:06:36.830
keep teaching.
Fuck all of that.

1103
01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:41.870
Fuck all the responsible thing to do is to listen to your heart.
Uh,

1104
01:06:41.871 --> 01:06:44.150
my question for you,
either in your,

1105
01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.660
either in your career when you were trying to build an audience and make it as a

1106
01:06:47.661 --> 01:06:48.351
standup comedian,

1107
01:06:48.351 --> 01:06:51.170
did you struggle with the financial strain of chasing your dream?

1108
01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:56.020
Did you ever have to choose between a good paying job or doing stand up our

1109
01:06:56.030 --> 01:07:00.140
heart?
How hard was it to work at a shitty job just so you can chase your dream?

1110
01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.660
Did you ever think that maybe you are wasting your time,

1111
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:06.410
any advice are occurring?
I think I answered all of those.
Um,

1112
01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.950
it wasn't hard to work at the Shitty job because I was always thinking about the

1113
01:07:09.951 --> 01:07:13.580
exciting job I was going to do afterwards.
Um,

1114
01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:19.540
and every night that I just went up on stage and if it just went moderately
okay.

1115
01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:24.190
I couldn't believe it.
I couldn't believe I have to be honest with you.
Like,

1116
01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:26.973
<v 2>okay.</v>

1117
01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:27.540
<v 1>I,</v>

1118
01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:32.300
I couldn't fucking believe that I was actually doing it.

1119
01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:36.020
That I was actually,
I had a dream and I was making it happen.

1120
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:42.190
And I still remember the first time I really went on stage and I actually got in

1121
01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:48.320
the zone for what was considered a zone at the level comic I was.

1122
01:07:48.321 --> 01:07:51.410
And I only was in the zone for about eight seconds.

1123
01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:52.790
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1124
01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:57.470
<v 1>Um,
I was at Nick's comedy stop in Framingham on route nine.</v>

1125
01:07:57.471 --> 01:08:00.870
It doesn't even exist anymore.
And,
um,

1126
01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:07.550
I just got on this roll of laughter that I was actually able to pause and

1127
01:08:07.891 --> 01:08:11.340
fucking be in the moment and enjoy it rather than be like,
oh my God,

1128
01:08:11.341 --> 01:08:16.290
what's my next joke was my last job.
And,
um,
that

1129
01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:20.970
<v 0>fucking feeling can carry you through a fucking shitty job for a week.</v>

1130
01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:24.960
Chasing to get back on stage to feel that again.

1131
01:08:25.290 --> 01:08:28.920
And then the first time I got $5 for gas money for Eddystone.

1132
01:08:28.921 --> 01:08:32.340
I've told all these stories.
Friday stone,
the excitable boy,

1133
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:34.890
<v 1>that's what he went by.
Um,</v>

1134
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:38.200
I did a room for him and he gave me $5 gas money.

1135
01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:41.590
I probably spent 10 to get there and I couldn't fucking believe it.

1136
01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.970
And I was like,
I did that.
And they gave me this.
I couldn't fucking believe it.

1137
01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:50.070
At what point,
just listen to the sound of my voice.
I'm talking about this.

1138
01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:54.750
Have you ever had that level of excitement doing any other fucking job?

1139
01:08:55.230 --> 01:08:59.970
That's what it's like when you're,
you,
you go after a dream job.

1140
01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.600
So nothing,

1141
01:09:05.190 --> 01:09:08.790
nothing is worse than not going after it.
Okay.

1142
01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:12.060
And doing the responsible thing and all of that type of shit.

1143
01:09:12.061 --> 01:09:16.490
And then you sit in your house with all your responsible stuff.
Fuck.
All of that

1144
01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:22.370
is financially I did not do the responsible thing.
And yeah,
I told,

1145
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:23.450
I've said all these stories,

1146
01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:27.500
I fucking east eat spaghetti every fucking night with a can of fucking prego.

1147
01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.000
Then bunch of bread and I would just fill myself up on that.

1148
01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:36.050
Or I go to Denny's and I get the five stack of pancakes and just poured my

1149
01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:39.680
stomach like concrete so I wouldn't have to eat the whole fucking day and do

1150
01:09:39.681 --> 01:09:42.260
standup in some cafeteria at some fucking college.

1151
01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:45.760
And quitting never entered my mind.

1152
01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:50.920
I just kept trying to get better at it because as bad as some of those gigs
were,

1153
01:09:50.921 --> 01:09:52.600
the great ones were way better.

1154
01:09:52.601 --> 01:09:57.230
So you'll have all of these stories just in a literary way.
So with,

1155
01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:01.770
without a doubt,
you have to fucking do it.
And um,

1156
01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:05.140
I can tell you right now,
man,
like with what you,

1157
01:10:05.141 --> 01:10:09.730
what you've already accomplished.
Like to me,
I would be thinking like,

1158
01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:11.090
I'm gonna,

1159
01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:16.090
I can affect way more people and make way more fucking money and live a fucking

1160
01:10:17.591 --> 01:10:21.580
dream being a professional,
right?
I mean,
right.
I mean,
that'd be unbelievable.

1161
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:25.480
Began.
Unbelievable.
So not to say there's anything wrong with teaching,

1162
01:10:25.481 --> 01:10:30.010
but if teaching isn't your dream,
that's just the job you're doing.

1163
01:10:30.011 --> 01:10:31.840
So I'm not shitting on teachers out there.

1164
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:36.850
So one of the most underrated jobs and of course,
most underpaid jobs ever.

1165
01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:40.020
<v 0>Um,
but any,
I'm just trying to amp you up here,</v>

1166
01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:45.030
so go out and fucking do it and email me when you get published because,

1167
01:10:45.031 --> 01:10:48.210
uh,
I think you're gonna I don't think you,
you know,

1168
01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:54.330
I'll give you a bunch apo get bunch of other shit writers and you won one thing,

1169
01:10:54.331 --> 01:10:57.510
but you got two things going on here.
All right.
Give me a fucking break.

1170
01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:01.440
All right?
You just need to push yourself out of the fucking Bush.
Not The bush.

1171
01:11:01.441 --> 01:11:05.490
The Nest.
The Bush.
That was oddly gross.
All right.

1172
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.860
That's the fucking podcast for this week.
Um,
ah,

1173
01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:14.100
this is fucking Burrito fucker with me.
But the hiccups,
what did I do?
Um,
back

1174
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.600
<v 1>on the horse,
the Horse back the horse.
I go to the gym everyday.</v>

1175
01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:23.240
It's just the gut part.
And if you don't want me saying,
Hey,
go to gym everyday,

1176
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:25.980
you can't.
All right,
you hit the gym hard.
Go after your dreams.

1177
01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:29.590
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll check on Thursday.
See Ya.
