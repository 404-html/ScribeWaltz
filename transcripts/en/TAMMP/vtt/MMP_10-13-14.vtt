Oh that's good.
Mic got nothing,

Oh Shit.

7
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:26.070
My fucking boss.
You know,

8
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:28.410
he's breaking my balls where I'm not going to bore you with it.

9
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:32.370
Do or do you think about the patch and they full fucking real.
It's like,

10
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:35.910
you know,
which team are they?
Um,

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.610
I'm actually doing this out of my living room.

12
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:43.110
That's why I have the echo out here.
Um,
you know,

13
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.450
like the old capitol records thing that they used to do,
right.

14
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.110
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

15
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.700
<v 0>um,
we've got construction workers downstairs,
Sophie here,</v>

16
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.580
some fucking banging around or whatever.
That's just them finishing up,

17
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.170
finishing up the Goddamn job.

18
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.290
I always wonder what they think when I'm up here fucking singing and screaming

19
00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:04.000
and saying,
can't,
you know,

20
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:06.790
they probably think I'm yelling at my wife a bitch and about the job that don't,

21
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.660
you know,
maybe if they didn't have real jobs,
stayed,

22
00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:14.290
have time to listen to the podcast like you,
like you are right now.

23
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.390
How dare you in the middle of a fucking workweek in the United States of
America.

24
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:22.570
You just sitting here listening to this shit.
You know,

25
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.110
aren't we slipping enough?

26
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.440
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.230
<v 0>Oh,
what are the fuck you are around the world.
Do you know?</v>

28
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:30.330
This weekend I went out and I did a,

29
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.390
I did a show at the spotlight 29 casino with the let there be talks.

30
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.730
Uh,
Dean del Ray of the letter B talked podcast and uh,
Joe Bart,

31
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:45.540
Nick Rosebowl legend and host of the puck off.

32
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.950
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.160
<v 0>Um,
podcasts and the PS popping.</v>

34
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.810
I gotta turn this fucking volume down here.
Um,
anyways,
the,
um,

35
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.930
we went out there,
we hit,
we had a great time,

36
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:01.260
but we were on our way out there and,
um,

37
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.940
we're on the highway and I'm thinking,
all right,
there's fucking,

38
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.410
<v 2>yeah,</v>

39
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.470
<v 0>three of us here.
We can use the Carpool lane.</v>

40
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.170
And recently I've been getting these tickets for writing.

41
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.590
I Dunno what going through tolls and not paying.
And I'm like,

42
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:19.670
where the hell was that?

43
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.360
And there's pictures of my car and shit and I'm on the highway.

44
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:26.000
I had no idea what it was.
And uh,

45
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.610
I was riding out with those guys and they finally explained what it was.

46
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.650
They said,
um,

47
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.540
that a private group bought up a section of the,

48
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:42.100
of the highway out here in Los Angeles.
And um,

49
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.860
<v 2>okay.</v>

50
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.940
<v 0>They own it.
And when you use it,
you got to pay them money,</v>

51
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:51.900
you got to give them toll money and all that type of shit.
And uh,

52
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.950
that was really scary to me because if they were going to do that,

53
00:02:55.951 --> 00:03:00.670
why wouldn't the state just do it?
Why would they just say,
well fuck it.

54
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.660
We'll just do it and we'll collect that money.
God knows we could use it,

55
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.010
right,
but instead they sold it off to somebody.

56
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:12.460
So what that says to me is just state is so fucking bankrupt.

57
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.140
They don't even have time to just,
you know,

58
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.470
just collect money on roads that they already own.

59
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:23.980
They have to sell off like a giant section of a highway.

60
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.230
Who's that group that owns the giant section of the highway and how the fuck do

61
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:32.080
I get involved in that?
That,
that business?

62
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.520
I'll parachute right outta here.
I'll never,
I'll do like fucking a podcast.

63
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:40.870
Seven days,
a goddamn week.
I'll never go on the road again.
Won't tell any jokes.

64
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.380
And you guys can just listen to me.
Slowly slipped into madness.
Yeah.

65
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.570
Do you realize how fucking cool.

66
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.260
This is one of the greatest investments of all time.

67
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.870
I own a stripper.

68
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.040
Like I own five miles of a fucking highway outside one of the most populated

69
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.590
cities ever whip.

70
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.480
There's no public transportation for the most part.
Everybody's in a car

71
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.440
and every time they go up through that fucking thing,
Dang.
Dang.
Dang.
Dang.

72
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.610
<v 3>Okay.</v>

73
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.950
<v 0>45 cents 45 cents 45 cents,</v>

74
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:17.860
45 cents and I'm sitting here on my fucking couch.

75
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.490
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

76
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.470
<v 0>just sitting here,
the bag of pretzels and a fucking Miller high life,
right?</v>

77
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.470
Just sitting here.
45 cents.
45 cents.
45 cents.

78
00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:31.840
45 cents is the greatest fucking thing ever.
Oh,
and I know you do do it.

79
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:36.650
What about the overhead?
What about it?
It's already fucking made.

80
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.210
When do you have to pave it?
Once every four or five years,
if that.

81
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.380
I remember back in the day,
the Mass Pike,
the whole time I was there,

82
00:04:45.381 --> 00:04:49.430
they paved that thing one time.
I don't know what it is.

83
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.700
Whatever man who gives a fuck.
How much could that,
well shit,

84
00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:55.450
that could cost a lot of money.
Wait a minute and all,

85
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:57.650
if you do any sort of driveway,
they always come in.
Oh,

86
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.330
going to be about 20 grand.

87
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.230
Is it more like three?
Um,

88
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.770
that that could get expensive.
I guess that could get expensive,
but dude,

89
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:10.150
I'm telling you that is the move.

90
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.100
If you can somehow get in with the people that are going to start buying up the

91
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:19.570
fucking roads over here
and Oh,
Jesus Christ.

92
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

93
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.260
<v 0>I would be such an obnoxious ass if I was making money like that.</v>

94
00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:28.430
I'd start wearing wife beaters and I'd have a fucking gold piece hanging around

95
00:05:28.431 --> 00:05:30.320
my neck that just said 45 cents.

96
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.700
45 cents,
45 cents,
45 cents owed.
It's slowly just go fucking nuts.

97
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:43.210
Thinking about it being like that guy.
Pick up the papers,
pick out the pavers.

98
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.260
Hey Bill,
what do you want for lunch?
Let me get a roast beef sandwich.
45 cents.

99
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.860
25 cents.
Yeah,
don't worry.
Yeah,
he gives you a little weird.
He's a little weird,

100
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:53.260
but don't want me to do it.
He's fucking painful.
The whole lunch.
You know,
we uh,

101
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.380
just kind of repeats himself a little bit.
Um,

102
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.750
so whoever did that,
ah,

103
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.780
good on you and whoever has been an office out here in California,

104
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.410
uh,
fuck you.
You spineless cunt.
All of you.

105
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.980
How the fuck do you go bankrupt as a God damn state.

106
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.910
Everybody going to work everyday.
You want to talk about 45 cents,
45 cents.

107
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.840
These mother fuckers are getting money from everybody.
You're getting free money,

108
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.630
free money,

Hey,

109
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:30.820
I'm going to go buy a fucking Chapeau.
Put It on my big stupid roundhead.

110
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.900
All right,
that'll be $8 plus fucking,
you know,
whatever.
80 cents tax.

111
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.850
There you go.
You didn't have to do a fucking thing.
State government did you?

112
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.141
Oh,

113
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:45.950
you had to do is sit around and wait for me to go out and go buy a fucking hat.

114
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.020
Free money.
Here you go.
Here you go.
Here you go.
Coming in.

115
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.300
Big Pile of fucking loot and then you blow all of it.

116
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.630
<v 3>Okay.</v>

117
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.830
<v 0>How do you go bankrupt as a state?</v>

118
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.320
<v 3>Okay.</v>

119
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.250
<v 0>Jesus fucking Christ.
Unbelievable.</v>

120
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:07.540
Why don't you want to hear your fucking excuses?
Well,

big Shit,

121
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.960
loose judge book,
my own hotel we,
oh by oh way.

122
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.850
I mean you got fucking the highway goes,

123
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:16.430
you know from San Diego all the way up out.
Go Fuck Yourself.

124
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:19.580
You know what's in there around all those highways.

125
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.780
A zillion fucking people are giving you money every time they go out to go by

126
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:26.900
themselves,
you know,
so of condoms and a pair of socks.

127
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.660
You're fucking making money.
You've got plenty of goddamn money.

128
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.250
But this is what happens.
All right?
The fuck in public servants,

129
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.370
the people who hold office,
they don't make any money.

130
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.110
They make no fucking money.
I don't know what a senator makes.

131
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.230
I know the president makes 400 grand a fucking year.
Okay?

132
00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:49.550
So if you're governor of Los Angeles,
what are you taking down a year?

133
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.900
What a hundred grand,

134
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.190
a hundred grand to have everybody in the fucking city say that you're a piece of

135
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:57.860
shit.
You're fucking everything up,
right?
You've got to have security.

136
00:07:57.861 --> 00:07:59.840
So nobody comes up and fucking shanks Ya.

137
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.540
Every time you go out to go get a club sandwich.

138
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.100
And not to mention it costs millions and millions and millions of dollars to

139
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:11.640
campaign to get that fucker job.
And in the end,
all you get is a hundred grand.

140
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.200
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

141
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.160
<v 0>Those guys,
they are set up to be bribed.

142
00:08:17.161 --> 00:08:18.960

143
00:08:18.961 --> 00:08:23.961
So basically you're going for a job that's gonna get you a hundred grand and you

144
00:08:24.061 --> 00:08:26.700
need millions and millions of dollars to fucking get the thing.

145
00:08:26.701 --> 00:08:29.910
So now you got to get in bed with all these fat cats that can fucking buy up the

146
00:08:29.911 --> 00:08:33.900
goddamn highways and that's what they do.
Right Day.

147
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.160
What I'll finance you for listening to me.
Fucking shut up.

148
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.100
I'm going to fucking,
what do you need?
Money.
How much money you need for this?

149
00:08:44.101 --> 00:08:46.530
Huh?
Eight,
seven,
9 million.
What the fuck do you need?
All right.
Hey,

150
00:08:46.531 --> 00:08:49.650
2040 68 fucking keep it.
All right,
but all right,

151
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.200
I or II and in return you got to give me,

152
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.960
you've got to give me 10 miles of the fucking 10 or the five.

153
00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.500
We get the five full of fucking hippies driving up to San Francisco.

154
00:09:00.501 --> 00:09:03.140
Let me get 10 10 miles of that and I'm not finished.

155
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.400
Let me get 10 miles of that and uh,
let's make,

156
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:12.560
let's make it a no fly zone over Rod Disneyland.
Whatever the fuck they want.

157
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.403
Right?

158
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.590
<v 5>Okay.</v>

159
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.450
<v 0>Then that's what happens or whatever.</v>

160
00:09:16.451 --> 00:09:19.090
You know what I'm going to do with this job I'm going to repay.

161
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.620
Let me be the guy who fucking repaved it.

162
00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.910
I'm going to donate $2 million to your fucking campaign so you can get this job

163
00:09:24.911 --> 00:09:29.320
that makes a hundred grand a fucking year and maybe eventually get to the White

164
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.420
House.
So you get that Marilyn Monroe side pussy,

165
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.470
and then you get to go on the fucking golden parachute million dollar a speech

166
00:09:35.471 --> 00:09:39.560
fucking Gig after you retire.
And in the meantime,
um,

167
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.000
I want the contract to do this job for the state and I'm going to charge you

168
00:09:43.001 --> 00:09:48.001
fucking $9 million for a hammer as the old fucking urban legend goes.

169
00:09:48.101 --> 00:09:51.700
And that's how you go fucking bankrupt.
There you go.
Look at that dummy like me.

170
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.470
That's my theory.
I'm anyways,
this is the Monday morning podcast.

171
00:09:56.471 --> 00:10:01.150
As I mentioned.
Um,
that was a good 10 minutes of horseshit Kaur,

172
00:10:01.151 --> 00:10:05.030
spelled w is it a horse shit like you fucking who?
Uh,

173
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.860
or is it horse shit
and you just seem so fast.
It's whore.

174
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.560
You know what?
I'm going to Google that right now.
Let me see.

175
00:10:12.561 --> 00:10:16.700
Let we look up horse shit.
H.
O.
R.
E.
S.
H.
I.
T.

176
00:10:16.701 --> 00:10:20.690
You know if you curse as much as I do.
She really fine dictionary Horse Shit.

177
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.980
It is a word shit whore.
Shit Bitch.

178
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.450
Horfish or face or this she used still horse shit.

179
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.340
Not embarrassed at all.
She's used to horse shit or is it horse shit.

180
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.720
I think we can all agree.
It's definitely bullshit,
right?
Girls on IRC,

181
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:46.080
this is urban dictionary.
Girls on IRC,
which I don't know what that is,

182
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.650
who are desperate for attention and will latch onto any scum they find also gets

183
00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:57.090
naked on cam for attention and sends out pics of themselves committing.

184
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.720
Oh Dee Dee acts to their anus.

185
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.170
Jesus' question.
What's funny about to fucking urban dictionary,

186
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:06.930
just like the Webster in the dictionary.

187
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:10.490
You've got to look up like another five fucking words.
Odd.

188
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.670
I remember Aux DB.
That was old.
Dirty bastard.
Old Dirty Dick.

189
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.050
What I'm sends out picks themselves committing to o d d x.

190
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.150
I feel like the white cop on Sanford and son right now.
What's going off?

191
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.110
I'm also,
Oh,
d d

192
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.310
what the fuck would that be?

193
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:32.840
<v 5>Okay.</v>

194
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.010
<v 0>Other dudes,
dicks</v>

195
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.360
out pictures of themselves committing other dudes.

196
00:11:38.361 --> 00:11:43.060
Dicks x to that doesn't make sense.
Not Jesus Christ.
Now I gotta look this up.

197
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.110
See what happens.
This is how you lose a whole fucking day.

198
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.480
This is why nothing is getting done in this country.

199
00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:50.090
Cause you're fucking go to the urban dictionary is a white guy like me,

200
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:59.130
oppositional defiant disorder.
Now what?

201
00:11:59.131 --> 00:12:03.210
The Jesus,
you know what?
I don't even give a fuck anymore.
Oh my God.

202
00:12:03.211 --> 00:12:08.100
He has odd force him forced drug him.

203
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.190
It can't have anything to do with ridiculous success of punishment is

204
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.960
jurisdictions operational defiant disorder.
Surprisingly,

205
00:12:15.961 --> 00:12:17.150
it's real.
A fake ass.

206
00:12:17.151 --> 00:12:22.080
This disorder pulled out of their asses of a small collective of psychiatrists

207
00:12:22.081 --> 00:12:25.530
working for pharmaceutical companies in order to maximize revenue.

208
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.680
Of course,
there's no a in,
you know what's funny?

209
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.050
I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore.
All right,

210
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:34.980
I'll chalk that up to be white as fuck.
Um,
anyways,

211
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:40.940
plowing ahead here.
Um,
do you guys bup,
Bup,
Bup Buda,
Buda,

212
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.173
Buda bad,

213
00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.170
<v 6>boop,
boop,
boop,
boop.</v>

214
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.940
<v 0>Let that bit,
but bow.
Did you guys watch any of the football this week?</v>

215
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.480
Of course you did.
Of course you did.
You had nothing better to do.

216
00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.760
Just like make you like how I'm doing that.

217
00:12:55.761 --> 00:12:58.850
I'm dragging you into my own fucking world.
Um,

218
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.710
I actually didn't watch too much of it.
I was running around like a maniac.
Um,

219
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:06.380
I did watch my patriots.
Um,

220
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:11.930
don't let the final score full year was a lot closer than you thought it was.

221
00:13:11.931 --> 00:13:12.111
I mean,

222
00:13:12.111 --> 00:13:17.111
we were only up by eight with four minutes to go against the buffalo bills.

223
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:23.340
This is why I can't,
I can't buy into the Patriots team yet.
People like,
Oh,

224
00:13:23.341 --> 00:13:26.600
you know,
it'd be tobacco.
You know,

225
00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.850
we are close game against the Raiders.
Right?

226
00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.520
Dave stuck.
I just stunk it.
I don't know.

227
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.870
They've stumps and stay where they were in la.
Who's kitten home?
No,

228
00:13:38.871 --> 00:13:41.120
that's not true.
They had the,
uh,

229
00:13:41.121 --> 00:13:45.890
the snow cone game where they lost us because of an obscure rule.

230
00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.150
I love all raider fans think that that game was bullshit.
It wasn't bullshit.

231
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:54.260
The rule was bullshit,
but the call was not bullshit.

232
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:55.460
It was right on the money.

233
00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.520
What was bullshit was the roughing the passer call against Sugar Bay Hamilton

234
00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.450
that got the radio and just super bowl 11 all right,

235
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.830
so quit your crying.

236
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:12.050
Go put on your makeup and your stupid fucking costume and go sit in the end zone

237
00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:15.500
and think that you're intimidating somebody.
Oh,
you might intimidate me.

238
00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.770
I'm in the stage.
No one gives a shit about me,

239
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.530
but you're not going to intimidate a professional football player with the God

240
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:27.170
damn outfit.
When I look at when I,

241
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.880
when I bite into a York peppermint patty,

242
00:14:28.881 --> 00:14:33.881
when I look into the fucking end zone of the Goddamn or eight is right and I see

243
00:14:34.071 --> 00:14:36.860
the sadness that,
that,
that fan base has become,

244
00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.950
I'll never get over cause I fucking love the Raiders.
I,
that is one of the most,

245
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.980
that is arguably the best logo in all on national football.

246
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:51.060
The everybody who the fuck hasn't tried to rip off putting some of black and do

247
00:14:51.881 --> 00:14:54.880
their uniform to try to be more intimidating or at least the amount of people

248
00:14:54.881 --> 00:14:55.900
who have,
right.

249
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.390
<v 3>Okay.</v>

250
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.510
<v 0>Atlanta Falcons,
the old Houston Oilers.</v>

251
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:02.483
Then they do that.

252
00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.960
Or Jerry Glanville just went out and got a black jacket at fucking idiot.

253
00:15:06.961 --> 00:15:10.750
He shouldn't have been a head coach.
He should have been on like Falcon Crest.
Um,

254
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.270
or the dukes of hazards or something like that.
Who else?
Everybody for a while,

255
00:15:15.271 --> 00:15:15.811
I can't remember.

256
00:15:15.811 --> 00:15:18.570
Everybody would are we switched to uniforms to black cause they want to be more

257
00:15:18.571 --> 00:15:22.560
fucking intimidating when they rate these were smart enough from day one,

258
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.593
right?

259
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:29.690
The silver and black and they had a fucking pirate on the side of the helmet.

260
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.350
They've never had to change it.
Look at,

261
00:15:31.351 --> 00:15:33.720
look at every fucking team out there had to change.

262
00:15:33.721 --> 00:15:36.900
It had to eventually was like,
all right,
you know,

263
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.350
what the fuck were we thinking in 1960 or 19 whatever.

264
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.370
Everybody has fucked with their God goddamn low logos except for the radios.

265
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.990
They never had to.
They got it right.
Right out of the gate.

266
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:53.160
Like that fat fuck they pull out of the stands to try to hit a half court

267
00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.140
fucking shot.
Right.

268
00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:58.740
So he can go out and go win a fucking dodge opal or whatever the fuck they're

269
00:15:58.741 --> 00:16:03.270
given away.
Oh my God,
I can't even afford.
Right.

270
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.620
Some meaty fat tit fucking moron goes out there.
Nothing button that,

271
00:16:07.621 --> 00:16:11.600
that's what they did back in 1968 sure.

272
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.260
This other teams that couldn't admitted that they fucked up like the dolphins.

273
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.540
When you really think about the dolphins,

274
00:16:18.541 --> 00:16:23.541
that is probably the worst fucking name considering the sharks was still on.

275
00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.480
That was still available.
They could have been the sharks.

276
00:16:27.481 --> 00:16:30.060
They could add some bad ass fucking logo.
I mean,

277
00:16:30.061 --> 00:16:33.150
if you're going to go with some sort of porpoise type looking fish,

278
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.473
<v 3>right?</v>

279
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.330
<v 0>What do they do?
They pick the dolphins.</v>

280
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.110
Why don't you just call yourselves the pussies?
Right?

281
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.310
That logo should have had a fucking beach ball right on the end of it's God damn

282
00:16:45.311 --> 00:16:48.000
nose join.
Anyways,
they,

283
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:53.200
but they stick with this thing for so goddamn long.
They went to super bowls.

284
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.610
They go undefeated back when you played like fucking 12 games and nobody gave a

285
00:16:57.611 --> 00:17:00.340
shit.
There was no pressure whatsoever.

286
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:01.803
<v 3>Right.</v>

287
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.970
<v 0>They went to another two super bowls.
I think,
yeah.</v>

288
00:17:04.971 --> 00:17:09.230
And then eighties one with dawn struck and one with uh,

289
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:14.240
Dan Marino and after awhile you just kind of forgiveness kind of forgot that

290
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:19.190
they were the dolphins and they had that silly ass logo and it never dawned on

291
00:17:19.191 --> 00:17:23.450
me again how stupid that fucking name and logo was until they changed it.

292
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.190
They changed it.
What?
Last year?
I think they changed it last year.

293
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.370
I think I already made fun of the logo,
but whenever I look at that logo,

294
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:36.470
that logo to me looks like it's the logo of a corporation that just had a

295
00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:38.930
massive fucking oil spill in the Gulf.

296
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.410
And now they're trying to pretend like they give a shit about the environment.

297
00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:45.470
So they switch up their logo.
You know,

298
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.720
it's kind of like BP did.

299
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.580
They put like fucking looks like corn and grass is the color of their logo.
Like,

300
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.820
oh Whoa,
they care about us.

301
00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.170
They care about the trees.
Um,
they don't.

302
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:05.780
Um,
all right.
How far into this fucking podcast are we at this point?
18 minutes.

303
00:18:05.781 --> 00:18:08.200
Another fucking nine minutes of bullshit.
There we go.
Will.

304
00:18:08.201 --> 00:18:12.290
It's time for a little bit of advertising.
All right,

308
00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:27.200
That's all not riding up my fucking crack.
All right.

309
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:32.030
It's unbelievable how putting on a great pair of underwear changes your entire

310
00:18:32.031 --> 00:18:34.970
outlook for the day.
That is not a joke.

311
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.940
Feeling that velvety smooth material

312
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:40.910
up against your privates.

313
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.380
You know that feeling of putting on that ratty old saggy underwear.
Oh my God,

314
00:18:45.381 --> 00:18:49.370
dude,
we got it.

Of course it fit perfectly.

319
00:19:07.131 --> 00:19:09.530
There's not that much material.
It's like you make it pants.

320
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:14.030
What are you going to measure the end scene with somebody fucking taint.
Um,

321
00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.240
I actually,
I've heard these a great,
by the way.
They fit perfectly.

322
00:19:17.241 --> 00:19:22.241
They don't ride up on you and they literally pull moisture away from your gross

323
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:28.400
from your skin.
So you're cool all day long.

324
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.490
That doesn't make any sense.

325
00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:33.290
<v 7>Okay?</v>

326
00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.610
<v 0>You have your sweat to cool yourself off.</v>

327
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.530
Now your point pulling the moisture away.

328
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.540
Why don't you just come out and say it me undies.

329

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.510

388
00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.590
when you watch like an NFL football game,

did you have you like watch the advertising?

390
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.520

they've run in that fucking,
that Ad.
Every 10 minutes.</v>

393
00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:28.640
Don't hit women no more,
no more.

394
00:23:28.641 --> 00:23:32.210
She slipped on the coffee cake no more.

395
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:37.880
I asked,
I was stretching and accidentally pushed her down the stairs.
No more,

396
00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:40.820
no more.
Uh,

397
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.750
we were playing football and she tried to block a kick.

398
00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:49.980
She tried to block the punt.
Don't,
she was roughing me.

399
00:23:49.981 --> 00:23:53.040
She not supposed to run into the kicking follow up.
My fault.

400
00:23:53.041 --> 00:23:57.620
My fucking sneakerhead affects,
you know.
Um,
so they got that going.

401
00:23:57.621 --> 00:24:01.320
I said basically why they think we're wife beaters.
Alright.

402
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.180
Every five seconds she got some Sorta,

403
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.870
you know your Dick doesn't get hard and you're going bald.

404
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.880
You're balding limp Dick wifebeater.
Right.

405
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:16.160
And then they run the fucking draft kings.
You're a degenerate gambler.

406
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.850
You're a degenerate gambling,
bald,
limp Dick fucking wife beater.

407
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.980
Nothing positive.
They're fucking,
no more commercial.

408
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.570
Fucking annoys me because I feel like they yelling at me and I don't hit women.

409
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.380
So why don't you fucking tone it down a little bit?
Yeah.
Okay.

410
00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:37.430
Actually tweeted this out.
You know when you watch a w NBA game,

411
00:24:37.431 --> 00:24:39.950
but they start yelling at all the broads watching that shit.

412
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:41.820
<v 7>Okay.</v>

413
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.640
<v 0>You know,
no more marrying a guy just because he's got money.</v>

414
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.300
<v 7>Okay,</v>

415
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:51.100
<v 0>but you don't love them no more.
I'm used to a certain lifestyle.</v>

416
00:24:51.101 --> 00:24:52.240
Do they do that shit?
Of course.

417
00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:56.200
Say Down if he could sit of fine or something fucking wrong thing that don't no

418
00:24:56.201 --> 00:24:59.230
more campaign and everybody's dressed all in black,
you know,

419
00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:02.620
like they get on the cover of the fucking Beatles album.
You know,

420
00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:04.060
my favorite part of all of it.

421
00:25:04.061 --> 00:25:09.061
Can somebody please explain to me how they didn't do a like didn't do any sort

422
00:25:09.071 --> 00:25:13.030
of background check on ice tea and he got in that fucking commercial

423
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:19.180
according to his albums.
Wasn't he a pimp at some point?
I don't know.

424
00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.300
I don't know much about the pimp game,
but as far as I know,

425
00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.150
you know if you started off as a pimp,

426
00:25:25.151 --> 00:25:29.050
you probably made your first million smacking bitches every couple of seconds.

427
00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.750
Ah Bitch.
Where's my money?

428
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:35.543
<v 4>Okay.</v>

429
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.860
<v 0>Oh,
I love ice tea.
Every time you fucking see that guy,</v>

430
00:25:41.861 --> 00:25:43.480
he's always talking about the street.

431
00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:44.660
<v 7>Okay.</v>

432
00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.400
<v 0>You know,
Yo,
I could make,</v>

433
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:50.720
I could make five grand at 20 minutes every fucking time.

434
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.390
I don't give a fuck what you bring up.

435
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.610
Ice Tea is going to bring up the street and how much money he could make.

436
00:25:56.611 --> 00:26:01.110
How quickly.
Hey,
ice tea.
Isn't it a beautiful day out here?
I'll tell you,

437
00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:03.030
it was beautiful when I was out on the street.

438
00:26:03.031 --> 00:26:06.240
I could make five Wayne and 20 minutes.
Yeah.

439
00:26:06.241 --> 00:26:07.860
It was just kind of talking about the weather.

440
00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.450
Every fucking one of those VH one things from 10 years ago.

441
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.420
All those behind the musics,
anything,
blah,
blah,
blah.

442
00:26:18.421 --> 00:26:20.070
Why don't give a fuck what they were talking about.

443
00:26:20.071 --> 00:26:24.300
Ice Tea eventually came on and told you that he could make five grand at 20

444
00:26:24.301 --> 00:26:28.660
minutes.
When I was out on the street,
the pimp game,

445
00:26:28.661 --> 00:26:33.440
see the pimp game.
Oh,
shut up about the fucking pimp and gave
hey,

446
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.230
know that that whole thing is romanticized.

447
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.920
See when you get some runaway to go out and sell her pussy for money and there's

448
00:26:38.921 --> 00:26:42.370
an art to it,
is it you fucking creep?
You know,
it's funny,

449
00:26:42.371 --> 00:26:46.930
I didn't even know was was he your pimp?
All those albums fucking ran together.

450
00:26:46.931 --> 00:26:50.010
They all came out.
They was so fucking overwhelming.
When I first heard of,

451
00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.650
you know,
I'm sitting here,

452
00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.060
little white boy living in the CULDESAC and all of a sudden easy and all these

453
00:26:55.061 --> 00:26:58.540
guys came out.
I could,
I couldn't keep up with WHO's getting shot,

454
00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.180
who was getting smacked.
So I might be wrong on that one,

455
00:27:01.181 --> 00:27:03.310
but am I the only one who was like,
wait a minute.

456
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.170
That's that guy who can make five grand at 20 minutes smacking bitches out there

457
00:27:08.171 --> 00:27:11.890
and selling crack,
right?
No more.

458
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:18.520
Oh Jesus.
I didn't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Anyway,

459
00:27:18.521 --> 00:27:22.180
so let's get down to the football this week.
So I watched the Patriots,

460
00:27:22.181 --> 00:27:24.820
obviously it was a big victory on the afcs,

461
00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:30.100
the weak limp Dick fucking AFC east Jesus Christ.

462
00:27:30.101 --> 00:27:32.110
Man.
What has happened to the fucking jets,

463
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:37.240
but the Betty and the jets,
they're fucking fallen off the face of the earth.

464
00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.150
Now what a lot of people would think that the Patriots are going to have an easy

465
00:27:40.151 --> 00:27:42.490
victory cub this Thursday or Thursday night football.

466
00:27:42.491 --> 00:27:44.230
And I'm here to tell you that probably won't happen.

467
00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:50.200
I'm actually not buying it cause uh oh,

468
00:27:50.201 --> 00:27:54.550
jet's always play as tough.
All right,
I'm going to sell you a bad game.

469
00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.600
The patriots versus the jets Thursday night football.
All right.

470
00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:02.530
<v 8>You know,
I'll tell you the church and they got their backs up against the wall.</v>

471
00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.520
You know,
I wouldn't count out this rex ray tune.

472
00:28:05.521 --> 00:28:07.180
There's still part Jewish says to him.

473
00:28:07.181 --> 00:28:09.280
I know they've launched now games you a fucking rope.

474
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.480
<v 0>Um,
they're actually in a,
uh,
it was actually a rough,</v>

475
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.950
a rough week,
uh,
for um,

476
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.400
New York football giants got the shit kicked out of the eagles.
Really?

477
00:28:22.401 --> 00:28:26.880
That fucking good.
I mean,

478
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.171
I don't know.

479
00:28:28.171 --> 00:28:30.450
I just kept thinking how the Gyra at the giants are going to make some sort of

480
00:28:30.451 --> 00:28:35.400
halftime adjustments at some point.
Right.
It was brutal though.
Huh?

481
00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:39.360
Cruz got fucking that brutal injury.
Oh,
look at this shit.

482
00:28:39.361 --> 00:28:40.860
Here I'm on the New York Post.

483
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:45.330
Hard to believe radio hosts excuse for mocking crews.

484
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:50.331
Injury of Philadelphia Radio House added insult to injury Sunday night mocking

485
00:28:50.731 --> 00:28:52.020
giant star receivers,

486
00:28:52.021 --> 00:28:56.670
Victor Cruz after he injured his right knee in the second half loss.

487
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.920
How is it hard to believe that anybody in Philly does anything other than I

488
00:29:01.921 --> 00:29:06.510
guess if they act like human beings and it's actually hard to believe a cruiser

489
00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:08.580
would just drop the fourth down,
pass in the end zone,

490
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:13.581
tore his patellar tendon out on the play and immediately grabbed his knee.

491
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.330
Mike,
Miss Aneli,
a Mike fucking Miss Aneli,

492
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:23.100
a radio host for 97.5 the fanatic made fun of cruises,

493
00:29:23.101 --> 00:29:27.900
salsa dancing as he rides in pain.
I gotta admit that's kind of funny.

494
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:32.040
A giant fans,
Rick Victor Cruz is over dance to that.

495
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:36.450
Oh God.
Okay.
Wait a minute.
I thought he was going to be,

496
00:29:36.451 --> 00:29:38.830
I have pop pop out.
I tell you to do something like that,

497
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.780
that that would have made me laugh.
As Cruz was carted and tears,

498
00:29:41.781 --> 00:29:45.860
the fans in attendance at Lincoln financial field gave him his sincere round of

499
00:29:45.861 --> 00:29:49.490
applause.
Oh,
look at that.
See,
look at me.
I'm saying all eagle fans of bad.

500
00:29:49.491 --> 00:29:52.650
It gets on and missing like soon.
Backtrack,
DTA,

501
00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:57.110
deleting the tweet and replacing it with multiple apologies.

502
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.860
Uh,
somebody was home drunk watching the game.

503
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.740
A giant fish is done.

504
00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:12.500
Dance to that tweet.
Just sitting there laughing.
That's a good one.

505
00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:17.540
Then get me some more lists and all of a sudden all the hate starts coming in.

506
00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.980
You start sweating all over the place except down his balls because he's wearing

507
00:30:21.981 --> 00:30:26.580
me undies.
Me undies,
no more sweaty balls.
Um,

508
00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.890
this is what he wrote.
He said,
I apologize for the cruise tweet.

509
00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.110
I didn't see that he got hurt on the play,

510
00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.980
was outside the stadium and saw he dropped it walking to my car.

511
00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.130
You lying.
Sack of shit.
He goes,

512
00:30:40.131 --> 00:30:43.850
I just saw on big screen outside stadium that he dropped the past.

513
00:30:43.851 --> 00:30:47.210
Didn't see that he got hurt on my,
on the play.
My bad.

514
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:50.990
I would never have tweeted that.
Had I known he got injured.
Please know that.

515
00:30:50.991 --> 00:30:54.490
No what?
You're full of Shit,
dude.

516
00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:58.780
Victor Cruz is over right there.
That means you know he got hurt.

517
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:03.880
Ah,
Jesus.
You know what?
This guy doesn't need me undies.

518
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:07.780
BRD,
no more sweaty balls because he doesn't have any balls.

519
00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.360
Just say,
listen,
I was at the game.

520
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:16.900
I got fucking a Hammock and I made a joke that a lot of people made.

521
00:31:17.031 --> 00:31:20.540
I was actually in a cigar bar last night watching the game and somebody made

522
00:31:20.541 --> 00:31:25.160
that joke.
Um,
and people laugh,
but it was more like,
ah,
you know,

523
00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:29.100
but you know what the fuck you gonna sit there and what [inaudible] Papo every

524
00:31:29.101 --> 00:31:30.290
time you score a touchdown,

525
00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.550
the jokes just laying there waiting for somebody to say it.

526
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:40.310
Um,
he could find that with some alcohol and you combine that,

527
00:31:40.311 --> 00:31:43.820
he's in Philly,
so he's gotta be at least three quarters of a fucking animal.

528
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.780
Animal voice is cracking.
Um,

529
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:50.330
actually had a great time.

530
00:31:50.331 --> 00:31:52.980
I went to this awesome cigar bar last night and I watched the,
uh,

531
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.600
giants eagles game.
You know,
the game was just fucking,

532
00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:00.040
it was just was so one sided.
It was just a wall.
Why,

533
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:03.230
why it or why an ass kicking.
Um,

534
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:08.720
and we were actually was sitting there and,
um,
Jesus Christ,

535
00:32:08.721 --> 00:32:09.890
the hammering right underneath me.

536
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:14.300
This is what has been people for the last fucking six months.

537
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:17.450
I know what you're thinking.
Six months.
Jesus built,
what,

538
00:32:17.451 --> 00:32:21.500
are they rebuilding the whole downstairs?
Yes.
Yes they are.

539
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:24.740
And now they're going to put it in the hardwood floors and then they found out

540
00:32:24.741 --> 00:32:27.980
the floor wasn't level and the guy fucking goes,

541
00:32:27.981 --> 00:32:32.660
hey bill a MOOC this downstairs area ever outside.
Yeah,

542
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:36.050
it was,
let me guess,
let me guess.

543
00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:41.360
It used to be some sort of half ass porch,
so they had it raked,
you know,

544
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.460
and have a nice fucking whatever,
15 degree angle.

545
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.510
So the rain water would roll off it.
Now it's inside

546
00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.580
whatever.
What'd you downstairs in my house.

547
00:32:53.581 --> 00:32:56.700
Do you just feel like you're on a boat that's making a left turn or a right turn

548
00:32:56.701 --> 00:32:59.640
depending on which way you walk.
And I don't give a fuck.
Not,
it's not that bad.

549
00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:03.240
I never even noticed to be honest with you.
But um,
you know,

550
00:33:03.241 --> 00:33:06.150
he went down there with a level and that little ball just kind of rolled a

551
00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:10.140
little bit to the side.
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck,
you know,

552
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.180
I give a fuck,
but I just,
I don't have any more money.

553
00:33:12.181 --> 00:33:14.550
I don't have any more money to throw at that.
Okay.
I'm cutting you off.

554
00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:15.600
All right son,
it's over.

555
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:19.260
You've got to get out in the world and get a fucking job.
Um,

556
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.560
so anyways,
uh,
went out there with a couple of buddies,

557
00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:27.540
smoked a couple of cigars and uh,
was watching the game.

558
00:33:27.541 --> 00:33:31.020
It just was just a wire to wire fucking beat down.
And um,

559
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:35.160
I don't know.
I was disappointed in the game.
I was impressed.

560
00:33:35.161 --> 00:33:37.710
Obviously with Philly.
I know the giant started off rough.

561
00:33:37.711 --> 00:33:39.740
They've been playing better.
Um,

562
00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:42.150
but still I didn't think it was going to go like that.
And I've actually,

563
00:33:42.151 --> 00:33:45.100
I've always loved the NFC east.
It's always just been a,

564
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.140
it's always been great football,
great rivalries and that type of thing.

565
00:33:49.141 --> 00:33:50.070
It's sucked that the,
the,

566
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.780
the Redskins have not been a factor for so long cause those cowboy Redskins

567
00:33:54.781 --> 00:33:59.280
games were always great when I was growing up.
Um,

568
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.810
but I guess there's always one team that's going to suck and you division

569
00:34:01.811 --> 00:34:06.570
somebody has got to come in last.
It's just been them for a while.
Um,

570
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:11.700
for whatever reason.
Um,
all right.
Is that all I had to say in football?

571
00:34:11.701 --> 00:34:14.470
I honestly didn't watch a lot.
Um,

572
00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:17.970
I would have to think that they're fucking calling for Rex Ryan's head at this

573
00:34:17.971 --> 00:34:22.770
point.
Are they still sticking with the,
I still sticking with the guy.

574
00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.790
I'm actually going to be upset if he gets fired because I love watching him

575
00:34:26.791 --> 00:34:30.540
loose,
you know,
and if they fire him,

576
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.570
I don't get to do that anymore.
All right,
here we go.

577
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.430
And Eh,
what do we got here?
Spit it up.
Hill.
New York Post's sports.

578
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:42.780
All right.
Kevin Doran hurt his foot,
the Yankees.

579
00:34:42.781 --> 00:34:46.380
A rod mysteries and much deeper than you think.
Ah,
a Rod.

580
00:34:46.381 --> 00:34:50.940
My favorite Yankee of all time.
The $200 million Albatross.

581
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:56.040
Um,
let's see.
Gronk swagger returning to the Patriots.

582
00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:00.630
Uh,
I see he gets,
he made a quote,
they should get laid.

583
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:03.780
What the fuck?
Um,

584
00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:09.680
jets picked six ending gambling miracle for Broncos backers.

585
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.310
Yeah.
I don't see them getting saying get rid of Rex Ryan yet.
Well,

586
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.650
that's very surprising for the New York Post.
They usually got,

587
00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:24.560
the sky is falling up the two fucking days.
Um,
all right.

588
00:35:24.561 --> 00:35:27.100
And I gotta look up this story here.
Sorry guys.
I'm just,
you just listen to me.

589
00:35:27.101 --> 00:35:31.150
Read the newspaper this week.
Gronk swagger to the Patriots.
They should get laid.

590
00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.830
Rob Gronkowski is oh,

591
00:35:32.831 --> 00:35:36.850
is always looking out for his teammates falling New England's decisive 30,

592
00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:40.390
22 when I love how it was decisive,
we were up by eight

593
00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:44.930
with four minutes to go.
Somebody didn't watch the game.

594
00:35:44.931 --> 00:35:48.800
He just looked at the final score.
Um,
37,

595
00:35:48.801 --> 00:35:51.470
22 wine over the bills on Sunday.
The Patriots' tight in,

596
00:35:51.471 --> 00:35:55.670
wanted to give credit to the often overlooked or offensive line.

597
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:59.120
He gives this,
they're the ones who should,
oh,

598
00:35:59.121 --> 00:36:02.780
they're the ones who should get laid tonight.
Growing.
Koski said that it's,

599
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:06.740
that's very nice of them seeing that wasn't bad.
It wasn't bad at all.

600
00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:12.500
Um,
all right,
enough with the frigging football.
How about the baseball?

601
00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:13.750
<v 7>Okay,</v>

602
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:17.770
<v 0>how about the baseball?
Bup,
Bup,
bup,
bup,
bup.
Oh,
you guys been watching that shit?</v>

603
00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:21.280
I'm in watching the,
uh,
the royals.
I haven't watched the giants cat and holes.

604
00:36:21.281 --> 00:36:25.180
I saw the cardinals had a walk off last night,
which is awesome.
Um,

605
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:26.743
<v 7>but</v>

606
00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.510
<v 0>hang on a second.
Where the fuck did that story go?
God Damn it.</v>

607
00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.250
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

608
00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:37.450
<v 0>The New York Post actually had a fucking great story about some nurse cause I</v>

609
00:36:37.451 --> 00:36:39.820
don't want to have this all be sports and they listen to you guys fucking

610
00:36:39.821 --> 00:36:43.850
whining at me.
Oh move.
Would you do you for the people who don't look forwards.

611
00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.380
All right,
nurse,
here's one for you.
If for people who aren't into sports,

612
00:36:47.381 --> 00:36:51.610
nurse accused of killing 38 patients,
she found annoying

613
00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:56.200
cops arrested a nurse in northeast Italy.

614
00:36:56.230 --> 00:37:01.230
A are you doing and connection with deaths of as many as 38 patients who she say

615
00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:07.750
she whom she may have killed because she found them or their relatives.
Annoying.

616
00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:10.243
<v 7>Wow.</v>

617
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.520
<v 0>Daniella Porgy Isley,</v>

618
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:19.690
a 42 year old resident from the town of Lugo was taken into custody over the

619
00:37:19.981 --> 00:37:24.960
weekend and booked for allegedly slang as the alleged slang of a 78 year old

620
00:37:24.961 --> 00:37:28.340
patient rose that killed their own.

621
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:32.940
He who died from an injection of potassium Calderon.

622
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:37.830
He had been admitted to the hospital with a routine illness before she died.

623
00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:41.730
Unexpectedly test show.
She died with a high amount of potassium,

624
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:46.440
which can provide provoked cardiac arrest in her bloodstream.

625
00:37:46.441 --> 00:37:48.150
According to Central European news,

626
00:37:48.151 --> 00:37:52.200
her death triggered an investigation which found that 38 others had died

627
00:37:52.201 --> 00:37:55.920
mysteriously.
Why pogie Ali was on duty.

628
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:58.740
The news agency reported one of Pogie alleys.

629
00:37:58.741 --> 00:38:03.180
Fellow nurses described her as a cold person,
but always eager to work.

630
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:09.140
Wow.
Another one of [inaudible] colleagues said that the accused nurse was once

631
00:38:09.141 --> 00:38:14.141
reported for giving powerful laxative to patients at the end of her shift to

632
00:38:14.151 --> 00:38:18.380
make work tougher for the nurse.
The nurses working after her

633
00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:22.590
filed under crime,
Comma,
Italy.

634
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.330
Jesus Christ.

635
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:34.400
There's a person who never got hugged as a child.
Huh?
What a fucking so,
I mean,

636
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:39.440
I shouldn't say that,
man.
You know,
cause she hasn't been convicted of anything.

637
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.090
Why did,
why do they do that?

638
00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.750
Why do they protect the alleged victim but not the alleged accused?

639
00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.170
I saw something last night that was saying that this,

640
00:38:48.171 --> 00:38:53.171
this person out here attacked a 68 year old woman with like a broomstick or

641
00:38:53.991 --> 00:38:56.120
something outside of a fucking ATM.

642
00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:01.670
And so then they show this guy's face,
right?

643
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.570
And the judge just random fucking name.
They're like,
yeah,

644
00:39:05.571 --> 00:39:09.440
they show the guy's face on TV,
his mugshot.
And they go,
uh,

645
00:39:09.441 --> 00:39:14.441
and that is when Scott Walker allegedly took a broomstick and smash a 68 year

646
00:39:15.591 --> 00:39:20.420
old woman over their head with it at an ATM.
It's like allegedly,

647
00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:22.670
you don't even know if you've got the right fucking guy.

648
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:28.400
This guy's face is all over the fucking news.
Why did the,

649
00:39:28.401 --> 00:39:32.190
why did we have to see somebody's face before they convicted?

650
00:39:32.191 --> 00:39:33.720
I don't understand that.
Like,
you know,

651
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.350
how do you fucking make a comeback from that?
Hey,

652
00:39:37.351 --> 00:39:42.060
aren't you the guy who alleged who got accused?
Accused fucking,

653
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:44.530
<v 7>yeah,</v>

654
00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.990
<v 0>I wonder,
does the work he accused the psalter of a 68 year old woman?</v>

655
00:39:47.991 --> 00:39:52.100
Like how do you get it fucking job after that?
Um,
anyway,

656
00:39:52.101 --> 00:39:54.040
so the amount of times that they get the wrong person,

657
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:58.790
don't you think that they should maybe hold off on showing the photo?
Anybody?

658
00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.650
Bueller?
Anybody?
Anybody at all?

659
00:40:00.651 --> 00:40:05.330
Does anybody give a shit on any level whatsoever?
Where the hell's my recorder?

660
00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.120
Don't even tell me.
Don't even tell me I knocked it off.

661
00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:10.423
<v 7>Ah,
fuck.</v>

662
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.190
<v 0>Okay,
good.
I thought for half a second.
I shut it off.</v>

663
00:40:14.191 --> 00:40:19.020
I'm actually late today cause old Billy boys got a day job.
Oh,

664
00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:22.140
Billy boys get a day job right in a fucking show then.

665
00:40:22.141 --> 00:40:23.460
I can't wait for you guys to see,

666
00:40:23.461 --> 00:40:27.210
but I'm not allowed to talk about it until they announce it.

667
00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.580
Once they announce it.
I'll give you a little bit of hype on it.

668
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:35.160
I think you're going to enjoy it.
So all I can fucking say,
Hey,

669
00:40:35.161 --> 00:40:40.161
I want to thank everybody who came out to the spotlight 29 casino to see a Dean

670
00:40:40.471 --> 00:40:43.500
del Rey,
Joe Barton.
It get myself.
We had a,

671
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.130
we had a wonderful time out there.
Um,

672
00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.700
I've got to do more standup though,
man.
I really miss doing it.

673
00:40:50.701 --> 00:40:55.380
I've been writing this fucking show and uh,
kind of burning it at both ends.

674
00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.140
So,
uh,
I get to figure that out.
But I'm,

675
00:40:58.141 --> 00:41:02.010
I'm basically straight out right in this thing until thanksgiving.

676
00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:06.240
And then my schedule eases up a little bit more.
I do have coming up,

677
00:41:06.241 --> 00:41:07.500
I got some great gigs coming up.

678
00:41:07.501 --> 00:41:11.610
I'm doing the 20th anniversary of comics come home.

679
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:15.960
The great thing that,
a great benefit foundation,

680
00:41:15.961 --> 00:41:20.180
whatever the hell you call it,
the Denis leary and Cam Neely,
um,

681
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:25.290
started 20 years ago for the Cam Nealy House,
which basically when,
um,

682
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.230
unfortunately I think cam lost both of his parents.

683
00:41:28.231 --> 00:41:31.740
I know at least one of his parents,
he lost to cancer and uh,
you know,

684
00:41:31.741 --> 00:41:33.360
they weren't like the hospital and that of thing.

685
00:41:33.361 --> 00:41:35.010
So they've made up the Cam Nealy House.

686
00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.740
And so it's just a place like during treatment where people can,

687
00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:41.400
rather than sitting in a hospital can actually feel at home.
It's a great thing.

688
00:41:41.401 --> 00:41:45.780
And it's 20 years.
I can't believe that because I did either comics come home,

689
00:41:45.781 --> 00:41:46.920
two or three.

690
00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:48.510
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

691
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:52.350
<v 0>way back in 1996.
So,</v>

692
00:41:52.351 --> 00:41:57.060
I don't know if they were 94,
95,
96 that was number three.

693
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.130
If this is the 20th one,

694
00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:03.780
does this the 20th 20 years or the 20th one.
You know what I mean?

695
00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:08.160
Like he played 19 years,
20 seasons.
Like I can't figure it out,
but whatever.

696
00:42:08.161 --> 00:42:12.410
This is either the 20th of the 20th year that they've been doing it and um,

697
00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:18.440
I'm going to be up there and it's going to be an absolute murderer's row of a

698
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:22.200
standup comedians on that thing.
And uh,

699
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:25.890
one of them I can't wait to see is going to be Steven Wright who is

700
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.820
arguably one of the best comedians I've ever seen.
I mean,
he is,

701
00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:33.410
there's no argument there.
He just is.
I can't wait to see him and uh,

702
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:38.010
it's going to be awesome.
So I got that going on and then the next day,
um,

703
00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:43.100
I'm going to be a giggles comedy club and Saga Saga on like November 9th doing a

704
00:42:43.441 --> 00:42:44.340
benefit up there.

705
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:49.600
And then the following week I'm out in Florida.

706
00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:54.530
And what does that,
I didn't know what the fucking date is.
One on a 100.

707
00:42:54.531 --> 00:42:58.630
I look here Homina Homina Homina.
Um,
in November,
I'm basically,

708
00:42:58.631 --> 00:43:01.180
I'm going off for Thursday night football when the,
uh,

709
00:43:01.181 --> 00:43:04.750
the dolphins play the bills and,
uh,

710
00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:10.890
I'm going to the Thursday night game and then the next night I am in a,

711
00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:13.540
can you tell,
I'm trying to open windows.
That's why I'm fucking talking slower.

712
00:43:13.541 --> 00:43:17.500
I mean,
uh,
the,
I'm at the West Palm Beach Improv in West Palm Beach,
Florida,

713
00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:22.690
and uh,
doing a couple shows there,
uh,
me,

714
00:43:22.691 --> 00:43:25.540
Paul Versey and uh,

715
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:31.040
and the next day I'm going to the Miami Hurricane Florida Seminole game.

716
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.380
Unfortunately,
it's where the Miami hurricanes place,

717
00:43:34.381 --> 00:43:36.020
so I don't want to listen too much of that.

718
00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.500
<v 5>Oh,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.</v>

719
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.190
<v 0>Fortunately I won't have to do that.</v>

720
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.490
The amount of people who do that and actually think that that's,
you know,

721
00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:52.020
like native Americans actually used to do that.

722
00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:54.180
Like that's actually one of their songs rather than,

723
00:43:54.181 --> 00:43:58.860
it was just some horse shit that Hollywood made up that and going woo,

724
00:43:58.890 --> 00:43:59.910
they'll that bullshit.

725
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:04.171
You know,

726
00:44:04.171 --> 00:44:09.171
it's so fucking crazy is how that stuck around for this Goddamn long that people

727
00:44:11.131 --> 00:44:12.930
came up with that shit.
Do you understand that?

728
00:44:12.931 --> 00:44:15.900
They came up with that shit when people didn't even know how to act yet,

729
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.980
at least on film or whatever like that.

730
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:25.140
That was like 30 years before a why I oughta let me tell you something,
Shea,

731
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:29.310
all of that stupid fucking horrible acting before Marlon Brando came around and

732
00:44:29.311 --> 00:44:34.020
changes the game.
Um,
what's up Cleo?
What are you doing?
Come here buddy.

733
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:38.170
[inaudible]
how you doing?

734
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:44.330
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good design.
Good to see you.
Huh?

735
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.200
You taking a nap?
Yeah.
That was rough,
wasn't it?
Going to the side of the house.

736
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:53.070
Relieving yourself and then eating a whole fucking can of dog food.

737
00:44:53.071 --> 00:44:54.060
You must be exhausted.

738
00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:58.020
I can really see why you have to go there and take another nap.
Huh?

739
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:02.280
What do you do all day?
Nothing.
Why you always sleeping?

740
00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:09.420
I want an answer.
Not the microphone.

741
00:45:09.421 --> 00:45:13.680
Right in their muzzle.
I get nothing.
I get Outta here.
All right.

742
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.300
Okay.
Go on.
Fucking love that dog.

743
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:24.510
Fucking love that dog,
man.
Um,
I will never not have a dog,

744
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:28.140
you know.
In fact,
you know,
this one here,

745
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.920
if we got another dog would probably try to kill it unless it was a baby boy

746
00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:34.680
from what I heard.
So I don't need that drama in my house.

747
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.940
My dogs just psycho because somebody beat the shit out of it before I got it.
Um,

748
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.290
so I'm going to keep this dog,
you know,

749
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:48.830
and uh,
hopefully God willing.
How old is she?
Five,
six years.

750
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:52.310
I want to think about this however long she lasts.
And uh,
but then,

751
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:56.490
then the next round I'm getting to,
I mean,
need a blue nose and a red nose,

752
00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.230
a pity couple of puppies and uh,
that's it.

753
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:03.600
I'm always going to have fucking dog.
So you just make your life better.

754
00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:08.350
They really do.
So anyways,
hey,
listen to this.
Oh,
Billy fucking booze bag is a,

755
00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:12.580
is seven days.
Eight days.
I haven't drank in eight days.

756
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:16.240
It's fucking great.
Now I'm ready to go on a fucking run.

757
00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:20.000
It's all it takes is those you guys trying to knock off the booze unless you're

758
00:46:20.001 --> 00:46:21.730
have like a serious fucking alcoholic,

759
00:46:21.731 --> 00:46:24.670
which fortunately I don't suffer from that.
Um,

760
00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:28.570
it takes like five days for me is the tipping point.
If I'm like three,

761
00:46:28.571 --> 00:46:33.040
four days in,
I'm like,
Eh,
this doesn't seem like a streak.
You know,
like,
ah,

762
00:46:33.041 --> 00:46:35.050
you know what I mean?
I'm not playing tonight.
You know,

763
00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.180
I'm going to sit back and fucking drink a beer,
you know,
but I want you to get,

764
00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.470
you know,
five,
six days in ag,
a nice little run going here,

765
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:45.340
little cal Ripken junior,
junior,
junior going on here,
right?

766
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:50.170
I want to see how long I can go,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And um,

767
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.200
I went to the Er,

768
00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:56.150
I went to the store and I got a bunch of those little fucking plastic tins of a

769
00:46:56.151 --> 00:46:59.600
bunch of Veggie shit and I just shoved that down my pie hole.

770
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:04.250
And now I got my body crave and that again,
I swear to God,
man,

771
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:06.250
I swear to God.
Um,

772
00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:10.820
the amount of people who are fucking addicted to sugar and salt,

773
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:14.810
um,
has to be off the charts,
but I might be doing that thing where,

774
00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:20.090
um,
um,
taking my life and it and superimposing it on everybody else's.

775
00:47:20.091 --> 00:47:21.690
You know what I mean?
Like,
well,
if I suffer from this,

776
00:47:21.691 --> 00:47:24.080
then you must suffer from it.
But I'm telling you,

777
00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:29.110
all I have to do is wake up in the morning by Dubai dot boob and I just oatmeal

778
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.970
with a fucking banana in it.
That fills me up.

779
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.300
And then if I go and I get a salad,

780
00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:38.590
<v 7>okay,</v>

781
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:41.320
<v 0>well the fucking protein for lunch,
it's over.</v>

782
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.810
Then that's all it takes to kind of break that sugar,
salt,
sugar,

783
00:47:46.811 --> 00:47:50.560
salt,
sugar,
salt,
fucking horseshit going back and forth.
Pizza,
cookies,
ice cream,

784
00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:55.210
fucking burger fries,
and you feel it.
You feel yourself going off the rails.

785
00:47:55.211 --> 00:47:58.120
I'll fucking hyped up on the salt.
I got to get some sugar.
I got,

786
00:47:58.121 --> 00:48:02.890
I got fucking level.
Yeah,
you'd do a line of fucking sugar that levels you out.

787
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.550
Then you wake up the next day and both of them is still fighting inside your

788
00:48:06.551 --> 00:48:09.160
body and you wake up.
What do you get now?
Do you get oatmeal?
No.

789
00:48:09.161 --> 00:48:11.980
You grabbed the fruit loops,
you grabbed the fruit loops.

790
00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:14.980
Then you walk out the door,
all hopped up on sugar.
You take a handful of,

791
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.580
you fucking literally empty out all the pretzels and just drink the salt at the

792
00:48:18.581 --> 00:48:21.820
bottom of the bag just so you can get the fucking work,
you know?

793
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:26.230
When did you just keep chasing it?
So,
um,

794
00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:28.240
I actually talked to somebody on Twitter,

795
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:32.680
actually sent me a little tweets saying that they started a eating,

796
00:48:32.681 --> 00:48:34.170
like the sounds and everything and,

797
00:48:34.171 --> 00:48:37.840
and they started craving that stuff when they dropped like 20 pounds.
You know,

798
00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:40.930
obviously I'm known nutritional or fitness fucking Guru,

799
00:48:40.931 --> 00:48:44.050
but I can't tell you if you just start eating that way.
It's impossible.

800
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:48.820
Who likes going to the fucking gym?
Nobody.
What would you rather do?

801
00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:52.390
Would you rather spend 45 fucking minutes on a treadmill?

802
00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:58.480
Oh,
just sit down and over the course of five minutes,
just eat a salad.

803
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.060
Yeah.
With some funny now you know chicken breast on there are some salmon.

804
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:04.490
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

805
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:07.650
<v 0>Yeah.
Well maybe you just go like a total veggie one was some beans in there.</v>

806
00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.890
It's fucking over.
Once you rather do that,

807
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:14.550
then eating the shit you want to eat and then jumping on a treadmill,

808
00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:17.130
wearing out your hips,
your knees and your feet.

809
00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.790
Fucking trying to wrong to run one.
Oh,
let me walk the next mile.

810
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.420
Just eat a fucking salad.
Puts your feet up.

811
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.920
<v 10>He just set,
last night when I watched the game,</v>

812
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:32.450
I actually owe sitting at a cigar bar,
so I'm killing myself that way.

813
00:49:32.451 --> 00:49:35.830
But as far as food goes,
I actually,
um,

814
00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:42.080
what did I get?
I ordered this beats and goat cheese salad,

815
00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.860
which back in the day I would be like,
you fucking pussy.
Right.

816
00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.010
I threw that thing down.
My throat filled me up.

817
00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:52.550
I wasn't hungry and I woke up today and uh,
you know,

818
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.240
my alabaster stomach wasn't sticking out as far as I thought it was going to

819
00:49:56.241 --> 00:49:58.700
beat.
And we have made me happy and woke up this morning.

820
00:49:58.701 --> 00:50:02.930
Happy seeing that and what did I do?
Did I have to lift a bunch of weights?

821
00:50:02.931 --> 00:50:04.760
They have to run up and down the fucking street.

822
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.240
They have to do a bunch of burpees standing in the sand next to some fucking

823
00:50:08.241 --> 00:50:11.000
tanned up check.
Who's never going to fuck me?
No,
I didn't.

824
00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:16.120
I just sat in a fucking lazy boy and fueled my body with the Goddamn Salad.

825
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:19.730
Can't recommend it enough.
Having said all that,

826
00:50:19.731 --> 00:50:21.200
I don't know shit about nutrition.

827
00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:26.020
<v 0>Oh No.
If you get a fucking beat and goat cheese salad with a little cabin,</v>

828
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:30.050
eyes fucking pecans in,
that's absolutely delicious.

829
00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:34.470
I highly recommend it.
I want you guys walking around fucking being fat.
Fuck.

830
00:50:34.471 --> 00:50:37.970
She wants to be a fat.
Fuck you there in the back.
You want to be a fat fuck.

831
00:50:37.971 --> 00:50:40.430
Well good for you.
All right,

You have to get up to go to the post office anymore.

849
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:35.480
stamps.com turns your PC or Mac and your own personal post office that never

850
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:36.560
closes.

851
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:41.840
That never has an attitude that's never out of stamps.

852
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:48.370
Talk about convenient by in this is this,
this is my fucking contractor.

853
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.900
I swear to God.
This mother fucker.
Hang on a second.

854
00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:56.180
All right.
False alarm wasn't a contract and he's not a fucking contract.

855
00:51:56.181 --> 00:51:59.180
He's just a guy who comes up to me and I owe a bunch more money.
Hey,

856
00:51:59.181 --> 00:52:02.720

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:14.570
Then just hand your mail to the mailman or drop it in the mailbox and you'll

861
00:52:14.571 --> 00:52:18.200

All right,
let's get to the questions for this week.
All right,

871
00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:53.450
Japan.
Uh,
dear Billy,

872
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:57.800
I w I'm wondering when you're going to come to Japan and if there's a reason you

873
00:52:57.801 --> 00:52:58.634
have not.

874
00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:02.350
You have spoken about the food many times as being your favorite along with the

875
00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:06.650
Italian.
The countryside is beautiful,
so you could,
you could get an a good hike,

876
00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:10.550
uh,
love you and love Nia.
Well,
you know what,
Surf,

877
00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.280
you tell me where I can go perform over there.

878
00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:19.090
Are there enough English speaking Japanese that are going to understand my

879
00:53:19.101 --> 00:53:23.480
humor?
Because I would love to go to Tokyo.
I would.
I would love to go to Japan.

880
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:28.320
You know what?
I'm going to fucking make this happen.
That's it.
I'm going.

881
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:31.560
You tell me where to go.
You write me back?
You tell me where to go.

882
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.720
I know that there's obviously,

883
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:38.310
we still have bases over there from that whole world war.
Two things.

884
00:53:38.311 --> 00:53:40.050
Sorry about that,
by the way.
You know,

885
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:43.390
I know we went a little hardcore with the second one.
Um,

886
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:48.450
so it's about time I come over there with little fucking olive branch and do my

887
00:53:48.451 --> 00:53:51.990
stupid,
uh,
you know,
he's stupid little fucking,
uh,
tricks there.

888
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:54.690
Little somersault here,
little punchline there,
do it.

889
00:53:54.691 --> 00:53:58.350
I would absolutely love to go over there.
Um,
I,
uh,

890
00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:02.370
you know,
obviously huge fan of the food,

891
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:06.630
huge fan of the fucking architecture and everything that I've seen over there,

892
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:07.680
both the old and the new,

893
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:10.620
that whole thing where you fucking beat all those dolphins to death.

894
00:54:10.621 --> 00:54:14.590
I don't know about that shit,
but I'm sure you're not doing it.
Whatever.

895
00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:16.230
Look at that already.
We've got some comedy there.

896
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:19.470
I don't know shit about your country there.
I said it,
but I want to go.

897
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:22.920
I've never been to Asia.
I'd love to go over there.
I'd love to go to Japan,

898
00:54:22.921 --> 00:54:25.410
see the Great Wall and all of that shit.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

899
00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:29.100
I know that that's in China.
All right,
let's not get crazy.
I do.

900
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:33.180
This is what I know about Asia.
Okay.
As far as I know,

901
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:38.480
the Japanese are basically the white people of Asia in that they feel that they

902
00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:45.570
are the most superior and over the course of the centuries,

903
00:54:45.571 --> 00:54:46.530
they have tried to

904
00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:52.350
impose their will on the other people around them.
Is that true?
Why would you,

905
00:54:52.351 --> 00:54:55.410
why would I say this about the country that wants me to go there because I'm a

906
00:54:55.411 --> 00:54:59.640
fucking moron.
Then you've got Korea,
you've got North Korea,

907
00:54:59.641 --> 00:55:03.390
you got South Korea,
North Korea has that.
Uh,

908
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:07.320
one of the rarest things you'll ever see in the world,
which is an odd shape.

909
00:55:07.321 --> 00:55:11.250
Asian guy running their country.
Okay.

910
00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:16.050
The North Koreans,
so all the North Korean people are starving in.

911
00:55:16.051 --> 00:55:19.500
This guy's walking around as basically a fat face.

912
00:55:19.501 --> 00:55:23.610
Top of Shit is what kills me about this guy.

913
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.000
Okay.
If you can,
to be a dictator,
you know,

914
00:55:27.001 --> 00:55:29.100
you got to feed you if you want it to last.

915
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:33.270
I guess his dad was able to starve everybody.
Dude,

916
00:55:33.271 --> 00:55:35.580
if I was a dictator I would be such a good shit.

917
00:55:35.581 --> 00:55:37.320
No one would try and take me over.
You know,

918
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:41.960
I wouldn't be out there raping and pillaging.
I would run it nice.

919
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.950
It will be all my fucking rules.

920
00:55:43.951 --> 00:55:47.370
But I would be a nice guy about when people go,

921
00:55:47.371 --> 00:55:50.310
you know what kind of getting sick of that.
I'd be like,
you know,
I can see that.

922
00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:55.380
I can see that now because I really see it just because I don't want you guys to

923
00:55:55.381 --> 00:55:58.320
eventually come and make an attempt on my life.
So you know what?

924
00:55:58.321 --> 00:56:02.310
What would you like?
See I don't have the backbone to be a,
and then he got China,

925
00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:04.290
you got a Zillion fucking people,

926
00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:09.330
which isn't that kind of Japan's fault cause we,
they kept invading them.

927
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.681
So then they were like,

928
00:56:10.681 --> 00:56:12.420
we're going to have so many fucking people that no matter,

929
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:15.420
no matter how many of us you killed is going to be another wave coming over and

930
00:56:15.421 --> 00:56:18.660
now look at them.
God Damn air over there was like Brown.

931
00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.650
What else do I know?
Do I know anything positive?

932
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:27.460
Do I know anything positive.
Yeah.
I know something positive.

933
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.450
All the martial arts come from there.
You've got yoga came up from fucking India.

934
00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:32.603
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

935
00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:34.591
<v 0>Uh,</v>

936
00:56:34.591 --> 00:56:37.470
but I know you guys had a wonderful life until the English got there and fucked

937
00:56:37.471 --> 00:56:39.630
everything up,
which is pretty much,
you know what,

938
00:56:39.631 --> 00:56:41.370
that's the default answer around the world.
Yeah.

939
00:56:41.371 --> 00:56:44.190
Everything was going great and then the English people came there and said,

940
00:56:44.191 --> 00:56:46.530
all right,
these people here a little bit better than those people.

941
00:56:46.531 --> 00:56:49.290
They're a little bit better than those people there and we're running shit and

942
00:56:49.291 --> 00:56:53.430
go fuck yourself.
Settle in for the next hundred years.
And uh,

943
00:56:53.431 --> 00:56:54.480
then you'll force this out.

944
00:56:54.481 --> 00:56:57.630
Then we're going to leave and you guys can continue fighting this fight that we

945
00:56:57.631 --> 00:57:01.230
created that never really existed cause you really all the same people who

946
00:57:01.231 --> 00:57:05.220
should love one another and get along.
Right.
Anyways,

947
00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:09.990
Beatles album bill,
dear Billy,
100.7 FM,

948
00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:15.150
a buddy of mine recently got in an argument over which has,

949
00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:20.160
which has Beatles album.
Do you guys even reread?
What the fuck he wrote?

950
00:57:20.161 --> 00:57:24.090
A buddy of mine recently got in an argument over which Beatles album is probably

951
00:57:24.091 --> 00:57:28.050
your favorite real intellectual stuff going on over here.

952
00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.510
Just making fun of himself.
Ah,
I'm saying,

953
00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:33.120
I'm saying it's let it be or the white album.
He's,

954
00:57:33.121 --> 00:57:36.750
he says it's a rubber sole.

955
00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:42.120
Um,
oh,
come on man.
How do you pick a favorite Beatles album?
I mean,

956
00:57:42.121 --> 00:57:46.810
I definitely like their shit after,
uh,
you know,
they did,

957
00:57:46.811 --> 00:57:49.260
they weren't clean cut.
Just singing like,

958
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.670
<v 3>okay,</v>

959
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:55.580
<v 0>you know,
where's [inaudible] name is now?
I hate that shit.
She loves you.
Yeah.</v>

960
00:57:55.581 --> 00:58:00.450
Yeah.
Hate that shit.
But when they grow out the hair and started doing drugs,

961
00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:05.460
I love all of that shit.
Um,
but it's been so long since I've listened to them.

962
00:58:05.461 --> 00:58:07.260
I,
I,
I'll have to get back to you on that one.

963
00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:14.160
What's amazing about beetles music is the,
uh,
is the shit that they talk about.

964
00:58:14.161 --> 00:58:18.150
It's still fucking timeless.
What's that wants to harm?
Looking through you?

965
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:23.130
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you.
What did I know?

966
00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:28.320
You don't look dear Fred,
but things have changed.

967
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:32.910
I'm looking through you.
You're not the same,
right.
That's just classic.

968
00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:34.980
When you're in a fucking relationship,

969
00:58:34.981 --> 00:58:39.450
when you're young and you think you're really into this person and just one day,

970
00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:44.660
the way they answer the phone,
hi,
they just do something.
He just like,
ugh.

971
00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:48.540
Just like this isn't,
you think they changed?

972
00:58:48.541 --> 00:58:52.210
It's just you're just learning more about the person and you're realizing like,

973
00:58:52.211 --> 00:58:54.780
guys,
this isn't,
this isn't what I thought it was going to be.

974
00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:56.850
Kind of like my house.

975
00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:03.900
So I liked that one.
I also like,
obviously like the white album

976
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:07.250
I like,
I love let it be,

977
00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:11.590
I mean sergeant pepper may come on and then he got real Volvo.

978
00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:14.150
I like all of those.
You know?

979
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:18.080
You know what's funny is it's been so long since those albums come out that

980
00:59:18.081 --> 00:59:20.570
there's a lot of young people that think the Beatles actually aren't,

981
00:59:20.571 --> 00:59:24.500
is there are or they stink.
And um,

982
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.550
that,
that's just because all that fucking music has come out since then.

983
00:59:28.551 --> 00:59:29.900
It's completely ripped them off.

984
00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:35.690
It's kind of like the Richard Pryor thing where how fucking brilliant he was.

985
00:59:35.691 --> 00:59:39.770
And then after like the fifth or sixth season of def jam comedy,

986
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:44.450
well everybody was doing those white people do this.
Black people do that shit.

987
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:45.440
And it was just,

988
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:49.520
it turned in from Richard Pryor's specific white guy that he was doing to just

989
00:59:49.521 --> 00:59:52.570
that generic,
ah,
I've got to go do my taxes.
It,

990
00:59:52.571 --> 00:59:57.571
it just kind of took away some of the shit that he was doing.

991
00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:00.200
The only way to try it because there's no way to go back in time.

992
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:05.690
The only way to try to like
get yourself in that head space,

993
01:00:05.691 --> 01:00:10.691
look at like a top 20 out top 100 and see what else was in the top 10 and listen

994
01:00:11.991 --> 01:00:14.630
to that shit versus the Beatles album.
Um,

995
01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:18.260
I guess that's the closest thing I would say.
Um,

996
01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:23.420
I dunno,
who knows.
Anyways.
All Right,
Bill,
I'm a female and I love your comedy.

997
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:26.780
Oh my God.
Ding,
Ding,
Ding,
Ding.
We have a winner.
Well,

998
01:00:26.781 --> 01:00:30.280
I'm going to be cliche and start by telling you what a huge fan of [inaudible]

999
01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:32.570
yet,
but thank you.
Thank you so much.
Uh,

1000
01:00:32.571 --> 01:00:34.910
I have so many female friends that the are the,

1001
01:00:34.911 --> 01:00:36.740
are the epitome of what you say about them.

1002
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.130
No Day off for their man are constantly wanting to fix or change them.

1003
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.860
I've always been pretty mellow and from what my husband says,

1004
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:47.540
I am a dude trapped in a girl's body.
I'm sure he might be exaggerating a bit,

1005
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:50.330
but it makes me smile to know he thinks that I'm cool.
Oh yeah.

1006
01:00:50.331 --> 01:00:52.970
That's one of the best compliments you can get if a guy,

1007
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:56.810
if he your boyfriend or husband or whatever thinks you're cool.

1008
01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:02.000
Um,
and I know I'm not trying to be a fucking sexist.
Can't hear like,
oh,

1009
01:01:02.001 --> 01:01:05.990
you should be.
Oh Wow.
I'm so flattered that you fucking gave me that compliment.

1010
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:09.680
All right.
Don't get your tits in an uproar here.
I'm just saying if,
if,

1011
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.340
if the guy in your life actually,
if you're fun to hang out with,

1012
01:01:13.341 --> 01:01:17.840
that's a very rare thing because usually we're trying to get away from you.
Um,

1013
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:21.440
anyways,
she says,
I'm rambling now.
You know,
for now,
you know,

1014
01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:24.380
for sure I'm a woman.
Uh,
she goes,
I spoke,

1015
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.400
I saw this quote from a movie and wanted to share it with you.
Uh,

1016
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.020
do not try to change him.

1017
01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:35.090
That's why so many marriages fail before he removes the wedding veil.

1018
01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:39.320
The wife starts to change the husband's happiness,
his thoughts,
his friends.

1019
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:42.710
And when she's brainwashed him and re mothered him completely,

1020
01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:45.620
she wonders what happened to the man that fascinated her.

1021
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.150
The one she fell in love with.
Just a thought.
Just thought you would enjoy that.

1022
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:53.060
And hopefully one of these days we'll be able to see you live.

1023
01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:57.320
You were on our bucket list.
Joking.
Uh,
thanks for your time.

1024
01:01:57.321 --> 01:02:02.030
Faithful Fan.
No.
These two emails deal with the same situation.

1025
01:02:02.031 --> 01:02:04.790
Might want to read both together and give one answer.
Oh,
that's from,
uh,

1026
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:08.090
my guy here.
All right,
well I'll read them both together then.

1027
01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:12.080
How to change gears with the lady.
Hey Bill,

1028
01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.990
I've been away from home for nine months and whenever I get a little blue

1029
01:02:14.991 --> 01:02:18.370
missing friends and family from back home,
I just tossed in your Po.

1030
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:22.360
I've got enough.
The compliments,
no one won.
I appreciate him.
But,
uh,

1031
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:23.660
people just want to hear the question here.

1032
01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.970
I was hoping you could give me some advice.

1033
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:31.030
I'm living in a little house in Indonesia with a lady who had been best friends

1034
01:02:31.041 --> 01:02:34.520
with for six years.
We're staying here for the next month.

1035
01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:38.030
I hadn't seen this girl in over a year before we met up a few days ago.

1036
01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:41.840
Problem is in the last couple of days.
I've totally fallen for her.
Oh.

1037
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.830
[inaudible] I'm not sure why I never felt this way about her until now.

1038
01:02:45.831 --> 01:02:48.950
Probably because you're in fucking Indonesia.
You know,

1039
01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:53.280
that's probably,
we'd probably in the middle of fucking nowhere.

1040
01:02:53.281 --> 01:02:55.780
And you just see your only option.
You have the most beautiful girl.
I remember.

1041
01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.670
Uh,
we've always made each other laugh and always loved the same things,

1042
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.713
but we never

1043
01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:02.373
<v 5>gotcha.</v>

1044
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.170
<v 0>What am I going to do here?
I'm just going to let it ring.</v>

1045
01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:10.040
Who answers their home phone anymore?
Hi,

1046
01:03:10.041 --> 01:03:13.550
my name is Bert Lundquist and I'm running for fucking state cutlet.

1047
01:03:13.551 --> 01:03:14.384
Whatever the fuck it is.

1048
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:18.170
We've always made each other laugh and always loved the same things,

1049
01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.490
but we never,
we just never went the boy,
uh,
beyond a friendship.

1050
01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:26.900
Now I'm really jealous when I see her around other guys.
So here's my big idea.

1051
01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.300
I was thinking about asking her out on a date.

1052
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.810
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1053
01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:34.790
<v 0>Why don't I have the default ringer at like two rinks.</v>

1054
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:36.220
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1055
01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:40.000
<v 0>Because I never do anything to make my life easy.
One more</v>

1056
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.193
and that should be it.

1057
01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:50.680
Dude.
I fucked by.
You can't.
All right.
Anyways,
he goes,
I know.

1058
01:03:50.681 --> 01:03:53.170
It's weird because we're sharing a house

1059
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.370
and we know each other so well,
but I thought it would be better to just say,

1060
01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:04.630
do you want to go on a date with me?
And then offered to take her out for dinner?

1061
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:09.980
Are you fucking serious?
And to see a band?

1062
01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:12.873
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1063
01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:15.380
<v 0>Oh my God.
Who is on the other end that isn't hanging up yet?</v>

1064
01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.480
I'm going to pick that up and it's going to go seven days.

1065
01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.720
I'm not picking up

1066
01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:33.680
Chris.
All right.
We know each other so well,

1067
01:04:33.681 --> 01:04:35.300
but I thought it would be better to just say,

1068
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:38.870
do you want to go on a date with me and then offer to take her out for dinner

1069
01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:42.560
and to see a band like a,
what if this was someone I just met?

1070
01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:47.090
Rather than make some heavy confession about my feelings that way it's more of a

1071
01:04:47.091 --> 01:04:48.390
fun thing.
We could try rent,

1072
01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.730
we could try rather as more of a funding we could try rather than some big

1073
01:04:52.731 --> 01:04:57.320
series decision she has to make.
I thought if she was a bit reluctant,

1074
01:04:57.321 --> 01:05:01.070
I might try saying that a friendship is strong enough to survive one bad date.

1075
01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:04.700
Dude,
I think you're killing it right now.
I would have never thought to do that.

1076
01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:08.040
I would have been like good too low.
You feel though.
Fuck that.

1077
01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.200
I like what you're doing.
I like it way better.

1078
01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.050
So am I am more than for thinking this.
Absolutely not.

1079
01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:17.890
Is this just going to make our month together and uh,

1080
01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.610
in this place awkward and potentially ruin the trip?

1081
01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:24.600
Should I just keep my mouth shut and try to enjoy the fact that this amazing

1082
01:05:24.601 --> 01:05:27.900
woman is my friend.
Thanks in advance,
Bill.
You're one of a kind.

1083
01:05:27.901 --> 01:05:31.650
I know that I tried to ask the,
listen,

1084
01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.830
I think you should do exactly what you want to do.
Who knows?

1085
01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:37.500
Maybe these feelings are real.
Maybe they are not.
And you know,

1086
01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:42.030
you wouldn't be a man if you didn't ruin a friendship with your Dick.
You know,

1087
01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.070
everybody does it.
Everybody does it.

1088
01:05:44.071 --> 01:05:47.430
And I don't know how that tied into the one above here,
but uh,

1089
01:05:47.431 --> 01:05:52.090
I think you're killing it.
But as far as that quote that that woman said,
um,

1090
01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:53.880
<v 7>okay.</v>

1091
01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.260
<v 10>Yeah,
I would agree.
I would agree with that.</v>

1092
01:05:55.261 --> 01:05:56.850
But I also think guys do the same thing.

1093
01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:00.090
<v 0>Guys do the same.
You don't want to,
you know what also happens,</v>

1094
01:06:00.091 --> 01:06:04.410
I think in a relationship is you get so comfortable if you forget to keep

1095
01:06:04.411 --> 01:06:06.930
yourself looking good around each other,
you know what I mean?

1096
01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:12.400
Is there anything fucking worse than when you interrelationship and you,
you,

1097
01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:15.720
your girlfriend is just comfortable coming out.
Just dress like shit.

1098
01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.960
And I'm not saying that she always has to get fucking dolled up,
but you know,

1099
01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:24.570
it's the end of the night.
We're going to go watch a watch a fucking movie,

1100
01:06:24.571 --> 01:06:25.404
you know?

1101
01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:30.770
How long does it take to put on some fucking cute little Pajama fucking half

1102
01:06:30.781 --> 01:06:34.170
little horse halter top kind of thing?
You can't do that.
That takes two seconds.

1103
01:06:34.171 --> 01:06:38.010
Put your hair in a fucking pony tail bank,
bank,
boom.
You come out,

1104
01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:42.780
you make me feel like good.
Yeah.
All right.
I know I am.
I made a good choice here.

1105
01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:49.090
Yeah,
you come out,
you're fucking yes.
You know,
and that God damn fat suit,

1106
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:51.490
whatever the funny and I'll it sweatpants and a hoodie.

1107
01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:54.200
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1108
01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:58.020
<v 0>Toes all fucked up.
I mean,
I,
and I just,
it's just,
you know,
it's,
it's off.</v>

1109
01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:00.560
And then the same thing goes for the guys.
You know what I mean?

1110
01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:01.860
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1111
01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:02.910
<v 10>All of a sudden you get a woman,</v>

1112
01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.750
you started even fucking Mozzarella sticks and all that shit.

1113
01:07:06.751 --> 01:07:09.450
You coming out there with your wife beater and your man tits hanging out the

1114
01:07:09.451 --> 01:07:13.020
fucking side,
like John Bonham towards the end of his career,

1115
01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:17.690
that awful fucking picture when he's sitting down
this or this.

1116
01:07:17.691 --> 01:07:21.470
This is a critical thing when you're fat standing up too.
All right?

1117
01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:24.950
The last thing you need to do is fucking sit down with a wife Beater Ron.

1118
01:07:24.951 --> 01:07:28.610
Cause then it's just,
it's just the roles.
So they don't want to see that either.

1119
01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:29.660
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1120
01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.760
<v 10>That's the thing is a guy,
man,
you got,
you got,
you know,</v>

1121
01:07:31.761 --> 01:07:34.100
keep yourself in good shape,

1122
01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:37.080
shower and all that type of shit.

1123
01:07:37.081 --> 01:07:40.050
Just try to keep doing that throughout the fucking relationship.

1124
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.580
Common out all fucking scruffy and bleary-eyed.

1125
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.640
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1126
01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.930
<v 10>You know,
working on a pair of man tits,
uh,</v>

1127
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:50.690
women don't want to look at that same way.

1128
01:07:50.691 --> 01:07:53.150
We don't want to look at them looking all fucked up.
So there you go.

1129
01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.340
Don't take the person you're with for granted.
All right,

1130
01:07:57.350 --> 01:07:59.680
look at me just telling everybody what the fuck did know.
All right,

1131
01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.000
last one I got to do and then I got it.

1132
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:06.300
<v 0>Gotta go to work.
Yep.
Bup,
Bup,
bup,
bup,
bup,
bup,
Buh.
[inaudible].
All right.</v>

1133
01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.850
Hey,
contraceptive pill bill.

1134
01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:13.740
I'm coming to the end of my high school life with just a few weeks ago and

1135
01:08:13.741 --> 01:08:17.390
there's one girl I've been waiting to ask out for awhile.
Well,

1136
01:08:17.391 --> 01:08:22.220
don't wait any longer.
Uh,
she's hot,
smart,
funny,
witty.

1137
01:08:22.221 --> 01:08:23.150
You fucking get it.

1138
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:27.950
But she's in a different social group to me and I just know how I sh I just

1139
01:08:27.951 --> 01:08:31.040
don't know how I should go about asking route since we spent most of the past

1140
01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:34.130
two years taking the same classes yet I've barely talked to her.

1141
01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:37.910
How would you go about talking to this girl that you have spent a lot of time

1142
01:08:37.911 --> 01:08:40.790
around,
uh,
around you?
Uh,

1143
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:44.420
you both know each other,
but you kept clear of,

1144
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.520
I feel like if I don't make a move,

1145
01:08:46.521 --> 01:08:49.640
I'll regret not doing it for the rest of my life since she seems like she would

1146
01:08:49.641 --> 01:08:52.730
be an ideal girlfriend or response would be great.
Love the podcast.

1147
01:08:52.731 --> 01:08:56.270
Go Fuck yourself and get your alabaster ass down to Australia soon,
please.

1148
01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.430
All right,
dude.
Uh,
what we should do.

1149
01:08:58.431 --> 01:09:01.070
You should just go fucking ask her out because here's the thing.

1150
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:05.960
Nothing bad will come of that.
Okay?
You won't have regret.

1151
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:11.420
You'll fucking get over a fear which will help you further down the line.

1152
01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:16.340
And even if this woman says no,
now who knows?
Four or five years later,

1153
01:09:16.341 --> 01:09:18.710
you run into her and she remembered that you liked her.

1154
01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:20.720
You already broke down that fucking door.

1155
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:26.330
You might banger or go out with their and fall in love with her ft of 50th

1156
01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:29.450
fucking high school union.
So this is what you do for this is what I wish I did.

1157
01:09:29.451 --> 01:09:34.070
This is what you do right here.
Fucking ask her up.
She says no,

1158
01:09:34.071 --> 01:09:39.020
just ask a bunch of them out.
Get Gino fucking lay the groundwork.

1159
01:09:39.021 --> 01:09:39.980
You like a salesman.

1160
01:09:39.981 --> 01:09:43.790
You may can pussy cold calls here right now for the rest of your high school

1161
01:09:43.791 --> 01:09:44.540
career.

1162
01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:49.540
And then you hit every fucking reunion and you show up with a God damn fucking

1163
01:09:50.661 --> 01:09:54.410
if some sunglasses and his fucking white scarf wrapped around your fucking neck

1164
01:09:54.411 --> 01:09:56.540
like a hero.
And I'm telling you,

1165
01:09:56.541 --> 01:09:58.880
you'll be fucking pulling pussy out of there like,
uh,

1166
01:09:58.910 --> 01:10:02.240
like those fucking Japanese guys club and those fucking dolphins to death.

1167
01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.050
It's a bad reference,
but you know what I mean,
that that's what you should do.

1168
01:10:06.051 --> 01:10:09.410
Should absolutely 100% ask her out or whatever.
Just come walking up to a,

1169
01:10:09.411 --> 01:10:12.830
how you doing?
She knows you fucking name.
She'll say a low back

1170
01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:15.980
and just say,
listen,
you know,

1171
01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:18.980
I've kind of been staring at your tits last couple of,
I don't say that.
Whatever.

1172
01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:22.730
It just fucking,
just ask around,
just fucking ascar out.

1173
01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:26.870
Nothing bad will come.
She has even,
even if she says no,

1174
01:10:26.871 --> 01:10:28.850
she might say to her friends,
she had believe who asked me.
Oh,

1175
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:32.210
so and so asked you.
Oh,
and one of them's going to respect it and be like,

1176
01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:35.540
I didn't know he had that in him.
Maybe one of them gets a little insecure.

1177
01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:39.080
Why he doesn't like my rock and fucking hoo ha.
And next thing you know,

1178
01:10:39.081 --> 01:10:42.320
you've got that coming down the pike.
Okay,

1179
01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:44.840
you got to get on the phone.

1180
01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:48.140
You got to make your calls in the morning or you don't get any sales at night.

1181
01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.160
All right,
that's the fucking point.
That's the podcast for this week.

1182
01:10:52.161 --> 01:10:55.640
Everybody go fuck yourselves.
Uh,

1183
01:10:55.790 --> 01:11:00.680
my prediction for the Patriots,
jets,
uh,
if it's at the Patriots,

1184
01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:05.720
I say we win if it's at the jets.
Um,

1185
01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:06.613
I don't know,

1186
01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.950
but I think it's going to be a close game despite the fact that the jets

1187
01:11:09.951 --> 01:11:14.220
allegedly suck in all of this shit.
This is the classic game

1188
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:18.720
<v 10>where gamblers fall into just looking at the numbers and looking at the records</v>

1189
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.010
and all of that shit.

1190
01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.870
And what you have to understand is every week what blows up your parlay.

1191
01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:29.010
There's always that game with something happened.
It makes no fucking sense.

1192
01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:33.960
All right.
The old chaos theory,
like Jurassic fucking park there.

1193
01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.410
I,
the jets always play as tough.

1194
01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:40.620
If we go in there and we kicked the shit out of him,

1195
01:11:40.621 --> 01:11:44.220
then they truly are a tough fucking team.
Um,

1196
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:48.960
I dunno,
I just,
I don't,
I don't have faith in the Patriots.

1197
01:11:48.961 --> 01:11:51.000
I just feel like Tom Brady has been on his back the whole,

1198
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.940
even yesterday I was on his fucking back more than I've seen.

1199
01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.340
He's been on his back more this fucking season.

1200
01:11:56.341 --> 01:11:59.730
I've seen in this goddamned career.
I still think we're working that out.

1201
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.850
And Ridley went down and Mayo went down and I don't think,

1202
01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.800
obviously they're going to be back for the Thursday game.

1203
01:12:04.801 --> 01:12:07.830
I haven't looked at the sports page yet to see how bad it is.
So,
uh,

1204
01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:13.050
that's a huge blow to our defense and our running game.
So,
uh,

1205
01:12:13.051 --> 01:12:15.590
we got a lot closer to the fucking jets.
All right.

1206
01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:18.330
Take that with a grain of salt because I don't know what the fuck I'm talking

1207
01:12:18.331 --> 01:12:20.970
about.
That's the podcasts.
Go fuck yourselves.
We'll talk to you next week.
