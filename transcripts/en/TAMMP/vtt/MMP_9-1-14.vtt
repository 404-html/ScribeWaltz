00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.553
Okay.

2
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.290
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on as bill burn?
It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,</v>

3
00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:09.010
September 1st,

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.540
2014 bomp bomp bomp bomp Boda Boda Buddha.
Do Buddhas

5
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.390
eat some fucking shit?
Fat,
tits,
fat.
It's fat.

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.430
It's you guys ready?
Huh?
Football season.

7
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.690
Time to stop working out everybody.
The summer is over.

8
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.510
The summer is over time to watch people in way better shape than you making way

9
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:39.620
more money than you was.
You get fatter and dumber.
I don't know about you guys,

10
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:42.170
but I can't fucking wait.
Okay.

11
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.030
I'm putting away my little speedo fucking bathing suit for the rest of the

12
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.830
summer.
I am now taking out my football shit,

13
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.400
my jerseys and my stupid fucking hardhat that I put those construction.

14
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.800
You know I don't do construction,
but I have a fucking logo on the side.

15
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.990
Don't you hate that somebody did that back then?

16
00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:02.900
I think the Steeler fans were the first ones to do that and they actually were

17
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:06.290
building bridges and they actually worked at construction sites.

18
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.500
Then after a while you just kind of look at somebody going like,

19
00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:11.480
is that a foreman?
I don't think has that an account.

20
00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:16.460
I think there's an account is that a fake fucking construction had?
Um,

21
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.691
anyways,

22
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:22.550
I'm so fucking beyond excited that it's football season.

23
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:26.920
It's been a while.
It has been awhile since I got this excited and uh,

24
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.580
I watched a little bit of college football.
I did my usual a rooting against.

25
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.580
I don't even know why I root against Alabama.
I don't,

26
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.950
I don't really not like them.
I'm a fucking,
you know,

27
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:40.740
I'm a guy from Massachusetts.
Where do I get off not liking a,

28
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.010
the Alabama Crimson tide over you fucking say crimson tide.

29
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:46.310
You know,

30
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.600
I just somehow fell into with Lsu and I missed every second in that game because

31
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:55.250
I was doing the other wonderful odd ball tour.
But uh,
I,
uh,

32
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.050
I can see went down by 20 something and they came back and won.
So,
um,

33
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.760
that's great that they did that.

34
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:04.550
But that's not really an impressive way to start,
you know,

35
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:09.260
against boring ass fucking Wisconsin.
What do they do?
Run the ball to death.

36
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.140
I'm just fucking with you,
Wisconsin.
All right.

37
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.640
I just wanted to get you up off the couch away from that giant fucking cheese

38
00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:19.970
block or whatever the fuck it is she doing.
Okay.

39
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.740
He's sitting there with his and her cargo shorts on.
Um,
car girl,

40
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.780
I can't talk.
Fuck you.

41
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:31.550
I just got off a plane and I ran home to do this on Labor Day.
Happy Labor Day.

42
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:34.700
Everybody,
um,
help you fucking,
um,

43
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.150
ob not listening to this right now because that would mean that you're out with

44
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:42.770
some friends and shit.
Right?
Unless you listened to this later,
at which point,

45
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:44.780
you know,
maybe he had a falling out,

46
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.620
maybe finally just fucking broke it off with somebody.

47
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.760
And I don't even mean in like a romantic way.

48
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.500
You had a romantic relationship.
How about you just fucking get rid of a friend?

49
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:01.570
Is there's a great new year's resolution to make in September,

50
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.400
September 1st isn't it the Chinese year,
New Year or something?

51
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.770
The year or the oscillating fan,
whatever the fuck it is.
I don't know.
Um,

52
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.490
that's a great thing to do.

53
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.350
<v 0>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.630
<v 1>Especially after the,
I don't know,
depending on how old you are,</v>

55
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.340
you've had friends for a long fucking time.
This,
this gotta be one of them.

56
00:03:23.341 --> 00:03:26.370
You gotta be like,
you know what?
I'm just sick of your shit.
I'm sick.

57
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.480
You know what?
I'm sick of the ride.
It's the same fucking ride.

58
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.860
And it ends up with an apology as you're pulling into the station up,
dude,

59
00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:36.550
I'm sorry,
but blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

60
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.730
And then when you should get off the ride and you don't,

61
00:03:38.731 --> 00:03:43.040
you stay on and here we go again going up the hill.
But the,
but the do,

62
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.240
everything seems good.
Everything seems good.

63
00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:47.640
And they fucking cross that line again.
All right.

64
00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:50.490
And then you go around the fucking rollercoaster.
That's the big God damn fight.

65
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:54.380
And then you pull in.
Yeah,
you're right.
I'm sorry.
You know,

66
00:03:54.381 --> 00:03:56.190
I've just been going through some shit lately,

67
00:03:56.191 --> 00:03:59.010
but multiple pit bull and then you're forgiven.

68
00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:02.520
Asked says it's okay and you get back on the fucking right again.
Um,

69
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:04.510
<v 0>okay.</v>

70
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.740
<v 1>Get off the fucking ride.</v>

71
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.860
Is there a talk show about that?

72
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.790
There's all kinds of talk shows about romantic relationships,

73
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:17.860
but is there anything out there that just talks about,

74
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.010
I guess that court TV is friendships gone wrong,

75
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.480
those stupid TV judges sit there screaming and everybody,

76
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.300
cause they're trying to get you to quit flipping channels.

77
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.240
What is it about watching somebody getting yelled at?

78
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:34.840
You just have to stop and watch.
I hate those judge shows.

79
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.880
I don't care about the people.
I don't care about their fucking problems and how,

80
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:40.241
you know,

81
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:45.070
he took one of the fucking pickets out of my fence so I threw some dog shit over

82
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:48.040
his fence and then he fucking pissed in my car.
I mean,

83
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.690
I mean they're not even that compelling,
you know,

84
00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:55.570
dumb it down to the level of my act and that's basically what's going on.

85
00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:58.720
And then at some point somebody talks and then the judge has got to start

86
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.120
screaming and yelling.

87
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.660
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

88
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.010
<v 1>I hate how they have the actual authority still of a judge.
You know what I mean?</v>

89
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.490
You should.
It should be like optional.

90
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.020
Whether you listened to them at not and I don't give a fuck all you people out

91
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:17.671
there right now going,

92
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:20.740
well actually you know judge Wapner was actual judge and all these people.

93
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:24.820
Actually I don't give a shit.
All right.
The second year on TV,

94
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:28.540
you're not a judge anymore.
That's like the old timers game for judges.

95
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:31.150
You know like one of right before the all star game,
right.

96
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:34.660
They'll have an old rod Carue will come out and all the greats,

97
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.630
you know when they're swinging the bat and they can barely fucking run cause

98
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:40.270
they're in their sixties as the same thing with these judges.

99
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.530
Once you go on TV,
you're not,
you're not your job anymore,

100
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.663
I don't think.

101
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.970
Unless you're in show business and you were a dancing monkey from your first

102
00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:55.740
fucking open mic.
Like what's his face?

103
00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.890
The Guy who looks like a fucking cop from the 1970s Dr Phil,

104
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.880
a crooked cop at that.
Right?
That guy,
he's not a therapist.

105
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.070
He's not a therapist anymore.
He is a fucking TV star with groupies.

106
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.370
Right?
Cocaine if he wants it,
it's not a therapist.

107
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.330
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
I'm not a fuck I got onto this thing.

108
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:23.300
All I know is it's Labor Labor Day.

109
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.360
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

110
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.040
<v 1>Okay.
And I,
and I,
and it's,
this is,</v>

111
00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:31.390
this is the perfect fucking holiday to set off the football season.
You know,

112
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:34.270
the one day a week,
that one game,
that fucking couch,

113
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.930
they all count cause there's only 16 of them.
So they're all important.

114
00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:40.600
Two game losing streak.
You're,
you're,
you're in trouble.

115
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.593
<v 0>Right?</v>

116
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.260
<v 1>Those football players had been working out all God damn summer to get into peak</v>

117
00:06:49.261 --> 00:06:50.100
physical condition.

118
00:06:50.101 --> 00:06:54.060
And what better way to honor them than to sit down and just completely blow out

119
00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:56.060
your fucking body.
That's what I plan on doing.

120
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

121
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.260
<v 1>Sick of this fucking working out shit.</v>

122
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.310
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

123
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.080
<v 1>I want to fucking,
I want to grill.</v>

124
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.890
That's what I want to do for the whole football season.

125
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.130
I'm gonna fucking grill something different is what I would like to do.

126
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.330
Eat like an angel all fucking week.
Right.
My little button nose.
You know,

127
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.770
my dreamy eyes.

128
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.480
I'm just going to add another compliment to every physical thing that I have.

129
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.293
<v 0>MMM.</v>

130
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.270
<v 1>No,
I should say dreamy eyes.
I've got to make it easier for you guys.</v>

131
00:07:25.271 --> 00:07:29.770
My confident forehead.
I don't know what that means.

132
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.770
Um,
anyways.

133
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:34.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

134
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.330
<v 1>That's what I want to fucking do.</v>

135
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.520
<v 2>And uh,</v>

136
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.780
<v 1>I actually have a little bit of time off this year cause</v>

137
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.033
<v 2>uh,</v>

138
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.170
<v 1>I just decided to take some fucking time off.
You know,</v>

139
00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:48.730
cause I get the NFL package every year,

140
00:07:48.731 --> 00:07:51.550
but it's usually like today I come flying back from the fucking road.

141
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.700
I already know what happened and I sit down and I can sort of fast forward my

142
00:07:54.701 --> 00:07:55.391
way through the game,

143
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:58.300
but I don't get to go through all the emotion of it and any of that type of
shit.

144
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.230
So this year,
this fucking year,
I plan on doing it.

145
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.380
<v 0>Okay.</v>

146
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.590
<v 1>I plan on doing it so I don't,
I don't really know what's going on in football.</v>

147
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:08.170
The game I watched,
I watched,
uh,

148
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.750
I watched West Virginia versus Alabama and I really resent the highlights of

149
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:18.290
that game where they just keep showing Alabama scoring when there wasn't some

150
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:21.590
major concern going on down there in Tuscaloosa,
ski there.

151
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.610
And I was like tweeted for those of you follow me on Twitter.
Um,

152
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.930
that was a close fucking game and uh,
I didn't see Lsu,

153
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:32.720
but I imagine I wouldn't have been impressed with them either if they got down

154
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:36.500
by 20 something and I know they'll fuck they were playing or Wisconsin.

155
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:37.430
That's why I brought it up.

156
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.300
<v 2>Um,
but uh,</v>

157
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.441
<v 1>and I was at me,</v>

158
00:08:41.441 --> 00:08:44.980
but that was sort of supposed to be a cupcake game for Alabama and they,
uh,

159
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.770
I dunno.
Hey,
by the way,
his lane Kiffin uh,
whatever his fucking name is,

160
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:53.470
is he associated with Alabama?

161
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:57.980
I wasn't sure the first 58 fucking times they showed that guy what was the big

162
00:08:57.981 --> 00:08:59.000
fucking deal,

163
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.083
<v 3>you know?</v>

164
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.180
<v 1>Yeah.
He had a great job at Tennessee,
told them to go fuck themselves.</v>

165
00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:11.920
I'd rather be out here in USC,
you know,
tagging some Hollywood pussy.

166
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.550
<v 3>Okay.</v>

167
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.130
<v 1>Then he went to the fucking Raiders and now he's back there.
It gives a shit.</v>

168
00:09:16.131 --> 00:09:20.180
He's a coach.
You hang around long enough,
you're going to get fired or whatever.

169
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.540
Or if you're smart enough,
you leave early.
That's the game I want to see.

170
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.120
I want to see when Alabama

171
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.860
goes up to Tennessee and it's the first time lane Kiffin uh,

172
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:33.600
has been there since he fucking left.

173
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.430
Now for those of you don't watch college football,

174
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:39.210
they take it really seriously down there in the south,

175
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.260
especially in the sec.
And by the way,
they've got this great commercial now,

176
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:47.670
how they swept all the awards,
any fucking major award that you could be.

177
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.130
There could be one last year.
The SEC did it.

178
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.580
That's never been done by any conference and they won the fucking national
title.

179
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.961
So a,

180
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:57.930
I think they have bragging rights straight across the board and everybody else

181
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:01.890
has to pipe down.
But uh,
so anyways,
they take the shit real seriously.

182
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:04.950
So out there in Knoxville,
Tennessee,
for those of you never been there,

183
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:07.620
it's in the eastern part of the state.
It is on east coast time.

184
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.103
<v 3>Okay.</v>

185
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.360
<v 1>If you're thinking about driving from xannies and Nashville to drive over to a</v>

186
00:10:13.361 --> 00:10:15.060
fucking game,
you will lose an hour.

187
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.833
<v 3>Okay.</v>

188
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.680
<v 1>And you might miss the beginning of the game,</v>

189
00:10:18.681 --> 00:10:22.520
but you can still drive back and make your show.
All right.
Um,

190
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.940
although I never did it,
it was just going to be too much of a fucking trash.

191
00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:27.620
But that is one of my bucket lists games.

192
00:10:27.621 --> 00:10:30.890
I want to go to that stadium with the Purina Cat Chow,
fucking Ah,

193
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.973
<v 3>you know,</v>

194
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.350
<v 1>and zone painted.
And everybody's going like,
dude,
you don't want to go out there.</v>

195
00:10:36.351 --> 00:10:37.730
I know this guy from Tennessee.
Right.

196
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.060
And he fucking said they're animals don't go out there.
And it's just like,

197
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.650
what the fuck's going to happen to me?

198
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.450
I'll put it on a Tennessee hat and I'll just fucking whatever they say,

199
00:10:47.451 --> 00:10:48.320
I'll just say it to,

200
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:49.570
<v 3>yeah,</v>

201
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:54.310
<v 1>like some guy are,
you fucking know.</v>

202
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:59.530
You fucking know it.
Give me some of that and then I'll just keep walking in.

203
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:00.850
Nobody's gonna fuck with me.

204
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.660
I just want to go see it.
So anyways,

205
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.740
lane Kiffin was the head coach at Tennessee.

206
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.520
Tennessee has that sort of up and down.
But I mean,
generally speaking,

207
00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:17.150
as a respected program,
as far as I know,
and what I know of it was,
since,

208
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.640
you know,
Peyton manning was there,
so I don't know shit about it.

209
00:11:19.641 --> 00:11:23.120
So I'm going to talk about it without knowing and all you people in Knoxville

210
00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:24.470
can tell me what a dumped fuck I am.

211
00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:27.650
And I don't give a shit as long as you listen,
as long as you listen.

212
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.010
So anyways,
uh,

213
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.200
so he goes there and he's going to turn the program around,
right?
Yup.

214
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.980
Buckets.
They all sound the same,
right?
Bap,
bap,
bap,
bap,
bap.

215
00:11:41.981 --> 00:11:44.930
It's all the same fucking song.
Um,

216
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.150
<v 3>okay.</v>

217
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.280
<v 1>So anyways,
he's going to go there.</v>

218
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.710
He's going to turn this fucking program around and then all of a sudden USC out

219
00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:52.990
of nowhere,
you know,
he probably gave the big long speech,
you know,

220
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.680
going to turn this program around 10,
she's had a long and storied history.

221
00:11:57.681 --> 00:12:02.340
You have a wedding,
a Gi by planned your restore that blah blah blah.

222
00:12:02.341 --> 00:12:06.150
So all these fucking Knoxvillians.
Okay.

223
00:12:06.151 --> 00:12:10.980
They're out there shining up.
They're smokers.
They buy an extra tens of chew,

224
00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.460
their crease in the visor on their hat even farther.

225
00:12:14.461 --> 00:12:17.940
They're getting an extra oily rag in their back pocket.
They are fucking in.

226
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.110
They have bought into the lane Kiffin era,
whatever his fucking name.

227
00:12:22.111 --> 00:12:24.580
I'm probably saying it wrong.
I don't give a shit.
Um,

228
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.830
I should probably look it up.
Uh,
lane Kiffin right.
And then out of nowhere

229
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:35.010
in the middle of the night,
he accepts a fucking job with,
uh,

230
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.140
with USC and he just fucking leave.

231
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.671
And it gets,

232
00:12:40.671 --> 00:12:44.450
that was really embarrassing for everybody in Tennessee because they didn't,

233
00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.950
they,
they don't,
they view their school as a destiny school for a coach.

234
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.300
Like they're being head coach of the volunteers should be your dream job.

235
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.740
We have won enough games,

236
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.550
we have done enough things that we should be able to hold that status.

237
00:12:58.551 --> 00:13:01.460
And he treated them like a stepping stone,
you know,

238
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.330
like some bitchy was banging on the side and then his fucking wife called and he

239
00:13:05.331 --> 00:13:09.890
fucking comes running home.
So basically they can't stand this motherfucker.

240
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.900
And um,
so the way I said I wouldn't get in trouble when I went out there,

241
00:13:14.901 --> 00:13:18.710
cause I would just wear a Tennessee hat,
haven't affected accent,
you know,

242
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.960
and they wouldn't give a shit.
They'd be so drunk.
They would notice.

243
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.810
They wouldn't look and be,
why is this German Irish guy talking like he's on?
He,

244
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.990
ah,
it wouldn't register.
They'd be like,
okay,

245
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.200
<v 5>fucking love this guy,
man.
Look at him</v>

246
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.640
redneck.
He's fucking red head man.
Easy.
And,
but he's in a deeper than we are.

247
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:41.800
<v 1>Um,
but lane is going to go back and he can't do that shit.</v>

248
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:46.390
He's got to come back.
Where in Alabama he's got to where Alabama fucking colors,

249
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.320
you know that team named after the detergent.

250
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:54.690
I thought that they,
you know,

251
00:13:54.691 --> 00:13:59.040
something if West Virginia had converted on a couple of more plays,

252
00:13:59.041 --> 00:14:01.800
like that fucking game could have gone the other way,

253
00:14:01.801 --> 00:14:04.230
which you can also say about Alabama.
I mean that one poor kid,

254
00:14:04.231 --> 00:14:08.430
he dropped like a 50 yard bomb.
It was right in his hands.
Um,

255
00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.380
so I know you can say that,
but uh,

256
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.430
it was way closer than the way that they showed the highlights.
But um,
anyways,

257
00:14:14.431 --> 00:14:15.840
I'm really excited,
uh,
that,

258
00:14:15.841 --> 00:14:19.580
that college football is back and uh,

259
00:14:19.581 --> 00:14:22.860
I'm psyched to watch SCC football.
I fucking love it.

260
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:28.430
It is the vest and I'm also excited to see other conferences to try to dethrone

261
00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:33.570
them.
Okay,
so that's what happens on Saturday.
On Saturday,
right.

262
00:14:33.571 --> 00:14:37.260
And then on Sunday you got,
you got pro football,
pro football.

263
00:14:37.261 --> 00:14:41.010
This is such a great time of year.
And then you also got baseball.

264
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.660
The Games are starting to matter.

265
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.410
Like I'm actually starting to pay attention to my,
my fucking,
my deep,

266
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:47.790
my Detroit Tigers,

267
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.450
old Billy bandwagon is the Detroit Tigers Fan.
Why?

268
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.540
Why you ask?
Because I got,

269
00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:00.550
I bought in half on red sox season tickets this year and I lost my fucking

270
00:15:00.551 --> 00:15:03.700
shirt.
I know I live out here,
but it's the fucking red sox.

271
00:15:03.701 --> 00:15:06.610
They just won the world series and I'm thinking,
all right,
whatever.

272
00:15:06.611 --> 00:15:10.690
I don't fucking go to,
I can throw them up on stub hub.
All right.

273
00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.570
And someone will buy em and I'll,
I'll at least break even.

274
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.970
But when your team just never gets,
they never got going this whole year.

275
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.770
I don't give a shit out bad.

276
00:15:20.771 --> 00:15:23.830
Your team is at some point they put together a little bit of a streak,

277
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.360
gives the fan base a little bit of hope.
It never fucking happened.

278
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:33.690
And um
oh shit.

279
00:15:33.691 --> 00:15:38.350
This is Andrew talking about the fucking podcast.
All right,
no worries.

280
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.131
I'm sorry.

281
00:15:39.131 --> 00:15:43.120
I just got a text anyways and they never got going and I've just lost my fucking

282
00:15:43.121 --> 00:15:47.110
shirt.
So last game of the year I have tickets,

283
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.680
it's going to be Derek Jeters last time at Fenway Park.

284
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:55.770
Now I could sell those two tickets and make some of my money back or I could go

285
00:15:56.291 --> 00:16:01.291
back and pay my fucking respects to one of the best baseball players I ever saw,

286
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.780
both on and off field the whole way conducted ambassador the fucking game.

287
00:16:04.781 --> 00:16:07.780
So you know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to fly back to the game now.

288
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.780
If the Yankees don't make the playoffs,

289
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.350
that is his last game he ever fucking place.

290
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.790
However,
if the Tigers shit the bed,

291
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.110
I think that they got a four and a half game lead cause I got one game,

292
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.070
one game at hand or they play one last game.
I should say one game in hand,

293
00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:30.370
I guess as a gay man,
hand his hockey,
but whatever.
Um,

294
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.610
if they shit the bed than the Yankees,
they get in and then it Kinda,

295
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:38.980
it's not as big a moment.
So I'm not being in a Yankee hater here.
I just,

296
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.400
I'm being a selfish fan where I want to go to his last game,

297
00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:46.510
ever see his last at bat,
um,

298
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.100
match.
That's some,
that's some legendary shit right there,
you know?

299
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.340
And I always show Ted Williams last at bat at Fenway or whatever.
So this is,

300
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:58.900
this is probably the biggest last at bat in Fenway.
I'm trying to think of a,

301
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.740
come on.
Why don't you guys who plays in the baseball fantasy leagues?

302
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.700
When are you stat guys?
Who's the other than Ted Williams,

303
00:17:06.701 --> 00:17:10.420
who had the most famous lasted bat.

304
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.170
<v 3>Okay,</v>

305
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.230
<v 1>I got me an obviously you'd guess a of big time red sox.</v>

306
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:18.080
I'd say the next biggest red sock after him would be a,

307
00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.070
<v 3>okay,</v>

308
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:20.940
<v 1>Carl Yastrzemski,</v>

309
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.960
unless you want to count Babe Ruth's last fucking at bet before we sold them to

310
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.620
the fucking Yankees.
Oops.
Um,

311
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:36.690
he's Kinda fat,
you know,
I dunno,
you know,
he's drinking all the time.
Look,

312
00:17:36.691 --> 00:17:40.050
we want our three,
whatever.
He's going to go down to the fucking shit hole.

313
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.970
Go down there.
He fucking dig to the Yankees.
They share a stadium.

314
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.970
Dude,
you realize that you,
before babe Ruth came there,
the Yankees,
like the jets,

315
00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.500
you know where the jets played at giant stadium.

316
00:17:54.501 --> 00:17:57.830
The Yankees played at the Polo grounds,
which was the giant stadium.

317
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.960
And then Babe Ruth comes down there.
All right.
And in next thing,

318
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.180
that's why they call it the House that Ruth built is far as I know.

319
00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.540
As far as the drunk people that I've been talking to in sports bar,

320
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.130
I bought sports bars.
I think that that's how the,
that's how the story goes.
Um,

321
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.720
so anyways,
there you go.
There's you,

322
00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:22.070
there's your fucking sports talk for the week.
All right,
now let's get to,
uh,

323
00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:27.700
let's get the paint for the downstairs here.
A dollar shave club.
Everybody,
uh,

324
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:32.830
nothing feels better than that first shave with a fresh blade,

325
00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.730
right?
Nobody can argue that it's smooth.
It's close in.

326
00:18:36.731 --> 00:18:41.350
The blade is as sharp as it's ever going to be.
It's absolutely fantastic.

327
00:18:41.351 --> 00:18:45.460
But thanks to big companies,
big shaving company's ridiculous prices.

328
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.720
You can't really afford to be blowing all your cash every week on fresh new

329
00:18:49.721 --> 00:18:51.340
blades canyon.
So what do you do?

330
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.080
You try to economize and you drag that Dell last blade across your face for two

331
00:18:56.081 --> 00:18:59.770
weeks,
three weeks,
10 weeks.
You know,

332
00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.130
digging up your face.
Why are you doing that to yourself?

333
00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.490
Maybe because the only thing more painful than shaving with an old blade is

334
00:19:06.491 --> 00:19:08.800
shelling out 30 bucks for a pack and new ones.

335
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.440
If you want to enjoy a fresh blade every week,

336
00:19:11.441 --> 00:19:14.590
but you don't want to get a take out a second mortgage on your house,

337
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.060
you got to join dollar shave club.com for just a couple of bucks a month.

340
00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.180
So every week you can pop in a fresh blade and treat yourself to an amazing

341
00:19:31.181 --> 00:19:35.260
shave.
That awful feeling a dragon,
that old razor.
It's,
it's out the window.

342
00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.780
It's incredible.
This should have happened years ago.

343
00:19:37.781 --> 00:19:42.070

351
00:20:06.671 --> 00:20:10.300
I was just a youngster.
I used to do that exact thing.

352
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:14.260
I would make a pack of blades laugh last for like a year and a half

353
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.130
fucking neck.
All broken out.

Um,
all right,
let's talk more about,

375
00:21:36.611 --> 00:21:40.450
so this weekend I had such a great time.
I did the,
uh,
the odd ball tour.

376
00:21:40.451 --> 00:21:45.340
Remember that the odd ball slash pay for Billy's basement here.
Um,

377
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:50.770
it was just a great time,
man.
Anytime,
uh,
you know,
I don't get to see those guys.

378
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.760
Everybody that I toured with and uh,
you know,
we went out,
we had drinks,

379
00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:59.350
I don't even remember where the fuck we were.
There was somewhere in Michigan.

380
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.890
They booked us at these amp he theaters,
so like,
you know,

381
00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.480
the gigantic,

382
00:22:05.481 --> 00:22:09.260
so they need gigantic parking lot so that they're not really in major cities.

383
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:11.360
So,
um,

384
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.380
I landed in Detroit and uh,

385
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.220
I fucking love that city man.
I really love that.
See,
I swear to God,

386
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.043
I swear to God,

387
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:23.680
<v 0>okay,</v>

388
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.660
<v 1>I want to find a couple of investors and I just want to buy a block.
You know,</v>

389
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:34.240
just buy a block of it.
You redo it.
You just make it some late night shit.

390
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:39.460
Couple of clubs.
Not now,
but you need a grocery store to make people move in.

391
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

392
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.350
<v 1>That's what I,
that's why I,
for years when I looked at Cleveland and I looked at,</v>

393
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:48.820
uh,
Detroit,
buffalo is not as bad,
but even like buffalo,
you just look,

394
00:22:48.821 --> 00:22:51.160
it's like all it's going to take it,
just do these fucking buildings.

395
00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:53.840
They're beautiful.
I Dunno.

396
00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.120
But every time I get there it gets a little bit better.

397
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.160
So every time I go to Detroit's a little bit better,

398
00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:01.820
Cleveland's like fucking does all kinds of building going on there,
man.

399
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.390
I like all of those.
I like all of those,
um,

400
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.390
cities a lot.
Like I don't know what it is.

401
00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.930
I don't know if because my family's from the Midwest and we drove out there a

402
00:23:11.931 --> 00:23:16.780
few times,
but there's something about the Midwest.
I really like it.
And um,

403
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.680
so anyways,
we performed down there,
um,
wherever the fuck we were at.

404
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.970
I don't even know.
I can't,
I can't,
I can't tell you the name of one venue.

405
00:23:26.971 --> 00:23:31.710
They were all like the,
you know,
named after some cell phone company.
Um,

406
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:36.210
but the,
the crowds were just amazing.
Absolutely amazing the whole weekend.

407
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.600
And I really got to see a,
you know,

408
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.480
just working with,
you know,
some of the best comics in the country,

409
00:23:44.481 --> 00:23:45.690
some of the best up coming guys.

410
00:23:45.691 --> 00:23:50.220
Some of those ones that are going to be the guys,
you know.
Um,

411
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:54.150
we all went out drinking.
Dude,
I fucking went out drinking and Detroit.

412
00:23:54.151 --> 00:23:55.650
Well that's where we stayed at the MGM,

413
00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.270
now it's coming back to me and I was riding back in the van

414
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.100
with Naper gutsy and he got wind of like saying,

415
00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:11.850
hearing that I said on my podcast that Golf wasn't a sport and do the whole way

416
00:24:11.851 --> 00:24:16.350
back into the bar through the second round of drinks.

417
00:24:16.351 --> 00:24:21.351
We argued about whether or not it was a sport or not.

418
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:26.430
And he,
he brought up Nascar.
He said,
those guys are athletes.
I'm like,

419
00:24:26.431 --> 00:24:30.660
dude,
I'm not saying that somebody who drives a NASCAR,

420
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:34.530
a NASCAR vehicle is not an athlete,

421
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.150
but you don't have to be,

422
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.880
you don't have to be a fuck any sport.
Like I said,

423
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:45.490
any sport where you can throw like a girl,
then it's not a fucking,

424
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.390
it's just,
you know,

425
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.630
if you don't have hand icore and somebody throws you a ball and you fucking

426
00:24:49.631 --> 00:24:52.870
tense up and it bounces off you like they just throw it against the wall.

427
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.800
I know guys like that and that there's still good drivers.

428
00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:01.120
I'm not saying that they're NASCAR level,
but to me,
okay.

429
00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:04.150
As much as it's an insult,
I'm going to get myself in trouble again here.

430
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.330
As much as it's an insult to golf,
a lot of people would say that.

431
00:25:07.331 --> 00:25:08.620
I say it's not a sport.

432
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:12.460
I think it's an insult to Nascar to just say it's a sport

433
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:18.420
cause like the NASA level shit that is going on in pit row.

434
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.910
That's the funniest thing about going to a race

435
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:22.460
<v 3>okay.</v>

436
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.550
<v 1>Is if you're,
if you're in the stance right across from pit row,</v>

437
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.360
the level of intellect that's across the track,

438
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.440
trying to figure out basically how to make these rockets that don't leave the

439
00:25:34.441 --> 00:25:39.441
ground go like fucking 10th of a mile faster than somebody else.

440
00:25:39.661 --> 00:25:40.190
And you're talking,

441
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:43.590
they're going like 100 8,200 miles an hour or whatever the fuck they do now with

442
00:25:43.591 --> 00:25:47.040
the restrictive plates.
And if you go right across the track,

443
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.680
it's guys like me lag.

444
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.850
There was a cooler eaten Bologna fucking sandwiches.

445
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.640
I Dunno.
I,
I think I actually,
I'm not,
I'm not shitting on Nascar.

446
00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:03.750
G I think it's a fucking insult to say that it's a sport.

447
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:05.680
<v 3>Okay.</v>

448
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:10.030
<v 1>Um,
I,
I don't think so.
All right.
And also the fact</v>

449
00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:16.570
of where it came from that it basically came out of like bootlegging during

450
00:26:16.571 --> 00:26:19.540
prohibition and having like a stock car.

451
00:26:19.541 --> 00:26:23.050
You look at a car and you think it's just stock from the factory,

452
00:26:23.051 --> 00:26:26.230
but he got under the hood,
you know,
I love that shit.

453
00:26:26.231 --> 00:26:29.590
That's why I was talking last week.
I love that Mercedes Benz station wagon,

454
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:34.030
but it comes to the AMG factory.
So and go,
you know,
whatever,

455
00:26:34.031 --> 00:26:36.850
it's zero to 60 in 3.5 seconds.
But people think you're,
you know,

456
00:26:36.851 --> 00:26:41.830
you're going to the grocery store.
I love a fucking sweet.
So,

457
00:26:41.831 --> 00:26:42.664
um,

458
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:47.690
I'm not disrespecting Nascar by saying that it's not a sport,

459
00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.770
I just look at it.
I think that's an insult to,

460
00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.320
to racing to say that it's a sport.

461
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:56.423
<v 2>You know,</v>

462
00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.070
<v 1>cause as great as basketball is,
at the end of the day,</v>

463
00:26:59.071 --> 00:27:01.350
you're putting a ball through a hoop.
All right?

464
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:06.250
Is Great as hockey as you're trying to put a fucking rubber disk into a net and

465
00:27:06.251 --> 00:27:09.570
you can do that with all them.
The four major sports,
what they're doing.

466
00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:10.830
<v 0>Okay.</v>

467
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.050
<v 1>Is,
is an entirely different level.</v>

468
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.990
Like they're changing what's possible

469
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:22.340
in,
in,
in transportation.
Like I don't even know how to say it.

470
00:27:22.341 --> 00:27:25.400
I'm too dumb to say talking to like all the,
like the amount of like physics,

471
00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.590
the technology that is going on,

472
00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.153
<v 2>I dunno,</v>

473
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:35.160
<v 1>I would say it's closer to transformers than it is a sport,</v>

474
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.800
but whatever.
So Nate is just sitting there like
flipping out.

475
00:27:40.801 --> 00:27:45.420
And he and his argument about golf is what everybody says about how fucking hard

476
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:47.430
it is.
And I just keep going like,
dude,

477
00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:49.800
just because it's hard doesn't mean it's a sport.

478
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:55.350
Algebra two and trig was really hard for me.
I didn't think it was a sport.

479
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.400
I also don't think just because there's a fucking ball,

480
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.960
it makes it a sport either.
All right.
So whatever.
I'm going to have Nate,

481
00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:08.130
I'm going to have Nate pour gutsy on my podcast because it was such a fucking

482
00:28:08.131 --> 00:28:11.820
long argument.
And then we got into the whole Nascar thing.

483
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:14.730
I'm going to have him on here and plus you guys should know about him because

484
00:28:14.731 --> 00:28:17.470
he's a fucking phenomenal comedian.
Um,

485
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.270
really one of my favorites that's coming up.
Um,

486
00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:28.060
I worked,
yeah,
just a lot of really funny guys.
Hannibal Burress,

487
00:28:28.061 --> 00:28:30.820
that whole fucking generation of guys,
Michael Che,

488
00:28:30.821 --> 00:28:35.420
all of those guys are fucking hilarious.
And um,

489
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:39.230
the next night we went to Pittsburgh.

490
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.460
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

491
00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.210
<v 1>And uh,
Pittsburgh is one of my favorite cities out there.</v>

492
00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.153
<v 2>MMM.</v>

493
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.340
<v 1>It just sucks down when I go there.
I'm only there for one night.</v>

494
00:28:49.341 --> 00:28:51.890
So I think next next year is I'm putting together my fucking hour.

495
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:57.280
I might do a little three,
four day run.
There is always something,

496
00:28:57.281 --> 00:28:58.280
you know what I've always wanted to do.

497
00:28:58.281 --> 00:29:02.330
They always wanted to take that fucking whatever the hell it is that tram up

498
00:29:02.331 --> 00:29:05.690
that hill that you see.
Every time I go there,
I look out my hotel window.

499
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.060
I'm like,
this is that God damn thing.
I always say I'm going to go up there.

500
00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.350
<v 0>Okay.</v>

501
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.970
<v 1>Was fucking Illuminati houses looking down on the city.
Like we,
we run shit.</v>

502
00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:16.390
Like they have the power switch switch up there and they're going to flip it

503
00:29:16.391 --> 00:29:18.940
whenever they want to have people get out of line and shut everything off.

504
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:20.783
<v 2>MMM.</v>

505
00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:22.870
<v 1>And then the last one we did,</v>

506
00:29:22.871 --> 00:29:27.871
we did outside of a Chicago should another fucking unbelievable city then I

507
00:29:28.211 --> 00:29:33.010
don't never get to spend enough time.
And um,
another great show.

508
00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.900
And on that one we had Amy

509
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:36.543
<v 2>hello.</v>

510
00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:41.430
<v 1>And she fucking crushed,
fucking crushed.
And uh,</v>

511
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:46.320
yeah,
I got to work with Sarah Silverman.
I never get to work with her.

512
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:48.090
<v 2>MMM.</v>

513
00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.290
<v 1>Chris Delea and ever get to work with him.
I just,
it was just fucking awesome.</v>

514
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.730
And you know,
had a fucking going up to Jim Jefferies every night,

515
00:29:56.731 --> 00:30:01.530
which is Jesus Christ,
fucking guys,
one of the best storytellers I've ever heard.

516
00:30:01.531 --> 00:30:02.281
And I'm thinking,
all right,

517
00:30:02.281 --> 00:30:06.240
I'm going to get a night off because there's a buffer between fucking him and
me.

518
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.330
And then fucking Amy Schumer goes out and absolutely destroyed.

519
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.030
But it was a,
it was a great time.
Uh,

520
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.940
the crowds were so well behaved.
That was,
it was fucking awesome.
And then,
uh,

521
00:30:19.941 --> 00:30:22.580
and then the end of the night,
I got to hang out with all these comics.
Uh,

522
00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.430
it's one of the reasons why I like doing comedy festivals cause you get to hang

523
00:30:25.431 --> 00:30:29.090
with the other comments and stuff.
Chris Hardwick,
another guy I worked with,

524
00:30:29.091 --> 00:30:32.180
I'm trying to remember to say everybody.
Oh,
and what's his face?
Uh,

525
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:36.860
Steven Brody Stevens is the funniest fucking host ever.
He says so much shit.

526
00:30:36.861 --> 00:30:41.540
The crowd doesn't even get in the comics in the back of fucking diet.
He said,

527
00:30:41.541 --> 00:30:44.000
what the fuck did he say?
He was going,
I can't,

528
00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.700
I'm going to do a bad impression of him.
And He's got ladies and gentlemen,

529
00:30:46.701 --> 00:30:51.530
the level of comedian you are going to see tonight,
these Comedians,

530
00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.440
I've been on television,
they'd been blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
He goes,

531
00:30:54.441 --> 00:30:57.050
these comedians own houses.

532
00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:00.650
I know,
I fucking butchered it,

533
00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:05.180
but the crowd doesn't even get it because they're sitting in the crowd is like,

534
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.230
well,
we own houses.
They don't understand that most comics,

535
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:13.550
it sucks if you stick with,
you don't end up with a house.

536
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.860
<v 2>Okay.</v>

537
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:19.590
<v 1>Oh,
you stay in a one bedroom apartment.
I look at me,
I fucking,</v>

538
00:31:19.591 --> 00:31:21.720
I bought a house when I was 43 years old.

539
00:31:21.721 --> 00:31:25.260
I finally got a house and before then I was,
you know,

540
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.990
<v 2>okay.</v>

541
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.160
<v 1>In a one bedroom apartment,</v>

542
00:31:28.161 --> 00:31:31.400
you just terminally in this one bedroom apartment waiting for this big break.

543
00:31:31.401 --> 00:31:36.170
So it was a really inside fucking joke and it,
uh,
I butchered it.
Whatever.
I,
um,

544
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.460
like we got a great picture that,
uh,
I dunno who the fuck took it.

545
00:31:40.461 --> 00:31:43.070
I can't even remember.
I was drinking so much this weekend,
but uh,

546
00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.493
<v 2>mmm.</v>

547
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.930
<v 1>Steven Brody Stevens used to play a AAA baseball or something,</v>

548
00:31:49.931 --> 00:31:51.430
a college level baseball.
And you know,

549
00:31:51.431 --> 00:31:55.120
that warm up thing that they do when they walk across the field and they're

550
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.640
kicking their foot up into the air and they're trying to touch their hands.

551
00:31:57.641 --> 00:32:01.360
It's above his head.
He brought up crystal Leah,
and when he was walking offstage,

552
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.313
he was doing that.

553
00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:03.820
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

554
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.450
<v 1>And I never addressed it.
Never looked at the crowd.
Somebody took a picture.</v>

555
00:32:07.451 --> 00:32:10.570
It's one of the coolest fucking pictures I've seen.
I'll,
I'll retweet it on the,

556
00:32:10.571 --> 00:32:14.650
uh,
the [inaudible] podcast at the m and podcasts Twitter thing.
But,
um,

557
00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.650
but whatever,
man,
it was a,
it was a great,
great time.
And I'm

558
00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:19.930
<v 2>okay.</v>

559
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:23.600
<v 1>You know,
I don't like where my fucking act is.
Uh,
currently.</v>

560
00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.790
And evidently a few people in the crowd didn't either.

561
00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:35.370
Uh,
we can grow it back in the van last night.
It was fucking hilarious.

562
00:32:35.371 --> 00:32:36.210
And we just,
we,

563
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:40.020
all we were doing was reading the tweets from people that didn't us in the van

564
00:32:40.021 --> 00:32:41.850
ride back was one of the funniest van rides.

565
00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:47.340
I had somebody write a bill burr is killing dot,
dot,
dot.

566
00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.580
My Buzz.
Uh,
and then it said,

567
00:32:50.581 --> 00:32:53.640
please get off the stage Hashtag bull

568
00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:00.710
and another guy,
right?
Uh,

569
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:02.950
he tried to claim that I,

570
00:33:02.951 --> 00:33:07.951
I told the crowd to go out and murder people if fucking I laughed so hard when I

571
00:33:10.111 --> 00:33:14.730
read that.
It's just like,
what is so funny about doing standup is,

572
00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:19.020
or just public speaking in general is the second you get done saying it,
it's,

573
00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:22.140
it's not yours anymore.
It goes into people's heads.

574
00:33:22.141 --> 00:33:26.220
I've know I've said this before,
but however they here it is how they hear it,

575
00:33:26.221 --> 00:33:31.080
and then they write back to you with supreme confidence that they totally

576
00:33:31.081 --> 00:33:32.610
understood your intentions.

577
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.260
This guy said that I was on stage and I told the crowd that go out and go murder

578
00:33:37.261 --> 00:33:41.760
people.
I didn't say that.
That completely wasn't my point.

579
00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.700
Um,
but I've learned to not,

580
00:33:44.701 --> 00:33:48.810
I've tried to anyways learn to not give a shit and just be like,
all right,

581
00:33:48.811 --> 00:33:53.370
well that just has to do with maybe somebody yelled right as I said that

582
00:33:53.371 --> 00:33:57.240
sentence and he didn't hear it.
Or maybe it's his childhood.
I don't know what,

583
00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:01.410
but he wrote like,
you know,
cause I was retweeting people said Nice things like,

584
00:34:01.411 --> 00:34:04.500
hey,
you really made me laugh.
I retweeted that and he wrote to me like,
you know,

585
00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:08.730
hey bill,
retweet this.
Maybe like,
you know,

586
00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:12.570
hands on the hips,
you know,
with the fifth st and then like Superman,

587
00:34:12.571 --> 00:34:16.710
like so fucking confident.
I actually had to think for half a second to be like,

588
00:34:16.711 --> 00:34:20.520
what fucking joke that I tell that he thought that that's what I was saying.

589
00:34:20.521 --> 00:34:24.240
I was like,
Oh,
I know what joke it is.
Yeah.
It's like,
dude,
I want,

590
00:34:24.241 --> 00:34:28.080
and I wanted to write back to them like,
you know,
or you could

591
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:29.390
<v 3>okay,</v>

592
00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:31.970
<v 1>you know,
pay a little closer attention to the meeting of the joke,</v>

593
00:34:31.971 --> 00:34:36.320
but maybe he was paying attention.
That's just how we heard it.
But you know what,

594
00:34:36.321 --> 00:34:40.370
that's not my fault.
It's not my fault that you,
that that's what you heard.

595
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.120
I find that a little bizarre that that's what you thought.
Um,

596
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:47.640
I hope that whoever wrote that isn't one of those,
uh,

597
00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:51.960
one of those list people and all those people that are just kind of like,

598
00:34:51.961 --> 00:34:54.690
they got their little list like,
okay,
these,
these are good words.

599
00:34:54.691 --> 00:34:55.740
These are bad words,

600
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:58.303
<v 3>you know,</v>

601
00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:02.420
<v 1>or not,
not even like bad,
just like there's one context.</v>

602
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:06.800
Like if you say this word,
that means you're a homophobe.
If you say this word,

603
00:35:06.801 --> 00:35:11.480
that means you're sexist.
If you,
if you feel this way on this subject,
a,

604
00:35:11.481 --> 00:35:16.080
you're a Jesus freak,
you're a gun nut.
Uh,
you're,
you're,

605
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.680
you're a baby murderer or whatever the,

606
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.390
wherever they stand on whatever fucking issue,
abortion,
whatever.

607
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:25.280
Like they don't listen to what you're saying.
Um,

608
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:30.040
and it,
what it makes for some really entertaining tweets.

609
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:31.853
<v 3>MMM.</v>

610
00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:37.330
<v 1>I had to save him.
I had to save him one time and just fucking,</v>

611
00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.540
I'd say put out a book,
but why do that?
No one would do one on one would buy it.

612
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.740
Just fucking,
you know,

613
00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.750
save the Goddamn tree with this laptop that probably killed fucking 40,000 trees

614
00:35:46.751 --> 00:35:49.810
and I'll just put them all out there.
I got somewhere in my,

615
00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.300
one of my hard drives,
I have a bunch of hate mail.

616
00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.230
I just kept saving them because they were fucking hilarious.

617
00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.640
And I was also trying to learn to see the humor in them perse back in the day

618
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:03.070
would actually write the people back and then what you learn after a while it's

619
00:36:03.071 --> 00:36:06.910
just like,
ah,
you know,
you actually kind of a wait like validated,

620
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.140
you know,
what they said is wrong,
then just let it go.
You know?

621
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:16.650
It's kind of what I've learned.
Just let it fucking disappear into the abyss.

622
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.560
But I got to tell you,
they're fucking hilarious to read.

623
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:24.720
Hashtag bu um,
anyways,
where are we?

624
00:36:24.721 --> 00:36:27.840
Where are we in the podcast at this point?
36 minutes in.
All right.

625
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:31.900
I'm going to go a little short because it's also my Labor Day,
you know?
Yeah.

626
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.790
It worked so fucking hard.
Don't tell him jokes.
Goddamn fucking,

627
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.460
what the hell is this Labor Day?

628
00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.130
I think I read this every year because I always forget what it is.

629
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:45.400
A Labor Day in the United States,
few people around the world,
um,

630
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.230
is a holiday celebrated on the first Monday in September.
You know,

631
00:36:49.231 --> 00:36:52.230
I realized there's actually somebody who might work in a sweatshop listening to

632
00:36:52.231 --> 00:36:56.940
this going like beside themselves,
you know,
going like,

633
00:36:56.941 --> 00:37:01.500
you actually have the balls to have a labor day after.
What the fuck I do.

634
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.890
You know?
Or maybe they used to work there because if you still work,

635
00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:07.290
they probably wouldn't have a laptop.
You know,

636
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:09.000
they don't allow you to see things.
Do they,

637
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:15.250
have you guys seen that movie about that train that never stops moving with Ed

638
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.210
Harris?
Not Jesus.
Did I just ruin the end of the movie?

639
00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:21.720
I'm going to shut up right now.
I think I just ruined the end of the movie.
Um,

640
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:27.000
Labor Day in the United States.
Everybody has a holiday,

641
00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.970
several celebrated on the first Monday in September.

642
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.760
It is a celebration of the American labor movement and is dedicated to the

643
00:37:35.761 --> 00:37:38.760
social and economic achievements of workers.
Basically,

644
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:42.330
they had slave labor here and we started unions to get out of it.

645
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.520
And then,
uh,

646
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:49.260
the unions for the most part became what they were fighting and then the

647
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:53.970
companies left.
And uh,
now we're all in cubicles.
Uh,

648
00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:57.330
it constitutes a yearly national tribute to the contribution of workers have

649
00:37:57.331 --> 00:38:01.770
made to the strength,
prosperity and the wellbeing of their country.
Uh,

650
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.670
well that's what it is.
Sorry.

651
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:06.900
Labor Day was from promoted by the Central Labor Union and the Knights of Labor

652
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:11.370
who organized the first parade in New York City and the Hay market massacre,

653
00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:16.150
which occurred in Chicago on May 4th,
1886 law.

654
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.270
Oh,
well I got,
we got to look over this one.

655
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.650
This is why you get a decent wage cause I,
these people died.

656
00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:28.910
It's fucking unbelievable protest and how much you make an hour and you actually

657
00:38:28.911 --> 00:38:30.590
take a shovel to the fucking head.

658
00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:35.470
The Haymarket affair also known as the Hay affair,

659
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.440
also known as the Hay market massacre.
This is like,
you know,

660
00:38:39.441 --> 00:38:41.360
whether which side of the shovel you are on,

661
00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.320
if you were the one who killed somebody or was sent the people down to kill the

662
00:38:45.321 --> 00:38:49.260
fucking rabble rousers,
it was called the,
the,
the Haymarket affair.

663
00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.630
And everybody who was there or a new people got killed called it the massacre.

664
00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:54.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

665
00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.710
<v 1>And the cops called it the Haymarket riot.
All right,
here we go.</v>

666
00:38:57.711 --> 00:39:02.150
What's the aftermath of a bombing that took place at a labor demonstration on

667
00:39:02.151 --> 00:39:05.660
Tuesday the fourth,
1886 at Haymarket square in Chicago.

668
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.610
It began as a peaceful rally and support of the workers striking,
uh,

669
00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.790
for an eight hour day and in reaction to the killing of several workers by the

670
00:39:13.791 --> 00:39:17.960
police,
uh,
the previous day.
Oh,
that was the shovel day.
Alright.

671
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:22.790
And unknown and unknown person through a dynamite bomb at the police as they

672
00:39:22.791 --> 00:39:25.760
acted to disperse that,
that's not the way you get your point.

673
00:39:25.761 --> 00:39:29.750
Heard the bomb blast.
Oh wait,
am I have this backwards?

674
00:39:29.751 --> 00:39:33.600
Maybe the workers called it the affair.
Oh,
that f Dota was alive.

675
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.910
We had a little affair,
you know,
you know,
I was doing,

676
00:39:37.911 --> 00:39:41.450
I was one fucking Steptoe one stick,

677
00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:47.550
whatever dude,
they should be on our side.
So then I would say that the,

678
00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:52.230
the cops called it the massacre and also see that this is the great thing about

679
00:39:52.231 --> 00:39:55.920
me is I don't read and I just form a fucking opinion and then I weighed into the

680
00:39:55.921 --> 00:39:59.920
swamp.
I don't think it's that deep harden hall.
Um,

681
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:05.850
the bomb blast in the ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of seven police

682
00:40:05.851 --> 00:40:09.980
officers in,
at least for civilian scores of others were wounded.
Yeah.

683
00:40:09.981 --> 00:40:13.740
That's not a good time to get wounded either in 1886.
Jesus Christ.

684
00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:15.480
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

685
00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.250
<v 1>Um,
so anyways,
yeah.</v>

686
00:40:17.251 --> 00:40:21.480
So who knows that and now it's just this day that we sit around and we take a

687
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:26.340
day off and you listen to some fucking moron do a podcast.
Um,
all right.

688
00:40:26.341 --> 00:40:31.080
Anyways,

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.170
mistakes were made the,
besides,

703
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:29.670
it's a double disk of unreleased material recorded at various places over the

704
00:41:29.671 --> 00:41:30.780
last seven years.

705
00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:35.180
It's essentially Joe's version rarities that a band would put out.

706
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.770
Uh,
I think that's cool as hell.
And I'll tell you right now,
I,
for one,

707
00:41:39.771 --> 00:41:44.210
I know what I'm doing tomorrow,
September 2nd,
downloading that album.

708
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:49.580
Then congratulating my good buddy Joe to Rosa for a job well done.
All right,

709
00:41:49.581 --> 00:41:52.670
leaked photos.
Billy gatekeeper,

710
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:58.190
the Internet almost exploded Sunday because a massive dump of hacked nude

711
00:41:58.191 --> 00:42:02.930
pictures of celebrities.
Yes,
it is a violation of trust.
Yes,

712
00:42:02.931 --> 00:42:05.150
it would be a moral to post or spread.

713
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:10.330
But my question to you is what if you were the nine to five or even worse night

714
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:14.840
shift guy that doesn't have a lot going on.
No girlfriend,
no future.

715
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:15.890
How was it?

716
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:20.890
How was not looking at them making the world better or preventing it from being

717
00:42:21.411 --> 00:42:26.300
an issue?
So let's break this down.
Millions of us see Jennifer Lawrence nude,

718
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.120
but guy with nine to five dozen.

719
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:30.120
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

720
00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:34.300
<v 1>Does that change anything?
I don't understand your question here.</v>

721
00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:40.260
Millions of people.
All this saying,
I guess I missed on the out in the store.

722
00:42:40.261 --> 00:42:41.820
So I guess they were leaked.

723
00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:45.390
Millions of people saw them and now they're saying out of respect for her,

724
00:42:45.391 --> 00:42:49.020
you don't look at him.
So the guy with the nine to five just hears about it.

725
00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.200
Should he not look at it?

726
00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:52.493
<v 2>MMM.</v>

727
00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:57.290
<v 1>Does it change anything?
Well,
it'd be nice if people respect people's privacy.</v>

728
00:42:57.291 --> 00:42:58.190
I mean that.

729
00:42:58.940 --> 00:42:59.520
<v 3>Okay,</v>

730
00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.280
<v 1>you got to understand that.
All of us by being on the Internet,</v>

731
00:43:02.281 --> 00:43:05.640
you got a tiger by the tail.
And,
um,

732
00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:09.600
I never liked that cloud thing.
I always thought it was,

733
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.920
I didn't like that they had my photos.
Even if they don't leak,

734
00:43:13.921 --> 00:43:15.960
somebody has it and somebody could look at them.

735
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.413
<v 2>You know,</v>

736
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:21.570
<v 1>it's like,
you mean not like I'm taking pictures my dick or something.
I mean,</v>

737
00:43:21.571 --> 00:43:25.710
I don't know why I would do that.
That's fucking weird.
Um,

738
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:28.360
but it's just,
you know,

739
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:32.650
family photos and just private photos of where I am and what I'm doing.

740
00:43:32.651 --> 00:43:35.690
Like all of that type of stuff.
Yeah,
I think that's really weird.
And um,

741
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.500
I dunno,
I don't like any of this shit.
I don't like doing any of,

742
00:43:40.501 --> 00:43:44.550
this is why I don't bank online.
Even though I know all my information,
my,
all my,

743
00:43:44.551 --> 00:43:48.190
if my information is online,
just in case they want to bank online,

744
00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:51.120
which is fucking hilarious to me.
I don't think that that should be legal.

745
00:43:51.121 --> 00:43:55.320
I think they should have had to clear that with me because anything that is

746
00:43:55.321 --> 00:43:59.070
online is compromised.
There is no such thing as a secure site.

747
00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.940
All there is is more secure.
So,
um,

748
00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:05.350
<v 3>okay.</v>

749
00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:09.520
<v 1>I Dunno,
I would like to think that you wouldn't do it.
I'm not going to do it.</v>

750
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:11.230
She's mortified.
She,

751
00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:15.940
this plenty of naked women out there on the Internet that are doing it and

752
00:44:15.941 --> 00:44:17.860
making money off of it and want to do it.

753
00:44:17.861 --> 00:44:19.780
Just respect your privacy and don't do it.

754
00:44:19.781 --> 00:44:22.720
You wouldn't want somebody doing that to you.
Um,

755
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:23.570
<v 3>okay.</v>

756
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.150
<v 1>Not that anybody give a fuck senior naked,
but whatever that,</v>

757
00:44:26.151 --> 00:44:29.920
that version of it is,
you wouldn't want somebody to hack into your bank account,

758
00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:33.930
take all your money in that of Shit,
you know?
Um,
I feel bad for,

759
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.650
I uh,
you know,
but I mean,

760
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:42.090
hopefully everybody stops using the cloud.
I think I actually,
inadvertently,

761
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:43.830
I'm using,
I'm on the cloud now.

762
00:44:43.831 --> 00:44:48.180
I see that little icon and I don't ever remember signing up for it.
Granted,

763
00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:52.950
I suck at these things,
but,
uh,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

764
00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:59.130
It's,
it's very strange and I just think the further we go into the future,

765
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.300
the less and less privacy's there's going to be an rather than people thinking

766
00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:06.900
about it in a rational way and a human way.

767
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.680
It's just going to be a bunch of screaming and yelling.
Um,

768
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:15.070
which kind of seems to be what all debate is now.
It's screaming and yelling.

769
00:45:15.071 --> 00:45:18.760
It's not listening to an a another person's point of view.

770
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:23.830
Having an ability to be swayed,
trying to hear where they're coming from.

771
00:45:23.831 --> 00:45:26.170
It's all about just getting out your point of view,

772
00:45:26.171 --> 00:45:28.600
talking over somebody and hyping you're fucking way,
you know,

773
00:45:28.601 --> 00:45:33.040
it's splitscreen shit where you know they're going to debate something and then

774
00:45:33.041 --> 00:45:36.970
the two people just start yelling at each other and whoever yelled louder I

775
00:45:36.971 --> 00:45:41.590
guess wins.
I Dunno.
It's kind of like those fucking Google glasses.

776
00:45:41.591 --> 00:45:43.570
Like if those things ever take off

777
00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:50.070
the fact that someone can then walk around and just be randomly filming people

778
00:45:50.531 --> 00:45:52.900
and Converse.
Like all privacy is gone.

779
00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.750
And I know even though you're out in public,
but you know,

780
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:59.180
you know at your,
you're,

781
00:45:59.181 --> 00:46:03.530
you should just be interacting with who you're interacting with,
you know,

782
00:46:03.531 --> 00:46:06.830
right then and there like to then take it to annoy you were in public.

783
00:46:06.831 --> 00:46:11.710
So now when I share it with the world,
that's,
I dunno,
I,

784
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:15.910
I am not looking forward to that aspect of uh,

785
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:21.800
of the future.
You know what I mean?
I did that.
That,

786
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:26.740
that shit to me is all fucking creepy.
All right,
so here we go.
Next one.

787
00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:31.750
Dollar bills.
Dear dollar bills.
What's your favorite form of currency?

788
00:46:31.751 --> 00:46:36.700
I'm a huge fan of 20s.
What bill best represents you?
Ah,
man,

789
00:46:36.701 --> 00:46:40.240
dude,
I like the hundred dollar bill.
Not a dollar bills.

790
00:46:40.241 --> 00:46:43.300
The fucking nothing by and you see all Ben's fucking face.

791
00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:48.070
You got a couple of those in your wallet.
That's my favorite.
I liked that.

792
00:46:48.071 --> 00:46:51.130
And I like the five.
I like the five bucks.

793
00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:52.650
<v 0>Okay.</v>

794
00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:54.480
<v 1>I like Lincoln.
I just liked the way it looks.</v>

795
00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:58.860
I've always liked the Lincoln memorial.
Um,
the 50s weird.

796
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.860
I really like a a,

797
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:08.170
I liked the a hundred dollar bill and I'm fascinated with the $500 bill and the

798
00:47:08.171 --> 00:47:12.250
thousand dollar bill.
Like where can you get those?

799
00:47:12.251 --> 00:47:15.820
Can I go down to the bank and withdraw 1000 bucks and say,
yeah,
can I get that?

800
00:47:15.821 --> 00:47:19.150
And I just get $1,000 bill.
That's what I want.

801
00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:23.230
I'm sorry sir.
We don't have any,
well that's how I want it.

802
00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:25.120
<v 0>Okay,</v>

803
00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.870
<v 1>but then what happens?
Do they have to go get it?
You know,
like you,</v>

804
00:47:29.871 --> 00:47:31.940
you like this.
Well this is like,
it's a special order,

805
00:47:31.941 --> 00:47:34.850
a car and I got to wait three months for the factory to build it.

806
00:47:34.851 --> 00:47:38.540
Like how does that work?
Who uses thousand dollar bills?

807
00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:39.860
<v 3>Okay,</v>

808
00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:44.360
<v 1>that's gotta be done.
Like when we're doing some dirty deal arms for hostages,</v>

809
00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.980
you know,
you've got that fucking briefcase.

810
00:47:45.981 --> 00:47:49.370
There has to be a bunch of thousand dollar bills in there.
You know what I mean?

811
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:54.350
I Dunno,
but I would say I like the hundred.
You have a hundred dollar bill,

812
00:47:54.351 --> 00:47:59.000
you feel it.
You just,
you just,
you just become more generous than I got it.

813
00:47:59.001 --> 00:48:03.110
I got it.
You fucking take it out.
You Slam it down on a table.
$20 bill.

814
00:48:03.111 --> 00:48:07.010
You play it a little closer to the chest.
You know,
I only got 20 of these things.

815
00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.233
I got a hundred

816
00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:09.490
<v 3>okay.</v>

817
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:13.660
<v 1>Oh,
once a pathetic skates.
All right.
Comedy tour.
Billy.</v>

818
00:48:13.661 --> 00:48:18.550
The king looks like a,
you're having fun on the odd ball tour.

819
00:48:18.551 --> 00:48:20.440
I had a great time.
Could not,
I had a better time.

820
00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:24.130
Please tell us a funny story or a joke from the tour.
I think I already did that.

821
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:29.340
We saw you wheeling Sarah in the Chris Delea picture on Twitter.

822
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:34.420
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I'll,
I'll retweet that one on the,
uh,
the m podcast too.

823
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.150
I don't even know how that happened.

824
00:48:37.151 --> 00:48:39.610
She was just sick of walking through that giant airport,

825
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.270
so she was trying to like,
you know,
she's making us laugh.

826
00:48:43.271 --> 00:48:46.150
She was trying to almost like treat it like how you'd lay down on a skateboard.

827
00:48:46.151 --> 00:48:50.110
She had this giant bag that she was a checked bag,

828
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.520
so she started going on it.
Then she was slowing down.
I just sort of grabbed it,

829
00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.140
started walking with it.
She was like,

830
00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:58.450
this is the fucking greatest way to go through an airport.

831
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.010
She loved it and then Chris Delea took a picture of us and even though we were

832
00:49:03.011 --> 00:49:05.260
having a lot of fun,
what's funny about the picture,

833
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:11.160
we will laugh and was it looks like we were a couple that just got a rain for

834
00:49:11.321 --> 00:49:15.430
something shady and now we're walking out of court and we're just trying to get

835
00:49:15.431 --> 00:49:19.410
past the press.
Like you know that face people have what they,

836
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:22.930
when after they get a rain for severe haven't been acquitted.
They haven't been,

837
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.060
they haven't been convicted.
They just got a rain.

838
00:49:25.061 --> 00:49:29.470
Like this is what we are accusing you of and this is the time you are facing

839
00:49:29.471 --> 00:49:32.010
that fucking look.
Um,

840
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.260
I could never have that look on my face and he caught me between emotions.

841
00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:38.800
I think my train of thought was like,
am I going to be in this picture?

842
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:39.910
I don't think I'm in this picture.

843
00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.900
Hey,
go.
Is that funny enough?
I Dunno.
Made me laugh.
He said,

844
00:49:46.901 --> 00:49:51.901
if you are going to put together a comedy tour of only deceased comics and you

845
00:49:51.941 --> 00:49:54.550
are the host,
who would you pick?
Keep in mind,

846
00:49:54.551 --> 00:49:58.780
you have chaplain up there to lean into the wind or Abbott and Costello.

847
00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:03.200
Costello for some who's on first?
Shit.

848
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:08.090
Legendary bit.
Uh,
they're all dead.
So you're not pissing anyone off.

849
00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:11.300
Um,
all right.
What,

850
00:50:11.301 --> 00:50:14.390
I'm not going to talk about any of my dead friends cause that's too fucking sad.

851
00:50:14.391 --> 00:50:18.980
So I will talk about a Charlie Chaplin to do a standup show.

852
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:21.470
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

853
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:24.980
<v 1>I'd still have them coming out.
I don't know.
I become a huge fan.
He has,
I like,</v>

854
00:50:24.981 --> 00:50:29.380
I never had the patience to sit down and one of his movies and I was in,
uh,

855
00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:33.770
one was in Montreal.
I sat down and I had breakfast by myself,

856
00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:37.880
sat up at the bar and a Jesus bill.
Even at breakfast,
you were at a bar.

857
00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:41.570
Absolutely.
Um,
and they had it on,

858
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:43.430
in the background and because it's silent,
you know,

859
00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:47.360
I didn't have to listen to any dialogue and I was actually able to follow it.

860
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:50.780
And I really got into the whole character of the tramp.

861
00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:51.860
What a piece of shit he was.

862
00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:55.070
And he was always having problems with the cops and running into shady

863
00:50:55.071 --> 00:50:59.090
characters.
He's always going up and down the alleys and stuff.
I,
I just like,

864
00:50:59.091 --> 00:51:01.770
I like this guy,
you know,
so yeah,
I'd have him on the,

865
00:51:01.771 --> 00:51:05.870
I had buster Keaton got,
have WC fields at some point.

866
00:51:05.871 --> 00:51:09.710
My Chicken d him coming out there being all grumpy and shit.

867
00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:14.600
Um,
all the other obvious ones that you've know,

868
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:19.820
prior,
Carlin,
Kennison,
Hicks,
all of those guys.

869
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.230
Um,

870
00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:29.360
yeah,
I guess I,
you know,
I guess the obvious ones.
Red Fox.

871
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:35.830
Yeah.
Oh,
speaking of which,
um,
um,
by the way,
uh,

872
00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:40.900
yeah.
Sucks about Joan Rivers right now.
Man.
She doesn't get a fucking,

873
00:51:40.901 --> 00:51:45.250
do you watch,
it's unfortunate if she actually passes away,

874
00:51:45.251 --> 00:51:48.850
which I hope doesn't happen,
there's no way to not put her top five,

875
00:51:48.851 --> 00:51:52.300
top six all fucking time.
If for some reason,
you know,

876
00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:57.720
she hasn't gotten her credit,
I don't understand why.

877
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:59.400
And for the love of fucking Christ.

878
00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:03.540
I don't want to listen to the fucking woman issue again is plenty of people that

879
00:52:03.541 --> 00:52:04.510
don't get their fucking do.

880
00:52:04.511 --> 00:52:06.480
But I'm sure what's her because it was way back in the day.

881
00:52:06.481 --> 00:52:07.650
I'm sure there was an element of that,

882
00:52:07.651 --> 00:52:11.850
but I'm fucking exhausted what they fucking topic.
Um,

883
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:14.130
but anyways,
yes.
She's like top fucking,

884
00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:15.870
<v 0>yeah.</v>

885
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:19.080
<v 1>Six,
seven all times five.</v>

886
00:52:19.081 --> 00:52:23.580
Like where if you put her in top five all time abso-fucking-lutely absolutely

887
00:52:23.581 --> 00:52:27.720
like it.
I think cause she still like,
she doesn't put out special,

888
00:52:27.721 --> 00:52:30.750
she's just on that fucking fashion channel shitting on people's dresses.

889
00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:35.820
But if you actually put it on and you listen to the jokes that she's doing,

890
00:52:35.821 --> 00:52:38.400
it's just like that.
If fucking unbelievable.

891
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:41.040
Who's telling me a joke?

892
00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:42.340
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

893
00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.830
<v 1>I think Sarah told me this weekend she had a joke.</v>

894
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:49.720
It was a joke about woody Allen.

895
00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:51.730
<v 0>Okay.</v>

896
00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:54.820
<v 1>It was something about somebody,
what I'm going to fuck the whole joke up.</v>

897
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:57.811
It was something about it.

898
00:52:57.811 --> 00:53:00.360
You know where you're going to be take karate and you're a yellow belt.

899
00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:01.700
<v 0>Okay.</v>

900
00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.740
<v 1>And she did some sort of joke about</v>

901
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:10.820
the last time something yellow became came in between woody and whatever that

902
00:53:10.821 --> 00:53:11.654
Mia Farrow,

903
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:16.410
it was a reference to the karate belt and that he's has an Asian wife.

904
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.640
I completely butchered at Jesus Christ.
I didn't even back into that joke.

905
00:53:20.641 --> 00:53:25.640
I just fucking
threw that thing to the chipper.
Um,

906
00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:29.240
but it's just nice,
the type of Shit I can never get away with that fucking joke.

907
00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:35.080
Um,
so anyways,
I dunno.
I I

908
00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.800
I really hope she fucking pulse through man.

909
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

910
00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:44.490
<v 1>It's a fucking legend and a half and a all you guys want to be tough on Twitter</v>

911
00:53:44.491 --> 00:53:48.410
and be like,
whoa.
It was a big dude.
You flow Iti would like,
I get it.
I get it.

912
00:53:48.411 --> 00:53:51.770
You're edgy.
All right.
Back to school.
Hello,
Mr. Barr.

913
00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:53.840
I'm bout to start,

914
00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:58.190
start my sophomore year of high school soon and I want to know if you can give

915
00:53:58.191 --> 00:54:02.460
me some advice.
Yeah,
don't do what I did.
Uh,

916
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:06.380
I said my grades were pretty good last year,
so that really isn't a problem,
dude.

917
00:54:06.381 --> 00:54:09.830
That's fucking huge.
Keep your grades up,

918
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:13.730
keep your options wide open.
Unlike mine,

919
00:54:13.731 --> 00:54:18.300
that fucking closed immediately,
uh,
for this upcoming year.
Uh,

920
00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.540
also the,
uh,
so the,

921
00:54:19.541 --> 00:54:22.310
the whatever the grades aren't a problem for this upcoming year,

922
00:54:22.311 --> 00:54:26.870
but the girls at my school are,
I have no problem making friends in both genders,

923
00:54:26.871 --> 00:54:29.210
but I can't really seal the deal with the ladies.

924
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:33.710
I know I am young and probably shouldn't not be worrying about sex yet,

925
00:54:33.711 --> 00:54:37.100
but his horn,
but as a horny teenager,
oh,
Jesus Christ,

926
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:42.700
please send me,
this is a guy.
He said,
I feel the need.
Oh,

927
00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:45.020
he said with women,
but you know,
you never know.
I said,

928
00:54:45.021 --> 00:54:47.630
I feel the need to at least try and get laid.

929
00:54:47.631 --> 00:54:50.480
I can't seem to be taken seriously by girls in my school.

930
00:54:50.481 --> 00:54:54.680
They seem to think I'm just a comedian and not a possible sexual partner.

931
00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:59.790
Any advice on how to get with these girls?
Any advice is appreciated.

932
00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.670
I know you get a lot of advice questions,

933
00:55:01.671 --> 00:55:04.940
so thank you very much for reading this up.
God dammit.
He went respectful.

934
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:07.000
I love you stand your podcast and you fill in blah,

935
00:55:07.001 --> 00:55:10.590
blah blah and heat breaking bad.
Thank you.
I appreciate all that.
Um,

936
00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.740
I didn't get laid in high school,
so I,
you're asking,

937
00:55:12.741 --> 00:55:17.120
you're barking up the wrong fucking tree.
I was,
I was you,
I was you.

938
00:55:17.121 --> 00:55:19.160
I was making my friends laugh,
but I didn't have,

939
00:55:19.161 --> 00:55:23.360
I didn't have women friends either.
So you're,
you're further along than I am.

940
00:55:23.361 --> 00:55:25.970
So I actually meant to ask you,
how did you do that?

941
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:27.380
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

942
00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:31.730
<v 1>I wasn't even like,
oh dude,
it was a fucking barren wasteland.</v>

943
00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:37.350
My,
my,
my childhood was overloaded.
Testosterone,
so overloaded that like,

944
00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.900
I don't even like,
you know,

945
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:44.960
I am just getting like my views and understanding on women it 46,

946
00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:50.430
like I should have been plowing through this at like 19.

947
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:52.343
<v 0>MMM.</v>

948
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:57.490
<v 1>I it just as far as understanding how,
where they're coming from.</v>

949
00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:03.200
So,
uh,
what,
what can,
what advice can I give you?
Um,

950
00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:09.130
um,
um,
stop being friends with,
with women seek bad advice.

951
00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:12.460
Like I wouldn't do that.
Does.
There's that.

952
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:15.500
There's that whole fucking bit Chris Rock did where if you stay friends with

953
00:56:15.501 --> 00:56:18.020
them too long,
they view the value of that way.

954
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:22.910
And then looking at you as a sexual partner becomes gross.

955
00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:28.410
Um,
so what I,
this deal,
I'm not going to go negative.

956
00:56:28.411 --> 00:56:31.980
Stay friends with the women you're friends with.
All right?

957
00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:36.690
But don't become friends with any other ones.
Hit on all the other ones.

958
00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:40.290
All right?
If you're right,
if you're in a really small fucking pawn,

959
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:42.210
go to a fucking party,

960
00:56:42.211 --> 00:56:45.840
the next town over and be the mysterious guy from the other town.

961
00:56:45.841 --> 00:56:48.780
Although if there's football players,
say they might beat the shit out of you.

962
00:56:48.781 --> 00:56:51.480
At least that's what would happen when I was a kid.
So watch out for that shit.

963
00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:54.000
Um,
I dunno.

964
00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:57.270
I would say the upside is that college is only two years away.

965
00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.280
College is only two years away.
And this is the deal.

966
00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:02.370
You're going to be thinking back all the fucking women that you could have

967
00:57:02.371 --> 00:57:07.050
fucking been having fun with.
Uh,
so you just get,
you gotta put it out there,
man.

968
00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:10.630
I think that that's what you're doing.
I think you're being like a,
you,

969
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:13.980
you don't know how to fucking get into that traffic pattern.
You know,

970
00:57:13.981 --> 00:57:18.060
you just sort of circling the fucking,
you're in a holding pattern here,
man.

971
00:57:18.061 --> 00:57:21.960
You gotta you gotta try to come in for a landing and uh,

972
00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:26.250
I would say any girl that you were friends with,
it's fucking over.

973
00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:27.630
<v 0>Okay.</v>

974
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:31.590
<v 1>Don't even try to hook up with them.
Don't wear them out.
All right.</v>

975
00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:36.120
I would actually,
you know what?
I would do a couple of them.
I would talk to them.

976
00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:37.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

977
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:39.860
<v 1>I would talk to them.
He didn't know what,
if you're friends with them,</v>

978
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:43.850
they'll try and hook you up with some other girl who they'll see is like,
well,

979
00:57:43.851 --> 00:57:47.060
you know,
she wants to meet a boy.
That's dare you go.

980
00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.970
That might be the way to get in there.
Hey Nia,

981
00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:53.580
can you help this kid get laid?

982
00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:59.840
This is beyond,
this is beyond my realm.

983
00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:05.190
It's,
it's a,
it's a fucking,
it's,
it gets a kid in high school.

984
00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:09.240
Some kid in high school,
he has no problem making friends.

985
00:58:09.241 --> 00:58:12.480
He's doing well in school.
He has a lot of female friends,

986
00:58:12.481 --> 00:58:14.250
but he can't seem to get past that.

987
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.770
So he's asking me how does he get lays a sophomore in high school.
I was like,

988
00:58:16.771 --> 00:58:20.280
I didn't get sophomore in high school or whatever.
Whole Hook Up,
you know,

989
00:58:20.281 --> 00:58:25.110
get them in the game.
He wants some at bats.
All right,
cute.

990
00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:27.060
He doesn't need to,
he doesn't want to be cute.

991
00:58:27.061 --> 00:58:30.060
This guy wants to be a bad ass man.
He's got marvel man here.

992
00:58:30.061 --> 00:58:34.190
You got to build this dude up.
So,
so he,
he's friends with a lot of women's.

993
00:58:34.191 --> 00:58:37.260
So mummy like a moron.
You know what I said?
It's at first he got to do,

994
00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:41.160
don't be friends with any more women and I immediately heard your voice in my

995
00:58:41.161 --> 00:58:45.300
head going,
you're such a fucking moron.
So I was like,
all right,
scratch that.

996
00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:48.000
So I came up with,

997
00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:49.480
<v 0>okay,</v>

998
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:52.070
<v 1>don't try to hook up with any of the girls you're friends with because they,</v>

999
00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:54.310
they've already stopped looking at you like you're a sexual being.

1000
00:58:54.311 --> 00:58:57.330
It's going to see in grocery.
In the friend zone.
Yeah,
the Chris Rock,

1001
00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:01.570
Chris Rock Classic Chris Rock.
The friend zone.
So I said,

1002
00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:02.670
<v 0>okay.</v>

1003
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:04.650
<v 1>A couple of them that you feel like you can trust,</v>

1004
00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:06.960
just kind of put it out there like,
hey,
you know,

1005
00:59:06.961 --> 00:59:11.940
I go a girls just the plate,
uh,
you back away.

1006
00:59:11.941 --> 00:59:15.180
Like,
Eh,
you know,
girls,
they don't want to hook up with me.
They,
Oh gee,

1007
00:59:15.181 --> 00:59:18.690
they just look at me like I'm just funny.
And then there'll be like,

1008
00:59:18.691 --> 00:59:21.470
what are you talking about?
You have a lot to offer.

1009
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:26.090
And then I think that they'll maybe hook him up with some other girl that they

1010
00:59:26.091 --> 00:59:29.640
know that it's probably maybe saying the same shit.
Yeah.

1011
00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:31.790
But he probably knows all those girls now.

1012
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.950
I feel like he's got to move outside his circle of,
of uh,

1013
00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.930
the girls that he's friends with.
I mean,
if he wants to sort of be like,

1014
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:42.530
do you guys think,
um,
I don't know,
do some sort of like,

1015
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:47.810
I don't know what I buy cool.
And my leg.
Do you think girls want to like date me?

1016
00:59:47.811 --> 00:59:50.120
Because I just feel like,
you know,
can't say,
uh,
my cool.

1017
00:59:50.121 --> 00:59:53.590
Once you say saying my cool,
you're not cool anymore.
Well I suggest to Tara,

1018
00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:55.370
I suggested that he go to another town,

1019
00:59:55.371 --> 00:59:59.060
but I'm worried he's going to run into town.
Yeah,
it'd be the mysterious guy.

1020
00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:03.230
Where are you from?
Ah,
the next town over seven 11 baby.

1021
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.890
There is a girl that he likes.
He said just go up and just start talking to her,

1022
01:00:06.891 --> 01:00:10.310
but just make it clear.
Not by being like,
I want to date you are,

1023
01:00:10.311 --> 01:00:13.520
I want to fuck you because I'm looking to get lit.
Not like that,
but just like,

1024
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:17.840
oh this is bad.
Just,
yeah,
just start like,
you know,
just being funny and,

1025
01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:20.240
and all that kind of stuff and just being cool with her.

1026
01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:24.230
But definitely like you got to put up the flirtatious vibe.
That's what it is.

1027
01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:27.680
It's all about properly flirting,
you know what I mean?

1028
01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:31.910
And not like lingering too long with it and not like,
oh,
can I,
you know,

1029
01:00:31.911 --> 01:00:36.320
just showing up at her locker in between classes already.
They're like,
hey,

1030
01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.370
so going in Algebra,
Huh?
Like not like that lingering sped.

1031
01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:45.050
I learned that the hard way where you linger and I was quiet so I looked like a

1032
01:00:45.051 --> 01:00:50.030
psycho.
Creepy.
Yeah,
definitely.
I could definitely see that being your,

1033
01:00:50.031 --> 01:00:53.660
uh,
your thing.
Oh,
when I was younger,
my thing like I'm a fucking creep.

1034
01:00:53.661 --> 01:00:56.720
I didn't know what to do.
I was all,
I was all Billy freckles.
I,
it wasn't,

1035
01:00:56.730 --> 01:01:00.530
it was a man without a country.
Just flirt with them.
Just be cute with them.

1036
01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:03.860
Give them a compliment.
Don't go too overboard with it.
You know,

1037
01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:05.980
even if it's just something like,
you know,
all right,

1038
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:09.440
I'm going to give you two compliments,
Sally.
You know,
like nice dress,

1039
01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.370
keep moving and keep it.
Hey Sally,
nice dress.

1040
01:01:13.371 --> 01:01:16.910
He's got to give him some better in there.
I'm not really good at this.
Okay.

1041
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:20.270
Cause I feel like it's like a natural thing that you have.
It's all about,

1042
01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.530
you know what it is,
I think,

1043
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.800
I think once you're secure with yourself and you're not feeling those feelings

1044
01:01:27.291 --> 01:01:31.850
of inadequacy,
that's when that's kind of natural swag can happen.

1045
01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.230
You can't manufacture it.

1046
01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:37.220
So that's why me trying to give him like lines to throw out sounds ridiculous

1047
01:01:37.221 --> 01:01:39.470
because they're completely manufactured.
Yeah.

1048
01:01:39.471 --> 01:01:42.350
And also you're a woman so you don't have to like hit on people.

1049
01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.860
You just show up,
look cute.
That's why we've been through this before.

1050
01:01:45.861 --> 01:01:50.780
I'm not getting into it again.
You're cute age.
Your opening line is,

1051
01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:55.490
hey Sally,
nice stress.
No,
that really wasn't terrible.

1052
01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:59.310
But,
but just to give out a compliment and keep it moving,
that's all him.

1053
01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:02.180
Can you come up with a middle ground between a hey Sally,

1054
01:02:02.181 --> 01:02:07.070
nice dress and hey Sally,
nice fucking rack.
Wah.
What I say,

1055
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:12.500
I don't think that I can just make it something like,
you know,

1056
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:16.580
just offhanded you know,
oh that's cool.
Or what's that?

1057
01:02:16.581 --> 01:02:19.640
Or did it or just ask about something about her.
You know,

1058
01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.230
what's that book you're reading?
What?

1059
01:02:21.231 --> 01:02:24.080
I'm trying to put it in context of like a school type of situation.

1060
01:02:24.081 --> 01:02:28.520
So it's not completely out of left field.
Good at starting the car getting in,

1061
01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:31.160
right.
Hey,
what's that book you're reading?
And then,

1062
01:02:31.161 --> 01:02:36.020
and then she's got to be like,
um,
uh,
fucking Harry Potter.

1063
01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:37.760
And then he like,
yeah,

1064
01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:45.110
saw that movie every very cool,
Oh God,

1065
01:02:45.111 --> 01:02:47.470
I'm the worst.
And then you face turns all red.

1066
01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:50.920
Well the thing about it is too is what we're talking about teenagers here.

1067
01:02:50.921 --> 01:02:53.830
So I don't know that this is,
this is fucking creepy.
Yeah.

1068
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:57.670
We're a long ways away from being like and high school.

1069
01:02:57.671 --> 01:03:02.671
So I can't even like go back there mentally to figure out how a boy that age

1070
01:03:03.851 --> 01:03:05.770
would talk to him.
I have no idea cause I can't,

1071
01:03:05.771 --> 01:03:10.670
I can't remember anything previous to insult or a little bit like that.

1072
01:03:10.690 --> 01:03:13.880
That's how I always hit on negging.
Is that what it's called?
Yeah.

1073
01:03:13.881 --> 01:03:15.760
The old tearing them down building.
No,

1074
01:03:15.761 --> 01:03:19.950
not tearing them down but just giving him shit in a funny way.
Yeah.

1075
01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:24.090
Well that's all.
Yeah,
that can be cute for sure.
He is like a playful teasing.

1076
01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:27.600
Yeah.
But it's like you got to know the person well enough to do that.

1077
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:28.291
You know what I mean?

1078
01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:32.250
It's like if it's some girl that he has and hasn't talked to and like three

1079
01:03:32.251 --> 01:03:34.860
years and all of a sudden he's like,
yeah,
we'll get blah,
blah,

1080
01:03:34.861 --> 01:03:39.750
blah and like she's going to be like,
what?
Who is that?
Yeah.
No,
that's the worst.

1081
01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:43.440
I've learned all these lessons.
It was that.
It's going to have to tell you.

1082
01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:48.510
It's less about,
here's my,
here's my final thought on it.
I think it's less about,

1083
01:03:48.511 --> 01:03:53.010
oh,
shut up.
I think it's less about how do I get the girls to like me?

1084
01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:57.990
Yeah,
it did.
Why did you tell him to shut up your face was was saying things?
No,

1085
01:03:57.991 --> 01:04:01.620
because no,
you're like,
well your face was saying to me,
so I told her to shut up.

1086
01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.250
I'm going to,
I'm going to tell you what my,

1087
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:06.990
I was imitating a woman's face when I said something to her one time.

1088
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:11.400
That was the face.
She made it me.
What do you mean?
What did you say?
Uh,

1089
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:16.350
you know,
I was in between relationships.
I just spit it out.
No,

1090
01:04:16.351 --> 01:04:17.220
cause it's embarrassing.

1091
01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:20.970
I was in between relationships and all these comics were just like,
dude,
just,

1092
01:04:20.971 --> 01:04:23.760
you know,
just fucking say it and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1093
01:04:23.761 --> 01:04:27.660
and just stay single and just bang a bunch of broads and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1094
01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:30.420
So I tried to be that guy,
so,

1095
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:33.090
and it was sort of working for me and then I just,

1096
01:04:33.091 --> 01:04:34.830
one night it just completely backfired.

1097
01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:37.890
I was at Dangerfield and this woman came up to me and told me how much she liked

1098
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:39.720
my,
you know,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1099
01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:42.750
I started the small talk and everything and then I tried to be,
you know,

1100
01:04:42.751 --> 01:04:45.720
leather jacket guy said,
hey,
you want to just cut through the bullshit?
I mean,

1101
01:04:45.721 --> 01:04:50.680
I live right up the street from when it come.
She goes,
she just went like,
what?

1102
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:53.900
Huh?
No,
no,
I,
and she slowly backed away and I was like,

1103
01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:01.520
I fucking,
it took me still at BB.
You blew it.

1104
01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:04.550
There was nothing to blow.
It was just fucking,
it wasn't even there.

1105
01:05:04.551 --> 01:05:08.330
There was no situation.
I completely,
I misread the whole thing.

1106
01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.790
I feel like this kid is,
it's got to get his,

1107
01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.570
his confidence and his own personal swag going.
That's all it is.
It's like,

1108
01:05:14.571 --> 01:05:18.130
I feel like it's not about the other people so much about how you feel about

1109
01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:19.900
yourself,
you know?
And I,

1110
01:05:19.901 --> 01:05:23.260
but I feel like that's also like a concept that's kind of hard for people that,

1111

Hey.
How's it going?
And keep moving.

1113
01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:31.240

01:05:31.241 --> 01:05:34.510
You know how you're talking about the best way better than hey,

You know,

1117
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:44.620

<v 3>Okay.</v>

1187
01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:11.790
<v 1>Okay.
Here's a big dilemma for the week.
Everybody dilemma.
Dear Billy,</v>

1188
01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:14.760
the baker's man,
big Fan,
first time writer,

1189
01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.880
oh first time to write dedicated listener for over three years.

1190
01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:19.650
I have an age old dilemma for you.

1191
01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:24.150
I had been engaged for about five months to the perfect woman for me about two

1192
01:10:24.151 --> 01:10:28.620
weeks ago.
She received a text after 10:00 PM from a male coworker.

1193
01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:30.323
<v 6>Oh,</v>

1194
01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:32.690
<v 7>GG.</v>

1195
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.200
<v 1>Like the mature man than I am.</v>

1196
01:10:36.201 --> 01:10:40.670
I passed it off as nothing and kindly reminded her that text after 10:00 PM

1197
01:10:40.671 --> 01:10:45.230
should only be for emergencies or naughty talk between the two of us.
She agreed.

1198
01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.810
I work out of town five days a week.

1199
01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.730
<v 6>Oh,</v>

1200
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:51.780
<v 7>Jj age.</v>

1201
01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:53.610
<v 1>So I'm not there every night.</v>

1202
01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:59.270
A few days ago she texted me that she's going to dinner with the same Galvao Jj.

1203
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:02.610
What the fuck?
The same guy.

1204
01:11:02.611 --> 01:11:06.870
Just the two of them and they're going to the same restaurant as our first day.

1205
01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:09.880
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

1206
01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:14.690
I can't even read the rest of this text is so many flags flapping in my face.

1207
01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:19.250
I hope I'm not right.
She explained that they invited other coworkers,

1208
01:11:19.251 --> 01:11:21.500
but everyone declined or bailed.

1209
01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:28.470
Uh,
okay.
And if you did the same thing,

1210
01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:29.820
she would be cool with that.

1211
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.830
I wouldn't be cool with this man or woman would not be cool with this.

1212
01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:38.910
This is not because I'm trying to see is this like a a female thing and a guy

1213
01:11:38.911 --> 01:11:40.950
doesn't understand.
This is not a cool,
this is not cool.

1214
01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:45.450
I tell her that this does not make me mad,
but I am not happy about it either.

1215
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:50.250
She describes this guy is short single and dates around.
Yeah.

1216
01:11:50.251 --> 01:11:52.470
He's trying to bang her one more time before she gets married.

1217
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:55.440
That's what he's doing.
I'm not saying that's what your fiances doing,

1218
01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:59.570
but that's what he's doing.
The fuck's he going there for conversation.

1219
01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:01.880
The guy dates around.
Um,

1220
01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:05.480
ever since that night and of course my dissatisfaction for the event that

1221
01:12:05.481 --> 01:12:08.840
occurred,
things had been slightly touchy between us.
I trust this girl,

1222
01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.570
but I could never trust a single guy.
I have.

1223
01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.510
I had issues with women and guy friends in the past.

1224
01:12:14.511 --> 01:12:16.450
My parents divorced when I was young duty,

1225
01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:19.580
infidelity and I'd never been 100% trusting of women.

1226
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:24.050
Am I wrong to think that this is inappropriate for an engaged or married woman

1227
01:12:24.051 --> 01:12:26.210
to go out to dinner?
Let's face it,

1228
01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.070
it's a date with a single man or vice versa.
Oh yeah.
APPS,

1229
01:12:31.071 --> 01:12:34.160
a Fuckin lutely apps a Fuckin lutely.

1230
01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:36.200
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1231
01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:39.740
<v 1>And the timing of this too,
where you're engaged and you're going to get married,</v>

1232
01:12:39.741 --> 01:12:40.574
it's like,

1233
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.943
<v 0>okay.</v>

1234
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:45.960
<v 1>Yeah,
I'd be like,
listen,
if you want out,
just say so.</v>

1235
01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:47.720
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1236
01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.700
<v 1>Just rip the bandaid off.
Take my heart,</v>

1237
01:12:49.701 --> 01:12:52.190
throw across the fucking ramen to the garbage disposal right now.

1238
01:12:52.191 --> 01:12:56.630
And let's just fucking get this over with because,
uh,
yeah,
dude,

1239
01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:01.250
that is a,
uh,
that,
that is not,
that is not cool.
That's not a cool situation.

1240
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:03.840
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1241
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:08.080
<v 1>Yeah.
So I agree with you.</v>

1242
01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:11.680
You haven't really asked me anything but I 100% agree with you.
That is not,

1243
01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:17.700
that's not cool.
That's a really shitty position for her to put you in a,

1244
01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:19.640
<v 0>okay.</v>

1245
01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.530
<v 1>And I've been that piece of shit how the guy too,</v>

1246
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:25.250
so I know what his fucking attentions are.
So there you go.

1247
01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.830
There's that.
Um,
I don't know what to tell you.

1248
01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:36.440
That's one of those things where like you got to say,

1249
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:39.110
you can't ever do that again.
But then there's also that thing like,

1250
01:13:39.111 --> 01:13:43.010
I shouldn't have to tell you not to do that.
Um,

1251
01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:47.060
and that's a hell of a fucking tail that they invited all of these other people

1252
01:13:47.061 --> 01:13:50.270
and they all declined.
That sounds like a really bad lie.

1253
01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.593
Um,

1254
01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:54.853
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1255
01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:55.900
<v 1>Yeah.
Jesus Christ.</v>

1256
01:13:55.901 --> 01:13:59.620
What does that expression about a woman's heart about the secrets it holds?

1257
01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:04.050
I shouldn't,
I shouldn't quote this because you'll never trust them.

1258
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:06.583
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1259
01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:11.800
<v 1>Who's getting,
oh,
you can't fucking trust anybody.
Let me look.</v>

1260
01:14:11.801 --> 01:14:15.910
Let me just Google this woman's heart
secrets.

1261
01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.690
Let's see if it comes up.

1262
01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:19.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1263
01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:22.370
<v 1>[inaudible] road.
Uh,</v>

1264
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:26.960
the woman's heart secrets.
No woman's heart program.

1265
01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.240
The woman's heart secret.

1266
01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:34.970
A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets.
There it is.

1267
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.260
Then take too long.
Oh,
Holy Shit.

1268
01:14:40.770 --> 01:14:44.710
Unfucking believable.
That's amazing.
Is that true?
But you,
you know,

1269
01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:48.000
this way never believe in stereotypes because they always say women can never

1270
01:14:48.001 --> 01:14:51.210
shut the fuck up.
They can't keep a secret and they're always gossiping.

1271
01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.620
Maybe they keep their secrets.
Maybe I should shut the fuck up.
And I've said,

1272
01:14:55.621 --> 01:14:57.630
enough dump.
Thanks for the week.
What do you think?
I think so.

1273
01:14:57.810 --> 01:15:02.400
Enjoy the rest of your Labor Day.
All right.
That's the podcast for this week.

1274
01:15:02.401 --> 01:15:05.430
God bless Alia.
Thank you to everybody.
Came out to the,

1275
01:15:05.431 --> 01:15:09.510
I'm the odd ball tour.
Thanks for everybody who tweeted that they liked me.

1276
01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:12.280
Thank you.
Even more than people said they didn't like me.
Uh,

1277
01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:16.530
they were fucking hilarious.
And,
uh,
that's it.
Go fuck yourselves.

1278
01:15:16.531 --> 01:15:17.550
I'll talk to you next week.
