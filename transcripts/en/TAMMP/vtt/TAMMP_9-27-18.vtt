00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.100
See dose those podcasts.

17
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.470
They don't care about you the way I do.
You see,

18
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:00.960
when we give yourself to Jesus,

19
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.620
<v 0>okay.</v>

20
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.890
<v 1>And you understand that we're all brothers and sisters.
I don't look at y'all.</v>

21
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.910
I don't look at yo like just a bunch of listeners,

22
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.070
<v 0>okay?</v>

23
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.170
<v 1>I look at you like my brothers and sisters.
Praise Jesus.</v>

24
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.830
Praise Jesus and give me your fucking money and when it rains and the waters

25
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:27.270
come up,
I ain't letting you in my fucking arena.

26
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.400
Um,
I still love that.
He didn't fucking let anybody in.
Joel Olsteen.

27
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.180
The fucking dude's a gangster,
man.
Fuck you.

28
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:38.070
You ain't get my blue carpet all wet.

29
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:39.813
<v 0>All right.</v>

30
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.740
<v 1>Jesus won't you to get wet.</v>

31
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.460
He wants you to float out into the Gulf and New Mexico.
Um,

32
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.870
my is it door?
Do I can't get that fucking song on in my head though.

33
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.330
I'm never late.
I had doubt.
You mine as a door Jim.

34
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.140
Fucking some fucking something in a fucking something so close.

35
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.060
So close yet.
So far.
Oh,

36
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:09.200
I carried your fucking books to school.
That song is so fucking sad.

37
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.620
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

38
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.180
<v 3>it's a sad song.
You know what I lived at?
I used to do,
you know something?</v>

39
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:20.040
I was on a,
I did an episode,
you know,
I got these big shows coming up.

40
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.040
F is for family.
Third season is coming up.

41
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:27.390
So I'm starting the old um,
promotion tour.

42
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.790
Like right now.
Right now I have 20 minutes between radio phones.

43
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:36.900
So I figured,
Hey,
you know what I mean?
I'm a guy,
I'm a guy who does a podcast.

44
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.860
Right?
It'd be nice to get 20 minutes to this podcast out of the way.

45
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:42.720
That's what I'm doing right now.
As you're sitting there going,
wow,

46
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:45.210
this guy bill checked in on me,
he really cares about me.

47
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.170
I'm actually right now trying to get this out of the way.

48
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.020
<v 0>Okay?</v>

49
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.170
<v 3>Okay.
If you want,
full disclosure,
all you people out there,</v>

50
00:02:53.171 --> 00:02:55.810
all you kids out there in the Internet,
you know,

51
00:02:55.811 --> 00:03:00.220
sniff and fucking glue and fucking trying to make water stand up after

52
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.280
<v 4>you throw him.
Yeah,
I talked about that on Kona.</v>

53
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.030
I just don't understand why everybody finds that so fucking incredible.

54
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.933
<v 0>You know,</v>

55
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.500
<v 4>when you really think of the technology out there,</v>

56
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.940
the fact that you can take your own fucking unmanned helicopter and fly it over

57
00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:20.460
some,
over somebody fucking yard and watch some topless chicks,

58
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.110
Tad and her fucking tits,
right?
You can do while watching that in your,

59
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.270
in your fucking room.
Okay.

60
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.250
Beaten your fucking millennial deck.
You know,
all of us teeth,

61
00:03:34.251 --> 00:03:35.400
you would think somebody,

62
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.020
somebody trough flips a fucking water ball up in the air if it stands up
upright.

63
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.050
Everybody runs out of the room.
Like they just saw a fucking,

64
00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:46.010
which is incredible to me.
You know?
That's what's fascinating.

65
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.650
That's just fascinating about entertainment.
You're never,

66
00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:52.460
you have no idea what's going to be a fucking hit and what isn't.

67
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.550
Right?
Just fuck just sitting there.
You're right in the shit.
You shoot the shit,

68
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.180
you put it out there.
You have no fucking idea.

69
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.990
That's why when something is a hit,
Hollywood's like,
oh my God,

70
00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:07.370
they like vampires.

71
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.340
Fucking make 900 of those until they get sick of it.

72
00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:12.570
Then they move onto the next thing.

73
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.800
Like I'm kinda hoping the Superhero Shit is,

74
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.120
has it finally died down.

75
00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:21.750
I was driving down the street the other day by Dubai dual boob and I saw a

76
00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:25.900
billboard by Bata don't book and it said the world has enough superheroes

77
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.640
and it just said venom.
And I was like,
oh my God.
Finally.

78
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.160
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

79
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.460
<v 4>they're going to make a movie about one of the bad guys.
Right.</v>

80
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.670
And I can guarantee you if this movie venom is a fucking hit,

81
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.020
next thing you know there's going to be a Lex.
It Luther,
is it Lugar?

82
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.920
Is it Luder Lex the bald guy,

83
00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:51.640
like make you know
whose whole fucking thing

84
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.950
is that?
Like,
he just can't,

85
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.010
he can't stand fucking superman and his full head of hair.

86
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.320
Do you know what I was talking to somebody yet just in order.

87
00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:01.700
This is not even a full head of hair.

88
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.880
It said he has the audacity to have that little curly cue right down the front.

89
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.690
Just mocking.
You know?

90
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:14.110
I bet Lex had a nice sense of humor at one point before he got all bitter.

91
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.510
You're not bet lexicon,
baby.
Tell a story.

92
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:19.440
<v 0>Okay,</v>

93
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.760
<v 4>I bet Lex had some fucking attributes that made him special,
you know,</v>

94
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.780
but superman got that jet black hair done.
The

95
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.290
<v 0>okay.</v>

96
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.300
<v 4>It's so black.
He has blue highlights,</v>

97
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.503
<v 0>you know,</v>

98
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.720
<v 4>that is uniform.
Just sets it off,
which brings out his eyes.</v>

99
00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:42.030
What color were his eyes?
That's when you know you're,

100
00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:45.570
you're like to wind to superheros when you know like what color their eyes are.

101
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.870
First Time I opened a comic book and I saw his steel blue eyes,
I was just like,

102
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.340
oh my God,
who is this?
I felt like,

103
00:05:56.341 --> 00:05:59.930
I just want to just in the ocean of ant man's eyes.

104
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.190
What
do you guys think about stem cell research?

105
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.420
I don't understand why this country is okay with one con one company,

106
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.040
you know,
taking over the food supply,
poisoning it,

107
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.200
and then selling the company to another company and everybody just walks away.

108
00:06:23.201 --> 00:06:24.880
Like what they did didn't just happen.

109
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.560
Like there's not fucking eight year olds walking around with full fucking beards

110
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.160
because of all the fucking hormones and shit that they've put in the goddamn

111
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.270
food.
I don't understand why this country is okay with that,

112
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.740
but stem cell research is like,
oh that's the work of the devil.

113
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.450
And then you hear all these fucking stories of people leaving the country.

114
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.130
They go out,
you know,
and they get the stem cell treatment.

115
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.630
<v 0>Yes.</v>

116
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.280
<v 4>And they come back to this country.</v>

117
00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:56.710
It's like I thought this guy was a mouth breather and moron.

118
00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.090
I mean he just explained the theory of relativity to me.
What the fuck happened?

119
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.970
Well he got stem cell research on his mouth.

120
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.500
They shot it right into the gaping hole that he used to have.

121
00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:11.170
When he would stare at you mouth agape,

122
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:14.140
when you would flip a bottle over and it would land on upright,

123
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.870
they shot it right into,
it was like a mist.

124
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.700
It was a stem cell mist and all of a sudden his eyes lit up and his mouth
closed.

125
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.340
And now he's a fucking smart guy.

126
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:25.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

127
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:25.961
<v 4>No,</v>

128
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:30.550
I've heard about guitar players like their hands from years of fucking doing the

129
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:33.670
tap on Solos trying to keep up with Eddie van Halen.
You know,

130
00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:37.330
they fucking get that thing and they come back and they had the hands of a 12

131
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:38.164
year old.

132
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

133
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.630
<v 4>But they,</v>

134
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.630
they keep the experience of being on the road to devastating combination.

135
00:07:44.671 --> 00:07:46.650
You would think something,
you know,
you never,
you,
you know,

136
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.350
it's one of the few times it seems like you're going to have your cake and eat

137
00:07:49.351 --> 00:07:52.620
it.
I mean,
any sort of movie,

138
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.460
if I'm right in that movie script,
that guy as the hands of his 16 year old,

139
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.920
but he loses all of this fucking experience.

140
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

141
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.300
<v 4>Uh,
been on the road and all of a sudden he's got to go play a fucking arena and</v>

142
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:08.020
everybody wants to legend and he's coming out there with his young hands.

143
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.740
I can't remember his songs,
man.
He can't remember his socks.

144
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.410
I'd go,
my fucking hands fixed,
but I can't remember how this song goes.

145
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.110
I fucking don't remember this shit even though I'm the guy that fucking wrote
it.

146
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.310
You know that's a Netflix series right there.

147
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.380
Then you just see what it's like.

148
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:41.381
The whole meets Eddie van Halen and that'd be fucking the end of every episode

149
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:45.320
he walks away with this guitar,
you know,
hitchhiking.

150
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.820
Cause he got booed off the stage again because he couldn't remember how it went.

151
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:54.200
And like every fucking episode he remembers a little more of his catalog,

152
00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.500
but he has to practice so much that he's fucking up his hands again and he's

153
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:02.640
losing money because nobody's showing up.

154
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:06.330
And now he's not going to have the money to get the stem cell research again.

155
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.690
So of course the woman that fucking spun his blood in the center fuge becomes

156
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:17.160
his love interest.
Is Anybody writing this down?
This has to happen.
All right.

157
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.250
Do you have my permission to go into Netflix and you pitched this series?

158
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:21.730
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

159
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:26.100
<v 4>Okay.
You want to see,
you want to see a fucking streaming services,
um,
um,</v>

160
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.760
industry person's eyes fucking light up.
You just walk and go.

161
00:09:30.761 --> 00:09:32.110
I got an idea for a show.

162
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:37.630
It's like the incredible hulk makes Eddie van Halen and I guarantee you,

163
00:09:37.631 --> 00:09:41.110
you won't even have to get through the pitch and this going to be a fucking,

164
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.820
they're going to slide that check across the table as they play the,

165
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.710
what's that fucking song?
That quick little son they play.

166
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.350
It's almost like when you watch law and order,

167
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.253
<v 2>Ooh,</v>

168
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.890
<v 4>well they're going to do that except the Netflix song.</v>

169
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.900
It's really sort of just a note,
right,
isn't it?
They just hit one note.

170
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.530
I know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Um,
yes,
it's,

171
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.510
it's like,
it's like captain America meets CC Deville.

172
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.060
Just hear me out.
Well,

173
00:10:14.061 --> 00:10:17.720
my only question would be how does he get his hair underneath that mask?

174
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.610
I mean that,
that's,
that's what bumps for me does,
does he slick it down?

175
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.820
Do we see some hair coming out of one of the eye holes?

176
00:10:25.821 --> 00:10:27.680
I think that could be funny.
Do you guys think that could be,

177
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.760
I think that could be funny

178
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.660
<v 1>though.
I never laid a hand on you ma.
Much motherfucking time.</v>

179
00:10:34.661 --> 00:10:37.030
Do I have before the next phone or I got to do bill.

180
00:10:37.031 --> 00:10:38.950
Were you always funny as a kid?

181
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.250
Tell us what are you find funny today?

182
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:43.170
<v 2>Okay.</v>

183
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.590
<v 1>How do you come up with your material?
Do you have writers?</v>

184
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.340
<v 4>Do you pull from your real life?</v>

185
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.870
I just did an interview with these guys.
These guys were great,

186
00:10:53.871 --> 00:10:57.650
but in the end they go,
hey,
bill Cosby just got sentenced to 10 to 15 years.

187
00:10:57.651 --> 00:11:00.320
What do you think about that?
Well,
I mean nothing funny.

188
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.880
Are we going to end on this?
Um,

189
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.503
anyways.

190
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.120
<v 1>Anyways.
I mean that's,
that's right up there with fucking,
uh,
what's his face?</v>

191
00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:15.590
The tight end from the patriot.

192
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.770
<v 4>You know,</v>

193
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.200
just viewing somebody one way and all of a sudden you just look at them.

194
00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:23.100
The other one,
you're like,
Holy Shit.
And it just fucking affects the whole,

195
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:24.450
the whole way you look at their work.

196
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.280
<v 1>Bill,
can you,
can you separate the comedy from the drugging and the raping?</v>

197
00:11:30.281 --> 00:11:33.370
What do we return?
Well,
got some more.
Um,

198
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:39.100
Bill and you're familiar with the Hindenburg crash and we have audio new audio

199
00:11:39.101 --> 00:11:44.101
just surfaced we find on a 78 speed LP from back then of people on the

200
00:11:47.471 --> 00:11:52.000
Hindenburg screaming as they burned a death.
Uh,
have you heard it yet?

201
00:11:52.001 --> 00:11:53.710
And what are your thoughts?
This,

202
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.310
<v 5>okay.</v>

203
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.160
<v 1>Tell the folks what you're going to be joking about.</v>

204
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.263
<v 5>MMM.</v>

205
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.530
<v 1>Anyways,
let me,
let me,
uh,
I get seven more minutes before I got to hit pause</v>

206
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:10.400
and move on to this next one.
So anyways,
this stem cell research,
you know,

207
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.620
I got this fucked up shoulder and I've just been,
you know,
fixing it old school.

208
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.140
I'm thinking maybe when I go to Eastern Europe.

209
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:17.530
<v 5>Okay.</v>

210
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.810
<v 1>You know,
when I have a day off on my tour,</v>

211
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:23.470
I'm going to fucking stop in to some local place and like Transylvania or

212
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:26.830
something,
have my blood spun,
you know,

213
00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.960
good evening by one of these fucking guys.
Right.

214
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.780
Is it true that white people in Eastern Europe have flat heads like
Frankenstein?

215
00:12:35.781 --> 00:12:39.270
Do they have like bolts coming out of the side?
Um,
I don't know.

216
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:42.140
They were behind the fucking iron curtain the whole time I was growing up.

217
00:12:42.141 --> 00:12:44.300
So anyways,
I was talking to somebody about this shit

218
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.050
<v 5>and [inaudible]</v>

219
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.660
<v 1>a buddy at guy.
All of a sudden,</v>

220
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.070
this is all the stuff that people are whispering about right now.
Hey,

221
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.390
buddy of mine was in Australia and he got his knees done.

222
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:55.940
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

223
00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:00.690
<v 1>I saw him the other day.
He was jumping higher than a fucking pogo stick.
Right?</v>

224
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.020
And all this shit's getting in my head and I'm going like,
wow.
Stems.

225
00:13:03.021 --> 00:13:04.130
This is fucking incredible.

226
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.590
Doesn't have to do like a baby has to fucking die or something for them to be

227
00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:11.960
able to do it.
Is that what it is?

228
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.470
There's the rest of the world not care about dead babies.

229
00:13:16.471 --> 00:13:18.690
They just look at him like a fucking rusted out car,

230
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:20.763
<v 5>you know,</v>

231
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.310
<v 1>like a parts car cause you're,
you're,
you know,</v>

232
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.163
<v 5>you just</v>

233
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.600
<v 1>take it a little baby liver out of it and somehow you put,
I mean you don't bill,</v>

234
00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:33.310
it would probably help if you fucking read up on it.
They actually,

235
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.400
this guy was trying to tell me that through stem cell research they've actually

236
00:13:37.401 --> 00:13:39.410
cured male pattern baldness.

237
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:40.950
<v 5>Okay.</v>

238
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.720
<v 4>But there's so much money in fucking people like myself throwing Rogaine on</v>

239
00:13:45.721 --> 00:13:48.540
their head,
I don't do that shit.
I did it one time and I leave,

240
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.710
felt my heart speeding up.

241
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.680
Now I don't know if that was just the panic of me dealing with the fact that I

242
00:13:52.681 --> 00:13:55.470
was going bald or if it's actually a side effect.

243
00:13:55.471 --> 00:14:00.180
So allegedly my heart rate went up and I,
you know,
if it was,

244
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.540
I can't remember what the fuck was.
This was back in the two thousands

245
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:04.751
<v 1>in the year,</v>

246
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:09.580
2000 pounds in the year 2000

247
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.533
<v 5>mmm.</v>

248
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.190
<v 4>It'd be fucking hilarious.</v>

249
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.730
Do you understand how funny it would be if they actually had a cure for fucking

250
00:14:19.731 --> 00:14:20.564
baldness,

251
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.560
but they're just making so much money on the snake oil that they don't let it

252
00:14:24.561 --> 00:14:27.770
come out.
I was joking last night with some buddies of mine going,

253
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.770
do you realize that that would be like,

254
00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.210
like Rogaine and all of those guys are kind of like big,
big oil companies.

255
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.490
And then the cure for baldness would be like electric cars or solar.
You know,

256
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.180
and I gotta be honest with you,

257
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:47.520
I don't think that's the cure for like fucking the environment.

258
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.380
Cause you know God damn well all the raw materials and when you throw out old

259
00:14:51.381 --> 00:14:52.210
solar panels

260
00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.680
<v 1>or the,
your fucking Tesla ends up in the fucking ocean,</v>

261
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:57.620
that giant fucking battery,
God knows what it's gonna do.
The environment.

262
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.040
But I'll tell you right now that will,
that would be the end to isis.

263
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

264
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.330
<v 1>That would be the end of so many of these fucking terrorist groups.</v>

265
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.590
How are they funded?
They're funded with oil money.

266
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:11.040
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

267
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.170
<v 1>You know,
so if both pollute the environment,</v>

268
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.140
but only one of them finances.
The fucking cops were fighting.

269
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.720
Why don't we just switch over?

270
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:23.710
<v 0>Okay.</v>

271
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:28.620
<v 1>You know,
if every stadium in the NFL could go from natural grass,</v>

272
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:34.130
most of them I should say over to astro turf and then convert to sort of astro

273
00:15:35.011 --> 00:15:37.290
turf with old rubber tires in there.

274
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.890
If you could watch the NFL,

275
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:47.050
that billion dollar fucking industry industry changed three times in your

276
00:15:47.051 --> 00:15:48.190
fucking lifetime.

277
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.110
Why is it that we can't switch over to,

278
00:15:53.111 --> 00:15:56.880
so we should be having solar power with full heads of fucking hair,

279
00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.630
you know,
and that way we'd be then we,
I think,

280
00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:07.631
I think I just solved the entire Middle East problem in about 90 seconds.

281
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:10.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

282
00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:15.300
<v 1>You see that?
Do you see what happens
when,
when,
when,</v>

283
00:16:15.301 --> 00:16:20.301
when you're sitting by yourself and there's nobody to question your thoughts or

284
00:16:20.651 --> 00:16:24.430
debate you on any of your points.
Do you see how quickly

285
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.450
you are able to fucking solve problems?
And what do you mean this?

286
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:34.380
I just got a text message saying he didn't fucking call anybody.
Yeah,
you didn't,

287
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.440
you missed one of your phone is I called.

288
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:41.873
<v 0>Okay.</v>

289
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.900
<v 1>This six 45</v>

290
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:46.963
<v 5>and</v>

291
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.360
<v 1>the fucking</v>

292
00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.810
7:00 AM fucking cunts.

293
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.610
I got to put this on speaker here.
Whoa.
Hold on a second.
Hang on a second.
People,

294
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.890
according to my email,
I don't have another phone call until 7:30 AM

295
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.333
<v 5>period.</v>

296
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.200
<v 1>You gotta go with a period when,
when you do something like that,
you know,</v>

297
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.090
cause it's polite.
But it's Kurt.

298
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.540
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

299
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.600
<v 1>And then there'll be paranoid.
Like is he mad at me?
What is his tone?</v>

300
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.690
And then they back off and then they go,
oh,
I'm sorry,
my mistake.

301
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.740
Even if it was my mistake,
they actually take responsibility.

302
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.383
And that's how

303
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.740
as a person that stands on a stage and performs,

304
00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.850
that's how your ego slowly goes out of control,
you know?

305
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:40.770
And you see examples of it.

306
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:45.450
It would be like seeing another standup comedian talking about what other

307
00:17:45.451 --> 00:17:48.750
standup comedians should or shouldn't be talking about on stage.

308
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.830
It'd be like if that happened.
Um,

309
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:54.790
<v 0>okay.</v>

310
00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.980
<v 1>Yeah.
As far as I know.
The next one I'm calling or backs in O'brien,</v>

311
00:17:57.981 --> 00:18:01.910
BA and O'Brien in east long meadow,
Massachusetts.

312
00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

313
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.550
<v 1>And this is gonna hype.</v>

314
00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:09.350
My show in Springfield on October 4th at the mass mutual.

315
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

316
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.300
<v 1>I can't wait to do that Gig,
man.</v>

317
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:19.870
You got to understand like how many gigs I did in western Massachusetts that did

318
00:18:20.271 --> 00:18:24.570
not go well.
I've told this story.
I went out to exit too.
I got off in Lee,

319
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:26.970
Massachusetts.
I stood on stage in a restaurant.

320
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
I had a dinner roll thrown at me like fucking Nolan Ryan fucking throw it and I

321
00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:32.973
got it missed me.

322
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.150
Jesus Christ sounded like a fucking gunshot when it hit the back of the behind

323
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:39.120
the wall behind me.
I don't know if it was a stale role or what,

324
00:18:39.121 --> 00:18:42.360
but I'll tell you right now,
I'm still shaking,
you know?

325
00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.093
<v 0>Yes.</v>

326
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.980
<v 1>Oh Jesus.
Oh,
here's a text message.
See,</v>

327
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:52.080
I told you the period always works.

328
00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:00.070
Ah,
Shit.
I fucked up.
Got My time zones mixed.
Mixed up.
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:00.071 --> 00:19:01.870
See how that works.
Let me,

330
00:19:01.871 --> 00:19:05.350
I'm gonna read this back to you guys said I called the six 45 and the 7:00 AM

331
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.060
period according to my email.

332
00:19:07.061 --> 00:19:11.980
I don't have another phone call until 7:30 AM period.
And You keep it like that.

333
00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:17.770
No question marks.
No.
Is that cool?
Well,

334
00:19:17.771 --> 00:19:21.610
is it me?
He just fact period.

335
00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.590
Fact period.

336
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.170
skip the seven 31 I'll reschedule it.
Oh,
look at this.

337
00:19:30.171 --> 00:19:32.030
I'm going to get to knock out my whole podcast.

338
00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.690
Ya
though.

339
00:19:38.691 --> 00:19:40.920
I didn't fuck up my radio tour.

340
00:19:40.921 --> 00:19:45.890
Somebody was waiting for role freckles to fucking call a man.

341
00:19:45.891 --> 00:19:47.630
Talk about his fucking shit.

342
00:19:47.631 --> 00:19:52.631
Jokes that he's going to be telling at the mass mutual fucking center in

343
00:19:54.351 --> 00:19:58.520
Springfield,
Massachusetts.
They got the fucking NBA hall of fame.

344
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:00.290
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

345
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.930
<v 1>no,
I love about that place.
You get to go in there and take fucking you.</v>

346
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.350
In the end.
They got some hoops.
You can shoot a couple of fucking hoops.

347
00:20:06.351 --> 00:20:08.870
Take a three pointer.
You know,
I've been to all of them.

348
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.460
They don't have a batting cage at the baseball hall of fame,
nor should they,

349
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.800
because that's,
that's the purest one.

350
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:21.530
That is the hardest one to get into.
You know what I mean?

351
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.450
You have a better chance of bang in a fucking supermodel.

352
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.560
Then you do have getting into the fog.
You understand that

353
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:34.360
they getting into the fucking major league baseball hall of fame

354
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.450
because you know,
you,
you'd go to fucking New York,
you go to La,

355
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:40.410
you walked down the street,

356
00:20:40.411 --> 00:20:42.990
you'll see one of those supermodels walking down the street looking like a

357
00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:44.670
fucking giraffe and high heels.

358
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.630
<v 4>Maybe you say something,
maybe maybe you get,
throw him a line,</v>

359
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.180
maybe go reverse psychology.

360
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.690
You look at their designer bag and just this is that from,
is that,
uh,

361
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.590
I wish I knew line of a cheap line of is something,

362
00:21:06.591 --> 00:21:08.390
something that makes them question themselves,

363
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:10.663
<v 5>you know,</v>

364
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.340
<v 4>not that I've had this experience before,</v>

365
00:21:14.341 --> 00:21:16.560
but I would think that if that is what your job is,

366
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:18.763
<v 5>okay.</v>

367
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.550
<v 4>Every fucking day you just looking in the mirror knowing you're another day</v>

368
00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:27.120
older.
Oh Geez,
what am I talking about?
That's the business that I'm in.

369
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:29.583
<v 5>You know what I mean?</v>

370
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.260
<v 4>These people that come out here and they base it on their looks or get shit</v>

371
00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:39.130
because of their looks.
You know,
everybody's like,
they always looked at him,

372
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:42.040
you know,
and they love him and then eventually they,
they fucking,

373
00:21:42.041 --> 00:21:46.090
they don't like him anymore cause they're good looking and their beauty reminds

374
00:21:46.091 --> 00:21:50.380
them of the horror that they see every time they brush their own teeth.

375
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:56.990
Yeah.
You walk into the bathroom.

376
00:21:56.991 --> 00:22:00.860
Yeah.
Actually had somebody install a dimmer.

377
00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.320
You have the light on like 30%.
You just come walking in,
right.

378
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.330
And just start a memory.
You know,

379
00:22:11.331 --> 00:22:13.190
you're looking down cause you just don't want to catch,

380
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.250
you don't want to catch what you see in the mirror.
You just look down,

381
00:22:16.251 --> 00:22:19.250
you grab your toothbrush,
you put the toothpaste on it.
And at some point though,

382
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.070
<v 5>okay,</v>

383
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.960
<v 4>you have to look up and you have to face you.</v>

384
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.370
It's sometime she don't like what you see.

385
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.523
<v 5>MMM.</v>

386
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:34.910
<v 4>No,
it's a tough fucking game.</v>

387
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.400
You know what's funny about really good looking people like they're the only

388
00:22:37.401 --> 00:22:40.270
people who get called out for aging.
Have you?

389
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.210
Either that or people you went to high school with.
Well,

390
00:22:44.211 --> 00:22:45.830
back to my high school or uni.
Jesus Christ.

391
00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:47.480
Bill Bird looks like he's fucking in pappy on.

392
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.233
<v 5>MMM,</v>

393
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.930
<v 4>that'd be on when she has friends for Jose.
A butterfly.</v>

394
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.770
That meal prep meal.
Excuse him,
mom and Moselle.

395
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.033
Eylea

396
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:04.723
<v 5>um,</v>

397
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.270
there's a butterfly in the kit.
In the refrigerator.

398
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.310
<v 4>Why is the butterfly the refrigerator?
This is when you learn French.</v>

399
00:23:17.311 --> 00:23:19.320
This is the kind of shit you learn how to say.
Look Shit.

400
00:23:19.321 --> 00:23:24.090
You would never say if he went to France,
excuse a mom.
Amazon,
Lex,

401
00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.080
uh,
Lex pepe on down now.

402
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:32.060
Frigo a lap.
Ben.

403
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.490
Wait,
wait.

404
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.440
Basically should I fucking throw the thing out?
Cause it's obviously dead

405
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.710
kiss crusade.
Ooh,
Mike,

406
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.260
I'm not going to fucking torture you with my goddamn French.

407
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:53.320
I already did that to the wonderful people of France who had the fucking decency

408
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:53.780
to say,

409
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:58.780
we're not going to accept that poisoned food from your country unless you

410
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:03.820
fucking label it.
And then the wonderful people of this country,
we're like,

411
00:24:03.821 --> 00:24:07.610
there's no fucking word on afraid.
Once you're in the floor.
Yes,

412
00:24:07.611 --> 00:24:09.440
they talked like the devil and a heavy metal record.

413
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.740
That's how I picture those people work on an rig and foods.

414
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.950
<v 0>Okay.</v>

415
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:19.430
<v 4>We're old.
Ever quit.
Put it in your mouth and eat it.</v>

416
00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:25.310
Well,
we will stop making food.
Um,
I know this is fucking weird.

417
00:24:25.311 --> 00:24:27.090
What do you want from me?
It's like fucking seven in the morning.

418
00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:28.120
I ain't supposed to be up right now.

419
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.970
This is literally like a vampire at fucking getting up at noon to fucking watch

420
00:24:33.971 --> 00:24:35.640
the price is right.
Like I should not be

421
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.273
<v 0>okay.</v>

422
00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.780
<v 4>Seven 50
vampire watching the price is right.</v>

423
00:24:45.781 --> 00:24:48.420
Come up people.
That's fucking funny.
It's funny to me in the morning.

424
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.200
Hi or higher watching the games.
No.

425
00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.360
What a fucking drew Carey retired from the price is right and they hired a

426
00:25:00.361 --> 00:25:01.410
vampire to host it.

427
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.923
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

428
00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:07.160
<v 4>You know,
they'd have to start doing the tapings at night.
Good evening.</v>

429
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.480
Welcome to the prices,
right.
Oh my God.

430
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.780
I'm going to fucking pitch that to fucking Hulu.
All right.

431
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:19.760
This is like a game show meets Bram Stoker's whatever the fucking,

432
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:22.640
I never watched any of those stupid fucking movies.

433
00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:28.770
The last vampire movie I watched was Brad Pitt.
It fucking,

434
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.780
um,
no,
that's not true.

435
00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:32.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

436
00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.650
<v 4>I watched the one where the little girl was the vampire,</v>

437
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.070
her and her and her dad moved into the complex.

438
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.063
<v 0>Okay.</v>

439
00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.560
<v 4>That was a cool one.
That is true.</v>

440
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.200
I just told,
I just basically caught myself in a lie,

441
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:53.461
you know?
Do you know,

442
00:25:53.461 --> 00:25:56.110
it's been like a month since I've flown a helicopter and I just keep seeing

443
00:25:56.111 --> 00:25:57.330
these fucking magnet pis,

444
00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.660
<v 2>Bao,
Bao,
Bao,
Bao,
Bao,
Bao by now.</v>

445
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.880
<v 4>How would that fucking song goes?
That's what I was songs she can't hum.</v>

446
00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:04.700
Except for the beginning.

447
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.580
<v 2>Banaynay 80.
Neat.</v>

448
00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.690
<v 4>It goes off.
It goes up the fucking real.
We'll bill.</v>

449
00:26:09.691 --> 00:26:12.570
Maybe if you watched the show a little more.
Um,

450
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.040
you know,
it's fucking weird about that show.
Like,

451
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:20.050
<v 0>okay.</v>

452
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.600
<v 4>Oh boy.
Let me get to the point.
Every time I see that fucking,</v>

453
00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.990
that beautiful MD 500

454
00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.790
when he's flying that fucking helicopter,
I'm just like,
I'm like,
I'm really like,

455
00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.110
I'm watching that fucking show.

456
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:35.410
And I liked that they went old school with the helicopter,

457
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.320
but I feel like they should've given him a new Ferrari

458
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:44.010
because that's not one of the classic for,
I was like that for hours,
not worth a

459
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.740
<v 1>lot of money,
you know?
As far as Ferrari's go,
like you could,</v>

460
00:26:47.741 --> 00:26:50.790
you could pick up one of those fucking for Robbie's.
Let me,
let me know.

461
00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.100
Let's that like,
we know that it's fucking,

462
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:56.400
look at the price of one of those fucking things right now.
What do you say?

463
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:59.880
They're freckles.
All right.

464
00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.510
We're looking up Tom Salix Ferrari.
They,

465
00:27:02.511 --> 00:27:06.330
we're going to see how much it fucking costs.
Magnum,

466
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.260
not condoms.
Magnum p I,

467
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:11.760
<v 5>yeah,</v>

468
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.990
<v 1>do,
do,
do,
do,
do,
do battle.
[inaudible] like,
I can't remember how it goes.</v>

469
00:27:15.991 --> 00:27:19.380
Magnum Pi Ferrari.

470
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.640
I would stay at three Oh eight gts.
All right,
let's look that up.

471
00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:26.130
F E R r a r.
I

472
00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:31.120
what did I just say?
Three Oh

473
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.910
eight GTB and gts.
Okay,
let's see.

474
00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.810
Uh,
the fried.
Oh,
you fucking Wikipedia.
Can't

475
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:49.110
God damn.
Motherfucker.
Why does,
why is it my,

476
00:27:49.111 --> 00:27:51.780
all my fucking defaults go to those assholes.
You know what?

477
00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.390
Probably cause you went to it too many times.
Ah,
this douche again.

478
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:55.850
<v 5>Okay.</v>

479
00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:59.750
<v 1>Wikipedia.
The Bald Khan has another question for you.</v>

480
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:05.210
Tell them I'm not here to like,
hey Belk.

481
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:10.190
I just see again.
What,
how old Gavin Macleod?
Ah,

482
00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.340
fucking 85.
Alright.

483
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:18.310
Ferrari three Oh eight gts for sale.

484
00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.750
Now I imagine the price went up cause magnet pis coming back bowed out out.

485
00:28:22.751 --> 00:28:27.730
I own,
I own amp or nothing.
Okay.
All right.
Three Oh eight gts for sale.

486
00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.910
I remember Barry Katz,
I trashed him on his own podcast.

487
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.360
He owned a half the stand ups in the fucking world money and he went out and

488
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:41.220
bought one of these things.
Yeah.
At 54,000.
It's still a lot of money.

489
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:47.040
79,000.
Get the fuck Outta here.
Oh,
that one.

490
00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:50.280
Joy Bay.
Huh?
I don't know why I said her name.
I just want,

491
00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:51.900
I just wanted to say her name.

492
00:28:51.901 --> 00:28:54.150
She's one of the coolest fucking people I've met in this business by the way.

493
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.950
Don't sleep on fucking joy Behar.

494
00:28:55.951 --> 00:29:00.900
I did an episode with of crashing with her and she was fucking hilarious.

495
00:29:00.901 --> 00:29:03.810
All right.
Uh,
64,
five.

496
00:29:03.811 --> 00:29:07.950
What about the ones from the 80s 83 is 79,000.

497
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:13.380
1980 70,000.
Jesus,
you know something.

498
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.140
When people buy Ferrari's in the supercars,

499
00:29:16.141 --> 00:29:18.300
everyone thinks it's a giant fucking waste of money,

500
00:29:18.301 --> 00:29:21.150
but you know they really retain their value.

501
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.480
There's no way that fucking car costs that.
Ma,

502
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.110
I'm going to go out on a limb and say it didn't cost that amount of money when

503
00:29:28.111 --> 00:29:30.810
you first bought it.
It actually appreciated in value

504
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.140
after what these bankers did,

505
00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:38.310
this fucking country in 2008 this people in houses that are never going to

506
00:29:38.311 --> 00:29:41.080
appreciate value as far as what?
They still own it on it.

507
00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.530
<v 4>People,
I'm telling you right now,</v>

508
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:49.700
he wanted to turn around your financial fucking situation.

509
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:51.210
<v 5>Okay?</v>

510
00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:55.150
<v 4>You sell your house,
you buy a Ferrari fucking g,</v>

511
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.960
t s and you live in that mother fucker.

512
00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:01.530
Eventually that car's going to be worth more money.

513
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:06.390
Then you owe for your house.
Well,
you sold the fucking thing,

514
00:30:06.391 --> 00:30:08.580
but you still owe more than what it was worth.
So you know what I'm saying?

515
00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:13.230
There's a balance there that needs to be dealt with.
You don't drive it anywhere.

516
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:14.240
<v 5>Okay?</v>

517
00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.310
<v 4>You just fucking do alternate side,</v>

518
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.820
weak fucking parking and you just sit in it to a one day.

519
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:25.910
That fucking car is worth more than once you own your house plus a Turkey

520
00:30:26.031 --> 00:30:29.060
Sandwich,
then you sell it.
Then you walk down the street,

521
00:30:29.061 --> 00:30:33.320
you get yourself a Turkey sandwich and you like,
you know what?
That's delicious.

522
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:34.610
And now I have nothing.

523
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:37.583
<v 5>MMM.</v>

524
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:42.010
<v 4>What's that country where bankers get put to death if they do shit like these</v>

525
00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:44.950
fucking constant in this country,
you know?

526
00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:51.770
Is it Singapore?
Is it somewhere in Malaysia?
It's a Thailand,

527
00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:57.500
Laos,
Vietnam,
India,
China,

528
00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.250
Mongolia,
Japan,
Guam,

529
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.830
<v 5>um,
DG.</v>

530
00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:11.660
<v 4>We honeymooned in Fiji we had a hot,
it was so amazing.</v>

531
00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.330
You look through the floor,
you could see the fucking ocean.

532
00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:22.180
It's one of those things,
like if I was a woman and my husband took me

533
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.680
to one of those fucking huts that sits over the ocean,

534
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:31.600
like I wouldn't be able to sleep comfortably because I feel like if your

535
00:31:31.601 --> 00:31:33.370
husband's ever going to fucking kill you,

536
00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:37.360
it's either going to be 20 years into your marriage or on the honeymoon.

537
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.020
So you got to get past that first hiccup and just knowing,

538
00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:42.500
<v 5>okay,</v>

539
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.010
<v 4>that this dude could kill you and then just drop you right through the fucking</v>

540
00:31:46.011 --> 00:31:50.870
floor.
You know?
Any other thing,

541
00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.950
ladies,
if I can give you any advice,
like you want to be in a hotel,

542
00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.630
so if he drops through the floor,

543
00:31:56.631 --> 00:32:00.020
you land in somebody else's room in at least he's going to get caught,
you know?

544
00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:02.750
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

545
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:06.680
<v 4>Don't go to that fucking hut that's on stilts above the Goddamn Ocean.</v>

546
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:12.540
Don't take a cruise,
don't go scuba diving.

547
00:32:12.541 --> 00:32:16.400
These are all fucking stories you hear.
I Dunno if they're true.

548
00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.260
It's just people you know,

549
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:22.340
say them and then I repeat them without ever doing any research.

550
00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:23.811
There was that woman,

551
00:32:23.811 --> 00:32:28.010
she went on a fucking honeymoon and so much she got eaten by a shark or fucking

552
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.970
like the guy shut off the oxygen tank.

553
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:36.330
It was on the fucking honeymoon.

554
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:44.940
<v 1>This is why they should have a fucking class in high school teaching people how</v>

555
00:32:44.941 --> 00:32:46.530
to get out of a relationship.

556
00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.030
Do you understand this person was in a fucking relationship with somebody that

557
00:32:52.031 --> 00:32:55.930
they did not want to fucking be with and all they had to do is just sit down and

558
00:32:55.931 --> 00:33:00.040
say,
listen,
we have to talk.
I'm not happy.
I love you,

559
00:33:00.041 --> 00:33:05.020
but I don't love you in a way that makes me want to marry you.
I'm sorry.

560
00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:06.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

561
00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.040
<v 1>And that's all you have to say.</v>

562
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:12.450
How long did that take to say that she's going to cry?
Be Shocked.

563
00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:17.540
Possibly throw something at you,
call you in the face,

564
00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:21.500
called the police and said that you attacked her and then you go to fucking
jail.

565
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:22.663
Right.

566
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:23.780
<v 0>Okay.</v>

567
00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.660
<v 1>Fucking with you.
But I'm just saying,
yeah,
it's literally a fucking fifth.</v>

568
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.520
It's a 15 second statement.

569
00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:31.160
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

570
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.910
<v 1>I know.
It's awkward.
You don't want to fucking do it,
but just memorize it.</v>

571
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:40.540
Just sit down and say it so you're not standing there at a fucking wedding

572
00:33:40.701 --> 00:33:42.590
going,
what the fuck am I doing?

573
00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:48.580
And just avoiding confrontation and standing there going with this ring I wear.

574
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:52.490
Do you flop,
sweated fucking jackass.

575
00:33:52.491 --> 00:33:55.670
Agree to take this woman who's fucking ecstatic because she doesn't know what

576
00:33:55.671 --> 00:33:59.270
you're feeling and you're sitting there,
your head's going.
Don't say it.

577
00:33:59.271 --> 00:34:03.830
Don't say it.
[inaudible] you go,
I do do do,
do.

578
00:34:03.831 --> 00:34:06.470
And then you're like,
now how the fuck do I get out of this?

579
00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.450
Now I'm going to get divorced one day maybe.

580
00:34:12.451 --> 00:34:16.080
And that's a combination at the fucking divorce laws is so fucking brutal.

581
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:22.660
And then all these strong women are out there getting fucking ridiculous amounts

582
00:34:22.961 --> 00:34:25.660
of money for child support.
He saw the whole fucking thing.

583
00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.760
So do you realize rather than just simply breaking up with the person,

584
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.250
this fucking guy goes,
I know

585
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.040
we're going to get certified to scuba dive.

586
00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:40.500
<v 0>Okay,</v>

587
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.180
<v 1>we're going to go underneath the ocean.</v>

588
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:45.270
I'm going to shut off for fucking tank and went to work.

589
00:34:45.271 --> 00:34:49.110
This whole fucking story,
having never committed any sort of major crime.

590
00:34:49.111 --> 00:34:51.210
I think I'm going to sit across from the cops,

591
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:52.440
<v 0>okay.</v>

592
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.220
<v 1>And be able to hold it together and get away with fucking,</v>

593
00:34:56.221 --> 00:34:59.940
I'm going to break the fifth fucking commandment and for the rest of my fucking

594
00:34:59.941 --> 00:35:00.774
life,

595
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.980
I'm never going to enjoy one day knowing,

596
00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.210
<v 0>okay.</v>

597
00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:08.280
<v 1>That I took another life.</v>

598
00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:10.330
Do you know one time that I know I'm off the rails here?
I,
you know,

599
00:35:10.331 --> 00:35:11.320
one time I fucking,

600
00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:15.580
there was this rapper from Africa and he was one of those boys,

601
00:35:15.581 --> 00:35:20.230
soldiers over there that fucking gets commandeered at like nine and kills more

602
00:35:20.231 --> 00:35:24.370
people than fucking Rambo by the time he's 11.
Um,

603
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.370
he was talking when his album came out,

604
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:31.430
he was talking about,
uh,

605
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:38.010
all these rappers in America that would brag about killing somebody and he was

606
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.190
<v 4>fucking,
he said one of the coldest things,</v>

607
00:35:41.191 --> 00:35:46.191
but like so true where he was just like basically saying they were full of Shit.

608
00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:53.380
He said,
when you kill somebody,
you don't brag about it.
It haunts you.

609
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.640
<v 5>Okay.</v>

610
00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.460
<v 1>And I was like,
oh my God,
I got to listen to this fucking guy's album.</v>

611
00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:59.150
<v 5>Okay.</v>

612
00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:01.520
<v 1>You know?
I mean,
how do you not fucking listen to that guy?</v>

613
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:03.200
<v 5>Okay.</v>

614
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.690
<v 4>I mean,
if you're listening to this shit,
I know what you're saying right now,</v>

615
00:36:05.691 --> 00:36:07.670
but what is the guy's name?
I don't remember,

616
00:36:07.671 --> 00:36:12.590
but I don't think there's a lot of fucking boy soldiers that turned MCS out

617
00:36:12.591 --> 00:36:13.424
there,

618
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.333
<v 5>you know?</v>

619
00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:19.390
<v 1>All right.
Have I talked enough?
I have to do a little bit of advertising here.</v>

620
00:36:19.391 --> 00:36:19.721
People.

621
00:36:19.721 --> 00:36:23.920
I don't have the advertising yet because I'm so ahead of the fucking game,

622
00:36:23.921 --> 00:36:25.360
you know?
I feel that I did.
I did the upon,

623
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:30.390
I just did the podcasting equivalent of doing the dishes before you go to bed.

624
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:36.560
I'm tell you what,
if you suffer from fucking depression,
not clinical,

625
00:36:36.561 --> 00:36:39.650
but just fucking low take,
it's going to work out for me,
man.

626
00:36:39.651 --> 00:36:42.740
If that's what your fucking brain says to you and you want to start turning it

627
00:36:42.741 --> 00:36:45.380
around,
I'll tell you something.
Nothing lifts your spirits.

628
00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:46.570
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

629
00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:47.410
<v 1>Like fucking,</v>

630
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:48.310
<v 5>yeah.</v>

631
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:53.310
<v 1>Common downstairs in the morning and all the dishes had done a walking across</v>

632
00:36:53.621 --> 00:36:58.520
your fucking apartment,
or maybe you're in a fucking studio.
Okay.

633
00:36:58.521 --> 00:37:02.700
And the sinks right next to your futon.
Hey,
I've been there,
you know,

634
00:37:02.701 --> 00:37:06.510
and that Faucet keeps fucking tripping and you can't get it to shut it off,

635
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.350
shut off seats,

636
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:12.350
put a towel in there and you just lay there thinking that you solved the problem

637
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:15.890
and then eventually the towel gets too wet.

638
00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.190
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

639
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:22.190
<v 1>And rather than hearing the sound of the water hitting that fucking stainless</v>

640
00:37:22.441 --> 00:37:24.780
steel,
it then becomes the fucking towel and you just hear

641
00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:31.803
<v 5>Yup.</v>

642
00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.390
<v 1>And then you start thinking,
maybe I could get certified,</v>

643
00:37:34.391 --> 00:37:36.430
just go scuba diving with my landlord

644
00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:43.480
rather than calling a plumber.
All right.
Um,
yeah.

645
00:37:43.481 --> 00:37:48.070
That in making,
making the bed,
make the bed before you go to work,
come home.

646
00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:51.410
<v 4>You know,
some,
I don't know what it is.
You get into a bed that's made,
it's,</v>

647
00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:56.060
it's more fucking comfortable.
The sheets are all fucked up and everything.

648
00:37:56.061 --> 00:37:58.070
He just,
it's just,
it's awful.

649
00:37:59.050 --> 00:37:59.370
<v 5>Okay.</v>

650
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:00.203
<v 4>You know what I mean?</v>

651
00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:01.690
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

652
00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:05.080
<v 4>It's like if you grab a newspaper off the newspaper stand and nobody's read it,</v>

653
00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:09.890
it just,
uh,
it's just CRISPR.
The words jump out at you.
But if you pick one up,

654
00:38:09.891 --> 00:38:11.180
you know,
at the bus station,
you know,

655
00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.200
pull it off as some bumps fucking face with sleeping,
right.

656
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:19.980
It just doesn't seem the same.
And you know what,
that's one to grow on.
All right.

657
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:23.990
Um,
I'm gonna shut this off and then I'll fucking splice everything together and

658
00:38:23.991 --> 00:38:26.060
you'll,
you'll never know the difference.

659
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:30.530
<v 1>All right?
This is weird,
you know,</v>

660
00:38:30.531 --> 00:38:33.080
I guess it's just pretend like I already have the advertising.
All right.

661
00:38:33.081 --> 00:38:35.060
People are,
we do a couple of advertising reads here.

662
00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:41.120
Hey,
what's going on?
All right.
It's bill burr.
I'm back.
I always have to say,
hey,

663
00:38:41.121 --> 00:38:42.320
what's going on when I'm starting,

664
00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.670
I'm trying to get the fucking copy here for the,
uh,
the goddamn reads.

665
00:38:46.671 --> 00:38:50.720
And of course it's not working out.
Why would it work out?

666
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:54.140
Why would anything I totally fucked up with my goddamn computer.

667
00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:58.100
The thing was filling up.
It told me it was going to be filled up.

668
00:38:58.101 --> 00:38:59.210
I fucking ignored it.

669
00:38:59.211 --> 00:39:03.530
Now it's now it's completely fucking full and I keep trying to put them onto

670
00:39:03.531 --> 00:39:06.020
these little fucking lightening sticks,
whatever the fuck he call them.

671
00:39:06.021 --> 00:39:09.980
It used to stick in the Saudi computer.
First one worked fine,

672
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.630
got all the pictures and video on it.
Second one.
I go fuck yourself bill.

673
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:16.130
Now I got to play a game.

674
00:39:16.131 --> 00:39:19.310
Now I only have it on one of these fucking sticks and they are called lightening

675
00:39:19.311 --> 00:39:21.470
sticks in my world.
All right,
Amigo.

676
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:23.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

677
00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:25.830
<v 1>Uh,
no.
That's as ami go.</v>

678
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:27.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

679
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:30.380
<v 1>Like you know it's funny.
Back in the day you could read Lord and Taylor,</v>

680
00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.430
Jordan Marsh.
Now everybody's got to be so God damn cool.
Oh,

681
00:39:34.431 --> 00:39:38.990
am I a g o Oh my,

Oh me go.

682
00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.450
Oh me,

All me go.

683
00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:45.800
A revolutionary toilet seat replacement for your fork and age.

684
00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.100
Are you anal about cleanliness in the bathroom?

685
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.690
Have you really ever thought about wiping with toilet paper?

686
00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:59.120
Like really thought about it.
Please click for a demonstration in details.
Yeah,

687
00:39:59.121 --> 00:40:01.450
I'm going to skip that.
A wash

688
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.790
washing you in all the right places.
All this is the,
all that the thing here.

689
00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.000
So it's like a bad day.
Is that what we're talking about?

690
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:14.530
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

691
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:19.220
<v 1>All right.
Let me see.
Okay.
They got this smiling guy meet.</v>

692
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.360
Oh,
me go.
Oh,
go all my go.
All right.
Let's listen to this.

693
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:32.170
<v 2>You see this.
This is the past,
and frankly that's toilet paper.</v>

694
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.360
Let me introduce you to the future.

695
00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:40.210
Is Omega a new high tech toilets and it changes everything.

696
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:44.770
It's going to spray water up your ass.
First thing's first installation,

697
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:50.130
handyman.
But it's fast and easy.
Just take off.

698
00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:54.710
<v 1>He's no handy man.
And there's a woman fucking doing it.
Yeah,
there she is.</v>

699
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:57.600
<v 2>Water.
Plug it in.
She's ready to go.</v>

700
00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.990
<v 1>I can't tell if that's sexist or empowering.</v>

701
00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:06.330
I mean,
he didn't know how to do what she did,

702
00:41:06.331 --> 00:41:08.130
but she was on her knees in the bathroom.

703
00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.230
<v 2>The first thing I notice is that the seat.</v>

704
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:14.670
<v 1>Oh,
for fuck sakes.
I'm fucking long.
Does it have to be all right?</v>

705
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.350
Evidently it sprays water up your ass.

706
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:25.490
And that's the way of the future.
All right.
Adjust the water temperature,

707
00:41:25.491 --> 00:41:28.280
the position in case it's fucking,

708
00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:34.110
it's treating your taint like it wants equal rights.
Uh,
water,
water,

709
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.920
water temperature,

710
00:41:36.921 --> 00:41:41.740
position pressure with movement with,

711
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:45.680
yeah.
I guess there are different size assholes out there.
Features,
heated seat.

712
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:48.890
I'll fuck goodness sake.
Are you serious?

713
00:41:48.891 --> 00:41:51.980
You see I'm trying to learn how to not to not curse in front of a my daughter

714
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.240
for goodness sakes.

715
00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:58.530
J C F and g d m f C.
Um,

716
00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:01.250
alright.
A heated seat.

717
00:42:01.251 --> 00:42:05.930
A nightlight soft closing air dry,

718
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:07.600
remote controlled.

719
00:42:07.601 --> 00:42:12.601
Deodorizer is there not enough global warming that we got to turn this thing?

720
00:42:12.621 --> 00:42:15.620
I mean how much,
what is the carbon footprint and this fucking thing.

721
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:19.570
Say Goodbye to toilet paper.
Save trees.
You saving.

722
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:21.110
Why the fuck are you saving water?

723
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:26.410
Maybe I'm save water and electricity by having a heated seat and water spraying

724
00:42:27.171 --> 00:42:31.280
up your ass as opposed to a cold seat with toilet paper.

725
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.370
You U s alone uses 36 million rolls of toilet paper in one day.

726
00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:41.090
Clean and safe.
Automatic self cleaning on demand.

727
00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:45.980
Silver Ini sterilize.
Install yourself and just 20 minutes.

728
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.900
Get a hundred dollars off your,

729
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:52.810
your order when you go to all my omi goal dog.

730
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.780
All my go.
Amigo,
my Amigo Dotcom.

731
00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:02.320
Slash.
Bird.
That's O.
M.
I g.
O.
Go to Omi.

732
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:06.610
Go Meiomi go.com my homie.
Oh go.

733
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:12.020
Uh,
my Meiomi go.com/bird.
He got $100 off the future.
Seems Weird at first.

734
00:43:12.021 --> 00:43:16.100
Let it be weird.
All right.
Maybe I'm behind the Times somehow.

735
00:43:16.101 --> 00:43:20.810
That's more environmentally friendly.
All right.
Oh look,

736
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:25.240
look who it is.
It's not us.
It's him.
A,

737
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:26.270
here's a problem.

738
00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:31.160
66% of men lose their hair by age 35.

739
00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:35.180
Hey,
that's a sensitive subject with me.

740
00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:39.650
Thing is when you start to notice hair loss,
it's too late.

741
00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:43.040
Um,
all right,
well I guess I don't need to pay attention for the rest of this.

742
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.590
It's easier to keep the hair you have then to replace the hair.

743
00:43:48.591 --> 00:43:50.540
You've lost all this is fucking genius.

744
00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:53.060
We already got the ball guys dumping shit on their head.

745
00:43:53.061 --> 00:43:56.900
Let's get people have full heads of hair to get paranoid.
I love this.
Uh,

746
00:43:56.901 --> 00:43:57.750
is that hairline?

747
00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.920
<v 2>Oh,</v>

748
00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.850
<v 1>he's starting to recede.
Started moving backward.
Any bald spots yet?</v>

749
00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:07.350
How will you feel a year from now if it's business as usual up there?

750
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:09.910
I thought you just said if it,
you're already losing your hair.
It's too late.

751
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.320
Some of these kids,
the way they write their copy out,
boy,

752
00:44:14.321 --> 00:44:17.980
I'll tell you why did guys turned a weird solutions or do nothing?

753
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.700
Well,
what the fee.
It's shit.
Nami is,
yeah.
This,
this,

754
00:44:21.701 --> 00:44:25.120
all of this copy shitting all over me.
Uh,
when they can,

755
00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.250
they can turn to medicine and science.

756
00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:33.190
I wanted to age naturally and Gotcha.
Uh,

757
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.710
what hymns does is connect with real doctors and medical grade solutions to

758
00:44:37.711 --> 00:44:42.690
treat hair loss well known generic equivalents to name brand prescription pricks

759

765
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:05.670
Women Have Alopecia sometimes answer a few quick questions.

766
00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:08.850
Doctors were review and can,
can prescribe you.

767
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.570
A product is shipped directly to your door.
Order.

768
00:45:12.571 --> 00:45:17.571
Now my listeners get a trial month of hymns for just $5 right now while supplies

769
00:45:17.611 --> 00:45:19.620
last.
See websites for full details.

770
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.290
This would cost hundreds if you went to the doctor or a pharmacy.
Well,

771
00:45:23.291 --> 00:45:26.490
you could also see the doctor as opposed to this shit.
When you say doctors,

772
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:29.430
look at it.
How the fuck do I know?

785
00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:21.040

<v 1>How the fuck is adding electricity to a toilet seat?</v>

813
00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:11.900
More Environment and fucking a water fountain up your ass more environmentally.

814
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:14.890
I mean that,
that,

That right there was,

815
00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:17.850
is the reason why I don't invent shit because on paper,

I'm going to be at the La Forum tomorrow night wearing a Larry Bird Jersey.
No,

820
00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:38.960
I wouldn't do that to you.
I thought about it,
but I'm not going to do that.
Why?

821
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:41.160
Why not make it an enjoyable experience.

822
00:48:41.161 --> 00:48:43.050
I'm going to get the La Forum tomorrow night.
Get your tickets.

Paul Versey,</v>

827
00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:00.520
Paul Versey,
owner of an absolutely beautiful,
uh,

828
00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:05.530
Toyota Lexus.
Daddy.
Say it.
Lexus by Toyota.
All right.

829
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.520
Have a great weekend.
You cuts

830
00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:08.893
<v 2>pets.</v>

831
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:12.510
<v 4>Both.
Okay.</v>

832
00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:19.130
I'm really crying and I just think it's nice that after all these years,

833
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:24.090
the Emmy's finally stepped up and gave everybody else in a ward.

834
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:28.730
Um,
Jason's,
my wife was watching that thing last night.
What a fucking shit show.

835
00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:41.230
<v 2>Hey,
dapper stranger need to live</v>

836
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.610
her in the van with the kids.
Is that right?

837
00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.910
<v 4>I don't know,
man.
I gotta tell you something.</v>

838
00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:51.940
There's no way that it's worse.

839
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:56.990
It's for someone who is into watching award shows out award show to make them

840
00:50:57.011 --> 00:50:58.090
watch sports.

841
00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.110
There's no way that that's a worse experience than someone who watches sports.

842
00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:06.220
Having to sit there and watch a fucking,
the Emmy's,
you know,

843
00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:10.840
I didn't have to sit there.
I kinda had it had to because uh,
you know,

844
00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.330
I didn't see my wife and a couple of days and she was like,

845
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:15.280
I want to hang out with you.

846
00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:20.410
And then we had to sit there and just watch these fucking things.
It just,
ugh.

847
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:22.110
<v 2>Okay.</v>

848
00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:24.390
<v 4>The actress,
it just so God damn dramatic.
Yeah.</v>

849
00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:29.010
<v 2>Tammy goes to
Sarah.
Awesome.</v>

850
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:40.160
This is the first Emmy win and six nomination for Sarah Hall.

851
00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:43.680
I had one of those mouth wedding drops and now I can't feel my face.

852
00:51:43.681 --> 00:51:44.640
So this is a problem.

853
00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:49.530
It was because you thought I could that I even dared.
Yeah,

854
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.310
<v 4>because you believed in me.
I dared to try.</v>

855
00:51:56.010 --> 00:52:00.300
I almost fucking threw up whoever the hell said that because you believed in me.

856
00:52:00.301 --> 00:52:04.050
I dared to try.
It's like you're a fucking actor.

857
00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:07.740
It's a killer script.
You what?
You're going to turn it down.

858
00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.080
That fucking Oj mini series was,
was unbelievable good.

859
00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:15.000
Turn up the pressure pressure.
You want to turn up the pressure.

860
00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:20.040
I don't believe in me,
but because you did.
I dared,
I dared to try.

861
00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:23.283
<v 5>Ugh.</v>

862
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.890
<v 4>Worst things I've ever heard.
You know,</v>

863
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:32.420
other than when you call up the cable company,
if you learn to do these days,

864
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:37.020
when you get into that,
talking to a robot lady is one notch lower than that.

865
00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:38.700
I'm not shitting on the actor.
You know what I mean?

866
00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:40.470
They get God because they're like that.

867
00:52:40.471 --> 00:52:42.930
That's why they give the great performances and because I'm a cunt,

868
00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:44.450
that's why I do stand up.
You know what I mean?

869
00:52:44.451 --> 00:52:48.150
So everybody finds the little fucking hole is supposed to crawl into,
oh my God,

870
00:52:48.151 --> 00:52:49.540
there's always,
these are,

871
00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:53.490
these are important stories and they need to be told

872
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:58.080
<v 8>Doerries that provoke conversation,
necessary conversation.</v>

873
00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:02.970
And it also creates privilege.
When you take women,

874
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.460
people of Color,
trans people,
Queer people,

875
00:53:05.461 --> 00:53:10.350
and you put them at the center of the story,
these subjects,

876
00:53:10.351 --> 00:53:12.210
instead of the objects,

877
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:13.343
<v 4>you change the world.</v>

878
00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.970
<v 2>We found out</v>

879
00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:22.260
<v 4>just take a shiny thing and leave.
Just give us the keys.</v>

880
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.680
Oh,
oh God.

881
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:30.180
<v 1>Because you believed me.
I dared to try.</v>

882
00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:33.750
Um,
I dared to try

883
00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:38.500
the next time my wife compliments me.

884
00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:42.160
I'm going to say that to her because she believed in me.

885
00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:44.200
I dared to try.

886
00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:50.780
These are stories that need to be told.
We're storytellers.

887
00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.610
It with us,
without us giving people a voice.

888
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:03.960
You know what else is great?
You know,
as the Emmys,

889
00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:08.610
I think the Emmy's got scared by all this shit.
The Oscars.
God,
you know,

890
00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:12.480
and what was funny is as many people of color,
that one,

891
00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:17.850
what are the funniest shots all night long was when you know,
if you looked,

892
00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:22.380
if they just would like do a shot behind Jimmy Kimmel and you saw the front row,

893
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.270
it looked like a great mix of everybody.
But when they did the,

894
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:31.300
the shot was when they'd come back from commercial and you saw the whole crowd.

895
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:35.610
It was like from the thousandth row up to the third row,

896
00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.990
it was all white.

897
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:40.253
<v 5>It was like,</v>

898
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:48.950
<v 1>it looks like a foreign,
a concert from the back row all the way,</v>

899
00:54:48.951 --> 00:54:51.740
like the third rail.
But if they did it the way they shot it,

900
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:56.900
they front end loaded like the 15 black people that were there.

901
00:54:56.901 --> 00:55:00.860
They just had them all right in front the juice box.
You would like a juice box.

902
00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:03.380
There you go.
Take the whole thing.

903
00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:07.580
Some Asian people and all that,
but all the way to the back.

904
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:11.180
I was joking with Nia,
like if you live in New York City,

905
00:55:11.181 --> 00:55:14.750
every once in a while you go into one of those bodegas.
Etsy that deal and drugs.

906
00:55:14.751 --> 00:55:18.140
It just going on at business.
A little corner stores called Bodega's.

907
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.310
Say it with me,

908
00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:25.240
both Degas and it looks like it's fucking stocked with food and you grab that

909
00:55:26.091 --> 00:55:29.000
one can of food and you look and it's like behind that can,

910
00:55:29.001 --> 00:55:32.750
this is just completely empty.
So I did get some laughs while watching it.

911
00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:36.080
Jesus Christ,
the weight of every fucking thing that they say.

912
00:55:36.081 --> 00:55:36.914
It's just unbelieve.

913
00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.420
It's just like that inside the actor's studio when that fucking guy just sits

914
00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:46.421
there like I hope you realize the presence of greatness that we are.

915
00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:48.650
You know,
it's just like Jesus Christ.
Dude,

916
00:55:48.651 --> 00:55:52.040
you fucking get pretending to be a fireman.
Relax.

917
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.410
<v 2>We've arrived at a difficult moment.
Of course,</v>

918
00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:06.150
<v 1>it was so brave.
It was such a brave performance.
You know what I mean?</v>

919
00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:09.390
There's this fucking people update at the end of building skyscrapers and shit.

920
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:13.380
Oh,
those guys who go up and they change.
You ever see those things?
Mike,

921
00:56:13.381 --> 00:56:16.050
my palms literally sweat watching these people.

922
00:56:16.051 --> 00:56:19.110
They climb all the way up those towers to change the fucking light.

923
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:22.770
The little light bulb at the top of the tower at the top of the fucking
building.

924
00:56:22.771 --> 00:56:26.620
So,
so plain can see it at night and they get that part where they unhooked the

925
00:56:26.621 --> 00:56:27.454
safety thing.

926
00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.670
Free climbing is more dangerous of course.

927
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:34.190
But Osha rules do allow for it.

928
00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:37.940
Jesus Christ it putting on 20 pounds and wearing a wig is brave.

929
00:56:37.941 --> 00:56:42.440
What the fuck is that?
Huh?
You can't die acting canyon.

930
00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:47.120
Well,
I guess you can't
that there's ways to die as an actor,
right?

931
00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:49.340
The fake gun on set turns out it's got,
you know,

932
00:56:49.341 --> 00:56:52.370
you put it up to your head is that they'd be fucking bring a helicopter.

933
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.640
People have died on set.
So no disrespect to them.

934
00:56:56.540 --> 00:57:00.620
29 minutes a Yammer inbuilt Jesus fucking Christ.
You know,

935
00:57:00.621 --> 00:57:04.460
some days the podcast is hard.
Other days it's easy.

936
00:57:04.461 --> 00:57:06.860
But I just want to say to everybody who listens

937
00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:12.570
because you dare to download idea to try

938
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:42.500
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

939
00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:08.730
<v 3>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

940
00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:11.790
September 27th,

941
00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:16.530
2010 and a and it is still Monday for all you fucking assholes giving me shit

942
00:58:16.531 --> 00:58:19.830
saying I haven't.
You haven't posted a podcast.
What the fuck's going on?

943
00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:24.810
It's still Monday.
It's still Monday morning.
Where I,
where I live.

944
00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:27.840
It's not my fault.
I live,
I live at the end of the street.

945
00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:33.850
You know I live at the end of the fucking street when it comes to the world,

946
00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:38.880
you realize that shit other than Hawaii,
you know,

947
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:42.960
and maybe a Amelia Earhart's fucking great,
great grandson

948
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:48.060
or grandson at this point.
Ryan be grandson.
She crashed,
made it to an island.

949
00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:51.820
Fucks him God Damn Aborigine,
right?

950
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:55.770
Bang.
Solitude ends up having a fucking baby.

951
00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:58.980
Some fucking group of people that we haven't figured out that they lived there

952
00:58:58.981 --> 00:59:00.180
yet so we could exploit them,

953
00:59:00.181 --> 00:59:03.690
destroy their goddamn culture and she put up a fucking best buy.

954
00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:07.920
You know,
maybe,
maybe those are the only people who don't bitch at me.

955
00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:12.840
It is to Monday morning podcast.
It's nine 43 Monday fucking morning.
Okay.

956
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:17.880
Syriza Monday morning podcast or write or write their epic fail guy who sent me

957
00:59:18.061 --> 00:59:22.070
the email.
Ah,
you want to see an epic fail?
Why don't you look up when

958
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:27.010
<v 1>you're shaving next time,
buddy.
All right,</v>

959
00:59:27.011 --> 00:59:30.880
I'm going to fucking mood.
I am in a mood today because my computer sucks.

960
00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:35.870
Server not found.
What does that even mean?
What the F,

961
00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:40.190
How am I offline?
Ah,
Jesus.

962
00:59:40.191 --> 00:59:43.430
Now you guys are going to see what kind of skills I really fucking have

963
00:59:43.431 --> 00:59:48.010
considering I'm not even online right now.
They just took away my,

964
00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:52.070
my little security blanket.
Um,
hey,
somebody sent me a,
a,

965
00:59:52.071 --> 00:59:56.900
an email talking about irony.
Um,
you know,
the Segway,

966
00:59:58.270 --> 00:59:58.551
you know,

967
00:59:58.551 --> 01:00:01.310
that little two wheeled thing where you lean forward and it goes forward and

968
01:00:01.311 --> 01:00:04.280
then you lean back and then it stops.
It's something like that.
Evidently it's,

969
01:00:04.281 --> 01:00:06.590
it's,
you know,
it's a,
you know,

970
01:00:06.591 --> 01:00:09.470
one of those devices they made because I think that they felt like people

971
01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:12.110
weren't fat enough and if there's any way,

972
01:00:12.111 --> 01:00:15.920
if we could just eliminate all walking.
Uh,
anyways,
this,

973
01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:19.640
the segway owner died,
uh,

974
01:00:19.641 --> 01:00:23.510
after falling off a river cliff riding a segway.

975
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:32.660
I know it's not a nice thing to do to laugh at someone who dies.

976
01:00:32.661 --> 01:00:36.080
I know that they have family saw him.
Um,
you know,
well,
what the fuck

977
01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:40.670
and just the whole name of its segue.
You know,

978
01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:44.900
the segue brought him from this life into the afterlife.
That was the segue.

979
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:49.280
Jesus Christ.
I want,
what was he thinking on that fall?

980
01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.290
<v 3>I showed her whoa.</v>

981
01:00:56.650 --> 01:01:01.510
Oh,
and you know,
he was wearing those fucking shoes with the tassels.
You know,

982
01:01:01.511 --> 01:01:04.940
those ones that rich people,
where are those fucking loafers?
You know,

983
01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:09.250
they always wear the loafers without socks and they got their khaki shorts and

984
01:01:09.251 --> 01:01:13.810
some sort of yachting polo shirt.
My buddy who was dressed like that,

985
01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:15.700
he's probably on his cell phone.

986
01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:20.380
Maybe he was texting while he had another one up against his chubby rich cheek

987
01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:25.570
from all those fucking Hams east to eat at that long dining room table.
Hey,

988
01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.920
I'm going to take out my segue.

989
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:29.320
Gulf oil is spin around the fucking river that we bought

990
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:39.140
and you know,
would be fucking hilarious as if he,
when he went over the cliff,

991
01:01:39.141 --> 01:01:42.950
I bet he had a death grip.
You ever hear of what a death grip is?
Well,

992
01:01:42.951 --> 01:01:46.970
I'm going to tell you,
even without the Internet sometimes,
uh,
when,
uh,

993
01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:49.080
when you're,
you're,
when you're in a,

994
01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:52.820
in a situation where you're going to die and I think it involves falling,

995
01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:59.080
your body has what's known as a death grip and it's,

996
01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:04.580
you just hang on so fucking tight.
Like I saw this one time,
it was basically,

997
01:02:04.581 --> 01:02:08.080
there was those two guys flying in a plane.
Two guys flying into a plane,

998
01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:12.230
walk into a bar.
The bartender says,
Hey,
you,
you can't fucking park that in here.

999
01:02:12.231 --> 01:02:15.650
What's the deal?
Two guys a flying this fucking plane,
right?

1000
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:20.040
And uh,
the rear aft,

1001
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.930
<v 1>I believe they say was a,</v>

1002
01:02:21.931 --> 01:02:25.140
was making some noise and they thought it might be a little bit of jar.

1003
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:27.520
So the copilot goes,
I'm going to go,

1004
01:02:27.521 --> 01:02:32.521
but I'm going to get up and I'm going to secure the door in the after section of

1005
01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:35.580
the airplane.
So the other guy says,
yeah,

1006
01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.930
I'm going to sit up here with my fucking seat belt on.
You go over there and uh,

1007
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.370
learn about air pressure.

1008
01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.830
So this fucking dude goes back and he,

1009
01:02:46.831 --> 01:02:51.831
and in his efforts to secure the door aft of the airplane and the half section

1010
01:02:52.321 --> 01:02:55.490
of the airplane,
we need Augie to take your feet.
Please.

1011
01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:01.650
We haven't come to a full stop at the jet way yet.
Shout out you can't.
Um,

1012
01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.290
<v 2>yeah,</v>

1013
01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:05.300
<v 1>he goes back there and</v>

1014
01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:06.880
<v 2>okay.</v>

1015
01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:10.690
<v 1>I Dunno.
He went to try to shut it and the fucking door pops open.</v>

1016
01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:14.020
This is one of these small Cessna planes.
You know when you open the door,

1017
01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:17.860
like the stairs are on the inside of the door and you plop it down and then he

1018
01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:22.030
come down.
If some Hor puts a lei around your neck,
one of those planes,

1019
01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:25.930
then you go surfing and get fucking hit by a Tki or whatever,

1020
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.823
one of those planes.

1021
01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:32.070
So the door pops open and this guy somehow as he goes to fall out,

1022
01:03:33.071 --> 01:03:36.370
he's falling out backwards.
Or maybe he grabbed the railing or whatever.

1023
01:03:36.371 --> 01:03:39.220
All I know is this fucking dude

1024
01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:42.060
went out the plane.

1025
01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:48.060
So the pilots upfront going,
holy fuck,
my friend just died.

1026
01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:52.710
So now he's got to land the plane,
which isn't a problem,

1027
01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:56.640
but that the problem is is that the door was ajar.
The door aft,

1028
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:59.400
the APP section of the airplane is now a jar and he's wondering is it going to

1029
01:03:59.401 --> 01:04:00.990
drag?
Long story short,

1030
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:06.480
he fucking lands the plane and when he gets out of the plane or walks to the

1031
01:04:06.481 --> 01:04:07.314
back of the plane,

1032
01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:14.480
he sees the copilot laying like head at the bottom of the stairs,

1033
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:20.360
feet like still in the plane and his hands gripping the fucking skinny little

1034
01:04:21.751 --> 01:04:22.584
banisters.

1035
01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:28.050
So he tries to get this guy to let go and the guy is in like this catatonic

1036
01:04:28.051 --> 01:04:31.140
state and the fucking announcer,

1037
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:35.730
the host of the show was saying it took the fucking fire department 20 minutes

1038
01:04:35.731 --> 01:04:40.731
to pry this guys fingers off of the Goddamn banister things because he had

1039
01:04:40.891 --> 01:04:42.330
what's known as a death grip.

1040
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.991
I mean,

1041
01:04:45.991 --> 01:04:50.991
do you realize just mentally where you go in that moment where your brain

1042
01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:57.140
overrides everything other than keeping your heart beating and your respiratory

1043
01:04:57.481 --> 01:04:58.081
system going,

1044
01:04:58.081 --> 01:05:03.081
the only thing your brain is saying is don't fucking let go grab on to that

1045
01:05:03.361 --> 01:05:07.330
Shit.
It's just,
it's not even saying,
hang on,

1046
01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:11.650
I think it's just white noise.
It says,
hang on,

1047
01:05:11.651 --> 01:05:13.510
you have that thought and then it's going

1048
01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:18.190
nonstop until

1049
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:22.420
<v 3>you gradually come out of it.
And you look at a dike upside down.</v>

1050
01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:28.140
Firefighters face that stupid mustache and the smell of Chili cause he cooks in

1051
01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:31.240
a firehouse telling you it's okay to let go now.

1052
01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:33.760
So with that long fucking story,

1053
01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:36.880
I bet this fat son of a bitch had a death grip on his segway,

1054
01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:38.290
went right to the bottom of the river.

1055
01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:43.990
<v 7>Ah,</v>

1056
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:45.190
<v 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1057
01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.340
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1058
01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:50.670
<v 3>You know what kills me is that thing was completely fucking useless.</v>

1059
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:52.000
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1060
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.480
<v 3>Completely useless.
I don't understand what,</v>

1061
01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:57.970
what purpose it served

1062
01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:02.970
and that guy made he,
he became a billionaire.

1063
01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:06.180
The problem was is that they were 10 grand because you know,

1064
01:06:06.181 --> 01:06:09.720
God damn well if those fucking things were 500 bucks,

1065
01:06:09.721 --> 01:06:11.700
everyone would have one like a fucking iPod.

1066
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:14.670
We would just be going down the street

1067
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.370
looking like the beginning of one of those star wars movies.

1068
01:06:18.371 --> 01:06:21.010
You know where they have all the,
uh,
what does that,

1069
01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:24.310
what does that computer technology that they always use that ruins every fucking

1070
01:06:24.311 --> 01:06:25.300
movie.
That's what it looked like.

1071
01:06:25.301 --> 01:06:28.240
It looked like that computer technology that I don't know the name of and I

1072
01:06:28.241 --> 01:06:30.820
can't even tell you what it is cause my fucking internet isn't working.

1073
01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.493
So anyways,

1074
01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:38.370
the body of 62 year old James Helston Heselton and a segway personnel

1075
01:06:41.051 --> 01:06:41.920
transporter

1076
01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:47.730
were found in the river wharf.
I don't know what the fuck you said.

1077
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.960
And he was pronounced dead at the same,

1078
01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:54.640
I'm sure he was with his fucking leg sticking up out of that river mud.

1079
01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:02.800
He might,
I bet he hit terminal velocity one in there like a fucking media.

1080
01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.730
There's probably some conspiracy theorists trying to say it was actually a

1081
01:07:05.731 --> 01:07:09.720
flying saucer and that just covering it up and they actually killed this guy.

1082
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:11.783
Um,

1083
01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:17.540
police said a witness had reported seeing a man fall Sunday over a 30 foot drop

1084
01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:21.540
into the river near Boston spa,

1085
01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:26.070
140 miles north of London.
The incident is not,

1086
01:07:26.071 --> 01:07:28.650
the bleed is not believed to be suspicious.

1087
01:07:28.651 --> 01:07:33.060
Police said is it believed to be ridiculous.
I would've loved to been there.

1088
01:07:33.061 --> 01:07:35.100
Listen to those cops making those fucking jokes.

1089
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.970
Just the awkward silence and then somebody fucking kills it with a joke.

1090
01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:39.893
It had to be something.

1091
01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:41.580
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1092
01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.870
<v 3>Uh,
that I can't think of right now.
You guys want to write a gel for that?</v>

1093
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:48.020
I'll read them next week.
The issue that's your,
that's your homework assignment.

1094
01:07:48.021 --> 01:07:49.970
What did the fucking London police say?

1095
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:54.560
The first guy who made the joke about the segway guy who went fucking 200

1096
01:07:54.561 --> 01:07:58.220
something miles an hour into the bottom of a river bed with his own fucking

1097
01:07:58.221 --> 01:07:59.870
invention.
Has that ever happened before?

1098
01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:06.410
Has the weight of any great inventors invention ever.

1099
01:08:06.961 --> 01:08:10.430
Just sent them,
I guess a plane maybe.

1100
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:12.410
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1101
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:17.060
<v 3>I mean,
that's some Frankincense Frankenstein Shit,
right?
I made you</v>

1102
01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:23.120
really isn't good segues not alive.
Does anybody ever written a segway?

1103
01:08:23.121 --> 01:08:27.290
Now that I'm shitting all over?
See a,
the battery powered Segue,

1104
01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:30.500
which is stabilized by,
by gyro scopes,

1105
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:33.110
was invented by Dean Kamen,

1106
01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:37.220
who founded the company in 1999 wait a minute.

1107
01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:39.533
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1108
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:43.220
<v 3>Oh,
it's just a segue owner.
I thought this was the guy who fucking invented it.</v>

1109
01:08:43.221 --> 01:08:47.420
My fault.
Oh,

1110
01:08:47.421 --> 01:08:51.710
he's just a wealthy businessman.
Jesus Christ.
Isn't that classic?

1111
01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:54.800
Make the fucking have half the God damn information.
Oh,

1112
01:08:54.801 --> 01:08:56.600
so it's not the guy who invented the fucking thing.

1113
01:08:56.601 --> 01:09:00.860
It's just some rich bassier to had one.
It didn't want to walk anymore.
He's like,

1114
01:09:00.861 --> 01:09:02.210
actually it looks like a hot shit.
You know,

1115
01:09:02.211 --> 01:09:06.260
like you drank some scotch and could tell a story.
Jesus Christ.

1116
01:09:06.261 --> 01:09:07.310
Now I'm starting to feel bad.

1117
01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:12.760
Little Fuck is Dean Cayman founder of the company in 1999.

1118
01:09:12.761 --> 01:09:16.570
The unique transporter relies on electricity to recharge his batteries and

1119
01:09:16.571 --> 01:09:19.000
travels or speeds up to 12 and a half miles an hour.

1120
01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.073
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1121
01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:26.330
<v 3>I guess it's far more protective of the environment than other scooters and</v>

1122
01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:30.530
automobiles.
The company says,
well,
Jesus Christ is a big fucking red flag.

1123
01:09:30.531 --> 01:09:33.720
According to us,
our products,
the best climbing,

1124
01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:36.880
it's 11 times more efficient than the average American car.
Yeah.

1125
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:41.450
And fucking 30 times slower.
You know what,

1126
01:09:41.451 --> 01:09:46.040
Fuck Dean came in.
All right.
If you learn anything from this week's podcast,

1127
01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:50.240
Fuck Dean Cayman.
Alright.
So anyways,
I just got back from Nashville,
Tennessee,

1128
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:54.180
Nashville,
fucking Tanis Shea.
And um,

1129
01:09:54.230 --> 01:09:56.060
I had a great God damn time out there.

1130
01:09:56.061 --> 01:10:01.061
I saw way more people out at my shows then the last time.

1131
01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:04.130
Um,
so let it go,

1132
01:10:04.131 --> 01:10:06.630
So I want to thank everybody who came out because a,

1133

Checkout DM getting Cox do a book and show problem is is I don't fucking talk.

1138
01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:28.730
Lock this so none of the other fuckers show up.

1139
01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:34.550
You guys don't fucking show up cause I'm not standing on stage with a camouflage

1140
01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:38.960
buttoned down shirt
and a pair of murders,

1141
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:40.130
whatever the fuck you call them,

1142
01:10:40.131 --> 01:10:45.131
rubber boots you wear when you go out stomping around in the fucking mud.

1143
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:51.260
I'm actually jealous of your ability to hunt.
Got a God damn animal.
Fix it.

1144
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:52.850
No where to shoot it.
Right?

1145
01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.610
I would do the south if you mother fuckers would show up.

1146
01:10:55.611 --> 01:10:59.930
I have a great idea for a tour.
I have a great idea for a tour.

1147
01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:01.820
All right.

1148
01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:06.050
Playing different venues and it involves me going to some of my favorite teams

1149
01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:07.340
in the SCC.

1150
01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.530
For those of you who are only kind of like NFL football field,

1151
01:11:12.531 --> 01:11:15.210
like Cuba could become a bigger football fan.

1152
01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:19.590
I'm telling you don't sleep on college football.
Um,

1153
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:23.100
it's absolute insanity.
Like at this point,

1154
01:11:23.101 --> 01:11:27.870
just about every stadium holds at least 80 to 100,000 people and it's fucking

1155
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.730
packed.
Every goddamn one.
I have a goal.

1156
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:34.920
I would go see any team in the SCC except for that Mississippi one where it's

1157
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:36.780
80,000 people with cowbells.

1158
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:42.240
I have no desire to go into that fucking environment.

1159
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:45.360
I think I really,
I'm really not into the noisemakers.

1160
01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:50.280
That's why I don't work New Year's eve anymore.
You know,
all the,

1161
01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:54.840
all the women coming out there and the with dead drunk boyfriends and they got

1162
01:11:54.841 --> 01:11:59.130
that great Gatsby JP Morgan fucking hat on except it's plastic.

1163
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.820
Oh,
why would you want s?
I mean,

1164
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:07.850
is there anything more annoying than those little horns that people blow on new

1165
01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:10.173
years?

1166
01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:11.213
<v 2>Hey,</v>

1167
01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.590
<v 3>do you remember Jim Carrey?
Dumb and dumber and he goes,</v>

1168
01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:21.550
you want to hear the most annoying voice ever?
And that's what he sounded like.

1169
01:12:21.551 --> 01:12:24.130
And that's what it was.
So fucking funny to me because when he did that,

1170
01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:26.470
aside from the hilarious look on his face,

1171
01:12:26.471 --> 01:12:31.471
it immediately reminded me of standing on stage after I've done my set and I'm

1172
01:12:32.591 --> 01:12:35.550
counting down.
Billy might doing the countdown you might doing.

1173
01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.460
You mean you mind starting your New Year that way,
standing on stage.

1174
01:12:39.850 --> 01:12:41.560
Go a tad nine.

1175
01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.660
You know what,
I would,
I would mind doing that.

1176
01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:54.280
I resent this entire fucking thing.
And the worst was whenever you do the,
uh,

1177
01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:59.740
um,
when you play a shitty club that doesn't know what the fuck they doing,

1178
01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:04.810
the classic move that they make is they hand out the noisemakers before the

1179
01:13:04.811 --> 01:13:07.240
show.
Uh,
which,
you know,

1180
01:13:07.241 --> 01:13:10.240
I don't even need to get into the details of why that's so fucking horrific.

1181
01:13:10.241 --> 01:13:15.241
But I remember a long time ago I was working Nick's comedy stop and Boston and

1182
01:13:17.951 --> 01:13:18.550
uh,

1183
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:23.550
Wbz the local fucking station there wanted to shoot something for New Year's eve

1184
01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:25.510
and we were shooting it in November.

1185
01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:31.500
So they handed out all the noise makers before any of us went up on stage.

1186
01:13:32.050 --> 01:13:36.280
I remember there was this a comedian,
Chris Edo,
and I had no idea,

1187
01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:40.090
you know,
I was so new,
I had no idea that that was going to be a problem.

1188
01:13:40.091 --> 01:13:44.800
And I just remembered when I saw the look on this seasoned headliner,

1189
01:13:44.801 --> 01:13:49.570
Chris Idos face the look of panic on his face.

1190
01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:53.560
And He came walking into the club.
And the second he heard of this look,

1191
01:13:53.561 --> 01:13:56.230
I had never seen on his face because he's always,
you know,
relax dude.

1192
01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:59.460
And he's going,
what?
Why do they have noise makers who,

1193
01:13:59.461 --> 01:14:00.294
he ended up the noisemakers.

1194
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:04.030
He went right up to the person who ran the shit and Kudos to him,

1195
01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:08.320
got them to walk around the entire room and collect all the fucking noise makers

1196
01:14:08.321 --> 01:14:09.280
before we did the show,

1197
01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:14.490
which now I realize the brilliance of that move because we were going to go on

1198
01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:19.711
television and we would have bombed with in the background during our entire

1199
01:14:19.811 --> 01:14:22.990
fucking sets.
That was a long way to go.
But anyways,

1200
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:28.900
so what I'm saying is,
uh,
I appreciate everybody coming down.

1201
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:32.620
Hang on one second.
Did I just fucking blow this whole thing?

1202
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:38.950
All right.
So evidently I didn't fuck it up.
I thought I'm,
I'm glad I didn't,

1203
01:14:38.951 --> 01:14:42.060
but I just saw this,
this plug was sticking way out.
Now how to fucking,

1204
01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:44.050
I'd be sticking out that far and it doesn't matter.

1205
01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.650
What is the purpose of having it in there.
See that,

1206
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:51.560
look at me blaming technology rather than myself.
Um,
anyway,

1207
01:14:51.561 --> 01:14:54.730
so that was the new year story.
Shut up.

1208
01:14:54.731 --> 01:14:56.200
I'm going to pick up the ball and run with it.

1209
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:58.600
So I was talking about as a college football,

1210
01:14:58.601 --> 01:15:00.220
if you want to get into college football,
I'm telling you,

1211
01:15:00.221 --> 01:15:04.390
watch the SCC for my money.
That's where it's at.
I fucking,
uh,

1212
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:07.750
I love like every Goddamn team in there except for like Vanderbilt,

1213
01:15:07.751 --> 01:15:09.700
like teams that just suck every year.
But,
uh,

1214
01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:15.220
and I was tempted when I was in Nashville to drive the two and a half hours or

1215
01:15:15.221 --> 01:15:18.820
whatever,
just to go see the first,
like I dunno,

1216
01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:22.150
halfway through the third quarter of the Tennessee game.

1217
01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:24.450
Cause I've always wanted to go to a game out there,
you know,

1218
01:15:24.451 --> 01:15:25.780
with that Purina cat chow,

1219
01:15:25.781 --> 01:15:29.650
fucking look an end zone and a 100,000 people going absolutely insane.

1220
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:34.630
Um,
but,
um,
I dunno,
I just,
my show is at seven,

1221
01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:37.180
then I was going to have to leave and I would have been fucking hammered.

1222
01:15:37.181 --> 01:15:40.840
I know I would've drank and I would've been driving across the 40,

1223
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:46.000
40 fucking west going back to fucking Nashville.
Um,

1224
01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:51.850
so anyways,
uh,
let's talk a little NFL football,
shall we?

1225
01:15:52.570 --> 01:15:55.390
Um,
another awesome week of football and a,

1226
01:15:55.391 --> 01:15:57.160
this week I actually gambled a little bit.

1227
01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:00.850
I got a little running thing going with the,
another buddy of mine,

1228
01:16:00.851 --> 01:16:02.860
another comic Buddy of mine were rob.
We're basically,

1229
01:16:02.861 --> 01:16:06.940
we're picking three games each week and you've got to bet against a spread.

1230
01:16:06.941 --> 01:16:11.620
And I went,
uh,
what did I go?
I think I went,
whoa.
I went one and two,

1231
01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:15.700
but if I teased him,
I would have won.
I think I would have,

1232
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:18.430
this is what I had,
uh,
the team I won,

1233
01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:21.370
I had the bills getting 14 and a half,

1234
01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:25.900
which I almost fucking lost.
But,
uh,
I just,
I hate the Patriots.

1235
01:16:25.901 --> 01:16:28.450
Defense is fucking horrific.
You know,

1236
01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:32.950
we let up a ton of yards against the bangles.
We let up.
Like,

1237
01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:37.510
I can't remember that Joe was a jets game.
Was it 30?
Was it over 30?

1238
01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:38.620
Is it 38?

1239
01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:42.760
I can't fucking remember when we got our asses kicked a fucking defense looked

1240
01:16:42.761 --> 01:16:46.600
horrible in that game and our deep,
we just let up 30 points to the bills.

1241
01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:52.450
So sad to say Patriot fans,
myself included.
I see us going,

1242
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:56.350
like if this trend continues at best,

1243
01:16:56.351 --> 01:16:59.170
I think maybe we're a nine and 17 and a,

1244
01:16:59.171 --> 01:17:03.130
I was joking with my buddy watching the patriots.
Uh,

1245
01:17:04.190 --> 01:17:06.760
you know,
we look like we look like a fucking,

1246
01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:12.050
like a 2000 corvette.
That's the only way to describe it.

1247
01:17:12.051 --> 01:17:16.430
You know what I mean?
Where it can still fucking go zero to 60 really fast.

1248
01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:20.180
But it has a little of that get got,
got,
get,
got,
got,
got,
got,
got fucking sound.

1249
01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:23.630
You know,
still a corvette.
But you know,
it's been beat on a little bit.

1250
01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.530
I Dunno,
I don't even know how to explain it.
It's just like,

1251
01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:29.540
we seem to have a lot of the tools,

1252
01:17:29.541 --> 01:17:34.010
but like we have no fucking pass rush,
great against the rabbit.

1253
01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:39.560
And uh,
I don't know that one play where,

1254
01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:43.880
I mean,
who the first of all,
who the fuck is the bill's quarterback?

1255
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:45.500
That's what really scared me.
You know what I mean?

1256
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.240
Some people just have a look in their face.

1257
01:17:47.241 --> 01:17:50.600
They look like a quarterback and then I'll do other people look like they work

1258
01:17:50.601 --> 01:17:54.290
at home depot and whatever the fuck that guy's name was.
Fitzgerald.

1259
01:17:54.291 --> 01:17:57.350
I don't know what his gut guys,
Goddamn name.
I was watching it at a sports bar.

1260
01:17:57.351 --> 01:18:00.470
What's the first half in,
uh,
in Nashville.

1261
01:18:00.471 --> 01:18:03.440
And they had the sound down because everyone was watching obviously the titans

1262
01:18:03.441 --> 01:18:06.530
game cause I was in Tennessee and um,

1263
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:11.210
I just kept looking at that guy's face in his red fucking beard.

1264
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:15.830
And I was just like,
is that Eric Hippel?
Who,

1265
01:18:15.831 --> 01:18:18.590
who the fuck is that?
And he was just,

1266
01:18:18.591 --> 01:18:22.640
he was just going right down the goddamn field against us.
So,
uh,
I don't know.

1267
01:18:22.641 --> 01:18:25.730
This is this weird part of the year where a few,
if you gamble,

1268
01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.600
because you're trying to figure out,
you know,

1269
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:34.040
what your team is,
which is really,
if you had any brains,

1270
01:18:34.041 --> 01:18:37.430
you wouldn't gamble for like the first six weeks of the season until you got

1271
01:18:37.431 --> 01:18:39.830
some sort of consistency.
Right.

1272
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:42.440
Because as much as I talk shit about the jets,

1273
01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.950
it's like they kicked the shit out of the Patriots.
You start taking,

1274
01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:47.390
well wait a minute,
maybe all this talking is for real.

1275
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:50.470
But then it's like you kicked the shit out of a team that

1276
01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:51.900
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1277
01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:55.840
<v 3>that gave up 30 points to the bills,
you know?</v>

1278
01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:57.190
And then you go down to the dolphins,

1279
01:18:57.191 --> 01:19:01.750
you played the dolphins and the dolphins have no fucking offense to speak of.

1280
01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.980
And it,
you basically couldn't put them away until the final fucking 20 seconds.

1281
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.220
If that guy had a fucking God damn arm,
that would've been it,
you know?
Well,
no,

1282
01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:14.020
you can't say that cause I needed a two point conversion.
But,
um,

1283
01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:16.780
I dunno.
So,
okay,

1284
01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:21.840
well let me finish with the bets I had then I had the fucking lions getting 13

1285
01:19:22.541 --> 01:19:23.860
and a half.
I lost that one.

1286
01:19:25.150 --> 01:19:29.080
And then I had the saints given three and a half.
I went against my,
uh,

1287
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:32.890
my theory about divisional rivalries and,
uh,

1288
01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.570
I was gonna bet the dolphins,

1289
01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:37.720
but I just didn't like them given three to the jets,

1290
01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:41.020
just cause the jets have a great,
uh,
a great defense.

1291
01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:45.370
And I didn't like the fact that the dolphins had no offense.

1292
01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:50.110
So I stayed away from that one.
And if I had to,
you know what it was,

1293
01:19:50.111 --> 01:19:53.320
I think I was leaning towards taking the jets with the points and I just

1294
01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:55.460
couldn't fucking get myself to,

1295
01:19:55.810 --> 01:19:58.780
then I will be rooting for the jets and I just couldn't get myself to do it.

1296
01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.120
So having said all that,

1297
01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:04.510
the team that I think right now,

1298
01:20:04.511 --> 01:20:06.970
it looks the best to me is the Pittsburgh Steelers.

1299
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:11.940
They have three and oh with the third stinked third string quarterback and their

1300
01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:14.790
defense looks fucking unbelievable.
And that they,

1301
01:20:14.791 --> 01:20:18.030
like they say that's what wins championships.
All right.

1302
01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:20.860
And I got a couple of emails,
some jets fans going,

1303
01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:23.730
you still going to keep hating on the jets,
you know,
typical jet fans,

1304
01:20:23.731 --> 01:20:27.570
they're all excited because they're two in one,
three games into the season.

1305
01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:32.580
Right?
And all fat boy wrote on that bus,
they're going to the super bowl.
Um,

1306
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:34.140
he says,
I know you hate the jets,

1307
01:20:34.141 --> 01:20:38.040
but are you going to let that cloud your objectivity and pick the jets to lose

1308
01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:40.880
for the next 13 weeks?
No,
I'm not.
And yet,

1309
01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:43.980
and that's actually a fair question because I hate New York teams to such a

1310
01:20:43.981 --> 01:20:48.390
level that it will cloud my objectivity,
but uh,
I wouldn't,
uh,

1311
01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:52.710
I wouldn't get too excited there buddy.
Boy,
you guys have,
I mean,

1312
01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:54.510
the only team I think that you really played,

1313
01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:59.400
dad had a serious like playoff defense was the ravens and they held you to like

1314
01:20:59.401 --> 01:21:03.570
nine points.
So,
you know,
I'm sure you're excited about beating the patriots,

1315
01:21:03.571 --> 01:21:05.600
but be honest with yourself.
True football fans.

1316
01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:08.320
The fact that the team that you kicked the shit out of just let up 30 points to

1317
01:21:08.321 --> 01:21:11.310
the Goddamn jet.
I have bills.
I mean,
do you think jets,

1318
01:21:11.311 --> 01:21:12.660
do you guys think that you're going to do that?

1319
01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.140
I'm actually going to that game by the way,
the bills,
jets game.

1320
01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:20.280
I am going to that game because I'm doing a theater in Buffalo,

1321
01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:24.000
the Saturday night right before the game and I'm going to hang out.

1322
01:21:24.001 --> 01:21:27.570
I'm going to go there and with all my heart I'm going to root against the jets

1323
01:21:27.571 --> 01:21:30.990
even though I know the bills are going to fucking lose.
Um,

1324
01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.990
yeah.
So anyways,
is that all boring to people who aren't into fucking sports?

1325
01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:40.100
So I still,
I would say at this point I would say the two top contenders,

1326
01:21:40.130 --> 01:21:43.160
I would say the Steelers too early to say the chiefs,

1327
01:21:43.161 --> 01:21:48.161
whether they're for real or not and just cause the cults seem to win 13 games

1328
01:21:48.261 --> 01:21:50.720
every year,
but they always blow it in the fucking playoffs.

1329
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:53.330
But the best thing that jets have going for them,

1330
01:21:53.331 --> 01:21:56.600
I seriously think is the fact that Sanchez hasn't thrown an interception yet.

1331
01:21:56.990 --> 01:22:00.020
And yes,
I hope that jinx is him into throwing five next week.

1332
01:22:00.021 --> 01:22:04.640
But if he's got to play like that,
you know,
uh,
I dunno,

1333
01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:08.240
I just did it.
You're not a fucking Superbowl team.
Fuck the jets.
All right,

1334
01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:11.060
let's get to some youtube videos.
No,

1335
01:22:11.061 --> 01:22:13.940
you know what I gotta I gotta tell you something that's been fucking bugging the

1336
01:22:13.941 --> 01:22:14.774
shit out of me.

1337
01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:16.460
<v 9>Okay?</v>

1338
01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:20.190
<v 3>You have to have a friend.
You just fucking outgrow them.
You know what I mean?</v>

1339
01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:26.440
I don't even want to get into this shit.
You just fucking,
you just,
it's like,

1340
01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:29.380
you know,
you're chugging along,
you're doing your shit,

1341
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:32.350
you'll life's going good and their life isn't going good.

1342
01:22:33.610 --> 01:22:37.000
And then eventually what that ends up happening is all of a sudden they just

1343
01:22:37.001 --> 01:22:41.350
start making little snide remarks about your life,
you know?

1344
01:22:41.351 --> 01:22:44.300
And then he got to sit there and go,
wow,
that was fucking weird.
That,
and I do it.

1345
01:22:44.301 --> 01:22:46.390
I was just fucking around.
I'm sorry man,
I'm fucking,

1346
01:22:46.391 --> 01:22:49.820
they always end up apologizing.
Nah,
I'm just going through some shit and blah,

1347
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:53.560
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And then it's just kind of becomes more and more and more.
I,

1348
01:22:53.561 --> 01:22:57.700
I,
you know,
I got this fucking buddy of mine and it's just like,
you know,

1349
01:22:57.701 --> 01:23:00.130
he's one of these fucking guys says,
life is all fucked up.

1350
01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:03.760
Just think of every dumb thing that you could do.

1351
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:07.750
Every dumb thing that you could do to fuck up your life.
You know,

1352
01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:11.290
smoking weed,
gambling,

1353
01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:13.333
<v 7>uh,
you know,</v>

1354
01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:19.280
<v 3>being high at work,
flunking drug tests,</v>

1355
01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:24.770
losing jobs,
getting drunk,
falling down,
fucking up your face,

1356
01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:28.990
that type of shit,
that type of Shit,
right?

1357
01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:33.700
One of those fucking guys calls you up with a crisis every six fucking weeks.

1358
01:23:33.701 --> 01:23:37.840
Dude,
you'd have to believe with him.
It's never their fault.

1359
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:40.330
One of those fucking guys where it's just like,
all right,
you know,

1360
01:23:40.331 --> 01:23:42.820
you choose to live your life that way.
That's how you live your life.

1361
01:23:42.821 --> 01:23:46.300
But then they fucking come in and make snide remarks at you and then you want to

1362
01:23:46.301 --> 01:23:48.880
come back and just fucking unload on him.

1363
01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:50.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1364
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:53.210
<v 3>You know,
it'd be like,
dude,</v>

1365
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:57.560
you're fucking a drug test working at a goddamn fruit stand.
You fucking loser.

1366
01:23:58.010 --> 01:24:01.300
You know,
why don't you come home and blow some more fucking weed smoker?

1367
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:05.450
Do your families face as you give them,
you know,
$3 for the fucking week.

1368
01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:09.950
You know,
that's what you want to say,
but you don't,

1369
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:16.040
you wait til your podcast.
Yeah man.

1370
01:24:16.041 --> 01:24:21.010
It's just like,
ah,
that's one of those,
that's one of those things you guys,

1371
01:24:21.210 --> 01:24:22.520
do you guys have any stories like that?

1372
01:24:22.521 --> 01:24:25.190
Cause I really don't want to talk any more about this,
but I know you do.
Come on.

1373
01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:27.260
Some of you guys out there,
you're doing well,
right?

1374
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:31.940
Maybe somebody you were friends with when you were both struggling with isn't

1375
01:24:31.941 --> 01:24:36.230
doing well yet.
All right.
But they're so busy focusing on,
on,

1376
01:24:36.231 --> 01:24:39.380
on what you're doing that uh,
you know,

1377
01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.360
they start giving you this roundabout shit.

1378
01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:46.100
<v 7>Oh my God,
it's fucking dude</v>

1379
01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:50.490
<v 3>saw my special,
right.
At least me,
this fucked up message.</v>

1380
01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:57.180
Right?
And then just click hangs up and add alcohol and back for like,

1381
01:24:57.181 --> 01:25:01.770
you know,
10 days or whatever week or so.
I call the dude up.
I'm like,

1382
01:25:01.771 --> 01:25:04.500
listen to it.
Why?
What the fuck was it?
That message,
you know,

1383
01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:10.690
it's like if you're not happy with your own life,
fix your life.
The fuck.

1384
01:25:10.691 --> 01:25:14.270
He taken it out on me for,
you know,
and then he,

1385
01:25:14.271 --> 01:25:18.590
and then he texted me back some bullshit about a dude.
I was just joking.

1386
01:25:18.591 --> 01:25:20.600
Don't be so insecure,
you know?

1387
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:24.800
And it's just a really,
is that,
is that what the fuck?

1388
01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:27.110
And then I go to column and his phone is off

1389
01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:30.053
<v 7>fucking idiot.</v>

1390
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:34.110
<v 3>I'm insecurity or the guy's got to fucking smoke weed all the God damn time.</v>

1391
01:25:34.111 --> 01:25:36.990
Turn your life into a movie because you can't fucking deal.

1392
01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.090
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1393
01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:42.120
<v 3>Looking at the God damn ceiling.
Hey,
you fucking moron.
Anyway,</v>

1394
01:25:42.121 --> 01:25:45.330
so let's plow ahead here.
Plowing ahead,
plowing ahead.

1395
01:25:46.230 --> 01:25:50.860
If you got any fucking stories like that.
This is just getting negative.
Um,

1396
01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.270
let me,
Oh,

1397
01:25:54.271 --> 01:25:58.680
do I want to fucking unload on this guy?
I want to fucking unload on this guy.

1398
01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:03.000
I really do.
And I'm going to say,
I just know I'm going to say shit.

1399
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:06.080
Then that's just going to be the end of it.
And,
uh,
that's why I'm not,

1400
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:09.350
that's why I'm just choosing my world's words very carefully,

1401
01:26:09.650 --> 01:26:12.590
still saying things really conti.
Um,

1402
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:17.060
but I'm not worried about him here in this cause he's too fucking high till even

1403
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:20.120
he doesn't even know how to use a computer,
you know,

1404
01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:25.610
so I basically could go off on whatever.
Send me your stories.
So Cathartic Lee,

1405
01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:30.020
I can fucking,
I in a Cathartic way,
if I'm using that word correctly,

1406
01:26:30.021 --> 01:26:33.230
I can go off on your friends rather than my own.
All right,

1407
01:26:33.231 --> 01:26:37.250
let's get into some advice.
The gas bill section of the week.
Uh,
Bill,

1408
01:26:37.251 --> 01:26:39.120
I'd appreciate it.
Uh,

1409
01:26:39.170 --> 01:26:42.440
if you could give my friend some advice concerning a girl.

1410
01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.590
My friend is in college and works part time at a restaurant as a waiter.

1411
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:46.910
Within the past few weeks,

1412
01:26:46.911 --> 01:26:51.710
they hired a girl to host and bus tables on some of the days he works.

1413
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:55.400
I think you going to say literally this girl was hosting and bussing tables.

1414
01:26:55.401 --> 01:26:58.920
I was just like,
ah,
that's kind of nasty.
Uh,

1415
01:26:58.950 --> 01:27:01.700
I told you guys that story right when I was working for that restaurant that was

1416
01:27:01.701 --> 01:27:05.600
going out of business and at one point I was the grill shift.
I don't know,

1417
01:27:05.601 --> 01:27:09.680
I told this story but I actually worked on a mesquite grill with one of those

1418
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:12.170
top chef's hats on,
glassed in.

1419
01:27:12.171 --> 01:27:17.060
Like I knew what the fuck I was doing and I also bus tables and wash the dishes,

1420
01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:23.360
you know in this like I'd cook the meal and as I was cooking it I would be

1421
01:27:23.361 --> 01:27:27.740
watching other people trying to see if they were done eating and when they were,

1422
01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.590
I would duck down behind the grill,

1423
01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:34.640
take off the hat and my apron and underneath it I had that half a Tuxedo that

1424
01:27:34.641 --> 01:27:38.900
you were in a restaurant that tries to look like it's fancy and I would come out

1425
01:27:38.901 --> 01:27:42.650
there,
my face red from working on the grill,

1426
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.210
I remember being so God damn hot in there.

1427
01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:50.900
I bust the table and then I would go back,
throw out the food,

1428
01:27:50.901 --> 01:27:54.830
scrape off the plates and load up the load and it fucking put it in the

1429
01:27:54.831 --> 01:27:55.664
dishwasher,

1430
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.260
not wash my hands because I didn't have time because I had to run back to make

1431
01:28:00.261 --> 01:28:02.450
sure the medium rare burger didn't become medium.

1432
01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:07.070
That's what I thought you were suggesting there.
Um,

1433
01:28:07.130 --> 01:28:08.960
so keep an eye on the employees.
People.

1434
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:12.350
Make sure there's no double agents at the fucking restaurants you'd go to or you

1435
01:28:12.351 --> 01:28:16.100
do not want to eat their little tip.
All right.
All right.
Here we go.

1436
01:28:16.101 --> 01:28:20.720
Plowing ahead.
Uh,
what the hell,
where are we?
Uh,

1437
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:21.431
they developed,

1438
01:28:21.431 --> 01:28:24.890
they quickly developed a relationship where he would hang out in her dorm

1439
01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:28.640
between classes for hours at a time doing what college kids do.

1440
01:28:28.641 --> 01:28:31.820
I guess he really thought that she was the one.
Uh,

1441
01:28:31.821 --> 01:28:36.500
I tried to tell him to slow down a bit because nothing good comes from obsessing

1442
01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:41.480
in that early pre relationship,
uh,
period.
Anyways,

1443
01:28:41.481 --> 01:28:42.380
a week into it.

1444
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:45.800
She tells him that she's really not looking for a relationship because she

1445
01:28:45.801 --> 01:28:49.250
doesn't want to get tied in with the guy and get distracted from school.

1446
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:53.330
They pretty much agreed to be friends with benefits in parentheses.
He says,

1447
01:28:53.331 --> 01:28:57.740
I hate that term.
Yeah,
they're going to be fuck buddies.
Um,

1448
01:28:57.770 --> 01:28:59.360
sounds reasonable to me.

1449
01:28:59.570 --> 01:29:03.270
Then I guess he overheard something during work or he had called her and this

1450
01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:07.140
other guy answered or something answer the phone.
Anyway,

1451
01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:11.250
he finds out that she's already going out with some other dude,

1452
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:13.680
like a full on relationship.

1453
01:29:13.710 --> 01:29:17.640
So now my friend has to work with this cunt and try to go on like nothing

1454
01:29:17.641 --> 01:29:20.480
happened,
happened.
You know what's great is,

1455
01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:24.450
why am I voice always cracks was cause I fucking scream my act the night before

1456
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:26.520
actually the two nights before.

1457
01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:30.900
So he has to go around and act like nothing happened.
Uh,

1458
01:29:30.901 --> 01:29:31.950
what should he say to her?

1459
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:35.250
I feel bad for him since he would talk on and on about her,

1460
01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:39.840
about this girl every day.
I appreciate the insight bill.
If you read this.
Um,

1461
01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:44.760
all right.
Um,
all right.
What should he say to her?
Nothing.

1462
01:29:46.210 --> 01:29:48.920
You shouldn't say anything.
Uh,

1463
01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:53.300
she's a young girl who doesn't know how to get out of a relationship yet,

1464
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:56.930
or maybe she's afraid to be alone.
I don't know what,
but,
uh,

1465
01:29:56.931 --> 01:29:59.810
what he should do is,
uh,

1466
01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:02.570
he should stop attempting to fucker.

1467
01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:03.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1468
01:30:03.850 --> 01:30:05.530
<v 3>His best move is just to be cool.</v>

1469
01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:09.430
It's going to be hard because he likes her to just be like,
hey,
what's going on?

1470
01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:13.150
And,
uh,
and kind of leave it at that.
And if she comes up like,
well,

1471
01:30:13.151 --> 01:30:15.930
how come you're not talking to me?
No,

1472
01:30:15.970 --> 01:30:20.560
there's something weird what's going on?
And just be like,
look,

1473
01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:23.620
I'm not trying to be a jerk,
but I kind of got wind that you're,

1474
01:30:23.650 --> 01:30:27.040
that you have a boyfriend and a,
so,
you know,

1475
01:30:27.041 --> 01:30:29.080
I don't mess with girls who have boyfriends.
That's all.

1476
01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:32.710
I'm not judging you or anything,
but uh,
yeah.
So,
you know,

1477
01:30:32.711 --> 01:30:36.010
I actually Kinda liked you and uh,
when I found out you had it,

1478
01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:38.080
I guess that's the first thing you should do.
There you go.

1479
01:30:38.290 --> 01:30:39.610
Putting the cart before the horse.

1480
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:41.490
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1481
01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:42.640
<v 3>He should find out.
But I,</v>

1482
01:30:42.641 --> 01:30:46.920
I really wouldn't find out from her find out from someone who kind of knows and

1483
01:30:46.921 --> 01:30:49.800
just be like,
she has a boyfriend.
Right.
And then,

1484
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:53.520
and then when you've clarified that she has a boyfriend,

1485
01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:58.740
then just keep the conversation short.
Hey,
how you doing?
Blah,
blah,

1486
01:30:58.741 --> 01:31:02.640
blah.
And eventually when you don't try to,
when he,

1487
01:31:02.641 --> 01:31:05.400
your friend doesn't try to fuck her again,
I'll hook up or whatever.

1488
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:09.480
She's going to be like a,
you know,
what's going on.

1489
01:31:09.481 --> 01:31:14.340
Just things seem like it's going on with you.
Hey you,

1490
01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:19.110
hey.
You know,
they do that shit trying to fill.
Yes.

1491
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:24.830
It's a matter is that I does everything all right between like wings or

1492
01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:28.780
the code.
Cause I just kind of noticed,
you know,

1493
01:31:28.781 --> 01:31:32.310
you just kind of let me say hello to me,
but you used to stop me,
you know,

1494
01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:35.700
maybe give me a compliment,
say,
look man,
you can't properly,
oh,

1495
01:31:35.701 --> 01:31:39.780
that head of that bullshit.
Right.
And just be like a,

1496
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.871
yeah.
You know,

1497
01:31:41.871 --> 01:31:45.530
I just kind of heard through the grapevine that you have a boyfriend,

1498
01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:48.650
a serious full on relationship boyfriend.
So,
uh,

1499
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:51.290
kind of threw me for a loop because you never brought it up.

1500
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:53.350
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1501
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:57.770
<v 3>Oh yeah.
That,
um,
Kay.</v>

1502
01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:00.690
Uh,
all right.

1503
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:05.460
I should have said something and right there,
you know,

1504
01:32:05.461 --> 01:32:10.461
she just trying to work her way out of it with the long pauses between what

1505
01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:15.930
she's saying.
Yeah.
That bullshit and just,

1506
01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:21.900
I just don't say anything and just look at her and she stammers her way through

1507
01:32:21.901 --> 01:32:25.770
it.
If she does,
she might be one of these people who like,

1508
01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:29.520
she's probably going to just turn around and fucking walk away because a,

1509
01:32:29.521 --> 01:32:32.160
she doesn't like confrontations.
She could deal with confrontation.

1510
01:32:32.161 --> 01:32:34.890
She'd get out of that fucking relationship,
be like,
look,
I'm not happy.

1511
01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:40.020
I'm not happy.
Okay.
I,
yeah.

1512
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:44.910
So get your books and your Letterman jacket and fucking beat it.
You know,

1513
01:32:44.911 --> 01:32:47.360
whatever the hell you got to say.
Um,
yes,
I,

1514
01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:51.450
did I give any advice or did I just imitate this girl that I never met?

1515
01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:55.080
That's what I would do.
I would confirm from someone who knows her really well,

1516
01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:58.060
that she has a boyfriend and when she,
and,

1517
01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:01.530
and just be nice to her,
hey,
what's going on?

1518
01:33:01.531 --> 01:33:05.670
You don't want to create any fucking shit at work because you need the job.

1519
01:33:05.671 --> 01:33:09.210
You don't want to lose your,
your,
uh,
any money or whatever.
Look,

1520
01:33:09.211 --> 01:33:12.570
at the end of the day,
you fucking banged her.
All right?
So that's a plus.

1521
01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:14.950
<v 7>Uh,</v>

1522
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.250
<v 3>no,
that's not the kind of girl you want to marry.</v>

1523
01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:23.020
Someone would be in a full on fucking relationship and would,
would,
uh,

1524
01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:27.730
try to set up where you're,
you're,
you're fucking somebody else on the side.

1525
01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:32.360
That's not the mother,
your kids,
you know,
I mean,
grant,
the only thing saving her,

1526
01:33:32.370 --> 01:33:34.840
she's young,
so she has some growing up to do.
But uh,
yeah,

1527
01:33:34.841 --> 01:33:36.970
you don't wanna be involved in that because next thing you know,

1528
01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:40.750
you're the guy in the fall on relationship with her and she's banging some other

1529
01:33:40.751 --> 01:33:43.120
way to run the side when she does not a break up with you.

1530
01:33:43.630 --> 01:33:47.770
So I would stay away from that girl and uh,
that's it.

1531
01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:52.570
Then I would also stop fucking people where I work.
That's another thing.

1532
01:33:52.571 --> 01:33:54.160
You don't shit where you eat,
where you eat.

1533
01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:57.400
It's something you do when you're young,
you know,
you just,

1534
01:33:58.570 --> 01:34:03.490
you just fucking your vicinity and your facility.
But uh,
yeah,

1535
01:34:03.491 --> 01:34:06.820
I would try to avoid doing that.
So that's,
that's basically my advice.

1536
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:09.010
Do you want me to say it again?

1537
01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:12.310
I just keep saying the same thing over and over again in different order.

1538
01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:16.510
That's a,
that's how I would handle that situation.
And uh,
and with that,

1539
01:34:16.511 --> 01:34:20.140
I think I'm pretty much out of information that people have given to me this

1540
01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:22.900
week.
Let me do the math here.
I had done 36 minutes.

1541
01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:27.850
I owe you another 14 the fuck am I going to talk about if I could get on the

1542
01:34:27.851 --> 01:34:31.660
Goddamn Internet.
I tried to fucking pick some teams next week.

1543
01:34:31.661 --> 01:34:35.590
Would you guys like tonight Green Bay and the bears,

1544
01:34:35.591 --> 01:34:38.680
this is one of these classic early season match ups.

1545
01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:40.420
We're going to get to see who's for real.

1546
01:34:41.650 --> 01:34:44.170
You know which bears team is going to show up.

1547
01:34:44.650 --> 01:34:49.420
The one that technically lost to the lions in the first fucking week or the one

1548
01:34:49.421 --> 01:34:52.710
that manhandled the cowboys last week.
I Dunno.

1549
01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:56.020
I like Mike Martz is a fucking offensive coordinator.

1550
01:34:56.970 --> 01:34:57.870
MMM.

1551
01:34:59.590 --> 01:35:04.150
If I was a gambling man cause I just do bullshit,
you know,
we're basically,

1552
01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:08.290
it's like a hundred bucks for the year.
Whoever has the best fucking record.

1553
01:35:08.291 --> 01:35:11.560
I know it's a pussy bet.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,

1554
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:17.450
but if I had to gamble tonight,
this might be,
I,
if I would take the home team,

1555
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:21.550
I would take the fucking home team on this one.
Well,

1556
01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:24.350
I don't know how to fucking you say that bill without seeing the God damn point

1557
01:35:24.351 --> 01:35:28.640
spread.
That's a great point.
That is a great fucking point.
Come on,

1558
01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:29.503

Here we go,
uh,

1562
01:35:42.411 --> 01:35:47.411
African American man hoses off a white woman who called him and it's basically

1563
01:35:48.381 --> 01:35:51.830
the n word.
All right.
You have to watch this video.

1564
01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:56.030
It's fucking phenomenal.
And,
uh,
like I always say,

1565
01:35:56.031 --> 01:36:00.230
if you want to,
uh,
rather than search all of these yourself,

1566
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:05.240
just go to the m m podcast.com t h e m m podcast.com,

1567
01:36:05.241 --> 01:36:06.620
the MM podcast.com,

1568
01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.340
the official a fan page for the Monday morning podcast.

1569
01:36:10.341 --> 01:36:15.140
We'll have all the youtube videos right in a fucking row
and you can just,

1570
01:36:15.141 --> 01:36:17.630
you can just blow right through them.
All right.

1571
01:36:17.631 --> 01:36:22.310
So look up African American man hoses off a white woman who called him,
uh,

1572
01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:27.530
the n word and uh,
it's just awesome.
She's in one of those motorized,
you know,

1573
01:36:27.531 --> 01:36:32.531
those motorized carts that people who can walk but you know,

1574
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:35.930
don't feel like it drive,
I don't understand them.

1575
01:36:35.931 --> 01:36:36.920
It's different than a wheelchair.

1576
01:36:36.921 --> 01:36:39.920
Wheelchair for the most part means you can't walk.

1577
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:43.920
But those motorized carts mean,
uh,
I dunno,

1578
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:46.670
I think you can't walk for long.
Yeah.

1579
01:36:46.671 --> 01:36:49.760
You can't walk for long distances and a,

1580
01:36:49.761 --> 01:36:53.420
so these are sort of drive and you have an inability to stand up on a segway and

1581
01:36:53.421 --> 01:36:55.820
you're worried that you're going to drive off a cliff and go into a fucking

1582
01:36:55.821 --> 01:36:59.690
river.
So anyways,
guys,

1583
01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.170
Washington is fucking 85 caprice classic I believe.

1584
01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:07.430
And this woman just fuck it is on the other side of the street yelling at him

1585
01:37:07.431 --> 01:37:08.510
and he just starts fucking,

1586
01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:14.810
you know what I love?
It's not that he just sort of like,
you know,

1587
01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:18.200
back and forth poses a rough,
like he's spraying a garden,

1588
01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.060
he full on blast her in the face and just holds it there.

1589
01:37:23.061 --> 01:37:27.290
And it's really great because it's the whole like with black people used to,

1590
01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:28.041
you know,

1591
01:37:28.041 --> 01:37:31.490
we had to march for civil rights in the fucking evil white people would be

1592
01:37:31.491 --> 01:37:35.690
holding the hose in their face.
It's come full circle now.

1593
01:37:35.691 --> 01:37:38.690
Here we are 40 fucking years later,
50 years almost.

1594
01:37:38.691 --> 01:37:43.520
And now the black dude is holding it and in the white person's face.
Uh,

1595
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:46.760
but it's just a garden hose.
So it's hilarious.

1596
01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:55.230
He's just spraying or just not moving it.
Go say it again,
say it again,

1597
01:37:55.231 --> 01:37:58.440
bitch.
It's fucking awesome.
Ah,

1598
01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:03.390
and when she drives away in the end and is still giving him shit and she's

1599
01:38:03.391 --> 01:38:08.070
soaking wet,
I mean it was just one of the fucking great laughs.

1600
01:38:08.071 --> 01:38:10.800
I've had an a let's just one of the,
I just,
it was awesome.

1601
01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:15.960
I just fucking die and laugh and watching it and I'm all right.

1602
01:38:15.961 --> 01:38:18.090
Here's the next one.
This one is actually really,

1603
01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:22.170
I can't believe this guy didn't get hurt really bad,
uh,

1604
01:38:22.590 --> 01:38:24.270
airbag test in Russia.

1605
01:38:25.710 --> 01:38:26.543
<v 7>MMM.</v>

1606
01:38:27.010 --> 01:38:32.010
<v 3>This guy has to go at least nine feet in the fucking air and lands like a</v>

1607
01:38:32.681 --> 01:38:37.210
Goddamn rag doll and his friends are just laughing at him.

1608
01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:43.910
I mean,
just the concussive force alone,
what that would do to your eardrums is a,

1609
01:38:43.911 --> 01:38:48.110
is beyond me.
It,
speaking of that,
a reoccurring theme on this podcast,

1610
01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:52.640
I've brought it up a few times because I've done a permanent damage to my ears

1611
01:38:52.641 --> 01:38:57.020
from seeing bands live music and,
uh,
playing drums.

1612
01:38:57.710 --> 01:39:01.490
Um,
I'm telling you because I was out in Nashville,

1613
01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:05.510
my buddy out there took me out to some clubs that I always have the earplugs.

1614
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:11.590
And I was actually talking to this guy who was about my age and,

1615
01:39:11.871 --> 01:39:16.430
uh,
from what his friends was saying,
you know,
God,
a lot of ass back in the day.

1616
01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:20.930
All right.
And he was,
see,
saw that it had on ear plugs.
He goes,
what?
He goes,

1617
01:39:20.931 --> 01:39:23.780
do you wear those all the time?
I go,
yeah,
I tried to.
He goes,
yeah,

1618
01:39:23.781 --> 01:39:27.590
because recently I went to the doctor and the guy said,
hey,
uh,

1619
01:39:27.591 --> 01:39:32.270
were you ever in the military?
And he said No.
And he asked,
did you work in,
in,

1620
01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:36.350
in a machine shop?
Basically asking all those fucking questions.

1621
01:39:36.351 --> 01:39:38.450
And the guy just said no.
And I'm telling you,

1622
01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:43.900
it was from years of going out to bars where they got the music cranked way too

1623
01:39:44.571 --> 01:39:48.140
fucking loud and uh,
you know,

1624
01:39:48.141 --> 01:39:52.190
that shit we hitting on the girl.
Do you live around here?

1625
01:39:53.210 --> 01:39:57.680
You literally leaning into her ear,
you're screaming into her fucking ear.
Like,

1626
01:39:57.681 --> 01:40:01.700
just imagine if there was no music on and somebody did that to you,

1627
01:40:01.701 --> 01:40:04.760
you punch him in the face.
But when you're in those clubs,

1628
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:09.970
the music is so fucking loud that someone has to get right near your ear and

1629
01:40:10.131 --> 01:40:13.760
yell into it just so you can hear him.
So I'm telling you,

1630
01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:15.533
<v 7>MMM,</v>

1631
01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:20.120
<v 3>I didn't know how the fuck I got on this subject.
Well,
I guess the airbag test,</v>

1632
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:23.540
you know,
I know you're young and then you got ear plugs.

1633
01:40:23.541 --> 01:40:27.470
What do you fucking queer?
I'm telling you,
put those goddamn things in.

1634
01:40:27.650 --> 01:40:29.060
You've ever one experiment,
one night,

1635
01:40:29.150 --> 01:40:34.150
just where one where one and stand in there for a fucking half hour and walk out

1636
01:40:36.561 --> 01:40:38.660
and take the other one out and feel the difference.
Your,

1637
01:40:38.690 --> 01:40:41.460
you're the ear that didn't have one is going to feel like it's underwater.

1638
01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.760
And every time you do that you're doing permanent.

1639
01:40:43.761 --> 01:40:46.190
Like can I have your ears ring out of nowhere?

1640
01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:49.640
You just walking down the street and they go,
Ooh.
Yeah,

1641
01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:53.830
that means you have,
you have permanent hearing damage.

1642
01:40:55.150 --> 01:40:58.420
Uh,
so where are your earplugs?
Their kids,
he's as crisis.

1643
01:40:58.421 --> 01:41:01.510
One of the fucking Corny is things I've ever said,
but I dunno.

1644
01:41:02.850 --> 01:41:07.840
It's driven people to suicide.
So because it just keeps getting louder.
All right,

1645
01:41:07.841 --> 01:41:11.200
here's another raw,
he's another fucking youtube video.
This one is unbelievable.

1646
01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:16.210
It's called Uks best free runners and a,

1647
01:41:16.211 --> 01:41:19.180
it's like a six minute video.
Usually.
I don't like videos this long,
but this is,

1648
01:41:19.210 --> 01:41:21.970
these are these people who basically,
um,

1649
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:25.170
run and jump off of like,
you know,

1650
01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:29.050
out of second story windows land and roll and keep going and do like a fucking

1651
01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:33.820
backflip and then run up the side of a tree and then do another back flip that

1652
01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:34.960
fucking unbelievable.

1653
01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:40.200
And the only thing that this video is missing is I want to see a free runner.

1654
01:41:40.450 --> 01:41:44.380
Get chased by a cop on foot because this dude,

1655
01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:49.720
one of these guys,
he fucking runs at,
uh,
you know,
those,
those big,

1656
01:41:49.721 --> 01:41:54.340
um,
when you go down to like a,
uh,
like a,
a wharf,

1657
01:41:55.210 --> 01:41:56.980
if you're not doing a drug deal or whatever,
you know,

1658
01:41:56.981 --> 01:42:01.480
those big containers that they basically lift off of the ship and they can put

1659
01:42:01.481 --> 01:42:04.510
on the back of an 18 wheeler.
That's what it basically looks like.

1660
01:42:04.511 --> 01:42:06.820
It looks like that the back of an 18 wheeler,

1661
01:42:06.821 --> 01:42:11.821
this fucking dude is running full speed at it and then runs two steps like Bo

1662
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:18.030
Jackson up the side of the thing and then grabs the top of it and does a pull up

1663
01:42:18.431 --> 01:42:23.431
and pulls himself up and this is all one motion continues to run and then jumps

1664
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:25.690
like a six feet,

1665
01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:30.460
six foot gap over to this other building where he's got where he's got to reach

1666
01:42:30.461 --> 01:42:34.420
up,
jump to the ledge,
does another pull up and now he's up on the building.

1667
01:42:34.450 --> 01:42:37.780
All of that takes about a second and a half.
And I would just,

1668
01:42:37.781 --> 01:42:42.250
would have loved to seen a cop chasing this dude and he just wouldn't,
you know,

1669
01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:44.170
even if he wanted to shoot him,

1670
01:42:44.171 --> 01:42:46.540
he couldn't have got the gun out quick enough and it would just would have been

1671
01:42:46.541 --> 01:42:49.360
like,
yeah,
pursuits over.
I don't know.
I,

1672
01:42:49.410 --> 01:42:53.850
he was in front of me and then he ran up a fucking building.
Now Dude,

1673
01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:58.000
I'm telling you,
he ran up a building.
I didn't have time to show them.

1674
01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:03.960
Well you fucking chase a check that out is another quick one.

1675
01:43:04.690 --> 01:43:09.250
Ladies teeth fall out during divorce court.
That's pretty much self explanatory.

1676
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:13.960
Um,
and then I've got a couple of Tourette's videos.

1677
01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:19.240
There's a guy with Tourette's,
Tourette's,
Karaoke,
um,

1678
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:23.170
tourettes karaoke and the guys do an rdms losing my religion.

1679
01:43:23.171 --> 01:43:27.430
It's fucking hilarious.
Then there's a,
there's another one out there called,
uh,

1680
01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:31.700
the best of Tourette's guy.
And,
um,
I,
I'm,

1681
01:43:31.701 --> 01:43:35.420
I'm convinced the guy's an actor because he doesn't have Tourette's.

1682
01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:37.510
And as far as you know,

1683
01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:40.570
being on the opiate Anthony show and being around people with Tourette's for a

1684
01:43:40.571 --> 01:43:41.560
long fucking time,

1685
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:46.950
it's sort of a rep repetition of either weird noises and there is cursing.

1686
01:43:47.741 --> 01:43:52.670
But the way this guy's cursing,
it's tourists.
It's not Tourette's,

1687
01:43:52.730 --> 01:43:56.280
Tourette's.
It's not tourettes,
but it's fucking hilarious.

1688
01:43:56.281 --> 01:44:00.560
So look up Tourette's guy.
Um,
and that's it.

1689
01:44:00.770 --> 01:44:04.870
That's what I got this week.
I'm sorry.
I have the windows open.

1690

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.140
Um,

1725
01:46:15.230 --> 01:46:18.620

01:46:30.021 --> 01:46:34.400
Drew Show love line on October 6th.

1730
01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:37.610
Hi,
look at me moving up in the radio world.

1731
01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:42.020
Those are three famous fucking people's shows I'm doing.
Um,

1732
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:47.580
later on this month I'm coming out to Minnesota in Chicago to do one nighters at

1733
01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:50.550
theaters and these tickets are fucking selling tremendously.

1734
01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:54.090
So if you're thinking to go and get the tickets now because,
uh,

1735
01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.720
I am blown away by the response out there and play in the Pantages theater in

1736
01:46:59.970 --> 01:47:04.110
Minneapolis,
Minnesota on October 22nd,
I'm playing the Vic Theater in Chicago,

1737
01:47:04.111 --> 01:47:08.550
Illinois the following weekend.
And uh,

1738
01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:10.770
and here's a quick date that I opened.

1739
01:47:10.771 --> 01:47:15.750
I'm doing one night only at the funny bone in Saint Louis on October 30th,

1740
01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:20.540
October 30th.
Everybody one night only.
So come on down,

1741
01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:25.320
check out my new hour.
All my material is 100% different from,

1742
01:47:25.321 --> 01:47:30.090
uh,
from the let it go special.
And speaking of that,
let it go.

1743
01:47:30.090 --> 01:47:34.440
We'll be aired again on comedy central October 1st.

1744
01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.600
Please watch it.
Um,
if you can watch it live,
because that,

1745
01:47:39.601 --> 01:47:43.290
those are the only ones that I get credit for as far as the ratings.
Um,

1746
01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:47.670
you guys want to hear a little behind the behind the curtain show business shit.

1747
01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:48.980
This is how it works.
Uh,

1748
01:47:49.110 --> 01:47:53.490
how the ratings work is they don't count Tivo watches if you record it and then

1749
01:47:53.491 --> 01:47:57.070
you watch it,
they don't count it because you know,

1750
01:47:57.071 --> 01:48:01.560
when I know that you blow through the commercials and ratings exists so they can

1751
01:48:01.561 --> 01:48:04.950
figure out how much they can charge advertisers so they can figure out how many

1752
01:48:04.951 --> 01:48:09.150
people are actually watching the goddamn commercial.
So,
um,

1753
01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:13.520
October 1st comedy central is showing,
uh,
let it go again.
And,
uh,

1754
01:48:13.521 --> 01:48:16.160
that's pretty much it.
Oh,
and a Halloween,
I'm hanging out.

1755
01:48:16.190 --> 01:48:20.820
I'm going to the rams game in St Louis,
so there you go.
That is it.

1756
01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:24.060
That is it.
And just so if you want to plan ahead,

1757
01:48:24.061 --> 01:48:28.350
I got the funny bone and Columbus,
Ohio,
November 12th,

1758
01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:31.650
13th and 14th,
and then a,

1759
01:48:31.651 --> 01:48:35.820
I'm in DC at the listener auditorium on uh,

1760
01:48:35.821 --> 01:48:39.630
November 19th.
And then I'm doing Foxwoods,
right?

1761
01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:45.330
Foxwoods day.
You Go Foxwoods on November 20th.
There's another one,

1762
01:48:45.331 --> 01:48:47.760
people don't come to Connecticut.
I'm in Connecticut,

1763
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:50.340
November 20th and a,

1764
01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:54.120
and then the last one I will give you is I'm at the Moore Theater in Seattle,

1765
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:59.670
November 27th.
And,
uh,
the,
this is a huge little mini run for me.

1766
01:48:59.671 --> 01:49:02.010
This is the first time I actually tried to do theaters on my own.

1767
01:49:02.370 --> 01:49:04.410
So I'm really excited about that.
All this and this.

1768
01:49:04.411 --> 01:49:08.010
How much of a sports fan I am,
I'm flying in the Friday night,

1769
01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:13.930
uh,
to do the radio,
so you know,
to the radio to hype the,
the,
uh,

1770
01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:14.773
the Damn Gig.

1771
01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:18.180
And I'm actually going to drive down and go to that Trailblazer Hornets game.

1772
01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:23.280
And then I'm going to the cities Seattle Seahawks game on the Sunday afterwards.

1773
01:49:23.730 --> 01:49:26.790
And I brought all of that up is the lovely Nia.
Just walked in here.

1774
01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:29.040
The lovely Nia just walked in here.

1775
01:49:29.041 --> 01:49:31.740
Does that make you upset than US spending an extra day on the road to go to a

1776
01:49:31.741 --> 01:49:36.360
football game?
Huh?
Come here.
Come here.
Come in here.

1777
01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:42.420
Come here.
It's not until the end of next month.
I like football.

1778
01:49:43.050 --> 01:49:46.920
I love you.
But I liked football.
Come here.
Come over here.

1779
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.100
Oh,
she just slammed down her purse as if to say,

1780
01:49:52.110 --> 01:49:53.440
you know you don't like the rams.

1781
01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:55.110
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1782
01:49:55.110 --> 01:49:57.600
<v 3>Saint Louis Rams.
Let me tell you about the rams there.</v>

1783
01:49:57.601 --> 01:50:02.280
One of the original teams that made up the NFL and uh,

1784
01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:05.250
they were in Los Angeles for a while and that didn't work out well.

1785
01:50:05.251 --> 01:50:09.270
It worked out for a while and then they,
then they,
then they moved down.

1786
01:50:09.330 --> 01:50:14.330
I don't care to Anaheim where Disneyland is one of the happy places and then

1787
01:50:14.671 --> 01:50:19.470
after Awhile Punch you in your patronizing red face.

1788
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:26.760
Come on.
If I fight,
this is a technique that,
you know what?
I have OCD.
All right.

1789
01:50:26.761 --> 01:50:31.290
If I go to that rams game,
first of all,
the only team in,
in the,
in,
in,

1790
01:50:31.370 --> 01:50:35.220
in the Midwest,
first of all,
you don't have OCD.
Stop being dramatic.

1791
01:50:35.221 --> 01:50:38.160
There are people who actually have OCD and they want to kill themselves.

1792
01:50:38.161 --> 01:50:41.070
You don't have OCD.
You like going to football games,

1793
01:50:41.170 --> 01:50:43.060
but it doesn't mean you have OCD.
You

1794
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:47.820
see that that's what you need in your life.

1795
01:50:47.821 --> 01:50:50.160
You need a woman can put you in your place when you're being ridiculous.

1796
01:50:50.161 --> 01:50:55.020
Was I being ridiculous?
Yes.
You just gave me the look really

1797
01:50:55.170 --> 01:50:56.003
<v 2>and what?</v>

1798
01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:59.570
<v 3>Stop cursing on the podcast.</v>

1799
01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:03.110
You know I had enough of you see that the supposed to be honest in a fucking

1800
01:51:03.111 --> 01:51:06.440
relationship.
I told you what I'm doing rather than coming home,

1801
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:09.920
I'm going to the fucking rams game.
Oh,
here she comes.
To be honest with you,

1802
01:51:09.921 --> 01:51:13.700
the fact that you've been on the road constantly and are choosing to stay out

1803
01:51:13.701 --> 01:51:17.900
longer is really fucking rude.
I have two weeks off.
Yeah,

1804
01:51:17.901 --> 01:51:21.470
exactly where you should be home.
I'm going to be home during those two weeks.

1805
01:51:21.471 --> 01:51:25.070
These are,
these fucking games are in like November except for the fine go.

1806
01:51:25.071 --> 01:51:29.700
I don't want to see you.
Anyone except for the two in October.
Uh,

1807
01:51:29.701 --> 01:51:31.620
she just gave me the finger.
Are you doing,

1808
01:51:31.710 --> 01:51:34.680
you're not going to do the pumpkin bread or anything.

1809
01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:37.110
I'm going to do the Pumpkins and I'm also gonna make the Pumpkin bread.

1810
01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:39.420
I'm big on Halloween.
Everybody.
I like it.
You don't have to,

1811
01:51:39.421 --> 01:51:40.830
but you don't have to buy any gifts.

1812
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:45.330
You know all these kids coming up the stairs dressed like Godzilla.

1813
01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:48.830
Yeah,
it's adorable.
And I make it.

1814
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:52.500
How great was the punk and Brennan made last year?
It was great.

1815
01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:55.050
You make great pumpkin bread.
You're a great baker.

1816
01:51:57.770 --> 01:52:01.620
That was all insulting.
It was great.
It was great pumpkin bread.
You're great.

1817
01:52:01.621 --> 01:52:04.700
But you know what,
you know,
I don't,
you know what,
I,

1818
01:52:04.710 --> 01:52:08.710
I'm smart enough not to engage in this with you.
This,
Ooh,

1819
01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:13.470
this is just your way saying that you love me and you miss me,

1820
01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:15.720
so I'm not gonna engage in this.
I love you too.

1821
01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:17.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1822
01:52:17.490 --> 01:52:21.090
<v 3>Ah,
see,
figure that one out.
Go,
go,
go.
Pour yourself a bowl of cereal.</v>

1823
01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:23.850
Get out of my face.
I'm going to finish this up.
Oh,

1824
01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:27.120
I'll be that fucking cheap shot.

1825
01:52:27.290 --> 01:52:30.960
It was a woman ever just square up and it just go,
let's go.
They don't,

1826
01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:35.280
they wait till you're not looking in your fucking throw a punch.
Fucking cheap.

1827
01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:38.550
It was nice.
It was right where my appendix used to be.

1828
01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:43.620
Did you have your appendix out?
Um,
yes I did.

1829
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:46.490
I had it out back in the day,

1830
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:49.550
way back in the day on those little house in the prairie days where you almost

1831
01:52:49.551 --> 01:52:53.150
died of it because people didn't know what's wrong with you walking around.

1832
01:52:53.151 --> 01:52:57.980
You face the same color as glue.
Your Dad just go and I'll throw out your bed.

1833
01:52:57.981 --> 01:52:58.940
You're being a baby.

1834
01:53:00.590 --> 01:53:05.510
I feel like there's somebody had visible stabbing me in my side.
Ah,

1835
01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:09.680
come on.
Come on.
Stop it.
Grow Up.
Um,
all right,

1836
01:53:09.681 --> 01:53:13.940
that's the podcast for this week.
Um,
so please,

1837
01:53:14.150 --> 01:53:16.030
um,
checkout,

1838
01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:19.340
checkout my special October 1st if you missed it and please buy tickets to my

1839
01:53:19.341 --> 01:53:20.900
shows.
I have a brand new hour.

1840
01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:25.960
I have a big theater tour coming up and uh,

1841
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:30.030
you know what else I did mentioned?
I didn't mention this shit.
All right,

1842
01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:32.610
because this is a high book myself on the road.
I have to whisper here.

1843
01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:35.730
So Nia doesn't figure this shit out.

1844
01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:40.980
That how I booked myself on the road is take like the funny bone and Columbus,

1845
01:53:41.131 --> 01:53:44.700
Ohio.
All right,
I'm going to be there the 12th,

1846
01:53:44.701 --> 01:53:49.290
13th and 14th of November.
Why did we pick this weekend?
You know what I mean?

1847
01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:53.580
Who the fuck?
Why the fuck would you ever go to Columbus,
Ohio?

1848
01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:59.080
There's only one fucking reason and that's to go to Ohio state buckeyes game.

1849
01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:00.510
Other than that,

1850
01:54:00.510 --> 01:54:04.950
there's no fucking reason unless you want to join a militia or maybe use that as

1851
01:54:04.951 --> 01:54:08.580
your base camp as you drive down to go see that chick who plays with the

1852
01:54:08.581 --> 01:54:13.500
pretenders and I forget where the fuck she's from.
So anyways,

1853
01:54:13.501 --> 01:54:17.450
Ohio state is playing Penn state that day.
And,
uh,

1854
01:54:17.451 --> 01:54:19.920
I'm really rolling the dice because of the flex schedule,

1855
01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:23.550
which is basically if Ohio state and Penn state are ranked really high,

1856
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:25.830
that game will then become an eight o'clock game.

1857
01:54:25.831 --> 01:54:27.930
So not only will I not get to go to the game,

1858
01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:31.620
nobody will show up to my fucking show because everyone's going to be at the

1859
01:54:31.621 --> 01:54:35.040
fucking Goddamn Ohio state game.
All right?

1860
01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:37.980
And I'm telling you people,
if you,
if you,

1861
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:42.690
if you come from like a town I come from,
which is a professional sports team,

1862
01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:45.330
a professional sports town,

1863
01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:49.440
you have no fucking idea how insane it can get.

1864
01:54:50.460 --> 01:54:53.940
<v 1>Like as much as they,
they talk about the Yankees,</v>

1865
01:54:53.941 --> 01:54:58.941
red sox rivalry and how fucking insane it can't hold a candle to Ohio state,

1866
01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:04.260
Michigan.
If you don't believe me,
Hbo did a documentary on it and it,
it's,

1867
01:55:04.290 --> 01:55:07.920
it's absolutely fucking insane.
And I'll tell you right now,

1868
01:55:08.130 --> 01:55:13.130
if Fenway Park or Yankee Stadium Somehow held a hundred thousand fucking people,

1869
01:55:13.650 --> 01:55:17.640
they wouldn't sell it out.
You couldn't get 100,000 people to go to that.

1870
01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:20.550
I don't think you'd get 100,000 people to go to a fucking world series game.

1871
01:55:21.410 --> 01:55:25.820
<v 3>Um,
but college football,
they'll fucking have 100,000 people just to watch.</v>

1872
01:55:25.821 --> 01:55:28.670
Ohio state kicked the shit out of bowling green.
They don't give a shit.

1873
01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:35.360
They just show up.
Um,
anyways,
that is the podcast for this week

1874
01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:38.380
<v 1>and I realized that a,
I didn't address that.</v>

1875
01:55:38.381 --> 01:55:41.200
My podcast has been taken off of iTunes.
Uh,

1876
01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:44.100
I believe that was something that I did.
I figure out what it is,

1877
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:44.670
<v 3>but um,</v>

1878
01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:47.940
I have some people working on it and I didn't even address it because I'm hoping

1879
01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:51.120
it's just gonna be a one week problem and a,
that is it.

1880
01:55:51.121 --> 01:55:54.060
That's the podcast for this week.
A good luck to everybody.

1881
01:55:54.061 --> 01:55:58.830
I know who the fucking patriots have next week we have the dolphins and I'll

1882
01:55:58.831 --> 01:56:00.720
tell you right now,
I don't like that game.

1883
01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:04.410
I don't fucking like it until we have a God damn defense.

1884
01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:08.400
I don't like any game that we're playing.
I don't like it,

1885
01:56:08.401 --> 01:56:11.460
but I'm loving Hernandez.
I'm loving that guy.

1886
01:56:11.461 --> 01:56:15.300
But I'm hoping Mohs is going to get some more touches because he's going to

1887
01:56:15.301 --> 01:56:19.950
start bitching or something.
I don't fucking know.
God Damn it.

1888
01:56:19.951 --> 01:56:20.970
That's my prediction right now.

1889
01:56:20.971 --> 01:56:24.120
The way we've played the first three weeks and all the points we let up,

1890
01:56:24.121 --> 01:56:27.390
I'm saying we're going to go nine and seven.
Um,

1891
01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:32.240
and we might even be tied for second with the dolphins and they might even be 10

1892
01:56:32.241 --> 01:56:36.630
and six jets might go 11 and five.
Um,

1893
01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:38.760
I got to wait till the jets actually play another contender.

1894
01:56:38.761 --> 01:56:42.560
I know we're playing the Steelers.
I don't know if the jets play them,
but that's,

1895
01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:45.150
that's going to be a big game when Ben Roethlisberger is back.

1896
01:56:45.151 --> 01:56:49.590
I'll tell you what,
jet fans,
I'll tell you this right now.
Okay.

1897
01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:53.310
And know that the reason why I gave the jet so much shit A's because they're

1898
01:56:53.311 --> 01:56:55.950
from New York and also because they were talking so much fucking shit.

1899
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:58.230
That's what happens.
That's what happens.

1900
01:56:58.231 --> 01:57:01.860
And noticed after they got their fucking asses kicked,

1901
01:57:01.861 --> 01:57:05.210
they didn't get their asses kicked but they lost.
Where's all the shit talking?

1902
01:57:05.230 --> 01:57:08.490
Now they shut the fuck up,
which is actually me hating the jets.

1903
01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:11.370
I kind of wished that they beat the ravens cause they still would have been

1904
01:57:11.371 --> 01:57:15.690
talking and then they would have been in a situation like the 2007 Patriots

1905
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:18.690
where the entire league wants to kick the shit out of you.

1906
01:57:18.691 --> 01:57:22.680
And eventually someone does and you go home sad with your head hanging down.

1907
01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:26.610
But I will tell you this,
if you guys do play the fucking Steelers,
all right,

1908
01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:30.390
at Big Ben is back and uh,
you know,

1909
01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:35.040
and you guys beat him then I will say you guys are for are for real.

1910
01:57:35.710 --> 01:57:36.130
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1911
01:57:36.130 --> 01:57:39.590
<v 3>All right.
And as much as you,
New Yorkers can't fucking stand,
stand me.</v>

1912
01:57:39.710 --> 01:57:41.870
You gotta admit that's how you have to be.

1913
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:46.930
You can't just say you the shit and not be the shit.

1914
01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:49.990
And then everybody just says you're the shit unless you Peyton Manning,

1915
01:57:49.991 --> 01:57:54.310
of course,
who could just do no fucking wrong.
Right?
Right.
Once again,

1916
01:57:54.311 --> 01:57:58.270
he's off to a ds on a fucking tear,
putting up ridiculous numbers.

1917
01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:00.910
And I'll tell you this fucking cold fence.

1918
01:58:02.650 --> 01:58:07.300
If Peyton manning wants three super bowls with the regular season stats that

1919
01:58:07.301 --> 01:58:07.841
he's put up,

1920
01:58:07.841 --> 01:58:12.730
if you want to say that he's the best guy who ever played that position at that

1921
01:58:12.731 --> 01:58:15.880
point,
I would have a hard time argument because he would,

1922
01:58:17.110 --> 01:58:20.320
he would have that final piece that he needed,

1923
01:58:20.321 --> 01:58:25.321
which was leading your team in the playoffs to the promise land as opposed to

1924
01:58:26.321 --> 01:58:30.040
getting them to the promise land.
You're right there at the gates,
a Wally world.

1925
01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:34.360
And then throwing a pick six to fucking John Candy and he runs it back 60 yards.

1926
01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:39.280
All right,
so all you fucking guys,
cause you guys love your team so much.

1927
01:58:39.281 --> 01:58:40.690
You're not even listening to what I'm saying.

1928
01:58:40.810 --> 01:58:44.080
All said was rex Ryan is his out of his fucking mind.

1929
01:58:44.081 --> 01:58:46.120
He's not as confident as he acts.

1930
01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:50.170
He cries himself to sleep with a fucking gallon ice cream every night.
And uh,

1931
01:58:50.171 --> 01:58:52.450
he has,
uh,
a as a,
a chronic need to be liked.

1932
01:58:52.451 --> 01:58:55.240
And I am right on all of those fucking points.
I don't give a shit.

1933
01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:58.530
And also said that all this shit you were talking was bullshit,

1934
01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:02.680
which was proven in the first fucking week when you lost.
All right?
So when you,

1935
01:59:02.681 --> 01:59:05.410
when you beat a legitimate super bowl contender,

1936
01:59:05.470 --> 01:59:07.270
which you have yet to fucking play,

1937
01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:12.760
all you've played so far is one team that has a playoff level defense and you

1938
01:59:12.761 --> 01:59:15.850
didn't beat them all.
Right?
Really?

1939
01:59:15.851 --> 01:59:17.720
Do you think that dolphins are going to win the Superbowl?

1940
01:59:17.730 --> 01:59:20.410
Do you really think you're going to run into them again in the fucking playoffs

1941
01:59:21.250 --> 01:59:23.260
with their no-name QB?
You're not.

1942
01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:26.400
Do you think the Patriots are going to do anything letting up 30 points of

1943
01:59:26.401 --> 01:59:27.700
fucking game than not?

1944
01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:31.210
I know that because Bella check is still there and Tom Brady is still there.

1945
01:59:31.211 --> 01:59:34.690
You think that there's still the o four or o seven paths?
They're not,

1946
01:59:35.170 --> 01:59:38.860
they're not.
This is,
this is a whole new fucking team.
And um,

1947
01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:42.420
and at,
let me,
it's fucking ridiculous.

1948
01:59:42.421 --> 01:59:46.020
We have to score like 35 38 points to get a victory.

1949
01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:50.280
We scored 38 points on the bills,
38 points.

1950
01:59:50.281 --> 01:59:54.810
And it was still a nail biter right down to the fucking end.
All right,

1951
01:59:54.811 --> 01:59:55.440
whatever.

1952
01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:59.120
It's fucking frustrating and you guys couldn't beat the dolphins to the last
guy.

1953
01:59:59.121 --> 02:00:01.740
Didn't play the game and you guys are sitting there talking super bowl.

1954
02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:05.130
Is that what you ice cream fucking eat and fags down there in New York?

1955
02:00:05.131 --> 02:00:05.940
Is that what you're doing?

1956
02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:09.890
Who's team actually plays in New Jersey while you douchebags ago.

1957
02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:13.860
Why is it called in New England patriots?
This not even a Boston team.

1958
02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:15.270
That's how dumb New Yorkers are.

1959
02:00:15.271 --> 02:00:17.970
They don't realize that Massachusetts is in New England.

1960
02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:21.900
It's a region of the northeast.
All right,

1961
02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:26.100
for all you fucks who don't know your history.
The Boston Patriots started out,

1962
02:00:26.130 --> 02:00:27.540
they played it Nickerson field.

1963
02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:30.750
Nobody showed up because nobody knew who the fuck they were.

1964
02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:32.490
It was considered an inferior league.

1965
02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:36.480
They were going bankrupt in an a desperate attempt to try to rope in more

1966
02:00:36.481 --> 02:00:39.960
fucking fans.
They switched to New England patriots.

1967
02:00:39.961 --> 02:00:41.700
Something that I have never liked.

1968
02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:44.910
I still think that they should be called the Boston patriots.

1969
02:00:45.150 --> 02:00:49.200
All that fucking Patriot tea party horse,
shit all happened at Boston.

1970
02:00:49.201 --> 02:00:53.070
They should be called the Boston patriots,
but they're not.
So that's why.

1971
02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:54.750
But Boston is a new England.

1972
02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:59.340
You Dumb New York or Fox and you guys got a lot of nerve considering the New

1973
02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:04.080
York jets and the New York giants play in New Jersey and share a fucking

1974
02:01:04.081 --> 02:01:07.800
stadium.
It's why don't you guys stand the fuck down.
All right.

1975
02:01:09.300 --> 02:01:10.710
See,
that's what always happens.

1976
02:01:10.711 --> 02:01:14.550
I always make good points about football and then my hatred of New York just

1977
02:01:14.551 --> 02:01:18.680
comes up in a minute.
You'll love it.
You'll love it.
Every God to,
you know,

1978
02:01:18.690 --> 02:01:21.960
something.
I actually don't even hate the giants.
I actually liked the giants.

1979
02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:23.643
<v 7>MMM,</v>

1980
02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:28.330
<v 3>no,
no.
I liked the uniforms.
I like the old helmet that they went back to.
I,</v>

1981
02:01:28.331 --> 02:01:33.100
I liked them.
I liked their style of play.
That smash mouth,
Defensive Shit.

1982
02:01:33.101 --> 02:01:38.020
I know that they kind of suck so far.
But uh,
I a conference,
a good coach.

1983
02:01:38.530 --> 02:01:39.980
Maybe you can turn it around.
I don't know.
I don't

1984
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:44.760
<v 1>know what,
but uh,
there's something about the jets.
I just,
there,</v>

1985
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:48.440
you know what it is.
Their fans are desperate and there's just something,

1986
02:01:48.441 --> 02:01:51.710
when you smell desperation,
you just want to see failure,
you know?

1987
02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:52.940
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1988
02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:57.440
<v 1>They just stopped it about that silly little fireman on top of his boyfriend</v>

1989
02:01:57.441 --> 02:02:00.410
shoulders and they're 1920s cheer,

1990
02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:03.650
j e t s jets,
jets,
jets,
and they,

1991
02:02:03.651 --> 02:02:06.020
and they think that that cheer is awesome.

1992
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:11.830
That's what kills me the same way it kills me when red sox fans sink sweet

1993
02:02:13.261 --> 02:02:15.880
Caroline and they think it's awesome to be going.
Bob,

1994
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:18.780
Bob on with your fucking chicks head on your shoulder.

1995
02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:25.530
I swear to God if I could,
if I became the next Hitler,

1996
02:02:25.770 --> 02:02:26.940
but going big on this one.

1997
02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:28.240
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1998
02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:31.930
<v 1>The people that I would target would be red sox fans.</v>

1999
02:02:32.050 --> 02:02:33.880
Anybody who sings pop up,

2000
02:02:33.881 --> 02:02:38.710
I'm in the seventh inning of a red sox game and anyone who puts a fireman on

2001
02:02:38.711 --> 02:02:43.600
this shoulder and goes,
j e t as jets,
jets,
jets.
That's it.
You're out.

2002
02:02:45.300 --> 02:02:46.770
You're fucking out.
You're done.

2003
02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:47.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2004
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:50.540
<v 1>All right.
You're not part of my master plan.</v>

2005
02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:56.450
How g she is.
How fucked up was that?
Well go fuck yourself.

2006
02:02:56.451 --> 02:02:59.240
That's the podcast for this week.
God bless all the,
uh,

2007
02:02:59.241 --> 02:03:03.020
police come out to my shows.
I've got a brand new hour and,
um,

2008
02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:08.780
I,
I think I have a new group.
I think I have a new,
a fun joke about a goat.

2009
02:03:09.230 --> 02:03:13.130
I'm hoping it killed in Nashville,
but God knows those peak.

2010
02:03:13.131 --> 02:03:15.290
God knows the people down there.
Come on,
man.
Who's kidding?
Who,

2011
02:03:16.490 --> 02:03:20.570
how does it goat joke?
Not Kill and fucking Tennessee.
All right.

2012
02:03:20.571 --> 02:03:24.350
The real test.
It's not even gonna be in Albany,

2013
02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:28.070
I think will be in Buffalo,
Albany.
I don't know.

2014
02:03:28.071 --> 02:03:30.430
There's a lot of farm land around there.
Do you know that's the highway.

2015
02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:32.990
I hate the most,
the 87 north,

2016
02:03:32.991 --> 02:03:37.991
just because for so much of my career I drove up there either a bus or a rental

2017
02:03:38.301 --> 02:03:41.030
car,
just go into some fucking nightmare of a gig.

2018
02:03:41.031 --> 02:03:45.290
So I just always associated with that.
I have talked too long.

2019
02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:48.500
I have overstayed my welcome.
God bless all.
Yeah,
I'll see you next week.
